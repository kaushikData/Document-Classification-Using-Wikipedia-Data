'''Academic grading in Mexico''' employs a '''decimal system''', from 0 to 10, to measure the students' scores. The grades are:&lt;ref&gt;Accord No. 17 from the Public Education Secretary; Official Newspaper of the Federation, the 28th of August, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;These scores can be verified in many secondary education certificates.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 10: Excellent (''excelente'')
* 9: Very Good (''muy bien'')
* 8: Good (''bien'')
* 7: Average (''regular'')
* 6: Sufficient (''suficiente'')
* 0–5.9: Insufficient/Failed (''deficiente/reprobado'')

Since [[decimal fractions]] are common, a scale from 0 to 100 is often used to remove the [[decimal point]]. Then, 100 becomes the highest score, and 60 the minimum passing score. Depending on the school, the official [[Academic certificate|certificate]] may use the range 0–100, or these may be converted back to the range 0–10, allowing for some [[rounding]] and [[truncation]].

Although the grades 0–59 are normally given in class or tests, they are not reported as such in certificates. When failed subjects are reported in written, they normally have a score of '''NA''' or '''N/A''', standing for ''No Acreditada'' (Not Accredited) or ''No Aprobada'' (Not Approved).

Major works, such as a written [[thesis]] or doctoral [[dissertation]], may not have a grade, but appear in certificates simply as '''AC''', standing for ''Acreditada'' (Accredited).

Occasionally, institutions, specially [[private school]]s, may use their own grading system, but there must exist conversion rules to convert those grades to their equivalent in the [[Decimal|decimal system]].

== General education ==
Given that the scale of grading ranges from 0 to 100, it is common that the grade indicates the [[percentage]] of correct answers in a given [[exam]].

Grades are most often absolute and not class-specific. Thus, it may be that the top student of the class gets a low grade of 70, while the passing threshold is still 60. That is, [[curve-adjustment]] of scores is rare.

Students in [[Honors student|honor roll]] are usually those with an overall [[grade point average]] of 90 (very good) or more upon graduation. In that case, depending on the school or university, the student may be awarded a "With Honors" [[diploma]].

== Higher education ==
Higher-level educational institutions, such as [[academic degree|degree]]-awarding [[universities]], require a minimum score of 70 (average) to pass a subject, instead of the regular 60.

In many universities, such as federal institutes of technology, an overall grade point average of 90 (very good) or better entitles the student to graduate with honors, other requirements such as a final work or thesis being waived, and automatically awards him or her the professional [[license]] (''cédula profesional'').

=== Postgraduate education ===
Students holding a [[Bachelor's degree]] require at least an overall grade point average of 80 (good) to be allowed to enrol for a [[master's degree|master's]] or a [[doctoral degree]].

At this level, the minimum passing grade is still 70, but students are required to obtain a minimum grade of 80 to be awarded their postgraduate degree.&lt;ref name="Posgrado DGEST"&gt;{{cite book |title= Disposiciones para la Operación de Estudios de Posgrado en el Sistema Nacional de Educación Superior Tecnológica |first1=Reyes |last1=Tamez Guerra |first2=Julio |last2=Rubio Oca |first3=Bulmaro |last3=Fuentes Lemus |first4=Mario |last4=Valdés Garza |date=May 2005 |publisher=Dirección General de Educación Superior Tecnológica |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a score of 80 may be required to maintain other benefits such as a federal [[scholarship]].&lt;ref&gt;CONACYT Scholarships for Postgraduate studies [http://www.conacyt.gob.mx/Becas/Paginas/Default.aspx ¿Cuáles son los principales requisitos para obtener una beca?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100905054423/http://www.conacyt.gob.mx/Becas/Paginas/Default.aspx |date=September 5, 2010 }} (What are the principal requirements to obtain a scholarship?)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Equivalence with other grading systems ==
Due to influence of North American television shows and media, the common [[United States|US]] grading system that uses letters is understood in Mexico, and a rough equivalence can be made to the Mexican system, specially when television shows are [[Dub localization|localized]] for the Mexican audience.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Mexican system !! US system
|-
| 90–100 || A
|-
|  80–89 || B
|-
|  60–79 || C, D
|-
|   0–59 || F
|}

For example, "a straight-A student" may be translated as ''un estudiante de puro 10'', or "a straight-10 student".

Other grading systems, such as those used in [[Europe|European countries]], or the United States GPA values 0.0–4.0, are less known.

'''Anji Play''' ({{zh|c=安吉游戏}}) is an [[early childhood]] [[curriculum]] designed by [[Cheng Xueqin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anji.gov.cn/default.php?mod=article&amp;do=detail&amp;tid=55301|title=安吉县人民政府 安吉骄傲候选人物——程学琴：带领"安吉游戏"走向国际|work=anji.gov.cn|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director, Office of Pre-Primary Education, [[Anji County]] [[:zh-tw:教育局|Department of Education]], [[Zhejiang Province]]. The key elements that make up Anji Play are its [[pedagogy]], site-specific environments, unique materials and integrated technology. The focus of the program is the participating children's [[self-determination]] in choosing what, where, and with whom to play and the role of the teacher as observer, particularly in instances of physical risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/20933/|title=The Politics of True Play with Cheng Xueqin (Learning at the Library)|work=vialogues.com|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anji Play is the full-time curriculum of all public kindergartens in Anji County.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnsece.com/KindTemPlate/MsgDetail/33680&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origin===
[[File:Anji playground with tires, mats, and ladders.png|thumb|left|230 px|An Anji Play set designed by the children of an Anji County elementary school]]
In 1989, China signed [[United Nations]] [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]]. Article 31 recognizes "the rights of the child to rest and leisure, to engage in play and recreational activities appropriate to the age of the child and to participate freely in cultural life and the arts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/crc/files/Rights_overview.pdf |title=A summary of the rights under the Convention on the Rights of the Child |publisher=unicef.org |date= |accessdate=2016-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China]] released the "Standards for Kindergarten Education." It views play in kindergarten as a "foundational activity to be included in every type of educational activity" – i.e. play is a must in education.&lt;ref&gt;Samuelsson, Ingrid, ''Play and Learning in Early Childhood Settings: International Perspectives'' (2008) p.180-184.&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2001, Anji Play was entirely developed outside of the influence of Western educational philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrbhwb/html/2015-06/24/content_1580135.htm|title=人民日报海外版-人民网|work=people.com.cn|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the program’s tenets and the methods used to develop it share resemblances with [[Montessori]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@AnjiPlay/the-21st-century-maria-montessori-is-changing-china-we-should-all-be-paying-attention-461acf0e8bfb#.jytdvmsqq|title=The 21st Century Maria Montessori is Changing China, We Should All Be Paying Attention|first=jesse|last=coffino|date=21 March 2016|work=medium.com|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PENN/&gt; and [[Friedrich Fröbel|Froebel]]. Although Anji Play’s initial development met resistance from parents, a parent outreach program was implemented to teach the value of play in education.

===Expansion===
Today Anji Play is internationally recognized as an early-childhood curriculum&lt;ref name=PENN&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gse.upenn.edu/news/program-director-encourages-early-childhood-play |title=Program Director Encourages Early Childhood Play|date=August 25, 2014 |website=www.gse.upenn.edu |quote=(Penn GSE Senior Fellow Frances Rust) Rust found many similarities to the Montessori method she was trained in.

==Philosophy==
[[File:Anji Play Climbing Cubes .jpg|thumb|right|230 px|Anji Play climbing cubes]]

In Anji Play’s current implementation, children have at least two hours of free play every day. Play environments are outdoors with minimal structuring, and simple tools made of natural materials (i.e., ropes, light bamboo ladders, basic clay pots) are provided as toys, instead of objects sold and marketed as toys. During play time, teachers observe, document, and act as parallel participants.

Anji Play is composed of simple tools made of natural materials such as clay pots, ropes, light bamboo ladders and other everyday objects like barrels and tires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://casholman.com/anji-play-china-2/|title=Anji Play China - Cas Holman|work=casholman.com|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children in the Anji Play environment interact with these objects to create their own playground govern by their own rules. Inherently through Anji Play, children collaborate develop social and motor skills in order to play.&lt;ref&gt;http://jiaoyan.jxedu.gov.cn/jxedu/jxeduRoot/jxjy/xkjy/xqjy/2015/09/20150924025947846.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Adults and instructors are advised to not intervene and instruct, but to observe. From an outside perspective, instructors are taught to trust the children and understand how children navigate conflict and collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;http://zjrb.zjol.com.cn/html/2014-11/07/content_2821107.htm?div=-1&lt;/ref&gt;

This style of non-instructed play defines the phrase '"True Play"'. Anji Play outlines the True Play philosophy in several categories&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anjiplay.com/philosophy|title=Philosophy|work=anjiplay.com|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (split between "Children's Rights" and "Teacher/adult responsibilities"):

The '''Astronomical Society of the Pacific''' ('''ASP''') is an American scientific and educational organization, founded in [[San Francisco]] on February 7, 1889. Its name derives from its origins on the Pacific Coast, but today it has members all over the country and the world. It has the legal status of a nonprofit organization.

It is the largest general [[astronomy]] education society in the world{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}, with members from over 40 countries.

The ASP's goal is to promote public interest in and awareness of astronomy (and increase [[scientific literacy]]) through its publications, web site, and many educational and outreach programs.  These include:

* Project ASTRO - a national program that improves the teaching of astronomy and physical science (using hands-on inquiry-based activities) by pairing amateur and professional astronomers with 4th through 9th grade teachers and classes.
* Family ASTRO - a project that develops kits and games to help families enjoy astronomy in their leisure time and trains astronomers, educators, and community leaders
* Astronomy from the Ground Up - a national program to help educators at smaller science museums, nature centers and environmental education organizations create or enhance astronomy education programs.
* The Night Sky Network - a program with the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] that supports a community of over 450 amateur astronomy clubs around the U.S. in public outreach activities, providing them with kits and training. The clubs have sky gazing events, solar viewings, and give presentations for the public.
* Classroom materials and resources in astronomy (many developed by the Society's educational staff) sold through their online AstroShop or made available free through their web site

The ASP assists with astronomy education and outreach by partnering with other organizations both in the United States and internationally, and organizes an annual meeting to promote the appreciation and understanding of astronomy.

Presidents of the ASP have included such notable astronomers as [[Edwin Hubble]], [[George O. Abell]], and [[Frank Drake]]. [[George Pardee]], who later became Governor of the State of California, served as president in 1899.

==Publications==
The society promotes astronomy education through several publications. ''[[The Universe in the Classroom]]'', a free electronic educational newsletter for teachers and other educators around the world who help students of all ages learn more about the wonders of the universe through astronomy.

''[[Mercury (magazine)|Mercury]]'', the ASP's quarterly on-line membership magazine, covers a wide range of astronomy topics, from history and [[archaeoastronomy]] to cutting-edge developments. First published in 1925 as the ''Leaflets of the ASP'', ''Mercury'' is now disseminated to thousands of ASP members and schools, universities, libraries, observatories, and institutions around the world.

The ASP also publishes the journal ''[[Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific]] (PASP)'' aimed at professional astronomers. The ''PASP'' is a technical journal of refereed papers on astronomical research covering all wavelengths and distance scales as well as papers on the latest innovations in astronomical instrumentation and software, and has been publishing journals since 1889.

The '''''Astronomical Society of the Pacific Conference Series''''' (ASPCS) is a series of over 400 volumes of professional astronomy conference proceedings. Started in 1988, the Conference Series has grown to become a prominent publication series in the world of professional astronomy publications, and now publishes an average of 20-25 volumes per year. Volumes are sold to the attendees of the conferences of which the proceedings are published, as well as being offered through the Astronomical Society of the Pacific's AstroShop, and can be found in the libraries of major universities and research institutions worldwide. In 2004, the ASPCS stepped into electronic publishing, offering electronic access subscriptions for libraries and institutions, as well as individual access to volumes which they have purchased in hard copy form.

''Astronomy Beat'' is an on-line column, which comes out every other week, and features a behind-the-scenes report on some aspect of astronomical discovery, astronomy education, or astronomy as a hobby, written by a key participant.  Authors have included:
* [[Clyde Tombaugh]], retelling the story of his discovery of the (dwarf) planet [[Pluto]]
* [[Michael E. Brown]], discussing the naming of the [[dwarf planet]] [[Makemake (dwarf planet)|Makemake]]
* Noted [[astronomical photographer]] [[David Malin]] describing the transition from [[photographic processing|chemical]] to [[digital photography]]
* [[Virginia Louise Trimble]] explaining how she selected her list of the top ten astronomical discoveries of the last thousand years.

==Awards==
The ASP makes several different awards annually:
*The [[Bruce Medal]] for lifetime contribution to astronomy research.  The medal is named after [[Catherine Wolfe Bruce]].  This award is arguably the most prestigious award given in astronomy.
*The [[Klumpke-Roberts Award]] for outstanding contributions to the public understanding and appreciation of astronomy, named for [[Dorothea Klumpke-Roberts]].
*The [[Amateur Achievement Award of Astronomical Society of the Pacific|Amateur Achievement Award]] in recognition of significant contributions to astronomy by one not employed in the field of astronomy in a professional capacity.
*The [[Bart Bok Award]], named in honor of [[astronomer]] [[Bart Bok]], awarded jointly with the [[American Astronomical Society]] to outstanding student projects in astronomy at the [[International Science and Engineering Fair]].
*The [[Thomas Brennan Award]] for exceptional achievement related to the teaching of astronomy at the high school level.
*The [[Maria and Eric Muhlmann Award]] for recent significant observational results made possible by innovative advances in astronomical instrumentation, software, or observational infrastructure.
*The [[Robert J. Trumpler Award]], named in honor of [[astronomer]] [[Robert J. Trumpler]], given to a recent recipient of a Ph.D degree with a particularly notable thesis.
* The [[Richard H. Emmons|Richard Emmons Award]] is given for a lifetime of contributions to the teaching of astronomy to college non-science majors.
* The Las Cumbres Amateur Outreach Award, established by Wayne Rosing and Dorothy Largay, seeks to honor outstanding educational outreach by an amateur astronomer to K-12 children and the interested lay public.
* The [[Arthur B. C. Walker Jr.|Arthur B.C. Walker II]] Award, first announced in 2016, for research and teaching with a substantial commitment to students from underrepresented groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.astrosociety.org/about-us/awards/ |title=Annual Awards |publisher=Astronomical Society |website=www.astrosociety.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defunct awards==
*The Donohoe Comet Medal (1890–1950). In July 1889 the ASP announced that a bronze medal for "the actual discovery of any unexpected comet" would be awarded on the basis of a $500 gift by Joseph A. Donohoe of San Francisco. The first award was made in March 1890 to [[William Robert Brooks|W. R. Brooks]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific |title=Awards of the Comet-Medal of the ASP (1890-1896) |volume=9 |pages= 99 |date=1897 |location=San Francisco |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xa7nAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA99 |jstor = 40671005}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the discovery of the comet now known as [[16P/Brooks]]. After the 250th medal had been awarded in 1950 the award was discontinued because photography had enabled the discovery of too many comets.&lt;ref name="ASP history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astrosociety.org/about-us/history-of-the-asp/ |title=History |publisher=Astronomical Society |website=www.astrosociety.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Comet Medal (1969–1974). In 1968 the ASP Board voted to create a new Comet Medal to be awarded once yearly to recognize "an outstanding nonprofessional astronomer" for "past contributions to the study of comets." The first award was made in 1969 to [[Reginald Lawson Waterfield|Reginald L. Waterfield]]. After 1974 the Comet Medal was discontinued.&lt;ref name="ASP history"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9017">The '''BioMedical Admissions Test''' ('''BMAT''') is an [[aptitude test]] used as part of the admissions process for [[Medicine]], [[Biomedical Science]]s and [[Dentistry]] in some [[British universities|universities]] in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Singapore]], [[Spain]], [[Malaysia]], [[Thailand]], [[Hungary]], [[Croatia]] and the [[Netherlands]].

==History==
BMAT was developed by [[Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing]] in response to requests from academics at medical and veterinary schools for an assessment that would enable them to differentiate between applicants who appear equally well qualified and suited to the course, and provide a way of assessing the potential of students who have a range of different qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admissionstesting.org/images/164648-guide-for-educational-institutions-and-policy-makers.pdf |title=Information for educational institutions and policy makers |publisher=Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing |accessdate=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, it was taken up by [[Oxford University]] for [[Medicine]] and [[Physiology]] (replacing the OMAT); the [[University of Cambridge]] for Medicine and [[Veterinary Science]] (replacing the MVAT) and [[University College London]], for Medicine.

From 2011, the new Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine (LKC Medicine) in Singapore, a partnership between [[Imperial College London]] and [[Nanyang Technological University|Nanyang University]], started using BMAT as part of its entry process for Medicine.

Over the past few years, universities introducing BMAT as part of their entry requirements for Medicine courses have included [[Brighton and Sussex Medical School]] (BSMS) (2013), [[Leiden University]] in the Netherlands (2014), the [[University of Leeds]] (2015), the [[University of Navarra]] in Spain (2015), [[Lancaster University]] (2016), the [[University of Malaya]] (2016).

In 2017, a number of institutions in Thailand started using BMAT as entry requirements for Medicine courses, initially starting with the [[Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University]] and [[Chulabhorn International College of Medicine, Thammasat University|Chulabhorn International College of Medicine]] of [[Thammasat University]]. This was followed by the [[Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University]], [[Faculty of Medicine, Srinakharinwirot University]] (Joint Program with [[University of Nottingham]]), [[Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University]], [[Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University]] and [[Faculty of Medicine, King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang]] as part of the first round (entrance by portfolio) of the Thai University Central Admissions System (TCAS) for the 2018 intake, after educational reforms in 2017.

Most recently, for the 2018 intake, CEU Cardenal Herrara University in [[Spain]], the [[University of Pécs]] in [[Hungary]], the [[University of Rijeka]] and the [[University of Zagreb]], both in [[Croatia]], have started using BMAT as an entry requirement to courses such as Medicine and Dentistry

==Format==
BMAT is a 2-hour, pen-and-paper test, which consists of three sections.  The first two sections are both multiple choice questions and the third section is a writing task.

===Section 1: Aptitude and Skills===

This section is designed to test generic skills in problem-solving, understanding arguments, and data analysis and inference. It is made up of 35 questions, with 60 minutes to complete.

===Section 2: Scientific Knowledge and Applications===

This section tests the ability to apply scientific knowledge typically covered in school Science and Mathematics by the age of 16 (for example, [[GCSE]] in the UK and [[IGCSE]] internationally). It is made up of 27 questions, with 30 minutes to complete.

===Section 3: Writing Task===

This section tests the ability to select, develop and organise ideas, and to communicate them in writing, concisely and effectively. Applicants must complete one writing task from a choice of three questions, with 30 minutes to complete.

Calculators and dictionaries, including bilingual dictionaries, cannot be used in the exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admissionstesting.org/our-services/medicine-and-healthcare/bmat/faqs/ |title=Faqs |publisher=Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing |accessdate=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scoring==
For Sections 1 and 2 the total raw marks for each section are converted onto the BMAT 9-point scale. The scores are given to one decimal place. Most candidates typically score around 5.0 (roughly half marks). Some candidates will score around 6.0 and a few exceptional candidates will score higher than 7.0.

For Section 3, candidates get two scores – one for quality of content (on a scale of 0–5, with 5 being the highest) and one for quality of written English (on the scale A, C, E, with A being the highest).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admissionstestingservice.org/Images/47829-bmat-test-specification.pdf |title=BMAT test specification |publisher=Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing |accessdate=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each BMAT essay is marked by two examiners and the two marks are combined to give an overall score ranging from 1E to 5A. An image of the candidate’s Writing Task is supplied to each institution to which the candidate has applied.

==Test sessions and results==
BMAT is normally taken at authorised ‘open centres’ which are located around the world. For the test session that takes place in late October/early November, UK applicants can often take the test in their school or college.

The timing of the test is designed to fit in with the timescales for Medicine applications for the institutions across the world using the test.
Each year, the following test sessions take place: 
 
* BMAT – September
* BMAT – late October/early November
* BMAT – February
 
Typically, for each test session, students must register themselves or be registered for the test, by their school, at least a month in advance. 
 
BMAT results are generally issued 3–4 weeks after the test has taken place, either by a Statement of Results or via the Metritests system.

BMAT results are only valid in the year that the test is taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admissionstesting.org/our-services/medicine-and-healthcare/bmat/dates-and-costs/ |title=Dates and costs &amp;#124; BMAT |publisher=Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing |accessdate=2018-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
BMAT results are used in a variety of ways by the different institutions using it: for example, [[Oxford University]] combines the results with [[GCSE]] grades to decide who is called for interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/courses-listing/medicine?wssl=1 |title=Medicine |publisher=University of Oxford |accessdate=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often it is seen as just part of [[UCAS|the application process]] – previous examination results, a teacher’s reference, the applicant’s personal statement and predicted grades are also important.

==Preparation==
BMAT does not require a lot of extra study as it is designed to test skills and knowledge that candidates are expected to already have.  Practice materials, including the test specification, practice questions, past papers, and an Assumed Subject Knowledge guide for Section 2 are available to candidates for free from the Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing [http://www.admissionstestingservice.org/for-test-takers/bmat/preparing-for-bmat/ website].

There are some companies that help with coaching for the BMAT, however these companies are not endorsed by Cambridge Assessment who administer the test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admissionstesting.org/for-test-takers/bmat/preparing-for-bmat|title=Preparing for BMAT |publisher=Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing |accessdate=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Constance Evelyn Padwick''' (July 2, 1886 – 1968) known as Paddie by her friends was born at the [[Manor House]], [[West Thorney]], [[Sussex]], England and grew up near [[Chichester]], in the English countryside as well as in [[London]]. She was educated at home and then further trained as a teacher. She was known as one of the leading British women missionaries and one of the first women missiologists in the twentieth century who also worked with [[Church Mission Society]] for several years. She lived and worked in Cairo, Egypt and traveled to many different places from Fez to Lahore. In 1947 when conditions were bad because of the war she was asked to leave [[Jerusalem]] and went to [[Kordofan]] in [[Sudan]]. Padwick prepared textbooks for Christian schools for three years and then moved to [[Istanbul]] and then returned to [[England]] in 1957. She spent almost forty years in the Middle East where she developed her knowledge of [[Arabic]] and her knowledge of Mosques and devotees helped her write her best known published book which is the ''Muslim Devotions: A Study of Prayer-Manuals in Common Use.''

==Family==
Padwick's father was a non-practising Barrister who farmed his own land. Her maternal Grandfather was the Reverend [[Thomas Pownall Boultbee]] who set up the [[London College of Divinity]] now [[St John's College, Nottingham]].  At the age of ten Padwick went to [[Finsbury Square]], London where she was taught by her godmother and was also with other children through most of her teen years. This godmother was also the aunt, and governess to many other children of this household. The father of the children of this particular household was James Pratt, who was the grandson of [[Josiah Pratt]], a founder in 1799 of C.M.S. After her teen years in this household in London she went with one of her cousins to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in 1910 for a visit and fell in love with the Middle East. Near the end of her life she then lived with her sister Joy in [[Lower Odcombe]], in [[Somerset]], where she died.

==Education==
Padwick was educated from home and then went out to be trained as a teacher. After her teen years she went briefly to [[Paris]] and then back with her family in Sussex where she started studying the New Testament Greek and became active in the [[World Student Christian Federation|Student Christian Movement]]. She went to the [[University of London]] and studied Arabic, Arab folklore and the understanding of Islam, she also took her teachers training Certificate with distinction and was rewarded by a scholarship to the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]] within the University of London. Padwick also studied Greek and pedagogy and was a student of Oriental studies of the [[American University in Cairo]]. She worked from 1909 to 1916 on the home staff of the Church Mission Society as the editor of children's magazines.

==Educational work==
In 1912 Padwick joined C.M.S and was the editor of children's magazines. Padwick was drawn to the [[Middle East]] through the reading of the biography of [[Douglas M. Thornton]] written by [[William Henry Temple Gairdner|Temple Gairdner]]. She believed literature was a great evangelistic tool. “After looking very carefully at the different positions from which it would now be possible to serve the Moslem world by means of Christian literature, and after much prayer, I have come to the deliberate conclusion that it is as a C.M.S literature missionary, if C.M.S. will have me, that I want the privilege of serving. For both on a general view and on a detailed examination, it seems to me that God calls us now to strengthen the Cairo literature department of C.M.S (CMS 3)”&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[Shelley, Michael T. “Temple Gairdner of Cairo Revisited.” ''Islam and Christian–Muslim Relations'', 10, no. 3 (1999): 261-278.]&lt;/ref&gt; But when she offered to work overseas with C.M.S., she was rejected because of ill health.

Padwick nevertheless worked in [[Cairo]] with the Nile Mission Press until 1921 and then went back to the University of London where she wrote a thesis on Arab Folklore. In 1923 she went back to Cairo, [[Egypt]] under C.M.S. and became the editorial secretary for the Central Committee for Christian Literature for Muslims. She also served in Cairo under C.M.S. till the end of her career for over three decades which included her time in Palestine in 1937. After the war in 1947 she was asked to leave Palestine and go to the [[Nuba Mountains]] in [[Sudan]] where she wrote Arab text books for schools. She then spent three years at [[Jabal Katcha|Katcha]] Kordofan which ended in November 1951 with serious illness at the age of sixty-five. Padwick wrote many different Arabic materials for those people and she ended her time in Sudan in 1951 when she became ill and retired in 1952 from C.M.S. but never really truly retired till 1957 in Dorset, Village Maiden Newton close to the heart of the Hardy country of Wessex. Somewhere in between this time she was first nursed at Omduran hospital and then by friends in [[Kenya]] until she was ready to travel to Istanbul where she spent four quiet years.

==Writings==
Constance E. Padwick is most well known for her writing. While working for Church Mission Society she was an editor of children’s magazines, she was also one the editors of the ''Orient and Occident'' which is a Christian monthly  published in Cairo. She is also known for writing biographies of [[Henry Martyn]], [[Lilias Trotter]] and her colleague [[William Henry Temple Gairdner]]. She also wrote ''Muslim Devotions: A Study of Prayer-Manuals in common use,'' as well as ''Mackay of the great lake,'' ''The Master of the Impossible: Sayings for the Most part in Parable from the Letters and Journals of Lilias Trotter of Algiers'' (1938), and many more. She loved Muslims and writing about them, she developed specific materials for Muslim readers which included biographies about different missionaries who worked among Muslims. Many of her writings have helped youth deal with the stress of modern living and she saw her writings as a form of service in which she conducted with high standards, dedicated research and true objectivity. “Padwick's long career as missionary and missiologist bridges the gap between the female writers and strategists of the women's missionary movement and the contemporary female missiologists and mission strategists.” &lt;ref&gt;[Tucker, Ruth. “Female Mission Strategists: A Historical and Contemporary Perspective.” ''Missiology'', 15, no. 1 (Jan. 1987): 73-89.]&lt;/ref&gt; "All that she wrote, she wrote out of a profound and missionary commitment to Christ as Christianity receives Him." &lt;ref name="Cragg, Kenneth 1969, p 29-39"&gt;[Cragg, Kenneth. “Constance E. Padwick, 1886-1968.” ''Muslim World'', 59, no. 1 (Jan. 1969): 29-39]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was hard for women during Padwick’s time to be missionaries or to receive the respect that women deserved. Padwick wrote in and during a male-missionary-dominated era but she managed to make the transition, and was one of the first women to accomplish this. Her writings were published over a fifty-year period from 1918 to 1967 and her last one was published when she was 81.
Her most well known book ''“Muslim Devotions: A Study of Prayer-Manuals in common use”'' analyzes the religious thought of Islam. According to [[Kenneth Cragg]], her biography of Temple Gairdner was “one of the classics of missionary biography of this century."&lt;ref name="Cragg, Kenneth 1969, p 29-39"/&gt;

==Hobbies==
Padwick had a lifelong joy of external nature and loved flowers. She was accepted as a member by the [[Royal Horticultural Society]] of Great Britain. She also loved going to different little bookstores and searching for little hand held prayer books and pocket manuals to include in her work on Muslim Devotions. She desired to know Islam's inward spirituality and wanted this devotional book to speak to the heart of Muslims. This consumed her for more than twenty years. She gained respect through friends and learned from everyone and this book is now a valuable compendium of Muslim spirituality. "Muslim Devotions, it may be truly said, is a worthy expression of Christian initiative and at the same time a comprehensive index to Muslim liturgy: It is a gesture of imagination inspired by one faith towards the inner genius of another."&lt;ref name="Cragg, Kenneth 1969, p 29-39"/&gt;  "She attained a patient kinship with Muslim norms and themes and made their world her own."  She also stated, "for it is in knowing that we are known."&lt;ref name="Cragg, Kenneth 1969, p 29-39"/&gt;

'''Cynthia Warrick''' is the seventh president of [[Stillman College]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/news/20170424/interim-leader-cynthia-warrick-named-next-permanent-president-of-stillman|title=Interim leader Cynthia Warrick named next permanent president of Stillman|author=Ed Enoch|website=Tuscaloosanews.com|accessdate=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a liberal arts college  in the [[West Tuscaloosa]] area of [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama]]. Before starting a career in higher education, she practiced as a licensed pharmacist. Warrick has two children, Alan Warrick II, a member of the San Antonio City Council,  and Whitney Blair (Warrick) Craig, a federal and state lobbyist.

==  Education and certifications ==
Warrick holds a Bachelor of Science (BS) in Pharmacy in 1975 from [[Howard University]], Washington, D.C. and is a Registered Pharmacist in Texas and Indiana.  She received a Master of Science (MS) in Public Policy in 1994 from the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]], and a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree in Environmental Science and Public Policy from [[George Mason University]], Fairfax, Virginia, in 1999.

== Academic career ==
Warrick was Assistant Professor in the Division of Management, Policy and Community Health at the [[University of Texas]] School of Public Health, Center for Health, Promotion and Prevention Research in [[Houston, Texas]], and then Associate Professor and Director of Environmental and Occupational Health  at [[Florida A&amp;M University]] in [[Tallahassee]], After that, she  served at [[Elizabeth City State University]] in   [[North Carolina]] as Tenured Full Professor of Pharmacy, Dean and Chief Research Officer. .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/news/baton-rouge/index.ssf/2014/06/cynthia_warrick_tapped_as_inte.html|title=Cynthia Warrick tapped as interim president of Grambling State University|website=Nola.com|accessdate=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warrick was then appointed  a Senior Fellow at the [[Howard University]] School of Pharmacy, Center for Minority Health Services Research.

She has also been elected county-wide to the Board of Trustees of the [[Alamo Colleges]] with a budget of $200 million, where she served as Vice-Chair of the Budget and Finance Committee and has helped pass a $85 million capital improvement bond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alamo.edu/district/about-us/|title=Alamo Colleges : District : About The Colleges|website=Alamo.edu|accessdate=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Higher Education Leadership ==
She was selected in 2012 as Interim President for [[South Carolina State University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scsu.edu/news_article.aspx?news_id=1437|title=South Carolina State University|website=Scsu.edu|accessdate=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[historically black university]] in [[Orangeburg, South Carolina]]. In 2014/15, she was appointed   Interim President of [[Grambling State University]] in [[Grambling, Louisiana]], where she brought stability to an institution that was in crisis. However, her management style generated controversy, leading to her decision not to seek the permanent presidency at Grambling. According to Quincy Hodges of ''The Times-Picayune'', she "was able to streamline administrative operations; implemented aggressive student recruitment strategies and establish relationships with local, state, regional and national legislative and governmental representatives to support program and funding initiatives... raising more than $470,000 in donations." These achievements, notwithstanding, the University's Faculty Senate criticized her for "belittling faculty and staff;" for "failing to answer important and urgent questions;" and for taking "significant actions without consulting faculty members." In response, University of Louisiana System President Sandra Woodley issued a statement saying that "These are challenging times for Grambling and all of higher education," and added that " Warrick's leadership has been instrumental in putting the university on a path to success by making the tough decisions needed to affect positive change."

Warrick began her tenure as the Interim President of [[Stillman College]] in January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jbhe.com/2016/12/cynthia-warrick-to-lead-stillman-college-in-alabama/|title=Cynthia Warrick to Lead Stillman College in Alabama|date=19 December 2016|website=Jbhe.com|accessdate=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to being named to this position, she was a Senior Fellow at the [[Thurgood Marshall College Fund]] and also served as President of the Society for Diversity in the Biomedical Sciences, based in [[Houston]], Texas.

'''David E. Blackmer''' (January 11, 1927 – March 21, 2002) was an American audio electronics engineer, most famous as the inventor of the [[DBX (noise reduction)|DBX noise reduction system]] and founder of [[dbx (company)|dbx]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as [[audio noise reduction]], Blackmer worked on extending the frequency response of audio electronics beyond the conventionally accepted audible range of 20&amp;nbsp;kHz. He also published research on the value of ultrasonic frequencies in sound reproduction, claiming that the time resolution of human hearing is 5 microseconds or better—which would correspond to a frequency of 200&amp;nbsp;kHz, requiring audio equipment ideally to have a flat response to that frequency.&lt;ref name="Beyond 20 kHz"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blackmer|first1=David|title=The World Beyond 20&amp;nbsp;kHz|url=http://www.earthworksaudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/The-world-beyond-20kHz.pdf|website=Earthworks Audio|accessdate=1 June 2014|format=pdf|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackmer attended [[High Mowing School]] in [[Wilton, New Hampshire]]. He started in audio at [[Lafayette Radio]] in [[Boston]] in the 1940s and studied [[electronics]] in the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] and at [[Harvard University]] and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]. He later worked at [[Trans-Radio Recording Studio]], [[Epsco]], [[Hi-Con Eastern]] and [[Raytheon Corporation|Raytheon]], where he designed [[telemetry]] systems for the [[mercury program|Mercury space program]]. He founded dbx in 1971, selling it to [[Birmingham Sound Reproducers|BSR]] in 1979 and staying on with the company for several years. In the late 1980s he formed [[Earthworks (corporation)|Earthworks]], producing studio [[microphone]]s, [[preamplifier]]s and studio reference [[Loudspeaker|monitors]]. He also founded [[Kintek]] (now [[Colortek]]) and [[Charles Stark Draper Laboratory|Instrumentation Laboratory]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}, as well as running the [[Cafe Pierrot]] restaurant in Wilton for a time.

Blackmer was a life member of the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] and a fellow of the [[Audio Engineering Society]] from 1976. He was also a great reader of [[science fiction]]. He had ten children.

'''Dean DeBlois''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ə|ˈ|b|l|w|ɑː}}; born June 7, 1970) is a Canadian film director, film producer, screenwriter, and [[animator]]. He is best known for co-writing and co-directing the [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-nominated animated films ''[[Lilo &amp; Stitch]]'' for [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]], the ''[[How to Train Your Dragon (franchise)|How to Train Your Dragon]]'' film trilogy for [[DreamWorks Animation]], and directed the ''[[Sigur Rós]]'' documentary/music film ''[[Heima]]''.

==Early life==
DeBlois was born in Aylmer, Quebec. As a young boy, he was interested in comic books, which later influenced his drawing ability, sense of imagination and story-telling. Growing up poor, he visited on weekends a little smoke shop in a strip mall close to his house, where they let him read everything for free. Memorizing the comics, he went home and drew.&lt;ref name=BeatDeBloisHamilton&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lu|first1=Alexander|title=INTERVIEW: Dean DeBlois and Richard Hamilton Reimagine Berk in "How to Train Your Dragon" GNs|url=http://www.comicsbeat.com/interview-dean-dubois-and-richard-hamilton-reimagine-berk-in-how-to-train-your-dragon-gns/|publisher=The Beat|accessdate=October 22, 2015|date=October 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
DeBlois began his career as an assistant animator and layout artist for Hinton Animation Studios/[[Lacewood Productions]] in Ottawa, Ontario, while simultaneously attending [[Sheridan College]]'s three year Classical Animation program in Oakville, Ontario. From 1988 to 1990, DeBlois contributed to such productions as ''[[The Raccoons]]'' (TV series), ''The Teddy Bears' Picnic'' (TV special), and ''[[The Nutcracker Prince]]'' (feature animated film).

Upon graduation from [[Sheridan College]] in 1990, DeBlois was hired by [[Sullivan Bluth Studios]] in Dublin, Ireland. There, he worked as a layout artist, character designer, and storyboard assistant to [[Don Bluth]] on such feature animated films as ''[[A Troll in Central Park]]'' and ''[[Thumbelina (1994 film)|Thumbelina]]''.

In 1994, DeBlois left Dublin for Los Angeles to begin work for [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]] as a storyboard artist, where he soon replaced his frequent collaborator, [[Chris Sanders (director)|Chris Sanders]], as Head of Story on ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]''. Shortly thereafter, they re-teamed to create ''[[Lilo &amp; Stitch]]''.

Following its release in 2002, DeBlois sold several original live action feature film projects to write, direct, and produce, including an Irish ghost story (''The Banshee and Finn Magee''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dean DeBlois, DreamWorks Animation, Writer / Director / Executive Producer|url=http://www.fmx.de/program2015/speaker/1533|publisher=FMX|accessdate=October 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a psychological thriller (''The Lighthouse''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kit|first1=Borys|title='Lighthouse' turns on Touchstone|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/film/brief_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002199907|accessdate=October 9, 2015|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=March 21, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903063709/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/film/brief_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002199907|archivedate=September 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a family adventure series (''Sightings''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Snyder|first1=Gabriel|title=U sets sights on ‘Sightings’|url=https://variety.com/2006/film/markets-festivals/u-sets-sights-on-sightings-1200338850/|accessdate=October 9, 2015|work=Variety|date=July 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; set-up at [[Walt Disney Pictures]], [[Touchstone Pictures]], and [[Universal Studios]] respectively.

DeBlois' feature length music documentary film ''[[Heima]]'' chronicles the homecoming concert of Iceland's [[Sigur Rós]].

In October 2008, DeBlois returned to feature animation to co-write and co-direct [[DreamWorks Animation]]'s then-troubled ''[[How to Train Your Dragon (film)|How to Train Your Dragon]]'', once again re-teaming with Sanders. The duo re-envisioned the film's story and shepherded the production to its March 2010 release. The resulting film became the studio's top-grossing film in North America outside of the [[Shrek (franchise)|''Shrek'' franchise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DreamWorks Animation|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=dwanimation.htm|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=October 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During that same time, DeBlois also directed another feature-length music film for [[Sigur Rós]] front-man [[Jón Þór Birgisson|Jónsi]], entitled ''[[Go Quiet]]'', as well as a feature length concert film entitled ''Jónsi: Live at The Wiltern''.

DeBlois wrote and directed the [[fantasy film|fantasy]]/[[action film]] ''[[How to Train Your Dragon 2]]'', a sequel to the original, which was released on June 13, 2014.

==Personal life==
DeBlois was born in [[Brockville, Ontario]] and raised in [[Aylmer, Quebec]]. DeBlois is openly gay, and told ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'' that people in the industry "knew that one of us was gay" but mistakenly assumed it was his straight screenwriting partner Chris Sanders, because DeBlois "hobbled in there looking like a redneck."  &lt;ref name="Advocate"&gt;{{cite news|last=Steele|first=Bruce C.|title=Disney dude: Dean DeBlois, the out codirector of Lilo &amp; Stitch, talks about making a cartoon supporting alternative families, including extraterrestrials who do drag.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eGQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA52#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Dean%20DeBlois%22%20out|accessdate=January 9, 2011|newspaper=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]|date=July 9, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; DeBlois has been married since 2014.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The government decided not to process his reply to the showcause notice as he had barely few months left in his tenure and few senior Cabinet ministers pleaded for no action against him in order for him to finish his full term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Akshaya Mukul | title = VC's name dropped from Prez trip | url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/VCs-name-dropped-from-Prez-trip/articleshow/49176265.cms | newspaper = Times of India | date = 1 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

J Khuntiya, chairman, AAD (Rathi) alleged that the delay has been intentional to ensure that Umesh Rai, a member of the team of Dinesh Singh becomes eligible for selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = manash pratim gohain =  | title = Teachers slam varsity's 'mistake' of choosing ex-Isro chief for post| url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Teachers-slam-varsitys-mistake-of-choosing-ex-Isro-chief-for-post/articleshow/49294714.cms | newspaper = Times of India  | date = 10 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the names included by Dinesh Singh in the search committee for the selection of new Vice-Chancellor is Vinod Rai.

DUTA has also recently charged Singh with plagiarism and has sought investigation into these plagiarism charges against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = S.N. | first = Vijetha | date = 10 October 2014 | title = DUTA seeks investigation into plagiarism charges against V-C | url = http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/duta-seeks-investigation-into-plagiarism-charges-against-vc/article6487568.ece | newspaper =  The Hindu }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author  =&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; | title = DU teachers seek probe against VC | url = http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/du-teachers-seek-probe-against-vc/ | newspaper = Indian Express | date = 9 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author =&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; | title = Investigate Plagiarism Charges against DU VC | url =  http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-PTQJ5MgMnRg/VDf3UunNBaI/AAAAAAAADaI/zp7FMS-5aso/s1600/DH_9Oct.jpg | newspaper = Deccan Herald | date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Singh was instrumental in initiating Four Year Undergraduate Program (FYUP) which met with a lot of resistance from different quarters, after which the programme was scrapped as per the directives of the University Grant Commission(UGC) .&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, Singh announced his resignation &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Pratim Gohain | first = Manash | date = 24 June 2014| title = FYUP row: Delhi University VC Dinesh Singh resigns| url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/FYUP-row-Delhi-University-VC-Dinesh-Singh-resigns/articleshow/37118148.cms | newspaper = Times of India }}&lt;/ref&gt; but later retracted it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = S.N. | first = Vijetha | date = 24 June 2014 | title = Confusion over DU VC’s resignation | url = http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/confusion-over-du-vcs-resignation/article6145392.ece| newspaper = The Hindu }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability to read is believed to depend on two skills:

*'''[[Phonological awareness|Phonological processing]]''' skills make up the ability to identify and manipulate sounds in speech.

{{Education in the U.S.}}
'''''Education Week''''' is an independent news organization that has covered [[K–12 (education)|K–12 education]] since 1981. It is known for providing both news and analysis, along with explanatory and investigative journalism across a range of digital, print, and broadcast platforms as well as through live and virtual events. It is owned by Editorial Projects in Education (EPE), a [[nonprofit organization]], whose mission is to raise awareness and understanding of critical issues facing American schools. It is headquartered in [[Bethesda, Maryland]] in [[Greater Washington DC]].

The newspaper publishes 37 issues a year, including three special annual reports (''Quality Counts'', ''Technology Counts'', and ''Leaders to Learn From''). Other in-depth coverage includes regular, deep-dive topical reports on subjects like personalized learning, teacher recruitment, and assessment. 

== History ==
In 1957, Corbin Gwaltney, founder and then editor of ''Johns Hopkins Magazine'' for alumni of [[Johns Hopkins University]], and a group of other university alumni magazine editors came together to discuss writing on higher education and decided to form Editorial Projects for Education (EPE), a [[nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] educational organization. Soon after, Gwaltney left Johns Hopkins Magazine to become the first full-time employee of the newly created EPE, starting in an office in his apartment in [[Baltimore]] and later moving to an office near the Johns Hopkins campus.&lt;ref name="BALDWINPL1995"&gt;{{cite book | last =Baldwin| first =Patricia L.| title =Covering the Campus: The History of the Chronicle of Higher Education, 1966-1993| publisher =University of North Texas Press| date =1995| location =Denton, Texas| pages =167| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=aNwjHVzwyjwC&amp;printsec=frontcover| isbn =0-929398-96-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He realized that higher education would benefit from a news publication.&lt;ref name="DEPASQUALE042000" /&gt; Gwaltney and other board members of EPE met to plan a new publication. In 1966, EPE published the first issue of ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]''.&lt;ref name="DEPASQUALE042000"&gt;{{cite journal| last=De Pasquale| first=Sue| title=A Model of Lively Thought| journal=Johns Hopkins Magazine| publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University]]| date=April 2000| url=http://www.jhu.edu/~jhumag/0400web/corbin.html| accessdate=March 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Viadero, Debra, [http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2006/09/06/02edweek-s2.h26.html Education Week: "A Media Organization With Many Faces"].

In 1978, EPE sold ''Chronicle'' to its editors and shifted its attention. With the support of several philanthropies, and using the successful model of ''Chronicle'', EPE went on to launch ''Education Week'' under the leadership of Ronald A. Wolk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/ronald-wolk-whose-education-week-put-national-spotlight-on-schools-dies-at-86/2018/05/02/7f2f5538-4e04-11e8-b725-92c89fe3ca4c_story.html|title=Ronald Wolk, whose Education Week put national spotlight on schools, dies at 86|last=Anderson|first=Nick|date=2018-05-02|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first issue of ''Education Week'' appeared on Sept. 7, 1981, and sought to provide ''Chronicle''-like coverage of elementary and secondary education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In August of 1981, EPE officially changed the name to Editorial Projects in Education.

''Education Week'' gained an online presence in 1996 with the website edweek.org, which features breaking news, interactive digital features and a host of news and opinion blogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Mission and History | publisher =Editorial Projects in Education | url =http://www.edweek.org/info/about/history.html | accessdate =May 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The center conducts a range of original research each year for that report, as well as ''Diplomas Count'' (discontinued in 2016), ''Education Week'', edweek.org, and outside clients.

== Annual reports ==

=== ''Quality Counts'' ===
In 1997, ''Education Week'' launched ''Quality Counts''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edweek.org/ew/qc/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;, an annual report that uses in-depth journalism and research to investigate important issues in education policy. The report also includes an annual report card on public education in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. From 1997 to 2010, ''Quality Counts'' was sponsored by the Pew Center on the States.&lt;ref name="Research Center Projects"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/dc/index.html|title=Diplomas Count|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Editorial Projects in Education|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=December 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to grading the states based on 3 categories: Chance for Success, the K-12 Achievement, and School Finance, each edition of the report has examined a topic of central concern to education policymakers and practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title =Quality Counts Introduces New State Report Card; U.S. Earns C, and Massachusetts Ranks First in Nation | publisher =Education Week Research Center| date =January 8, 2015| url =http://www.edweek.org/media/qualitycounts2015_release.pdf| accessdate =May 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its themes have included: state efforts in early-childhood education; ensuring a highly qualified teacher for every classroom; school finance; and the role of state standards, assessments, and accountability in education.

=== ''Technology Counts'' ===
''Technology Counts'', launched in 1997 and released annually, focuses on top issues related to technology and schools.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edweek.org/ew/tc/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Previous reports have explored digital content or curriculum, e-learning, and the impact of technology on assessment, among other topics.

=== ''Diplomas Count'' ===
In 2006, EPE launched ''Diplomas Count'', its annual report on high school graduation policies and rates&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edweek.org/ew/dc/&lt;/ref&gt;. The report included graduation rates and patterns for the 50 states and the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]. The report included downloadable highlights reports on each state. Diplomas Count ended in 2016.&lt;ref name="Research Center Projects"/&gt;

=== ''Leaders to Learn From'' ===
Starting in 2013, ''Education Week'' has honored innovative school district leaders through the Leaders to Learn From report&lt;ref&gt;https://leaders.edweek.org&lt;/ref&gt;. Featured leaders include [[superintendent (education)|superintendents]], community engagement officers, nutrition services directors, [[curriculum]] specialists and directors of [[school nursing|nursing]].

The '''Estonian National Defence College''' (ENDC; [[Estonian language|Estonian]]: '''''Kaitseväe Ühendatud Õppeasutused''''') is an institution of applied higher education for national defence in [[Tartu]], [[Estonia]].

ENDC mission is to train and educate regular officers for the [[Military of Estonia|Estonian Defense Forces]] and National Defence League, as well as for other military institutions. The ENDC has established in Estonia a national reputation for expertise in military research and development.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The academic program of ENDC provides a balanced education in military and civilian subjects. The academic staff members of the ENDC are supported by members of the academic community from universities throughout Estonia.

== Officer training ==
* '''Basic Officer Training Course''' is the first level programme with a three-year study period carried out in the Estonian National Defense College. In the course, the cadets acquire the skills of a [[platoon leader]] and [[company commander]]. On completion of the course, the cadets will have applied higher education and the rank of a second lieutenant.
* '''Advanced Officer Training Course''' is the second level of officer training with a two-year study period, whereby the students acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to perform the duties of junior staff officers of an infantry [[battalion]] or [[brigade]].
* '''Senior Staff Officer Course''' &amp;mdash; the third level of officer training &amp;mdash; is a one-year course conducted in cooperation with the [[Baltic Defence College]] in the same building with the ENDC (or relevant training in some educational institution abroad).
* '''Higher Staff Officer Course''', the fourth level of officer training, is conducted in higher staff officer courses and general staff officer courses in educational institutions abroad.

The Estonian National Defence College offers the first level and, since the 2005/2006 study year, the second level of military higher education.

The '''Federico Santa María Technical University''' ({{lang-es|Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María}}) ('''UTFSM''') (or simply '''Santa Maria University''') is a [[Chile]]an [[university]] founded in 1926 in [[Valparaíso]], [[Chile]].

It is one of the most prestigious engineering universities in the country and Latin America, and gives special emphasis to basic sciences, engineering and technical fields&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usm.cl/admision/carreras/&lt;/ref&gt; with a more recent growth into economics and business sciences.&lt;ref&gt;http://rankings.americaeconomia.com/mba2014/ranking-mba-latino-2014/&lt;/ref&gt; The University has campuses in Valparaiso, Viña del Mar, Santiago, Concepción and Rancagua, as well as an international campus in Guayaquil, Ecuador. The Federico Santa María Technical University is the [[alma mater]] of several prominent businessmen, engineers and Chilean scientists. Its students and alumni are known as "Sansanos".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://diccionariochileno.cl/term/sansano|title=Diccionario Chileno  / Definiciones de "sansano"|website=diccionariochileno.cl|language=es-CL|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UTFSM was the first Chilean university to confer a [[doctorate]] in engineering in 1962 and the first higher-education institution in [[Latin America]] to confer this degree.&lt;ref name="bib.utfsm.cl"&gt;http://www.bib.utfsm.cl/nuevositio/attachments/087_80%20a%C3%B1os%20de%20universidad.pdf Reseña Histórica&amp;nbsp;– Biblioteca UTFSM&lt;/ref&gt; The UTFSM university radio is the oldest [[campus radio]] in [[Latin America]].

The university admission is very competitive and, it is known for its rigorous study requirements, demanding study program, and for being the only engineering university in Chile to require physical training as a compulsory part of the curriculum in its Valparaiso and Santiago Campuses. For the years 2011-2016, the UTFSM has an undergraduate [[retention rate]] of 81.0% by the first year of studies, and a 66.4% by the second year.&lt;ref name="mifuturo.cl"&gt;http://www.mifuturo.cl/index.php/donde-y-que-estudiar/buscador-de-instituciones?cmbtipos=3&amp;cmbnombres=88&lt;/ref&gt; Less than 1% of its students are international, and most of the available courses are imparted in [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

The UTFSM has been historically perceived as one of the most prestigious engineering schools in the country and more recently, with the appearance of national and international rankings, has been placed among the top Universities in Chile and South America.&lt;ref name="timeshighereducation.co.uk"&gt;=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2014-15/world-ranking/region/south-america&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;="http://www.quepasa.cl/articulo/ojos-de-la-llave/2014/12/17-15854-9-ranking-de-universidades-2014.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;It is ranked 1st in Chile and 2nd in South America by The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2014-2015.&lt;ref name="timeshighereducation.co.uk"/&gt;

The graduation date is held on the 20th of December every year, since it commemorates the anniversary of the death of the founder, [[Federico Santa María|Federico Santa Maria Carrera]], on the 20th of December 1925.

== History ==
[[Image:Utfsm.jpg|thumbnail|345x345px|University frontis|left]]
The university takes its name from [[Federico Santa María]], a Chilean philanthropist that lived in [[France]]. He raised a huge fortune as a broker in the sugar market in Paris. Before his death, he donated all his fortune to create a university in [[Valparaíso]], his hometown. Although the amount of his fortune is unknown, it is believed to have been around 2 billion dollars of today's [[currency]]. While in Paris in 1920, in his testament, [[Federico Santa María|Santa María]] donated his fortune with the idea of building a high-standard technical and scientific institution.

In his will, [[Federico Santa María|Santa María]] manifested that his desired executors contribute to material progress and expand Chile's cultural horizons; altruistic ideas which sought to facilitate entry into the academic life of outstanding compatriots dispossessed but without further requirement than merit, skills and high academic achievement. This institution would accept and prepare the best students from all socioeconomic backgrounds to gain technical and scientific knowledge that contribute to the progress of the country.

The executors were chosen by Santa María to be [[Agustín Edwards Mac-Clure|Agustin Edwards Mac-Clure]], Juan Brown Caces, Carlos van Buren and Andrew Geddes.

Following his philosophy, on March 31, 1926, an institution was created to develop Santa María's legacy. Finally in 1931 the School of Crafts and Arts and School of Engineering José Miguel Carrera was founded. In 1935, its name changed to '''Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María'''.

The condition imposed by [[Federico Santa María]] was that, during the first 10 years, the university must receive academics from the best schools of sciences and engineering. Following this imperative, the executor of this project, [[Agustín Edwards Mac-Clure]], moved to [[Germany]] where he contacted [[Dr. Karl Laudien|Karl Laudien]], who became the first rector of the university. From that moment, the university received a strong German influence in its engineering education. Several German engineers and scientists arrived before and after the second world war from institutions such as [[Technical University of Berlin|TU Berlin]], [[Berlin University]], [[Leipzig University]] among other German institutions. They brought to the University cutting edge knowledge in physics, chemistry and engineering. For example, Arnold Keller was involved in the development of the V-1 rockets during the second world war, as part of the team of Wernher von Braun.&lt;ref&gt;http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1985/02/17/038.html&lt;/ref&gt; Research in new areas to the country such as [[Solar energy|Solar Energy]], or Chemistry of Natural Products (National Sciences Prize 1971 and 1998) were created.

In 1934, the Scientia magazine is published, becoming the voice if the university academic work.&lt;ref name="www.ilogica.cl"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.usm.cl/vida-universitaria/radio/#|title=Radio - Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María|last=www.ilogica.cl|first=Ilógica -|website=Radio - Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María|language=es-ES|access-date=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, the Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria Radio was created, becoming the first university radio broadcaster in Chile and Latin America,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radio.utfsm.cl/&lt;/ref&gt; focused to broadcasting information and cultural programs. The radio still broadcasts to this day, in the AM: 1.450 and FM: 99,7 signals in the Valparaiso region. The radio also has an online signal.&lt;ref&gt;for more information visit the webpage of the radio http://www.utfsm.cl/vida-universitaria/radio/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, the Alumni association was founded, known today as AEXA (Asociación de Ex-Alumnos).&lt;ref name="utfsm.cl"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utfsm.cl/universidad/historia/ |title= Nuestra historia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, the Graduate School was created, and its first director was Herbert Appel (1960-1964), offering the PhD study lines for chemical, electrical and mechanical engineering. In 1963 the university became the first higher-education institution in [[Latin America]] to confer a doctorate in engineering, in cooperation with the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. In the 1960s the University started a strategy of national and international expansion. In 1966 the Technical campus "[[Viña del Mar]]" was founded. In 1972 the campus "Rey Balduino de Bélgica" in the southeast city of [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]] with orientation in technical-professional areas was founded. The project received strong financial support from [[Baudouin of Belgium|Baudouin King]].

In 1964, the university grants for the first time a technical degree to a woman, the chemical technician Patricia Guzman. In 1965 Graciela Muñoz graduates as its first female engineer.&lt;ref name="utfsm.cl"/&gt;

The UTFSM was the first university of the 8 existing universities in Chile at the time to restart its operations on 15 October 1973, after the Military coup of 11 September 1973.

==Campuses==
The university has four campuses and two branch campuses (''sedes''). These are in four Chilean cities and [[Guayaquil, Ecuador]]:

#Casa Central, main campus. Inaugurated in 1931 in [[Valparaíso]]
#Campus Santiago Vitacura and Campus Santiago San Joaquín, in the capital, [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]].
#Campus Guayaquil, located in [[Guayaquil, Ecuador]].
#Sede [[José Miguel Carrera]], located in [[Viña del Mar, Chile|Viña del Mar]].
#Sede [[Baudouin of Belgium|Rey Balduino de Bélgica]], in the seaport city of [[Talcahuano, Chile|Talcahuano]].

While the campuses are focused on undergraduate, graduate and university academical activities, ''sedes'' are mainly dedicated to technical degrees.

===Main campus, Valparaíso===
The main UTFSM campus (or ''Casa Central'') is located in [[Valparaíso]], covering most of the front area of Los Placeres hill, on the grounds of the former Pudeto fort. The site faces the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast and it is visible from many parts of the bay of [[Valparaíso]].
[[File:Valparaíso (Chile), Universidad Técnica Santamaria, 1949.JPG|thumb|450x450px|Main Campus in Valparaíso, 1949]]
The building was designed by Josué Smith Solar, one of the most respected Chilean architects of the 20th century, and his son José Smith Miller. The American [[Neo-Gothic]] style campus is considered one of the foremost works of Chilean architecture. The campus is also recognised for its beautiful [[gardening]], with native and exotic species.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

In 2001, the illumination of the university frontis was renewed through a contest organised by the Chilean branch of [[Philips]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

The main campus has a gothic scholastic architecture with a privileged view to the Pacific Ocean. In 2008 it was chosen as one of the most remarkable national architectural works of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dgc.usm.cl/2008/12/29/casa-central-elegida-una-de-las-grandes-construcciones-del-siglo-xx/ Casa Central elegida una de las grandes construcciones del Siglo XX&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Branch campus Viña del Mar, "José Miguel Carrera" ===
In the 1960s, the University formulated an expansion plan. With financial assistance from the [[Inter-American Development Bank|Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)]], the support of the [[Ford Foundation]], advice from [[Dunwoody College of Technology|Dunwoody Industrial Institute]] in the US, and a donation of land by Chile's Agricultural Development Institute INDAP (from the Spanish "Instituto de Desarrollo Agropecuario"), a fully furnished building was constructed in 1971 in [[Viña del Mar]], and it was named the "Jose Miguel Carrera" branch campus, following the testamentary vision of the University founder, the philanthropist [[Federico Santa María]].

This branch is located on the border between the communes of [[Viña del Mar|Vina del Mar]] and [[Quilpué]] in [[Chile]].

=== Branch campus Concepción, "Rey Baduino de Belgica" ===
By the mid-1960s, the University planned to install six schools in different parts of the country.

In October 1965, the Kings of Belgium, [[Baudouin of Belgium|Baudouin I]] and [[Fabiola of Belgium|Fabiola de Mora y Aragon]] visited the University headquarters in [[Valparaíso]], were introduced to its educational project and as a result initiated conversations for the construction of a branch campus in the city of [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción.]]

Meanwhile, our country strengthens their contributions: the government facilitates the exchange of funds provided by [[Belgium]]; local businesses such as the San Pedro Sawmills, Cementos Bio Bio, Pacific Steel Company, Fanaloza, Inchalam, Pizarreño, Glasses Lirquén, among others, also contributed in its construction. Additionally, a donation of Archbishop of Concepción provided the land needed for the building construction. Its construction began in 1969.

Academic activities started on April 26, 1971, offering the careers of Electronics, Electrical, Structural Mechanics, Maintenance Mechanics, and Chemistry. On February 14, 1972, the campus branch was inaugurated solemnly in the presence of the [[President of Chile]], [[Salvador Allende|Salvador Allende Gossens]], and the University rector, [[Jaime Chiang Acosta]].

=== Rector ===
The current [[Rector (academia)|rector]] is Professor Darcy Fuenzalida O'Shee, for the Period 2014 - 2018. Some notable events:
* Two rectors died at the time of having the role, i.e., Armando Quezada in 1936, and Commander Juan Naylor in 1977. They were replaced by Interim Rectors until a new rector was chosen through a vote.
* Two rectors have had to resign due to [[Protests of 1968|protests]] within the University,i.e., Carlos Cerutti in 1968, and Giovanni Pesce in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Book: el negocio de las Universidades en Chile,Monckeberg, Maria Olivia, 2011, p.302: https://archive.org/stream/ElNegocioDeLasUniversidadesEnChile4de4/ElNegocioDeLasUniversidadesEnChile2de4#page/n101/mode/2up&lt;/ref&gt;
* Three "delegate" rectors were designated by a [[Military dictatorship|military junta]]. During the Military regime of [[Augusto Pinochet]] (1973-1990) the university rector was designated by the [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|military junta]] instead of a normal voting process. Three "delegate rectors", retired military men, had this role during the period: Commanader Juan Naylor (1973-1977), Vice-admiral Ismael Huerta (1977-1985) and Commander Arturo Niño de Zepeda (1985-1989).
* Two of the rectors were siblings, i.e., Jaime Chiang Acosta (1968-1972), and Gustavo Chiang Acosta (1989-1993).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mercuriovalpo.cl/prontus4_noticias/site/artic/20070520/pags/20070520033316.html|title=La historia de la familia Chiang: Fructífera paciencia|website=www.mercuriovalpo.cl|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Jaime Chiang Acosta (1969-1972) was the first rector chosen through a voting process in the university community.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Jaime Chiang Acosta (1969-1972) was the first rector that was also a UTFSM alumnus, a [[Chemical engineering|Civil Chemical Engineering]] graduate (1952) with a PhD from the [[University of Louisiana System|University of Louisiana]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Gustavo Chiang Acosta (1989-1993), a UTFSM [[Mechanical engineering|civil mechanical engineer]] graduated in 1949, was also the first rector chosen by popular vote of the university community after the end of the [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–90)|Pinochet military regime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.noticias.usm.cl/2013/02/26/homenaje-a-ex-rector-gustavo-chiang-acosta-q-e-p-d/|title=Homenaje a ex Rector Gustavo Chiang Acosta (Q.E.P.D.) · USM Noticias · Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María|last=www.ilogica.cl|first=Ilógica -|website=Homenaje a ex Rector Gustavo Chiang Acosta (Q.E.P.D.) · USM Noticias · Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María|language=es-ES|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Academic departments ===
Due to the focused nature of the university, its organisation currently does not include different [[faculty (division)|faculties]], only different academic departments, which carry out research and graduate/undergraduate educational programs. Originally, faculties had been considered in the University organization, with the founding of the first three faculties in 1944, Chemical, Mechanical and Electrical Engineering. Faculties were subsequently abolished under Adolfo Arata's period as rector.

=== Mechanical Engineering ===

The Mechanical Engineering School at UTFSM was founded together with the foundation of the School of Engineers in 1935, being one of the oldest degrees offered by the university. Its first four mechanical engineers graduated in 1939. The mechanical engineering department was also among the first to offer a PhD program in 1964 (along with Chemical and Electrical Engineering Departments).

The mechanical engineering department has the following research areas:
* [[Thermodynamics]]
* Energy and [[Renewable energy|Renewable energies]]
* [[Process engineering]]
The department has 20 full-time professors (2016 data), 17 with PhD degrees (85%). Additional to the [[Bachelor of Science]]s in mechanical engineering (BSc.), the department offers the graduate programs of [[Master of Science]] (BSc.) and [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD) in mechanical engineering. The department has also made substantive efforts to connect with its alumni. [http://exmec.usm.cl/index.php/titulados A comprehensive list of the graduates of the department can be found online].

=== Graduate School ===
The UTFSM graduate school started its activities on the 1st of August, 1960, as a response to the increasing requirements for deeper and applied research in the country. The project was directed by Leroy Stutzman of the [[University of Pittsburgh]], and doctors G.R. Fitterer and John F. Calver, who audited study programs and teaching methods for the project. The first director of the UTFSM graduate school was Herbert Appel, during the period 1960-1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sansanos.us/pictures/Profesores/HerbertAppel.html|title=Herbert Appel|website=sansanos.us|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school initially offered PhD study lines in chemical, electrical and mechanical engineering. The first UTFSM PhD graduate was Walter Gaete Castro, with a PhD degree in chemical engineering, becoming the first PhD graduate in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ghisolfo|first1=Francisco|title=1993-2001: Años de Oro de la Universidad Santa María|date=2009|publisher=Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso|location=Valparaíso|isbn=978-9561704565}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

The Federico Santa Maria University radio was created on the 7th of April, 1937, and it is the oldest university radio in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.usm.cl/vida-universitaria/radio/|title=Radio - Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María|last=www.ilogica.cl|first=Ilógica -|website=Radio - Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María|language=es-ES|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be heard on 1450&amp;nbsp;kHz in the [[AM broadcasting|AM]] spectrum, on 99.7&amp;nbsp;MHz in the [[FM broadcasting|FM]] spectrum, and online.&lt;ref name="www.ilogica.cl"/&gt;

=== University Chamber Choir ===
The [[Chamber choir|Chamber Choir]] of the Federico Santa María Technical University was founded on August 4, 1951 in its Valparaiso Campus. During the choir's over 60 years of existence, it has interpreted an extensive repertoire, including all manifestations of choral western music, from the Middle Ages to the present day. The choir's first performance was at the closing ceremony of the academic year in December 1951, in the Aula Magna, main hall of events in the "A" building of the University's Main [[Valparaíso]] campus.

Demosthenes Penna, engineering student of this campus, was its founder and first director until 1954. From March 1955, the choir was directed by Silvio Olate for over 28 years until March 1983. From 1983 to 1987, it was directed by Mauricio Pergelier. For the next 23 years, from 1987 to 2010, the choir was conducted by Eduardo Silva Cerda. From 2010, the choir has been conducted by Felipe Molina.

The Guayaquil campus in Ecuador also has formed a Choir in 2015, directed by Charles Sampertegui.

'''Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von Erdmannsdorff''' (18 May 1736 &amp;ndash; 9 March 1800) was a [[Germany|German]] [[architect]] and [[architectural theoretician]], and one of the most significant representatives of early German [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassicism]] during the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. His work included Wörlitz Palace in the present-day [[Dessau-Wörlitz Garden Realm]], one of the earliest [[Palladian architecture|Palladian]] buildings on the European continent. His most well-known student was [[Friedrich Gilly]], the teacher of [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]].

==Life==
Erdmannsdorff was born in [[Dresden]] to the [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxon]] courtier, Baron Ernst Ferdinand von Erdmannsdorff, and his wife Henriette Margarethe, née von Heßler.
[[File:LeopoldIIILisiewsky.jpg|thumb|left|Prince Franz von Anhalt-Dessau, portrait by [[Christoph Friedrich Reinhold Lisiewski]] (1762)]]
After early stages of education with [[Jakob Mauvillon]] in [[Leipzig]] and at the Dresden [[knight academy]] from 1750 to 1754, Erdmannsdorff attended the [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg|University of Wittenberg]] in 1754–1758, where he encountered Prince [[Leopold III, Duke of Anhalt-Dessau|Franz von Anhalt-Dessau]], whose service he entered in 1758. His later fame is due his works for the prince in his [[Wörlitz]] pleasureground near the [[Dessau]] residence. At the age of twenty three Erdmannsdorff become a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] and was initiated at the illustrious ''Minerva Zu Den Drei Palmen'' (Minerva to the three palm trees) lodge on 23 August 1759.

In accordance with the educational ideals of the Enlightenment, the prince had the aim of reorganising his surrounding lands into a cohesive 'Garden Realm' (''Gartenreich'') in the style of an [[English landscape garden]]. In addition to the beautification of the landscape, cottages of various architectural styles, antique temples, bridges and memorials were to be erected and to be made accessible to everyone. Franz employed his friend and architect Erdmannsdorff to design the architectural arrangement of the grounds.

Between 1761 and 1775 on several [[grand tour]]s to Italy, Holland, England, France and Switzerland, Erdmannsdorff gathered ideas for the architectural arrangement of the Wörlitz grounds. Accompanying the Prince, he got to know the style of the Scottish architects [[Robert Adam|Robert]] and [[James Adam (architect)|James Adam]] (the ''Adams Style''). At the same time he was impressed by the architect [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chambers]]. In [[Rome]] Erdmannsdorff made the acquaintance of the archaeologist [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] and the painter [[Charles Louis Clérisseau]], and contacted the master builder [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi]] and painter [[Jakob Philipp Hackert]].

The contemporary art and culture of England made a particular impression on Erdmannsdorff as well as Prince Franz. The Palladian architecture in England, inspired by the [[Palladian villas of Veneto|Palladian Villas]] of the 16th century, can be seen replicated in Erdmannsdorff's later creations and was the strongest influence on his work next to the architecture and interior design of ancient Rome. In this artistic context he designed, amongst others, Wörlitz Palace, built from 1769 to 1773 for Prince Franz and his consort [[Margravine Louise of Brandenburg-Schwedt|Louise of Brandenburg-Schwedt]].

Although Erdmannsdorff favoured this particular architectural style, he also created buildings in the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Neo-Gothic]] style preferred by Prince Franz. Among others, he converted the influences he had received on his trip to England into the building of the ''Gothic House'' in the Wörlitz Grounds.

During his time in Anhalt-Dessau, Erdmannsdorff married Wilhelmine von Ahlimb in 1781, with whom he had two daughters.

In 1786 King [[Frederick William II of Prussia]] called on his services to redecorate the bedroom and study of his predecessor, [[Frederick the Great]], in [[Sanssouci]] Palace in [[Potsdam]], as well a number of rooms in the [[Berliner Stadtschloss]] (Berlin City Palace). Consequently, the first consistently classical interior of the Potsdam and Berlin palaces was built to Erdmannsdorff's specifications. During his stay in Berlin and Potsdam which lasted until 1789, he became an honorary member of the '[[Prussian Academy of Arts|Royal Academy of Arts and Mechanical Sciences]]' in Berlin. Apart from this work he was above all active as a consultant in the areas of art, culture and education in Brandenburg.

Between 1789 and 1790, Erdmannsdorff stayed again in Italy. In Rome he made the acquaintance of the painters [[Angelica Kauffman]] and [[Jakob Phillipp Hackert]], as well as the sculptors [[Alexander Trippel]], [[Antonio Canova]] and [[Bartolomeo Cavaceppi]]. After a trip to [[Weimar]] in 1791 with Prince Franz, he visited the courts of [[Gotha (town)|Gotha]], [[Kassel]] and [[Karlsruhe]]. In 1796 he took over the artistic direction of the ''Chalkographische Gesellschaft'' in Dessau, founded in 1795, whose goal was to popularise artistic works through etchings. At this time he also worked as a lecturer at the Berlin School of Architecture, where he taught [[Friedrich Gilly]] among others.

Erdmannsdorff died in Dessau at the age of 64. His grave can be found at the New Graveyard (''Neuer Begräbnisplatz'', today known as Historical Cemetery I) in Dessau.

The study of [[real estate development]] at the '''graduate school''' level has taken many forms, giving rise to various educational models in different countries. The decision for individuals pursuing higher education in this field often comes down to choosing between a traditional degree with a focus on [[real estate]] (e.g., [[MBA]] with concentration in real estate) or an interdisciplinary, comprehensive degree (e.g., [[Master of Real Estate Development]]) focused wholly on real estate studies.

Students who opt to study in a full-time Master of Real Estate program, should expect to take courses in topics such as financial analysis, market analysis, contracts and deal-making, construction, design fundamentals,  asset (property) management, construction management, building technology and design fundamentals.  Some programs offer studio, capstone, or workshop courses in which students engage actual real estate development projects. Some also provide access to internships. There is no established accreditation system in the United States in real estate development education, so students should investigate offerings in each program.

While there are many real estate ''finance'' programs available to students around the country, there are only a handful of real estate '''''development''''' graduate programs that tackle the broader educational task of engaging the full range of '''real estate development''' (e.g., Master of Real Estate Development) --from property acquisition to planning and permitting, law and finance, design and construction, and culminating in marketing, commercial leasing, property, portfolio and asset management.

==History==
Historically, graduate level coursework in real estate was limited to a major or minor in business, or training in architecture and urban planning schools. While [[Business school]] programs might emphasize the business side of real estate, MBA students typically lack adequate understanding of real estate principles and processes. Over the last several decades, the real estate industry has matured to one with great complexity and an increasingly institutional ownership structure. The increased complexity of the industry created a demand for practitioners who possessed a comprehensive knowledge of real estate beyond that of traditional MBA generalists. One and two-year graduate level real estate degree programs originated with the founding of the [[New York University]] Real Estate Institute in (1967)&lt;ref name="History and Mission of NYU Schack "&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.scps.nyu.edu/academics/departments/schack/about/history.html| title= History and Mission | publisher= New York University | accessdate=2014-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (now known as the NYU Schack Institute of Real Estate) and in 1983 with the formation of the [[MIT]] [http://mitcre.mit.edu/ Center for Real Estate]. Soon after, other schools followed with [[Harvard University]] (1983) [[Texas A&amp;M University]] (1984), [[Columbia University]] (1985), the [[University of Southern California]] (1986), [[Johns Hopkins University]] (1989), and [[Cornell University]] (1996) all forming professional graduate programs focused solely on real estate education.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

According to the [[Urban Land Institute]], during the mid-1990s strong academic interest in real estate "was never greater, whether for repositioning products, redeveloping inner cities, or developing more affordable housing. Students seemed to be acting on the notion that it's a temporary downturn and graduate school is a good place for the moment."&lt;ref&gt;Urban Land, Teaching Real Estate Today, April 1992, pg. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;  As enrollment grew, real estate programs responded by adding more course offerings to satisfy the demand..{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In the early 2000s, prior to the [[Great Recession]], the industry again acknowledged increasing need for graduates with superior qualifications — providing the research-based expertise necessary to solve complex problems in contemporary real estate development..{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

The late 2000s saw significant expansion of real estate programs to second-tier universities such as [[George Mason University]], as well as additional coursework added by [[MBA]] programs that commonly did not have an emphasis on real estate. To deal with the complexity of the field and its far-reaching effects, today's industry professionals require advanced training to prepare them to operate in increasingly technical and interrelated areas..{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

As education needs have changed, business schools such as the [[University of Wisconsin]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], and [[University of California, Berkeley]] continue to cater to students interested in the flexibility of an MBA. Wharton's real estate program, for example, takes advantage of being housed in one of the top business schools in the United States and having some of the top real estate professionals in the world as advisers.&lt;ref&gt;Urban Land, October 1991, pg. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

==Graduate-level education rankings in the US==
Rankings for graduate level education are not specifically formal as other professional disciplines. [[MBA]] programs with concentrations in real estate may be ranked according to organizations such as ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' or ''[[Business Week]]'', but are not relative to the depth of the real estate industry studied in an MBA concentration compared with a specialized master's degree in real estate or real estate development. Real estate education has increased in recent years to fill the demand for well-educated practitioners in the industry. However, there has been a great deal of debate on what elements should be an essential part of a graduate program in order to help students succeed in the industry. Rankings have been conducted by editorial board representation of faculty members at university real estate departments, however, these results prove to be ineffective in judging the program as a whole. Many graduate programs utilize adjunct professors or guest speakers from the industry, which do not sit on editorial boards of scholarly real estate journals.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Currently there are no rankings of graduate degree programs in real estate development. The best method to evaluate the various degree programs is through due diligence by individual applicants, including a review of each program's curriculum and how it applies to the students academic and career goals. While there are no formal rankings for graduate real estate education, and programs are subject to greater locational impact factors than are MBA programs (due to regional and local policy influence).{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===ULI Hines Student Competition===

A separate metric to evaluate the success of graduate real estate programs is the review of past winners in the [[Urban Land Institute]] [[Gerald D. Hines]] Student Competition. The Urban Land Institute is a non-profit research and education organization with membership by real estate developers, urban planners, architects and allied professionals. Each year graduate-level students form their own multidisciplinary teams (from real estate, urban planning and business schools) and have two weeks to devise a comprehensive design and development program for a real, large-scale site full of challenges and opportunities. Submissions will consist of boards that include drawings, site plans, tables, and a myriad of market-feasible financial data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uli.org/programs/awards-competitions/hines-student-design-competition/about-the-competition/ |title=Gerald D. Hines Student Urban Design Competition &amp;#124; Urban Land Institute |publisher=Udcompetition.org |date=2013-10-11 |accessdate=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multidisciplinary teams are not limited to including students from [[real estate development]] graduate programs. Students may also come from [[Master of Landscape Architecture]], [[Master of Architecture]], [[Master of Urban Planning]], [[Master of Urban Design]] or [[MBA]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===ARGUS Software University Challenge===
An additional measure of the reputations of graduate real estate programs is the ARGUS Software University Challenge, which has been held in 2009, 2011 and every year thereafter. In the challenge, participating teams from universities around the world are required to simulate a comprehensive real-life development analysis of a fictitious [[commercial real estate]] project by modeling the provided assumptions specifically using ARGUS software. Team submissions are judged by a panel of industry and academic professionals. The winning teams receive cash prizes.

===Kellogg Real Estate Venture Competition===

The Kellogg Real Estate Conference and Venture Competition is hosted by the Guthrie Center for Real Estate Research and the Kellogg Innovation and Entrepreneurship Initiative.  The Conference will provide industry and research updates and relevant market information.  The Venture Competition showcases MBA students, who have the opportunity to pitch to a high-profile panel of judges. The winning team not only receives $100,000 in cash and prizes, but also the opportunity to secure as much as $10,000,000 in equity funding. The primary purpose of the competition is to encourage entrepreneurial real estate ventures. The event also serves as an opportunity to promote top student talent before prominent industry professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/departments/real-estate/events-activities/real-estate-venture-competition/previous.aspx/|title=Previous Competitions - Kellogg School of Management - Northwestern University|website=www.kellogg.northwestern.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National Real Estate Challenge ===
The National Real Estate Challenge, a 20 team invitation-only real estate case competition hosted annually by the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas at Austin, is yet another metric to compare graduate real estate programs. The competition tests teams from universities across the United States on issues regarding real estate finance and private equity. The event is sponsored by firms such as [[JP Morgan]], [[Equity Office Properties]], and Hines. The 19 universities that competed in 2014 included: Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon, Chicago, Columbia, Cornell, Georgetown, Michigan, MIT, Northwestern, NYU, Rice, UCLA, UNC-Chapel Hill, USC, UT, Vanderbilt, Wharton, Wisconsin and Yale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/Centers/REFIC/Real-Estate-Challenge.aspx |title=National Real Estate Challenge |publisher=mccombs.utexas.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The CASE at MIT ===
Arguably the most prestigious competition to gauge the quality of graduate real estate programs in the world, the CASE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aacre.alumgroup.mit.edu/s/1314/clubs-classes-interior.aspx?sid=1314&amp;gid=175&amp;pgid=3053 |title=The CASE - MIT Center for Real Estate Alumni Association |publisher=aacre.alumgroup.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an annual real estate competition that provides current graduate student teams from the world's top universities an opportunity to compete against one another, showcase their knowledge, and learn from each other through the analysis of a complex real world development site. The CASE is organized and hosted by the Alumni Association of the MIT Center for Real Estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mitcre.mit.edu |title=MIT Center for Real Estate |publisher=mitcre.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other master's degree competitions, The CASE focuses on real estate acquisition, development programming and financial underwriting at the asset level. The competition mimics the professional circumstances and assignments that students interested in real estate finance, acquisitions and development are likely to encounter after graduation. Past finalists included: Harvard, Georgetown, Columbia, Yale, NYU, MIT, Cornell, Wharton at UPenn, London Business School, Cambridge and Hong Kong Institute of Technology.

==Undergraduate real estate education==
As with many [[MBA]] programs, undergraduate real estate education is commonly offered as a concentration, or focused area of study. Very few universities with varying academic reputation offer a bachelor's degree with a concentration in real estate (typically two courses during the senior year). An undergraduate degree in real estate is not a prerequisite for admission to a graduate real estate development program. Students from diverse backgrounds in [[geography]], [[urban planning]], business, economics, [[liberal arts]], architecture or seeking a career change are encouraged to apply.

{{See also| Undergraduate real estate programs}}

==Graduate real estate programs==
There are twenty-one multi-disciplinary real estate programs which focus on the academic study of real estate primarily, the '''Master of Real Estate Development''', while the majority of the other programs typically housed as part of a business school offer a more focused degree on finance and investment. Graduate real estate programs may award any number of degrees (e.g. [[Master of Real Estate Development]], [[Master of Science in Real Estate]], [[Master of Professional Studies in Real Estate]], Master of Design Studies in Real Estate), however, the key is to review each degree curricula independent of their respective naming conventions, as there are broad differences in their content and foci that may not necessarily be reflected in the degree's name.

Two examples of graduate real estate degree naming conventions include:

===Master in Real Estate Development (MRED or MSRED)===
The Master of Real Estate Development degree (MRED) (or sometimes called the Master of Science in Real Estate Development (MSRED)) largely focuses on specific areas within real estate rather than taking a more generalist approach. Areas of concentration may include: [[real estate development]], [[finance]] and [[investment]], [[planning]] and [[policy]], [[infrastructure]] and [[construction]], [[market analysis]], and [[real estate law]]. Students are generally exposed to the full range of functions and most real estate product types (e.g. residential, retail, office, hospitality, and industrial). MRED programs typically teach the subject matter through case studies and field experiences and by way of traditional class lectures. Whether in the context of urban redevelopment, historic preservation, or suburban growth, MRED students learn from both the investor's and developer's perspective, the importance of relevant issues in law, economics, finance, market analysis, negotiation, lease analysis, architecture, planning, and management.&lt;ref&gt;''Urban Land Magazine'' School for Developers, c, D.C.: Urban Institute, March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Many focus on the entire spectrum of the real estate development process-from dirt-to-deal, finance to façade-and include industry topics presented by leading local and national developers, financiers, and other players in the market. Included in this is the analysis of existing real estate assets and partnership structures.

===Master of Science in Real Estate (MSRE)===
The Master of Science in Real Estate degree (MSRE) often combines learning comprehensive business management skills with the understanding of how real estate markets work. Graduate programs that award a Master of Science in Real Estate degree are sometimes the expansion of real estate courses in a [[Business school]] into a degree of increased specialty or they are organically formed real estate centers within a larger college. Students who complete Master of Science in Real Estate degrees oftentimes go on to careers as real estate "project managers, asset management advisors, analysts, planners, and others." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carey.jhu.edu/academics/master-of-science/ms-in-real-estate-infrastructure |title=Master of Science in Real Estate - Carey School of Business |publisher=carey.jhu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Master of Science in Real Estate degrees are completed in one year though two year options with the opportunity to complete a summer internship between the first and second year are available (e.g. the [[University of Washington]]) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://realestate.washington.edu/academics/masters-of-real-estate/ |title=Master of Science in Real Estate - Runstad Center for Real Estate Studies |publisher=realestate.washington.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Master of Professional Studies in Real Estate is also similarly found here, as it is simply a naming convention at [[Georgetown University]] and [[Cornell University]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Coursework===
The course work in real estate programs varies among universities. Many programs utilize [[Harvard Business School|HBS]]-style [[case studies]] of complex real estate scenarios to heighten the student's knowledge and strategic decision-making skills. Program lengths range from 30 to 72 credit hours. Programs that have more than 33 hours will sometimes allow its students to add a concentration. A required core curriculum is typical with the core curriculum's size and makeup being largely dependent on the length and focus of the program.

Example core curriculum:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wpcarey.asu.edu/master-real-estate/academics/index.cfm |title=Academics - MRED - W. P. Carey School of Business |publisher=Wpcarey.asu.edu |date=2012-04-03 |accessdate=2013-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601131326/http://wpcarey.asu.edu/master-real-estate/academics/index.cfm |archivedate=June 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Market Segmentation]] and Analysis
*Real Estate Finance and Analysis
*Real Estate Development Project Management
*Advanced Real Estate Finance
*Real Estate Site Analysis and Design
*Public [[Entitlement]] Process

In addition to the core curriculum, most two-year programs and some one-year programs offer students the opportunity to pursue a concentration, a focus on a specialized area of interest within the real estate industry. Concentrations differ between programs and universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arch.umd.edu/real_estate_development/academics/courses.cfm?p=41 |title=Real Estate Development - Academics - Courses |publisher=arch.umd.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221010354/http://www.arch.umd.edu/real_estate_development/academics/courses.cfm?p=41 |archivedate=December 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Design education related to real estate development ===
The practice of real estate development requires practitioners to work with selecting building types and designs, determining appropriate dimensions, programming internal spaces, shaping the site, and appropriately fitting the project to surrounding contexts.  Some programs, including Harvard University's Master of Design and Columbia University's MSRED include design education in the study of real estate development.  A new program established at the University at Buffalo, State University of New York, in 2015 emphasizes a capstone studio-workshop in which a multidisciplinary group of students under faculty supervision engage an actual real estate development problem for organizations acting as clients.&lt;ref name="ap.buffalo.edu"&gt;{{cite web|title = Master of Science specializing in Real Estate Development - B/a+p|url = http://ap.buffalo.edu/real-estate-development.html|website = ap.buffalo.edu|access-date = 2016-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Executive programs in real estate==

Executive degree programs in real estate offer practicing professionals the opportunity to learn while they are working. These programs are distinguished from distance programs through their uniquely blended model of residency classroom experience, distance education modules, and executive field study courses. Classes meet at the beginning of every semester, usually from five to seven days, and then complete the coursework through synchronous webinars, asynchronous discussion boards, and video lectures. [[Executive education]] in real estate is taught at numerous accredited institutions such as [[Auburn University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mred.auburn.edu/ |title=Auburn University Executive MRED |publisher=Mred.auburn.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===List of graduate real estate programs outside the United States===

{{Main| Graduate real estate programs outside the United States}}

A number of universities around the world offer graduate degrees in real estate and related subjects. See the list in [[Graduate real estate programs outside the United States]].

==Nationally recognized research centers==
Real estate programs and alumni donors sponsor research by real estate faculty in numerous areas of real estate including the economics of property markets, the impacts of regulation, and the sources of equity and debt financing. Additional research, in the form of faculty-supervised student thesis work, contributes to a growing inventory of new information. The research program is essential to promoting new knowledge, advancing teaching techniques, and bridging the gap between theory and practice. Not all graduate real estate programs conduct research.

==Related graduate program offerings==
Professionals in real estate often hold degrees in related fields such as [[city planning]], construction management, accounting, property management, architecture or law. One of the most common programs continues to be a [[Master of City Planning]], regional planning, or urban planning degree with a real estate emphasis. Planning programs tend to emphasize land use planning, transportation or infrastructure development, land use law and policy and other planning topics; students who take a concentration in real estate development will learn how it relates to planning.

===MBA with Real Estate Concentration===
Business degrees with real estate concentrations generally provide students with the opportunity to pursue a general management degree, but to specialize in real estate development or some segment of the real estate industry through a sequence or group of electives. For a long time, those wishing to study real estate had to content themselves with primarily pursuing a [[Master of Business Administration]] degree, perhaps with the option of concentration in real estate, and usually with a focus in finance. These [[MBA]] programs typically only include one or two courses focused in real estate. Many MBA programs do not specialize in real estate.

For those weighing an MBA versus graduate real estate education, there are some issues to consider:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!
! '''MBA'''
!'''Graduate Real Estate (MSRE, MSRED, MRED, MPS/RE)'''
|-
|'''Timeframe''' || 2 years full-time || 1 or 2 years; part or full-time
|-
|'''Curriculum''' || 1st year - Business Basics; 2nd year - Specialization largely focused on finance-related areas || Real estate focus and specialization throughout
|-
|'''Specialization''' || Real Estate in MBA programs is very rare. Specialization tends to be finance focused || Broad-based real estate education in design, management, law, development, economics and significant focus on finance, e.g., real estate finance, capital markets
|-
|'''Program size''' || Typically, the programs are large with real estate students representing a relatively small (2% - 3%) percentage || Small groups, with commonly 25 to 50 students
|-
|'''Industry Commitment''' || Students pursuing an MBA may not be committed to a real estate career; therefore they are seeking a broader base || All students are committed to the real estate industry and many have real-estate related experience prior to coming to the program. An important part of the programs are the learning between students.
|-
|'''Career opportunities''' || Varied but with a heavy concentration in finance-related areas of the real estate industry || Significant representation in project management, development, finance-related areas, acquisitions, entrepreneurship and government
|-
|'''Thesis''' || Generally, not required || Typically required, usually as a professional publication or a real-life capstone competition
|-
|'''Alumni network''' || Usually extensive, but predominantly outside of the real estate industry || Alumni are involved in all facets of the industry and located throughout the world
|-
|'''Recruitment''' || Limited recruitment by real estate companies || Many students seeking employment find opportunities through peers, professors or on-site recruitment
|}

====MBA real estate concentration offerings====
A limited number of MBA programs offer courses in real estate as part of the typical study in business.

[[Image:Magyar Képzőművészeti Egyetem.JPG|right|275px|thumb|The central building of the university]]
The '''Hungarian University of Fine Arts''' ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: ''Magyar Képzőművészeti Egyetem'', '''MKE''') is the central [[Hungary|Hungarian]] art school in [[Budapest]], [[Andrássy Avenue]]. It was founded in 1871 as the Hungarian Royal Drawing School ''(Magyar Királyi Mintarajztanoda)'' and has been called University of Fine Arts since 2001.

==History==
Until the mid-19th century, Hungarian artists were learning fine arts in Western European academies. The National Society of Hungarian Fine Arts (Országos Magyar Képzőművészeti Társulat) founded in 1861 was initiating the establishment of a Hungarian school of fine arts. Owing to this movement the Hungarian Royal Drawing School and Art Teachers’ College ''(Magyar Királyi Mintarajztanoda és Rajztanárképezde)'' was opened in 1871. The present-day building of the university was built in 1877, designed by [[Alajos Rauscher]] and [[Adolf Lang]].

In later decades, the school developed programs for training not only [[Painting|painter]]s and [[sculptor]]s, but [[applied arts|artist-craftsmen]], [[mosaic]]- and [[gobelin]]-makers, stage designers, [[Costume designer|costumer]]s, and [[restorer]]s. Numerous prominent Hungarian artists taught there, including the painters [[Károly Ferenczy]], [[János Vaszary]], [[Viktor Olgyai]], [[Róbert Berény]],  [[Aurél Bernáth]], [[Jenő Barcsay]], and  [[Márta Lacza]]; sculptor [[Béni Ferenczy]] and other notable artists.

'''Imperial College School of Medicine Students' Union''' ('''ICSMSU''') is the [[students' union]] of [[Imperial College School of Medicine]]. It is charged with caring for the educational, pastoral, social and extracurricular needs of the undergraduate students of the Faculty of Medicine of [[Imperial College London]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.union.ic.ac.uk/medic/cms/images/stories/File/Governance/Constitution.pdf ICSMSU Constitution]&lt;/ref&gt; and is a constituent union of [[Imperial College Union]].

== History ==
Formed in 1997 by the mergers of the Students' Unions of [[St Mary's Hospital Medical School]], [[Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School]] (formerly [[Charing Cross Hospital Medical School]] and [[Westminster Hospital Medical School]]) and the [[Royal Postgraduate Medical School]].

Rivalry was abundant before and during the years or mergers. The 1954 film [[Doctor in the House]] was reportedly based on the behaviour of the St Mary's students.

==Executive committee==
The Union has one full-time sabbatical president supported by 16 student officers, each covering an area such as entertainments, education, welfare, clubs &amp; societies, alumni &amp; careers, or sites &amp; services.  The president is also the [[British Medical Association]] ISC Chair, as well as a delegate to [[United Hospitals#MedGroup|Medgroup]].

==Education and welfare==
The three academic officers, along with the respective year representatives, look after the 6-year MBBS/BSc Course, the 5-year graduate entry MBBS course, and all students undertaking BSc courses.

ICSMSU runs a highly successful "Mums and Dads" programme which aims to match up new students with older students on the same course.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parents4freshers.org.uk/ Mums and Dads website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clubs and societies==
There are currently over 40 student-run clubs and societies especially for the members of ICSM.  Many of the bigger clubs can trace their history back to the original hospital medical schools.&lt;ref&gt;E. A. Heaman, St Marys: The History of a London Teaching Hospital 2003, {{ISBN|0-7735-2514-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the clubs compete in the [[United Hospitals]] competitions, or send players to the combined teams. Notable clubs and societies include [[Imperial Medicals Rugby Club]], ICSM Boat Club, [[ICSM Water Polo]], and [http://www.icsmsu.com/opera/ ICSM Light Opera].

===Sports===
ICSM also has a strong sporting ethos inherited from its predecessors. It enjoys frequent success against the other London medical schools in the [[United Hospitals]] and [[National Association of Medics' Sports]] competitions and in the [[British Universities &amp; Colleges Sport|BUCS]] league.

While medical students may join ICU sports clubs (and non-medical students may join the medical clubs and societies), most prefer to participate in ICSM sports teams which, depending on the sport, may compete against [[Imperial College]] or other Imperial faculty teams such as the [[Royal School of Mines]], such as in the annual Varsity competition, which involves teams from ICSM and IC. The competition culminates in the [[J.P.R. Williams]] Cup, named after the highly successful Welsh rugby player and doctor J.P.R. Williams, who graduated from [[St Mary's Hospital, London]] in 1973, with the 1st XVs of [[Imperial Medicals Rugby Club]] and ICU Rugby playing each other in front of a 1,500 strong crowd.

Sir [[Roger Bannister]], another [[St Mary's Hospital Medical School]] alumnus gives his name to the trophy for the annual varsity athletics meet.&lt;ref&gt;http://sirrogerbannistertrophy.co.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ICSMBC''' was formed in 1997 by merging the Medical School Rowing Clubs from St Mary's Hospital, Charing Cross Hospital and Westminster Boat Club. They row out of the [[University of London Boat Club]] boat house which is situated on the [[River Thames]] in [[Chiswick]] and train at ICBC boathouse in [[Putney]]. The current captain of ICSMBC is Luke Reader &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icsmbc.com/|title=ICSMBC Website}}&lt;/ref&gt; Predominantly the Club rows in United Hospital events, and is part of the United Hospital Boat Clubs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uhboatclub.co.uk/|title=UH Boatclub website}}&lt;/ref&gt; though they also take part in races through [[British Rowing]] such as Head of the River.

===Water Polo===
Imperial College School of Medicine [[Water Polo]] is the water polo team of Imperial College School of Medicine Students' Union. It came about pursuant to a merger of the [[Charing Cross Hospital]], [[Westminster Hospital]], and St Mary's Hospital water polo clubs.

==== History ====
The club in its modern form was founded in 1997 following the merger of the St. Mary's Hospital Water Polo Club with the [[Charing Cross]] and Westminster Hospitals Water Polo Club.

In 2008 the club agreed a joint venture into the BUCS league with the [[Imperial College]] Swimming and Water Polo Club. This brought immediate success with the Imperial College/Medicals side being crowned Tier Two Champions in 2009/10, and thus securing promotion to the Premier Tier for the 2010/11 season.  The joint BUCS team performed strongly again in the 2012/13 season finishing third in the Premier Tier.

==== Competitions ====

The club focuses its efforts on the London Universities Sports League (LUSL), formerly known as the ULU League, in which it enters a mixed gender team and plays weekly matches against other London universities. The Varsity match against the Imperial College water polo team is played annually in March.

=== Light Opera ===

The origin of the medical school's [[musical theatre]] society is a 1943 production of [[Gilbert and Sullivan|Gilbert and Sullivan's]] ''[[Trial by Jury]]'' by students at St Mary's. Despite a trend towards more modern musicals, the name was maintained during the 1997 merger to honour the society's history, which includes performances attended by then [[Elizabeth II|HRH Princess Elizabeth]] in 1945, [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|HRH Princess Margaret]] in 1957, and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|HRH Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother]] in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Verrall|first1=H|title=A Brief History of (Light) Opera: 1943-2015|journal=ICSM Gazette|volume=15|issue=3|pages=36–37|url=https://icsmgazette.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/icsm-gazette-autumn-2015-7-12-151.pdf|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year, Light Opera performs its main show in December and a so-called '24-Hour Opera' in April or May, hosts multiple 'Big Chill' [[open mic]] nights, and participates in other showcases. The 24-Hour Opera is a musical chosen, planned, and auditioned without revealing the show's identity. It is announced to the cast, crew, and public on one evening and performed the next; all proceeds are donated to charity.

The society maintains strong social traditions and also provides academic support for its numerous members. A significant proportion of the ICSMSU executive committee tend to be part of Light Opera.

==Events==
ICSMSU runs a full social calendar, including long-standing events and traditions from the original medical schools. This includes Freshers' Fortnight, [[Westminster Hospital Medical School#Shrove Tuesday Final Year Dinner|Shrove Tuesday Final Year Dinner]], ICSM Summer Ball, Sports Dinner, RAG and Vision.

==Facilities==

===Charing Cross Campus===
The main facilities for the medical students of ICSM are found in the Reynolds Building on the [[Charing Cross Hospital]] campus.  Here you can find the [http://www.reynoldsbar.com/ Reynolds Bar], as well as meeting rooms, offices, two gyms, a dance studio and club storage rooms.

===South Kensington Campus===
ICSM is housed in the Sir Alexander Fleming Building on the South Kensington Campus.  Here ICSMSU has a suite of offices for use of the President and SU and club officers, as well as meeting rooms and a common room.

===Other Campuses===
ICSMSU are responsible for the upkeep of the student facilities on all other teaching hospital sites, including [[Chelsea and Westminster Hospital]] and [[St Mary's Hospital, London]].

==Alumni==
2004 saw the first set of ICSM doctors graduate, and so the [[Imperial College School of Medicine#Alumni|ICSM Alumni Association]] was founded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.union.ic.ac.uk/medic/icsm_alumni/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=section&amp;id=1&amp;Itemid=3 About the ICSM Alumni Association]&lt;/ref&gt;  Run by ICSMSU, the association aims to provide funding for the clubs and societies of the medical school, as well as offer support to students.

{{Intelligent Design}}

The [[intelligent design movement]] has conducted an organized campaign largely in the United States that promotes a [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]], [[Neo-Creationism|neo-creationist]] religious agenda calling for broad social, academic and political changes centering on [[intelligent design]].

== International context ==
{{main|Level of support for evolution}}
Though creationism and intelligent design are not supported by any mainstream scientists, there are significant minorities in the general public in most developed countries that say they doubt or reject the theory of evolution, likely because of their religious beliefs.  In underdeveloped countries where rates of religious belief are much higher, support of evolution is consequently lower.

== Europe ==
In Europe, religion generally has much less influence on politics than in the United States or the developing world.  Despite this, there are pockets of creationist and intelligent design activity.

=== Council of Europe ===
The [[Council of Europe]]'s [[Committee on Culture, Science and Education]] released a report  in June 2007 entitled "The Dangers of Creationism in Education".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |others= Rapporteur: Anne Brasseur |date=September 17, 2007 |title=The dangers of creationism in education |type=Report |publisher=[[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] |id=Doc. 11375 |url=http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/X2H-Xref-ViewHTML.asp?FileID=11751&amp;Lang=EN |accessdate=2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the council members, [[Anne Brasseur]] said that the aim of the report was to anchor evolution in school curricula, and warned that there was still resistance in many European countries. She provided the following examples in an interview with German newspaper ''[[Der Spiegel]]'':
* A former deputy education minister of Poland called the theory of evolution a lie.
* Activism against teaching evolution in grade school by some Russian parents
* A 2004 proposed decree against evolution
* A proposed "Genesis-Land" theme park in Switzerland based on the [[Creation Museum]] in Kentucky.
* Creationist lectures and symposia in the United Kingdom
* The publication and free distribution of the "Atlas of Creation" by [[Harun Yahya]] in Turkey
* The Ministry of Education for the German state of [[Hesse]] allowing the teaching of theory of creation in biology class
* The publishing house "Studiengemeinschaft Wort und Wissen" is now publishing the sixth edition of a grade school textbook that includes the theory of intelligent design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Lubbadeh |first=Jens |date=February 25, 2009 |title=Contesting Evolution: European Creationists Take On Darwin |work =[[Spiegel Online]] |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/contesting-evolution-european-creationists-take-on-darwin-a-609712.html |accessdate=2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== North America ==

=== Canada ===
Unlike in the United States the issue has never been the subject of a major Supreme Court case, nor does it figure prominently in the national media.&lt;ref name="ucobserver.org"&gt;{{Citation |last=Halfnight |first=Drew |title=Where's Darwin? |date=September 2008 |work=[[United Church Observer]] |url=http://www.ucobserver.org/ethics/2008/09/wheres_darwin/ |accessdate=2016-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Education in Canada|In Canada, education]] is the constitutional responsibility of the provinces. No province has taught creationism in its official public school curriculum in modern times, however, there are various different approaches to the teaching of evolution and religion across the country, as well as various exceptions for [[separate schools]] (publicly funded religious school, primarily Catholic), [[private schools]], [[alternative schools]], [[Reserve schools]], [[Charter schools in Alberta|charter schools]], and so on. In most provincial curricula (excluding Quebec, where it has been mandatory in elementary schools since 2004) evolutionary theory is only required in Grade 11 or 12; however, it can be taught earlier at the discretion of local school boards and teachers.&lt;ref name="ucobserver.org"/&gt;

Around 63,000 Canadian children attend "Christian" (primarily evangelical) schools outside of the provincial systems (which include both the public [secular] and Catholic schools), where they are generally taught creationism rather than evolution.&lt;ref name="ucobserver.org"/&gt;

In 2006, the [[Ministry of Education, Recreation and Sports (Quebec)|ministry of education in Quebec]] ordered unlicensed private evangelical Christian schools to start teaching evolution and sexual [[education]], otherwise the schools would be closed. In Ontario, private schools are not required to teach either evolution or sex education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Teach sex and evolution or close, Quebec evangelical schools told |date=October 24, 2006 |work=[[Ottawa Citizen]] |url=http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=73dc97c9-2172-466d-b730-4d7d710e29fe |accessdate=2016-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304213155/http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=73dc97c9-2172-466d-b730-4d7d710e29fe |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the government under the [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta]] introduced [[Bill 44]] which allows parents to pull their children out of public school classrooms if they disagree with the controversial subject matter being discussed (such as evolution or homosexuality).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Evolution classes optional under proposed Alberta law |work= [[CBC News]] |date=April 30, 2009 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/evolution-classes-optional-under-proposed-alberta-law-1.783950 |accessdate=2016-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later amendments to the bill clarified that parents could choose to pull their children from religion classes, but not from science classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Proposed Alberta law doesn't make evolution classes optional: minister |date=May 4, 2009 |work= [[CBC News]] |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2009/05/04/cgy-evolution-alberta-human-rights.html |accessdate=2016-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
A number of specific political strategies and tactics have been employed by intelligent design proponents. These range from attempts at the state level to undermine or remove altogether the presence of evolutionary theory from the public school classroom, to having the federal government mandate the teaching of intelligent design, to 'stacking' municipal, county and state school boards with intelligent design proponents. The [[Discovery Institute]] has been driving force in most cases, providing a range of support from material assistance to federal, state and regional elected representatives in the drafting of bills to supporting and advising individual parents confronting their school boards.

A feature of the [[Discovery Institute intelligent design campaigns]] has been extensive lobbying and [[public relations]] campaigns conducted on behalf of intelligent design proponents in order to overcome professional setbacks such as that of [[Guillermo Gonzalez (astronomer)|Guillermo Gonzalez]], [[Richard Sternberg]] and [[Francis Beckwith]]. These efforts are focused on two efforts: the '''[[Teach the Controversy]]''' and '''[[Critical Analysis of Evolution]]''' campaigns. These campaigns gained prominence after the [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]] trial where Judge [[John E. Jones III]] ruled that teaching intelligent design or presenting it as an alternative to evolution was a violation of the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]] because intelligent design is not legitimate science but essentially religious in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District |vol=400 |reporter=F.Supp.2d |opinion= 707 |pinpoint= pp 136–138 |court=United States District Court, M.D. Pennsylvania |date=December 20, 2005 |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16465861447416053365 |accessdate=2016-02-12 }} available at [[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/6:Curriculum, Conclusion#H. Conclusion|Ruling, Kitzmiller v. Dover, Conclusion]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the [[Teach the Controversy]] and  [[Critical Analysis of Evolution]] strategies and resources for them come from the [[Discovery Institute]] and its [[Center for Science and Culture]], the hub of the intelligent design movement. These strategies are seen as another iteration of the Discovery Institute's campaign to "defeat [the] [[Materialism|materialist]] [[world view]]" represented by the theory of [[evolution]] in favor of "a science consonant with [[Christian]] and [[Theism|theistic]] convictions".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The Wedge Document |date=October 14, 2008 |url=http://ncse.com/creationism/general/wedge-document |accessdate=2016-02-23}}. Cited in {{cite news |title=US scientists battle over challenge to Darwinism |date=5 March 2005 |agency=AFP |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2005-03-06/us-scientists-battle-over-challenge-to-darwinism/1530430 |accessdate=2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the Center for Science and Culture's weblog,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evolutionnews.org Evolution News and Views]&lt;/ref&gt; at least 10 state legislatures are now considering legislation reconsidering how evolution is taught. Many of these initiatives benefit from significant legal assistance from a number of conservative legal foundations including the [[Thomas More Law Center]], the [[Alliance Defense Fund]], and [[Quality Science Education for All]] (QSEA). All have [[litigation|litigated]] extensively on behalf of the movement.

====Specific cases====

=====1999 &amp; 2005 creationist Kansas Boards of Education=====
{{main|Kansas evolution hearings}}
In 1999 the Kansas Board of Education voted to delete references to evolution from Kansas science standards. This had the net effect of removing the teaching of evolution from the state's science curriculum. The move angered the mainstream science community which predicted a resulting loss of rigor and quality in science education. The Board's decision was in part influenced by the presence of recently elected [[Christian right|conservative Christians]] to the board and heavy lobbying by the [[Discovery Institute|Discovery Institute's]] [[Center for Science and Culture]], then known as the "Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture" (CRSC).  Subsequent elections altered the membership of the school board and led to renewed backing for evolution instruction in 2001.

Elections in 2004 gave religious conservatives a contentious 6-4 majority. The board in 2005 was finalizing new science standards which would have guided teachers about how and what to teach students. A proposal advanced by conservatives and intelligent design proponents, with support from the Center for Science and Culture, was similar to the [[Critical Analysis of Evolution]] plan  for which the Center lobbied the Ohio Board of Education in 2002. It would not have eliminated evolution entirely from instruction, nor would it require intelligent design to be presented as an alternative to evolution, but the ''Critical Analysis of Evolution'' plan treated evolution as a flawed theory, a position that defied mainstream scientific views.

On 8 November 2005, the Kansas Board of Education, chaired by veterinarian [[Steve Abrams]], approved new science teaching standards that included the ''Critical Analysis of Evolution''. The Discovery Institute was key in the drafting and adoption of the new standards which were approved by 6 to 4, reflecting the makeup of religious conservatives on the board.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/2005-11-08-kansas-science-standards_x.htm https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/2005-11-08-kansas-science-standards_x.htm], Greg Toppo, [[USA Today]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the new Kansas standards noted that they promoted the teaching of intelligent design.  Kansas standards previously supported evolutionary theory, which held that all life had a common origin. Creationists claimed that theory had been challenged by their interpretation of fossils and molecular biology. They had also echoed the standard intelligent design argument that there is a  [[Teach the controversy|controversy]] as to whether changes over time in one species can lead to a new species.&lt;ref name = "prim2006"&gt;[http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/news/politics/15175001.htm Mercury News]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the board of education decided to include more criticism of evolution in its school science standards, a [[University of Kansas]] professor, Paul Mirecki, proposed to teach a class called "Special Topics in Religion: intelligent design, Creationism and other Religious Mythologies." The class was cancelled and the professor was forced to resign as chairman of the university's religious studies department. Mirecki had alleged that he was also assaulted and beaten by creationists who opposed his teaching of the class&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=site=http://www.cnn.com/2005/EDUCATION/12/11/creationism.professor.ap/index.html |title=Anti-creationism professor: Resignation was forced |access-date=April 30, 2017}}{{dead link|date=April 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, [[CNN]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In primary election held on August 1, 2006, pro-creationist conservative Republicans lost their 6-4 board majority when incumbent Connie Morris from [[Cheyenne County, Kansas]], was defeated by moderate Republican Sally Cauble, of [[Liberal, Kansas]]. Another slot which until then was held by a retiring conservative whose son-in-law from Idaho, Brad Patzer, ran for her office, was won by Jana Shaver, a pro-science Republican from [[Independence, Kansas]].&lt;ref name = "prim2006"/&gt;

=====2000 Congressional briefing=====
In 2000, the leading intelligent design proponents operating through the [[Discovery Institute]] held a congressional briefing in [[Washington, D.C.]], to promote intelligent design to lawmakers. Sen. [[Rick Santorum]] was (and continues to be) one of intelligent design's most vocal supporters. One result of this briefing was that Sen. Santorum inserted pro-intelligent design language into the No Child Left Behind bill calling for students to be [[Teach the controversy|taught why evolution "generates so much continuing controversy,"]] an assertion heavily promoted by the Discovery Institute.

=====2001 Santorum Amendment=====
{{main|Santorum Amendment}}
The [[Santorum Amendment]] was a failed proposed amendment to the 2001 education act [[No Child Left Behind]] of 2001. The inclusion of the amendment in the Act was heavily lobbied for by the Discovery Institute, which also participated in the drafting of the original language of the amendment. Although only a modified form of the amendment appeared in the conference report, the amendment itself was not included in the legislation that President George W. Bush signed.&lt;ref name="ForrestGross2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Forrest|first1=Barbara |authorlink1=Barbara Forrest|last2=Gross|first2=Paul R. |authorlink2=Paul R.

It was not the victory intelligent design proponents had hoped for.  Conference reports do not carry the weight of law and are merely explanatory in nature,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?programs=CRSC&amp;command=view&amp;id=1121 Congress Urges Teaching of Diverse Views on Evolution, but Darwinists Try to Deny It], [[Center for Science and Culture]]&lt;/ref&gt; and, in any case, the amendment failed. Nonetheless, an email newsletter by the Discovery Institute contained the sentence "Undoubtedly this will change the face of the debate over the theories of evolution and intelligent design in America. &amp;nbsp;... It also seems that the Darwinian monopoly on public science education, and perhaps the biological sciences in general, is ending" and Senator [[Sam Brownback]] of [[Kansas]] cited the amendment as vindicating the 1999 Kansas school board decision (since overturned) to eliminate evolution questions from State tests.&lt;ref name="ForrestGross2007" /&gt;{{rp|241–2}} Consistent with the [[Wedge strategy]] its inclusion in the conference report on the failed amendment continues to be incorrectly cited by the Discovery Institute and other intelligent design supporters as providing federal sanction for intelligent design. Reps. [[John Boehner]] and [[Steve Chabot]] of [[Ohio]] and Sen. [[Judd Gregg]] of [[New Hampshire]], along with Santorum, have signed letters supporting the Discovery Institute's interpretation of the Santorum amendment. One of those letters was sent to the president and vice-president of the Ohio Board of Education in 2002; the other was sent to the Texas Board of Education in 2003, see below.&lt;ref name="ForrestGross2007" /&gt;{{rp|250–1}}

A bill proposed by Rep. Gosselin (House Bill 4382) which sought to amend 1976 PA 451, "The revised school code". The bill directed that In the science standards, all references to "evolution" and "how species change through time" would be modified to indicate that this is an unproven theory, by adding the phrase "all students will explain the competing theories of evolution and natural selection based on random mutation and the theory that life is the result of the purposeful, intelligent design of a creator." The bill also directed that in the science standards for middle and high school, all references to "evolution" and "natural selection" would be modified to indicate that these are unproven theories, by adding the phrase "describe how life may be the result of the purposeful, intelligent design of a creator." And in the science standards for middle and high school, the bill directed all references to "evolution" and "natural selection" would be modified to indicate that these are unproven theories, by adding the phrase "explain the competing theories of evolution and natural selection based on random mutation and the theory that life is the result of the purposeful, intelligent design of a creator." The bill also would have required that the recommended model core academic curriculum content standards that are developed and periodically updated by the state board comply with these provisions. Also under the bill the State Board would have been required to make these revisions as soon as practicable after the effective date of the bill, if it had been enacted.

An "equal-time" bill, described in its title as "Providing for the teaching of creation science and evolution science on an equal basis in the public schools."  HB2554 was introduced in the state legislature in February 2001, and died in committee.

=====2001 Kanawha County, West Virginia=====
In February 2001 a parent filed a complaint with the Kanawha County Board of Education claiming that science textbooks used there contain "false and fraudulent" information about evolution. The parent and 30 cosigners opposed to evolution asserted that the textbooks are in violation of state law because they are outdated or inaccurate. As evidence that textbooks which include evolution are flawed, they cited Jonathan Well's of the Discovery Institute book ''Icons of Evolution''. The board rejected the claim.

=====2001 Arkansas, House Bill 2548=====
In 2001 Representative [[Jim Holt (Arkansas politician)|Jim Holt]] proposed a bill in the Arkansas legislature that would make it illegal for the state or any of its agencies to use state funds to purchase materials that contained false or fraudulent claims. A list of such claims was provided in the text of House Bill 2548 (HB2548). Much of the text of the examples given was either quoted verbatim from anti-evolutionary sources or was a close paraphrase of such materials. The sources cited in the bill included the cartoon tract, "Big Daddy?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0055/0055_01.asp Big Daddy?], [[Jack Chick]]&lt;/ref&gt; published by [[Jack Chick]]. Critics of the bill alleged that many of the "examples" selected were themselves either false or misleading. March 21, 2001, Representative Holt invited his friend and controversial anti-evolutionist [[Kent Hovind]] to testify before a committee of the Arkansas Legislature in support of the bill. In April 2001 a motion was passed to postpone HB 2548 indefinitely for study during the interim by the Joint Interim Committee on Education.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930225245/http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/ftproot/bills/2001/htm/HB2548.pdf Internet Archive version of Arkansas House Bill 2548]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====2001 Montana, House Bill 588=====
House Bill 588 by Rep. Joe Balyeat, R-Bozeman, was presented as an "objectivity in science education" measure, and would have directed the approval of evolution and creationism materials by an appointed six-member committee. The bill failed in committee.

===== 2001 Pennsylvania Board of Education =====
In July 2001 the Pennsylvania Board of Education gave final approval to revised science standards. Language in early versions of the standards sought to raise questions about the status of evolution as science and a theory. Science educators and other Pennsylvania citizens expressed concern that the proposed standards might open the way to teaching creationism in science classes because of ambiguous or unclear wording. However, the final standards do not contain the contested language and the  standards were approved by the legislature.

=====2002 Ohio Board of Education=====
In March 2002 Ohio held hearings on revising the state science standards. The Discovery Institute's [[Stephen C. Meyer]] proposed to the Ohio Board of Education the Institute's [[Critical Analysis of Evolution]] that featured intelligent design prominently in its curricula.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discovery.org/csc/ohio/docs/modellesson.pdf Critical Analysis of Evolution model lesson plan] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106113806/http://www.discovery.org/csc/ohio/docs/modellesson.pdf |date=2015-11-06 }} Discovery Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?program=CSC&amp;command=view&amp;id=1134 Teach the Controversy], [[Stephen C.

Concurrently, a factitious redefinition of science to include God was proposed to the Ohio legislature, so that the legislature would then be able to get behind the set of standards that included intelligent design. The Discovery Institute's model lesson plan was adopted in part by the state for Ohio science teachers in October 2002, though the Board advised that the science standards do "not mandate the teaching or testing of intelligent design".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciohio.org/sbe1015.htm Resolution of intent to adopt science standards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051118191248/http://www.sciohio.org/sbe1015.htm |date=2005-11-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was touted as a significant victory by the Discovery Institute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?program=News-CSC&amp;command=view&amp;id=1937 Good News from Ohio: Teaching the Controversy], [[Charles Colson]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2006, the Ohio Board of Education voted 11-4 to delete the science standard and correlating lesson plan adopted in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=site=http://www.cnn.com/2006/EDUCATION/02/15/evolution.debate.ap/index.html |title=Evolution lesson plan goes in for redesign |access-date=April 30, 2017}}{{dead link|date=April 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, [[CNN]]&lt;/ref&gt; The board also rejected a competing plan from intelligent design proponents to request a legal opinion from the state attorney general on the constitutionality of the science standards. Intelligent design proponents pledged to force another vote on the issue.

=====2002 Cobb County, Georgia=====
{{main|Selman v. Cobb County School District}}
In 2002 the Cobb County school board required stickers placed in a science textbook. Stating that evolution was "a theory, not a fact," the sticker was placed in the ninth-grade biology text after parents complained to the Cobb County school board that alternative ideas about the origin of life were not presented. A group of parents represented by the American Civil Liberties Union sued the school board, claiming the stickers violate the separation of church and state. The trial was resolved in January 2005 when U.S. District Judge Clarence Cooper ruled the sticker was unconstitutional.  In the verdict&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/cobb/selman-v-cobb.html Order], [[Selman v. Cobb County School District]]&lt;/ref&gt; he wrote, "By denigrating evolution, the school board appears to be endorsing the well-known prevailing alternative theory, creationism or variations thereof, even though the sticker does not specifically reference any alternative theories." In December 2005 the federal appeal court panel made comments sharply criticising the lower court ruling in advance of releasing their decision. Judge Ed Carnes said that the words on the sticker are "technically accurate," and that "From nonlife to life is the greatest gap in scientific theory. There is less evidence supporting it than there is for other theories. It sounds to me like evolution is more vulnerable and deserves more critical thinking," suggesting that he did not understand the distinction between [[evolution]] and [[abiogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/942395631.html?dids=942395631:942395631&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Dec+16%2C+2005&amp;author=Ellen+Barry&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=THE+NATION%3B+Appeals+Panel+Criticizes+Evolution+Ruling%3B+A+federal+district+judge+had+ordered+the+removal+of+stickers+in+a+Georgia+county's+science+textbooks+that+called+evolution+a+theory.&amp;pqatl=google Appeals Panel Criticizes Evolution Ruling], Ellen Barry, [[Los Angeles Times]], December 16, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 2006 Cobb County School Board agreed to settle the long-running legal case.

=====2003 Texas State Board of Education, textbook controversy=====
In 2003 The Texas State Board of Education was considering 11 different textbooks for inclusion in the 2004-2005 school year. Fellows of the Discovery Institute testified to the Board that whatever textbooks are adopted should introduce statements on the "weaknesses of the theory of evolution" and include "competing theories, such as intelligent design." The DI had strong interest in the Texas debate because the state is the second largest purchaser of textbooks in the country. Thus any changes publishers make to cater to the state would likely be seen elsewhere.

=====2004/2005 Richard Sternberg=====
{{main|Sternberg peer review controversy}}
The Sternberg peer review controversy arose over whether an article published in a scientific journal that supported the controversial concept of intelligent design was properly peer reviewed. The journal's editor, [[Richard Sternberg]], was an active proponent of intelligent design with ties to the Discovery Institute, and the article's author, [[Stephen C. Meyer]], is an official of the Discovery Institute. The journal's publisher ultimately withdrew Meyer's article saying Sternberg published it outside of the normal review process, a statement Sternberg disputes.

In the course of his defense Sternberg claimed he was the subject of religious discrimination due to his belief in intelligent design by the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History, where he served as an unpaid research associate. Sternberg's claim is contradicted by John G. West, Vice President and Senior Fellow of the Discovery Institute and Associate Director of the Institute's Center for Science &amp; Culture who wrote, "The first misunderstanding is the belief that intelligent design is based on religion rather than science. Intelligent design is a scientific inference based on empirical evidence, not on religious texts."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discovery.org/a/2845]&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite West's clear rejection of Sternberg's claim, Republican representatives, other Discovery Institute affiliates and intelligent design advocates [[Mark Souder]] and [[Rick Santorum]] authored a report supporting Sternberg's claim of discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.souder.house.gov/_files/IntoleranceandthePoliticizationofScienceattheSmithsonian.pdf Intolerance and Politicization of Science at the Smithsonian] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070425194351/http://www.souder.house.gov/_files/IntoleranceandthePoliticizationofScienceattheSmithsonian.pdf |date=2007-04-25 }} United States House of Representatives Committee on Government Reform, December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="souder_appendix"&gt;[http://www.souder.house.gov/sitedirector/~files/AppendixtoReportIntoleranceandthePoliticizationofScienceattheSmithsonian.pdf Appendix to Intolerance and the Politicization of Science at the Smithsonian] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070111101133/http://www.souder.house.gov/sitedirector/~files/AppendixtoReportIntoleranceandthePoliticizationofScienceattheSmithsonian.pdf |date=2007-01-11 }} United States House of Representatives Committee on Government Reform, December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lame_ducks"&gt;[http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/12/lame_ducks_weig.html Lame Ducks Weigh In] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070330091334/http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/12/lame_ducks_weig.html |date=2007-03-30 }} Reed A.

=====2005 Pennsylvania, House Bill 1007=====
On March 16, 2005, a bill, HB 1007, promoting "intelligent design" creationism was introduced in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and referred to the Education Committee. If enacted, HB 1007 would add a section ("Teaching Theories on the Origin of Man and Earth") to the Public School Code of 1949. That new section would allow school boards to add "intelligent design" to any curriculum containing evolution and allow teachers to use, subject to the approval of the board, "supporting evidence deemed necessary for instruction on the theory of intelligent design." The term "intelligent design" is not defined in the bill. Presumably attempting to prevent a challenge to its constitutionality, HB 1007 explicitly states, "When providing supporting evidence on the theory of intelligent design, no teacher in a public school may stress any particular denominational, sectarian or religious belief."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legis.state.pa.us/WU01/LI/BI/ALL/2005/0/HB1007.HTM Pennsylvania House Bill 1007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051224105524/http://www.legis.state.pa.us/WU01/LI/BI/ALL/2005/0/HB1007.HTM |date=2005-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2005 [[John G. West]] and Seth Cooper of the Discovery Institute wrote a letter to Pennsylvania Representative Jess M. Stairs urging Stairs and the Pennsylvania legislature not to pass HB1007. This reflects a shift in the strategy of the intelligent design proponents. Anticipating legal challenges to the constitutionality of laws that mandate teaching of intelligent design, proponents feel including intelligent design  content in science curricula under the guise of "scientific criticisms" or "evidence against evolution," within the pretense of "teaching the controversy" is a more defensible strategy.

=====2005 Kansas evolution hearings=====
{{main|Kansas evolution hearings}}

A series of hearings instigated by the [[Discovery Institute]] held in [[Topeka, Kansas]] May 2005 by the Kansas State Board of Education to review changes how the origin of life would be taught in the state's public high school science classes. The hearings were boycotted by the [[scientific community]], and views expressed represented largely those of intelligent design advocates. The result of the hearings was the adoption of new science standards by the fundamentalist-dominated board in defiance of the State Board Science Hearing Committee that relied upon the institute's [[Critical Analysis of Evolution]] lesson plan and adopted the institute's Teach the Controversy approach. In August 2006 conservative Republicans lost their majority on the board in a primary election. The moderate Republican and Democrats gaining seats vowed to overturn the 2005 school science standards and adopt those recommended by a State Board Science Hearing Committee that were rejected by the previous board.

On the 13th of February, 2007, the Kansas State Board of Education approved a new curriculum which removed any reference to Intelligent Design as part of science. In the words of Dr Bill Wagnon, the board chairman, "Today the Kansas Board of Education returned its curriculum standards to mainstream science". The new curriculum, as well as a document outlining the differences with the previous curriculum, has been posted on the Kansas State Department of Education's website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ksde.org/Default.aspx?tabid=144 Science Curricular Standards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070430050434/http://www.ksde.org/Default.aspx?tabid=144 |date=2007-04-30 }}, [[Kansas State Department of Education]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====2005/2004 Dover, Pennsylvania Board of Education=====
{{Main|Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District}}

In 2004 the [[Dover, Pennsylvania]] Board of Education passed a resolution requiring 9th grade biology teachers to read a statement that the Pennsylvania Academic Standards require the teaching of evolution, but then the statement proceeds to seed doubts about evolution's validity and directs students to study intelligent design and the intelligent design textbook &lt;cite&gt;[[Of Pandas and People]]&lt;/cite&gt; as an alternative. Three of the school board members in the minority of the vote resigned in protest, and science teachers in the district refused to read the statement to their ninth-grade students, citing the Pennsylvania code of education, which states that teachers cannot present information they believe to be false. Instead, the statement was read to students by a school administrator.

The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit on behalf of eleven parents contending that the school board policy violates the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. A hearing ([[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District|Kitzmiller et al. v. Dover Area School District]]) in Federal District Court was scheduled for September 2005.

The school board claims there are "gaps" in evolution, which it emphasizes is a theory rather than established fact, and that students have a right to consider other views on the origins of life. The  school board claims it does not teach intelligent design but simply makes students aware of its existence as an alternative to evolution. It denies intelligent design is "religion in disguise," despite being represented in court by the [[Thomas More Law Center]], a [[Christian right|conservative Christian]] nonprofit which says it uses litigation to promote "the religious freedom of Christians and time-honored family values."

The Discovery Institute's John West said the case displayed the ACLU's "Orwellian" effort to stifle scientific discourse and objected to the issue being decided in court. "''It's a disturbing prospect that the outcome of this lawsuit could be that the court will try to tell scientists what is legitimate scientific inquiry and what is not," West said. "That is a flagrant assault on free speech.''" Opponents, represented by the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] and the National Association of Biology Teachers contend that his statement is not just ironic, but hypocritical, considering that the Discovery Institute not only tries to tell scientists and academics what is legitimate scientific inquiry and what is not (in disputing philosophical naturalism), but as a matter of policy seeks to redefine what constitutes legitimate science.

In May, 2005, the publisher of &lt;cite&gt;[[Of Pandas and People]]&lt;/cite&gt;, the [[Foundation for Thought and Ethics]] (FTE), filed a motion seeking to intervene in the case. FTE argued that a ruling that "intelligent design" was religious would have severe financial consequences, citing possible losses in the neighborhood of half a million dollars. By intervening, FTE would have become a co-defendant with the Dover Area School Board, and able to bring its own lawyers and expert witnesses to the case. FTE's president Jon Buell implied that if allowed to intervene, FTE would bring [[William A. Dembski]] and [[Stephen C. Meyer]] as expert witnesses. In his decision on the motion, Judge [[John E. Jones III]] ruled that FTE was not entitled to intervene in the case because its motion to intervene was not timely, describing FTE's excuses for not trying to become involved earlier as "both unavailing and disingenuous." Judge Jones also held that FTE failed to demonstrate that it has "a significantly protectable interest in the litigation warranting intervention as a party" and that its interests will not be adequately represented by the defendants.

In a November 2005 election the citizens of Dover voted out their pro-intelligent design schoolboard.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5006228 Intelligent Design Candidates Voted Out in Penn.]. This event prompted [[Pat Robertson]] on his [[700 Club]] broadcast to announce that the people of Dover had lost their protection from God: "''I'd like to say to the good citizens of Dover. If there is a disaster in your area, don’t turn to God, you just rejected Him from your city. And don’t wonder why He hasn't helped you when problems begin, if they begin. I'm not saying they will, but if they do, just remember, you just voted God out of your city. And if that’s the case, don’t ask for His help because he might not be there.''"

On December 20, 2005, U.S. District Judge [[John E. Jones III]], in his 139-page ruling on [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]], struck down the school board's policy requiring a statement be read endorsing intelligent design as an alternative to evolution in 9th grade high school biology classes. In his ruling Jones wrote that intelligent design is not science and is essentially religious in nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pamd.uscourts.gov/kitzmiller/kitzmiller_342.pdf Opinion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051221144316/http://www.pamd.uscourts.gov/kitzmiller/kitzmiller_342.pdf |date=2005-12-21 }}, [[Kitzmiller v.

=====2006 Ohio - Proposed Template for Ohio Teachers=====
A 2006 proposal before the Ohio Board of Education drafted by Conservative Board member Colleen Grady, would create a "template" based on the Discovery Institute's [[Critical Analysis of Evolution]] lesson plan for use by 10th-grade science teachers for classroom discussions evolution, global warming, stem-cell research and cloning.&lt;ref name = "auscs"&gt;[http://www.au.org/site/News2?abbr=pr&amp;page=NewsArticle&amp;id=8339&amp;security=1002&amp;news_iv_ctrl=1241 Ohio School Board Members Are Considering New Assault On Teaching Of Evolution, Charges Americans United] Americans United for Separation of Church and State, July 12, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Grady's proposal was widely regarded as an attempt to circumvent the board's February 2006 vote to retract a controversial model lesson plan and to remove the indicator on which it was based from the standards; the indicator, which called for students to be able to "describe how scientists continue to investigate and critically analyze aspects of evolutionary theory," was generally criticized as providing a pretext for instilling scientifically unwarranted doubts about evolution.

Critics have noted that Grady's proposal will allow for the introduction of intelligent design in public schools, although the executive director of the Intelligent Design Network of Ohio, Roddy Bullock, says that the template would merely permit criticism of evolution, via a [[Teach the Controversy]] approach. However, in noting that the purpose of the template is to "open up these topics to different points of view, to different lines of evidence, to different interpretations of the evidence, to give students a more objective approach to science education," and given that outside of creationism and intelligent design there are no alternatives to evolution, various groups such as [[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]] are in opposition to the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wdcmedia.com/newsArticle.php?ID=1522 WDC Media] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060807172134/http://www.wdcmedia.com/newsArticle.php?ID=1522 |date=2006-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, on July 11, Americans United for Separation of Church and State filed a request under the Ohio open records law asking for copies of the Grady proposal as well as all documents and correspondence by the Board of Education and the Department of Education relating to proposed changes to the state’s science standards.  The group's executive director, Rev. Barry W. Lynn, urged the Ohio board to reject any effort to reopen the dispute over science education, noting

Representative Mike Lott (R-District 104) introduced House Bill 625 on January 9, 2007.  If enacted the bill would "authorize local school boards to allow for the teaching of creationism or intelligent design."&lt;ref&gt;[https://billstatus.ls.state.ms.us/documents/2007/pdf/HB/0600-0699/HB0625IN.pdf Mississippi House Bill 625] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810221220/http://billstatus.ls.state.ms.us/documents/2007/pdf/HB/0600-0699/HB0625IN.pdf |date=2014-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lott was quoted as saying,  "The school board of a school district may allow the teaching of creationism or intelligent design in the schools within the district.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncseweb.org/news/2007/01/antievolution-bill-mississippi-001105 Antievolution bill in Mississippi], [[National Center for Science Education]], 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However, if the theory of evolution is required to be taught as part of the school district's science curriculum, in order to provide students with a comprehensive education in science, the school board also must include the teaching of creationism or intelligent design in the science curriculum". Similar bills to include the teaching of creationism and intelligent design in public classrooms were submitted in 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncseweb.org/news/2009/01/antievolution-legislation-mississippi-003688 Antievolution legislation in Mississippi House], [[National Center for Science Education]], January 9th, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; None were adopted.

=====2009 Florida Senate Bill=====
In February 2009 Senator [[Stephen R. Wise]] announced that he was sponsoring plans to introduce a bill requiring teachers who teach evolution to also discuss the idea of intelligent design.&lt;ref name=Wisebill&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jacksonville.com/news/metro/2009-02-08/story/wise_to_introduce_intelligent_design_bill |title=Wise to introduce bill on intelligent design &amp;#124; Jacksonville.com |author=Matt Soergel |date=February 8, 2009 |publisher=The Florida Times-Union. |accessdate=2009-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RadioTampa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmnf.org/news_stories/scientists-oppose-intelligent-design-bill |title=WMNF 88.5 FM Community Radio, Tampa |author=Seán Kinane |date=2009-02-23 |accessdate=2009-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090808034345/http://www.wmnf.org/news_stories/scientists-oppose-intelligent-design-bill |archivedate=2009-08-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Intelligent design lawsuits ====

=====The Dover trial=====
{{main|Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District}}
In 2005, the constitutionality of presenting intelligent design in public high school science classes as a valid scientific alternative to evolution was considered by the court in [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]], the "Dover trial." There plaintiffs successfully argued that intelligent design is a form of creationism, and that the school board policy requiring the presentation of intelligent design as an alternative to [[evolution]] as an "explanation of the origin of life" thus violated the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. In his ruling, the judge found that intelligent design is not science and is essentially religious in nature&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/6:Curriculum, Conclusion|Ruling]], [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]], Case No. 04cv2688. December 20, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and that "ID’s backers have sought to avoid the scientific scrutiny, which we have now determined that it cannot withstand, by advocating that the ''controversy'', but not ID itself, should be taught in science class. This tactic is at best disingenuous, and at worst a canard. The goal of the IDM is not to encourage critical thought, but to foment a revolution which would supplant evolutionary theory with ID."&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/4:Whether ID Is Science#Page 89 of 139|Ruling, Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District, page 89]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====2005 University of California at Berkeley suit=====
In October 2005, the [[National Science Foundation]] and the [[University of California, Berkeley]]’s Museum of Paleontology  were sued by intelligent design proponents for running a website for school teachers called 'Understanding Evolution'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://evolution.berkeley.edu/ Understanding Evolution]&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit was brought by Jeanne Caldwell and Larry Caldwell, the husband and wife founders of the anti-evolution, pro-intelligent design group [[Quality Science Education for All]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2005/10/18/evolution Another Attack on Evolution] Inside Higher Ed, October 18, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The Caldwells argued that University of California was "taking a position on evolution and attempting to persuade minor students to accept that position." Michael R. Smith, the assistant chancellor for legal affairs at Berkeley, said that the university would defend the lawsuit "with vigor and enthusiasm."

The suit alleged that a university-maintained webpage&lt;ref&gt;[http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/misconceps/IVAandreligion.shtml Misconception: "Evolution and religion are incompatible."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813221449/http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/misconceps/IVAandreligion.shtml |date=2006-08-13 }} points to a [[National Center for Science Education]] The University of California Museum of Paleontology, Berkeley webpage&lt;/ref&gt; that contains statements from 17 religious organizations endorsing the teaching of evolution&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncseweb.org/media/voices/religion Statements from Religious Organizations] National Center for Science Education&lt;/ref&gt;  and in so doing violated the  [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|separation of church and state]]. The Caldwells objected specifically to one web page that says it's a misconception that science and religion are incompatible.

"Basically, what we have is a page that deals with the misconceptions and challenges to the teaching of evolution, and we provided resources to teachers to answer them," said Roy Caldwell. "One of those questions is, 'Aren't religion and evolution incompatible?' and we say, 'no,' and point to a number of sites by clerics and others who make that point."&lt;ref name=suit_dismissed&gt;[http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2006/03/15_evolution.shtml Court dismisses lawsuit targeting evolution website] Robert Sanders. UCBerkeley News March 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The plaintiffs alleged that these statements constituted a preference for certain religious viewpoints in violation of the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]].  The suit was dismissed 13 March 2006 when judge granted the University of California's motion to dismiss the case on the grounds that the plaintiffs lacked [[Standing (law)|standing]].&lt;ref name=suit_dismissed/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7329">The '''International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science''' is an international scientific [[learned society]] covering all applications of [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] to [[chemistry]] and [[chemical physics]]. It was created in [[Menton]] in 1967. The founding members were [[Raymond Daudel]], [[Per-Olov Löwdin]], [[Robert G. Parr]], [[John Pople]] and [[Bernard Pullman]]. Its foundation was supported by [[Louis de Broglie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Advances in the Theory of Atomic and Molecular Systems: Conceptual and Computational Advances in Quantum Chemistry |edition=illustrated |first1=Piotr |last1=Piecuch |first2=Jean |last2=Maruani |first3=Gerardo |last3=Delgado-Barrio, |first4=Stephen |last4=Wilson |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |year=2009 |isbn=978-90-481-2596-8 |page=4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1qbgc17K1dAC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=1qbgc17K1dAC&amp;pg=PA4 Extract of page 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally the Academy had 25 regular members under 65 years of age. This was later raised to 30, and  then to 35. There is no limit on the number of members over 65 years of age. The  members are "chosen among the scientists of all countries who have distinguished themselves by the value of their scientific work, their role of pioneer or leader of a school in the broad field of [[quantum chemistry]], i.e. the application of [[quantum mechanics]] to the study of [[molecule]]s and [[macromolecule]]s".&lt;ref name=IQAMS/&gt; The Academy presently consists of 90 members (as of 2006). The Academy organizes the [[International Congress of Quantum Chemistry]] every three years.

The academy awards a medal to a young member of the scientific community who has distinguished himself or herself by a pioneering and important contribution. The award has been made every year since 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaqms.org/awards.php IAQMS awards] Assessed March 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jane Kim''' (born 1981) is an American painter, [[Biological illustration|science illustrator]] and the founder of the Ink Dwell studio. She is best known for her large-scale murals, created with the purpose of promoting advocacy of the natural world.

== Biography ==
Kim studied at [[Rhode Island School of Design|Rhode Island School of Design (RISD)]] and received her B.F.A. in printmaking in 2003, then attended [[California State University, Monterey Bay]] to study scientific illustration, graduating in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = News: Protecting Endangered Species|url = http://www.risd.edu/about/news/protecting_the_earth/|website = Rhode Island School of Design (RISD)|accessdate = 2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.gnsi.org/event/meeting/gnsi-dc-painting-walls-art-and-illustrations-jane-kim|title = Painting on Walls: The Art and Illustrations of Jane Kim|date = 2015-11-01|accessdate = 2015-12-27|website = Guild of Natural Science Illustrators (GNSI)|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Kim started the process of creating the ''Migrating Mural,'' a series of six murals featuring [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] [[bighorn sheep]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Conservation Art: Jane Kim's Migrating Murals|url = http://blogs.sierraclub.org/explore/2013/03/conservation-through-art-wildlife-muralist-jane-kim.html|website = Sierra|accessdate = 2015-12-28|language = en-US|publisher = The Sierra Club|last = Pandika|first = Melissa}}&lt;/ref&gt; The murals span 120 miles of California’s [[U.S. Route 395|Highway 395]]. Fundraising for the project took place on the crowd funding platform, [[Kickstarter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Saving Nature Through Art: Jane Kim and Her Migrating Murals|url = http://www.7x7.com/arts-culture/saving-nature-through-art-jane-kim-and-her-migrating-murals|website = 7x7 Magazine|accessdate = 2015-12-28|date = 2012-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kim was a featured artist in the Facebook Artist Residency program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Facebook ‘Likes’ Art|url = http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/05/14/facebook-likes-art.html|website = The Daily Beast|date = 2014-05-14|accessdate = 2015-12-28|first = Ann|last = Binlot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work is located in a Facebook campus stairwell featuring graphic portraits of local, native birds and a second mural with illustrations of the local Facebook campus foxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Art and the Corporate Life: Facebook Artist in Residence Program|url = http://www.artbusiness.com/facebook-artist-in-residence-program.html|website = Art Business|accessdate = 2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Up in the AIR: How will tech residencies reshape Bay Area art?|url = http://rhizome.org/editorial/2015/jan/20/tech-companies-artist-residency-programs-bay-area/|website = Rhizome|accessdate = 2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Johanna Jachmann-Wagner.jpg|thumb|Johanna Jachmann-Wagner, as Ortrud in the opera ''Lohengrin'' by [[Richard Wagner]], c. 1860]]
'''Johanna Jachmann-Wagner''' or '''Johanna Wagner''' (13 October 1828&lt;ref&gt;{{Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie|40|587|589|Wagner-Jachmann, Johanna|Max Friedlaender|ADB:Wagner-Jachmann, Johanna}}&lt;/ref&gt; – 16 October 1894) was a [[mezzo-soprano]] singer, tragédienne in theatrical drama, and teacher of singing and theatrical performance who won great distinction in Europe during the third quarter of the 19th century. She was a niece of the composer [[Richard Wagner]] and was the original performer, and in some respects the inspiration, of the character of Elisabeth in ''[[Tannhäuser (opera)|Tannhäuser]]''. She was also the original intended performer of Brünnhilde in ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'', but in the event assumed other roles.

== Early career ==
Johanna Wagner was born in [[Seelze]], [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]]. She was the natural daughter of a soldier named Bock von Wülfingen, and was adopted&lt;ref&gt;''[[Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', 5th ed, 1954, Vol. X (Supplementary), p. 472&lt;/ref&gt; by Albert Wagner (1799–1874) (eldest brother of Richard) and his wife Elise (1800–1864). They had two other daughters. From Seelze the family moved to [[Würzburg]] in 1830, where both parents worked in the Royal Bavarian Theatre, father being an actor, singer and stage-manager. She received piano lessons from her mother, a Roman Catholic, and sang duets with the Landgräfin of Hessen, who took singing lessons from her father. Richard Wagner visited in 1833 (while composing ''[[Die Feen]]'') and often accompanied her singing [[Carl Loewe]]'s ballad "Edward". Johanna knew the young [[Marie Seebach]] (later wife of Wagnerian singer [[Albert Niemann (tenor)|Albert Niemann]]), who attended the same confirmation class.

She showed aptitude for the stage as a child. Owing to poor health she went to stay with her aunt Christine Gley, a singer and mother of the Vienna actress {{Interlanguage link multi|Julie Rettich|de}} (1809–1866). In 1842 she accepted a contract as actress at [[Bernburg]] and [[Ballenstedt]], and her father undertook her training as a singer. After appearing as a page in the new opera ''[[Les Huguenots]]'' at Ballenstedt, she began to give concerts with much success. In Bernburg she gained favourable notice by standing in to take the role of [[Les Huguenots|Marguerite de Valois]] in a performance attended by Duke Leopold.&lt;ref&gt;H. Jachmann, ''Wagner and his first Elisabeth'', English edition translated by M.A. Trechman (Novello &amp; Co., London 1944), pp. 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The managing director moved his company to [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] during the summer, and Johanna studied [[Friedrich Schiller]] roles for the theatre, and operatic roles with her father in [[Daniel Auber]]'s ''[[Le maçon|Maurer und Schlosser]]'', [[Albert Lortzing]]'s ''[[Der Wildschütz]]'' and in ''[[Don Giovanni]]''. Her first important operatic appearance was as Catherina Cornaro in [[Fromental Halévy]]'s ''[[La reine de Chypre]]''. In May 1844 Richard Wagner arranged an audition for her at the [[Semperoper|Dresden Royal Opera]], where she gave guest appearances in these operas and received a three-year contract, being engaged as a Royal Saxon ''[[Kammersänger]]in'' before the age of 18.

== Dresden and Paris ==
At the time of her arrival in 1844, Dresden had recently witnessed the world premieres of ''[[Rienzi]]'' (1842) and ''[[The Flying Dutchman (opera)|Der fliegende Holländer]]'' (1843), and the singers [[Josef Tichatschek]] (tenor, the first Rienzi)), the baritone [[Anton Mitterwurzer]], bass {{Interlanguage link multi|Wilhelm Georg Dettmer|de}}, and the celebrated [[dramatic soprano]] [[Wilhelmine Schröder-Devrient]] (the original Adriano and Senta) were the principals with whom she worked. The latter (whom Johanna had first met in Ballenstedt) was an especially inspiring example, and Tichatschek became a lifelong friend. She also befriended [[Ferdinand Heine]], an actor with great knowledge of theatrical costume, and Countess Helene Kaminska, who made several portraits of her.

Johanna studied several roles with her uncle, especially Irene in ''Rienzi'', and as her family moved to the city they became part of Richard Wagner's circle there. As he was now composing ''[[Tannhäuser (opera)|Tannhäuser]]'', following his new musical conceptions, Johanna and Tichatschek sang the music of Elisabeth and Tannhäuser for him as it evolved. He had intended to premiere the opera to mark her 17th birthday, 13 October 1845, but she was ill, which forced its postponement for six days.{{Sfn|Grove|1889|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=2FAoAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA345 Wagner, Johanna p.&amp;nbsp;345]}}&lt;ref&gt;''Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians''. 5th ed., 1954&lt;/ref&gt; The first performance, on 19 October, a six-hour staging beside Devrient as Venus, and with Dettmer and Mitterwurzer, was followed by a shortened version, with altogether eight repeats by the following January.

In 1846, after singing excerpts from [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]]'s ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice|Orpheus]]'' in concert, with financial support from the [[List of rulers of Saxony|King of Saxony]] she left for Paris to study with [[Manuel Patricio Rodríguez García]] (and/or with [[Pauline García-Viardot]]) for whom she sang Agathe's first aria in ''[[Der Freischütz]]'' to audition. After hearing [[Giulia Grisi]] as ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]'' she studied the role with him (in Italian), and also Valentine in ''[[Les Huguenots]]'' (in French), though his attempt to teach her [[The Barber of Seville|Rosina]] met with less success. He suggested she should sing in Paris: she declined, but while there she saw [[Frédéric Chopin]] play, saw [[Rachel (actress)|Rachel]] as [[Jean Racine]]'s [[Phèdre]], and [[François Habeneck|Habeneck]] conduct [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)|7th Symphony]]. At the end of the year she returned to Dresden, to perform Norma and Valentine, under a new contract.

== Hamburg, Berlin and touring ==
The [[May Uprising in Dresden|Dresden revolution of 1848/49]], which resulted in Richard Wagner's exile and Mme Schröder-Devrient's temporary imprisonment, found Johanna singing in Hamburg, as [[Les Huguenots|Valentine]] and [[Fidelio|Leonore]]. Dresden vacillated so she accepted a contract at Hamburg where, as Fides in ''[[Le prophète]]'' she attracted [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]]'s attention. He brought her to [[Berlin State Opera]] to sing it for her début there in May 1851, which she followed (June 1851) with [[Don Giovanni|Donna Anna]], [[Oberon|Reiza]] and a repeat of Fides. She also sang Fides in Vienna in 1850. Her Hamburg obligations discharged, she brought her famous interpretation of Bellini's [[I Capuleti e i Montecchi|Romeo]] to Berlin with great success.

In May 1852 Johanna accepted an invitation from [[Benjamin Lumley]] to sing at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]] in London. However the [[Royal Opera House]] management ([[Frederick Gye]]) sought to tempt her away, an offer which Albert Wagner (always Johanna's agent) accepted. In the ensuing row, including two famous [[lawsuit]]s and [[Equity (law)|equitable proceedings]] – ''[[Lumley v Gye]]'' and ''[[Lumley v Wagner]]'' – Albert Wagner offended [[Henry Chorley|H. F. Chorley]] and others by a widely quoted remark (from private correspondence which was produced in court) that "one only ''could'' go to England to get money":&lt;ref&gt;H.F. Chorley, ''Thirty Years' Musical Recollections'' (Hurst and Blackett, London 1862), Vol. II, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;id=PoAQAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22henry+fothergill+chorley%22&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=ewKVODvQh7&amp;sig=HBifqHKaFT4Tmvg7fpi1Ll4rO40&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Wagner&amp;f=false p. 177].&lt;/ref&gt; and Johanna went home without singing at all. However she returned in June and July 1856 (to Her Majesty's) and appeared repeatedly in her best roles, beginning (14 June) as Romeo, and then in ''[[Lucrezia Borgia]]'', Gluck's ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice]]'' and [[Gioachino Rossini]]'s ''[[Tancredi]]''. She gave a Court concert, after which [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] broke her rule and attended this theatre to hear her on stage.

In 1856 she sang in [[Weimar]] under [[Franz Liszt]]'s direction, as Orfeo, Romeo, Lucrezia Borgia, in Gluck's ''[[Iphigénie en Tauride]]'', and in concert. After a Romeo she was given a standing ovation by the orchestra and crowned with a laurel wreath, and she had to give repeat performances for the Grand Duke and Duchess. Liszt, whose interest was not only musical, presented her with his portrait. Throughout the 1850s she sang repeatedly at Cologne, and at [[Stettin]]. In 1858 she made a debut at Leipzig, as Lucrezia, and performed Romeo, ''Tancredi'', ''Tannhäuser'' and ''Orfeo'', before going on to Dresden, where she rejoiced to sing ''Tannhäuser'' again with Tichatschek and Mitterwurzer.

Wagner, not then on friendly terms with Johanna, had intended her for his Brünnhilde in early plans for the [[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Nibelungen operas]], but it was in [[Heinrich Dorn]]'s opera ''[[Die Nibelungen (opera)|Die Nibelungen]]'' at Berlin, during Richard's exile, that she performed the role of this name. She also made some effect in the little-known ''Macbeth'' of [[Wilhelm Taubert]], as Lady Macbeth. However, it was in the Berlin premieres of ''Tannhäuser'', in January 1856, that she rediscovered her place in Richard's pantheon, with such success that permission was also granted for the (belated) first Berlin production of ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'' in 1859, with Johanna as Ortrud. She also trained [[Luise Harriers-Wippern]] (1826–1878) as Elsa. For these productions {{Interlanguage link multi|Botho von Hülsen|de}} was the manager, Albert Wagner the stage-manager and (in ''Lohengrin'') Wilhelm Taubert the conductor.

== A new career ==
In May 1859 Johanna married Alfred Jachmann of [[Königsberg]], diplomat, of an eminent [[Prussia]]n family whom she had assisted financially at the collapse of their interests in 1858. Her first daughter was born in March 1860. After a very busy and triumphant tour of German towns in 1860 and a visit to [[Warsaw]] in rebellion (where she was first hissed, and then sang under police protection), she decided to make her farewell from the opera stage and to continue her career as a tragédienne. Her contract renegotiated, she studied the role of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]'s [[Iphigenia in Tauris (Goethe)|Iphigenie]] under the guidance of {{Interlanguage link multi|Auguste Crelinger|de}}, the actress whose mantle she was to inherit, and performed it in September 1861 at the Royal Theatre, Berlin, for [[Queen Augusta]]'s birthday, and soon afterwards was [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s ''[[Mary Stuart (play)|Mary Stuart]]'', and Countess Orsina in ''[[Emilia Galotti]]''.

She now took the name Johanna Jachmann-Wagner for her new career. She was soon compared to [[Fanny Janauschek]], the dramatic power of her performances giving hope of a rebirth of the German classic drama. Having sung at the coronation concert at Königsberg, her operatic farewell was as Orfeo in December 1861, but she repeated it at a centenary performance in October 1862. She did however continue to sing in various German towns through the 1860s, notably in concert and recital, in the performance of [[lied]]er. She made a return visit to Würzburg in 1866. From 1861 to 1869 she lived part of each year at Berlin and part at [[Trutnowy|Trutenau]]. In 1868 and 1869 she gave the first performances of two dramas, ''Phädra'' and ''Catharina Voisin'' by "Georg Conrad", the pen-name of [[Prince George of Prussia]]. Her performances as Goethe's Iphigenie and in the classical drama, as Phädra and ([[Sophocles]]') [[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]] became particularly her own. Her retirement became necessary after a paralysis of one side of her face, which occurred in 1869. After her dramatic farewells in 1871 and 1872, eulogised by [[Theodor Fontane]], she was awarded a gold medal by the Emperor.

== Bayreuth and after ==
In May 1872 Johanna fulfilled a promise to her uncle Richard Wagner, singing [[alto]] in the solo quartet in the performance of Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|9th Symphony]] at the foundation-stone laying of the [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus]]. She also participated in the first [[Bayreuth Festival]] of 1876, taking the role of Schwertleite in ''[[Die Walküre]]'' and First Norn in ''[[Götterdämmerung]]'' in the original first full production of ''Der Ring des Nibelungen''. She was not now capable of Brünnhild as originally intended, but as the Valkyr, her dramatic control of the scenes, and the energy she infused into them, in rehearsal and performance, realised the composer's true intentions, and set a precedent which was later imitated. Her Norn similarly was invested with her full dramatic resources.

Alfred Jachmann's fortune crashed again after the [[Franco-Prussian War]], and at Würzburg Johanna, with her pension from the Berlin Hochspielhaus,{{clarify|date=February 2015}} continued her work as a singing teacher, and retained the friendship of kings and princes which she had long held. Her last public performance was at Würzburg in scenes from ''Orfeo'' in 1882. She moved then to Munich, where, in close contact with the Royal Court Theatre, she accepted the post of instructor in singing at the Royal Conservatoire of Music and the title Professor. [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]] presented her with a free seat in the Munich opera, and invited her to a private performance of ''[[Parsifal]]'' in his own theatre. She had many pupils, but, eventually dissatisfied with Munich, she returned to Berlin in 1888 and continued to teach, arranging public concerts for her pupils. She died in [[Würzburg]] of heart illness three days after her 66th birthday.

== Descriptions of her voice ==
A London reviewer is quoted to have written, "Her range comprises the soft female loveliness of a [[soprano]] and is equally fine in the low tones of a [[contralto]]. On each occasion that a peculiarly fine change from one range to another was accomplished by this incomparable singer the effect was as overwhelming as it was unexpected... Deceit, passion, love, fear and despair were expressed in each note."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted as from the London ''Morning Advertiser'' (of 1856, exact date not given) in Jachmann, trans. Trechman, ''Wagner and his first Elisabeth'', p. 40, where the words have been translated into German and then back into English (without reference to the original).&lt;/ref&gt; Another is quoted: "She is one of those rare artists who fills the stage with her attractive personality. ... her voice is one of the rarest beauty. One feels inclined to say that she is a soprano, but her range is so wide that the full tone covers three registers, from the high soprano to the alto range. Certainly no living singer can be compared in fullness of tone to Johanna Wagner."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted as from the London ''Morning Post'' (of 1856, exact date not given) in Jachmann, trans. Trechman, ''Wagner and his first Elisabeth'', p. 40, where the words have been translated into German and then back into English (without reference to the original).&lt;/ref&gt;

H.F. Chorley, embittered by Albert Wagner's national insult, found little to like in Johanna: "Considered as a singer, the claims of Mademoiselle Wagner were very meagre. She must have had originally a fine ''[[mezzo soprano]]'' voice. She can never have learned how to produce, or how to use it. Whether as ''Romeo'', or ''Tancredi'', or ''Lucrezia Borgia'', the insubordinate toughness of the organ could not be concealed. Though she dashed at every difficulty, with an intrepidity only to be found in German singers, none was, in very deed, mastered.'&lt;ref&gt;Chorley, ''Thirty Years' Musical Recollections'', Vol. II, pp. 242-47.&lt;/ref&gt; Chorley, however, had no liking for German stagecraft, which he considered mannered and formulaic, nor for German theatrical singing, which he called "tasteless declamation accompanied by an orchestra".

On the other hand, [[Benjamin Lumley]] wrote of her 1856 appearance as ''Romeo'' in terms that make one imagine the Brünnhilde she ought to have been: "She appeared: tall, stately, self-possessed, clothed in glittering gilded mail, with her fine fair hair flung in masses upon her neck: a superb air that seemed to give full earnest of victory, and a step revealing innate majesty and grandeur in every movement... She sang! The sonorous voice, which heralded the mission of the young warrior to his enemies, rang through the house as penetrating and awakening as the summons of a clarion."&lt;ref&gt;B. Lumley, ''Reminiscences of the Opera'' (Hurst and Blackett, London 1864), [https://books.google.nl/books?id=q04PAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=nl&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 382]. The quotation of this passage in Jachmann, trans. Trechman, ''Wagner and his first Elisabeth'', pp. 39-40, has lost the force of the original.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph Plumb Cochran,''' [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] (January 14, 1855, [[Urmia]], [[Iran]] &amp;ndash; August 18, 1905, [[Urmia]], [[Iran]]), was an [[United States|American]] [[Presbyterian]] missionary. He is credited as the founding father of [[Iran]]'s first modern [[Medical college|Medical School]].&lt;ref&gt;This short biography relies thankfully on a paper by Esmail Yourdshahian, MSc, Farrokh Ghavam, MD, and Mohhamad-Hassan Ansari, PhD, from Urmia University of Medical Sciences, Urmia, Iran. For details see '''References''' below.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Joseph Cochran's father, the Reverend Joseph Gallup Cochran (1817-1871), and his mother, Deborah Wilber Plumb (1820-1893), were first-generation American missionaries who traveled to Iran in 1848. They settled in Urmia, Western [[Azarbaijan]], Iran, home to the people of the ancient culture of [[Urartu]] and of one of the earliest Christian churches, the [[Assyrian Church of the East]]. The family devoted their missionary zeal to the well-being of the local population, many of whom were devout Christians.

The young Joseph was one of the eight children of Cochran's family. He had a happy childhood in the company of his large family and friends. He learnt the local [[Syriac language|Assyrian]], [[Azarbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] and [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], in addition to [[English language|English]] and [[Persian language|Persian]]. He left for [[United States of America|America]] as a teenager in 1868, staying in Buffalo, N.Y. with the family of Stephen Mallory Clement (1825-1892), the father of [[Stephen Merrell Clement]], who was to help finance not only Joseph Cochran's education, but also his hospital. He studied medicine at [[New York Medical College]], from where he graduated in 1876. Subsequently he did two years of practical hospital work in [[surgery]], [[infectious diseases]] and [[gynecology]]. During a travel to [[Minnesota]] he met his future wife, Katherine Hale.

==Medical Career in Urmia==
[[File:Joseph Plumb Cochran 1.jpg|alt=Dr Joseph Plumb Cochran working in a Christian mission in Urmia, Iran in the 1890s|thumb|Dr Joseph Plumb Cochran working in a Christian mission in Urmia, Iran in the 1890s]]
The young couple went to Iran in 1878. Upon their arrival in Urmia they surveyed the medical and health needs of the community and found the existing small health clinic, which was working under the auspices of the Iranian [[Red Lion and Sun Society]], inadequate. On Joseph's earnest request, the Board of Assyrian Missionary purchased a 15-[[hectare]] garden which was soon to become the site of a 100-bed hospital, named ''Westminster Hospital'', after the church in Buffalo, N.Y. that was the vehicle for supporting Dr. Cochran's work. The building of this hospital was completed within one year from its original planning and the hospital opened its doors in 1879.

Cochran resolved the problem of shortage in the local medical professionals by establishing a modern Medical School, the first of its kind in Iran. For this purpose he erected a wooden building, which included a research laboratory, near the hospital, where the future medical personnel were to be trained. Remarkably, this original wooden building, near the present-day Urmia Medical School, is still intact. An adjoining maternity hospital was built later, for which the required medical equipment arrived from America. 
 
According to the information provided by the official website of [[Urmia University]],&lt;ref&gt;University of Urmia, Western Azarbaijan, Iran: ''About University'' (in Persian). {{cite web |url=http://www.urmia.ac.ir/main/History.aspx?code=8 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080701120555/http://www.urmia.ac.ir/Main/History.aspx?code=8 |archivedate=2008-07-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Cochran has been [the first] director of the Medical School in Urmia, established in 1878. In the course of Cochran's 27 years of directorship, 26 medical students graduated from this School. This School was closed on Joseph Cochran's death in 1905 and remained in this state until sixty years later when it was opened as one of several Schools of Urmia University. The historical archives of Urmia University is in the possession of documents that show that [[Mozaffareddin Shah|Mozaffar al-Din Shah Qajar]] and Joseph Cochran have personally signed and handed certificates to graduating students during the graduation ceremony of 1898 (1277 [[Iranian calendar|AH]]).

During the above-mentioned period, Joseph Cochran was joined by other American medical doctors, including Dr Wright, Dr Homlz, Dr van Norden, and Dr Miller, who remained permanently in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Unfortunately the full names of these individuals were not available at the time of this writing.&lt;/ref&gt; Their resting places are in Urmia.

Joseph Cochran died in Urmia at the age of 50, on 18 August 1905, on the second floor of his wooden house in the Medical School. His death was mourned by many. According to reports, his funeral was attended by tens of thousands people. He was buried in the Assyrian Missionary Cemetery located on the side of ''Seer Mountain'' in Urmia facing his wooden house, close to the resting places of his wife Catherine and her parents. His epitaph reads: "''He came not to be ministered unto, but to minister.''" &lt;ref&gt;"''Not so shall it be among you: but whosoever would become great among you shall be your minister; and whosoever would be first among you shall be your servant: even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.''" (Matthew 20:26-28).&lt;/ref&gt;

His son, Joseph P. Cochran, Jr, returning to Iran in 1920, followed in his father's footsteps through his services in the American Mission Hospital. His daughter, Dorothy Cochran-Romson, served for a short time as a missionary nurse in [[Tabriz]] capital [[East Azerbaijan]] Province in Iran.

The '''Kids' Lit Quiz''' is an annual [[literature]] competition, in which teams of four students, aged 10 to 13, work together to answer wide-ranging literary questions.  The winning team from each region competes in the national final. The winner of the national final is then invited to the World Final held annually in July or August. Since its inception in 1991, thousands of students have participated each year throughout the world.

The quiz was created by Wayne Mills, a former educator at the [[University of Auckland]], who wears a purple and black hat while hosting this literary quiz. In 2008 Wayne Mills was given the [[Storylines Margaret Mahy Medal and Lecture Award]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.storylines.org.nz/awards.asp?pid=56 Storylines: Margaret Mahy Medal]&lt;/ref&gt; to recognize his achievement in establishing the Kids' Lit Quiz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sla.org.uk/blg-margaret-mahy-medal.php School Library Association: "Margaret Mahy Medal for KLQ quizmaster" ]&lt;/ref&gt; He was made a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the Queen's New Year's Honours in 2011 for meritorious services to education, specifically children's literature. In August 2018 he was granted Life Membership of Storyline’s Children’s Literature Trust and Foundation.

In 2003 the quiz was brought to the UK where over 400 schools currently participate in the heats leading to the world final.This pattern is repeated in different countries around the world.

The Kids' Lit Quiz motivates and inspires children to read a wide range of children's literature for pleasure from the classics to the contemporary, from nursery rhymes to comics, and from folk tales to myths. It offers children rewards they may not otherwise experience in the classroom setting. 

Currently the quiz takes place in New Zealand, the United Kingdom, South Africa, Nigeria, Canada, United States of America, Australia, Hong Kong, Thailand, Indonesia and Singapore. Singapore was the first country in Asia to have the quiz.

'''Linear-on-the-fly testing''', often referred to as LOFT, is a method of delivering educational or professional examinations.  Competing methods include traditional linear fixed-form delivery and [[computerized adaptive testing]].  LOFT is a compromise between the two, in an effort to maintain the equivalence of the set of items that each examinee sees, which is found in fixed-form delivery, while attempting to reduce item exposure and enhance test security.

Fixed-form delivery, which most people are familiar with, entails the testing organization determining one or several fixed sets of items to be delivered together.  For example, suppose the test contains 100 items, and the organization wished for two forms.   Two forms are published with a fixed set of 100 items each, some of which should overlap to enable [[equating]].  All examinees that take the test are given one of the two forms.

If this exam is high volume, meaning that there is a large number of examinees, the security of the examination could be in jeopardy.  Many of the test items would become well known in the population of examinees.  To offset this, more forms would be needed; if there were eight forms, not as many examinees would see each item.

LOFT takes this to an extreme, and attempts to construct a unique exam for each candidate, within the given constraints of the testing program.  Rather than publishing a fixed set of items, a large pool of items is delivered to the [[computer]] on which the examinee is taking the exam.  Also delivered is a computer program to [[pseudorandom generator|pseudo-randomly select]] items so that every examinee will receive a test that is equivalent with respect to content and [[statistical]] characteristics,&lt;ref&gt; Luecht, R.M. (2005). Some Useful Cost-Benefit Criteria for Evaluating Computer-based Test Delivery Models and Systems. ''Journal of Applied Testing Technology'', 7(2). {{cite web |url=http://www.testpublishers.org/Documents/JATT2005_rev_Criteria4CBT_RMLuecht_Apr2005.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927064953/http://www.testpublishers.org/Documents/JATT2005_rev_Criteria4CBT_RMLuecht_Apr2005.pdf |archivedate=2006-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; although composed of a different set of items.  This is usually done with [[item response theory]].

[[File:Louise Archer.jpg|thumb|Louise Archer]]
'''Louise A. Reeves Archer''' (October 23, 1893 – April 1, 1948) was an American teacher and [[activist]] who fought to educate [[African Americans]] during the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lva.virginia.gov/public/vawomen/2013/honoree.htm?bio=Archer|title=Virginia Women in History 2013 Louise A. Reeves Archer|website=www.lva.virginia.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, racial barriers limited a black student's access to education. They had limited resources compared to white children and were deprived education beyond seventh grade — when twelve grades was already common practice.

A dedicated teacher, Louise Archer brought Vienna's African American community together in service to its school.

==Life==
Louise Reeves grew up in [[North Carolina]] and attended [[Livingstone College]]. She taught school in [[Southampton County, Virginia]], where she married Romulus C. Archer Jr. in 1915. They moved to [[Washington, D.C.]], in 1922 and she continued her education, later earning a B.S. from [[Morgan State College]].

==Education==
In 1922 Archer became teacher and principal for a one-room segregated school in [[Vienna, Virginia|Vienna]], [[Virginia]]. Devoted to her students, she often transported children to school herself and worked to improve their learning experience. She organized a Parent-Teacher Association to raise funds for supplies and a new building, which opened in 1939 with three rooms. In 1941 students, parents, and faculty raised $300, which paid for a music teacher, bus expenses, kitchen supplies, and the installation of electric lights. Archer also established one of [[Fairfax County]]'s earliest [[4-H Club]]s for African Americans and her students participated in garden projects to raise vegetables for lunches prepared at school.&lt;ref name="Baker"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Baker|first1=Peter|title=SCHOOL BORN OF STRUGGLE HONORS PROUD PAST|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1989/03/16/school-born-of-struggle-honors-proud-past/0f9b50a9-e925-4d49-b0f9-bb51e1ba9b5e/|accessdate=4 February 2017|work=The Washington Post|date=16 March 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archer provided a high-quality education. In addition to the academic curriculum, she taught sewing, cooking, music, and poetry to her students in fifth through seventh grades, which was then the highest level of public education available to African Americans in the county. After Archer's death, families petitioned the county to name the school in her honor. Louise Archer Elementary School continues to remember her service to the community with an annual celebration in her honor.

In 1948, Mrs. Louise Archer died of a heart attack; the school was renamed Louise Archer in her honor in 1950.

'''Matthew Lipman''' (August 24, 1923 in [[Vineland, New Jersey]] &amp;ndash; December 26, 2010 in [[West Orange, New Jersey]]) is recognized as the founder of [[Philosophy for Children]].  His decision to bring [[philosophy]] to young people came from his experience as a professor at [[Columbia University]], where he witnessed underdeveloped reasoning skills in his students. His interest was particularly on developing reasoning skills by teaching [[logic]]. The belief that children possess the ability to think abstractly from an early age, led him to the conviction that bringing logic to children's education earlier would help them to improve their reasoning skills. 

In 1972 he left Columbia for [[Montclair State College]] to establish the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children (IAPC)&lt;ref&gt;[http://cehs.montclair.edu/academic/iapc/ Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children]&lt;/ref&gt; where he began to take philosophy into [[K-12]] classrooms in Montclair. That year he also published his first book specifically designed to help children practice philosophy, ''[[Harry Stottlemeier's Discovery]]''. The IAPC continues to develop and publish [[curriculum]], working internationally to advance and improve philosophy for children.

Lipman died, aged 87, in [[West Orange, New Jersey]] on December 26, 2010. Lipman's marriage to his first wife, [[New Jersey Senate|New Jersey State Senator]] [[Wynona Lipman]], ended with their divorce.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Douglas.

'''''Moon Tycoon''''' is a [[city-building game|city-building]] computer game released in 2001 by [[Anarchy Enterprises]] and [[Unique Entertainment]].&lt;ref name="moby"&gt;{{cite web|title=Moon Tycoon (Windows)|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/moon-tycoon|website=mobygames.com|accessdate=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is based on the creation of a [[lunar colony]] or city.  Anarchy Enterprises described it as the "first 3-D Sim game ever", and noted that it has similarities to [[SimCity]] (which at the time was 2-dimensional).

==Gameplay==
Moon Tycoon has three campaigns to play through, each with its own story-line and placed around the year 2021.

Campaign 1: Earth is in a global energy crisis, and the only thing that can stop it is a precious ore called Helium 3 that can only be found on the moon.

Campaign 2: The energy crisis is over, but competition begins to heat up as corporations battle for lunar domination as space borne epidemics, discontent over living conditions and space disasters become more frequent.

Campaign 3: Mankind makes yet another leap as it begins the next stage of space exploration: the colonization of the asteroid belt beyond Mars.

Each campaign has ten levels to play through each with varied levels of difficulty.  All three campaigns make up a larger story, so they can only be played in order and starting with the first.
There is also a sandbox mode; where you can set the starting money, terrain type, ore quantity and average building life; it also lets you select the moon or asteroid.

The game is played on the Play Area, on which completed and under-construction structures are displayed.  Players also use this screen to begin construction of buildings and alter the terrain. The play area is raised up from the surrounding view and can also have a grid.

To the right of the Play Area is the Building Menus, Colony Management, Disasters, and Options.

The building menu display the various types of structures available for construction.  These buildings are divided into different categories: Housing and Medical, Tourism, Research, Rewards (earned by different objectives), utilities, and Industry.

The spiritual sequel, ''Deep Sea Tycoon'', often confused with ''[[Atlantis Underwater Tycoon]]'', is a [[2003 in video gaming|2003]] [[video game]] [[video game developer|developed]] by Anarchy Enterprises and [[video game publisher|published]] by Unique Entertainment.&lt;ref name="mobygames"&gt;{{cite web|title=Atlantis Underwater Tycoon|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/atlantis-underwater-tycoon/mobyrank|website=mobygames.com|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This game involves you building an underwater city in [[3D computer graphics|3D]]. It has a sequel, ''[[Deep Sea Tycoon 2]]'', developed by Pixel after Pixel.

=== Gameplay ===

The gameplay of ''Deep Sea Tycoon'' involves choosing one of 24 different characters and creating an underwater city filled with different buildings and features, from Mermaid Palaces to Seafood Restaurants. Through the character they choose and the choices they make in their city, the player can become a ruthless oil-tycoon, or something similar, or an [[environmentalist]].

The gameplay is similar to Moon Tycoon. The player creates buildings on a flat piece of land, that must be connected to other buildings by a "tunnel". The only major differences is the scenario, and the types of buildings each game uses.

"Deep Sea Tycoon 2" has been reviewed by X-Play, being given a 1 out of 5. Being noted for being boring by having "ridiculously easy challenges" and simple challenges of only having to "click my mouse button twice". As a final note in their review, Adam Sessler noted that "Game Tycoon" was more entertaining than "Deep Sea Tycoon 2".

A '''museum''' ({{IPAc-en|m|juː|ˈ|z|iː|əm}} {{respell|mew|ZEE|əm}}; plural '''museums''' or, rarely, '''musea''') is an institution that [[Preservation (library and archival science)|cares for]] (conserves) a [[collection (artwork)|collection]] of artifacts and other objects of [[art]]istic, [[culture|cultural]], [[history|historical]], or [[science|scientific]] importance.  Many public museums make these items available for public viewing through [[display case|exhibits]] that may be permanent or temporary.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Porter Alexander, Mary Alexander; {{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=owHSEk96qxQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Museums+history&amp;q= |title=Museums in motion: an introduction to the history and functions of museums |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2008 |accessdate=6 October 2009 |isbn=978-0759105096 |author1=Alexander, Mary |author2=Alexander, Edward Porter |date=September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest museums are located in major cities throughout the world, while thousands of local museums exist in smaller cities, towns and rural areas. Museums have varying aims, ranging from serving researchers and specialists to serving the general public. The goal of serving researchers is increasingly shifting to serving the [[general public]].

There are many types of museums, including art museums, natural history museums, science museums, war museums, and children's museums. Amongst the world's largest and most visited museums are the [[Louvre]] in [[Paris]], the [[National Museum of China]] in [[Beijing]], the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], the [[British Museum]] and [[National Gallery]] in London, the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]] and [[Vatican Museums]] in [[Vatican City]].

As of the 2010s, the continuing acceleration in the [[Digitizing|digitization]] of information, combined with the increasing capacity of [[computer data storage|digital information storage]], is causing the traditional model of museums (i.e. as static bricks-and-mortar "collections of collections" of three-dimensional specimens and artifacts) to expand to include [[Virtual museum|virtual exhibits]] and high-resolution images of their collections that patrons can peruse, study, and explore from any location with Internet access.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} According to The World Museum Community, there are more than 55,000 museums in 202 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icom.museum/resources/frequently-asked-questions/ Frequently Asked Questions] – The World Museum Community&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:State Historical Museum, Moscow, Russia.jpg|thumb|The [[State Historical Museum]] in [[Moscow]].]]

The English "museum" comes from the [[Latin]] word, and is pluralized as "museums" (or rarely, "musea"). It is originally from the [[Ancient Greek]] Μουσεῖον (''[[Musaeum|Mouseion]]''), which denotes a place or temple dedicated to the [[Muse]]s (the patron divinities in [[Greek mythology]] of the arts), and hence a building set apart for study and the arts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Findlen |first=Paula |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1989 |month= |title=The Museum: its classical etymology and renaissance genealogy |journal=Journal of the History of Collections |volume=1 |issue= 1|pages=59–78 |id= |url=http://jhc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/1/1/59 |accessdate= 5 April 2008 |quote=|doi=10.1093/jhc/1.1.59 }}&lt;/ref&gt; especially the [[Musaeum]] (institute) for [[philosophy]] and research at [[Alexandria]] by [[Ptolemy I Soter]] about 280 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/ptolemy1.htm |title= Ptolemy I Soter, The First King of Ancient Egypt's Ptolemaic Dynasty|accessdate=5 April 2008 |work=Tour Egypt }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
[[File:Bode_Museum.jpg|thumb|The [[Museum Island]] in [[Berlin]].]]
The purpose of modern museums is to collect, preserve, interpret, and display items of artistic, cultural, or scientific significance for the education of the public. From a visitor or community perspective, the purpose can also depend on one's point of view. A trip to a local history museum or large city art museum can be an entertaining and enlightening way to spend the day. To city leaders, a healthy museum community can be seen as a gauge of the economic health of a city, and a way to increase the sophistication of its inhabitants. To a museum professional, a museum might be seen as a way to educate the public about the museum's mission, such as civil rights or environmentalism. Museums are, above all, storehouses of knowledge. In 1829, James Smithson's bequest, that would fund the [[Smithsonian Institution]], stated he wanted to establish an institution "for the increase and diffusion of knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher = Smithsonian Institution|title = James Smithson Society| url = https://www.si.edu/giving/membership/james-smithson-society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Museums of natural history in the late 19th century exemplified the Victorian desire for consumption and for order.  Gathering all examples of each classification of a field of knowledge for research and for display was the purpose.  As American colleges grew in the 19th century, they developed their own natural history collections for the use of their students.  By the last quarter of the 19th century, the scientific research in the universities was shifting toward biological research on a cellular level, and cutting edge research moved from museums to university laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Conn, "Museums and American Intellectual Life, 1876–1926", 1998, The University of Chicago Press, 65.&lt;/ref&gt;   While many large museums, such as the [[Smithsonian Institution]], are still respected as research centers, research is no longer a main purpose of most museums. While there is an ongoing debate about the purposes of interpretation of a museum's collection, there has been a consistent mission to protect and preserve artifacts for future generations.  Much care, expertise, and expense is invested in preservation efforts to retard decomposition in aging documents, artifacts, artworks, and buildings.  All museums display objects that are important to a culture.  As historian Steven Conn writes, "To see the thing itself, with one's own eyes and in a public place, surrounded by other people having some version of the same experience can be enchanting."&lt;ref&gt;Steven Conn, "Museums and American Intellectual Life, 1876–1926", 1998, The University of Chicago Press, 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

Museum purposes vary from institution to institution. Some favor education over conservation, or vice versa. For example, in the 1970s, the [[Canada Science and Technology Museum]] favored education over preservation of their objects. They displayed objects as well as their functions. One exhibit featured a historic printing press that a staff member used for visitors to create museum memorabilia.&lt;ref&gt;Babian, Sharon, ''CSTM: A History of the Canada Science and Technology Museum'', pp. 42–45&lt;/ref&gt;  Some seek to reach a wide audience, such as a national or state museum, while some museums have specific audiences, like the LDS [[Church History Museum]] or local history organizations. Generally speaking, museums collect objects of significance that comply with their mission statement for conservation and display.
Although most museums do not allow physical contact with the associated artifacts, there are some that are interactive and encourage a more hands-on approach. In 2009, [[Hampton Court Palace]], palace of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], opened the council room to the general public to create an interactive environment for visitors. Rather than allowing visitors to handle 500-year-old objects, the museum created replicas, as well as replica costumes. The daily activities, historic clothing, and even temperature changes immerse the visitor in a slice of what Tudor life may have been.&lt;ref&gt;Lipschomb, Suzannah, "Historical Authenticity and Interpretive Strategy at Hampton Court Palace," ''The Public Historian'' 32, no.3, August 2010, pp. 98–119.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early museums===

Early museums began as the private collections of wealthy individuals, families or institutions of art and rare or curious natural objects and [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]]. These were often displayed in so-called wonder rooms or [[cabinet of curiosities|cabinets of curiosities]]. One of the oldest museums known is [[Ennigaldi-Nanna's museum]], built by Princess Ennigaldi at the end of the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]]. The site dates from c. 530 BCE, and contained artifacts from earlier [[Mesopotamia|Mesopotamian civilizations]]. Notably, a clay drum label—written in three languages—was found at the site, referencing the history and discovery of a museum item.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/5805358/the-story-behind-the-worlds-oldest-museum-built-by-a-babylonian-princess-2500-years-ago|title=The story behind the world's oldest museum, built by a Babylonian princess 2,500 years ago|last=Wilkens|first=Alasdair|date=25 May 2011|website=io9|access-date=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manssour|first=Y. M.|last2=El-Daly|first2=H. M.|last3=Morsi|first3=N. K.|date=|title=The Historical Evolution of Museums Architecture|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/36076072/THE_HISTORICAL_EVOLUTION_OF_MUSEUM_ARCHITECTURE.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1522521609&amp;Signature=Fj5imIz0inyCc8%2BT8U1dFwShxoQ%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DTHE_HISTORICAL_EVOLUTION_OF_MUSEUMS_ARCH.pdf|journal=N/A|volume=|pages=2|via=Academia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public access to these museums was often possible for the "respectable", especially to private art collections, but at the whim of the owner and his staff. One way that elite men during this time period gained a higher social status in the world of elites was by becoming a collector of these curious objects and displaying them. Many of the items in these collections were new discoveries and these collectors or naturalists, since many of these people held interest in natural sciences, were eager to obtain them. By putting their collections in a museum and on display, they not only got to show their fantastic finds but they also used the museum as a way to sort and "manage the empirical explosion of materials that wider dissemination of ancient texts, increased travel, voyages of discovery, and more systematic forms of communication and exchange had produced." &lt;ref&gt;Paula Findlen, Possessing Nature: Museums, Collecting, and Scientific Culture in Early Modern Italy (Berkeley, California: University of California Press, 1994),3.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of these naturalists and collectors was [[Ulisse Aldrovandi]], whose collection policy of gathering as many objects and facts about them was "encyclopedic" in nature, reminiscent of that of Pliny, the Roman philosopher and naturalist.&lt;ref&gt;Paula Findlen, Possessing Nature: Museums, Collecting, and Scientific Culture in Early Modern Italy (Berkeley, California: University of California Press, 1994),62.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was to consume and collect as much knowledge as possible, to put everything they collected and everything they knew in these displays. In time, however, museum philosophy would change and the encyclopedic nature of information that was so enjoyed by Aldrovandi and his cohorts would be dismissed as well as "the museums that contained this knowledge." The 18th-century scholars of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] saw their ideas of the museum as superior and based their natural history museums on "organization and taxonomy" rather than displaying everything in any order after the style of Aldrovandi.&lt;ref&gt;Paula Findlen, Possessing Nature: Museums, Collecting, and Scientific Culture in Early Modern Italy (Berkeley, California: University of California Press, 1994),393–397.&lt;/ref&gt;

While some of the oldest public museums in the world opened in [[Italy]] during the [[Renaissance]], the majority of these significant museums in the world opened during the 18th century:
[[File:Das Ambraser Unterschloss.jpg|thumb|The Lower Castle of Ambras Castle, Innsbruck was one of the earliest buildings of all, explicitly intended for use as a museum, which still exists today in its proper function and shows the original collections.|alt=]]
* the [[Capitoline Museums]], the oldest public collection of art in the world, began in 1471 when [[Pope Sixtus IV]] donated a group of important ancient sculptures to the people of Rome.
* the [[Vatican Museums]], the second oldest museum in the world, traces its origins to the public displayed sculptural collection begun in 1506 by [[Pope Julius II]]
* [[Ambras Castle]] (''Schloss Ambras Innsbruck''), Austria, is not the oldest art collection, but it is the earliest collection still to be found in that very building created especially for its museum purpose (1572–1583, Supplement 1589): Ambras Castle is the oldest museum in the world in several respects: the oldest pair of original building and initial collections; the oldest preserved collection in the history of museum according to a systematic concept; it houses – beside the Armouries – the only Renaissance [[Chamber of Art and Curiosities, Ambras Castle|''Kunstkammer'']] of its kind to have been preserved at its original location. Verifiably called a ‘museum’ as early as c.1580.
* the [[Royal Armouries]] in the [[Tower of London]] is the oldest museum in the [[United Kingdom]]. It opened to the public in 1660, though there had been paying privileged visitors to the armouries displays from 1592. Today the museum has three sites including its new headquarters in [[Leeds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royalarmouries.org/collections/history-of-the-collection/museum-history/armouries-history/16th-17th-century |title=Royal Armouries Museum |publisher=Royalarmouries.org |date=29 December 1940 |accessdate=6 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704144038/http://www.royalarmouries.org/collections/history-of-the-collection/museum-history/armouries-history/16th-17th-century |archive-date=4 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its successor was the [[Royal Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences|Batavia Society of Art and Science]], established on 24 April 1778.

The Uffizi Palace (built 1560-1581) was designed by the Renaissance painter and architect [[Giorgio Vasari]]. The top floors were converted to gallery space, open to visitors on request, and then opened to the public as a museum in 1769 by Grand Duke Peter Leopold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website = Uffizi.it|title=  History: The Uffizi|url =  https://www.uffizi.it/en/the-uffizi/history |deadurl = no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180914214554/https://www.uffizi.it/en/the-uffizi/history |archivedate=14 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica Online, s. v.

* the [[Museum of the History of Riga and Navigation]] is the oldest in Latvia and the whole of the Baltics, and one of the oldest in Europe. It was founded and opened to public in 1773 by the Riga Town Council as Himsel Museum. The rich and diverse collections of the museum originated from an art and natural sciences collection of Nikolaus von Himsel (1729–1764), a Riga doctor. Today the Museum of the History of Riga and Navigation collections number more than 500 000 items, systematised in about 80 collections.

===Modern museums===

Modern museums first emerged in western Europe, then spread into other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Chang Wan-Chen, ''A cross-cultural perspective on musealization: the museum’s
reception by China and Japan in the second half of the nineteenth century'' in ''Museum and Society'', vol 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first "public" museums were often accessible only by the middle and upper classes. It could be difficult to gain entrance. When the British Museum opened to the public in 1759, it was a concern that large crowds could damage the artifacts. Prospective visitors to the British Museum had to apply in writing for admission, and small groups were allowed into the galleries each day.&lt;ref&gt;The British Museum, " Admission Ticket to the British Museum" https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/archives/a/admission_ticket_to_the_britis.aspx, accessed 4/3/14.&lt;/ref&gt; The British Museum became increasingly popular during the 19th century, amongst all age groups and social classes who visited the British Museum, especially on public holidays.&lt;ref name="BM" /&gt;

The [[Ashmolean Museum]], however, founded in 1677 from the personal collection of [[Elias Ashmole]], was set up in the University of Oxford to be open to the public and is considered by some to be the first modern public museum.&lt;ref&gt;Swann, Marjorie (2001), Curiosities and Texts: The Culture of Collecting in Early Modern England, Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press&lt;/ref&gt; The collection included that of [[Elias Ashmole]] which he had collected himself, including objects he had acquired from the gardeners, travellers and collectors [[John Tradescant the elder]] and [[John Tradescant the Younger|his son of the same name]]. The collection included antique coins, books, engravings, geological specimens, and zoological specimens—one of which was the stuffed body of the last [[dodo]] ever seen in Europe; but by 1755 the stuffed dodo was so moth-eaten that it was destroyed, except for its head and one claw. The museum opened on 24 May 1683, with [[natural history|naturalist]] [[Robert Plot]] as the first keeper. The first building, which became known as the [[Museum of the History of Science, Oxford|Old Ashmolean]], is sometimes attributed to [[Christopher Wren|Sir Christopher Wren]] or [[Thomas Wood (architect)|Thomas Wood]].&lt;ref&gt;H. E. Salter and Mary D. Lobel (editors) [[Victoria County History]] [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=63866 ''A History of the County of Oxford: Volume 3'' 1954 Pages 47–49]&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, the first public museum was the [[Louvre|Louvre Museum]] in [[Paris]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Louvre |url=http://www.louvre.fr/en/history-louvre |publisher=History of Louvre |accessdate=14 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024093225/http://www.louvre.fr/en/history-louvre |archivedate=24 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; opened in 1793 during the [[French Revolution]], which enabled for the first time free access to the former French royal collections for people of all stations and status. The fabulous art treasures collected by the French monarchy over centuries were accessible to the public three days each "''décade''" (the 10-day unit which had replaced the week in the [[French Republican Calendar]]). The ''Conservatoire du muséum national des Arts'' (National Museum of Arts's Conservatory) was charged with organizing the Louvre as a national public museum and the centerpiece of a planned national museum system. As [[Napoleon|Napoléon I]] conquered the great cities of Europe, confiscating art objects as he went, the collections grew and the organizational task became more and more complicated. After Napoleon was defeated in 1815, many of the treasures he had amassed were gradually [[Repatriation (cultural heritage)|returned to their owners]] (and many were not). His plan was never fully realized, but his concept of a museum as an agent of nationalistic fervor had a profound influence throughout Europe.

Chinese and Japanese visitors to Europe were fascinated by the museums they saw there, but had cultural difficulties in grasping their purpose and finding an equivalent Chinese or Japanese term for them. Chinese visitors in the early 19th century named these museums based on what they contained, so defined them as "bone amassing buildings" or "courtyards of treasures" or "painting pavilions" or "curio stores" or "halls of military feats" or "gardens of everything". Japan first encountered Western museum institutions when it participated in Europe’s World’s Fairs in the 1860s. The British Museum was described by one of their delegates as a 'hakubutsukan', a 'house of extensive things' – this would eventually became accepted as the equivalent word for 'museum' in Japan and China.&lt;ref&gt;Chang Wan-Chen, ''A cross-cultural perspective on musealization: the museum’s reception by China and Japan in the second half of the nineteenth century'' in ''Museum and Society'', vol. 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

American museums eventually joined European museums as the world's leading centers for the production of new knowledge in their fields of interest. A period of intense museum building, in both an intellectual and physical sense was realized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries (this is often called "The Museum Period" or "The Museum Age"). While many American museums, both natural history museums and art museums alike, were founded with the intention of focusing on the scientific discoveries and artistic developments in North America, many moved to emulate their European counterparts in certain ways (including the development of Classical collections from ancient [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[ancient Greece|Greece]], [[Mesopotamia]], and [[ancient Rome|Rome]]). Drawing on [[Michel Foucault]]'s concept of liberal government, [[Tony Bennett (sociologist)|Tony Bennett]] has suggested the development of more modern 19th century museums was part of new strategies by Western governments to produce a citizenry that, rather than be directed by coercive or external forces, monitored and regulated its own conduct. To incorporate the masses in this strategy, the private space of museums that previously had been restricted and socially exclusive were made public.  As such, objects and artifacts, particularly those related to high culture, became instruments for these "new tasks of social management."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first =Tony |last =Bennett|title =The Birth of the Museum |location=New York|publisher = Routledge Press|date= 1995|pages = 6, 8, 24|isbn=0415053889}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[University|Universities]] became the primary centers for innovative research in the United States well before the start of the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Nevertheless, museums to this day contribute new knowledge to their fields and continue to build collections that are useful for both research and display.

The late twentieth century witnessed intense debate concerning the repatriation of religious, ethnic, and cultural artifacts housed in museum collections. In the United States, several Native American tribes and advocacy groups have lobbied extensively for the repatriation of sacred objects and the reburial of human remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gulliford|first=Andrew|date=1992|title=Curation and Repatriation of Sacred and Tribal Artifacts|url=|journal=The Public Historian |volume= 14| issue = 3 |page=25|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, Congress passed the [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]] (NAGPRA), which required federal agencies and federally funded institutions to repatriate Native American "cultural items" to culturally affiliate tribes and groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/archeology/tools/laws/nagpra.htm|title=The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=National Park Service|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, many European museum collections often contain objects and cultural artifacts acquired through imperialism and colonization. Some historians and scholars have criticized the British Museum for its possession of rare antiquities from Egypt, Greece, and the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duthie|first=Emily|date=2011|title=The British Museum: An Imperial Museum in a Post-Imperial World|url=|journal=Public History Review|volume=18 |pages=12–25|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
[[File:Lightmatter vaticanmuseum.jpg|thumb|[[Vatican Museums]].]]

The roles associated with the management of a museum largely depend on the size of the institution, but every museum has a hierarchy of governance with a Board of Trustees serving at the top. The Director is next in command and works with the Board to establish and fulfill the museum's mission statement and to ensure that the museum is accountable to the public.&lt;ref&gt;American Association of Museums, "The Accreditation Commission's Expectations Regarding Governance." [http://www.aam-us.org/aboutmuseums/standards/stbp.cfm p. 1.]&lt;/ref&gt;   Together, the Board and the Director establish a system of governance that is guided by policies that set standards for the institution. Documents that set these standards include an institutional or strategic plan, institutional code of ethics, bylaws, and collections policy. The [[American Alliance of Museums]] (AAM) has also formulated a series of standards and best practices that help guide the management of museums.
* [[Trustee|Board of Trustees]] – The board governs the museum and is responsible for ensuring the museum is financially and ethically sound. They set standards and policies for the museum. Board members are often involved in fundraising aspects of the museum and represent the institution.
* Director- The director is the face of the museum to the professional and public community. They communicate closely with the board to guide and govern the museum. They work with the staff to ensure the museum runs smoothly.

[[File:Perez Art Museum Miami.jpg|thumb|[[Pérez Art Museum Miami|Pérez Art Museum]] in [[Miami]], [[Florida]].]]
According to museum professionals Hugh H. Genoways and Lynne M. Ireland, "Administration of the organization requires skill in conflict management, interpersonal relations, budget management and monitoring, and staff supervision and evaluation. Managers must also set legal and ethical standards and maintain involvement in the museum profession."&lt;ref&gt;Hugh H. Genoways and Lynne M. Ireland, ''Museum Administration: An Introduction'', (Lanham: AltaMira, 2003), 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various positions within the museum carry out the policies established by the Board and the Director. All museum employees should work together toward the museum's institutional goal. Here is a list of positions commonly found at museums:
* [[Curator]] – Curators are the intellectual drivers behind exhibits. They research the museum's collection and topic of focus, develop exhibition themes, and publish their research aimed at either a public or academic audience. Larger museums have curators in a variety of areas. For example, [[The Henry Ford]] has a Curator of Transportation, a Curator of Public Life, a Curator of Decorative Arts, etc.
* [[Collection Management Policy|Collections Management]] – Collections managers are primarily responsible for the hands-on care, movement, and storage of objects. They are responsible for the accessibility of collections and collections policy.
* [[Registrar (museum)|Registrar]] – Registrars are the primary record keepers of the collection. They insure that objects are properly accessioned, documented, insured, and, when appropriate, loaned. Ethical and legal issues related to the collection are dealt with by registrars. Along with collections managers, they uphold the museum's collections policy.
* Educator – Museum educators are responsible for educating museum audiences. Their duties can include designing tours and public programs for children and adults, teacher training, developing classroom and continuing education resources, community outreach, and volunteer management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Knowledge to Narrative: Educators and the Changing  Museum|last=Roberts|first=Lisa C.|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educators not only work with the public, but also collaborate with other museum staff on exhibition and program development to ensure that exhibits are audience-friendly. 
* [[Exhibit Designer]] – Exhibit designers are in charge of the layout and physical installation of exhibits. They create a conceptual design and then bring it to fruition in the physical space.
* [[Conservator-restorer|Conservator]] – Conservators focus on object restoration. More than preserving the object in its present state, they seek to stabilize and repair artifacts to the condition of an earlier era.&lt;ref&gt;University of Rochester, [http://mag.rochester.edu/plugins/acrobat/teachers/MuseumCareers.pdf "Museum Job Descriptions".]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other positions commonly found at museums include: building operator, public programming staff, photographer, librarian, archivist, groundskeeper, volunteer coordinator, preparator, security staff, development officer, membership officer, business officer, gift shop manager, public relations staff, and graphic designer.

At smaller museums, staff members often fulfill multiple roles. Some of these positions are excluded entirely or may be carried out by a contractor when necessary.

===Exhibition histories===
{{globalize|date=April 2018}}
An '''exhibition history''' is a listing of exhibitions for an institution, artist, or a work of art. Exhibition histories generally include the name of the host institution, the title of the exhibition and the opening and closing dates of the exhibition.

The following is a list of major institutions that have complete or substantial exhibition histories that are available online.

==Museum planning==
[[File:Museu de Arte de Sao Paulo 1 Brasil.jpg|thumb|[[São Paulo Museum of Art]] in [[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]].]]
{{See also|Museum planning|Interpretive planning}}

The design of museums has evolved throughout history. However, museum planning involves planning the actual mission of the museum along with planning the space that the collection of the museum will be housed in. Intentional museum planning has its beginnings with the museum founder and librarian [[John Cotton Dana]]. Dana detailed the process of founding the Newark Museum in a series of books in the early 20th century so that other museum founders could plan their museums. Dana suggested that potential founders of museums should form a committee first, and reach out to the community for input as to what the museum should supply or do for the community.&lt;ref&gt;Dana, John Cotton. The New Museum (Woodstock, VT: The Elm Tree Press, 1917), 25.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dana, museums should be planned according to community's needs:

"The new museum…does not build on an educational superstition. It examines its community's life first, and then straightway bends its energies to supplying some the material which that community needs, and to making that material's presence widely known, and to presenting it in such a way as to secure it for the maximum of use and the maximum efficiency of that use." &lt;ref&gt;Dana, John Cotton. The New Museum (Woodstock, VT: The Elm Tree Press, 1917), 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The way that museums are planned and designed vary according to what collections they house, but overall, they adhere to planning a space that is easily accessed by the public and easily displays the chosen artifacts. These elements of planning have their roots with John Cotton Dana, who was perturbed at the historical placement of museums outside of cities, and in areas that were not easily accessed by the public, in gloomy European style buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Dana, John Cotton. The Gloom of the Museum. (Woodstock, VT: The Elm Tree Press, 1917), 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Questions of accessibility continue to the present day. Many museums strive to make their buildings, programming, ideas, and collections more publicly accessible than in the past. Not every museum is participating in this trend, but that seems to be the trajectory of museums in the twenty-first century with its emphasis on inclusiveness. One pioneering way museums are attempting to make their collections more accessible is with open storage. Most of a museum's collection is typically locked away in a secure location to be preserved, but the result is most people never get to see the vast majority of collections. The Brooklyn Museum's Luce Center for American Art practices this open storage where the public can view items not on display, albeit with minimal interpretation. The practice of open storage is all part of an ongoing debate in the museum field of the role objects play and how accessible they should be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Turning Museums Inside-Out with Beautiful Visible Storage|url = http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/turning-museums-inside-out-with-beautiful-visible-storage|website = Atlas Obscura|date = 24 September 2014|access-date = 1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of modern museums, interpretive museums, as opposed to art museums, have missions reflecting curatorial guidance through the subject matter which now include content in the form of images, audio and visual effects, and interactive exhibits. Museum creation begins with a museum plan, created through a [[museum planning]] process. The process involves identifying the museum's vision and the resources, organization and experiences needed to realize this vision. A feasibility study, analysis of comparable facilities, and an [[Interpretive planning|interpretive plan]] are all developed as part of the museum planning process.

Some museum experiences have very few or no artifacts and do not necessarily call themselves museums, and their mission reflects this; the [[Griffith Observatory]] in [[Los Angeles]] and the [[National Constitution Center]] in [[Philadelphia]], being notable examples where there are few artifacts, but strong, memorable stories are told or information is interpreted. In contrast, the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] uses many artifacts in their memorable exhibitions.

===Financial uses of museums===
In recent years, some cities have turned to museums as an avenue for economic development or rejuvenation. This is particularly true in the case of postindustrial cities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Do Museums Still Need Objects?|last = Conn|first = Steven|publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press|year = 2010|isbn = |location = Philadelphia|pages = 17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of museums fulfilling these economic roles exist around the world. For example, the spectacular ''Guggenheim Bilbao'' was built in Bilbao, Spain in a move by the Basque regional government to revitalize the dilapidated old port area of that city. The Basque government agreed to pay $100 million for the construction of the museum, a price tag that caused many Bilbaoans to protest against the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = A Gleaming New Guggenheim for Grimy Bilbao|last = Riding|first = Alan|date = 24 June 1997|work = New York Times|access-date = |via = |page = C9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the gamble has appeared to pay off financially for the city, with over 1.1 million people visiting the museum in 2015. Key to this is the large demographic of foreign visitors to the museum, with 63% of the visitors residing outside of Spain and thus feeding foreign investment straight into Bilbao.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://prensa.guggenheim-bilbao.es/src/uploads/2016/01/NP_Balance-2015_ES.pdf|title = Guggenheim Bilbao Annual Report 2015|date = |access-date = 20 January 2016|website = Guggenheim Bilbao|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar project to that undertaken in Bilbao was also built on the disused shipyards of Belfast, Northern Ireland. ''Titanic Belfast'' was built for the same price as the ''Guggenheim Bilbao'' (and which was incidentally built by the same architect, Frank Gehry) in time for the 100th anniversary of the Belfast-built ship's maiden voyage in 2012. Initially expecting modest visitor numbers of 425,000 annually, first year visitor numbers reached over 800,000, with almost 60% coming from outside Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Northern Ireland Focus: Titanic Success Raises Hopes For Tourism|last = Smyth|first = Jamie|date = 16 June 2013|work = Financial Times|access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, similar projects include the 81, 000 square foot ''Taubman Museum of Art'' in Roanoke, Virginia and ''The Broad Museum'' in Los Angeles.

Museums being used as a cultural economic driver by city and local governments has proven to be controversial among museum activists and local populations alike. Public protests have occurred in numerous cities which have tried to employ museums in this way. While most subside if a museum is successful, as happened in Bilbao, others continue especially if a museum struggles to attract visitors. The ''[[Taubman Museum of Art]]'' is an example of a museum which cost a lot (eventually $66 million) but attained little success, and continues to have a low endowment for its size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Start-Up Success Isn't Enough to Found a Museum|last = Wallis|first = David|date = 20 March 2014|work = New York Times|access-date = |via = |page = F6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some museum activists also see this method of museum use as a deeply flawed model for such institutions. Steven Conn, one such museum proponent, believes that "to ask museums to solve our political and economic problems is to set them up for inevitable failure and to set us (the visitor) up for inevitable disappointment."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Museum funding===

Museums are facing funding shortages. Funding for museums comes from four major categories, and as of 2009 the breakdown for the United States is as follows: Government support (at all levels) 24.4%, private (charitable) giving 36.5%, earned income 27.6%, and investment income 11.5%.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Ford W. [http://www.photos.state.gov/libraries/amgov/133183/english/P_You_Asked_How_Are_Museums_Supported_Financially.pdf “How Are Museums Supported Nationally in the U.S.?”] Embassy of the United States of America, 2012..  Accessed 26 March 2017.
&lt;/ref&gt; Government funding from the National Endowment for the Arts, the largest museum funder in the United States, decreased by 19.586 million between 2011 and 2015, adjusted for inflation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arts.gov/sites/default/files/2011-NEA-Annual-Report.pdf “National Endowment for the Arts 2011 Annual Report.”] National Endowment for the Arts, 2012. .  Accessed 26 February 2017.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arts.gov/sites/default/files/2015%20Annual%20Report.pdf “National Endowment for the Arts 2015 Annual Report.”] National Endowment for the Arts, 2016.. Accessed 26 February 2017.
&lt;/ref&gt; The average spent per visitor in an art museum in 2016 was $8 between admissions, store and restaurant, where the average expense per visitor was $55.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aamd.org/sites/default/files/document/Art%20Museums%20By%20the%20Numbers%202016.pdf Association of Art Museum Directors (AAMD)], “Art Museums by the Numbers 2016.” AAMD.org,. Accessed 26 February 2017.
&lt;/ref&gt; Corporations, which fall into the private giving category, can be a good source of funding to make up the funding gap. The amount corporations currently give to museums accounts for just 5% of total funding.&lt;ref&gt;Stubbs, Ryan and Henry Clapp. [http://www.giarts.org/article/public-funding-arts-2015-update “Public Funding for the Arts: 2015 Update.”] Grantmakers in the Arts, GIA Reader, vol. 26, no. 3, Fall 2015.. Accessed 26 February 2017.
&lt;/ref&gt; Corporate giving to the arts, however, was set to increase by 3.3% in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =Sponsorship Spending on the Arts to Grow 3.3 Percent in 2017|website = ESP Sponsorship Report|date = 13 February 2017|url = http://www.sponsorship.com/iegsr/2017/02/13/Sponsorship-Spending-On-The-Arts-To-Grow-3-3-Perce.aspx|publisher = ESP Properties, LLC.}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibition design==
{{Main article|Exhibit design}}
[[File:Indonesia Museum Traditional Dress 01.jpg|thumb|Exhibit in [[Indonesia Museum]], [[Jakarta]], displaying the traditional costumes of [[Ethnic groups in Indonesia|Indonesian ethnic groups]], such as [[Balinese people|Balinese]] and East Java.]]

Most mid-size and large museums employ [[exhibit design]] staff for graphic and environmental design projects, including exhibitions. In addition to traditional 2-D and 3-D designers and architects, these staff departments may include audio-visual specialists, software designers, audience research and evaluation specialists, writers, editors, and preparators or art handlers. These staff specialists may also be charged with supervising contract design or production services. The exhibit design process builds on the [[Interpretive planning|interpretive plan]] for an exhibit, determining the most effective, engaging and appropriate methods of communicating a message or telling a story. The process will often mirror the architectural process or schedule, moving from conceptual plan, through schematic design, design development, contract document, fabrication, and installation. Museums of all sizes may also contract the outside services of exhibit fabrication businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taheri|first=Babak|last2=Jafari|first2=Aliakbar|last3=O'Gorman|first3=Kevin|title=Keeping your audience: Presenting a visitor engagement scale|journal=Tourism Management|volume=42|pages=321–329|doi=10.1016/j.tourman.2013.12.011|year=2014|url=https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/46406/4/Taheri_Jafari_O_Gorman_Pre_Print_Draft.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exhibition design has as multitude of strategies, theories, and methods but two that embody much of the theory and dialogue surrounding exhibition design are the metonymy technique and the use of authentic artifacts to provide the historical narrative. Metonymy, or "the substitution of the name of an attribute or adjunct for that of the thing meant,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Oxford Dictionaries|metonymy}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a technique used by many museums but few as heavily and as influentially as Holocaust museums.

The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington D.C., for example, employs this technique in its shoe exhibition. Simply a pile of decaying leather shoes piled against a bare, gray concrete wall the exhibit relies heavily on the emotional, sensory response the viewer will naturally through this use metonymic technique. This exhibition design intentionally signifies metonymically the nameless and victims themselves. This metaphysical link to the victims through the deteriorating and aged shoes stands as a surviving vestige of the individual victim. This technique, employed properly, can be a very powerful one as it plays off the real life experiences of the viewer while evoking the equally unique memory of the victim. Metonymy, however, Jennifer Hansen-Glucklich argues, is not without its own problems. Hansen-Glucklich explains, "...when victims' possessions are collected according to type and displayed en masse they stand metonymically for the victims themselves ... Such a use of metonymy contributes to the dehumanization of the victims as they are reduced to a heap of indistinguishable objects and their individuality subsumed by an aesthetic of anonymity and excess."&lt;ref name="Hansen-Glucklich, J. 2011"&gt;Hansen-Glucklich, J. (2011). Holocaust Memories: Visuality and the Sacred in Museums and Exhibits Doctoral dissertation, UMI Dissertation Publishing, Ann Arbor&lt;/ref&gt;

While a powerful technique, Hansen-Glucklick points out that when used ''en masse'' the metonym suffers as the memory and suffering of the individual is lost in the chorus of the whole. While at times juxtaposed, the alternative technique of the use of authentic objects is seen the same exhibit mentioned above. The use of authentic artifacts is employed by most, if not all, museums but the degree to which and the intention can vary greatly. The basic idea behind exhibiting authentic artifacts is to provide not only legitimacy to the exhibit's historical narrative but, at times, to help create the narrative as well. The theory behind this technique is to exhibit artifacts in a neutral manner to orchestrate and narrate the historic narrative through, ideally, the provenance of the artifacts themselves.

While albeit necessary to some degree in any museum repertoire, the use of authentic artifacts can not only be misleading but as equally problematic as the aforementioned metonymic technique. Hansen-Glucklick explains, "The danger of such a strategy lies in the fact that by claiming to offer the remnants of the past to the spectator, the museum creates the illusion of standing before a complete picture. The suggestion is that if enough details and fragments are collected and displayed, a coherent and total truth concerning the past will emerge, visible and comprehensible. The museum attempts, in other words, to archive the unachievable."&lt;ref name="Hansen-Glucklich, J. 2011"/&gt; While any exhibit benefits from the legitimacy given by authentic objects or artifacts, the temptation must be protected against in order to avoid relying solely on the artifacts themselves. A well designed exhibition should employ objects and artifacts as a foundation to the narrative but not as a crutch; a lesson any conscientious curator would be well to keep in mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hogg|first=Gill|last2=Liao|first2=Min-Hsiu|last3=O'Gorman|first3=Kevin|title=Reading between the lines: Multidimensional translation in tourism consumption|journal=Tourism Management|volume=42|pages=157–164|doi=10.1016/j.tourman.2013.10.005|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some museum scholars have even begun to question whether museums truly need artifacts at all. Historian Steven Conn provocatively asks this question, suggesting that there are fewer objects in ''all'' museums now, as they have been progressively replaced by interactive technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As educational programming has grown in museums, mass collections of objects have receded in importance. This is not necessarily a negative development. Dorothy Canfield Fisher observed that the reduction in objects has pushed museums to grow from institutions that artlessly showcased their many artifacts (in the style of early cabinets of curiosity) to instead "thinning out" the objects presented "for a general view of any given subject or period, and to put the rest away in archive-storage-rooms, where they could be consulted by students, the only people who really needed to see them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon of disappearing objects is especially present in science museums like the [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]] in Chicago, which have a high visitorship of school-aged children who may benefit more from hands-on interactive technology than reading a label beside an artifact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Types==
[[File:Museodeloro (1).jpg|thumb|[[Gold Museum, Bogotá|Gold Museum]], [[Bogotá]] [[Colombia]].]]

Types of museums vary, from large institutions, covering many of the categories below, to very small institutions focusing on a specific subject, location, or a notable person. Categories include: [[fine art]]s, [[applied arts]], [[craft]], [[archaeology]], [[anthropology]] and [[ethnology]], [[biography]], [[history]], [[cultural history]], [[science]], [[technology]], [[children's museum]]s, [[natural history]], [[botanical garden|botanical]] and [[zoo|zoological gardens]]. Within these categories, many museums specialize further, e.g. museums of [[modern art]], folk art, local history, [[military history]], [[aviation]] history, [[philately]], [[agriculture]], or [[geology]]. Another type of museum is an encyclopedic museum. Commonly referred to as a universal museum, encyclopedic museums have collections representative of the world and typically include art, science, history, and cultural history. The type and size of a museum is reflected in its collection. A museum normally houses a core collection of important selected objects in its field.

===Architectural museums===
Architectural museums are institutions dedicated to educating visitors about architecture and a variety of related fields, often including urban design, landscape design, interior decoration, engineering, and historic preservation.  Additionally, museums of art or history sometimes dedicate a portion of the museum or a permanent exhibit to a particular facet or era of architecture and design, though this does not technically constitute a proper museum of architecture.

The [[International Confederation of Architectural Museums]] (ICAM) is the principal worldwide organisation for architectural museums.  Members consist of almost all large institutions specializing in this field and also those offering permanent exhibitions or dedicated galleries.

Architecture museums are in fact a less common type in the United States, due partly to the difficulty of curating a collection which could adequately represent or embody the large scale subject matter.

The National Building Museum in Washington D.C., a privately run institution created by a mandate of Congress in 1980, is the nation's most prominent public museum of architecture. In addition to its architectural exhibits and collections, the museum seeks to educate the public about engineering and design. The NBM is a unique museum in that the building in which it is housed—the historic Pension Building built 1882–87—is itself a sort of curated collection piece which teaches about architecture.  Another large scale museum of architecture is the Chicago Athenaeum, an international Museum of Architecture and Design, founded in 1988.  The Athenaeum differs from the National Building Museum not only in its global scope—it has offices in Italy, Greece, Germany, and Ireland—but also in its broader topical scope, which encompasses smaller modern appliances and graphic design.

A very different and much smaller example of an American architectural museum is the Schifferstadt Architectural Museum in Frederick, Maryland. Similar to the National Building Museum, the building of the Schifferstadt is a historic structure, built in 1758, and therefore also an embodiment of historic preservation and restoration.  In addition to instructing the public about its eighteenth century German-American style architecture, the Schifferstadt also interprets the broader contextual history of its origins, including topics such as the French and Indian War and the arrival of the region's earliest German American immigrants.

Museums of architecture are devoted primarily to disseminating knowledge about architecture, but there is considerable room for expanding into other related genres such as design, city planning, landscape, infrastructure, and even the traditional study of history or art, which can provide useful context for any architectural exhibit.

The American Society of Landscape Architects has professional awards given out every year to architectural museums and art displays. A few of the award-winning projects are:

===Archaeology museums===
Archaeology museums specialize in the display of archaeological artifacts. Many are in the open air, such as the [[Ancient Agora of Athens|Agora of Athens]] and the [[Roman Forum]]. Others display artifacts found in archaeological sites inside buildings. Some, such as the [[Western Australian Museum]], exhibit maritime archaeological materials. These appear in its Shipwreck Galleries, a wing of the Maritime Museum. This Museum has also developed a  'museum-without-walls'  through a series of underwater wreck trails.

===Art museums===
{{Main article|Art museum}}
[[File:Uffizi Gallery - Michelangelo painting "Tondo Doni".JPG|thumb|right|Viewers of the ''[[Doni Tondo]]'' by [[Michelangelo]] in the [[Uffizi|Uffizi Gallery]].]]
An [[art museum]], also known as an art gallery, is a space for the exhibition of art, usually in the form of [[Work of art|art objects]]
from the [[visual arts]], primarily [[painting]]s, [[illustration]]s, and [[sculpture]]s. Collections of [[drawing]]s and [[old master print]]s are often not displayed on the walls, but kept in a [[print room]]. There may be collections of [[applied arts|applied art]], including [[ceramic art|ceramics]], [[metalworking|metalwork]], furniture, [[artist's book]]s, and other types of objects. [[Video art]] is often screened.

The first publicly owned museum in [[Europe]] was the Amerbach-Cabinet in [[Basel]], originally a private collection sold to the city in 1661 and public since 1671 (now [[Kunstmuseum Basel]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first = Marta C.|last =  Lourenço|title = A Contribution to the History of University Museums and Collections in Europe|publisher = ICOM Conference 2002|url =  http://publicus.culture.hu-berlin.de/umac/2002/lourenco.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ashmolean Museum]] in [[Oxford]] opened on 24 May 1683 as the world's first university art museum. Its first building was built in 1678–1683 to house the [[cabinet of curiosities]] [[Elias Ashmole]] gave [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] in 1677. The [[Uffizi]] Gallery in [[Florence]] was initially conceived as offices for the Florentine civil service (hence the name), but evolved into a display place for many of the paintings and sculpture collected by the [[House of Medici|Medici]] family or commissioned by them. After the house of Medici was extinguished, the art treasures remained in Florence, forming one of the first modern museums. The gallery had been open to visitors by request since the sixteenth century, and in 1765 it was officially opened to the public. Another early public museum was the [[British Museum]] in London, which opened to the public in 1759.&lt;ref name="BM"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/history/general_history.aspx |title=History of the British Museum |accessdate= |publisher=British Museum }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a "universal museum" with very varied collections covering art, applied art, archaeology, anthropology, history, and science, and what is now the [[British Library]]. The science collections, library, paintings, and modern sculptures have since been found separate homes, leaving history, archaeology, non-European and pre-Renaissance art, and prints and drawings. Underwater museum is another type of [[art museum]] where the [[Artificial reef]] are placed to promote marine life. [[Cancun Underwater Museum]], or the Subaquatic Sculpture Museum, in [[Mexico]] is the largest underwater museum in the world. There are now about 500 images in the underwater museum. The last eleven images were added in September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://whatisusa.info/the-largest-underwater-museum-in-the-world/ |title=Largest underwater museum in the world |publisher=What is USA News |date=18 March 2014 |accessdate=16 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318092332/http://whatisusa.info/the-largest-underwater-museum-in-the-world/ |archivedate=18 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The specialised art museum is considered a fairly modern [[invention]], the first being the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] which was established in 1764.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

The [[Louvre]] in [[Paris]] was established in 1793, soon after the French Revolution when the royal treasures were declared for the people.&lt;ref name="McClellan"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = University of California Press|isbn = 0-520-22176-1|pages=&amp;nbsp;14–20|last = McClellan| first = Andrew| title = Inventing the Louvre: Art, Politics, and the Origins of the Modern Museum...|year =1999|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UUxG3N-t750C&amp;dq=inventing+the+louvre+luxembourg+gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Czartoryski Museum]] in [[Kraków]] was established in 1796 by [[Izabela Czartoryska|Princess Izabela Czartoryska]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.czartoryski.org/museum.htm |title=History of The Czartoryski Museum  |accessdate=5 April 2008 |work=Czartoryski }}&lt;/ref&gt; This showed the beginnings of removing art collections from the private domain of aristocracy and the wealthy into the public sphere, where they were seen as sites for educating the masses in taste and cultural refinement.

===Biographical museums===
{{mainlist|:Category: Biographical museums}}
Biographical museums are dedicated to items relating to the life of a single person or group of people, and may also display the items collected by their subjects during their lifetimes.  Some biographical museums are located in a house or other site associated with the lives of their subjects (e.g. [[Sagamore Hill (house)|Sagamore Hill]] which contains the Theodore Roosevelt Museum or The [[Keats-Shelley Memorial House]] in the [[Piazza di Spagna]], [[Rome]]). Some homes of famous people house famous collections in the sphere of the owner's expertise or interests in addition to collections of their biographical material; one such example is The [[Wellington Museum]], [[Apsley House]], [[London]], home of the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], which, in addition to biographical memorabilia of the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke]]'s life, also houses his collection world-famous paintings.  Other biographical museums, such as many of the American [[Presidential library|presidential libraries]], are housed in specially constructed buildings.

===Automobile Museums===
There are one hundred and seven automobile museums in the United States, one in Canada, and one in the Republic of Georgia{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} according to the National Association of Automobile Museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naam.museum/museum-list/|title = Museum list|website = National Association of Automobile Museums}}&lt;/ref&gt; Automobile Museums are for car fans, collectors, enthusiasts, and for families. “They speak to the imagination,” says Ken Gross, a former museum director who now curates auto exhibits at the fine arts museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/10greatplaces/2017/08/11/auto-museums/556458001/|title = 10 great auto museums worth a pit stop|work = USA Today|date = 11 August 2017|last = Bleiberg|first = Larry}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As time goes by, more and more museums dedicated to classic cars of yesteryear are opening. Many of the old classics come to life once the original owners pass away. Some are not-for-profit while others are run as a private business.

===Children's museums===
[[File:Buell Childrens Museum by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|The [[Buell Children's Museum]] in [[Pueblo, Colorado]] was ranked #2 children's art museum in the United States by ''Child Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gocolorado.com/Article.aspx?articleId=a479ebf9-0fe2-4238-912c-cccfc231f5bc&amp;type=Article Go Colorado article] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621232812/http://www.gocolorado.com/Article.aspx?articleId=a479ebf9-0fe2-4238-912c-cccfc231f5bc&amp;type=Article |date=21 June 2008 }} that mentions that Buell Children's Museum was ranked second in the United States in 2002&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Children's museums are institutions that provide exhibits and programs to stimulate [[informal learning]] experiences for [[child]]ren. In contrast with traditional museums that typically have a hands-off policy regarding exhibits, children's museums feature interactive exhibits that are designed to be manipulated by children. The theory behind such exhibits is that activity can be as educational as instruction, especially in early childhood. Most children's museums are [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] organizations, and many are run by [[Volunteering|volunteers]] or by very small professional staffs.&lt;ref name="ACM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childrensmuseums.org/ |title=The Association of Children's Museums website |publisher=Childrensmuseums.org |date= |accessdate=19 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Brooklyn Children's Museum]] was established in 1899 by the [[Brooklyn Museum|Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences]]. It is often regarded as the first children's museum in the United States.&lt;ref name="Herminia Weihsin Din 1998"&gt;Herminia Weihsin Din, "A History of Children's Museums in the United States, 1899–1997: Implications for Art Education and Museum Education in the United States," (dissertation, Ohio State University, 1998), 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea behind the Brooklyn Children's Museum implicitly acknowledged that existing American museums were not designed with children in mind. Although museums at the turn of the century viewed themselves as institutions of public education, their exhibits were often not made accessible for children, who may have struggled with simple design features like the height of exhibit cases, or the language of interpretive labels.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa C. Roberts, ''From Knowledge to Narrative: Educators and the Changing Museum'' (Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1997), 28–30.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, touching objects was often prohibited, limiting visitors' ability to interact with museum objects.

The founders of the Brooklyn Children's Museum were concerned with education and realized that no other institution had attempted to establish "a Museum that will be of especial value and interest to young people between the ages of six and twenty years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences|title =The Children's Museum of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences|location=Brooklyn|date= 1900|page = 7|url = https://books.google.com/?id=4-hPAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;dq=a+Museum+that+will+be+of+especial+value+and+interest+to+young+people+between+the+ages+of+six+and+twenty+years#v=onepage&amp;q=a%20Museum%20that%20will%20be%20of%20especial%20value%20and%20interest%20to%20young%20people%20between%20the%20ages%20of%20six%20and%20twenty%20years&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their goal was to gain children's interest and "to stimulate their powers of observation and reflection" as well as to "illustrate by collections of pictures, cartoons, charts, models, maps and so on, each of the important branches of knowledge which is taught in elementary schools."&lt;ref name="Herminia Weihsin Din 1998"/&gt;

Anna Billings Gallup, the museum's curator from 1904 to 1937, encouraged a learning technique that allowed children to "discover" information by themselves through touching and examining objects. Visitors to the museum were able to compare the composition, weight, and hardness of minerals, learn to use a microscope to examine natural objects, and build their own collections of natural objects to be displayed in a special room of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Haven Schauffler, "The Children's Museum of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences, Brooklyn, New York," ''The American Midland Naturalist'', 9 no. 5/6 (1924): 209–216.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to emphasis on allowing interaction with objects, Gallup also encouraged learning through play. She believed learning at the Brooklyn Children's Museum should be "pure fun", and to this end developed nature clubs, held field trips, brought live animals into the museum, and hired gallery instructors to lead children in classification games about animals, shells, and minerals.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Haven Schauffler, "The Children's Museum of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences, Brooklyn, New York," ''The American Midland Naturalist'', 9 no. 5/6 (1924): 208, 210, 213.&lt;/ref&gt; Other children's museums of the early twentieth century used similar techniques that emphasized learning through experience.

Children's museums often emphasize experiential learning through museum interactives, sometimes leading them to have very few or no physical collection items. The Brooklyn Children's Museum and other early children's museums grew out of the tradition of natural history museums, object-centered institutions. Over the course of the twentieth century, the children's museums slowly began to discard their objects in favor of more interactive exhibits. While children's museums are a more extreme case, it is important to note that during the twentieth century, more and more museums have elected to display fewer objects and offer more interpretation than museums of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa C. Roberts, ''From Knowledge to Narrative: Educators and the Changing Museum'' (Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1997), 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars argue that objects, while once critical to the definition of a museum, are no longer considered vital to many institutions because they are no longer necessary to fulfill the roles we expect museums to serve as museums focus more on programs, education, and their visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Do Museums Still Need Objects?|last=Conn|first=Steven|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=Philadelphia|pages=21–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Brooklyn Children's Museum opened in 1899, other American museums followed suit by opening small children's sections of their institutions designed with children in mind and equipped with interactive activities, such as the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]]'s children's room opened in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://siarchives.si.edu/blog/smithsonian-childrens-room |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302151744/http://siarchives.si.edu/blog/smithsonian-childrens-room |dead-url=no |archive-date=2 March 2016 |title=Knowledge Begins in Wonder: The Design Behind the Smithsonian Children's Room |last=Brady |first=Hillary |date=1 March 2016 |website=Smithsonian Institution Archives |publisher= |access-date=3 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Brooklyn Children's Museum also inspired other children's museums either housed separately or even developed completely independently of parent museums, like the [[Boston Children's Museum]] (1913), The Children's Museum of Detroit Public Schools (1915), and the [[The Children's Museum of Indianapolis|Children's Museum of Indianapolis]] (1925).&lt;ref&gt;Herminia Weihsin Din, "A History of Children's Museums in the United States, 1899–1997: Implications for Art Education and Museum Education in the United States," (dissertation, Ohio State University, 1998), 26–34.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of children's museums in the United States continued to grow over the course of the twentieth century, with over 40 museums opened by the 1960s and more than 70 children's museums opened to the public between 1990 and 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Herminia Weihsin Din, "A History of Children's Museums in the United States, 1899–1997: Implications for Art Education and Museum Education in the United States," (dissertation, Ohio State University, 1998), 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

International professional organizations of children's museums include the Association of Children's Museums (ACM), which was formed in 1962 as the American Association of Youth Museums (AAYM) and in 2007 counted 341 member institutions in 23 countries,&lt;ref name="ACM" /&gt; and The Hands On! Europe Association of Children's Museum (HO!E), established in 1994, with member institutions in 34 countries as of 2007.&lt;ref name="HO!E"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hands-on-europe.net/ |title=Hands On! Europe website |publisher=Hands-on-europe.net |date= |accessdate=19 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many museums that are members of ACM offer reciprocal memberships, allowing members of one museum to visit all the others for free.

===Design museums===
{{Main article|Design museum}}
[[File:Taiwan Design Museum 20130706.jpg|thumb|[[Taiwan Design Museum]] in [[Taiwan]].]]

A [[design museum]] is a museum with a focus on [[Product (business)|product]], [[Industrial design|industrial]], [[Graphics|graphic]], [[fashion]], and [[Architecture|architectural]] design.
Many design museums were founded as museums for [[applied arts]] or [[decorative arts]] and started only in the late 20th century to collect [[design]].

===Diachronic versus synchronic===
It may sometimes be useful to distinguish between [[wikt:diachronic|diachronic]] and [[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]] museums.  According to [[University of Florida]]'s Professor Eric Kilgerman, "While a museum in which a particular narrative unfolds within its halls is diachronic, those museums that limit their space to a single experience are called synchronic."&lt;ref&gt;Kilgerman, Eric.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=r5TEsqmRfA8C&amp;pg=PA255 Sites of the Uncanny: Paul Celan, Specularity and the Visual Arts]'', p. 255 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Encyclopedic museums===
Encyclopedic museums are large, mostly national, institutions that offer visitors a plethora of information on a variety of subjects that tell both local and global stories. The aim of encyclopedic museums is to provide examples of each classification available for a field of knowledge.   "When 3% of the world's population, or nearly 200 million people, living outside the country of their birth, encyclopedic museums play an especially important role in the building of civil society. They encourage curiosity about the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Season Preview—The Promise of Encyclopedic Museums |url=http://www.elginism.com/similar-cases/lecture-on-the-encyclopaedic-museum/20080823/1283/ |date = 25 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[James Cuno]], President and Director of the Art Institute of Chicago, along with Neil MacGregor, Director of the British Museum, are two of the most outspoken museum professionals who support encyclopedic museums. They state that encyclopedic museums are advantageous for society by exposing museum visitors to a wide variety of cultures, engendering a sense of a shared human history.&lt;ref&gt;James Cuno, "Museums Matter: In Praise of the Encyclopedic Museum", 2013, The University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some scholars and archaeologists, however, argue against encyclopedic museums because they remove cultural objects from their original cultural setting, losing their context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Malcolm|first=Bell III|title=Who's Right?

[[File:Museum Indonesia Main Building.jpg|thumb|[[Indonesia Museum]] in [[Taman Mini Indonesia Indah|TMII]] built in [[Balinese architecture]], is an ethnology museum displaying various artifacts and way of life of [[ethnic groups in Indonesia]].]]
Ethnology museums are a type of museum that focus on studying, collecting, preserving and displaying artifacts and objects concerning [[ethnology]] and [[anthropology]]. This type of museum usually were built in countries possessing diverse [[ethnic group]]s or significant numbers of ethnic minorities.  An example is the [[Ozurgeti History Museum]], an ethnographic museum in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].

===Historic house museums===
{{Main article|Historic house museum}}

Within the category of history museums, historic house museums are the most numerous. The earliest projects for preserving historic homes began in the 1850s under the direction of individuals concerned with the public good and the preservation of American history, especially centered on the first president. Since the establishment of America's first historic site at Washington's Revolutionary headquarters at Hasbrouck House in New York State, Americans have found a penchant for preserving similar historical structures. The establishment of historic house museums increased in popularity through the 1970s and 1980s as the Revolutionary bicentennial set off a wave of patriotism and alerted Americans to the destruction of their physical heritage. The tradition of restoring homes of the past and designating them as museums draws on the English custom of preserving ancient buildings and monuments. Initially homes were considered worthy of saving because of their associations with important individuals, usually of the elite classes, like former presidents, authors, or businessmen. Increasingly, Americans have fought to preserve structures characteristic of a more typical American past that represents the lives of everyday people including minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Butcher-Younghans|first=Sherry|title=Historic House Museums: A Practical Handbook for Their Care, Preservation, and Management|year=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=i, 1, 5.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Chambre de la Reine du Petit Trianon 004.jpg|thumb|left|The queen's chamber in [[Petit Trianon]], former residence of [[Marie Antoinette]].]] 
While historic house museums compose the largest section within the historic museum category, they usually operate with small staffs and on limited budgets. Many are run entirely by volunteers and often do not meet the professional standards established by the museum industry. An independent survey conducted by Peggy Coats in 1990 revealed that sixty-five percent of historic house museums did not have a full-time staff and 19 to 27 percent of historic homes employed only one full-time employee. Furthermore, the majority of these museums operated on less than $50,000 annually. The survey also revealed a significant disparity in the number of visitors between local house museums and national sites. While museums like Mount Vernon and Colonial Williamsburg were visited by over one million tourists a year, more than fifty percent of historic house museums received less than 5,000 visitors per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coats|first=Peggy|title=Survey of Historic House Museums|journal=History News|year=1990|volume=45|issue=1|pages=26–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These museums are also unique in that the actual structure belongs to the museum collection as a historical object. While some historic home museums are fortunate to possess a collection containing many of the original furnishings once present in the home, many face the challenge of displaying a collection consistent with the historical structure. Some museums choose to collect pieces original to the period while not original to the house. Others, fill the home with replicas of the original pieces reconstructed with the help of historic records. Still other museums adopt a more aesthetic approach and use the homes to display the architecture and artistic objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hobbs|first=Stuart D.|title=Exhibiting Antimodernism: History, Memory, and the Aestheticized Past in Mid-twentieth century America|journal=The Public Historian|date=Summer 2001|volume=23|issue=3|pages=39|doi=10.1525/tph.2001.23.3.39}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Because historic homes have often existed through different generations and have been passed on from one family to another, volunteers and professionals also must decide which historical narrative to tell their visitors. Some museums grapple with this issue by displaying different eras in the home's history within different rooms or sections of the structure. Others choose one particular narrative, usually the one deemed most historically significant, and restore the home to that particular period.

===History museums===
[[File:Tutanchamon (js) 1.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The golden funerary mask of [[Tutankhamun]], [[Egyptian Museum]] of Cairo]]
[[:Category:History museums|History museums]] cover the knowledge of [[history]] and its relevance to the present and future. Some cover specialized curatorial aspects of history or a particular locality; others are more general. Such museums contain a wide range of objects, including documents, artifacts of all kinds, art, archaeological objects. [[:Category:Archaeological museums|Antiquities museums]] specialize in more archaeological findings.

A common type of history museum is a [[historic house]]. A historic house may be a building of special architectural interest, the birthplace or home of a famous person, or a house with an interesting history. Local and national governments often create museums to their history.  The United States has many national museums for historical topics, such as the National Museum of African American History and Culture.  [[Historic site]]s can also serve as museums, such as the museum at Ford's Theater in Washington D.C.  The U.S. National Park Service defines a historic site as the "location of a significant event, a prehistoric or historic occupation or activity, or a building or structure, whether standing, ruined, or vanished, where the location itself possesses historic, cultural, or archeological value regardless of the value of any existing structure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = National Register Bulletin: How to Complete the National Register Registration Form: Appendix IV: Glossary of National Register Terms|publisher =  U.S. Department of the Interior|website =  National Park Service|url =  http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/publications/bulletins/nrb16a/nrb16a_appendix_IV.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Iron bed in Tuol Sleng prison.JPG|thumb|left|Iron bed in [[torture]] room at [[Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum]]]]
Historic sites can also mark [[Public-order crime|public crimes]], such as [[Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum]] in Phnom Penh, Cambodia or Robben Island, South Africa.   Similar to museums focused on public crimes, museums attached to memorials of public crimes often contain a history component, as is the case at the Oklahoma City National Memorial &amp; Museum.  History museums may concern more general crimes and atrocities, such as American slavery.  Often these museums are connected to a particular example, such as the proposed International African American Museum in Charleston, South Carolina, which will treat slavery as an institution with a particular focus on slavery in Charleston and South Carolina's Lowcountry.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=https://iaamuseum.org/about/intro/|website = International African American Museum |title=Intro |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Museums in cities like Charleston, South Carolina must interact with a broader heritage tourism industry where the history of the majority population is traditionally privileged over the minority.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie E. Yuhl, A Golden Haze of Memory: The Making of Historic Charleston (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2005), 14–15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Fitzhugh Brundage, The Southern Past: A Clash of Race and Memory (Cambridge: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2005), 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many specialized museums have been established such as the [[National LGBT Museum]] in New York City and the National Women's History Museum planned for the National Mall. The majority of museums across the country that tell state and local history also follow this example.Other museums have a problem interpreting colonial histories, especially at Native American historic sites. However, museums such as the [[National Museum of the American Indian]] and Ziibiwing Center of Anishinabe Culture and Lifeways in Michigan are working to share authority with indigenous groups and decolonize museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Decolonizing Museums: Representing Native America in National and Tribal Museums|last=Lonetree|first=Amy|publisher=University of North Carolina|year=2012|isbn=|location=Chapel Hill|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another type of history museum is a living history museum. A living history museum is an outdoor museum featuring reenactors in period costume, and historic or reconstructed buildings. Colonial Williamsburg is a living history museum in Virginia that represents the colony on the eve of the American Revolution in the 18th century. The 301 acre historic area includes hundreds of buildings, in their original locations, but mostly reconstructed.&lt;ref&gt;Colonial Williamsburg, "That the Future May Learn From the Past", http://www.history.org/foundation/mission.cfm, accessed 4-3-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Living history museums===

{{Main article|Living museum}}
Living history museums combine historic architecture, material culture, and costumed interpretation with natural and cultural landscapes to create an immersive learning environment. These museums include the collection, preservation or interpretation of material culture, traditional skills, and historical processes. Recreated historical settings simulating past time periods can offer the visitor a sense of traveling back in time. They are a type of open-air museum.

Two main interpretation styles dominate the visitor experience at living history museums: first and third person interpretation. In first person interpretation, interpreters assume the persona, including the speech patterns, behaviors, views, and dress of a historical figure from the museum's designated time period. In third person interpretation, the interpreters openly acknowledge themselves to be a contemporary of the museum visitor. The interpreter is not restricted by being in-character and can speak to the visitor about society from a modern-day perspective.

The beginnings of the living history museum can be traced back to 1873 with the opening of the [[Skansen]] Museum near Stockholm, Sweden. The museum's founder, [[Artur Hazelius]], began the museum by using his personal collection of buildings and other cultural materials of pre-industrial society.&lt;ref name="Living History"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alhfam.org/?cat_id=153&amp;nav_tree=153 |title=Living History |publisher=The Association for Living History, Farm, and Agricultural Museums |accessdate=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This museum began as an open-air museum and, by 1891, had several farm buildings in which visitors could see exhibits and where guides demonstrated crafts and tools.&lt;ref name="Leiterman 1983 14"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Leiterman |first=Eloise Lee |title=The Pros and Cons of "Living History" and some of the unpredictable hazards |journal=Christian Science Monitor |volume=1 |date=1 August 1983 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For years, living history museums were relatively nonexistent outside of [[Scandinavia]], though some military garrisons in North America used some living history techniques. Living history museums in the United States were initially established by entrepreneurs, such as [[John D. Rockefeller]] and [[Henry Ford]], and since then have proliferated within the museum world. Some of the earliest living history museums in the United States include [[Colonial Williamsburg]] (1926), [[Greenfield Village]] (1929), [[Conner Prairie]] Pioneer Settlement (1930s), [[Old Sturbridge Village]] (1946), and [[Plimoth Plantation]] (1947). Many living history farms and similar farm and agricultural museums have united under an association known as the Association for Living History, Farm, and Agricultural Museums (ALHFAM).&lt;ref name="Living History"/&gt;

===Maritime museums===
[[File:PolandSzczecinPanorama.JPG|thumb|[[National Museum, Szczecin|Maritime Museum]] in [[Szczecin]], [[Poland]].]]
{{Main article|Maritime museum}}
[[Maritime museum]]s are museums that specialize in the presentation of maritime history, culture, or archaeology. They explore the relationship between societies and certain bodies of water. Just as there is a wide variety of museum types, there are also many different types of maritime museums. First, as mentioned above, maritime museums can be primarily archaeological. These museums focus on the interpretation and preservation of shipwrecks and other artifacts recovered from a maritime setting. A second type is the maritime history museum, dedicated to educating the public about humanity's maritime past. Examples are the [[San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park]] and [[Mystic Seaport]]. Military-focused maritime museums are a third variety, of which the [[Intrepid Sea, Air &amp; Space Museum]] and [[USS Iowa Museum|Battleship IOWA Museum]] are examples.

===Medical museums===
{{See also|Medical History Museum (disambiguation){{!}}Medical History Museum}}
[[File:Museum of Medical Humanities.JPG|thumb|[[Museum of Medical Humanities]] in [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]].]]
Medical museums today are largely an extinct subtype of museum with a few notable exceptions, such as the [[Mütter Museum]] in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and the [[Hunterian Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons]] in Glasgow, Scotland. The origins of the medical museum date back to [[Renaissance]] [[Cabinet of curiosities|cabinets of curiosities]] which often featured displays of human skeletal material and other [[materia medica]]. Apothecaries and physicians collected specimens as a part of their professional activities and to increase their professional status among their peers.&lt;ref name="Findlen 1994 246"&gt;{{cite book|last=Findlen|first=Paula|title=Possessing Nature: Museums, Collecting, and Scientific Culture in Early Modern Italy|date=1994|publisher=Regents of the University of California|place=Berkeley and Los Angeles|page=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the medical profession placed greater emphasis on teaching and the practice of materia medica in the late 16th century, medical collections became a fundamental component of a medical student's education.&lt;ref name="Findlen 1994 246"/&gt; New developments in preserving soft tissue samples long term in spirits appeared in the 17th century, and by the mid-18th century physicians like [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]] were using personal anatomical collections as teaching tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alberti|first=Sam|title=Medical Museums: Past, Present, and Future|journal=The Royal College of Surgeons of England Bulletin|volume=93|issue=2|date=2011|page=56|doi=10.1308/147363511x552548}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 19th century, many hospitals and medical colleges in Great Britain had built sizable teaching collections. In the United States, the nation's first hospital, the Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia, already had a collection of plaster casts and crayon drawings of the stages of pregnancy as early as 1762.&lt;ref name="McLeary 2000 599"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McLeary|first=Erin|title=The Mütter Museum: Preservation, Education, and Commemoration|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|volume=132|issue=7|date=2000|page=599|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-132-7-200004040-00033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical museums functioned as an integral part of medical students education through the 19th century and into the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="McLeary 2000 599"/&gt; Dry and wet anatomical specimens, casts, drawings, oil paintings, and photographs provided a means for medical students to compare healthy anatomical specimens with abnormal, or diseased organs. Museums, like the Mütter, added medical instruments and equipment to their collections to preserve and teach the history of the medical profession. By the 1920s, medical museums had reached their nadir and began to wane in their importance as institutes of medical knowledge and training. Medical teaching shifted towards training medical students in hospitals and laboratories, and over the course of the 20th century most medical museums disappeared from the museum horizon. The few surviving medical museums, like the Mütter Museum, have managed to survive by broadening their mission of preserving and disseminating medical knowledge to include the general public, rather than exclusively catering to medical professionals.

===Memorial museums===
[[File:9-11 Memorial South Pool.jpg|thumb|[[National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum]] in [[New York City]].]]
Memorial museums are museums dedicated both to educating the public about and commemorating a specific historic event, usually involving mass suffering. The concept gained traction throughout the 20th century as a response to the numerous and well publicized mass atrocities committed during that century. The events commemorated by memorial museums tend to involve mostly civilian victims who died under "morally problematic circumstances" that cannot easily be interpreted as heroic. There are frequently unresolved issues concerning the identity, culpability, and punishment of the perpetrators of these killings and memorial museums often play an active research role aimed at benefiting both the victims and those prosecuting the perpetrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Paul|title=Memorial Museums: the Global Rush to Commemorate Atrocities|date=2007|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|isbn=9781845204891|pages=8; 20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today there are numerous prominent memorial museums including the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]], the [[Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum|Toul Sleng Museum of Genocidal Crimes in Phnom Penh, Cambodia]], the [[District Six Museum]] in Cape Town, South Africa, and the [[National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum]] in [[New York City]]. Although the concept of a memorial museum is largely a product of the 20th century, there are museums of this type that focus on events from other periods, an example being the [[House of Slaves (Gorée)|House of Slaves (Maisons des Esclaves)]] in Senegal which was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1978 and acts as a museum and memorial to the Atlantic slave trade.

Memorial museums differ from traditional history museums in several key ways, most notably in their dual mission to incorporate both a moral framework for and contextual explanations of an event. While traditional history museums tend to be in neutral institutional settings, memorial museums are very often situated at the scene of the atrocity they seek to commemorate. Memorial museums also often have close connections with, and advocate for, a specific clientele who have a special relationship to the event or its victims, such as family members or survivors, and regularly hold politically significant special events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Paul|title=Memorial Museums: the Global Rush to Commemorate Atrocities|date=2007|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|isbn=9781845204891|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike many traditional history museums, memorial museums almost always have a distinct, overt political and moral message with direct ties to contemporary society. The following mission statement of the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] is typical in its focus on commemoration, education and advocacy:

"The museum's primary mission is to advance and disseminate knowledge about this unprecedented tragedy; to preserve the memory of those who suffered; and to encourage its visitors to reflect upon the moral and spiritual questions raised by the events of the Holocaust as well as their own responsibilities as citizens of a democracy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission Statement USHMM |url=http://www.ushmm.org/information/about-the-museum/mission-statement |accessdate=29 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519154448/http://www.ushmm.org/information/about-the-museum/mission-statement |archivedate=19 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military and war museums{{anchor|military museum}} &lt;!-- multiple articles direct to this anchor --&gt;===
[[File:Canadianwarmuseummgs.jpg|thumb|The [[Canadian War Museum]].]]
{{Category see also|Military and war museums}}
Military museums specialize in military histories; they are often organized from a national point of view, where a museum in a particular country will have displays organized around conflicts in which that country has taken part. They typically include displays of [[weapon]]s and other military equipment, [[Military uniform|uniforms]], wartime [[propaganda]], and exhibits on civilian life during wartime, and [[Military orders, awards and decorations|decorations]], among others. A military museum may be dedicated to a particular or area, such as the [[Imperial War Museum Duxford]] for military [[aircraft]], [[German Tank Museum|Deutsches Panzermuseum]] for [[tank]]s, the [[Lange Max Museum]] for the [[Western Front (World War I)]], the [[International Spy Museum]] for espionage, [[Liberty Memorial#The National World War I Museum|The National World War I Museum]] for [[World War I]], the [[D-Day Paratroopers Historical Center]] (Normandy) for WWII airborne, or more generalist, such as the [[Canadian War Museum]] or the [[Musée de l'Armée]].
For the Italian alpine wall one can find the most popular museum of bunkers in the small museum [https://www.n8bunker.com/ n8bunker] at Olang / Kronplatz in the heard of the dolomites of [[South Tyrol]].

===Mobile museums===
'''Mobile museum''' is a term applied to museums that make exhibitions from a vehicle- such as a van. Some institutions, such as [[St. Vital Historical Society]] and the [[Walker Art Center]], use the term to refer to a portion of their collection that travels to sites away from the museum for educational purposes. Other mobile museums have no "home site", and use travel as their exclusive means of presentation. University of Louisiana in Lafayette has also created a mobile museum as part of the graduate program in History. The project is called [[Museum on the Move]].

===Natural history museums===

{{mainlist|List of natural history museums}}
Museums of [[natural history]] and [[natural science]] typically exhibit work of the natural world. The focus lies on nature and culture. Exhibitions educate the public on natural history, dinosaurs, zoology, oceanography, anthropology, and more. Evolution, environmental issues, and biodiversity are major areas in natural science museums. Notable museums include the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in [[London]], the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]] in [[Oxford]], the [[National Museum of Natural History (France)|Muséum national d'histoire naturelle]] in [[Paris]], the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Museum of Natural History]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in [[New York City]], and the [[Canadian Museum of Nature]] in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]].

===Open-air museums===
{{Main article|Open-air museum}}
[[File:Oscar1888.jpg|thumb|The open-air museum of King [[Oscar II of Sweden|Oscar II]] at [[Bygdøy]] near [[Oslo]] in the museum guide of 1888. The World's first open-air museum was founded in 1881.]]
[[File:Farmhouse museum.JPG|thumb|An old [[farmhouse]] at the ''Salzburger Freilichtmuseum'' in Großgmain near [[Salzburg]].]]
[[Open-air museum]]s collect and re-erect old buildings at large outdoor sites, usually in settings of re-created landscapes of the past. The first one was [[Oscar II of Sweden|King Oscar II]]'s collection near [[Oslo]] in [[Norway]], opened in 1881. In 1907, it was incorporated into the [[Norwegian Museum of Cultural History|Norsk Folkemuseum]].&lt;ref&gt;Roede, Lars (1993). "The Open-air Museum Idea. An Early Contribution".

===Pop-up museums===
A concept developed in the 1990s, the pop-up museum is generally defined as a short term institution existing in a temporary space.&lt;ref name="museum 2.0"&gt;[http://museumtwo.blogspot.com/2011/11/radical-simple-formula-for-pop-up.html Simon, Nina K.], Museum 2.0 blog re: pop-up museums, their construction, and usefulness within the profession.&lt;/ref&gt; These temporary museums are finding increasing favor among more progressive museum professionals as a means of direct community involvement with objects and exhibition. Often, the pop-up concept relies solely on visitors to provide both the objects on display and the accompanying labels with the professionals or institution providing only the theme of the pop-up and the space in which to display the objects, an example of [[shared historical authority]]. Due to the flexibility of the pop-up museums and their rejection of traditional structure, even these latter provisions need not be supplied by an institution; in some cases the themes have been chosen collectively by a committee of interested participants while exhibitions designated as pop-ups have been mounted in places as varied as community centers and even a walk-in closet.&lt;ref name="MONA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.detroitmona.com/mona_pop-up_museum.htm|title=MONA: A Pop-Up Museum|publisher=|accessdate=4 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923213916/http://www.detroitmona.com/mona_pop-up_museum.htm|archivedate=23 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some examples of pop-up museums include:
* [[Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History]] (MAH), which currently hosts collaborative Pop Up Museums around Santa Cruz County.
* [[Museum of New Art]] (MONA) – founded in Detroit, Michigan in 1996 this contemporary art museum is generally acknowledged to be the pioneer of the concept of the pop-up museum.&lt;ref name="MONA" /&gt;
* [[The Pop-Up Museum of Queer History]] – a series of pop-up museum events held at various sites across the United States focusing on the history and stories of local LGBT communities.&lt;ref name="Queer Museum"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.queermuseum.com/|deadurl=no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180825185715/http://www.queermuseum.com/|archivedate = 25 August 2018|title = Pop-Up Museum of Queer History website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science museums===
{{mainlist|List of science museums}}
[[File:MSIChicago.JPG|thumb|left|[[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]] in [[Chicago]].]]
[[Science museum]]s and technology centers or [[technology museum]]s revolve around scientific achievements, and marvels and their history. To explain complicated inventions, a combination of demonstrations, interactive programs and thought-provoking media are used. Some museums may have exhibits on topics such as [[computer]]s, [[aviation]], [[List of railway museums|railway museums]], [[physics]], [[astronomy]], and the [[animal|animal kingdom]]. The [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]] in [[Chicago]] is a very popular museum.

Science museums traditionally emphasize cultural heritage through objects of intrinsic value, echoes of the 'curiosity cabinets' of the Renaissance period. These early museums of science represented a fascination with collecting which emerged in the fifteenth century from 'an attempt to manage the empirical explosion of materials that wider dissemination of ancient texts, increased travel, voyages of discovery, and more systematic forms of communication and exchange had produced.&lt;ref&gt;Findlen, P. (1994) Possessing nature: Museums, collecting, and scientific culture in early modern Italy. Los Angeles: University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Science museums were institutions of authoritative, uncontestable, knowledge, places of 'collecting, seeing and knowing, places where "anybody" might come and survey the evidence of science.&lt;ref name="MACDONALD, S. 1998"&gt;MacDonald, S. (Ed.) (1998) The politics of display: Museums, science, culture. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Dinosaurs, extensive invertebrate and vertebrate collections, plant taxonomies, and so on – these were the orders of the day. By the nineteenth century, science museums had flourished, and with it 'the capacity of exhibitionary representation to render the world as visible and ordered... part of the instantiation of wider senses of scientific and political certainty' (MacDonald, 1998: 11). By the twentieth century, museums of science had built 'on their earlier emphasis on public education to present themselves as experts in the mediation between the obscure world of science and that of the public.&lt;ref name="MACDONALD, S. 1998"/&gt;
[[File:Diplodocus Minnesota Science Museum.jpg|thumb|left|Diplodocus fossil exhibit in [[Minnesota Science Museum]].]]
The nineteenth century also brought a proliferation of science museums with roots in technical and industrial heritage museums.&lt;ref name = rennie&gt;Rennie, L.J. &amp; McClafferty, T. (1996) Science centers and science learning. Studies in Science Education, 27, 53–98.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ordinarily, visitors individually interact with exhibits, by a combination of manipulating, reading, pushing, pulling, and generally using their senses. Information is carefully structured through engaging, interactive displays. Science centers include interactive exhibits that respond to the visitor's action and invite further response, as well as hands-on exhibits that do not offer feedback to the visitor,&lt;ref name = rennie/&gt; In general, science centers offer 'a decontextualized scattering of interactive exhibits, which can be thought of as exploring stations of ideas &lt;ref&gt;McManus, P. (1992) Topics in museums and science education. Studies in Science Education, 20, 157–182.&lt;/ref&gt; usually presented in small rooms or galleries, with scant attention paid to applications of science, social political contexts, or moral and ethical implications.

By the 1960s, these interactive science centers with their specialized hands-on galleries became prevalent. The [[Exploratorium]] in San Francisco, and the [[Ontario Science Centre]] in 1969, were two of the earliest examples of science centers dedicated to exploring scientific principles through hands-on exhibits. In the United States practically every major city has a science center with a total annual visitation of 115 million &lt;ref&gt;Koster, E.H. (1999) In search of relevance: Science centers as innovators in the evolution of museums. Daedalus, 28(3), 277–296.&lt;/ref&gt; New technologies of display and new interpretive experiments mark these interactive science centers, and the mantra 'public understanding of science' aptly describes their central activity.&lt;ref name="MACDONALD, S. 1998"/&gt;

Science museums, in particular, may consist of [[planetarium|planetaria]], or large theatre usually built around a dome. Museums may have [[IMAX]] feature films, which may provide [[3D film|3-D]] viewing or higher quality picture. As a result, IMAX content provides a more immersive experience for people of all ages.

Also new virtual museums, known as ''Net Museums'', have recently been created. These are usually websites belonging to real museums and containing photo galleries of items found in those real museums. This new presentation is very useful for people living far away who wish to see the contents of these museums.

===Specialized museums===
[[File:Cuckooland Museum clocks by Kirsty Davies.jpg|thumb|upright|Antique cuckoo clocks in the interior of [[Cuckooland Museum]].]]

A number of different museums exist to demonstrate a variety of topics. Music museums may celebrate the life and work of [[Lists of composers|composers]] or [[musician]]s, such as the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum]] in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], or even the [[Rimsky-Korsakov Apartment and Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]]. Other music museums include live music recitals, such as the [[Handel House Museum]] in [[London]], [[England]].

In [[Glendale, Arizona]], the Bead Museum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beadmuseumaz.org/ |title=The Bead Museum |publisher=Beadmuseumaz.org |date= |accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  fosters an appreciation and understanding of the global, historical, cultural, and artistic significance of beads and related artifacts dating as far back as 15,000 years. Also residing in the American Southwest are living history towns such as [[Tombstone, Arizona]]. This historical town is home to a number of "living history" museums (such as the [[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral|O.K. Corral]] and the [[The Tombstone Epitaph|Tombstone Epitaph]]) in which visitors can learn about historical events from actors playing the parts of historical figures like [[Wyatt Earp]], [[Doc Holliday]], and [[John Clum]]. [[Colonial Williamsburg]] (in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]]), is another great example of a town devoted to preserving the story of America through reenactment.

[[File:AIG museum.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Creation Museum]] is a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[creationism]] museum run by [[Answers in Genesis]].]]
[[South Korea]] is host to the world's first museum devoted to the history and development of [[organic farming]], the [[Namyangju]] Organic Museum, with exhibit captions in both Korean and English, and which opened in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John (2011) [http://orgprints.org/20571/1/Paull2011JBDT.NamyangjuMuseum.pdf  "A Postcard from Korea: Worldʼs First Organic Agriculture Museum"], Journal of Bio-Dynamics Tasmania, 104:11–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[No Show Museum]], based in Zurich and Johannesburg, is the world's first museum dedicated to nothing and its various manifestations throughout the history of art.

Museums targeted for youth, such as [[children's museum]]s or [[toy museum]]s in many parts of the world, often exhibit interactive and educational material on a wide array of topics, for example, the [[Museum of Toys and Automata]] in Spain. The [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum]] and the "Borusseum", the museum about [[Borussia Dortmund]] in [[Dortmund]], [[Germany]], are institutions of the sports category. The [[Corning Museum of Glass]] is devoted to the art, history, and science of [[glass]]. The [[National Museum of Crime &amp; Punishment]] explores the science of solving crimes. The Great American Dollhouse Museum in Danville, Kentucky, depicts American social history in miniature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedollhousemuseum.com |title=The Great American Dollhouse Museum |publisher=Thedollhousemuseum.com |date= |accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Interpretation centre]]s are modern museums or visitors centres that often use new means of communication with the public. In some cases, museums cover an extremely wide range of topics together, such as the [[Museum of World Treasures]] in Wichita, KS. In other instances, museums emphasize regional culture and natural history, such as the [[Regional Museum of the National University of San Martin]], Tarapoto, [[Peru]]. The [[Museum of Salt and Pepper Shakers]] shows the history and variety of an everyday item.

===Virtual museums===
A development, with the expansion of the [[World Wide Web|web]], is the establishment of [[virtual museum]]s and online exhibitions. Online initiatives like the [[Virtual Museum of Canada]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.virtualmuseum.ca |title=Virtual Museum of Canada – Musée virtuel du Canada |accessdate=5 April 2008 |work=virtualmuseum.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]] provide physical museums with a web presence. Online [[curatorial platform]]s such as Rhizome&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rhizome.org |title=Rhizome |accessdate=5 April 2008 |work=Rhizome }}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Archive of Digital Art (ADA)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalartarchive.at/nc/home.html|title= ADA {{!}} Archive of Digital Art|website=www.digitalartarchive.at|language=en-EN|access-date=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed online exhibitions that transform the museal experience within the digital space.

Some virtual museums have no counterpart in the real world, such as LIMAC (Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Lima),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://li-mac.org/ |title=LiMAC – Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Lima |accessdate=5 April 2008 |work=LiMAC }}&lt;/ref&gt; which has no physical location and might be confused with the city's own museum. The art historian [[Griselda Pollock]] elaborated a virtual [[feminism|feminist]] museum, spreading between classical art to contemporary art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encounters in the Virtual Feminist Museum |last=Pollock |first=Griselda |authorlink=Griselda Pollock |coauthors= |year=2007 |publisher=Routledge |location= |isbn=0415413745 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some real life museums are also using the internet for virtual tours and exhibitions. In 2010, the [[Whitney Museum of American Art|Whitney Museum]] in New York organized what it called the first ever online Twitter museum tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.whitney.org/Events/2010BiennialTwitterTour | title=Biennial Twitter Tour | publisher=[[Whitney Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zoological parks and botanic gardens===

{{Main article|Zoo}}
{{Main article|Botanical garden}}
Although zoos and botanical gardens are not often thought of as museums, they are in fact "living museums". They exist for the same purpose as other museums: to educate, inspire action, and to study, develop, and manage collections. They are also managed much like other museums and face the same challenges. Notable zoos include the [[San Diego Zoo]], the [[London Zoo]], [[Brookfield Zoo]] at Chicago, [[Berlin Zoological Garden]], the [[Bronx Zoo]] in New York City, [[Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden]], [[Jardin des Plantes]] in [[Paris]], and [[Zürich Zoologischer Garten]] in [[Switzerland]]. Notable botanic gardens include [[The New York Botanical Garden]], [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]], [[Brooklyn Botanic Garden]], [[Chicago Botanic Garden]], [[Taipei Botanical Garden]], [[Bogor Botanical Garden]], and [[Royal Botanical Gardens (Ontario)]].

The '''National Computing Centre''' ('''NCC''') was an independent not-for-profit membership and research organisation in the UK.

After the original organisation was liquidated in 2010, Redholt Limited changed its name to the '''National Computing Centre Limited''' (NCC Ltd) and acquired the assets of the original NCC through a [[Pre-packaged insolvency|pre-pack administration arrangement]].  This new for-profit company, formed in 2010, initially offered some of the same the services as the original NCC but in 2012 became a [[shell company]] as it had to file for protection from its creditors and make most of its staff redundant.

==Formation and early years==
The National Computing Centre was founded on 10 June 1966 by the Labour government, as an autonomous not-for-profit organisation, in order to be the "voice of the computer user", encourage the growth of computer usage in the UK and ensure that the necessary education and training was made available. NCC was one of the visible outcomes from [[Harold Wilson]]'s "[[White heat of technology|White Heat of Technology]]" speech and the formation of a [[Ministry of Technology]], the others being the computer company [[International Computers Limited]] (ICL) and chip maker [[INMOS]] (both now defunct).

Initially, most income came directly from government grants, but with the growth of NCC's commercial operations&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2006/06/06/216267/ncc-40-years-on-towards-a-new-age-of-innovation.htm ''"...the NCC survived initially thanks to Filetab, a ground-breaking piece of interoperable report generating software it developed for mainframes..."''], ComputerWeekly.com&lt;/ref&gt; this ceased in 1989. During the 1970s and 1980s NCC had a joint venture with Blackwell Publishing (NCC Blackwell) which was a significant publisher of academic computing books.

Between 1989 and 1996 NCC operated with five main divisions – education, consulting, escrow, membership services, and system engineering deriving income from membership fees and its commercial activities.

==NCC Education==
In 1996, the National Computing Centre sold its overseas education business, [[NCC Education]], to stave off a financial crisis that occurred when the company breached its borrowing limits.

==MBO, NCC Services Ltd and NCC Group plc==
In 1999, it sold its commercial divisions (turnover of less than £10m), which provided escrow, consultancy, system engineering services to its existing management team supported by ECI ventures for £5m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecipartners.com/news-and-media/news/ncc-is-winning-investment-for-eci.go |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426055523/http://www.ecipartners.com/news-and-media/news/ncc-is-winning-investment-for-eci.go |archivedate=26 April 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; This new company was named NCC Services Limited and later became [[NCC Group]] Limited &lt;ref name="NCC, About"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nccgroup.com/AboutUs/History.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926074059/http://www.nccgroup.com/AboutUs/History.aspx |archivedate=26 September 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; of which the National Computing Centre held a 20% share. John Perkins became the new Managing Director of National Computing Centre, which remained a not-for-profit membership organisation.

The NCC Services Ltd management team of Managing Director Chris Pearse and directors John Morris, Peter Bird, and Chris Sadler was strengthened in March 2000 by the appointment of Rob Cotton as Finance Director and who also took over control of the Escrow division in May of that year,&lt;ref name="NCC, About" /&gt; with Morris leaving at that time. Following a substantial fall off of revenues as [[Y2K]] came and passed, and due to the failure of the company before this date to invest in its general consultancy, security, system engineering and escrow business during the Y2K period, the group began to make monthly losses before the benefits of the changes to the escrow business instigated by Rob Cotton were felt and the company returned to profitability.

Renamed NCC Group, in May 2000, and with escrow now the cornerstone of the group, Rob Cotton led a secondary [[management buy-out]] in 2003 valuing NCC Group at £30m and supported by [[Barclays Private Equity]].&lt;ref name="NCC, About" /&gt; At this point, the National Computing Centre sold its shares in NCC Group as did Pearse, Bird and Sadler who left the business. The NCC Group subsequently floated on the AIM stock market in 2004 for £55m and was listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]] in 2007 with a market capitalisation of nearly £390m as of June 2014.

==Failure==
NCC received substantial proceeds from the sale of NCC Group Limited (circa £11M between 2000 and 2003 plus dividends) and from the multi-million sale of its iconic Manchester city centre buildings (Armstrong House and Oxford House, now the home of NCC Group plc) to Bruntwood Group. Following the retirement of Perkins, Michael Gough&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.linkedin.com/in/mgough |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120720125439/http://uk.linkedin.com/in/mgough |archivedate=20 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; was appointed as CEO in 2000 and NCC pursued a new strategy of rapidly developing and expanding its membership services by acquisition.

In 2002 NCC adopted a policy of vigorous support for [[open-source software]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240043842/NCC-to-champion-open-source |title=NCC to champion open source |website=Computerweekly.com |date=2002-01-17 |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the six years from 2000, and particularly after the second sale of its shares in NCC Group in 2003, acquisitions accelerated until all of the company's funds had been used to acquire a number of related companies, membership organisations, publications, publishing rights and to fund joint ventures. The acquisitions included: Management Consultancy News; Conspectus; CIO Connect; The Construction Industry Computing Association; Certus; The Evaluation Centre; Institute of IT Training; The Impact Programme; and PMP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pressreleasepoint.com/national-computing-centre-ncc-acquires-pmp-uk-ltdnotes-editors |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120907184527/http://www.pressreleasepoint.com/national-computing-centre-ncc-acquires-pmp-uk-ltdnotes-editors |archivedate=7 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.computerweekly.com/feature/NCC-40-years-on-towards-a-new-age-of-innovation |title=NCC: 40 years on - towards a new age of innovation |website=Computerweekly.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publishing rights acquired included the Naked Leader and joint ventures included: the NCC/Ashridge Business School MBA; NCC/AQA Applied ICT; and ProfIT.

Funds were also spent on a major refurbishment of offices in Manchester, developing a quickly redundant hosting centre and leasing opulent offices in London, all of which was entirely inappropriate for an organisation of this size. Additionally, funds were spent attempting to develop new products and services including The Open Source Academy, The Evaluation Centre and NCC Midas Web Hosting all of which proved commercially unsuccessful.

There was also an expensive re-branding exercise in which NCC re-branded as Principia,&lt;ref &gt;{{cite web|author=John Riley |author2=Julia Vowler |url=http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240062500/Principia-to-deliver-NCC-services |title=Principia to deliver NCC services |website=Computerweekly.com |date=2004-09-27 |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; a brand that was quickly dropped and the NCC brand resumed, a move that seemed to echo a similarly named and equally disastrous re-branding of the UK [[Royal Mail]] to [[Consignia]].

The strategy initiated and implemented by Michael Gough totally failed and the National Computing Centre diminished rapidly in size and turnover. With the many millions received now spent, NCC continued to make unsustainable losses but there was no change in strategic direction. By 2007 to stem the losses NCC was forced to rapidly close or dispose of many of the acquisitions at a vast loss to the organisation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realwire.com/releases/management-team-acquires-cio-connect-from-national-computing-centre |title=Management team acquires CIO Connect from National Computing Centre |website=Realwire.com |date=2008-02-18 |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to close a number of only recently established operations. Michael Gough left the business in February 2008.

In March 2008, Steve Markwell was appointed as Chief Executive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/dir/Steve/Markwell |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120729010407/http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/dir/Steve/Markwell |archivedate=29 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but there was no improvement in the company's fortunes or significant change in strategic direction.  The only significant asset remaining, [[Filetab]], was transferred in 2009 to a new company called NCC Filetab whose Managing Director was also Managing Director of NCC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filetab.co.uk/news1.html |title=NCC Filetab |publisher=Filetab.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; With losses and the size of the pension fund deficit increasing, the company was unable to meet its obligations and was placed into administration by its management.

==Administration, liquidation and pre-pack==
In February 2010, NCC went into administration and ultimately liquidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/59719/notices/1313987 |title=The National Computing Centre Ltd |website=London-gazette.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The few remaining assets and intellectual property rights were transferred in a "pre-pack" administration arrangement to Redholt Ltd a new private company, thus distancing the new company from the NCC creditors, which included a substantial pension fund liability resulting in the insolvency of the pension fund later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/59789/notices/1365570 |title=Notices under the Trustee Act 1925 |website=London-gazette.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Redholt Ltd  was owned by a group of six shareholders, including former managers and two Directors of the insolvent National Computing Centre

Redholt Ltd, was renamed as The National Computing Centre Limited (NCC Ltd) in Feb 2011. In 2011 NCC Ltd extended its portfolio of services to include IT consulting, mainly as a virtual organisation through the use of independent associate consultants. The 'new' NCC Ltd was not a mutual not-for-profit organisation, but retained some of the member organisations of the liquidated company and initially it delivered some of the same products and services.

By the end of 2011, the 'new' NCC Ltd once again faced financial difficulties and in 2012 it sought voluntary arrangements with its creditors to step away from its debts.  The company had run up substantial losses, had not paid suppliers and had not filed accounts. Nearly all staff were laid off and the business having already left its iconic building in 2010 it finally left Manchester. The company was formally recorded at [[Companies House]] as being insolvent and in a voluntary arrangement as of 2 March 2012. The insolvency practitioner dealing with the companies affairs was Wilkins Kennedy of London. It would appear that from this point NCC Ltd was no longer recognised by any trade body, association or any part of government as the "voice of the computer user"{{fact|date=April 2018}} and offered no substantial services to its client base and became a shell company. In July 2013 the registered address was changed to an [[accommodation address]]  in London and between then and July 2017 the operational address was at times listed as Aston Abbotts in Buckinghamshire, Bournemouth and Welwyn Garden City.

In July 2017 NCC Ltd changed its name to IT Accreditations Limited&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/07189938/filing-history|title=THE NATIONAL COMPUTING CENTRE LIMITED - Filing history (free information from Companies House)|website=beta.companieshouse.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ncc.co.uk domain name and company name became the property of NCC Group plc, so ending 50 years of an organisation trading as The National Computing Centre.

An '''online learning community''' is a public or private destination on the [[Internet]] that addresses the learning needs of its members by facilitating peer-to-peer learning. Through [[social network]]ing and [[computer-mediated communication]], or the use of [[datagogies]] while people work as a community to achieve a shared learning objective. Learning objectives may be proposed by the community owner or may arise out of discussions between participants that reflect personal interests.  In an online learning community, people share knowledge via textual discussion (synchronous or asynchronous), audio, video, or other Internet-supported media.  [[Blogs]] blend personal journaling with social networking to create environments with opportunities for reflection.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

According to [[Etienne Wenger]], online [[learning community|learning communities]] are environments conducive to [[communities of practice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Wenger | first=Etienne | authorlink=Etienne Wenger | year=1998 | title=Communities of Practice: Learning, Meaning, and Identity | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge | isbn=978-0-521-66363-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Categories==
Types of online learning communities include e-learning communities (groups interact and connect solely via technology) and blended learning communities (groups utilize face-to-face meetings as well as online meetings). Based on Riel and Polin (2004), intentional online learning communities may be categorized as knowledge-based, practice-based, and task-based. Online learning communities may focus on personal aspects, process, or technology. They may use technology and tools in many categories:
* synchronous (such as [[instant messaging]] or language exchange websites and mobile applications
* asynchronous (such as [[message board]]s and [[Internet forum]]s)
* blogs
* [[online communication between school and home|course management]]
* collaborative (such as [[wiki]]s)
* social networking
* social learning
* online universities
* skills and language exchange platforms

The '''''Re-Mission''''' games for young cancer patients were conceived by Pam Omidyar and designed based research by the nonprofit [[HopeLab|HopeLab Foundation]], with direct input from young cancer patients and oncology doctors and nurses, and game developer [[Realtime Associates]], among others. The games engage young cancer patients through entertaining game play while impacting specific psychological and behavioral outcomes associated with successful cancer treatment. HopeLab has made ''Re-Mission'' games available at no charge to young people with cancer and their families, as well as oncology healthcare workers and institutions around the world.

==''Re-Mission''==
The original ''Re-Mission'' game was released in 2006 as a [[Microsoft Windows]] based [[third-person shooter]] based in the [[serious games]] genre. In ''Re-Mission'', the player controls an RX5-E ("Roxxi") [[Nanorobotics|nanobot]] who is designed to be injected into the human body and fight particular types of cancer and related infections such as [[Non hodgkins lymphoma|non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]] and [[leukemia]], at a [[cell (biology)|cellular]] level. The player must also monitor patient health and report any symptoms back to Dr. West (the in-game doctor and project leader). Each of the 20 [[Level (computer and video games)|levels]] is designed to inform the patient on a variety of treatments, how they function, and the importance of maintaining strict adherence to those treatments. Various "weapons" are used, such as the Chemoblaster, Radiation Gun, and antibiotic rocket.

Copies of ''Re-Mission'' were distributed at no charge to others, though donations were accepted. As of 2012, more than 200,000 copies of ''Re-Mission'' had been distributed in 81 countries, placing it among the most successful serious games to date. HopeLab engaged organizations and individuals worldwide to facilitate distribution of the game to teens and young adults with cancer. On May 30, 2007, [[Cigna|Cigna HealthCare]] announced a partnership with HopeLab in which Cigna distributes copies of ''Re-Mission'' to its members at no cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://newsroom.cigna.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=715|title=Cigna HealthCare Teams with HopeLab to Help Blast Teen Cancer}}&lt;/ref&gt; HopeLab has also partnered with Starlight Children's Foundation and the [[Entertainment Software Association|ESA]] Foundation to distribute Re-Mission.

==''Re-Mission 2''==
''Re-Mission 2 is'' the follow-up game released in 2006. A collection of free online games, ''Re-Mission 2'' is designed to improve psychological and behavioral outcomes associated with cancer treatment adherence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.re-mission2.org/#/research|title=HopeLab website, Re-Mission research}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each game puts players inside the body to fight cancer with weapons like chemotherapy, antibiotics and the body’s natural defenses. Game play parallels real-world strategies used to fight cancer and win. More than 120 young people with cancer participated in the research and development of the games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/8/prweb11036347.htm|title=New Cancer-Fighting Game App Goes Global}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Re-Mission 2'' applies insights from a [http://www.prweb.com/releases/2012/3/prweb9293984.htm brain-imaging study] published in 2012 by HopeLab and Stanford University researchers, showing that the Re-Mission video game strongly activates brain circuits involved in positive motivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0033909|title=Interactivity and Reward-Related Neural Activation during a Serious Videogame}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This reward-related activation is associated with a shift in attitudes and emotions that helped boost players’ adherence to prescribed chemotherapy and antibiotic treatments in a previous study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/122/2/e305.full|title=A Video Game Improves Behavioral Outcomes in Adolescents and Young Adults With Cancer: A Randomized Trial}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, each ''Re-Mission 2'' game is designed to boost positive emotion, increase self-efficacy, and shift attitudes toward chemotherapy.

Each ''Re-Mission 2'' game puts players inside the body to defeat cancer, using weapons like chemotherapy, antibiotics and the body’s immune cells. The games are designed specifically for teens and young adults who are at risk of adverse cancer outcomes due to poor treatment adherence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hopelab.org/our-research/re-mission-outcomes-study|title= HopeLab website, Our Research: Re-Mission Outcomes Study}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research on ''Re-Mission 2'' shows that the new games are as effective as the original ''Re-Mission'' game in increasing players’ self-efficacy, boosting positive emotions and shifting attitudes about chemotherapy.
''Re-Mission 2'' games are free to play online at [http://www.re-mission2.org/ re-mission2.org], and ''Re-Mission 2: Nanobot’s Revenge'' is available for download as a [https://itunes.apple.com/tw/app/re-mission-2-nanobots-revenge/id663425132?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo=4 mobile app for iOS] and [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.rm2.nbr&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsImFpci5jb20ucm0yLm5ic Android] devices. The browser-based games and mobile app offer a variety of game play styles for young cancer patients who spend time online and on mobile devices.

==Research==
HopeLab conducted an international, multicenter randomized controlled trial to gauge the efficacy of Re-Mission as it relates to [[Compliance (medicine)|compliance]] with prescribed [[chemotherapy]] and [[antibiotic]] treatments, cancer-related knowledge, and [[self-efficacy]]. The study enrolled 375 cancer patients aged 13–29 at 34 medical centers in the United States, Canada and Australia. Subjects received either computers pre-loaded with a popular commercial video game (the [[control group]]) or computers preloaded with the same control game plus Re-Mission. Study results indicated that playing Re-Mission led to more consistent treatment adherence, faster rate of increase in cancer knowledge, and faster rate of increase in self-efficacy in young cancer patients. These findings were published in August 2008 in the [[peer-reviewed]] medical journal ''[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]]''. Notably, to ascertain treatment compliance, researches used objective [[blood tests]] to measure levels of prescribed chemotherapy in the bodies of study participants rather than subjective [[Self-report inventory|self-report]] questionnaires, and electronic pill-cap monitors were used to determine utilization of prescribed antibiotics. Researchers concluded that a carefully designed video game can have a positive impact on health behavior in young people with chronic illness and that video-game–based interventions may constitute a component of a broader integrative approach to healthcare that synergistically combines rationally targeted biological and behavioral interventions to aid patients in the prevention, detection, treatment, and recovery from disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/122/2/e305|title=A Video Game Improves Behavioral Outcomes in Adolescents and Young Adults With Cancer: A Randomized Trial}}&lt;/ref&gt; HopeLab conducted additional research to understand the [[mechanisms of action]] that make ''Re-Mission'' effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hopelab.org/our-research/re-mission-attitudes-study-in-the-brain|title=HopeLab website, Our Research: Re-Mission™ Attitudes Study in the Brain}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Results of an [[fMRI]] study of ''Re-Mission'' showing the impact of the game on neurological processes were presented in August 2008 at the 10th International Congress of the Society of Behavioral Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isbm.info/congress/congress.html|title=International Society of Behavioral Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research informed HopeLab's development of ''Re-Mission 2''.

==Early life and education==
Geddes was born Robert Leon Goldberg on December 7, 1923 in [[Philadelphia]], the only child of Louis J. Geddes (born Goldberg) and Kate Geddes (born Malmed), both of Ukrainian-Jewish families settled in [[Woodbine, New Jersey]] by [[Maurice de Hirsch]]. He grew up and attended elementary school in [[Ventnor City, New Jersey]];&lt;ref&gt;Cook, Eugenia. [https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/174487446/ "With an eye on the human element, an architect gives substance to ideas"], ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', May 6, 1984. Accessed August 8, 2018. "Born in Philadelphia in 1923, he grew up in Ventnor."&lt;/ref&gt; John Burroughs Middle School in the [[Hancock Park, Los Angeles]] neighborhood of Los Angeles; and graduated from [[Atlantic City High School]] in 1941.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} He started university studies at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], transferring to [[Yale University]] in the fall of 1942 due to concerns over transcontinental travel after the start of World War II. His university studies were interrupted by three years in the [[United States Army Air Forces]] from 1942 to 1945.  He left Yale in 1947 for the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]], where he earned an M. Arch. in 1950.

==Professional career==
'''Architect'''

In 1953, he co-founded a collaborative practice, Geddes Brecher Qualls Cunningham: Architects (also known as GBQC Architects), in Philadelphia, later adding an office in Princeton. Prior to founding GBQC, he worked briefly for Hugh Stubbins, Jr. in Cambridge, Massachusetts. GBQC won national and international competitions and awards, starting with being runner-up in the Sydney Opera House design competition (1955). He was GBQC design partner or co-partner for the Pender Labs at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania; the Police Headquarters of the City of Philadelphia; Richard Stockton College in New Jersey; Hill Hall at Rutgers University-Newark; the College of Liberal Arts of Southern Illinois University; the Architects Housing in Trenton, New Jersey; Princeton Community Housing’s Griggs Farm neighborhood; and probably best known, the Dining Hall and Birch Garden quad at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. He was elected a Fellow of the National Academy of Design, and GBQC was awarded the highest professional honor of the American Institute for Architects, the Architecture Firm Award (1979), for “design quality, respect for the environment, and social concern.”

'''Urbanist'''

He was the urban design consultant for the Center City Plan of Philadelphia (1988), and for the Third Regional Plan of New York for the Regional Plan Association (1996). GBQC won first prize in the international design competition for Vienna-South urban extension (1972), and the GBQC master plan for Liberty State Park was exhibited in the Museum of Modern Art (1979). He worked with the City University of New York’s Newman Institute on alternatives for the Hudson Yards in midtown Manhattan. He co-founded the civic association, Princeton Future, which created the concept design for the new plaza, housing and parking in downtown Princeton, New Jersey. For the United Nations Center for Human Settlements, he directed the “UNCHS Conference on Cities in North America”, produced its report “Cities in Our Future”, published by Island Press, and wrote for the journal American Prospect, “Metropolis Unbound: The Sprawling American City and the Search for Alternatives.”

'''Educator'''

After studying at the Harvard Graduate School of Design in the post-war Walter Gropius and Joseph Hudnut era, he taught architecture and civic design at the University of Pennsylvania School of Design (formerly University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Fine Arts) from 1951 to 1965.

He moved to Princeton University in 1965 to become the first Dean of the School of Architecture, and is now William Kennan Professor Emeritus. Under his leadership over 17 years, the School of Architecture emerged as a major center for the exchange of architectural ideas, while retaining its small size and close connections with the rest of the university.

In 1990, he was appointed the Henry Luce Professor of Architecture, Urbanism, and History at New York University, and was elected a Fellow of the New York Institute for the Humanities. 
He pioneered in connecting architecture with the humanities and social sciences, and with public affairs and urban design, and is best known for his undergraduate course at Princeton and NYU, Architecture 101, “Buildings, Landscapes, and Cities.” He was co-author of the Princeton Report on Architectural Education for the American Institute of Architects (1967).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12107">{{short description|A memorization technique based on repetition}}
'''Rote learning''' is a [[memorization]] technique based on [[repetition (rhetorical device)|repetition]]. The idea is that one will be able to quickly [[recollection|recall]] the meaning of the material the more one repeats it. Some of the alternatives to rote learning include [[meaningful learning]], [[associative learning]], and [[active learning]].

== Versus critical thinking ==
Rote methods are routinely used when fast [[memorization]] is required, such as learning one's lines in a play or memorizing a [[telephone number]].

Rote learning is widely used in the mastery of foundational knowledge. Examples of school topics where rote learning is frequently used include [[phonics]] in [[Reading (process)|reading]], the [[periodic table]] in chemistry, [[multiplication tables]] in [[mathematics]], [[anatomy]] in [[medicine]], cases or [[statute]]s in law, basic [[formulae]] in any [[science]], etc. By definition, rote learning eschews [[Comprehension (logic)|comprehension]], so by itself it is an ineffective tool in mastering any complex subject at an advanced level. For instance, one illustration of rote learning can be observed in preparing quickly for exams, a technique which may be colloquially referred to as "[[Cramming (education)|cramming]]".

Rote learning is sometimes disparaged with the derogative terms ''[[talking parrot|parrot]] fashion'', ''[[Regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitation]]'', ''cramming'', or ''mugging'' because one who engages in rote learning may give the wrong impression of having understood what they have written or said. It is strongly discouraged by many new curriculum standards. For example, science and mathematics standards in the United States specifically emphasize the importance of deep understanding over the mere recall of facts, which is seen to be less important. The [[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics]] stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;More than ever, mathematics must include the mastery of concepts instead of mere memorization and the following of procedures. More than ever, school mathematics must include an understanding of how to use technology to arrive meaningfully at solutions to problems instead of endless attention to increasingly outdated computational tedium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wgquirk.com/NCTM2000.html#advice Understanding the Revised NCTM Standards: Arithmetic is Still Missing!]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;However, advocates of [[traditional education]] have criticized the new American standards as slighting learning basic facts and [[elementary arithmetic]], and replacing content with process-based skills. In math and science, rote methods are often used, for example to memorize formulas. There is greater understanding if students commit a formula to memory through [[exercise (mathematics)|exercise]]s that use the formula rather than through rote repetition of the formula. Newer standards often recommend that students derive formulas themselves to achieve the best understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=National Council of Teachers of Mathematics|title=Principles and Standards for School Mathematics|url=http://www.nctm.org/standards/content.aspx?id=16909|accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nothing is faster than rote learning if a formula must be learned quickly for an imminent test and rote methods can be helpful for committing an understood fact to memory. However, students who learn with understanding are able to transfer their knowledge to tasks requiring problem-solving with greater success than those who learn only by rote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hilgard|first=Ernest R.|author2=Irvine |author3=Whipple |title=Rote memorization, understanding, and transfer: an extension of Katona's card-trick experiments|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|date=October 1953|volume=46|issue=4|pages=288–292|doi=10.1037/h0062072}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other side, those who disagree with the [[Inquiry-based learning|inquiry-based philosophy]] maintain that students must first develop computational skills before they can understand concepts of mathematics. These people would argue that time is better spent practicing skills rather than in investigations inventing alternatives, or justifying more than one correct answer or method. In this view, [[Estimation|estimating]] answers is insufficient and, in fact, is considered to be dependent on strong foundational skills. Learning abstract concepts of mathematics is perceived to depend on a solid base of knowledge of the tools of the subject. Thus, these people believe that rote learning is an important part of the learning process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/mathpanel/pre-report.pdf ''Preliminary Report, National Mathematics Advisory Panel, January, 2007'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eugène Ionesco]] commented upon rote learning in his play [[La Leçon|"The Lesson"]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugène Ionesco|Ionesco, Eugène]]. ''The Bald Soprano &amp; Other Plays''. New York: Grove Press, 1958.{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the system is widely practiced in schools in [[Brazil]], [[People's Republic of China|China]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[Japan]], [[Romania]], [[Italy]], [[South Korea]], [[Turkey]], [[Malta]], and [[Greece]], it has been criticised by numerous academics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book   | last = Feynman  | first = Richard |author2=Leighton, Ralph  | title = Surely you're joking, Mr. Feynman! | publisher = W.

== In computer science ==
Rote learning is also used to describe a simple learning pattern used in [[machine learning]], although it does not involve repetition, unlike the usual meaning of rote learning. The machine is programmed to keep a history of calculations and compare new input against its history of inputs and outputs, retrieving the stored output if present. This pattern requires that the machine can be modeled as a [[pure function]] — always producing same output for same input — and can be formally described as follows:

:f(&lt;math&gt;\ x_1 , x_2 , . . ., x_n&lt;/math&gt;) → (&lt;math&gt;\ y_1 , y_2 , . . ., y_p&lt;/math&gt;)  → store ((&lt;math&gt;\ x_1 , x_2 , . . ., x_n&lt;/math&gt;),(&lt;math&gt;\ y_1 , y_2, . . . , y_p&lt;/math&gt;))&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Ming Xue; Changjun Zhu|title=A Study and Application on Machine Learning of Artificial Intelligence|conference=Artificial Intelligence, 2009.

Rote learning was used by [[Arthur Samuel|Samuel]]'s Checkers on an [[IBM 701]], a milestone in the use of [[artificial intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/Dave/AI2/node133.html|title=Rote Learning|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reasons for rote learning ==
{{Original research|date=May 2008}}
{{POV-section|date=May 2008}}
{{Tone|date=May 2008}}
Though rote learning is usually not necessary, there are many reasons why people resort to it. Bad teachers is one of the key reasons. Some teachers do not know the subject themselves and hence are unable to explain the essence to their students. This is a major problem that plagues higher education, especially in India where the teachers at colleges are usually poorly trained. Many teachers also criticize innovative methods of problem solving thus discouraging the student, who eventually resorts to rote learning to please the teacher.

Some teachers are forced to ask their students to memorize because the board, which conducts the final examination, expects a particular answer. If this answer is not given then the student may lose marks. Another factor that makes many teachers encourage learning by the rote is that these external examinations may be corrected by people who themselves have little knowledge about the subject and may penalise the student for not writing the exact answer as is mentioned in the answer key. Again this problem is very prevalent in countries like India where the number of students writing the examination is very high, making it virtually impossible to standardise the correction process.

Many times, especially in countries where education standards cannot be enforced easily, the question papers are set in a way that encourages learning by rote. The students who try to understand the subject are considered to be wasting time because the paper can be cracked on the basis of rote knowledge only. This encourages otherwise diligent and intelligent students to resort to rote learning, even though they may be capable of understanding the subject.

In addition, rote learning is also exercised by many Muslims to learn the Koran by heart in Arabic. Since the language is foreign to many Muslims who learn the holy book, often the focus is on memorising rather than understanding - especially since many learners are of a very young age.

A second explanation is that rote is the teaching, the incorporation of material into one's consciousness by repetition, by patterning, as it were. Rote is the teaching of abstract concepts by reference in a context rather than explanation, and the teaching of concrete information by practice.

Cultures which practice rote usually also have practices of harsh consequences to unsuccessful learning, and by proxy, such harshness has garnered rote a bad reputation.

Rote learning is active teaching and active learning (versus passive computer based/education-aid based teaching and learning, which has now been shown to pejorate education).  Both the teacher and the student must participate in the drill, whether by writing or by speaking, and so the brain power required to meet the processing on a multitude of levels makes for a better educated teacher and pupil.--&gt;

'''Shenzhen–Hong Kong cross-boundary students''' (Chinese: 深港跨境學童) are people who are born and study in Hong Kong but live in mainland China. In a daily [[student migration]], every school day they arrive in and exit from Hong Kong primarily through 5 land boundary control points: Lo Wu, Sha Tau Kok, Lok Ma Chau, Man Kam To, and Shenzhen Bay. They mainly study in Yuen Long, Tuen Mun, Tai Po while the majority in the North district.

Since the [[Director of Immigration v. Chong Fung Yuen|2001 Chong Fung Yuen “Right of abode” case]], babies born in Hong Kong to mainland women are entitled the right of abode in Hong Kong. Favoured with the 2003 [[Individual Visit Scheme]], a large number of mainland pregnant women came to Hong Kong to give birth for their children's right of residence. Accordingly, the number of cross-boundary students, who are also doubly non-permanent resident children, surged since 2006.

Meanwhile, with the low-birth rate in Hong Kong, a portion of primary and secondary schools were
forced to close down, especially those in rural areas. To maintain their operation, some schools
welcome these children to study under them to increase the admission rate. This results in a further elevation
of the number of cross-boundary students.

In recent years, mainland schools no longer accept applications of children who do not have [[Hukou system|Hukou]] in
mainland with only a Hong Kong citizenship. Children born in Hong Kong and live in mainland can either
study in mainland international schools or schools located in Hong Kong. Despite the new policy rejecting
“Double-not” pregnant women, the number of cross-boundary students will certainly continue rising until

==Impact==
According to the “Report on Primary One Admission 2012”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=REPORT ON PRIMARY ONE ADMISSION 2012|url=http://www.edb.gov.hk/attachment/en/edu-system/primary-secondary/spa-systems/primary-1-admission/12rept_en.pdf|publisher=SCHOOL PLACES ALLOCATION SECTION EDUCATION BUREAU|accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  around 20% of the Northern District students were sent to the 11th or onward primary school places.&lt;ref name="ä¸Šæ°´å°�ä¸€æ ¡ç¶²æ´¾ä½�å…¨æ¸¯æœ€å·® å…©æˆ�å¸ç”Ÿç�²ç¬¬11å¿—é¡˜ä»¥ä¸‹ - æœ¬æ¸¯æ–°è�ž - MSN æ–°è�ž" &gt;{{cite news|title=上水小一校網派位全港最差 兩成學生獲第11志願以下|url=http://news.hk.msn.com/local/%e4%b8%8a%e6%b0%b4%e5%b0%8f%e4%b8%80%e6%a0%a1%e7%b6%b2%e6%b4%be%e4%bd%8d%e5%85%a8%e6%b8%af%e6%9c%80%e5%b7%ae-%e5%85%a9%e6%88%90%e5%ad%b8%e7%94%9f%e7%8d%b2%e7%ac%ac11%e5%bf%97%e9%a1%98%e4%bb%a5%e4%b8%8b-1|accessdate=6 April 2013|newspaper=ming pao|date=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growth of the cross-border students who are "neither-is" and "either-is" children. Thus, there are insufficient places for primary one in Northern district.

===Impact on Schools===
Hong Kong government suggested small group education to provide better education standards a few years ago. The growth of CBS in Northern District would lead to the increase of classes and the class size of primary one, from 27 to around 39-42 in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=北區小一學額加班加派|url=http://hk.news.yahoo.com/%E5%8C%97%E5%8D%80%E5%B0%8F-%E5%AD%B8%E9%A1%8D%E5%8A%A0%E7%8F%AD%E5%8A%A0%E6%B4%BE-220227337.html|accessdate=6 April 2013|newspaper=Sing Tao|date=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heavier workloads and more pressure are thus given to the teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=教師壓力增|url=http://hk.news.yahoo.com/%E6%95%99%E5%B8%AB%E5%A3%93%E5%8A%9B%E5%A2%9E-220237226.html|accessdate=6 April 2013|newspaper=Sing Tao|date=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between "neither-is" or "either-is" children and local children in culture and abilities, placed stress on teachers as it was, and is, impossible for the schools to separate those "neither-is" and "either-is" students apart from locals. More resources are also needed for the schools to provide support to students who have special needs. This is because there is no special education in China, and parents in mainland prefer main line schools in Hong Kong rather than special schools for their children with special needs. Resulting in added pressure on the teachers in the Northern district to provide extra care for those children.

===Impact on Local Parents===
Local children are unable to secure places in [[North District, Hong Kong|Northern district]] primary schools. It is inconvenient for them to study in other districts. The increase of class size may affect the quality of education. The unnecessary transportation of CBS worsened the problems of transportation system in the Northern District.&lt;ref name="ä¸Šæ°´å°�ä¸€æ ¡ç¶²æ´¾ä½�å…¨æ¸¯æœ€å·® å…©æˆ�å¸ç”Ÿç�²ç¬¬11å¿—é¡˜ä»¥ä¸‹ - æœ¬æ¸¯æ–°è�ž - MSN æ–°è�ž" /&gt;

===Impact on Shenzhen Parents===
In 2012, the Shenzhen government did not allow those "neither-is" or "either-is" children who are classified as Hong Kong residents to study in Shenzhen government schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=梁家裕|title=跨境學童問題是誰的錯？政府還能裝睡嗎？|url=http://www.inmediahk.net/node/1015828|accessdate=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Shenzhen parents let their children to study in Hong Kong where there is also better education quality. They allow their children to live in Hong Kong due to the long travel time to Hong Kong. This can ultimately lead to unhealthy growth both mentally and physically of CBS due to the separation of family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=私宅辦雙非童寄宿 同時劏房租遊客 託管安全成疑|url=http://hk.news.yahoo.com/%E7%A7%81%E5%AE%85%E8%BE%A6%E9%9B%99%E9%9D%9E%E7%AB%A5%E5%AF%84%E5%AE%BF-%E5%90%8C%E6%99%82%E5%8A%8F%E6%88%BF%E7%A7%9F%E9%81%8A%E5%AE%A2-%E8%A8%97%E7%AE%A1%E5%AE%89%E5%85%A8%E6%88%90%E7%96%91-211428440.html|accessdate=6 April 2013|newspaper=Ming Pao|date=28 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on Cross-boundary Students===

====Safety Issues====
Cross-boundary students (CBS) have to attend school and return home every day, usually without the company of their parents. Ways for CBS to come to Hong Kong include Cross Boundary School Coaches (CBSC), nanny buses and public transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cross-Boundary School Coaches|url=http://www.edb.gov.hk/en/student-parents/events-services/services/cbsc.html|publisher=Education Bureau|accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the pick-up/drop-off points at the current boundary control points are limited,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LCQ10: Cross-boundary students|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201106/15/P201106150116.htm|publisher=News.gov.hk|accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; students may need to get on or off the coaches and nanny buses in crowded areas and are exposed to dangers of traffic accidents and kidnapping.

Growing concerns are also raised regarding the insufficient issues of [[Closed Road Permits]] necessary for CBCS and [[Frontier Closed Area#Closed Area Permit|Closed Area Permits]] for students who take the nanny bus service. Though the government figure reveals a rise of issues per year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Annex 3: The number of CAPs issued in the past three school years|url=http://gia.info.gov.hk/general/201106/15/P201106150120_0120_80247.pdf|accessdate=7 April 2013|newspaper=News.gov.hk}}&lt;/ref&gt; parents and schools are demanding for more quotas due to the increasing rates of cross-boundary students.

====Ethnic Identity Crisis====

The difference between Hong Kong and Mainland China’s culture has led to difficulties for CBS to adjust their identity. With a lack of understanding in Hong Kong’s culture, systems and values, failure to naturalize and adapt in Hong Kong is common among CBS.

Language differences result in communication difficulty since many of the CBS are more fluent in Mandarin than Cantonese. Further enhancing the difficulty of connecting with local students. Little participation of after-school extra–curriculum activities due to their shuffling across boundaries, are also common reasons for the lack of development socially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=跨境學童文化差異大|url=http://www.hkdailynews.com.hk/news.php?id=227795|accessdate=7 April 2013|newspaper=Hong Kong Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed solutions==

===Pilot scheme and travel support===
The government starts the pilot scheme, allocates [[Frontier Closed Area#Closed Area Permit|Closed Area Permits]] (CAP) for cross-boundary students in higher priority,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LCQ10: Cross-boundary students|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201106/15/P201106150116.htm|publisher=News.gov.hk|accessdate=15 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; issues special quotas for their coaches and provides travel subsidy for students.

===Increase school place (return system)===
On 23 March 2013, Undersecretary for [[Education Bureau|Education]] [[Kevin Yeung Yun-hung]] said that school places would be increased and students living in the [[North District, Hong Kong|Northern District]] can study through the Return System if they are allocated to study in [[Tai Po District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=400 students will study in cross-boundary school in Tai Po and the Education Bureau carries out Return System|url=http://happypama.mingpao.com/cfm/study3.cfm?File=20130323/prepe/gmb2.txt|publisher=Ming Pao|accessdate=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Du Ki|title=Eddie Ng Hak-kim said, either original district or cross-boundary|url=http://www.singpao.com/xw/gat/201302/t20130206_417995.html|publisher=Sing Pao Daily News|accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New school net===
On the 6th of February 2013, [[Secretary for Education (Hong Kong)|Secretary for Education]] [[Eddie Ng (politician)|Eddie Ng Hak-kim]] declared that a new school net should be set up for the cross-boundary students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Net move mooted in primary pupils chaos|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=4&amp;art_id=130855&amp;sid=38907189&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20130206&amp;fc=4|publisher=The Standard|accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ko-yuk, Fung Zhen-yin|title=Proposing a new school net for the cross-boundary students|url=http://paper.wenweipo.com/2013/02/06/ED1302060001.htm|publisher=Wen Wei Po|accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=30percents of students in Sheng Shui were not allocated to their top ten preferences of schools|url=http://www.singtao.com/yesterday/edu/0328go01.html|publisher=The Sing Tao Daily|accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pay for school places in Shen Zhen===
On 6 February 2013, honorary chairman of [[Liberal Party (Hong Kong)|Liberal Party]] [[James Tien (politician)|James Tien Pei-chun]] suggested the [[Education Bureau]] to pay for the school places in Shenzhen and provide free education for the cross-boundary students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Proposing to allocate cross-boundary students to remaining schools places in different districts|url=http://www.singtao.com/yesterday/loc/0206ao02.html|publisher=The Sing Tao Daily|accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fung Zhen-yin|title=Worrying about the label effect of schools|url=http://paper.wenweipo.com/2013/02/06/ED1302060004.htm|publisher=Wen Wei Po|accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Shinichi Suzuki'''|鈴木 鎮一|Suzuki Shin'ichi|extra=17 October 1898 – 26 January 1998}} was a [[Japan]]ese musician, philosopher, and educator and the inventor of the international [[Suzuki method]] of [[music education]] and developed a philosophy for educating people of all ages and abilities. Considered an influential [[pedagogue]] in music education of children, he often spoke of the ability of all children to learn things well, especially in the right environment, and of developing the heart and building the character of music students through their music education. Before his time, it was rare for children to be formally taught classical instruments from an early age and even more rare for children to be accepted by a music teacher without an audition or entrance examination. Not only did he endeavor to teach children the violin from early childhood and then infancy, his school in Matsumoto did not screen applicants for their ability upon entrance.&lt;ref name="nurtured"&gt;{{cite book|last=Suzuki|first=Shinichi &amp; Waltraud|title=Nurtured by Love|date=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suzuki was also responsible for the early training of some of the earliest Japanese violinists to be successfully appointed to prominent western classical music organizations. During his lifetime, he received several honorary doctorates in music including from the [[New England Conservatory of Music]] (1956), and the [[Oberlin College]] Conservatory of Music, was proclaimed a [[Living National Treasure of Japan]], and was nominated for the Nobel Peace prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wood|first=Enid|title=Shinichi Suzuki (1898–1998): A Short Biography|url=http://internationalsuzuki.org/shinichisuzuki.htm|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Born in [[Nagoya]], Japan in 1898, as one of twelve children, Shinichi spent his childhood working at his father's violin factory (current Suzuki Violin Co., Ltd.), putting up [[Sound post|violin soundposts]]. A family friend encouraged Shinichi to study [[Western culture]], but his father felt that it was beneath Suzuki to be a performer. He began to teach himself how to play the violin in 1916, however, after being inspired by a recording of [[Mischa Elman]]. Without access to professional instruction, he listened to recordings and tried to imitate what he heard.&lt;ref name=SSvolgensKW&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.germansuzuki.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/suzuki_biographie.pdf|pages=8–29|author1=Kerstin Wartberg (author)|author2=Ursula Mueller-Gaehler (translation into English)| publisher=Deutsches Suzuki Institut |date=2009| title=Suzuki's family background - Life between tradition and progress| website=Shinichi Suzuki: Pioneer of Music Education| accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 26, the Marquis Tokugawa, a friend of Suzuki, persuaded his father to allow him to study in Germany, where he studied under [[Karl Klingler]]. In Germany, he claimed to have spent time under the guardianship of [[Albert Einstein]].&lt;ref&gt;「愛に生きる：才能は生まれつきではない」 ("AI NI I KI RU : SAI NOU WHA U MA RE TSU KI DE WHA NA I") by 鈴木鎮一 (SUZU KI SHIN ICHI), Published in 1966, {{ISBN|4-06-115486-9}} (2007 Printing), pp.150–166&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Nurtured by Love: The Classic Approach to Talent Education" by Shinichi Suzuki (The 1983 English translation of the above-mentioned book, 「愛に生きる：才能は生まれつきではない」, translated from Japanese to English by Mrs Waltraud Suzuki, with language consultants Mrs Masako Kobayashi and Ms D. Guyver Britton), 2nd Edition ({{ISBN|0-87487-584-6}}), pp.75–78&lt;/ref&gt; He also met and married his wife, Waltraud Prange (1905–2000). Upon his return to Japan, he formed a [[string quartet]] with his brothers and began teaching at the Imperial School of Music and at the Kunitachi Music School in Tokyo and started to take interest in developing the music education of young students in violin. During [[World War II]], his father's violin factory was converted into a factory to construct seaplane floats. Consequently, it was bombed by American war planes and one of his brothers died as a result. During this time, he and his wife finally evacuated to separate locations when conditions became too unsafe for her as an ex-German citizen, and the factory was struggling to operate due to lack of wood supply.&lt;ref name="nurtured" /&gt; Suzuki left with other family members for a rural mountainous region to secure wood from a [[Geta (footwear)|geta]] factory and his wife had to move to a "German village" where other Germans and ex-Germans were sequestered. Once the war was over, he was invited to teach at a new music school being formed, and agreed to the position with the condition he would be allowed to develop teaching music to children from infancy and early childhood. He adopted into his family and continued the music education of one of his pre-wartime students, [[Koji Toyoda|Koji]], once he learned he was a wartime orphan. He and his wife were eventually reunited and moved to Matsumoto where he continued to teach.

He was a National Patron of [[Delta Omicron]], an international professional music fraternity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://delta-omicron.org/index00.html Delta Omicron] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127130549/http://delta-omicron.org/index00.html |date=27 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shinichi Suzuki died at his home in [[Matsumoto, Nagano|Matsumoto]], Japan on 26 January 1998, aged 99.

== Contributions to pedagogy ==
Shinichi Suzuki's experiences as an adult beginner and the [[Asian philosophy|philosophies]] that he held during his life were recapitulated in the lessons he developed to teach his students. Schools of early childhood education have combined his philosophies and approaches with pedagogues such as [[Carl Orff|Orff]], [[Kodály]], [[Maria Montessori|Montessori]], [[Dalcroze]], and [[Glenn Doman|Doman]].

"First, to set the record straight, this is not a 'teaching method.' You cannot buy ten volumes of Suzuki books and become a 'Suzuki Teacher.'  Dr. Suzuki has developed a philosophy which, when understood to the fullest, can be a philosophy for living. He is not trying to create the world of violinists. His major aim is to open a world of beauty to young children everywhere that they might have greater enjoyment in their lives through the God-given sounds of music" (Hermann, 1971). {{Verify source|date=July 2011}}

Suzuki developed his ideas through a strong belief in the ideas of "Talent Education", a philosophy of instruction that is based on the premise that talent, musical or otherwise, is something that can be developed in any child. At the 1958 National Festival, Suzuki said, {{quote|"Though still in an experimental stage, Talent Education has realized that all children in the world show their splendid capacities by speaking and understanding their [[mother language]], thus displaying the original power of the human mind. Is it not probable that this mother language method holds the key to [[Developmental psychology|human development]]? Talent Education has applied this method to the teaching of music: children, taken without previous aptitude or [[intelligence test]] of any kind, have almost without exception made great progress. This is not to say that everyone can reach the same level of achievement. However, each individual can certainly achieve the equivalent of his language proficiently in other fields"|Shinichi Suzuki|(Kendall,1966)}} Suzuki also collaborated with other thinkers of his time, like [[Glenn Doman]], founder of [[The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential]], an organization that studies [[neurological]] development in young children. Suzuki and Doman agreed on the premise that all young children had great potential, and Suzuki interviewed Doman for his book ''Where Love is Deep''.&lt;ref&gt;D'Ercole, Pat. Suki Association of the Americas. http://suzukiassociation.org/news/3244/&lt;/ref&gt;

Suzuki employed the following ideas of Talent Education in his music [[pedagogy]] schools:
#The human being is a product of his [[Nature versus nurture|environment]].
#The earlier, the better – with not only music, but all learning.
#Repetition of experiences is important for learning.
#Teachers and parents (adult human environment) must be at a high level and continue to grow to provide a better learning situation for the child.
#The system or method must involve illustrations for the child based on the teacher's understanding of when, what, and how (Kendall, 1966).

The [[epistemological]] learning aspect, or, as Suzuki called it, the "mother tongue" philosophy, is that in which children learn through their own observation of their environment, especially in the learning of their [[first language]]. The worldwide Suzuki movement continues to use the theories that Suzuki himself put forward in the mid-1940s and has been continuously developed to this day, stemming from his encouragement of others to continue to develop and research the education of children throughout his lifetime.

== Suzuki philosophy ==
Suzuki Talent Education or the [[Suzuki Method]] combines a music teaching method with a philosophy that embraces the total development of the child. Suzuki's guiding principle was "character first, ability second", and that any child can learn.

== Controversy ==

In 2014, 16 years after Suzuki's death, U.S. violin teacher Mark O'Connor, who sells a competing method, wrote a blog post claiming that Suzuki lied about his training in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;"Japanese violin teacher whose method has been used by millions LIED about his training, LIED about learning with Einstein and is the 'biggest fraud in musical history', say experts", Dailymail, http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2808328/Japanese-violin-teacher-method-used-millions-LIED-training-LIED-learning-Einstein-biggest-fraud-musical-history-say-experts.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The allegations were quickly refuted by Lois Shepheard, a teacher of the Suzuki method who learned Japanese in Japan and studied with Suzuki,&lt;ref&gt;"Response to Mark O’Connor’s ‘Say It Ain’t So, Shin’ichi Suzuki’" https://suzukiassociation.org/discuss/19995/&lt;/ref&gt;  by the International Suzuki Association (ISA),&lt;ref&gt;"Inaccurate and false statements by American fiddler Mark 
O’Connor about Shinichi Suzuki" http://internationalsuzuki.org/docs/OConnor-ISA-Website-Revised-10-31-14.pdf

'''Summative assessment''' (or '''summative evaluation''') refers to the [[Educational assessment|assessment]] of participants where the focus is on the outcome of a program. This contrasts with [[formative assessment]], which summarizes the participants' development at a particular time. Summative assessment is widely taught in [[educational]] programs in the United States.{{Citation needed|reason=what programs, and why|date=April 2014}} Scriven claims that while all assessment techniques can be summative, only some are formative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Perspectives of curriculum evaluation|date=1967|publisher=Rand McNally|location=Chicago, IL|pages=39–83|author=R. W. Tyler, R. M. Gagne, &amp; M. Scriven (Eds.)|chapter=The methodology of evaluation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of summative assessment is to evaluate student learning at the end of an instructional unit by comparing it against a standard or benchmark. Note, 'the end' does not necessarily mean the end of an entire course or module of study. Summative assessments may be distributed throughout a course, after a particular unit (or collection of topics) have been taught, and there are advantages to doing so. In many disciplines in the UK Higher Education sector, there has been a move away from 100% end of course assessments, to a model where summative assessments are distributed across a course, which helps to scaffold students' learning. Summative assessment usually involves students receiving a grade that indicates their level of performance, be it a percentage, pass/fail, or some other form of scale grade. Summative assessments are weighted more than formative assessments.
For example-test after 6 months in schools, Semester exams in B. Ed after each 6 months.

==Instructional design==

Summative assessment is used as an evaluation technique in instructional design. It can provide information on an [[Educational intervention|intervention's]] efficacy (its ability to do what it was designed to do). Summative evaluation judges the worth, or value, of an intervention at its conclusion.

==Educator performance==

Summative assessment can be used to refer to assessment of educational faculty by their respective supervisor, with the object of measuring all teachers on the same criteria to determine the level of their performance. In this context summative assessment is meant to meet the school or district's needs for teacher accountability. The evaluation usually takes the shape of a form, and consists of check lists and occasionally narratives. Areas evaluated include [[classroom climate]], instruction, professionalism, and planning and preparation.&lt;ref&gt;Glickman, C.D., Gordon, S.P., &amp; Ross-Gordon, J.M. (2009).''Supervision and instructional leadership: a developmental approach'' Allyn and Bacon, Boston, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
Methods of summative assessment aim to summarize overall learning at the completion of the course or unit.
* Questionnaires
* Surveys
* Interviews
* Observations
* Testing
* Projects (a culminating project that synthesizes knowledge)

'''Tactile''' is a real-time text-to-[[braille]] translation device currently under development at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/devinthorpe/2016/12/20/these-6-women-undergrads-at-mit-invented-a-game-changer-for-the-blind/ |title=These 6 Women Undergrads At MIT Invented A Game Changer For The Blind |last=Thorpe |first=Devin |date=20 December 2016 |website=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==People==
The six-person development team comprises Chandani Doshi, Grace Li, Jialin Shi, Bonnie Wang, Charlene Xia, and Tania Yu, all undergraduate students at MIT at the time of Tactile's conception.&lt;ref name=microsoft&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.microsoft.com/stories/people/team-tactile.html |title=How six scrappy young inventors built a breakthrough text-to-Braille translator device |last=Ith |first=Tracy |website=Microsoft}}&lt;/ref&gt; A joint collaboration in [[materials science]], [[Mechanical engineering|mechanical]] and [[electrical engineering]], and [[computer science]], Tactile received popular media attention&lt;ref name=upworthy&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.upworthy.com/they-had-15-hours-to-come-up-with-an-idea-thatd-improve-lives-they-did-it |title=They had 15 hours to come up with an idea that'd improve lives.

==Development==
Tactile provides [[Real-time computing|real-time]] translation of [[English language|English]] text, captured by integrated camera, into braille dynamically rendered on a [[Refreshable braille display|refreshable display]]. The end product is to display 36 braille characters at a time on a 5" x 2" interface{{#tag:ref|Current functioning prototypes are moderately larger; the intended size assumes the ongoing [[miniaturization]] of its component systems.|group=note}} with an intended retail price around US$100.&lt;ref name=microsoft/&gt; With existing braille display devices priced in the range of $1,500 to $2,500, Tactile has been characterized as a potential "quantum leap forward for the blind community."&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;

The Tactile team was awarded a $10,000 grant in the MIT IDEAS Global Challenge&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt; and was accepted into the Microsoft Patent Program, receiving funding and legal counsel from [[Microsoft]] to apply for patent protection in the United States. The application was filed on September 16, 2016 and presently has [[patent pending]] status.&lt;ref name=microsoft/&gt;
