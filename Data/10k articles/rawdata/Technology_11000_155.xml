'''ACS Mersin''' is the name of a glass factory in [[Mersin]], [[Turkey]]. ACS stands for ''Anadolu Cam Sanayii'' ("Anatolian Glass Industry")

The factory is at {{coord|36|51|50|N|34|06|43|E}} in Yenitaşkent neighborhood to the north of the Turkish state highway {{TUR-D|400}} which connects Mersin to [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]]. Its distance to Mersin is about {{convert|13|km}}.

The factory was put into operation in 1969. In 1975, it was acquired by Şişecam Group of Companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sisecam.com.tr/tr/hakkimizda/tarihce ACS history]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988 NNPB (narrow neck press and blow) technology was successfully used for the first time in Turkey at ACS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sisecam.com.tr/en/business-segments/glass-packaging Şişecam page]&lt;/ref&gt; Current annual glass production is 260 822 metric tons. The number of employees is 461. But after the planned instauration the annual production will rise to 366685 metric tons and the number of employees will increase to 483.&lt;ref&gt;[http://guneygazetesi.com/m/news.php?id=7891 Güney newspaper {{tr icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Certification Authority Browser Forum''', also known as '''CA/Browser Forum''', is a voluntary consortium of certification authorities, vendors of [[Internet browser]] software, operating systems, and other PKI-enabled applications that promulgates industry guidelines governing the issuance and management of [[X.509]] v.3 [[digital certificates]] that chain to a [[trust anchor]] embedded in such applications.  Its guidelines cover certificates used for the [[Transport Layer Security|SSL/TLS protocol]] and [[code signing]], as well as system and [[network security]] of certificate authorities.

{{as of|2014|10}}, the CA/Browser Forum includes over forty [[certificate authority]] members and the following six Internet browser software vendors: [[Microsoft]] ([[Microsoft Edge]] and [[Internet Explorer]]), [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] ([[Safari (web browser)|Safari]]), [[Mozilla]] ([[Mozilla Firefox|Firefox]]), [[Google]] ([[Google Chrome|Chrome]]), [[Opera browser|Opera]], and [[Qihoo|Qihoo 360]] ([[360 Secure Browser]]).&lt;ref name="members"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://cabforum.org/members/ | title=Members of the CA - Browser Forum - Over 30 CAs and All Major Browsers | publisher=CA/Browser Forum | accessdate=23 January 2015 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150124013021/https://cabforum.org/members/ | archivedate=2015-01-24 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CA/Browser Forum maintains “Guidelines For The Issuance And Management Of Extended Validation (EV) Certificates”.  The EV SSL standard improves security for Internet transactions and creates a more intuitive method of displaying secure sites to [[Internet users]]. In order for certificate authorities to issue EV SSL Certificates, they must be audited for compliance with the Forum's EV Guidelines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cabforum.org/EV_Certificate_Guidelines.pdf|title=CA/Browser Extended Validation Guidelines|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308072947/http://www.cabforum.org//EV_Certificate_Guidelines.pdf|archivedate=2009-03-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in accordance with either WebTrust or [[ETSI]] audit criteria.

The CA/Browser Forum adopted the "Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted Certificates" in 2011. These Guidelines, which are binding on members of the CA/Browser Forum, took effect July 1, 2012. These guidelines cover all CA-issued certificates.  Certificates are now classified as "DV" (Domain Validated), "OV" (Organization Validated), "IV" (Individual Validated), and "EV" (Extended Validation), and a method is defined within the specification to distinguish the types of certificates.&lt;ref name="cabaseline"&gt;{{cite web |

== History ==
In 2005, [[Melih Abdulhayoglu]] of the [[Comodo Group]] organized&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Security/How-Can-We-Improve-Code-Signing/|title=How Can We Improve Code Signing?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and arranged the first meeting of CA/Browser Forum. The first meeting was held in New York City. This was followed by a meeting in November 2005 in [[Kanata, Ontario|Kanata]], Ontario, and a meeting in December, 2005, in [[Scottsdale, Arizona|Scottsdale]], [[Arizona]] with the main objective to enable secure connections between users and websites.

In addition to CA/Browser Forum members, representatives of the [[Information Security]] Committee of the [[American Bar Association]] Section of Science &amp; Technology, Law and the [[Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants]] participated in developing the standards for issuing and managing Extended Validation SSL certificates.

Version 1.0 of the EV Guidelines was adopted on 7 June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GUIDELINES FOR THE ISSUANCE AND MANAGEMENT OF EXTENDED VALIDATION CERTIFICATES v1.0|url=https://cabforum.org/wp-content/uploads/EV_Certificate_Guidelines.pdf|publisher=The CA/Browser Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Version 1.1 was adopted by the CA/Browser Forum on 10 April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GUIDELINES FOR THE ISSUANCE AND MANAGEMENT OF EXTENDED VALIDATION CERTIFICATES v1.1|url=https://cabforum.org/wp-content/uploads/EV_Code_Signing_Guidelines_v1_1.pdf|publisher=The CA/Browser Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Version 1.2 was adopted by the CA/Browser Forum on 1 Oct 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidelines For The Issuance And Management Of Extended Validation Certificates |publisher=The CA/Browser Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a great step forward in establishing verified identity for websites considers [[MSDN]] in its blog post.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2007/06/12/extended-validation-guidelines-v1-released.aspx Extended Validation Guidelines v1 Released]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[Microsoft's]] vision is that the backbone of an [[Online identity|Internet identity]] system is composed of Extended Validation SSL Certificates intimately integrated with the users' browsing experience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/ie/ev/default.mspx Microsoft information on EV in IE7]&lt;/ref&gt;

The tougher certificates, coupled with browser developments,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/Browsers-to-get-sturdier-padlocks/2100-1029_3-5989633.html CNet News - Browsers to get sturdier padlocks]&lt;/ref&gt; could help fight [[phishing]], which threatens the multibillion-dollar online [[retail market]].

In November 2011, the CA/Browser Forum adopted version 1.0 of the "Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of {{sic|hide=y|Publicly|-}}Trusted Certificates."&lt;ref name="cabaseline"/&gt;

In February 2013 a new industry group, the [[Certificate Authority Security Council]] (CASC), was formed with a mission that includes promoting CA/Browser Forum standards. Membership requires adherence to CA/Browser Forum standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://casecurity.org/casc/|title=About the CA Security Council|date=27 January 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CASC's founding members consist of the seven largest certificate authorities:  [[Comodo Group|Comodo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.instantssl.com/ssl-faqs/types-of-ssl-certificate.html|title= SSL Certificate Types|accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://ssl.comodo.com/wildcard-ssl-certificates.php|title= SSL Certificate|accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Symantec]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/let-s-build-more-secure-future|title=Let’s Build a More Secure Future|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trend Micro]], [[DigiCert]], [[Entrust]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entrust.com/news/2013-02-14-Entrust-Joins-Worlds-Leading-CAs-to-Form-Certificate-Authority-Security-Council-Advance-Internet-Security-and-Trusted-SSL-Ecosystem|title=Entrust Joins World's Leading Certificate Authority|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GlobalSign]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepaypers.com/news/e-identity-security-online-fraud/globalsign-joins-the-certificate-authority-security-council-to-upgrade-internet-security/750211-26|title=GlobalSign joins the Certificate Authority Security Council to upgrade internet security|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[GoDaddy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inside.godaddy.com/announcing-certificate-authority-security-council/|title=Get more done with Microsoft Office 365 from GoDaddy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="darkreading.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darkreading.com/authentication/167901072/security/news/240148546/major-certificate-authorities-unite-in-the-name-of-ssl-security.html|title=Authentication Security News, Analysis, Discussion, &amp; Community|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130410174711/http://www.darkreading.com/authentication/167901072/security/news/240148546/major-certificate-authorities-unite-in-the-name-of-ssl-security.html|archivedate=2013-04-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="darkreading.com"/&gt;

[[File:Patent 5019838 Fig3.png|thumb|250px|A circular chart recorder]]

A '''chart recorder''' is an [[electromechanical]] device that records an electrical or mechanical input trend onto a piece of paper (the chart). Chart recorders may record several inputs using different color pens and may record onto strip charts or circular charts. Chart recorders may be entirely mechanical with clockwork mechanisms, electro-mechanical with an electrical clockwork mechanism for driving the chart (with mechanical or pressure inputs), or entirely electronic with no mechanical components at all (a virtual chart recorder). 

Chart recorders are built in three primary formats. Strip chart recorders have a long strip of paper that is ejected out of the recorder. Circular chart recorders have a rotating disc of paper that must be replaced more often, but are more compact and amenable to being enclosed behind glass. Roll chart recorders are similar to strip chart recorders except that the recorded data is stored on a round roll, and the unit is usually fully enclosed.

Chart recorders pre-dated electronic [[data logger]]s which have replaced them in many applications.

==Origins==

[[Charles Babbage]] incorporated a chart recorder into the [[dynamometer car]] that he built in 1838 or 1839.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink= Charles Babbage | title= Passages from the life of a philosopher | publisher= Longman, Green, Longman, Roberts and Green | chapter= XXV. Railways | publication-date= 1864 | pages= 328-334 | url= https://archive.org/stream/passagesfromlif00babbgoog#page/n334/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Here is how he described it:
"A roll of paper a thousand feet in length was slowly unwinding itself upon the long table ... About a dozen pens connected with a bridge crossing the middle of the table were each marking its own independent curve gradually or by jumps ..."  The paper advance was geared to the wheels of the railroad carriage, while pens recorded time, the drawbar pull of the locomotive, and numerous other variables.

Part of [[Samuel Morse]]'s telegraph system was an automatic recorder of the dots and dashes of the code, inscribed on a paper tape by a pen moved by an electromagnet, with a clockwork mechanism advancing the paper.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel F. B. Morse, Improvement in the Mode of Communicating Information by Signals by the Application of Electro-Magnetism, [http://www.google.com/patents?id=Xx5AAAAAEBAJ&amp;pg=PA7 U.S. Patent 1647], June 20, 1840; see page 4 column 2&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1848-1850 a system of such registers was used by [[John Locke (naturalist)|John Locke]] to improve the precision of astronomical observations of stars, providing timing precision much greater than previous methods. This method was adopted by astronomers in other countries as well. &lt;ref&gt;Richard Stachurski ''Longitude by Wire: Finding North America'' Univ of South Carolina Press, 2009 {{ISBN|1570038015}} pages 101-103 &lt;/ref&gt; [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin]]'s [[syphon recorder]] of 1858 was a sensitive instrument that provided a permanent record of telegraph signals through long underwater telegraph cables.  These recorders came to be referred to as [[pen register]]s, although this term later became part of law enforcement jargon referring to the use of such a register to record dialed telephone numbers.

A patent for a 'Pressure Indicator and Recorder' was issued to [[William Henry Bristol]], on September 18, 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Bristol, William H. |title=Pressure Indicator and Recorder, U.S. Patent 389,635 issued Sep 18, 1888 |url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=Y1dwAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=389635 |accessdate=2008-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bristol went on to form the Bristol Manufacturing Company in 1889. The Bristol Company was acquired by [[Emerson Electric Company]] in March 2006, and continues to manufacture a number of different electro-mechanical chart recorders, as well as other instrumentation, measurement, and control products.

The first chart recorder for [[environmental monitoring]] was designed by American inventor J.C. Stevens while working for [[Leupold &amp; Stevens]] in Portland, Oregon and was issued a patent for this design in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Stevens, John Cyprian |title=Water Stage Recorder, U.S. Patent 1,163,279 issued Dec 7, 1915 |url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=OqRUAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=1163279 |accessdate=2008-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chart recorders are still used in applications where instant visual feedback is required or where users do not have the need, opportunity or technical ability to download and view data on a computer or where no electrical power is available (such as in hazardous zones on an oil rig or in remote ecological studies). However, dataloggers' decreasing cost and power requirements allow them to increasingly replace chart recorders, even in situations where battery power is the only option.

==Chart drive==
[[File:Chart recorders of a control panel.JPG|thumb|Chart recorders of a control panel at a water purification plant record water flow rates at different stages of the process.]]

The paper chart is driven past the pen at a steady rate by a clockwork or electrical drive mechanism. One common method is to use a miniature [[synchronous motor]] which turns at a constant speed related to the [[utility frequency|power frequency]]; a gear-train is used to propel the paper. Industrial strip-chart recorders may have two-speed gear trains that allow a higher speed to be used for initial adjustments of a process or to follow process upsets. Medical and scientific recorders allow a wide range of accurately-controlled speeds to be set.

An "X-Y" recorder drives the chart depending on the value of another process signal. For example, a [[universal testing machine]] may plot the tension force on a specimen against its length. Depending on the particular recorder, either the paper chart is moved or else the pen carriage has two axes of motion. Examples of an x-y recorder date back to the 18th century in the form of the [[Pressure volume diagram|steam indicator diagram]]s used to record pressure and volume in steam engines.

==Marking mechanisms==
[[File:Circular chart recorder.agr.jpg|thumb|upright|A circular chart recorder tracking temperature in a building]]
Many mechanisms have been adopted for marking paper. In the telegraphic [[siphon recorder]] of 1858 a fine capillary tube is connected to an ink reservoir and is deflected by the process signal. In modern strip chart recorders, a disposable cartridge combining both a fiber-tipped pen and ink reservoir has been used. Other types of recorder use a heated stylus and thermally sensitive paper, an impact printer using a ribbon and an electrically operated hammer, an electric signal acting through a stylus onto electro-sensitive paper, or an electric spark that makes a visible spot on aluminized paper. One form of sensitive and high-speed recorder used beams of ultraviolet light reflected off mirror [[galvanometer]]s, directed at light-sensitive paper. &lt;ref&gt;Walt Boyes (ed), ''Instrumentation Reference Book (3rd Edition)'', Elsevier, 2003 978-0-7506-7123-1  pages 704-705&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest instruments derived power to move the pen directly from the sensed process signal, which limited their sensitivity and speed of response. Friction between the marking device and paper would reduce the accuracy of the measurements. Instruments with pneumatic, mechanical, or electromechanical amplifiers decoupled pen movement from process measurement, greatly increasing the sensitivity of the instrument and the flexibility of the recorder. Directly-driven pens often moved in the arc of a circle, making the scale difficult to read; pre-printed charts have curvilinear scales printed on them that compensated for the path of the marking pen.&lt;ref name=Bolton91&gt;W. Bolton ''Industrial Control And Instrumentation ''Universities Press, 1991 {{ISBN|81-7371-364-2}}, pages 138-144&lt;/ref&gt;

==Galvanometer instruments==
{{See also|Galvanometer}}
Many types of chart recorders use a [[galvanometer]] to drive the marking device. A light coil of wire suspended in the magnetic field of a permanent magnet deflects in proportion to the current through it; instead of the pointer and scale of a direct-reading meter, the recorder deflects a pen or other marking device. The writing mechanism may be a heated needle writing on heat-sensitive paper or a simple hollow ink-fed pen. If the pen is continuously pressed against the paper, the galvanometer must be strong enough to move the pen against the friction of the paper. To lessen the strain on the galvanometer the pen might instead only intermittently be pressed against the writing medium, to make an impression, and then move while pressure is released.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Where greater sensitivity and speed of response is required a [[mirror galvanometer]], might be used instead, to deflected a beam of light which can be recorded photographically.

==Potentiometric (servo) instruments==
Analog chart recorders using a galvanometer movement to directly drive the pen have limited sensitivity. In a potentiometric type of recorder, the direct drive of the marking pen is replaced with a [[servomechanism]] where energy to move the pen is supplied by an amplifier. The motor-operated pen is arranged to move the sliding contact of a [[potentiometer]] to feed back the pen position to an error amplifier. The amplifier drives the motor in such a direct as to reduce the error between desired and actual pen position to zero. With a suitable signal processing amplifier, such instruments can record a wide range of process signals. However, the inertia of the servo system limits the speed of response, making these instruments most useful for signals changing over the span of a second or more.&lt;ref&gt;Béla G. Lipták ''Process control and optimization'' CRC Press, 2006 {{ISBN|0-8493-1081-4}}, page 820&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital chart recorders==
A modern chart recorder is an [[embedded system|embedded computer system]] with an [[analog to digital converter]], a [[microcontroller]], and a hard-copy printing device; such instruments allow great flexibility in signal processing, variable chart speed on process upsets, and can also communicate their measurements to remote points.

One of the first digital units was designed by William (Bill) C. McElroy jr working for Dohrman Instrument Company in Santa Clara, California.  Up until this unit, most chart recorders were rack mounted and had one speed and one sensitivity range.  Mr. McElroy's design was an instant loading paper roll 'table-top' unit using an Integrated Chopper Circuit for signal conversion.  The unit had plug in circuit boards, plug in single or multi-range modules and plug in single or multi-speed modules.  The recorder's sensitivity was 1 microvolt to 100 volts full-scale, which at the time was an industry first.  Mr. McElroy also aided in the design and build of the Gas Chromatograph used for analysing dirt and rock samples from the 1969 moon landing.  &lt;ref&gt;William (Bill) C. McElroy jr engineering technician &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4324">In computer programming, a '''compile and go system''', '''compile, load, and go system''', '''assemble and go system''', or '''load and go system'''{{sfn|Weik|2000a|p=66}}{{sfn|Weik|2000b|p=260}}{{sfn|Dhotre|Puntambekar|2008|pp=3—2}}
is a programming language processor in which the [[compiler|compilation]], [[assembler (computer programming)|assembly]], or [[linker (computing)|link]] steps are not separated from [[Execution (computing)|program execution]].  The intermediate forms of the program are generally kept in [[primary memory]], and not saved to the [[file system]].{{sfn|Donovan|1972|pp=150}}{{sfn|Janson|1985|pp=184}}{{sfn|Morris|1992|pp=477}}{{sfn|Isrd|2006|pp=226}}{{sfn|Joseph|2007|pp=130}}{{sfn|Dhotre|Puntambekar|2008|pp=3—2}}{{sfn|Weik|2000a|p=66}}{{sfn|Weik|2000b|p=260}}

Examples of compile-and-go systems are [[WATFOR]], [[PL/C]], and [[Dartmouth BASIC]].{{sfn|Dhotre|Puntambekar|2008|pp=3—2}}

An example of a load-and-go system is the [[OS/360 and successors|OS/360]] loader, which performed many of the functions of the [[Linker (computing)|Linkage Editor]], but placed the linked program in memory rather than creating an executable on disk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=IBM Corporation|title=IBM OS Linkage Editor and Loader|year=1972|url=http://bitsavers.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/pdf/ibm/360/os/R21.0_Mar72/GC28-6538-9_OS_Linkage_Editor_and_Loader_Release_21_Jan72.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compile and go systems differ from [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreters]], which either directly execute [[source code]] or execute an [[intermediate representation]].

==Analysis==
Advantages of compile-and-go systems are:
* The user need not be concerned with the separate steps of compilation, assembling, linking, loading, and executing.
* Execution speed is generally much superior to interpreted systems.

Disadvantages of compile-and-go loaders are:
* There is wastage in memory space due to the presence of the assembler.{{sfn|Isrd|2006|pp=226}}{{sfn|Dhotre|Puntambekar|2008|pp=3—2}}
* The code must be reprocessed every time it is run.{{sfn|Janson|1985|pp=189}}{{sfn|Isrd|2006|pp=226}}{{sfn|Dhotre|Puntambekar|2008|pp=3—2}}
* Systems with multiple modules, possibly in different languages, cannot be handled naturally within this framework.{{sfn|Isrd|2006|pp=226}}{{sfn|Dhotre|Puntambekar|2008|pp=3—2}}

Compile-and-go systems were popular in academic environments, where student programs were small, compiled many times, usually executed quickly and, once debugged, seldom needed to be re-executed.

'''Critical technical practice''' is [[critical theory]] based approach towards technological design proposed by [[Phil Agre]] where [[critical theory|critical]] and [[cultural studies|cultural]] theories are brought to bear in the work of designers and [[engineer]]s. One of the goals of critical technical practice is to increase awareness and critical reflection on the hidden assumptions, ideologies and values underlying technology design.

== Pedagogy of Critical Technical Practice ==
 
A different fork of Critical Technical Practice from Agre’s root (Agre, 1997) was initiated at the former Centre for Cultural Studies between 2007-2017, Goldsmiths, University of London as a way to examine, the live techno-social aspects of contemporary digital culture. This stream of Critical Technical Practice (CTP) at its most broad use can be described as the formation of thought and action that incorporates art as a method of enquiry. This is a compacted intellectual form, that makes the space between the technical, theory and practice ambiguous. A typical digital culture class would make/explore things, attempting to explain the phenomena caught in the lens of a project or proposition. 
 
An example of a class may clarify this approach. We might propose that the class create a simple (DOS) denial of service attack on a test remote server by learning to code computers for the first time. It is empowering for students to find out how quickly they can code. The class would learn how to do this from T.J. Connor’s book Violent Python. After the group had reached a self-satisfied tingle of radicalism the group would be asked to look up the author and would find that Connor is a top grade US Military expert. The group would then look at the books distribution and market penetration and be encouraged to question the affective logics, politics and culture of the book, reflect on why the workshop had been constructed the way it was, and their own learning in different registers of technicality, politics of information and personal critic and empowerment was achieved. 
 
Critical Technical Practice then is not necessarily a reduction of phenomena to literature or a system of logics, but can instead be thought of as knowledge incorporated into a thing that the class created, look at or pointed too, through revealing a certain type of gaze.  A prerequisite of Critical Practice is that incorporates this form of gaze is thinking through the formation of oneself as a thinker, actor in the world. Enquiring into one's pre-existence helps understand the structuring of potential that has informed what one has become, what one could easily recognise, and what one could easily achieve. This is not a summation of limit but an acknowledgement of the hard work needed to escape a pre-existence, as it may relate to the four pillars of repression, class, gender, sexuality and race. The situated knowledge of family and friends, their relation to making things, to popular culture, to oral histories, to struggles with money or law, reading, writing and speaking, all inform this process. 
 
To this end, CTP is partially related to a schizoanalysis of Foucault's question  “What are we today?” (Foucault 1984: pp. 42ff.) The class is always encouraged to unfold what conditions, constrain, control, resist, govern, determine this moment and not another? What patterns of recognition are we privileging and why does it blind us to others? How does language restrict us at the very moment we are able to say something? How can this engagement be born anew in every instance?

[[Image:Loki.jpg|thumb|The sounding rocket ''Loki'' with dart]]
A '''dart''' is a free flying top of a [[sounding rocket]], and contains the [[Payload (air and space craft)|payload]]. Its form is very [[aerodynamics|aerodynamically]] designed. After the launch stage burned out the dart is detached and continues to rise only with its own [[inertia]].

Some sounding rockets are available both with or without dart. The version without dart is able to transport more payload, but reaches lesser height.

'''''Deepwater Nautilus''''' is an ultra-deepwater, [[semi-submersible]] [[offshore drilling]] [[Drilling rig|rig]].

Built in 2000 in [[South Korea]], she is owned by [[Transocean]], registered in [[Panama]], and currently leased through August 2017 to [[Royal Dutch Shell]] at the rate of $531,000 per day for drilling operations in the [[Gulf of Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deepwater.com/assets/Documents/February%202016%20Fleet%20Status%20Report.pdf Transocean Fleet Status Report: February 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''Deepwater Nautilus'' is a fifth-generation, RBS-8M design, ultra-deepwater, column-stabilized, semi-submersible [[Offshore drilling|mobile offshore drilling unit]], designed to drill [[subsea]] wells for oil exploration and production.&lt;ref name=rigzone&gt;{{cite web | url=http://rigzone.com/data/rig_detail.asp?rig_id=155 | title=Rig Data: Deepwater Nautilus | publisher=Rigzone | accessdate=2010-06-19}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

She was designed by [[Reading &amp; Bates]] RBS-8M and built by [[Hyundai Heavy Industries]] in 2000 at the [[Ulsan]] shipyard in [[South Korea]]. ''Deepwater Nautilus'' can operate at water depths up to {{convert|8000|ft}} and has drilling depth down to {{convert|30000|ft}}.&lt;ref name=subsea&gt;
{{cite web | url=http://www.subsea.org/drilling-rigs/rigspec.asp?rigID=1051 | title=Deepwater Nautilus Drilling Rig | publisher=Subsea.Org | accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Drilling===
In 2000, ''Deepwater Nautilus'' set the world water-depth record for an offshore drilling rig operating in moored configuration at {{convert|7785|ft}} at the Alaminos Canyon block 557 in the United State sector of the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;ref name=records&gt;
{{cite web | url=http://www.rigzone.com/news/oil_gas/a/13493/Deepwater_Nautilus_Breaks_World_Record_for_Moored_Rig | title=Deepwater Nautilus Breaks World Record for Moored Rig | publisher=RigZone | date=May 27, 2004 | accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, ''Deepwater Nautilus'' discovered oil at the Shell-operated Great White oil field in Alaminos Canyon block 813.&lt;ref name=rigzone260310&gt;
{{cite news | url=http://www.rigzone.com/news/article.asp?a_id=90122 | title=Analysis: U.S. to Reap Fruits of Deepwater Labor | publisher=Rigzone
 | date=March 26, 2010 | accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 6, 2002 she drilled a well in water depth of {{convert|8009|ft}} at the Great White field (Alaminos Canyon block 857).&lt;ref name=offshore011002&gt;
{{cite news | title=Deepwater Nautilus sets another world record in the GoM | url=http://www.offshore-mag.com/index/article-display/159782/articles/offshore/volume-62/issue-10/news/deepwater-nautilus-sets-another-world-record-in-the-gom.html | first=Judy | last=Maksoud | newspaper=Offshore Magazine | publisher=[[PennWell Corporation]] | date=October 1, 2002 | issue=10 | volume=62 | accessdate=2010-06-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year, the new record was set at {{convert|8070|ft}} while drilling at the Alaminos Canyon block 813.&lt;ref name=records/&gt;

This record was surpassed in 2003 by waterdepth of {{convert|8717|ft}} at the Alaminos Canyon block 857.&lt;ref name=rigzone070504&gt;

| publisher=Rigzone | date=May 7, 2004 | accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the water-depth of {{convert|8951|ft}} was achieved in Lloyd block 399.&lt;ref name=records/&gt;

In March 2009, ''Deepwater Nautilus'' discovered oil at the Appomattox prospect in [[Mississippi Canyon]] blocks 391 and 392.&lt;ref name=rigzone190310&gt;

===Incidents===
In 2004, at the time of [[Hurricane Ivan]] ''Deepwater Nautilus'' broke free from its location.&lt;ref name=allbusiness160904&gt;{{cite news

In 2005, as a result of [[Hurricane Katrina]] ''Deepwater Nautilus'' had drifted off location. All personnel had been safely evacuated before the approach of the storm.&lt;ref name=rigzone300805&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.rigzone.com/news/article.asp?a_id=24817 | title=Transocean's Deepwater Nautilus Drifts Off Location | publisher=Rigzone | date=August 30, 2005 | accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rig's mooring system revealed significant damage and the rig lost approximately {{convert|3200|ft}} of marine riser and a portion of the subsea well control system.&lt;ref name=rigzone310805&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.rigzone.com/news/article.asp?a_id=24868 | title=Transocean's Deepwater Nautilus Damaged During Hurricane Katrina | publisher=Rigzone | date=August 31, 2005 | accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less than a month later, ''Deepwater Nautilus'' broke free during [[Hurricane Rita]].&lt;ref name=rigzone230905&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.rigzone.com/news/article.asp?a_id=25508 | title=Deepwater Nautilus Breaks Loose in Heavy Hurricane Rita Seas | publisher=Rigzone | date=September 23, 2005 | accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==
It was manufactured in thin flexible sheets with a rubbery texture, technically known as a [[Use forms of explosives#Rubberized|rubberized explosive]] and is generally colored either reddish/orange (commercial) or green (military). In use, it is typically cut to shape for precision [[engineer]]ing charges.

Compared to other explosives detasheet is very stable. It is detonated with a [[blasting cap]] or [[Detonating cord|primercord]] but not by [[small-arms]] fire, heat, water, pressure, or concussion. Detasheet is relatively expensive compared to other explosives.

'''Detasheet C''', the last and most common version produced, was made up of 63% PETN, 8% nitrocellulose, and 29% [[acetyl tributyl citrate]] (ATBC), an organic [[plasticizer]].&lt;ref name="Cooper"/&gt;

=== Production status ===
DuPont ceased manufacturing explosives in the 1990s and the trademark is now owned by [[Ensign-Bickford Company|Ensign-Bickford Aerospace and Defense Company]], which now sells a very similar explosive sheet called [[Primasheet]].&lt;ref name="Cooper"/&gt;

== Deta Flex ==
A military variant of Detasheet, called '''Deta Flex''', was manufactured in a single thickness (0.25&amp;nbsp;inch (6.25&amp;nbsp;mm)) and olive green colored.  Deta Flex contains a higher percentage of PETN (70%).&lt;ref name="Cooper"/&gt;

=== LX-02-1 ===
A version of Deta Flex is manufactured for [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] research purposes, colored blue and manufactured in various thicknesses.  LX-02-1 contains 73.5% PETN, 17.6% [[butyl rubber]], 6.9% ATBC, and 2.0% [[Fumed silica|Cab-o-sil]].&lt;ref name="Cooper"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1357">'''Dishmaker''' is a machine which creates cups, bowls, and plates from acrylic material and can recycle them into their raw material when they are done being used. 

It was designed by Leonardo Bonanni and made by The [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] [[MIT Media Lab|Media Lab]]’s Counter Intelligence Group.

Dishmaker uses the shape-memory property of [[Polymethyl methacrylate|acrylic]] to make the dishes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6111">[[Image:Elastrator rings.JPG|thumb|250px|Rubber elastrator rings and pliers]]
'''Elastration''' (a portmanteau of "elastic" and "castration") is a bloodless method of male [[castration]] and [[Docking (animal)|docking]] commonly used for [[livestock]]. Elastration is simply [[Banding (medical)|banding]] the body part ([[scrotum]] or [[tail]]) until it drops off. This method is favored for its simplicity, low cost, and minimal training requirements.

==Castration==
Elastration is the most common method used to castrate [[sheep]] and [[goat]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pipevet.com/articles/Baby_Lamb_Processing.htm Baby Lamb Processing&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; but is also common in [[cattle]].&lt;ref name="Cattleman Article"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thecattlemanmagazine.com/issues/2003/1003/SoonerBetter.asp |title=Cattleman Article&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2007-12-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061110095152/http://www.thecattlemanmagazine.com/issues/2003/1003/SoonerBetter.asp |archive-date=2006-11-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Procedure===
Elastration involves restraining the animal, without the need for anesthesia or sedation (unlike most other castration methods), in a position that provides access to the genitals.  Special ''elastrator pliers'' are then used to place a tight [[latex]] (rubber) ''elastrator ring'' gently around the base of the [[scrotum]].&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;  This cuts the blood supply to the scrotum and testicles, which will totally decay and slough off within a few weeks.&lt;ref&gt;http://animals.pawnation.com/billy-goats-smell-bad-3344.html#Wethering Why Do Billy Goats Smell So Bad?&lt;/ref&gt;  Care must be taken during the procedure to ensure that both testicles are fully descended and properly located inside the scrotum, and that the animal's nipples are not included within the ring.  Elastration is normally limited to castrations done during the first few weeks of life, and it cannot be used for species where the scrotum does not have a narrow base, such as [[pig]]s or [[horse]]s. It is commonly recommended to not use this method on goats until they are 8 weeks or older. This is due to possible complications that could occur later in life like Urinary Calculi. "Goats banding from day 1–30 are most at risk."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ansc.purdue.edu/SP/MG/Documents/SLIDES/Urinary%20calculi.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; There are those who feel that this method is inhumane and choose to use other methods. These methods would include what some call the "Emasculatome", "[[Burdizzo]]", or "Richey Nipper". The Burdizzo and Richey Nipper are names of tools used for the process of the emasculatome.

===Possible complications===
Some European countries have banned the practice due to their belief that the procedure is inhumane. There is some evidence that elastration is more painful if carried out on older animals,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avma.org/reference/backgrounders/castration_cattle_bgnd.asp Welfare implications of castration of cattle, American Veterinary Medical Association paper]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebeefsite.com/articles/909/effects-of-age-and-method-of-castration-on-performance-and-stress-response-of-beef-cattle Hajiba Zaaboul, ''Effects of Age and Method of Castration on Performance and Stress Response of Beef Cattle'', Ag-Info Centre, Alberta Agriculture and Food.]&lt;/ref&gt; although much of the immediate pain of application can be prevented by injection of local anaesthesia into the scrotal neck and testicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dinniss|first=AS|author2=Mellor, DJ |author3=Stafford, KJ |author4=Bruce, RA |author5= Ward, RN |title=Acute cortisol responses of lambs to castration using a rubber ring and/or a castration clamp with or without local anaesthetic.|journal=New Zealand veterinary journal|date=Jun 1997|volume=45|issue=3|pages=114–21|pmid=16031965|doi=10.1080/00480169.1997.36005}}&lt;!--|accessdate=19 May 2013 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Practitioners usually try to elastrate as soon as possible, once the testicles have descended, to reduce the amount of dead tissue, infection, and accompanying complications.&lt;ref name="Cattleman Article"/&gt;  However, with some animals such as goats, castrating too early increases the frequency of [[kidney stone]]s and urinary problems due to reduced size of the [[urethra]], so elastration may be postponed.&lt;ref&gt;Fiasco Farms.  Goat Health &amp; Husbandry.  [http://fiascofarm.com/goats/buck-wether-info.htm#Banding Male Goat Information: Bucks &amp; Wethers]. Retrieved 6 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; If bull calves are castrated within the first one or two days the testes may sometimes be small and soft enough to be drawn up through the ring, and they continue to develop above the scrotum &amp;ndash; surgical castration then becomes necessary.

Improper use of banding on cats can result in death and charges of cruelty. &lt;ref&gt;Three from Wisconsin Dells charged in bungled kitten castration [https://lacrossetribune.com/news/state-and-regional/wi/three-from-wisconsin-dells-charged-in-bungled-kitten-castration/article_eeff845b-4fa9-5534-8fa9-20c93892f41f.html#1]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Docking==
[[File:Two lambs rubber ring tail docking, cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Lambs with rubber rings on their tails]]
[[Image:Elastration Lambs Tail.jpg|thumb|Elastrated lamb tail]]
The same tool and rings are also used to [[Docking (animal)|dock]] the tails of many breeds of sheep, to prevent dung building up on the tails (which can lead to [[fly strike]]).  This is usually done at the same time as castration of the ram lambs.

It is also called sheep marking in Australia.

==Overview==
The ''[[Mars Global Surveyor]]'', ''[[2001 Mars Odyssey|Mars Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Mars Express]]'' orbiters carry the first generation of [[UHF]] relay payloads. Building on this initial experience, NASA developed a next-generation relay payload, the Electra Proximity Link Payload, which flew for the first time on the 2005 ''[[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]]''.&lt;ref name='MRO comm'/&gt;

Using Mars orbiters as radio relays to increase data return from rovers and other landers reduces the mass and power the surface spacecraft need for communications.&lt;ref name='MRO News 2006'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/MRO/news/mrof-20061117.html |title=NASA's Newest Mars Orbiter Passes Communications Relay Test |publisher=NASA |first=Guy |last=Webster |date=17 November 2006 |accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A special feature is that it can actively adjust the data rate during a communication session – slower when the orbiter is near the horizon from the surface robot's perspective, faster when it is overhead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://exploration.esa.int/mars/58440-nasa-electra-radio-for-the-trace-gas-orbiter/ |title=NASA Electra Radio for the Trace Gas Orbiter |publisher=European Space Agency |date=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To build the relay network cost-effectively, NASA includes a relay communications payload on each of its science orbiters. Mars missions launched after 2005 make use of Electra UHF [[transceiver]] to provide for any navigation, command, and data-return needs these missions may have. The arriving spacecraft can receive these signals and determine its distance and speed in relation to Mars. This communication allows much more precise navigation.&lt;ref name='Telecomm 2009'/&gt;

When NASA's landers and rovers land safely on Mars, Electra can provide precise Doppler data which, when combined with ''Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter''{{'s}} position information, can accurately determine the location of the lander or rover on the surface of Mars. Electra can also provide [[UHF]] coverage to Mars landers and rovers on the surface using its [[nadir]]-pointed (pointed straight down at the surface) antenna. This coverage would be important to landed crafts on Mars that might not have sufficient radio power to communicate directly with Earth by themselves.&lt;ref name='MRO comm'/&gt;

The purpose of '''electro-mechanical modeling''' is to model and [[Computer simulation|simulate]] an [[electro-mechanical]] system, such that its physical parameters can be examined before the actual system is built. Parameter estimation and physical realization of the overall system is the major design objective of Electro-Mechanical modeling. Theory driven mathematical model can be used or applied to other system to judge the performance of the joint system as a whole. This is a well known &amp; proven technique for designing large control system for industrial as well as academic multi-disciplinary complex system. This technique is also being employed in MEMS technology recently.

==Different types of mathematical modelling==

The modeling of purely mechanical systems is mainly based on the Lagrangian which is a function of the generalized coordinates and the associated velocities. If all forces are derivable from a potential, then the time behavior of the dynamical systems is completely determined. For simple mechanical systems, the Lagrangian is defined as the difference of the kinetic energy and the potential energy.

There exists a similar approach for electrical system. By means of the electrical co-energy and well defined power quantities, the equations of motions are uniquely defined. The currents of the inductors and the voltage drops across the capacitors play the role of the generalized coordinates. All constraints, for instance caused by the Kirchhoff laws, are eliminated from the considerations. After that, a suitable transfer function is to be derived from the system parameters which eventually governs the behavior of the system.

In consequence, we have quantities (kinetic and potential energy, generalized forces) which determine the mechanical part and quantities (co-energy, powers) for the description of the electrical part. This offers a combination of the mechanical and electrical parts by means of an energy approach. As a result, an extended Lagrangian format is produced.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1330">'''Electromigrated Nanogaps''' are gaps formed in metallic bridges formed by the process of [[electromigration]].

==Theory==
A nanosized contact formed by [[electromigration]] acts like a waveguide for electrons. The nanocontact essentially acts like a one-dimensional wire with a conductance of &lt;math&gt;G =2e^2/h&lt;/math&gt;. The current in a wire is the velocity of the electrons multiplied by the charge and number per unit length, &lt;math&gt;I = veN/L&lt;/math&gt;  or &lt;math&gt;G=veN/LV&lt;/math&gt;. This gives a conductance of &lt;math&gt;G=ve^2N/LE&lt;/math&gt;. In nano scale bridges the conductance falls in discrete steps of multiples of the quantum conductance &lt;math&gt;G =2e^2/h&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Electronics''' comprises the physics, engineering, technology and applications that deal with the emission, flow and control of [[electron]]s in vacuum and [[matter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/electronics|title=electronics {{!}} Devices, Facts, &amp; History|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-09-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The identification of the electron in 1897, along with the invention of the [[vacuum tube]], which could [[amplifier|amplify]] and [[rectifier|rectify]] small electrical signals,  inaugurated the field of electronics and the electron age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200010/history.cfm|title=October 1897: The Discovery of the Electron|language=en|access-date=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electronics deals with [[electrical circuit]]s that involve [[active component|active electrical components]] such as vacuum tubes, [[transistor]]s, [[diode]]s, [[integrated circuit]]s, [[optoelectronics]], and [[sensor]]s, associated [[Passivity (engineering)|passive electrical components]], and interconnection technologies. Commonly, electronic devices contain circuitry consisting primarily or exclusively of active [[semiconductor]]s supplemented with passive elements; such a circuit is described as an [[electronic circuit]].

The [[nonlinear]] behaviour of active components and their ability to control electron flows makes amplification of weak signals possible.  Electronics is widely used in [[information processing]], [[telecommunication]], and [[signal processing]].  The ability of electronic devices to act as [[switch]]es makes digital information-processing possible.  Interconnection technologies such as [[circuit board]]s, electronics packaging technology, and other varied forms of communication infrastructure complete circuit functionality and transform the mixed components into a regular working [[system]].

[[Electricity|Electrical]] and [[Electromechanics|electromechanical]] science and technology deals with the generation, distribution, switching, storage, and conversion of electrical energy to and from other energy forms (using [[wire]]s, [[Electric motor|motors]], [[Electric generator|generators]], [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]], [[switch]]es, [[relay]]s, [[transformer]]s, [[resistor]]s, and other [[passive component]]s). This distinction started around 1906 with the invention by [[Lee De Forest]] of the [[triode]], which made electrical [[Amplifier|amplification]] of weak radio signals and audio signals possible with a non-mechanical device.  Until 1950 this field was called "radio technology" because its principal application was the design and theory of radio [[transmitter]]s, [[Receiver (radio)|receivers]], and [[vacuum tube]]s.

{{As of | 2018}} most electronic devices use [[semiconductor]] components to perform electron control.  The study of semiconductor devices and related technology is considered a branch of [[solid-state physics]], whereas the design and construction of [[electronic circuit]]s to solve practical problems come under [[electronics engineering]].  This article focuses on [[engineering]] aspects of electronics.

{{main|Electronic component}}
An electronic component is any physical entity in an [[electronic system]] used to affect the [[electron]]s or their associated fields in a manner consistent with the intended function of the electronic system. Components are generally intended to be connected together, usually by being soldered to a [[printed circuit board]] (PCB), to create an electronic circuit with a particular function (for example an [[amplifier]], [[radio receiver]], or [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator]]). Components may be packaged singly, or in more complex groups as [[integrated circuit]]s. Some common electronic components are [[capacitor]]s, [[inductor]]s, [[resistor]]s, [[diode]]s, [[transistor]]s, etc. Components are often categorized as active (e.g. transistors and [[thyristor]]s) or [[Passivity (engineering)|passive]] (e.g. resistors, diodes, inductors and capacitors).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Power Electronics and Variable Frequency Drives: Technology and Applications |publisher= Wiley Online Library|language=en|doi=10.1002/9780470547113|year = 1996|isbn = 978-0470547113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of electronic components ==
{{Further|History of electronic engineering|Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering}}

[[Vacuum tube]]s (Thermionic valves) were among the earliest electronic components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|date=2012|title=The age of vacuum tubes: Early devices and the rise of radio communications|journal=IEEE Ind. Electron. M.|volume=6|issue=1|pages=41–43|doi=10.1109/MIE.2012.2182822|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They were almost solely responsible for the electronics revolution of the first half of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|date=2012|title=The age of vacuum tubes: the conquest of analog communications|journal=IEEE Ind.

They played a leading role in the field of microwave and high power transmission as well as television receivers until the middle of the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Okamura1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sōgo Okamura|title=History of Electron Tubes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VHFyngmO95YC&amp;pg=PR4|accessdate=5 December 2012|year=1994|publisher=IOS Press|isbn=978-9051991451|page=5|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231220508/http://books.google.com/books?id=VHFyngmO95YC&amp;pg=PR4|archivedate=31 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since that time, [[Solid-state electronics|solid-state]] devices have all but completely taken over. Vacuum tubes are still used in some specialist applications such as [[Valve RF amplifier|high power RF amplifiers]], [[cathode ray tube]]s, specialist audio equipment, [[guitar amplifiers]] and some [[Cavity magnetron|microwave devices]].

In April 1955, the [[IBM 608]] was the first [[IBM]] product to use [[transistor]] circuits without any vacuum tubes and is believed to be the first all-transistorized [[calculator]] to be manufactured for the commercial market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Bashe |first= Charles J.  |title=IBM's Early Computers |publisher= MIT |year= 1986 |page=386 |ref=harv |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pugh |first1=Emerson W. |last2=Johnson |first2=Lyle R. |last3=Palmer |first3=John H. |year=1991 |title=IBM's 360 and early 370 systems |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0262161237 |page=34 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 608 contained more than 3,000 [[germanium]] transistors.  [[Thomas J. Watson Jr.]] ordered all future IBM products to use transistors in their design.  From that time on transistors were almost exclusively used for computer logic and peripherals.

== Types of circuits ==
Circuits and components can be divided into two groups: analog and digital. A particular device may consist of circuitry that has one or the other or a mix of the two types.

=== Analog circuits ===
{{Main|Analog electronics}}
[[File:HitachiJ100A.jpg|right|thumb|Hitachi J100 adjustable frequency drive chassis]]
Most [[analog signal|analog]] electronic appliances, such as [[radio]] receivers, are constructed from combinations of a few types of basic circuits. [[Analog circuits]] use a continuous range of voltage or current as opposed to discrete levels as in digital circuits.

The number of different analog circuits so far devised is huge, especially because a 'circuit' can be defined as anything from a single component, to systems containing thousands of components.

Analog circuits are sometimes called [[linear circuit]]s although many non-linear effects are used in analog circuits such as mixers, modulators, etc. Good examples of analog circuits include vacuum tube and transistor amplifiers, operational amplifiers and oscillators.

One rarely finds modern circuits that are entirely analog. These days analog circuitry may use digital or even microprocessor techniques to improve performance. This type of circuit is usually called "mixed signal" rather than analog or digital.

Sometimes it may be difficult to differentiate between analog and digital circuits as they have elements of both linear and non-linear operation. An example is the comparator which takes in a continuous range of voltage but only outputs one of two levels as in a digital circuit. Similarly, an overdriven transistor amplifier can take on the characteristics of a controlled [[switch]] having essentially two levels of output.  In fact, many digital circuits are actually implemented as variations of analog circuits similar to this example&amp;nbsp;– after all, all aspects of the real physical world are essentially analog, so digital effects are only realized by constraining analog behavior.

=== Digital circuits ===
{{Main|Digital electronics}}
Digital circuits are electric circuits based on a number of discrete voltage levels. Digital circuits are the most common physical representation of [[Boolean logic|Boolean algebra]], and are the basis of all digital computers. To most engineers, the terms "digital circuit", "digital system" and "logic" are interchangeable in the context of digital circuits.
Most digital circuits use a binary system with two voltage levels labeled "0" and "1". Often logic "0" will be a lower voltage and referred to as "Low" while logic "1" is referred to as "High".  However, some systems use the reverse definition ("0" is "High") or are current based.  Quite often the logic designer may reverse these definitions from one circuit to the next as he sees fit to facilitate his design.  The definition of the levels as "0" or "1" is arbitrary.

[[Ternary computer|Ternary]] (with three states) logic has been studied, and some prototype computers made.

[[Computer]]s, electronic [[quartz clock|clocks]], and [[programmable logic controller]]s (used to control industrial processes) are constructed of [[Digital data|digital]] circuits. [[Digital signal processor]]s are another example.

Building blocks:
* [[Logic gate]]s
* [[Adder (electronics)|Adders]]
* [[Flip-flop (electronics)|Flip-flops]]
* [[Counter (digital)|Counters]]
* [[Processor register|Registers]]
* [[Multiplexer]]s
* [[Schmitt trigger]]s

Highly integrated devices:
* [[Microprocessor]]s
* [[Microcontroller]]s
* [[Application-specific integrated circuit]] (ASIC)
* [[Digital signal processor]] (DSP)
* [[Field-programmable gate array]] (FPGA)

== Heat dissipation and thermal management ==
{{Main|Thermal management of electronic devices and systems}}
[[Heat]] generated by electronic circuitry must be dissipated to prevent immediate failure and improve long term reliability. Heat dissipation is mostly achieved by passive conduction/convection. Means to achieve greater dissipation include [[heat sink]]s and [[Mechanical fan|fans]] for air cooling, and other forms of [[computer cooling]] such as [[water cooling]]. These techniques use [[convection]], [[Heat conduction|conduction]], and [[radiation]] of heat energy.

== Noise ==
{{Main|Electronic noise}}
Electronic noise is defined&lt;ref&gt;IEEE Dictionary of Electrical and Electronics Terms {{ISBN|978-0471428060}}&lt;/ref&gt; as unwanted disturbances superposed on a useful signal that tend to obscure its information content. Noise is not the same as signal distortion caused by a circuit. Noise is associated with all electronic circuits. Noise may be electromagnetically or thermally generated, which can be decreased by lowering the [[operating temperature]] of the circuit. Other types of noise, such as [[shot noise]] cannot be removed as they are due to limitations in physical properties.

== Electronics theory ==
{{Main|Mathematical methods in electronics}}

Mathematical methods are integral to the study of electronics. To become proficient in electronics it is also necessary to become proficient in the mathematics of circuit analysis.

Circuit analysis is the study of methods of solving generally linear systems for unknown variables such as the voltage at a certain [[Node (circuits)|node]] or the current through a certain [[Path (graph theory)|branch]] of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|network]]. A common analytical tool for this is the [[SPICE]] circuit simulator.

Also important to electronics is the study and understanding of [[electromagnetic field]] theory.

== Electronics lab ==
{{Main|Electronic circuit simulation}}

Due to the complex nature of electronics theory, laboratory experimentation is an important part of the development of electronic devices.  These experiments are used to test or verify the engineer’s design and detect errors.  Historically, electronics labs have consisted of electronics devices and equipment located in a physical space, although in more recent years the trend has been towards electronics lab simulation software, such as [[CircuitLogix]], [[Multisim]], and [[PSpice]].

== Computer aided design (CAD) ==
{{Main|Electronic design automation}}

Today's electronics engineers have the ability to [[Circuit design|design]] [[Electronic circuit|circuits]] using premanufactured building blocks such as [[power supply|power supplies]], [[semiconductor]]s (i.e. semiconductor devices, such as [[transistor]]s), and [[integrated circuit]]s. [[Electronic design automation]] software programs include [[schematic capture]] programs and [[printed circuit board]] design programs. Popular names in the EDA software world are NI Multisim, Cadence ([[ORCAD]]), [[EAGLE (program)|EAGLE]] PCB and Schematic, Mentor (PADS PCB and LOGIC Schematic), Altium (Protel), LabCentre Electronics (Proteus), gEDA, KiCad and many others.

== Packaging methods ==
{{Main|Electronic packaging}}
Many different methods of connecting components have been used over the years. For instance, early electronics often used [[Point-to-point construction|point to point wiring]] with components attached to wooden breadboards to construct circuits. [[Printed circuit board#"Cordwood" construction|Cordwood construction]] and [[wire wrap]] were other methods used. Most modern day electronics now use printed circuit boards made of materials such as [[FR-4|FR4]], or the cheaper (and less hard-wearing) Synthetic Resin Bonded Paper ([[SRBP]], also known as Paxoline/Paxolin (trade marks) and FR2) – characterised by its brown colour. Health and environmental concerns associated with electronics assembly have gained increased attention in recent years, especially for products destined to the European Union, with its [[Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive]] (RoHS) and [[Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive]] (WEEE), which went into force in July 2006.

== Electronic systems design ==
{{Main|Systems engineering}}
Electronic systems design deals with the multi-disciplinary design issues of complex electronic devices, such as [[mobile phone]]s and [[computer]]s. The subject covers a broad spectrum, from the design and development of an electronic system ([[new product development]]) to assuring its proper function, service life and [[Recycling|disposal]].&lt;ref name="lienig"&gt;{{Cite book|author=J. Lienig|author2=H. Bruemmer|title=Fundamentals of Electronic Systems Design|pp=1|publisher=Springer International Publishing|date=2017|isbn=978-3319558394|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-55840-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electronic systems design is therefore the process of defining and developing complex electronic devices to satisfy specified [[requirement analysis|requirements]] of the user.

A '''eudiometer''' is a laboratory device that measures the change in [[volume]] of a [[gas]] mixture following a physical or [[chemical reaction|chemical]] change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/eudiometer-2?cat=technology|title=Answers - The Most Trusted Place for Answering Life's Questions|work=Answers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

Depending on the reaction being measured, the device can take a variety of forms. In general, it is similar to a [[graduated cylinder]], and is most commonly found in two sizes: 50 mL and 100 mL. It is closed at the top end with the bottom end immersed in [[water]] or [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]. The liquid traps a sample of gas in the cylinder, and the graduation allows the volume of the gas to be measured. For some reactions, two [[platinum]] wires (chosen for their non-reactivity) are placed in the sealed end so an [[electric spark]] can be created between them. The electric spark can initiate a reaction in the gas mixture and the graduation on the cylinder can be read to determine the change in volume resulting from the reaction. The use of the device is quite similar to the original [[barometer]], except that the gas inside displaces some of the liquid that is used.

== History ==
[[File:Teylers Oval room - eudiometer naar J.H. Magellan.jpg|thumb|left|Eudiometer after [[Jean Hyacinthe de Magellan|J.H. de Magellan]], [[Teylers Museum]]]]

In 1772, [[Joseph Priestley]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/museum/esim.asp?c=100145 "Eudiometer". IMSS. 14 Jan 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; began experimenting with different “airs” using his own redesigned [[pneumatic trough]] in which mercury instead of water would trap gases that were usually soluble in water. From these experiments Priestley is credited with discovering many new gases such as [[oxygen]], [[hydrogen chloride]], and [[ammonia]]. He also discovered a way to find the purity or “goodness” of air using “nitrous air test”. This test was conducted by mixing [[nitrous]] gas with a test sample of another gas and trapping it in the pneumatic trough, essentially the greater the decrease in volume, the more pure the sample of gas was (key principle in eudiometry).  [[Henry Cavendish]] later used a similar device to determine the fraction of oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere.

It is from these experiments that [[Marsilio Landriani]] became inspired to create a more useful tool in measuring the “healthiness” of air. In 1775, Landriani invented the first eudiometer and used it to conduct his own experiments. From these experiments Landriani theorized about the temperament of certain gases and the atmosphere and later published a paper called ''Ricerche fisiche intorno alla salubrità dell'aria'' (Physical researches on the salubrity of air). Though many of his findings were incorrect, his invention was the building block for the modern day eudiometer.

Although the eudiometer's invention is usually credited to Marsilio Landriani,&lt;ref&gt;[http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/museum/esim.asp?c=100145 "Eudiometer". IMSS. 14 Jan 2079.]&lt;/ref&gt; it was truly pioneered by Count [[Alessandro Volta]] (1745–1827),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Burke | first = James | title = Connections | publisher = Little, Brown | location = Boston | year = 1978 | isbn = 0-316-11681-5 |pages= 178–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; an Italian physicist who is well known for his contributions to the [[electric battery]] and [[electricity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.italian-american.com/volta.htm|title="Volta: A pioneer in Electrochemistry". 13 Jan 2008.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from its laboratory function, the eudiometer is also known for its part in the "[[Volta pistol]]".&lt;ref&gt;"Apparatus for Natural Philosophy Volta's Pistol". Thomas B. Greensdale Jr.. 17 Jan 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Volta invented this instrument in 1777 for the purpose of testing the "goodness" of air, analyzing the [[flammability]] of gases, or to demonstrate the chemical effects of electricity. Volta's Pistol had a long glass tube that was closed at the top, like a eudiometer. Two electrodes were fed through the tube and produced a spark gap inside the tube. Volta's initial use of this instrument concerned the study of swamp [[gases]] in particular. Volta's pistol was filled with [[oxygen]] and another gas. The [[Homogeneous (chemistry)|homogeneous]] [[mixture]] was taped shut with a cork. A spark could be introduced into the gas chamber by electrodes, and possibly [[catalyze]] a reaction by [[static electricity]], using Volta's [[electrophorus]]. If the gases were [[flammable]], they would explode, and increase the [[pressure]] within the gas chamber. This pressure would be too great and eventually cause the cork to become airborne. Volta's pistol was made with either glass or brass, however due to the electricity the glass was vulnerable to exploding. Volta's extensive studies on measuring and creating high levels of electric currents caused the electrical unit, the [[volt]], to be named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physics.kenyon.edu/EarlyApparatus/Thermodynamics/Eudiometer/Eudiometer.html|title=Eudiometer|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==

The name "eudiometer" comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|εὔδιος}} ''eúdios'' meaning clear or mild, which is the combination of the [[prefix]] ''eu-'' meaning "good", and ''-dios'' meaning "heavenly" or "of Zeus" (the god of the sky and atmosphere),&lt;ref&gt;"Eudiometer." HighBeam Encyclopedia. 3 Dec. 2107 .&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[suffix]] ''-meter'' meaning "measure".&lt;ref&gt;"Eudiometer." New World Dictionary. 2nd ed. 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the eudiometer was originally used to measure the amount of oxygen in the [[air]], which was thought to be greater in "nice" weather,&lt;ref&gt;"Eudiometer." New Oxford American Dictionary. 2nd ed. 2006&lt;/ref&gt; the root ''eudio-'' appropriately describes the apparatus.

== Usage ==

[[File:Scheme of eudiometr.png|thumb|350px|Scheme of eudiometer]]
Applications of a eudiometer include the analysis of gases and the determination of volume differences in chemical reactions. The eudiometer is filled with [[water]], inverted so that its open end is facing the ground (while holding the open end so that no water escapes), and then submersed in a basin of water. A [[chemical reaction]] is taking place through which gas is created. One [[reactant]] is typically at the bottom of the eudiometer (which flows downward when the eudiometer is inverted) and the other reactant is suspended on the rim of the eudiometer, typically by means of a [[platinum]] or [[copper]] wire (due to their low [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]]). When the gas created by the chemical reaction is released, it should rise into the eudiometer so that the experimenter may accurately read the [[volume]] of the gas produced at any given time. Normally a person would read the volume when the reaction is completed. This procedure is followed in many experiments, including an experiment in which one experimentally determines the [[Ideal gas law]] constant R.

The eudiometer is similar in structure to the [[meteorological]] [[barometer]]. Similarly, a eudiometer uses water to release gas into the eudiometer tube, converting the gas into a visible, measurable amount. A correct measurement of the pressure when performing these experiments is crucial for the calculations involved in the ''PV''=''nRT'' equation, because the pressure could change the [[density]] of the gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carlton.srsd119.ca/chemical/GasLaws/gasmass.htm|title=Carlton Comprehensive Public High School|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Malta - Pembroke - Triq Martin Luther King - Fougasse 02 ies.jpg|thumb|Madliena Fougasse in [[Malta]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mepa.org.mt/fou "Fougasse, Madliena Tower area, Pembroke"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222153246/https://www.mepa.org.mt/fou |date=22 December 2015 }} [[Malta Environment and Planning Authority]] (MEPA), 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A '''fougasse''' {{IPAc-en|f|uː|ˈ|ɡ|ɑː|s}} is an improvised [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] constructed by making a hollow in the ground or rock and filling it with explosives (originally, [[black powder]]) and projectiles. The fougasse was used by Samuel Zimmermann at [[Augsburg]]&lt;ref name="The Origins of Military Mines"&gt;''[http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/docs/980700-schneck.htm The Origins of Military Mines]'', Major William C. Schneck, Engineer Bulletin July 1998&lt;/ref&gt; in the sixteenth century, referred to by [[Vauban]] in the seventeenth century, and well known to [[military engineer]]s by the mid-eighteenth century. This technique was used in several European wars, the [[American Revolutionary War|American Revolution]], and the [[American Civil War]]. The term is still used to describe such devices.

== Firing ==
The normal method of firing was to use a burning [[torch]] or [[slow match]] to ignite a ''[[saucisson (pyrotechnics)|saucisson]]'' (French for "[[sausage]]", a cloth or leather tube waterproofed with [[pitch (resin)|pitch]] and filled with black powder) leading to the main charge. This had numerous disadvantages; the firer was obvious to the attacking enemy, and had to race to get clear after lighting the fuse. The black powder was also very susceptible to moisture, and might not work at all. In 1573 Samuel Zimmermann devised an improved method which incorporated a [[snaphance]] (or later, [[flintlock mechanism]]) into the charge and connected its trigger to the surface with a wire.&lt;ref name="The Origins of Military Mines"/&gt; This was more resistant to moisture{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}, better concealed, and enabled the firer to be further away. It also enabled the fougasse to be [[tripwire]] activated, turning it into an [[land mine#Anti-personnel fragmentation mines|anti-personnel fragmentation mine]].

In a letter to his sister, Colonel Hugh Robert Hibbert described such a weapon employed during the [[Crimean War]]:

{{quote|These wretched Russians have discovered a new system of annoyance which would be well worthy of invention by Franky [their brother] and which consists of a series of small mines or barrels of gunpowder let into the ground between our works and theirs, and a little tin tube running along the ground a few inches above it, two or three feet long, which tube is filled with some composition which explodes immediately on being touched, so that any unfortunate meandering along the grass without knowing why, suddenly finds himself going up in the air like a squib with his legs and arms flying in different directions. We have had many men blown up by these things and the grass being so long one cannot see the tube at all. The technical name is "Fougasse". Franky will know what they are I daresay. The ground between our old trenches, and the Russian ones that we took the other day is full of them. At night you hear a sudden explosion and you know that some wretched fellow has been crossing from one trench to another, on private speculation to see what he could get, has trod on the tube and been blown up. I often think how the Russians must laugh when they hear these things going up at night in all directions, they must know well what it is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The National Archives, records of the UK government | work=Letters of Hibbert, Hugh Robert, 1828-1895, Colonel, ref.

== Types ==
There are several variants according to the material projected by the explosion.

=== Stone ===
The most common type in early use was the '''stone fougasse''', which was simply filled with large rocks, bricks, etc. When fired, it would scatter a hail of fast-moving stones across the area to its front. Large stone fougasses might hold several tons of rubble and as much as a [[hundredweight]] of powder.&lt;ref name="morana"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morana|first1=Martin|title=Bejn Kliem u Storja|date=2011|publisher=Books Distributors Limited|location=[[Malta]]|isbn=978-99957-0137-6|url=https://sites.google.com/site/kliemustorja/home/titlu/introduzzjoni/dwar-l-awtur/a/b/c/c/d/e/f|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020104814/https://sites.google.com/site/kliemustorja/home/titlu/introduzzjoni/dwar-l-awtur/a/b/c/c/d/e/f|archivedate=20 October 2016|language=Maltese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Treasures of Malta|last=Spiteri|first=Stephen C.|author-link=Stephen C.

=== Shell ===
The '''shell fougasse''' was loaded with early black powder [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] [[shell (weapon)|shell]]s (essentially a large version of an early black powder [[hand grenade]]) or [[incendiary device|incendiary]] "[[carcass (projectile)|carcass]]es". When fired, the powder charge would throw out the shells and ignite their fuses, so the projectiles would be scattered across the target area and then begin exploding, filling the area with fragmentation or flame from all directions in an effect similar to a [[cluster bomb]].

=== Flame ===
[[File:D 024854 new.jpg|thumb|upright=1.42|A demonstration of Fougasse in Britain. A car is surrounded in flames and a huge cloud of smoke, circa 1940.]]

{{main article|Flame fougasse}}

A '''flame fougasse''' was a similar weapon in which the projectile was a [[flammable liquid]], typically a mixture of [[petrol]] (gasoline) and oil. The flame fougasse was developed by the British [[Petroleum Warfare Department]] in response to [[British anti-invasion preparations of World War II|the threat of German invasion]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Flame Fougasse: Poynings Flame Trap | work=Pillbox Study Group | author = Adrian Armishaw | url=http://www.pillbox-study-group.org.uk/index.php/defence-articles/flame-fougasse-poynings-flame-trap/ | accessdate=15 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, during WWII, the flame fougasse was usually constructed from a 40-gallon drum dug into the roadside and camouflaged. It would be placed at a location such as a corner, steep incline or roadblock where vehicles would be obliged to slow down. [[Ammonal]] provided the propellant charge which, when triggered, caused the weapon to shoot a flame {{convert|10|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|30|yd|m}} long. Initially a mixture of 40% petrol and 60% gas oil was used; this was later replaced by an adhesive gel of tar, lime and petrol known as 5B.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, 2001, p18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The November 1944 issue of the US War Department Intelligence Bulletin refers to 'Fougasse flame throwers' used in the Russian defence at Stalingrad being the basis of a German version found in Italy that were buried with a fixed direction discharge tube and integrated with conventional landmines and barbed wire in defense works. The German weapon, the [[Abwehrflammenwerfer 42]] had an 8-gallon fuel tank and the seven in the installation were wired back to a control point and could be fired individually or together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The flame fougasse has remained in army field manuals as a battlefield expedient. Such expedients are constructed from available fuel containers combined with standard explosive charges or hand grenades triggered electrically or by lengths of [[detonating cord]]. Some designs use lengths of detonating cord or blasting caps to rupture the fuel container as well as detonate the main charge.&lt;ref&gt;FM 20-33, 1967, chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Weapons of this sort were widely used in the [[Korean War|Korean]] and [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] wars as well as other conflicts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9006">'''Gas diffusion electrodes''' ('''GDE''') are [[electrode]]s with a conjunction of a solid, liquid and gaseous interface, and an electrical conducting [[catalyst]] supporting an [[electrochemical reaction]] between the liquid and the gaseous phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s10008-003-0402-z |title=A technique is described for production of a gas diffusion electrode by electrophoresis|year=2003|last1=Furuya|first1=Nagakazu|journal=Journal of Solid State Electrochemistry|volume=8|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principle==
GDEs are used in [[fuel cells]], where [[oxygen]] and [[hydrogen]] react at the gas diffusion electrodes, to form water, while converting the [[chemical bond]] energy into [[electrical energy]]. Usually the catalyst is fixed in a porous foil, so that the liquid and the gas can interact. Besides these [[wetting]] characteristics, the gas diffusion electrode must, of course, offer an optimal [[electric conductivity]], in order to enable an [[electron]] transport with low [[Electrical resistance|ohmic resistance]].

An important prerequisite for the operation of gas [[diffusion]] electrodes is that both the liquid and the gaseous phase coexist in the pore system of the electrodes which can be demonstrated with the [[Young-Laplace equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt; p= \frac {2\ \gamma \cos \theta} {r}&lt;/math&gt;

The gas pressure p is in relation with the liquid in the pore system over the pore radius r, the surface tension γ of the liquid and the contact angle Θ. This equation is to be taken as a guide for determination because there are too many unknown, or difficult to achieve, parameters. When the surface tension is considered, the difference in surface tension of the solid and the liquid have to be taken into account. But the surface tension of catalysts such as [[platinum]] on [[carbon]] or [[silver]] are hardly measurable. The contact angle on a flat surface can be determined with a [[microscope]]. A single pore, however, cannot be examined so it is necessary to determine the pore system of an entire electrode. Thus in order to create an electrode area for liquid and gas, the path can be chosen to create different pore radius r, or to create different wetting angles Θ.

==Sintered electrode==
[[Image:sinterelektrode.jpg|200px|thumb|Sintered electrode]]
In this image of a [[sintered]] electrode it can be seen that three different grain sizes were used. The different layers were:
# top layer of fine-grained material
# layer from different groups
# gas distribution layer of coarse-grained material
Most of the electrodes that were manufactured from 1950 to 1970 with the sintered method were for use in fuel cells. This type of production was dropped for economic reasons because the electrodes were thick and heavy, with a common thickness of 2&amp;nbsp;mm, while the individual layers had to be very thin and without defects. The sales price was too high and the electrodes could not be produced continuously.

===Principle of operation===
[[Image:Januselektrode.jpg|thumb|200px|Principle of the gas diffusion electrode]]
The principle of gas diffusion is illustrated in this diagram. The so-called gas distribution layer is located in the middle of the electrode. With only a small gas pressure, the electrolyte is displaced from this pore system. A small flow resistance ensures that the gas can freely flow inside the electrode. At a slightly higher gas pressure the electrolyte in the pore system is restricted to the work layer. &lt;!-- this sentence HAS BEEN clarified but is it correct? --&gt; The surface layer itself has such fine pores that, even when the pressure peaks, gas cannot &lt;!--this seems to follow from the logic of the description--&gt; flow through the electrode into the electrolyte. Such electrodes were produced by [[scattering]] and subsequent sintering or [[hot pressing]]. To produce multi-layered electrodes a fine-grained material was scattered in a [[Molding (process)|mold]] and smoothed. Then, the other materials were applied in multiple layers and put under pressure. The production was not only error-prone but also time consuming and difficult to automate.

==Bonded electrode==
[[Image:SilFlon REM.jpg|thumb|[[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]]-image from the PTFE-silver electrode]]
Since about 1970, [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|PTFE]]s are used to produce an electrode having both [[hydrophilic]] and [[hydrophobic]] properties while chemically stable and which can be used as binders. This means that, in places with a high proportion of PTFE, no electrolyte can penetrate the pore system and vice versa. In that case the catalyst itself should be non-hydrophobic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://perso.ensem.inpl-nancy.fr/Olivier.Lottin/FDFC08/Bidault.pdf |title=A new cathode design for alkaline fuel cells |page=7 |author=Bidault, F. |format=PDF |work=Imperial College London |accessdate=2013-04-19 |display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720233739/http://perso.ensem.inpl-nancy.fr/Olivier.Lottin/FDFC08/Bidault.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variations===
There are two technical variations to produce PTFE catalyst-mixtures:
* Dispersion of water, PTFE, catalyst, emulsifiers, thickening agents...
* Dry mixture of PTFE powder and catalyst powder

The dispersion route is chosen mainly for electrodes with [[polymer]] electrolytes, as successfully introduced in the [[Proton exchange membrane fuel cell|PEM fuel cell]] and in [[Proton exchange membrane|PEM]] or [[Hydrochloric acid|HCL]] membrane [[electrolysis]]. When used in liquid [[electrolyte]], a dry process is more appropriate. 

Also, in the dispersion route (through evaporation of water and sintering of the PTFEs at 340°C) the mechanical pressing is skipped and the produced electrodes are very porous.  With fast drying methods, cracks can form in the electrodes which can be penetrated by the liquid electrolyte. For applications with liquid electrolytes, such as the [[zinc-air battery]] or the alkaline fuel cell, the dry mixture method is used.

==Catalyst==
Last, but not least, the right choice of catalyst is important too. In acidic electrolytes the [[Electrocatalyst|catalyst]]s are usually precious metals like [[platinum]], [[ruthenium]], [[iridium]] and [[rhodium]]. In alkaline electrolytes, like zinc-air batteries and [[alkaline fuel cell]]s, it is usual to use less expensive catalysts like [[carbon]], [[manganese]], [[silver]], [[nickel foam]] or [[nickel]] [[mesh]].

== Application ==
At first solid electrodes were used in the [[Grove cell]], [[Francis Thomas Bacon]] was the first to use gas diffusion electrodes for the [[Alkaline fuel cell|Bacon fuel cell]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071121142103/http://chem.ch.huji.ac.il/history/bacon.html Francis Thomas (Tom) Bacon]. chem.ch.huji.ac.il&lt;/ref&gt; converting [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]]  at high temperature into electricity. Over the years, gas diffusion electrodes have been adapted for various other processes like: 

* [[Zinc-air battery]] since 1980
* [[Nickel-metal hydride battery]] since 1990
* [[Chlorine]] production by electrolysis of waste hydrochloric acid &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s10800-005-9063-1 |title=Recovery of chlorine from dilute hydrochloric acid by electrolysis using a chlorine resistant anion exchange membrane|year=2005|last1=Barmashenko|first1=V.|last2=Jörissen|first2=J.|journal=Journal of Applied Electrochemistry|volume=35|issue=12|pages=1311 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Chloralkali process]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1023/A:1025899204203 |title=Accelerated degradation testing of gas diffusion electrodes for the chlor-alkali process|year=2003|last1=Sugiyama|first1=M.|last2=Saiki|first2=K.|last3=Sakata|first3=A.|last4=Aikawa|first4=H.|last5=Furuya|first5=N.|journal=Journal of Applied Electrochemistry|volume=33|issue=10|pages=929 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years the use of gas diffusion electrodes for electrochemical [[carbon dioxide]] reduction is a strongly growing research topic.&lt;ref&gt; doi:10.1021/jz1012627 |J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2010, 1, 3451–3458 &lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==
GDE is produced at all levels. It is not only used for research and development firms but for larger companies as well in the production of a [[Membrane Electrode Assembly]] (MEA) that is in most cases used in a fuel cell or battery apparatus.  Companies that specialize in high volume production of GDE include Johnson Matthey, Gore and [[Gaskatel]].  However, there are many companies which produce custom or low quantity GDE, allowing different shapes, catalysts and loadings to be evaluated as well, which include FuelCellStore, FuelCellsEtc, and many others.

The '''hair rig''' is a piece of [[fishing tackle]] which allows a [[Fishing bait|bait]] to be presented without sitting directly on the [[Fishing hook|hook]]. It is mainly associated with [[boilies]], but also works effectively with many other baits. The hair rig became popular in the 1970s. It has been experimented with by English anglers, and has revolutionised [[carp]] fishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|title=Fishing Tips for Freshwater: Over 500 Ways to Improve Your Fishing Skills|author=Stackpole Books|year= 2003|isbn=0-8117-2654-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning, natural wire (from a ponytail) was used to link the bait to the hook. This is why it was called the 'hair rig'. This material was very discreet but it was a little fragile. The bait also didn't act in a sufficiently natural manner. In tests, the [[carp]] only took the free offerings and left the hook bait. It was also a problem because anglers sometimes lost their baits while they were casting.  These problems have been solved with the appearance of [[Braided fishing line|braided thread]], a new material that allows threads to be as discreet as natural ones but more resistant.

Developed by [[Northrop Grumman]], the '''Integrated Meteorological System''' (AN/TMQ-40 '''IMETS)''' is the meteorological component of the Intelligence and Electronic Warfare (IEW) an element of the Army Battle Command System (ABCS). IMETS provides Army commanders at all echelons with an automated weather system to receive, process, and disseminate weather observations, forecasts, and weather and environmental effects decision aids to all Battlefield Operating Systems (BOS). IMETS is a mobile, tactical, automated weather data receiving, processing and dissemination system. The IMETS is an Army-furnished and maintained system operated by US Air Force battlefield weather team personnel. It uses US Air Force and Army developed software to provide a total weather system to support the Army. The [[Integrated Weather Effects Decision Aid]] (IWEDA) software, originally developed by the [[U.S. Army Research Laboratory]] (ARL) in 1992, has been fielded on IMETS since 1997 to provide tactical weather support to the U.S. Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Szymber |first1=Richard J . |title=Quantitative Weather Impacts: An Integrated Weather Effects Decision Aid Impact Magnitude Gradation Scheme and Friendly Versus Threat Delta Advantage |url=https://www.arl.army.mil/arlreports/2013/ARL-TR-6539.pdf |website=www.arl.army.mil/ |publisher=Army Research Laboratory |accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IMETS is a heavy [[Humvee]] mounted tactical system which provides automation and communications support to staff weather teams assigned to echelons from brigade through Echelons Above Corps (EAC). IMETS receives weather information from polar-orbiting civilian and defense meteorological satellites, Air Force Global Weather Center, artillery meteorological teams, remote sensors and civilian forecast centers. IMETS processes and collates forecasts, observations, and climatological data to produce timely and accurate weather products tailored to the specific Warfighter’s needs.

IMETS provides automation and communications support to USAF Weather Teams assigned to Army G2/G3 sections at echelons Brigade through EAC. IMETS receives, processes, and collates forecasts, observations, and climatological data to produce weather forecasts and timely and accurate products to meet Commanders' requirements. IMETS produces displays and disseminates, over Army ABCS, weather forecasts and tactical decision aids that compare the impact of current, projected, or hypothesized weather conditions on friendly and enemy capabilities.

==Variations==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:IMETS-Light.jpg|thumb|right|150px|''IMETS Light'']] --&gt;
The IMETS currently fielded is in two configurations. They are the vehicle-mounted configuration (VMC), IMETS-Heavy, and the laptop version, the IMETS-Light. The IMETS-Light is the most common version; US Army uses IMETS-Light for aviation brigades and brigade combat teams.  Both configurations have identical intelligence processing capabilities. The IMETS-Light has recently passed the Milestone C review and its production and fielding have official authorization. Both configurations of IMETS operate with ABCS Version 6.X-complaint software.

==Training==
IMETS training is accomplished at Staff Weather Officer (SWO) Course at [[Fort Huachuca]], Arizona. SWO training is four weeks long, IMETS portion being half of that.  This is somewhat ironic, as IMETS has not been used much since the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq began.

==Units with IMETS==
The following units use IMETS:
* 1st Cavalry, Fort Hood, Texas
* III Corps, Fort Hood, Texas
* 101 Air Assault Division, Fort Campbell, Kentucky

==My Weather Impacts Decision Aid==
As of 2018, '''My Weather Impacts Decision Aid (MyWIDA)''', a [[Decision support software|decision-support software]], was developed by the [[U.S. Army Research Laboratory]] (ARL).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.arl.army.mil/www/default.cfm?article=1416|title=MyWIDA helps solve complexities of battlespace weather|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h0ouDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT151&amp;lpg=PT151&amp;dq=mywida+army&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xP7brmz4ta&amp;sig=j5Q2zAR69eCrdVKcUB0Zrd6MBq8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjpy-Hf5Y3dAhWHt1MKHeAjC4c4ChDoATADegQIBxAB#v=onepage&amp;q=mywida%20army&amp;f=false|title=Military Quantitative Physiology: Problems and Concepts in Military Operational Medicine: Problems and Concepts in Military Operational Medicine|last=Institute|first=Borden|last2=General|first2=Office of the Surgeon|last3=Lenhart|first3=Martha K.|date=2017-07-26|publisher=Government Printing Office|isbn=9780160939112|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designed to improve compatibility of technology with environmental factors through weather forecasting, MyWIDA is an updated version of the Integrated Weather Effects Decision Aid (IWEDA), which the Army fielded in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G8wIcWpgq4wC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=mywida&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MARFPd5Ttn&amp;sig=h1Kco1yPnypSij5YYuifpftdFf0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiqjJDIhYjcAhUEu1MKHVspCko4ChDoAQhEMAY#v=onepage&amp;q=mywida&amp;f=false|title=History of U.S. Army Research Laboratory|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MyWIDA uses weather forecast data to evaluate environmental impacts on military technology, aiding decision-makers in selecting appropriate technological tools under forecasted weather events.  An example is surface winds greater than 25 knots, which prohibit launching of [[unmanned aerial vehicles]] (UAVs) in a military scenario. The user would be alerted of this physical limitation through the MyWIDA software.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The system includes red-amber-green ratings (unfavorable-marginal-favorable), which account for a combination of weather parameters that affect a system or technology. These ratings determine limits beyond which it is not feasible for the technology function due to safety considerations, decreased system effectiveness or violation of manufacturer's operating limits.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

MyWida was preceded by Integrated Weather Effects Decision Aid (IWEDA), an automated software decision aid developed by ARL in 1992.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.arl.army.mil/arlreports/2011/ARL-TR-5570.pdf|title=An Integrated Weather Effects Decision Aid Parameter Weighting Scheme|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

IWEDA was fielded on the Integrated Meteorological System (IMETS) in 1997 to provide tactical weather support to the U.S. IWEDA software was certified and accredited for the Army in 2006. As of 2011, the web-based MYWIDA was under development for eventual replacement of IWEDA.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

IWEDA was designed to address the adverse effects of the environment and climate (i.e. wind, precipitation, storms and temperature) on military operations and weapon systems. IWEDA produced a graphic display of weather impacts on 70 weapon systems, including 16 threat systems. Impacts were displayed graphically on a user interface, called the Weather Effects Matrix (WEM), which color coded the impacts on the system of interest (i.e. green “favorable,” amber “marginal,” and red “unfavorable”). Although intended for the Army, applications were also integrated into the Air Force and Navy systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.878.8661&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title=The Integrated Weather Effects Decision Aid: A Common Software Tool to Assist in Command and Control Decision Making|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, observations have identified varying needs for IWEDA’s improvement. These included (1) a need to derive complete mission impact due to poor weather conditions, rather than simply presenting a “worst-case scenario” for specific weapon systems; and (2) a need to improve representation of IWEDA’s “stoplight” color scheme (green, yellow and red) by providing more color-coded values.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a588633.pdf|title=Quantitative Weather Impacts: An Integrated Weather Effects Decision Aid Impact Magnitude Gradation Scheme and Friendly Versus Threat Delta Advantage|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''AR platform''' has become widely popular for makers of military and sporting rifles. Although the designations "[[AR-10]]" and "[[AR-15]]" are trademarks of [[Colt's Manufacturing Company]], variants of both are made by many manufacturers.

Examples include:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9654">A '''Local information system''' ('''LIS''') is a form of [[information system]] built with [[business intelligence tools]], designed primarily to support geographic [[report]]ing. They overlap with some capabilities of [[geographic information system]]s (GIS), although their primary function is the reporting of [[statistical data]] rather than the analysis of [[geospatial data]]. LIS also tend to offer some common [[knowledge management]] functionality for storage and retrieval of [[unstructured data]] such as documents. They deliver functionality to load, store, analyse and present statistical data that has a strong geographic reference. In most cases the data is structured as indicators and is linked to discrete geographic areas, for example population figures for [[County (United States)|US counties]] or numbers claiming [[unemployment benefit]] across [[Ward (country subdivision)|wards]] in [[England]]. The ability to present this data using data visualization tools like charts and maps is also a core feature of these systems.

The term "LIS" has emerged since 2004, primarily in the [[UK public sector]]. To date it is not widely used elsewhere although other terms like '''Community Information Systems''' apply to solutions, primarily in North America, that have a great deal of overlap. Another widely used and largely synonymous term is '''Data Observatory'''. Data Observatory is a more widely used term internationally particularly within the area of public health where sites which often include this type of statistical reporting application are often termed a [[health observatory]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apho.org.uk/ Association of Public Health Observatories]&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary application for LIS is to provide a place-focused evidence base that is easily accessible to a wide range of users including data experts, managers, policy makers, front-line staff and citizens. They provide a wide range of statistics and reports allowing users to review the current evidence base and build a picture of localities and neighbourhoods for their area of interest. LIS are commonly used by partnerships where they need to come together to provide joined-up services for a common area. The ability to have a common evidence base and a platform to share sensitive and non-sensitive data is critical in this situation. LIS enables partners to publish a wide range of indicators in the form of defined outputs which combine locally and nationally available data into more meaningful intelligence aimed at specific user groups

== Background ==

In the UK, like many other countries, there has been a rapid growth in the availability of small area statistics. National [[Neighbourhood Statistics]] projects across the UK, set up as a result of the PAT 18 report,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/cabinetoffice/social_exclusion_task_force/assets/publications_1997_to_2006/pat_report_18.pdf Cabinet Office PAT 18 Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703112129/http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/cabinetoffice/social_exclusion_task_force/assets/publications_1997_to_2006/pat_report_18.pdf |date=2009-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have opened up access to a wide range of government small area based statistics. This has been accompanied by a gradual shift across the public sector, a shift that remains very much on-going, towards the recognition that policy and decisions should be influenced to a greater degree by evidence. There also continues to be a growing acceptance that some services can be more effectively delivered by targeting resources at specific areas of need − the idea of high demand 'hotspots'. This relies on having reliable and detailed data about the needs of customers, in this case citizens, and where they live, work and take leisure time. 

In England in particular this has led to a rapid increase in the number of Local Information Systems particularly within local Authorities and Local Strategic Partnerships. This development has been actively supported by the Department of Communities and Local Government (CLG) under their ‘Neighbourhood Renewal’ agenda. A national research project was funded to identify examples and disseminate best practice – this reported publicly in 2004 and led to a more formal report&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/communities/localinformationsystems Local Information Systems: A review of their role, characteristics and benefits] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815070807/http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/communities/localinformationsystems |date=2009-08-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; being published in 2006. CLG’s role as a catalyst in this area is further re-enforced through its provision of Neighbourhood Renewal Funds (NRF) - this funding was used by a number of authorities to pump-prime their initial LIS developments.

An initiative is currently on-going through the CLG Information Management Programme to coordinate all LIS activity across local government and partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esd.org.uk/esdtoolkit/Communities/LIS/ContentView.aspx?ContentType=Content-287 CLG LIS Resources Home page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625045528/http://www.esd.org.uk/esdtoolkit/Communities/LIS/ContentView.aspx?ContentType=Content-287 |date=2009-06-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to regular national LIS meetings and a dedicated LIS forum. To date it is estimated that approximately 50 per cent of top tier authorities in England now have some form of LIS. In some cases these have been built as bespoke solutions, in other cases they are based on off-the-shelf products. Elsewhere within the UK this figure is lower although an initiative has been launched in Scotland in 2009 resulting in a Scottish LIS Toolkit&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.improvementservice.org.uk/resources/toolkits/ Improvement Service LIS Toolkit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914234626/http://www.improvementservice.org.uk/resources/toolkits/ |date=2009-09-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to complement the English version.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esd.org.uk/esdtoolkit/Communities/LIS/ContentView.aspx?ContentType=Content-372 CLG LIS Toolkit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208162003/http://www.esd.org.uk/esdtoolkit/Communities/LIS/ContentView.aspx?ContentType=Content-372 |date=2008-12-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Data ==
The range of data managed within a LIS can be wide and classified in many different ways. Most common is some form of domain specific classification where indicators are grouped into top level categories like ‘Demography’, ‘Health and Welfare’, ‘Crime and Community Safety’, ‘Education and Children's Services’, ‘Environment’ and ‘Economy’. There may also be cross-cutting themes such as ‘Performance’ and ‘Social Disadvantage’. In the UK key government data sources include ONS Neighbourhood Statistics, CLG, Dept for Work and Pensions, NOMIS, Audit Commission and several areas of NHS information services. However the real value of LIS is their ability to combine national data with local data available from a wide range of internal business systems including those of partners. This local data is often not provided to central government and, even when it is, it tends to be in a form that limits its value.

Buckland studied journalism at [[Rhodes University]] in the Eastern Cape, South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poynter.org/author/mattattakk/ Matthew Buckland, Poynter.(accessed 16 January 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt; He worked in London for the BBC's then-commercial web arm, beeb.com as a developer, and then a web development producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.news24.com/SciTech/Tech4Africa/Speakers/Matthew-Buckland-20100803|title=BIO: Matthew Buckland|work=News24|access-date=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then later worked as the Internet editor for prime-time TV show, [[Carte Blanche (TV series)|Carte Blanche]], before becoming Managing Director of [[Mail &amp; Guardian]]'s online division. He is the eldest son of [[Andrew Buckland]] and [[Janet Buckland]], a prominent South African acting family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bdlive.co.za/articles/2010/12/07/on-the-stage---andrew-buckland''On the stage - ANDREW BUCKLAND, BDFM, 2010'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.co.za/tonight/news/local/buckland-s-got-a-play-date-with-obsession-1.1836759#.VlsMoHYrJZk''Buckland's got a play date with obsession, IOL, 2015'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.capetown.gov.za/en/smartcape/Peopleofnote/pages/smartcapestd.aspx?pid=701''People of note - Women of Inspiration - Community Buckland Janet'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mg.co.za/article/2010-06-14-200-young-south-africans-arts-and-culture''200 Young South Africans: Arts and Culture'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Entrepreneurship ==
In 2010 Buckland founded Creative Spark&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/16/45272.html''Matthew Buckland to pursue creative spark']&lt;/ref&gt; and Burn Media, which he funded himself after being unable to raise venture capital for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mg.co.za/multimedia/2015-01-27-extraordinary-life-elon-musk|title=Extraordinary life: Elon Musk|website=The M&amp;G Online|language=en|access-date=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later, in 2015, he sold a majority share in his company to the FTSE-listed agency, [[M&amp;C Saatchi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://memeburn.com/2015/11/breaking-mc-saatchi-plc-acquires-independent-digital-player-creative-spark/''Breaking: M&amp;C Saatchi PLC acquires independent digital player Creative Spark'']&lt;/ref&gt; The deal included the sale of both the digital agency and the publishing arm, which owns titles such as [[Memeburn]] and Ventureburn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techcentral.co.za/creative-spark-sold-to-mc-saatchi/61639/''Creative Spark sold to M&amp;C Saatchi'']&lt;/ref&gt; He later retook control of the publishing arm when exiting his former company in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/23/178048.html''Burn Media to embark on aggressive growth after deal to go solo - Buckland'']&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.ventureburn.com Ventureburn] is a site that reports on the startup, entrepreneur and investor ecosystems in South Africa, Kenya and Nigeria.

'''OneClass''' is an online [[educational technology]] platform where university students share notes and access resources.

== History ==
In September 2010, the precursor to OneClass, called ''Notesolution'', was founded by four undergraduate students from the [[University of Toronto]] as a way to provide students with additional learning resources in the form of course notes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-strategy/ed-tech-sector-is-booming/|title=Ed-tech sector is booming|last=|first=|date=2012-10-29|work=Canadian Business - Your Source For Business News|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One year later in October 2011, Notesolution acquired StudyMonkey, a competitor with a similar note-sharing platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techvibes.com/2011/10/25/toronto-startup-notesolution-acquires-waterloo-startup-studymonkeys-note-sharing-service-2011-10-25|title=Toronto startup Notesolution Acquires Waterloo Startup StudyMonkey’s Note-sharing Service|website=Techvibes|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notesolution raised $400,000 in 2012 and participated in FounderFuel’s Accelerator Program in [[Montreal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/21/oneclass-raises-1-6m-to-expand-its-note-collaboration-platform-beyond-post-secondary/|title=OneClass Raises $1.6M To Expand Its Note Collaboration Platform Beyond Post-Secondary|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techvibes.com/2012/05/25/founderfuel-demo-day-spring-2012-which-are-the-most-promising-tech-startups-2012-05-25|title=FounderFuel Demo Day Spring 2012: Which are the most promising tech startups?|website=Techvibes|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 OneClass raised $1.6M from a [[Series A round|Series A]] led by [[SAIF Partners]], Real Ventures, and several other angel investors&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/10/21/oneclass-takes-1-6m-to-apply-the-jerry-maguire-strategy-to-college/|title=OneClass takes $1.6M to apply the Jerry Maguire strategy to college|date=2013-10-21|work=VentureBeat|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; totaling $2.3M in funding over three rounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/oneclass#section-locked-marketplace|title=OneClass {{!}} Crunchbase|website=Crunchbase|language=en|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, OneClass co-founders were named in [[Forbes 30 Under 30]] list for leaders in education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/30-under-30/2018/education/#6e2fb5437523|title=30 Under 30 2018: Education|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018, OneClass has over 11 million pages of study documents, and has been used by more than 2.2 million students in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/oneclass/#3dc2fc062402|title=OneClass|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept ==
OneClass uses a [[freemium]] model where users can contribute learning material by uploading notes and study documents in exchange for site currency, or “credits.” Users can use credits to unlock other documents on the site for viewing or downloading, or use the credits to purchase gift cards. Alternatively, users can choose to pay for a subscription.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bigthink.com/disrupt-education/the-economics-of-note-sharing|title=The Economics of Note Sharing|date=2011-08-09|work=Big Think|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, OneClass offers an app where users can ask questions and get help from other students and tutors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://download.cnet.com/Solvit-Homework-Help-for-Math-Chemistry-Physics/3000-20415_4-77664956.html|title=Solvit - Homework Help for Math,Chemistry,Physics|website=Download.com|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
Opinions are mixed about the concept of students sharing study content such as lecture notes and exam study guides. Some students, such as [[University of Saskatchewan|University of Saskatchewan Students]]' Union VP academic Kelsey Topola, say that notes are students' [[intellectual property]], and they can share them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thesheaf.com/2011/11/16/the-days-of-emailing-the-whole-class-for-notes-are-over/|title=The days of emailing the whole class for notes are over – The Sheaf – The University of Saskatchewan Newspaper Since 1912|website=thesheaf.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are others such as Professor Camille Hernandez-Ramdwar of [[Ryerson University]] who points out that students who post their notes may not have the correct interpretation of the material, which can result in a problem for other students.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ryersonian.ca/the-note-sharing-site-oneclass-allows-students-to-share-test-solutions-and-lecture-notes-online-for-credits/|title=Profs nervous after finding lecture notes online {{!}} Ryersonian.ca|website=ryersonian.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November and December of 2012, [[Red Bull]] and OneClass (Notesolution) provided Canadian students with Exam Survival Kits that included more than 20,000 cans of Red Bull. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202072501/http://www.canadianfreestuff.com/free-exam-survival-kit-for-studentsincludes-4-pk-redbull-and-study-guides-freebies-canada/|title=Free Exam Survival Kit For Students(Includes 4-pk Redbull And Study Guides)-Freebies Canada {{!}} Canadian Freebies, Coupons, Sweepstakes ~ Canadianfreestuff.com|date=2013-02-02|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''PC power management''' refers to the mechanism for controlling the power use of [[personal computer hardware]].  This is typically through the use of software that puts the hardware into the lowest power demand state available.  It is an aspect of [[Green computing]].

A typical office PC might use on the order of 90 watts when active (approximately 50 watts for the base unit, and 40 watts for a typical LCD screen); and three to four watts when ‘asleep’. Up to 10% of a modern office’s electricity demand might be due to PCs and monitors.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Sleepless of Seattle; Why Windows Power Management Doesn't Always Work, Mark Blackburn, Strategy Analyst, 1E, January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

While some PCs allow low power settings, there are many situations, especially in a networked environment, where processes running on the computer will prevent the low power settings from taking effect.  This can have a dramatic effect on energy use that is invisible to the user. The monitor may have gone into standby mode, and the PC may appear to be idle, but operational testing has shown that on any given day an average of over 50% of an organisation's computers would fail to go to sleep, and over time this happened to over 90% of the machines.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Windows 'Insomnia' (Sleepless PCs) ==
The Windows power management system is based upon an idle timer. If the computer is idle for longer than the preset timeout then the PC may be configured to sleep or hibernate. The user may configure the timeout using the Control Panel. Windows uses a combination of user activity and CPU activity to determine when the computer is idle.

Applications can temporarily inhibit this timer by using the ''SetThreadExecutionState'' API.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa373208(VS.85).aspx |title= SetThreadExecutionState Function |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=7 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are legitimate reasons why this may be necessary such as burning a DVD or playing a video. However, in many cases applications can unnecessarily prevent power management from working. This is commonly known as Windows 'Insomnia' and can be a significant barrier to successfully implementing power management.

Common causes of 'insomnia' include:

* Legacy or non-power management aware applications
* Open file handles on remote computers
* Faulty mice which can cause pointer drift. This makes the operating system believe that a user is present
* Scheduled maintenance tasks causing significant CPU activity
* High network activity

== Software solutions ==

'''PicoSAT''', launched on September 30, 2001, is a real time tracking satellite. The name "PICO" combines the first letters of all four of its experiments (see below). PICOSat series are designed for a minimum of one year of on-orbit operations.

==Background==
The name Picosat was coined by Peter P. Vekinis and was used to describe a constellation of [[amateur radio satellite]]s, called the Picosat System, first analog, then digital, that would offer instant emergency communications, worldwide, using cheap amateur radio transceivers. The details were presented at AMSAT's conference in Orlando, Florida, in 1995 and in Tucson, Arizona, in 1996.

==History==

===Early versions===
Tethered Picosats, Picosat 5, Picosat 6, Picosat 7, and Picosat 8 are hectogram mass satellites that were ejected from OPAL (2000-004C). The primary builders were by engineering students at [[Santa Clara University]] in California. They used off-the-shelf components and miniature batteries, for technology tests. The Tethered Picosats were a pair of Picosats tethered together by a short wire, was ejected on February 8, 2000, from an [[OPAL Launch System]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssdl.stanford.edu/opal/LaunchVehicle.html Stanford University: Opal Launch Vehicle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828224425/http://ssdl.stanford.edu/opal/LaunchVehicle.html |date=2008-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Picosats 7 and 8 on launched on 11 February, and Picosats 5 and 6 launched on 12 February. Alternate common names were given by the investigators: Picosats 7 and 8 are the Thelma and Louise pair and Picosats 5 and 6 are the JAK and Stensat pair. The Tethered Picosats were functional for a short time after ejection, communicating with each other by microwatt radio transmitters. There was no indication if the Picosats (5, 6, 7,and 8) were operational at the time of ejection into orbit. [[USSPACECOM]]'s Picosat numbers extending to eight is erroneous. There were only six Picosats on board the OPAL, with possibly one or two still on the ground, with tests to communicate with the orbiters. The tests were managed by the [[Defense Advanced Research Project Agency]] (DARPA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/masterCatalog.do?sc=2000-004H NASA:Master Catalog 2000-004H]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current version===
The current Picosat 9 is a British-built (US DOD-funded) microsatellite (67&amp;nbsp;kg) to test electronic components/systems in space conditions. Oboard this model carries four test payloads: [[Polymer Battery Experiment]] (PBEX), [[Ionospheric Occultation Experiment]] (IOX), [[Coherent Electromagnetic Radio Tomography]] (CERTO) and [[On Orbit Mission Control]] (OOMC) an ultra-quiet platform (OPPEX).  PICOSat flies in an 800&amp;nbsp;km circular orbit with a 67 degree inclination. PICOSat uses a [[Gravity-gradient stabilization|gravity gradient boom]] for stabilization. The body mounted solar panels produce an average on orbit power of 22 W. The Ultra-Quiet Platform (UQP), developed by the [[Air Force|US Air Force]] Research Lab, aims to provide a 10:1 reduction in vibration isolation over a 100&amp;nbsp;Hz bandwidth between the spacecraft bus and a science payload.&lt;ref name="NASA"&gt;[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/masterCatalog.do?sc=2001-043B NASA: Master Catalog of satellites]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Privatization''' is a technique used in [[Shared memory programming|shared-memory programming]] to enable [[Parallelism (computing)|parallelism]], by removing dependencies that occur across different [[Thread (computing)|threads]] in a [[Parallel programming model|parallel program]]. Dependencies within threads occur due to the presence of variables that are written and/or read by different threads at the same time during execution. This basic principle of this technique is making private copies of a variable shared by multiple threads, hence making each thread capable to operate on its local copy of this variable rather than a shared one.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For a variable to be shared or private, is specified by the parallel algorithm. Hence, declaring a variable as shared while the algorithm specifies otherwise or vice versa is one of most common errors that might appear in shared-memory programming.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Traditional compilers used in parallelization were able to perform privatization on scalar elements only. In order to exploit parallelism that occurs across loops within a parallel program ([[loop-level parallelism]]), the need rose for compilers that are able to perform array variable privatization as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gupta|first=M.|date=1997-04-01|title=On privatization of variables for data-parallel execution|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/580952/|journal=Parallel Processing Symposium, 1997. Proceedings., 11th International|pages=533–541|doi=10.1109/IPPS.1997.580952}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, most of today's compilers are capable of performing array privatization with more features and functions to enhance the performance of the parallel program in general. An example of such compiler is the Polaris parallelizing compiler &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Description ==
''A Shared-Memory Multiprocessor'' is defined as "A computer system composed of multiple independent processors that execute different instruction streams".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-0-387-09766-4_142|title=Encyclopedia of Parallel Computing|last=Ceze|first=Luis H.|date=2011-01-01|publisher=Springer US|isbn=9780387097657|editor-last=Padua|editor-first=David|pages=1810–1812|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-09766-4_142}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Parallel programming model#Shared memory|Shared memory programming]] model is the major and most widely used model in the design space of Shared-Memory [[Multiprocessing|Multiprocessors]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of Parallel Multicore Architecture|last=Solihin|first=Yan|publisher=Chapman and Hall/CRC|year=2015|isbn=9781482211184|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This programming model starts with the identification of parallelism within a piece of code (recognition of parallel tasks) and then mapping these tasks into threads.

The next step is Determining the Scope of Variables used in a parallel program, which is one of the key steps and main concerns within this model.

=== Determining the Scope of Variables ===
As mentioned before, after the programming model identifies all parallel tasks within our parallel program, the next step would be grouping these tasks into bigger tasks, as there typically would be more tasks than the available processors within our system. Typically, the number of execution threads that the tasks are assigned to, is chosen to be less than or equal to the number of processors, with each thread assigned to a unique processor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Right after this step, the use of variables within our identified parallel tasks need to be analyzed. This step determines whether each variable within the parallel task should be shared-by-all or private-to-each thread (Determining the scope of the variable).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is important to note that this particular step is unique to shared-memory programming, as opposed to the other major programming model ([[Message passing in computer clusters|message-passing]]), in which all variables are private since each process has its own address space.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to their behavior, the variables are then categorized into:

'''''Read-Only:''''' when a variable is only read by all the parallel tasks.

'''''Read/Write Non-conflicting:''''' when a variable is read, written, or both by only one task. In the case when the variable is a matrix, different elements are read/written by different parallel tasks.

'''''Read/Write Conflicting'':''' when a variable is written by a task and may be read by another. If the variable is a matrix or array, different elements are read/written by different parallel tasks.

As it appears from their definition, Read/Write Conflicting variables result in dependencies across different execution threads and hence prevent the [[Automatic parallelization|parallelization]] of the program. The two major techniques used to remove these dependencies are '''''Privatization''''' and '''''[[Reduction (complexity)|Reduction]].'''''  In ''Reduction,'' each thread is provided with a copy of the R/W conflicting variable to operate on it and produce a partial result, which will then be combined with other threads' copies to produce a global result.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another technique similar to Privatization is called '''''Expansion''''', in which a scalar variable is expanded into an array, which makes each thread access a different array element when trying to access the variable.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-0-387-09766-4_197|title=Encyclopedia of Parallel Computing|last=Padua|first=David|date=2011-01-01|publisher=Springer US|year=|isbn=9780387097657|editor-last=Padua|editor-first=David|location=|pages=1442–1450 - Paraphrased by Bruce Leasure.|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-09766-4_197|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the variable to be expanded is already a matrix, then expansion adds another dimension to the matrix.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-57659-2_29|title=Languages and Compilers for Parallel Computing|last=Tu|first=Peng|last2=Padua|first2=David|date=1993-08-12|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783540576594|editor-last=Banerjee|editor-first=Utpal|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|pages=500–521|language=en|doi=10.1007/3-540-57659-2_29|editor-last2=Gelernter|editor-first2=David|editor-last3=Nicolau|editor-first3=Alex|editor-last4=Padua|editor-first4=David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Privatization ===
As it was previously mentioned, dependencies or conflicts between different threads during execution stops parallelization, and these conflicts appear when we have read/write conflicting variables. One technique to remove this conflict is '''Privatization'''. As the name suggests, the basic principle involves making (Private) copies for each thread to operate on, rather than the shared copy that causes the conflict. Hence, changing the type of the variable from Read/Write conflicting to Read/Write Non conflicting.

The actual local (private) copies of the read/write conflicting variable are created during compile time, by compiling the variable into several variables stored at different memory locations. The architecture of shared-memory multiprocessors aids in this process as threads can address any memory location by default.

There are two situations in which a variable can be described as '''"Privatizable":'''

The first situation is when the variable is (written) before it's being (read) by the parallel task during the original program's sequential order. In this case, if the task wrote to its (private) copy rather than the shared one, the conflict/dependency will be removed. The reason for this is that the program's sequential order will ensures that the value read by the task will be the one written by the same task; removing any conflicts that might occur due to other threads accessing the same variable. This is more explained in the following '''Example 1'''.

In the second situation, the read happens before the write for the variable within the parallel task, but the difference here is that the value the parallel task is trying to read is a value previously know from the program execution. Taking this note into consideration, if each parallel task wrote to its own private copy of the variable, any conflicts or dependencies will be solved during execution, as they would all read a value known ahead of time and them write their correct values on their own copies. This case is more explained in the following '''Example 2'''.

Due to the fact that read/write conflicting variables are the only reason to hold parallelization, there is no actual need to declare (read-only) and (read/write non-conflicting) variables as private. However, doing so, won’t affect the correctness of the program, but will add unnecessary memory overhead.

=== Cases where Privatization and Reduction doesn't apply  ===
There are cases when a certain variable can’t be privatized nor reduced to remove the read/write conflict. In these cases, the read/write conflicting variable need to be updated by different tasks at different points of time. An example of this case is explained in '''Example 3.'''

One way to solve this problem, is changing the scope of parallelism to explore a different parallel region. This technique might produce good results, as it's often that after reanalyzing the code, some read/write conflicting variables may change to read/write non-conflicting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; If the variable still causes conflicts among different threads, the last resort will be declaring it as shared and protecting its access by the [[critical section]], and providing [[Synchronization (computer science)|synchronization]] if accesses to the variable need to happen in order to ensure the correctness..

=== Scalar vs. Array Variables Privatization ===
As it appears from the previous variables’ definitions, the Read/Write Conflicting variables can either be scalars or arrays. Hence, Privatization can be applied on both types of variables.

When applied to scalar variables, the additional space and overhead introduced by making the extra private copies per threads is relatively small.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, applying privatization on array elements is much more complex.

When dealing with arrays, the compiler tries to analyze the behavior of each array element separately and check for the order it's (read) and/or (written). If each element is being (written to) before it's being (read) in the same loop iteration, then this array can be privatized to remove conflicts and enable privatization. To be able to privatize such array, the compiler needs to further analyze the array to combine its accesses into sections. Moreover, the compiler should have extra functions, to be able to manipulate and deal with the array elements. For example, some array expressions may have symbolic terms, hence, to be able to privatize such array, the compiler needs to have some advanced [[Symbolic computation|symbolic manipulation functions]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Examples ==

=== Example 1 ===
There are several situations in which it is appropriate to privatize a variable.  The first case is when each thread will write to the variable before reading from it.  In this case, it does not matter what the other threads are doing because the current thread always writes to the variable before reading (using) it.  See the simple example below in which the variable "x" is used as a "temp" variable to help swaps 3 different pair of variables.  Because variable x is always written to before being used, variable x can be privatized.

&lt;pre&gt;
//Sequential Code:
//Swap Function
//Assume the variables have already been initialized
x = a;
a = b;
b = x;

x = c;
c = d;
d = x;

x = e;
e = f;
b = x;
&lt;/pre&gt;
The block above is the sequential code.  Notice that without privatizing the variable "x", the code could not be parallelized.  The code below shows what is possible by parallelizing "x". The code can be split up and run on 3 different threads.  Each thread has its own copy of "x".  
&lt;pre&gt;
//Parallel Code:
//Swap Function
//Assume the variables have already been initialized

Thread 1:
x = a;
a = b;
b = x;

Thread 2:
x' = c;
c = d;
d = x’;

Thread 3:
x'’ = e;
e = f;
b = x''
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Example 2 ===
Another case in which privatization is possible is when a variables value is known before it is used – even if it is not redefined by the same thread.  The example below demonstrates this.  The variable "x" is redefined in the middle of each thread, however, the value that it is redefined as is known when the program was written.  By making "x" private and defining it at the beginning of each thread, the code can be run in parallel.  The example below first shows the sequential code and then how it can parallelized with the help of privatization.

&lt;pre&gt;
//Sequential Code:
//Assume the variables have already been declared
x = 1;
y = x * 3;
x = 4;
z = y/x;

a = x * 9;
x = 3;
b = a/x;

c = x * 1;
x = 11;
d = c/x;

&lt;/pre&gt;

Notice that in order to make the sequential code above parallel, a few extra lines of code had to be added so that "x" could be privatized.  Because of this, this example may not actually see much of a speed up.  However, in larger/longer examples this technique could help improve performance a lot.

&lt;pre&gt;
//Parallel Code:
//Assume the variables have already been declared
x = 1;
y = x * 3;
x = 4;
z = y/x;

x’ = 4;
a = x’ * 9;
x’ = 3;
b = a/x’;

x’’ = 3;
c = x’’ * 1;
x’’ = 11;
d = c/x’’;
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Example 3 ===
One example when privatization fails is when a value is written in one task and read in another and the value is not known ahead of time.  Take this example of summing an array.  The sum is a shared variable and is read/written in each iteration of the loop.  In sequential code, this works fine.  However, if you try to parallelize  the loops (each loop a different thread), then the wrong sum would be calculated.  In this case, privatization does not work.  You cannot privatize the sum because they each rely on each other.  While there are techniques to still parallelize  this code, simple privatization does not work.

&lt;pre&gt;
//Sequential Code:
//Assume the variables have already been declared

sum = 0;
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
    sum = sum + a[i];
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Privatization in Open MP ==
[[OpenMP]] is a programming language that supports multiprocessor programming with shared memory.  Because of this, read/write conflicting variables will undoubtedly occur.  In these cases, '''''Privatization''''' can sometimes be used to allow parallel execution of the code.  The example below shows 2 different examples of code.  The first example is the original code written sequentially.  This example includes a dependence which would normally prevent the code to be run in parallel.  The second example, shows the code parallelized and the privatization technique used to remove the dependence.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://lib.mdp.ac.id/ebook/Karya%20Umum/Parallel_Programming_in_OpenMP.pdf|last=Chandra|first=Rohit|date=2001|publisher=[[Morgan Kaufmann]]|year=|isbn=1-55860-671-8|editor-last=Penrose|editor-first=Denise|location=|pages=48,74,143.|language=en|title = Parallel Programming in OpenMP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
//Sequential Code:
//Assume the variables have already been initialized
  do i = 10, N - 1
       x = (b(i) + c(i))/2
       b(i) = a(i + 1) + x
  enddo
&lt;/pre&gt;
For each iteration of the loop above, x is assigned and then read.  Because x is only a single variable, the loop cannot be executed in parallel because it would constantly be overwritten and b(i) would not always be assigned the correct value.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
//Parallel Code:
//Assume the variables have already been initialized
  !$omp parallel do shared(a, b) private(x)
  do i = 10, N - 1
       x = (b(i) + c(i))/2
       b(i) = a(i + 1) + x
  enddo
&lt;/pre&gt; 
For the parallel code, x is declared as private which means each thread gets its own copy and the dependence is therefore removed.

== Comparison with Other Techniques ==
Normally, when a variable is read/write conflicting, the solution will be declaring it as shared and protecting access to it by the critical section, and providing synchronization when needed. Due to the fact that adding more elements into the critical section decreases the overall system performance, this technique is avoided as much as possible.

Thus, the variable is checked if it can be reduced first. If it can’t be reduced, the variable is checked for Privatization, taken into consideration whether it's more tolerable to add the extra private copies or serialize access to the variable through the critical section.

When compared with '''Reduction''', privatization requires one task instead of two separate tasks in the case of privatization. This task, in an abstract form, is basically analyzing the code to identify the privatizable variables. On the other hand, the two tasks required by Reduction are: identifying the reduction variable, and then parallelizing the reduction operator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yu|first=Hao|last2=Rauchwerger|first2=Lawrence|date=2014-01-01|title=Adaptive Reduction Parallelization Techniques|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2591635.2667180|journal=ACM International Conference on Supercomputing 25th Anniversary Volume|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=311–322|doi=10.1145/2591635.2667180|isbn=9781450328401}}&lt;/ref&gt; By observing each of the two techniques, it's easy tell what type of overhead each one adds to the parallel program; reduction increases the computation overhead while privatization increases the memory consumed by the program.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

When compared to '''Expansion''', the difference here is that expansion produces more memory overhead. The reason for this is that the memory space needed for privatization is proportional to the number of processors, while in expansion, it's proportional to the number of loop iterations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; As it was previously mentioned, the number of tasks is typically higher than the number of processors available, which makes memory required here much larger than what is required for privatization.

As previously mentioned, changing the scope of parallelism to explore a different parallel region is also one of the techniques used to enable parallelization. Changing the scope in which the parallel tasks are identified might sometimes greatly change the behavior of the variables. Hence, reanalyzing the code and performing this technique may often change read/write conflicting variables into non-conflicting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A '''roof garden''' is a [[garden]] on the [[roof]] of a building.  Besides the decorative benefit, roof plantings may provide food, temperature control, hydrological benefits, architectural enhancement, habitats or corridors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Louise Lundberg Scandinavian Green Roof Institute |title=The benefits of Rooftop Gardens |year=2009 |url=http://www.spin-project.eu/downloads/14Scandinavian_Green_Roofs_InstituteLouise_Lundberg.pdf |accessdate=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; for wildlife, recreational opportunities, and in large scale it may even have ecological benefits. The practice of cultivating food on the rooftop of buildings is sometimes referred to as '''[[urban agriculture|rooftop farming]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/12/brooklyn-grange-_n_4775605.html |title=

==History==
Humans have grown [[plants]] atop structures since the [[ziggurats]] of ancient [[Mesopotamia]] (4th millennium BC–600 BC) had plantings of trees and shrubs on aboveground terraces.  An example in [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times was the [[Villa of the Mysteries]] in [[Pompeii]], which had an elevated terrace where plants were grown.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 112–115, chapter 2, "Roof gardens through history", ''Roof gardens: history, design, and construction'', Theodore Osmundson, W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1999, {{ISBN|0-393-73012-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;	 A roof garden has also been discovered around an audience hall in Roman-Byzantine [[Caesarea]].&lt;ref&gt;p. 219, ''Byzantine garden culture'', Antony Robert Littlewood, Henry Maguire, and Joachim Wolschke-Bulmahn, Dumbarton Oaks, 2002, {{ISBN|0-88402-280-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[History of Arab Egypt|medieval Egyptian]] city of [[Fustat]] had a number of [[high-rise]] buildings that [[Nasir Khusraw]] in the early 11th century described as rising up to 14 stories, with roof gardens on the top story complete with ox-drawn [[water wheel]]s for irrigating them.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Islamic Architecture in Cairo|first=Doris|last=Behrens-Abouseif|year=1992|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|isbn=90-04-09626-4|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]], The [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon|Hanging Gardens]] are often depicted as tall structures holding vegetation; even immense trees.

Roof gardens are most often found in [[urban environment]]s.  Plants have the ability to reduce the overall heat absorption of the building which then reduces energy consumption.  "The primary cause of heat build-up in cities is [[insolation]], the absorption of solar radiation by roads and buildings in the city and the storage of this heat in the building material and its subsequent re-radiation. Plant surfaces however, as a result of transpiration, do not rise more than 4–5 °C above the ambient and are sometimes cooler."&lt;ref name="Ong, B. 2003"&gt;Ong, B.  (2003).  Green plot ratio: an ecological measure for architecture and urban planning.  ''Landscape and Urban Planning'', 63 (4).  Retrieved June 19, 2009, from ScienceDirect database.&lt;/ref&gt; This then translates into a cooling of the environment between 3.6 and 11.3 degrees Celsius (6.5 and 20.3&amp;nbsp;°F), depending on the area on earth (in hotter areas, the environmental temperature will cool more). The study was performed by the University of Cardiff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12710-green-roofs-could-cool-warming-cities.html |title=Cooling percentages by 'Green roofs' |author=Catherine Brahic |publisher=[[New Scientist]] |date=September 28, 2007 |accessdate=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study at the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council of Canada]] showed the differences between roofs with gardens and roofs without gardens against temperature.  The study shows temperature effects on different layers of each roof at different times of the day.  Roof gardens are obviously very beneficial in reducing the effects of temperature against roofs without gardens.  “If widely adopted, rooftop gardens could reduce the urban heat island, which would decrease smog episodes, problems associated with heat stress and further lower energy consumption.”&lt;ref name="Liu, K"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Liu, K. |publisher=National Research Council Canada |url=http://sustainabletechnologies.ca/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/NRC_OttawaGRrept.pdf |title=Energy efficiency and environmental benefits of rooftop gardens |accessdate=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;gallery&gt;

File:Rain_runoff.JPG
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Aside from rooftop gardens providing resistance to thermal radiation, rooftop gardens are also beneficial in reducing rain run off.  A roof garden can delay run off; reduce the rate and volume of run off.  “As cities grow, permeable substrates are replaced by impervious structures such as buildings and paved roads. Storm water run-off and combined sewage overflow events are now major problems for many cities in North America. A key solution is to reduce peak flow by delaying (e.g., control flow drain on roofs) or retaining run-off (e.g., rain detention basins). Rooftop gardens can delay peak flow and retain the run-off for later use by the plants.”&lt;ref name="Liu, K" /&gt;

==Urban agriculture==
{{Main|Urban Agriculture}}
[[File:Un jardin sur le toit, Palais de Tokyo, Paris 2013.jpg|thumbnail|Palais de Tokyo, Paris]]
“In an accessible rooftop garden, space becomes available for localized small-scale urban agriculture, a source of local food production. An urban garden can supplement the diets of the community it feeds with fresh produce and provide a tangible tie to food production.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Trent University |title=Rooftop Gardens |date=October 30, 2009 |url=http://www.trentu.ca/eab/documents/Rooftop_Gardens-Zipple.pdf |accessdate=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Trent University]], there is currently a working rooftop garden which provides food to the student café and local citizens.

Available gardening areas in cities are often seriously lacking, which is likely the key impetus for many roof gardens. The garden may be on the roof of an [[autonomous building]] which takes care of its own water and waste. [[Hydroponics]] and other alternative methods can expand the possibilities of roof top gardening by reducing, for example, the need for soil or its tremendous weight&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.projex.com.au/blog/what-to-consider-when-designing-and-building-your-own-rooftop-or-balcony-garden/|title=What to Consider When Designing and Building Your Own Rooftop or Balcony Garden - Projex Group|date=2017-11-17|work=Projex Group|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Plantings in containers are used extensively in roof top gardens. Planting in containers prevents added stress to the roof's waterproofing. One high-profile example of a building with a roof garden is Chicago City Hall.

For those who live in small apartments with little space, [[square foot gardening]], or (when even less space is available) [[green wall]]s (vertical gardening) can be a solution. These use much less space than traditional gardening (square foot gardening uses 20% of the space of conventional rows; ten times more produce can be generated from vertical gardens). These also encourage environmentally responsible practices, eliminating tilling, reducing or eliminating pesticides, and weeding, and encouraging the recycling of wastes through composting.

== Importance to urban planning ==
[[File:HotelAstorRooftopGarden.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hotel Astor]] roof garden, ca. 1904]]
Becoming green is a high priority for urban planners.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}  The environmental and aesthetic benefits to cities is the prime motivation.  It was calculated that the temperature in [[Tokyo]] could be lowered by 0.11–0.84&amp;nbsp;°C   if 50% of all available rooftop space were planted with greenery. This would lead to a savings of approximately 100 million yen &lt;ref name="Yuen, B 2005"&gt;Yuen, B, &amp; Wong, N.  (2005).  Resident perceptions and expectations of rooftop gardens in Singapore.  ''Landscape and Urban Planning'', 73 (4).  Retrieved June 19, 2009, from ScienceDirect database.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Singapore]] is active in green urban development.  "Roof gardens present possibilities for carrying the notions of nature and open space further in tall building development."&lt;ref name="Yuen, B 2005"/&gt; When surveyed, 80% of Singapore residents voted for more roof gardens to be implemented in the city's plans.  Recreational reasons, such as leisure and relaxation, beautifying the environment, and greenery and nature, received the most votes. Planting roof gardens on tops of building is a way to make cities more efficient.&lt;ref name="Yuen, B 2005"/&gt;

==Roof garden vs. green roof==
A roof garden can be distinguished from a [[green roof]], although the two terms are often used interchangeably. The term roof garden is well suited to roof spaces that incorporate recreation, entertaining, and provide additional outdoor living space for the building's residents. It may include planters, plants, dining and lounging furniture, outdoor structures such as pergolas and sheds, and automated irrigation and lighting systems.

Although they may provide aesthetic and recreational benefits a green roof is not necessarily designed for this purpose. A green roof may not provide any recreational space and be constructed with an emphasis towards improving the insulation or improving the overall energy efficiency and reducing the cooling and heating costs within a building.

Green roofs may be extensive or intensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zimmerman|first1=Greg|title=Extensive or Intensive? Green Roofs Explained|url=http://www.facilitiesnet.com/roofing/article/Extensive-or-Intensive-Green-Roofs-Explained-Facilities-Management-Roofing-Feature--10074|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The terms are used to describe the type of planting required.  The panels that comprise a green roof are generally no more than a few inches up to a foot in depth, since weight is an important factor when covering an entire roof surface. The plants that go into a green roof are usually [[sedum]] or other shallow-rooted plants that will tolerate the hot, dry, windy conditions that prevail on most rooftop gardens.  With a green roof, "the plants layer can shield off as much as 87% of solar radiation while a bare roof receives 100% direct exposure".&lt;ref&gt;Wong, N, Tay, S, Wong, R, Ong, C, &amp; Sia, A.  (2003).  Life cycle cost analysis of rooftop gardens in Singapore.  ''Building and Environment'', 38 (3).  Retrieved June 19, 2009, from ScienceDirect database.&lt;/ref&gt;

The planters on a roof garden may be designed for a variety of functions and vary greatly in depth to satisfy aesthetic and recreational purposes. These planters can hold a range of ornamental plants: anything from trees, shrubs, vines, or an assortment of flowers. As aesthetics and recreation are the priority they may not provide the environmental and energy benefits of a green roof.

==Science of gardening==
The related idea of a [[Living machines|living machine]] is based on the most basic cycle of gardening: using wastes ([[Biodegradable waste|organic waste]] and [[sewage]]), appropriately broken down, usually in some specialized container, on the [[soil]], and harvesting [[food]] which, when processed, generates [[biodegradable]] waste, and when eaten, generates sewage. In most of the world, this kind of very tight closed loop gardening is used, despite certain health risks if necessary precautions are not taken. [[Composting]] human or pet waste should achieve thermophilic conditions and age for at least a year before being used.

==In popular culture==
* American jazz singer [[Al Jarreau]] composed a song named "Roof Garden".
* [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon]] of the TV show ''[[The Simpsons]]'' has a roof top garden visited by Paul McCartney and his wife.
* In [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]]'s 1990 television miniseries ''[[House of Cards (UK TV series)|House of Cards]]'', the main character, [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Francis Urquhart]], murders journalist [[List of House of Cards trilogy characters|Mattie Storin]] by throwing her off of the [[Palace of Westminster]]'s rooftop garden.

'''Sevcon''' was an [[electrical engineering]] company based in [[Gateshead]] in the UK, that manufactured controls for [[electric vehicle]]s.

==History==
It was founded in 1961 as Sevcon Engineering Ltd. The company was formed to develop technology originated by Horace William Heyman (13 March 1912 - 4 September 1998), who had been Managing Director of [[Smith Electric Vehicles]] from 1949 until 1964. It was the largest manufacturer of electric vehicles in Europe.

His technology improved battery-life for frequent start-stop runs of electric vehicles at low speeds. There were always large electrical losses on starting an electric vehicle because of [[Joule heating|electrical resistances heating up]]. The technology allowed a 20% reduction in battery size for equivalent power, or increased battery length or power for a standard-sized battery.

An electric vehicle would have had resistances to [[Voltage drop|drop the voltage]] on the motor when starting, but this created heating. His technology employed [[PWM rectifier|semiconductor-controlled rectifier]]s, with a semiconductor oscillator, which provided pulses of electrical power to power the motor.

It won the Queen's Award to Industry in April 1970, and the [[Queen's Awards for Enterprise|Queen's Awards for Export]] in April 1975. A new factory opened in June 1970 at Gateshead.

===Worldwide===
It opened its first subsidiary in 1968 in Paris. In 1969 it was bought by Tech/Ops of the USA.

===Public company===
In 1988 it was listed on the USA stock exchange, then joined the [[NASDAQ Capital Market]] in 2009.

=== Acquisition and merger ===
In September 2017, following a period of rapid expansion, the company was purchased and merged with Borg Warner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://marketexclusive.com/sevcon-inc-nasdaqsev-files-an-8-k-termination-of-a-material-definitive-agreement/2017/09/|title=SEVCON, INC. (NASDAQ:SEV) Files An 8-K Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement - Market Exclusive|website=marketexclusive.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The head office is situated opposite the automotive centre of [[Gateshead College]]. It outsources much of the manufacture of its components to [[Key Tronic]] of the USA. A UK site manufactures [[film capacitor]]s.

Its competitors include [[Danaher Corporation|Danaher]]'s Motion division, and [[General Electric]]. In 2010 it spent around £3 million in research and development at Gateshead.

==Products==
It makes microprocessor controllers for electric vehicles.

A '''system in package''' ('''SiP''') or '''system-in-a-package''' is a number of [[integrated circuit]]s enclosed in a single [[chip carrier]] package. The SiP performs all or most of the functions of an [[electronic system]], and is typically used inside a [[mobile phone]], [[Portable media player|digital music player]], etc.&lt;ref&gt; By Pushkar Apte, W. R. Bottoms, William Chen and George Scalise, IEEE Spectrum. “[http://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/design/advanced-chip-packaging-satisfies-smartphone-needs Advanced Chip Packaging Satisfies Smartphone Needs].” February 8, 2011. Retrieved July 31, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[die (integrated circuit)|Die]]s containing integrated circuits may be stacked vertically on a [[Wafer (electronics)|substrate]].  They are internally connected by fine [[wire]]s that are bonded to the package.  Alternatively, with a [[flip chip]] technology, solder bumps are used to join stacked chips together.  Systems-in-package are like [[System on a chip|systems-on-chip]] (SoC) but less tightly integrated and not on a single [[Die (integrated circuit)|semiconductor die]]. 

SiP dies can be stacked vertically or [[Quilt packaging|tiled horizontally]], unlike less dense [[multi-chip module]]s, which place dies horizontally on a carrier.  SiP connects the dies with standard off-chip [[Wire bonding|wire bonds]] or solder bumps, unlike slightly denser [[three-dimensional integrated circuit]]s which connect stacked silicon dies with conductors running through the die.

Many different '''3-D packaging''' techniques have been developed for stacking many fairly standard chip dies into a compact area.&lt;ref&gt;By R. Wayne Johnson, Mark Strickland and David Gerke, NASA Electronic Parts and Packaging Program. “[http://nepp.nasa.gov/docuploads/EA7E7EA1-BD30-4DA4-BD615FEA1A7F5AE9/3D%20Packaging%20Report%20071805.pdf 3-D Packaging: A Technology Review].” June 23, 2005. Retrieved July 31, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example SiP can contain several chips&amp;mdash;such as a specialized [[Central processing unit|processor]], [[DRAM]], [[flash memory]]&amp;mdash;combined with [[passive components]]&amp;mdash;[[resistor]]s and [[capacitor]]s&amp;mdash;all mounted on the same [[Substrate (electronics)|substrate]]. This means that a complete functional unit can be built in a multi-chip package, so that few external components need to be added to make it work.  This is particularly valuable in space constrained environments like [[MP3 player|MP3 players]] and [[Mobile phone|mobile phones]] as it reduces the complexity of the [[printed circuit board]] and overall design.  Despite its benefits, this technique decreases the yield of fabrication since any defective chip in the package will result in a non-functional packaged integrated circuit, even if all other modules in that same package are functional.

SiP technology is primarily being driven by market trends in [[Wearable computer|wearables]], mobile devices and the [[internet of things]].  As the internet of things becomes more of a reality and less of a vision, there is innovation going on at the [[system on a chip]] and SiP level so that [[Microelectromechanical systems|microelectromechanical]] (MEMS) sensors can be integrated on a separate die and control the connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;By Ed Sperling, Semiconductor Engineering. “[http://semiengineering.com/why-packaging-matters/ Why Packaging Matters].” November 19, 2015. Retrieved March 16, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; 

SiP solutions may require multiple packaging technologies, such as [[flip chip]], [[wire bonding]], [[wafer-level packaging]] and more.&lt;ref&gt;By Tech Search International and Chip Scale Review Staff, Chip Scale Review. “[http://fbs.advantageinc.com/chipscale/may-jun_2016/#07/z Major OSATs positioned for growth opportunities in SiP].” May/June Issue.

The '''telautograph''', an [[analog (signal)|analog]] precursor to the modern [[fax]] machine, transmits electrical impulses recorded by [[potentiometer]]s at the sending station to [[servomechanism]]s attached to a [[pen]] at the receiving station, thus reproducing at the receiving station a drawing or signature made by the sender. It was the first such device to transmit drawings to a stationary sheet of paper; previous inventions in Europe had used rotating drums to make such transmissions.

The telautograph's invention is attributed to [[Elisha Gray]], who patented it on July&amp;nbsp;31, 1888. Gray's patent stated that the telautograph would allow "one to transmit his own handwriting to a distant point over a two-wire circuit." It was the first facsimile machine in which the stylus was controlled by horizontal and vertical bars.&lt;ref name="Wiley-IEEE"&gt;{{cite book|title=The worldwide history of telecommunications|publisher=Wiley-IEEE|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SnjGRDVIUL4C&amp;pg=PA151&amp;lpg=PA151&amp;dq=Telautograph+and+Elisha+Gray#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The telautograph was first publicly exhibited at the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] held in [[Chicago]].

[[File:Telautograph-1888 electronic writing device.png|thumb|left|Telautograph patent schema]]

While the patent schema's geometry implies vertical and horizontal coordinates, systems used in the 20th Century (and presumably before) had a different coordinate scheme, based on transmitting two angles.

In an 1888 interview in ''The Manufacturer &amp; Builder'' (Vol. 24: No. 4: pages 85–86) Gray made this statement:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elisha Gray Deserves Top Billing  In Brownsville History|publisher=Glenn Tunney|url=http://freepages.history.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~glenntunneycolumn/column309.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;By my invention you can sit down in your office in Chicago, take a pencil in your hand, write a message to me, and as your pencil moves, a pencil here in my laboratory moves simultaneously, and forms the same letters and words in the same way. What you write in Chicago is instantly reproduced here in fac-simile. You may write in any language, use a code or cipher, no matter, a fac-simile is produced here. If you want to draw a picture it is the same, the picture is reproduced here. The artist of your newspaper can, by this device, telegraph his pictures of a railway wreck or other occurrences just as a reporter telegraphs his description in words.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:PSM V14 D424 Elisha Gray.jpg|thumb|The inventor Elisha Gray]]By the end of the 19th century, the telautograph was modified by [[Foster Ritchie]]. Calling it the telewriter, Ritchie's version of the telautograph could be operated using a telephone line for simultaneous copying and speaking.&lt;ref name="Wiley-IEEE"/&gt;

The telautograph became very popular for the transmission of signatures over a distance, and in banks and large hospitals to ensure that doctors' orders and patient information were transmitted quickly and accurately.
Teleautograph systems were installed in a number of major railroad stations to relay hand-written reports of train movements from the [[interlocking tower]] to various parts of the station.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/owi2001017821/PP/ Chicago, Illinois.

[[File:PSM V44 D062 Sample work of telautograph.jpg|thumb|Sample work of telautograph]]
A Telautograph was used in 1911 to warn workers on the 10th floor about the [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire]] that had broken out two floors below.
An example of a Telautograph machine writing script can be seen in the 1956 movie [[Earth vs the Flying Saucers]] as the output device for the mechanical translator.

Telautograph Corporation changed its name several times. In 1971, it was acquired by Arden/Mayfair. In 1993, [[Danka Industries]] purchased the company and renamed it ''Danka/Omnifax''. In 1999, [[Xerox]] corporation purchased the company and called it the ''Omnifax division'', which has since been absorbed by the corporation.

"'''The Winter Market'''" is a science fiction short story written by [[William Gibson]] and published as part of his ''[[Burning Chrome (short story collection)|Burning Chrome]]'' short story collection. The story was commissioned in 1985 by ''[[Vancouver Magazine]]'', who stipulated that Gibson – who at the time was "unquestionably the leading Vancouver author on the international literary scene"&lt;ref name=delaney/&gt; – set it in the city (thereby making it unique among the author's works).&lt;ref name=vancouver/&gt;

The market of the title was modelled on that of [[Granville Island]], though in a state of bohemian decay.&lt;ref name=delaney/&gt; As the author commented in a 2007 blog post: "Vancouver's Granville Island, centered around Granville Island Market (produce and food fair) is a very successful (and pleasant) retrofit of an under-bridge urban island that previously was heavily industrial. When the story was written, the retrofit was recent, and I dirtied it up for requisite punky near-future effect."&lt;ref name=granville/&gt;

==Plot==
The story primarily concerns human relationships and their tenuous and problematic qualities by deploying the concept of technological [[immortality]], in which one's [[consciousness]] is separated from the body and "uploaded" into a supercomputer, where it continues to think and function on its own. Characters in the story are marked by a distinct failure to connect, while they express typical genre concerns regarding this type of theoretical [[mind transfer]]; whether or not the online consciousness really is the same individual, and whether or not it was moral to allow this to happen. In this particular tale, Lise's original body is defective and failing, partially due to a congenital disease, and partially due to [[drug abuse]]. Hence, the act of leaving behind the original physical form is potentially one of escape into an untainted existence. However, the story undercuts this simplistic reading by convincingly evoking Lise's humanity and her longing for a "normal" relationship to her body.

==Analysis==
[[File:Granville Island Market interior 01.jpg|thumb|A 2010 photograph of the interior of the [[Granville Island#Public market|Granville Island public market]], on which the market of the story's title is based]]
According to the analysis of critic Pramod Nayar, the story "depicts the body as a vehicle for experiencing dreams edited into Hollywood thrillers".&lt;ref name=nayar/&gt;

Critic David Seed saw the character of Rubin as a "thinly disguised" incarnation of performance artist [[Mark Pauline]] of [[Survival Research Laboratories]].&lt;ref name=seed/&gt;

==Reception==
The story was critically well-received, garnering nominations for the [[Hugo Award for Best Novelette]], the [[Nebula Award for Best Novelette]], the "short-form, English" [[Prix Aurora Awards|Prix Aurora]] award, and the [[BSFA Awards|British Science Fiction Association]] award for best short story. It also finished highly in several science fiction magazines' annual readers polls in 1987, coming fourth in the ''[[Locus Awards|Locus]]'' novelette category, third in the ''[[Interzone (magazine)|Interzone]]'' fiction category, and joint second in the ''Science Fiction Chronicle'' novelette category.&lt;ref name=locusindexresult/&gt;

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7362">'''Thin wall injection molding''' is a specialized form of conventional [[injection molding]] that focuses on [[Mass production|mass-producing]] plastic parts that are thin and light so that material [[Cost saving|cost savings]] can be made and [[Cycle time variation|cycle times]] can be as short as possible.  Shorter cycle times means higher [[productivity]] and lower costs per part.&lt;ref name="Evalene"&gt;[Evalene PHJ4501: Superior Material For Thin-Wall Injection Molding by Jums Belezza, JG Summit Petrochemical Corporation, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of thin wall is really about the size of the part compared to its wall thickness.  For any particular [[plastic]] part, as the wall thickness reduces the harder it is to manufacture using the injection molding process. The size of a part puts a limit on how thin the wall thickness can be. For packaging containers thin wall means wall thicknesses that are less than 0.025 inch (0.62mm) with a flow length to wall thickness greater than 200.&lt;ref name="Evalene" /&gt;

==Markets==
The trend towards thin wall molding continues to increase in many plastic industries as plastic material and energy costs continue to rise and delivery [[Lead time|lead times]] are squeezed.&lt;ref name="ConsumerProducts"&gt;[Consumer Products: Customer Demands for Thinner Walls and Lightweight Designs Pose Challenges for Moldmakers, Mold Making Technology Magazine, 6/20/2011]&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The following industries make use of thin wall molding: 
* [[food packaging]] ( e.g. food containers and lids)&lt;ref name="Thinwall"&gt;[Thin wall packaging users are seeking more from less by Chris Smith, Injection World Magazine, April 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Automotive industry|automotive]]  (e.g. both structural and non-structural car parts)&lt;ref name="LighteningUp"&gt;[Lightening Up The Auto Industry by Chris Smith, Injection World Magazine, June 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mobile telephony|mobile telecommunications]] (e.g. mobile phone housings)
* [[Medical supply|medical]] (e.g. syringes)&lt;ref name="Usingthin"&gt;[Using thin wall to create medical devices, by Clare Frissora and Greg Tremblay, Medical Device and Diagnostic Magazine, July 1, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Computer industry|computing equipment]] (e.g. computer housings)

== Benefits ==
* Cheap, safe and clean plastic parts.
* Thin wall molding reduces [[resource consumption]] and cuts weight, reducing fuel usage and [[carbon emissions]] in shipping – further supporting [[sustainability]] efforts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sabic-ip.com/gep/en/NewsRoom/PressReleaseDetail/april_02_2012_sabicsxenoyiq.html[SABIC’S XENOY IQ* RESIN HELPS CANON ELECTRONICS MEET GLOBAL CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR ECO-RESPONSIBLE PRODUCTS WITH NEW SCANNER HOUSING, PITTSFIELD,  Ma./ USA -- April 2, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Allows faster cycle times compared with thicker walled plastic parts. This is good for injection molders because it reduces their delivery lead time and cost per part.
* Lighter parts reduce fuel emissions in automotive applications.&lt;ref name="LighteningUp" /&gt; 
* Made from [[Plastic recycling|recyclable]] plastics such as [[polypropylene]] (PP) in food packaging.&lt;ref name="Thinwall" /&gt;
* Some thin wall parts can be made from sustainable plastics.&lt;ref name="ConsumerProducts" /&gt;

==Disadvantages==
*Environmental litter.
*High [[capital investment]] cost for injection molders. Thin wall molding requires specialized molding machines, injection molds and robots that can withstand the high stresses, fast cycle times and 24/7 production schedules.
*To make thin wall parts requires highly skilled molding technicians and these are difficult to find and keep.

==Examples==
Plastic resins suitable for thin-wall molding should have high-flow properties, particularly low melt [[viscosity]]. In addition, they need to be robust enough to avoid degradation from the heat generated by high [[Shear rate|shear rates]] (high injection speeds)&lt;ref name="Usingthin" /&gt;

Some plastic manufacturers make plastics specifically for thin wall applications that have excellent flow properties inside the mold cavity. For example, plastic manufacturer [[SABIC|Sabic]] has a polypropylene food contact grade plastic which is specifically designed for thin wall margarine containers and lids.&lt;ref&gt;[Stretching the limits in rigid packaging by Chris Smith, Injection world Magazine, March 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another plastic manufacturer, [[Bayer]], makes a blend of [[Polycarbonate]] (PC) and [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS)]] specifically designed to make thin wall mobile housings.&lt;ref name="BayerMaterials"&gt;[Bayer Materials Science, "Thin-wall technology in the mobile phone industry" ATI 978 d,e]01/03/1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equipment==
===Plastic injection molding machine===
Compared to conventional injection molding, thin wall molding requires molding machines that are designed and built to withstand higher stresses and injection pressures.  The molding machines computer control should also be precise in order to make quality parts. For this reason these molding machines are more expensive than general purpose machines. 

Thin-wall-capable machines usually also have accumulator-assisted clamps to accommodate fast cycle times.&lt;ref&gt;[Injection Moulding Pocketbook, Mannesmann Demag, Kunststofftecknik, p131]&lt;/ref&gt;

Regular maintenance schedules must be completed so that the machine and part quality does not suffer. These machines usually work 24/7 so they need to be well maintained.&lt;ref&gt;[The maintenance route to cost reduction by Jerry Claunch, Injection World Magazine, April 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Injection mold design===
As with the injection molding machines, injection molds need to be robust enough to withstand high stresses and pressures.&lt;ref name="Usingthin" /&gt; Heavy mold construction with through hardened tool steels will ensure a long lasting mold.

The mold must also have a well designed cooling system so that heat can be quickly extracted from the hot plastic part allowing fast cycle times. To achieve this, cooling channels need to be designed close to the molding surface.  
Cleaning the mould on a daily basis is also a critical requirement to maintain the part quality.

===Robotics===
In countries where manual labour is expensive, [[Robot|robots]] are commonly used to remove the plastic parts from the mold and order them into equal stacks. These robots are fixed to the molding machine and need to be fast and reliable.

==Plastic injection molding process==
The range of process parameters, which are employed for thin wall molded parts, is considerably narrower than that of conventional injection molding because thin parts are difficult for the injection unit of the machine to fill compared to thicker parts. Even with optimally designed parts and molds, it is still more difficult to produce parts with thin walls.&lt;ref name="BayerMaterials" /&gt;

Consistent injection speeds and pressures are required to maintain the quality of the parts produced from thin wall molding. A properly trained molding technician who understands and operates the machine within the confines of the narrow processing window at which the molded product's production cost-effectiveness is optimized will ensure that the process produces quality parts during the production.

'''''Trinity: A Graphic History of the First Atomic Bomb''''' is the debut graphic novel written and illustrated by Jonathan Fetter-Vorm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wayne|first=Teddy|title=Teddy Wayne: Interview with Jonathan Fetter-Vorm, Author of Trinity: A Graphic History of the First Atomic Bomb|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/teddy-wayne/interview-with-jonathan-f_b_1764616.html|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=August 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides an account of the [[Manhattan Project]] and the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], as well as mentioning the chain of events after. The title arises from the code-name, [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity]], given to the test site for the first nuclear weapon.

The book is written as a "work of history", although Fetter-Vorm writes at the end of the book "for the most part, the dialog from the principal characters in this book is taken from written records. When that was impossible, I introduced language that hews closely to what I have learned of these characters over the course of my research..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fetter-Vorm|first=Jonathan|title=Trinity: A Graphic History of the First Atomic Bomb|publisher=Hill and Wang|year=2012|ISBN=978-0-8090-9468-4|location=New York|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to provide a [[bibliography]] of the works he consulted in creating the book.

== Plot Summary ==
''Trinity'' begins with a conversation between a soldier named Private Daniels and [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] as they are entering [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] in [[New Mexico]]. Oppenheimer asks Daniels if he has ever heard of [[Prometheus]], and upon receiving a "No, sir", recounts the myth.

The novel then goes back in time to 1898, when the [[Marie Curie]] and [[Pierre Curie|her husband]] discover [[radioactivity]]. The story presents a brief timeline that continues up into the 1930s, when [[James Chadwick]] discovers [[neutrons]] and the discovery of [[nuclear fission]]. The novel takes a shift, and begins to discuss the political environment. [[Leo Szilard]] becomes troubled as he sees the dangers that these [[nuclear weapons]] could produce, and travels with [[Eugene Wigner]] to talk with [[Albert Einstein]] about the possibility of [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] scientists creating a bomb. News soon reaches the United States president, who authorizes the [[S-1 Uranium Committee|precursor to the Manhattan Project]]. After the [[bombing of Pearl Harbor]], the United States founds covertly Los Alamos National Laboratory and other cities to create nuclear weapons. The scientists and their families are sworn to secrecy. Soon, the scientists at Los Alamos discover how to create a [[nuclear chain reaction]], leading to the development of the first atomic weapons: [[Little Boy]] and [[Fat Man]].

Soon, the day of the Trinity test arrives, and [[Harry S. Truman|President Truman]] receives notice at the [[Potsdam Conference]] in [[Potsdam, Germany]]. Although it has ended in Europe, the war continues in the Pacific, with Japan refusing to surrender even after the [[bombing of Tokyo|aerial raid of Tokyo]]. The author briefly mentions history of warfare weapons, up to the new atomic bomb. Eventually, Truman authorizes the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|bombing of Hiroshima]]. The crew from [[Enola Gay]] is seen on their way to the skies over Hiroshima, and then drop the bomb. The book describes in detail what happens:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The effect was like this: The heat and the light hit before the sound. Now, in a world without sight or sound, a wave of air traveling at more than 800 miles per hour sweeps outwards in all directions. In its wake comes the earth-trembling roar of the atmosphere aflame. The blast is so hot that everything flammable within a few hundred yards of ground zero vaporizes in a flash of smoke. Then suddenly the air pressure spikes. Your eyes and your lungs bulge, swell, and burst. Your eardrums explode. In a few seconds the air pressure settles back to normal, and the wind slow...and then picks up speed in the opposite direction, sucking everything inward to the churning heart of the explosion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fetter-Vorm|first=Jonathan|title=Trinity: A Graphic History of the First Atomic Bomb|publisher=Hill and Wang|year=2012|ISBN=978-0-8090-9468-4|location=New York|pages=106–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The news of the bombing becomes worldwide. The Japanese still refuse to surrender. The US prepares to drop a bomb on the city of [[Kokura]], but cannot because of the weather; at the same time, there is not enough fuel to carry the bomb back to the US base in [[Tinian]]. As a result, the flight crew ends up [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropping the bomb on Nagasaki]].

The book cuts out to a scene of two children on their way home from school when the bomb drops and incinerates them. One of the boys is still alive, and walking around searching for water, as the view pans out to the carnage and death that resulted from the bombing. Japan ends up [[surrender of Japan|surrendering]].

In the aftermath, the survivors begin to be afflicted by a mysterious disease, called Disease X, which turns out to be [[acute radiation poisoning|radiation poisoning.]] The world now sees the possible results of [[nuclear warfare]], and the doctrine of [[mutually assured destruction]] arises. Nuclear weapons begin to proliferate. The public now prepares itself  as it enters into the new [[Atomic Age]].

== Reception ==
The book was published to generally positive reviews. Ray Olson, writing in ''[[Booklist]]'', praised the artwork and design, saying that "the page layouts are attractively busy and varied, never crowded and hard to read, while the text proceeds stepwise down each page, never courting confusion by running in circles or zigzagging...",&lt;ref name=BooklistRO&gt;{{cite journal |last=Olson|first=Ray|date=15 March 2012 |title=Trinity: A Graphic History of the First Atomic Bomb|journal=Booklist|volume=108|issue=14|pages=37|via=Academic Search Premier}}&lt;/ref&gt; and finishing by calling the book "exemplary".&lt;ref name=BooklistRO /&gt;

One reviewer, however, writing for ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', found the text confusing to follow and derided the marketing, along with book itself, because of "flat illustrations, heavy use of captions, and stiff, static panels of talking heads".&lt;ref name=PubWeeklyASP&gt;{{cite journal |year=2012|title=Trinity: A Graphic History of the First Atomic Bomb|journal=Publishers Weekly|volume=259|issue=5|pages=41|via=Academic Search Premier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7537">'''Video banking''' is a term used for performing banking transactions or professional banking consultations via a remote video connection.  Video banking can be performed via purpose built banking transaction machines (similar to an [[Automated teller machine]]), or via a [[videoconference]] enabled [[bank branch]].

== Types of Video Banking ==
Today, video banking has many forms, each with its own benefits and limitations.

=== In-branch ===
Video banking can be conducted in a traditional banking branch.&lt;ref&gt;Young (2009)[http://www.freep.com/article/20090516/BUSINESS06/905160325 "Metro Detroit among 1st in U.S. to get video banking"], Metro Detroit Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  This form of video banking replaces or partially displaces the traditional banking tellers to a location outside of the main banking branch area.  Via the video and audio link, the tellers are able to service the banking customer.  The customer in the branch uses a purpose built machine to process viable medias such as cheques, cash, or coins.

=== Time Convenience ===
Video banking can provide professional banking services to bank customers during nontraditional banking hours at convenient times such as in after hours banking branch vestibules that could be open up to 24 hours a day.&lt;ref&gt;Credit Union National Association, Inc. (2009): [http://www.cuna.org/newsnow/09/system050809-6.html "Coastal's new teller system increases branch traffic"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716135923/http://www.cuna.org/newsnow/09/system050809-6.html |date=July 16, 2011 }}, CUNA News Now 5/11/09.&lt;/ref&gt;  This gives bank customers the benefit of personal teller service during hours when bank branches are not typically open.

In addition, following Check 21, "cut off" times are typically later for Personal Teller Machines as physical checks do not need to be gathered and collected to be delivered to a separate check processing location.  Substitute checks, or digital images of the original check, can be utilized to process the transaction.  This can result in the typical 3PM business day "cut off" for a branch being extended well into the evening.  This could greatly benefit customers by making their funds available even sooner than visiting a branch teller window.

=== Location Convenience ===
Video banking can provide professional banking services in nontraditional banking locations such as after hours banking branch vestibules, grocery stores, office buildings, factories, or educational campuses.&lt;ref&gt;Credit Union Center (2008): [http://www.ailife.com/Main/forms/bluepapers/BP_Nov08.pdf "As A Recession Looms, Innovation Could Be Your Competitive Key"], The Blue Paper.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technology Branches ===
Video banking can enable banks to expand real-time availability of high-value banking consultative services in branches that might not otherwise have access to the banking expertise.&lt;ref&gt;Tandberg (2005): [http://www.banktech.com/whitepaper/Architecture/Infrastructure/transforming-branch-banking:-real-time-advice-in-wp9600003;jsessionid=GIRGEPA1SIUKYQSNDLPCKH0CJUNN2JVN "Transforming Branch Banking: Real-Time Advice in the 21st Century"], Bank Tech Digital Library. Tandberg (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Video Banking from anywhere===

Video Banking has now been taken to another level of convenience. [[IndusInd Bank]] from India, has recently launched an innovative functionality called Video Branch. Video Branch empowers the customer to do a Virtual yet Face- to-Face banking with his bank branch Manager or a Central video branch. This concept has brought banking virtually in the hands of the customer. The customer can engage with the bank for services and financial transactions by ‘meeting’ his bank Anytime, Anywhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IndusInd Bank launches Video Branch service for customers|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2014-06-02/news/50272707_1_bank-branch-bank-staff-customers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Customer can simply connect to the bank through an App on Android and Apple devices as well as through an application on the laptop/Desktop. So whether the customer is at his home or office or even travelling he will be able to set up a Video conference and experience instant banking services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IndusInd Bank launches video banking|url=http://businesstoday.intoday.in/story/indusind-bank-launches-video-banking/1/206849.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This facility is available to IndusInd Bank customers only

== Technology of Video Banking ==

[[File:Video Branch Machine.jpg|thumb|Example of a video banking solution that Tumsas Company launches]]

Although video banking has many different forms, they all have similar basic components.

=== Video Connection ===
Although termed video banking, the video connection is always accompanied by an audio link which ensures the customer and bank representative can communicate clearly with one another.  The communication link for that video and audio typically requires a high-speed data connection for applications where the tellers are not in the same physical location.  Various technologies are employed by the vendors of video banking, but recent advances in audio and video compression make the use of these technologies much more affordable.&lt;ref&gt;W&amp;WComms (2008): [http://www.wwcoms.com/company/aboutus.html "Video Communications - The Missing Link"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427012951/http://www.wwcoms.com/company/aboutus.html |date=April 27, 2009 }}, W&amp;W Communications company website.&lt;/ref&gt;  For an in depth discussion on [[videoconferencing]] technologies see wiki [[videoconferencing]] article.

Other than the deployment location, one of the major differences between video banking and [[videoconferencing]] is the ability to conduct banking transactions and exchange viable medias such as checks, cash, and coins.  Purpose built machines, such as a Personal Teller Machine (PTM), enable both the video / audio link to the customer plus the ability to accept and dispense viable medias.&lt;ref&gt;uGenius (2009): [http://www.ugenius.com "What is a uGenius PTM?"], uGenius Technology company website.&lt;/ref&gt;  The system typically allows the bank teller to manipulate the PTM machine to accept or dispense the cash and checks.

Purpose-built transaction equipment is currently available, but in the future these video banking systems will likely leverage existing [[automated teller machines]] which will be modified to enable the audio and video communication.

== Video Banking Services ==
Depending on the type of video banking solution deployed there are numerous types of services that can be offered.  In conjunction with transaction hardware video banking can include all of the following types of services.

*Customer authentication
*Cash Deposits
*Check Deposits
*Cash Withdrawal
*Coin Withdrawals
*Check Print
*Account Transfers
*Bill Payments
*Account inquiries
*Process New Accounts

With all types of video banking the following services are enabled:
*Process New Loans
*Consult with banking professionals
*Process New Accounts
*Inquire about banking services

'''Well control''' is the technique used in [[oil]] and [[natural gas|gas]] operations such as [[drilling]], well [[workover]], and well [[completion (oil and gas wells)|completions]] for maintaining the [[fluid]] column [[hydrostatic pressure]] and formation pressure to prevent [[:wikt:influx|influx]] of formation fluids into the [[wellbore]]. This technique involves the estimation of formation fluid pressures, the strength of the subsurface formations and the use of [[casing (borehole)|casing]] and mud [[density]] to offset those pressures in a predictable fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oilfield Glossary|url=http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=well%20control|work=Well Control|accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding of pressure and pressure relationships are very important in well control.

==Fluid Pressure==
Fluid is any [[Chemical substance|substance]] that flows; e.g. oil, water, gas, and ice are all examples of fluids. Under extreme pressure and temperature almost anything will become [[fluid]].
Fluid exerts pressure and this pressure is as a result of the density and the height of the fluid column. Most oil companies usually represent density measurement in pounds per gallon (ppg) or kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and pressure measurement in pounds per square inch (psi) or bar or pascal (Pa). Pressure increases as the density of the fluid increases.
To find out the amount of pressure a fluid of a known density exerts for each unit of length, the pressure gradient is used.
A pressure gradient is defined as the pressure increase per unit of the depth due to its density and it is usually measured in pounds per square inch per foot or bars per meter.It is expressed mathematically as;
''pressure gradient = fluid density × conversion factor''.
The conversion factor used to convert density to pressure is 0.052 in [[English Units|English system]] and 0.0981 in [[Metric system]].

==Hydrostatic pressure==
Hydro means water, or fluid, that exerts pressure and static means not moving or at rest. Therefore, hydrostatic pressure is the total fluid pressure created by the weight of a column of fluid, acting on any given point in a well.  In oil and gas operations, it is represented  mathematically as;
''Hydrostatic pressure = pressure gradient ×  true vertical depth'' '''or''' ''Hydrostatic pressure = fluid density × conversion factor × true vertical depth'' .

The figure (not shown) shows two wells, well X and Y. Well X has measured depth of 9800&amp;nbsp;ft and a true vertical depth of 9800&amp;nbsp;ft while well Y has  measured depth of 10380&amp;nbsp;ft and its true vertical depth is 9800&amp;nbsp;ft.To calculate the hydrostatic pressure of the bottomhole, the true vertical depth is used because gravity acts (pulls) vertically down the hole. The figure also illustrates the difference between true vertical depth (TVD) and measured depth (MD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=WCS guide to blowout prevention|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation pressure==
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oil Well Drilling Engineering|last=Rabia|first=Hussain|publisher=Springer|year=1986|isbn=0860106616|location=|pages=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Drilling Engineering|last=|first=|publisher=Heriot Watt university|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=Chater-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formation pressure is the pressure of the fluid within the pore spaces of the formation rock. This pressure  can  be  affected  by  the  weight  of  the overburden  (rock  layers)  above  the  formation, which  exerts  pressure  on  both  the  grains  and pore  fluids.  Grains  are  solid  or  rock  material, and  pores  are  spaces  between  grains.  If pore
fluids  are  free  to  move,  or  escape,  the  grains lose  some  of  their  support  and  move  closer together. This process is called consolidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=WCS guide to blowout prevention|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Depending on the magnitude of the pore pressure, it can be described as being normal, abnormal or subnormal.
'''Normal pore pressure''' or formation pressure is equal to the hydrostatic pressure of formation fluid extending from the surface to the surface formation being considered. In other words, if the formation was opened up and allowed to fill a column whose length is equal to the depth of the formation, then the pressure at the bottom of the column will be equal to the formation pressure and the pressure at surface is equal to zero.
Normal pore pressure is not a constant. Its magnitude varies with the concentration of dissolved salts, type of fluid, gases present and temperature gradient.

When  a  normally  pressured  formation  is raised toward the surface while prevented from losing pore fluid in the process, it will change from  normal  pressure  (at  a  greater  depth) to  abnormal  pressure  (at  a  shallower  depth). 
When  this  happens,  and  then  one  drill  into the  formation,  mud  weights  of  up  to  20  ppg (2397&amp;nbsp;kg/m  ³)  may  be  required  for  control. This process accounts for many of the shallow, abnormally pressured zones in the world. In areas where faulting is present, salt layers or domes are predicted, or excessive geothermal gradients are known, drilling operations may encounter abnormal pressure. 
'''Abnormal pore pressure''' is defined as any pore pressure that is greater than the hydrostatic pressure of the formation fluid occupying the pore space. It is sometimes called overpressure or geopressure. An  abnormally pressured  formation  can  often  be  predicted using  well  history,  surface  geology,  downhole logs or geophysical surveys.
'''Subnormal pore pressure''' is defined as any formation pressure that is less than the corresponding fluid hydrostatic pressure at a given depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rabia|first=Hussain|title=Well Engineering and Construction|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subnormally pressured formations have pressure   gradients   lower than fresh water or less than 0.433   psi/ft (0.0979 bar/m). Naturally  occurring  subnormal  pressure  can be  developed  when  the  overburden  has  been stripped  away,  leaving  the  formation  exposed at the surface.
Depletion of original pore fluids through evaporation, capillary action and dilution produces hydrostatic gradients below 0.433 psi/ft (0.0979 bar/m). Subnormal pressures may also be induced through depletion of formation fluids.
If Formation Pressure &lt; Hydrostatic pressure then it is under pressured. 
If Formation Pressure &gt; Hydrostatic pressure then it is over pressured .

==Fracture pressure==
Fracture pressure is the amount of pressure it takes to permanently deform the rock structure of a formation. Overcoming formation pressure is usually not sufficient to cause fracturing. If pore fluid is free to move, a slow rate of entry into the formation will not cause fractures. If pore fluid cannot move out of the way, fracturing and permanent deformation of the formation can occur. Fracture pressure can be expressed as a gradient (psi/ft), a fluid density equivalent (ppg), or by calculated total pressure at the formation (psi). Fracture gradients normally increase with depth due to increasing [[overburden pressure]]. Deep, highly compacted formations can require very high fracture pressures to overcome the existing formation pressure and resisting rock structure. Loosely compacted formations, such as those found offshore in deep water, can fracture at low gradients (a situation exacerbated by the fact that some of total "overburden" up the surface is sea water rather than the heavier rock that would be present in an otherwise-comparable land well). Fracture pressures at any given depth can vary widely because of the geology of the area.

==Bottom hole pressure==
Bottom hole pressure is used to represent the sum of all the pressures being exerted at the bottom of the hole.  Pressure is imposed on the walls of the hole. The  hydrostatic  fluid  column  accounts for most of the pressure, but pressure to move fluid up the annulus also acts on the walls. In larger diameters, this annular pressure is small, rarely exceeding 200 psi (13.79 bar). In smaller diameters it can be 400 psi (27.58 bar) or higher. Backpressure or pressure held on the choke also increases  bottomhole  pressure,  which  can  be estimated by adding up all the known pressures acting  in,  or  on,  the  annular  (casing)  side. Bottomhole pressure can be estimated during the following activities;

===Static well===
If no fluid is moving, the well is static. The bottomhole pressure (BHP) is equal to the hydrostatic pressure (HP) on the annular side. If shut in on a [[#Kick|kick]], bottomhole pressure  is equal to the hydrostatic pressure in the annulus plus the casing (wellhead or surface pressure) pressure.

===Normal circulation===
During circulation, the bottomhole pressure is  equal  to  the  hydrostatic  pressure  on  the annular  side  plus  the  annular  pressure  loss (APL).

===Rotating head===
During  circulating  with  a  rotating  head the   bottomhole   pressure   is   equal   to   the hydrostatic pressure on the annular side, plus the  annular  pressure  loss,  plus  the  rotating head backpressure.

===Circulating a kick out===
Bottomhole pressure is equal to hydrostatic pressure  on  the  annular  side,  plus  annular pressure loss, plus choke (casing) pressure. For subsea, add choke line pressure loss.

==Formation integrity test==
An  accurate  evaluation  of  a  casing cement  job  as  well  as  of  the  formation is extremely important during the drilling of  a  well  and  for  subsequent  work.  The Information   resulting   from   Formation Integrity Tests (FIT) is used throughout the life  of  the  well  and  also  for  nearby  wells. Casing depths, well control options, formation fracture pressures and limiting fluid weights may be based on this information. To determine the  strength  and  integrity  of  a  formation,  a Leak Off Test (LOT) or a Formation Integrity Test  (FIT)  may  be  performed. This test is first: a method of checking the cement seal between casing and the formation, and  second:  determining  the  pressure  and/or fluid  weight  the  test  zone  below  the  casing can sustain. Whichever test is performed, some general points should be observed.  The fluid in the well should be circulated clean to ensure it is of a known and consistent density. If mud is used for the test, it should be properly conditioned and gel strengths minimized.  The pump used should be a high-pressure, low-volume test or cementing pump. Rig pumps can be used if the rig  has  electric  drives  on  the  mud  pumps, and  they  can  be  slowly  rolled  over.  If the rig pump must be used and the pump cannot be easily controlled at low rates, then the leak-off technique must be modified. It is a good idea to make a graph of the pressure versus time or volume for all leak-off tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=WCS guide to blowout prevention|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main reasons for performing formation integrity test (FIT) are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rabia|first=Hussain|title=Well Engineering and Construction|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
* To investigate the strength of the cement bond around the casing shoe and to ensure that no communication is established with higher formations.
*To determine the fracture gradient around the casing shoe and therefore establish the upper limit of the primary well control for the open hole section below the current casing.
*To investigate well bore capability to withstand pressure below the casing shoe in order to validate or invalidate the well engineering plan regarding the casing shoe setting depth.

==U-tube concepts==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:U-tube.jpg|U-tube|right|thumb|300px|u-tube]] --&gt;
It is often helpful to visualize the well as a U-tube as in Figure beside. Column Y of the tube represents the annulus and column X represents the pipe (string) in the well. The bottom of the U-tube represents the bottom of the well. In  most  cases,  there  are  fluids  creating hydrostatic  pressures  in  both  the  pipe  and annulus. Atmospheric pressure can be omitted, since it works the same on both columns.  If the  fluid in both the  pipe  and  annulus are of the same density,  hydrostatic  pressures would  be  equal and  the  fluid  would  be  static on both sides of the tube. If the fluid in the annulus is heavier, it will exert more pressure downward and will flow into the string, displacing some of the lighter fluid out of the string causing a flow at surface. The fluid level will fall in the annulus, equalizing pressures. When  there  is  a  difference  in  the  hydrostatic  pressures,  the  fluid  will  try  to  reach balance  point.  This  is  called  U-tubing,  and it  explains  why  there  is  often  flow  from  the pipe  when  making  connections.  This is often evident when drilling fast because the effective density in the annulus is increased by cuttings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=WCS guide to blowout prevention|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equivalent circulating densities==
The Equivalent Circulating Density (ECD) is defined as the increase in density due to friction and it is normally expressed in pounds per gallon. Equivalent Circulating Density (when forward circulating) is defined as the apparent fluid density which results from adding annular friction to the actual fluid density in the well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=CHEVRON DRILLING REFERENCE SERIES VOLUME FIFTEEN|pages=B-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;ECD= MW+{ \frac{P_a}{0.052*TVD} }&lt;/math&gt; or ECD = MW +( p/1.4223*TVD(M)

Where;
ECD = Equivalent circulating density (ppg),
Pa = Difference between annular pressure at surface &amp; annular pressure at depth TVD (psi),
TVD = True vertical depth (ft),
MW = Mud weight (ppg)

When the drilling mud is under static condition(no circulation),Pressure at any point is only due to drilling mud weight and is given by:-

'''''Pressure under static condition= 0.052*Mud weight(in ppg)*TVD(in feet)'''''

During circulation, pressure applied is due to drilling mud weight and also due to the pressure applied by the mud pumps to circulate the drilling fluid.

'''''Pressure under circulating condition= Pressure under static condition+ Pressure due to pumping at that point or pressure loss in the system'''''

If we convert pressure under circulating condition in annulus to its density equivalent it will be called ECD

Dividing the above equation  by 0.052*TVD on both sides :-

'''''ECD= (Pressure under static condition + Annular pressure loss)/(0.052*TVD)'''''

'''''ECD=MW+ Annular pressure loss/(0.052*TVD) using (Pressure under static condition=0.052*TVD*MW)'''''

==Pipe surge/swab==
During trips (up/down) drill string acts as a large piston, when moving down it increases the pressure below the drill string and forces the drilling fluid into the formation which is termed as surge. Similarly while moving up there is low pressure zone created below the drill string which sucks the formation fluid into the wellbore which is called swab.

The total pressure acting on the wellbore is affected by pipe movement upwards or downwards.Tripping pipe into and out of a well is one other common operation during completions and workovers. Unfortunately, statistics indicate that most kicks occur during trips. Therefore, understanding the basic concepts of tripping is a major concern in completion/workover operations.
Downward movement of tubing(tripping in) creates a pressure that is exerted on the bottom of a well. As the tubing is being run into a well, the fluid in the well must move upward to exit the volume being entered by the tubing.The combination of the downward movement of the tubing and the upward movement of the fluid (or piston effect) results in an increase in pressure at any given point in the well. This increase in pressure is commonly called Surge pressure.
Upward movement of the tubing(tripping out) also affects the pressure which is imposed at the bottom of the well. When pulling pipe from the well, fluid must move downward and replace the volume which was occupied by the tubing. The net effect of the upward movement of the tubing and the downward movement of the fluid creates a decrease in bottomhole pressure. This decrease in pressure is referred to as Swab pressure.
Both surge and swab pressures are affected by the following parameters:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=CHEVRON DRILLING REFERENCE SERIES VOLUME FIFTEEN|pages=B-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Velocity of the pipe,or tripping speed
* Fluid density
* Fluid viscosity
* Fluid gel strength
* Well bore geometry (annular clearance between tools and casing, tubing open ended or closed off)

The faster pipe is tripped, the higher the surge and swab pressure effects will be. Also, the greater the fluid density, viscosity and gel strength, the greater the surge  and swab tendency. Finally, the downhole tools such as packers and scrapers,which have small annular clearance, also increase surge and swab pressure effects.
Determination of actual surge and swab pressures can be accomplished with the use of WORKPRO and DRILPRO calculator programs or hydraulics manuals.

==Differential pressure==
In well control,it is defined as the difference between the formation pressure and the bottomhole hydrostatic pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=WCS guide to blowout prevention|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are classified as overbalanced, underbalanced and balanced.

===Overbalanced differential pressure===
It means the hydrostatic pressure exerted on the bottom of the hole is greater than the formation pressure. i.e. HP &gt; FP

===Underbalanced differential pressure===
It means the hydrostatic pressure exerted on the bottom of the hole is less than the formation pressure. i.e. HP &lt; FP

===Balanced differential pressure===
It means the hydrostatic pressure exerted on the bottom of the hole is equal to the formation pressure. i.e. HP = FP

==Cuttings change: shape, size, amount, type==
Cuttings are rock fragments chipped, scraped or crushed away from a formation by the action of the bit. The size, shape and amount of cuttings depend largely on formation type, weight on the bit, bit dullness and the pressure differential (formation versus fluid hydrostatic pressures).
The size of the cuttings usually decreases as the bit dulls during drilling if weight on bit, formation type and the pressure differential, remain constant. However, if the pressure differential changes (formation pressure increase),even a dull bit could cut more effectively, and the size, shape and amount of cuttings could increase.

==Kick==
[[Image:Deepwater Horizon offshore drilling unit on fire 2010.jpg|right|thumb|[[Deepwater Horizon explosion|Deepwater Horizon drilling rig blowout]], 21 April 2010]]
Kick is defined as an undesirable influx of formation fluid into the [[wellbore]]. If left unchecked, a kick can develop into blowout (an uncontrolled influx of formation fluid in to the wellbore).The result of failing to control a kick leads to loss operation time, loss of well and quite possibly, the loss of the rig and lives of personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bybee|first=Karen|title=Roles of Managed-  Pressure-Drilling Technique in Kick De – tection and Wellcontrol—The Beginning  of the New Conventional Drilling Way|journal=SPE|year=2009|pages=57|url=http://www.spe.org/jpt/print/archives/2010/01/15WCFocus.pdf|accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Causes of kick===

Once the hydrostatic pressure is less than the formation pore pressure, formation fluid can flow into the well. This can happen when one or a combination of the following occurs;
*Improper hole fill up
*Insufficient Mud density
*Swabbing/Surging
*Lost circulation
*Abnormal formation pressure
*Gas cut mud
*Poor well planning

====Improper hole fill up====

When tripping out of the hole, the volume of the steel pipe being removed results in a corresponding decrease in wellbore fluid. Whenever the fluid level in the hole decreases, the hydrostatic pressure exerted by the fluid also decreases and if the decrease in hydrostatic pressure falls below the formation pore pressure, the well may flow. Therefore, the hole must be filled to maintain sufficient hydrostatic pressure to control formation pressure.
During tripping, the pipe could be dry or wet depending on the conditions. The API7G illustrates the methodology for calculating accurate pipe displacement and gives correct charts and tables.
To calculate the volume to fill the well when tripping dry pipe out is given as;

''Barrel to fill=pipe displacement(bbl/ft)  × length pulled (ft)''

To calculate the volume to fill the well when tripping wet pipe out is given as;

''Barrel to fill=( pipe displacement(bbls/ft)  + pipe capacity(bbls/ft) )×length pulled(ft)''

In some wells, monitoring fill –up volumes on trips can be complicated by loss through [[perforations]].The wells may stand full of fluid initially, but over a period of time the fluid seeps in to the [[reservoir]].In such wells, the fill up volume will always exceed the calculated or theoretical volume of the steel removed from the well.
In some fields, wells have low reservoir pressures and will not support a full column of fluid.In these wells filling the hole with fluid is essentially impossible unless sort of bridging agent is used to temporarily bridge off the subnormally pressured zone.The common practice is to pump the theoretical fill up volume while pulling out of the well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=CHEVRON DRILLING REFERENCE SERIES VOLUME FIFTEEN|pages=C-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Insufficient mud (fluid) density====

The mud in the wellbore must exert enough hydrostatic pressure to equal the formation pore pressure. If the fluid’s hydrostatic pressure is less than formation pressure the well can flow.The most common reason for insufficient fluid density is drilling into unexpected abnormally pressured formations. This situation usually arises when unpredicted geological conditions are encountered.  Such as drilling across a fault that abruptly changes the formation being drilled.
Mishandling mud at the surface accounts for many instances of insufficient fluid weight. Such as opening wrong valve on the pump suction manifold and allowing  a tank of light weight fluid to be pumped; bumping the water valve so more is added than intended; washing off shale shakers; or clean-up operations. All of these can affect mud weight.

====Swabbing /Surging====

Swabbing is as a result of the upward movement of pipe in a well and results in a decrease in  bottomhole pressure. In some cases, the bottomhole pressure reduction can be large enough to cause the well to go underbalanced and allow formation fluids to enter the wellbore. The initial swabbing action compounded by the reduction in hydrostatic pressure(from formation fluids entering the well) can lead to a significant reduction in bottomhole pressure and a larger influx of formation fluids. Therefore, early detection of swabbing on trips is critical to minimizing the size of a kick.
Many wellbore conditions increase the likelihood of swabbing on a trip. Swabbing (piston) action is enhanced when pipe is pulled too fast. Poor fluid properties, such as high viscosity and gel strengths, also increase the chances of swabbing a well in. Additionally, large outside diameter (OD) tools (packers, scrapers, fishing tools, etc.) enhance the piston effect.
These conditions need to be recognized in order to decrease the likelihood of swabbing a well in during completion/workover operations. As mentioned earlier, there are several computer and calculator programs that can estimate surge and swab pressures. Swabbing is detected by closely monitoring hole fill-up volumes during trips. For example, if three barrels of steel (tubing) are removed from the well and it takes only two barrels of fluid to fill the hole, then a one barrel kick has probably been swabbed into the wellbore. Special attention should be paid to hole fill-up volumes since statistics indicate that most kicks occur on trips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=CHEVRON DRILLING REFERENCE SERIES VOLUME FIFTEEN|pages=C-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lost circulation====

Another cause of kick during completion/workover operations is lost circulation. Loss of
circulation leads to a drop of both the fluid level and hydrostatic pressure in a well. If the
hydrostatic pressure falls below the reservoir pressure, the well kicks. Three main causes of lost circulation are:
* Excessive pressure overbalance
* Excessive surge pressure
* Poor formation integrity

====Abnormal pressure====

In case of drilling a wildcat or exploratory well(often the formation pressures are not known accurately) the bit suddenly penetrates into an abnormal pressure formation resulting the hydrostatic pressure of mud become less than the formation pressure and cause a kick.

====Gas cut mud====

When the gas is circulated to the surface, it expands and reduces the hydrostatic pressure sufficient to allow a kick. Although the mud density is reduced considerably at the surface, the hydrostatic pressure is not reduced significantly since the gas expansion occurs near surface and not at the bottom.

====Poor well planning====

The fourth cause of kick is poor well planning. The mud and casing programs have a great bearing on well control. These programs must be flexible enough to allow progressively deeper casing strings to be set; otherwise a situation may arise where it is not possible to control kicks or lost circulation. Well control is an important part of well planning.

==Well control methods==
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oil Well Drilling Engineering|last=Rabia|first=Hussain|publisher=Springer|year=1986|isbn=0860106616|location=|pages=302}}&lt;/ref&gt; During drilling operations, kicks are usually killed using the Driller’s, Engineer’s or a combination of both called Concurrent Method while forward circulating. The selection of which to use will depend upon the amount and type of kick fluids that have entered the well, the rig's equipment capabilities, the minimum fracture pressure in the open hole, and the drilling and operating companies well control policies.
For workover or completion operations, other methods are often used. . Bullheading is a common way to kill a well during workovers and completions operations but is not often used for drilling operations. Reverse circulation is another kill method used for workovers that is not used for drilling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=CHEVRON DRILLING REFERENCE SERIES VOLUME FIFTEEN|pages=A-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conclusion==
The aim of oil operations is to complete all tasks in a safe and efficient manner without detrimental effects to the environment. This aim can only be achieved if control of the well is maintained at all times. The understanding of pressure and pressure relationships is important in preventing blowouts.  Blowouts are prevented by experienced personnel that are able to detect when the well is kicking and take proper and prompt actions to shut-in the well.

[[File:Wishbone Interface.svg|thumb|343px|right|Master and Slave Wishbone's interfaces.]]
The '''Wishbone Bus''' is an [[open source hardware]] [[computer bus]] intended to let the parts of an [[integrated circuit]] communicate with each other.  The aim is to allow the connection of differing [[Semiconductor intellectual property core|cores]] to each other inside of a chip.  The '''Wishbone Bus''' is used by many designs in the [[OpenCores]] project.

A large number of open-source [[Central processing unit|CPU]] designs and auxiliary computer peripherals have been released with Wishbone interfaces.  Many can be found at [[OpenCores]], a foundation that attempts to make open-source hardware designs available.

Wishbone is intended as a "logic bus".  It does not specify electrical information or the bus topology. Instead, the specification is written in terms of "signals", clock cycles, and high and low levels.

This ambiguity is intentional.  Wishbone is made to let designers combine several designs written in [[Verilog]], [[VHDL]] or some other logic-description language for [[electronic design automation]].  Wishbone provides a standard way for designers to combine these [[hardware logic]] designs (called "cores").
Wishbone is defined to have 8, 16, 32, and 64-bit buses. All signals are synchronous to a single clock but some slave responses must be generated [[Combinational logic|combinatorially]] for maximum performance. Wishbone permits addition of a "tag bus" to describe the data. But reset, simple addressed reads and writes, movement of blocks of data, and indivisible bus cycles all work without tags.
 
Wishbone is [[Open-source software|open source]], which makes it easy for engineers and hobbyists to share public domain designs for hardware logic on the Internet. To prevent preemption of its technologies by aggressive patenting, the Wishbone specification includes examples of [[prior art]], to prove its concepts are in the public domain.

A device does not ''conform'' to the Wishbone specification unless it includes a ''data sheet'' that describes what it does, bus width, utilization, etc. Promoting reuse of a design requires the data sheet. Making a design reusable in turn makes it easier to share with others.

The [[Simple Bus Architecture]] is a simplified version of the Wishbone specification.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://sba.accesus.com/ "About SBA"]
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wishbone Topologies==
Wishbone adapts well to common topologies such as point-to-point, many-to-many (i.e. the classic bus system), hierarchical, or even switched fabrics such as [[crossbar switch]]es.  In the more exotic topologies, Wishbone requires a bus controller or arbiter, but devices still maintain the same interface.

The '''World Habitat Awards''' were established in 1985 by the Building and Social Housing Foundation as part of its contribution to the [[United Nations]]' [[International Year of Shelter for the Homeless]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldhabitatawards.org/about/?lang=00 World Habitat Awards - About the Awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two awards are given annually to projects from the [[North-South divide|Global South]] as well as the North that provide practical, innovative and sustainable solutions to current housing needs, which are capable of being transferred or adapted for use elsewhere. 

==Overview==
The World Habitat Awards celebrate projects &amp; approaches that:
* Demonstrate practical, innovative and sustainable solutions to current housing issues faced by countries all around the world.
* Can be transferred or adapted for use as appropriate.
* Are already being implemented or are completed, i.e. not at design stage or very early stages of development
* View the term habitat from a broad perspective and bring other benefits as well, such as energy or water saving, income generation, social inclusion, community and individual empowerment, capacity building or education.
