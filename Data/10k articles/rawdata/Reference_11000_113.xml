'''''The American Practical Navigator''''' (colloquially often referred to as '''''Bowditch'''''), originally written by [[Nathaniel Bowditch]], is an encyclopedia of [[navigation]]. It serves as a valuable handbook on [[oceanography]] and [[meteorology]], and contains useful tables and a maritime glossary. In 1867 the [[copyright]] and [[Lithography|plates]] were bought by the [[Hydrographic office#United States|Hydrographic Office]] of the [[United States Navy]], and as a U.S. Government publication, it is now available free online. It is considered one of America's nautical institutions.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

==History==
The most popular navigational text of the late 18th century was ''The New Practical Navigator'' by [[John Hamilton Moore]] of the [[Royal Navy]], first published in 1772. To have exact tables to work from, Bowditch recomputed all of Moore's tables, and rearranged and expanded the work. He contacted the US publisher of the work, [[Edmund March Blunt]], who asked him to correct and revise the third edition on his fifth voyage. The task was so extensive that Bowditch decided to write his own book, and to "put down in the book nothing I can't teach the crew." On that trip, it is said that every man of the crew of 12, including the ship's cook, became competent to take and calculate lunar observations and to plot the correct position of the ship. ''The New Practical Navigator'' was published in 1799, followed by a second edition in 1800.

By 1802, when Blunt was ready to publish a third edition, Nathaniel Bowditch and others had corrected so many errors in Moore's work that Blunt decided to publish it as the first edition of a new work, ''The New American Practical Navigator''. The current edition of the ''American Practical Navigator'' traces its pedigree to that 1802 edition. Edmund M. Blunt continued to publish the book until 1833; upon his retirement, his sons, Edmund and George, assumed publication. The elder Blunt died in 1862; his son Edmund followed in 1866. The next year, 1867, George Blunt sold the copyright to the government for $25,000. The government has published ''Bowditch'' ever since. George Blunt died in 1878.

Nathaniel Bowditch continued to correct and revise the book until his death in 1838. Upon his death, the editorial responsibility for ''The New American Practical Navigator'' passed to his son, [[Ingersoll Bowditch|J. Ingersoll Bowditch]]. Very few significant changes were made under him. Editions from 1837 through 1880 are nearly identical in content. Ingersoll Bowditch continued editing the ''Navigator'' until George Blunt sold the copyright to the government. He outlived all of the principals involved in publishing and editing the ''Navigator'', dying in 1889.

The U.S. government has published some 52 editions since acquiring the copyright to the book that has come to be known simply by its original author’s name, "Bowditch". Since the government began production, the book has been known by its year of publishing, instead of by the edition number. After the first major revision, a total overhaul of the book's content completed in 1880 under the direction of Commander [[Philip H. Cooper]], USN, the name was changed to ''American Practical Navigator''. Much of Bowditch’s original content, including his methods for clearing [[Lunar distance (navigation)|lunar distance]] observations, were dropped in 1880 (though a new method for clearing lunars remained in an appendix until the early 20th&amp;nbsp;century). After numerous incremental revisions and printings in the period from 1914 to 1944, ''Bowditch'' was extensively revised between 1946 and 1958.

The present volume, while retaining the basic format of the 1958 version, reorganizes the subjects, deletes obsolete text, and adds new material to keep pace with the extensive changes in navigation that have taken place in the electronic age.

The 1995 edition of the ''American Practical Navigator'' incorporates extensive changes in organization, content, and format. Recent advances in navigational electronics, communications, positioning, and other technologies have transformed the way navigation is practiced at sea, and it is clear that even more changes are forthcoming. The changes to this edition of ''Bowditch'' are intended to ensure that this publication remains the premier reference work for practical marine navigation. Concerted efforts were made to return to Nathaniel Bowditch’s original intention "to put down in the book nothing I can’t teach the crew." To this end, many complex formulas and equations have been eliminated, and emphasis placed on the capabilities and limitations of various navigation systems and how to use them, instead of explaining complex technical and theoretical details. This edition replaces but does not cancel former editions, which may be retained and consulted as to navigation methods not discussed herein.
Current edition (as of June 2017) is Edition 53, a two-volume, all-digital version released by NGA in 2017.

The Bicentennial Edition (2002) incorporated Volume 1 and Volume 2 into a single printed volume, with the goal of putting as much useful information before the navigator as possible in the most understandable and readable format, a single, hard-bound volume. While that edition saw widespread use in civilian, military and commercial fleets, it sacrificed some data on classical celestial navigation and on advances in satellite and electronic navigation to meet the compressed requirements of the physical form factor. Twenty years later, with a resurgence in interest on celestial navigation and the large-scale adoption of electronic navigation, NGA returned Pub No. 9 to a two-volume format to encompass the expanded material. To eliminate printing costs, NGA does not intend to produce a physical version of the 2017 edition.

The '''Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye''' ({{IPA-fr|ʃɑto də sɛ̃ ʒɛʁmɛ̃ ɑ̃ lɛ}}) is a royal [[palace]] in the [[commune in France|commune]] of [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], in the ''[[département in France|département]]'' of [[Yvelines]], about 19&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Paris]], [[France]].  Today, it houses the ''[[National Archaeological Museum (France)|musée d'Archéologie nationale]]'' (National Museum of Archaeology).

== History ==

=== 12th–13th centuries ===
[[Image:Saint-Germain-en-Laye - Sainte-Chapelle01.jpg|thumb|left|Sainte-Chapelle]]
The first [[castle]], named the ''Grand Châtelet'', was built on the site by [[Louis VI of France|Louis VI]] in around 1122. The castle was expanded by [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] in the 1230s.

Louis IX's chapelle Saint Louis at the castle belongs to the [[Rayonnant]] phase of [[French Gothic architecture]]. A 1238 charter of Louis IX instituting a regular religious service at the chapel is the first mention of a chapel having been built at the royal castle. This was a ''Sainte Chapelle'', to house a relic of the [[Crown of Thorns]] or the [[True Cross]]. Its plan and architecture prefigure the major [[Sainte-Chapelle]] which Saint Louis built within the [[Palais de la Cité]] at [[Paris]] between 1240 and 1248. Both buildings were built by Louis's favourite architect [[Pierre de Montreuil]], who adapted the architectural formulae invented at Saint Germain for use in Paris. A single nave ends in a [[Apse#Chevet|chevet]], with almost all the wall areas filled by tall thin glass windows, between which are large exterior [[buttress]]es. The [[ogive]]s of the vault rest on columns between the bays and the column bases are placed behind a low isolated arcade. The building can thus be open and empty of all internal supports. This large number of windows is also enabled by the ''pierre armée'' technique, with metal elements built into the structure of the walls to ensure the stones' stability. The west wall is adorned by a large Gothic [[rose window]] in the "[[rayonnant]]" Gothic style. It was in this chapel in 1238 that [[Baldwin II of Constantinople]] presented Louis with the [[relics of Sainte-Chapelle|relic of the crown of thorns]] and, though they were intended for the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris, they were housed here until the Paris chapel was consecrated in April 1248.

The castle was burned by the [[Edward, the Black Prince|Black Prince]] in 1346; of it, only the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] chapel remains from the site's medieval phase.  This ''Château Vieux'' was rebuilt by [[Charles V of France|Charles V]] in the 1360s on the old foundations.

=== 16th–18th centuries  ===
[[File:Château Neuf de Saint-Germain-en-Laye.jpg|thumb|350x350px|[[Château-Neuf de St-Germain-en-Laye]], a new addition to the palace that was later demolished]]
The oldest parts of the current [[château]] were reconstructed by [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] in 1539, and have subsequently been expanded several times. On 10 July 1547 a political rivalry came to a head in a bloody game here. Against the odds, [[Guy Chabot]], 7th baron de [[Jarnac]] triumphed over [[François de Vivonne]], seigneur de la Chasteigneraie, giving rise to the [[coup de Jarnac]].

[[Image:Chateau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye Cour.JPG|thumb|left|Staircase tower in the corner of the court]]

[[Henry II of France|Henry II]] built a separate new château (''[[Chateau-Neuf de Saint-Germain-en-Laye|le Château Neuf]]'') nearby, to designs by [[Philibert de l'Orme]]. It stood at the crest of a slope, which was shaped, under the direction of [[Étienne du Pérac]]&lt;ref&gt;Karling 1974, p 10&lt;/ref&gt; into three massive descending terraces and narrower subsidiary mediating terraces, which were linked by divided symmetrical stairs and ramps and extended a single axis that finished at the edge of the [[Seine]]; the design took many cues from the [[Villa Lante]] at [[Bagnaia]].&lt;ref&gt;F. Hamilton Hazlehurst, ''Jacques Boyceau'', pp20, 77–79, 100, noted by Karling.&lt;/ref&gt; "Étienne du Pérac had spent a long time in Italy, and one manifestation of his interest in gardens of this type is his well-known view of the [[Villa d'Este]], engraved in 1573."&lt;ref&gt;Karling 1974, p 11&lt;/ref&gt;

The gardens laid out at Saint-Germain-en-Laye were among a half-dozen gardens introducing the Italian garden style to France that laid the groundwork for the [[French formal garden]]. Unlike the [[parterre]]s that were laid out in casual relation to existing châteaux, often on difficult sites originally selected for defensive reasons,&lt;ref&gt;
Even the parterres at [[Fontainebleau]] bear no direct relation to the façades of the château.&lt;/ref&gt;
these new gardens extended the central axis of a symmetrical building façade in rigorously symmetrical axial designs of patterned parterres, gravel walks, fountains and basins, and formally planted [[bosquet]]s; they began the tradition that reached its apex after 1650 in the gardens of [[André Le Nôtre]].&lt;ref&gt;Sten Karling, in "The importance of André Mollet and his family for the development of the French formal garden," in ''The French Formal Garden'', Elizabeth MacDougall and F. Hamilton Hazlehurst, editors, (Dumbarton Oaks, 1974), in making this point, notes [[Château d'Ancy-le-Franc|Ancy-le-Franc]], [[Château d'Anet|Anet]], [[Château de Maune|Maune]], [[Château de Charleval|Charleval]], [[Château de Verneuil|Verneuil]] and Saint-Germain-en-Laye.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Claude Mollet]]'s ''Théâtre des plans et jardinage''&lt;ref&gt;The book was not published until 1652, but it had long been in preparation (Karling 1974).&lt;/ref&gt; the parterres were laid out in 1595 for [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] by Mollet, trained at Anet and the progenitor of a dynasty of royal gardeners. One of the parterre designs by Mollet at Saint-Germain-en-Laye was illustrated in [[Olivier de Serres]]' ''Le théâtre d'agriculture et mesnage des champs''&lt;!--mesnage is correct--&gt; (1600), but the ''Château Neuf'' and the whole of its spectacular series of terraces can be fully seen in an engraving after [[Tommaso Francini|Alexandre Francini]], 1614.&lt;ref&gt;Francini's engraving is illustrated by Karling, fig. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] was born at Saint-Germain-en-Laye in 1638.  One of du Pérac's retaining walls collapsed in 1660, and Louis undertook a renovation of the gardens in 1662. At his majority he established his court here in 1666, but he preferred the ''Château Vieux'': the ''Château Neuf'' was abandoned in the 1660s and demolished. From 1663 until 1682, when the king removed definitively to [[Versailles]], the team that he inherited from the unfortunate Fouquet — [[Louis Le Vau]], [[Jules Hardouin-Mansart]] and [[André Le Nôtre]] laboured to give the ancient pile a more suitable aspect.

The gardens were remade by [[André Le Nôtre]] from 1669 to 1673, and include a 2.4&amp;nbsp;kilometre long stone terrace which provides a view over the valley of the [[Seine]] and, in the distance, Paris.

[[Image:Gare de St Germain en Laye.jpg|thumb|left|The Château is at the centre of the town of [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], close by its [[RER A]] [[Gare de Saint Germain-en-Laye|railway station]].]]

Louis XIV turned the château over to King [[James II of England]] after his exile from Britain in the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688. King James lived in the château for thirteen years, and his daughter [[Louisa Maria Teresa Stuart|Louise-Marie Stuart]] was born in exile here in 1692. King James lies buried in the nearby Church of [[Germain of Paris|Saint-Germain]]; his wife [[Mary of Modena|Mary Beatrice]] remained at the château until her death in 1718.  Their son [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James]] left the château in 1716, ultimately settling in Rome.  Many [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]]s - supporters of the exiled Stuarts - remained at the château until the [[French Revolution]], leaving in 1793. The Jacobites often consisted of former members of the Jacobite court, and the apartments left empty in the chateau by the Jacobite court pensioners upon their death, were often passed down to their widows and children by the caretaker of the chateau, [[Adrien Maurice de Noailles|Adrien Maurice, the Duke de Noailles]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward T.

After the death of the Duke de Noailles in 1766, who had been responsible for the continuing Jacobite dominance because of his preference to give rooms to Jacobites, the British dominance quickly decreased and more French inhabitants were given lodgings in the chateau: the last member of the Stuart court was Theresa O'Connel, who died in 1778.&lt;ref&gt;Edward T.

=== 19th–21st centuries ===

In the 19th century, [[Napoleon I]] established his cavalry officers' training school here.  [[Napoleon III]] initiated restoration of the castle by [[Eugène Millet]], starting in 1862.
It became the ''Musée des Antiquités Nationales'' (National Museum of Antiquities) in 1867, displaying the archeological objects of France.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}
[[Auguste Lafollye]] took over responsibility for the restoration on Millet's death in 1879, continuing until 1889.
His goal, and that of his successor [[Honoré Daumet]], was to restore the French Renaissance style of [[Francis I of France|Francis I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|page=189

On September 10, 1919 the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], ending hostilities between the [[Allies of World War I]] and [[Austria]], was signed at the château.&lt;ref&gt;"Austrian treaty signed in amity," ''The New York Times'', Sept. 11, 1919, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the German occupation (1940–44), the château served as the headquarters of the German Army in France.

The museum was renamed the ''[[Musée d'Archéologie Nationale]]'' in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/actualites/communiq/donnedieu/musees2005.html Ministerial decree no. 2005-698 of June 22, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; Its collections include finds from [[Paleolithic]] to [[Merovingian]] times.

A '''dispute board''' or '''dispute review board''' (DRB) or '''dispute adjudication board''' (DAB) is a 'job-site' dispute adjudication process, typically comprising three independent and impartial persons selected by the contracting parties. The significant difference between Dispute Review Boards and most other Alternate Dispute Review techniques (and possibly the reason why or Dispute Review Boards have had such success in recent years) is that the Dispute Review Board is appointed at the commencement of a project before any disputes arise and, by undertaking regular visits to the site, is actively involved throughout the project (and possibly any agreed period thereafter).&lt;ref&gt;"Chern on Dispute Boards", third edition - Informa Law from Routledge, 2015 (www.routledge.com/books/details/9781138781733/)&lt;/ref&gt;

A Dispute Board becomes a part of the project administration and thereby can influence, during the contract period, the performance of the contracting parties. It has 'real-time' value. The idea behind a standing [[Dispute resolution|Dispute Resolution]] Board is that it may be called upon early in the evolution of any dispute which cannot be resolved by the parties and be asked to publish decisions or recommendations on how the matters in issue should be settled. It is usual (but not compulsory) that an opportunity remains for the matter to be referred to arbitration or to the courts if the Dispute Review Board's decision does not find acceptance by the parties. Thus a Dispute Resolution Board may be likened to the United Kingdom's adjudication process, either under statutory-compliant contracts or under the regime established by statute itself . What a Dispute Review Board does that [[United Kingdom]] statutory adjudication does not do is to provide a regular and continuing forum for discussion of difficult or contentious matters, to identify ways forward by acting in an informal capacity and to create valuable opportunities for the parties to avoid disputes by keeping proactive communication alive. Another aspect, which is less often discussed, is that by establishing a Dispute Board from the inception of the project the Dispute Board members become part of the project team and are thought of in a different fashion and because of their "hands on" approach can be trusted to be fair and impartial and their advise respected and taken more readily than would a third party or stranger to the project.

The terms Dispute Board or Dispute Review Board are generic terms and include (a) the Dispute Review Board (DRB) which is a device that originated in the USA and provides non-binding recommendations); (b) the Dispute Adjudication Board (DAB) which is a device emerging from the earlier USA model, but which provides a decision that has interim-binding force); and (c) the Combined Dispute Board (CDB), which is a hybrid of Dispute Review Boards and Dispute Adjudication Boards which was created by the [[International Chamber of Commerce]] in 2004. Various other terms have been used such as Dispute Settlement Panel, Dispute Mediation Board, Dispute Avoidance Panel and Dispute Conciliation Panel. Fundamentally these different varieties of Dispute Review devices are the same, each providing early adjudication based on the contractual bargain between the parties.

A Dispute Review Board is a creature of contract; the parties establish and empower a Dispute Review Board with jurisdiction to hear and advise on the resolution of disputes. Within the United Kingdom it is entirely possible for the contracting parties to establish a Dispute Review Board to adjudicate construction contract disputes within the statutory requirement for adjudication . As yet, there are no statutory requirements for Dispute Review Boards to be established to adjudicate disputes under construction contracts.

While the origins of Dispute Review Boards are found in the [[Construction|construction industry]], their ambit is far wider than construction and Dispute Review Boards are now found in the financial services industry, the Maritime Industry, long-term concession projects, operational and maintenance contracts. The scope for Dispute Review Boards is substantial. The emergence of the International Chamber of Commerce as an active supporter of Dispute Boards, as well as the Dispute Board Federation and the Dispute Resolution Board Foundation, makes it highly probable that dispute boards will be established in a range of industries that, until now, have not used adjudication to any great extent.

==The Costs Savings==
Recent studies have shown&lt;ref&gt;The Dispute Board Federation (Geneva) 2008 International Survey www.dbfederation.org&lt;/ref&gt; that the cost of a Dispute Board will result in even the most strenuous dispute being resolved and with an almost 99% success rate of dispute resolution without the need for either costly litigation or arbitration the savings are enormous. The reason this is significant is because the construction industry has a reputation for disputes and conflict. [[Anecdotal evidence]] from Australia, as just one example, indicates that 50% of all legal cost associated with construction is expended in connection with disputes. In almost 10% of projects, between 8% and 10% of the total project cost was legal cost. Not surprisingly, these projects have a high incidence of disputes. This expenditure, which globally represents an enormous sum each year, does not begin to take into account the hidden costs of disputes; the damage to reputations and commercial relationships, the cost of time spent by executive personnel, and the cost of lost opportunities. The situation is aggravated by the increased use of [[joint venture]]s both in consulting and in contracting. Such organisations are less autonomous and perhaps less able to negotiate settlements of their contractual problems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4136">A '''driver's manual''' is a book created by the DMV of a corresponding state in order to give information to people about the state’s driving laws. This can include information such as how to get a license, license renewal, road laws, driving restrictions, etc. “In the U.S. there is no central organization that is responsible for the creation of Driver’s Manuals.” (Idaho Driver’s Manual).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://itd.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/driver_manual.pdf|title=Idaho Driver's Manual|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result there is no set of rules for the states to create the manuals, so all driver’s manuals vary by state. However, every state does still follow general guidelines when creating the manuals.

The beginning of every manual starts with how to get a driver’s license. It informs us about what types of identification is needed, and who is eligible to apply for a license. In most states, you “must provide documentary proof of their full legal name, age, Social Security number, citizenship, or legal presence and address.” (Ohio Driver’s Manual).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://driving-tests.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/OH_hsy7607.pdf|title=Ohio Driver's Manual|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all states there is a minimum age requirement for getting a driver’s permit, which later leads into receiving a full driver’s license. This age limit varies by state. “The person must also be in good general health, and can have good vision with or without glasses or contacts.”(New Jersey Driver's Manual).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.state.nj.us/mvc/pdf/Manuals/drivermanual.pdf|title=New Jersey Driver's Manual|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also usually a payment fee in order to receive your license. Along with getting a license, all states also offer voter registration and becoming an organ donor when applying for your license. Every state requires taking a written test to receive your driver’s permit. Every state also requires a driver’s test that you must past in order to get your license. However, only a few of the states’ manuals actually go into detail about what exactly they will test you on for the driving test. All manuals proceed to talk about the specifics of how to drive and the rules of the road.	

Every manual includes a section that goes into detail about car and driver safety. All states require vehicle inspection, but only some require annual inspection. Driving while intoxicated is illegal in the United States. Almost all states have a “minimum blood alcohol level while driving of .08%” (Kentucky Driver’s Manual).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kentuckystatepolice.org/pdf/2012_ky_drivers_manual_op.pdf|title=Kentucky Driver's Manual|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For seat belts, 49 states and the [[District of Columbia]] have passed laws requiring seat belt use by at least all occupants of the front seat. New Hampshire is the only state with no such requirement for adults. However, in all states anyone under the age of 18 is required to wear a seat belt. Vehicles must always make way for emergency vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/DR2337.pdf|title=Colorado Driver's Manual|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iowadot.gov/mvd/driverslicense/dlmanual/dlmanual.pdf|title=Iowa Driver's Manual|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Manifesto of the Italian Fasci of Combat''''' ({{lang-it|Il manifesto dei fasci italiani di combattimento}}), commonly known as the '''Fascist Manifesto''', was the initial declaration of the political stance of the ''[[Fasci Italiani di Combattimento]]'' ("Italian League of Combat")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Italy: Rise of Mussolini|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?groupid=3432&amp;HistoryID=ac52|accessdate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the movement founded in [[Milan]] by [[Benito Mussolini]] in 1919 and an early exponent of [[Italian Fascism|Fascism]]. The Manifesto was authored by [[National syndicalism|national syndicalist]] [[Alceste De Ambris]] and the [[Futurism (literature)|futurist poet]] [[Filippo Marinetti]].

==Contents of the Fascist Manifesto==
The Manifesto (published in ''[[Il Popolo d'Italia]]'' on June 6, 1919) is divided into four sections, describing the movement's objectives in political, social, military and financial fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Il manifesto dei fasci di combattimento|url=http://web.tiscalinet.it/regno76/testi/manifesti/Il%20manifesto%20dei%20fasci%20di%20combattimento.htm|accessdate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Politically, the Manifesto calls for:
* [[Universal suffrage]] with a lowered voting age to 18 years, and voting and electoral office eligibility for all age 25 and up;
* [[Proportional representation]] on a regional basis;
* Voting for women (which was then opposed by most other European nations);
* Representation at government level of newly created national councils by economic sector;
* The abolition of the [[Italian Senate]] (at the time, the Senate, as the upper house of parliament, was by process elected by the wealthier citizens, but were in reality direct appointments by the king. It has been described as a sort of extended council of the crown);
* The formation of a national council of experts for labor, for industry, for transportation, for the public health, for communications, etc. Selections to be made of professionals or of tradesmen with legislative powers, and elected directly to a general commission with ministerial powers.

In labor and social policy, the Manifesto calls for:
* The quick enactment of a law of the state that sanctions an [[eight-hour day|eight-hour workday]] for all workers;
* A [[minimum wage]];
* The participation of workers' representatives in the functions of industry commissions;
* To show the same confidence in the [[Trade union|labor unions]] (that prove to be technically and morally worthy) as is given to industry executives or public servants;
* Reorganization of the railways and the transport sector;
* Revision of the draft law on invalidity insurance;
* Reduction of the [[retirement age]] from 65 to 55.

In military affairs, the Manifesto advocates:
* Creation of a short-service national militia with specifically defensive responsibilities;
* Armaments factories are to be nationalized;
* A peaceful but competitive foreign policy.

In finance, the Manifesto advocates:
* A strong progressive tax on capital (envisaging a “partial expropriation” of concentrated wealth);
* The seizure of all the possessions of the religious congregations and the abolition of all the [[Diocese|bishoprics]], which constitute an enormous liability on the Nation and on the privileges of the poor;
* Revision of all contracts for military provisions;
* The revision of all military contracts and the seizure of 85 percent of the profits therein.

These early positions reflected in the Manifesto would later be characterized by Mussolini in the [[Doctrine of Fascism]] as "a series of pointers, forecasts, hints which, when freed from the inevitable matrix of contingencies, were to develop in a few years time into a series of doctrinal positions entitling Fascism to rank as a political doctrine differing from all others, past or present."&lt;ref&gt;The Doctrine of Fascism: Benito Mussolini and Giovanni Gentile, 1932. http://www.worldfuturefund.org/wffmaster/reading/germany/mussolini.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Manifesto in practice==
Of the Manifesto's proposals, the commitment to corporative organisation of economic interests was to be the longest lasting. Far from becoming a medium of extended democracy, [[Parliament of the Kingdom of Italy|parliament]] became by law an exclusively Fascist-picked body in 1929; being replaced by the "chamber of corporations" a decade later.

Fascism's pacifist foreign policy ceased during its first year of Italian government. In September 1923, the [[Corfu crisis]] demonstrated the regime’s willingness to use force internationally. Perhaps the greatest success of Fascist diplomacy was the [[Lateran Treaty]] of February 1929: which accepted the principle of non-interference in the affairs of the Church. This ended the 59-year-old dispute between Italy and the [[Papacy]].

'''Fish''' (sometimes '''FISH''') was the UK's GC&amp;CS [[Bletchley Park]] codename for any of several German [[teleprinter]] [[stream cipher]]s used during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ Harvnb | Mache | 1986 | pp = 230–242 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ Harvnb | Deavours | &amp; Kruh | pp = 243–247 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ Harvnb | Mache | 1989 | pp = 97–117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Enciphered teleprinter traffic was used between [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|German High Command]] and Army Group commanders in the field, so its intelligence value ([[Ultra (cryptography)|Ultra]]) was of the highest strategic value to the Allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Harvnb | Copeland | 2006 | p = 47 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This traffic normally passed over landlines, but as German forces extended their geographic reach beyond western Europe, they had to resort to wireless transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Harvnb | Lewin | 2001 | p = 130 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bletchley Park decrypts of messages enciphered with the [[Enigma machine]]s revealed that the Germans called one of their wireless teleprinter transmission systems ''"Sägefisch"'' (sawfish) which led British [[cryptographer]]s to refer to encrypted German [[Wireless telegraphy|radiotelegraphic]] traffic as Fish. The code Tunny (tunafish) was the name given to the first non-Morse link, and it was subsequently used for the Lorenz SZ machines and the traffic enciphered by them.

== History ==
In June 1941, the British [[Y-stations|"Y" wireless intercept stations]], as well as receiving [[Enigma machine|Enigma]][[cipher|-enciphered]] [[Morse code]] traffic, started to receive non-Morse traffic which was initially called NoMo.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Harvnb | Copeland | 2006 | p = 338 }}&lt;/ref&gt; NoMo1 was a German army link between Berlin and Athens, and NoMo2 a temporary air force link between Berlin and Königsberg. The parallel Enigma-enciphered link to NoMo2, which was being read by [[Government Communications Headquarters#Government Code and Cypher School|Government Code and Cypher School]] at [[Bletchley Park]], revealed that the Germans called the wireless teleprinter transmission systems ''"Sägefisch"'' (sawfish). This led the British to use the code '''''Fish''''' dubbing the machine and its traffic '''''Tunny'''''.&lt;ref&gt;Codebreakers : the inside story of Bletchley Park, F.H. Hinsley, Alan Stripp, 1994, https://books.google.com/books?id=j1MC2d2LPAcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Codebreakers+:+the+inside+story+of+Bletchley+Park,&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Introduction%20to%20fish&amp;f=false, An Introduction to Fish, Hinsley, pp. 141-148&lt;/ref&gt;

The enciphering/deciphering equipment was called a ''Geheimschreiber'' (secret writer) which, like Enigma, used a [[involution (mathematics)|symmetrical]] [[substitution alphabet]]. The teleprinter code used was the [[Baudot code#ITA2|International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2 (ITA2)]]—Murray's modification of the 5-bit Baudot code.

When the Germans invaded Russia, during World War II, the Germans began to use a new type of enciphered transmission between central headquarters and headquarters in the field. The transmissions were known as Fish at Bletchley Park. (See [[Lorenz cipher]], [[Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher]].) The German army used Fish for communications between the highest authorities in Berlin and the high-ranking officials of the German Army on the field. The Fish traffic which the personnel at Bletchley Park intercepted, contained discussions, orders, situation reports and many more details about the intentions of the German Army. However, these transmissions were so challenging to decrypt that even with the assistance of the high speed Colossus computer, the messages could not be read until several days later.&lt;ref&gt;F.H. Hinsley and Alan Stripp (eds.) '''Code Breakers: The Inside Story of Bletchley Park''', Oxford University Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; “Vital intelligence was obtained about Hitler’s intentions in the run up to D-Day 1944.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Obits/Tutte.html|publisher=The Times|title=Professor Bill Tutte: Mathematician who, as a Bletchley Park codebreaker, gained access to the ciphers of the German Army High Command}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Traffic code names ==

===Tunny===
[[File:Lorenz-SZ42-2.jpg|right|280px|thumbnail|The Lorenz SZ42 machine with its covers removed. [[Bletchley Park]] museum]]
The NoMo1 link was initially named '''Tunny''' (for tunafish), a name which went on to be used both for the [[Lorenz SZ 40|Lorenz SZ40/42]] machines and for the Bletchley Park analogues of them. The NoMo1 link was subsequently renamed Codfish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gannon|2006|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of Tunny links were monitored by the [[Y-stations|Y-station]] at [[Knockholt]] and given names of fish. Most of these were between the ''[[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]]'' (German High Command, OKW) in Berlin and German army commands throughout occupied Europe. [[Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher]] at Bletchley Park, assisted initially by a machine called [[Heath Robinson (codebreaking machine)|Heath Robinson]] and later by the [[Colossus computer]]s yielded a great deal of valuable high-level intelligence.

Tunny decrypts provided high-grade intelligence in an unprecedented quality. Walter Jacobs, a US Army codebreaker who worked at Bletchley Park, wrote in an official report on the operation to break Tunny that in March 1945 alone 'upward of five million letters of current transmission, containing intelligence of the highest order, were deciphered'.&lt;ref&gt;S. Wylie, Breaking Tunny and the birth of Colossus, ''Action This Day'' (eds. M. Smith and R. Erskine), Bantam Press, London, 2001, pp. 317-341.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sturgeon===
This was the name given to traffic encoded with the [[Siemens and Halske T52]] ''Geheimschreiber''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Harvnb | Weierud | 2006 | pp=307–327 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ Harvnb | Smith | 2006 | p = 35 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1940, after the German invasion of Norway, the Swedish [[mathematician]] and [[cryptographer]] [[Arne Beurling]] used traffic intercepted from telegraph lines that passed through Sweden to break this cipher.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Harvnb | McKay | 2006 | pp = 328–333 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Bletchley Park eventually diagnosed and broke Sturgeon, the relatively low value of the intelligence gained, compared to the effort involved, meant that they did not read much of its traffic.

===Thrasher===
This was the name used for traffic enciphered on a ''Geheimschreiber'' that was probably the Siemens T43 [[One-time pad|one-time tape]] machine. This was used only on a few circuits, in the later stages of the war and was diagnosed at Bletchley Park, but considered to be unbreakable.

'''G.I.''' is an acronym used to describe the [[soldier]]s of the [[United States Army]] and [[Airman|airmen]] of the [[United States Army Air Forces]] and also for general items of their equipment.&lt;ref name="Rawson"&gt;{{cite web| first=Hugh | last=Rawson | url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/2/2006_2_15.shtml | title=Why do we say "G.I."? | publisher=American Heritage | volume=57 | issue=2 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829172935/http://americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/2/2006_2_15.shtml | archivedate=29 August 2008 | date=April–May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term G.I. has been used as an [[Acronym|initialism]] of "Government Issue" or "General Issue", but it originally referred to "[[Galvanization|galvanized]] [[iron]]", as used by the [[military logistics|logistics]] services of the [[United States Armed Forces]].&lt;ref name="wordorig"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilton|first=Dave|title=G.I. - Wordorigins.org |url=http://www.wordorigins.org/index.php/more/310/|publisher=Wordorigins.org|date=2 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GI – Definitions from Dictionary.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/GI |work=Dictionary.com Unabridged|publisher=Random House, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War I]], American soldiers sardonically referred to incoming German [[Shell (projectile)|artillery shell]]s as "G.I. cans". Also during that war, "G.I." started being interpreted as "Government Issue" or "General Issue" for the general items of equipment of soldiers and airmen. The term "G.I." came into widespread use in the United States with the start of the [[Selective Service System]] ("the draft") in 1940, extending into 1941. Next, the use of "G.I." expanded from 1942 through 1945. The American [[Five-star general|five-star General]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] said in 1945 that "the truly heroic figure of this war [is] G.I. Joe and his counterpart in the air, the navy, and the Merchant Marine of every one of the [[Allies of World War II|United Nations]]."&lt;ref name="newsreel"&gt;{{cite video | url=https://archive.org/details/1945-05-10_Funeral_Pyres_of_Nazidom | title=Funeral Pyres of Nazidom | publisher=Universal Newsreel | date=10 May 1945 | people=Eisenhower, Dwight D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"G.I." was also used as an adjective for anything having to do with the US Army or Army Air Force.&lt;ref name="wordorig"/&gt;
In British military parlance and in armed forces modelled on British military traditions, G.I. refers to a Gunnery Instructor (generally an [[Non-commissioned officer|NCO]] responsible for inducting and training recruits).

}}'''George Valentine Nash''' (May 6, 1864 – July 15, 1921) was an [[United States|American]] [[botanist]]. He was the Head Gardener and Curator of the Plantations at the New York Botanical Garden, for whom he did field work in the Bahamas, South Florida and Haiti.

== Life ==

=== Early life and family background ===

George Valentine Nash was born in Brooklyn, New York on May 6, 1864.&lt;ref name="Britton"&gt;Britton, Nathaniel Lord. "George Valentine Nash". '''Journal of the New York Botanical Garden'''. 22, August 1921, pp. 145-147.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was the son of Scotto Clark Nash (1841-1920) and Alice Valentine, who were married in Brooklyn, NY on February 2, 1863.&lt;ref name="Scotto"&gt;"Scotto Nash, a Biography," by William Wurst. (1976). Nash, George Valentine, Vertical File collection, The LuEsther T. Mertz Library, The New York Botanical Garden. June 14, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Scotto was the son of Rev. John Adams and Mary Moody (Clark) Nash, whose ancestry is traced back to  Pilgrim William Brewster, who came from England on the Mayflower in 1620.&lt;ref name="Scotto" /&gt;  Scotto and Alice also had a daughter, Mary Clark Nash.&lt;ref name="Scotto" /&gt;

Scotto, after many years as a businessman in various capacities, pursued an interest in nature by building greenhouses and growing roses.&lt;ref name="Scotto" /&gt;  In particular, he grew the American Beauty Rose, imported from England in 1882.&lt;ref name="Scotto" /&gt;  Assisted by George, Scotto was listed in a local Clifton, NJ directory as a "florist".&lt;ref name="Scotto" /&gt;  Scotto also had an exhibit of cut roses at the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago.&lt;ref name="Scotto" /&gt;

Nash added in many ways to the initial botanical training provided by his father.  Starting about 1888, he made the acquaintance of botanist and collector Dr. [[George Thurber]], editor of the ''American Agriculturalist'', who specialized in grasses.  Nash picked up this same interest and eventually received a large part of Thurber's grass herbarium.&lt;ref name="Britton" /&gt;  Nash also studied the wild plants of New Jersey and joined the [[Torrey Botanical Society|Torrey Botanical Club]] in 1891, where he met botanist [[Nathaniel Lord Britton|Nathanial Lord Britton]], who co-founded the [[New York Botanical Garden]] (NYBG).&lt;ref name="Britton" /&gt;  In 1894-96 Nash helped collect botanical specimens in central Florida and studied them at [[Columbia University|Columbia College]].  In addition, he studied botany with Britton.&lt;ref name="Britton" /&gt;

=== Later life and career ===

Nash first became employed by the [[New York Botanical Garden]] in 1896, during its preliminary organizational phase.  Beginning in 1900, he was promoted to Curator of the Plantations; then in 1901 he became Head Gardener.&lt;ref name="Britton" /&gt; That same year, the NYBG was invited by Sir [[William Turner Thiselton-Dyer|William Thiselton-Dyer,]] Director of the [[Kew Gardens|Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew]], England, to visit and acquire plant species to transplant for their initial collections.  Nash went on the trip.  The accession he selected included over 1000 species.&lt;ref name="Britton" /&gt;

Nash went on several other collecting and plant-exchanging trips.  In late 1901, he and Dr. [[John Kunkel Small|John K. Small]] connected over 1200 specimens of living plants in Florida.  In 1902, Nash made a second European trip for further study and to exchange plants with several other institutions, including a return visit to Kew, and others in Edinburgh, Cambridge, Brussels, Paris, and Utrecht.  Between 1903 and 1905, Nash made collecting expeditions to many islands in the Caribbean.&lt;ref name="Britton" /&gt;

Starting in 1906, Nash remained at the NYBG, supervising the creation and maintenance of the gardens, developing and cataloging the institution's plant collections, giving public lectures and demonstrations, and replying to inquiries about plants.&lt;ref name="Britton" /&gt;

Starting in 1909, Nash was Secretary of the Horticultural Society of New York.  He edited its journal for a while, and helped with exhibitions.&lt;ref name="Britton" /&gt;

== Selected publications ==

Nash is the author of over 180 publications on the topic of botany and horticulture, including his annual reports, published yearly in the NYBG Bulletin.&lt;ref name="Britton" /&gt;  His works on diverse botanical topics include:  ''Costa Rican Orchids'' (1906), ''North American Flora'' (1909), ''A revision of the family Fouquieriaceae'' (1906?), and ''A preliminary enumeration of the grasses of Porto Rico'' (1903).

In 1916, he became one of the two founding editors of the Garden's new botanical journal ''[[Addisonia (journal)|Addisonia]]'', along with [[John Hendley Barnhart]].&lt;ref name="Britton" /&gt;

== Miscellaneous ==

* Nash Park in [[Clifton, New Jersey]] is named after him and his family.&lt;ref name="Scotto" /&gt; 
* The genus Nashia, of the Verbena family, was named after Nash by [[Charles Frederick Millspaugh]].&lt;ref name="Britton" /&gt;
* Nash is credited with the discovery of several species of West Indian and Floridian plants.&lt;ref name="Britton" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7546">'''Guide to Reference''', published in 2008 as the online successor to ''Guide to Reference Books'', was a selective guide to the best print and online reference sources. An editorial team of reference librarians and subject experts selected and annotated some 16,000 entries, which were organized by subject. It was a subscription database, published by the [[American Library Association]], and was updated on an ongoing basis. It was intended as a resource for libraries when answering reference questions, planning library instruction, identifying items to purchase, and training staff.

The print edition was published regularly since 1902 by the [[American Library Association]], and had been a staple of academic reference libraries throughout the United States. However, its popularity of use had dropped in recent years with the continued rise of electronic databases.

The online product was closed down on March 31, 2016.&lt;ref name="Farewell"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guidetoreference.org/HomePage.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323003833/http://www.guidetoreference.org/HomePage.aspx |archive-date=March 23, 2016 |title=Farewell, and Thanks |work=Guide to Reference |accessdate=December 21, 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Guide was written in the first decade of the twentieth century by [[Alice Bertha Kroeger]], head of the library school at [[Drexel University]] in [[Philadelphia, PA]]. She developed a 104 page volume meant to educate students and professionals within the library community. Filled with short articles and indexes to other publications for further reading, Kroeger used her book to “codify both the principles of education for reference librarianship and reference librarianship’s province of expertise” (Kieft, 331). It also included a series of indexes describing and evaluating reference publications on a variety of topics and was meant to help the aspiring librarian learn about the most useful and reliable reference sources available on the market. The  American Library Association published her book as ''Guide to the Study and Use of Reference Books: A Manual for Librarians, Teachers and Students''. Kroeger produced two editions, one in 1902 and a second in 1907.
  
After Kroeger’s death in 1909 the [[American Library Association]] asked [[Isadore Gilbert Mudge]], head of the reference department for the library at [[Columbia University]], to take over the project.  Mudge started a trend at Columbia that would last for several decades, pushing their reference staff to essentially “lead four lives-as editors, administrators, collection builders, and front-line reference specialists” (Plotnik, 130).  Much of the work for the Guide was accomplished alongside the normal reference work duties of collection development and assisting students and professors with their research requests.  During this time the indexes on reference materials expanded and the book went through two title changes: ''New Guide to Reference Books'' in 1923 and ''Guide to Reference Books'' in 1929.
  
After taking the volume through three decades and four new editions, Mudge retired and passed the responsibility on to her successor at [[Columbia University]], [[Constance Mabel Winchell]].  Winchell reorganized the book, classifying the indexes into different disciplines similar to the academic departments of a university.  The indexes were greatly expanded under Winchell; when the eighth edition was published in 1967 it was quite a tome, including entries on some 7500 individual publications.   

When [[Eugene P. Sheehy]] took over as head of reference at Columbia in 1967 he took on the Guide.  Having worked as Winchell’s assistant for several years Sheehy adopted her style, process of selection and organization as his own.  He began issuing supplements to the Guide, with versions in 1968, 1970, and 1972.  The supplements expanded on the entries of Winchell’s eighth edition, adding indexes of material newly published or newly discovered.  A new ninth edition, which required Sheehy and his two assistants to update and correct entries from Winchell’s edition and add in material from their three supplements, was finally published in 1976.  This ninth edition was the first version to include listings of early electronic databases.  Sheehy continued editing and publishing supplements until he retired in 1986. 

The editorship passed for the 10th edition supplement and the 11th edition to [[Robert Balay]] of the Association of College and Research Libraries' Choice magazine. No longer the vision of a lone individual, the Guide became an increasingly cooperative project as reference literature grew and as contributors were drawn from libraries around the country.

==Current developments==

Use of the Guide became less and less frequent as research had turned more towards electronic databases such as [[EBSCO Publishing|EBSCOhost]] and [[JSTOR]]. The project to develop a 12th edition of the Guide as an online database was announced in 2000 under the editorship of Robert H. Kieft, then librarian at [[Haverford College]] (now college librarian at Occidental College). This online edition was published in 2009 and continually undated. It was the first to include listings of websites and was the first to be issued in electronic form. The online Guide's last general editor was Denise Beaubien Bennett, engineering librarian at the University of Florida’s Marston Science Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guidetoreference.org/DynamicContent.aspx?ctype=19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160223152021/http://www.guidetoreference.org/DynamicContent.aspx?ctype=19 |archive-date=February 23, 2016 |title=Editorial Review Board |work=Guide to Reference |accessdate=December 21, 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ALA Publishing, in collaboration with the Guide to Reference Editorial Review Board, announced that, due to the "current business climate", the Guide to Reference online product had ceased taking further subscriptions and would be closed down on March 31, 2016.&lt;ref name="Farewell"/&gt;

Some provisions are applied on a [[Private law|personal basis]], such that it applies to Israeli residents rather than territory.

In parallel, other portions of Israeli law, including Israeli [[criminal law]], are applied [[Extraterritoriality|extraterritorially]] on a personal basis to [[Israelis]] in the West Bank.&lt;ref name="Ben-NaftaliSfard2018"/&gt;

==Implementation in practice==
Territorial aspects of "enclave law" are implemented via a method called "pipelining".&lt;ref name="Ben-NaftaliSfard2018"/&gt; Under this method, [[Israeli Military Orders]], which constitute the primary laws in the West Bank, apply Israeli laws specifically to the jurisdictions of the [[Yesha Council|Israeli settlement local councils]].&lt;ref name="Ben-NaftaliSfard2018"/&gt; This method is used to give Israeli ministries, such as the [[Ministry of Education (Israel)|Israeli Ministry of Education]] and [[Ministry of Health (Israel)|Israeli Health Ministry]], jurisdiction over public facilities such as schools and hospitals in the territories.&lt;ref name="Ben-NaftaliSfard2018"/&gt;

==Dual legal system==
As a consequence "enclave law", Israeli settlers are subject to large portions of Israeli law whereas Palestinians are subject to a combination of Israeli military law and some local laws based on Jordanian law.&lt;ref name="EhrenbergPeled2016"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Ehrenberg|author2=Yoav Peled|title=Israel and Palestine: Alternative Perspectives on Statehood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gc11DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA192|date=29 July 2016|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=978-1-4422-4508-2|pages=192–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ben-NaftaliSfard2018"/&gt; In 1989 [[Eyal Benvenisti]] described how "through extensive military legislation, exterritorial application of Israeli legislation and Israeli court rulings" the [[Green Line (Israel)|border between Israel and the West Bank]] was no longer relevant for "almost all legal purposes that reflect Israeli interests", but the same was not true for the Palestinian population, especially with respect to civil rights.{{sfn|ACRI|2014|p=6|ps=: footnote to "enclave-based justice."}}&lt;ref name="Benveniśtî1990"&gt;{{cite book|last=Benveniśtî|first=Eyāl|title=Legal dualism: the absorption of the occupied territories into Israel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3SkOAAAAYAAJ|year=1990|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=978-0-8133-7983-8|quote=As this paper will show, the pre-June 1967 borders have faded for almost all legal purposes that reflect Israeli interests.

In December 2017, over 1,000 central committee members of [[Likud]] voted unanimously for “free construction and application of Israeli law and sovereignty in all liberated areas of settlement in Judea and Samaria”.&lt;ref&gt;Jerusalem Post, January 2018, [https://m.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/Likud-push-vote-for-West-Bank-sovereignty-does-not-obligate-Netanyahu-521498 Likud vote for West Bank sovereignty 'does not obligate' Netanyahu]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Enclave Law" was coined in 1988 by [[Amnon Rubinstein]],&lt;ref name="Sfard2018"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Sfard|title=The Wall and the Gate: Israel, Palestine, and the Legal Battle for Human Rights|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n7NyDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA126|date=23 January 2018|publisher=Henry Holt and Company|isbn=978-1-250-12271-1|pages=126–}}&lt;/ref&gt; an Israeli scholar of [[constitutional law]].&lt;ref name="Ben-Naftali2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Orna Ben-Naftali|title=International Humanitarian Law and International Human Rights Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CKvo2LV22FIC&amp;pg=PA148|date=13 January 2011|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-100160-4|pages=148–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rubinstein noted regarding the legal system for the West Bank, that: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;once perceived as an 'escrow' under the rules of international law – that is as a trust – they have become a 'legal mongrel' and have gradually been incorporated in practice into the realm of Israel's rule.&lt;ref name="Gross2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Aeyal Gross|title=The Writing on the Wall: Rethinking the International Law of Occupation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UFxEDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA176|date=6 April 2017|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-14596-2|pages=176–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a 2009 report authored by [[Virginia Tilley]], the South African [[Human Sciences Research Council]] wrote that "The outcome of the extraterritorial application of Israeli legislation on a personal basis, combined with the enclave law as described above, is that a settler lives within the framework of the West Bank law only in a very partial way".&lt;ref name=HSRC&gt;[http://www.hsrc.ac.za/en/research-data/view/4634 Occupation, colonialism, apartheid?: a re-assessment of Israel's practices in the occupied Palestinian territories under international law], 2009, pages 108-109&lt;/ref&gt; The report then quoted Rubinstein's 1986 Hebrew work:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A resident of Ma’ale Adumim, for instance, is supposedly subject to the Military Government and to the local Jordanian law, but in fact he lives according to the laws of Israel both with respect to his personal law and with respect to the local municipality wherein he lives. The Military Government is nothing more than a symbol, through which Israeli law and governance operate.&lt;ref name=HSRC/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term has been reported by ''[[Haaretz]]'' legal analyst Moshe Gorali&lt;ref name="Ageel2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ageel|first=Ghada|title=Apartheid in Palestine: Hard Laws and Harder Experiences|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SiRzCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT280|date=12 February 2016|publisher=University of Alberta Press|isbn=978-1-77212-101-8|pages=236}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be an alternative to the term "[[apartheid]]".&lt;ref name="Cook2013"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Jonathan Cook|last=Cook|first=Jonathan|title=Disappearing Palestine: Israel's Experiments in Human Despair|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5wFjDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT46|date=4 April 2013|publisher=Zed Books Ltd.|isbn=978-1-84813-649-6|pages=46–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Halper2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Halper|first=Jeff|authorlink=Jeff Halper|title=An Israeli in Palestine: resisting dispossession, redeeming Israel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OfovAQAAIAAJ|date=20 February 2008|publisher=Pluto Press|isbn=978-0-7453-2227-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moshe Gorali, 25 September 2003, [https://www.haaretz.com/1.4706177 Legality Is in the Eye of the Beholder], Haaretz: "To describe a situation where two populations, in this case one Jewish and the other Arab, share the same territory but are governed by two separate legal systems, the international community customarily uses the term "apartheid." Prof. Amnon Rubinstein has coined an alternative phrase, "enclave-based justice.""&lt;/ref&gt;{{Undue weight inline|date=November 2018}}

===The concept in Israeli courts===
The concept and application of Israeli law in the West Bank settlements has been described numerous times in Israeli courts.{{sfn|ACRI|2014|p=5-25}} Examples include a 2004 case, Yinon Food Manufacturing and Marketing Ltd v. Qaraan, with respect to a dispute between a Palestinian and their Israeli-settlement-based employer,{{efn|The court noted: “The legal character, from the point of view of internal Israeli law, of the Israeli settlement as an 'enclave' – which is not de facto subject to the law applying in that territory – is what renders the connection between the delict and the country whose law would normally have been the law of the place of its perpetration – to coincidental.”{{sfn|ACRI|2014|p=24|ps=: CA 1432/02 Yinon Food Manufacturing and Marketing Ltd v. Qaraan, PD 59(1) 345 (2004)}}}} a 2006 Supreme Court case, Peace Now S.A.L. Educational Enterprises v. Supervisor of the Jewish Settlements in Judea and Samaria, summarized by [[Elyakim Rubinstein]],{{efn|Rubinstein noted that: “The 'enclaves' are a sort of 'islands' to which Israeli laws were applied by legal means, under the assumption that there is no real difference between the law applying in Israel and the one that should apply in these enclaves... The matter at hand concerns Israeli citizens, and the assumption is that the gist of their lives should be as close as possible to that of the rest of Israeli citizens.”{{sfn|ACRI|2014|p=22|ps=: HCJ 10104/04 Peace Now S.A.L. Educational Enterprises v. Supervisor of the Jewish Settlements in Judea and Samaria 61(2) 93 (2006)}}}} and a 2007 Supreme Court case, Kav LaOved v. Jerusalem Labor Court, summarized by [[Eliezer Rivlin]].{{efn|Rivlin noted that: “The Israeli residents living in the West Bank are subject to extensive parts of Israeli law, in addition to special legislation by the military commander that applies solely to the Israeli residents. The Palestinian residents living in the very same territories are subject to Jordanian law and to legislation by the military governor that applies to them [...] This outcome creates a regime in which different sets of laws apply in one territory.”{{sfn|ACRI|2014|p=5|ps=: [http://elyon1.court.gov.il/Files/03/660/056/p17/03056660.p17.HTM HCJ 5666/03 Kav LaOved v. Jerusalem Labor Court, 62(3)]}} Rivlin went on to describe the "enclave law" as follows: “The law is different regarding Israeli residents in the occupied territories. For them, there is a separate legislative layer, known as the "Enclave Law", which includes internal Israeli legislation that has been applied personally to Israeli citizens or to persons entitled to be Israeli citizens and living in the territories only.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://elyon1.court.gov.il/Files/03/660/056/p17/03056660.p17.HTM HCJ 5666/03 Kav LaOved v. Jerusalem Labor Court, 62(3)], quote in original Hebrew: "
‎שונה הדין באשר לתושבים הישראלים בשטחים המוחזקים. לגביהם, מתקיים רובד חקיקתי נפרד, המוכר בכינוי "משפט המובלעות", ואשר כולל חקיקה ישראלית פנימית שהוחלה באופן אישי על אזרחים ישראלים או על מי שזכאים להיות אזרחים ישראלים ומתגוררים בשטחים בלבד."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''''Jewish Roots in Poland''''' (full title: ''Jewish Roots in Poland: Pages from the Past and Archival Inventories'') is a book created by genealogist [[Miriam Weiner (genealogist)|Miriam Weiner]] and co-published by The Miriam Weiner Routes to Roots Foundation and [[YIVO|YIVO Institute for Jewish Research]].&lt;ref name=RtRF-JewishRootsPoland-1997&gt;{{cite web|title=Publications: Jewish Roots in Poland: Pages from the Past and Archival Inventories|url=http://www.rtrfoundation.org/pol1.shtml|website=Routes to Roots Foundation|date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; A searchable database of updated archival holdings listed in the book is available in the Archive Database on the Routes to Roots Foundation website.&lt;ref name=RTRF-Search&gt;{{cite web|title=Search Archive Record Groups|url=http://www.rtrfoundation.org/search.php|website=Routes to Roots Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
In 1997, in official cooperation with the Polish State Archives (Naczelna Dyrekcja Archiwów Państwowych in [[Warsaw, Poland|Warsaw]], [[Poland]]), Weiner authored and published the book, ''Jewish Roots in Poland.''&lt;ref name=JewishRootsInPoland-1997&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weiner|first1=Miriam|last2=Polish State Archives (in cooperation with)|title=Jewish Roots in Poland: Pages from the Past and Archival Inventories|date=1997|publisher=Miriam Weiner Routes to Roots Foundation|location=Secaucus, NJ|isbn=978-0-96-565080-9|url=|oclc=38756480}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JewishExponent-JRPoland-1998&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leiter|first1=Robert|title=Routes to Roots: New book covers Holocaust, genealogy, travel and more|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/227265920|work=[[The Jewish Exponent]]|issue=Vol. 203, No. 10|date=5 March 1998|location=Philadelphia, PA|page=13|issn=0021-6437}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book includes archival holdings of the Polish State Archives, the [[Jewish Historical Institute]] in [[Warsaw]], local town hall documents throughout Poland, Holocaust documents found in the archives of the [[death camps]] located in [[Auschwitz]] near [[Krakow]] and [[Majdanek]] near [[Lublin]]. The book also features document examples, maps, antique postcards depicting towns and daily life, and modern-day photographs.&lt;ref name=BillGladstone-Poland-1998&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gladstone|first1=Bill|title=Weiner's Jewish Roots in Poland a ground-breaking inventory|url=http://www.billgladstone.ca/?p=2239|work=BillGladstone.ca|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are individual town listings for localities with more than 10,000 Jews in 1939.&lt;ref name=Ancestry-JRPoland-Review-1999&gt;{{cite news|last1=Luebking|first1=Sandra Hargreaves|title=Jewish Roots in Poland: Pages from the Past and Archival Inventories|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sw9dBJNqPRYC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=%22miriam+weiner%22+intitle:ancestry&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjA2qq8sbjQAhXJx4MKHfZECtAQ6AEINzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%22miriam%20weiner%22%20intitle%3Aancestry&amp;f=false|work=[[Ancestry Magazine]]|issue=Vol. 27, No. 5|publisher=[[Ancestry.com]]|date=January 1999|page=13|language=en|issn=1075-475X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Jewish Roots in Poland'' took over ten years to complete. The book includes an inventory of 1,250 towns and over 5,000 record entries for these towns. Sources of the material were the Polish State Archives (which included 75 archives throughout Poland), Urzad Stanu Cywilnego (which included 434 offices throughout Poland), and the Jewish Historical Institute in Warsaw. Holocaust documents came from Majdanek Museum Archives and Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum Archives. There are over 300 color photos and over 200 black and white photos of 127 towns, 52 document examples, and 14 color maps.

== Reception ==
''Jewish Roots in Poland'' was the first work of its kind, as it collected details on archival documents from Poland and the former Soviet Union that had previously been deemed inaccessible or fundamentally lost. The book also serves multiple functions, so its diversity of offerings often made categorizing what the book was difficult. It is a combination of genealogical resources and Holocaust references as well as a coffee table book. The book serves the function of a scholarly reference book as a repository of gathered information, but with the many photos and postcards, it also serves as a travel book.&lt;ref name=JewishPost-Review-1999&gt;{{cite news|last1=Silverman|first1=Marilyn|title=Jews Can Now Search for Their Polish Roots Miriam Weiner's Book Unlocks the Past|url=http://www.jewishpost.com/archives/news/jews-can-now-search-for-their-polish-roots-miriam-weiners-book-unlocks-the-past.html|work=Jewish Post of New York|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Warren Blatt]] from the [[JewishGen]] Kielce-Radom Special Interest Group (SIG) described the work as a tour de force and ground-breaking, a unique and timely masterpiece. In a detailed analysis, Blatt found the book provided information that was not previously available to genealogists.&lt;ref name=KielceRadomSIG-Review-1998&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blatt|first1=Warren|title=Book Review: Jewish Roots in Poland by Miriam Weiner|journal=The Kielce-Radom Special Interest Group Journal|date=Spring 1998|volume=2|issue=2|pages=21–24|url=http://jri-poland.org/kr-sig/journals/Kielce-Radom%20Journal_Vol%202,%20No%202_Spring%201998.pdf|location=Orlando, FL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JewishGen-JRiPoland-Review-1998&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blatt|first1=Warren|title=Jewish Roots in Poland - Book Review|url=https://www.jewishgen.org/InfoFiles/poland/MWeinerReview.htm|work=[[JewishGen]]|date=Spring 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marilyn Silverman of the ''[[Jewish Post of New York]]'' said ''Jewish Roots in Poland'' is the first Polish government-sanctioned book to document the holdings of the Polish State Archives that are of interest to Jewish genealogists. She sees the experience of discovering these documents as being both painful as well as inspiring a feeling of exhilaration, tied to survival.&lt;ref name=JewishPost-Review-1999 /&gt;

In the New York Jewish Genealogical Society, Inc.'s publication, ''DOROT,'' their review called ''Jewish Roots in Poland'' Weiner's magnum opus, noting the genealogical holdings as well as the capsule town descriptions of 28 towns with large Jewish populations pre-WWII.&lt;ref name=DOROT-Review-Poland-1997&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friedlander|first1=Alex E.|title=Book Reviews: Jewish Roots in Poland: Pages From the Past and Archival Inventories|journal=DOROT|date=Winter 1997|volume=19|issue=2|pages=12–13|url=http://www.jgsny.org/index.php/publications/dorot/dorot-archive/108-winter1997-1998/file|publisher=Jewish Genealogical Society, Inc.|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' highlighted the book's importance as an information resource as well as the feelings of poignancy and nostalgia captured in the many images throughout the work.&lt;ref name=NYTimes-JewsInPoland-1998&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blumenthal|first1=Ralph|title=Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Archives of Innocence|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/05/books/books-in-brief-nonfiction-archives-of-innocence.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=5 April 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Forward]]'' described how Weiner was able to organize the original archival material – which lacked a town-by-town inventory and was uncatalogued and inaccessible to genealogical purposes – into a user-friendly format, with the data becoming accessible and organized.&lt;ref name=Forward-ReviewJewishRootsPoland-1998&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rosenbaum|first1=Thane|title=An Ambitious Book Helps Jews Navigate the Complexities of Going Home|url=http://forward.com/culture/books/355839/an-ambitious-book-helps-jews-navigate-the-complexities-of-going-home/|work=[[The Forward]]|date=20 February 1998|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2640">'''''Joubert v Enslin'''''&lt;ref&gt;1910 AD 6&lt;/ref&gt; is an important case in [[South African contract law]], heard in the [[Cape Town]] Appellate Division on July 8, 9 and 22, [[1910 in South Africa|1910]].

== Golden rule of interpretation ==
The case is famous primarily for its articulation of the fundamental precept of [[South African contract law#Interpretation|contractual interpretation]] in [[South Africa]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The golden rule applicable to the interpretation of all contracts is to ascertain and to follow the intention of the parties; and, if the contract itself, or any evidence admissible under the circumstances, affords a definite indication of the meaning of the contracting parties, then it seems to me that a Court should always give effect to that meaning.&lt;ref&gt;37-38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Effect must be given, in other words, to the parties' common intention: "that is to say, to what both of them intended upon entering into the contract, and not to what the one or the other had in the back of his or her mind."&lt;ref&gt;Du Plessis ''et al'' 253.&lt;/ref&gt; This dictum suggests that the courts take a "factual or historical-psychological approach to interpretation, i.e. one which seeks to establish the intention of the parties as a fact existing at the time of contracting."&lt;ref&gt;Lubbe &amp; Murray 451.&lt;/ref&gt; This more or less accords with the subjective and consensual basis of the rest of the South African law of contract,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Saambou-Nasionale Bouvereniging v Friedman]]'' 1979 (3) SA 978 (A).&lt;/ref&gt; but it gives rise to a paradox, since the subjective intentions of the parties must be established with reference to certain objective factors,&lt;ref&gt;Du Plessis ''et al'' 268.&lt;/ref&gt; most obviously the [[South_African_contract_law#Ordinary_meaning|words printed on the contract]].

==History==
"In 1986 Landmarks was created by Founder and President, Ron Szpatura. The original product was a magazine-style publication that developed into to a four color hard bound publication. It was placed in 6,000 rooms in the Annapolis and surrounding area creating an annual readership of over 2 million visitors.

In 2000, the Landmarks hard bound publication ventured out to Szpatura’s [[alma mater]], the [[University of Virginia]], creating Landmarks of Charlottesville. From there [[Ocean City, Maryland]]; [[Rehoboth Beach, Delaware|Rehoboth]] and [[Wilmington, Delaware]]. Within three years 8 publications were being produced on an annual basis and nearly 100,000 rooms were hosting a Landmarks book, creating over 20 million Landmarks readers.

In 2001, Landmarks' Visitors Channel began. A dedicated channel is used in the hotel to play a 30 minute video, reset on a continuous loop, that is centrally located in the hotel and cabled out to each room through the TV system.

In 2006, an internet service with traveler information was added to Landmarks' product line as well as the Key Card booklet.

In 2008 the Prestige Partnership was added to share a different, business viewpoint of the area to visitors staying in the hotel rooms.

In 2009, Landmarks LIVE was created which plays in hotels in markets that have Landmarks’ Visitor Channel. Landmarks LIVE provides guests with information including weather and local events."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.landmarksmarketing.com/content/view/12/37/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Landmarks Great Deals was launched, offering daily deals to local businesses and restaurants with a general savings of 50%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.landmarksgreatdeals.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Landmarks acquired C-Ville Saver to penetrate the Charlottesville market with their Landmarks Great Deals website.

In 2014, Landmarks acquired HalfOff at the Beach, a local favorite of Delmarva, and Delaware Beach to enhance inventory as well as expand their reach to the market along the East Coast Beach towns.

'''Mail''' is an [[Email client|email and newsgroup client]] developed by [[Microsoft]] and included in the [[Windows Vista]], [[Windows 8|8]], [[Windows 8.1|8.1]], and [[Windows 10|10]] [[operating system]]s.&lt;ref name=Mary&gt;{{cite web |last1=Branscombe |first1=Mary |title=Mail in Windows 8.1: how Microsoft is finally giving it some power |url=http://www.techradar.com/us/news/software/operating-systems/mail-in-windows-8-1-how-microsoft-is-finally-giving-it-some-power-1163446 |accessdate=1 May 2015 |work=[[TechRadar]] |publisher=[[Future US]] |date=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Warren&gt;{{cite web |last1=Warren |first1=Thomas "Tom" |title=Windows 10 preview now includes new Outlook mail app and theme tweaks |url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/22/8471547/windows-10-preview-outlook-mail-calendar-apps |accessdate=1 May 2015 |work=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main function of Mail is sending and receiving email.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Set up Mail and add contacts |url=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows-8/add-accounts |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022072938/http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows-8/add-accounts |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-10-22 |work=Windows Help |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |accessdate=2015-08-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a successor to Outlook Express, which was either included with, or released for, the [[Windows 9x]] family and older versions of the [[Windows NT]] family.

Windows Mail was announced by Microsoft as the successor to Outlook Express on October 10, 2005, via its community website [[Channel 9 (Microsoft)|Channel 9]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=scobleizer |url= http://channel9.msdn.com/Showpost.aspx?postid=116711 |title=The new Outlook Express: Windows Mail demoed |publisher=Channel9.msdn.com |date=2005-09-16 |accessdate=2013-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This initial version featured fundamental changes and a new user interface, but not as much in the way of new features.&lt;ref name="Datamation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.datamation.com/entdev/article.php/3671106/Vista-Mail-vs-Outlook-Express.htm |title=Vista Mail vs. Outlook Express |last=Piltzecker |first=Tony |date=April 11, 2007 |publisher=''[[Datamation]]'' |accessdate=February 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Windows Vista==
[[File:Windows Mail Vista.png|thumb|A screenshot of Windows Mail displaying a user's Inbox folder|left]]
The origins of Windows Mail can be traced back to a pre-release version of Outlook Express 7 included in early builds of Windows Vista, then known by its codename, "Longhorn." This version of Outlook Express introduced various changes to the user interface&lt;ref name="Supersite"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://winsupersite.com/product-review/windows-longhorn-build-4051-gallery-3 |title=Windows Longhorn Build 4051 Gallery 3 |last=Thurrott |first=Paul |publisher=''Supersite for Windows'' |accessdate=February 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and relied on [[WinFS]] for the management and storage of contacts and other data.&lt;ref name="GetaGrip"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mcpmag.com/Articles/2004/02/01/Get-a-Grip-on-Longhorn.aspx?Page=2 |title=Get a Grip on Longhorn |last=Jennings |first=Roger |date=February 1, 2004 |publisher=''MVP Magazine'' |accessdate=February 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While retaining support for [[Post Office Protocol]] (POP) and [[Internet Message Access Protocol]] (IMAP) email protocols, Outlook Express 7 dropped support for [[HTTP]],&lt;ref name="WindowsDevCenter"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.windowsdevcenter.com/pub/a/windows/2004/05/18/longhorn.html?page=2 |title=A First Look at Longhorn |author=Wei-Meng Lee |date=May 18, 2004 |publisher=''[[O'Reilly Media]]'' |accessdate=February 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; an omission inherited by Windows Mail.&lt;ref name="SettingUpAnAccount"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/windows-mail-setting-up-an-account-from-start-to-finish |title=Windows Mail: Setting up an account from start to finish |author=Microsoft |accessdate=February 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Windows Mail's user interface is changed to match the look and feel of Windows Vista. Some interface features were imported from [[Microsoft Outlook|Microsoft Outlook 2003]], including the right-hand "reading pane". ''Microsoft Help Groups'' has been added, which is a preconfigured link to Microsoft's newsgroups.  Some additional functionality has been layered on top of the standard newsgroup functionality to have individual threads be marked as a "question" or an "answered question". Postings may be rated as well.

Windows Mail uses [[IPv6]] if the domain name for the servers resolves to IPv6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forskningsnett.uninett.no/ipv6/IPv6hostswindows.html |title=UNINETT: IPv6hostswindows |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227063601/http://forskningsnett.uninett.no/ipv6/IPv6hostswindows.html |archivedate=2008-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mail messages are now stored in individual files instead of in a single database file. A transactional index database based on the [[Extensible Storage Engine]] enables real-time searching and improves the stability and the reliability of the stored data.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} In case of corruption, the indices can be rebuilt from the mail files. Account setup information is no longer stored in [[Windows Registry]].  It is instead stored alongside the mail itself, making it possible to copy an entire Windows Mail configuration and mail store to another machine in a single step.

[[Bayesian spam filtering|Bayesian]] [[spam (electronic)|junk-mail]] filtering and top-level domain blocking and encoding blocking have been added. A [[phishing]] filter has been incorporated as well, protecting users from web sites that have been identified as being malicious.

Removed features from Windows Mail include:
* Support for [[WebDAV]] protocol

* Support for multiple ''Identities'', collection of configurations and email message that could be loaded independent of each other but could be switched at any time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/98c039d9-78d1-41c7-8ece-b505780d68701033.mspx|title=E-mail identities in Windows Mail|date=|website=Windowshelp.microsoft.com|accessdate=2013-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Support for spell checking dictionaries of Microsoft Office

Windows Mail has a documented [[application programming interface]] (API) based on [[Component Object Model]] (COM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms709546(VS.85).aspx |title=Windows Mail Programmability |publisher=Msdn2.microsoft.com |date=2011-06-30 |accessdate=2013-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; While its predecessor, Outlook Express, also featured an API, it was undocumented, except for [[Messaging API|Simple MAPI]] messaging functionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/239576 |title=Developer Support Limitations with Outlook Express |publisher=Support.microsoft.com |date=2005-06-25 |accessdate=2013-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Windows Vista only supports American English, French, German and Spanish (International Sort).

== Windows 7 ==
Windows Mail was absent from [[Windows 7]]. During this time, Microsoft intended to spin off several Windows components into independently developed apps introduced as part of the [[Windows Essentials]] software suite. Thus, Windows Mail was omitted in favor of [[Windows Live Mail]], which was made available for [[Windows XP]], Vista and 7. This policy was eventually reverted and the successors of the Windows Essentials apps were gradually reintegrated into Windows 8, 8.1 and 10 components. Windows Live Mail was succeeded by Mail.

==Windows 8.x==
Mail was added to Windows 8 as one of many apps written to run full-screen or snapped, per Microsoft's [[Metro (design language)|Metro design language]] philosophy. Being a [[Windows Store app]], Mail is included in the same app container as [[Calendar (Windows)|Calendar]] and [[People (Windows)|People]]. These three cannot be uninstalled or reinstalled separately. Mail in Windows 8 comes with preset server configurations for popular email services [[Outlook.com]], [[Microsoft Exchange Server|Exchange]], [[Gmail]], [[AOL Mail]], and [[Yahoo! Mail]]. Other IMAP accounts can be configured,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fixkb.com/2013/06/set-up-icloud-mail-account-on-the-windows-8-mail-app.html|title=Set up iCloud mail account on the Windows 8 mail app|date=19 June 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it does not directly support POP. Even though this app does not run on the Windows desktop, it has multi-window support. Like many Microsoft apps introduced for Windows 8, many of the features are hidden in [[Windows shell#Charms|the charms]] or an initially hidden [[toolbar]] at the bottom of the screen that is revealed by right-clicking. Users who have subscribed to a [[Microsoft account]] can sync all configurations of Mail across different computers.

==Windows 10==
Mail has preset server configurations for Outlook.com, Exchange, Gmail, [[iCloud]], and Yahoo! Mail.&lt;ref name="SetUpEmailinMail"&gt;{{cite web|title=Set up email in Mail for Windows 10|url=https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Set-up-email-in-Mail-for-Windows-10-7ff79e8b-439b-4b47-8ff9-3f9a33166c60|website=[[Office.com]]|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Casey|first1=Henry T.|title=How to Set Up iCloud Email and Calendars on Windows 10|url=http://www.laptopmag.com/articles/icloud-email-calendars-windows|website=LAPTOP|date=10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ACloserLook"&gt;{{cite web|title=A closer look at the new Mail app on Windows 10|url=http://mspoweruser.com/a-closer-look-at-the-new-mail-app-on-windows-10/|website=MSPoweruser|date=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; AOL Mail and custom IMAP accounts can still be added, and POP support is added back.&lt;ref name="SetUpEmailinMail" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ACloserLook" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stobing|first1=Chris|title=How to Configure a POP3 Email Account in Windows 10|url=http://www.howtogeek.com/226010/how-to-configure-a-pop3-email-account-in-windows-10/|website=How-To Geek|date=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mail and Calendar are still Windows Store apps and are in the same app container; as such they are updated together. But their third sibling, People, is moved out of this container and is a standalone app by itself. 

Users can set Windows 10 Mail to use the system theme or choose a custom accent color, background image, and light/dark preference. It has multi-window support and can open email messages in a new window.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/newest-windows-10-redstone-2-test-build-adds-new-outlook-mail-features/|title=Newest Windows 10 'Redstone 2' test build adds new Outlook Mail features|last=Foley|first=Mary Jo|date=25 October 2016|website=[[ZDNet]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emails are listed in Mail's jumplist. Mail uses a settings panel, email sorting tools in the second pane, and a toolbar in the viewing pane. Like the Vista version of Mail, this version's important controls are readily visible. Accounts can be grouped and relabeled, and folders can be created from within the app. Most existing folders can be edited or deleted in Mail, but default folders cannot be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://support.office.com/en-us/article/How-do-I-add-or-remove-folders-in-Mail-for-Windows-10-e30d69e1-16fd-45d1-b339-8a2a4db73ffe?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US|title=How do I add or remove folders in Mail for Windows 10? - Outlook|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible to use Outlook.com aliases and @mentions with Mail.

Like [[Microsoft Outlook]], Mail allows users to set up Quick Actions, such as Delete, Set Flag, and Archive, to respond to messages from system notifications and swipe gestures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-s-new-in-Mail-and-Calendar-for-Windows-10-9822b33c-b9ad-48bc-ac53-c1b6136e405b?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US&amp;fromAR=1|title=What's new in Mail and Calendar for Windows 10|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mail does not have an RSS reader and the ability to customize the default type and font. Microsoft has not announced plans to add these features.

==Heritage==
Like in [[Microsoft Outlook]] and [[Outlook Express]], Mail uses {{Key press|Ctrl|E}} to invoke search, contrary to all other Microsoft products that use {{Key press|Ctrl|F}}.

The '''Mauritshuis''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈmʌurɪtsɦœys}}; {{lang-en|Maurice House}}) is an [[art museum]] in [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]]. The museum houses the Royal Cabinet of Paintings which consists of 841 objects, mostly [[Dutch Golden Age painting]]s. The collections contains works by [[Johannes Vermeer]], [[Rembrandt van Rijn]], [[Jan Steen]], [[Paulus Potter]], [[Frans Hals]], [[Jacob van Ruisdael]], [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], and others. Originally, the 17th century building was the residence of count [[John Maurice of Nassau]]. It is now the property of the government of the Netherlands and is listed in the [[top 100 Dutch heritage sites]].

== History ==
[[File:Bartholomeus Johannes van Hove, Het Mauritshuis te Den Haag.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Mauritshuis in 1825.]]

In 1631, [[John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen]], a cousin of [[stadtholder]] [[Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange|Frederick Henry]], bought a plot bordering the [[Binnenhof]] and the adjacent [[Hofvijver]] pond in [[The Hague]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Location and garden |publisher=Mauritshuis |url=http://www.mauritshuis.nl/index.aspx?chapterid=2361 |accessdate=2008-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070306155621/http://www.mauritshuis.nl/index.aspx?chapterID=2361 |archivedate=March 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at that time the political centre of the [[Dutch Republic]]. On the plot, the Mauritshuis was built as a home between 1636 and 1641, during John Maurice's governorship of [[Dutch Brazil]]. The [[Dutch Baroque architecture|Dutch Classicist]] building was designed by the Dutch architects [[Jacob van Campen]] and [[Pieter Post]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The building |publisher=Mauritshuis |url=http://www.mauritshuis.nl/index.aspx?chapterid=2359 |accessdate=2008-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618214701/http://www.mauritshuis.nl/index.aspx?chapterid=2359 |archivedate=June 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two-storey building is strictly symmetrical and contained four apartments and a great hall. Each apartment was designed with an antechamber, a chamber, a cabinet, and a cloakroom. Originally, the building had a [[cupola]], which was destroyed in a fire in 1704.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 17th-century interior |publisher=Mauritshuis |url=http://www.mauritshuis.nl/index.aspx?ChapterID=2433&amp;ContentID=19491 |accessdate=2008-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719095401/http://www.mauritshuis.nl/index.aspx?ChapterID=2433&amp;ContentID=19491 |archivedate=July 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of Prince John Maurice in 1679, the house was owned by the Maes family, who leased the house to the Dutch government. In 1704, most of the interior of the Mauritshuis was destroyed by fire. The building was restored between 1708 and 1718.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fire and restoration |publisher=Mauritshuis |url=http://www.mauritshuis.nl/index.aspx?Chapterid=2364&amp;Contentid= |accessdate=2008-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719095529/http://www.mauritshuis.nl/index.aspx?Chapterid=2364&amp;Contentid= |archivedate=July 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1774, an art gallery open to the public was formed in what is now the [[Prince William V Gallery]]. That collection was seized by the French in 1794 and only partially recovered in 1808. The small gallery space soon proved to be too small, however, and in 1820, the Mauritshuis was bought by the Dutch state for the purpose of housing the Royal Cabinet of Paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mauritshuis is turned into a museum |publisher=Mauritshuis |url=http://www.mauritshuis.nl/index.aspx?ChapterID=2365&amp;ContentID=17655 |accessdate=2008-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719095537/http://www.mauritshuis.nl/index.aspx?ChapterID=2365&amp;ContentID=17655 |archivedate=July 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1822, the Mauritshuis was opened to the public and housed the Royal Cabinet of Paintings and the Royal Cabinet of Rarities. In 1875, the entire museum became available for paintings.&lt;ref name="Mauritshuis"/&gt;

The Mauritshuis was privatised in 1995. The foundation set up at that time took charge of both the building and the collection, which it was given on long-term loan. This building, which is the property of the state, is rented by the museum. In 2007, the museum announced its desire to expand. In 2010, the definitive design was presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.architectuur.org/nieuwsitem/1498/Mauritshuis_presenteert_voorlopig_ontwerp.html |title=Mauritshuis presenteert voorlopig ontwerp |website=Architectuur.org |date=22 June 2010|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum would occupy a part of the nearby Sociëteit de Witte building. The two buildings would be connected via an underground tunnel, running underneath the Korte Vijverberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denhaagcentraal.net/550/images/archief/DHC-012.pdf |title=Mauritshuis aast op De Witte |website=Den Haag Centraal |date=3 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130731082549/http://www.denhaagcentraal.net/550/images/archief/DHC-012.pdf |archivedate=July 31, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The renovation started in 2012 and finished in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/4512/Cultuur/article/detail/3234279/2012/04/01/Mauritshuis-vanaf-morgen-voor-twee-jaar-gesloten.dhtml |title=Mauritshuis vanaf morgen voor twee jaar gesloten |website=Trouw |accessdate=30 December 2013|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/kunst/article1393092.ece/Mauritshuis_wordt_nooit_een_hal |title=Mauritshuis wordt nooit een hal |date=23 June 2010 |website=De Volkskrant |accessdate=30 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626160026/http://www.volkskrant.nl/kunst/article1393092.ece/Mauritshuis_wordt_nooit_een_hal |archivedate=June 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the renovation, about 100 of the museum's paintings were displayed in the [[Gemeentemuseum Den Haag|Gemeentemuseum]] in the ''Highlights Mauritshuis'' exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gemeentemuseum.nl/en/exhibitions/highlights-mauritshuis |title=Highlights Mauritshuis |website=Gemeentemuseum |accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 50 other paintings, including the ''[[Girl With the Pearl Earring]]'', were on loan to exhibitions in the United States and Japan. The museum was reopened on 27 June 2014 by [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands|King Willem-Alexander]].&lt;ref name="reopened"&gt;{{nl icon}} Nando Kasteleijn, "[http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2014/06/27/het-mauritshuis-is-weer-open-deze-drie-dingen-moet-je-weten/ Het Mauritshuis is weer open.

==Collection==
{{details|List of artists in the collection of the Mauritshuis}}
The collection of paintings of stadtholder [[William V, Prince of Orange]] was presented to the Dutch state by his son, King [[William I of the Netherlands|William I]]. This collection formed the basis of the Royal Cabinet of Paintings of around 200 paintings. The collection is currently called the Royal Picture Gallery. The current collection consists of almost 800 paintings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the collection |publisher=Mauritshuis |url=http://www.mauritshuis.nl/index.aspx?chapterid=2353 |accessdate=2008-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618214655/http://www.mauritshuis.nl/index.aspx?chapterid=2353 |archivedate=June 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and focusses on Dutch and Flemish artists, such as [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder|Pieter Brueghel]], [[Paulus Potter]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Rembrandt van Rijn]], [[Jacob van Ruisdael]], [[Johannes Vermeer]], and [[Rogier van der Weyden]].

'''''Moondog''''' is a [[minimalism|minimalist]] sculpture created by [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]] in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;[http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=FX01327960E26.20894&amp;menu=search&amp;aspect=Keyword&amp;npp=50&amp;ipp=20&amp;spp=20&amp;profile=ariall&amp;ri=5&amp;source=%7E%21siartinventories&amp;index=.GW&amp;term=Moondog&amp;aspect=Keyword&amp;x=8&amp;y=9#focus "Moondog, (sculpture)"]. ''SIRIS''&lt;/ref&gt;  The piece is composed of 15 [[octahedron|octahedra]] and 10 [[tetrahedron|tetrahedra]], and while perfectly ordered and symmetrical when seen from certain angles, it carries a strong tilt forward when seen from other angles.  This is the third of an edition of three in the series (with one [[artist's proof]]).

The title refers to [[Joan Miró]]'s painting ''Dog Barking at the Moon'' and the name of a blind poet and composer named [[Moondog]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.paulacoopergallery.com/exhibitions/339&lt;/ref&gt;

It was installed at the [[Museum of Modern Art]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sculpture.org/documents/scmag98/tsmith/sm-tsmth.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1997, it showed at [[Paula Cooper Gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.paulacoopergallery.com/exhibitions/339&lt;/ref&gt;
The work currently resides in the [[National Gallery of Art Sculpture Garden]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nga.gov/feature/sculpturegarden/sculpture/sculpture12.shtm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Muhammad Saad Iqbal''' is a [[Pakistan]]i citizen who was held in [[extrajudicial detention]] in the [[United States]] [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]]s, in [[Cuba]].&lt;ref name=DoDList&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/pubs/foi/detainees/detainee_list.pdf list of prisoners (.pdf)], ''[[US Department of Defense]]'', April 20, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
Madni's Guantanamo [[Internment Serial Number]] was 743.
The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] reports that he was born on October 17, 1977.

Madni was arrested in [[Jakarta]] after he asked about the whereabouts of an American official, prompting accusations that he intended to assassinate the individual. After six months in captivity, he attempted suicide and was subsequently relabeled as "non-compliant" by his captors.

He was released in 2008 after six years imprisonment, and returned to Pakistan. His government said that he would not face any criminal charges, and that he was returning to his life.  On 19 August 2009, the UK arm of the legal charity [[Reprieve (organisation)#Reprieve UK|Reprieve]] commenced legal action on behalf of Madni, seeking information from the UK government about whether Madni had been rendered through [[Diego Garcia]].

===Transcript===

The Department of Defense published a 13 summarized transcript from his 2004 CSR Tribunal.&lt;ref name=CsrtHafezQariMohamedSaadIqbalMadni&gt;[{{DoD detainees ARB|Set_1_0001-0097.pdf#46}} Summarized transcripts (.pdf)] from [[Hafez Qari Mohamed Saad Iqbal Madni]]'s ''[[Combatant Status Review Tribunal]] - pages 46-58&lt;/ref&gt;

===Testimony===
&lt;!-- need more.  I just wanted to add the suicide link today --&gt;
Madni told his Tribunal that he was wearing [[Guantanamo captive's uniforms|the orange jumpsuit]] that non-compliant captives were made to wear because of a suicide attempt he had made on the 191st day of his detention.

But his dossier was not one of those the DoD published.

=== Administrative Review Board ===

Detainees whose [[Combatant Status Review Tribunal]] labeled them "enemy combatants" were scheduled for annual [[Administrative Review Board]] hearings.  These hearings were designed to assess the threat a detainee might pose if released or transferred, and whether there were other factors that warranted his continued detention.&lt;ref&gt;

The two page memo listed nine
"primary factors favor[ing] continued detention" and zero
"primary factors favor[ing] release or transfer".
Those factors included denunciations from unnamed informants that he claimed to be a member of al Qaida, that he plotted assassinations, that he was related to a female member of the extremist [[Ak Ikhwan Al Muslimoon Group]] in Indonesia, and that he had stated: 

{{quote|The detainee stated it was better to kill one U.S. Government Official than 100 Americans.}}

====Transcript====
Madni chose to participate in his Administrative Review Board hearing.&lt;ref name=ArbHafezQariMohamedSaadIqbalMadni&gt;[{{DoD detainees ARB|ARB_Transcript_Set_8_20751-21016.pdf#146}} Summarized transcript (.pdf)], from [[Hafez Qari Mohamed Saad Iqbal Madni]]'s ''[[Administrative Review Board]] hearing'', December 1, 2005 - page 146&lt;/ref&gt;

====Preliminary meeting with Assisting Military Officer====
Madni's preliminary meeting with his Assisting Military Officer took place on November 29, 2005.  Madni said he would attend.  His Assisting Military Officer described him as responsive, polite and attentive, during this meeting, but highly skeptical, based on his experience Combatant Status Review Tribunal.

===Second annual Administrative Review Board===
A [[Summary of Evidence (ARB)|Summary of Evidence memo]] was prepared for Hafes Qari Mohammed Saad Iqbal Madni's second
annual Administrative Review Board on October 19, 2005.&lt;ref name=Arb1Isn743&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The two page memo listed nine
"primary factors favor[ing] continued detention" and two
"primary factors favor[ing] release or transfer".

In addition to the allegations listed on the earlier memos the 2006 memo stated he had visited with members of al Qaida in Jakarta, Indonesia,
that he met the Secretary General of the [[Islamic Defenders Front]],
that he had seen weapons at the house of his new militant acquaintances, and he had been told about two failed terrorist attacks in which they had participated—an attempt to use a car bomb against the US embassy, and an attempt to attack an airliner.  One factor offered as a justification for his further detention stated:

{{quote|The detainee stated that because of his ability to memorize and sing the Koran at the age of twelve he became famous in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, he was introduced to presidents, kings and princes.  The detainee stated that he won approximately five million dollars in prize money from Koran competitions.}}

===Third annual Administrative Review Board===
A [[Summary of Evidence (ARB)|Summary of Evidence memo]] was prepared for Hafes Qari Mohammed Saad Iqbal Madni's
annual Administrative Review Board  on December 27, 2007.&lt;ref name=Arb3MemoIsn743&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The two page memo listed just four
"primary factors favor[ing] continued detention" and two
"primary factors favor[ing] release or transfer".

All four of the factors favoring his continued detention concerned a leadership role he played in a student group, the [[Sipah-e-Islam Pakistan]], which was an adjunct to a violent anti-Shi'a group, the [[Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan]].  The factors stated these two groups followed the [[Deobandi School]], and were created in reaction to the [[Iranian revolution]], and that the SSP group was behind the assassination of the Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan in the early 1990s.  More recently the groups organized political rallies.

The factors favoring his release or transfer stated that he feared being returned to Pakistan, and that:

{{quote|The detainee stated that with regard to his relationship to a known jihadists, he made a mistake when he got involved with bad people at a young age.}}

Earlier allegations that he personally was involved in hostile acts were all dropped in this memo.

====Third annual Board recommendations====
One January 9, 2009, the Department of Defense released two heavily redacted memos, from his Board, to [[Gordon R. England]], the [[Designated Civilian Official (OARDEC)|Designated Civilian Official]].&lt;ref name=Arb3RecommendationIsn743&gt;

The Board's recommendation was unanimous
The Board's recommendation was redacted.
England authorized his continued detention on March 17, 2008.

==Habeas corpus petition==
A writ of [[habeas corpus]] was filed on Hafez Qari Mohamed Saad Iqbal Madni's behalf.

===Military Commissions Act===
The [[Military Commissions Act of 2006]] mandated that Guantanamo captives were no longer entitled to access the US civil justice system, so all outstanding habeas corpus petitions were stayed.&lt;ref name=McaLetter2006-10-16&gt;

===Boumediene v. Bush===
On June 12, 2008 the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled, in [[Boumediene v. Bush]], that the [[Military Commissions Act of 2006|Military Commissions Act]] could not remove the right for [[Guantanamo captives]] to access the US Federal Court system.  And all previous Guantanamo captives' habeas petitions were eligible to be re-instated.
The judges considering the captives' habeas petitions would be considering whether the evidence used to compile the allegations the men and boys were enemy combatants justified a classification of "enemy combatant".&lt;ref name=BostonGlobe2008-10-24&gt;

Pakistani officials stated he would soon be released without charge, following a debriefing.
The ''Associated Press'' reported that Madni claimed he had tried to commit suicide during his first year in detention.

On September 19, 2008 [[Richard L. Cys]], [[James P. Walsh]] filed ''"Petitioner Muhammed Saad Iqbal Madni's response to court order to show cause why his petition should not be dismissed as moot"'', as part of [[05-CV-2385]], on behalf of [[Muhammed Saad Iqbal Madni]].&lt;ref name=Cv08-0442Doc457/&gt;
Madni's lawyers argued his habeas petition should not be dismissed because he was entitled to continue to seek relief if his original detention was not legally justified.  Further, his lawyer had not been advised of the conditions agreed upon by the US Government and the Pakistani Government:

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|
&lt;blockquote&gt;Undersigned counsel have no knowledge regarding the terms and conditions of the agreement under which Mr Madni's physical custody was transferred to Pakistan. Respondents have not submitted any evidence to the court regarding the nature of Mr Madni's transfer or his current status in Pakistan.  Accordingly, undersigned counsel does not know whether as part of his transfer the United States required that Mr Madni continue to be imprisoned, or after what period of time or under what conditions he might be released.  Furthermore, undersigned counsel does not know whether Mr. Madni has at all times since his transfer remained imprisoned in Pakistan.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 5 January 2009 the ''[[New York Times]]'' published a profile of Mohammed Saad Iqbal.&lt;ref name=NYTimes2009-01-06/&gt;
The profile chronicled serious health problems during and after his repatriation, and was illustrated with a picture of him standing in a [[Walker (mobility)|walker]].  The New York Times reported that senior US officials were prepared to confirm aspects of his account of himself—off the record.
They informed the New York Times that, shortly after he had apprehended in Jakarta, during his first two days of interrogation analysts had decided he was a braggart and "wannabe" and should be immediately released:

{{quote|He was a talker. He wanted to believe he was more important than he was.}}

He was first transferred for four months to a brutal interrogation center in [[Egypt]], where he was housed in a 4 x {{convert|6|ft|m|adj=on}} cell he said "like a grave", and subjected to electric shocks during his interrogation.&lt;ref name=NYTimes2009-01-06/&gt;
He was then transferred, for a year to the [[Bagram Theater Internment Facility]].

He described harassment from other captives because he had never trained in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=NYTimes2009-01-06/&gt;

[[Richard L. Cys]] of [[Davis Wright Tremaine]] is seeking relief for his long detention without charge, and for the release of his medical records, which may document his torture claims.&lt;ref name=NYTimes2009-01-06/&gt;

[[CIA]] spokesman [[Paul Gimigliano]] denied Madni had been subjected to illegal treatment:&lt;ref name=NYTimes2009-01-06/&gt;

{{quote|The agency's terrorist detention program has used lawful means of interrogation, reviewed and approved by the Department of Justice and briefed to the Congress.

On January 19, 2009, the ''[[Daily Times (Pakistan)|Daily Times]]'' reported that Iqbal had held a press conference in Islamabad where he demanded compensation for the treatment he received.&lt;ref&gt;

He declared that he and [[Mamdouh Habib]] had been sent to Egypt for interrogation.  His interrogators were all Egyptians, but Americans were always present, and passed notes to the Egyptian interrogators.
His interrogations include electric shock, beatings, being interrogated while drugged, and being locked in a cell so small he could not sit up, or lie down.
He and Habib were transferred to the [[Bagram Theater Internment Facility]], where he reported [[Koran desecration]] and brutal beatings.
In Bagram he was held in the same cell as [[Moazzam Begg]] and Ahmed Zaid Salem Zuhair.
three months of torture

He declared that as a consequence of his electric shocks to his head in Egypt he developed a life-threatening bone infection, but medical treatment was withheld because his interrogators characterized him as being uncooperative.  He declared he was confined the Psychiatric wing for six months—as punishment.

==UK Legal Action==
On August 19, 2009, the UK arm of the legal charity [[Reprieve (organisation)#Reprieve UK|Reprieve]] commenced legal action on behalf of Mr Madni against the UK [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]].&lt;ref&gt;Reprieve UK, [http://www.reprieve.org.uk/2009_08_19madnipressrelease New litigation filed in 'ghost prisoner' rendition case], August 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The litigation seeks

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5332">A '''music popularity index''' is a recorded [[music]] ranking, classified by popularity, which can be measured in many different ways. Nowadays, they are very common in musical websites, since they offer useful [[statistics]] suitable for many applications, such as musical recommendations. There are hundreds of methods to measure the popularity of an artist, and most [[websites]] have their own measurement system. The leading systems are as follows:

==Last.fm music charts==

===Features===

[[Last.fm]] is [[Internet]]'s reference to musical [[social networks]]. It has a huge [[database]], based on all the information provided by their users when they listen to music in different ways, storing all the information in their profiles.

Every week, [[Last.fm]] updates its music charts, based on all the information stored last week by the millions of users through the [[Audioscrobbler]] [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-in]] or the Last.fm radio. The [[website]] has many different charts, including Top Artists, Top Tracks, Top Albums, Weekly Top Artists and Weekly Top Tracks. The Top Tracks and the Top Albums of an artist are also available. In a user's profile we have his/her Top Tracks and Top Artists. All these information can be classified in different time periods, such as last week, last month, last 3 months, last 6 months, last year or overall.

===Main problems and uprising solutions===
Since the generated music charts depend on what the users register and on the tags from their music files, [[Last.fm]] made up a system based on the listens of the users which corrects a [[song]]'s tag if it differs from what most people registered. On the other hand, the system has errors, like not noticing the difference between two artists with the same name or not taking track length into consideration. Artists with many short tracks will have many more listens than artists with a few but very long ones.

==ReverbNation's Band Equity==

===Features===

The website [[ReverbNation]] also has joined the great amount of uprising musical social networks, contributing with their particular version. They developed a system to measure artists' popularity called Band Equity.

Band Equity measures popularity taking into account the interaction between the artist and the fans or listeners. Any artist registered in [[ReverbNation]] is measured automatically and the score is tracked over time. Band Equity compares artists with similar styles, so their progress can be benchmarked.

===What It Measures===
* ''Reach'': The number of unique people reached by the artist, found in social networks, blogs, home pages, etc. It takes into account the unique listeners, watchers of videos, registered fans, fans in the [[mailing list]], etc. It could be described as the total potential fan base, and captures an element of effort on the part of the artist and their fans to spread their content and reach more people.
* ''Influence'': Measures the reaction of those exposed to the artists' content. It takes into account the number of songs or videos played per listener, play-through percentage on songs, the total engagement time, etc. It could be described as the merit of the artist's content.
* ''Access'': The ability of the artist to access those fans directly, and message to them. This factor includes the rate at which listeners/friends convert to registered fans of the Artist or joining their [[mailing list]], giving the Artist the ability to speak to them directly. It could be described as the familiarity the Artist has with their fan base.
* ''Recency'': All of the factors before must be weighted by how they have occurred in time. Because of this, Band Equity can be used as a way to identify how promotional strategies affect fan relationships in the aggregate, helping to understand the reason behind and artist's popularity.

==BBC's Sound Index==
This was in beta testing during mid-2008, but closed down in July of that year.&lt;ref name=TC&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2008/05/20/bbcs-sound-index-is-good-but-we-wont-get-the-data/|title=BBC’s Sound Index is good, but we won’t get the data|publisher=eu.techcrunch.com
|accessdate=2011-11-22|last=Butcher|first=Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2011 the website still shows the beta trial as closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/switch/soundindex/|title=BBC - Switch - Sound Index|publisher=www.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2011-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[BBC]] created its own system called Sound Index, which measured the popularity of the top 1000 artists, based on discussions taken from:  [[Bebo]], [[Last.fm]], [[Google Groups]], [[iTunes]], [[Myspace]] and [[YouTube]]. The index updated every 6 hours, so it was easy to appreciate fluctuations in popularity. The more blog mentions, comments, listens, downloads or profile views an artist or track had the higher up in the [[Sound Index]] they were. The system also allowed the information to be filtered by sources, allowing an index only based on information coming from Last.fm, for example.&lt;ref name=TC /&gt;

The '''National Telephone Company''' (NTC) was a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] telephone company from 1881 until 1911 which brought together smaller local companies in the early years of the telephone. Under the [[Telephone Transfer Act 1911]] it was taken over by the [[General Post Office|General Post Office (GPO)]] in 1912.

== History ==
Three years after the first telephone company, ''[[The Telephone Company (Bells Patents) Ltd]].'', appeared in London (in fact it was the first in Europe), '''NTC''' was formed on 10 March 1881, as a provincial subsidiary of the United Telephone Company Limited (UTC). The NTC was initially formed to develop and operate telephone services in Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, Ulster and parts of Scotland, taking over UTC operations in those places.

The UTC developed other similar provincial companies throughout the British Isles between 1881 and 1885. The UTC then wished to create a new company for the amalgamation of all their associated companies. However, the government declined to issue the proposed new company with a licence to operate or to allow the transfer of an existing licence. The UTC then decided to use one of its provincial companies as a vehicle for their policy of amalgamation, starting in 1889 with the merger of the UTC with the Lancashire and Cheshire Telephone Company and the NTC. The 'National Telephone Company Limited' name being retained.

In 1886 it built an ornate red brick and [[Architectural terracotta|terracotta]] building [[17 &amp; 19 Newhall Street, Birmingham|19, Newhall Street]], now [[listed building|grade I listed]], for its Birmingham ''Central'' exchange, opened in 1887.

In 1899 it commissioned Telephone House in London's Temple Lane. The building still bears the company's NT logo and some cherubs holding what appear to be old style telephone handsets.

The amalgamation policy continued; in 1890 the NTC absorbed the Northern District Telephone Company and the South of England Telephone Company, in 1892 the Western Counties and South Wales Company and the Sheffield Telephone Exchange and Electric Light Company and in 1893 the Telephone Company of Ireland Limited. Throughout this period the NTC also took over smaller telephone companies.

With the policy of amalgamation, the NTC, under the direction of William E L Gaine as general manager and Dane Sinclair as engineer in chief, set about creating a uniform organisation over eight districts; Metropolitan, Southern, Western, Midland, North-Western, Northern, Scotland and Ireland.

Following the Telegraph Acts of 1892 and 1896, NTC trunk lines were acquired and transferred to the Post Office between 1896-97. In 1901, the  [[Postmaster General of the United Kingdom|Postmaster General]] and the NTC signed an agreement to prevent unnecessary duplication of plant and wasteful competition in London.

In 1905, the Postmaster General and the NTC signed a further agreement for the purchase of the NTC's system on the expiry of its licence on 31 December 1911, an option for the Post Office that formed a part of the original licence agreement of 1881. On 31 December 1911 the NTC ceased to formally trade. The Postmaster General took over the NTC and its telephone systems and the NTC passed into liquidation.

The National Telephone Company also issued stamps in various values to enable the public to pre pay for telephone calls made from company premises.

== Subject ==

Most of the chapters of the book deal with sex education as showing various sex positions and giving advice that told by whom were considered as experts on these subjects. The other chapters contain poetry (usually happens to be short) and urban tales, mostly using explicit and vulgar words&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.eg/books?id=S1pFDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=Nawāḍir+al-ayk+fī+maʻrifat+al-nayk&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lBWas0yQ1q&amp;sig=G8G6D6nvKKhu6I0nTdOzCXzQ4ms&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjmoPnE_p_cAhXHUlAKHV54ArsQ6AEITTAH#v=onepage&amp;q=Nawāḍir%20al-ayk%20fī%20maʻrifat%20al-nayk&amp;f=false|title=Al-Suyūṭī, a Polymath of the Mamlūk Period: Proceedings of the themed day of the First Conference of the School of Mamlūk Studies|last=Ghersetti|first=Antonella|publisher=Brill|year=2016|isbn=9789004334526|location=Venice, Italy|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some are attributed to well-known figures such as [[Abu Nuwas|Abu Nuuwas]], [[Ibn al-Rumi]], [[Al-Asmaʿi|Al-Asmaay]] and [[Al-Ṣafadī]]. Some old Arab scholars classified these kind of books as 'Ilm al-Bah (The Art of Coition). The book also has some chapters where there're tales about [[Homosexuality|homosexuals]] and [[Eunuch|eunuchs]], but in most occasions the author tries to go on the mainstream preferences of adult men at the time.

== Author controversy ==
Regarding the sensitive and explicit subjects mentioned in the book, most modern Islamic scholars condemn and believe it is impossible to accredit the manuscript to Al-Suyuti&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://islamqa.info/ar/182486|title=كتاب منسوب للحافظ السيوطي ! - islamqa.info|website=islamqa.info|language=ar|access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;, who is considered one of the most important figures in [[Sunni Islam]] literature. Some claim the attribution of the book is forged, and it was a scheme made by an anonymous writer to give the book authenticity to sell more copies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=فن النكاح في تراث شيخ الإسلام جلال الدين السيوطي - الكتاب الأول|last=كدر|first=جورج|publisher=Atlas Publishing|year=2011|isbn=9789953583129|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Other opinions say he may had this book written but at least he must have renounced it before he died.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fatwa.islamweb.net/fatwa/index.php?page=showfatwa&amp;Option=FatwaId&amp;Id=177313|title=حكم قراءة كتاب نواضر الأيك...|work=Islamweb إسلام ويب|access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://miqat-aldakera.com/?p=3131|title=شخصية السيوطي بين التاريخ والإيروتيكية.. {{!}} ميقات الذاكرة|website=miqat-aldakera.com|language=ar|access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though, there are some scholars who agreed to credit the book to Al-Suyuti.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fatwa.islamweb.net/fatwa/index.php?page=showfatwa&amp;lang=A&amp;Id=97517&amp;Option=FatwaId|title=مؤلف كتاب نواضر الأيك|work=Islamweb إسلام ويب|access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''night letter''' is an unsigned [[Leaflet (information)|leaflet]] distributed clandestinely.

==Afghanistan==
[[File:Taliban-night-letter.jpg|right|300px|thumb|A Taliban "night letter" discouraging cooperation with foreign forces.]]
Night letters have been a tactic employed by the [[Taliban]] and other extremist groups in Afghanistan to [[Taliban propaganda|intimidate supporters of secular government and education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/19/afghanistan.declanwalsh|title='Night letters' from the Taliban threaten Afghan democracy|last=Walsh|first=Declan|date=September 19, 2004|work=The Observer|location=Uruzgan, Afghanistan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iran==
{{main|Shabnameh}}
There is a history of ''shabnameh'' ("night letters") in Iran. Shabnameh were widely distributed in the 20th century in Iran over the course of several revolutionary movements.

==Israel==
In the late 1970s, Israeli peace activists belonging to the [[Shelly Party]], a small left-wing party then holding two seats in the [[Knesset]], distributed numerous such night letters in the postboxes of [[Tel Aviv]] houses. The leaflets contained eye-witness testimonies on severe [[human rights]] violations committed by [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] soldiers in the [[Israeli-occupied territories|Occupied Territories]], whose publication was forbidden by the military censorship. The leaflets were unsigned and at the time the party denied any connection with them. Only many years later did [[Uri Avnery]], at the time Knesset member for Shelly, admit to having composed the leaflets and organised their distribution, stating that this act was justified since the censorship had abused its power to withhold information from the public.

|}'''''Pilot''''' is a [[pilot boat]] and [[museum ship]] in [[San Diego]], [[California]]. She was launched in 1914 in San Diego, built in the local boatyard of Manuel Goularte. She is a 52-foot wooden diesel powered vessel. She was the first powered pilot boat in San Diego.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Baldwin |first=Scott |url=http://ohp.parks.ca.gov/pages/1067/files/pilot%20nrhp%20application12-09.pdf |format=pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration Form (draft) |website=[[National Park Service]] |date=10 December 2009 |accessdate=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She served as the official pilot boat of [[San Diego Bay]] for 82 years, with no more than three consecutive days of [[downtime]]. 

During [[World War II]], the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] used her as a pilot boat and [[patrol boat]]. She received six six-month service [[chevron (insignia)|chevron]]s. 

She was donated to the [[Maritime Museum of San Diego]] in 1996 and underwent restoration. ''Pilot'' now hosts educational tours of San Diego Bay, and sometimes accompanies other historic vessels (most notably, ''[[Star of India (ship)|Star of India]]'') into and out of the Bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sdmaritime.org/sd-harbor-pilot-boat/ |title=SD Harbor Pilot |website=[[San Diego Maritime Museum]] |accessdate=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5558">A '''quad chart''' is a form of [[technical documentation]] used to briefly describe an invention or other innovation through writing, illustration and/or photographs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.science.mod.uk/engagement/cde/quad_charts.aspx Quad Charts] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330062910/http://www.science.mod.uk/engagement/cde/quad_charts.aspx |date=March 30, 2013 }} at the [[Defence Science and Technology Laboratory]] official website. [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|British Ministry of Defence]]. Accessed February 19, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Such documents are described as "quad" charts because they are divided into four quadrants laid out on a landscape perspective.&lt;ref&gt;NASA Technical Memorandum, Issues 4192-4200, pg. 3. [[Ames Research Center]], 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bob Paladino, ''Innovative Corporate Performance Management: Five Key Principles to Accelerate Results'', pg. 300.

GAO-05-927, September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Though shorter, quad charts often serve in a similar capacity to [[white paper]]s and the two documents are often requested alongside one another.

==History==
Quad charts as a genre were developed by the [[United States Department of Commerce]]'s [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] in an attempt to improve budgeting and planning systems, and became widely used in the Administration's [[National Weather Service]].&lt;ref name=gao/&gt; The genre's development was parallel to that of [[display board]]s, also an early tool used by the NWS for staff communication.

In the early 2000s, software was developed to allow automated creation of quad charts as a means of saving time for [[technical writer]]s who would otherwise spend long periods of time drafting them.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
Both government agencies and large businesses often require submission of a quad chart on the part of potential contractors as part of the contract bidding process.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130413184846/https://www.dtrasubmission.net/help/quadchart.asp Quad Chart], [[Defense Threat Reduction Agency]]. Accessed February 19, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100814192100/http://www.science.mod.uk/Engagement/CDE/temp/quad_charts.aspx Engagement] at Centre for Defence Enterprise. Accessed February 19, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[NASA]], for example, uses quad charts to document the process of all [[Small Business Innovation Research]] projects.&lt;ref&gt;The [[United States National Research Council]]'s ''An Assessment of the Small Business Innovation Research Program at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration'', pg. 120. [[Washington, D.C.]]: [[National Academies Press]], 2009. {{ISBN|9780309124423}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because decision makers often review a large volume of both solicited and unsolicited proposals, the quad chart may be the only submission from a potential contractor which the decision maker actually reads.&lt;ref name=lab/&gt;

Due to the nature of quad charts as relatively short documents, there are opportunities for misuse. While quad charts are intended for brief overviews of a topic, they can also be misconstrued to influence public policy and budgeting decisions, as was the case with the politicization of the [[National Military Strategy (United States)|National Defense Strategy]]'s 2005 edition.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan P. Freier, "Present at the Counterrevolution: An Essay on the 2005 National Defense Strategy and Its Impact on Policy." Taken from the [[United States Army War College]] ''Guide to National Security Issues, Volume 2: National Security Policy and Strategy'', pgs. 120-121. Ed. J. Boone Bartholomees, Jr. 4th ed. July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
While there are no industry-wide standards for quad charts, there are a number of common elements. In addition to the title of the invention or idea and the name of the developer, the technical approach and the need which the invention or idea addresses are often included.&lt;ref name=lab/&gt; Decision makers often look to operational needs first, though including the cost and projected schedule are also often required elements.

The '''Ram Khamhaeng Inscription''', formally known as '''Sukhothai Inscription No.&amp;nbsp;1''', is a stone [[stele]] bearing inscriptions which have traditionally been regarded as the earliest example of the [[Thai script]]. Discovered in 1833 by King [[Mongkut]] (Rama IV), it was eventually deciphered and dated to 1292. The text gives, among other things, a description of the [[Sukhothai Kingdom]] during the time of King [[Ram Khamhaeng]], to whom it is usually attributed. The inscription had immense influence over the development of Thai historiography from the early 20th century, which came to regard Sukhothai as the first Thai kingdom.

From the late 1980s to 1990s, assertions that the stele was a forgery from a later date led to intense scholarly debate, which has not been definitely settled, though the majority of academics today regard it as at least partly authentic. The inscription is widely regarded as the single most important document in Thai history, and was inscribed on the [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World Register]] in 2003.

==Description and discovery==
[[File:201312131410b HL ps Sukothai, Noen Prasat.jpg|thumb|The inscription was discovered near the foundations of the old palace ruins, known as Noen Prasat, now in [[Sukhothai Historical Park]].]]
The stele is in the shape of a four-sided pillar, mostly square and {{convert|35.50|cm}} wide on each side, with a rounded pyramidal top. It is made of [[siltstone]]; the upper section which bears the inscriptions is polished, while the lower part, which probably fitted into a base, remains rough. It is {{convert|114.50|cm}} in total height.&lt;ref name="Nomination"&gt;{{cite web|author1=The Thai National Committee on Memory of the World Programme of UNESCO|title=Memory of the World Register Nomination Form: Thailand – The King Ram Khamhaeng Inscription|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/CI/CI/pdf/mow/nomination_forms/thailand_king_ram_khamhaeng_inscription.pdf|accessdate=8 December 2017|date=29 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bradley"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bradley|first1=Cornelius Beach|title=The Inscription of Phra Ram Khamhæng of Sukhothai, 1293 A.D.|journal=Journal of the Siam Society|date=April 1909|volume=6|issue=1|pages=1–72|url=http://www.siamese-heritage.org/jsspdf/1904/JSS_006_1b_Bradley_OldestKnownWritingInSiamese.pdf|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stele was discovered in 1833 by Prince Mongkut, who would later become King in 1851 and was at the time ordained as a monk.&lt;ref name="Griswold &amp; Prasert" /&gt; Mongkut had made a pilgrimage to the ancient town of [[Sukhothai (city)|Sukhothai]], where among the ruins of the old palace he discovered the stele, as well as a carved stone slab believed to be the throne of the Sukhothai ruler. He had his retinue bring the objects back to Bangkok, and they were placed in Wat Samo Rai (now named [[Wat Rachathiwat]]) where he was residing. The inscription followed Mongkut to [[Wat Bowonniwet]] in 1836, and was later moved to the [[Grand Palace]]'s [[Dusit Maha Prasat Throne Hall]] in 1911. It was again moved to the [[Vajirayana Library]] in 1924, and was finally acquired by the [[Bangkok National Museum]] in 1968, where it is currently on permanent exhibition.&lt;ref name="Nomination" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Griswold &amp; Prasert"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Griswold|first1=A.B.|author2=Prasert na Nagara|title=Epigraphic and Historical Studies No.9 : The Inscription of Ramkamhaeng of Sukhothai (1292 A.D.)|journal=Journal of the Siam Society|date=July 1971|volume=59|issue=2|pages=179–246|url=http://www.siamese-heritage.org/jsspdf/1971/JSS_059_2k_GriswoldPrasert_InscriptionOfKingRamaGamhenOfSukhodaya1292.pdf|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deciphering==
[[File:Ram Khamhaeng Inscription (detail).jpg|thumb|Detail, showing the characters]]
Mongkut made initial studies of the inscription, and in 1836 established a commission, headed by monk-Prince Roek (who would later become Supreme Patriarch and hold the title [[Pavares Variyalongkorn]]), to handle its deciphering. In 1855, Mongkut (now king) presented a lithographic copy of the inscription, with annotations giving partial translations and a letter explaining its significance, to the British envoy [[John Bowring]], and another copy was presented to the French envoy [[Charles de Montigny]] in 1856.&lt;ref name="Griswold &amp; Prasert" /&gt;

The first attempted translation of the text into a Western language was published by the German polymath [[Adolf Bastian]] in 1864. French missionary Père Schmitt published his translation in 1884 and 1885, with further revisions in 1895 and 1898. Also in 1898, the first Thai-language work on the inscription was published in the Vajirayana Magazine. A transliteration of the entire inscription into the modern Thai script was printed as a pamphlet for Crown Prince [[Vajiravudh]]'s tour of the old Sukhothai Kingdom in 1908.&lt;ref name="Griswold &amp; Prasert" /&gt;

In 1909, [[Cornelius Beach Bradley]], Professor of Rhetoric at the [[University of California]] and an expert on the Siamese language, published an English-language translation of the inscription,&lt;ref name="Bradley" /&gt; which was later described as "the first reasonably satisfactory translation" of the inscription into a Western language. An authoritative transcription and translation (into French) was later made by [[George Cœdès]], and published in 1924.&lt;ref name="Griswold &amp; Prasert" /&gt; Revisions published by A.B. Griswold and [[Prasert na Nagara]] in 1971&lt;ref name="Griswold &amp; Prasert" /&gt; and the National Library in 1977 improved upon Cœdès's version, and Winai Pongsripian published the most recent Thai transliteration in 2009.&lt;ref name="Trongjai"&gt;{{cite web|author=Trongjai Hutangkura|title=King Ramkhamhaeng Inscription|url=http://www.sac.or.th/en/cultural-heritage/critical-analysis-king-ramkhamhaeng-inscription|website=www.sac.or.th|publisher=Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn Anthropology Centre|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inscription contains 35 lines of text on its first and second sides, and 27 on the third and fourth. The script used is an early form of the [[Thai script]] (also known as Siamese), which differs vastly from modern Thai and bears some resemblance to ancient [[Khmer script|Khmer]], from which it is considered to have been adapted. Most significantly, the script contains no above- or below-line vowel marks, a feature seen in later Sukhothai inscriptions and modern Thai, as well as earlier [[Indic script]]s.&lt;ref name="Griswold &amp; Prasert" /&gt;

The text consists of three sections written continuously without distinct breaks. The first (lines 1–18 of the first side), which is written in the first person, tells the personal history of Ram Khamhaeng's early life up until his becoming ruler. The second (line 18 of the first side to line 11 of the fourth side) describes various aspects of the city of Sukhothai and its customs, including its abundance, people's freedoms, the ruler's justice, religious practices, and physical and geographical features. It ends by telling of Ram Khamhaeng's installation of a stone throne in the year 1214 of the [[Saka era]] (MS; corresponding to 1292&amp;nbsp;CE), enshrinement of relics at [[Si Satchanalai]] in MS&amp;nbsp;1207 (1285&amp;nbsp;CE) and his invention of the script in MS&amp;nbsp;1205 (1283&amp;nbsp;CE). The section refers to Ram Khamhaeng by name throughout. The third section (lines 11–27 of the fourth side) contains praise of the king and describes the reach of his kingdom. This final epilogue, which may have served as a eulogy, is written in a different hand, with some differences in spelling, indicating that it was most likely a later addition.&lt;ref name="Griswold &amp; Prasert" /&gt;

According to Cœdès, the inscription was probably made to commemorate Ram Khamhaeng's installation of the stone throne in 1292, and this is the year to which it is generally dated.&lt;ref name="Griswold &amp; Prasert" /&gt; The inscription, which paints a picture of a plentiful kingdom ruled paternally by a benevolent king, was extremely influential in the development of Thai history. Based on works by Prince [[Damrong Rajanubhab]] during the 1910s–1920s, Sukhothai came to be regarded as the first Thai capital, a golden age during which Thai values flourished (as opposed to later Khmer-influenced [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]]). This official view is taught in schools and formed the core of mainstream Thai history-writing throughout the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thongchai Winichakul|editor1-last=Grabowsky|editor1-first=Volker|title=Southeast Asian historiography unravelling the myths : essays in honour of Barend Jan Terwiel|date=2011|publisher=River Books|location=Bangkok, Thailand|isbn=9789749863978|pages=33–35|chapter=Siam’s Colonial Conditions and the Birth of Thai History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In July 1987, historian [[Michael Vickery]] presented a paper titled "The Ram Khamhaeng Inscription: A Piltdown Skull of Southeast Asian History?" at the International Conference on Thai Studies at the Australian National University, in which he questioned the authenticity of the inscription.&lt;ref name="Terwiel 2007" /&gt; He made several points supporting his claim that the inscription was created at a much later date than 1292, including the script's differences from other inscriptions. His position was supported, most notably, by art historian [[Piriya Krairiksh]], who published, in Thai in August 1988, further arguments that the stele was a forgery by Mongkut himself. The claims—shocking for the implication that most of Thai history would have to be rewritten—led to intense, often heated, scholarly debate, joined by dozens of academics both making rebuttals as well as giving support.&lt;ref name="Terwiel 2007" /&gt; Numerous seminars were held, and the debate continued through several publications, including a special volume (in Thai) published by ''[[Art &amp; Culture]] (Silpa Wattanatham)'' magazine in 1988&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Sujit Wongthes|editorlink=Sujit Wongthes|title=จารึกพ่อขุนรามคำแหง ใครแต่งกันแน่? "ของจริง" หรือ "ของปลอม"|date=1988|publisher=Sinlapa Watthanatham|location=Bangkok|isbn=9748350843|language=th}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a compilation of English-language articles published in 1991 by the [[Siam Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Chamberlain|editor1-first=James R.|title=The Ram Khamhaeng controversy : collected papers|date=1991|publisher=Siam Society|location=Bangkok|isbn=9789748359175}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Terwiel 2007"&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Terwiel|first1=Barend Jan|title=Using Ockham's Razor with respect to the Ram Khamhaeng Controversy|conference="Breaking the Bonds" Hamburg 24–26 November 2006|date=January 2007|url=https://www.academia.edu/9903229/Using_Ockhams_Razor_with_respect_to_the_Ram_Khamhaeng_Controversy|accessdate=8 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although counter-arguments were made to address the claims, and a 1990 analysis using [[scanning electron microscopy]] and [[energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] found the Ram Khamhaeng stele to be the same age (700–500 years) as four other Sukhothai inscriptions, several proponents remain convinced of the forgery theory, and the debate has not been definitely settled.&lt;ref name="Terwiel 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An overview of the controversy is presented in {{cite book|author=Mukhom Wongthes|title=Intellectual might and national myth : a forensic investigation of the Ram Khamhaeng controversy in Thai society|date=2003|publisher=Matichon Public Co.|location=Bangkok, Thailand|isbn=9789743230370}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the inscription was successfully submitted to the UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme, and was inscribed on its register in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The King Ram Khamhaeng Inscription|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-8/the-king-ram-khamhaeng-inscription/|website=UNESCO website|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=8 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The intense scrutiny and analysis also led to a much richer body of scholarship on the inscription, and several new theories have been proposed regarding its purpose and the exact circumstances of its creation. However, while it has been observed that "the Thai academic world showed a refreshing open-mindedness" in its response to the claims,&lt;ref name="Terwiel 2007" /&gt; the public has sometimes responded with hostility. A 2004 publication in a Thai newspaper by Piriya and British expatriate author Michael Wright (also a proponent of the forgery theory) led to angry protests in Sukhothai and threats by a politician to have them prosecuted for [[Lèse majesté in Thailand|defaming the kings]] and harming national security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Berger|first1=Sebastien|title=The Thai icon, the curse, the king and I|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/thailand/1467694/The-Thai-icon-the-curse-the-king-and-I.html|accessdate=15 December 2017|work=The Telegraph|date=23 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1452">Referent power is gained by a leader who has strong interpersonal relationship skills.

Referent power, as an aspect of personal power,  becomes particularly important as organizational leadership is increasingly about collaboration and influence rather than command and control.

In an organizational setting, referent power is most easily seen in the charismatic leader who excels in making others feel comfortable in his or her presence. Staff typically express their excitement about work in terms of their attraction to their leader's personal characteristics and charisma. The reason they commit to their work is because of the leader's likability and they base their self-esteem and sense of accomplishment on their leader's approval.

'''ResearcherID''' is an identifying system for scientific [[authors]]. The system was introduced in January 2008 by [[Thomson Reuters]].

This unique identifier aims at solving the problem of author identification. In scientific literature it is common to cite name, surname, and initials of the authors of an article. Sometimes, however, there are authors with the same name, with the same initials, or the journal misspells names, resulting in several spellings for the same authors, and different authors with the same spelling.

On the ResearcherID website, authors are asked to link their ResearcherID to their own articles. In this way, they can also keep their publication list up to date and online. A comprehensive view of an author's total output can thus be given, since not all publications are indexed by [[Web of Science]]. This is particularly important for researchers in fields that predominantly use [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] conference articles ([[computer science]]) or in fields that focus on publishing books and chapters in books ([[humanities]] and disciplines in the [[social sciences]]).

The combined use of the [[Digital object identifier|Digital Object Identifier]] with the ResearcherID allows a unique association of authors and scientific articles. It can be used to link researchers with registered trials or identify colleagues and collaborators in the same field of research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1126/science.323.5922.1662| volume = 323| issue = 5922| pages = 1662–1664| last = Enserink| first = Martin| title = SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHING: Are You Ready to Become a Number?| journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]]| date = 2009-03-27| url = | pmid = 19325094}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ResearcherID has been criticized for being commercial and proprietary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Wolinsky | first = Howard | title = What's in a name? | journal = EMBO Reports | volume = 9 | issue = 12| pages = 1171–1174| year = 2008 | doi = 10.1038/embor.2008.217 | pmid = 19047988 | pmc = 2603453}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also praised as "an initiative addressing the common problem of author misidentification".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60931-9| issn = 0140-6736| volume = 371| issue = 9631| pages = 2152–2153| last = Cals| first = Jochen WL|author2=Daniel Kotz | title = Researcher identification: the right needle in the haystack| journal = [[The Lancet]]| accessdate = 2009-09-22| date = 2008-06-28| url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6T1B-4SVF3XY-7/2/6823f4d70422527b9ea15715d35b7d4e| pmid=18586158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ResearcherID enables data exchange between its database and [[ORCID]], and vice versa.&lt;ref name="ORCID"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wokinfo.com/researcherid/integration/|title=RID - ORCID Integration - IP &amp; Science - Thomson Reuters|accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{One source|date=May 2011}}
'''Reverse domain name notation''' (or '''reverse-DNS''') is a naming convention for the components, packages, and types used by a programming language, system or framework. A characteristic of reverse-DNS strings is that they are based on registered [[domain name]]s, and are only reversed for sorting purposes. For example, if a company making a product called "MyProduct" has the registered [[domain name]] "example.com", they could use the reverse-DNS string "com.example.MyProduct" to describe it. Reverse-DNS names are a simple way of reducing name-space collisions, since any domain name is registered by only one party at a time.

==History==
Most of the world follows the Internet standard and writes email addresses starting with the name of the computer and ending up with the name of the country. In the U.K. the Joint Academic Networking Team (JANET) had decided to do it the other way round before the Internet domain standard was established. Most gateway sites have ad-hockery in their mailers to handle this, but can still be confused. In particular, the address me@uk.ac.bris.pys.as could be interpreted in JANET's big-endian way as one in the U.K. (domain uk) or in the standard little-endian way as one in the domain as (American Samoa) on the opposite side of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Jargon File: Big-endian&lt;/ref&gt;


Reverse-DNS first became widely used with the [[Java platform]], and has since been used for other systems, for example, [[ActionScript 3]] packages and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] applications.{{Citation needed|reason=need a source for the chronology and why they're particularly historic|date=January 2013}}

==Examples==
Examples of systems that use reverse-DNS are [[Sun Microsystems]]' [[Java platform]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[Uniform Type Identifier]] or UTI. The [[Android (operating system)|Android]] operating system also makes use of the notation for classifying applications, as the [[Dalvik (software)|Dalvik]] virtual machine made use of Java.

[[dconf]] which is the configuration [[Front and back ends|back end]] used by [[GNOME]].

Example of reverse-DNS strings are:
* com.adobe.postscript-font ([[Uniform Type Identifier|UTI]] string for [[Adobe Systems]]'s [[PostScript]] fonts)
* com.apple.ostype ([[Uniform Type Identifier|UTI]] string for [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[OSType]])
* org.omg.CORBA ([[Java (programming language)|Java]] library for [[Common Object Request Broker Architecture|CORBA]])
* org.w3c.dom ([[Java (programming language)|Java]] library for [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]]'s [[Document Object Model|DOM]])

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2379">The so-called '''Scheibler Armorial''' (''Scheiblersches Wappenbuch'', [[Bayerische Staatsbibliothek]], Cod.icon. 312 c) is an [[armorial]] manuscript
compiled, in two separate portions, over the course of the   15th to 17th centuries.
It is named for its first known private owners, the [[Freiherr|baronial]] Scheibler family of [[Hülhoven]] in the [[Rhineland]].

The first part can be dated to the later 15th century, ca. 1450&amp;ndash;1480. It contains a total of 476 coats of arms.
The second part, compiled during the 16th to early 17th centuries, adds 148 additional complete coats of arms, for a total of 624, not including 62 delineated coats of arms left empty.
Page numbers and a register in alphabetic order were added in the late 17th century.

The collection includes coats of arms of noble families from much across the [[Holy Roman Empire]], predominantly its southern areas, categorised as [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavaria]], [[Swabia]] and [[Alsace]], [[Franconia]], the [[Rhineland]] and the [[Low Countries]],   [[duchy of Saxony|Saxony]], [[Margravate of Meissen|Meissen]] and [[Silesia]], [[Duchy of Austria|Austria]], [[Styria]], [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]], [[Turgovia]] and [[Three Leagues|Raetia Curiensis]]. The younger part introduces the additional, more specific categories of [[Hegau]], [[Lake Constance]], [[Old Swiss Confederacy |Swiss]],  [[Breisgau]], [[Allgäu]],  [[Westphalia]], [[Ill (Vorarlberg)|Walgau]], [[Margraviate of Moravia|Moravia]] and  [[kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]].

'''Sobi2''' (formerly written as '''SOBI2''') is the abbreviation of '''Sigsiu Online Business Index 2'''. Sobi2 is a free of charge [[open-source software|open-source]] [[web directory]] component and [[content construction kit]] (CCK) for the [[Joomla]]! [[content management system]] (CMS). Sobi2 is written in the programming language [[PHP]], also makes use of [[Javascript]] and requires the [[MySQL]] database environment for storage. It is best suited for low to medium-level traffic web-sites. 
Sobi2's development has been discontinued in 2011, when its successor, [[SobiPro]] comes out.

Sobi2 was listed in the Joomla! Extensions Directory &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Joomla Extensions Directory |url=http://extensions.joomla.org/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; until all extensions for Joomla! 1.5 were removed in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2013-02-06 |title=JED 1.5 Version Support Ends |url=https://community.joomla.org/blogs/leadership/1716-jed-15-version-support-ends.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The listing still can be found in the Web Archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sobi2 in Joomla! Extensions Directory (Web archive)|url=http://archive.extensions.joomla.org/extensions/directory-a-documentation/directory/1113|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827055957/http://archive.extensions.joomla.org/extensions/directory-a-documentation/directory/1113|archivedate=2013-08-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a component for [[Joomla!]] (up to version 1.5), Sobi2 made it possible to run and manage a directory in a Joomla! [[website]]. Sobi2 has features that made it stand out from other directory components at that time. It could be used as a web directory or as a directory to physical locations, like golf courses. It has a built-in integration with [[Google Maps]] (API key from [[Google]] is required).

Sobi2 was built with a modular concept, where additional functionality was added via plug-ins. The Joomla extensions directory listed over 80 plug-ins for Sobi2 at that time.

==Directory Component for Joomla==
Sobi2 is an open source directory component for [[Joomla]]! (up to version 1.5), an [[open-source software|open-source]] [[content management system]]. Using Sobi2 a [[Joomla]] user can have a directory of contacts, members, distributors, manufacturers, locations, products, or whatever very quickly with little or no "coding" - most or all of the set-up may be done using only the configuration interface. Add data, to produce a working directory on the Joomla web site.

==History==
In 2006 [[Sigsiu.NET]] developed a [[Content Construction Kit]] for Joomla. Designed as a business directory (online business index), Sobi2 could be used for every kind of directory.

Sobi2 has been designed as the follower of the SOBI component but it is not based on SOBI. It has been built up new from the bottom because the table structure of SOBI was not suited for the new features implemented in Sobi2. Sobi2 is built up almost [[object oriented]]. It runs under [[PHP]]4 and [[MySQL]]4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2009-09-01 |title=Component description on the official homepage |url=https://www.sigsiu.net/sobi2-component }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sobi2's development has been discontinued in 2011, when its successor, [[SobiPro]] came out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Difference between Sobi versions |url=https://www.sigsiu.net/center/sobipro-component/209-difference-between-sobi-versions }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2011-02-28 |title=SobiPro RC1 ready to download |url=https://www.sigsiu.net/news/383-sobipro-rc1-ready-to-download }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Sobi2 is an add-on (component) to [[Joomla]]! (up to version 1.5) that makes it possible to run and manage a directory in your [[Joomla]]! website.

To add listings to the directory, an input form needs to be filled out.

While setting up the directory, the input form is built by the site developer using the integrated fields manager to add the various field types (text input fields, text areas (w/o [[WYSIWYG]] editor), check boxes, check box groups, select lists (drop down), simple text fields or calendar fields) to the form. The layout of the form can be changed by the usage of the built-in [[Template engine (web)|template]] engine.

During installation, Sobi2 creates input fields for a [[business directory]]. They can be changed, deleted or extended by additional fields.

There is an option to make features of the listings paid for or free. E.g. listings could be free but charge for links to the websites. This is decided when setting up and managing the component.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2007-12-28 |title=Creating portal with Joomla and Sobi2 in mycmsblog.com |url=http://cmacws.wordpress.com/2014/05/22/community-portal-iqaluitonline-com/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The administrator of the directory site is able to create, edit or delete listings within the Sobi2 administration panel.

Listings within a Sobi2 directory are assigned to one or more categories. A category manager allows to create, edit and delete categories within the directory with an unlimited nesting depth.

As a complex [[Joomla]]! component, Sobi2 has different views to present its data. In an overview all directory listings are shown with their smaller description, linked to a detailed description. Other views are available (e.g. alpha, search, user listings).

Especially for directories with paid listings, but also to keep the directory up to date, Sobi2 has the possibility to associate the listings with an expiration date. Once expired, listings can be renewed.

Sobi2 can be used "out of the box" or adapted individually to the site. It provides a [[Style sheet (web development)|style sheet]] file ([[CSS]]) which can be edited in the administration panel, using an editor with syntax highlighting.

For advanced adaptations there are separate templates available for the different views.

Sobi2 sends out [[email]]s on different events (add, edit, renew, approval). Sending out an [[email]] can be set up separately for each event. The content of the emails can be defined using placeholders, separately for each event.

Sobi2 has integrated diagnosis systems to log occurring problems. A template parser is helpful in finding syntactical errors while developing own templates. A built-in system check detects if a server does not meet the requirements for Sobi2. A version checker checks for newer versions.

'''Additional Features'''
* Dynamical page title generation ([[Search Engine Optimization|SEO]]).
* Listing dependent meta data ([[Index term|keywords]] and description).
* Configurable search function with built-in category search.
* [[RSS]] feeds generation of the whole directory, each category view, newest, most popular or random listings.
* Built-in multi state [[cache (computing)|cache]] system for fast retrieving of data.
* Built-in [[:wikt:template|template]] system for creating templates for the main views.
* Integration of [[Paypal]] for paid listings.
* Integration of [[Google Maps]] directly in the detailed view.
* Modules, [[Joomla]]! and Sobi2 plug-ins are available to extend the possibilities of Sobi2.

==Plug-in interface==
To enhance the functionality of Sobi2, there were more than 80 different plug-ins available and listed in the Joomla! Extensions Directory at that time. These listings still can be found in the Web Archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sobi2  plug-ins in Joomla! Extensions Directory (Web archive)|url=http://archive.extensions.joomla.org/extensions/extension-specific/sobi2-extensions|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825135627/http://archive.extensions.joomla.org/extensions/extension-specific/sobi2-extensions|archivedate=2013-08-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Systemic Census of Australian Plants.PNG|right|thumb|The title page of the census]]

The '''''Systematic census of Australian plants, with chronologic, literary and geographic annotations''''', more commonly known as the '''''Systematic Census of Australian Plants''''', also known by its standard botanic abbreviation '''''Syst. Census Austral. Pl.''''',&lt;ref name="IPNI"&gt;{{cite web | title = Systematic census of Australian plants … | work = [[IPNI]] | url = http://www.ipni.org/ipni/idPublicationSearch.do?id=5805-2 | accessdate = 2007-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a survey of the [[vascular plant|vascular]] [[flora of Australia]] prepared by Government [[botanist]] for the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] [[Ferdinand von Mueller]] and published in 1882.

Von Mueller describes the development of the census in the preface of the volume as an extension of the seven volumes of the ''[[Flora Australiensis]]'' written by [[George Bentham]]. A new flora was necessary since as more areas of Australia were explored and settled, the flora of the [[Australia (continent)|island-continent]] became better collected and described. The first census increased the number of described species from the 8125 in ''Flora Australiensis'' to 8646.&lt;ref name = "Orchard"/&gt; The book records all the known species indigenous to Australia and [[Norfolk Island]]; with records of species distribution. 

Von Mueller noted that by 1882 it had become difficult to distinguish some introduced species from native ones:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The lines of demarkation between truly indigenous and more recently immigrated plants can no longer in all cases be drawn with precision; but whereas ''[[Alchemilla vulgaris]]'' and ''[[Veronica serpyllifolia]]'' were found along with several European Carices in untrodden parts of the [[Australian Alps]] during the author's earliest explorations, ''[[Alchemilla arvensis]]'' and ''[[Veronica peregrina]]'' were at first only noticed near settlements. The occurrence of ''[[Arabis glabra]]'', ''[[Geum urbanum]]'', ''[[Agiimonia eupatoria]]'', ''[[Eupatorium cannabinum]]'', ''[[Cavpesium cernuum]]'' and some others may therefore readily be disputed as indigenous, and some questions concerning the nativity of various of our plants will probably remain for ever involved in doubts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Mueller, F. | year = 1882 | title = Systematic census of Australian plants | publisher = Victorian Government | authorlink = Ferdinand von Mueller}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1889 an updated edition of the census was published, the ''Second Systematic Census'' increased the number of described species to 8839.&lt;ref name = "Orchard"&gt;Orchard, A. E. 1999. Introduction. In A. E. Orchard, ed. ''Flora of Australia - Volume 1'', 2nd edition pp 1-9. Australian Biological Resources Study {{ISBN|0-643-05965-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Von Mueller dedicated both works to [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]] and [[A. P. de Candolle]].

The work is of historic significance as the first Australian flora written in Australia. Following its publication, research and writing on the flora of Australia has largely been carried out in Australia.&lt;ref name = "Orchard"/&gt;

'''''The Well-Spoken Thesaurus''''' by Tom Heehler ([[Sourcebooks]] 2011), is an American [[style guide]] and speaking aid. The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' calls ''The Well-Spoken Thesaurus'' "a celebration of the spoken word".&lt;ref&gt;Chicago Tribune http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/tribu/ct-tribu-words-work-wellspoken-20110907,0,1324710.story&lt;/ref&gt; The book has also been reviewed in the ''[[Winnipeg Free Press]]'',&lt;ref name=winnipeg&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/life/speech-therapy-127816198.html|title=Speech therapy|last=Vesely|first=Carolyn|date=1 August 2011|work=[[Winnipeg Free Press]]|accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by bloggers at the ''[[Fayetteville Observer]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Fayetteville Observer http://blogs.fayobserver.com/rundus/August-2011/Spoken-English-Bespoken-by-A-Young-Harvard-Univers&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Seattle Post-Intelligencer http://blog.seattlepi.com/thewritersblock/2011/05/20/book-review-the-well-spoken-thesaurus/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==

The book consists of two sections—a 50-page style guide entitled "Rhetorical Form and Design", and a 350-page [[thesaurus]] section. However, what distinguishes this thesaurus from all conventional thesauri is the inclusion of what the author calls rhetorically related words, or ''powernyms''—as opposed to merely synonymous words. According to Heehler, these powernyms allow users to more readily transform rough drafts into more eloquent improvements.

In "Rhetorical Form and Design," Heehler serves up 17 lessons from such writers and speakers as [[T.S. Eliot]], [[Margaret Atwood]], [[John Steinbeck]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Barack Obama]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], and [[Cintra Wilson]]. Rhetorical and literary techniques covered include the [[objective correlative]], rhetorical objectification, [[verb displacement]], rhetorical agency, rhetorical tension, poetic articles, preposition exchange, creative number, and intuitive description.

== Origins ==

According to Heehler, the idea for ''The Well-Spoken Thesaurus'' came to him while attending the [[Harvard Extension School]], where he came to realize just how poorly spoken he truly was. And because there were no books available with which to solve his problem, he began to create a database of eloquent words. Whenever he would chance upon a well-spoken word or phrase at Harvard, he would pair that with what ''he'' would have said. After three years of doing this, of "collecting words like butterflies," he decided that his "butterfly collection" could be of use to others.&lt;ref name=winnipeg/&gt;

'''''The Wrestlers''''' is an [[oil painting]] on [[paperboard|millboard]] by English artist [[William Etty]], painted around 1840 and currently in the [[York Art Gallery]], in [[York]], England. It depicts a [[wrestling]] match between a black man and a white man, both glistening with sweat and under an intense light emphasising their curves and musculature. While little documentation of the painting exists prior to 1947, it is likely that it was painted over a period of three evenings at the [[Figure drawing|life class]] of the [[Royal Academy]].

The Royal Academy had moved to new premises in [[Trafalgar Square]] in 1837, and the studio used by the life class was cramped and hot, a fact thought to account for the sweatiness of the central figures. Etty was best known for his painting of nude or near-nude women in historical and mythological settings but had also painted men involved in various forms of combat.

In the period in which ''The Wrestlers'' was painted, sports were becoming increasingly popular, and the painting is both a reflection of this trend and a part of the English tradition of copying poses from classical [[Hellenism (neoclassicism)|Hellenistic]] works. It was also a time of change in the British attitude to [[Sociology of race and ethnic relations|race relations]]. Etty in this period was generally making a conscious effort to illustrate moral lessons in his work, and it is not clear whether he chose the topic as a form of social commentary or simply because the contrast between the black and white flesh tones was visually striking.

Although ''The Wrestlers'' was probably exhibited as part of a major retrospective of Etty's work in 1849, it then went into a private collection and was not publicly exhibited again for almost a century. In 1947 it was put on sale; with little interest from commercial galleries owing to its subject, it was bought for the bargain price of 30&amp;nbsp;[[guinea (British coin)|guineas]] by the York Art Gallery, where it remains. The painting formed a part of major exhibitions in 2002 and 2011–12.

==Background==
[[File:Etty Andromeda.jpg|right|upright|thumb|''Andromeda'' (1830s, [[Lady Lever Art Gallery]]). It fuelled Etty's notoriety for using scenes from literature and mythology as a pretext to paint nude women.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=32}}|alt=topless woman chained to a rock]]
[[William Etty]] (1787–1849), the seventh son of a [[York]] baker and miller,&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{Cite ODNB|id=8925|title=William Etty}}&lt;/ref&gt; had originally been an apprentice printer in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]],{{sfn|Gilchrist|1855|p=23}} but on completing his seven-year apprenticeship in 1805 moved to [[London]] to become an artist.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; In January 1807 he was admitted to the [[Royal Academy|Royal Academy Schools]] as a probationer,{{sfn|Burnage|Bertram|2011|p=20}} and in July of that year became a student of renowned portrait painter [[Thomas Lawrence]],{{sfn|Burnage|2011a|p=157}} studying under him for a year.{{sfn|Burnage|2011a|p=158}}

Strongly influenced by the works of [[Titian]] and [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], Etty became famous for painting [[Nude (art)|&lt;!-- Normally this would be overlinking, but in this context readers are likely to want to learn more about the tradition of nude art --&gt;nude figures]] in biblical, literary and mythological settings.&lt;ref name="MAG Etty"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestergalleries.org/salvaged/the-painting/about-the-artist/index.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211024806/http://www.manchestergalleries.org/salvaged/the-painting/about-the-artist/index.html|archivedate=11 February 2015|title=About the artist|publisher=Manchester Art Gallery|accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became well-respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting, and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones.{{sfn|Burnage|2011c|p=198}} Many of his peers greatly admired his work, and in February 1828 he defeated [[John Constable]] by 18 votes to five to become a full [[Royal Academician]],{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=52}} at the time the highest honour available to an artist.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=135}}

Between 1820 and 1829 Etty exhibited 15 paintings, of which 14 depicted nude figures.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=32}} While some nude paintings by foreign artists existed in private collections in England, the country had no tradition of nude painting and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 [[Society for the Suppression of Vice|Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice]].{{sfn|Smith|2001b|p=53}}

Etty was the first British artist to specialise in the nude, and the prurient reaction of the lower classes to these paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century.{{sfn|Smith|2001b|p=55}} Although his portraits of male nudes were generally well received,{{efn-ua|Etty's male nude portraits were primarily of mythological heroes and classical combat, genres in which the depiction of male nudity was considered acceptable in England.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|pp=32–33}}}} many critics condemned his recurrent depictions of female nudity as indecent.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=32}}&lt;ref name="MAG Etty" /&gt;

==Composition==
{{Quote box|width=34em|align=right|salign=right|quote=In my time, as a Student, I have known him set three or four models together. Now, it was a group of Graces; now, a composition of two or three Gladiators. Sometimes, a dark man or tawny female was introduced, for picturesque contrast with a fair form of the same sex.|source=[[Daniel Maclise|Maclise]] on Etty's arrangement of models at the Royal Academy life class{{sfn|Gilchrist|1855|p=58}}}}
''The Wrestlers'' is an [[oil study]] from life, depicting a black and a white wrestler [[grappling]].{{sfn|Turner|2011|p=75}} Although at first glance the white wrestler appears to be dominant, the figures are in fact equally matched;{{sfn|Smith|2001a|p=61}}{{sfn|Turner|2011|p=84}} this was unusual for the time, as it was a common belief in Britain in this period that black people were physically weaker than whites.{{sfn|Smith|2001a|p=61}} Showing the subjects under bright light, the painting is a combination of intense juxtapositions between intimacy and violence, dark and light skin, and hard and soft surfaces.{{sfn|Turner|2011|p=75}} The black wrestler is naked; the white wrestler wears a [[loincloth]], although it is possible that this was added after Etty's death.{{sfn|Smith|2001a|p=61}} The intense light casts deep shadows, emphasising the curves and musculature of the wrestlers' bodies,{{sfn|Turner|2011|p=78}} as the skin of the two combatants is stretched and distorted under the pressure of the grapple.{{sfn|Turner|2011|p=77}} The figures are set against a dark green curtain and a brown wall, rather than in a wrestling ring.{{sfn|Turner|2011|p=79}}

The identity of the wrestlers is not known. Alison Smith, Lead Curator of British Art to 1900 at [[Tate]], speculates that the white figure may have been John Wilton of Somerset, who had possibly been the model for [[Little John]] in [[Daniel Maclise]]'s 1839 ''Robin Hood and His Merry Men Entertaining Richard the Lionheart in Sherwood Forest''.{{sfn|Smith|2001a|p=61}}{{efn-ua|"A Working Artist", writing anonymously in ''[[The Art Journal|The Art-Union]]'' in 1841, described Wilton as "a '[[Somerset|Zummurzetshire]] man' but with such a head, face, and beard, as would have rejoiced Salvator. This gentleman has for some years cultivated his mustachios and his vegetables at the same time, of both of which he has a prolific crop."&lt;ref name=LM&gt;{{cite journal|last="A Working Artist"|date=1 Sep 1841|title=Living Models|journal=The Art-Union|publisher=How and Parsons|location=London|volume=3|issue=32|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The figures glisten with sweat. Art historian Sarah Victoria Turner speculates that this is not simply for dramatic effect, but reflects the fact that after the Royal Academy's 1837 move to its new building in [[Trafalgar Square]] the studio used by the life class was a cramped and poorly ventilated room lit by [[gas lighting|gaslight]], which when crowded with students and with the lights on could become extremely hot.{{sfn|Turner|2011|p=79}}

[[File:William Etty at the Life Class by William Holman Hunt YORAG R3257-1 crop.jpg|right|thumb|''William Etty at the Life Class'', [[William Holman Hunt]] (1840–1850, [[York Art Gallery]])|alt=balding man sketching a naked figure]]
''The Wrestlers'' is thought to have been painted in around 1840.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=163}} It is likely that it was executed at the Royal Academy's [[life class]]; despite his senior status, Etty continued to attend there throughout his life. While students at the class usually worked from a single model, Etty would occasionally arrange for "a Treat", in which a group of models would be used to create an entire composition for the students to sketch (often arranged in poses derived from [[Old Master]] paintings).{{sfn|Smith|1996|p=25}} Painted on [[paperboard|millboard]], ''The Wrestlers'' was probably executed over the course of three evenings. On the first evening Etty would have drawn the models in [[chalk]] or [[charcoal]] and inked the outline; on the second evening the figures would have been painted in [[oil paint]], and on the third evening a thin [[Glaze (painting technique)|glaze]] would have been applied to the painting to which colour would then have been added.{{sfn|Turner|2011|p=77}}{{efn-ua|As no records survive of the painting of ''The Wrestlers'' it is not certain how Etty worked, but it is well-documented that this three-day process was his usual method of working.{{sfn|Turner|2011|p=77}}}}

===Subject===
Although best known for his paintings of women, Etty had also produced paintings of nude or semi-nude men engaged in combat, such as 1829's ''Benaiah''. There was a tendency among British artists in this period to attempt to illustrate the physiques of strong and well-proportioned living men, as an indication that the best of British manhood had reached or surpassed the [[Hellenism (neoclassicism)|Hellenistic ideal]] which at that time was considered the model of perfection.{{sfn|Smith|2001a|p=61}} Almost all artists, as part of their training, would be expected to draw from reproductions of classical statues in British museums, or to visit Italy and Greece to view the originals ''in situ''.{{sfn|Turner|2011|pp=80–81}} Etty, and other British artists of the day, would have been familiar with the technical issues of drawing men wrestling, as the ''[[Wrestlers (sculpture)|Uffizi Wrestlers]]'' (the ''Pancrastinae'') was one of the subjects new entrants to the Royal Academy Schools were required to draw.{{sfn|Smith|2001a|p=61}}{{efn-ua|An early drawing of the ''Uffizi Wrestlers'' survives in one of Etty's sketchbooks.{{sfn|Turner|2011|p=81}}}} Etty had  also  made lengthy visits to France and Italy in 1816, 1822–24 and 1830 to view and sketch the paintings and statuary of those countries, with additional visits to Belgium in 1840 and 1841 to view the works of [[Rubens]], whom he greatly admired.{{sfn|Burnage|Bertram|2011|pp=21–26}} 
 
[[File:Benaiah by William Etty YORAG 70.JPG|right|thumb|''Benaiah'' (1829, [[York Art Gallery]])|alt=one semi-naked man preparing to stab another]]
Moreover, as the [[industrial revolution]] took hold and the prevalence of manual labour declined, there were increasing concerns that British men would become unfit and undisciplined; images of sport and combat were thought to motivate the viewer to aspire to an ideal of physical strength which people were worried was becoming lost.{{sfn|Turner|2011|p=80}} Wrestling and boxing thus were popular subjects for artworks, and Etty had produced other paintings and sketches of men engaged in fights of one kind or another.{{sfn|Turner|2011|p=80}}{{sfn|Turner|2011|p=76}} It had become common for artists to use boxers and soldiers as models, as they had the strength and bearing considered desirable, and the discipline to hold a pose for long periods in the studio.{{sfn|Smith|2001a|p=61}}

The motivation behind Etty's choice to pair a black and a white wrestler is not clear. Etty had painted black and [[Indian people|Indian]] subjects in the past,{{efn-ua|Etty's first critically successful painting, ''[[The Triumph of Cleopatra]]'', included black figures; he also painted portraits of black and Indian models.{{sfn|Turner|2011|pp=78–79}}}} and it was not unusual in that period for artists to use non-white models, but it was rare to show a black and a white figure embracing. It is possible that he was simply interested in the contrast between the flesh tones;{{sfn|Turner|2011|p=87}} it is documented that he would sometimes arrange models of different skin colours for that reason.{{sfn|Gilchrist|1855|p=58}} It is also possible that he saw "primitive" black men as closer in spirit or physique to the wrestlers of the classical civilisations.{{sfn|Turner|2011|p=87}} Sarah Victoria Turner argues that combat was the only subject in which it would have been felt appropriate at the time to depict naked black and white figures in intimate closeness.{{sfn|Turner|2011|p=78}}

1840, the year in which ''The Wrestlers'' is likely to have been painted, saw the [[World Anti-Slavery Convention]] in London and the London exhibition of ''[[The Slave Ship]]'' and ''[[:commons:File:The Slave Trade by Auguste Francois Biard.jpg|The Slave Trade]]'', and race relations had become a major social and political issue.{{sfn|Turner|2011|p=78}} While black wrestlers and boxers—often former slaves from the United States or their descendants—were not unusual in England in the period,{{sfn|Turner|2011|p=85}} and the former slave [[Tom Molineaux]] had twice challenged for the boxing world championship in 1811, they were still treated with suspicion by many members of the public.{{sfn|Turner|2011|p=86}}

==Sale and exhibition==

Virtually no contemporary records or reviews of ''The Wrestlers'' exist,{{sfn|Turner|2011|pp=75–76}} and it was probably sold to a private collector either on its completion or in the sale of over 800 works found in Etty's studio following his death;{{sfn|Smith|2001a|p=61}}{{sfn|Turner|2011|p=80}} Dennis Farr's 1958 biography of Etty lists the painting exhibited in 1849 as "lent by C. W. Wass".{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=163}}{{efn-ua|C. W. Wass was a noted [[engraver]] who published engravings of some of Etty's works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=1 December 1849|title=Mr. William Etty, R.A.|journal=The Penny Illustrated News|publisher=William Strange|location=London|volume=1|issue=6|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} ''The Wrestlers'' was probably exhibited at the June 1849 [[Royal Society of Arts]] retrospective of over 130 works by Etty, shortly before his death on 13 November of that year.{{sfn|Burnage|Bertram|2011|p=27}} (Etty produced three paintings entitled ''The Wrestlers'', and it is not certain which was the one exhibited in 1849,{{sfn|Smith|2001a|p=61}} although it is thought likely to be this one.{{sfn|Turner|2011|p=80}})

Etty died in 1849, and his work enjoyed a brief boom in popularity.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=440}} Interest in him declined over time, and by the end of the 19th century the value of all his paintings had fallen below their original levels.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=440}} Following his death, nude paintings went out of fashion very rapidly in Britain.{{sfn|Smith|1996|p=2}}

{{Quotation|An old man, semi-nude, is stepping forward while another man, seen from the back and of dark complexion, embraces his legs. The picture is in my opinion not only a genuine Etty, but very well painted indeed, and as the subject is quite unsuitable for the art trade, it may go at a very cheap figure.

''The Wrestlers'' was sold by a private collector on 31 October 1947. Owing to its subject matter there was little interest from commercial galleries, and it was bought by [[York Civic Trust]] for the bargain price of 30&amp;nbsp;[[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] (£31.50; about £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|31.5|1957|r=-1}}|0}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} terms{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}).{{sfn|Turner|2011|p=75}} It was immediately presented to the [[York Art Gallery]], where it remains.{{sfn|Smith|2001a|p=61}} The painting was one of five works by Etty exhibited in [[Tate Britain]]'s 2002 exhibition ''Exposed: The Victorian Nude'', and was a central component of a major retrospective of Etty's work at the York Art Gallery in 2011–12.{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=131}}

The '''Thorne miniature rooms''' are a set of approximately 100 [[Room box|miniature models of rooms]] created between 1932 and 1940 under the direction of [[Narcissa Niblack Thorne]]. Ninety-nine of the rooms are believed still to be in existence; the majority (68) are on display at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], while 20 are at the [[Phoenix Art Museum]], nine at the [[Knoxville Museum of Art]], and one each at [[The Children's Museum of Indianapolis]] and the [[Kaye Miniature Museum]] in [[Los Angeles]]. The Art Institute's rooms document European and American interiors from the late 13th century to the 1930s and the 17th century to the 1930s, respectively. Constructed on a [[1:12 scale]], the rooms are largely made of the same materials as full-sized rooms, and some even include original works of art.

== Background ==
The model rooms were the brainchild of [[Narcissa Niblack Thorne]],&lt;ref name="PAM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AIC" /&gt; who was born in 1882 in [[Vincennes, Indiana]].&lt;ref name="Siebert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kogan" /&gt; During her childhood, her uncle [[Albert Parker Niblack]], a [[United States Navy]] vice admiral, sent her many antique [[dollhouse]] miniatures from around the world.&lt;ref name="Siebert" /&gt; The idea for the model rooms also developed from Thorne's collection of miniature furniture and household accessories, which she began assembling around 1900, and her desire to house and display these items.&lt;ref name="PAM" /&gt; A further inspiration may have been a miniature [[shadow box]] that she encountered at a [[bazaar]] in [[Istanbul]] during the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Siebert" /&gt;

When she was 19, Thorne married [[Montgomery Ward]] department store heir [[James Ward Thorne]], whose fortune would help finance her hobby.&lt;ref name="Siebert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kogan"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-xpm-2012-12-03-chi-kogan-sidewalks-thorne-rooms-20121130-story.html|title=Thorne Rooms full of small wonders|last=Kogan|first=Rick|date=December 3, 2012|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|access-date=September 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They lived together in [[Lake Forest, Illinois]].&lt;ref name="Kogan" /&gt; By 1930, Thorne was researching period architecture, interior design, and decorative arts to create sketches and blueprints for miniature rooms to house her dollhouse miniatures and other miniature furniture.&lt;ref name="Siebert" /&gt;

During the [[Great Depression]], Thorne had access to some of the top architects, interior designers, and craftsmen in the United States, who between 1932 and 1940 created approximately 100 "period rooms" under her direction.&lt;ref name="PAM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AIC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Siebert"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/20/magazine/letter-of-recommendationthe-thorne-miniature-rooms.html|title=Letter of Recommendation: The Thorne Miniature Rooms|last=Siebert|first=Charles|date=September 17, 2015|work=[[The New York Times Magazine]]|access-date=September 23, 2018|author-link=Charles Siebert}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, 99 of the rooms are believed still to be in existence.&lt;ref name="PAM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LaFree" /&gt; The original 30 were placed on display at the 1933 [[Century of Progress|Century of Progress Exposition]] in [[Chicago]],&lt;ref name="PAM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kogan" /&gt; and in 1940 they were the subject of a [[Life (magazine)|''LIFE'' magazine]] article.&lt;ref name="PAM" /&gt; Twenty of these original rooms were donated to the [[Phoenix Art Museum]], where they remain on display.&lt;ref name="PAM" /&gt;

The majority of the rooms, 68 in all, are on display at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], where they document European and American interiors from the late 13th century to the 1930s and the 17th century to the 1930s, respectively.&lt;ref name="PAM"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.phxart.org/collection/thornerooms|title=Thorne Miniature Rooms|publisher=[[Phoenix Art Museum]]|access-date=September 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AIC"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/thorne|title=Thorne Miniature Rooms|publisher=[[Art Institute of Chicago]]|access-date=September 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zivanovic" /&gt; The Art Institute's rooms were created by Thorne and her craftsmen between 1932 and 1940 at her studio on [[Oak Street (Chicago)|Oak Street]] on the city's [[Near North Side, Chicago|Near North Side]];&lt;ref name="Kogan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LaFree" /&gt; the 31 European rooms were finished by 1937, while the 37 American rooms were completed by 1940.&lt;ref name="Kogan" /&gt; The rooms were gifted to the museum in 1941, and put on permanent display in 1954.&lt;ref name="Kogan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LaFree"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://chicago.curbed.com/2016/9/21/12990778/thorne-rooms-art-institute-chicago-miniature|title=Meticulous and miniature: The Thorne Rooms of the Art Institute|last=LaFree|first=Jessie|date=September 21, 2016|work=[[Curbed|Curbed Chicago]]|access-date=September 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Art Institute of Chicago's rooms are among the museum's most popular permanent collections.&lt;ref name="LaFree" /&gt;

The [[Knoxville Museum of Art]] is home to 9 of the remaining rooms, while [[The Children's Museum of Indianapolis]] and the [[Kaye Miniature Museum]] in [[Los Angeles]] have one each.&lt;ref name="PAM" /&gt;

{{globalize/UK|date=October 2015}}
A '''ticket of leave''' was a document of [[parole]] issued to [[convict]]s who had shown they could now be trusted with some freedoms. Originally the ticket was issued in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and later adapted by the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[Ireland]].

==Jurisdictions==
===Australia===
The ticket of leave system was first introduced by [[Governor_of_New_South_Wales#History|Governor]] [[Philip Gidley King]] in 1801. Its principal aim was to reduce the burden on the fledgling [[colony|colonial]] government of providing food from the government's limited stores to the [[convicts in Australia|convicts]] who were being [[penal transportation|transported]] from the [[United Kingdom]] to [[New South Wales]]. Convicts who seemed able to support themselves were awarded a ticket of leave. Before too long, tickets began to be given as a reward for good behaviour, which permitted the holders to seek [[employment]] within a specified district, but not leave it without the permission of the government or the district's [[resident magistrate]]. Each change of employer or district was recorded on the ticket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=info:nSoxUNfT2J0J:scholar.google.com/&amp;output=viewport|title=Bottomley: Parole in Transition: A Comparative Study of Origins, Developments, and Prospects for the 1990s|publisher=scholar.google.com|accessdate=2008-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally the ticket of leave was given without any relation to the period of the sentence a convict had already served. Some "[[gentleman|gentlemen]] convicts" were issued with tickets on their arrival in the colony. Starting in 1811, the need to first officiate some time in [[penal labour|servitude]] was established, and in 1821 [[Thomas Brisbane|Governor Brisbane]] introduced regulations specifying the lengths of sentences that had to be served before a convict could be considered for a ticket: four years for a seven-year sentence, six to eight years for a 14-year sentence, and 10 to 12 years for those with a life sentence. Once the full original sentence had been served, a "certificate of freedom" would be issued upon application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Convicts and the British colonies in Australia|url=http://www.australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/convicts-and-the-british-colonies|website=australia.gov.au|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=2017-01-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101181100/http://www.australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/convicts-and-the-british-colonies|archivedate=1 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TTCO&gt;{{cite book|title=Treating the criminal offender|year=1988|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-306-42885-2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SiXXzCkFAgwC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=ticket+of+leave#v=onepage&amp;q=ticket%20of%20leave&amp;f=false|author=Alexander B. Smith|author2=Louis Berlin |accessdate=7 February 2011|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ticket-of-leave holders were permitted to [[marry]], or to bring their families from Britain, and to acquire property, but they were not permitted to carry [[firearm]]s or board a [[ship]]. Convicts who observed the conditions of the ticket of leave until the completion of one half of their sentence were entitled to a conditional [[pardon]], which removed all restrictions except a ban on leaving the colony. Convicts who did not observe the conditions of their ticket could be [[arrest]]ed without [[warrant (legal)|warrant]], tried without recourse to the [[Supreme Court of New South Wales|Supreme Court]], and would forfeit their property. The ticket of leave had to be renewed annually, and those with one had to attend muster and church services.

[[File:Ticket of Leave Passport.jpg|thumb|NSW Colonial Government - 1846 Convict Ticket  of Leave Passport]]

The ticket itself was a highly detailed document, listing the place and year the convict was tried, the name of the ship in which he or she was transported, and the length of the sentence. There was also a complete physical description of the convict, along with year of birth, former occupation and "native place".

A ticket had two components:  The "ticket proper" was issued to the person named, and it was mandatory for the person to carry that document on their person at all times. The second component was the "butt", which was the official copy and was kept on file by the Government. Tickets proper are now quite rare as they were in constant use by the holder. The butts are still retained in archival records and are available for researchers.

According to [[Alexander Maconochie (penal reformer)|Alexander Maconochie]], tickets of leave could be suspended in summary fashion for the most "trifling irregularities," and a "very large proportion" of ticket-of-leave holders were returned to government work as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Doherty, Fiona|title=Indeterminate Sentencing Returns: The Invention of Supervised Release|volume=88|journal=N.Y.U. L. Rev.|number=958|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===British military===
In the [[Second World War]], the "ticket of leave" was a colloquial name given to the papers allowing a soldier to take leave from active service.&lt;ref name=JVIFWW&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Richard|title=Jamaican volunteers in the First World War : race, masculinity and the development of national consciousness|year=2004|publisher=Manchester Univ.

&lt;!-- Add American, U.S. and Canada  --&gt;

===Canada===
On August 11, 1899, An Act to Provide for the Conditional Liberation of Convicts - the Ticket of Leave Act - was enacted by the Canadian Parliament. 

The Canadian Ticket of Leave Act was based almost word for word on the British legislation. There was no reference in the text to the purpose of conditional release, though ticket of leave was generally understood to be a form of pardon.

In the beginning, the Governor General granted paroles on the advice of Cabinet as a whole. The act was later amended so that the power to advise the Governor General was limited to the Minister of Justice. This was a significant departure from traditional practice in the use of executive clemency; it was an attempt to separate parole decisions from politics. Even so, because conditional release was still in the hands of an elected minister, public opinion would still have a strong, and sometimes questionable, influence on policy.

In the early 20th century, Canada was sparsely settled. Keeping track of men on tickets of leave was difficult and the authorities relied on parolees to report every month to the police. This had its drawbacks, and when the Salvation Army offered to take over parole supervision in some places, the Department of Justice was glad to accept. Salvation Army officers acted as Dominion Parole Officers until the position was abolished in 1931.

On March 7, 1939, Bill C-34 was passed, revising the Penitentiary Act and creating an administrative board of three.

===Ireland===
[[Walter Crofton]] administered the Irish ticket of leave system.

'''Wildlife Photographer of the Year''' is the largest wildlife photography competition in the world. It is an annual international [[wildlife photography]] competition owned by the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]]. It was known as '''[[BG Group|BG]] Wildlife Photographer of the Year''' from 1990 to 2003, and briefly as '''[[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] Wildlife Photographer of the Year''', '''[[Eastman Kodak|Kodak]] Wildlife Photographer of the Year''' and '''[[Prudential plc|Prudential]] Wildlife Photographer of the Year'''. The first competition was held in 1964, with three categories and around 600 entries.&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/visit-us/whats-on/temporary-exhibitions/wpy/competition/about/history.jsp|title=Wildlife Photographer of the Year - Competition|year=2009|publisher=Natural History Museum|accessdate=2009-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 the competition received over 32,000 entries from 3100 photographers in 82 countries.&lt;ref name=History/&gt; There is an exhibition of the winning and commended images each year at the Natural History Museum, which later tours around the world. It is often cited as being one of the most prestigious photography competitions in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4355628.stm|title=Peregrine swoops to photo prize|last=Amos|first=Jonathan|date=19 October 2005|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/sep/17/arts.artsnews|title=Wildlife photographers feted for animal pageantry|last=Chrisafis|first=Angelique|date=17 September 2002|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2009-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A book of winning entries and runners-up has been published each year since 1992,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; with two books being published in 1994 (the first three volumes were published the year after the corresponding competitions were held). Early volumes have become quite collectable. These portfolios are the sources of the ranking.

==Competition==

A maximum of 25 images ranging from intimate animal portraits to atmospheric landscapes, ground-breaking photojournalism to innovative technique can be submitted once a year, in 12-17 permanent and alternate categories.  Since 2003 the grand prize has been selected from among the winning images of the categories and has been awarded to a single image in adult and young competition too. The photographer aged 17 and under submitting the best image receives the title “The Young Wildlife Photographer of the Year”, while the author of the best image over 17 years of age becomes “The Wildlife Photographer of the Year”. (This award has never been won in adult category more than once.) The deadline of submission of the images is around late February, and the results become public in mid-October.

The winning images are selected from among approximately 50,000 entries received from almost 100 countries around the globe, in three rounds by a prestigious and professional jury. 
The awards ceremony takes place in the Natural History Museum in London. On this date the latest Wildlife Photographer of the Year portfolio, introducing the winning images, comes out. 
Following the awards ceremony, the extremely high-quality and major Wildlife Photographer of the Year exhibition opens its gates in London and after that touring worldwide throughout the year, attracting more than 5 million visitors.

==Categories==

Photographers can enter their images into a range of categories, whose criteria are mostly based on the subject matter of the images. There are also 3 categories for under 18's, and 3 special awards. The number and name of categories changes nearly every year. In each category a winning, runner-up and several highly commended images are usually chosen, although sometimes the judges will not choose a winner or runner up in a particular category if they deem the standard of entries not to be high enough. The categories in the 2016 competition were as follows: 
*1. Mammals
*2. Birds
*3. Reptiles, Amphibians and Fishes
*4. Invertebrates
*5. Plants and Fungi
*6. Underwater
0524+1524

*9. Urban
*10. Detail
*11. Impressions
*12. Black and White
*13. Wildlife Photojournalist: Single Image

== 2009 Controversy ==

The overall 2009 competition winner, José Luis Rodriguez, was stripped of his award and his £10,000 prize following allegations that his picture of a wolf leaping a gate had been staged, using a captive animal to do so. He was also prohibited from entering the competition for life. It was, however, too late to remove the image from the accompanying book.&lt;ref name="Booth"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jan/20/wolf-wildlife-photographer-award-stripped|title=Wildlife photographer of the year stripped of his award|last=Booth|first=Robert|date=2010-01-20|work=The Guardian|accessdate=24 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Woods v N J Ellingham &amp; Co Ltd''' [1977] 1 NZLR 218 is a cited case in [[New Zealand]]  regarding implied terms in a contract.&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond |publisher=Thomson Brookers |ISBN=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Contract |edition=4th |last1=Walker |first1=Campbell |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71770-X|year=2004 |page=87-88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Ellingham was a drainlayer contractor contracted to construct a water treatment plant on the [[Waikato River]], and used Woods as a subcontractor. Woods later experienced abnormal terrain at the site, and later abandoned the job before it had completed the contract.

Woods sued for [[breach of contract]], and NJE defended the matter on the basis that they had experienced abnormal terrain on the job, and so were entitled under implied custom in drainlaying contracts to be paid extra for such work.

==Held==
The [[Law of New Zealand|court]] ruled that Woods had not proved that there was such an implied custom existed, and were accordingly ordered to pay damages.

A '''zero-marking language''' is one with no [[marker (linguistics)|grammatical marks]] on the dependents or the [[grammatical modifier|modifiers]] or the [[head (linguistics)|heads]] or [[nucleus (linguistics)|nuclei]] that show the relationship between different constituents of a phrase.

Pervasive zero marking is very rare, but instances of zero marking in various forms occur in quite a number of [[language]]s. [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] are two national languages listed in the [[World Atlas of Language Structures]] as having zero-marking. [[Pirahã language|Pirahã]] is another language having zero-marking among its other very rare features.

In many [[East and Southeast Asian languages]], such as [[Thai language|Thai]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]], the head [[verb]] and its dependents are not marked for any arguments or for the [[noun]]s' roles in the sentence. On the other hand, possession is marked in such languages by the use of clitic particles between possessor and possessed.

Some languages, such as [[Arabic]], use a similar process, called juxtaposition, to indicate possessive relationships. In Arabic, two nouns next to each other could indicate a possessed-possessor construction: {{lang|ar|كتب مريم}} ''{{transl|ar|kutub Maryam}}'' "Maryam's books" (literally "books Maryam"). The rarity of pervasive zero marking is due to languages with juxtaposition having more of [[inflection]] than languages with zero marking in noun phrases so the two almost never overlap.

Zero-marking, when it occurs, tends to show a strong relationship with word order. Languages in which zero-marking is widespread are almost all [[subject–verb–object]], perhaps because verb-medial order allows two or more [[noun]]s to be recognised as such much more easily than [[subject–object–verb]], [[object–subject–verb]], [[verb–subject–object]], or [[verb-object-subject]] order, for which two nouns might be adjacent and their role in a sentence possibly thus confused.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} It has been suggested that verb-final languages may be likely to develop verb-medial order if marking on nouns is lost.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

==Notable stunts==
===Pharaoh of the Netherlands (2015)===
Arjen Lubach is a strong opponent of the [[monarchy of the Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="Nrc1"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2013/04/29/tien-argumenten-voor-de-monarchie-ontkracht-alcohol-en-dag-vrij-beter-dan-zwaaiende-koning-in-touringcar-a1492509 |title=Tien argumenten vóór de monarchie ontkracht door Arjen Lubach |author=Arjen Lubach |work=[[NRC Handelsblad]] |date=29 April 2013 |accessdate=12 October 2017|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of protest against the monarchy, he came up with a citizens initiative, in which he crowned himself "[[Pharaoh]] of the Netherlands", which, like 'King' is also a
hereditary title. At the time of the airing of the show in which he introduced his initiative, it was 200 years since [[William I of the Netherlands|William I]] proclaimed himself a King of the Netherlands. For the citizens initiative Lubach needed a minimum of 40.000 endorsements, which he obtained while he was a guest at the Dutch talk show ''[[De Wereld Draait Door]]''. With the minimum of 40.000 endorsements, the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]] was obliged to talk about the initiative.&lt;ref name="Nos19"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://nos.nl/op3/artikel/2026504-50-000-tekenaars-voor-farao-initiatief-arjen-lubach.html |title=50.000 tekenaars voor farao-initiatief Arjen Lubach |publisher=[[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|NOS]] |date=23 March 2015 |accessdate=12 October 2017|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="youtube_clip"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOHmOOQA9k |title=De monarchie - Zondag met Lubach (S02) |work=Zondag met Lubach |date=22 March 2015 |accessdate=12 October 2017|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Donald Trump video (2017)===
{{See also|Every Second Counts (video contest)}}

===Nonsensical Rifle Addiction (2017)===
On 8 October 2017, one week after the [[2017 Las Vegas shooting]], ''Zondag met Lubach'' aired a spoof advertisement called "Nonsensical Rifle Addiction", which highlighted the issue with [[Gun violence in the United States|gun violence]] and [[mass shootings in the United States]], and also lampooned the United States's [[Gun politics in the United States|inability to introduce any binding form of gun control]]. The title is a play on the influential American gun rights organisation [[National Rifle Association]] (NRA). The video was retweeted by American actor [[Samuel L. Jackson]] after the [[Stoneman Douglas High School shooting]] in February 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bandt.com.au/campaigns/spoof-ad-lampoons|title=Spoof Ad Lampoons America’s ‘Nonsensical Rifle Addiction’ - B&amp;T|date=11 October 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bustle.com/p/this-dutch-video-about-americas-nonsensical-rifle-addiction-hits-the-nail-on-the-head-2842255 This Dutch video about America's nonsensical rifle addiction hits the nail on the head], bustle.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gouden Televizier-Ring (2017)===
====Best Television show====
On 11 October 2017 during the Televizier-Ring Gala, ''Zondag met Lubach'' was awarded the Gouden Televizier-Ring (Golden television ring) for "Best television program".&lt;ref name="Nos"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://nos.nl/artikel/2197703-gouden-televizier-ring-voor-zondag-met-lubach.html |title=Gouden Televizier-Ring voor Zondag met Lubach |work=[[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|Nos]] |date=12 October 2017 |accessdate=23 October 2017|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zondag met Lubach got a plurality of the vote with 47%. During the airing of the award-show people could vote on one of the three nominees for "Best television program". The two other nominees for the price were, [[Beste Zangers]] and [[Expeditie Robinson]]. Arjen Lubach started off his reception speech with saying "Wat ontzettend terecht" meaning "How very much deserved" (meant as a joke).&lt;ref name="Nos"/&gt; Furthermore, he praised the rest of his team and expressed their importance. This was the first time that a vpro-program won the prize.&lt;ref name="Nrc11"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2017/10/12/lubach-uitgeroepen-tot-populairste-tv-programma-13466235-a1577125 |title=Arjen Lubach wint Gouden Televizier-Ring |work=[[Nrc]] |date=12 October 2017 |accessdate=23 October 2017|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; To get people to vote on Zml during the award-show, Arjen Lubach had an advert placed on the [[Ziggo Dome]]. In this advert the presenter of ''Beste zangers'' and presenters of ''Expeditie Robinson'' were seen giving the advice to vote on Zondag met Lubach and later thanked by Lubach. This initially angered a few people, because they thought that the advert was paid with tax money. However, Lubach later said that this was not the case and that he knew a few people who could get this done.&lt;ref name="Televizier"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.televizier.nl/categorie/televizier-ring/dit-was-de-ziggo-dome-stunt-van-arjen-lubach.4035197.lynkx |title=Dit was de Ziggo Dome-stunt van Arjen Lubach |work=[[televizier]] |date=13 October 2017 |accessdate=23 October 2017|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Best actor====
To gain the attention of his viewers about the nomination for best actor, Lubach talked about it on his show, however he didn't talk about his own nomination. Instead, he talked about Erik de Vogel, who got nominated in the category for best actor. He requested people to vote for De Vogel, together with a catchphrase "Ludo verdient een kudo" meaning Ludo (name of the actor's role in [[Goede tijden, slechte tijden]]) deserves kudos.&lt;ref name="Youtube"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Xa629dwYuA |title=Ludo verdient een kudo - Zondag met Lubach (S07) |work=[[Youtube]] |date=24 September 2017 |accessdate=23 October 2017|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Vogel did however not win the award, as it was given to [[Jeroen van Koningsbrugge]] instead.&lt;ref name="Televizier1"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.televizier.nl/categorie/televizier-ring/zilveren-televizier-ster-acteur-voor-jeroen-van.4035074.lynkx |title=Zilveren Televizier-Ster Acteur voor Jeroen van Koningsbrugge |work=[[televizier]] |date=12 October 2017 |accessdate=23 October 2017|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;
