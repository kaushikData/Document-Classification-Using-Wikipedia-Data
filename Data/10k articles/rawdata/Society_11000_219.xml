'''Acoli''' (also Akoli, Acholi, Acooli, Atscholi, Shuli, Gang, Lwoo, Lwo, Lok Acoli, Dok Acoli) is a [[Southern Luo]] dialect spoken by the [[Acoli people]] in the districts of [[Gulu District|Gulu]], [[Kitgum]] and [[Pader District|Pader]] (a region known as Acoliland) in northern [[Uganda]]. It is also spoken in southern Sudan in Magwi County Eastern Equatoria states

''[[Song of Lawino]]'', well known in African literature, was written in Acoli by [[Okot p'Bitek]], although its sequel, ''Song of Ocol'', was written in English{{ref|heron1}}.

Acoli, [[Alur dialect|Alur]], and [[Lango dialect|Lango]] have between 84 and 90 per cent of their vocabulary in common{{ref|ladefoged2}} and are [[mutually intelligible]].{{Dubious|date=April 2015|at 84/90% common vocabulary intelligibility is significantly hampered}} However, they are often counted as separate languages because their speakers are ethnically distinct. Labwor (Thur), once considered a dialect of Acoli, may not be intelligible with it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/cr_files/2015-016.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
Acoli has [[vowel harmony]]: all vowels in a word have to belong to a single class (e.g. {{IPA|[kojo]}} ''the cold'' vs. {{IPA|[kɔjɔ]}} ''to separate''). There are two sets of five vowels, distinguished by the feature [+/-ATR].

Acoli is a [[tone (linguistics)|tonal language]]. Thus, some words may be distinguished by tone alone, e.g. ''bèl'' (low) 'wrinkled' vs. ''bél'' (high) 'corn' and ''kàl'' (low) 'place enclosed by a palisade' vs. ''kál'' (high) 'millet'. Tone furthermore plays a role in verb conjugation.


The above were the old work of the missionaries Alfered Malandra and Crazzolara published in 1955.  However, a more up-to-date Acoli orthography by Janet Lakareber shows that a vowel in Acoli language has more than two pronunciations.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | url= http://patent.ipexl.com/GB/GB2427959.html|title=Acoli Accented Orthography with diacritical marks| accessdate= 9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A monosyllabic word in Acoli has 14 different pronunciations.  This is explained in the nine books of Acoli Accented Orthography.

'''Ajrak''' ({{lang-sd|اجرڪ}}) is a unique form of blockprinted [[shawl]]s and tiles found in [[Sindh]], [[Pakistan]]. These shawls display special designs and patterns made using block printing by stamps. Over the years, ajraks have become a symbol of the [[Sindhi culture]] and traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bilgrami|first1=Noorjehan|title=Sindh Jo Ajrak|date=March 20, 2009|publisher=Department of Culture and Tourism, Government of Sindh,1990|isbn=9789698100001|pages=177|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=MiFBAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Rahila+Narejo&amp;dq=Rahila+Narejo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Early human settlements in the lower Indus Valley found a way of cultivating and using ''[[Gossypium arboreum]]'' commonly known as ''tree cotton'' to make clothes. These civilizations are thought to have mastered the art of making cotton fabrics.

A bust of a priest-king excavated at [[Mohenjo-daro]], currently in the [[National Museum of Pakistan]], shows one shoulder draped in a piece of cloth that resembles an ajrak. Of special note is the [[trefoil]] pattern etched on the person's garment interspersed with small circles, the interiors of which were filled with a red pigment. This symbol illustrates what is  believed to be an edifice depicting the fusion of the three sun-disks of the gods of the sun, water and the earth. [[Excavation (archaeology)|Excavation]]s elsewhere in the [[Old World]] around [[Mesopotamia]] have yielded similar patterns on various objects, most notably on the royal couch of [[Tutankhamen]]. Similar patterns appear in recent ajrak prints.

The level of geometry on the garment comes from the usage of a method of printing called [[woodblock printing]] in which prints were transferred from geometric shapes etched on the wooden blocks by pressing them hard on the fabric. Block printing is thought to have been first used in [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]], at least as far as movable type is concerned. On its way through the populous regions of the Indus Valley, this technique of fabric printing was adopted at Mohenjo-daro.

The tradition still prevails centuries later, and people still use the same methods of production that were used in the earlier days to create an ajrak. The garment has become an essential part of the Sindhi culture and apparel of  Sindhis. Men use it as a turban, a [[cummerbund]] or wind it around their shoulders or simply drape it over one shoulder. Women use it as a [[dupatta]] or a shawl and sometimes as a makeshift swing for children. Ajraks are usually about 2.5 to 3-meters long, patterned in intense colours predominantly rich [[crimson]] or a deep [[indigo]] with some white and black used sparingly to give definition to the geometric symmetry in design.

Ajraks are made all over Sindh, especially in [[Matiari]], [[Hala, Sindh|Hala]], [[Bhit|Bhit Shah]], [[Moro, Pakistan|Moro]], [[Sukkur]], [[Kandyaro]], [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]], and many cities of [[Upper Sindh]] and [[Lower Sindh]].

The ajrak is an integral part of [[Sindhi culture]] and [[Sindhi nationalism]]. Its usage is evident at all levels of society, and is held in high esteem, with the utmost respect given to it. According to Sindhi traditions, ajraks are often presented as gifts of hospitality to guests and presented to the person who is utterly respectable. They are also worn on festive occasions such as weddings and cultural events. Many prominent politicians from Sindh publicly wear ajraks, including the deceased former Pakistani Prime Minister, [[Benazir Bhutto]].

==Dyes==
Ajrak craft products are made with natural dyes. The entire production of the products include both vegetable dyes and mineral dyes. Indigo is a key dye.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3659">{{About|the Zaidi imam of Yemen|other people with the same name|Al-Mansur Muhammad (disambiguation){{!}}Al-Mansur Muhammad}}
'''Al-Mansur Muhammad''' (1441 &amp;ndash; March 4, 1505) was an [[imam]] of the [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] state in [[Yemen]] who ruled in 1475-1504, in rivalry with other claimants for the [[imamate]].

==Zaidi disunity==

Muhammad bin Ali as-Siraji al-Washali was one of the three [[Sayyid]]s who claimed the Yemeni imamate after the death of [[al-Mutawakkil al-Mutahhar]] in [[Dhamar, Yemen|Dhamar]] in 1474. He was a seventh-generation descendant of the imam [[Yahya bin Muhammad as-Siraji]] (d. 1296).&lt;ref&gt;''Imam Zaid bin Ali Cultural Foundation'', {{cite web|url=http://www.izbacf.org/page_display.php?book_id=37&amp;page_num=54 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726201129/http://www.izbacf.org/page_display.php?book_id=37&amp;page_num=54 |archivedate=2011-07-26 }} (in Arabic). The line of descent is Yahya bin Muhammad as-Siraji - an-Nasir - Ahmad - Ali - Ahmad - Muhammad - Ali - al-Mansur Muhammad.&lt;/ref&gt; He took the honorific title al-Mansur Muhammad. The two other claimants were [[al-Hadi Izz ad-din]] (d. 1495) and [[an-Nasir Muhammad bin Yusuf|an-Nasir Muhammad]] (d. 1488). A fourth imam, [[al-Mu’ayyad Muhammad]] posed as lord of [[San'a]] (Sahib San'a) since 1464. Al-Mansur Muhammad was thus only one of several leaders in the Zaidi lands of highland Yemen. At this time, the [[Sunni]] [[Tahirids (Yemen)|Tahiride]] dynasty ruled from [[Zabid]] and [[Ta'izz]] in the lowland and southern highland. The Tahiride sultans did not attempt to expand to the north after 1465, and their relations to the Zaidi imams oscillated between tolerance and enmity. A preserved text outlines the political situation in the Zaidi territory around 1500. Al-Mu'ayyad Muhammad ruled San'a and the surrounding districts; the [[Kawkaban]] area stood under the sons of the old imam [[al-Mutawakkil al-Mutahhar]]; and the traditional Zaidi centre [[Sa'dah]] and its districts were divided between al-Mansur Muhammad and two other families.

==Defeats against the Tahirides==

Al-Mansur Muhammad attacked Tahiride positions between [[Dhamar, Yemen|Dhamar]] and San'a in 1496 and 1498. On the latter occasion the imam's forces were completely routed. After the death of al-Mu'ayyad Muhammad bin an-Nasir in 1503, San'a was dominated by a certain Sharib. In the next year, the Tahiride Sultan Amir attacked the city. Al-Mansur Muhammad hastened down to relieve the defenders of San'a, but he fell in the hands of Sultan Amir. The Tahirides entered San'a and a reign of terror ensued.&lt;ref&gt;R.B. Serjeant &amp; R. Lewcock, ''San'a'; An Arabian Islamic City''. London 1983, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; The captured imam was poisoned in prison in San'a three months later.&lt;ref&gt;Lein O. Schuman, ''Political History of the Yemen at the Beginning of the 16th Century''. Groningen 1960, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; The Tahiride triumph was just temporary. Two years later the Zaidi imamate was continued in the person of [[al-Mutawakkil Yahya Sharaf ad-Din]], who managed to unite large parts of Yemen under his authority.

'''''Are U 4 Real?''''' ({{lang-sv|'''Sandor slash Ida'''}}) is a Swedish [[young adult fiction|young adult]] book written by [[Sara Kadefors]]. It was originally written as a script for a television drama, but after a Swedish television network turned it down, Kadefors got Bonnier Carlsen to publish it as a book in 2001. On April 7, 2009, it was revealed that the book would be released in the United States on May 14, 2009, with a new title, ''Are U 4 Real?''&lt;ref name="svd"&gt;{{cite web|author=Malin Axelsson |url=http://www.svd.se/kulturnoje/nyheter/artikel_2706019.svd |title=USA-förlag krävde ändring i manus &amp;#124; Kulturnyheter &amp;#124; SvD |language=sv |publisher=Svd.se |date=2009-04-03 |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is about a girl named Ida who lives in Stockholm and a boy named Sandor who lives in Gothenburg. The two sixteen-year-olds meet for the first time on an Internet chat room, where they eventually fall in love with each other. However, everything goes wrong when Sandor decides to visit Ida in Stockholm.

==Plot==
Ida is exactly the opposite of the girls Sandor usually talks to in real life. She is an attractive girl from [[Stockholm]] who likes to party, while he is a shy boy from [[Gothenburg]] who likes to dance ballet. The two first meet in an Internet chat room, where they share their feelings and become close friends. Sandor and Ida eventually fall in love with each other. However, everything goes wrong when Sandor decides to visit Ida in Stockholm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.penguingroup.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780803732766,00.html |title=Are U 4 Real? - Sara Kadefors - Penguin Group (USA) |publisher=Us.penguingroup.com |date= |accessdate=2009-04-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419092136/http://us.penguingroup.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0%2C%2C9780803732766%2C00.html |archivedate=19 April 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
''Sandor slash Ida'' was originally written by Sara Kadefors as a television drama. However, when she pitched the idea to the Swedish television network [[Sveriges Television]], they turned it down. Kadefors therefore tried to get it published as a book, and in 2001 she got it published by Bonnier Carlsen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bostream.nu/bokmarkt/bocker/sandorslashida.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120730081049/http://www.bostream.nu/bokmarkt/bocker/sandorslashida.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-30 |title=Bokmärkt - Sandor slash Ida |publisher=Bostream.nu |date= |accessdate=2009-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 7, 2009, it was revealed that the book would be published in the United States by [[Penguin Group]] on May 14, 2009. Several changes have been made to the English adaption of the book. Ida's name has been changed to Kyla and Sandor's has been changed to Alex. The book is no longer set in Sweden; Stockholm has been replaced by [[Los Angeles]] and Gothenburg by [[San Francisco]]. Several parts of the book regarding Ida's sexual experiences have also been removed or censored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://svt.se/2.27170/1.1510319/kadefors_ungdomsbok_skrivs_om_for_usa?lid=is_search527895&amp;lpos=5&amp;queryArt527895=sandor+slash+ida&amp;sortOrder527895=0&amp;doneSearch=true&amp;sd=47225&amp;from=siteSearch&amp;pageArt527895=0 |title=Kadefors ungdomsbok skrivs om för USA - kultur &amp; nöje |publisher=svt.se |date= |accessdate=2009-04-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420041143/http://svt.se/2.27170/1.1510319/kadefors_ungdomsbok_skrivs_om_for_usa?lid=is_search527895&amp;lpos=5&amp;queryArt527895=sandor%2Bslash%2Bida&amp;sortOrder527895=0&amp;doneSearch=true&amp;sd=47225&amp;from=siteSearch&amp;pageArt527895=0 |archivedate=20 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kadefors said she was insulted by the changes, "it's like if the book wasn't good enough, and [Ida's] experiences with sex and alcohol explains why she reacts the ways she does in the book."&lt;ref name="svd"/&gt; The book's translator explained that if the book had contained "too much sex" it would have been difficult to sell to stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dn.se/kultur-noje/film-tv/sandor-slash-ida-skrivs-om-for-usa-1.839337 |title="Sandor slash Ida" skrivs om för USA |language=sv |publisher=DN.se |date= |accessdate=2009-04-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408131029/http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/film-tv/sandor-slash-ida-skrivs-om-for-usa-1.839337 |archivedate=8 April 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Child labor Bangladesh.jpg|thumb|250px|Child labour in [[Bangladesh]].]]
'''Child labour in Bangladesh''' is common, with 4.7 million or 12.6% of children aged 5 to 14 in the work force.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org/bangladesh/Child_labour.pdf |title=Child labour in Bangladesh |date=June 2010 |website=UNICEF |access-date=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of the child labourers engaged in the work force, 83% are employed in rural areas and 17% are employed in urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics |date=2006 |title=Baseline Survey for Determining Hazardous Child Labour Sectors in Bangladesh 2005 |location=Dhaka |publisher=Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh |pages= |isbn=978-9845086257}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Child labour]] can be found in agriculture, poultry breeding, fish processing, the garment sector and the leather industry, as well as in shoe production. Children are involved in jute processing, the production of candles, soap and furniture. They work in the salt industry, the production of asbestos, bitumen, tiles and ship breaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.loening-berlin.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Insights-Bangladesh-Beitrag-L%C3%B6ning.pdf|title=Labour conditions in Bangladesh|last=Löning|first=Markus|date=5 December 2017|website=www.loening-berlin.de|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Bangladesh]] passed a Labour Law setting the minimum legal age for employment as 14. Nevertheless, the enforcement of such labour laws is virtually impossible in Bangladesh because 93% of child labourers are employed in the informal sector such as small factories and workshops, on the street, in home-based businesses and domestic employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org/bangladesh/children_4863.htm |title=Bangladesh - Child Labour |website=UNICEF |access-date=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the prevalence of child labour in Bangladesh, there has been an increase in legislation against child labour.&lt;ref name="Hasan2007" /&gt; Bangladesh has ratified,  the ILO [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention]] (C182). In addition, the country also ratified the UN [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]].

== Definitions ==
The definition of [[child labour]] varies depending on region, culture, organization, and government. The Western perspective portrays childhood as a carefree stage of life in which a person does not possess the capacity to be an adult.&lt;ref name="SchmitzTraver2004"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Schmitz |editor-first1=Cathryne L. |editor-last2=Traver |editor-first2=Elizabeth KimJin |editor-last3=Larson |editor-first3=Desi |date=2004 |title=Child Labor: A Global View |location=Westport, Connecticut |publisher=Greenwood Press |pages=1–2 |isbn=978-0-313-32277-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is no universal definition for child labour, various organizations have defined child labour and its parameters.

The [[International Labour Organization]]'s (ILO) Minimum Age Convention 138 states that at age 12 a child is allowed to light work in non-hazardous situations and at age 15 a child is allowed to enter the work force.&lt;ref name="SchmitzTraver2004" /&gt; The ILO defines child labour as "work that exceeds a minimum number of hours, depending on the age of a child and on the type of work".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The ILO also has three categories pertaining to children in work: economically active children, child labour, and hazardous work. Children can be categorised as economically active if they are involved in work outside of school or the home at least one hour once every seven days. Children can be categorised as performing child labour if they are under the age of 12 or performing hazardous work. Children are categorised as performing hazardous work if they are involved in activities that may harm their physical, mental, or developmental health or safety.&lt;ref name="ILO2006"&gt;{{cite book |date=2006 |title=The end of child labour: Within reach |url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/standards/relm/ilc/ilc95/pdf/rep-i-b.pdf |location=Geneva |publisher=International Labour Organization |isbn=92-2-116603-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations Children's Fund]] (UNICEF) defines child labour as any activity that affects a child's health and education. Its definition also states that child labour is work that leads to deprivation of childhood activities, exploitation and abuse.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{failed verification|date=December 2015}}&lt;!-- these are the effects of child labour, not how UNICEF defines child labour --&gt;

The [[International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour]] (IPEC) defines employment and economically active children as "paid and unpaid work in the formal and nonformal sectors of rural and urban areas". This definition excludes children working in their own households.&lt;ref name="SchmitzTraver2004" /&gt;

The [[Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics]] considers children aged 5–14 who work for one or more hours (per week) in both paid and unpaid settings to be child workers. For children older than 10, any economic activity is considered a form a child labour. This includes work both inside and outside of the household setting.&lt;ref name="Salmon2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Salmon |first=Claire |date=June 2005 |title=Child Labor in Bangladesh: Are Children the Last Economic Resource of the Household? |url= |journal=Journal of Developing Societies |publisher=Sage Publications |volume=21 |issue=1–2 |pages=33–54 |doi=10.1177/0169796X05053066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes and impact ==

===Poverty===
[[File:2014 Poverty rate chart Chad Haiti Nigeria Bangladesh Kenya Indonesia India China Brazil based on World Bank new 2011 PPP benchmarks.png|thumb|left|2014 Poverty rate chart Chad Haiti Nigeria Bangladesh Kenya Indonesia India China Brazil based on World Bank new 2011 PPP benchmarks]]
Poverty is widely recognised and acknowledged as the primary cause of child labour.&lt;ref name="SchmitzTraver2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ILO2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Salmon2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rahman1999"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rahman |first1=Mohammad Mafizur |last2=Khanam |first2=Rasheda |last3=Absar |first3=Nur Uddin |date=December 1999 |title=Child Labor in Bangladesh: A Critical Appraisal of Harkin's Bill and the MOU-Type Schooling Program |url= |journal=Journal of Economic Issues |publisher=Association for Evolutionary Economics |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=985–1003 |doi=10.2307/4227511 |jstor=4227511}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HobbsMcKechnie1999"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hobbs |first1=Sandy |last2=McKechnie |first2=Jim |last3=Lavalette |first3=Michael |date=1999 |title=Child Labor: A World History Companion |location=Santa Barbara, California |publisher=ABC-CLIO |pages=31 |isbn=978-0-87436-956-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The link between poverty and child labour is supported by efforts of international organizations, such as the ILO and the United Nations, to reduce child labour through poverty reduction policies.&lt;ref name="ILO2006" /&gt; There is a strong negative correlation between the income level of a country and the incidence rate of child labour. An increase of $0–$500 per capita income to $500–$1000 per capita income can lead to a decrease in child labour incidence rate from 30%–60% to 10%–30%.&lt;ref name="SchmitzTraver2004" /&gt; Although the annual per capita income of Bangladesh has been increasing, around 9–13% of the total labour force in Bangladesh still consists of children aged 5–14.&lt;ref name="SchmitzTraver2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Salmon2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rahman1999" /&gt; In a 2013 statistical report, UNICEF estimates that around 43.3% of the population in Bangladesh is currently living below the international poverty line.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/bangladesh_bangladesh_statistics.html |title=Bangladesh: Statistics |date=18 December 2013 |website=UNICEF |accessdate = 15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Factors such as urbanization and population growth perpetuate poverty.&lt;ref name="Rahman1999" /&gt; In a 2013 statistical report, UNICEF estimated an annual population growth rate in Bangladesh to be 1.7% from 1990–2012.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Populations move from rural to urban areas because there is an increase in available economic opportunities. A combination of poor living standards in urban settings and an influx of cheap labour from children perpetuate both poverty and the use of child labour.&lt;ref name="SchmitzTraver2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rahman1999" /&gt; The prevalence of child labour can be attributed to the socioeconomic statuses of families living at or below the poverty line. Oftentimes, families rely on the extra income produced by their children in order to sustain their livelihood. Many children are forced to work to help support the family. In other cases, children are forced to work for a living for themselves because their families abandoned or could not take care of them. Studies have shown that children from poorer families are more likely to be in the work force due to their contribution to overall family income.&lt;ref name="SchmitzTraver2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Salmon2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rahman1999" /&gt;

===Demographics===
[[File:Boys in red.jpg|thumb|Boys covered with mercury-containing red [[vermilion]] chemical during child labour in a factory producing [[sindoor]].]]
The demographics of the population in Bangladesh can also be a predictor of child labour incidence rates. Children in rural areas are more likely to work than children in urban areas.&lt;ref name="Salmon2005" /&gt; This may be due to the agricultural history of Bangladesh and the tradition of children working alongside adults in the fields.&lt;ref name="SchmitzTraver2004" /&gt; However, in both rural and urban settings, boys are more likely to work than girls, with the majority of child workers falling in the age range of 12–14.&lt;ref name="Rahman1999" /&gt;

Family dynamics also contributed to child labour incidence rates. Children in households with a large proportion of adults in the family are less likely to work. Children in households where all adults are working are more likely to work. Children in households where there is a larger portion of paid adult workers are even more likely to work. These findings by Salmon (2005) indicate that children act as a source of income generation because households that maximise all human capital tend to be households that have incidences of child labour.&lt;ref name="Salmon2005" /&gt;

===Lack of education===
{{main article|Education in Bangladesh}}
[[File:Community Box Library in Bangladesh.jpg|thumb|left|Community Box Library in Bangladesh]]
Lack of education remains one of the top impacts of child labour.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SchmitzTraver2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ILO2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Salmon2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rahman1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HobbsMcKechnie1999" /&gt; Child labour is a deterrent to schooling.&lt;ref name="BDRC2009"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bangladeshstudies.org/files/WPS_no8.pdf |title=Physical and Psychological Implications of Risky Child Labor: A Study in Sylhet City, Bangladesh |last1=Uddin |first1=Mohammad Nashir |last2=Hamiduzzaman |first2=Mohammad |last3=Gunter |first3=Bernhard G. |date=July 2009 |website=Bangladesh Development Research Center (BDRC)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many policies aimed at eradicating child labour have focused on increasing accessibility to education. Organizations such as the ILO, the United Nations, and UNICEF recognise the importance of education in helping to eradicate poverty and in preventing child labour growth rates.&lt;ref name="ILO2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HobbsMcKechnie1999" /&gt; According to UNICEF, the new National Education Policy requires that children must complete school until grade eight and that school must be free.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many definitions of child labour state education as a right of childhood and consider barriers to education as a defining characteristic of child labour.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SchmitzTraver2004" /&gt;

There is a strong relationship between child labour and school attendance. In a 2010 statistical report, UNICEF measured that around 50% of all working children in Bangladesh do not attend school.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another 6.8% of children between age 7 and 14 whom, while going to school, also work.&lt;ref name="OCFT2011"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dol.gov/ilab/programs/ocft/2011TDA/Bangladesh.pdf |title=2011 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor: Bangladesh |date=2011 |website=Office of Child Labor, Forced Labor, and Human Trafficking (OCFT) |publisher=United States Department of Labor |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130720033944/http://www.dol.gov/ilab/programs/ocft/2011TDA/Bangladesh.pdf |archive-date=20 July 2013 |accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of those that do attend school, school performance is negatively affected when children are in the work force.&lt;ref name="HobbsMcKechnie1999" /&gt; Although school is free, many children are forced to drop out because they do not have the time or resources to attend. For many families, the income produced by their children is considered more valuable than an education that requires their child to stop working.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HobbsMcKechnie1999" /&gt; A study conducted by Rahman (1997) found that around 58% of working children listed economic hardship as the reason they were not attending school.&lt;ref name="Rahman1999" /&gt; Of those that did choose to go to school, conditions of schools and the quality of education proved to be serious barriers to significant learning.&lt;ref name="SchmitzTraver2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BanerjeeDuflo2011"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Banerjee |first1=Abhijit V. |last2=Duflo |first2=Esther |date=2011 |title=Poor Economics: A Radical Rethinking of the Way to Fight Global Poverty |location=New York |publisher=PublicAffairs |page=74 |isbn=978-1-61039-093-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2002 and 2003 survey conducted by the [[World Bank]] showed that on average teachers in Bangladesh miss one out of five days of work a week.&lt;ref name="BanerjeeDuflo2011" /&gt;

It has also been found that illiteracy rates are a predictor of child labour prevalence.&lt;ref name="Salmon2005" /&gt; In 2013, UNICEF estimates that total adult literacy is around 57.7%.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Literacy rates also tend to be lower for females than males. In Bangladesh, less than 75% of girls finish their primary education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Seager |first=Joni |date=2009 |title=The Penguin Atlas of Women in the World |publisher=Penguin Books |location=New York |page=81 |isbn=978-0-14-311451-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==
According to the recent 2014 TVPRA ''[[List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor]]'' published by the [[U.S. Department of Labor]]'s [[Bureau of International Labor Affairs]], Bangladesh figures among the 74 countries where significant incidence of child labour and [[Unfree labour|forced labour]] is still observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/list-of-goods/ |title=List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor |website=United States Department of Labor}}&lt;/ref&gt; 15 products are produced in such working conditions in Bangladesh.

===Informal sector===
Most child labourers in Bangladesh are employed in the [[informal sector]].&lt;ref name="Forastieri2002"&gt;{{cite book |last=Forastieri |first=Valentina |date=2002 |title=Children at Work: Health and Safety Risks |location=Geneva |publisher=International Labour Organization |pages=31–34, 76, 81 |isbn=978-92-2-111399-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; These forms of labour are hard to regulate and monitor. The most common forms of work is agriculture, in rural areas, and domestic service, in urban areas.&lt;ref name="SchmitzTraver2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Salmon2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rahman1999" /&gt; The majority of all child labourers in Bangladesh work in agriculture.&lt;ref name="library.thinkquest.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/03oct/01908/800/indianregion.htm |title=Child Labor in Bangladesh |website=Blood, Sweat and Tears: The Story of Child Labor |publisher=ThinkQuest Library |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/3635/20130909070801/http://library.thinkquest.org/03oct/01908/800/indianregion.htm |archive-date=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agricultural activities include poultry farming, drying fish, salt mining, shrimp farming and produce logistics.&lt;ref name="OCFT2011" /&gt; Children in agriculture use dangerous tools, carry heavy loads, and apply harmful pesticides. Many of these children are employed by their families as extra hands in the fields or sent out to work for their own food. They often work long hours with little to no pay and endure dangerous conditions that result in many health issues.&lt;ref name="Forastieri2002" /&gt;

Children, mostly girls, work as domestic servants in private households in Bangladesh. Domestic child labourers work long hours and subject to harassment, emotional, physical, and sexual abuse.&lt;ref name="dol"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/bangladesh.htm |title=2012 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labour: Bangladesh |website=United States Department of Labor |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529230805/http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/bangladesh.htm |archive-date=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of children working as [[domestic worker]]s are employed seven days a week and live in the home they serve. Separation from family and working in private homes often results in the abuse and exploitation of these children.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They endure harsh working conditions that cause psychological stress, physical strain, and health issues with little pay or compensation in the form of food, clothing, and shelter. Because domestic service occurs in the home, it is often not considered economic work. Therefore, there are minimal regulations for fair working conditions and wages.&lt;ref name="Forastieri2002" /&gt;

Other informal industries with large child labour activity (age below 18) include ship breaking and recycling operations, production of soap, matches, bricks, cigarettes, footwear, furniture, glass, jute, leather, textiles, restaurants, garbage picking and trash hunting, vending, begging, portering, and van pulling.&lt;ref name="BDRC2009" /&gt; Many working children earn less than 10 US dollars per month.&lt;ref name="library.thinkquest.org" /&gt;

===Formal sector===
[[File:Bangladeshi women sewing clothes.jpg|thumb|Girls and women were the most common employees of the garment industry.]]
The garment industry is the largest employer of child labour in the formal sector.&lt;ref name="SchmitzTraver2004" /&gt; The industry expanded rapidly from 1983 to 1999, becoming the country's largest source of export earnings.&lt;ref name="Sinha2002" /&gt; Bangladesh is in the top ten largest garment exporters in the world.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Morrow |first1=Colette |last2=Fredrick |first2=Terri Anm |date=2012 |title=Getting In Is Not Enough: Women and the Global Workplace |location=Baltimore, MD |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |pages=73 |isbn=1-4214-0635-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The garment industry not only increased economic earning but also increased available jobs in urban settings, especially for women.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; As a result, the incidence of child labourers in urban areas increased. The majority of labourers in the garment industry hired are girls and women.&lt;ref name="Salmon2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Bangladesh garment factories have been accused of forcing girls as young as 13 to work up to 11 hours a day to produce garments for western retailers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Brignall |first1=Miles |last2=Butler |first2=Sarah |date=5 February 2014 |title=Bangladesh garment factories still exploiting child labour for UK products |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/06/bangladesh-garment-factories-child-labour-uk |newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children in this industry work around 10 hours a day for about 12 U.S. dollars a month.&lt;ref name="Rahman1999" /&gt; Children are also exposed to various health and safety hazards. Garment shops are at great risk of fires due to blocked fire exits, poor crowd control, and lack of fire safety precautions. Working in garment shops also exposes children to dangerous chemicals and heavy machinery. These exposures to safety hazards can lead to various health issues ranging from cuts and bruises to musculoskeletal disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Forastieri |first=Valentina |date=2002 |title=Children at Work: Health and Safety Risks |location=Geneva |publisher=International Labour Organization |pages=39, 78 |isbn=978-92-2-111399-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Child labour laws influencing practices in Bangladesh==

=== Legislation in Bangladesh ===
;The Employment of Children Act 1938

This act allowed for children aged 15 or up to work in the railway industry and in transporting goods in port jobs. It also allowed for children aged 15–17 to work night shifts that may last until the morning under certain stipulations such as resting for 13 consecutive hours, working under someone that is 18 years or older, or serving an apprenticeship. It prohibited children under 12 from working in hazardous industries but did not mention protection for children between the ages 12–18.&lt;ref name="Hasan2007"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hasan |first=Jesmul |date=2007 |chapter=Chapter 6: An Assessment of Child Labour Laws, Prevention Strategies and their Effectiveness in Bangladesh |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IkCo4ww8q98C&amp;pg=PA81 |editor-last1=Herath |editor-first1=Gamini |editor-last2=Sharma |editor-first2=Kishor |title=Child Labour in South Asia |location=Aldershot, England |publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]] |pages=81–98 |isbn=978-0-7546-7004-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;The Factories Act 1965

This act prohibited children under 14 to work in or be present in factories. Factories was defined as any place with more than 10 people employed. It also listed various protections for children from hazardous machines and operations. It prohibited any work duration of longer than 5 hours between 7pm to 7am. It also states the weight lifting limits for types of workers (male, female, child).&lt;ref name="Hasan2007" /&gt;

;Shops and Establishment Act 1965

This act defined a shop or establishment as a place that employs 5 or more people. This act prohibited children under the age of 12 from working in any establishment. It allowed children aged 12–18 to work in establishments but limited the number of work hours to a maximum of 7 hours a day.&lt;ref name="Hasan2007" /&gt;

;The Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh

The [[Constitution of Bangladesh]] while guaranteeing the fundamental rights for the people prohibits all forms of forced labor under Article 34. Article 34 lays down that 'all forms of forced labor are prohibited and any contravention of this provision shall be an offense punishable in accordance with law'.

;The Children Act 2013

The Children Act 2013 repealed the previous Children Act 1974 which was inconsistent with international standards particularly with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child 1989. Section 4 of this Act provides that notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force every person shall be deemed to be a child who is below the age of 18 years. Though there is no specific provision prohibiting child labor it proscribes and punishes some serious offenses against children including exploitation of children (section 80).

=== Applicable laws from other legal jurisdictions ===
;The Child Labor Deterrence Act 1993 (Harkin's Bill)
{{main article|Child Labor Deterrence Act}}
Originating from U.S. Senator [[Tom Harkin]], this bill banned imports of items that were associated with child labour at various stages of production, whether it was direct involvement in the product or indirect involvement such as packaging. This law affected the labour situation in Bangladesh because garment industries, fearing a loss of business, fired many child labourers.&lt;ref name="Rahman1999" /&gt;

;Human Trafficking Deterrence and Suppression Act 2012

According to the Office of Child Labor, Forced Labor, and Human Trafficking (OCFT) United States Department of Labor:&lt;blockquote&gt;In 2011, Bangladesh made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Bangladesh passed the Human Trafficking Deterrence and Suppression Act 2012 which makes [[human trafficking]] (including labor trafficking) a [[Capital punishment|capital offense]], developed and fully funded a Child Labor Monitoring Information System to manage child labor related data and began implementation of a $9 million child labor project. However, legal protections regarding child labor are limited and the capacity to enforce child labor laws remains weak. Bangladesh maintains a low [[compulsory education]] age. Children in Bangladesh are engaged in the worst forms of child labor, primarily in dangerous activities in agriculture and domestic service.&lt;ref name="OCFT2011" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The legislation tried to enroll more children and adults into school and away from work. This was not the outcome.  Some children enrolled in school, but many sought other work.  Due to the law, many kids took more dangerous jobs in the informal economy, including; [[child prostitution|prostitution]], [[hawker (trade)|street hawkers]], stone welding, and as maids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Furlong |first=Andy |date=2012 |title=Youth Studies: An Introduction |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-135-18992-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Schooling is compulsory only to age 10. The minimum age for most child labor is 14, 18 for [[hazardous work]].&lt;ref name="OCFT2011" /&gt;

== Initiatives against child labour ==
[[File:Flag of ILO.svg|thumb|Flag of ILO]]
;The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) 1995

Signed by the [[Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association]] (BGMEA), ILO, and UNICEF this initiative allowed children displaced and fired from the garment industry to receive education, vocational training, and skills training. It also provided families with income to make up for their child's lack of work. This program is also called "The Placement of Children Workers in School Programs and the Elimination of Child Labor." The MOU has made an impact in reducing child labour in the garment industry in Bangladesh. Because of this program, more than 8,200 children received non-formal education after losing their jobs. Additionally, 680 children received vocational training.&lt;ref name="Sinha2002"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sinha |first=Anisur Rahman |chapter=Bangladesh: A Multilateral Collaboration to Eliminate Child Labor in the Export-Oriented Garment Industry |chapter-url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?num=61&amp;u=1&amp;seq=74&amp;view=image&amp;size=100&amp;id=uiug.30112053887110 |editor1-last=U.S. Department of Labor |editor2-last=International Labour Organisation |date=2002 |title=Advancing the Global Campaign Against Child Labor: Progress Made and Future Actions |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of International Labor Affairs |pages=61–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;The Bangladesh Rehabilitation Assistance Committee (BRAC)

The [[Bangladesh Rehabilitation Assistance Committee]] is a non-profit organization founded in the mid-1970s in Bangladesh. BRAC, along with [[Grameen Bank]], are the two largest lenders of microcredit in Bangladesh. Together they cover 59% of borrowers in the country.&lt;ref name="Jahiruddin2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jahiruddin |first1=ATM |last2=Short |first2=Patricia |last3=Dressler |first3=Wolfram |last4=Khan |first4=M. Adil |date=2011 |title=Can microcredit worsen poverty? Cases of exacerbated poverty in Bangladesh |journal=Development in Practice |publisher=Routledge |volume=21 |issue=8 |pages=1109–1121 |doi=10.1080/09614524.2011.607155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microcredit has been shown to alleviate poverty but in small amounts. The effects of microcredit are not large enough to change the lives of an entire population. However, it has been shown to allow families in poverty to find a way out.&lt;ref name="BanerjeeDuflo2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jahiruddin2011" /&gt; BRAC has also been responsible for running schools for non-formal education that were put in place to teach children fired from jobs. These non-formal schools also gave children another option besides schooling. Along with the schooling program, families also received health care services and monthly cash stipends to make up for the wages their children were not bringing in by participating in the schooling program.&lt;ref name="Hasan2007" /&gt;

;Other strategies

In addition to the work of the government, BRAC, and ILO, there have been a number of contributions from international organizations and donors to help start strategies against child labour. These strategies include: taking children out of hazardous work environments and placing them in schooling or training programs, giving families stipends to compensate for loss in wages from a decrease in child labour, and raising awareness of the harmful effects of child labour.&lt;ref name="Hasan2007" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11754">'''Cognitive bias in animals''' is a pattern of deviation in judgment, whereby inferences about other animals and situations may be affected by irrelevant information or [[emotional state]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Haselton, M. G. |author2=Nettle, D. |author3= Andrews, P. W. |last-author-amp=yes |chapter=The evolution of cognitive bias|year=2005|location=Hoboken, NJ, US|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc|editor=D. M. Buss|title=The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology|pages=724–746}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes said that animals create their own "subjective social reality" from their perception of the input.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bless, H. |author2=Fiedler, K. |author3= Strack, F. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Social cognition: How individuals construct social reality.|year=2004|publisher=Hove and New York: Psychology Press|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, for example, an [[optimistic]] or [[pessimistic]] bias might affect one's answer to the question "Is the glass half empty or half full?"

To explore [[cognitive bias]], one might train an animal to expect that a positive event follows one stimulus and that a negative event follows another stimulus. For example, on many trials, if the animal presses lever A after a 20&amp;nbsp;Hz tone it gets a highly desired food, but a press on lever B after a 10&amp;nbsp;Hz tone yields bland food. The animal is then offered both levers after an intermediate test stimulus, e.g. a 15&amp;nbsp;Hz tone. The hypothesis is that the animal's "mood" will bias the choice of levers after the test stimulus; if positive, it will tend to choose lever A, if negative it will tend to choose lever B. The hypothesis is tested by manipulating factors that might affect mood – for example, the type of housing the animal is kept in.&lt;ref name="Harding"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harding|first1=EJ|last2=Paul|first2=ES|last3=Mendl|first3=M|year=2004|title=Animal behaviour: cognitive bias and affective state|journal=Nature|volume=427|issue=6972|pages=312|doi=10.1038/427312a|pmid=14737158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive biases have been shown in a wide range of species including rats, dogs, rhesus macaques, sheep, chicks, starlings and honeybees.&lt;ref name="Rygula" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mendl et al., (2009)"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Mendl, M.|author2=Burman, O.H.P.|author3=Parker, R.M.A.|author4=Paul, E.S.|last-author-amp=yes |year=2009|title=Cognitive bias as an indicator of animal emotion and welfare: emerging evidence and underlying mechanisms|journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science|volume=118|pages=161–181|doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2009.02.023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In rats==
In what has been described as a "landmark study",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Neuropsychopharmacology|year=2010|volume=35|pages=1008–1015|doi=10.1038/npp.2009.204|title=Ambiguous-cue interpretation is biased under stress- and depression-like states in rats.|author=Enkel, T.|author2=Gholizadeh, D.|author3=von Bohlen und Halbach, O. |author4=Sanchis-Segura, C.|author5=Hurlemann, R.|author6=Spanage, R.|author7=Gass P.|author8=Vollmayr, B.|lastauthoramp=y|pmid=20043002|pmc=3055368}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first study of cognitive bias in animals was conducted with rats.  This showed that laboratory rats in unpredictable environments had a more pessimistic attitude than rats in predictable environments.&lt;ref name="Harding" /&gt;

One study on rats investigated whether changes in light intensity – a short-term manipulation of emotional state – has an effect on cognitive bias.  Light intensity was chosen as a treatment because this specifically relates to anxiety-induction. Rats were trained to discriminate between two different locations, in either high ('H') or low ('L') light levels. One location was rewarded with palatable food and the other with aversive food. Rats switched from high to low light levels (putatively the least negative [[emotional manipulation]]) ran faster to all three ambiguous locations than rats switched from low to high light levels (putatively the most negative manipulation).&lt;ref name="Burman 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Physiology and Behavior|volume=98|issue=3|year=2009|pages=345–350|title=Anxiety-induced cognitive bias in non-human animals|author1=Burman, O.H.P.|author2=Parker, R.M.A.|author3=Paul, E.S.|author4=Mendl, M.T.|lastauthoramp=y|doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2009.06.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study investigated whether chronic [[social defeat]] makes rats more pessimistic. To induce chronic [[psychosocial]] stress, rats were subjected to daily social defeat in a resident–intruder paradigm for three weeks. This chronic psychosocial [[psychological stress|stress]] makes rats more pessimistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Chronic psychosocial stress makes rats more 'pessimistic' in the ambiguous-cue interpretation paradigm|author=Papciaka, J.|author2=Popika, P.|author3=Fuchsc, E.|author4=Rygula, R.|journal=Behavioural Brain Research|volume=256|year=2013|pages=305–310|doi=10.1016/j.bbr.2013.08.036|pmid=23993861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the cognitive bias approach, it has been found that rats which are subjected to either handling or playful, experimenter-administered manual stimulation (tickling) showed different responses to the intermediate stimulus: rats exposed to tickling were more optimistic.&lt;ref name="Rygula"&gt;{{cite journal|
first1=R|last1=Rygula|first2=H|last2=Pluta|last3=P|first3=Popik|title=Laughing rats are optimistic|journal=PLoS ONE|year=2012|volume=7|issue=12|pages=e51959|pmc=3530570|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0051959|pmid=23300582}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors stated that they had demonstrated "...for the first time a link between the directly measured positive affective state and decision making under uncertainty in an animal model".

==In pet dogs==
Up to five million pet dogs in the UK, approximately 50% of the population, may perform undesirable separation-related behaviour when left home alone.  Dogs were trained to move from a start position to a food bowl. When the bowl was on one side of the room ('positive' location, P) it contained a small quantity of food, and when on the opposite side ('negative' location, N) it was empty.  In test trials, the bowl (empty) was placed at one of three ambiguous locations between P and N (near-positive (NP), middle (M), or near-negative (NN).  Three test trials were presented at each location. The researchers measured how quickly the dogs moved to the ambiguous locations, fast indicating anticipation of food (an 'optimistic' judgement) or more slowly (a 'pessimistic' judgement).{{clarify|date=January 2018}}  These cognitive bias tests show that dogs which exhibit high levels of separation-related behaviour in a separation test also have a more negative underlying mood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Mendl, M.|author2=Brooks, J.|author3= Basse, C.|author4=Burman, O.|author5=Paul, E.|author6=Blackwell, E.|author7=Casey, R.|lastauthoramp=y|title=Dogs showing separation-related behaviour exhibit a 'pessimistic' cognitive bias|journal=Current Biology|volume=20|issue=19|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2010.08.030 |year=2010|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0960982210010201/1-s2.0-S0960982210010201-main.pdf?_tid=dca3e6e0-ad47-11e4-bc9f-00000aab0f01&amp;acdnat=1423148668_0e54a842bf173b32ae557174ec0bb5f2|pages=R839–R840|pmid=20937467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In pigs==
Domestic pigs do not appear to develop a cognitive bias when kept in different stocking densities.  Farmed pigs trained to expect food inside a bowl in one location and not in another, and then tested to show their responses to ambiguous spatial locations. Forty growing pigs were housed in groups of 10 at different density for 8 weeks prior to the start of the test.

==In honeybees==
[[File:Honeybee-27527-1.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Honeybees become pessimistic after being shaken]]
Honeybees (''[[Apis mellifera carnica]]'') were trained to extend their [[proboscis]] to a two-component odour mixture (CS+) predicting a reward (e.g., 1.00 or 2.00 M [[sucrose]]) and to withhold their proboscis from another mixture (CS−) predicting either punishment or a less valuable reward (e.g., 0.01 M [[quinine]] solution or 0.3 M sucrose).  Immediately after training, half of the honeybees were subjected to vigorous shaking for 60 s to simulate the state produced by a predatory attack on a concealed colony. This shaking reduced levels of [[octopamine (neurotransmitter)|octopamine]], [[dopamine]], and [[serotonin]] in the [[hemolymph]] of a separate group of honeybees at a time point corresponding to when the cognitive bias tests were performed. In honeybees, octopamine is the local [[neurotransmitter]] that functions during reward learning, whereas dopamine mediates the ability to learn to associate odours with quinine punishment.  If flies are fed serotonin, they are more aggressive; flies depleted of serotonin still exhibit aggression, but they do so much less frequently.

Within 5 minutes of the shaking, all the trained bees began a sequence of unreinforced test trials with five odour stimuli presented in a random order for each bee: the CS+, the CS−, and three novel odours composed of ratios intermediate between the two learned mixtures. Shaken honeybees were more likely to withhold their mouthparts from the CS− and from the most similar novel odour. Therefore, agitated honeybees display an increased expectation of bad outcomes similar to a vertebrate-like emotional state.  The researchers of the study stated that, "Although our results do not allow us to make any claims about the presence of negative subjective feelings in honeybees, they call into question how we identify emotions in any nonhuman animal. It is logically inconsistent to claim that the presence of pessimistic cognitive biases should be taken as confirmation that dogs or rats are anxious but to deny the same conclusion in the case of honeybees."&lt;ref name="Bateson"&gt;{{cite journal|

{{wiktionary|ejaculate}}
'''Ejaculation''' is the discharge of [[semen]] (normally containing [[sperm]]) from the [[Male reproductive system|male reproductory tract]], usually accompanied by [[orgasm]]. It is the final stage and natural objective of male [[sexual stimulation]], and an essential component of natural [[Fertilisation|conception]]. In rare cases, ejaculation occurs because of [[prostatic disease]]. Ejaculation may also occur spontaneously during [[sleep]] (a [[nocturnal emission]] or "wet dream"). ''[[Anejaculation]]'' is the condition of being unable to ejaculate. ''[[Painful ejaculation|Dysejaculation]]'' is an ejaculation that is painful or uncomfortable. [[Retrograde ejaculation]] is the condition where semen travels backwards into the bladder rather than out the [[urethra]].

==Phases==

===Stimulation===
{{anchor|Stimulation phase}}

{{see also|Sexual stimulation|Orgasm#In males|Intravaginal ejaculation latency time|Sexual arousal#Male physiological response}}
A usual precursor to ejaculation is the [[sexual arousal]] of the male, leading to the [[erection]] of the [[penis]], though not every arousal nor erection leads to ejaculation. Penile sexual stimulation during [[masturbation]] or [[Sexual intercourse|vaginal]], [[Anal sex|anal]], [[Oral sex|oral]], or [[non-penetrative sex|non-penetrative]] sexual activity may provide the necessary stimulus for a man to achieve [[orgasm]] and ejaculation. With regard to [[intravaginal ejaculation latency time]], men typically reach orgasm 5–7 minutes after the start of penile-vaginal intercourse, taking into account their desires and those of their partners, but 10 minutes is also a common intravaginal ejaculation latency time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Waldinger | first1 = M.D. | last2 = Quinn | first2 = P. | last3 = Dilleen | first3 = M. | last4 = Mundayat | first4 = R. | last5 = Schweitzer | first5 = D.H. | last6 = Boolell | first6 = M.|year=2005|title=A Multinational Population Survey of Intravaginal Ejaculation Latency Time|journal=Journal of Sexual Medicine|volume=2|pages=492–497|doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2005.00070.x|pmid=16422843|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Giuliano | first1 = F. | last2 = Patrick | first2 = D. | last3 = Porst | first3 = R. | last4 = La Pera | first4 = G. | last5 = Kokoszka | first5 = A. | last6 = Merchant | first6 = S. | last7 = Rothman | first7 = M. | last8 = Gagnon | first8 = D. | last9 = Polverejan | first9 = E.  | year=2008|title=Premature Ejaculation: Results from a Five-Country European Observational Study|journal=European Urology|volume=53|issue=5|pages=1048–1057|doi= 10.1016/j.eururo.2007.10.015|pmid= 17950985}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prolonged stimulation either through [[foreplay]] (kissing, petting and direct stimulation of erogenous zones before penetration during intercourse) or stroking (during masturbation) leads to an adequate amount of arousal and production of [[Pre-ejaculate|pre-ejaculatory fluid]]. While the presence of sperm in pre-ejaculatory fluid is thought to be rare, sperm from an earlier ejaculation, still present in the [[urethra]], may be picked up by pre-ejaculatory fluid.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} In addition, infectious agents (including [[HIV]]) can often be present in pre-ejaculate.

[[Premature ejaculation]] is when ejaculation occurs before the desired time. If a man is unable to ejaculate in a timely manner after prolonged sexual stimulation, in spite of his desire to do so, it is called [[delayed ejaculation]] or [[anorgasmia]]. An orgasm that is not accompanied by ejaculation is known as a [[dry orgasm]].

[[File:Ejaculation.ogg|thumb|Video of an ejaculation]]

When a man has achieved a sufficient level of stimulation, the orgasm and ejaculation begins. At that point, under the control of the [[sympathetic nervous system]], [[semen]] containing [[sperm]] is produced (emission).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Bruce M. | last1 = Koeppen | first2 = Bruce A. | last2 = Stanton, | title = Berne &amp; Levy Physiology | publisher = Elsevier/Mosby | location = Philadelphia, PA | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-323-04582-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The semen is ejected through the [[urethra]] with rhythmic [[Muscle contraction|contractions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Walter F. | last1 = Boron | first2 = Emile L. | last2 = Boulpaep | title = Medical Physiology: A Cellular and Molecular Approach | publisher = Elsevier/Saunders | location = Philadelphia, PA | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-1-4160-2328-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rhythmic contractions are part of the male orgasm. They are generated by the [[bulbospongiosus muscle|bulbospongiosus]] and [[pubococcygeus muscle|pubococcygeus]] muscles&lt;ref name=Marieb&gt;{{cite book | last = Marieb | first = Elaine | title = Anatomy &amp; physiology | publisher = Benjamin-Cummings | location =  | page= 895 | year = 2013 | isbn = 9780321887603 }}&lt;/ref&gt; under the control of a [[spinal reflex]] at the level of the [[spinal nerve]]s S2–4 via the [[pudendal nerve]]. The typical male orgasm lasts several seconds.

After the start of orgasm, pulses of semen begin to flow from the urethra, reach a peak discharge and then diminish in flow. The typical orgasm consists of 10 to 15 contractions, although the man is unlikely to be consciously aware of that many. Once the first contraction has taken place, ejaculation will continue to completion as an involuntary process. At this stage, ejaculation cannot be stopped. The rate of contractions gradually slows during the orgasm. Initial contractions occur at an average interval of 0.6 seconds with an increasing increment of 0.1 seconds per contraction. Contractions of most men proceed at regular rhythmic intervals for the duration of the orgasm. Many men also experience additional irregular contractions at the conclusion of the orgasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  journal  | last = Bolen | first = J. G., |pmid=7458658| title=The male orgasm: pelvic contractions measured by anal probe | journal= Archives of Sexual Behavior| date= 1980-12-09| issue=6 | pages=503–21 | doi = 10.1007/BF01542155 | volume=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ejaculation usually begins during the first or second contraction of orgasm. For most men, the first ejection of semen occurs during the second contraction, while the second is typically the largest expelling 40% or more of total semen discharge. After this peak, the magnitude of semen the penis emits diminishes as the contractions begin to lessen in intensity. The muscle contractions of the orgasm can continue after ejaculation with no additional semen discharge occurring. A small sample study of seven men showed an average of 7 spurts of semen followed by an average of 10 more contractions with no semen expelled. This study also found a high correlation between number of spurts of semen and total ejaculate volume, i.e., larger semen volumes resulted from additional pulses of semen rather than larger individual spurts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Gerstenburg | first = T.

[[Alfred Kinsey]] measured the distance of ejaculation, in "some hundreds" of men. In three-quarters of men tested, ejaculate "is propelled with so little force that the liquid is not carried more than a minute distance beyond the tip of the penis." In contrast to those test subjects, Kinsey noted "In other males the semen may be propelled from a matter of some inches to a foot or two, or even as far as five or six and (rarely) eight feet".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Kinsey | first1 = A.

===Refractory period===
Most men experience a [[refractory period (sex)|refractory period]] immediately following an orgasm, during which time they are unable to achieve another erection, and a longer period again before they are capable of achieving another ejaculation. During this time a male feels a deep and often pleasurable sense of relaxation, usually felt in the groin and thighs. The duration of the refractory period varies considerably, even for a given individual. Age affects the recovery time, with younger men typically recovering faster than older men, though not universally so.&lt;ref name="M&amp;J"/&gt;

Whereas some men may have refractory periods of 15 minutes or more, some men are able to experience sexual arousal immediately after ejaculation. A short recovery period may allow partners to continue sexual play relatively uninterrupted by ejaculation. Some men may experience their penis becoming hypersensitive to stimulation after ejaculation, which can make sexual stimulation unpleasant even while they may be sexually aroused.

There are men who are able to achieve multiple orgasms, with or without the typical sequence of ejaculation and refractory period. Some of those men report not noticing refractory periods, or are able to maintain erection by "sustaining sexual activity with a full erection until they passed their refractory time for orgasm when they proceeded to have a second or third orgasm".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Dunn | first1 = M.E. | last2 = Trost | first2 = J.E.|year=1989|title=Male Multiple Orgasms: A Descriptive Study|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=18|pages=377–387|doi=10.1007/BF01541970|pmid=2818169|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Volume===
The force and amount of semen that will be ejected during an ejaculation will vary widely between men and may contain between 0.1 and 10 [[milliliter]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Fertility and Sterility | volume=26 | issue=6 | pages=492–502 | year=1975  | last1 = Rehan | first1 = N. | last2 = Sobrero | first2 = A.J. | last3 = Fertig | first3 = J.W. | title=The semen of fertile men: statistical analysis of 1300 men | pmid=1169171 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (by way of comparison, note that a [[teaspoon]] is 5 ml and a tablespoon holds 15 ml). Adult semen volume is affected by the time that has passed since the previous ejaculation; larger semen volumes are seen with greater durations of abstinence. The duration of the stimulation leading up to the ejaculation can affect the volume.&lt;ref name="masturbation duration study"&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Physiol Behav | volume=76 | issue=4–5 | pages=685–9 | year=2002  | last1 = Pound | first1 = N. | last2 = Javed | first2 = M.H. | last3 = Ruberto | first3 = C. | last4 = Shaikh | first4 = M.A. | last5 = Del Valle | first5 = A.P. | title=Duration of sexual arousal predicts semen parameters for masturbatory ejaculates | pmid=12127009 | doi = 10.1016/S0031-9384(02)00803-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Abnormally low semen volume is known as [[hypospermia]]. One of the possible underlying causes of low volume or complete lack of semen is [[ejaculatory duct obstruction]]. It is normal for the amount of semen to diminish with age.

===Quality===
{{Main|Semen quality}}
The number of sperm in an ejaculation also varies widely, depending on many factors, including the time since the last ejaculation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/menshealth/facts/semenandsperm.htm | title=Semen and sperm quality | publisher=Dr John Dean, netdoctor.co.uk | accessdate=2009-03-04| date=2015-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; age, stress levels,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://anthro.palomar.edu/biobasis/bio_2.htm  | title= Biological Basis of Heredity: Cell Reproduction | publisher=Dr. Dennis O'Neil, Behavioral Sciences Department, Palomar College, San Marcos, California | accessdate=2009-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[testosterone]]. Greater lengths of sexual stimulation immediately preceding ejaculation can result in higher concentrations of sperm.&lt;ref name="masturbation duration study" /&gt; An unusually low sperm count, not the same as low semen volume, is known as [[oligospermia]], and the absence of any sperm from the semen is termed [[azoospermia]].

==Development==

===During puberty===
[[File:Male anatomy.png|thumb|right|360px|Diagram of the male pelvic and reproductive organs]]
The first ejaculation in males often occurs about 12 months after the onset of [[puberty]], generally through [[masturbation]] or [[nocturnal emission]] (wet dreams). This first [[semen]] volume is small. The typical ejaculation over the following three months produces less than 1 ml of semen. The semen produced during early puberty is also typically clear. After ejaculation this early semen remains jellylike and, unlike semen from mature males, fails to [[Liquefaction|liquefy]]. A summary of semen development is shown in Table 1.

Most first ejaculations (90 percent) lack sperm. Of the few early ejaculations that do contain sperm, the majority of sperm (97%) lack motion. The remaining sperm (3%) have abnormal motion.&lt;ref name="Janczewski"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Janczewski | first1 = Z. | last2 = Bablok | first2 = L.  | year=1985| title=Semen Characteristics in Pubertal Boys| journal= Archives of Andrology | volume=15 | pages= 199–205 | pmid= 3833078| doi=10.3109/01485018508986912 | issue = 2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the male proceeds through puberty, the semen develops mature characteristics with increasing quantities of normal sperm. Semen produced 12 to 14 months after the first ejaculation liquefies after a short period of time. Within 24 months of the first ejaculation, the semen volume and the quantity and characteristics of the sperm match that of adult male semen.&lt;ref name="Janczewski" /&gt;

===Control from the central nervous system===
There is a [[central pattern generator]] in the [[spinal cord]], made up of groups of [[spinal interneuron]]s, that is involved in the rhythmic response of ejaculation. This is known as the ''spinal generator for ejaculation''.&lt;ref name="Guertin"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Guertin |first1=PA |title=Central pattern generator for locomotion: anatomical, physiological, and pathophysiological considerations. |journal=Frontiers in Neurology |date=2012 |volume=3 |pages=183 |doi=10.3389/fneur.2012.00183 |pmid=23403923|pmc=3567435 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To map the neuronal activation of the brain during the ejaculatory response, researchers have studied the expression of [[c-Fos]], a [[Proto oncogene|proto-oncogene]] expressed in neurons in response to stimulation by hormones and neurotransmitters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sagar | first1 = S.M.  | pmid= 3131879| title=Expression of c-fos protein in brain: metabolic mapping at the cellular level | journal= Science | pages=1328–1332 | doi = 10.1126/science.3131879| year=1988| volume=240 | issue=4857|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expression of c-Fos in the following areas has been observed:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  journal | last1 = Pfaus | first1 = J.G. | last2 = Heeb | first2 = M.M. | pmid=9370204| title= Implications of immediate-early gene induction in the brain following sexual stimulation of female and male rodents | journal=Brain Res Bull| year= 1997 | volume=44| pages=397–407 | doi = 10.1016/S0361-9230(97)00219-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  journal  | last1 = Veening | first1 = J.G. | last2 = Coolen | first2 = L.M. | pmid=9638960 | title=Neural activation following sexual behavior in the male and female rat brain | journal= Behav Brain Res | year= 1998 | volume= 92 | pages=181–193 | doi = 10.1016/S0166-4328(97)00190-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hands-free ejaculation===
Although uncommon, some men can achieve ejaculations during masturbation without any manual stimulation. Such men usually do it by tensing and flexing their abdominal and buttocks muscles along with vigorous fantasising. Others may do it by relaxing the area around the penis, which may result in harder erections especially when hyperaroused.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pOqRZTMc_T0C&amp;pg=PA102#v=onepage The Rough Guide to Sex] retrieved February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perineum pressing and retrograde ejaculation===
[[Perineum]] pressing results in an ejaculation which is purposefully held back by pressing on either the perineum or the urethra to force the seminal fluid to remain inside. In such a scenario, the seminal fluid stays inside the body and goes to the [[Urinary bladder|bladder]]. Some people do this to avoid making a mess by keeping all the semen inside.&lt;ref&gt;65+ --Gateway to Sexual Adventure: For Women and Men, Herb Hirata - 2012&lt;/ref&gt; As a medical condition, it is called [[retrograde ejaculation]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrology: Male Reproductive Health and Dysfunction - Page 317, E. Nieschlag, Hermann M. Behre, Susan Nieschlag - 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health issues==
For most men, no detrimental health effects have been determined from ejaculation itself or from frequent ejaculations,{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} though sexual activity in general can have health or psychological consequences. A small fraction of men have a disease called [[postorgasmic illness syndrome]] (POIS), which causes severe muscle pain throughout the body and other symptoms immediately following ejaculation. The symptoms last for up to a week.&lt;ref name=Balon2005&gt;{{cite book | title=Handbook of Sexual Dysfunction | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | editor=Balon R, Segraves RT | year=2005 | isbn=9780824758264}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wylie2015&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oH64CAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;dq=Post%20orgaasmic%20illness%20syndrome&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q=Post-orgasmic%20illness%20syndrome | title=ABC of Sexual Health | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | year=2015 | page=75 | isbn=9781118665565 | editor=Wylie KR | accessdate=2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GARD&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Postorgasmic illness syndrome | encyclopedia=Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD) | publisher=[[National Institutes of Health]] | accessdate=30 July 2015 | year=2015 | url=https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/10809/postorgasmic-illness-syndrome/resources/1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some doctors speculate that the frequency of POIS "in the population may be greater than has been reported in the academic literature",&lt;ref name=Ashby2010&gt;{{cite journal | title=Postorgasm illness syndrome--a spectrum of illnesses. | author=Ashby J, Goldmeier D | journal=J.

At the final stage of his government, Hernández Flores remarked that 42% of police members have been destituted as they were untrustworthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2010/12/09/estados/041n1est|title=Encara Tamaulipas violenciainédita: Eugenio Hernández|author=Martín Sánchez Treviño|date= 9 December 2010|publisher=La Jornada|language=spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With respect to relations with the US states bordering Tamaulipas, Hernández Flores was a principal critic of the immigration laws applied in Texas. He was against the [[Mexico–United States barrier|barrier]] raised between the countries during his term in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2008/05/02/index.php?section=politica&amp;article=018n2pol|title=El nuevo muro humilla a México: Hernández Flores|date=2 May 2008|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In economic matters, he promoted the internal oil investments in Tamaulipas and the creation of jobs coming from that industry. Thus, when [[PEMEX|PetroleosMexicanos company]] announced that another refinery was going to be built in Mexico, Hernández Flores proposed that it be sited at Tamaulipas. It was ultimately decided that the refinery be built in Hidalgo state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2009/03/26/economia/029n1eco|title=Tamaulipas es, con Altamira, la opción ideal para la nueva refinería: Eugenio Hernández|date=26 March 2009|publisher=Periódico La Jornada|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his term as governor, [[Fitch Group|Fitch Ratings]] recognized excellent financial management in Tamaulipas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2010/10/12/politica/016n2pol|title=Tamaulipas consolida su "muy alta calificación crediticia"|date=12 October 2010|publisher=Periódico La Jornada|language=spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, after his government he was accused of generating an over-indebtedness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.excelsior.com.mx/node/714124|title=Tamaulipas está endeudado hasta el año 2027|date=14 February 2011|author1=Reyes Cruz |author2=Juan Manuel |publisher=Excelsior|language=spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indictment==
{{Expand section|date=March 2017}}
On May 27, 2015, Hernández Flores was indicted on charges of [[money laundering]] alongside his brother-in-law [[Oscar Gomez Guerra]] by the [[United States Department of Justice]] (USDOJ), making him a "fugitive" wanted by the United States.&lt;ref name="justiceformergovernor"&gt;{{cite web|title=Former Tamaulipas Governor Indicted in Money Laundering Scheme with Brother-in-Law|url=https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdtx/pr/former-tamaulipas-governor-indicted-money-laundering-scheme-brother-law|website=United States Department of Justice|accessdate=March 5, 2017|date=June 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charges concern a US$30 million sum plus US$2 million invested in three properties in [[McAllen, Texas]] and a fourth property in [[Austin, Texas]].&lt;ref name="justiceformergovernor"/&gt;

__NOTOC__
[[Image:Horseshoes2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Horseshoe pitching]] contest at the annual field day of the [[Farm Security Administration|FSA]] farmworkers community, [[Yuma, Arizona]] (1942)]]

A '''field day''' is a large [[trade show]] for [[agriculture|agricultural]] industry and equipment, especially for [[broadacre]] [[Agriculture|farming]]. It contrasts with an [[agricultural show]] in that a show focuses on livestock and judging, a field day focuses on equipment, demonstrations and processes.

A field day may include events such as [[ploughing]] competitions not usually associated with shows due to the larger space required. The events are good sources of agricultural information, as organizers can arrange for guest speakers to talk on a range of topics.

==Field days by country==
===Australia===
{{main|Field days in Australia}}

===New Zealand===
New Zealand [[National Agricultural Fieldays]] is held at Mystery Creek, [[Hamilton, New Zealand]] and attracts 1,000 exhibitors and over 115,000 visitors through its gates. Smaller shows, held annually in New Zealand's towns and communities, are generally called Agricultural and Pastoral shows (A&amp;P shows).

===Ukraine===
On August 28, 2013 Mykolaiv National Agrarian University started a new tradition of field day in Ukraine.

On August 28, 2013 Field Day on technology of vegetables cultivation was held at the Educational, Scientific and Practical Center of Mykolayiv NAU together with the "S-Rostok company" and with participation of Mykola Kruglov, the Head of Mykolayiv Regional State Administration.

Genius lies in simplicity, as well as the Mykolayiv NAU and the "S-Rostok" company's idea to combine efforts of university science, agrarian education and business in order to realize the common pilot project. The point is – the creation of experimental demonstration field with nearly 150 new breeds and hybrids of vegetable crops of the best-known world producers.

The world-famous companies in vegetable seed business from France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Japan, the USA, Israel, and the Netherlands (16 countries in total) participated in the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en-news.mnau.edu.ua/2013/10/the-field-day-at-the-mykolayiv-nau.html|title=The Field Day at the Mykolaiv National Agrarian University – Agroexperiment 2013!|website=En-news.mnau.edu.ua|accessdate=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Filipino Veterans Fairness Act''' is the name of a number of acts that have been introduced to the [[United States Congress]] in both the [[United States House of Representatives]] and the [[United States Senate]] since the [[103rd United States Congress|103rd Congress]] in 1993.&lt;ref name=s120&gt;{{Citation

|publisher=GovTrack.us
|accessdate=2007-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, nearly every session of Congress has seen a new version of the bill introduced. The purpose of these bills is to amend [[Title 38 of the United States Code]] to grant [[citizenship]] to Filipinos who have completed an enlistment in the [[American Armed Forces]]; at least some versions of this bill would grant citizenship to other foreign nationals under the same provisions.&lt;ref name= "dunnigan"&gt;[[Jim Dunnigan|Dunnigan, James F.]] and [[Albert Nofi|Nofi, Albert A.]] "Dirty Little Secrets". Quill (1990) {{ISBN|0-688-11270-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, every version of the bill introduced has died in committee. Despite this, the bill has been re-introduced in nearly every session of Congress since 1993.&lt;ref name=hr760&gt;{{Citation

== History of the ''[[Veteranos]]''==
[[File:Veterans333jf.JPG|thumb|right|150px|1995 [[World War II]] [[Aurora (province)|Aurora]] Veterans monument and memorial at Quezon Park, [[Baler, Aurora]].]]
Filipinos have fought as members of the American armed forces for over a century. Originally this was limited to U.S. nationals, Filipinos that had emigrated to the U.S. Under a special provision of the Base Agreement between the U.S. and the Republic of the Philippines, which allowed the U.S. to build bases and station troops in the host country, Filipino nationals are allowed to enlist in the U.S. armed forces.&lt;ref name="dunnigan"/&gt; This arrangement is unique, under normal circumstances foreign nationals are not allowed to enlist in U.S. armed forces unless they are resident aliens of the United States. However, since Filipino enlistees are neither U.S. nationals nor resident aliens, they are not granted citizenship upon completion of their first enlistment, and are entitled to fewer benefits.&lt;ref name="dunnigan"/&gt; Proponents of the bill often point out that thousands of Filipinos have enlisted so far (including many in the [[United States Army Forces in the Far East]] in [[World War II]]) and that ninety-percent choose to reenlist,&lt;ref name="dunnigan"/&gt; even though they are the only non-citizen veterans that are not given citizenship upon completion of their enlistment. Since the bill has never made it out of committee, it is unknown what arguments might be used against it. The bill is widely supported by the [[Filipino-American]] community, as well as a US Conference of Mayors unanimous vote of passage for a resolution authored by Filipino-American Mayor [[Christopher Cabaldon]] that called for the full support of the Filipino Veterans Fairness Act. Most versions have been introduced by congressmen with Filipino-American communities among their constituents.&lt;ref name=s623&gt;{{Citation

|accessdate=2007-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1993, versions of this bill have been introduced to congress by members of both parties.&lt;ref name=hr491&gt;{{Citation

|accessdate=2007-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill is typically assigned to a veterans affairs committee after its introduction. The most recent version, introduced in the House of Representatives in 2007 is in committee and was scheduled for debate. It was never voted upon.&lt;ref name=hr760 /&gt;

In June 2007, Mayor [[Christopher Cabaldon]] of [[West Sacramento, California|West Sacramento]] proposed a resolution to the United States [[Conference of Mayors]] in support of the Filipino Veterans Act.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usmayors.org/resolutions/75th_conference/uep_07.asp&lt;/ref&gt;  The Cabaldon resolution was adopted by unanimous vote.
 
On January 17, 2008, Senators [[Daniel Inouye]] and [[Theodore Stevens]] made a [[courtesy call]] on President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] at Malacañang and assured her of the early passage of the Filipino Veterans Equity Bill to benefit 18,000 surviving [[World War II]] veterans. Executive secretary [[Eduardo Ermita]], defense secretary Gilbert Teodoro, acting foreign affairs secretary Francisco Benedicto, Armed Forces chief of staff Gen. Hermogenes Esperon, Jr., US Ambassador [[Kristie Kenney]], and US Deputy Chief of Mission [[Paul W. Jones|Paul Jones]]. Arroyo conferred the Order of the Golden Heart with the Rank of [[Grand Cross]] on Stevens contributing to "the amelioration and improvement of the moral, social, and economic conditions of the Filipino people."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-01/06/content_7374464.htm  news.xinhuanet.com, Philippine official: U.S. Congress to vote on Filipino WWII veterans payment bill]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2008/01/07/18470785.php  www.indybay.org,  JFAV Asks De Venecia to Stop Raising False Hopes on Equity Bill]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support by Lao and Hmong-American Veterans, and Other NGOs in Washington==

The Filipino veterans efforts in Washington, D.C., and in the [[US Congress]], have been repeatedly supported by Hmong- and Lao-American veterans groups who served with U.S. forces during the [[Vietnam War]] in [[Kingdom of Laos]], as well as various non-profit, and non-governmental organizations ([[NGO]])s, including the [[Lao Veterans of America]], Inc.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Philip, Lao Veterans of America, Inc., Washington, D.C.

[[Gambling]] in [[New Zealand]] is controlled by the [[Department of Internal Affairs]]. All public gambling is expected to return a portion of profits to the community. The largest proportion of the gambling industry is operated by state-owned institutions. Expenditure on gambling (losses experienced by players) was $NZ 2.034 billion in 2008 ($NZ 480 per capita), a tenfold increase over 1985 figures.&lt;ref name=stats&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dia.govt.nz/Pubforms.nsf/URL/Expendstats08.pdf/$file/Expendstats08.pdf|title=GAMBLING EXPENDITURE STATISTICS 1984-2008|publisher=Department of Internal Affairs |accessdate=2009-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Horse racing==
[[Bookmaking]] was declared illegal in New Zealand in 1920.&lt;ref name="stats1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/products-and-services/Articles/gaming-industry-Sep99.htm |title=Gambling: An Economically Significant Industry |date=September 1999 |publisher=Statistics New Zealand |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504084841/http://www.stats.govt.nz/products-and-services/Articles/gaming-industry-Sep99.htm |archivedate=4 May 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; From then until the introduction of the [[Totalizator Agency Board]] (TAB) in 1961, betting on racing was only available on-course.

==Lotteries==
The first "Art Union" was conducted in New Zealand by the Otago Art Society in December 1877,&lt;ref&gt;See Grey River Argus, 20 Dec 1877, page 2)&lt;/ref&gt; Both individuals and organizations subsequently used them as a way of raising funds.
The first national lotteries were established in 1933. They were known as "Art Unions". Prizes were relatively small, and in the early Art Unions the prizes were quantities of alluvial gold. As an example, the "Golden Treasure" Art Union of 1935 had 200,000 tickets with a top prize of £2000 ranging down to an 11th prize of £20 plus 400 prizes of £2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Golden Treasure Art Union Results.|work=The New Zealand Railways Magazine, Volume 10, Issue 5|date=1 August 1935|publisher=NZ Electronic Text Centre|url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-Gov10_05Rail-t1-body-d13-d2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The low returns tempted many people to (illegally) purchase tickets in overseas lotteries such as the Australian [[Tatts Group Limited|Tattersall's]] lottery. With Art Union sales declining, a review of lotteries was undertaken by the Second Labour Government in the late 1950s, and in 1961 the National Government introduced the [[Golden Kiwi]] lottery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/timeline&amp;new_date=12/12 NZ History.net - first Golden kiwi Lottery]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New Zealand Lotteries Commission]] was established in 1987. Its original product, [[Lottery|Lotto]], has since been supplemented by [[Instant Kiwi]] [[scratch card]]s, daily [[Keno]] and a Lotto variant named Big Wednesday. Lotto tickets became available online in 2008.

The [[Totalizator Agency Board]], commonly called the TAB, is a [[sports betting]] organisation run by the [[New Zealand Racing Board]].

Introduced in 1987, [[slot machine]]s, commonly known as "pokies", are operated by charitable foundations and are mostly placed in hotels and bars. Maximum jackpots are regulated. In the year ending 30 June 2008, turnover was $10.096 billion, of which $9.158 billion was returned as prizes (player losses were $938 million). These figures represent a 9% decrease from the peak year of 2004. Pokies accounted for 46.1% of gambling expenditure (losses) in 2008.&lt;ref name="stats" /&gt;
The year to 30 June 2009 saw a further 5% fall in expenditure, to $889 million. There were 19,479 machines in 1,501 venues operated by 384 licensees, all of these figures being a decrease from 2008.&lt;ref name=stuff&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/2593281/Pokie-machine-spending-down-to-seven-year-low|title=Pokie machine spending down to seven-year low|publisher=NZPA|accessdate=2009-07-14|date=2009-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1 July 2009, all machines must have Player Information Displays, which inform the gambler how long they have been playing, how much they have lost, and which encourage them to take breaks.&lt;ref name="stuff" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38214">'''Greenhouse gas emissions accounting''' is a method of calculating the amount of greenhouse gases (GHG) emitted by a region in a given time-scale. A National [[Emission inventory|Emissions Inventory]] (NEI) measuring a country’s GHG emissions in a year is required by the [[UNFCCC]] to provide a benchmark for the country’s emission reductions, and subsequently to evaluate international climate policies such as the [[Kyoto protocol]] (although the original has now expired, extensions have been agreed) as well as regional climate policies such as the [[EU Emissions Trading Scheme]] (ETS).&lt;ref name="Peters et al 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peters|first=G.P.|author2=Minx, J.C. |author3=Weber, C.L. |author4=Edenhofer, O |title=Growth in emission transfers via international trade from 1990 to 2008|journal=PNAS|year=2011|volume=108|issue=21|doi=10.1073/pnas.1006388108|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2011/04/19/1006388108.abstract |pages=8903–8908 |pmid=21518879 |pmc=3102371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two conflicting ways of measuring GHG emissions: production-based (sometimes referred to as territorial-based) or consumption-based. Production-based emissions take place “within national territory and offshore areas over which the country has jurisdiction”.&lt;ref name="IPCC 2006"&gt;{{cite book|title=) IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories|year=2006|publisher=Institute for Global Environmental Strategies|location=Japan|page=7|url=http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol1.html|author=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumption-based emissions encompass those emissions from domestic final consumption and those caused by the production of its imports.&lt;ref name="Peters and Hertwich 2008a."&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peters|first=G.P.|author2=Hertwich, Edgar G.|title=Post-Kyoto greenhouse gas inventories: production versus consumption|journal=Climatic Change|year=2008|volume=86|doi=10.1007/s10584-007-9280-1|pages=51–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boitier 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boitier|first=B.|title=CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions production-based accounting vs consumption: Insights from the WIOD databases|year=2012|series=WIOD Conference Paper, April|url=http://www.wiod.org/conferences/groningen/paper_Boitier.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means the importing country takes responsibility for emissions related to production of the exporting country’s exports. By these definitions production-based emissions include exports but exclude imports and emissions embodied in international trade, whereas consumption-based emissions refer to the reverse (Table 1).

Which technique is applied by [[policymakers]] is fundamental as each can generate a very different NEI.&lt;ref name="Boitier 2012" /&gt; Different NEIs would result in a country’s choosing different optimal [[Environmental mitigation|mitigation activities]], the wrong choice based on wrong information being potentially damaging.&lt;ref name="Peters 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peters|first=G.P.|title=From Production-based to consumption-based national emission inventories|journal=Ecological Economics|year=2008|volume=65|issue=1|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2007.10.014|pages=13–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The application of production-based emissions accounting is currently favoured in policy terms, although much of the literature favours consumption-based accounting. The former method is criticised in the literature principally for its inability to allocate emissions embodied in international trade/transportation and the potential for [[carbon leakage]].&lt;ref name="Peters and Hertwich 2008a." /&gt;

It is now overwhelmingly accepted that the release of GHG, predominantly from the [[Anthropogenic hazard|anthropogenic]] burning of [[fossil fuels]] and the release of direct emissions from agricultural activities, is accelerating the growth of these gases in the atmosphere resulting in [[climate change]].&lt;ref name="Canadell et al 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Canadell|first=J.G. |author2=Le Quéré, C. |author3=Raupacha, M.R. |author4=Fielde, C.B. |author5=Buitenhuisc, E.T. |author6=Ciaisf, P. |title=Contributions to accelerating atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; growth from economic activity, carbon intensity, and efficiency of natural sinks|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|year=2007|volume=104|issue=47|doi=10.1073/pnas.0702737104|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/104/47/18866.full.pdf+html|pmid=17962418|pmc=2141868|display-authors=etal |pages=18866–18870}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the last few decades emissions have grown at an increasing rate from 1.0% yr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; throughout the 1990s to 3.4% yr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; between 2000 and 2008.&lt;ref name="Le Quere et al 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Le Quéré|first=C.|author2=Raupach, M.R. |author3=Canadell, J.G. |author4=Marland, G. |author5=Bopp, L.|title=Trends in the sources and sinks of carbon dioxide|journal=Nature Geoscience|year=2012|volume=2|doi=10.1038/ngeo689|url=http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v2/n12/abs/ngeo689.html|issue=12|display-authors=etal |pages=831–836}}&lt;/ref&gt; These increases have been driven not only by a growing [[global population]] and [[GDP|per-capita GDP]], but also by global increases in the [[energy intensity]] of GDP (energy per unit GDP) and the [[carbon intensity]] of energy (emissions per unit energy).&lt;ref name="Raupach et al 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Raupach|first=M.

Although this may seem the rational choice for consumers when considering local pollutants, consumers are inescapably affected by global pollutants such as GHG, irrespective of where production occurs.&lt;ref name="Peters and Hertwich 2008b"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peters|first=G.P.|author2=Hertwich, E.G.|title=CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Embodied in International Trade with Implications for Global Climate Policy|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|year=2008|volume=42|issue=5|doi=10.1021/es072023k|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es072023k|pages=1401–1407}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although emissions have slowed since 2007 as a result of the global financial crisis, the longer term trend of increased emissions is likely to resume.

Today, much international effort is put into slowing the anthropogenic release of GHG and resulting climate change. In order to set benchmarks and emissions targets for - as well as monitor and evaluate the progress of - international and regional policies, the accurate measurement of each country’s NEI becomes imperative.

== Measuring GHG emissions ==

=== Production-based accounting ===
As production-based emissions accounting is currently favoured in policy terms, its methodology is well established. Emissions are calculated not directly but indirectly from fossil fuel usage and other relevant processes such as industry and agriculture according to 2006 guidelines issued by the [[IPCC]] for GHG reporting.&lt;ref name="IPCC 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="National Audit Office"&gt;{{cite web|last=National Audit Office (2008)|title=UK greenhouse gas emissions: measurement and reporting|url=http://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/0708_greenhouse_gas_emissions.pdf|access-date=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The guidelines span numerous methodologies dependent on the level of sophistication (Tiers 1-3 in Table 2). The simplest methodology combines the extent of a human activity with a coefficient quantifying the emissions from that activity, known as an ‘emission factor’.&lt;ref name="Eurostat 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wieland|first=ed.-in-chief: Ulrich|title=Using official statistics to calculate greenhouse gas emissions : a statistical guide|year=2010|publisher=Publications Office of the European Union|location=Luxembourg: Publications Office of the European Union|isbn=978-92-79-14487-5|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-31-09-272/EN/KS-31-09-272-EN.PDF|edition=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example to estimate emissions from the energy sector (typically contributing over 90% of CO2 emissions and 75% of all GHG emissions in developed countries) the quantity of fuels combusted is combined with an emission factor - the level of sophistication increasing with the accuracy and complexity of the emission factor.&lt;ref name="IPCC 2006" /&gt; Table 2 outlines how the UK implements these guidelines to estimate some of its emissions-producing activities.

=== Consumption-based accounting ===
Consumption-based emissions accounting has an equally established methodology using Input-Output Tables. These “display the interconnection between different sectors of production and allow for a tracing of the production and consumption in an economy”&lt;ref name="Hertwich 2010 3"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hertwich|first=E.G.|author2=Peters, G.P.|title=Mutiregional Input-Output Database. OPEN: EU Technical Document.|pages=3|year=2010|url=http://www.oneplaneteconomynetwork.org/resources/programme-documents/WP1_MRIO_Technical_Document.pdf|publisher=One planet economy network.|location=Godalming}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were originally created for national economies. However, as production has become increasingly international and the import/export market between nations has flourished, Multi-Regional Input-Output (MRIO) models have been developed. The unique feature of MRIO is allowing a product to be traced across its production cycle, “quantifying the contributions to the value of the product from different economic sectors in various countries represented in the model. It hence offers a description of the global supply chains of products consumed”.&lt;ref name="Hertwich 2010 3"/&gt; From this, assuming regional- and industry-specific data for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions per unit of output are available, the total amount of emissions for the product can be calculated, and therefore the amount of emissions the final consumer is allocated responsibility for.&lt;ref name="Davis and Caldeira 2010" /&gt;

The two methodologies of emissions accounting begin to expose their key differences. Production-based accounting is transparently consistent with GDP, whereas consumption-based accounting (more complex and uncertain) is consistent with national consumption and trade. However, the most important difference is that the later covers global emissions - including those ‘embodied’ emissions that are omitted in production-based accounting - and offers globally based mitigation options.&lt;ref name="Peters and Hertwich 2008a." /&gt; Thus the attribution of emissions embodied in international trade is the crux of the matter.&lt;ref name="Davis and Caldeira 2010" /&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Davis and Caldeira World Trade Flux Map.png|thumbnail|right|upright=2.0|Figure 1. Largest international fluxes of emissions embodied in trade (Mt CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) from dominant net exporting countries (blue) to the dominant net importing countries (red) in 2004.&lt;ref name="Davis and Caldeira 2010" /&gt;]] --&gt;

== Emissions embodied in international trade ==
Figure 1 and Table 3 show extent of emissions embodied in international trade and thus their importance when attempting emissions reductions. Figure 1 shows the international trade flows of the top 10 countries with largest trade fluxes in 2004 and illustrates the dominance of trade from developing countries (principally China, Russia and India) to developed countries (principally USA, EU and Japan). Table 3 supports this showing that the traded emissions in 2008 total 7.8 gigatonnes (Gt) with a net CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions trade from developing to developed countries of 1.6 Gt.

Table 3 also shows how these processes of production, consumption and trade have changed from 1990 (commonly chosen for baseline levels) to 2008. Global emissions have risen 39%, but in the same period developed countries seem to have stabilized their domestic emissions, whereas developing countries’ domestic emissions have doubled. This ‘stabilization’ is arguably misleading, however, if the increased trade from developing to developed countries is considered. This has increased from 0.4 Gt CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to 1.6 Gt CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - a 17%/year average growth meaning 16 Gt CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; have been traded from developing to developed countries between 1990-2008. Assuming a proportion of the increased production in developing countries is to fulfil the consumption demands of developed countries, the process known as carbon leakage becomes evident. Thus, including international trade (i.e. the methodology of consumption-based accounting) reverses the apparent decreasing trend in emissions in developed countries, changing a 2% decrease (as calculated by production-based accounting) into a 7% increase across the time period.&lt;ref name="Caldeira and Davis 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Caldeira|first=K.|author2=Davis, S.J.|title=Accounting for carbon dioxide emissions: A matter of time|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|year=2011|volume=108|issue=21|doi=10.1073/pnas.1106517108|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/108/21/8533.full|pages=8533–8534|pmc=3102393}}&lt;/ref&gt; This point is only further emphasized when these trends are studied at a less aggregated scale.

Figure 2 shows the percentage surplus of emissions as calculated by production-based accounting over consumption-based accounting. In general, production-based accounting proposes lower emissions for the [[European Union|EU]] and [[OECD]] countries (developed countries) and higher emissions for [[BRIC]] and [[Rest of the world|RoW]] (developing countries). However, consumption-based accounting proposes the reverse with lower emissions in BRIC and RoW, and higher emissions in EU and OECD countries.&lt;ref name="Boitier 2012" /&gt; This led Boitier&lt;ref name="Boitier 2012 p8"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boitier|first=B.|title=CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions production-based accounting vs consumption: Insights from the WIOD databases|pages=8|year=2012|series=WIOD Conference Paper, April|url=http://www.wiod.org/conferences/groningen/paper_Boitier.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; to term EU and OECD ‘CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; consumers’ and BRIC and RoW ‘CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; producers’.

The large difference in these results is corroborated by further analysis. The [[European Union|EU-27]] in 1994 counted emissions using the consumption-based approach at 11% higher than those counted using the production-based approach, this difference rising to 24% in 2008. Similarly OECD countries reached a peak variance of 16% in 2006 whilst dropping to 14% in 2008. In contrast, although RoW starts and ends relatively equal, in the intervening years it is a clear CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; producer, as are BRIC with an average consumption-based emissions deficit of 18.5% compared to production-based emissions.

Peters and Hertwich&lt;ref name="Peters and Hertwich 2008b" /&gt; completed a MRIO study to calculate emissions embodied in international trade using data from the 2001 Global Trade Analysis Program (GTAP). After manipulation, although their numbers are slightly more conservative (EU 14%; OECD 3%; BRIC 16%; RoW 6%) than Boitier&lt;ref name="Boitier 2012" /&gt; the same trend is evident - developed countries are CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; consumers and developing countries are CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; producers. This trend is seen across the literature and supporting the use of consumption-based emissions accounting in policy-making decisions.

== Consumption-based accounting ==

=== Advantages ===
Consumption-based emissions accounting may be deemed superior as it incorporates embodied emissions currently ignored by the UNFCCC preferred production-based accounting. Other key advantages include: extending mitigation options, covering more global emissions through increased participation, and inherently encompassing policies such as the [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM).&lt;ref name="Peters 2008" /&gt;

==== Extending mitigation options ====
Under the production-based system a country is punished for having a pollution intensive resource base. If this country has pollution intensive exports, such as Norway where 69% of its CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions are the result of production for export,&lt;ref name="Peters and Hertwich 2006a"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peters|first=G.P.|author2=Hertwich, E.G.|title=Structural analysis of international trade: environmental impacts of Norway|journal=Economic Systems Research|year=2006|volume=18|issue=2|doi=10.1080/09535310600653008|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09535310600653008#.UfbQM43WTX4|pages=155–181}}&lt;/ref&gt; a simple way to meet its emissions reductions set out under Kyoto would be to reduce its exports. Although this would be environmentally advantageous, it would be economically and politically harmful as exports are an important part of a country’s GDP.&lt;ref name="Peters 2008" /&gt; However, by having appropriate mechanisms in place, such as a [[Carbon tax#Harmonized carbon taxes|harmonized global tax]], [[Carbon tax#Border adjustments, tariffs and bans|border-tax adjustment or quotas]], a consumption-based accounting system could shift the [[comparative advantage]] towards a decision that includes environmental factors.&lt;ref name="Peters and Hertwich 2006b"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peters|first=G.P.|author2=Hertwich, E.G.|title=Pollution embodied in trade: The Norwegian case|journal=Global Environmental Change|year=2006|volume=16|issue=4|doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2006.03.001|pages=379–387}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tax most discussed is based on the carbon content of the fossil fuels used to produce and transport the product, the greater the level of carbon used the more tax being charged. If a country did not voluntarily participate then a border tax could be imposed on them.&lt;ref name="Peters and Hertwich 2008a." /&gt; This system would have the effect of embedding the cost of environmental load in the price of the product and therefore market forces would shift production to where it is economically and environmentally preferable, thus reducing GHG emissions.

==== Increasing participation ====

In addition to reducing emissions directly this system may also alleviate [[competitiveness#National competitiveness|competitiveness]] concerns in twofold ways: firstly, domestic and foreign producers are exposed to the same carbon tax; and secondly, if multiple countries are competing for the same export market they can promote environmental performance as a marketing tool.&lt;ref name="Peters and Hertwich 2008a." /&gt; A loss of competitiveness resulting from the absence of legally binding commitments for non-Annex B countries was the principal reason the USA and Australia, two heavily emitting countries,  did not originally ratify the [[Kyoto protocol]] (Australia later ratified in 2007).&lt;ref name="Tjernshaugen 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tjernshaugen|first=A.|title=United States participation in future climate agreements: an assessment|journal=CICERO Policy Note 2005:01, CICERO|year=2005|url=https://www.duo.uio.no/handle/10852/32742}}&lt;/ref&gt; By alleviating such concerns more countries may participate in future climate policies resulting in a greater percentage of global emissions being covered by legally binding reduction policies. Furthermore, as developed countries are currently expected to reduce their emissions more than developing countries, the more emissions are (fairly) attributed to developed countries the more they become covered by legally bound reduction policies. Peters&lt;ref name="Peters 2008" /&gt; argues that this last prediction means that consumption-based accounting would advantageously result in greater emissions reductions irrespective of increased participation.

==== Encompassing policies such as the CDM ====

The [[Clean Development Mechanism|CDM]] is a flexible mechanism set up under the Kyoto Protocol with the aim of creating ‘[[Carbon Credits]]’ for trade in trading schemes such as the [[EU ETS]]. Despite coming under heavy criticism (see Evans,&lt;ref name="Evans 2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=J.|title=Environmental governance|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0415589827|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Environmental_Governance.html?id=KEU8YgEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; p134-135; and Burniaux et al.,&lt;ref name="Burniaux et al 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burniaux|first=J.M.|author2=Chateau, J. |author3=Dellink, R. |author4=Duval, R. |author5=Jamet, S. |title=The economics of climate change mitigation: how to build the necessary global action in a cost-effective manner|journal=Economics Department Working Papers|year=2009|volume=701|url=http://search.oecd.org/officialdocuments/displaydocumentpdf/?doclanguage=en&amp;cote=eco/wkp(2009)42}}&lt;/ref&gt; p58-65), the theory is that as the marginal cost of environmental abatement is lower in non-Annex B countries a scheme like this will promote [[technology transfer]] from Annex B to non-Annex B countries resulting in cheaper emissions reductions. Because under consumption-based emissions accounting a country is responsible for the emissions caused by its imports, it is important for the importing country to encourage good environmental behaviour and promote the cleanest production technologies available in the exporting country.&lt;ref name="Peters and Hertwich 2008a." /&gt; Therefore, unlike the Kyoto Protocol where the CDM was added later, consumption-based emissions accounting inherently promotes clean development in the foreign country because of the way it allocates emissions. One loophole that remains relevant is ‘[[Carbon emission trading#Criticisms|carbon colonialism]]’ whereby developed countries do not mitigate the underlying problem but simply continue to increase consumption offsetting this by exploiting the abatement potential of developing countries.&lt;ref name="Harvey 2007"&gt;{{cite web|last=Harvey|first=F.|title=Beware the carbon offsetting cowboys|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/dcdefef6-f350-11db-9845-000b5df10621.html#axzz2YewBjlDl|work=Financial Times|access-date=10 July 2013|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disadvantages and implementation ===
Despite its advantages consumption-based emissions accounting is not without its drawbacks. These were highlighted above and in Table 1 and are principally: greater uncertainty, greater complexity requiring more data not always available, and requiring greater international collaboration.

==== Greater uncertainty and complexity ====
Uncertainty derives from three main reasons: production-based accounting is much closer to statistical sources and GDP which are more assured; the methodology behind consumption-based accounting requires an extra step over production-based accounting, this step inherently incurring further doubt; and consumption-based accounting includes data from all trading partners of a particular country which will contain different levels of accuracy.&lt;ref name="Peters and Hertwich 2008a." /&gt;&lt;ref name="Peters 2008" /&gt; The bulk of data required is its second pitfall as in some countries the lack of data means consumption-based accounting is not possible. However, it must be noted levels and accuracy of data will improve as more and better techniques are developed and the scientific community produce more data sets - examples including the recently launched global databases: EORA from the University of Sydney, EXIOPOL and WIOD databases from European consortia, and the Asian IDE-JETRO.&lt;ref name="Marques et al 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marques|first=A.|author2=Rodrigues, J. |author3=Lenzen, M. |author4=Domingos, T. |title=Income-based environmental responsibility|journal=Ecological Economics|year=2012|volume=84|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2012.09.010 |pages=57–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the short term it will be important to attempt to quantify the level of uncertainty more accurately.&lt;ref name="Peters and Hertwich 2008a." /&gt;

==== Greater international co-operation ====

The third problem is that consumption-based accounting requires greater international collaboration to deliver effective results. A Government has the authority to implement policies only over emissions it directly generates. In consumption-based accounting emissions from different geo-political territories are allocated to the importing country. Although the importing country can indirectly oppose this by changing its importing habits or by applying a border tax as discussed, only by greater international collaboration, through an international dialogue such as the UNFCCC, can direct and meaningful emissions reductions be enforced.&lt;ref name="Peters and Hertwich 2008a." /&gt;

== Sharing emissions responsibility ==

Thus far it has been implied that one must implement either production-based accounting or consumption-based accounting.&lt;ref name="Andrew and Forgie 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andrew|first=A.R.|author2=Forgie, V.|title=A three-perspective view of greenhouse gas emission responsibilities in New Zealand|journal=Ecological Economics|year=2008|volume=68|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2008.02.016|pages=194–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are arguments that the answer lies somewhere in the middle i.e. emissions should be shared between the importing and exporting countries. This approach asserts that although it is the final consumer that ultimately initiates the production, the activities that create the product and associated pollution also contribute to the producing country’s GDP. This topic is still developing in the literature principally through works by Rodrigues et al.,&lt;ref name="Rodrigues et al 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rodrigues|first=J.|author2=Domingos, T. |author3=Giljum, S. |author4=Schneider, F. |title=Designing an indicator of environmental responsibility|journal=Ecological Economics|year=2006|volume=59|issue=3|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2005.10.002 |pages=256–266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lenzen et al.,&lt;ref name="Lenzen et al 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lenzen|first=M.|author2=Murray, J. |author3=Sack, F. |author4=Wiedmann, T. |title=Shared producer and consumer responsibility — Theory and practice|journal=Ecological Economics|year=2007|volume=61|issue=1|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2006.05.018 |pages=27–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marques et al.&lt;ref name="Marques et al 2012" /&gt; as well as through empirical studies by such as Andrew and Forgie.&lt;ref name="Andrew and Forgie 2008" /&gt; Crucially it proposes that at each stage of the supply chain the emissions are shared by some pre-defined criteria between the different actors involved.&lt;ref name="Marques et al 2012" /&gt;

Whilst this approach of sharing emissions responsibility seems advantageous, the controversy arises over what these pre-defined criteria should be. Two of the current front runners are Lenzen et al.&lt;ref name="Lenzen et al 2007" /&gt; who say “the share of responsibility allocated to each agent should be proportional to its value added” and Rodrigues et al.&lt;ref name="Rodrigues et al 2006" /&gt; who say it should be based on “the average between an agent's consumption-based responsibility and income-based responsibility” (quoted in Marques et al.&lt;ref name="Marques et al 2012 p60"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marques|first=A.|author2=Rodrigues, J. |author3=Lenzen, M. |author4=Domingos, T. |title=Income-based environmental responsibility|journal=Ecological Economics|year=2012|volume=84|pages=60|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2012.09.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;). As no criteria set has been adequately developed and further work is needed to produce a finished methodology for a potentially valuable concept.

== The future ==

Measuring a country’s GHG emissions is critical to combat climate change. It is clear that production-based emissions accounting, the currently favoured method for policy-making, significantly underestimates the level of GHG emitted by excluding emissions embodied in international trade. Implementing consumption-based accounting which includes such emissions, developed countries take a greater share of GHG emissions and consequently the low level of emissions commitments for developing countries are not as important.&lt;ref name="Peters and Hertwich 2008a." /&gt; Not only does consumption-based accounting encompass global emissions, it promotes good environmental behaviour and increases participation by reducing competitiveness.

Despite these advantages the shift from production-based to consumption-based accounting arguably represents a shift from one extreme to another.&lt;ref name="Peters 2008" /&gt; The third option of sharing responsibility between importing and exporting countries represents a compromise between the two systems. However,  as yet no adequately developed methodology exists for this third way, so further study is required before it can be implemented for policy-making decisions.

Today, given its lower uncertainty, established methodology and reporting, consistency between political and environmental boundaries, and widespread implementation, it is hard to see any movement away from the favoured production-based accounting.&lt;ref name="Peters 2008" /&gt; However, because of its key disadvantage of omitting emissions embodied in international trade, it is clear that consumption-based accounting provides invaluable information and should at least be used as a ‘shadow’ to production-based accounting. With further work into the methodologies of consumption-based accounting and sharing emissions responsibility, both can play greater roles in the future of climate policy.

A '''controversy surrounding the illegal repackaging of out-of-date meat''' led the [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[grocery store]] chain [[ICA AB|ICA]] to take actions towards a better quality work in the stores. Prosecutors have launched a criminal investigation into four stores in the ICA supermarket chain, after a television documentary aired on December 5, 2007, revealed that they had repackaged out-of-date [[ground meat]] and put it back on the shelves in four of the largest hypermarkets in [[Sweden]]. ICA apologised, suspended all of its [[Christmas]] commercials and summoned all 1400 store managers to an emergency meeting in [[Stockholm]].

==Background ==
[[Image:ICA Maxi i Kungälv, den 27 juni 2006.JPG|right|280px|thumb|A typical Maxi ICA Hypermarket.&lt;ref&gt;Pictured is a Maxi ICA Hypermarket in [[Kungälv]] that was not among the four stores implicated in the investigative documentary.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[ICA AB|ICA food stores]] in Sweden are all owned and operated independently, although operations are co-ordinated and wholesale operations are run centrally. ICA is 60% owned by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] retailer [[Ahold]], with the remaining 40% owned by Hakon Invest, which is majority owned by local store managers who are also [[franchising|franchisers]] of the ICA brand. In 2006, The Swedish division, ICA Sverige AB (literally: ICA Sweden Ltd), operated 1,397 retail stores, run by some 1,400 store managers. The largest stores are operated under the store brand ''Maxi ICA Stormarknad''; these are hypermarkets with a full range of groceries as well as fashions, homewares, entertainment and electrical goods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ica.se/FrontServlet?s=in_english&amp;state=in_english_dynamic&amp;viewid=555412&amp;showMenu=in_english_0_1 ICA Sverige AB] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214202719/http://www.ica.se/FrontServlet?s=in_english&amp;state=in_english_dynamic&amp;viewid=555412&amp;showMenu=in_english_0_1 |date=2007-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the food safety irregularities were revealed, the ICA brand was regarded as one of the most trusted retail brands in Sweden,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ica.se/file_archive/pdf/Arsred2006ENGlow070321.pdf ICA Sverige AB : Annual report 2006]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the most trusted retail brand among the grocery store chains.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=678&amp;a=723134 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205071509/http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=678&amp;a=723134 |date=December 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a general prohibition of relabeling packed meat for many years in Sweden.&lt;ref name="LMV"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071209111155/http://www.slv.se/templates/SLV_Page.aspx?id=20771&amp;epslanguage=SV Märking av kött], Livsmedelsveket (National food administration) official website.&lt;/ref&gt; The current legislation and a major part of the Swedish National Food Administration Regulations are based on [[European Union]] law.&lt;ref&gt;See in particular: The Food Act (No. 804) of June 8, 2006; and The Food Decree (No. 813) of June 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the National Food Administration, some 1,000 food safety inspectors make annually between 25,000 and 30,000 inspections in the country. As regards to the retail market, the local municipalities are responsible for controlling and acting against food safety irregularities.&lt;ref name="LMV"/&gt;

===Irregularities revealed ===
On December 5, 2007, [[Sveriges Television]] in its weekly investigatory documentary program ''[[Uppdrag granskning]]'' (literally: ''Mission: Investigation'') aired a number of secretly recorded video tapes of employees at four featured Maxi ICA Hypermarkets relabeling out-of-date [[ground meat]], as well as grinding down other forms of meat past their 'best before' date to make ground meat (mince). In a video sequence viewers could watch an ICA employee picking up out-of-date pork chops from the floor, repacking and relabeling them. This could lead to infections such as [[Escherichia coli]], [[Trichinellosis]] or [[Streptococcus suis]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dpd/parasites/trichinosis/factsht_trichinosis.htm Trichinellosis Fact Sheet | Division of Parasitic Diseases | CDC&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the rating institute ''MMS MediaMätning'', the documentary was one of the most watched television programs in Sweden that day, rating some 930,000 viewers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mms.se/report_week_se.asp Senaste veckan], MMS MediaMätning i Skandinavien.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hans Hallén, a former quality control manager for ICA, revealed that the company knew that meat was being illegally repackaged as early as 2003. Hallén, who monitored ICA stores in southern Sweden from 2003-2005, said he had informed the company's managers of the exact practices that were exposed in the documentary program. According to Hallén, many stores engaged in practices such as repackaging meat in order to change the 'best before' date, saying that "they even re-minced meat that had already been out on the shelves, before repackaging it and putting it back out on the shelves". Sausage meats that had become old and sticky were also repackaged after rinsing, he said.

Hans Hallén, who was one of eight quality control managers employed by ICA until 2005, when the position was discontinued, said that "(his) main job was to train staff in order to ensure that scandals of this kind would not occur".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sydsvenskan.se/sverige/article285216.ece|title=Ica varnades för fyra år sedan|publisher=''[[Sydsvenska Dagbladet]]''|date=2007-12-07|language=Swedish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208113650/http://sydsvenskan.se/sverige/article285216.ece|archivedate=2007-12-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/1.959796/krismote-pa-ica|title=Krismöte på Ica|publisher=''[[Expressen]]''|date=2007-12-07|language=Swedish|access-date=2007-12-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209050306/http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/1.959796/krismote-pa-ica|archive-date=2007-12-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The store managers who were confronted with the footage defended themselves, saying that "failures in routines and ignorance" were behind the practice, and that employees must have done this "on their own initiative" after being told to do so by management. However, according to ''Uppdrag Granskning'', Markus Lönnroth had also said that "everybody is doing this".&lt;ref name="SVT"&gt;[http://www.svt.se/svt/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?d=52710&amp;lid=puff_990032&amp;lpos=lasMer Systematiskt köttfusk på ICA], Uppdrag Granskning, Sveriges Television, December 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Although confronted with compelling evidence, Jonas Berg said that "there is no evidence that [he had] done anything wrong".&lt;ref name="SVT"/&gt; On December 13, it was announced that Markus Lönnroth had resigned and transferred ownership of his hypermarket to ICA Sverige.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/International/nyhetssidor/artikel.asp?ProgramID=2054&amp;Nyheter=&amp;artikel=1777085 Ica Supermarket Manager Resigns] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013041706/http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/International/nyhetssidor/artikel.asp?ProgramID=2054 |date=2008-10-13 }}, Sveriges Radio, December 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=678&amp;a=724557 Ica-handlare lämnar butik], Dagens Nyheter, December 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
Television viewers reacted strongly to the footage and the following day state prosecutors launched a criminal investigation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.city.se/nyheter/1.958888/aklagare-inleder-forundersokning Åklagare inleder förundersökning] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208121613/http://www.city.se/nyheter/1.958888/aklagare-inleder-forundersokning |date=2007-12-08 }}, Stockholm City, December 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been reports from at least two local food safety inspectors taking action. "After yesterday's program there are clear suspicions that a crime has been committed," said Daniel Selin, health inspector at [[Nacka|Nacka municipality]], one of the four municipalities to report stores.&lt;ref name="SSD"&gt;[http://sydsvenskan.se/sverige/article285376.ece Ica till full reträtt efter köttfusk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225235828/http://sydsvenskan.se/sverige/article285376.ece |date=2007-12-25 }}, TT via Sydsvenska Dagbladet, December 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

ICA chief press officer Staffan Ekengren said the company had provided all the information that it possessed about the stores to the National Food Administration. "This is unacceptable, and I am surprised that it is so common and happens on such a systematic basis," he said, adding that it was "a clear breach" of the law. Ekengren said that ICA quality control managers are to visit the relevant stores at the weekend to hold meetings with those in charge. He also said that ICA's 1,400 independent store managers were to be summoned to an emergency conference with focus on food safety and ethics. Although the independent status of the ICA stores means that there is no possibility of sanctions, Ekengren said the incidents "make it relevant to discuss" whether a system of sanctions could be introduced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.city.se/nyheter/1.959107/handlarnas-medlemskap-ska-omprovas Handlarnas medlemsskap omprövas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208121653/http://www.city.se/nyheter/1.959107/handlarnas-medlemskap-ska-omprovas |date=2007-12-08 }}, TT via Stockholm City, December 8, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; "These are large, successful stores which have acted in a completely irresponsible manner," he added. "We have had serious conversations with the merchants involved. They are naturally aware that a very major error has occurred," said Ekengren.&lt;ref name="SSD"/&gt;

On December 6, [[ICA AB|ICA]] decided to suspend all its [[Christmas]] commercials, and only focus on the meat packing scandal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://resume.se/nyheter/2007/12/07/ica-stoppar-reklamfilmerna/ ICA stoppar reklamfilmerna] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218202617/http://resume.se/nyheter/2007/12/07/ica-stoppar-reklamfilmerna/ |date=2007-12-18 }}, Resume, December 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/1.959074/ica-drar-tillbaka-reklamfilmer Ica drar tillbaka reklamfilmer] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208194948/http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/1.959074/ica-drar-tillbaka-reklamfilmer |date=2007-12-08 }}, Expressen, December 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; After criminal charges were brought against four of its stores, ICA issued an extended apology to its customers on its website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ica.se/FrontServlet?s=butiker&amp;state=butiker_dynamic&amp;viewid=1083343 Felaktig datummärkning av kött i ICA-butiker] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209112012/http://www.ica.se/FrontServlet?s=butiker&amp;state=butiker_dynamic&amp;viewid=1083343 |date=2007-12-09 }}, ICA Sverige AB, official website.&lt;/ref&gt; On December 10 there were reports of similar food safety irregularities also at ICA's main competing grocery store chains; [[Coop Norden]] and [[Axfood]] (with its store brands Hemköp and Willy's).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aftonbladet.se/blogg/article1447020.ab Coop och Axfood avslöjade som fuskare], Aftonbladet, December 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Axfood, at least two of the chain's store managers have been fired due to illegal repacking of meat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.svt.se/svt/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?d=78121 Flera butikskedjor har märkt om köttfärs], Aktuellt, Sveriges Television, December 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; On December 11, the Swedish National Food Administration filed criminal charges against the four Maxi ICA Hypermarkets where the irregularities had been revealed by the documentary for breach against the Food Safety Act and [[fraud]].&lt;ref name="SvD"&gt;[http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/artikel_675837.svd Köttfusk även hos andra kedjor], TT via Svenska Dagbladet, December 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 11, more than 1,000 of ICA's 1,400 Swedish store managers summoned at the emergency meeting in Stockholm, where CEO Kenneth Bengtsson said that the food safety irregularities had occurred also outside the four stores covered by the investigatory documentary. It was reported that ICA decided on "zero-tolerance" against food safety irregularities, as well as the introduction of an annual 3,000 un-announced self inspections throughout the network of ICA stores.&lt;ref name="SvD"/&gt;

After the food safety irregularities were revealed, sales of ground meat fell by up to 50% at some ICA stores.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=678&amp;a=723571 Fall för färsen hos Ica], Dagens Nyheter, December 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, a survey showed that 50% of the consumers have no trust in the food safety in the retail market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=678&amp;a=723863 Förtroendekris för butikernas hantering], Dagens Nyheter, December 11, 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205071509/http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=678&amp;a=723863 |date=December 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Indian Filipinos''' refers to [[Philippine nationality law|Filipinos]] of Indian descent who have historical connections with and have established themselves in what is now the [[Philippines]]. The term refers to Filipino citizens of either pure or mixed Indian descent currently residing in the country, the latter a result of intermarriages between the Indians and local populations.

[[Iron Age]] finds in Philippines also point to the existence of trade between the [[Indian Subcontinent]] and the Philippine Islands during the ninth and tenth centuries B.C.&lt;ref name="tamilculturewaterloo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tamilculturewaterloo.org/tamillanguage.htm |title=Tamil Cultural Association - Tamil Language |publisher=tamilculturewaterloo.org |accessdate=24 July 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413062503/http://tamilculturewaterloo.org/tamillanguage.htm |archivedate=13 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'s DNA study, "The Genographic Project", 3% of the average Filipino's genes are of South Asian origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/reference-populations-next-gen/|title=Reference Populations - Geno 2.0 Next Generation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Ancient history===
{{see also|Hinduism in the Philippines|Religion in pre-colonial Philippines|Indosphere|Indianisation (disambiguation){{!}}Indianisation|List of India-related topics in the Philippines}}
India had greatly influenced the many different cultures of the Philippines through the [[Indianized kingdom]] of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Majapahit Empire|Majapahit]], [[Khmer Empire]] and the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[Srivijaya]]. For at least two millennia before the arrival of Spanish, Philippines was ruled by Hindu kings called Rajahs and Pramukhas. Numerous kings with written genealogies and Sanskrit names were found by Spanish warlords and friars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|chapter-url=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/CollegePark/Pool/1644/precolonial.html&amp;date=2009-10-24+21:35:10 |chapter=Pre Colonial Period |url=http://geocities.com/CollegePark/Pool/1644/ |title=An Online Guide to Philippine History |publisher=geocities.comCollegePark/Pool |accessdate=17 May 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027023221/http://geocities.com/CollegePark/Pool/1644/ |archivedate=27 October 2009 |deadurl=unfit }}{{Unreliable source?|date=May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Indian presence in the Philippines has been ongoing since ancient times along with the [[Japanese people]], and the [[Han Chinese]], and Arab and Persian traders, predating even the coming of the Europeans by at least two millennium. [[India|Indian people]] together with the natives of the Indonesian Archipelago and the Malay Peninsula, who came as traders introduced [[Hinduism]] to the natives of the Philippines. Indian migrants have been crucial in the establishment of several Indianized Kingdoms or "Rajahnates" in the Philippines, Rajahates such as that of [[Rajahnate of Butuan|Butuan]] and [[Rajahnate of Cebu|Cebu]]. Indian [[Bania (caste)|Bania]] converts to Islam brought [[sunni Islam|Sunni]] [[Islam]] to the Philippine islands in the course of trade, which was later enhanced and strengthened by Arab Muslim Sea traders to Mindanao and Sulu Sultanate.&lt;ref name="philippinealmanac"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philippinealmanac.com/2010/07/528/the-cultural-influences-of-india-china-arabia-and-japan.html |title=2010/07/528/the-cultural-influences-of-india-china-arabia-and-japan |publisher=philippinealmanac.com |accessdate=24 July 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701082957/http://www.philippinealmanac.com/2010/07/528/the-cultural-influences-of-india-china-arabia-and-japan.html |archivedate=1 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 17th century, [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] merchants with the aid of [[Khoja]] and [[Bohri]] ship-owners had developed an international transoceanic empire which had a network of agents stationed at the great port cities across the [[Indian Ocean]]. These networks extended to the Philippines in the east, East Africa in the west, and via maritime and the inland caravan route to Russia in the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The South Asian Diaspora: Transnational Networks and Changing Identities|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134105953|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bwJD2WBNtNMC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=gujarati,+philippines#v=onepage&amp;q=gujarati%2C%20philippines&amp;f=false|editor=Rajesh Rai, Peter Reeves|accessdate=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonial Period===
Sepoy troops from Madras (now [[Chennai]], [[Tamil Nadu]]), British India also arrived with the [[Battle of Manila (1762)|British expedition and occupation between 1762 and 1764]] during the [[Seven Years' War]]. When the British withdrew, many of the [[Sepoy]]s (Army privates) mutinied and refused to leave. Virtually all had taken Filipina brides (or soon did so). They settled in what is now Cainta, Rizal, just east of Metro Manila.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rye|2006|p=713}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2006, between 70 and 75 percent of Indians in the Philippines lived in Metro Manila, with the largest community outside of Manila being in [[Isabela (province)|Isabela]] province.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rye|2006|pp=720–721}}&lt;/ref&gt; The region in and around Cainta still has many Sepoy descendants.

However, Indian business people started to arrive in larger numbers in The Philippines during the American colonial period (1898–1930s) - especially during the 1930s and 1940s, when many Indians and Indian Filipinos lived in Filipino provinces, including [[Davao City|Davao]]. The longest serving [[Mayor of Manila]], [[Ramon Bagatsing]], was of Indian-Punjabi descent, having moved to [[Manila]] from [[Fabrica]], [[Negros Occidental]] before the second world war.

A second surge of Indian businessmen, especially Sindhis arrived in Philippines during the [[Partition of India|1947 India-Pakistan partition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://bookshop.iseas.edu.sg/publication/1198|title=Rising India and Indian communities in East Asia|last=K.Kesavapany,|first=A.Mani and P.Ramaswamy|date=2008|publisher=LSEAS Publishing|year=|isbn=978-981-230-799-6|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Present===
Most of the Indians and Indian Filipinos in the Philippines are [[Sindhi people|Sindhi]] and [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] as well as a large [[Tamil people|Tamil]] population. Many are fluent in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and English as well as local languages of the provinces and islands. Many are prosperous middle class with their main occupations in [[clothing]] sales and marketing. [[Sikhs]] are involved largely in [[finance]], money lending (locally called ''Five - six''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indians in the Philippines|url=http://www.phindia.info/expats.php|work=Philippines Indian Business and Community guide|publisher=www.phindia.info|accessdate=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ), [[sales]] and marketing.

Over the last three decades, a large number of civil servants and highly educated Indians working in large banks, [[Asian Development Bank]] and the [[Business process outsourcing in the Philippines|BPO]] sector have migrated to Philippines, especially Manila.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Departments and offices|url=http://www.adb.org/about/departments-offices |work=Organisation|publisher=Asian Development Bank (ADB)|accessdate=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the Indian Filipinos and Indian expatriates are [[Hindu]], [[Sikh]] or [[Muslims]], but have assimilated into Filipino culture and some are [[Catholic]]. The community regularly conducts philanthropic activities through bodies such as the Mahaveer foundation, The SEVA foundation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community work|url=http://www.phindia.info/community.php|publisher=www.phindia.info|accessdate=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the [[Sathya Sai Organization|Sathya Sai organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Sai Haiyan mission|url=http://www.sathyasaiphilippines.org/author/radha/|publisher=Sathya Sai Organization|accessdate=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Indians congregate for socio-cultural and religious activities at the Hindu Temple (Mahatma Gandhi Street, Paco, Manila), the Indian Sikh Temple (United Nations Avenue, Paco, Manila), and the Radha Soami Satsang Beas center (Alabang, Muntinlupa City, Metro Manila). The late "priest" (scripture reader in Sindhi and Gurumukhi) of the Hindu Temple, Giani Joginder Singh Sethi, was active in interfaith affairs, accepted visits by school students, and organised the first major translation of Guru Nanak's Jap Ji into Filipino (Tagalog), translated by Usha Ramchandani and edited by Samuel Salter (published 2001).

Many Indians have intermarried with Filipinos, more so than in neighboring countries such as [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Singapore]], mainly because their populations are largely [[Muslim]], and the Indians there (with the exception of Indian-Muslims) are averse to marrying [[Muslims]] in those host countries.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Indian Communities in Southeast Asia (First Reprint 2006)|author1=Sandhu, K.S.|author2=Mani, A.|date=1993|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|isbn=9789812304186|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TeExjdWUmJYC&amp;pg=PA707|page=707|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian Filipino companies with the largest work force include Indo Phil Textile (1,800 employees), Global Steel (950 employees and 8,000 in Iligan), Hinduja Global (3,500 workers) and Aegis People Support (over 12,000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Enriquez|first=march|title=Meet some of PH's Fil-Indian businessmen|url=http://business.inquirer.net/24959/meet-some-of-ph%E2%80%99s-fil-indian-businessmen|accessdate=18 March 2014|newspaper=Inquirer|date=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lots of Indian students mainly from southern part of India are studying in various parts of Philippines notably in Davao, where more than 5000 Indian students are currently doing their MD program from Davao Medical School Foundation.Other cities like Manila, Cebu, Legazpi also have considerable number of Indian students.

'''Italian Canadians''' ({{lang-it|Italo-canadesi}}, {{lang-fr|Italo-Canadiens}}) comprise [[Canadians]] who have full or partial [[Italian diaspora|Italian heritage]] and [[Italians]] who migrated from [[Italy]] or reside in [[Canada]]. According to the [[Canada 2016 Census|2016 Census of Canada]], 1,587,970 Canadians (4.6% of total population) claimed full or partial [[Italians|Italian]] ancestry.&lt;ref name="Italian Canadians"/&gt; The [[Census in Canada|census]] enumerates the entire Canadian population, which consists of [[Canadian citizen]]s (by birth and by [[naturalization]]), [[landed immigrant]]s and non-permanent residents and their families living with them in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&amp;SDDS=3901|title=Census of Population|publisher=[[Statistics Canada]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Altogether, Italians are the seventh largest ethnic group in Canada after French, English, Irish, Scottish, German and Chinese. They are also often termed as Italian-Canadians with a hyphen.

== History ==

The first explorer to North America and to Canada was the Venetian [[Giovanni Caboto]] (John Cabot). His voyage to Canada and other parts of the Americas was followed by his sons [[Sebastiano Caboto]] and Janus Verrazanus ([[Giovanni da Verrazzano]]). During the [[New France]] era, France also occupied parts of Northern Italy and there was a significant Italian presence in the French military forces in the colony. Notable were [[Alphonse de Tonty]], who helped establish [[Detroit]], and [[Henri de Tonti]], who journeyed with [[René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle|La Salle]] in his exploration of the [[Mississippi River]].&lt;ref name=thecanadianencyclopedia/&gt; Italians made up a small portion of the [[population]]; in 1881, only about 2,000 people of Italian origin lived in Canada.&lt;ref name=thecanadianencyclopedia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/italian-canadians/|title=Italian Canadians|publisher=thecanadianencyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of Italians were imported to work as [[navvies]] in the construction of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]].

A substantial influx began in the early twentieth century when over 60,000 Italians moved to Canada between 1900 and 1913.&lt;ref name=pier/&gt; These were largely peasants from rural [[southern Italy]] and agrarian parts of the north-east ([[Veneto]], [[Friuli]]). Approximately 40,000 Italians came to Canada during the interwar period of 1914 to 1918, predominantly from [[southern Italy]] where an economic depression and overpopulation had left many families in poverty.&lt;ref name=pier/&gt; They mainly immigrated to [[Toronto]] and [[Montreal]], both of which soon had large Italian communities, up to 2% of Toronto's population in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sturino|first=Franc|title=Forging the chain: a case study of Italian migration to North America, 2000-1930|year=1990|publisher=Multicultural History Society of Ontario|location=Toronto|isbn=0-919045-45-6|page=168|url=http://www.ourfutureourpast.ca/loc_hist/page.aspx?id=3773759}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller communities also arose in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], [[Vancouver]], [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], [[Niagara Falls, Ontario|Niagara Falls]], [[Ottawa]], [[Sherbrooke]], [[Quebec City]], [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] and the [[Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean]] area. Many also settled in mining communities in [[British Columbia]], [[Alberta]], [[Cape Breton Island]] and [[Northern Ontario]]. The Northern Ontario cities of [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]] and [[Fort William, Ontario|Fort William]] were quite heavily populated by Italian immigrants. The 1905 ''Royal Commission appointed to Inquire into the Immigration of Italian Labourers to Montreal and alleged Fraudulent Practices of Employment Agencies'' exposed the abuses of immigration agents known as ''padroni''.

This migration was largely halted after [[World War I]], new immigration laws in the 1920s, and the [[Great Depression]] limited Italian immigration. During [[World War II]], Italian-Canadians, as well as [[German-Canadian]]s were regarded with suspicion and faced a great deal of discrimination. As part of the ''[[War Measures Act]]'', between 1940 and 1943, approximately 600 to 700 Italian-Canadian men were arrested and sent to [[internment camp]]s, such as [[Camp Petawawa]] as potentially dangerous [[enemy aliens]] with alleged [[fascist]] connections – in what was the period of [[Italian Canadian internment]]. While many Italian-Canadians had initially supported fascism and [[Benito Mussolini]]'s regime for its role in enhancing Italy's presence on the world stage, most Italians in Canada did not harbour any ill will against Canada and few remained committed followers of the fascist ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.italiancanadianww2.ca|title=Italian Canadians as Enemy Aliens: Memories of World War II|website=www.italiancanadianww2.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pier&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pier21.ca/culture-trunks/italy/history|title=History - Pier 21|website=www.pier21.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, former prime minister [[Brian Mulroney]] apologized for the war internment to a Toronto meeting of the [[National Congress of Italian Canadians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/italians-seek-new-apology-from-canada-for-wartime-internments/article1210950/|title=Italians seek new apology from Canada for wartime internments|publisher=The Globe and Mail|date=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second wave occurred after the Second World War when Italians, especially from the [[Lazio]], [[Abruzzo]], [[Friuli]], [[Veneto]], [[Campania]], [[Calabria]], and [[Sicily]] regions, left the war-impoverished country for opportunities in a young and growing country. Many Italians from [[Istria]] and [[Dalmatia]] also immigrated to Canada, during this period, as [[displaced persons]] (see [[Istrian exodus]]). Between the early 1950s and the mid-1960s, approximately 20,000 to 30,000 Italians immigrated to Canada each year.&lt;ref name=pier/&gt; By the 1960s, more than 15,000 Italian men worked in Toronto's construction industry, representing one third of all construction workers in the city at that time.&lt;ref name=pier/&gt; In the late 1960s, the Italian economy experienced a period of growth and recovery, removing one of the primary incentives for emigration.&lt;ref name=pier/&gt;

[[Pier 21]] in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] was an influential port of Italian immigration between 1928 until it ceased operations in 1971, where 471,940 individuals came to Canada from Italy making them the third largest ethnic group to immigrate to Canada during that time period.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pier21.ca/wp-content/uploads/files/First_75_Years/research_italians.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Demographics ==

As of the 2016 census 1,587,970 Canadian residents stated they had [[Italian people|Italian]] ancestry — 4.6% of Canada's population, and a six percent increase from 1,488,425 population of the 2011 census.&lt;ref name="Italian Canadians"/&gt; From the 1,587,970, 695,420 were single origin responses, while the remaining 892,550 were multiple origin responses. The majority live in Ontario, over 900,000, (seven percent of the population), while over 300,000 live in Quebec (four percent of the population) — constituting for almost 80% of the national population.

As of 2016, of the 1,587,970 population, 236,635 are Italian born immigrants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/hlt-fst/imm/Table.cfm?Lang=E&amp;T=21&amp;Geo=01&amp;SO=4D=|title=Data tables, 2016 Census|website=[[Statistics Canada]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 375,645 claiming [[Italian Language|Italian]] as their mother tongue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/dt-td/Rp-eng.cfm?LANG=E&amp;APATH=3&amp;DETAIL=0&amp;DIM=0&amp;FL=A&amp;FREE=0&amp;GC=0&amp;GID=0&amp;GK=0&amp;GRP=1&amp;PID=109977&amp;PRID=10&amp;PTYPE=109445&amp;S=0&amp;SHOWALL=0&amp;SUB=0&amp;Temporal=2016&amp;THEME=118&amp;VID=0&amp;VNAMEE=&amp;VNAMEF=|title=Data tables, 2016 Census|website=[[Statistics Canada]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Italian-Canadian media ==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2018}}

=== Radio and television ===

The first multicultural radio station in Canada ([[CFMB]]) began broadcasting at Montreal in 1962. Founded by [[Casimir Stanczykowkski]], a Pole, peak hours programming was nonetheless mostly in Italian. Four years later, in 1966, [[Johnny Lombardi]] founded a similar radio station ([[CHIN Radio/TV International|CHIN]]) in Toronto.&lt;ref name="band"&gt;{{Cite web

}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; CFMB has become a cultural bulwark for Italians in Montreal; however, the station's programming is often criticized as being geared only toward the older generations. Hardly any new pop songs from Italy, for instance, receive airtime, and older songs from the 1970s and 1980s are usually privileged. A short programme on Friday afternoons, ''Spazio ai giovani'', was introduced to address these criticisms. In late 2011, Serie A and some Serie B also found a home in Toronto, thanks to ''Stereo Serie A Radio'' on Radio Regent. The weekly show was made accessible via podcast on iTunes, Stitcher and Castroller.

[[Dan Iannuzzi]] founded the first multicultural television station in Canada ([[CFMT]]-TV), which began operations at Toronto in 1979. Now owned by Rogers Communications, the service has spun off into two multicultural television services in southern Ontario: OMNI-1 and OMNI-2.

[[TeleItalia]], an Italian-language television service, was founded in Montreal shortly thereafter. TeleItalia shared airtime with other multicultural programming at the station but had the most and best timeslots. TeleItalia programming included programming purchased from [[RAI]], the Italian state broadcaster, as well as numerous locally produced programmes, including the nightly newscast at six o'clock.

In 1997, a reform of the city's multicultural television station ([[CJNT]]) saw a drastic decline in the quality of all programming and major cuts to airtime. At one time, CJNT was on air for less than twelve hours a day. The [[CanWest Global]] company later purchased the station and has since improved programming. Nevertheless, there is now little Italian programming shown.

[[Telelatino]] (TLN) of Toronto, is widely available through cable distribution. Though offering programmes in both Spanish and Italian, most of TLN's revenue (70%) is derived from the latter. TLN, along with [[RAI International]], an arm of the Italian state broadcaster RAI, has recently been at the centre of a dispute over Italian-language broadcasting in Canada. Telelatino had carried since 1984 some RAI content in addition to locally produced shows and dubbed Spanish programming from Latin America. By the beginning of this decade, however, there was growing dissatisfaction with TLN programming, especially in Montreal. Critics in Montreal labelled TLN's locally produced shows too "Torontocentric" and poked fun at dubbed Spanish programming bought from Latin American stations. Most of these latter shows were soap operas filmed in the 1980s. [[Mediaset Italia (Canada)|Mediaset Italia]] is also available.

=== RAI controversy ===

In 2003, [[Rai Italia|RAI Italia]] pulled its content from Telelatino and petitioned the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) to set up its own channel. This effort was backed by [[Rogers Communications]]. The Italian community in Montreal was almost wholly in favour of admitting RAI. The Committee for Italians Living Abroad in Montreal (COM.IT.ES.), an arm of the Italian foreign ministry, led the campaign to have RAI admitted. The Italian community in Toronto, however, was divided. Some in Toronto saw the move as part of a scheme by Italian Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]] to gain greater influence over the Italian-language media in Canada. Italian law provides the Italian diaspora votes in Italian elections and permanent seats in the Italian parliament. Unlike the more independent Telelatino, RAI was widely seen as pro-Berlusconi. Those in favour of the RAI in Montreal pointed out that TLN quickly replaced its RAI programming with shows bought from SKY, a private television network. Berlusconi is said to have much more control over his private TV companies than over the state-run RAI.

In November 2003, community leaders in Montreal led a protest march in Ottawa under the slogan "RAI Now". They then presented a petition with some tens of thousands of signatures in favour of their cause. The CRTC initially turned down the application allowing RAI International to broadcast in Canada, declaring it would be impossible to set up a domestic Italian channel if that came to pass. In Montreal editorials lambasting the federal government and the CRTC were published in the community newspapers and leaders spoke out again a perceived injustice. With a federal election set for the summer of 2004, one in which the Liberal Party did not seem guaranteed a victory, opinion makers in Montreal began asking if Italians were simply not sheep herded along by the Liberals. (The great majority of Italians in Montreal are Liberal and federalist). Many called on voters to vote against the Liberal party which was blamed for the CRTC's decision. Ultimately, nervous Liberal candidates signed a statement days before the vote, guaranteeing that RAI would be broadcasting within a year or that the laws would be changed to permit it. The Liberals won their election and in the spring of 2005, the CRTC reversed its earlier decision. RAI thus began broadcasting in June of that year.

=== Newspapers and magazines ===

The first Italian-language newspaper in Canada was ''Il Lavoratore'', an anti-Fascist publication which was founded in Toronto in 1936 and active for two years. Then came ''[[La Voce degli Italo Canadesi]]'', founded in Toronto (1938-1940) and ''[[Il Cittadino Canadese]]'',  founded in Montreal in 1941, followed by ''[[La Vittoria]]'' of Toronto, in 1942-1943. After WWII came ''[[Il Corriere Italiano]]'', founded by [[Alfredo Gagliardi]] in Montreal in the early 1950s. ''[[Corriere Canadese]]'', founded by [[Dan Iannuzzi]] in 1954, is Canada's only Italian-language daily today and is published in Toronto; its weekend  (English-language) edition is published as ''Tandem''.

Other newspapers include ''[[Insieme]]'' (Montreal), ''[[Lo Specchio]]'' (Toronto), ''[[L'Ora di Ottawa]]'' (Ottawa) and ''Il Postino'' (Ottawa). ''Il Postino'' was established in 2000 by a young group of local Ottawa Italian Canadians to convey the history of the Italian community in Ottawa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilpostinocanada.com|title=Il Postino|website=www.ilpostinocanada.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Insieme'' was founded by the Italian Catholic parishes of Montreal but has since been put under private ownership. It nevertheless retains an emphasis on religious articles.

Many of the older Italian newspapers are criticized, like CFMB radio, for only serving the interests of the older generations. Several trendier, more modern magazines or newspapers have thus been founded. Many are run by recent Italian immigrants to Canada and are geared towards the youth. ''[[Panoram Italia]]'' magazine, a bimonthly publication distributed in the Greater Montreal and Toronto areas, is the most popular among them. Most others have failed or are published sporadically due to financial problems. The movement to support these upstart newspapers, however, is fairly strong in Montreal, where many people under age 40 still read Italian.

''[[Eyetalian]]'' magazine was launched in 1993 as a challenging, independent magazine of Italian-Canadian culture. It encountered commercial difficulty, and leaned towards a general lifestyle magazine format before concluding publication later in the 1990s. ''[[Italo (magazine)|Italo]]'' of Montreal is published sporadically and is written in Italian, with some articles in French and English, dealing with current affairs and community news. ''[[La Comunità]]'', while an older publication, was taken over by the youth wing of the [[National Congress of Italian Canadians]] (Québec chapter) in the late 1990s. It experimented with different formats but was later cancelled due to lack of funding. In the 1970s the trilingual arts magazine ''[[Vice Versa (1970s magazine)|Vice Versa]]'' flourished in Montreal. In, 2003 Domenic Cusmano founded ''[[Accenti]]'', the magazine with an Italian accent which focused on culture and Italian-Canadian authors.

=== Italian-Canadian books ===

Italian-Canadian literature emerged in the 1970s as young Italian immigrants began to complete university degrees across Canada. This creative writing exists in English, French, or Italian. Some writers like [[Antonio D'Alfonso]], [[Marco Micone]], Alexandre Amprimoz and Filippo Salvatore are bilingual and publish in two languages. The older generation of authors like Maria Ardizzi, Romano Perticarini, Giovanni Costa and Tonino Caticchio publish in Italian or in bilingual volumes. In English the most notable names are novelists [[Frank G. Paci]], [[Nino Ricci]], [[Caterina Edwards]], Michael Mirolla and Darlene Madott. Poets who write in English include [[Mary di Michele]], Pier Giorgio DiCicco and Gianna Patriarca. In 1986 these authors established the Association of Italian-Canadian Writers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aicw.ca/|title=aicw|website=www.aicw.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 2001 there were over 100 active writers publishing books of poetry, fiction, drama and anthologies. With the 1985 publication of ''[[Contrasts: Comparative Essays on Italian-Canadian Writing]]'' by [[Joseph Pivato]], the academic study of this literature started, leading to the exploration of other ethnic minority writing in Canada and inspiring other scholars such as Licia Canton, Pasquale Verdicchio and [[George Elliott Clarke]]. The important collections of literary works are: ''The Anthology of Italian-Canadian Writing'' (1998) edited by Joseph Pivato and ''Pillars of Lace: The Anthology of Italian-Canadian Women Writers'' (1998) edited by Marisa De Franceschi. See also ''Writing Cultural Difference: Italian-Canadian Creative and Critical Works'' (2015) editors Giulia De Gasperi, Maria Cristina Seccia, Licia Canton and Michael Mirolla.

== Education ==

On October 25, 2012, the Government of Canada announced its support of a project highlighting Italian-Canadian contribution to Canada. Funding aimed at raising awareness of the contributions of Canadians of Italian heritage in the development and settlement of Canada was announced by Julian Fantino, Minister of International Cooperation and Member of Parliament for Vaughan, on behalf of Citizenship and Immigration Canada.

CIC is providing $248,397 in funding under the Inter-Action Program to the Toronto district of the National Council of Italian Canadians (NCIC) to develop a curriculum intended for both primary and secondary level classes. The project is entitled "Italian Heritage in Canada Curriculum."

"The Inter-Action program aims to create opportunities for different cultural and faith communities to build bridges and promote intercultural understanding," said Minister Fantino. "This project will help promote a greater awareness of the many contributions of the Italian Canadian community to the building of Canada."

The curriculum will start with the Discovery of North America on June 24, 1497, and then turn to the various waves of immigrants that came to Canada from the 1800s to the present time. It will showcase Italian immigration to urban and rural areas across Canada and their contributions to the settlement of the west, then the building of railways, cities and infrastructure. The curriculum will recount the work of earlier generations of Italians, their plight during World War II when many were interned, and the contributions of more recent generations of Canadians of Italian heritage. It will also explore the wartime internment experiences of other cultural communities as well as their contributions to the building of Canada.

'''Joseph Nicolosi''' (January 24, 1947 &amp;ndash; March 8, 2017) was an American clinical [[psychologist]], founder and director of the Thomas Aquinas Psychological Clinic in [[Encino, California]], and a founder and president of the [[National Association for Research &amp; Therapy of Homosexuality|National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality]] (NARTH).&lt;ref name=officers/&gt; Nicolosi advocated and practiced [[Conversion therapy#Reparative therapy|reparative therapy]], a [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] and controversial practice that he claimed could help people overcome or mitigate their homosexual desires and replace them with heterosexual ones.

== Biography ==
Nicolosi described his theories in ''Reparative Therapy of Male Homosexuality: A New Clinical Approach'' (1991) and three other books. Nicolosi proposed that [[homosexuality]] is often the product of a condition he described as gender-identity deficit caused by an alienation from, and perceived rejection by, individuals of the subject's gender.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Joseph Nicolosi, Ph.D., ''Reparative Therapy of Male Homosexuality'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2004, {{ISBN|0-7657-0142-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like all forms of [[conversion therapy]], reparative therapy is [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]], based on faulty assumptions, opposed by mainstream medical and psychological practitioners, and potentially harmful to patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Haldeman|first = Douglas C.|year = 1999|title = The Pseudo-science of Sexual Orientation Conversion Therapy|volume = 4|issue = 1|journal = Angles: The Policy Journal of the Institute for Gay and Lesbian Strategic Studies|url = http://drdoughaldeman.com/doc/Pseudo-Science.pdf|quote = [T]he term "reparative therapy" ... inaccurately implies "broken-ness" as the distinctive feature of homosexuality and bisexuality. ... Since mainstream mental health organizations have rejected this position, the more accurate term for therapeutic efforts to change homosexual orientation is sexual orientation conversion therapy, or simply, conversion therapy. ... Theorists such as Nicolosi and Socarides maintain that homosexuals suffer from an arrest of normal development ... [but their theories] have never been empirically validated. ... [R]eviews show that no study claiming success for conversion therapy meets the research standards that would support such a claim. ... Conversion therapy is not just an individual mental health issue but has implications for society. This discredited and ineffective psychological treatment harms people and reinforces the notion that homosexuality is bad. In this regard, it is not a compassionate effort to help homosexuals in pain, but a means of exploiting unhappy people and of reinforcing social hostility to homosexuality. Herein lies the real "reparative therapy:" helping refugees of conversion therapy reconstruct their sense of identity and rediscover their capacity to love, as well as repairing a society still affected by the myth that lesbian, gay, and bisexual people are mentally ill. Reparative efforts are best directed toward a broken social context, not the individual who has been victimized by it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Ford|first = Jeffry G.|year = 2001|title = Healing homosexuals: A psychologist's journey through the ex-gay movement and the pseudo-science of reparative therapy|journal = [[Journal of Gay &amp; Lesbian Psychotherapy]]|volume = 5|issue = 3–4|pages = 69–86|doi = 10.1300/J236v05n03_06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = [[Australian Psychological Society]]|year = 2015|title = APS Position Statement on the use of psychological practices that attempt to change sexual orientation|website = psychology.org.au|publisher = [[Australian Psychological Society]]|url = https://www.psychology.org.au/getmedia/95cfcca4-009c-4a75-a0e7-597d68e5a55c/Position_statement_on_psychological_practices_that_attempt_to_change_sexual_orientation_members.pdf|accessdate = March 17, 2018|deadurl = no|archive-date = March 17, 2018|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180317021307/https://www.psychology.org.au/getmedia/95cfcca4-009c-4a75-a0e7-597d68e5a55c/Position_statement_on_psychological_practices_that_attempt_to_change_sexual_orientation_members.pdf|quote = [S]ome organisations and individuals practicing outside the remit of professional bodies such as the American Psychiatric Association or the Australian Psychological Society continue to advocate for therapeutic approaches that treat homosexuality and bisexuality as disorders. These are most commonly referred to as ‘reparative’ or ‘conversion’ therapies. Many such approaches are guided by particular interpretations of religious texts ...&lt;br /&gt;'''The APS strongly opposes any approach to psychological practice or research that treats lesbians, gay men, and bisexual people as disordered. The APS also strongly opposes any approach to psychological practice or research that attempts to change an individual’s sexual orientation.''' ...&lt;br /&gt;[T]he Code of Ethics [of the Society] states: "psychologists avoid discriminating unfairly against people on the basis of age, religion, sexuality, ethnicity, gender, disability, or any other basis proscribed by law” [and that] "in the course of their conduct, psychologists: a) communicate respect for other people through their actions and language, b) do not behave in a manner that, having regard to the context, may reasonably be perceived as coercive or demeaning, and c) respect the legal rights and moral rights of others". It should be noted, however, that this requirement not to discriminate and to respect clients’ moral rights does not equate to a justification to treat homosexuality or bisexuality as a disorder requiring treatment [as the Code also states that] "psychologists only provide psychological services within the boundaries of their professional competence. This includes but is not restricted to... b) basing their service on established knowledge of the discipline and profession of psychology".&lt;br /&gt;'''There is no peer-reviewed empirical psychological research objectively documenting the ability to ‘change’ an individual’s sexual orientation. Furthermore, there is no peer-reviewed empirical psychological research demonstrating that homosexuality or bisexuality constitutes a disorder.''' ...&lt;br /&gt;Psychologists are responsible for the professional decisions they make and may be liable to investigation for professional misconduct in the event a client makes a claim of maleficence. It is, of course, appropriate for psychologists to provide clinical services to clients who experience distress in regards to their sexual orientation. It is also appropriate for psychological research to be undertaken on this topic. However, the Australian Psychological Society advises that such practice and research should seek to understand ''the reasons for'' distress and how it may be alleviated. Evidence-based strategies to alleviate distress do not include attempts at changing sexual orientation, but could include challenging negative stereotypes, seeking social support, and self-acceptance, among others. (emphases in original)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He held a [[Ph.D.]] from the [[California School of Professional Psychology]]. Nicolosi was a founding member of the [[National Association for Research &amp; Therapy of Homosexuality]] (NARTH) and was its president for some time. NARTH is a professional association that promotes the acceptance of [[conversion therapy]]. He was an advisor to, and officer of, NARTH.&lt;ref name=officers&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.narth.com/menus/officers.html |title=NARTH Officers |accessdate=2010-05-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040803174911/http://www.narth.com/menus/officers.html |archivedate=2004-08-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.narth.com/menus/advisors.html |title=NARTH Advisors |accessdate=2010-05-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617025223/http://www.narth.com/menus/advisors.html |archivedate=2008-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, California passed a law that [[List of U.S. jurisdictions banning conversion therapy for minors|banned the provision of conversion therapy to minors]], including some of Nicolosi's existing patients. Nicolosi was named as a plaintiff in a [[Pickup v. Brown and Welch v. Brown|lawsuit challenging the law on constitutional grounds]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Second Lawsuit Filed against Calif. Gay Therapy Ban|url=http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2012/October/Second-Lawsuit-Filed-against-Calif-Gay-Therapy-Ba/|accessdate=23 August 2015|agency=CBN|date=October 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the law, effectively barring Nicolosi's clinic from taking on patients under the age of 18, was subsequently upheld. The Supreme Court later explicitly referenced this case.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-1140_5368.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in March 2017 at the age of 70 from complications from the flu.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Samantha (March 9, 2017). [http://www.thedailybeast.com/cheats/2017/03/09/ex-gay-therapy-leader-joseph-nicolosi-dead-at-70.html "'Ex-Gay Therapy' Leader Dead at 70"]. ''[[The Daily Beast]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stamp Aden Kathiri Seiyun 1942 2.5a.jpg|right|150px|thumb|A postage stamp of 1942 depicts the sultan and the capital city.]]

'''Kathiri''' ({{lang-ar|الكثيري}} ''al-Kathīrī,'' officially the '''Kathiri State of Seiyun in Hadhramaut''' (
{{lang-ar|السلطنة الكثيرية - سيؤن - حضرموت}} ''al-Salṭanah al-Kathīrīyah'' - ''Sayʾūn'' - ''Ḥaḍramawt'') was a [[sultan]]ate in the [[Hadhramaut]] region of the southern [[Arabian Peninsula]], in what is now part of [[Yemen]] and the [[Dhofar]] region of [[Oman]].

==History==
The Kathiris once ruled much of Hadhramaut but their power was truncated by the rival [[Qu'aiti]]s in the 19th century. The Kathiris were eventually restricted to a small inland portion of Hadhramaut with their [[Capital (political)|capital]] at [[Say'un|Seiyun]] (Say'un).&lt;ref&gt;[[Freya Stark]], ''The Southern Gates of Arabia: A Journey in the Hadhramaut''&lt;/ref&gt; The sultanate entered into treaty relations with the [[British Empire|British]] in the late 19th century and became a part of the [[Aden Protectorate]]. The Kathiri State declined to join the [[Federation of South Arabia]] but remained under British protection as part of the [[Protectorate of South Arabia]]. Al Husayn ibn Ali, Kathiri sultan since 1949, was overthrown in October 1967, and the following month the former sultanate became part of newly independent [[South Yemen]].&lt;ref&gt;Yitzhak Oron, Ed. ''Middle East Record'' Volume 1, 1960&lt;/ref&gt;

South Yemen united with [[North Yemen]] in 1990 to become the Republic of [[Yemen]], but local sheikhs in Yemen are reported to still wield large de facto authority.

The first [[Prime Minister]] in the history of [[East Timor]], [[Mari Alkatiri]] (''mar'ī al-Kathīrī,''), is a third generation descendant of immigrants from Kathiri, part of a significant migration of [[Hadhrami people|Hadhrami]]s to Southeast Asia in the 19th and 20th centuries.  This is reflected in his name (Alkatiri).

The Indonesian human rights activist [[Munir Said Thalib]] is also a descendant of immigrants from Kathiri.

'''Koreans in France''' numbered 12,684 individuals {{as of|2011|lc=on}}, making them the 3rd-largest [[Korean diaspora]] community in Western Europe, according to [[South Korea]]'s [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (South Korea)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade]].&lt;ref name="MOFAT2011"/&gt;

==Migration history==
Korean migration to [[France]] began in 1919, when the [[Cabinet of France|government of France]] issued work permits to 35 Korean [[migrant workers|migrant labourers]].&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a community of just 3,310 in 1988, their numbers more than tripled by 2000, and then grew a further 30% by 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lee-Le Neindre|2001|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mofat2009"&gt;{{harvnb|MOFAT|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, from 2009 to 2011, their population shrank by 14%.&lt;ref name="MOFAT2011"/&gt; The vast majority live in Paris — about two-thirds, according to 2011 data, compared with four-fifths a decade before — with the largest concentrations in the [[15th arrondissement of Paris|15th arrondissement]]. There more than twice as many women as men; the population has grown more gender-imbalanced as compared to a decade prior.&lt;ref name="Lee-Le Neindre 2001 p=2"&gt;{{harvnb|Lee-Le Neindre|2001|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MOFAT2011"/&gt; Unlike in the United States or Canada, with their large [[Korean American]] and [[Korean Canadian]] communities, few Koreans in France seek to [[French nationality law|naturalise as French citizens]].&lt;ref name="LeeLeNeindre"&gt;{{harvnb|Lee-Le Neindre|2001|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among all South Korean nationals or former nationals in France, 786 (6%) have become French citizens, 2,268 (18%) are permanent residents, 6,325 (50%) are [[international student]]s, and the remaining 3,305 (26%) hold other kinds of visas.&lt;ref name="MOFAT2011"/&gt;

Aside from South Korean expatriates, [[Korean adoptees|children adopted from Korea]] into French families form another portion of France's Korean population; most were adopted at between ages three and nine.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ventureyra|Palliere|2004|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of [[North Korean refugees]] has also been on the rise.&lt;ref name="RFA"&gt;{{citation|script-title=ko:프랑스 북한주민돕기위원회: "북한난민처리 기준 결의안 발의, 유럽의회에 올해 요청할 것"|periodical=Radio Free Asia|language=Korean|url=https://preview.rfaweb.org/korean/in_focus/french_human_rights_group_call_resolution_nk_refugee-20060118.html|date=2006-01-18|accessdate=2007-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Koreans in France are served by five [[Korean language|Korean-language]] weekend schools, the oldest and largest of which is the Paris Hangul School, established 18 August 1974; it enrolled 170 students as of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|NIIED|2007|loc=[http://www.interedu.go.kr/edu_net/overseas/sch_informal_inform.htm?no=215&amp;page=19&amp;key= 파리한글학교]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four others, in [[Villeurbanne]], [[Grenoble]], [[Strasbourg]], and [[Toulouse]], were established between 1994 and 2000; they enrolled a further 78 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|NIIED|2007|loc=[http://www.interedu.go.kr/edu_net/overseas/sch_informal_inform.htm?no=211&amp;page=18&amp;key= 그르노블한국학교]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|NIIED|2007|loc=[http://www.interedu.go.kr/edu_net/overseas/sch_informal_inform.htm?no=212&amp;page=19&amp;key= 뚜르즈한글학교]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|NIIED|2007|loc=[http://www.interedu.go.kr/edu_net/overseas/sch_informal_inform.htm?no=213&amp;page=19&amp;key= 리용한글학교]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|NIIED|2007|loc=[http://www.interedu.go.kr/edu_net/overseas/sch_informal_inform.htm?no=214&amp;page=19&amp;key= 스트라스부르그한글학교]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A significant number also attend French universities; in total, about half of the Korean population in France are estimated to be students, falling from two-thirds a decade ago.&lt;ref name="Lee-Le Neindre 2001 p=2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MOFAT2011"/&gt;

==Inter-ethnic relations==
Not many French people know that their country has a Korean community at all.&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt; In many cases, Koreans are mistaken for Chinese and thus lumped in as economic refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lee-Le Neindre|2001|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only about 200 of the South Koreans in France are members of [[international marriage|internationally married couples]] consisting of a South Korean partner and a French partner.&lt;ref name="Lee-Le Neindre 2001 p=2"/&gt; Such couples experience a number of cultural conflicts, most commonly over the rigour of their children's education.&lt;ref name="LeeLeNeindre" /&gt;

Portrayals in popular culture of Koreans in France include the 2004 [[Korean drama|South Korean television series]] ''[[Lovers in Paris]]''; its popularity has resulted in an increase in the number of Korean tourists visiting France.&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt; A more recent one is Hong Sang-soo's 2008 film ''[[Night and Day (2008 film)|Night and Day]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Dan|last=Fainaru|title=Night and Day|work=Screen Daily|date=2008-02-12|url=http://www.screendaily.com/night-and-day-bam-gua-nat/4037291.article|accessdate=2012-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kuku''' are a tribe from [[South Sudan]]. They inhabit the agricultural lands of [[Kajokeji]] County in [[Central Equatoria]] State. The Kuku speak a [[Bari language|Bari]] dialect, also called [[Kuku dialect|Kuku]].

They are chiefly a farming people relying on mixed farming. During the rainy season they grow substantial food crops, mainly [[sorghum]], (also known in Sudan as dura) maize, millet, cassava, sweet potatoes, and beans (loputu). In the dry season they manage a small scale of cattle, goats and sheep herding. The Kuku are good beekeepers. They also practice collective hunting during dry season. They go hunting with arrows and bows. They meet and prepare themselves. They tell everyone about it so that there is no problem. Warn other tribes to be ready for them. They also carry nets with them. The nets are very long and they  make a semicircle when the animals are inside. They close in fast sending the animal to the net. The animal gets trapped and other hunters waiting will stab the animal and it dies.

==History==

The Kuku people were part of a larger group known Bari-.  There was a good deal of in-fighting amongst the larger group and so they decided to spread out into places where each group felt more comfortable. The Kuku was the group that decided to move south and settle. There are rainmakers who are very famous in the tribe. After the first Sudanese civil war in 1972, there was an agreement amongst south Sudanese groups, and prominent members of the Kuku joined south Sudan's leadership.

==Administrative authority system==
Kuku have no centralized form of administrative authority. Their administrative system emerges from bottom to top as follows:

# Head of the Family – Husband (Monye Mede)
# Head of the Clan – Elder man in the Clan (Matat lo Köji)
# Head of the Village – Village Chief (Matat lo Gwoke)
# Head of the Area – Area Chief (Matat lo Paranet)
# Head of the Tribe – Head Chief (Matat lo Jur) highest authority man in the tribe

With their strong belief in God and God's works through their ancestors, the Kuku tribe has their chiefs associated with water. These chiefs are hence, responsible for rain controls during the crop growing seasons of the year.

==Kuku land and the district – (Kuku and Kajo-Keji)==
The land of the Kuku people is called Kuku and the administrative coverage area, which is the County, is given the name Kajo-Keji, after the name of the tribe’s chief (Kajok-Köji) who was in power during the British rule in the Sudan. Kajo-Keji lies in the southernmost part of the Southern Sudan near the Uganda border districts of Moyo and Yumbe. It has an area of almost 112,600&amp;nbsp;km² and composes of five administrative local areas known as Payams. These are:
* Kaŋapo I
* Kaŋapo II
* Lire
* Liwolo
* Nyepo
At the border to Moyo, there is a remarkable landmark called Jale Hill. It is a historically renowned hill which is known to both the Kuku and their Ma'di neighbours.

==Culture==

===Language===
{{main|Kuku language}}
The Kuku people speak a very similar language to some of the other groups in South Sudan like the Bari tribe. They speak the Bari language which originated from the Bari tribe. Their script was developed when the British colonized Sudan. They write using the Latin alphabet. In addition, they have a few other letters, and some letters familiar to English are omitted. Some letters that are not included like F and C.  In their language, anything you pronounce has its own way of saying it. The way you pronounce it is totally unique according to the tribe.

Alphabet:
A E I O U Ö – B D G J K L – M N P R S T – W Y ’B ’D Ý Ŋ – NY GB KP (capitals)

Words and meanings:
* Good Morning- Do puré
* Good Evening- Do parana
* Water- Piyong
* Come Here- Puo ni

They only use good morning during morning hours till noon and good evening through the afternoon till night.

Names that are given to a newborn child have many different meanings. The name of the first child is decided by the father unless he says otherwise.

=== Religious beliefs ===
The Kuku agricultural lifestyle is reflected in their religious belief and practices. They strongly believe that there is only one God and he lives somewhere above the skies. In practice, they believe that all happenings to a family, a clan or the whole tribe take place as a result of their deeds. God, who is merciful and kind, speaks and acts to the people through their ancestors. The word for God in Kuku language is Ŋun and for man is ŋuto analyzed as Ŋutu or separated into two words as Ŋu tu. The word ''tu'' in Kuku means exact.  Ŋutu then gives the  meaning of exact image of God. Ŋun is invisible and therefore speaks and acts to the people in spirit. The Kuku people believe that Ŋun sends strong messages to the people through the spirits of their ancestors. The word for Spirit in Kuku language is Mulökötyo. There are two types of spirits, good and bad. Good spirits are called Mulökö Lo’but٫ and bad spirits are called Mulökö Lorok.

* Mulökö Lo'but: speak and act to the people (grand children) by good messages of blessings like saving members of the family, clan or the tribe from disastrous moments. They bring sufficient rain at the right time of sowing food crops.
* Mulökö Lorok: do the opposite. They speak and act with bad messages of punishment to the grand children, like bringing sickness or even death to a family, clan or the tribe. They stop rain at the time of sowing food crops. Under this influence Kuku have maintained a strong family tree to keep them as close to Ŋun (God). In Kuku belief, you can only receive the Grace of God through your ancestral line, and that's if you have been doing good and follow their teachings.

With the penetration of Christianity missionary activity into southern Sudan, the Kuku traditional belief and religious lifestyle have been replaced with many Western Christian traditions.

===Art forms===

There are different types of dances performed by the Kuku tribe. Young members of the tribe often do a rain dance when there is a drought. Elders sometimes participate when they really want/need to. There are dances of mourning during funerals. Family members of the deceased abstain from dancing to show their grief. After a bountiful harvest, the whole community gathers and dances to show their happiness and thanks to the Spirits and God.

They make baskets from reeds and long grasses that they obtain from the landscape around them. They rarely use color for decoration in their tribe. Other handicrafts include making containers from gourds or other big fruits and from animal skin.

The Kuku are very fond of songs. They create songs for all kinds of subjects. Each and every song expresses a certain intense feeling. Most of the songs are based on true stories. For them, anything can be made into a song. While story-telling, the Kuku largely use animals as characters in their stories.  Elders are often the ones who tell these stories to the children.

For housing, they get bamboo from the mountains for their roofing and thatch it with grass. The walls are made from mud taken from an anti hill and neatly speared with soil taken from a river back to help keep the temperature cool inside.

For clothing today, they use modern Western clothing. Previously, they used fiber from trees that is flattened out and then wrapped around their bodies. They also used animal skin as clothing. They only used to cover the necessary parts of the body, like their midsection. They walked around barefoot. During special occasions, some of them wear a cow tail on their wrists for style. Sometimes, they wear feathers on their heads. The feathers come from a variety of birds, and the type or quantity worn shows status.  Earrings for women are made using pieces of scrap metal.

For body art, men have a choice to burn a scar onto their body in a design they desire.  Scarification is a personal choice and not an obligation. It is done as body decoration for others to admire. Only men are allowed to do this practice.

===Social behavior===

The Kuku play a game that is very similar to baseball called wuri. It involves hitting a hard fruit with a stick and running. The rules are exactly the same as baseball.

Elders play a game that they play on the ground. They make many indents and then use rocks (small gravels) as characters in their games. The game is called ''soroo''.

Children stay away from elders as a sign of respect. They are not supposed to talk with them at all. During some occasions, parents/adults will invite elders to come to their home for dinner.

After or during good rains, the whole community comes together to celebrate. The same can be said for harvests.

There are not strict working hours in Kuku society.  People can take a break when they desire and at any time of the day.

The Kuku have a special drink called yawanatakbe. It is an alcoholic drink made from sorghum. They eat foods like beans and meat everyday. Their first meal is usually at 7 in the morning,Lunch at around mid-day and dinner in the evening.

When it comes time for a young man to be married, a family will go to a neighboring community and get information about a girl in another family that is old enough to get married. If her personality and reputation is acceptable, a dowry (usually a pre-determined number of animals) is paid to the bride’s family.  The couple then are declared married by the elders. The couple will go and make a new house and stay there together, or the wife will go and stay with her husband in his parents' house.

When a child is born, the community comes together and celebrates the new addition.

After a person has died, the people are always gloomy, especially the family. They bury the deceased and then have a community meeting to bless the person and give him or her a good life with the spirits and God. They bury after two or three days normally. They talk about the cause of death with the relatives. If they come to a decision, the person is buried.This ceremony lasts for about a week.

===Social structure===

Men normally go hunting and farming during the day. Women spend most of the day working at farming and other chores. The women come home one hour earlier than men to start preparing the meal for the day. Young boys and girls are free to play and often assist in chores around the home. Occasionally, a father will take his son to teach him how to hunt and farm. A mother teaches her daughters how to do household chores. Adults, in general, must work very hard as a community to help the village to survive. Elders keep the law and order in the tribe/community.

In the village, the highest respect goes to the elders, then male adults, followed by adult women, and lastly, the children.

A person is viewed highly if he has a wealth of money or animals, or if he has many children or wives. Others respect him because having a large family means that you have enough wealth to care for a large number of people. The importance of a person in a community is normally attributed to their wealth (puet), how they have helped the community, or their age.

For a spouse to be chosen it takes a very long time and there are a lot of procedures. First, the groom’s family goes to another community and finds a girl with a good background and personality. If the groom has a bad reputation, he goes very far to find a bride. Then the bride’s family usually decides to go to the groom's village and find out information about the groom's family, to learn about their status in the community. If the family of the bride agrees, they are officially married. The girl would normally say yes to show respect. In the old days, the girl does not have a say in who she wants to marry. If the guy was rich, he could have any girl he wanted. If she resists, she is kidnapped by the husband. Now, there has to be a yes on both sides for a marriage to happen.

===Institutions===

A family unit in the tribe normally consisted of a husband and two wives with children. Extended families live in separate housing. The average number of children is seven.  Wives could be as many as the husband desired, but it was limited by his ability to care for them and provide the dowry.  Since the arrival of Christianity, marriage has become monogamous.  The father is always the leader of the family, and if he is gone, the first wife is then in charge of the family.

At first, the people of Kuku beliefs were pantheistic and often worshiped a river or a big tree in their village. People would go to these places whenever there was a need and they prayed to the rain God to give them water. Religion was not formal or important because they wanted to believe in something that would help them.  As time has passed, most Kuku are Christians and now pray on a daily basis.

In the community, most decisions are made by the elders, and solutions depend on the situation. If another group comes and raids or attacks their group, they will fight back to get back what was lost. In some situations, all the elders will come together and discuss on an appropriate solution. If a law is broken, the person that commits the crime must pay a number of animals to the family or tribe that was offended. If a person has committed murder he must pay seven cows, four goats and five sheep. This will be given to the family of the deceased.

Community rules include-

# Respect to all
# No stealing
# No adultery

All children are supposed to be taught by their parents. They teach about life and what they should do for a good life. Before being colonized, moral education was the most important. There was no formal schooling prior to colonization.  Children were taught at home. "To know what to do in life is always the most important feeling in life."

==Economic base==
The economy is almost entirely agricultural.  Most live on farms in the village, but some become artisans like blacksmiths or potters. Wealth is largely measured in the number of animals. Other products that are made are spears, knives, gourds, drums, flutes, and guitars.

Crops consist of sorghum, maize, rice, millet and other grains. Most other items are normally gathered from the bush. They also care for cattle, sheep, and goats. The people trade in communities; it is usually done through barter.

'''Leco''', also written as '''Leko''', is a [[language isolate]] that, though long reported to be extinct, is spoken by 20–40 individuals in areas east of [[Lake Titicaca]], [[Bolivia]].  The Leco ethnic population is about 80.

==Historical, social, and cultural aspects==

===History===
Apart from some brief lists of vocabulary, the main document for which Leco is known is a Christian doctrine compiled by the missionary Andrés Herrero at the beginning of the 19th century.  That doctrine was published in 1905 by Lafone Quevedo, who used it as a source to make a grammatical description of the language.  That work was virtually the only available document about Leco, until the linguist Simon van de Kerke (1994) located some speakers of the language and compiled some additional facts which enlarged the analysis of Quevedo.

===Use and description===
In Grimes (1988), Leco is classified as a [[language isolate]] and is considered extinct.  However, Montaño Aragón (1987) found some speakers of the language in the region of [[Atén]] and in [[Apolo, La Paz]], in [[Franz Tamayo Province]] in the [[Departments of Bolivia|Bolivian department]] of [[La Paz Department (Bolivia)|La Paz]], along Mapiri River &lt;!-- not [[Mapiri River]] in Brazil --&gt; in [[Larecaja Province]] (situated also in the department of La Paz).

Some speakers were relocated by van de Kerke (1994–97).  These speakers, mostly men, were older than 50 years and had not habitually used the language since a long time before that.  Van de Kerke relates that the speakers do not feel sufficiently secure to conduct a conversation spontaneously in Leco.

==Linguistic description==

===Phonology===
In regard to the phonology of Leco, one can point out the following (based on van de Kerke, 2009: 289–291).

Leco has six vowel phonemes: /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/ and /è/.  The opposition among the first five vowels is distinguished in the data, but the opposition between /e/ and  /è/ is found only in a limited number of words, as for example ''pele'' 'balsa' &lt;!-- [[es:Idioma leco]] has "balsa" and [[wikt:balsa#Spanish]] has 4 definitions --&gt; and ''pèlè'' 'name of plant'.

===Lexicon and classes of words===
In regard to the lexicon and the classes of words in Leco, one can mention the following (van de Kerke, 2009: 293–297):

*In Leco, four major categories of words are distinguished: noun, adjective, verb, and adverb.  Besides, the language has a group of minor categories: names of people, personal promouns, deictic pronouns, numerals, interrogative pronouns, etc.
*Nouns are characterized morphosyntactically by constituting the nucleus of a noun phrase and by allowing inflection of number and case.  Some nouns or substantives in Leco are ''won'' 'house' and ''phose'' 'daughter'. &lt;!-- [[MOS:SUBSET]] --&gt;
*In regard to the pronouns, Leco distinguishes four types: personal pronouns, such as ''era'' 'I', ''iya'' 'you (singular)', ''kibi'' 'he/she'; demonstrative pronouns, such as ''hoo'' 'this, near the speaker', ''on'' 'that, new the addressee' and ''hino'' 'that, far from the speaker and the addressee'; interrogative pronouns, such as ''ha'' 'who', ''u'' 'what', ''nora'' 'where'; and indefinite pronouns, expressed by means of dubitative phrases, composed of an interrogative pronoun and the suffixes ''-as'' 'also' and ''-ka'' 'como'.
*Leco has a large number of adjectival lexemes, which are characterized by expressing qualities of entities.  Thus we have, for example, ''lais'' 'bueno', ''suma'' 'small'.
*Leco has a decimal numeral system, composed of the following units: ''her'' 'one', ''too'' 'two', ''chai'' 'three', ''dirai'' 'four', ''bercha'' 'five', ''berphahmo'' 'six', ''toiphahmo'' 'seven', ''ch'aiphahmo'' 'eight', ''beepila'' 'nine', and ''beriki'' 'ten'.  The numbers six to eight follow a system in base five, as in [[Aymara language|Aymara]]: 6 = 5 + 1, etc.
*Leco has a limited number of adverbial lexemes, as, for example: ''kumte'' 'late', ''ch'eka'' 'yesterday', ''china'' 'very'.  Also, it has a group of postpositions, which express location and which are combined easily with the case markers, such as ''hekor'' 'afuera', ''apor'' 'near', ''haz'' 'down'.
*In regard to the verbs, these are characterized by functioning as the nucleus of the verbal phrase and by receiving inflectional suffixes of time and person, besides having a series of derivational suffixes.  Apart from the auxiliaries ''neck'' and ''kach'', Leco has intransitive, transitive, and ditransitive verbs.  A typical characteristic of this language is that of giving much attention to the position of objects.  It manifests itself, for example, in the following verbs, which always combine a noun expressing a position with the auxiliary ''kach'' 'to be': ''chelkach'' 'to be laid halfway over an object', ''lewakach'' 'to be hanging', ''chakach'' 'to be sitting', etc.

===Morphology===
In regard to the morphological characteristics of Leco, one can point out the following (van de Kerke, 2009: 297–313).
*Leco is a highly [[agglutinative language]] and it uses predominantly [[suffix]]es.
*In regard to morphology of nouns, nouns have inflection for number, by means of the pluralizing suffix ''-aya'', as in ''choswai-tha-aya'' [woman-DIM-PL] 'little women', and inflection for case, as for example the genitive ''-moki'', which is used with alienable entities like ''kuchi'' 'perro' in ''yo-moki kuchi'' [1SG-GEN] 'mi perro'; the dative ''-(i)ki'', which indicates direction or goal, as in (1); the locative ''-ra'' or ''-te'', which marks a locative complement or a directional locative, as in (2); the ablative ''-rep / -bet'', which indicates the locativee origin, as in (3), etc.

|}

*Nouns can be combined, furthermore, with a set of derivative suffixes, as, for example, the diminutive ''-tha'', which besides being combined with substantivees, as in ''won-tha'' [house-DIM] 'little house', is combined also with adjectives, as is seen in (4).  Another derivative suffix which affects nouns is the 'delimitative' ''-beka'', which expresses the idea of 'no more', 'only', as is seen in (5).  Leco has also deverbative derivative suffixes (which derive nouns from verbs), as, for example, the infinitivizer ''-sich'' in (6), which derives an infinitive form which functions as the subject of a sentence; and the agentive ''-no'', which form derived nouns which express an agentive, such as ''lamas-no'' [work-AG] 'worker'.

|}

*In regard to verbal morphology, verbs have inflection of person, which is formed by means of suffixes which mark the person of the subject and prefixes which mark the object&lt;!-- o el benefactivo/malefactivo --&gt;, as is shown in (7).

|-
|  || colspan=4 |‘My father has eaten the meat for me.’ (I was not able to eat any more)
|}

*As is seen in Figure 2, besides inflection for person, the verb in Leco can be combined with a series of inflectional suffixes (which mark, for example, distinctions of aspectual-temporal type).  By way of example, (8) shows the use of the suffix of indirect knowledge (CID) ''-mono'', which is combined with the verb ''moch'' 'say' from which it has been derived.

*In regard to the category of mood, in Leco one uses suffixes like ''-kama'' 'power', ''-bibi'' 'almost', among others, to indicate a possible event, as is seen in (9).  Leco has, besides, two forms of imperative of the second person, one directed to only one person and another directed to various persons, as is seen in (10a) and (10b).

*Verbs in Leco can be combined, besides, with a set of derivational suffixes, related to aspect, as for example the completive ''-hi'' in (11), to distinctions of movement, as, for example, the modifying suffix of movement ''wari-'' in (12), and to valence, as for example the reciprocal suffix ''-mo'' in (13) and the causative ''-ki'' in (14).

In Leco, one sees productive processes of reduplication.  With substantives, reduplication can be interpreted as 'a heap/much of', with adjectives, 'a high degree of'; with verbs the interpretation is very diverse and not always transparent; thus we have the reduplicate verb ''tiltilkach'' 'to be undone', derived from ''tiltil'' 'undone', which expresses a state or process, for which reason it is combined also with the auxiliary ''kach'' 'to be'.

=== Speech ===
In regard to the characteristics of spoken Leco, one can point out the following:
*As van de Kerke (2009: 315) points out, the order of the constituents is not fixed, although, in general, the subject takes the first position, especially if it involves a topicalized element.  Besides, the object often precedes the verb, as is seen in (15):

{| style="text-align: left; width: 50%" border="0"
|-
|(15)||''hino''|| ''yobas-ne'' ||'''''palanta'''''||'''''soh-cha-no-te'''''||''moki-a''||''choswai-ki''
|-
|  ||this|| man-TOP||platano||look at-PR-NML-DCL||GEN-3||wife-DAT
|-
|  || colspan=6 |‘This man is searching for platano for his wife (of another).’
|}

*Leco is a [[pro-drop language]]; this means that an explicit pronominal subject is not required, although this can appear as in (16) (''chera'' 'we'):

{| style="text-align: left; width: 40%" border="0"
|-
|(16)||''chera''|| ''du-kama-tean'' ||''Burua''||''da-in-tean''||''du-ch''
|-
|  ||we||speak-can-1&lt;small&gt;[[plural|PL]]&lt;/small&gt;||Leko||want-&lt;small&gt;[[negación|NEG]]&lt;/small&gt;-1&lt;small&gt;PL&lt;/small&gt;||speak-&lt;small&gt;[[infinitivo|INF]]&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|  || colspan=5 |'We can speak Leco, but we do not want to speak it.
|}

*In Leco, one sees simple and compound speech (van de Kerke, 2009: 316–324).  In regard to simple speech, diverse types are distinguished, such as, for example: existential specch, as (17), declarative speech, as (18), interrogative speech, be it confirmative, as (19a), or informative, as (19b), among others.

*In regard to compound speech, diverse types are also distinguished: juxtaposed speech, as (20), coordinate speech, as (21), and subordinate speech (causal, concessive, temporal, conditional, consecutive), as (22):

{| style="text-align: left; width: 45%" border="0"

{{Portal|Africa|Madagascar|Anthropology}}
The '''Malagasy''' ({{lang-fr|Malgache}}) are an [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] and [[Southeast Africa|Southeast African]] [[ethnic group]] native to the [[Island of Madagascar|island]] and country of [[Madagascar]]. They are divided into two subgroups: the "Highlander" [[Merina]], [[Sihanaka]] and [[Betsileo]] of the central plateau around [[Antananarivo]], [[Alaotra]] ''(Ambatondrazaka)'' and [[Fianarantsoa]], and the "coastal dwellers" elsewhere in the country. This division has its roots in historical patterns of settlement. The original [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] settlers from [[Borneo]] arrived between the third and tenth centuries and established a network of principalities in the [[Central Highlands (Madagascar)|Central Highlands]] region conducive to growing the [[rice]] they had carried with them on their outrigger canoes. Sometime later, a large number of settlers arrived from [[East Africa]] and established kingdoms along the relatively unpopulated coastlines. The [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] Africans mixed with the Austronesian settlers and this resulted in the today Malagasy people.

The difference in ethnic origins remains somewhat evident between the highland and coastal regions. In addition to the ethnic distinction between highland and coastal Malagasy, one may speak of a political distinction as well. [[list of Malagasy monarchs|Merina monarchs]] in the late 18th and early 19th century, the Malagasy people united the Merina principalities and brought the neighboring [[Betsileo]] people under their administration first. They later extended Merina control over the majority of the coastal areas as well. The military resistance and eventual defeat of most of the coastal communities assured their subordinate position vis-à-vis the Merina-Betsileo alliance. During the 19th and 20th centuries, the French colonial administration capitalized on and further exacerbated these political inequities by appropriating existing Merina governmental infrastructure to run their colony.  This legacy of political inequity dogged the people of Madagascar after gaining independence in 1960; candidates' ethnic and regional identities have often served to help or hinder their success in democratic elections.

Within these two broad ethnic and political groupings, the Malagasy were historically subdivided into specifically named ethnic groups, who were primarily distinguished from one another on the basis of cultural practices. These were namely agricultural, hunting, or fishing practices; [[architecture of Madagascar|construction style of dwellings]]; [[music of Madagascar|music]]; hair and clothing styles; and local customs or taboos, the latter known in the Malagasy language as ''[[Fady (taboo)|fady]]''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The number of such ethnic groups in Madagascar has been debated. The practices that distinguished many of these groups are less prevalent in the 21st century than they were in the past. But, many Malagasy are proud to proclaim their association with one or several of these groups as part of their own cultural identity.

== Genetics ==
Recent genetic studies on the Malagasy people showed that they have mixed African and Asian ancestries.&lt;ref name="Kusuma"/&gt; Three Malagasy populations, [[Temoro people|Temoro]], [[Vezo]], and [[Mikea]], have approx. 70% African ancestry and 30% Asian ancestry.&lt;ref name="Kusuma"/&gt;  

In a 2010 study, the [[Haplogroup B (mtDNA)#Tree|Polynesian motif]] (mtDNA haplotype B4a1a1a) frequency occurs varied among three ethnic groups: 50% in [[Merina]], 22 % in Vezo, and 13% in Mikea. There are two additional mutations (1473 and 3423A) found in all Polynesian motif carriers of Madagascar, hence named the Malagasy motif.&lt;ref name="Cox"&gt;Murray P. Cox, Michael G. Nelson, Meryanne K. Tumonggor, François-X. Ricaut, Herawati Sudoyo. ''[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3367776/ A small cohort of Island Southeast Asian women founded Madagascar]''. Proc Biol Sci. 2012 Jul 22; 279(1739): 2761–2768. Published online 2012 Mar 21. doi: 10.1098/rspb.2012.0012&lt;/ref&gt; The most likely scenario is that Madagascar was settled approximately 1200 years ago by a very small group, which consists of approximately 30 women; where 28 (93%) of them have Island Southeast Asian descent and 2 (7%) of them have African descent.&lt;ref name="Cox"/&gt;

The closest Asian parental population of the Malagasy are the [[Banjar people|Banjarese]] and other South Kalimantan [[Dayak people]] of south east [[Borneo]].&lt;ref name="Kusuma"&gt;Kusuma, P. et al. ''[http://www.nature.com/articles/srep26066 Contrasting Linguistic and Genetic Origins of the Asian Source Populations of Malagasy]''. Sci. Rep. 6, 26066; doi: 10.1038/srep26066 (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Many people of Madagascar share heavy Malay genetic affinity because of their ancestors who were known to have come from [[Borneo]] (present [[Kalimantan]], [[Indonesia]]) back in 7th or 8th century AD.

==Malagasy diaspora==
{{refimprove|date=April 2013}}
There is a community of Malagasy expatriates living in France and elsewhere in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[:Category:Malagasy expatriates in France|Malagasy expatriates in France]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Malagasy were among peoples taken captive and sold as slaves in the Atlantic slave trade of the 18th and 19th centuries. The best-known community of descendants are in Morropón ([[Piura]]), a city in northern [[Peru]]; the [[Afro-Peruvian]]s of Malagasy descent number about 7,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thepatriot.co.zw/old_posts/strong-african-presence-in-peru/ |title=Strong African presence in Peru |author=Maidei Magirosa |date=June 26, 2014 |publisher=thePatriot |accessdate=April 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They call themselves ''Mangaches'' or ''Malgaches.'' This section of Piura is called la Mangachería.

Malagasy slaves were also transported during slavery times to Brazil and the US, but their number and the number of their descendants in these countries is unknown. It is likely most of these descendants are not aware of their Malagasy ancestry. [[Robert Reed Church]], an African-American businessman in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] in the 19th century, was said to be of Malagasy descent through his enslaved mother.

'''Mark Jenkins''' (born 1970) is an [[United States|American]] [[artist]] who makes sculptural [[street installations]]. Jenkins' practice of [[street art]] is to use the "street as a stage" where his sculptures interact with the surrounding environment including passersby who unknowingly become actors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mutualart/the-surreal-art-of-an-urb_b_1426369.html The Surreal Art of an Urban Prankster &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] ''The Huffington Post'', April 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; His installations often draw the attention of the police.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journalnow.com/relishnow/article_f48dbcd9-d2d3-59fe-941d-eb69bd126ca1.html Testing the Limits: Artist's project misunderstood right off the bat, but it drew attention to art] ''Winston-Salem Journal'', October 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journalnow.com/relishnow/article_0b904f0a-8802-5995-b894-357d3e0c432e.html Police remove another piece of artist's work &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] ''Winston-Salem Journal'', October 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journalnow.com/relishnow/article_daaec832-3ada-568c-9654-0b23ae9d726d.html Artist's mannequin awaits permission to startle people  &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] ''Winston-Salem Journal'', November 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  His work has been described as whimsical, macabre, shocking and situationist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mb.mercedes-benz.com/en/article/1044/Urban+Theatre Urban Theater] mb!, April 17, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2095360/Dont-911-The-disconcerting-sculptures-causing-panic-streets.html Don't call 911!

In addition to creating art, he also teaches his sculpture techniques and installation practices through workshops. He currently lives in [[Washington, DC]].

== Life and Career ==

&lt;div style="float: right; clear: right; margin-left: 1.4em;"&gt;
[[Image:Storker metro.jpg|thumb|none|195px|''Storker Project'']]
&lt;/div&gt;

Jenkins was born in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], but first began experimenting with tape as a casting medium for creating sculpture in 2003 while living in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Wrapping the tape in reverse and then resealing it, he was able to make casts of objects including himself. One of his first street projects was a series of clear tape self casts that he installed on the streets of Rio de Janeiro.  Jenkins became immediately interested in the reactions of the people and considered his installation as much a social experiment as an art project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themorningnews.org/gallery/let-no-man-scare-you Let No Man Scare You&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] ''The Morning News'', March 30, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;''

&lt;div style="float: left; clear: left; margin-right: 1.4em;"&gt;
[[Image:Tape giraffe.jpg|thumb|none|185px|''Tape Giraffe'']]
&lt;/div&gt;

In 2004 he moved back to Washington DC and in 2005 he began working with Sandra Fernandez on the ''Storker Project'', a series in which clear casts of toy babies are installed in different cities to interact with their surrounding environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themorningnews.org/gallery/let-no-man-scare-you Let No Man Scare You&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] ''The Morning News'', March 30, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Jenkins and Fernandez continued to create other installations using tape animals--dogs playing in litter, giraffes nibbling plastic bags from trees, and ducks swimming in gutters. Other outdoor projects which explore [[culture jamming]] include ''Meterpops'', ''Traffic-Go-Round'', and ''Signs of Spring''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://boingboing.net/2007/03/14/mark-jenkinss-traffi.html Mark Jenkins's Traffic-Go-Round] ''BoingBoing'', March 14, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://laughingsquid.com/signs-of-spring-by-mark-jenkins/ Signs of Spring] Laughing Squid, March 31, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 Jenkins began the ''Embed Series.'' The tape casts were filled with newspaper and cement and dressed to create hyper realistic sculptural duplicates of himself and Fernandez. These new lifelike sculpture installations created confusion causing some passers-by to make calls to 911 which caused police and sometimes rescue units to arrive on his "stage".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/21/AR2006072100286.html That's Mark Jenkins All Over] ''The Washington Post'', July 23, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/01/us-germany-art-markjenkins-idUSTRE8101KI20120201 A Minute With: Street artist Mark Jenkins] ''Reuters'', February 1, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
In 2008 Jenkins collaborated with [[Greenpeace]] on an awareness campaign, ''Plight of the Polar Bears'', to draw attention to the [[Climate change in the Arctic|melting Arctic ice caps]]. Jenkins created realistic figures appearing to be homeless people but with plush polar bear heads. The installations resulted in bomb squads being deployed to destroy the works subsequently creating controversy over the regulation of public space in the post 9/11 era.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/news-and-blogs/news/homelessness-among-polar-bears/ As Arctic Sea Ice reaches 2008 low, Street Art project highlights shared fate of polar bears, humanity&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] ''Greenpeace USA'', September 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/daniel-kessler/homeless-polar-bears-ask_b_127201.html Homeless Polar Bears Ask for Change&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] ''The Huffington Post'', September 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://boingboing.net/2008/09/30/mark-jenkins-homeles.html Mark Jenkins homeless polar bear prank] ''BoingBoing'', September 30, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Jenkins has participated in public art events ''Interferencia'' (Barcelona, 2008), ''BELEF'' (Belgrade, 2009), ''[[Dublin Contemporary 2011]]'',  ''Inside Out'' ([[Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art]], Winston-Salem, 2009),''Living Layers'' (Rome, 2012) and ''Les Vraisemblables'' (''[[Nuit Blanche]]'', Paris, 2014).

Indoors Jenkins has exhibited internationally in galleries and museums as well as continuing his ''Embed Series'' in public settings such as cafeterias, schools and building lobbies. Solo shows  include ''Glazed Paradise'' at Diesel Gallery (Tokyo, 2008),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2008/06/19/arts/mark-jenkins-and-miho-kinomura-glazed-paradise/#.UWsbR4LbUSE Mark Jenkins and Miho Kinomura: Glazed Paradise] ''The Japan Times'', June 19, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; ''Meaning is Overrated'' at Carmichael Gallery (Los Angeles, 2009), ''Terrible Horrible'' at Ruttkowski;68 Gallery (Cologne, 2014), ''Moment of Impact'' at Lazarides Gallery (London, 2015)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Lazinc – Mark Jenkins - Moment of Impact | url = https://www.lazinc.com/exhibitions/46/ | accessdate = 19 July 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt;, and ''Remix'' at L'Arsenal (Montreal, 2016).

In 2018, he and Fernandez created ''[[Project84]]'', in London, England.&lt;ref name="Barr"&gt;{{cite web|title=Harrowing sculptures appear on top of ITV buildings to raise awareness around male suicide |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/itv-male-suicide-awareness-sculptures-building-roof-mental-health-project-84-calm-a8274326.html |first1=Sabrina |last1=Barr |website=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=27 March 2018 |date=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marris"&gt;{{cite web |title=Project 84: Charity CALM calls for action on male suicide |url=https://news.sky.com/story/project-84-charity-calm-calls-for-action-on-male-suicide-11305108 |first1=Sharon |last1=Marris |publisher=[[Sky News]] |accessdate=27 March 2018 |date=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ES"&gt;{{cite web |title=Eighty four harrowing suicide statues appear on roof of ITV studio |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/eighty-four-statues-of-male-suicide-victims-appear-on-itvs-southbank-studios-in-striking-campaign-a3799271.html |website=[[Evening Standard]] |accessdate=27 March 2018 |date=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was designed to raise awareness of adult male suicide.&lt;ref name="Barr" /&gt;

The '''Miyana''' are a [[Muslim Rajput]] community found in the state of [[Gujarat]] in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;People of India Gujarat Volume XXI  Part  Two edited by R.B Lal, P.B.S.V Padmanabham, G Krishnan &amp; M Azeez Mohideen pages 938-943&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and origin ==

The Miyana are [[Rajput]]s who were converted to [[Islam]] during the rule of [[Allauddin Khilji]] in the thirteenth century. According to other traditions, they were Rajputs of [[Sindh]] who immigrated to [[Kutch]] during the period of [[Jadeja]] rule.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Gujarat Volume XXI  Part  Two edited by R.B Lal, P.B.S.V Padmanabham, G Krishnan &amp; M Azeez Mohideen pages 938-943&lt;/ref&gt;

== Present circumstances ==

The Miyana are found throughout [[Kutch]] and [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]]. They speak both [[Kutchi language|Kutchi]] and [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]]. The community is sub-divided into a number of clans, the main ones being the Manek, Bhatti (Jesalmer), Dhona, Katiya, Mokha, Maman, Gagda, Mover (Mahur), Ladhani, Malani, Samani, Musani,Jeda,Traya, Manka, Khod, Makwana, Sadhwani, Kakkal, Baidmulla. Unlike other [[Muslim Rajput]] groups such as the [[Molesalam Rajput]] and [[Muslim Nayak|Nayak]] in [[Gujarat]], the Miyana do not practice [[gotra]] exogamy. Both parallel cousin and cross cousin marriages are preferred. The Miyana subsist by fishing and agriculture. Fishing is an important activity for the [[Kutch]] Miyana. They have their own caste association, the Sunatae Jamaat Maliya Miyana.

'''Mongsen Ao''' is a member of the [[Ao languages]], a branch of the [[Sino-Tibetan languages]], predominantly spoken in central [[Mokokchung District|Mokokchung district]] of [[Nagaland]], northeast [[India]]. Its speakers see the language as one of two varieties of a greater "Ao language," along with the prestige variety [[Chungli Ao language|Chungli Ao]].&lt;ref name="grammar"/&gt;

A chapter in the anthropological monograph of Mills (1926) provides a grammatical sketch of the variety of Mongsen Ao spoken in Longchang village. Coupe (2003) is one of the few [[Acoustic phonetics|acoustic]] studies published on a Kuki-Chin-Naga language (only three exist). Coupe (2007) is a reference grammar of the language, based on a revision of his PhD dissertation (Coupe 2004).

==Alphabet==
The Ao alphabet is based on the [[Latin script]] and was developed in the 1880s by the Christian [[missionary]] Edward W. Clark for Chungli Ao. The system is not based on phonemic principles and does not represent tone. A Christian Bible was published using the orthography in 1964. Coupe (2003) suggests a more consistent alphabet for Mongsen Ao.

'''A''', '''B''', '''Ch''', '''E''', '''I''', '''J''', '''K''', '''L''', '''M''', '''N''', '''Ng''', '''O''', '''P''', '''R''', '''S''', '''T''', '''U''', '''Y''', '''Z'''

==Phonology==
This section describes the sound system of Mongsen Ao as spoken in Mangmetong village and is based on Coupe (2007).

===Vowels===
Mongsen Ao has 6 [[vowel]]s:

{| class="wikitable IPA" style="text-align:center"
|- 
! rowspan="2" |
! rowspan="2" |[[Front vowel|Front]]
! colspan="2" |[[Central vowel|Central]]
! rowspan="2" |[[Back vowel|Back]]
|-
!&lt;small&gt;[[Phonation#Types of phonation|modal]]&lt;/small&gt;
!&lt;small&gt;[[Creaky voice|creaky]]&lt;/small&gt;
|-
![[Close vowel|Close]]
|{{IPA|i}}
|{{IPA|ʉ}}

| 
|{{IPA|ə}}
| 
| 
|-
![[Open vowel|Open]]
| 
|{{IPA|a}}
|{{IPA|a̰}}
| 
|}

* The [[Close central rounded vowel|high central]] {{IPA|/ʉ/}} is [[roundedness|rounded]].
* The two low vowels {{IPA|/a, a̰/}} differ in terms of [[phonation]] type. {{IPA|/a/}} has modal voice (i.e. normal phonation); {{IPA|/a̰/}} has [[creaky voice]] (also known as ''vocal fry'', ''laryngealization''). Coupe (2003) argues that this is a separate vowel [[phoneme]] and not a [[tone (linguistics)|tone]], a [[glottal stop]], or resulting from [[prosodic]] effects.

===Consonants===
Mongsen Ao has 26 [[consonant]]s:

* Dental consonants {{IPA|/t, tʰ, ts, tsʰ, s, z, n, l/}} are [[laminal consonant|laminal]] [[denti-alveolar consonant|denti-alveolar]].
* The post-alveolar approximant {{IPA|/ɹ/}} varies from an [[Apical consonant|apical]] post-alveolar to [[subapical consonant|subapical]] [[retroflex consonant|retroflex]]: {{IPA|[ɹ̠~ɻ]}}.
* The [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|/ʔ/}} occurs only at the end of words. However, in this position it contrasts with words ending in vowels: {{IPA|/āmī/}} 'spear' vs. {{IPA|/āmīʔ/}} 'person'. When a suffix is added to such words, the {{IPA|/ʔ/}} is deleted: {{IPA|/tʃàʔ/}} 'to eat' + {{IPA|/-ʉ̄ʔ/}} &lt;small&gt;CAUS&lt;/small&gt; → {{IPA|/tʃàʉʔ/}} 'to cause to eat'. Thus, the glottal stop has a somewhat marginal phonemic status.

===Tone===
Ao is a [[Tone (linguistics)|tonal language]] with 3 contrasting lexical tones:
* high
* mid
* low

All are register tones.

===Syllable and phonotactics===
The generalized [[syllable]] structure of Ao is abbreviated as the following:

:: (C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)V(G)(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)+T

'''(C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)'''

* Any of the 20 consonants may appear as an optional [[syllable onset]] (excluding the word-final {{IPA|/ʔ/}}).

'''V'''

* All 6 vowels may occur as the syllable nucleus.

'''(G)'''

* The optional [[Semivowel|glide]] elements following the head vowel are essentially non-syllabic offglide realizations of the 4 vowels {{IPA|/i, ʉ, u, a/}}. For example, {{IPA|/jàuŋ/}} → {{IPA|[jàu̯ŋ]}} 'species of centipede'.
* The following are the possible tautsyllabic combinations: {{IPA|[iu̯, ia̯, əʉ̯, əu̯, ai̯, aʉ̯, au̯]}}.

'''(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)'''

* The following consonants may occur in the optional [[syllable coda]]: unaspirated stops, nasals, and the rhotic {{IPA|/p, t, k, m, n, ŋ, ɹ/}}. The glottal stop with its restricted distribution also occurs but only word-finally.

'''T'''

All syllables occur with one of the three tones. In a VG sequence, tone only occurs the vowel head.

{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}

==Syntax==
Ao is an [[Subject–object–verb|SOV]] language with postpositions. Adjectives, numerals and demonstratives follow the nouns they modify, whilst relative clauses may be either externally or internally headed. [[Adverbial subordinator]]s are [[suffix]]es attached to the verb and the end of the subordinate clause.

'''Neophile''' or '''Neophiliac''', a term popularised by cult writer [[Robert Anton Wilson]],  is a personality type characterized by a strong affinity for [[novelty]]. The term was used earlier by [[Christopher Booker]] in his book [[The Neophiliacs]] (1969), and by [[J. D. Salinger]] in his short story [[Hapworth 16, 1924]] (1965).

==Characteristics==
Neophiles/Neophiliacs have the following basic characteristics:

* The ability to adapt rapidly to extreme change.
* A distaste or downright loathing of [[tradition]], repetition, and routine.
* A tendency to become bored quickly with old things.
* A desire, bordering on obsession in some cases, to experience novelty.
* A corresponding and related desire to create novelty by creating or achieving something and/or by stirring social or other forms of unrest.
* A complete objection to or distrust of commitment.

A neophile is distinct from a [[revolutionary]] in that anyone might become a revolutionary if pushed far enough by the reigning authorities or social norms, whereas neophiles are revolutionaries by nature. Their intellectual abhorrence of tradition and repetition usually bemoans a deeper emotional need for constant novelty and change. The meaning of neophile approaches and is not mutually exclusive to the term [[visionary]], but differs in that a neophile actively seeks first-hand experience of novelty rather than merely pontificating about it.

The opposite of a neophile is a [[neophobia|neophobe]]; a person with an aversion to novelty and change. Wilson observes that neophobes tend to regard neophiles, especially extreme ones, with fear and contempt, and to brand them with titles such as "[[witch]]," "[[satanist]]," "[[heresy|heretic]]," etc. He also speculates in his [[Prometheus Rising]] series of books that the [[industrial revolution]] and related [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] represents one of the first periods of history in which neophiles were a dominant force in society. Neophiles accelerate change because they like it that way.

==Types==
Open-source advocate and programmer [[Eric S. Raymond]] observes that this personality is especially prevalent in certain fields of expertise; in business, these are primarily [[computer science]] and other areas of high technology. Raymond speculates that the rapid progress of these fields (especially computers) is a result of this. A neophile's love of novelty is likely to lead them into subjects outside of the normal areas of human interest. Raymond observes a high concentration of neophiles in or around what he calls "leading edge subcultures" such as science fiction fandom, [[neo-paganism]], [[transhumanism]], etc. as well as in or around nontraditional areas of thought such as fringe philosophy or the [[occult]]. Raymond observes that most neophiles have roving interests and tend to be widely well-read.

There is more than one type of neophile. There are social neophiles (the extreme social butterfly), intellectual neophiles (the revolutionary [[philosopher]] and the [[technophile]]), and physical/kinetic neophiles (the [[extreme sports]] enthusiast). These tendencies are not mutually exclusive, and might exist simultaneously in the same individual.

The word "neophilia" has particular significance in Internet and [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker]] culture. ''The New Hacker's Dictionary'' gave the following definition to neophilia:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The trait of being excited and pleased by novelty. Common among most hackers, [[Science fiction|SF]] fans, and members of several other connected leading-edge subcultures, including the pro-technology '[[Whole Earth Review|Whole Earth]]' wing of the [[ecology movement]], [[space activist]]s, many members of [[Mensa International|Mensa]], and the [[Discordianism|Discordian]]/[[neo-pagan]] underground (see [[geek]]). All these groups overlap heavily and (where evidence is available) seem to share characteristic hacker tropisms for science fiction, [[music]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Research has uncovered a possible link between certain predisposition to some kind of neophilia and increased levels of the enzyme [[monoamine oxidase]] A.&lt;ref name="pmid16538181"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shiraishi H, Suzuki A, Fukasawa T, Aoshima T, Ujiie Y, Ishii G, Otani K | title = Monoamine oxidase A gene promoter polymorphism affects novelty seeking and reward dependence in healthy study participants | journal = Psychiatr.

'''No homo''' is a phrase used as slang at the end of a sentence to assert the statement spoken by the speaker had no intentional [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] implications.&lt;ref name="Weiner"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2224348/|title=Does This Purple Mink Make Me Look Gay? The rise of no homo and the changing face of hip-hop homophobia|last=Weiner|first=Jonah|date=2009-08-06|publisher=''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''|accessdate=2009-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase is also "added to a statement in order to rid [oneself] of a possible homosexual [[Double entendre|double-entendre]]".&lt;ref name="Weiner" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.fromthesquare.org/how-to-be-a-straight-man-reflections-on-no-homo-and-metrosexuality/#.WBUjKPkrLDc|title=How to be a straight man: Reflections on "No homo" and metrosexuality - From The Square|date=2015-06-25|newspaper=From The Square|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The phrase   originated in American [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] of the late 1990s as a way to quash any sexual and gender error or over boi step within lyrics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Joshua R.|year=2011|title=No Homo|url=https://www.academia.edu/980534/No_Homo|journal=Journal of Homosexuality|volume=58.3|pages=|via=Academia|doi=10.1080/00918369.2011.546721}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown states "the phrase no homo arose in Hip-Hop homo lyrics of the 1990s as a discourse interjection to negate supposed sexual? and gender transgressions".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The phrase ‘no homo’ used in a lyrical context comes as a pre-emptive maneuver to deflect any attacks on the artist's masculinity or heterosexual status.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Within this context, "No homo is not necessarily addressing homosexuality, but creating a verbal defensive in the musical battlefield that is wrought with [[Signifyin'|signifyn']] and bustin'. [Musicians] realize that a lyric, which is 'inadvertently gay,' is fodder for another's verbal attack on their masculinity within hip-hop culture. In an attempt to divert their own demasculinization, musicians presuppose those attacks at their masculinity". 

== Use of the phrase ==
As with many attributes of hip hop culture, the use of 'no homo' has become integrated into the mainstream North American vernacular. One reason for this as proposed by Brown is that the integration and reception of the specific phrase 'no homo' into the conversational dialect of [[North American English]] was simple and due in part to its phonetic resonance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Due to its association to the display of [[hypermasculinity]], the use of this phrase by young males can be attributed to the idea that "gender has constantly to be reaffirmed and publicly displayed by repeatedly performing particular acts in accordance to [[cultural norms]]".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Discourse Reader|last=Cameron|first=Deborah|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=|editor-last=Coupland|editor-first=Nikolas|location=London|pages=47–64|chapter=Performing Gender Identity: Young Mean's Talk and the Construction of Heterosexual Masculinity|quote=|editor-last2=Jaworski|editor-first2=Adam|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often viewed as humorous, particularly when in relation to a double entendre.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://linguisticpulse.com/2013/06/04/why-no-homo-is-homophobic-in-case-you-somehow-missed-it/|title=Why "no homo" is homophobic (in case you somehow missed it)|date=2013-06-04|website=linguistic pulse|access-date=2016-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of 'no homo' among women is far less commonplace.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Brown states that "women can and do use 'no homo,' although the instances are markedly less in frequency" because it is not unacceptable for a female to commit a gender transgression or display femininity through their modes of speaking.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hip hop artist [[Nicki Minaj]] used the phrase 'no homo' in her song "Baddest Bitch", stating in the lyrics: "And if he want some pussy that's a no-no/ I only fuck with bad bitches no homo".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Criticism of the phrase ==
According to some critics, no homo perpetuates the notion that homosexuality and gay people are lesser than heterosexuality and straight people.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Others have pointed out that the phrase is used among gay people.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; There are instances of LGBTQ people using no homo, though it is most often done so in a more ambiguous or critical light and does not reduce the homophobic qualities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For instance, it could be used by a gay man "when complimenting a straight man on his appearance...distancing the compliment from a sexual advance, when a gay man feels threatened or seeks to protect himself from misunderstanding"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; or if "a homosexual man said 'my fiancé (another man) and I are going to get married this summer, no homo'".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In these instances, the phrase was used either as a protective measure for one's legitimate misunderstanding or as an ironic commentary on the phrase itself.

Several social commentators have criticized the use of no homo in hip hop and in the mainstream. It has been said that the phrase "uphold[s] an unhealthy relationship with homosexuality, a relationship based in fear."&lt;ref name="Matson2"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/matsononmusic/2009546491_the_continuing_saga_of_kube_mo.html |title=The continuing saga of KUBE morning host Eddie Francis and American English's current homophobic lexicography |last=Matson|first=Andrew|date=2009-07-27|newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]]|accessdate=2009-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] commentator [[Marc Lamont Hill]] encouraged the hip hop community to stop using no homo in its music.&lt;ref name="Advocate"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.advocate.com/printArticle.aspx?id=90140|title=Roundup: Kiss-Ins Spread, 'No Homo' Must Go|date=2009-07-21|publisher=''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]''|accessdate=2009-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' columnist Jonah Mills suggested the use of the phrase is somewhat more complex. Weiner notes several hip hop artists{{spaced ndash}}such as [[Cam'ron]] and [[Lil Wayne]]{{spaced ndash}}cultivate an extravagant and [[Camp (style)|camp]] public [[persona]] while embracing [[homophobia]], thus saying no homo can help expand established concepts of [[masculinity]], and challenge the [[status quo]].&lt;ref name="Weiner"/&gt;

==Notable uses==

*In 2004, [[Jadakiss]] rapped "A real man shouldn't have to say No Homo" in his "It Ain't Hard to Tell Freestyle".
*In 2008, rapper [[Lil Wayne]] used the term in his hit song "Lollipop".
*In 2010, hip hop artist [[Nicki Minaj]] used no homo in her song "Baddest Bitch".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*In 2011, [[The Lonely Island]] made a parody of the expression with their song "No Homo" published in their album ''[[Turtleneck &amp; Chain]]''. The song begins with standard usage of the term and expands to be said after more and more blatantly homosexual statements such as "I've been thinking about fucking a dude (no homo)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jeffries |first=David |title=Review: Turtleneck &amp; Chain |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/turtleneck-chain-r2170521}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2013, [[Roy Hibbert]] of the [[Indiana Pacers]] stirred up controversy after he used the term in a post-game interview following a playoff game against the [[Miami Heat]]. Hibbert was fined US$75,000 by the [[NBA]] for his comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Garrison |first=Drew |url=https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2013/6/2/4389726/roy-hibbert-fine-nba-pacers-heat/in/4151423/ |title=Roy Hibbert fined $75,000 for post-game remarks |publisher=SBNation.com |date=2013-06-02 |accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hibbert said, "The momentum could have shifted right there if [James] got an easy dunk." "There was what – was it Game 3 here? I really felt that I let Paul down in terms of having his back when LeBron was scoring in the post or getting to the paint, because he stretched me out so much. No homo."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Golliver |first=Ben |url=http://nba.si.com/2013/06/02/roy-hibbert-homophobic-slang-indiana-pacers-miami-heat-press-conference-jason-collins/?sct=obinsite |title=Pacers' Roy Hibbert uses homophobic slang term in post-game press conference &amp;#124; The Point Forward - SI.com |publisher=Nba.si.com |date=2013-06-02 |accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hibbert later apologized for the remark and another obscenity he used during the press conference in a statement released by the Pacers: "I am apologizing for insensitive remarks made during the postgame press conference after our victory over Miami Saturday night," Hibbert said in the statement released by the Pacers. "They were disrespectful and offensive and not a reflection of my personal views. I used a slang term that is not appropriate in any setting, private or public, and the language I used definitely has no place in a public forum, especially over live television. I apologize to those who I have offended, to our fans and to the Pacers' organization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/playoffs/2013/story/_/id/9334504/2013-nba-playoffs-roy-hibbert-indiana-pacers-apologizes-postgame-gay-slur |title=2013 NBA playoffs - Roy Hibbert of Indiana Pacers apologizes for postgame gay slur - ESPN |publisher=Espn.go.com |date=2013-06-03 |accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Norwegian Sign Language''', or '''NSL''' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: ''norsk tegnspråk'', ''NTS''), is the principal [[sign language]] in [[Norway]]. There are many sign language organizations and some [[television]] programs broadcast in NSL in Norway. The [[NRK|Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] airs ''Nyheter på tegnspråk'' (News in Sign Language) daily and ''Tid for tegn'' (Time for Signs) weekly.

Norway is in the process of making NSL an official language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/kkd/press-centre/pressemeldinger/2008/norsk-sprak-ma-styrkjast---.html?id=520308 Ministry of Culture and Church Affairs]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relation to Malagasy Sign Language ==
The language is sometimes reported to be similar, or even identical to [[Malagasy Sign Language|the sign language]] used in [[Madagascar]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ethnologue.com/language/mzc Malagasy Sign Language, Ethnologue]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, while Norwegian Sign Language may have influenced Malagasy sign language via the creation of schools for the deaf by Norwegian Lutheran missionaries, the languages are quite distinct. Out of a sample of 96 sign pairs, 18 pairs were identical between the two languages, 26 showed some level of similarity, and 52 appeared completely unrelated. It is not yet known to what degree the similarities are a result of direct borrowing, borrowing from a common source language (such as [[ASL]] or [[International Sign]], [[onomatopoeia|mimesis]] of the thing they refer to, or sheer coincidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://repository.tufs.ac.jp/bitstream/10108/82035/1/acs088005_ful.pdf A Preliminary Study of Norwegian Sign Language and Malagasy Sign Language]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17432">{{otheruses|Fraternity (disambiguation)}}
'''Professional fraternities''', in the [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|North American fraternity system]], are organizations whose primary purpose is to promote the interests of a particular profession and whose membership is restricted to students in that particular field of [[professional]] education or study.  This may be contrasted with [[service fraternities and sororities]], whose primary purpose is community service, and general or social fraternities and sororities, whose primary purposes are generally aimed towards some other aspect, such as the development of character, friendship, leadership, or literary ability.

Professional fraternities are often confused with [[honor society|honor societies]] because of their focus on a specific discipline.  Professional fraternities are actually significantly different from honor societies in that honor societies are associations designed to provide recognition of the past achievement of those who are invited to membership.  Honor society membership, in most cases, requires no period of [[pledging]], and new candidates may be immediately inducted into membership after meeting predetermined academic criteria and paying a one-time membership fee.  Because of their purpose of recognition, most honor societies will have much higher academic achievement requirements for membership.  

Professional fraternities, on the other hand, work to build brotherhood among members and cultivate the strengths of members in order to promote their profession and to provide assistance to one another in their mutual areas of professional study.  Membership in a professional fraternity may be the result of a pledge process, much like a social fraternity, and members are expected to remain loyal and active in the organization for life.  Within their professional field of study, their membership is exclusive; however, they may initiate members who belong to other types of fraternities.

==History==
The first professional fraternity was founded at [[Transylvania University]] in [[Lexington, Kentucky]] in 1819: the Kappa Lambda Society of Aesculapius, established for the purpose of bringing together students of the medical profession.  The fraternity lasted until about 1858.

Of the professional fraternities still in existence, the oldest is [[Phi Delta Phi]] founded at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1869; however, Phi Delta Phi changed its mission in 2012 to become an honor society for law school students.

==Title IX applied to professional fraternities==
Professional fraternities, in the United States fraternity system, are usually co-educational in accord with Federal Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (commonly referred to as "[[Title IX]]"). This federal law discourages discrimination on the basis of sex in any college or university receiving federal financial assistance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/cor/coord/titleixstat.htm Title IX] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403084259/http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/cor/coord/titleixstat.htm |date=2007-04-03 }}, ''[http://www.usdoj.gov/ United States Department of Justice]''&lt;/ref&gt; However, the membership practices of social fraternities and sororities are exempt from Title IX in section (A)(6)(a). The [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]] (DOE) regulations adopted pursuant to Title IX also allow such an exception for "the membership practices of social fraternities and sororities." (34 C.F.R. Sec. 106.14(a)).&lt;ref&gt;"{{cite web |url=http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/cor/byagency/34cfr106.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930065112/http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/cor/byagency/34cfr106.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }} Code of Federal Regulations, PART 106: NONDISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF SEX IN EDUCATION PROGRAMS OR ACTIVITIES RECEIVING FEDERAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to Title IX, many professional fraternities were all male and most professional sororities/women’s fraternities were all female. Several of these professional fraternities and sororities even considered themselves both professional and social organizations because they often emphasized the social aspects of their activities. During the ensuing years since the enactment of Title IX, single-sex professional fraternities and sororities became coeducational to conform to Title IX. Several organizations simply opened their membership both men and women. For example, [[Phi Chi]] (medicine) opened membership to women in 1973; [[Phi Beta]] (music and speech) opened membership to men in 1976; and [[Delta Omicron]] (music) opened membership to men in 1979. A few single-sex groups merged with other organizations, such as [[Phi Delta Delta]], a women’s professional law fraternity, merged with [[Phi Alpha Delta]] (law) in 1972.

Despite the fact that Title IX was enacted in 1972, there continues to be professional fraternities and sororities or their chapters that have not become coeducational and therefore, do not conform to Title IX. Generally, these groups still claim to be both professional and social organizations, for instance, [[Alpha Gamma Rho]] (men in agriculture), [[Alpha Omega Epsilon]] (women in engineering), and [[Sigma Phi Delta]] (men in engineering).

Several social fraternities and sororities have membership practices of selecting their members primarily from students enrolled in particular majors or areas of study, including [[Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia]], [[Phi Sigma Rho]], and [[Triangle Fraternity|Triangle]]. Nevertheless, these groups are social, rather than professional, organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sinfonia.org/social Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia - Sinfonia's Classification]&lt;/ref&gt; Although they select members from students in a particular field of study, like a professional fraternity, they are single-sex social organizations because their purposes focus only on the social development of their members. Examples of groups that have been officially granted exemption from Title IX by the DOE to remain single-sex include [[Sigma Alpha Iota]] in 1981 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.sai-national.org/home/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=hc61lItdqQk%3d&amp;tabid=235| title = Sigma Alpha Iota| publisher =Sigma Alpha Iota }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.sinfonia.org/history.asp| title =Phi Mu Alpha| publisher =Phi Mu Alpha| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20140306140350/http://www.sinfonia.org/history.asp| archivedate =2014-03-06| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Umbrella organizations==
Many professional fraternities, particularly those of the highest esteem and reputation, are members of the [[Professional Fraternity Association]] (PFA).&lt;ref&gt;http://professionalfraternity.org/&lt;/ref&gt; This group resulted in 1978 from a merger of the [[Professional Interfraternity Conference]] (PIC) (for men's groups) and the [[Professional Panhellenic Association]] (PPA) (for women's groups).  In 2013, faced with an increase in campus policies that require student organizations to take all students, the PFA adopted a resolution against All Comers policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304025142/http://www.professionalfraternity.org/Websites/pfa/images/All_Comers_Resolution_090613.pdf|archivedate=March 4, 2016|url=http://professionalfraternity.org/Websites/pfa/images/All_Comers_Resolution_090613.pdf|title=All Comers Resolution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wpa-done.JPG|thumb|250px|right|A US government poster from 1940, summarizing the [[Works Progress Administration]]'s achievements.]]
'''Public works''' are a broad category of [[infrastructure]] projects, financed and constructed by the [[government]], for recreational, employment, and health and safety uses in the greater [[community]]. They include public buildings ([[City and town halls|municipal buildings]], [[school]]s, [[hospital]]s), [[transport infrastructure]] ([[road]]s, [[railroad]]s, [[bridge]]s, [[pipeline transport|pipelines]], [[canal]]s, [[port]]s, [[airport]]s), [[public spaces]] ([[public square]]s, [[park]]s, [[beach]]es), public services ([[Water supply network|water supply]] and [[Water purification|treatment]], [[sewage treatment]], [[electrical grid]], [[dam]]s), and other, usually long-term, physical [[asset]]s and [[Building|facilities]]. Though often interchangeable with [[public infrastructure]] and [[public capital]], public works does not necessarily carry an economic component, thereby being a broader term.

Public works has been encouraged since antiquity. For example, the Roman emperor [[Nero]] encouraged the construction of various infrastructure projects during widespread [[deflation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thornton |first1=Mary Elizabeth Kelly |date=1971 |title=Nero's New Deal |url= |journal=Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |volume=102 |page=629 |doi=10.2307/2935958 |jstor=2935958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview {{anchor|Overview}}==
Public works is a multi-dimensional concept in [[economics]] and [[politics]], touching on multiple arenas including: recreation (parks, beaches), aesthetics (trees, green space), economy (goods and people movement, energy), law (police and courts), and neighborhood (community centers, social services buildings). Essentially, it represents any [[construction|constructed]] object that augments a nation's physical infrastructure.

Municipal infrastructure, [[urban infrastructure]], and [[rural development]] usually represent the same concept but imply either large cities or [[developing nation]]s' concerns respectively.  The terms [[public infrastructure]] or [[critical infrastructure]] are at times used interchangeably. However, critical infrastructure includes public works (dams, waste water systems, bridges, etc.) as well as  facilities like hospitals, banks, and telecommunications systems and views them from a [[national security]] viewpoint and the impact on the community that the loss of such facilities would entail.

[[File:Public works in Reggio Emili, Italy.jpg|thumb|Public works in Reggio Emilia, Emilia-Romagna, Italy]]

Furthermore, the term public works has recently been expanded to include digital public infrastructure projects. The first (US) nationwide digital public works project is an effort to create an open source software platform for e-voting (created and managed by the Open Source Digital Voting Foundation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The TrustTheVote Project |url=http://www.trustthevote.org/background |date=15 May 2009 |publisher=[[OSET Institute]], Inc |location=Palo Alto, CA |accessdate=6 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312224013/http://www.trustthevote.org/background |archivedate=12 March 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflecting increased concern with [[sustainability]], [[urban ecology]] and [[quality of life]], efforts to move towards [[sustainable municipal infrastructure]] are common in [[developed nation]]s, especially in [[European Union]] and [[Canada]] (where the [[FCM InfraGuide]] provides an officially mandated [[best practice exchange]] to move municipalities in this direction).

== Public works programmes ==
A public employment programme (PEP)' or 'public works programme (PWP)' is the provision of employment by the creation of predominantly [[public goods]] at a prescribed wage for those unable to find alternative employment. This functions as a form of [[social safety net]]. PWPs are activities which entail the payment of a wage (in cash or in kind) by the state, or by an Agent (or cash-for work/CFW). One particular form of public works, that of offering a short-term period of employment, has come to dominate practice, particularly in regions such as [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Applied in the short term, this is appropriate as a response to transient shocks and acute labour market crises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2608&amp;title=typology-public-works-programming |title=A typology for Public Works Programming |date=December 2008 |publisher=[[Overseas Development Institute]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430171423/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2608&amp;title=typology-public-works-programming |archivedate=30 April 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investing in public works projects in order to stimulate the general economy has been a popular policy measure since the economic crisis of the 1930s. More recent examples are the 2008-2009 [[Chinese economic stimulus program]], the [[2008 European Union stimulus plan]], and the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]].

== Utility of investment ==
While it is argued that capital investment in public works can be used to reduce unemployment, opponents of internal improvement programs argue that such projects should be undertaken by the [[private sector]], and not the [[public sector]], because public works projects are characteristic of [[socialism]]. However, in the private sector, entrepreneurs bear their own losses and so private sector firms are generally unwilling to undertake projects that could result in losses or would not develop a revenue stream. Governments will invest in public works because of the overall benefit to society when there is a lack of private sector benefit (a project that will not generate revenue) or the risk is too great for a private company to accept on its own.

According to research conducted at the [[Aalborg University]], 86% of public works projects end up with cost overruns. Some unexpected findings of the research were that:
* Technically difficult projects were not more likely to exceed the budget than less difficult projects
* Projects in which more people were directly and indirectly affected by the project turned out to be more susceptible to cost overruns
* Project managers generally did not learn from similar projects attempted in the past&lt;ref&gt;Natuurwetenschap &amp; Techniek Magazine April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.home.nl/menno.visser/japaflyvbjerg.pdf Project peculiars] {{Dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally contracts awarded by public tenders will include a provision for unexpected expenses (i.e. cost overruns), that typically amount to 10% of the value of the contract.  This money is only spent during the course of the project if the construction managers judge that it is necessary, and typically the expenditure must be justified in writing.

There is no single system of [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]] or [[Ethnicity|ethnicities]] that covers all of [[Latin America]], and usage of labels may vary substantially. In [[Mexico]], for example, the category [[mestizo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Schaefer, Richard T. (ed.)|year=2008|title=Encyclopedia of Race, Ethnicity and Society|pages=898–902|publisher=Sage|isbn=978-1-4129-2694-2|quote=In sum, most people in Mexico consider themselves to be mestizos, or peoples of mixed cultural and biological descent. }}&lt;/ref&gt; is not defined or applied the same as the corresponding category of [[mestiço]] in Brazil. 
In spite of these differences, the construction of race in Latin America can be contrasted with concepts of [[race and ethnicity in the United States]]. The ethno-racial composition of modern-day Latin American nations combines diverse [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindian]] populations, with influence from Iberian and other European colonizers, and equally diverse African groups brought to the Americas as slave labor, and also recent immigrant groups from all over the world.

Racial categories in Latin America are often linked to both continental ancestry or mixture as inferred from phenotypical traits, but also to socio-economic status. Ethnicity is often constructed either as an amalgam national identity or as something reserved for the indigenous groups so that ethnic identity is something that members of indigenous groups have in addition to their national identity. Racial and ethnic discrimination is common in Latin America where socio-economic status generally correlates with perceived whiteness, and indigenous status and perceived African ancestry is generally correlated with poverty and lack of opportunity and social status.

==Concepts of race and ethnicity==
{{further information|La Raza|Limpieza de Sangre}}
In Latin American concepts of [[Race (classification of humans)|race]], physiological traits is often combined with social traits such as socio-economic status, so that a person is categorized not only according to physical phenotype, but also according to social standing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Schaefer, Richard T. (ed.)|year=2008|title=Encyclopedia of Race, Ethnicity and Society|page=1096|publisher=Sage|isbn=978-1-4129-2694-2|quote=For example, in many parts of Latin America, racial groupings are based less on the biological physical features and more on an intersection between physical features and social features such as economic class, dress, education, and context. Thus, a more fluid treatment allows for the construction of race as an achieved status rather than an ascribed status as is the case in the United States.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nutini, Hugo|author2=Barry Isaac |title=Social Stratification in central Mexico 1500&amp;ndash;2000|year=2009|page=55|publisher=University of Texas Press|quote=There are basically four operational categories that may be termed ethnic or even racial in Mexico today: (1) güero or blanco (white), denoting European and Near East extraction; (2) criollo (creole), meaning light mestizo in this context but actually of varying complexion; (3) mestizo, an imprecise category that includes many phenotypic variations; and (4) indio, also an imprecise category. These are nominal categories, and neither güero/blanco nor criollo is a widely used term (see Nutini 1997: 230). Nevertheless, there is a popular consensus in Mexico today that these four categories represent major sectors of the nation and that they can be arranged into a rough hierarchy: whites and creoles at the top, a vast population of mestizos in the middle, and Indians (perceived as both a racial and an ethnic component) at the bottom. This popular hierarchy does not constitute a stratificational system or even a set of social classes, however, because its categories are neither exhaustive nor mutually exclusive. While very light skin is indeed characteristic of the country's elite, there is no "white" (güero) class. Rather, the superordinate stratum is divided into four real classes—aristocracy, plutocracy, political class, and the crème of the upper-middle class—or, for some purposes, into ruling, political, and prestige classes (see Chap. 4). Nor is there a mestizo class, as phenotypical mestizos are found in all classes, though only rarely among the aristocracy and very frequently in the middle and lower classes. Finally, the bottom rungs are not constituted mainly of Indians, except in some localized areas, such as the Sierra Norte de Puebla}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ethnicity on the other hand is a system that classifies groups of people according to cultural, linguistic and historic criteria. An ethnic group is normally defined by having a degree of cultural and linguistic similarity and often an ideology of shared roots. Another difference between race and ethnicity is that race is  usually conceptualized as a system of [[categorization]] where membership is limited to one category, and is externally ascribed by other who are not members of that category without regards to the individuals own feeling of membership. Whereas ethnicity is often seen as a system of social organization where membership is established through mutual identification between a group and its members.

The construction of race in Latin America is different from, for example, the model found in the United States, possibly because race mixing has been a common practice since the early colonial period, whereas in the United States it has generally been avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Schaefer, Richard T. (ed.)|year=2008|title=Encyclopedia of Race, Ethnicity and Society|page=1096|publisher=Sage|isbn=978-1-4129-2694-2|quote=The variation of racial groupings between nations is at least partially explained by an unstable coupling between historical patterns of colonization and miscegenation. First, divergent patterns of colonization may account for differences in the construction of racial groupings, as evidenced in Latin America, which was colonized primarily by the Spanish. The Spanish colonials had a longer history of tolerance of non-White racial groupings through their interactions with the Moors and North African social groups, as well as a different understanding of the rights of colonized subjects and a different pattern of economic development.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blanqueamiento ==
{{main article|Blanqueamiento}}
'''Blanqueamiento''', or '''whitening''', is a social, political, and economic practice used to "improve" the race (mejorar la raza) towards [[whiteness]].&lt;ref name=Rahier&gt;Rahier, J.M. “Body politics in black and white: Senoras, Mujeres, Blanqueamiento and Miss Esmeraldes 1997-1998, Ecuador.” Ecuador, Women &amp; Performance: a journal of feminist theory 11.1 (1999): 103-120. http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/07407709908571317&lt;/ref&gt; The term blanqueamiento is rooted in Latin America and is used more or less synonymous with [[racial whitening]]. However, blanqueamiento can be considered in both the symbolic and biological sense &lt;ref name=Sawyer&amp;Paschel&gt;Sawyer, M.Q., and T.S. Paschel. “‘We didn’t cross the color line, the color line crossed us’ Blackness and Immigration in the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and the United States.” Du Bois Review 4.2 (2007): 303-315. http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=1917568&amp;jid=DBR&amp;volumeId=4&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=1917560&amp;bodyId=&amp;membershipNumber=&amp;societyETOCSession=&lt;/ref&gt; Symbolically, blanqueamiento represents an ideology that emerged from legacies of European colonialism, described by [[Anibal Quijano]]'s theory of [[coloniality of power]], which caters to white dominance in social hierarchies &lt;ref name=montalvo&gt;Montalvo, F.

Blanqueamiento was enacted in national policies of many Latin American countries, particularly Brazil, Venezuela and Cuba, at the turn of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Agier&gt;Agier, M. “Racism, Culture, and Black Identity in Brazil.” Bulletin of Latin American Research 14.3 (1995): 245-264.

An important phenomenon described for some parts of Latin America such as Brazil and Mexico is "[[Racial whitening|Whitening]]" or "[[Mestizaje]]" describing the policy of planned racial mixing with the purpose of minimizing the non-white part of the population.&lt;ref name="Stern, Alexandra Minna 2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stern, Alexandra Minna|year=2003|chapter=From Mestizophilia to Biotypology: Racialization and Science in Mexico, 1920–1960|title=Race and Nation in Modern Latin America|editor=Nancy P.

The solid-middle class presents the obverse phenotypic profile: predominantly mestizo, usually light skinned but including many individuals with noticeable Indian/African or European phenotypes. The lower-middle class, like the adjacent working class in the lower stratum, is overwhelmingly mestizo, and many of its members have very prominent Indian and/ or African features. There are also a few criollos (very light-skinned mestizos) and a sprinkling of individuals with a fully European physical appearance in these two classes. Thus, while there is a very striking increase in the proportion of European features as one goes up the social class scale in Central Mexico, there is sufficient variation within each class to prevent "race" (phenotypic perceptions) from playing a determinant role in interclass relations.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the United States where ancestry is used to define race, Latin American scholars came to agree by the 1970s that race in Latin America could not be understood as the “genetic composition of individuals” but instead “based upon a combination of cultural, social, and somatic considerations. In Latin America, a person's ancestry is quite irrelevant to racial classification. For example, full-blooded siblings can often be classified by different races (Harris 1964).&lt;ref&gt;http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s7846.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/4222t703 | title=The Japanese in multiracial Peru, 1899-1942| year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casta===
{{main article|Casta}}
During the [[Colonial spain|Spanish colonial period]], Spaniards developed a complex [[caste system]] based on race, which was used for social control and which also determined a person's rights in society.&lt;ref name= "Acuña-p23-24"&gt;{{Citation |last= Acuña |first= Rodolfo F. |authorlink= Rodolfo F. Acuña |title= Occupied America: A History of Chicanos |edition= 7th |year= 2011 |publisher= Longman |location= Boston |isbn= 978-0-205-78618-3 |pages= 23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were four main categories of race: (1) [[Peninsular]] - a [[Spaniard]] born in Spain, (2) [[Criollo people|Criollo]] (fem. criolla) - a person of Spanish descent born in [[Mesoamerica]], (3) [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indio]] (fem.

The Castizos which had one Mestizo parent and one Spanish parent, the children of a Castizo were generally accepted as a [[Criollo people|Criollo]]. [[Mulatto]]/Mulatta were usually the ones with one Spanish and one black parent, if a mulatto was born in slavery they were considered slaves as well unless the mother was free then they would be free too.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Spanish Colonial Casta System|url = http://www.bellavistaranch.net/genealogy/casta.html|website = www.bellavistaranch.net|accessdate = 2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mexico==
{{main article|Mexicans#Ethnic groups}}
Very generally speaking ethno-racial relations can be arranged on an axis between the two extremes of European and Amerindian cultural and biological heritage, this is a remnant of the colonial Spanish caste system which categorized individuals according to their perceived level of biological mixture between the two groups. Additionally the presence of considerable portions of the population with partly African and Asian heritage further complicates the situation. Even though it still arranges persons along the line between indigenous and European, in practice the classificatory system is no longer biologically based, but rather mixes socio-cultural traits with phenotypical traits, and classification is largely fluid, allowing individuals to move between categories and define their ethnic and racial identities situationally.&lt;ref&gt;Bartolomé (1996:2)"''En primer lugar cabe destacar que en México la pertenencia racial no es un indicador relevante ni suficiente para denotar una adscripción étnica específica. El proceso de mestizaje no ha sido sólo biológico sino básicamente social y cultural, por ello personas racialmente indígenas pueden asumirse y definirse culturalmente como mestizas. De esta manera ser o no ser indígena representa un acto de afirmación o de negación lingüística y cultural, que excluye la pertenencia a un fenotipo racial particular. Por lo tanto es relativamente factible realizar el llamado tránsito étnico, es decir que un indígena puede llegar a incorporarse al sector mestizo a través de la renuncia a su cultura tradicional y si sus condiciones materiales se lo permiten. Este acto supone tanto la aceptación de un estilo de vida alterno como la negación del propio, incluyendo la no enseñanza de la lengua a sus hijos. Pero muy difícilmente ocurre lo contrario; esto es que individuos fenotípicamente "blancos", pretendan reivindicar una adscripción indígena. Sin embargo, y con gran frecuencia, esas mismas personas considerarán a los indígenas como sus antepasados, fundadores de una "nación mexicana" que ahora les pertenece en calidad de herederos.''"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knight (1990:74)&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, it can be said that in scholarship, as well as popular discourse, there has been a tendency of talking about indigenous peoples in terms of ethnicity, about Afro-minorities and white socio-economic privilege in terms of race, and about mestizos in tems of national identity. It is now however becoming recognized that processes of identity formation and social stratification in regards to all population groups in Mexico can be analyzed both in terms of race and of ethnicity.

===Mestizos===
The large majority of Mexicans classify themselves as "[[Mestizo]]s", meaning that they neither identify fully with any indigenous culture or with a particular non-Mexican heritage, but rather identify as having cultural traits and heritage that is mixed by elements from indigenous and European traditions.  By the deliberate efforts of post-revolutionary governments the "Mestizo identity" was constructed as the base of the modern Mexican national identity, through a process of cultural synthesis referred to as [[mestizaje]]. Mexican politicians and reformers such as [[José Vasconcelos]] and [[Manuel Gamio]] were instrumental in building a Mexican national identity on the concept of mestizaje (see the section below).&lt;ref&gt;Wade (1981:32)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knight (1990:78-85)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Mestizo" is not in wide use in Mexican society today and has been dropped as a category in population censuses, it is however still used in social and cultural studies when referring to the non-indigenous part of the Mexican population. The word has somewhat pejorative connotations and most of the Mexican citizens who would be defined as mestizos in the sociological literature would probably self-identify primarily as Mexicans. In the Yucatán peninsula, the word Mestizo is even used about [[Yucatec Maya language|Maya]] speaking populations living in traditional communities, because during the [[Caste War of Yucatán|Caste War]] of the late 19th century those Maya who did not join the rebellion were classified as mestizos.&lt;ref name="Bartolomé 1996:2"&gt;Bartolomé (1996:2)&lt;/ref&gt; In Chiapas the word "Ladino" is used instead of mestizo.&lt;ref&gt;Wade (1997:44-47)&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, particularly outside of Mexico, the word "mestizo" is used with the meaning of a person with mixed indigenous and European blood. This usage does not conform to the Mexican social reality where, like in Brazil, a person of mostly indigenous genetic heritage would be considered Mestizo either by rejecting his indigenous culture or by not speaking an indigenous language,&lt;ref name="Bartolomé 1996:2"/&gt; and a person with a very low percentage of indigenous genetic heritage would be considered fully indigenous either by speaking an indigenous language or by identifying with a particular indigenous cultural heritage.&lt;ref name="Knight 1990:73"&gt;Knight (1990:73)&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally the categories carry additional meanings having to do with social class so that the term indigena or the more pejorative "indio" (Indian) is connected with ideas of low social class, poverty, rural background, superstition, being dominated by traditional values as opposed to reason. Commonly, instead of the term Mestizo, which also has a somewhat pejorative usage, the term "gente de razón" ("people of reason") is used and contrasted with "gente de costumbre" ("people of tradition"), cementing the status of indigeneity being connected to superstition and backwardness. For example, it has been observed that upwards social mobility is generally correlated with "whitening", if persons with indigenous biological and cultural roots rise to positions of power and prestige they tend to be viewed as more "white" than if they belonged to a lower social class.&lt;ref name="Knight 1990:73"/&gt;

===Indigenous groups===

Prior to contact with Europeans the indigenous peoples of Mexico had not had any kind of shared identity.&lt;ref&gt;Knight (1990:75)&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous identity was constructed by the dominant Euro-Mestizo majority and imposed upon the indigenous people as a negatively defined identity, characterized by the lack of assimilation into modern Mexico. Indian identity therefore became  socially stigmatizing.&lt;ref&gt;Friedlander (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;  Cultural policies in early post-revolutionary Mexico were paternalistic towards the indigenous people, with efforts designed to "help" indigenous peoples achieve the same level of progress as the rest of society, eventually assimilating indigenous peoples completely to Mestizo Mexican culture, working toward the goal of eventually solving the "indian problem" by transforming indigenous communities into mestizo communities .&lt;ref&gt;Bartolomé (1996:5)&lt;/ref&gt;

The category of "indigena" (indigenous) can be defined narrowly according to linguistic criteria including only persons that speak one of [[Languages of Mexico|Mexico's 62 indigenous languages]], this is the categorization used by the National Mexican Institute of Statistics. It can also be defined broadly to include all persons who self-identify as having an indigenous cultural background, whether or not they speak the language of the indigenous group they identify with. This means that the percentage of the Mexican population defined as "indigenous" varies according to the definition applied, cultural activists have referred to the usage of the narrow definition of the term for census purposes as "statistical genocide".&lt;ref&gt;Knight (1990:73-74)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bartolomé (1996:3-4)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mestizaje===
{{main article|Mestizaje}}
In Mexico in the post-revolutionary period, Mestizaje was a racial ideology that combined elements of the Euro-American ideologies of the racial superiority of the "white race" with the social reality of a postcolonial, multiracial setting. It promoted the use of planned [[miscegenation]] as a [[eugenics|eugenic strategy]] designed to improve the overall quality of the population by multiplying white genetic material to the entire population. This ideology was very different from the way the eugenics debate was carried out in Europe and North America, where racial "purity" and anti-miscegenation legislation was the eugenic strategy of choice. The ideology of Mestizaje came from the long tradition of tolerance of racial mixing that existed in the Spanish colonies.&lt;ref name="Stern, Alexandra Minna 2003"/&gt;

The ideology was also a part of the strategy of forging a national identity to serve as the basis of a modern nation state, and for this reason mestizaje also became a way of fusing disparate cultural identities into a single national ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wimmer, Andreas|year=2002|title=Nationalist exclusion and ethnic conflict: shadows of modernity|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=115|quote=This new politicisation of ethnicity finally led to the peculiar form of multi-ethnic nationalism that we find in present day Mexico.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Poole, Deborah (ed.)|year=2008|title=Companion to Latin American Anthropology|publisher=Blackwell publishing|pages=3|quote=Most notably, by the late 19th and early 20th century, some anthropologists and intellectuals in Latin America began to articulate theories concerning the "vigor" and resilience of their countries’ mixed or mestizo races as a productive counterpoint to the charges of racial inferiority leveled against them by those who believed in the natural superiority of the European or "Anglo-Saxon" races. Although these proponents of mestizaje subscribed to the same doctrines of racial determination that drove European racial theories, they did so in the interests of defending the "civilizational" achievements of their nations and region.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideology was influently worded by [[José Vasconcelos]] who in his [[La Raza Cósmica]] formulated a vision of how a "[[race of the future]]" would be created by mixing the mongoloid, negroid, and caucasian races. As the place where this mixing was already well underway, Mexico, and Latin America in general, was the center of the creation of this new and improved species of human beings, the [[mestizo]].

Today, there are more than 75 million people of African descent living in Brazil, which currently gives it the second largest black population in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Brazil. Directed by Ricardo Pollack. PBS, 2011. Accessed February 23, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite its large black population it was also the last country in the western hemisphere to [[Abolitionism|abolish]] slavery, in 1888. Brazil proudly refers to itself as a "[[Racial democracy|Racial Democracy]]," originally coined by Brazilian [[Sociology|sociologist]] [[Gilberto Freyre]] in his work ''[[Casa-Grande &amp; Senzala]]'' (The Masters and the Slaves), published in 1933. Additionally, racism has been made illegal under [[Anti-discrimination laws in Brazil#Penal_Code|Brazil's anti-discrimination laws]], which were passed in the 1950s after an African-American dancer was barred from a hotel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2016/12/18/506045513/since-established-in-1950-s-brazilians-say-anti-racism-laws-aren-t-enough Since Established In The 1950s, Brazilians Say Anti-Racism Laws Aren't Enough]&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, race has been the subject of multiple intense debates over the years within the country.

== History of Abolition ==

Calls for the end of slavery in Brazil began in the early 19th century. In 1825, [[José Bonifácio de Andrada|José Bonifácio Andrada e Silva]], who was a prominent figure in leading Brazil to independence from Portugal, was in high favor of gradual emancipation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://library.brown.edu/create/fivecenturiesofchange/chapters/chapter-3/slavery-and-aboliton/|title=Slavery and Abolition in the 19th Century {{!}} Brazil: Five Centuries of Change|website=library.brown.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Britain also contributed to the push for abolition in Brazil, by abolishing the slave trade. This was a significant move due to the fact that the British was Brazil's main trade partner. A small amount of legislation also helped lead up to the official abolition of slavery in 1888. First, in 1871 the [[Rio Branco Law|Law of the Free Womb]] declared that all the children of slaves that were born after the law was passed were to be freed; followed by the 1885 Sexagenarian Law, which freed slaves over sixty years of age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Lei Áurea (Golden Law).tif|thumb|The Golden Law. [[Brazilian National Archives|National Archives of Brazil.]]]]
A large contributor to the lengthy abolition process in Brazil was in part due to the dynamics of the royal family. By the 1870s, the last king, Pedro II had only one surviving child, the princess Isabel.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://library.brown.edu/create/fivecenturiesofchange/chapters/chapter-4/abolition/|title=Abolition {{!}} Brazil: Five Centuries of Change|website=library.brown.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to her gender and her marriage to a foreigner, Isabel had trouble gaining support, despite having twice served as regent during her father's reign. During her brief time as regent, she took small measures to abolish slavery. Due to the obstacles she faced, she had to appoint an entirely new cabinet in order to completely abolish slavery. She succeeded, and the abolition of slavery was refereed to as the [[Lei Áurea|Golden Law]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Existing Scholarship ==
{{Undue weight section|date=June 2018}}

There is a lot of wide ranging scholarship on the racism in Brazil post slavery, from books to documentaries. One book, ''From Slavery to Freedom in Brazil: Bahia, 1835–1900,'' was written by Professor Dale Torston Graden in 2006. Graden breaks up his book into four different sections, which trace the history of abolition in Bahia.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gormley|first=Melissa E.|date=2008-04-04|title=From Slavery to Freedom in Brazil: Bahia, 1835-1900 (review)|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/235748|journal=Journal of Colonialism and Colonial History|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|doi=10.1353/cch.2008.0016|issn=1532-5768}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics say that Graden's book helps to detail the complex natures of the abolition movement and the large role enslaved and free blacks played in the larger narrative in which Brazilian society was gradually defined. Additionally, it "pushes the reader to develop a more nuanced understanding of the intersection of race, ethnicity and emerging class hierarchy in the Brazilian context and provides a solid point of comparison for work in other parts of the Americas."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

== Conducted Research ==
A research article published in 2011 indicated that 63.7% of [[Brazilians]] believe that [[Race (classification of humans)|race]] interferes with the [[quality of life]].

At work: 59%&lt;br&gt;
In questions related to police justice: 68.3%&lt;br&gt;

Results conducted in 2008 supposedly show that people are not surprised about this difference{{mdash}}although a large percentage of the population is black or has black ancestry, they represented no more than 8% of the 513 chosen representatives in the last election year. The salary of Whites in [[Brazil]] are, on average, 46% over the salary of Blacks. This difference might be explained by differences in [[education]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://brazilchronicle.wordpress.com/2011/07/22/brazilians-think-race-intefere-on-quality-of-life-but-not-everyone-is-concerned-over-equality/ Brazilians Think Race {{sic|nolink=y|Intefere}} on Quality of Life, but not Everyone is Concerned About Equality {{en icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ivanir dos Santos (the former Justice Ministry's specialist on race affairs), "There is a hierarchy of skin color where blacks, mix races and dark skinned people are expected to know their place in society."&lt;ref&gt;[http://org.elon.edu/brazilmagazine/2005/article10.htm Racial Inequality in Brazil {{en icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

A study on racial bias in teacher evaluations in Brazil found that Brazilian math teachers gave better grading assessments of white students than equally proficient and equivalently well-behaved black students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = AEJ: Applied (7,4) p. 37 - Racial Discrimination in Grading: Evidence from Brazil|url = http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20140352|doi = 10.1257/app.20140352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Studies on Racialized Violence ==

Due to the ongoing questions surrounding race in Brazil, there have been various studies of violence in the country and whether race was a contributing or main factor in these crimes. One particular study looked at a series of [[homicide]]s that occurred in Brazil, spanning from 2000 to 2009. The statistics were obtained by the [[Mortality Medical Data System|Mortality Information System]]. The explanatory variables the [[Mortality Medical Data System|Mortality Information System]] looked at for potential causes of racialized killings were, [[race (classification of humans)|race]]/[[skin color]], [[gender]] and [[education]]. In the discussion section, the findings of the study suggested that anti-gun legislation in Brazil has yielded different outcomes among Brazil's population due to race or color. The risk of death by homicide in the white population declined during the period studied. In the black population, the risk of being victimized based on race increased regardless of gender, even after gun control measures took place over the studied period of time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0034-89102011000400015&amp;script=sci_arttext&amp;tlng=en Homicide victimization according to racial characteristics in Brazil {{en icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study determined that in 2008, 111.2% more blacks died proportionally than whites in Brazil. The disparity is especially pronounced among young adults between 15 and 24 years of age. Among whites, the number of murders fell from 6,592 to 4,582 between 2002 and 2008, a difference of 30%. Meanwhile, the murders of young black men rose from 11,308 to 12,749 —- an increase of 13%. In 2008, 127.6% more young black men died proportionately than whites. Ten years earlier, this difference was 39%. In the State of [[Paraíba]] in 2008, 1083% more blacks died than whites. In the State of [[Alagoas]], 974.8% more blacks died than whites. In 11 States, this ratio exceeds 200%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/impresso,1-branco-e-morto-no-pais-para-cada-2-negros,683821,0.htm For every death of a white person in Brazil, 2 black people die {{pt icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25840">The "'''rural purge'''" of American television networks (in particular [[CBS]]) was a series of cancellations in the [[1970s in television|early 1970s]] of still-popular rural-themed shows with demographically skewed audiences, the majority of which occurred at the end of the [[1970–71 United States network television schedule|1970–71 television season]].  In addition to rural-themed shows, the purge also eliminated several highly rated [[variety show]]s that had been on CBS since their beginning of television broadcasting. One of the earliest efforts at [[channel drift]], CBS in particular saw a dramatic change in direction with the shift, moving away from shows with rural themes and toward ones with supposedly more appeal to urban and suburban audiences.

== Background ==
Starting with ''[[The Real McCoys]]'', a 1957 ABC program, U.S. television had undergone a "rural revolution", a shift towards situation comedies featuring "naïve but noble '[[rube]]s' from deep in the [[Heartland (United States)|American heartland]]".&lt;ref name="musetv" /&gt; CBS was the network most associated with the trend, with series such as ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'', ''[[Green Acres]]'', ''[[Mister Ed]]'', ''[[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]]'', ''[[Petticoat Junction]]'', and ''[[Hee Haw]]''.&lt;ref name="musetv" /&gt; CBS aired so many of these rural-themed shows, many of which were produced by [[Filmways]], that it gained the nickname the "Country Broadcasting System".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ntca.org/new-edge/tag/country-broadcasting-system|title=Country Broadcasting System : NTCA's The New Edge|website=www.ntca.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another nickname was the "Hillbilly Network", a play on the network's original self-proclaimed&lt;!--really?  if so, needs a cite--&gt; nickname of "The Tiffany Network".{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

By 1966, industry executives were lamenting the lack of diversity in American television offerings and the dominance of rural-oriented programming on all of the [[Big Three television networks]] of the era, noting that "ratings indicate that the American public prefer hillbillies, cowboys, and spies" (spy shows being a lingering after-effect of the [[British Invasion]]).&lt;ref name="TLS"&gt;{{cite news|title=Fourth TV Network Looming on Horizon|author=William E. Sarmento|newspaper=[[Lowell Sun]]|page=20|date=July 24, 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CBS vice president [[Michael Dann]] personally disliked the dominance of rural-oriented programming; he nonetheless believed that the programs brought high total viewership and did not care about demographics. Dann's superior, CBS president [[James T. Aubrey]], likewise believed rural sitcoms were a crucial part of the network's formula for success, noting that at the time, advertisers ''wanted'' the audience that watched rural sitcoms.&lt;ref name=Oulahan&gt;Oulahan, Richard; and William Lambert. "The Tyrant's Fall That Rocked the TV World: Until He Was Suddenly Brought Low, Jim Aubrey Ruled the Air". ''[[Life Magazine]]''. September 10, 1965. 90+.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Wood (television executive)|Robert Wood]], a later president of CBS, pressured Dann to cancel the rural programs.  Dann was forced out shortly after he responded: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Just because the people who buy refrigerators are between 26 and 35 and live in [[Scarsdale, New York|Scarsdale]], you should not beam your programming only at them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/31/business/media/michael-dann-tv-programmer-who-scheduled-horowitz-and-hillbillies-dies-at-94.html|title=Michael Dann, TV Programmer, Dies at 94; Scheduled Horowitz and Hillbillies|date=31 May 2016|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Instigation ==
As summarized for the [[Museum of Broadcast Communications]]:&lt;ref name="musetv" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;By the late 1960s, ...many viewers, especially young ones, were rejecting [rural-themed] shows as irrelevant to modern times. [[Mayberry]]'s total isolation from contemporary problems was part of its appeal, but more than a decade of media coverage of the [[civil rights movement]] had brought about a change in the popular image of the small Southern town. ''[[Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.]]'', was set on a U.S. Marine base between 1964 and 1969, but neither Gomer nor any of his fellow marines ever mentioned the war in Vietnam. CBS executives, afraid of losing the [[Ratings (broadcast)|lucrative youth demographic]], purged their schedule of hit shows that were drawing huge but older-skewing audiences.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although the purge of rural programming began in 1970, it was foreshadowed a few years earlier. In 1967, CBS ordered a mass cancellation of the network's remaining [[panel game]] shows: ''[[What's My Line?]]'', ''[[I've Got a Secret]]'' and ''[[To Tell the Truth]]''. These programs were still extremely profitable (mainly because of their low budgets) but performed poorly in demographics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://docs.newsbank.com/s/HistArchive/ahnpdoc/EANX-NB/12F6D5BCF98EC1A8/8CE642B8CA5C4083BE84A2539D6E1A73 | title=Mature Programs Dying As TV Woos Young Folks | work=[[The Oregonian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network attempted to incorporate more urban programming, including the innovative sitcom ''[[He &amp; She]]'' in the 1967 season, but a clash with that show's lead-in (''Green Acres'') led to its cancellation; as a foreshadowing of things to come, ''He &amp; She'' would be rebroadcast  in reruns during the summer of 1970, just before the purge began. ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'', likewise an innovative and far more successful program that appealed to a younger audience, also debuted in 1967.{{citation needed|date = April 2017}}

The purge was instigated by CBS executive Robert Wood who replaced longtime CBS programming head [[Michael Dann]] with [[Fred Silverman]], following research highlighting the greater attraction to advertisers of the young adult urban viewer demographic.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book | title=Bewitched | author=Metz, W. | date=2007 | publisher=Wayne State University Press | isbn=978-0-8143-3580-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Mj6X1H4EpsC | accessdate=February 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of CBS's existing product either drew audiences that were too old and rural, or drew another undesirable demographic: young boys, who lacked disposable income of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | url=http://www.ew.com/article/2007/06/08/bob-barker-saying-goodbye-price-right | title=Bob Barker on saying goodbye to ''The Price Is Right'' | first=Lynette | last=Rice | date=June 8, 2007 | magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | accessdate=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their lack of relevance was referred to in [[Gil Scott-Heron]]'s 1970 spoken-word piece "[[The Revolution Will Not Be Televised]]", which alludes to at least seven of the shows that are eventually canceled as part of the purge, mentioning that as part of the titular revolution, the shows "will no longer be so damned relevant". Another factor in the purge was the loss of a half-hour of prime time programming each night as a result of the [[Prime Time Access Rule]], which took effect in 1971; as a result of the new rule, the networks (all of which had started prime time at 7:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time before the rule took effect) had to trim the equivalent of seven half-hour programs from their weekly schedules and give them back to the local stations.{{citation needed|date = April 2017}}

The numerous cancellations prompted [[Pat Buttram]] ("Mr. Haney" on one of the canceled shows, ''[[Green Acres]]'') to make the observation: "It was the year CBS canceled everything with a tree—including ''[[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]]''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Clark |first= Jim |title= Ken Berry Enjoys Taking Astaire Way to Mayberry and Beyond! |url= http://www.kenberry.com/ken_berry_interview.htm |date= March 26, 1999 |publisher= Official Website of [[Ken Berry]] |accessdate= May 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Hillbilly: A Cultural History of an American Icon |last= Harkins |first= Anthony |year= 2005 |publisher= Oxford University Press |isbn= 0-19-518950-7 |page= 203 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=dtehLu1cissC&amp;pg=PA203&amp;lpg=PA203&amp;dq=CBS+cancelled+everything+with+a+tree+in+it&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vQsGUrkj8W&amp;sig=tQT0fk2d2iDOYy-z4XpqAAk6FL8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2nLISZvgMKKomQeMsIT-Ag&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result |accessdate=March 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first rural-themed show canceled by Silverman was ''[[Petticoat Junction]]'' in 1970. In September 1970, ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' premiered on CBS. ''[[All in the Family]]'' premiered in January 1971 as a midseason replacement. Both series provided the urban demographic, cutting-edge social relevance, and ratings that CBS sought.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} These ratings successes prompted Silverman and the network to cancel ''[[Green Acres]]'', ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'', ''[[Mayberry R.F.D.]]'', ''[[Hee Haw]]'', and ''[[The Jim Nabors Hour]]'' at the end of the 1970–71 season, as well as cut short ''[[The New Andy Griffith Show]]'', a comeback vehicle for [[Andy Griffith]], after only ten episodes. (''The New Andy Griffith Show'' was a last-minute replacement for ''[[Headmaster (TV series)|Headmaster]]'', Griffith's unsuccessful effort to reach a more refined, urban audience; ''Headmaster'' was canceled after only 14 episodes.) Another series, ''[[The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour]]'', lasted until the end of the 1971–72 season.{{citation needed|date = April 2017}}

ABC also was looking for younger audiences, and in May 1971 canceled shows that skewed toward rural viewers (such as ''[[The Johnny Cash Show]]'', which had ranked 17th in the ratings prior to its cancellation) or older viewers (''[[The Danny Thomas Show|Make Room for Granddaddy]]'' and ''[[The Lawrence Welk Show]]''). NBC also targeted rural- and older-oriented programs in its cuts, eliminating long-running programs such as ''[[Wild Kingdom]]'', ''[[The Andy Williams Show]]'' and ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'', all of which ran nine seasons or more.{{citation needed|date = April 2017}}

== Popularity of cancelled shows ==
[[Broadcast syndication|Syndication]] proved to be a haven for many of the canceled programs. Welk's program—a mainstay of television since the summer of 1955—immediately moved to [[first-run syndication]], where it enjoyed an additional 11 years before Welk's retirement in 1982. Reruns of the show began almost immediately afterward, and continue to this day on PBS. ''Wild Kingdom'', ''Lassie'', and ''Hee Haw'' also continued in first-run syndication after their cancellations in 1971. ''Lassie'' ran until 1973, while ''Hee Haw'' had even greater success, lasting until 1991. (The timing of ''Hee Haw'' and ''Welk'' entering syndication was particularly opportune; along with the urban-oriented ''[[Soul Train]]'' that entered syndication the same year, these music-oriented niche programs became very popular throughout the 1970s and into the 1980s.) ''Wild Kingdom'' primarily aired [[rerun]]s, but continued to produce occasional new episodes in syndication through 1987. Both Andy Williams and Johnny Cash returned with short-lived revivals of their shows in 1976 and continued to produce annual specials into the 1980s.

''[[Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.]]'' was the first of the rural-based shows to leave the air. However, this was not due to its rural theme, but instead to [[Jim Nabors]]'s desire to move to something else – "reach for another rung on the ladder, either up or down". He was given a new show, ''[[The Jim Nabors Hour]]'', as a replacement for the next season.&lt;ref name=Gomer&gt;{{cite news |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EexOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qwEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=gomer%20pyle&amp;pg=2414%2C3314162 |title= Jim Nabors finished with Gomer |work= The Blade |location= Toledo, OH |date= January 31, 1969 |first= Cecil |last= Smith |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mayberry R.F.D.'', itself a direct continuation of ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'' (from which ''Gomer Pyle'' had spun off) finished number&amp;nbsp;4 for the year and was renewed for two more seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.classictvhits.com/tvratings/1968.htm |title= TV Ratings: 1968–69 |publisher=  ClassicTVHits.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of the cancellations was ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]'', which had finished the 1969–70 season as the number&amp;nbsp;7 show when it was axed by CBS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.classictvhits.com/tvratings/1969.htm |title= TV Ratings: 1969–70 |publisher= ClassicTVHits.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show's move back to NBC and its altered format drew away its viewership; thus it fell out of the top 30 by the end of the 1970–71 season. ''Petticoat Junction'' is another series often cited in the purge, but that show was already in decline (due in part to shifting tastes and to the death of star [[Bea Benaderet]] in 1968) by the time it was canceled in 1970. The success of ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'', ''All in the Family'', and newer, more urban variety shows such as  ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' in 1967 and ''[[The Flip Wilson Show]]'' in 1970, would allow for the mass cancellations of most of the now "undesired shows" at the end of 1971, despite their high ratings and popularity. Both ''Green Acres'' and ''The Beverly Hillbillies'' had dropped from the Nielsen top 30 by the 1970–71 season, yet both shows continued to win their respective time slots and had a loyal following, warranting renewal for another season. Other shows still pulling in even higher ratings when canceled included ''Mayberry R.F.D.'', which finished the season at number&amp;nbsp;15, ''Hee Haw'' at number&amp;nbsp;16, and ''The Jim Nabors Hour'' at number&amp;nbsp;29.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.classictvhits.com/tvratings/1970.htm |title= TV Ratings: 1970–71 |publisher= ClassicTVHits.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the course had been set by the networks and the shows were canceled to free up the schedules for newer shows.

The inclusion of demographics in determining a series' worth to its sponsors meant high ratings alone did not necessarily warrant a series for renewal. Series such as ABC's ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'' and ''[[The Partridge Family]]'' were never truly ratings hits; however, both series appealed to a younger demographic and thus were renewed for three more seasons and have been [[rerun]] on various outlets for decades since.

== Replacement shows ==
Silverman replaced much of the canceled programming in 1971 and 1972 with "relevant" fare. Following ''All in the Family'' were its many spinoffs including ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'' and ''[[The Jeffersons]]''. Following the success of ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'', the series' production company [[MTM Productions]] would develop the popular ''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]''. ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'' was added to the network in 1972, remaining constantly in the top 15 of shows for the next 11 seasons, and eventually aired the [[List of most watched television broadcasts|most watched single episode]] of any series in U.S. television history during its [[1983 in television|1983 series finale]].

An unusual side effect of the rural purge was the diminution of the [[laugh track]]. Most of the rural-oriented programs were filmed in the [[single-camera setup]] without a studio audience, with the canned laughter added by laugh-track proprietor [[Charley Douglass]]. The newer shows that came to television in the early 1970s were [[multiple-camera setup]]s with live studio audiences, a trend that would become the norm throughout the 1970s and 1980s, with Douglass's laugh track mostly limited to [[sweetening (show business)|sweetening]].

Under Silverman's watch, game shows returned to the network's daytime schedule during this period, as well (unlike NBC or ABC, CBS had not carried a daytime game show since ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'' ended its run in 1968, instead opting for reruns of 1960s prime-time sitcoms such as ''The Lucy Show'' and ''Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.'', both of which had left the air by that point). The first of these shows was ''[[The Amateur's Guide to Love]]'', which ran for three months in the Spring and Summer of 1972. Shortly afterward, on September 4, the network debuted three new game shows: ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The New Price Is Right]]'', ''[[Gambit (game show)|Gambit]]'', and ''[[The Joker's Wild]]''. All three shows had relatively long runs, with ''Joker'' ending its CBS run in 1975 (then returning in syndication in 1977), ''Gambit'' at the end of 1976, and ''Price'' still airing decades since.

Despite the relatively large number of "old guard" variety shows canceled in the purge, Silverman actually continued to create new variety shows to replace the ones he had canceled; one of the first was ''[[The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour|The Sonny &amp; Cher Show]]'', which debuted in February 1971 and would last until [[Sonny &amp; Cher|Sonny and Cher]] divorced in 1974 (Silverman then retained [[cher|Cher's]] services, signing her to her own show in 1976, after which she agreed to reunite professionally with Sonny for its last year on air, before it ended in 1977). Silverman would later commission ''[[Donny &amp; Marie (1976 TV series)|Donny &amp; Marie]]'' for ABC five years later. He would also, with little success, commission ''[[The Brady Bunch Hour]]'' for ABC in 1976 and ''[[Pink Lady (TV series)|Pink Lady and Jeff]]'' and ''[[Susan Anton|The Susan Anton Show]]'' for NBC in 1980, all three of which were received extremely poorly.

Several conservative members of Congress,{{who|date=September 2015}} as well as [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]] and members of his administration, expressed displeasure at some of the replacement shows, many of which (especially the more socially conscious shows such as ''All in the Family'') were not particularly "[[family-friendly]]". The backlash from the purge prompted CBS to commission a rural family drama, ''[[The Waltons]]'', for its Fall 1972 schedule based on the TV film ''The Homecoming: A Christmas Story'' (1971).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crump|first1=William D.|title=The Christmas encyclopedia|date=2013|isbn=9780786468270|page=434|edition=Third edition.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network scheduled it in what it thought would be a [[graveyard slot|death slot]] against popular series ''[[The Flip Wilson Show]]'' and ''[[The Mod Squad]]'', allegedly hoping the show would underperform and head to a quick cancellation. Instead, ''The Waltons'' went on to run for nine seasons, reaching as high as second in the Nielsens and finishing in the top 30 for seven of its nine years on air. The success of ''The Waltons'' started a trend for family dramas throughout the 1970s; such as ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'', ''[[Apple's Way]]'', ''[[Family (1976 TV series)|Family]]'', and ''[[Eight Is Enough]]''.

== Other cancellations ==
Non-rural-themed shows canceled by CBS included sitcoms ''[[Family Affair]]'' and ''[[Hogan's Heroes]]'' in 1971, with the long-running ''[[My Three Sons]]'' ending in 1972. Variety shows that had been around since the late 1940s and early 1950s, such as ''[[The Jackie Gleason Show]]'' and ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', were canceled in 1970 and 1971, respectively; likewise, ''[[The Original Amateur Hour]]'' (a stalwart of network television since its debut, and before that on radio since 1934) ended on its own accord in 1970 due to the show's aging demographics. ''The Red Skelton Show'' was canceled by CBS at the end of the 1969–70 season, and was picked up by NBC (the series' original network) for one more season. NBC would also revert Skelton's show to its original half-hour format in place of its more familiar hour-long format on CBS. By the end of 1972, [[Lucille Ball]] remained the only long-time star from [[Golden Age of Television|television's golden era]] to still have her own show. Ball's show, ''[[Here's Lucy]]'', still rated in the [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] top ten and would continue to pull in high ratings until its end in 1974. [[Westerns on television|TV westerns]] were another genre fading in popularity. Apart from ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' and ''[[Bonanza (TV series)|Bonanza]]'', two prime-time staples which in 1971 had been on the air for a combined 28 years (and would continue to air until 1975 and 1973, respectively), most of the shows in the genre were already off the air at the time of the purge. NBC canceled two of the remaining Westerns in 1971, ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'' and ''[[The High Chaparral]]''. Westerns had already been targeted by parents' groups opposing television violence and those concerned about the portrayal of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], though the main reason for their cancellation was that their viewership skewed older and rural. By 1969, no new Westerns were debuting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= TV Cowboys Bite Dust in Nets' Fall Line-Up |work= Chicago Tribune |date= March 13, 1969 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the original draft of CBS's 1971 Rural Purge, ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' was going to be canceled at the end of the 1970–71 season, while ''[[Mayberry R.F.D.]]'' and ''[[Family Affair]]'' would be renewed for the 1971–72 season. This plan was revised due to ''Gunsmoke's'' Top-10 Ratings, ranking #5 in the [[Nielsen Ratings]] for the 1970–71 season; in fact, the show's ratings rose to #4 in the next (1971–72) season.  Another factor that helped its renewal was that ''Gunsmoke'' was the favorite TV program of [[Barbara Cushing|Barbara Paley]], wife of CBS Chief Executive [[William S. Paley|William Paley]], even though Fred Silverman and Robert Wood both favored cancelling ''Gunsmoke'' over ''Mayberry R.F.D''. and ''Family Affair''.

[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] seriously considered picking up ''Family Affair'' following its cancellation by CBS, and adding the show to the 1971-72 ABC Prime-Time schedule, but eventually passed on this decision.  This was due to the fact that ABC had two similar shows with similar audiences (''[[The Brady Bunch]]'' and ''[[The Partridge Family]]''), and also the network came to the conclusion that ''Family Affair'' had run its course.

=== 1971–72 season ===
* ''[[The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour]]'' (CBS, 1969–1972)
* ''[[My Three Sons]]'' (ABC, 1960–65; CBS, 1965–72)
* ''[[Bewitched]]'' (ABC, 1964-72)

=== 1972–73 season ===
* ''[[Bonanza]]'' (NBC, 1959–1973)
* ''[[The Doris Day Show]]'' (CBS, 1968–1973 – though deviated from its rural/family theme after the 1970–71 season)
* ''[[Alias Smith and Jones]]'' (ABC, 1971-1973)

=== 1973–74 season ===
* ''[[Here's Lucy]]'' (CBS, 1968–74, following the related CBS series ''[[The Lucy Show]]'' (1962–1968), ''[[The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour]]'' (1957–1960), and ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' (1951–1957)
* ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]'' (NBC, 1965-1974)

=== 1974–75 season ===
* ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' (CBS, 1955–1975)

'''Sergey Nikolaevich Kurnakov''' or '''Sergei N. Kournakoff''' ([[Russian (language)|Russian]]: Сергей Курнаков) is a former tsarist cavalry officer who had immigrated to the U.S. and later became an ardent ideological Communist.  Kurnakov was born at Aladino in the Russian [[Caucasus]] in 1892 into a landed family of [[Circassians|Circassian]] descent. After serving as an imperial page under Tsar Nicholas II, he joined the Circassian cavalry regiment and served in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] and [[Romania]] during the [[First World War]] 1914-17, being wounded in the hand. He described his experiences in ''Savage Squadrons'' (1935). He subsequently emigrated to [[United States|America]] and became a journalist who wrote on military affairs for the [[Communist Party of the United States of America]] (CPUSA) paper, the ''[[Daily Worker]]'', and other publications.  Kurnakov served as a courier to various [[NKVD|Soviet intelligence]] sources, and acted as both a talent-spotter and a vetter of potential recruits.  Kurnakov was a highly active liaison agent. He was accused of Communism in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' in January 1944 after teaching at a Russian course at Cornell University in the summer of 1943. He was posthumously named as a communist agent in senate hearings in 1953.

His activities as an agent were revealed when the Venona decrypts were made public in 1995. He was the contact for [[Flora Wovschin]]'s father, [[Enos Wicher]].  Kurnakov also took over [[Mary Jane Keeney]] who worked for the [[Board of Economic Warfare]] and later the [[United Nations]] from Soviet Military Intelligence ([[GRU]]).  Her husband [[Philip Keeney]], who worked for what became the [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] also was taken over by Kurnakov and the KGB.

Kurnakov was the contact between [[Saville Sax]] and [[Theodore Hall]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}  Kurnakov reported Hall to have "an exceptionally keen mind and a broad outlook," and to be "politically developed."  At their first meeting, Hall gave Kurnakov a report he had prepared on the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] facility, the progress of the research, and the roles of the chief scientists working on the [[atomic bomb]].  Kurnakov immediately reported to [[KGB]] Officers [[Anatoly Yatskov]] and [[Stepan Apresyan]] on his meeting with Hall.

His son, Nick Kurnakov, served in Europe with the [[United States Army]] during [[World War II]] until he defected to the [[Red Army]] and was given an officer's rank. He joined [[Radio Moscow]] after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ruvr.ru/radio_broadcast/2248140/ |title=Voice of Russia is 80: Voice of Russia |publisher=: |date= |accessdate=2011-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''talking drum''' is an [[Hourglass drum|hourglass-shaped drum]] from [[West Africa]], whose pitch can be regulated to mimic the [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] and [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] of human speech. It has two [[drumhead]]s connected by leather tension cords, which allow the player to modulate the [[pitch (music)|pitch]] of the drum by squeezing the cords between their arm and body. A skilled player is able to play whole phrases. Most talking drums sound like a human humming depending on the way they are played. Similar hourglass-shaped drums are found in [[Asia]], but they are not used to mimic speech, although the [[idakka]] is used to mimic vocal music.

==History==
Hourglass-shaped talking drums are some of the oldest instruments used by West African  [[griot]]s&lt;ref name="Khass"/&gt; and their history can be traced back to the [[Yoruba people]], the [[Ghana Empire]]&lt;ref name=MakeDrums&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of the Drum – Early History|url=http://makedrums.com/the-history-of-the-drum-early-history|website=|publisher=MakeDrums.com|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Hausa people]]. The [[Yoruba people]] of south western [[Nigeria]] and [[Benin]] and the [[Dagomba people|Dagomba]] of northern [[Ghana]]) have developed a highly sophisticated genre of griot music centering on the talking drum .{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Many variants of the talking drums evolved, with most of them having the same construction mentioned above. Soon, many non-hourglass shapes showed up and were given special names, such as the Dunan, Sangban, Kenkeni, [[Fontomfrom]] and Ngoma drums.&lt;ref name=MakeDrums /&gt; This construction is limited to within the contemporary borders of [[West Africa]], with exceptions to this rule being northern [[Cameroon]] and western [[Chad]]; areas which have shared populations belonging to groups predominant in their bordering West African countries, such as the [[Kanuri people|Kanuri]], [[Zarma people|Djerma]], [[Fulani]] and Hausa.

In [[Senegal]]ese and [[Gambia]]n history, the '''tama''' ([[Serer language|Serer]]) was one of the music instruments used in the [[Serer people]]'s ''"Woong"'' tradition (the [[Ndut initiation rite|"dance performed by Serer boys yet to be circumcised]]" or the future circumcised, also known as the ''"Xaat"'' in the [[Serer language]]).&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 48–49"/&gt; The tama drum, has [[Serer religion|Serer religious]] connotations (which predates the [[Ghana Empire]]).&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 48–49"/&gt; In the ''Xaat'' tradition, the tama makes up the fourth musical drum ensemble. The Serer drums played include : Perngel, Lamb, Qiin and Tama.&lt;ref name="Pangool p 49"&gt;{{fr icon}} Gravrand, Henry, "La civilisation seereer – ''Pangool'', vol. 2 (1990), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|''When the rooster crows, the Xaat will rest and sleep until the moment of circumcision, if he has been judged to be able to dance to the Woong, surrounded by four tam-tam. The Perngel, the Lamb, the Qiin and the Tama.

===Ayangalu===
Ayangalu is believed to be the first Yoruba drummer. He is also believed to be the spirit or muse that inspires drummers. The word "''Ayan''" means drummer. This is why some Yoruba family names contain the prefix ''Ayan-'', such as Ayangbade, Ayantunde, Ayanwande etc. 
}}

From a historical perspective, the tama (just like the Serer [[junjung]]), was beaten by the [[griot]]s of [[Senegambia]]n kings on special occasions, such as during wars (a call for arms), when the kings wanted to address their subjects, and on special circumstances in Serer country – a call for martyrdom, such as the mayhem at [[Tahompa]] (a 19th-century surprise attack)&lt;ref name="Joof"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Camara"&gt;Camara, Alhaji Sait, "Chossani Senegambia" (history of Senegambia), in [[GRTS]] (Sunu Chossan), ([[Gambia]]).&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Battle of Naoudourou]],&lt;ref name="Joof"&gt;{{en icon}} [[Alhaji Alieu Ebrima Cham Joof|Joof, Alhaji Alieu Ebrima Cham]], "Senegambia, the land of our heritage" (1995).

== How they "talk" ==
The pitch of the drum is varied to mimic the tone patterns of speech.  This is done by varying the tension placed on the drumhead: the opposing drum heads are connected by a common [[Rope-tension|tension cord]].  The waist of the drum is held between the player's arm and ribs, so that when squeezed the drumhead is tightened, producing a higher note than when it's in its relaxed state; the pitch can be changed during a single beat, producing a warbling note.  The drum can thus capture the pitch, volume, and rhythm of human speech, though not the qualities of vowels or consonants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gertjegerdes-Myricks|first=Petra|title=African American History Village Receives New African Drums|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/367868191|accessdate=2 May 2013|newspaper=Columbus Times|date=17 July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of talking drums as a form of communication was noticed by Europeans in the first half of the eighteenth century. Detailed messages could be sent from one village to the next faster than could be carried by a person riding a horse. In the nineteenth century Roger T. Clarke, a missionary, realised that "the signals represent the tones of the syllables of conventional phrases of a traditional and highly poetic character."&lt;ref&gt;[[James Gleick|Gleick, J.]] (2011), ''[[The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood]]'', London: Fourth Estate, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[Chinese language|Chinese]], many African languages are [[tone (linguistics)|tonal]]; that is, the pitch is important in determining the meaning of a particular word.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, Matthew Y. 2000. ''Tone Sandhi: patterns across Chinese dialects.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odden, David (1995), "Tone: African languages". In J. Goldsmith (ed.), ''Handbook of Phonological Theory'', Oxford: [[Basil Blackwell]].&lt;/ref&gt; The Yoruba language of the Yoruba people for instance is mostly defined by the tri-tonic scale, consisting only of the tonic sol-fa notes, do, re, mi, different inflections of which are then used to convey different messages, this same principle also applies to how the drum talks in all of the Yoruba peoples music and culture. The problem was how to communicate complex messages without the use of vowels or consonants, simply using tone. An English emigrant to Africa, [[John F. Carrington]], in his 1949 book ''The Talking Drums of Africa'' explained how African drummers were able to communicate complex messages over vast distances.&lt;ref&gt;Carrington, J. F. (1949), ''The Talking Drums of Africa'', Carey Kingsgate Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Using low tones referred to as male and higher female tones, the drummer communicates through the phrases and pauses, which can travel upwards of 4–5 miles. This process may take eight times longer than communicating a normal sentence but was effective for telling neighboring villages of possible attacks or ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ong|first=Walter|title=Interfaces of the Word: Studies in the Evolution of Consciousness and Culture|year=1977|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; He found that to each short word which was beaten on the drums was added an extra phrase, which would be redundant in speech but provided context to the core drum signal.

=== Example ===
The message "Come back home" might be translated by the drummers as: "Make your feet come back the way they went, make your legs come back the way they went, plant your feet and your legs below, in the village which belongs to us".&lt;ref&gt;Gleick (2011), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Single words would be translated into phrases. For example, "moon" would be played as "the Moon looks towards earth", and "war" as "war which causes attention to ambushes".

The extra phrases provide a context in which to make sense of the basic message or drum beats. These phrases could not be randomized, when learning to play the drum students were taught the particular phrase that coincided with each word. This reason alone made learning to talk in drum language very difficult and not many were willing to take the time to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ong|first=|title=Interfaces of the Word|year=1977|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extra drum beats reduce the ambiguity of the meaning. The irony was that by the time the West understood the mechanism of the drums they began to diminish in use in Africa. It was also not uncommon for words to lose their meaning. In an interview with Carrington he explained that when words aren't used often the phrases that correspond to them are forgotten. When given the beat for young girl the drummers thought the phrase played was in fact the one for fishing nets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ong|first=|title=Interfaces of the Word|date=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As emphasized by Finnegan,&lt;ref name=OLA&gt;{{cite book|last=Finnegan|first=Ruth|title=Oral Literature in Africa|year=2012|publisher=Open Book Publishers|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=978-1-906924-72-0|url=https://unglue.it/work/81834/|chapter=Drum Language and Literature}}&lt;/ref&gt; the messages sent via drums were not confined to utilitarian messages with a marginally literary flavour. Drum languages could also be used for specifically literary forms, for proverbs, panegyrics, historical poems, dirges, and in some cultures practically any kind of poetry. The ritualized forms and drum names constituted a type of oral literature. Among some peoples such as the [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] or the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]], drum language and literature were very highly developed. In these cultures, drumming tended to be a specialized and often hereditary activity, and expert drummers with a mastery of the accepted vocabulary of drum language and literature were often attached to a king’s court.

==Talking drum variance==

===Dimensions===
Various sizes of hourglass talking drum exist, with the dimensions of the drum differing between ethnic groups, but all following the same template.

The ''Tama'' of the Serer, Wolof and Mandinka peoples is typified by its smaller dimensions, having a total drum length typical of 13 centimeters (5 inches) with a 7 centimeter (2.75&amp;nbsp;inch) drum head [[diameter]]. This produces a much higher pitched tone than other talking drums of the same construction.

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Lunna.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A Ghanaian ''Odondo'' drum. Pen used for size comparison.]] --&gt;
The Yoruba and Dagomba peoples on the other hand have some of the largest dimensions for drums in their ''Lunna'' and ''Dùndún'' ensembles, with a length typical of 23–38 centimeters (9–15&amp;nbsp;inches) and a drum head diameter of between 10–18 centimeters (4–7&amp;nbsp;inches). In Yoruba talking-drum ensembles, this is used alongside smaller talking drums similar to the ''Tama'', called ''Gangan'' in [[Yoruba language]].

[[Image:tama front.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Senegalese Tama player, Yamar Thiam of the Finnish group Galaxy, performing at the Imatra Big band Festival at Imatra, July 2005]]

===Playing styles===
[[File:WIKI LOVES AFRICA 2016 HYPERFOCALSTUDIOS.jpg|thumb|WIKI LOVES AFRICA 2016 HYPERFOCALSTUDIOS| Drummers on parade]]
Playing styles are closely linked with the drum's construction and the tonal qualities of each language. There is a clear difference in playing styles between areas with predominantly [[Fulani]] and [[Mande languages|Mande]]-speaking populations and traditionally non-Mande areas further east.

The predominant style of playing in areas further west such as [[Senegal]], [[Gambia]], western [[Mali]] and [[Guinea]] is characterized by rapid rolls and short bursts of sound between the stick holding hand and accompanying free hand, and correlates with the various [[pitch accent]] and non-tonal languages heard in this area. This is a style typically heard in the popular [[Mbalax]] genre of Senegal.

From eastern [[Mali]], [[Burkina Faso]] and [[Ghana]], towards [[Niger]], western-[[Chad]] and [[Nigeria]], (with the exceptions of areas with [[Fulani]] and [[Mande languages|Mande]]-speaking majorities) the playing style of the talking drum is centered on producing long and sustained notes by hitting the drum head with the stick-holding hand and the accompanying free hand used to dampen and change tones immediately after being hit. This produces a rubbery sounding texture to its playing, which mimics the heavy and complex tones used in languages from this area (see [[Niger–Congo languages#Tone|Niger–Congo tonal language chart]]). This characteristic style can be clearly heard in the popular music of this area, particularly in those where the talking drum is the lead instrument, such as [[Fuji music]] of the Yoruba of [[Nigeria]].

==Use in popular music==
In the 20th century the talking drum became a part of popular [[music of Africa|music in West Africa]]. It is used in playing [[Mbalax]] music of Senegal and in [[Fuji music|Fuji]] and [[Jùjú music]] of [[Nigeria]] (where it is known as a [[dùndún]], not to be confused with the [[dunun|dundun]] bass drum of the [[Mandé]] peoples.)

[[King Crimson]] used the talking drum on its album ''[[Larks' Tongues in Aspic]]'', for the track "The Talking Drum".  {{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

[[Tom Waits]] used the talking drum on his song "Trouble's Braids," a track from the album ''[[Swordfishtrombones]]''.

[[Erykah Badu]] used the talking drum on her song "My People", from the album ''[[New Amerykah Part One (4th World War)]]''.

[[Sikiru Adepoju]] is a master of the talking drum from Nigeria who has collaborated with artists from the [[Grateful Dead]] to [[Stevie Wonder]] and [[Carlos Santana]].

[[Naná Vasconcelos]], master of percussion, started playing the talking drum in the early 1980s and has used it ever since.

[[Mick Fleetwood]] of [[Fleetwood Mac]] has used the talking drum on the track "World Turning" on the band's 1975 [[Fleetwood Mac (1975 album)|eponymous]] album and in concert performances of the song.

==In popular culture==
[[File:Bill-Kreutzmann-and Djembe.gif|thumb|220px|[[Bill Kreutzmann]], a drummer with the [[Grateful Dead]] with a talking drum, 1982. Photo by: [[David Gans (musician)|David Gans]]]]

In the game series [[Patapon]] the player is a god who communicates with his or her followers using four Talking Drums. Each has its own unique sound: 'Pata,' 'Pon,' 'Don' and 'Chaka.'

In the television series [[Dead Like Me]], the talking drum is discussed as a means of celebrating the lives of the dead.

They can also be heard in the 1959 movie ''[[The Nun's Story (film)|The Nun's Story]]'', starring [[Audrey Hepburn]], when she arrives in what was at that time the Belgian Congo.

[[Bill Kreutzmann]], a drummer for the [[Grateful Dead]], occasionally played a talking drum at the band's live shows during the "drums" segment of their shows in the second set.

The talking drum features prominently in the [[Black Panther (soundtrack)#Black Panther (Original Score)|score]] of the 2018 film ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]''. The score, composed by [[Ludwig Göransson]], uses talking drums at the core of a [[leitmotif]] associated with the film's protagonist, T'Challa (played by [[Chadwick Boseman]]).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XtCnGT0B20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drum names==
In some ethnic groups, each individual was given a ''drum name''. Examples from among the [[Beti-Pahuin|Bulu]] of [[Cameroon]] are "Even if you dress up finely, love is the only thing" or "The giant wood rat has no child, the house rat has no child". Talking drum players sent messages by drumming the recipient's name, followed by the sender's name and the message.&lt;ref&gt;"Drum Telegraphy".&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5876">'''Tallensi''', also spelled '''Talensi''',  are a people of northern [[Ghana]] who speak a language of the [[Gur languages|Gur branch]] of the [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger-Congo language family]]. They grow millet and sorghum as staples and raise cattle, sheep, and goats on a small scale. Their normal domestic unit is the polygamous joint family of a man and his sons (and sometimes grandsons) with their wives and unmarried daughters. Married daughters live with their husbands in other communities, commonly nearby.

==Rituals and traditions==
===Surrounding the first-born son===
The Tallensi are [[polygamy|polygamous]] and follow a [[patrilineality|patrilineal]] system of [[kinship and descent]]. Great emphasis is placed on inheritance and the tensions surrounding parents' relationships with their children. It is considered essential for a man to have a son if he is to achieve fulfillment and be venerated as an ancestor after his death. However, the birth of a first-born son, and to a lesser extent a first-born daughter, is held to mark the culmination of a man's 'rise' in the world, and the start of his decline. Meanwhile, the son grows to replace and supplant the father. The resulting ambivalence between father and son, which is reminiscent of the effects of the [[Oedipus complex]] as articulated by [[Sigmund Freud]], plays an important role in Tallensi [[ritual]]s and [[taboo]]s.

Taboos begin when the first-born son reaches the age of five or six. From this time on the son may not eat from the same dish as his father, wear his father's cap or tunic, carry his father's [[quiver]], use his father's [[bow (weapon)|bow]], or look into his father's [[granary]]. When the son reaches [[adolescence]], he may not meet his father in the entrance to the house compound. Similar taboos exist to regulate the relationship between mother and first-born daughter. The daughter, for example, may not look into her mother's storage pot.

Upon the death of a father, his first-born son and daughter lead the rituals involved in his [[funeral]]. The son, at this point, puts on his father's cap and tunic. A tribal elder, carrying the dead man's bow, ritually guides the son to his father's granary and shows him the inside. After his father's death the son is considered a mature man for the purposes of ritual, and it is his responsibility to make sacrifices to the ancestors, chief among them being his own father, who being recently dead is held to act as an intermediary between those still living and the more remote ancestors.

It is believed that these taboos and rituals serve to channel ambivalence and resentment between generations into culturally defined and culturally acceptable means of expression.

===Sacred Crocodile===
Among the Tallensi tribe there is a belief in the sacred crocodile. As Meyer Fortes highlighted in his ethnographic work "The concept of the person", special crocodiles in special pools are considered persons among the Tallensi. No local man, indeed no Tallensi would dare kill or injure a sacred crocodile. Every Tallensi knows that these crocodiles are the incarnation of important clan ancestors. To kill one of these is like killing a person. It is murder of the most heinous kind and it would bring disaster on the whole clan.

However, not all crocodiles are considered persons (''ni-saal'') for instance, in the rivers that are fished in the dry season - is not a person, not sacred. It can be killed and eaten.

== Demographics ==
The Tekna tribes speak [[Hassaniya]] [[Arabic Language|Arabic]] and the [[Berber languages|Berber]] [[Shilha language|Shilha]] dialect in varying degrees.&lt;ref&gt;Claire Cécile Mitatre, [http://anneemaghreb.revues.org/1219 « Le couloir ouest-saharien : un espace gradué »], L’Année du Maghreb, VII (2011), p.211-228&lt;/ref&gt;

All Tekna are [[Muslim]]s, belonging to the [[Maliki]] school of [[Sunni]] [[Islam]]. Their traditional lifestyle was partly [[nomad]]ic, based on [[camel]] and [[goat]] herding, and partly sedentary, controlling important routes of the [[Sahrawi people|Saharan]] [[Caravan (travellers)|caravan]] [[trade]].

The Tekna are divided into several Berber-speaking and Arabic-speaking tribes, which are organized into two tribal confederations or ''leff'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.telquel-online.com/archives/161/images/shema.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530020911/http://www.telquel-online.com/archives/161/images/shema.pdf |archivedate=2014-05-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Aït Djemel confederacy (Western Tekna), consisting of the tribes of Aït Lahcen, Izerguiyen, Yaggout, and Aït Moussa Ou Ali ;
* Aït Atman (or Aït Bella) confederacy (Eastern Tekna), consisting of the tribes of Azouafit, Aït Yassine, Aït Oussa, Aït Brahim, and Aït Hmad.

== History ==
During the 17th century, [[Morocco]] under Sultan [[Ismail Ibn Sharif]] seized control over the territory from the [[Moulouya River]] south to [[Senegal]] and [[Timbuktu]]. Contingents of Tekna troops were then sent to the [[Senegal River|Senegal valley]] on behalf of the Sultan.&lt;ref&gt;Attilo Gaudio (1993), ''Les populations du Sahara occidental: histoire, vie et culture'', p.106&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1765 the Tekna revolted, acquiring greater autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Attilo Gaudio (1993), ''Les populations du Sahara occidental: histoire, vie et culture'', p.107&lt;/ref&gt; On May 30, 1767, [[Mohammed ben Abdallah]], [[Sultan of Morocco]], signed a peace and commerce treaty with King [[Charles III of Spain]], recognizing that Morocco did not control the Tekna tribes.&lt;ref name = "Junta Andalucia"&gt;{{cite web | title = Proyecto Ibn Jaldun.

'''Tinker''' or '''tinkerer''' is an archaic term for an itinerant [[tinsmith]] who mends household utensils.

==Description==
The word is attested from the 13th century as "tyckner" or "tinkler" a term used in medieval Scotland and England for a metal worker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/scottishgypsiesu00macr/scottishgypsiesu00macr_djvu.txt|title=Full text of 'Scottish Gypsies under the Stewarts'|website=''archive.org''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some travelling groups and [[Romani people]] adopted this lifestyle and the name was particularly associated with indigenous [[Scottish Gypsy and Traveller groups|Scottish Highland Traveller]]s and [[Irish Travellers]]. However, this usage is disputed and considered offensive by some.&lt;ref name="ced"&gt;{{cite web |title=tinker|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/tinker |work=Collins English Dictionary |edition=Complete &amp; Unabridged 11th |access-date=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tinkering is therefore the process of adapting, meddling or adjusting something in the course of making repairs or improvements,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hedy Lamarr: Hollywood's secret weapon inventor|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/46848978/ns/technology_and_science-innovation/t/hedy-lamarr-hollywoods-secret-weapon-inventor/|work=NBC|date=25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brandon|first1=John|title=James Dyson on How Invent Insanely Popular Products|url=https://www.inc.com/john-brandon/james-dyson-on-how-entrepreneurs-need-to-innovate-not-just-invent.html|work=''Inc.com''|date=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a process also known as [[bricolage]].

The term "tinker", in British English, may refer to a mischievous child.&lt;ref name="ced"/&gt; Some modern-day nomads with a Scottish, Irish or English influence call themselves "techno-tinkers" or "[[technogypsie]]s" and are found to possess a revival of sorts of the romantic view of the tinker's lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;"Techno-Gypsies, Techno-Nomads, and Techno-Tinkers" 2005 by Leaf McGowan/Thomas Baurley. Seattle, Washington. Tree Leaves Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; The family name "Tinker" is of Anglo-Saxon origin and does not have a Scottish, Irish, or Romany connection.
&lt;!--
These paragraphs seem to related to a particular family name, not directly related to the occupation "tinker"

Tinker as a surname is a very old Anglo-Saxon name, with variations of Le Tinklere and Tinkler, appearing when surnames were adopted, many from occupations. Having no Scottish, Irish, or Romany connections, it is found mainly in Yorkshire and Norfolk. A Tinker was listed among the [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]] who sailed on the ''[[Mayflower]]'' in 1620 to the [[New World]], but he died within a few months.

The Tinker name did not occur in Ireland until the late 17th century, after the [[English Civil War]], when former members of [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s [[New Model Army]] settled there after service. The [[Romani people|Gypsy]] connotation arose later from tinkers who travelled the British Isles to ply their trade. Tinkers were originally not [[Romanies]] nor [[Romani people|Gypsies]], although some Romany adopted the tinker's trade.

Tinker descendants are recorded as living in the parish of Letheringsett near Holt in North Norfolk. After moving to Kensington in London, others now live mainly in the South of the UK.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Tinker's dam==
A tinker's dam is a temporary patch to repair a hole in a metal vessel such as a pot or a pan. It was used by tinkers and was usually made of mud or clay, or sometimes other materials at hand, such as wet paper. The material was built up around the outside of the hole, so as to plug it. Molten [[solder]] was then poured on the inside of the hole. The solder cooled and solidified against the dam and bonded with the metal wall. The dam was then brushed away. The remaining solder was then [[rasp]]ed and smoothed down by the tinker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.usingenglish.com/reference/idioms/not+worth+a+tinker's+dam.html | title=A Tinker's dam | publisher=usingenglish.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1rZCAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22dough+or+of+soft+clay+raised+around+a+spot+which+a+plumber%22&amp;dq=%22dough+or+of+soft+clay+raised+around+a+spot+which+a+plumber%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7n9WT-rtBIbrObHshc4I&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA |title= Tinkers |author=John Bonner, George William Curtis |year=1905 |publisher=Harper's weekly |volume=49|pages=1424|accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Practical Dictionary of Mechanics'' of 1877, Edward Knight gives this definition: "Tinker's-dam: a wall of dough raised around a place which a plumber desires to flood with a coat of solder. The material can be but once used; being consequently thrown away as worthless".&lt;ref name="The Phrase Finder: Tinker's Dam"&gt;{{cite web|last=Martin|first=Gary|title=Tinker's Dam|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/tinkers-damn.html|publisher=The Phrase Finder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tinker's curse==
The common use of "tinker's dam" may have influenced the English [[phrase]] tinker's '''curse''', which expresses contempt. The phrases '''[[wikt:tinker's damn|tinker's damn]]''' and '''tinker's curse''' may also be applied to something considered insignificant. A common expression may be the examples: "I don't give a tinker's curse what the Vicar thinks", sometimes shortened to, "I don't give a tinker's about the Vicar." In this context, the speaker is expressing contempt for the clergyman and his opinion. A tinker's curse or cuss was considered of little significance because tinkers (who worked with their hands near hot metal) were reputed to swear (curse) habitually.&lt;ref name="The Phrase Finder: Tinker's Dam" /&gt;

[[Image:Afghancarpet1.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Teke tribe|Teke]] design Turkmen carpet. This pattern is often referred to as the "Bukhara" print design.]]
A '''Turkmen rug''' ({{lang-tk|Türkmen haly}}; or '''Turkmen carpet''' or '''Turkoman carpet''') is a type of handmade floor-covering textile traditionally originating in [[Central Asia]]. It is useful to distinguish between the original Turkmen tribal rugs and the rugs produced in large numbers for export mainly in [[Pakistan]] and [[Iran]] today. The original Turkmen rugs were produced by the [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] tribes who are the main ethnic group in [[Turkmenistan]] and are also found in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iran]]. They are used for various purposes, including tent rugs, door hangings and bags of various sizes.

== History ==
[[File:Gorskii 20005u.jpg|thumbnail|left|Two Turkmen men standing on a carpet in front of a [[yurt]]. (1905-1915)]]
[[File:Five Tree Yomut Asmalyk, Turkmenistan, 18-19th century, 75 x 124 cm.jpg|thumbnail|Five Tree Yomut [[Asmalyk]], Turkmenistan, 18-19th century.]]
[[File:Tolkuchka Bazaar4.jpg|thumbnail|Carpets in [[Altyn Asyr Bazaar]]]]
A few centuries back, almost all Turkmen rugs were produced by nomadic tribes almost entirely with locally obtained materials, wool from the herds and vegetable dyes, or other [[natural dye]]s from the land. They used geometrical designs that varied from tribe to tribe; most famous are the [[Yomut carpet|Yomut]], [[Ersari]], [[Saryk]], [[Salor]], and [[Teke tribe|Tekke]]. Irregularities &amp;mdash; considered part of the charm by many rug collectors &amp;mdash; were fairly common since natural materials varied from batch to batch and woolen warp or weft may stretch, especially on a loom that is regularly folded up for transport and set up a new at another camp.

More recently, large rug workshops in the cities have appeared, there are fewer irregularities, and the technology has changed some. Since about 1910, synthetic dyes have been used along with natural ones.&lt;ref&gt;''Between the Black Desert and the Red: Turkmen Carpets from the Wiedersperg Collection'', San Francisco, Fine Arts Museum, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The size of nomadic rugs is limited to what can be done on a nomad's portable loom; larger rugs have always been produced in the villages, but they are now more common. Using cotton for warp and weft threads has also become common.

The rugs produced in large numbers for export in [[Pakistan]] and [[Iran]] and sold under the name of Turkmen rugs are mostly made of synthetic colors, with cotton warps and wefts and wool pile. They have little in common with the original Turkmen tribal rugs. In these export rugs, various patterns and colors are used, but the most typical is that of the [[Bukhara]] design, which derives from the Tekke main carpet, often with a red or tan background (picture). Another favorite is derived from the Ersari main carpet, with the [[octagon]]al ''elephant's foot'' design. The [[Turkmen Carpet Museum]], which preserves examples of the original Turkmen tribal rugs, is located in [[Ashgabat]].

Many [[Afghan rug]]s bear a strong resemblance to Turkmen rugs. [[Afghanistan]] produces a lot of relatively cheap and coarse rugs, mainly for export, and many of those are in a "Bokhara" design. However, there are also some very fine Afghans including many using Turkmen designs.

[[File:The largest carpet in the world.JPG|thumb|The largest carpet in the world]]
At the end of the 20th century, carpet weaving in Turkmenistan had become one of the most important sectors of the economy. In 1992, Turkmen Carpet Day officially became a public national holiday, celebrated annually on the last Sunday in May.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turkmenistan.ru/?page_id=3&amp;lang_id=en&amp;elem_id=8165&amp;type=event&amp;sort=date_desc Turkmen carpet day marked as national holiday]&lt;/ref&gt; Among the modern Turkmen carpets stands the world's largest handmade carpet total area of 301 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which was woven in 2001, and in 2003 entered in the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2011/11/largest-architectural-star-record-set-in-turkmenistan/ LARGEST ARCHITECTURAL STAR RECORD SET IN TURKMENISTAN]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.trend.az/news/politics/1532003.html Turkmen biggest carpet included in Guinness World Records]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heraldry ===
The vertical strip of the [[Flag of Turkmenistan]] placed five main patterns of Turkmen carpets. These figures are arranged. Secondary figures are disposed along the edges. Patterns reflect national unity of Turkmenistan. The five traditional carpet motifs in [[Emblem of Turkmenistan]] on the red disc represent the five major [[tribe]]s or houses, and stand for the [[tradition]]al and religious values of the country. These Turkmen tribes in traditional order are [[Teke tribe|Teke]], [[Yomut carpet|Yomut]], [[Arsary]], [[Chowdur]] and [[Saryk]] ([[Saryq]]).

=== Ministry of Carpets ===

State Association [[Turkmenhaly]] is a major supplier to the world market of pure wool pile hand-made Turkmen carpets from Turkmenistan. The principal activities of the corporation are the production and sale of Turkmen carpets and rugs, preserving the traditions of carpet weaving hand, the restoration of old carpet ornaments and articles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turkmenistan.ru/en/node/5541 French Bouygues to build office building for Turkmenhaly state corporation and Museum of Turkmen carpet in Ashgabat]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Turkmen Carpet Museum ===
The Turkmenistan Presidential Decree of 20 March 1993 in Ashgabat created the [[Turkmen Carpet Museum]]. The Carpet Museum is one of the cultural centers of Turkmenistan, which has about 2,000 carpet exhibits, including rare ones, on display. For example, the museum has the smallest carpet product, designed to be worn with keys. The museum conducts restoration of antique carpets as well. It's a challenging process - some artfully woven old specimens contain up to 1,350,000 knots. The museum is constantly updated, and its employees conduct searches and compiles collections of old carpets. The new building of the National Museum of Turkmen Carpets has an overall space of 5089 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The museum also hosts international scientific forums and conferences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turkmenistan.ru/en/articles/17224.html Day of Turkmen Carpet celebrated in Turkmenistan]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Major towns producing rugs ===
[[Bereket]] has a Turkmen carpet [[weaving]] factory, in usage since 1923.

Veluws is spoken in the Central [[Netherlands]], in the Northwest of [[Gelderland]].

===Official status===
The language was recognized by the government of the [[Netherlands]] in 1996 (as being part of Low Saxonian).&lt;ref name=e16&gt;https://www.ethnologue.com/16/show_language/vel/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dialects==
[[File:Frans Nieuwenhuis 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Frans Nieuwenhuis]] (born 1936) sings in Veluws dialect.]]
Veluws is usually divided into two [[dialect|main dialects]], [[West-Veluws]] (West Veluws) and [[Oost-Veluws dialect|Oost-Veluws]] (East Veluws), these two dialects are reasonably similar but differ in [[grammar]]. For example: in Oost-Veluws they say ''ie warkt/wärkt'' (you are working) and in West-Veluws ''jie warken/waarken'' (you are working).

===Lexical similarities===

West-Veluws is also more influenced by [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. The closer one gets to the border with Oost-Veluws, the result usually results in more the dialects differed from Standard Dutch. For example, in the central part where West-Veluws is spoken they say ''hie staot'', in the North Western part they say ''hij steet'' compared to ''hij/hee stiet'' 'he is standing' in Oost-Veluws, this already has a more Low Saxon influence. [[Hattem]], the North Eastern part where &amp; when Oost-Veluws is spoken, it seems to "have" or in the direct mentioned, 'has a'   
 [[Sallands|Sallandic]] influence.

==Classification==
It is not well defined what constitutes a [[language]] versus a [[dialect]], but Veluws is generally considered to be a dialect of [[Low German|Low Saxon]], classified [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], [[Germanic languages|Germanic]], West, Low Saxon-[[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian]], [[Dutch Low Saxon|Low Saxon]].&lt;ref name=e16/&gt;

{{Women in society sidebar}}
The role of '''women in the Philippines''' ({{lang-fil|Kababaihan sa Pilipinas}}) is explained based on the context of [[Culture of the Philippines|Filipino culture]], standards, and mindsets. The Philippines is described to be a nation of strong women, who directly and indirectly run the family unit, businesses, government agencies and haciendas.

Although they generally define themselves in the milieu of a male-dominated post-colonial society, [[Filipino people|Filipino]] women live in a culture that is focused on the community, with the family as the main unit of society, but not always as this is a stereotype.  It is in this framework of [[Philippine]] hierarchical structure, class differences, religious justifications, and living in a globally developing nation wherein Filipino women are respected well by men. Compared to other parts of [[Southeast Asia]], women in Philippine society have always enjoyed a greater share of equality.&lt;ref name=Ozamiz&gt;Clamonte, Nitz.

As a consequence, during hundreds of years, education was given only to upper class girls, who were trained to become beautiful, submissive, capable to stitch embroidery, and suitable to marriage. The nun institution offered the only possibility for a career and teaching was the only educated occupation allowed to them..."&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|List of Pre-colonial Filipino consorts}}
[[File:Cagayan Woman.png|left|thumb|254x254px|A cagayan woman. [[Boxer Codex]]]]
Some pre-colonial social structures of the Philippines gave equal importance to maternal and paternal [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineage]]. This [[Bilateral symmetry|bilateral]] [[kinship]] system accorded Philippine women enormous power within a [[clan]].  They were entitled to property, engage in a trade and could exercise their right to divorce her husband.  They could also become village [[Tribal chief|chiefs]] in the absence of a male heir.  Before the arrival of the Spaniards, Filipino women could also achieve status as [[babaylan|medicine women or high-priestesses]] and [[astrologer]]s.&lt;ref name=Vartti/&gt;&lt;ref name=Karnow&gt;[[Stanley Karnow|Karnow, Stanley]].

====History====
In the precolonial era of the Phlippines there are numerous women are entitled as a ''Hara'' and  ''Dayang'' , the female presence in the Noble caste are prominent in the kinship system in the [[Culture of the Philippines|Philippine societies]], here are the examples of notable Queens in the Philippine history: 
*[[Laguna Copperplate Inscription|Dayang Buka]] (C.900 CE) Known in [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription|LCI]]. She was married to [[Senapati]] [[Jayadewa]] who was the [[Rajah]] of [[Kingdom of Tondo|Tondo]] as a bargain to clear the debt of 1 ''kati'' and 8 ''suwarnas'' of her parents Namwaran and [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription|Dayang Angkatan]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bagongkasaysayan.org/ebook/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/3.Ang-Tundo_Kimuell-Gabriel_Marked.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Urduja|Hara Udaya]] or Queen Urduja is a legendary warrior princess who is recognized as a heroine in [[Caboloan|Pangasinan]]. The name Urduja appears to be [[Sanskrit]] in origin, and a variation of the name "Udaya", meaning "arise" or "rising sun", or the name "Urja", meaning "breath". A historical reference to Urduja can be found in the travel account of [[Ibn Battuta]] (1304 – possibly 1368 or 1377 AD), a Muslim traveler from [[Morocco]]. Ibn Battuta sailed for 17 days to reach China from the land of Tawalisi.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Battuta, p. 888.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Dayang Sima (c. 637 CE)  is The legendary queen of [[South Cotabato]] known for her sense of justice and respect for the law.&lt;ref name="filipiknow.net"&gt;http://www.filipiknow.net/filipina-muslims-philippine-history/&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Empress Sasaban]]  (c.1300's) in oral tradition recounted by [[Nick Joaquin]] and Leonardo Vivencio, a "lady of Namayan" who went to the Madjapahit court to marry Emperor Soledan, eventually giving birth to Balagtas, who then returned to Namayan/Pasig in 1300.&lt;ref name="Odal2000"/&gt;{{rp|page=51}}

*[[Dayang Kalangitan]] (r. 1450–ca. 1515) is the only recorded ''Dayang'' or [[queen regnant]] of the [[History of the Philippines (900-1521)|pre-Hispanic Philippine kingdoms]] of [[Kingdom of Tondo|Tondo]] and [[Namayan]]. The eldest daughter of [[Rajah Gambang]] and [[co-regency|co-regent]] with her husband, [[Rajah Lontok]], she is considered one of the most powerful rulers in the kingdom's history. She is also notably a  Buddhist ruler of the kingdom, which encompassed land along the banks of the [[Pasig River]] in [[Metro Manila]].&lt;ref name="Odal2000"&gt;{{cite book|title=The River Dwellers|first=Grace|work=Pasig : The River of Life|publisher=Unilever Philippines|year=2000|isbn=|editor-last=Alejandro|editor-first=Reynaldo Gamboa|location=|pages=43–66|editor-last2=Yuson|editor-first2=Alfred A.|editor-link2=Alfred Yuson|author=Odal-Devora}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Tuanbaloka is woman from [[Basilan]] who ascended to power and become the Queen consort of [[Jolo]] known for her bravery as she and her husband held of the invaders with 4,000 warriors.&lt;ref name="filipiknow.net"/&gt;

=== Spanish Philippines ===

Although Christian values were supposed to be spread through the population, missionaries and priests soon realized that they'd be better off adapting their doctrine as much as possible to the local customs, rather than trying to impose it.  Although the concept of gender equality existed in the Philippines during the pre-Hispanic era this  changed when the Spaniards came and patterned the image of the Filipina to a meek and submissive individual.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.univie.ac.at/ksa/apsis/aufi/wstat/mujer.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  As it happened all over Asia, women in the Philippines were expected to become caring and nurturing mothers for their own children and take care of most household chores. Also a trait found all over Asia was the preference of most families to have male children instead of females.

During the last part of the [[colonization]] of the Philippines, [[Isabella II of Spain]],  introduced the Education Decree of 1863 (10 years before Japan had a compulsory free modern public education and 40 years before the United States government started a free modern public school system in the Philippines) that provided for the establishment and for the building of at least two free primary schools, one for the boys and another school for the girls, in each town under the responsibility of the municipal government.

===American Philippines===
When Spain lost the Spanish–American War in 1898, the Philippines was ceded to the United States of America.  The U.S.A. introduced a new public education system which retained opportunity to every child regardless of gender.

Through the American-patterned school system, Filipino women became professionals,&lt;ref name=Shah/&gt;&lt;ref name= Vartti2&gt;Vartti, Riitta (editor), “Women writers through the ages; The U.S. Period”, [http://www.filippiinit-seura.fi/firefly.html The History of Filipino Women's Writings, an article from Firefly – Filipino Short Stories (Tulikärpänen – filippiiniläisiä novelleja), 2001 / 2007], retrieved on: April 12, 2008, "...They (i.e. Filipino women) were now, for the first time equally with men, accepted to study..."; "...Their problem was the resistance of the patriarchal society..."; "...The first woman president Corazon Aquino was elected to power..."; "Many women writers, especially those from the capital area, participated in the development of the media since the 1930s..."; "...In the turn of the 1970s began a period of cultural revolution, student movements and new rise of nationalism. For the women writers it meant social awakening, commitment and protest..."; "...The Filipinas now wanted to create their own images by themselves..."&lt;/ref&gt; although most of them and their male counterparts opted for making use of their former education roots and expressed themselves in Spanish or Tagalog. According to the Monroe Commission on Philippine Education: “Upon leaving school, more than 99% of Filipinos will not speak English in their homes. Possibly, only 10% to 15% of the next generation will be able to use this language in their occupations. In fact, it will only be the government employees, and the professionals, who might make use of English.”&lt;ref&gt;"A Survey of the Educational System of the Philippine Islands", Monroe, Paul, 1925, pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary roles==
[[File:FvfTarlacCapitol9137 29.JPG|thumb|300px|Filipina [[Millennials]] preparing for town activities.]]
Modern-day Philippine women play a decisive role in Filipino families. They usually handle the money, act as religious mentors, and can also make all the important family decisions.

===Urban setting===
In the past, firms and businesses generally hire Filipino women for less pay and secretarial functions.&lt;ref name="Ozamiz" /&gt; But at present, Filipino women are given the same opportunities as their male counterparts in the business realm. This is due to the political and economic changes at the global and national levels in urban society that have led to the growth of export-based industries and the service sector, which then created more opportunities for Filipino women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ombudsman.gov.ph/UNDP4/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Chap-03.-Urban-Society-30Nov06-UPF.pdf|title=Gender and the Urban Political Economy|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About one-third of businesses in the Philippines are operated by Filipino women.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philippines Women in Culture, Business &amp; Travel: A Profile of Filipino Women in the Fabric of Society|last=|first=|publisher=World Trade Press, Inc.|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Filipino businesswomen in the urban sector can be found in the hospitality sector, marketing, publishing, real estate, transportation, financial consulting, trade and services, electronics and appliances, and much more.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Rural and tribal clan setting===
In rural areas, the Filipino woman belongs in the home.  The children approach her for money and help. She is the family's treasurer. She supports the children’s educational needs.  For non-family members who require support, the wife is the person to be approached. However, ]the wife is neither the person who makes the final decision or the person who hands out the money.&lt;ref name="Ozamiz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Encyclonations"&gt;{{cite web

[[Juan Flavier]], a physician, an authority on community development, and a former [[Senate of the Philippines|Philippine senator]], described in his book, ''[[Doctor to the Barrios]]'', that "whether some (Filipino) men are willing to admit it or not"... "rural women in the Philippines wield considerable authority," the housewife in particular.  This is especially if the housewife, who is often referred to as the ''Ilaw ng Tahanan'' (Light of the Home), is convinced of the benefits that will be gained from a certain practice such as the concept of family planning in the barrios.  Flavier also mentioned that "In the Philippine [[barrio]], the one responsible for the home" and its management "is the wife... she holds the key to... household... development."&lt;ref name=Flavier&gt;[[Flavier, Juan Martin]]. ''[[Doctor to the Barrios]]'', ''Experiences with the Philippine Reconstruction Movement'', ''Chapter 10: Family Planning in the Barrios'', New Day Publishers (1970/2007), p. 157, {{ISBN|971-10-0663-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage and relationships===

Courtship and relationships in the Philippines are conservative in nature. The man will have to court the woman and prove his love for her before he can win her heart. Sometimes the courtship period would last for years. This however, is a very old fashioned idea. In the bigger more urbanized cities, this conservative courtship idea is not so emphasized as much. Parents prefer their daughter to be courted in their home, so they can have a chance to know the man. It is during the courtship period that the man would put his best foot forward to create a good impression on the woman and her family. Generally, the man is being measured on his being a gentleman, ability to respect the woman's family, and servitude (the extent of what he was willing to do to prove his love for the woman). Usually, the woman is courted by several men and will have to choose the best from among her suitors. [[Courtship in the Philippines|Courtship and relationships remain the same for rural and urban areas]] despite the modern western influence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.western-asian.com/filipino-courtship] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128102040/http://www.western-asian.com/filipino-courtship|date=January 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livinginthephilippines.com/philculture/family.html Introduction to Philippine Culture&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muslim-marriage-guide.com/filipino-wedding-traditions.html Filipino Wedding Traditions and Spanish Influence], [http://www.muslim-marriage-guide.com muslim-marriage-guide.com].&lt;/ref&gt;

Culturally in the Philippines, divorce is viewed as negative and destructive, because of a tradition that emphasizes that the family is the core [[social unit]], especially for the Filipino wife.  Divorce is not perceived as a solution to any matrimonial-related problem because it hinders the development or progress of the basic community unit. Therefore, husband and wife are obligated to fix any problems within the boundaries of the marriage.&lt;ref name=Ozamiz/&gt;

It should be noted that women in the pre-colonial Philippines enjoyed nearly equal status with men {{dubious|date=February 2015}}.  Prior to colonization, both men and women could get a divorce for the following reasons: failure to meet family obligations, childlessness, and infidelity.  Children, regardless of gender, and properties were equally divided in a divorce. Since a man needed to pay a dowry to the woman's family, she was required to give it back should she be found at fault.  If the man was at fault, he then lost the right to get back his dowry.

In the Philippines, society valued offspring regardless of gender. Female children were as valuable as male ones, mainly because they recognized that women are as important as men. Parents provide equal opportunities to their children. Filipino daughters can also go to school like Filipino sons, Filipino daughters can also inherit property like Filipino sons, and Filipino daughters can also become village chiefs like Filipino sons.

In 1994, the [[John and Lorena Bobbitt]] case, in which a wife [[Penis removal|cut off the penis]] of her sleeping husband, seized the attention of media in the [[Philippines]], which reported that a similar incident had occurred in [[Cebu]] the previous November. The Bobbitt case was reported at a time when Filipino feminist groups were protesting against prostitution, the practice of [[mail-order bride]]s, and [[marital rape]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bobbitts' Case Gains Infamy In Philippines|author=AP|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=a6McAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=q28EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4340,3951594&amp;dq=philippines+cut+penis+wife&amp;hl=en|newspaper=Cavalier Daily|date=January 24, 1994|accessdate=January 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, a similar case in [[Pasig City]] was reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jealous wife cuts off husband's penis in Pasig City|author=Kristine L.

===Filipino women and work===
Traditionally, rural and tribal women do all the household related chores. Heavy works that require more strength is done by the husband. Now, the chore work is evenly distributed with the men doing just as much work as the women{{dubious|date=February 2015}}. The scope of their functions include cooking, cleaning, teaching the children, washing clothes, repairs, budgeting, and helping in the farm. The husband is the one who makes sure the farm would yield quality crops, so he does all the maintenance work. In some cases, where the husband needs help from other men, the wife would make sure that the men are fed, so she cooks food and bring it to the farm. The Filipino women, ensures that everyone is well fed, including any workers, relatives, or visitors.

In general, Filipino women find pride in their work. They do not find themselves alienated from their chores because they work with, around, and for their families. This family-oriented mindset gives them a sense of dignity and responsibility. The family and the children are the primary priority some Filipino women's life.&lt;ref name=Ozamiz/&gt; In addition to doing housework, the contemporary role of a Filipino wife today is to provide financial support in the household by seeking employment in higher-earning occupations which then expands the Filipino female work outside the household.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alcantara|first=Adelamar N.|date=1994-01-01|title=Gender Roles, Fertility, and the Status of Married Filipino Men and Women|jstor=41853665|journal=Philippine Sociological Review|volume=42|issue=1/4|pages=94–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women Workers in the Philippines|last=|first=|publisher=National Commission on the Role of Filipino Women|year=1985|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1900s, the female workforce in the Philippines was also a highly debated topic during workers’ conferences.  In 1910, during the first Congress of Labor, the decision to enact a law that would regulate the employment of women and children was approved due to poor working conditions (“dark and ill-ventilated rooms, smoke-filled factories”, etc.) for women and children.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Then, in March 1923, “An Act to Regulate the Employment of Women and Children in Agricultural and Non-Agricultural Establishments and Other Workplaces” was passed to oversee the welfare of women and children.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1960, under the Department of Labor, the Bureau of Women and Minors was created and was responsible for the promotion, development, and the protection of the welfare of working women and minors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Since then, more acts were made to oversee the welfare of women workers, as seen in both the 1935 and 1973 constitutions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Filipino women and Philippine politics===
{{Main article|Women and government in the Philippines}}

[[File:Corazon Aquino 1992.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Corazon C. Aquino]], 1992.]]
Compared to other countries, Filipino women have gained and enjoyed equal rights with men. They have become presidents, senators, congresswomen, mayors. They have served in government offices, and have held cabinet positions for presidents. Filipino women have proven that they are capable of carrying out responsibilities and tasks as well as their male counterparts. There are 48 women Representatives elected in the 15th Congress (2010 national election). They accounted for 21.6 percent of the total 222 Representatives as members of the Lower House. In 2010 Senatorial election, there were 14 women who ran out of 61 candidates (23.0%), of which two entered the top 12 winning senators (16.7%).&lt;ref&gt;http://pcw.gov.ph/statistics/201205/women-participation-politics-and-governance&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of [[Women and government in the Philippines|women who engage in politics]] are smaller compare to their male counterparts. This was primarily because engagement in politics is considered "dirty."

A recent study revealed that there is a re-emergence of the empowerment of Filipino women through the political process, just as they were prior to the arrival of conquerors from Spain. Philippine women are rediscovering their strengths. Filipino women had been successful in implementing policies by becoming executive staff members, advisers to politicians, and as advocates within non-governmental organizations.&lt;ref name=Shah/&gt;

Modern-day Filipino women are making strides in electoral politics by initiating more female-oriented programs. They are performing well as leaders, although generally, Filipino women still often earn political seats by having fathers and husbands who are politically connected, a "dynasty system" that hinders other Filipino women from joining the electoral process. Other factors that prevent full-engagement of other well-qualified Filipino women from the Philippine political scene are the expense in politics and the importance of the family name.&lt;ref name=Shah/&gt;

Participation of Filipino women in Philippine politics was encouraged during the Beijing Declaration in 1995 at the United Nations' Fourth World Conference on Women. In February 2005, however, a United Nations review on the progress of Philippine women and their role in politics revealed that despite "an increase in the quality of female politicians, there was not enough increase in" the number of women participants in government activities. From 1992 to 2001, Filipino women had been elected as local chief executives, functioning as mayors, governors, and captains of villages.

In his paintings of Filipino women, the [[Philippine National Artist]] [[Fernando Amorsolo]] rejected Western ideals of beauty in favor of Filipino ideals.&lt;ref name=Paras/&gt;  He said that the women he painted have "''a rounded face, not of the oval type often presented to us in newspapers and magazine illustrations. The eyes should be exceptionally lively, not the dreamy, sleepy type that characterizes the Mongolian. The nose should be of the blunt form but firm and strongly marked. ... So the ideal Filipino beauty should not necessarily be white complexioned, nor of the dark brown color of the typical Malayan, but of the clear skin or fresh colored type which we often witness when we met a blushing girl''."&lt;ref name=Paras&gt;Paras-Perez, Rodriguez.

'''Yeji''' is a town in south [[Ghana]]  and is the capital of [[Pru District]] of the [[Brong-Ahafo Region]] in Ghana. Yeji is in the north-east of [[Brong-Ahafo Region]], and is adjacent to [[Lake Volta]]. Yeji is connected by [[highway]] to [[Ejura]] and [[Kwadjokrom]]. It had a population of 29,515 at the census of 2010.&lt;ref name="Pru"&gt;[http://www.statsghana.gov.gh/docfiles/2010_District_Report/Brong%20Ahafo/Pru.pdf Ghana Statistical Service; 2010 Population &amp; Housing Census, District Analytical Report, Pru District ('''pdf-fil''')]&lt;/ref&gt;

Yeji and its surroundings form the homeland of a branch of the [[Chumburu]] people, who also have a traditional area in the kingdom of [[Chumburung]], at the other side of [[Lake Volta]]. They speak the [[Chumburung language]], but the Yeji dialect is quite different from the one spoken in Chumburung itself. Apart from the Chumburu, [[Kokomba]]s, [[Gonja people|Gonjas]] and others are also native in Yeji.

'''Zambian cuisine''' is heavily centered around [[nshima]], which is a food prepared from pounded white [[maize]]. Nshima is part of nearly every [[Zambia|Zambian]] meal. In addition to nshima, Zambian cuisine includes various types of [[stew]], cooked [[Vegetable|vegetables]] and different types of [[beer]]. Dried fish and insects are also eaten.

Zambia's [[staple food]] is [[maize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=funk&amp;AN=ZA001200&amp;site=ehost-live|title=Funk &amp; Wagnalls New World Encyclopedia|last=|first=|publisher=World Book Inc.|year=2017|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=|subscription=yes|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nshima]] makes up the main component of Zambian meals and is made from pounded white maize.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mushemifire.com/baked-under-the-zambian-sun-interview-with-mushemi-fire/|title=Baked Under The Zambian Sun - Interview with Mushemi Fire - Mushemi Fire|last=|first=|date=|website=Meshemi Fire|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503030620/https://www.mushemifire.com/baked-under-the-zambian-sun-interview-with-mushemi-fire/|archive-date=3 May 2016|access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Else|2002|p=50}} It is served with "relish," stew and vegetables and eaten by hand (preferably the right hand).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Sfn|Else|2002|p=50}} Nshima is eaten during lunch and dinner.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Nshima may be made at home, at food stalls and at restaurants.{{Sfn|Else|2002|p=50}}{{Sfn|Else|2002|p=93}} In traditional communities, the making of nshima is a long process, which includes drying the maize, sorting the kernels, pounding it and then finally cooking it.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peoplesoftheworld.org/hosted/chewa/|title=The Chewa|last=Gough|first=Amy|date=2004|website=|publisher=The Peoples of The World Foundation|accessdate=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The types of relish eaten with nshima can be very simple, such as ''chibwabwa'', or [[pumpkin]] leaves.{{Sfn|Else|2002|p=93}} Or it may be much fancier, and therefore, more expensive.{{Sfn|Else|2002|p=93}} Other names for the relish are ''ndiwo, ndiyo'', ''umunani'' or ''dende''.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hungerforculture.com/?page_id=591|title=Nshima and Ndiwo: Zambian Staple Food|last=Tembo|first=Mwizenge S.|date=|website=Hunger For Culture|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224091611/http://www.hungerforculture.com/?page_id=591|archive-date=24 February 2017|access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relish made with green vegetables is generally known as ''delele'' or ''thelele''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A unique way to create relish relies on cooking with ''chidulo'' and ''kutendela''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ''Chidulo'' is used in dishes made with green, leafy vegetables and also for wild mushrooms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The ''chidulo'' is made of burnt, dry [[banana]] leaves, bean stalks or maize stalks and leaves.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The ashes are then collected, added to water and strained.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The resulting liquid tastes like [[vinegar]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ''Kutendela'' is a prepared [[peanut]] powder made of pounded raw peanuts and is added to the chidulo sauce.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Kapenta]], a small [[sardine]] from [[Lake Tanganyika]] has been introduced in lakes in Zambia.{{Sfn|Nyakupfuka|2013|p=69}} The fish is caught and dried to be cooked later, or it can be cooked fresh.{{Sfn|Nyakupfuka|2013|p=69}} [[Gizzard|Gizzards]] are also a popular delicacy in Zambia.{{Sfn|Nyakupfuka|2013|p=120}}

=== Alcohol ===
In Zambia, traditional [[beer]] is made from maize.{{Sfn|Else|2002|p=94}} Individual villages once brewed their own recipes and it was shared communally.{{Sfn|Else|2002|p=94-95}} Maize beer is also brewed commercially in [[Lusaka]], with Chibuku and Shake-Shake being popular brands.{{Sfn|Else|2002|p=95}} Other types of beer that are popular include Mosi and Rhino.{{Sfn|Else|2002|p=94}} The first Zambian beer festival was held on September 25, 2009 at the [[Barclays Sports Complex]] in Lusaka.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.zambia-advisor.com/Zambia-Beer-Festival.html|title=The First Zambia Beer Festival|last=|first=|date=|work=Zambia Advisor|access-date=2018-02-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170607034813/http://www.zambia-advisor.com:80/Zambia-Beer-Festival.html|archive-date=7 June 2017|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The use of [[maize]] in dishes such as ''nsima'' or ''nshima'' happened during the latter half of the twentieth century.{{Sfn|McCann|2009|p=139}}

The [[Bemba people]], who live in what is now Zambia, traditionally ate what was available depending on weather patterns.{{Sfn|McCann|2009|p=18}} Bemba meals included a type of thick [[porridge]] made of [[millet]] called ''ubwali'' which was eaten with "relish" called ''umunani''.{{Sfn|Richards|1939|p=46}} ''Ubwali'' was eaten with nearly every meal.{{Sfn|Richards|1939|p=47}} ''Umunani'' was most often a type of stew made with meat, fish, insects or vegetables.{{Sfn|Richards|1939|p=48-49}} The Bemba preferred to eat ''ubwali'' with only one type of relish at a time.{{Sfn|Richards|1939|p=49}} The stews made with meat and vegetables were cooked with salt and sometimes [[Groundnut|ground-nuts]].{{Sfn|Richards|1939|p=49}} Generally, the Bemba did not eat raw food.{{Sfn|Richards|1939|p=53}} Overall, Bemba cooking was fairly plain in taste and only occasionally acidic or spicy.{{Sfn|Richards|1939|p=54-55}} Beer was an imprortant part of social events for the Bemba people and beer was brewed often during harvest months.{{Sfn|Richards|1939|p=78}}{{Sfn|Richards|1939|p=79-80}} 

Like the Bemba, the [[Chewa people]] also eat a [[porridge]], called ''nsima'', which is eaten with vegetables and used as a scoop.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The [[Tonga people (Zambia and Zimbabwe)|Tonga people]] of the region have traditionally eaten insects which are cooked or dried.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thepatriot.co.zw/old_posts/nutritious-insects-among-the-batonga/|title=Nutritious insects among the BaTonga|last=Siamonga|first=Elliot|date=24 August 2017|website=Celebrating Being Zimbabwean|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180218210053/https://www.thepatriot.co.zw/old_posts/nutritious-insects-among-the-batonga/|archive-date=18 February 2018|access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
