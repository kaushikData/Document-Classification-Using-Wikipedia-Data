'''Anders Wedberg''' (March 30, 1913 – February 20, 1978) was a Swedish [[philosopher]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1978/02/23/archives/anders-wedberg-64-in-sweden-known-for-works-on-philosophy.html Anders Wedberg, 64, in Sweden; Known for Works on Philosophy] ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

Wedberg was born in [[Stockholm]]. His father was the prominent [[lawyer]] and member of the [[Swedish Academy]] Birger Wedberg. Anders was the father of [[chess]] player [[Tom Wedberg]].

Wedberg studied at [[Uppsala University]] under [[Axel Hägerström]], among others. In 1949 he became the first full professor of [[theoretical philosophy]] at [[Stockholm University]], and he remained there until his retirement in 1975. From 1939 to 1943 he studied at [[Princeton University|Princeton]] and [[Harvard]] and taught at [[Cornell]].

His most important theoretical work was the book ''Plato's Philosophy of Mathematics'' from 1955. His most known work, however, is his three volume work on the history of philosophy, ''Filosofins historia'', which appeared between 1958 and 1966. This work was translated into English and was published by [[Oxford University Press]] in 1982 to 1984. His approach in these volumes was new (at least in Sweden), in that it attempted to interpret and analyze past philosophers using the plethora of analytic methods available to modern philosophers. Through his work and his teaching, Wedberg contributed to a reorientation of Swedish philosophy in the direction of more analytic rigor.&lt;ref&gt;Abridged translation from Swedish Wikipedia ([[:sv:Anders Wedberg]]){{Better source|date=September 2016|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He translated from German [[Hans Kelsen]]'s ''General Theory of Law and State'' (1945).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelsen|first=Hans|title=General Theory of Law and State|location=Cambridge, Mass.|publisher=Harvard U.P.|date=1945}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antoun Saadeh''' ({{lang-ar|أنطون سعادة|Anṭūn Sa‘ādeh}}; 1 March 1904 – 8 July 1949) was a [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] philosopher, writer and politician who founded the [[Syrian Social Nationalist Party]].

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Saadeh was born in 1904 in [[Dhour El Choueir]], Mount Lebanon. He was the son of a [[Lebanese Greek Orthodox Christians|Lebanese Christian Orthodox]] physician,{{sfn|Peretz|1994|p=384}} Khalil Saadeh&lt;ref name=SSNP/&gt; and Naifa Nassir Khneisser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ssnp.net/content/view/104/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416181231/http://ssnp.net/content/view/104/ |archivedate=16 April 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was himself a [[Syrian nationalist]] as well as democracy advocate, and also an intellectual and author, who has been described as "a prolific writer and [[polymath]], whose works span the fields of politics, literature, journalism, novel-writing, and translation".&lt;ref&gt;Adel Beshara, ''The Origins of Syrian Nationhood : Histories, Pioneers and Identity'', [[Taylor &amp; Francis]] (2012), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Antoun Saadeh completed his elementary education in his birth town and continued his studies at the Lycée des Frères in Cairo and came back to Lebanon at the death of his mother.&lt;ref&gt;antounsaadeh.com/bio&lt;/ref&gt; In the later part of 1919, Saadeh emigrated to the United States, where he resided for approximately one year with his uncle in [[Springer, New Mexico]] and worked at a local train station. In February 1921, he moved to [[Brazil]] with his father who was a prominent Arabic-language journalist. In 1924, Saadeh founded a secret society which aimed at the unification of ''Natural Syria''. This society was dissolved the following year. ''Natural Syria'', according to Saadeh, included the [[Levant]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]], Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and parts of Southern Turkey. His concept of Syria included all religious, ethnic and linguistic groups living in this region.{{sfn|Peretz|1994|p=384}} During his time spent in Brazil, Saadeh learned German and Russian.&lt;ref name=SSNP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ssnp.org/new/Saadeh/saadeh_en.htm |title=Antun Saadeh |date= |work= |publisher=[[Syrian Social Nationalist Party]] |accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, he became a [[polyglot]] fluent in seven languages : [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[English language|English]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Russian language|Russian]].&lt;ref&gt;Rabi'a Abifadel, ''Sa'adeh : The Expatriate Critic and Man of Letters'' in Adel Beshara (ed.), ''Antun Sa'adeh : The Man, His Thought : an Anthology'', Ithaca Press (2007), p. 442&lt;/ref&gt;

===Activity in Lebanon===
In July 1930, he returned to Lebanon. In 1931, he wrote "A Love Tragedy" which was first published with his "Story of the Holiday of Our Lady of Sidnaya" in Beirut in 1933. Also, in 1931, Saadeh worked at the daily newspaper ''[[Al-Ayyam (Damascus)|Al-Ayyam]]'', then in 1932 he taught [[German language|German]] at the [[American University of Beirut]].{{sfn|Peretz|1994|p=384}} In 1933, he continued to publish pamphlets in the Al-Majalia magazine in Beirut.&lt;ref name=SSNP/&gt;

On 16 November 1932, Saadeh secretly founded the [[Syrian Social Nationalist Party]]. Three years later, on 16 November 1935, the existence of the party was proclaimed, and Saadeh was arrested and sentenced to six years imprisonment. During his confinement, he wrote his first book, "The Rise of Nations". He was released from prison early, but was once again detained in June 1936 where he wrote another book, "Principles Explained". In November of the same year, he was released from prison, but in March 1937, he was arrested again. During the time he spent in prison, he wrote his third book, "The Rise of the Syrian Nation", but his manuscript was confiscated and the authorities refused to return it to him.&lt;ref name=SSNP/&gt;

===Activity in emigration===
He was released from prison in late May 1937. In November 1937, Saadeh founded the newspaper ''Al-Nahdhah''. Saadeh led the party until 1938 then, for the second time, he left the country in order to establish party branches in the Lebanese emigration countries. Saadeh went to Brazil and founded the newspaper "New Syria". Soon afterwards he was arrested by the French colonial authorities and spent two months in prison. In 1939, at the outbreak of [[World War II]], Saadeh moved to [[Argentina]], where he remained until 1947. In Argentina, Saadeh continued his activities. He founded Al-Zawba'a (The storm) newspaper and wrote "The Struggle of the Intellect in Syrian Literature", which was printed in [[Buenos Aires]]. In 1943, Saadeh married Juliette Al-Mir and had three daughters with her. The French colonial court sentenced him ''in absentia'' to twenty years of imprisonment.&lt;ref name=SSNP/&gt;

===Return to Lebanon and execution===
[[File:Saada.jpg|thumb|upright|Saadeh in Lebanon]]
Saadeh returned to Lebanon on 2 March 1947, following the country's independence from France. After his return, he made a revolutionary speech, upon which the authorities issued an arrest warrant which was in force for seven months and then withdrawn. In Lebanon, Saadeh founded the newspaper ''Al-Jil Al-Jadid''. On 4 July 1949, the party declared a revolution in Lebanon in retaliation for a series of violent provocations staged by the government of Lebanon against party members. &lt;!--citation needed for what looks rather like SSNP propaganda: These acts were supported by foreign powers trying to limit the influence of the party in the anti-sectarian movement and its influence on the Palestinian issue and in the spreading of the idea of a stronger united and independent Syrian Nation. --&gt; The revolt was suppressed and Saadeh traveled to [[Damascus]] to meet with [[Husni al-Za'im]], the President of [[Syria]] at the time, who had previously agreed to support him. However, he was handed over by el-Zai'm to the Lebanese authorities. Saadeh and many of his followers were judged by a Lebanese military court, and were executed, Saadeh himself by a firing squad.{{sfn|Johnson|2001|p=150}} The capture, trial and execution happened in less than 48 hours.&lt;ref name=armanazi&gt;{{cite news|last=Armanazi |first=Ghayth |title=The Arab Poet Laureate: An Appreciation of Adonis |url=http://thelondonmagazine.org/issues/oct-nov-2011/the-arab-poet-laureate-an-appreciation-of-adonis/ |accessdate=24 October 2012 |newspaper=The London Magazine |date=October–November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620184957/http://thelondonmagazine.org/issues/oct-nov-2011/the-arab-poet-laureate-an-appreciation-of-adonis/ |archivedate=20 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Saadeh's execution took place at dawn of 8 July 1949.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} According to Adel Beshara, it was and still is the shortest and most secretive trial given to a political offender.

His party continued to be active after his death. The President of Lebanon [[Camille Chamoun]] was supported by Saadeh's party during the [[1958 Lebanon crisis]]. In 1961, the SSNP attempted a coup d'état against President [[Fuad Shihab]], which ended in failure. During the 1960s, party leaders were arrested and eventually the party splintered into separate factions.{{sfn|Johnson|2001|p=150}}

===Syrian Social Nationalist Party===
[[File:SadheeSYRIA-ar.jpg|thumb|As envisioned by Saadeh and the SSNP, "[[Greater Syria in pan-Syrian nationalism|Natural Syria]]" includes modern [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Jordan]], [[Iraq]], [[Kuwait]], [[Cyprus]], the [[Sinai Peninsula]], the [[Ahvaz]] region of [[Iran]], and the [[Kilikia]]n region of [[Anatolia]]]]
The SSNP "Zawbaa" (Vortex, Tempest) is a glyph combining the Muslim crescent and the Christian cross, derived from Mesopotamian art, and it symbolizes the blood shed by the martyrs which makes the wheel of history whirl forward, dissipating the surrounding darkness (representing sectarianism and Ottoman occupation and the colonial oppression which followed). Within the party, Saadeh gained a cult of personality and advocated a totalitarian system of government, at the same time glorifying the pre-Christian past of the Syrian people. Saadeh was named the party leader for life. However, according to Haytham,&lt;ref&gt;"Antun Saadeh, the man,his thought, an anthology"&lt;/ref&gt; Saadeh stated that European fascism didn't influence him. Haytham claims that Saadeh's Syrian Social Nationalist ideology aimed at opposite ends; in contrast to National Socialism, Social Nationalism bases itself on a dynamic social entity (which is composed of many elements, from religion to language, culture, history, need, and mainly human interaction) defining its national identity and not the imposition of one ideal identity (e.g. [[blond|blond hair]], [[eye color#blue|blue eyes]]) on the many factions.

Saadeh emphasized the role of philosophy and [[social science]] in the development of his social ideology. He viewed social nationalism, his version of nationalism, as a tool to transform traditional society into a dynamic and progressive one. He also opposed colonization that broke up [[Greater Syria]] into sub-states. [[Secularization]] played an important role in his ideology. Secularization is taken by him beyond the socio-political aspects of the question into its philosophical dimensions.

Saadeh rejected [[Arab Nationalism]] (the idea that the speakers of the [[Arabic language]] form a single, unified nation), and argued instead for the creation of the state of [[Greater Syria in pan-Syrian nationalism|United Syrian Nation or Natural Syria]], encompassing the [[Fertile Crescent]], making up a Syrian homeland that "extends from the [[Taurus Mountains|Taurus]] range in the northwest and the [[Zagros]] mountains in the northeast to the [[Suez Canal]] and the [[Red Sea]] in the south and includes the [[Sinai]] peninsula and the [[Gulf of Aqaba]], and from the [[Syrian Sea]] in the west, including the island of [[Cyprus]], to the arch of the [[Arabian Desert]] and the [[Persian Gulf]] in the east." (Kader, H. A.).
[[File:The Return of Saadeh.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=3:42|Film in Arabic about Saadeh's return to Lebanon]]
Saadeh rejected both language and religion as defining characteristics of a nation, and instead argued that nations develop through the common development of a people inhabiting a specific geographical region. He was thus a strong opponent of both Arab nationalism and [[Pan-Islamism]]. He argued that Syria was historically, culturally, and geographically distinct from the rest of the Arab world, which he divided into four parts.  He traced Syrian history as a distinct entity back to the [[Phoenicians]], [[Canaanites]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Babylonians]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssnp.org/new/library/saadeh/misc/en/maronites.htm Saadeh&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and argued that Syrianism transcended religious distinctions.&lt;ref name=Kader&gt;{{cite web|last=Kader|first=Dr. Haytham A.|title=Syrian Social Nationalist Party – Ideology|url=http://www.ssnp.org/new/ssnp/en/ssnp.htm|accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These claims of alleged National Socialist and Fascist ideology of his party were denied by Saadeh himself. During a 1935 speech, Saadeh said: "I want to use this opportunity to say that the system of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party is neither a Hitlerite nor a Fascist one, but a pure social nationalist one. It is not based on useless imitation, but is instead the result of an authentic invention – which is a virtue of our people".&lt;ref name="Nordbruch2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Götz Nordbruch|title=Nazism in Syria and Lebanon: The Ambivalence of the German Option, 1933–1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iAWBkDAv4TkC&amp;pg=PA45|accessdate=23 October 2012|date=4 February 2009|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-45714-9|pages=45–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|quote     = ''Al-Madrahiyyah'' consists of calling the nations to discard the doctrine which regards Spirit as the only motor of human progress, or Matter as the fundamental basis of human development ; to give up once and for all the idea that the world is by necessity in a state of war in which spiritual forces are continuously fighting with material forces ; and finally to admit with us that the basis of human development is spiritual-materialist and that superior humanity recognizes this basis and builds the edifice of the future on it. The world, which has come to realize, especially after the last world war [World War II], how destructive the partial philosophies and ideologies of capitalism, Marxism, fascism and national socialism have been, is today in need of a new social philosophy that can save it from the arbitrariness and error of these ideologies.

}}
Saadeh had an [[holistic]] notion of science, as "knowledge is that it revolves around interaction of the self with the surrounding physical conditions" and was against [[epistemological]] [[reductionism]], considering that "the self plays an active role in creating the conditions that transform things into objects of knowledge. This self, as a social self, is the product of several dynamics – mind, intuition, the practical and the existential. It does not depend on one factor and exclude the others." His whole thought was a refutation of the "individualist doctrine, whether in its sociological or methodological orientations". For him, man was a totality by himself as much as in connection with his immediate surrounding, a social being but with its own dignity, which brings him closer to the [[personalism]] of someone like [[Nikolai Berdyaev]], and in his vision, the society's main role was to shape the individual being-as-relation through the [[Khaldunian]] notion of [[assabiya]] (solidarity), which, through some common features (geography, language, culture, ...) brings out the best in him, but without oppressing his individual liberties nor negligible either the spiritual or the material aspect, like he witnessed in contemporary ideologies such as [[communism]], [[fascism]] or [[national-socialism]]. Thus, "the concept of man-society is the axis of Sa'adeh’s theory of human existence. What is meant by this concept is that existence at a human level and existence at a social level are not independent phenomena ; rather, they are one phenomenon, two aspects of the same social essence." &lt;ref&gt;Adnan Amshi, "Sa'adeh’s Philosophical Doctrine" in Adel Beshara (ed.), ''Antun Sa'adeh : The Man, His Thought : an Anthology'', Ithaca Press (2007), pp. 353-372&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nationalism===
He had a regionalist vision of nationalism because he gave some utmost importance to geography : even if he was not an utmost [[environmental determinist]], he thought that a man's relation with his milieu involves a certain way of acting, because of the different climate, fauna or flora ; men will manage their resources differently whether they're in mountains or desert, which will also have consequences on their interactions with foreign groups (over the control of the same resources and so on). Thus the notion of homeland was dear to him. On [[racialism]] - which was associated with nationalism in many European ideologies -, "he argued that, contrary to common belief, race is a purely physical concept that has nothing to do with the psychological or social differences between human communities. People differ among themselves by their physical features – that is, colour, height, appearance – and are accordingly divided into races. Nationalism, however, cannot be founded on this reality. Every nation is made up of diverse racial groups, and none of them is the product of one race or one specific tribe." &lt;ref&gt;Nassif Nassar, "Sa'adeh and the Concept of Regional Nationalism" in Adel Beshara (ed.), ''Antun Sa'adeh : The Man, His Thought : an Anthology'', Ithaca Press (2007), pp. 19-25&lt;/ref&gt;

===The socio-economic cycle===
Contrarily to  [[Zaki al-Arsuzi]] and other [[Arab nationalists]] who were influenced by European thinkers' vision of race and language - notably [[Fichte]] -, Saadeh thus developed his own vision, more inclusive and synthetic. It's a "dynamic theory of nationalism for the whole society based on union in life and the socio-economic cycle (...) not deterministic. Land and people are two important ingredients of the nation but are not the nation themselves (...) is a civilizing theory because it recognizes the necessity and inevitability of interaction between nations (...) the interaction process has two poles: the first, economic possibilities
of the environment; and the second, society’s ability to benefit from such possibilities (...) interaction takes place on two levels: horizontally, which determines the extent and character of regional interaction; and, vertically,
between man and land, out of which a horizontal interaction may or may not occur (...) unlike [[Marxism]], which reduced the economic question to one of class and considered the national question synonymous with the
bourgeoisie, the concept of the socio-economic cycle is basically a societal concept (...) the mind is a primary factor in human progress. It is a liberating force and a complex entity that should not be viewed from just one
angle. For Sa'adeh, the mind represents the liberation of human energy and its incorporation into the process of socio-economic interaction." &lt;ref&gt;In'am Raad, "Union in Life : Sa'adeh’s Notion of the Socio-Economic Cycle" in Adel Beshara (ed.), ''Antun Sa'adeh : The Man, His Thought : an Anthology'', Ithaca Press (2007), pp. 48-70&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Archon''''' ({{lang-el|ἄρχων}}, ''árchon'', &lt;small&gt;plural:&lt;/small&gt; ἄρχοντες, ''árchontes'') is a [[Greek language|Greek]] word that means "ruler", frequently used as the title of a specific public office. It is the masculine present participle of the verb stem αρχ-, meaning "to rule", derived from the same root as ''[[monarch]]'' and ''[[hierarchy]]''.

==Ancient Greece==
In the early literary period of [[ancient Greece]] the chief [[magistrates]] of various Greek city states were called ''Archon''.{{sfn|Mitchell|1911|p=444}} The term was also used throughout Greek history in a more general sense, ranging  from "club leader" to "master of the tables" at ''[[syssitia]]'' to "Roman governor".{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} In Roman terms, ''archontes'' ruled by ''[[imperium]]'', whereas ''[[Basileus|basileis]]'' ("[[king]]s") had ''[[auctoritas]]''.

In [[Athens]] a system of three concurrent Archons evolved, the three office holders being known as the ''[[Archon Eponymos]]'', the ''[[Polemarch]]'', and the ''Archon [[Basileus]]''.{{sfn|Mitchell|1911|p=444}} According to [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|Constitution of the Athenians]]'', the power of the king first devolved to the archons, and these offices were filled from the aristocracy by elections every ten years. During this period the Archon Eponymos was the chief magistrate, the Polemarch was the head of the armed forces, and the Archon Basileus was responsible for the civic religious arrangements. After 683 BC the offices were held for only a single year, and the year was named after the Archon Eponymos. (Many ancient [[calendar]] systems did not number their years consecutively.) Although the process of the next transition is unclear, after 487 BC the archonships were assigned by lot to any citizen and the Polemarch's military duties were taken over by a new class of generals known as ''[[strategoi]]''. The Polemarch thereafter had only minor religious duties. The Archon Eponymos remained the titular head of state under [[democracy]], though of much reduced political importance. The Archons were assisted by "junior Archons", called ''Thesmothetes''. After 457 BC ex-archons were automatically enrolled as life members of the [[Areopagus]], though that assembly was no longer extremely important politically at that time.{{sfn|Mitchell|1911|p=445}}

Under the Athenian constitution, Archons were also in charge of organizing festivals by bringing together poets, playwrights, actors, and city-appointed [[choregos|choregai]] (wealthy citizen patrons). The Archon would begin this process months in advance of a festival by selecting a chorus of three playwrights based on descriptions of the projected plays.  Each playwright would be assigned a choregos, also selected by the Archon, from among the wealthy citizens who would pay all the expenses of costumes, masks, and training the chorus.  The Archon also assigned each playwright a principal actor (the ''protagonist''), as well as a second and third actor. The City Dionysia, an ancient dramatic festival held in March in which tragedy, comedy, and satyric drama originated, was under the direction of one of the principal magistrates, the ''archon eponymos''. The ''archon eponymos'' remained the titular head of state under [[democracy]], though of much reduced political importance.{{sfn|Mitchell|1911|p=445}}

==Byzantine Empire==
[[Byzantine]] historians usually described foreign rulers as ''archontes''.&lt;ref&gt;Aksum: an African civilisation of late antiquity By Stuart C. Munro-Hay  Page 145 {{ISBN|0-7486-0209-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rulers of the [[Bulgars]] themselves, along with their [[kanasubigi|own titles]], often bear the title ''archon placed by God'' in inscriptions in Greek.

Inside Byzantium, the term could be used to refer to any powerful noble or magnate, but in a technical sense, it was applied to a class of provincial governors. In the 8th and 9th centuries, these were the governors of some of the more peripheral provinces, inferior in status to the ''[[Theme (Byzantine district)|thema]]ta'': [[Dalmatia]], [[Cephalonia]], [[Crete]] and [[Cyprus]]. ''Archontes'' were also placed in charge of various naval bases and trade stations, as well as semi-autonomous [[Slavs|Slavic]]-inhabited areas (''[[sclaviniae]]'') under Byzantine sovereignty. In the 10th–12th centuries, ''archontes'' are also mentioned as the governors of specific cities. The area of an archon's jurisdiction was called an '''''archontia''''' ({{lang|grc|ἀρχοντία}}).&lt;ref name="ODB"&gt;{{ODB | page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title was also used for the holders of several financial posts, such as the head of the [[mint (facility)|mint]] ({{lang|grc|ἄρχων τῆς χαραγῆς}}), as well as directors of the imperial workshops, arsenals, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{ODB | pages=160–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of '''''[[megas archon]]''''' ("grand archon") is also attested, as a translation of foreign titles such as "grand prince". In the mid-13th century, it was established as a special court rank, held by the highest-ranking official of the emperor's company. It existed throughout the [[Palaiologan period]], but did not have any specific functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Mark C. | last = Bartusis | title = The Late Byzantine Army: Arms and Society 1204-1453 | publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press | year = 1997 | isbn = 0-8122-1620-2 | page=382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archons of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople==
From time to time, [[laity]] of the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox Church]] in communion with the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]] have been granted the title of ''Archon'' to honor their service to Church administration. In 1963, Archons were organized into a service society dedicated to [[Saint Andrew|St Andrew]]. This ''Archon'' status is not part of the Church hierarchy and is purely honorary. See http://www.archons.org/ .

An Archon is an honoree by His All Holiness the Ecumenical Patriarch, for his outstanding service to the Church, and a well-known, distinguished, and well-respected leader of the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox Church]] (at large).

It is the sworn oath of the Archon to defend and promote the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox Church]] faith and tradition. His main concern is to protect and promote the Holy Patriarchate and its mission. He is also concerned with [[human rights]] and the well-being and general welfare of the Church.

As it is a significant religious position, the faith and dedication of a candidate for the role are extensively reviewed during consideration; the candidate should have demonstrated commitment for the betterment of the Church, Parish-Diocese, Archdiocese and the community as a whole.

==Other uses==
"Archon" is also used in Modern Greek colloquially, as ''άρχοντας'' (''archontas)'' to someone that holds a form of status, or power &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.slang.gr/lemma/9091-arxontas|title=Άρχοντας - SLANG.gr|author=|date=|website=www.slang.gr|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is used within the [[Arabic|Arab]]-speaking [[Copt]]s in church parlance as a [[title]] for a leading member of the [[laity]].{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Various [[fraternities and sororities]] use the title of archon or variations on it.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Some [[Gnosticism|Gnostic sects]] used this term for [[Archon (Gnosticism)|demons]] associated with the planetspheres.

Cologne" at http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/MWScanpdf/mw0755-bhAvodaya.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;) literally means "development"&lt;ref&gt;See various translations cited in the notes below.&lt;/ref&gt; or "cultivating"&lt;ref&gt;[[Matthieu Ricard]] has said this in a talk.&lt;/ref&gt; or "producing"&lt;ref name="PED" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MWD" /&gt; in the sense of "calling into existence."&lt;ref name="manual"&gt;[[Nyanatiloka]] (1980), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an important concept in Buddhist [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] (''Patipatti''). The word ''bhavana'' normally appears in conjunction with another word forming a compound phrase such as ''citta-bhavana'' (the development or cultivation of the heart/mind) or ''metta-bhavana'' (the development/cultivation of lovingkindness). When used on its own ''bhavana'' signifies [[contemplation]] and 'spiritual cultivation' generally.

==Etymology==

''Bhavana'' derives from the word ''[[Bhava]]'' meaning ''becoming'' or the subjective process of arousing mental states.

To explain the cultural context of the historical Buddha's employment of the term, Glenn Wallis emphasizes ''bhavana'''s sense of cultivation.  He writes that a farmer performs ''bhavana'' when he or she prepares soil and plants a seed.  Wallis infers the Buddha's intention with this term by emphasizing the terrain and focus on farming in northern India at the time in the following passage:
{{quote|I imagine that when Gotama, the Buddha, chose this word to talk about meditation, he had in mind the ubiquitous farms and fields of his native India. Unlike our words 'meditation' or 'contemplation,' Gotama’s term is musty, rich, and verdant. It smells of the earth. The commonness of his chosen term suggests naturalness, everydayness, ordinariness. The term also suggests hope: no matter how fallow it has become, or damaged it may be, a field can always be cultivated — endlessly enhanced, enriched, developed — to produce a favorable and nourishing harvest.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Wallis, Bhavana: A Guide to Classical Buddhist Meditation, 2009, draft copy, p. 7  {{cite web|url=http://www.glennwallis.com/files/Bhavana_6-20-09.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727231248/http://www.glennwallis.com/files/Bhavana_6-20-09.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Buddhism==
In the [[Pali Canon]] ''bhāvanā'' is often found in a compound phrase indicating personal, intentional effort over time with respect to the development of that particular faculty.  For instance, in the [[Pali Canon]] and post-canonical literature one can find the following compounds:
:* '''''[[citta]]-bhāvanā''''', translated as "development of mind"&lt;ref name="kaya_citta"&gt;See, e.g., [[Digha Nikaya|DN]] 33.1.10(48), trans. by Walshe (1995), p. 486; and, [[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 36, trans. by Ñā{{IAST|ṇ}}amoli &amp; Bodhi (2001), pp. 332-343.&lt;br /&gt;Both DN 33 and MN 36 juxtapose ''citta-bhāvanā'' with ''kāya-bhāvanā''.  In DN 33, it is said that there are three types of development: of body (''kāya''), of mind (''citta''), and of wisdom (''paññā'').  In end notes to MN 36, Bodhi (pp. 1228-29, nn. 382, 384) states that the MN [[atthakatha|commentary]] explains that "development of the body" refers to [[vipassana|insight]] and "development of mind" refers to [[Samadhi (Buddhism)|''samādhi'']].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also see [[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 1.22 and 1.24 (a/k/a, AN I,iii,1 and 3), trans. by [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an01/an01.021-040.than.html Thanissaro (2006);] and, AN 1.51-52 (a/k/a, AN I,vi,1-2), trans. by [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an01/an01.049.than.html Thanissaro (1995)], as well as trans. by Nyanaponika &amp; Bodhi (1999), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; or "development of consciousness."

:&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Bhikkhuni]] Dhammadinn{{IAST|ā}}:] "Singleness of mind is concentration, friend Visakha; the [[Satipatthana|four frames of reference]] are its themes; the [[four right exertions]] are its requisites; and any cultivation, development, &amp; pursuit of these qualities is its development."&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, in the Canon, the development (''bhāvanā'') of ''[[samatha]]-[[vipassana]]'' is lauded.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., in [[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 151, the Buddha states that a bhikkhu who has developed ''[[samatha]]-[[vipassana]]'' (or any of the seven sets of [[Bodhipakkhiya dhamma|Enlightenment-conducive qualities]]) "can abide happy and glad, training day and night in wholesome states" (trans., Ñāṇamoli &amp; Bodhi, 2001, p. 1145).  Additionally, [[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 4.170 identifies three ways in which an arahant develops ''samatha-vipassana'':  ''samatha'' first; ''vipassana'' first; or both in tandem (Nyanaponika &amp; Bodhi, 1999, p. 114; and, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.170.than.html Thanissaro, 1998b).]  See also the [[Paracanonical texts (Theravada Buddhism)|paracanonical]] [[Nettipakarana|Nett]] 91 (Rhys Davids &amp; Stede, 1921-25, p. 503, entry for "Bhāvanā," retrieved 9 Dec 2008 from "U. Chicago" at http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.2:1:3558.pal).&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, [[Theravada]] teachers have made use of the following compounds:
:* '''''[[samatha]]-bhāvanā''''', meaning the development of tranquility.&lt;ref name="manual" /&gt;
:* '''''[[vipassanā]]-bhāvanā''''', meaning the development of insight.&lt;ref name="manual" /&gt;

The word bhavana is sometimes translated into English as '[[Buddhist meditation|meditation]]' so that, for example, metta-bhavana may be translated as 'the meditation on loving-kindness'. Meditation is properly called ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyana]]'' (Sanskrit; Pali: ''jhāna''), as practiced in [[Samadhi (Buddhism)|''samādhi'']], the 8th limb of the eightfold path.

==In Jainism==
In [[Jainism]], ''bhāvana'' refers to "right conception or notion" or "the moral of a fable."&lt;ref name="MWD" /&gt;

==Life and Work==
David E. Cooper is a British author and philosopher. He was brought up in Surrey and educated at Highgate School and then Oxford University, where he was given his first job in 1967, as a Lecturer in Philosophy. He went on to teach at the universities of Miami, London and Surrey before being appointed, in 1986, as Professor of Philosophy at Durham University – where he remained until retiring in 2008. During his academic career, David was a Visiting Professor at universities in the United States, Canada, Malta, Sri Lanka and South Africa. Cooper is the former Chair (or President) of the Aristotelian Society, the Mind Association, the Friedrich Nietzsche Society, and the Philosophy of Education Society of Great Britain. He is Secretary and a Trustee of the charity Project Sri Lanka, and he spends time each year visiting and supervising educational and humanitarian projects.

Cooper has published across a broad range of philosophical subjects, including [[philosophy of language]], [[philosophy of education]], [[ethics]], [[aesthetics]], [[environmental philosophy]], [[animal ethics]], [[philosophy of technology]], [[philosophy of religion]], history of both [[Western philosophy]] and [[Asian philosophy]], and modern European philosophy, especially [[Heidegger]], [[Nietzsche]], and [[Wittgenstein]]. In recent years, Cooper has written widely on environmental and Buddhist aesthetics, music and nature, the relationship of beauty and virtue, cultures of food, the significance of gardens, Daoism, our relationship to animals, and the notion of mystery. 

Cooper is the author of a number of books, including ''World Philosophies: An Historical Introduction'', ''Meaning'', ''Existentialism: A Reconstruction'',''The Measure of Things: Humanism, Humility and Mystery'', ''A Philosophy of Gardens'', ''Convergence with Nature: A Daoist Perspective'', ''Senses of Mystery: Engaging with Nature and the Meaning of Life'', and ''Animals and Misanthropy''. He has also edited a number of collections, including ''Blackwell Companion to Aesthetics'', ''Philosophy: The Classic Readings'', ''Epistemology: The Classic Readings'', ''Ethics: The Classic Readings'' and ''Aesthetics: The Classic Readings'' - the latter four notable for their inclusion of material from the Indian and Chinese traditions. He is joint editor of ''Key Thinkers on the Environment''. Cooper is a regular reviewer of books for magazines, including ''The Times Literary Supplement'' and ''The Los Angeles Review of Books''. In 2018 he published his first novel, ''Street Dog: A Sri Lankan Story''.

{{Buddhism}}

In the oldest texts of  [[Buddhism]], '''''Dhyāna''''' ([[Sanskrit]]) or '''''Jhāna''''' ([[Pali]]) is a series of cultivated states of mind, commonly translated as [[Buddhist meditation|meditation]], which lead to a "state of perfect [[Upekkha|equanimity]] and awareness (''upekkhii-sati-piirisuddhl'')."{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=5}} ''Dhyana'' may have been the core practice of [[pre-sectarian Buddhism]], in combination with several related practices which together lead to calm and detachment, and are fully realized with th practice of ''dhyana''.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}{{sfn|Gethin|1992}}

In the later commentarial tradition, which has survived in present-day Theravada, ''dhyana'' is equated with "concentration," a state of one-pointed absorption in which there is a diminished awareness of the surroundings. In the contemporary Theravada-based ''Vipassana''-movement, this absorbed state of mind is regarded as unnecessary and even non-beneficial for awakening, which has to be reached by mindfullness of the body and ''vipassana'' (insight into impermanence). Since the 1980s, scholars and practitioners have started to question this equation, arguing for a more comprehensive and integrated understanding and approach, based on the oldest descriptions of ''dhyana'' in the suttas.

In ''Chan'' and ''Zen'', the Chinese and Japanese renderings of ''dhyana'', ''dhyana'' is the central practice, which is ultimately based on Sarvastivada meditation practices, and has been transmitted since the beginning of the Common Era.

==Etymology==
''Dhayana'' is commonly translated as [[meditation]], and is often equated with "concentration," though meditation may refer to a wider scala of exercises for [[bhavana]], development. ''Dhyana'' can also mean "attention, thought, reflction."&lt;ref&gt;Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit, [http://spokensanskrit.org/index.php?mode=3&amp;script=hk&amp;tran_input=dhyana&amp;direct=au ''dhyana'']&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Buddhaghosa]], the term "jhana" (Skt. dhyana) is derived from the verb ''jhayati'', "to think or meditate," while the verb ''jhapeti'', "to burn up," explicates its function, namely burning-up opposing states, burning-up or destroying "the mental defilements preventing [...] the development of serenity and insight."&lt;ref name="Guna"/&gt;{{refn|group=note|Bronkhorst and Wynne, among others, have discussed the influence of Vedic and Jain thought and practices on Buddhism. The "burning up" of defilements by means of austerities is a typical Jain practice, which was rejected by the Buddha.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=62}}{{sfn|Wynne|2007}}}}

== The ''jhānas''==
The [[Pali Canon|Pāli canon]] describes four progressive states of ''jhāna'' called ''rūpa jhāna'' ("form ''jhana''"),{{refn|group=note|Though ''[[rūpa]]'' may also refer to the body. Arbel (2017) refers to the ''jhana'' as psycho-somatic experiences.}} and four additional meditative states called  ''arūpa'' ("without form").

===Preceding practices===
{{See also|Buddhist meditation|Buddhist paths to liberation}}

Meditation and contemplation are preceded by several practices, which are fully realized with the practice of ''dhyana''.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}}{{sfn|Gethin|1992}} As described in the [[Noble Eightfold Path]], right view leads to leaving the household life and becoming a wandering monk. ''Sila'' (morality) comprises the rules for right conduct. [[Right effort]], c.q. the [[Four Right Exertions|four right efforts]], aim to prevent the arising of unwholesome states, and to generate wholesome states. This includes ''indriya samvara'' (sense restraint), controlling the response to sensual perceptions, not giving in to lust and aversion but simply noticing the objects of perception as they appear.&lt;ref&gt;Analayo, ''Early Buddhist Meditation Studies'', p.69-70, 80&lt;/ref&gt; Right effort and mindfulness calm the mind-body complex, releasing [[Five hindrances|unwholesome states]] and habitual patterns, and encouraging the development of [[seven factors of awakening|wholesome states]] and non-automatic responses.{{sfn|Polak|2011}} By following these cumulative steps and practices, the mind becomes set, almost naturally, for the practice of ''dhyana''.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=XXV}}{{sfn|Polak|2011}}{{refn|group=note|Polak refers to Vetter, who noted that in the suttas right effort leads to a calm state of mind. When this calm and self-restraint had been reached, the Buddha is described as sitting down and attaining the first ''jhana'', in an almost natural way.{{sfn|Polak|2011}}}} The practice of ''dhyana'' reinforces the development of wholesome states, leading to ''[[upekkha]]'' (equanimity) and mindfulness.{{sfn|Polak|2011}}{{sfn|Arbel|2017}}

===The ''rupa jhānas''===

====Qualities of the ''rupa jhānas''====
{{JhanaFactors|expanded=1|nobiblio=1}}

The practice of ''dhyana'' is aided by ''[[anapanasati]]'', mindfulness of breathing. The Suttapitaka and the Agamas describe four stages of  ''rupa jhāna''. ''Rupa'' refers to the material realm, in a neutral stance, as different form the ''kama'' realm (lust, desire) and the ''arupa''-realm (non-material realm).&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Fuller-Sasaki, ''The Record of Lin-Ji''&lt;/ref&gt; Each jhāna is characterised by a set of qualities which are present in that jhana.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}}{{sfn|Bucknell|1993}}{{refn|group=note|See also, among others:&lt;br&gt;* Majjhima Nikaya 26, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.026.than.html ''Ariyapariyesana Sutta, The Noble Search'']&lt;br&gt;* Majjhima Nikaya 111, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.111.than.html ''Anuppada Sutta'']&lt;br&gt;* AN 05.028, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an05/an05.028.than.html ''Samadhanga Sutta: The Factors of Concentration'']}}

* First ''dhyāna'': the first ''dhyana'' can be entered when one is secluded from sensuality and [[Right effort|unskillful qualities]], due to withdrawal and right effort. There is ''[[pīti]]'' ("rapture") and non-sensual ''[[sukha]]'' ("pleasure") as the result of seclusion, while ''[[vitarka-vicara]]'' ("discursive thought") continues;{{refn|group=note|According to Bucknell, while the commentarial tradition explains ''vitarka'' and ''vicara'' as the concentration on an object of meditation, the terms may simply refer to "the normal process of discursive thought."{{sfn|Bucknell|1993|p=375-376}} Bucknell refers to:&lt;br&gt;* Martin Stuart-Fox, "Jhana and Buddhist Scholasticism," Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies 12.2 (1989): 79-110&lt;br&gt;* Paul Griffiths, "Buddhist Jhana: A form-critical study," Religion 13 (1983): 55-68&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Fox, referring to Rhys Davids and Stede, when ''vitarka-vicara'' are mentioned in tandem, they are one expression, "to cover ''all' varieties of thinking, including sustained and focused thought. It is thinking in this inclusive sense that the meditator suppresses through concentration when he attains one-ness of mind and thus moves from first to second ''jhana''."{{sfn|Fox|1989|p=82}}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See also Sujato, [https://sujato.wordpress.com/2012/12/06/why-vitakka-doesnt-mean-thinking-in-jhana/ ''Why vitakka doesn’t mean ‘thinking’ in jhana'']}}
* Second ''dhyana'': there is ''[[pīti]]'' ("rapture") and non-sensual ''[[sukha]]'' ("pleasure") as the result of concentration (''samadhi-ji'', "born of samadhi"{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p. XXVI, note 9}}); ''[[ekaggata]]'' (unification of awareness) free from ''[[vitarka-vicara]]'' ("discursive thought"); ''sampasadana'' ("inner tranquility");{{sfn|Bucknell|1993|p=375-376}}{{refn|group=note|The common translation, based on the commentarial interpretation of ''dhyana'' as expanding states of absorption, translates ''sampasadana'' as "internal assurance." Yet, as Bucknell explains, it also means "tranquilizing," which is more apt in this context.{{sfn|Bucknell|1993|p=375-376}} See also ''[[Passaddhi]]''.}}
* Third ''dhyana'': ''[[upekkhā]]''{{refn|group=note|name="upekkha"}} (equanimous; "affective detachment"{{sfn|Bucknell|1993|p=375-376}}), mindful, and alert, and senses pleasure with the body;
* Fourth ''dhyana'': ''upekkhāsatipārisuddhi''{{refn|group=note|name="upekkha"|''Upekkhā'' is one of the [[Brahmavihara]]s.}} (purity of [[Upekkha|equanimity]] and mindfulness); neither-pleasure-nor-pain. Traditionally, the fourth ''jhāna'' is seen as the beginning of attaining psychic powers (''[[Abhijna|abhijñā]]'').{{source?|date=July 2017}}{{refn|group=note|For instance in [[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 5.28, the Buddha states (Thanissaro, 1997.):&lt;br&gt;"When a monk has developed and pursued the five-factored noble right concentration in this way, then whichever of the six higher knowledges he turns his mind to know and realize, he can witness them for himself whenever there is an opening...."&lt;br&gt;"If he wants, he wields manifold supranormal powers. Having been one he becomes many; having been many he becomes one. He appears. He vanishes. He goes unimpeded through walls, ramparts, and mountains as if through space. He dives in and out of the earth as if it were water. He walks on water without sinking as if it were dry land. Sitting crosslegged he flies through the air like a winged bird. With his hand he touches and strokes even the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful. He exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds. He can witness this for himself whenever there is an opening ..."}}

====Interpretation of the four ''dhyanas''====
While the jhana's are often understood as deepening states of concentration, due to its description as such in the ''Abhidhamma'',{{sfn|Fox|1989|p=83-87}} and the ''Visuddhimagga'',{{sfn|Bucknell|1993|p=375-376}} since the 1980s scholars and modern Theravadins have started to question this understanding. 

Roderick S. Bucknell notes that ''vitarka'' and ''vicara'' may refer to "probably nothing other than the normal process of discursive thought, the familiar but usually unnoticed stream of mental imagery and verbalization." Bucknell further nothes that "[t]hese conclusions conflict with the widespread conception of the first jhana as a state of deep concentration."{{sfn|Bucknell|1993|p=375-376}} 

According to Stuart-Fox, the Abhidhamma separated ''vitarka'' from ''vicara'', and ''ekagatta'' (onepointednes) was added to the description first ''dhyana'' to give an equal number of [[five hindrances]] and five anti-dotes.{{sfn|Fox|1989|p=85-87}} The commentarial tradition regards the qulities of the first ''dhyana'' to be antidotes to the five hindrances, and ''ekagatta'' may have been added to the first ''dhyana'' to give exactly five anti-dotes for the five hindrances.{{sfn|Fox|1989}} Stuart-Fox further notes that ''vitarka'', being discursive thought, will do very little as an anti-dote for sloth and torpor, reflecting the inconsistencies which were introduced by the scholastics.{{sfn|Fox|1989}}

Vetter, Gombrich and Wynne note that the first and second ''jhana'' represent the onset of ''dhyana'' due to withdrawal and [[right effort]] c.q. the [[Four Right Exertions|four right efforts]], followed by concentration, whereas the third and fourth ''jhana'' combine concentration with mindfulness.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=XXVI, note 9}}{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=106; 140, note 58}} Polak, elaborating on Vetter, notes that the onset of the first ''dhyana'' is described as a quite natural process, due to the preceding efforts to restrain the senses and the [[Four Right Exertions|nurturing of wholesome states]].{{sfn|Polak|2011}}{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=XXV}} Regarding ''samadhi'' as the eight step of the [[Noble Eightfold Path]], Vetter notes that ''samadhi'' consists of the four stages of dhyana meditation, but
{{quote|...to put it more accurately, the first dhyana seems to provide, after some time, a state of strong concentration, from which the other stages come forth; the second stage is called samadhija"{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=13}} [...] "born from samadhi."{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=XXVI, note 9}}}}

According to Richard Gombrich, the sequence of the four ''rupa-jhanas'' describes two different cognitive states: "I know this is controversial, but it seems to me that the third and fourth jhanas are thus quite unlike the second."{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=140, note 58}}{{refn|group=note|Original publication: {{Citation | last =Gombrich | first =Richard | year =2007 | title =Religious Experience in Early Buddhism | publisher =OCHS Library | url =http://www.ochs.org.uk/lectures/religious-experience-early-buddhism}}}} Gombrich and Wynne note that, while the second ''jhana'' denotes a state of absorption, in the third and fourth ''jhana'' one comes out of this absorption, being mindfully awareness of objects while being indifferent to it.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=106-107; 140, note 58}}{{refn|group=note|Original publication: {{Citation | last =Gombrich | first =Richard | year =2007 | title =Religious Experience in Early Buddhism | publisher =OCHS Library | url =http://www.ochs.org.uk/lectures/religious-experience-early-buddhism}}}} According to Gombrich, "the later tradition has falsified the jhana by classifying them as the quintessence of the concentrated, calming kind of meditation, ignoring the other – and indeed higher – element.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=140, note 58}}

Gethin, followed by Polak and  Arbel, further notes that there is a "definite affinity" between the four ''jhanas'' and the ''[[Seven Factors of Enlightenment|bojjhaṅgā]]'', the seven factors of awakening.{{sfn|Gethin|1992|p=162-182}}{{sfn|Gethin|2004|p=217, note 26}}{{sfn|Polak|2011|p=25}}{{sfn|Arbel|2017}} According to Gethin, the early Buddhist texts have "a broadly consistent vision" regarding meditation practice. Various practices lead to the development of the factors of awakening, which are not only the means to, but also the constituents of awakening.{{sfn|Gethin|2004|p=217-218}} According to Gethin, ''satipatthana'' and ''anapanasati'' are related to a formula that summarizes the Buddhist path to awakening as "abandoning the hindrances, establishing [...] mindfulness, and developing the seven factors of awakening."{{sfn|gethin|2004|p=203-204}} This results in a "heightened awareness," "overcoming distracting and disturbing emotions,"{{sfn|gethin|2004|p=204}} which are not particular elements of the path to awakening, but rather common disturbing and distracting emotions.{{sfn|Gethin|2004|p=208}} Gethin further states that "the exegetical literature is essentially true to the vision of meditation presented in the Nikayas,"{{sfn|Gethin|2004|p=216}} applying the "perfect mindfulness, stillness and lucidity" of the ''jhanas'' to the contemplation of "reality," of the way things really are,{{sfn|Gethin|2004|p=215}} as temporary and ever-changing.{{sfn|Gethin|2004|p=216}} It is in this sense that  "the ''jhana'' state has the transcendent, transforming quality of awakening."{{sfn|Gethin|2004|p=217}} 

''[[Upekkhā]]'', equanimity, which is perfected in the fourth ''dhyana'', is one of the four ''[[Brahma-vihara]]''. While the commentarial tradition downplayed the importance of the ''Brahma-vihara'', Gombrich notes that the Buddhist usage of the ''brahma-vihāra'' originally referred to an awakened state of mind, and a concrete attitude toward other beings which was equal to "living with Brahman" here and now. The later tradition took those descriptions too literally, linking them to cosmology and understanding them as "living with Brahman" by rebirth in the Brahma-world.{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=84-85}} According to Gombrich, "the Buddha taught that kindness - what Christians tend to call love - was a way to salvation.{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=62}}

Alexander Wynne states that the ''dhyana''-scheme is poorly understood.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=106}} According to Wynne, words expressing the inculcation of awareness, such as ''sati'', ''sampajāno'', and ''upekkhā'', are mistranslated or understood as particular factors of meditative states,{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=106}} whereas they refer to a particular way of perceiving the sense objects:{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=106}}
{{quote|Thus the expression ''sato sampajāno'' in the third ''jhāna'' must denote a state of awareness different from the meditative absorption of the second ''jhāna'' (''cetaso ekodibhāva''). It suggests that the subject is doing something different from remaining in a meditative state, i.e. that he has come out of his absorption and is now once again aware of objects. The same is true of the word ''upek(k)hā'': it does not denote an abstract 'equanimity', [but] it means to be aware of something and indifferent to it [...] The third and fourth ''jhāna-s'', as it seems to me, describe the process of directing states of meditative absorption towards the mindful awareness of objects.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=106-107}}}}

Thanissaro Bhikkhu, a western teacher in the [[Thai Forest Tradition]], argues that the ''Visuddhimagga'' deviates from the Pali Canon in its description of the jhanas, and warns against the development of strong states of concentration.{{sfn|Quli|2008}} Arbel describes the fourth ''jhana'' as "non-reactive and lucid awareness," not as astate of deep concentration.{{sfn|Arbel|2017}}

===The ''arupas''===
{{See also|Formless Realm}}

Grouped into the ''jhana''-scheme are four meditative states, referred to in the early texts as ''aruppas''. These are also referred to in commentarial literature as immaterial/formless ''jhānas'' (''arūpajhānas''), also translated as The Formless Dimensions, in distinction from the first four ''jhānas'' (''rūpa jhānas''). In the Buddhist canonical texts, the word "''jhāna''" is never explicitly used to denote them, they are instead referred to as ''[[āyatana]]''. However, they are sometimes mentioned in sequence after the first four ''jhānas'' (other texts. e.g. MN 121 treat them as a distinct set of attainments) and thus came to be treated by later exegetes as jhānas. The immaterial are related to, or derived from, yogic meditation, while the ''jhanas'' proper are related to the cultivation of the mind. The state of complete dwelling in emptiness is reached when the eighth ''jhāna'' is transcended.

The four ''arupas'' are:
* ''fifth jhāna:'' infinite space (Pali ''ākāsānañcāyatana'', Skt. ''ākāśānantyāyatana''),
* ''sixth jhāna:'' infinite consciousness (Pali ''viññāṇañcāyatana'', Skt. ''vijñānānantyāyatana''),
* ''seventh jhāna:'' infinite nothingness (Pali ''ākiñcaññāyatana'', Skt. ''ākiṃcanyāyatana''),
* ''eighth jhāna:'' neither perception nor non-perception (Pali ''nevasaññānāsaññāyatana'', Skt. ''naivasaṃjñānāsaṃjñāyatana'').

Although the "Dimension of Nothingness" and the "Dimension of Neither Perception nor Non-Perception" are included in the list of nine Jhanas taught by the Buddha, they are not included in the [[Noble Eightfold Path]]. Noble Path number eight is "Samma Samadhi" (Right Concentration), and only the first four Jhanas are considered "Right Concentration". If he takes a disciple through all the Jhanas, the emphasis is on the "Cessation of Feelings and Perceptions" rather than stopping short at the "Dimension of Neither Perception nor Non-Perception".

===Nirodha-Samapatti===
Beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception lies a state called Nirodha Samapatti, the "cessation of perception, feelings and consciousness".&lt;ref name="Anuppada Sutta, MN#111"&gt;Majjhima NIkaya 111, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.111.than.html ''Anuppada Sutta'']&lt;/ref&gt;
Only in commentarial and scholarly literature this sometimes is called the "ninth jhāna".&lt;ref name="Steven Sutcliffe 2004, page 135"&gt;Steven Sutcliffe, ''Religion: Empirical Studies.'' Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2004, page 135.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chandima Wijebandara, ''Early Buddhism, Its Religious and Intellectual Milieu.'' Postgraduate Institute of Pali and Buddhist Studies, University of Kelaniya, 1993, page 22..&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The time of the Buddha saw the rise of the [[śramaṇa]] movement, ascetic practitioners with a body of shared teachings and practices.{{sfn|Samuel|2008}}{{full citation needed|date=March 2015}} The strict delineation of this movement into Jainism, Buddhism and brahmanical/Upanishadic traditions is a later development.{{sfn|Samuel|2008}}{{full citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Invention or incorporation===
According to Bronkhorst, the practice of the four dhyanas may have been an original contribution by Gautama Buddha to the religious practices of ancient India in response to the ascetic practices of the Jains.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=95;122–123}} Kalupahana argues that the Buddha "reverted to the meditational practices" he had learned from [[Alara Kalama|Ārāḍa Kālāma]] and [[Uddaka Ramaputta|Uddaka Rāmaputta]].{{sfn|Kalupahana|1994|p=24}} Wynne argues that Ārāḍa Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmaputta were Brahmanical teachers, and that the attainment of the formless meditative absorption was incorporated from Brahmanical practices.{{sfn|Wynne|2007}}{{Page needed|date=March 2015}} These practices were paired to mindfulness and insight, and given a new interpretation.{{sfn|Wynne|2007}}{{Page needed|date=March 2015}} The stratification of particular ''samādhi'' experiences into the four ''jhānas'' seems to be a Buddhist innovation.{{sfn|Wynne|2007}}{{Page needed|date=March 2015}} It was then borrowed and presented in an incomplete form in the ''Mokṣadharma'', a part of the ''[[Mahabharata|Mahābhārata]]''.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=29}}

[[Thomas William Rhys Davids]] and Maurice Walshe agreed that the term [[samadhi]] is not found in any pre-Buddhist text but is first mentioned in the ''[[Tripiṭaka|Tipiṭaka]]''. It was later incorporated into later texts such as the Maitrayaniya Upanishad.&lt;ref name="Walshe, Maurice 1995"&gt;Walshe, Maurice (trans.) (1995). The Long Discourses of the Buddha: A Translation of the Digha Nikaya. Boston: Wisdom Publications. {{ISBN|0-86171-103-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; But according to Matsumoto, "the terms dhyana and samahita (entering samadhi) appear already in Upanishadic texts that predate the origins of Buddhism".{{sfn|Matsumoto|1997|p=242}}{{refn|group=note|It is important to note that of the 200 or so Upanishads, only the first 10 or 12 are considered the oldest and principal Upanishads. Among these 10 or 12 principal Upanishads, the Taittiriya, Aitareya and Kausitaki show Buddhist influence.{{sfn|King|1995|p=52}} The  Brihadaranyaka, Jaiminiya-Upanisad-Brahmana and the Chandogya Upanishads were composed during the pre-Buddhist era while the rest of these 12 oldest Upanishads are dated to the last few centuries BCE.}}

===Buddhist origins===
The ''[[List of Majjhima Nikaya suttas|Mahasaccaka Sutta]]'', ''Majjhima Nikaya'' 36, narrates the story of the Buddha's awakening. According to this story, he learned two kinds of meditation, which did not lead to enlightenment. He then underwent harsh ascetic practices with which he eventually also became disillusioned. The Buddha then recalled a meditative state he entered by chance as a child:{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}{{Page needed|date=March 2015}}
{{quote|I thought: 'I recall once, when my father the Sakyan was working, and I was sitting in the cool shade of a rose-apple tree, then — quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful mental qualities — I entered &amp; remained in the first jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born from seclusion, accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation. Could that be the path to Awakening?' Then following on that memory came the realization: 'That is the path to Awakening.'{{sfn|Nanamoli|1995}}}}

Originally the practice of dhyana itself may have constituted the core liberating practice of early Buddhism, since in this state all "pleasure and pain" had waned.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}}{{Page needed|date=March 2015}} According to Vetter, 
{{quote|[P]robably the word "immortality" (a-mata) was used by the Buddha for the first interpretation of this experience and not the term cessation of suffering that belongs to the four noble truths [...] the Buddha did not achieve the experience of salvation by discerning the four noble truths and/or other data. But his experience must have been of such a nature that it could bear the interpretation "achieving immortality".{{sfn|vetter|1988|p=5-6}}}}

===Brahmanical influences===
Alexander Wynne attempted to find parallels in Brahmanical texts to the meditative goals the two teachers claimed to have taught, drawing especially on some of the Upanishads and the Mokshadharma chapter of the Mahabharata.{{sfn|Wynne|2007}}

====Uddaka Ramaputta and Alara Kalama====
The suttas describe how the Buddha learned meditative practices from two teachers, Uddaka Ramaputta and Alara Kalama. Alex Wynne argues that Uddaka Ramaputta belonged to the pre-Buddhist tradition portrayed by the Buddhist and Brahmanic sources, in which the philosophical formulations of the early Upanishads were accepted, and the meditative state of "neither perception nor non-perception" was equated with the self.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=44, see also 45–49}} Wynne further argues that the goal of Alara Kalama was a Brahminical concept. Evidence in the ''[[Chandogya Upanishad]]'' and the ''Taittiriya Upanishad'' suggests that a different early Brahminic philosophical tradition held the view that the unmanifest state of Brahman was a form of non-existence.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=196}} According to Wynne it thus seems likely that both element and formless meditation was learned by the Buddha from his two teachers, and adapted by him to his own system.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=50}}{{refn|group=note|According to Bronkhorst, the account of the Buddha practicing under Uddaka Ramaputta and Alara Kalama is entirely fictitious, and meant to flesh out the mentioning of those names in the post-enlightenment narrative in Majjhima Nikaya 36.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}&lt;ref name="Vishvapani" /&gt; According to Bronkhorst, the Buddha's teachings developed primarily in response to Jain teachings, not Brahmanical teachings.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}}}

====Brahmanical practices====

=====Formless spheres=====
It appears that in early Brahminic yoga, the formless spheres were attained following element meditation.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=56}} This is also taught as an option in the early Buddhist texts.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=29-31}} The primary method taught to achieve the formless attainment in early Buddhist scriptures, on the other hand, is to proceed to the sphere of infinite space following the fourth ''jhāna''.&lt;ref&gt;Henepola Gunaratana, ''The Jhanas in Theravada Buddhist Meditation.''

=====Reversal of the creation of the world=====
Wynne claimed that Brahminic passages on meditation suggest that the most basic presupposition of early Brahmanical yoga is that the creation of the world must be reversed, through a series of meditative states, by the yogin who seeks the realization of the [[Atman (Hinduism)|self]].{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=41, 56}} These states were given doctrinal background in early Brahminic cosmologies, which classified the world into successively coarser strata. One such stratification is found at [[Taittiriya Upanishad|TU]] II.1 and [[Mahabharata|Mbh]] XII.195, and proceeds as follows: [[Atman (Hinduism)|self]], space, wind, fire, water, earth. Mbh XII.224 gives alternatively: [[Brahman]], mind, space, wind, fire, water, earth.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=49}}

In Brahmanical thought, the meditative states of consciousness were thought to be identical to the subtle strata of the cosmos.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=42}}{{refn|group=note|See also [[Pratītyasamutpāda#Commentary on Vedic cosmogeny]].}} There is no similar theoretical background to element meditation in the early Buddhist texts, where [[Mahabhuta|the elements]] appear simply as suitable objects of meditation.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=39}} It is likely that the Brahmanic practices of element-meditation were borrowed and adapted by early Buddhists, with the original Brahmanic ideology of the practices being discarded in the process.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=41}}

=====Investigation of self=====
On this point, it is thought that the uses of the elements in early Buddhist literature have in general very little connection to Brahmanical thought; in most places they occur in teachings where they form the objects of a detailed contemplation of the human being. The aim of these contemplations seems to have been to bring about the correct understanding that the various perceived aspects of a human being, when taken together, nevertheless do not comprise a 'self'.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=35}} Moreover, the self is conceptualized in terms similar to both "nothingness"  and "neither perception nor non-perception" at different places in early Upanishadic literature.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=42}}

The latter corresponds to [[Yajnavalkya]]’s definition of the self in his famous dialogue with Maitreyi in the ''[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]]'' and the definition given in the post-Buddhist ''[[Mandukya Upanishad]]''. This is mentioned as a claim of non-Buddhist ascetics and Brahmins in the ''Pañcattaya Sutta'' (Majjhima Nikaya 102.2).&lt;ref&gt;M II.228.16 ff according to the PTS numbering.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=43}} In the same dialogue in the ''Brihadaranyaka Upanishad'', Yajnavalkya draws the conclusions that the self that is neither perceptive nor non-perceptive is a state of consciousness without object. The early Buddhist evidence suggests much the same thing for the state of "neither perception nor non-perception".{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=43}} It is a state without an object of awareness, that is not devoid of awareness.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=44}} The state following it in the Buddhist scheme, the "cessation of perception and sensation", is devoid not only of objectivity, [[Nibbana#Transcendent knowing|but of subjectivity as well]].{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=99}}

====Criticism of Wynne====
The Brahmanical texts cited by Wynne assumed their final form long after the Buddha's lifetime. The Mokshadharma postdates him.&lt;ref name="Vishvapani"&gt;Vishvapani (rev.) (1997).

==Early Buddhism==
{{Main article|Enlightenment in Buddhism|Nirvana}}

The Buddhist tradition has incorporated two traditions regarding the use of jhana.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}{{Page needed|date=March 2015}} There is a tradition that stresses attaining [[Vipassana|insight]] ([[bodhi]], [[Wisdom in Buddhism|prajna]], [[kensho]]) as the means to awakening and liberation.{{refn|group=note|According to the Theravada tradition dhyana must be combined with [[vipassana]],{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=73}} which gives insight into the [[three marks of existence]] and leads to detachment and "the manifestation of the path".{{sfn|King|1992|p=90}}}} But the Buddhist tradition has also incorporated the yogic tradition, as reflected in the use of jhana, which is rejected in other sutras as not resulting in the final result of liberation. One solution to this contradiction is the conjunctive use of [[vipassana]] and [[samatha]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/onetool.html Thanissaro Bhikkhu, ''One Tool Among Many. The Place of Vipassana in Buddhist Practice'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|In [[Zen Buddhism]], this problem has appeared over the centuries in the disputes over [[Subitism|sudden versus gradual enlightenment]].{{sfn|Gregory|1991}}{{Page needed|date=March 2015}}}}

===Five possibilities regarding jhana and liberation===
{{See also|Buddhist paths to awakening|Subitism}}

Schmithausen notes that the mention of the four noble truths as constituting "liberating insight", which is attained after mastering the Rupa Jhanas, is a later addition to texts such as Majjhima Nikaya 36.{{sfn|Schmithausen|1981}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}{{Page needed|date=March 2015}}{{sfn|Vetter|1988}}{{Page needed|date=March 2015}} Schmithausen discerns three possible roads to liberation as described in the suttas, to which Vetter adds a fourth possibility, while the attainment of Nirodha-Samapatti may constitute a fifth possibility:{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxi–xxii}}
# Mastering the four jhanas, where-after "liberating insight" is attained;
# Mastering the four jhanas and the four arupas, where-after "liberating insight" is attained;
# Liberating insight itself suffices;
# The four jhanas themselves constituted the core liberating practice of early Buddhism, c.q. the Buddha;{{sfn|Vetter|1988|xxi-xxxvii}}
# Liberation is attained in Nirodha-Samapatti.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey, ''An Introduction to Buddhism.'' Cambridge University Press, 1990, page 252.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rupa jhana followed by liberating insight====
{{Main article|Vipassana|Sampajañña}}

According to the Theravada-tradition, the meditator uses the ''jhāna'' state to bring the mind to rest, and to strengthen and sharpen the mind, in order to investigate the true nature of phenomena (''dhamma'') and to gain insight into impermanence, suffering and not-self. According to the Theravada-tradition, the arahant is aware that the ''jhanas'' are ultimately unsatisfactory, realizing that the meditative attainments are also [[anicca]], impermanent.&lt;ref name="Katz"&gt;Nathan Katz, ''Buddhist Images of Human Perfection: The Arahant of the Sutta Piṭaka Compared with the Bodhisattva and the Mahāsiddha.'' Motilal Banarsidass, 1990, page 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Mahasaccaka Sutta'' (''Majjhima Nikaya'' 36), which narrates the story of the Buddha's awakening, ''dhyana'' is followed by insight into the four noble truths. The mention of the four noble truths as constituting "liberating insight" is probably a later addition.{{sfn|Schmithausen|1981}}{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=5-6}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}{{Page needed|date=March 2015}} Vetter notes that such insight is not possible in a state of dhyana, when interpreted as concentration, since discursive thinking is eliminated in such a state.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|xxvii}} He also notes that the emphasis on "liberating insight" developed only after the four noble truths were introduced as an expression of what this "liberating insight" constituted.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|xxxi}} In time, other expressions took over this function, such as [[pratītyasamutpāda]] and the emptiness of the self.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=100-101}}

====Rupa jhana and the arupas, followed by liberating insight====
This scheme is rejected by scholars as a later development, since the ''arupas'' are akin to non-Buddhist practices, and rejected alsewhere in the canon.

====Insight alone suffices====
The emphasis on "liberating insight" alone seems to be a later development, in response to developments in Indian religious thought, which saw "liberating insight" as essential to liberation.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=131}}{{sfn|Vetter|1988|xxi-xxxvii}} This may also have been due to an over-literal interpretation by later scholastics of the terminology used by the Buddha,{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=96-134}} and to the problems involved with the practice of ''dhyana'', and the need to develop an easier method.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxxv}}

Contemporary scholars have discerned a broader application of ''jhana'' in historical Buddhist practice. According to Alexander Wynne, the ultimate aim of ''dhyana'' was the attainment of insight,{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=105}} and the application of the meditative state to the practice of mindfulness.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=105}} According to Frauwallner, mindfulness was a means to prevent the arising of craving, which resulted simply from contact between the senses and their objects. According to Frauwallner, this may have been the Buddha's original idea.{{sfn|Williams|2000|p=45}} According to Wynne, this stress on mindfulness may have led to the intellectualism which favoured insight over the practice of ''dhyana''.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=106}}

====Jhana itself is liberating====
Both Schmithausen and Bronkhorst note that the attainment of insight, which is a cognitive activity, can't be possible in a state wherein all cognitive acitivy has ceased.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}} According to Vetter, the practice of Rupa Jhana itself may have constituted the core practice of early Buddhism, with practices such as sila and mindfulness aiding to its development.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|xxi-xxxvii}} It is the "middle way" between self-mortification, ascribed by Bronkhorst to Jainism,{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}} and indulgence in sensual pleasure.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxviii}} Vetter emphasizes that dhyana is a form of non-sensual happiness.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|xxix}} The eightfold path can be seen as a path of preparation which leads to the practice of samadhi.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|xxx}}

====Liberation in Nirodha-Samapatti====
According to some texts, after progressing through the eight jhanas ''and'' the stage of Nirodha-Samapatti, a person is liberated.&lt;ref name="Anuppada Sutta, MN#111"/&gt; According to some traditions someone attaining the state of Nirodha-Samapatti is an ''[[anagami]]'' or an ''[[arahant]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey, ''An Introduction to Buddhism.'' Cambridge University Press, 1990, page 252.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Anupadda sutra, the Buddha narrates that [[Sariputta]] became an arahant upon reaching it.&lt;ref&gt;Thanissaro Bhikkhu's commentary on the [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.111.than.html Anuppada Sutta, MN#111]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theravada==

===''Dhyana'' as concentration===
Buddhagosa's ''Visuddhimagga'' considers ''jhana'' to be an exercise in concentration-meditation. His views, together with the ''Satipatthana Sutta'', inspired the development, in the 19th and 20th century, of new meditation techniques which gained a great popularity among lay audiences in the second half of the 20th century.{{sfn|Rose|2016|p=60-61}}{{refn|group=note|See also Mark David Chapman, [https://vividness.live/2011/07/07/theravada-reinvents-meditation/ ''Thervada reinvents meditation'']}}

====''Samadhi''====
According to [[Henepola Gunaratana]], the term "jhana" is closely connected with "samadhi", which is generally rendered as "concentration". The word "samadhi" is almost interchangeable with the word "samatha", serenity.&lt;ref name="Guna"&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/gunaratana/wheel351.html#ch1.3 Henepola Gunaratana, ''The Jhanas in Theravada Buddhist Meditation'']&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gunaratana, in the widest sense the word samadhi is being used for the practices which lead to the development of serenity. In this sense, samadhi and jhana are close in meaning.{{refn|group=note|Gunarathana refers to [[Buddhaghosa]], who explains samadhi etymologically as "the centering of consciousness and consciousness concomitants evenly and rightly on a single object [...] the state in virtue of which consciousness and its concomitants remain evenly and rightly on a single object, undistracted and unscattered (Vism.84–85; PP.85)."&lt;ref name="Guna" /&gt;}} Nevertheless, they are not exactly identical, since "certain differences in their suggested and contextual meanings prevent unqualified identification of the two terms." Samadhi signifies only one mental factor, namely one-pointedness, while the word "jhana" encompasses the whole state of consciousness, "or at least the whole group of mental factors individuating that meditative state as a jhana."&lt;ref name="Guna" /&gt; Furthermore, according to Gunaratana, samadhi involves "a wider range of reference than jhana," noting that "the Pali exegetical tradition recognizes three levels of samadhi: preliminary concentration (''parikammasamadhi'') [...] access concentration (''upacarasamadhi'') [...] and absorption concentration (''appanasamadhi'')."&lt;ref name="Guna" /&gt;

====Development and application of concentration====
According to the [[Pali Canon|Pāli canon]] commentary, access/neighbourhood concentration (''upacāra-samādhi'') is a stage of meditation that the meditator reaches before entering into ''jhāna''. The overcoming of the [[Five Hindrances|five hindrances]]{{refn|group=note|Sensual desire, ill will, sloth and torpor, restlessness and worry and doubt}} mark the entry into access concentration.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Access concentration is not mentioned in the discourses of the Buddha, but there are several ''suttas'' where a person gains insight into the ''Dhamma'' on hearing a teaching from the Buddha.{{refn|group=note|According to Peter Harvey, access concentration is described at ''Digha Nikaya'' I, 110, among other places: "The situation at D I, 110, then, can be seen as one where the hearer of a discourse enters a state which, while not an actual jhana, could be bordering on it. As it is free from hindrances, it could be seen as 'access' concentration with a degree of wisdom." Peter Harvey, ''Consciousness Mysticism in the Discourses of the Buddha.'' In Karel Werner, ed., ''The Yogi and the Mystic.'' Curzon Press 1989, page 95. See also: Peter Harvey, ''The Selfless Mind,'' page 170.}}{{refn|group=note|The equivalent of ''upacāra-samādhi'' used in Tibetan commentaries is ''nyer-bsdogs''.&lt;ref&gt;B. Alan Wallace, ''The bridge of quiescence: experiencing Tibetan Buddhist meditation.'' Carus Publishing Company, 1998, page 92. Wallace translates both as "the first proximate meditative stabilization".&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Tse-fu Kuan, at the state of ''access concentration'', some meditators may experience vivid mental imagery,{{refn|group=note|Pāli: ''nimitta''}} which is similar to a vivid dream. They are as vivid as if seen by the eye, but in this case the meditator is fully aware and conscious that they are seeing mental images. According to Tse-fu Kuan, this is discussed in the early texts, and expanded upon in Theravāda commentaries.&lt;ref&gt;Tse-fu Kuan, ''Mindfulness in Early Buddhism: New Approaches Through Psychology and Textual Analysis of Pali, Chinese and Sanskrit Sources.'' Routledge, 2008, pages 65–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Venerable Sujivo, as the concentration becomes stronger, the feelings of breathing and of having a physical body will completely disappear, leaving only pure awareness. At this stage inexperienced meditators may become afraid, thinking that they are going to die if they continue the concentration, because the feeling of breathing and the feeling of having a physical body has completely disappeared. They should not be so afraid and should continue their concentration in order to reach "full concentration" (''jhāna'').&lt;ref&gt;Venerable Sujivo, ''Access and Fixed Concentration''. Vipassana Tribune, Vol 4 No 2, July 1996, Buddhist Wisdom Centre, Malaysia. Available [http://www.buddhanet.net/budsas/ebud/ebmed020.htm here].&lt;/ref&gt;

A meditator should first master the lower ''jhānas'', before they can go into the higher ''jhānas''. According to Nathan Katz, the early suttas state that "the most exquisite of recluses" is able to attain any of the ''jhānas'' and abide in them without difficulty.&lt;ref name="Katz"/&gt;{{refn|group=note|According to [[Sujiva]], there are five aspects of ''jhāna'' mastery:&lt;ref&gt;Sujiva, [http://www.buddhanet.net/mettaf3.htm ''Mastering an Absorption ''], Buddhanet&lt;/ref&gt;
# Mastery in adverting: the ability to advert{{Clarify|date=March 2010}} to the ''jhāna'' factors one by one after emerging from the ''jhāna'', wherever desired, whenever she/ he wants, and for as long as one wants.
# Mastery in attaining: the ability to enter upon ''jhāna'' quickly.
# Mastery in resolving: the ability to remain in the ''jhāna'' for exactly the pre-determined length of time.
# Mastery in emerging: the ability to emerge from ''jhāna'' quickly without difficulty.
# Mastery in reviewing: the ability to review the ''jhāna'' and its factors with retrospective knowledge immediately after adverting to them.}}

According to the contemporary Vipassana-movement, the ''jhāna'' state cannot by itself lead to enlightenment as it only suppresses the defilements. Meditators must use the ''jhāna'' state as an instrument for developing wisdom by cultivating insight, and use it to penetrate the true nature of phenomena through direct cognition, which will lead to cutting off the defilements and ''[[nibbana]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

According to the later Theravāda commentorial tradition as outlined by Buddhagoṣa in his ''[[Visuddhimagga]]'', after coming out of the state of ''jhāna'' the meditator will be in the state of post-''jhāna'' access concentration. In this state the investigation and analysis of the true nature of phenomena begins, which leads to insight into the characteristics of impermanence, suffering and not-self arises.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Contemporary reassessment - the "Jhana wars"===
While Theravada-meditation was introduced to the west as ''vipassana''-meditation, which rejected the usefulness of ''jhana'', there is a growing interest among western ''vipassana''-practitioners in ''jhana''.{{sfn|Quli|2008}}{{sfn|Rose|2016|p=61}} The nature and practice of ''jhana'' is a topic of debate and contentment among western convert Theravadins, to the extent that the disputes have even been called "the Jhana wars."{{sfn|Rose|2016|p=60}}{{refn|group=note|See also:&lt;br&gt;* Leigh Brasington, [http://www.leighb.com/jhanantp.htm ''Interpretations of the Jhanas'']&lt;br&gt;* Simple&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;Sutta, [https://simplesuttas.wordpress.com/2013/05/09/jhana-wars-pt-1-what-the-heck-is-jhana-a-first-pass/ ''Jhana Wars!'']&lt;br&gt;* Dhamma Wheel, ''The great Jhana debate''&lt;ref&gt;[https://dhammawheel.com/viewtopic.php?f=43&amp;t=4597&amp;sid=4349d25a4379c3849c5b6ba90cb5b4f3 ''The great Jhana debate''&lt;/ref&gt;}} Both academic scholars and contemporary practitioners have raised questions about the interpretation of the ''jhanas'' as being states of absorption which are not necessary for the attainment of liberation. While groundbreaking research on this topic has been done by Bareau, Schmithausen, Stuart-Fox, Bucknell, Vetter, Bronkhorst, and Wynne, Theravada practitioners have also scrutinized and criticised the ''samatha''-''vipassana'' distinction.&lt;ref&gt;Buddhadasa; Bhikkhu Tanissaro; Arbel 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Reassessments of the description of ''jhana'' in the suttas consider ''jhana'' and ''vipassana'' to be an integrated practice, leading to a "tranquil and eqaunimous awareness of whatever arises in the field of experience."{{sfn|Rose|2016|p=60}}{{sfn|Shankman|2008}}{{sfn|Polak|2011}}{{sfn|Arbel|2017}}

====Criticism of ''Visudhimagga''====
The ''Visuddhimagga'', and the "pioneering popularizing work of Daniel Goleman,"{{sfn|Rose|2016|p=61}}{{refn|group=note|See Golman's ''The Varieties of Medittaive Experience'', published early 1970s, which praises the ''Visuddhimagga'' as a masterguide for thepractice of meditation.}} has been influential in the (mis)understanding of ''dhyana'' being a form of concentration-meditation. The ''Visuddhimagga'' is centered around ''[[kasina]]''-meditation, a form of concentration-meditation in which the mind is focused on a (mental) object.&lt;ref name="Thanissaro"&gt;Bhikkhu Thanissaro, [http://www.dhammatalks.net/Books/Bhikkhu_Thanissaro_Jhanas_Concentration_Wisdom.htm ''Concentration and Discernment'']&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]], "[t]he text then tries to fit all other meditation methods into the mold of kasina practice, so that they too give rise to countersigns, but even by its own admission, breath meditation does not fit well into the mold."&lt;ref name="Thanissaro"/&gt;  According to [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]], "the Visuddhimagga uses a very different paradigm for concentration from what you find in the Canon."{{sfn|Shankman|2008|p=117}}  In its emphasis on ''kasina''-meditation, the ''Visuddhimagga'' departs from the Pali Canon, in which ''[[Dhyana in Buddhism|dhyana]]'' is the central meditative practice, indicating that what "jhana means in the commentaries is something quite different from what it means in the Canon."&lt;ref name="Thanissaro"/&gt;

[[Bhante Henepola Gunaratana]] also notes that what "the suttas say is not the same as what the Visuddhimagga says [...] they are actually different," leading to a divergence between a [traditional] scholarly understanding and a practical understanding based on meditative experience.{{sfn|Shankman|2008|p=136}} Gunaratana further notes that Buddhaghosa invented several key meditation terms which are not to be found in the suttas, such as "''parikamma samadhi'' (preparatory concentration), ''upacara samadhi'' (access concentration), ''appanasamadhi'' (absorption concentration)."{{sfn|Shankman|2008|p=137}} Gunaratana also notes that the Buddhaghosa's emphasis on ''kasina''-meditation is not to be found in the suttas, where ''dhyana'' is always combined with mindfulness.{{sfn|Shankman|2008|p=137-138}}{{refn|group=note|See also Bronkhorst (1993), ''Two Traditions of Meditation in ancient India''; Wynne (2007), ''The Origin of Buddhist Meditation''; and Polak (2011), ''Reexaming Jhana''}}

According to Vetter, ''dhyana'' as a preparation of [[Vipassana|discriminating insight]] must have been different from the ''dhyana''-practice introduced by the Buddha, using [[kasina]]-exercises to produce a "more artificially produced dhyana", resulting in the cessation of apperceptions and feelings.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxxvi}} Kasina-exercises are propagated in [[Buddhaghosa]]s ''[[Visuddhimagga]]'', which is considered the authoritative commentary on meditation practice in the Theravada tradition, but differs from the Pali canon in its description of ''jhana''. While the suttas connect ''samadhi'' to mindfulness and awareness of the body, for Buddhaghosa ''jhana'' is a purely mental exercise, in which one-pointed concentration leads to a narrowing of attention.{{sfn|Shankman|2008|p=80}}

====''Jhana'' as integrated practice====
Several western teachers (Thanissaro Bhikkhu, Leigh Brazington, Richard Shankman) make a distinction between 'sutta-oriented' ''jhana'  and '''Visuddhimagga''-oriented' ''jhana,{{sfn|Quli|2008}}{{sfn|Rose|2016|p=59}} dubbed "minimalists" and "maximalists" by Kenneth Rose.{{sfn|Rose|2016|p=59}}

Thanissaro Bhikkhu has repeatedly argued that the Pali Canon and the ''Visuddhimagga'' give different descriptions of the jhanas, regarding the ''Visuddhimagga''-description to be incorrect.{{sfn|Quli|2008}} 

According to Richard Shankman, the ''sutta'' descriptions of ''jhāna'' practice explain that the meditator does not emerge from ''jhāna'' to practice ''vipassana'' but rather the work of insight is done whilst in ''jhāna'' itself. In particular the meditator is instructed to "enter and remain in the fourth ''jhāna''" before commencing the work of insight in order to uproot the mental defilements.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Richard Shankman, ''The Experience of Samadhi – an in depth Exploration of Buddhist Meditation'', Shambala publications 2008&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|''Samaññaphala Sutta'': "With the abandoning of pleasure and pain — as with the earlier disappearance of elation and distress — he enters and remains in the fourth ''jhāna'': purity of equanimity and mindfulness, neither-pleasure nor pain...With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, the monk directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentations. He discerns, as it has come to be, that 'This is suffering... This is the origination of suffering... This is the cessation of suffering... This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering... These are mental fermentations... This is the origination of fermentations... This is the cessation of fermentations... This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.039.than.html|title=Samaññaphala Sutta}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Keren Arbel has conducted extensive research on the ''jhanas'' and the contemporary criticisms of the commentarial interpretation. Based on this research, and her own experience as a senior meditation-teacher, she gives a reconstructed account of the original meaning of the ''dhyanas''. She argues that ''jhana'' is an integrated practice, describing the fourth ''jhana'' as "non-reactive and lucid awareness," not as a state of deep concentration.{{sfn|Arbel|2017}} According to Arbel, it develops "a mind which is not conditioned by habitual reaction-patterns of likes and dislikes [...] a profoundly wise relation to experience, not tainted by any kind of wrong perception and mental reactivity rooted in craving (''tanha'').{{sfn|Arbel|2017|p=16}}

According to Kenneth Rose, the ''Visuddhimagga''-oriented "maximalist" approach is a return to ancient Indian "mainstream practices," in which physical and mental immobility was thought to lead to liberation from ''samsara'' and rebirth. This approach was rejected by the Buddha, turning to a gentler approach which results in ''upekkha'' and ''sati'', equanimous awareness of experience.{{sfn|Rose|2016|p=60}}

==In Mahāyāna traditions==
[[File:Gandhara, bodhisattva assiso, II sec..JPG|thumb|[[Bodhisattva]] seated in meditation. [[Afghanistan]], 2nd century CE]]

Mahāyāna Buddhism includes numerous schools of practice. Each draw upon various Buddhist sūtras, philosophical treatises, and commentaries, and each has its own emphasis, mode of expression, and philosophical outlook. Accordingly, each school has its own meditation methods for the purpose of developing samādhi and [[Wisdom in Buddhism|prajñā]], with the goal of ultimately attaining enlightenment.

===Chan Buddhism===

Dhyāna is a central aspect of Buddhist practice in Chan, necessary for progress on the path and "true entry into the Dharma."{{refn|group=note|Dhyāna is a central aspect of Buddhist practice in Chan:&lt;br&gt;* [[Nan Huai-Chin]]: "Intellectual reasoning is just another spinning of the [[Eight Consciousnesses|sixth consciousness]], whereas the practice of meditation is the true entry into the Dharma."&lt;ref&gt;Nan, Huai-Chin.

====Origins====
In China, the word ''dhyāna'' was originally transliterated with {{zh|t=禪那|p=chánnà}} and shortened to just {{zh|p=chán}} in common usage. The word and the practice of meditation entered into Chinese through the translations of [[An Shigao]] (fl. c. 148–180 CE), and [[Kumārajīva]] (334–413 CE), who translated [[Dhyāna sutras]], which were influential early meditation texts mostly based on the [[Yogacara]] meditation teachings of the [[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivāda]] school of [[Kashmir]] circa 1st-4th centuries CE.&lt;ref name=Deleanu&gt;Deleanu, Florin (1992); [https://ahandfulofleaves.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/mindfulness-of-breathing-in-the-dhayana-sutra_florin-deleanu_1992.pdf Mindfulness of Breathing in the Dhyāna Sūtras]. Transactions of the International Conference of Orientalists in Japan (TICOJ) 37, 42-57.&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''chán'' became the designation for [[Chan Buddhism]] ([[Korean Seon]], [[Zen]]).

While ''dhyana'' in a strict sense refers to the four ''dhyanas'', in Chinese Buddhism ''dhyāna'' may refer to [[Kammaṭṭhāna|various kinds of meditation techniques]] and their preparatory practices, which are necessary to practice ''dhyana''.{{sfn|Fischer-Schreiber|2008|p=103}} The five main types of meditation in the ''Dyana sutras'' are [[anapanasati]] (mindfulness of breathing); [[patikulamanasikara|paṭikūlamanasikāra]] meditation, mindfulness of the impurities of the body; loving-kindness [[mettā|maitrī]] meditation; the contemplation on the twelve links of [[pratītyasamutpāda]]; and the contemplation on the [[Physical characteristics of the Buddha#The 32 Signs of a Great Man|Buddha’s thirty-two Characteristics]].&lt;ref name=Yuanci&gt;Ven.

====Mindfulness====

=====Observing the breath=====
[[File:Hsuan Hua Hong Kong 1.jpeg|thumb|right|upright|Venerable [[Hsuan Hua]] meditating in the Lotus Position. [[Hong Kong]], 1953.]]

During sitting meditation, practitioners usually assume a position such as the [[lotus position]], half-lotus, Burmese, or [[yoga]] postures, using the [[Mudra#Dhy.C4.81na Mudr.C4.81|dhyāna]] [[mudra|mudrā]]. To regulate the mind, awareness is directed towards counting or watching the breath or by bringing that awareness to the energy center below the navel (see also [[ānāpānasati]]).&lt;ref name="shengyen"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fundamentals of Meditation|last=Sheng|first=Yen|url=http://www.chancenter.org/chanctr/ddp/talks/zuochan.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, a square or round cushion placed on a padded mat is used to sit on; in some other cases, a chair may be used. This practice may simply be called [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|sitting dhyāna]], which is ''zuòchán'' (坐禅) in Chinese, and ''[[zazen]]'' (坐禅) in Japanese, ''jwaseon'' (坐禅) in Korean.

=====Observing the mind=====
In the Sōtō school of Zen, meditation with no objects, anchors, or content, is the primary form of practice. The meditator strives to be aware of the stream of thoughts, allowing them to arise and pass away without interference. Considerable textual, philosophical, and phenomenological justification of this practice can be found throughout [[Dōgen]]'s ''Shōbōgenzō'', as for example in the "Principles of Zazen"&lt;ref name="zazengi"&gt;{{cite web|title=Zazengi translation|url=http://web.stanford.edu/group/scbs/sztp3/translations/shobogenzo/translations/zazengi/zazengi.html|author=Sōtō Zen Text Project|publisher=[[Stanford University]]|accessdate=15 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117022108/http://web.stanford.edu/group/scbs/sztp3/translations/shobogenzo/translations/zazengi/zazengi.html|archive-date=17 November 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Universally Recommended Instructions for Zazen".&lt;ref name="fukanzazengi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/scbs/sztp3/translations/gongyo_seiten/translations/part_3/fukan_zazengi.html|title=Fukan Zazengi|author=Sōtō Zen Text Project|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=2008-03-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429201213/http://www.stanford.edu/group/scbs/sztp3/translations/gongyo_seiten/translations/part_3/fukan_zazengi.html|archivedate=2008-04-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Japanese language, this practice is called ''[[Shikantaza]]''.

====Insight====

=====Pointing to the nature of the mind=====
According to Charles Luk, in the earliest traditions of Chán, there was no fixed method or formula for teaching meditation, and all instructions were simply heuristic methods, to point to the true nature of the mind, also known as ''[[Buddha-nature]]''.&lt;ref name="Luk"/&gt; According to Luk, this method is referred to as the "Mind Dharma", and exemplified in the story of Śākyamuni Buddha holding up a flower silently, and [[Mahākāśyapa]] smiling as he understood.&lt;ref name="Luk"&gt;Luk, Charles. ''The Secrets of Chinese Meditation.'' 1964. p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; A traditional formula of this is, "Chán points directly to the human mind, to enable people to see their true nature and become buddhas."&lt;ref&gt;Nan, Huai-Chin. ''Basic Buddhism: Exploring Buddhism and Zen.'' 1997. p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Kōan practice=====
{{Main article|Kōan}}
[[File:Wu (negative).svg|thumb|right|upright|[[Chinese characters|Chinese character]] for "[[Mu (negative)|nothing]]" ({{CJKV|p=wú|r=mu|rr=mu}}). It figures in the famous ''Zhaozhou's dog'' [[kōan]]]]

At the beginning of the [[Sòng dynasty]], practice with the kōan method became popular, whereas others practiced "silent illumination."{{sfn|Blyth|1966}} This became the source of some differences in practice between the [[Linji school|Línjì]] and [[Cáodòng school]]s.

A kōan, literally "public case", is a story or dialogue, describing an interaction between a Zen master and a student. These anecdotes give a demonstration of the master's insight. Koans emphasize the non-conceptional insight that the Buddhist teachings are pointing to. Koans can be used to provoke the "great doubt", and test a student's progress in Zen practice.

Kōan-inquiry may be practiced during zazen (sitting meditation), [[kinhin]] (walking meditation), and throughout all the activities of daily life. Kōan practice is particularly emphasized by the Japanese [[Rinzai school]], but it also occurs in other schools or branches of Zen depending on the teaching line.{{sfn|Loori|2006}}

The Zen student's mastery of a given kōan is presented to the teacher in a private interview (referred to in Japanese as ''dokusan'' (独参), ''daisan'' (代参), or ''sanzen'' (参禅)). While there is no unique answer to a kōan, practitioners are expected to demonstrate their understanding of the kōan and of Zen through their responses. The teacher may approve or disapprove of the answer and guide the student in the right direction. The interaction with a Zen teacher is central in Zen, but makes Zen practice also vulnerable to misunderstanding and exploitation.{{sfn|Lachs|2006}}

===Vajrayāna===
[[B. Alan Wallace]] holds that modern Tibetan Buddhism lacks emphasis on achieving levels of concentration higher than access concentration.&lt;ref name="B. Alan Wallace 1998, pages 215-216"&gt;B. Alan Wallace, ''The bridge of quiescence: experiencing Tibetan Buddhist meditation.'' Carus Publishing Company, 1998, pages 215–216.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Study and Practice of Meditation: Tibetan Interpretations of the Concentrations and Formless Absorptions'' by Leah Zahler. Snow Lion Publications: 2009 pg 264-5&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wallace, one possible explanation for this situation is that virtually all Tibetan Buddhist meditators seek to become enlightened through the use of [[Tantra techniques (Vajrayana)|tantric practices]]. These require the presence of sense desire and passion in one's consciousness, but ''jhāna'' effectively inhibits these phenomena.&lt;ref name="B. Alan Wallace 1998, pages 215-216"/&gt;

While few Tibetan Buddhists, either inside or outside Tibet, devote themselves to the practice of concentration, Tibetan Buddhist literature does provide extensive instructions on it, and great Tibetan meditators of earlier times stressed its importance.&lt;ref&gt;B. Alan Wallace, ''The Attention Revolution: Unlocking the Power of the Focused Mind''. Wisdom Publications, 2006, page xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dhyana is an important ancient practice mentioned in the Vedic and post-Vedic literature of Hinduism, as well as early texts of Jainism.&lt;ref name=Bronkhorst1993ii/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Constance Jones|author2=James D.

===Parallels with Patanjali's Ashtanga Yoga===
{{See also|Yoga Sutras of Patanjali#Buddhism|l1=Yoga Sutras of Patanjali}}

There are parallels with the fourth to eighth stages of [[Patanjali|Patanjali's]] [[Raja Yoga|Ashtanga Yoga]], as mentioned in his classical work, ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]]'', which were compiled around 400 CE by, taking materials about yoga from older traditions.{{sfn|Wujastyk|2011|p=33}}{{sfn|Feuerstein|1978|p=108}}{{sfn|Tola|Dragonetti|Prithipaul|1987|p=x}}

Patanjali discerns ''bahiranga'' (external) aspects of yoga namely, [[yamas|yama]], [[niyama]], [[asana]], [[pranayama]], and the ''antaranga'' (internal) yoga. Having actualized the ''pratyahara'' stage, a practitioner is able to effectively engage into the practice of [[Samyama]]. At the stage of ''pratyahara'', the consciousness of the individual is internalized in order that the sensations from the [[senses]] of taste, touch, sight, hearing and smell don't reach their respective centers in the brain and takes the ''[[sadhaka]]'' (practitioner) to next stages of [[Yoga]], namely [[Dharana]] (concentration), [[Dhyana in Hinduism|Dhyana]] (meditation), and [[Samādhi (Buddhism)|Samadhi]] (mystical absorption), being the aim of all [[Yogic]] practices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.himalayaninstitute.org/Yogaplus/Article.aspx?id=934 Moving Inward: The Journey from Asana to Pratyahara] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719232925/http://www.himalayaninstitute.org/Yogaplus/Article.aspx?id=934 |date=July 19, 2011 }} ''[[Himalayan Institute of Yoga Science and Philosophy]]''. &lt;/ref&gt;

The Eight Limbs of the yoga sutras show Samadhi as one of its limbs. The ''Eight limbs of the Yoga Sutra'' was influenced by Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Karel Werner, ''The Yogi and the Mystic.'' Routledge 1994, page 27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Thurman, "The Central Philosophy of Tibet.'' Princeton University Press, 1984, page 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Vyasa's Yogabhashya, the commentary to the Yogasutras, and Vacaspati Misra's subcommentary state directly that the samadhi techniques are directly borrowed from the Buddhists' [[Jhana]], with the addition of the mystical and divine interpretations of mental absorption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woods|first=James Haughton, trans.|title=The Yoga System of Patanjali with commentary Yogabhashya attributed to Veda Vyasa and Tattva Vaicharadi by Vacaspati Misra|year=1914|publisher=Cambridge: Harvard University Press|url=https://archive.org/details/yogasystempataj00vcgoog}}{{Page needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=March 2015}} However, it is also to be noted that the Yoga Sutra, especially the fourth segment of Kaivalya Pada, contains several polemical verses critical of Buddhism, particularly the Vijñānavāda school of Vasubandhu.&lt;ref&gt;An outline of the religious literature of India, By John Nicol Farquhar p.132&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific studies==
There has been little scientific study of these mental states. In 2008, an [[EEG]] study found "strong, significant, and consistent differences in specific brain regions when the meditator is in a jhana state compared to normal resting consciousness".&lt;ref name="Michael R. Hagerty 2008"&gt;Hagerty et al 2008, "EEG Power and Coherence Analysis of an Expert Meditator in the Eight Jhanas" [http://www.leighb.com/EEG%20Power%20and%20Coherence%20Analysis%20of%20an%20Expert%20Meditator%20in%208%20JhanasV5.doc]&lt;/ref&gt; Tentative hypotheses on the neurological correlates have been proposed, but lack supporting evidence.&lt;ref name="Leigh Brasington 2010"&gt;Leigh Brasington 2010 "The Neurological Correlates of the Jhanas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4077">'''Entitativity''' means the consideration of something as pure [[entity]], i.e., the mental [[abstraction]] from attendant circumstances.

In [[psychology]], it typically refers to ''the perception of a group as pure entity'' (an [[entitative]] group), abstracted from its attendant [[individual]]s. It is different{{how|date=May 2016}} from [[Holism|holistic]] [[perception]]. Operationally, entitativity can also be defined as ''perceiving a collection of social targets (e.g., individuals) as possessing unity and coherence (e.g., a group)''. Entitativity is highest for [[intimacy group]]s, such as the family, lower for [[action group (sociology)|task group]]s, lower yet for social categories (e.g., people of the same religion), and lowest for transitory groups, such as people waiting at the same bus stop (Lickel et al., 2000).

Campbell (1958) coined the term ''entitativity'' in order to explain why some groups are considered real groups while others are thought to be mere aggregates of individuals. He suggested that people rely on certain perceptual cues as they intuitively determine which aggregations of individuals are groups, and which are not (e.g. Spectators at a football game may seem like a disorganized collection of people, but when they shout the same cheers or express similar emotions, this gives them entitativity)(Forsyth, 2010). 

Additionally, Campbell (1958) emphasized three cues that individuals can use to make judgments regarding entitativity: ''common fate'' (the extent to which individuals in the aggregate seem to experience interrelated outcomes), ''similarity'' (the extent to which the individuals display the same behaviors or resemble one another), and ''proximity'' (the distance between individuals in the aggregate). To illustrate how we make those judgments, consider the example of people sharing a table at a library. They could be friends who are studying together, or they may also be strangers happening to share the same table. If you're wondering whether this is an actual group, you would examine their common fate, similarity, and proximity. Common fate may be something like the group all getting up and leaving together while talking or laughing amongst themselves. Similarity could be as simple as noticing that they are all using the same textbooks or notes, or that they happen to be wearing the same t-shirts to organizations (i.e., fraternity, university group). Finally, their physical proximity to one another (i.e., moving to sit closer) would be the final characteristic to judge that you are witnessing individuals with entitativity (Forsyth, 2010). 

There are two proposed antecedents for the entitativity perception ([https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=2006+Ip+Chiu+Wan&amp;btnG=Search Ip, Chiu, &amp; Wan, 2006]):
*physical similarity
*goal/behavior similarity.

'''Fairness dilemmas''' arise when groups are faced with making decisions about how to share their resources, rewards, or payoffs. Since resources are limited, groups need to decide on fair ways of apportioning them out to their members. These fairness judgments are determined by procedural and distributive forms of social justice. When payouts do not occur according to these norms, conflicts arise.

==Procedural justice==
'''Procedural justice''' deals with the methods used in making the decisions about the allocation of the group's resources. Issues arise in this area when groups do not stick to their agreed upon methods for spreading out these resources. Conflicts will arise when the methods used are not consistent, open, or agreed upon by the group. The question asked by group members in this type of social justice is "did we make the decision in a fair way?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=van den Bos |author2=Wilke |author3=Lind |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distributive justice==
'''Distributive justice''' deals with how rewards and costs are distributed across the members of the group. Issues might arise in this area when certain members are favored and consistently given premium rewards or apportioned more resources than other members. An analogy here is cutting up a cake into equal pieces, but someone feels that they have unjustly received a smaller piece. The question asked by group members in this type of social justice is "did I get my fair share?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forsyth|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distributive norms==
There are five types of distributive norms that help in maintaining distributive justice.
* '''Equity''': this is where members' outcomes are based on their inputs to the group effort. Someone who has given more time, money, energy, risk, or other input, should receive more than someone who has contributed less.
* '''Equality''': here, all group members receive an equal share of the profit, regardless of their amount of input.
* '''Power''': the individuals with higher status, authority, or control receive more in this circumstance. This is akin to managers having a higher salary than lower ranking members of a team of researchers.
* '''Need''': with this norm, people in the group with the greatest needs are provided with the necessary amount of resources required to meet those needs.
* '''Responsibility''': essentially, this is where those who have more share with those who have less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forsyth|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences of fairness dilemmas==
The distribution of resources (most often money) is a very common cause of conflict in groups. Individuals tend to push for equality distribution norms when they have not contributed as much to the group. Smaller groups also tend to adopt equality norms, as do women. On the other hand, larger groups, as well as groups that significantly depend on one person's specialized input, prefer equitable distributions for the group.
'''Negative inequity''' is experienced by group members who feel that they are not receiving fair payment for what they have contributed. This often results in lower quality of work, a reduction in effort (perhaps caused by the [[Social loafing#"Sucker" effect/Aversion|sucker effect]]), or complete withdrawal from the group. In contrast, '''positive inequality''' is experienced when members receive too much for the amount of effort they've put forth. This can lead to the individual increasing their efforts to actually deserve what they are receiving, but more often it leads to conflict in the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fortin|author2=Fellenz|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Individuals tend to be motivated to maximize their personal rewards, so when they feel they are getting less than they deserve, they react negatively. On the flip side, when members feel like they are being rewarded for their input to the group, and they feel that the group is fairly allocating these rewards, they feel esteemed and proud. Members see a motive for group mates to give less rewards, while being less likely to believe they could be over-rewarded. The reaction in the former instance is shaped more by distributive justice, whereas the latter reaction is shaped more by procedural justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blader|author2=Tyler|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 18th century, ideas of aesthetic pleasure have tried to define "taste". [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[David Hume|Hume]] both argued that there was universal good taste, which made aesthetic pleasure. A feminist line of logic about these attempts is that, because [[fine art]] was a leisure activity at this time, those who could afford to make art or produce supposed universal truths about how it is enjoyed would do so in a way that creates class and sex division.&lt;ref name="stanford" /&gt; Even when those universal aesthetists did address gender, they categorized aesthetics into two categories: [[beauty]] and [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublimity]]; with beauty being small and delicate (feminine) and sublimity being large and awe-inspiring (masculine).&lt;ref name="stanford" /&gt; Feminist aesthetics analyzes why "feminine" traits are subservient compared to "masculine" traits in art and aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender and Aesthetics: An Introduction|last=Korsmeyer|first=Carolyn|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=9780415266581|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another explanation for the male-domination of forming aesthetic theory is that feminists express their aesthetic pleasure differently than non-feminist aesthetes for "whom the pleasure of theorizing [...] is a form of [[jouissance]]". Instead, a feminist is less likely to view the object as a disinterested interpreter, and intellectualize the sensation (Hilde Hein).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Critics of feminist art argue that politics have no place in art, however, many art forms contain politics, but because of their subject position, the critics are unable to perceive it. &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Aesthetics in Feminist Perspective|last=Hein|first=Hilde|last2=Korsmeyer|first2=Carolyn|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1993|isbn=|location=Bloomington|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of the ''creative genius'' is inspected in feminist aesthetics. In particular, women artists are often excluded from being creative or artistic geniuses.&lt;ref name=":0" group="encycl"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Genius and Feminism|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Aesthetics|publisher=Oxford University Press|last=Battersby|first=Christine|date=1998|editor-last=Kelly|editor-first=Michael|isbn=9780195113075}}&lt;/ref&gt; This exclusion in part stems from the traditional masculine definitions of genius.&lt;ref name=":0" group="encycl" /&gt; Christine Battersby has critiqued the fact that women are excluded from being known as geniuses because female artists will be separated from their art, and instead their art will be called genius, instead of the artist.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, women were also excluded because they lacked the opportunities for artistic education required to be recognized as artists and geniuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender and Aesthetics: An Introduction|last=Korsmeyer|first=Carolyn|publisher=Taylor and Francis|year=2004|isbn=9780203646632|series=Understanding Feminist Philosophy|location=London|pages=59|chapter=Amateurs and Professionals}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the idea of the creative genius itself celebrates individualism – which Christine Battersby calls "a kind of masculine heroism" – and overlooks the work of joint collaborations.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gender and Genius: Towards a Feminist Aesthetics|last = Battersby|first = Christine|publisher = The Women's Press Ltd.|year = 1989|isbn = 978-0704343009|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aesthetic theories that make a distinction between "arts" and "crafts" can be viewed as anti-feminist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Differencing the Canon: Feminism and the Writing of Art's Histories|last=Pollock|first=Griselda|publisher=Routledge|year=1999|isbn=9780415066990|location=New York|pages=25|chapter=Differencing: Feminism's encounter with the canon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, art usually refers to ''fine art'' and crafts refers to everything else which has ''[[Everyday Aesthetics|everyday aesthetics]]''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Art forms traditionally used by women, such as embroidery or sewing, are perceived as crafts and not art, because of their domestic uses.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Feminist aesthetics focuses on all objects created by women, whether or not they are seen as "art".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Since those craft practices occur in the home where many women continue to work, their creativity is overlooked by the perception of "art", because their domain is marginalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Extraordinary in the Ordinary: The aesthetics of everyday life|last = Leddy|first = Thomas|publisher = Broadview Press|year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2011, Baylis has used her second tenure as a [[Canada Research Chair]] to focus on "developing new strategies that would allow bioethicists to make just and lasting policy contributions."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; As coined by Baylis, "impact ethics" is about "question[ing] the ''status quo'' in health care", "mak[ing] science subservient to the human good", "mak[ing] public institutions more responsive, accountable, and just", and "critiqu[ing] professional bioethics."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://impactethics.ca/about/|title=About Impact Ethics|last=|first=|date=2016|website=Impact Ethics|publisher=Blog at WordPress.com|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her research projects on "impact ethics"&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dal.ca/sites/noveltechethics/projects.html|title=Projects|last=|first=|date=2016|website=NTE Impact Ethics|publisher=Dalhousie University|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; include an emphasis on [[knowledge translation]] and [[Knowledge mobilization|mobilization]] which aim to implement in policy and practice a bioethics that is "responsible", "accountable" and "innovative"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;—a bioethics that can "make a difference"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; in serving the public by requiring from those who work in the field to act with "integrity and sensitivity to the real world of healthcare delivery, policy-making and politics."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A specific arm of these various projects is the ''Impact Ethics'' blog&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; which publishes submissions from a range of authors (students and faculty, academics, and writers outside of academia) with various perspectives on a diversity of subjects for bioethical debate. As Baylis summarizes it: "Impact ethics is about using the tools of ethics to shock, press, crack, and chip society into a better place. It is about outcomes, and ordering the study of ethics around changing things for the better."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The '''Grinnell College Innovator for Social Justice Prize''', created by [[Grinnell College]], is an annual program honoring individuals who have demonstrated leadership in their fields and "who show creativity, commitment and extraordinary accomplishment in effecting positive social change."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/blog/160487/4-under-40-making-difference-social-justice "4 Under 40 Making a Difference for Social Justice."]. [[The Nation]]. Retrieved 25 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year a $100,000 award will be given, with half going to the individual and half to their organization.

In seeking nominations each fall, Grinnell encourages entries from across a wide range of fields, including science, medicine, the environment, humanities, business, economics, education, law, public policy, social services, religion and ethics, as well as projects that cross these boundaries.  Nominations are also encouraged from areas that may not have been traditionally viewed as directly connected to social justice, such as the arts and business. Nominees may be U.S. citizens or nationals of other countries; no affiliation to Grinnell College is required.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grinnell.edu/about/admin/president/grinnell-prize/prize "Nominations"]. [[Grinnell College]]. Retrieved 15 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of Social Justice at Grinnell==
{{See also|Grinnell College#History|l1=History of Grinnell College}}

Grinnell was founded in 1846 by a group of transplanted New Englanders with strong Congregational and social-reformer backgrounds. They organized as the Trustees of Iowa College — originally in [[Davenport, Iowa]]. In 1859 the trustees moved the College to newly settled [[Grinnell, Iowa]], where their abolitionist sentiments were more welcome. At the time, Grinnell was an important stop on the [[Underground Railroad]] that secretly transported slaves to freedom.

Grinnell's social consciousness blossomed during [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin D. Roosevelt's]] presidency, when graduates [[Harry Hopkins]] '12, [[Chester Davis]] '11, [[Paul H. Appleby]] '13, [[Hallie Ferguson Flanagan]] '11, and [[Florence Stewart Kerr]] '12 became influential [[New Deal]] administrators.

Today, Grinnell's commitment to social justice continues through a strong philosophy of self governance and personal responsibility, as well as programs and initiatives that encourage students to learn about the world beyond the campus and effect positive social change. More than 300 Grinnell alumni have served in the [[Peace Corps]] since it was founded in 1961. Together, these alumni have served in 89 countries from [[Afghanistan]] to [[Zambia]].

For example, the Wall Alumni Prize provides financial support for Grinnell alumni to engage in service projects, programs, and organizations dedicated to improving the lives of others. Under Grinnell's Expanding Knowledge Initiative, the College has introduced curricular innovations in the areas of environmental challenges, human rights, and human dignity. The Liberal Arts in Prison Program, a collaborative effort by Grinnell students, faculty, and staff, engages incarcerated adults in courses in the liberal arts.

The Grinnell College Innovator for Social Justice Prize directly reflects Grinnell's historic mission to educate men and women "who are prepared in life and work to use their knowledge and their abilities to serve the common good." With the creation of the Grinnell Prize, the College is extending its educational mission beyond the campus and alumni community to individuals anywhere who believe innovative social justice programs create a better world.

==History of the Grinnell Prize==

The Innovator for Social Justice Prize program was announced in November, 2010.

The idea for Innovator for Social Justice Prize originated with [[Raynard S. Kington]], M.D., Ph.D., who began his tenure as Grinnell's thirteenth president in August, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialenterpriselive.com/your-news/grinnell-college-announces-winners-the-100000-2011-young-innovation-social-justice-prize "Grinnell College Announces Winners of the $100,000 2011 Young Innovation Social Justice Prize."] SocialEnterpriseLive.com. Referenced 25 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In underscoring the college's longstanding belief in social justice as a core tenet of its liberal arts academic mission, President Kington noted that the prize was created to "encourage and recognize young individuals who embody our core values and organizations that share our commitment to change the world."
 
The program drew more than 1,000 nominations from 66 countries in its initial year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ghananaija.com/2011/05/10/kofi-annan-wins-international-social-justice-prize/ "Kofi Annan Wins International Social Justice Prize"] GhanaNaija.com. Referenced 25 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomination criteria==

Nominations are evaluated based on how candidates have embraced the values of a liberal arts education, including critical thinking, creative problem-solving, free inquiry and commitment to using and sharing knowledge to better humanity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesandb.com/news/social-justice-prize-recipients-announced.html "Social Justice Prize Recipient Announced"].

The '''economics of happiness''' or '''happiness economics''' is the quantitative and theoretical study of [[happiness]], positive and negative [[Affect (psychology)|affect]], [[well-being]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/researchAndExpertise/researchImpact/caseStudies/layard-happiness-wellbeing-public-policy.aspx|title=Making personal happiness and wellbeing a goal of public policy|website=www.lse.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[quality of life]], [[life satisfaction]] and related concepts, typically combining [[economics]] with other fields such as [[psychology]], health and [[sociology]].  It typically treats such happiness-related measures, rather than wealth, income or profit, as something to be maximized. The field has grown substantially since the late 20th century, for example by the development of methods, surveys and indices to measure happiness and related concepts.&lt;ref name="Graham"&gt;• [[Carol Graham]], 2008.

==Metrology==
Given its very nature, reported happiness is subjective.&lt;ref&gt;Ruut Veenhoven, [http://www1.eur.nl/fsw/happiness/hap_bib/introtexts/introbib2.htm World Database of Happiness], 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  It is difficult to compare one person's happiness with another's.&lt;ref name="Graham"/&gt;  It can be especially difficult to compare happiness across cultures.&lt;ref name="Graham"/&gt;  However, many happiness economists believe they have solved this comparison problem.  Cross-sections of large data samples across nations and time demonstrate consistent patterns in the determinants of happiness.&lt;ref name="Graham"/&gt;

Happiness is typically measured using subjective measures – e.g. self-reported surveys – and/or objective measures. One concern has always been the [[accuracy]] and [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] of people's responses to happiness surveys.&lt;ref name="MVH"/&gt; Objective measures such as lifespan, income, and education are often used as well as or instead of subjectively reported happiness, though this assumes that they generally produce happiness, which while plausible may not necessarily be the case. The terms [[quality of life]] or [[well-being]] are often used to encompass these more objective measures.

Some scientists claim that happiness can be measured both subjectively and objectively by observing the joy center of the [[brain]] lit up with advanced imaging,&lt;ref name="MVH"/&gt; although this raises [[Type physicalism|philosophical issues]], for example about whether this can be treated as more reliable than reported subjective happiness.

Micro-econometric happiness equations have the standard form: &lt;math&gt;W_{it} = \alpha + \beta{x_{it}} + \epsilon_{it}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Graham"/&gt; In this equation &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is the reported well-being of individual &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a vector of known variables, which include socio-demographic and socioeconomic characteristics.&lt;ref name="Graham"/&gt;

Happiness, well-being, or satisfaction with life, was seen as unmeasurable in classical and neo-classical economics. [[Bernard van Praag|Van Praag]] was the first person who organized large surveys in order to explicitly measure welfare derived from income. He did this with the Income Evaluation Question (IEQ). This approach is called the [[Bernard van Praag|Leyden School]]. It is named after the Dutch university where this approach was developed. Other Researchers included Arie Kapteyn and Aldi Hagenaars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Praag|first=Bernard|date=1971-03-01|title=The welfare function of income in Belgium: An empirical investigation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0014292171900456|journal=European Economic Review|volume=2|issue=3|pages=337–69|doi=10.1016/0014-2921(71)90045-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===GDP and GNP===
Typically national financial measures, such as [[gross domestic product]] (GDP)  and [[gross national product]] (GNP), have been used as a measure of successful policy. There is a significant association between GDP and happiness, with citizens in wealthier nations being happier than those in poorer nations.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} It has been argued that this relationship extends only to an average [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|GDP per capita]] of about $15,000.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruno S. Frey]] and Alois Stutzer, 2002.  ''Happiness and Economics: How the Economy and Institutions Affect Human Well-Being'',  [http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7222.html Description] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=XD8-H35mspoC&amp;printsec=find&amp;pg=PR5=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false preview]. Princeton University Press; in the UK, John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2000s, several studies have obtained the opposite result, so this [[Easterlin paradox]] is controversial.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Easterlin paradox]] for details.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Individual income===
Historically, economists have said that well-being is a simple function of income. However, it has been found that once wealth reaches a subsistence level, its effectiveness as a generator of well-being is greatly diminished.&lt;ref name="ExplainingEconomics"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Explaining happiness|doi=10.1073/pnas.1633144100 |pmid=12958207 | volume=100 |issue=19 | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|pages=11176–11183|year=2003 | last1 = Easterlin | first1 = R. A.|pmc=196947}}&lt;/ref&gt; Happiness economists hope to change the way governments view well-being and how to most effectively govern and allocate resources given this paradox.&lt;ref name="Oswald"&gt;Andrew Oswald, [http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/faculty/oswald/intro.pdf ''A Non-Technical Introduction to the Economics of Happiness''], 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Daniel Kahneman]] and [[Angus Deaton]] found that higher earners generally reported better life satisfaction, but people's day-to-day emotional well-being only rose with earnings until a threshold annual income of $75,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Holmes|first=Bob|title=Money can buy you happiness – up to a point|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20727770.101-money-can-buy-you-happiness--up-to-a-point.html|accessdate=11 September 2010|newspaper=New Scientist|date=7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other factors have been suggested as making people happier than money.&lt;ref name="MVH"&gt;Rana Foroohar, [http://www.newsweek.com/id/35108 "Money v. Happiness: Nations Rethink Priorities"], ''Newsweek'', April 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A short term course of psychological therapy is 32 times more cost effective at increasing happiness than simply increasing income.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/6337162/Money-does-not-make-you-happy-but-therapy-does.html Money does not make you happy 'but therapy does'], ''The Telegraph'', November 20, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/alex.wood/money.pdf Boyce, C. J.; Wood, A. M. (in press).

Scholars at the University of Virginia, University of British Columbia and Harvard University released a study in 2011 after examining numerous academic paper in response to an apparent contradiction: "When asked to take stock of their lives, people with more money report being a good deal more satisfied. But when asked how happy they are at the moment, people with more money are barely different than those with less." Published in the ''Journal of Consumer Psychology'', the study is entitled "If Money Doesn't Make You Happy, Then You Probably Aren't Spending It Right" and included the following eight general recommendations:

*Spend money on "experiences" rather than goods.
*Donate money to others, including charities, rather than spending it solely on oneself.
*Spend small amounts of money on many small, temporary pleasures rather than less often on larger ones.
*Don't spend money on "extended warranties and other forms of overpriced insurance."
*Adjust one's mindset to "pay now, consume later," instead of "consume now, pay later."
*Exercise [[wikt:circumspect|circumspection]] about the day-to-day consequences of a purchase beforehand.
*Rather than buying products that provide the "best deal," make purchases based on what will facilitate well-being.
*Seek out the opinions of other people who have prior experience of a product before purchasing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Rozanne Larsen|title=If money doesn't make you happy, then you probably aren't spending it rightf|url=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/economics/personal-finance/money-happy-spending-research#|website=Journalist's Resource|publisher=Harvard Kennedy School's Shorenstein Center and the Carnegie-Knight Initiative|accessdate=17 August 2014|date=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their "Unhappy Cities" paper, Edward Glaeser, Joshua Gottlieb and Oren Ziv examined the self-reported subjective well-being of people living in American metropolitan areas, particularly in relation to the notion that "individuals make trade-offs among competing objectives, including but not limited to happiness." The researchers findings revealed that people living in metropolitan areas where lower levels of happiness are reported are receiving higher real wages, and they suggest in their conclusion that "humans are quite understandably willing to sacrifice both happiness and life satisfaction if the price is right."&lt;ref name="Cities"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Edward L. |last=Glaeser |first2=Joshua D. |last2=Gottlieb |first3=Oren |last3=Ziv |title=Unhappy Cities |journal=[[Journal of Labor Economics]] |volume=34 |issue=S2 |year=2016 |pages=S129–S182 |doi=10.1086/684044 |pmid=27546979 |pmc=4986926 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social security===
[[Ruut Veenhoven]] claimed that social security payments do not seem to add to happiness. This may be due to the fact that non-self-earned income (e.g., from a lottery) does not add to happiness in general either.{{fact|date=September 2018}} Happiness may be the mind's reward to a useful action. However, Johan Norberg of CIS, a free enterprise economy think tank, presents a hypothesis that as people who think that they themselves control their lives are more happy, paternalist institutions may decrease happiness.&lt;ref name=sci&gt;[http://www.cis.org.au/Policy/spring05/polspr05-2.htm The Scientist's Pursuit of Happiness] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100223054616/http://www.cis.org.au/Policy/spring05/polspr05-2.htm |date=2010-02-23 }}, ''Policy'', Spring 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cis.org.au/aboutcis/aboutcis.html |title=About CIS |author=The Centre for Independent Studies |accessdate=2010-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative perspective focuses on the role of the welfare state as an institution that improves quality of life not only by increasing the extent to which basic human needs are met, but also by promoting greater control of one's life by limiting the degree to which individuals find themselves at the mercy of impersonal market forces that are indifferent to the fate of individuals. This is the argument suggested by the U.S. political scientist [[Benjamin Radcliff]], who has presented a series of papers in peer reviewed scholarly journals demonstrating that a more generous welfare state contributes to higher levels of life satisfaction, and does so to rich and poor alike.&lt;ref name="apsr"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Radcliff | first1 = Benjamin | year = 2001 | title = Politics, Markets, and Life Satisfaction | url = | journal = [[American Political Science Review]] | volume = 95 | issue = 4| pages = 939–52 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pop"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Radcliff | first1 = Benjamin | last2 = Pacek | first2 = Alexander | year = 2008 | title = Assessing the Welfare State: the Politics of Happiness | url = | journal = [[Perspectives on Politics]] | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 267–77 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jop"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alvarez-Diaz | first1 = A. | last2 = Gonzalez | first2 = L. | last3 = Radcliff | first3 = B. | year = 2010 | title = The Politics of Happiness: On the Political Determinants of Quality of Life in the American States | url = | journal = [[The Journal of Politics]] | volume = 72 | issue = 3| pages = 894–905 | doi=10.1017/s0022381610000241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Employment===
Generally, the well-being of those who are employed is higher than those who are unemployed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stam | first1 = K. | last2 = Sieben | first2 = I. | last3 = Verbakel | first3 = E. | last4 = de Graaf | first4 = P.

While work does increase well-being through providing income, income level is not as indicative of subjective well-being as other benefits related to employment.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hagler | first1 = M. | last2 = Hamby | first2 = S. | last3 = Grych | first3 = J. | last4 = Banyard | first4 = V. | year = 2016 | title = Working for well-being: Uncovering the protective benefits of work through mixed methods analysis | url = | journal = Journal of Happiness Studies | volume = 17 | issue = 4| pages = 1493–510 | doi = 10.1007/s10902-015-9654-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Feelings of autonomy and mastery, found in higher levels in the employed than unemployed, are stronger predictors of subjective well-being than wealth.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

When personal preference and the amount of time spent working do not align, both men and women experience a decrease in subjective well-being.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Angrave | first1 = D. | last2 = Charlwood | first2 = A. | year = 2015 | title = What is the relationship between long working hours, over-employment, under-employment and the subjective well-being of workers?

Levels remained lower only when individuals worked more hours than preferred for a period of two years or more, which may indicate that it is more detrimental to be over-employed than under-employed in the long-term.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
 
Employment status effects are not confined to the individual. Being unemployed can have detrimental effects on a spouse's subjective well-being, compared to being employed or not working (and not looking for work).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 = M. | last2 = Do | first2 = Y. K. | year = 2013 | title = Effect of husbands' employment status on their wives' subjective well-being in Korea | url = | journal = Journal of Marriage &amp; Family | volume = 75 | issue = 2| pages = 288–99 | doi = 10.1111/jomf.12004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Partner life satisfaction is inversely related to the number of hours their partner is underemployed. When both partners are underemployed, the life-satisfaction of men is more greatly diminished than women.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, just being in a relationship reduces the impact unemployment has on the subjective well-being of an individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Meer | first1 = P | year = 2014 | title = Gender, Unemployment and Subjective Well-Being: Why Being Unemployed Is Worse for Men than for Women | doi = 10.1007/s11205-012-0207-5 | journal = Social Indicators Research | volume = 115 | issue = 1| pages = 23–44 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On a broad scale, high rates of unemployment negatively affect the subjective well-being of the employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Helliwell | first1 = J.

Becoming self-employed can increase subjective well-being, given the right conditions. Those who leave work to become self-employed report greater life satisfaction than those who work for others or become self-employed after unemployment; this effect increases over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Binder | first1 = Martin | last2 = Coad | first2 = Alex | year = 2013 | title = Life satisfaction and self-employment: a matching approach | url = http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:gbv:27-20110628-152532-3| journal = Small Business Economics | volume = 40 | issue = 4| pages = 1009–33 | doi=10.1007/s11187-011-9413-9| type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Binder | first1 = M. | last2 = Coad | first2 = A. | year = 2016 | title = How Satisfied are the Self-Employed?

The effects of retirement on subjective well-being vary depending on personal and cultural factors. Subjective well-being can remain stable for those who retire from work voluntarily, but declines for those who are involuntarily retired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bonsang | first1 = E. | last2 = Klein | first2 = T. | year = 2012 | title = Retirement and subjective well-being | url = | journal = Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization | volume = 83 | issue = 3| pages = 311–29 | doi = 10.1016/j.jebo.2012.06.002 | hdl = 10419/51994 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In countries with an average social norm to work, the well-being of men increases after retirement, and the well-being of retired women is at the same level as women who are homemakers or work outside the home.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In countries with a strong social norm to work, retirement negatively impacts the well-being of men and women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Relationships and children===
Relative declines in female happiness have eroded a gender gap in happiness in which women in the 1970s typically reported higher subjective well-being than did men.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/papers/2009/wp09-11bk.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, ''The Paradox of Declining Female Happiness'', May 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

In rich societies, where a rise in income doesn't equate to an increase in levels of subjective well-being, personal relationships are the determining factors of happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Layard | first1 = R | year = 2007 | title = Setting happiness as a national goal | url = | journal = The Futurist | volume = 41 | issue = 4| page = 37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glaeser, Gottlieb and Ziv suggest in their conclusion that the happiness trade-offs that individuals seem willing to make aligns with the tendency of parents to report less happiness, as they sacrifice their personal well-being for the "price" of having children.&lt;ref name="Cities" /&gt;

===Freedom and control===
There is a significant correlation between feeling in control of one's own life and happiness levels.

A study conducted at the [[University of Zurich]] suggested that democracy and federalism bring well-being to individuals.&lt;ref name="Frey&amp;Stutzer"&gt;Bruno S. Frey &amp; Alois Stutzer, [http://e-collection.ethbib.ethz.ch/ecol-pool/incoll/incoll_529.pdf ''Happiness, Economy and Institutions''], 4–5, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;  It concluded that the more direct political participation possibilities available to citizens raises their subjective well-being.&lt;ref name="Frey&amp;Stutzer"/&gt;  Two reasons were given for this finding.  First, a more active role for citizens enables better monitoring of professional politicians by citizens, which leads to greater satisfaction with government output.&lt;ref name="Frey&amp;Stutzer"/&gt;  Second, the ability for citizens to get involved in and have control over the political process, independently increases well-being.&lt;ref name="Frey&amp;Stutzer"/&gt;

American psychologist [[Barry Schwartz (psychologist)|Barry Schwartz]] argues in his book ''[[The Paradox of Choice]]'' that too many consumer and lifestyle choices can produce anxiety and unhappiness due to [[analysis paralysis]] and raised expectations of satisfaction.

===Religious diversity===
National [[cross-sectional data]] suggest an [[inverse relationship]] between religious diversity and happiness, possibly by facilitating more bonding (and less bridging) [[social capital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Okulicz-Kozaryn | first1 = Adam | year = 2011 | title = Does Religious Diversity Make Us Unhappy? | journal = Mental Health, Religion &amp; Culture | volume = 14 | issue = 10| pages = 1063–76 | doi=10.1080/13674676.2010.550277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Happiness and leisure===
{{see also|Happiness|Leisure}}
Much of the research regarding happiness and leisure relies on [[subjective well-being]] (SWB) as an appropriate measure of happiness. Research has demonstrated a wide variety of contributing and resulting factors in the relationship between leisure and happiness. These include psychological mechanisms, and the types and characteristics of leisure activities that result in the greatest levels of subjective happiness. Specifically, leisure may trigger five core psychological mechanisms including detachment-recovery from work, autonomy in leisure, mastery of leisure activities, meaning-making in leisure activities, and social affiliation in leisure (DRAMMA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Newman | first1 = D. B. | last2 = Tay | first2 = L. | last3 = Diener | first3 = E. | year = 2014 | title = Leisure and subjective well-being: A model of psychological mechanisms as mediating factors | url = | journal = Journal of Happiness Studies | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 555–78 | doi = 10.1007/s10902-013-9435-x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Leisure activities that are physical, relational, and performed outdoors are correlated with greater feelings of satisfaction with free time.&lt;ref name="Mingo2014"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mingo | first1 = I. | last2 = Montecolle | first2 = S. | year = 2014 | title = Subjective and objective aspects of free time: The Italian case | url = | journal = Journal of Happiness Studies | volume = 15 | issue = 2| pages = 425–41 | doi = 10.1007/s10902-013-9429-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research across 33 different countries shows that individuals who feel they strengthen social relationships and work on personal development during leisure time are happier than others.&lt;ref name="Wang2014"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = M. | last2 = Wong | first2 = M. S. | year = 2014 | title = Happiness and leisure across countries: Evidence from international survey data | url = | journal = Journal of Happiness Studies | volume = 15 | issue = 1| pages = 85–118 | doi = 10.1007/s10902-013-9417-z }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, shopping, reading books, attending cultural events, getting together with relatives, listening to music and attending sporting events is associated with higher levels of happiness. Spending time on the internet or watching TV is not associated with higher levels of happiness as compared to these other activities.&lt;ref name="Wang2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mingo2014"/&gt;
 
Research has shown that culture influences how we measure happiness and leisure. While SWB is a commonly used measure of happiness in North America and Europe, this may not be the case internationally. [[Quality of life]] (QOL) may be a better measure of happiness and leisure in Asian countries, especially Korea. Countries such as China and Japan may require a different measurement of happiness, as societal differences may influence the concept of happiness (i.e. economic variables, [[cultural practice]]s, and [[social network]]s) beyond what QOL is able to measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Liang | first1 = J. | last2 = Yamashita | first2 = T. | last3 = Brown | first3 = J. S. | year = 2013 | title = Leisure satisfaction and quality of life in China, Japan, and South Korea: A comparative study using AsiaBarometer 2006 | url = | journal = Journal of Happiness Studies | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 753–69 | doi = 10.1007/s10902-012-9353-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There seem to be some differences in leisure preference cross-culturally. Within the Croatian culture, family related leisure activities may enhance SWB across a large spectrum of ages ranging from adolescent to older adults, in both women and men. Active socializing and visiting cultural events are also associated with high levels of SWB across varying age and gender.&lt;ref name="Brajša-Žganec2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brajša-Žganec | first1 = A. | last2 = Merkaš | first2 = M. | last3 = Šverko | first3 = I. | year = 2011 | title = Quality of life and leisure activities: How do leisure activities contribute to subjective well-being? | url = | journal = Social Indicators Research | volume = 102 | issue = 1| pages = 81–91 | doi = 10.1007/s11205-010-9724-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Italians seem to prefer social conceptions of leisure as opposed to individualistic conceptions. Although different groups of individuals may prefer varying types and amount of leisure activity, this variability is likely due to the differing motivations and goals that an individual intends to fulfill with their leisure time.&lt;ref name="Mingo2014" /&gt;
 
Research suggests that specific leisure interventions enhance feelings of SWB. This is both a [[top-down and bottom-up effect]], in that leisure satisfaction causally affects SWB, and SWB causally affects [[leisure satisfaction]]. This bi-directional effect is stronger in retired individuals than in working individuals. Furthermore, it appears that satisfaction with our leisure at least partially explains the relationship between our engagement in leisure and our SWB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kuykendall | first1 = L. | last2 = Tay | first2 = L. | last3 = Ng | first3 = V. | year = 2015 | title = Leisure engagement and subjective well-being: A meta-analysis | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 141 | issue = 2| pages = 364–403 | doi = 10.1037/a0038508 | pmid = 25602273 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Broadly speaking, researchers classify leisure into active (e.g. volunteering, socializing, sports and fitness) and passive leisure (e.g. watching television and listening to the radio).&lt;ref name="Heo2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heo | first1 = J. | last2 = Lee | first2 = Y. | last3 = Kim | first3 = B. | last4 = Chun | first4 = S. | year = 2012 | title = Contribution of relaxation on the subjective well-being of older adults | url = | journal = Activities, Adaptation &amp; Aging | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 1–10 | doi = 10.1080/01924788.2011.647476 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among older adults, passive leisure activities and personal leisure activities (e.g. sleeping, eating, and bathing) correlate with higher levels of SWB and feelings of relaxation than active leisure activities. Thus, although significant evidence has demonstrated that active leisure is associated with higher levels of SWB, or happiness, this may not be the case with older populations.&lt;ref name="Brajša-Žganec2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Heo2012" /&gt;
 
Both regular and irregular involvement in sports leisure can result in heightened SWB. Serious, or systematic involvement in certain leisure activities, such as [[taekwondo]], correlates with personal growth and a sense of happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 = J. | last2 = Heo | first2 = J. | last3 = Lee | first3 = I.

Furthermore, the relationship between pleasure and skiing is thought to be caused in part by a sense of [[flow (psychology)|flow]] and involvement with the activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = H. | last2 = Shin | first2 = S. | last3 = Bunds | first3 = K.

Research regarding vacationing or taking a holiday trip is mixed. Although the reported effects are mostly small, some evidence points to higher levels of SWB, or happiness, after taking a holiday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kroesen | first1 = M. | last2 = Handy | first2 = S. | year = 2014 | title = The influence of holiday-taking on affect and contentment | url = | journal = Annals of Tourism Research | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 89–101 | doi = 10.1016/j.annals.2013.12.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gilbert | first1 = D. | last2 = Abdullah | first2 = J. | year = 2004 | title = Holidaytaking and the Sense of Well-Being | url = | journal = Annals of Tourism Research | volume = 31 | issue = 1| pages = 103–21 | doi = 10.1016/j.annals.2003.06.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic security ===
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poverty-action.org/publication/does-poverty-alleviation-decrease-depression-symptoms-post-conflict-settings-cluster|title=Does poverty alleviation decrease depression symptoms in post-conflict settings? A cluster-randomized trial of microenterprise assistance in Northern Uganda - Innovations for Poverty Action|website=www.poverty-action.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poverty alleviation are associated with happier populations. According to the latest systematic review of the economic literature on life satisfaction: Volatile or high inflation is bad for a population's well-being, particularly those with a right-wing political orientation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.iei.liu.se/nek/730g80/artiklar/1.421852/Happywhatmakesus.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; That suggests the impact of disruptions to economic security are in part mediated or modified by beliefs about economic security.

=== Political stability ===
The Voxeu&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voxeu.org/article/origins-happiness|title=Origins of happiness: Evidence and policy implications|first1=Andrew|last1=Clark|first2=Sarah|last2=Fleche|first3=Richard|last3=Layard|first4=Nattavudh|last4=Powdthavee|first5=George|last5=Ward|date=12 December 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; analysis of the economic determinants of happiness found that life satisfaction explains the largest share of an existing government's vote share, followed by economic growth, which itself explains six times as much as employment and twice as much as inflation.

There is some debate over whether living in poor neighbours make one happier. And, living among rich neighbours can dull the happiness that comes from wealth. This is purported to work by way of an upward or downward comparison effect ([[Keeping up with the Joneses]]). The balance of evidence is trending in favour of the hypothesis that  living in poor neighbourhoods makes one less happy, and living in rich neighbourhoods actually makes one happier, in the United States. While social status matters, a balance of factors like amenities, safe areas, well maintained housing, turn the tide in favour of the argument that richer neighbours are happier neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Does Your Neighbor's Income Affect Your Happiness?|first1=Glenn|last1=Firebaugh|first2=Matthew B.|last2=Schroeder|date=1 November 2009|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=115|issue=3|pages=805–831|pmid=20503742|pmc=4041613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Democracy ===
"The right to participate in the political process, measured by the extent of direct democratic rights across regions, is strongly correlated with subjective well-being (Frey and Stutzer, 2002&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt;) ... a potential mechanism that explains this relationship is the perception of procedural fairness and social mobility."&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt; Institutions and well-being, democracy and federalism are associated with a happier population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Happiness_economics&amp;oldid=836321220|title=Happiness economics|date=14 April 2018|publisher=|via=Wikipedia}}{{circular reference|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Correspondingly,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.publicdeliberation.net/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1167&amp;context=jpd&lt;/ref&gt; political engagement and activism have associated health benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=41502458|title=Some Benefits of Being an Activist: Measuring Activism and Its Role in Psychological Well-Being|first1=Malte|last1=Klar|first2=Tim|last2=Kasser|date=14 April 2018|journal=Political Psychology|volume=30|issue=5|pages=755–777}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On the other hand, some non democratic countries such as China and Saudi Arabia top the Ipsos list of countries where the citizenry is most happy with their government's direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ipsos.com/en-au/what-worries-world-january-2018|title=What Worries the World - January 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; That suggests that voting preferences may not translate well into overall satisfaction with the government's direction. In any case, both of these factors revealed preference and domain specific satisfaction rather than overall subjective well being.

=== Economic development ===
Historically, economists thought economic growth was unrelated to population level well-being, a phenomenon labelled the [[Easterlin paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;http://users.nber.org/~jwolfers/papers/EasterlinParadox.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; More robust research has identified that there is a link between economic development and the wellbeing of the population.
A &lt;2017 meta-analysis shows that the impact of infrastructure expenditure on economic growth varies considerable.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbvaresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/WP_Infraestructura_ENG.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; So, one cannot assume an infrastructure project will yield welfare benefits. The paper doesn't investigate or elaborate on any modifiable variables that might predict the value of a project. However, government spending on roads and primary industries is the best value target for transport spending, according to a 2013 meta-analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166046213000537|title=The productivity of transport infrastructure investment: A meta-analysis of empirical evidence|date=1 September 2013|journal=Regional Science and Urban Economics|volume=43|issue=5|pages=695–706|via=www.sciencedirect.com|doi=10.1016/j.regsciurbeco.2013.05.002|last1=Melo|first1=Patricia C.|last2=Graham|first2=Daniel J.|last3=Brage-Ardao|first3=Ruben}}&lt;/ref&gt;
7%+/−3% per annum discount rates are typically applied as the discount rate on public infrastructure projects in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;http://press-files.anu.edu.au/downloads/press/p345233/pdf/app04.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller real discount rates are used internationally to calculate the social return on investment by governments.

== Alternative approach: economic consequences of happiness ==
While the mainstream happiness economics has focused on identifying the determinants of happiness, an alternative approach in the discipline examines instead what are the economic consequences of happiness. Happiness may act as a determinant of economic outcomes: it increases productivity, predicts one's future income and affects labour market performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Piekałkiewicz|first=Marcin|date=2017-06-29|title=Why do economists study happiness?|journal=The Economic and Labour Relations Review|pages=361–377|language=en|doi=10.1177/1035304617717130|volume=28|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a growing number of studies justifying the so-called "happy-productive worker" thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zelenski|first=John M.|last2=Murphy|first2=Steven A.|last3=Jenkins|first3=David A.|date=2008-12-01|title=The Happy-Productive Worker Thesis Revisited|journal=Journal of Happiness Studies|language=en|volume=9|issue=4|pages=521–537|doi=10.1007/s10902-008-9087-4|issn=1389-4978}}&lt;/ref&gt; The positive and causal impact of happiness on an individual's productivity has been established in experimental studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oswald|first=Andrew J.|last2=Proto|first2=Eugenio|last3=Sgroi|first3=Daniel|date=2015-09-26|title=Happiness and Productivity|journal=Journal of Labor Economics|volume=33|issue=4|pages=789–822|doi=10.1086/681096|issn=0734-306X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Happiness economics and indices timeline==

The idea that happiness is important to a society is not new. Many other prominent intellectuals, philosophers and political leaders throughout history, including [[Aristotle]], [[Confucius]], and [[Plato]], incorporated happiness into their work.&lt;ref name="Graham"/&gt;

Thomas Jefferson put the "pursuit of happiness" on the same level as life and liberty in the United States' [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.bartleby.com/100/298.html | title=Thomas Jefferson. 1743–1826. John Bartlett, comp. 1919. Familiar Quotations, 10th ed. | access-date=February 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeremy Bentham]] believed that public policy should attempt to maximize happiness, and he even attempted to estimate a "hedonic calculus".&lt;ref name="MVH"/&gt; However, the American ruling philosophy protects the right of individuals to seek their own happiness, but does not place an equal responsibility for the citizens' happiness on the government. In the United States, there is no explicit policy that requires the rulers to develop the physical and mental well-being of the citizens or hold the government agencies accountable for their performance against specific measures or metrics of well-being. Until the 1972 there was no formal government policy, anywhere in the world, that placed happiness and well-being as a main criterion for public policy decision making.

The following is a chronological list of happiness economics and well-being indices:
[[File:Bhutan Gross National Happiness.jpg|thumb|"[[Gross National Happiness]] is more important than [[Gross National Product]]" by [[Jigme Singye Wangchuck]], [[List of rulers of Bhutan|King of Bhutan]]. Slogan on a wall in Thimphu's School of Traditional Arts]]
1972 – Bhutan's former king, [[Jigme Singye Wangchuck]], introduced the [[Gross National Happiness]] (GNH) philosophy and its four development pillars at an international conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.policyinnovations.org/ideas/briefings/data/000098/:pf_printable|title=Policy Innovations - Redefining Progress|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2005 – [[Med Jones]] of the International Institute of Management introduced the first GNH Index and Global GNH Index Survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/opinion/comment/the-happiness-portfolio-is-no-laughing-matter|title=The happiness portfolio is no laughing matter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GNH Index, also known as [[Gross National Well-being]] (GNW) Index framework served as the first integrated objective (economic) and subjective (happiness) socioeconomic development framework. Prior the GNH Index, there were few development indices that improved upon the gross domestic product (GDP), but did not measure happiness. For example, the [[Genuine Progress Indicator]] was focused on the environmental cost of economic development, then later (in 2006) it was updated to include similar measures to the GNH Index. Another development index is the [[Human Development Index]] (HDI) that originally focused on literacy and education but also did not measure happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gnh.institute/happiness-economics/happiness-economics-timeline-milestones-history.htm|title=Modern Happiness Economics History &amp; Milestones - Gross National Happiness Timeline - GNH History - Well Being Economics Timeline - Happiness Movement History|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The HDI now measures three basic dimensions of human development, health (as measured by life expectancy at birth), overall knowledge level (as measured by the literacy rate), and standard of living (as measured by GDP per capita for a given year). Among the criticisms of the HDI is the complaint that it  is a mixture of stock measures (life expectancy at birth and literacy rate) and a flow measure (GDP per capita for a given year).  To overcome this criticism, Hou, Walsh, and Zhang (2015) proposed a new index called HDIF (Human Development Index Flow), in which they replaced life expectancy at birth by the under-five mortality rate (for a given year), and they also replaced the literacy rate by the gross primary school enrollment ratio for a given year).  They calculated both the HDI and the HDIF for many countries and found that "the HDIF and the HDI tend to converge for wealthy countries and diverge for poor countries, especially those with low HDI rankings". The development performance of poor countries improved using the HDIF while the performance of the wealthy countries declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hou|first=Jack|last2=Walsh|first2=Patrick|date=September 2015|others=Jing Zhang, 3d name|title=The dynamics of Human Development Index|url=|journal=The Social Science Journal|issue=3|doi=10.1016/j.soscij.2014.07.003|pmid=|access-date=|volume=52|pages=331–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2006 – The [[Genuine Progress Indicator]] was updated from a green measurement system to a broader concept that included quantitative measurement of [[well-being]] and happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/beyond_gdp/download/factsheets/bgdp-ve-gpi.pdf|title=Beyond GDP Paper - p. 2 - John Talberth, Center for Sustainable Economy 2012 at The European Commission Website|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new measure is motivated by the philosophy of the GNH and the same notion of that subjective measures like well-being are more relevant and important than more objective measures like [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]. It is not measured directly, but only by means of the factors which are believed to lead to it.

2007 – [[Thailand]] releases Green and Happiness Index (GHI).&lt;ref&gt;[http://thailand.prd.go.th/view_news.php?id=2154&amp;a=2 "Green and Happiness Index (GHI"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219080709/http://thailand.prd.go.th/view_news.php?id=2154&amp;a=2 |date=2015-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

2008 – French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] launched a Happiness Initiative similar to GNH, calling for the inclusion of happiness and well-being among the criteria for national governance policies. He commissioned three prominent economists, Joseph Stiglitz (USA), Amartya Sen (India), Jean-Paul Fitoussi (France), to publish a report calling for a global "statistical system which goes beyond commercial activity to measure personal well-being." Later it was described as gross domestic happiness (GDH).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/sarkozy-proposes-the-ijoie-de-vivrei-index-1787221.html|title=Sarkozy proposes the joie de vivre index|date=14 September 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GDH Index is similar to the GNH Index of 2005.

2009 – In the United States, the [[Gallup poll]] system launched the happiness survey collecting data on national scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.wharton.upenn.edu/socialimpact/GrossNationalHappiness|title=Service Down|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gallup Well-Being Index was modeled after the GNH Index framework of 2005. The Well-Being Index score is an average of six sub-indexes which  measure life evaluation, emotional health, work environment, physical health, healthy behaviors, and access to basic necessities. In October 2009, the US scored 66.1/100.

2010 – The concept was taken seriously, as the [[Centre for Bhutan Studies]], under the leadership of [[Karma Ura]], developed a sophisticated survey instrument to measure the population's general level of well-being.&lt;ref name=dotcom1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grossnationalhappiness.com |title=Gross National Happiness |publisher=The Centre for Bhutan Studies |accessdate=24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two Canadians, Michael and Martha Pennock played a major role in developing the Bhutanese survey, which took a six- to seven-hour interview to complete. They developed a shorter international version of the survey which has been used in their home region of Victoria BC as well as in Brazil. The Pennocks also collaborated with Ura in the production of a policy lens which is used by the Bhutanese GNH Commission for anticipating the impact of policy initiatives upon the levels of GNH in Bhutan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195925510000648|title=Gross national happiness as a framework for health impact assessment|first1=Michael|last1=Pennock|first2=Karma|last2=Ura|date=1 January 2011|journal=Environmental Impact Assessment Review|volume=31|issue=1|pages=61–65|via=ScienceDirect|doi=10.1016/j.eiar.2010.04.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2010 – The Center for Bhutan Studies further defined the original four pillars with greater specificity into eight general contributors to happiness—physical, mental and spiritual health; time-balance; social and community vitality; cultural vitality; education; living standards; good governance; and ecological vitality. The [[Bhutan GNH Index]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journals.hil.unb.ca/index.php/antistasis/article/viewFile/21119/24379|title=Bhutan GNH Index|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2010 – The Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative OPHI at the University of Oxford in UK, launched the [[Multidimensional Poverty Index]] (MPI) for the United Nations Development Programme, (UNDP). Similar to the GNH Index of 2005, OPHI promotes collection and analysis of data on five dimensions including Quality of work, Empowerment, Physical safety, Ability to go about without shame, Psychological wellbeing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16693283|title=A wealth of data|publisher=|via=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2011 – UN General Assembly Resolution 65/309, titled "Happiness: towards a holistic approach to development"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/ageing/documents/NOTEONHAPPINESSFINALCLEAN.pdf|title=UN Happiness Resolution|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2011 – The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) launched "Better Life Index" (BLI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/|title=OECD Better Life Index|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2011 – The [[United Nations]] released the [[World Happiness Report]]

2011 – Canadian Index of Wellbeing Network (CIW Network) released The Canadian Index of Wellbeing (CIW).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://uwaterloo.ca/canadian-index-wellbeing/|title=The CIW regularly reports on the quality of life of Canadians – nationally, provincially, and locally – and advocates for social change that reflects our values and places wellbeing at the heart of policy.|date=13 June 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2011 – The Israeli newspaper ''[[Haaretz]]'' published an article suggesting that western GDP economics is an incomplete development model and called for the adoption of Bhutan's GNH philosophy and Jones' GNH Index in [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.co.il/magazine/1.1563206 "Why Ordinary Economic Indicators Do Not Tell The Whole Truth", ''Haaretz'', Israel]&lt;/ref&gt;

2011 – Chuluun Togtokh criticized the HDI in an article published in ''Nature'', calling for a revised HDI, writing that "The revised index should include each nation's per capita carbon emissions, and so become a Human Sustainable Development Index (HSDI)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Togtokh|first=Chuluun|date=17 November 2011|title=Time to Stop Celebrating the Polluters|url=|journal=Nature|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bravo (2014) provided details of how the HSDI was computed and proposed an amended HSDI by including the proportion of forested area in each country.  He argued that this proposed indicator "represents an important measure of the capacity of natural system to provide fundamental ecological services."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bravo|first=Giangiacomo|date=February 2014|title=The Human Sustainable Development Index: New Calculations and a First Critical Analysis|url=|journal=Ecological Indicators|volume=37|page=149|doi=10.1016/j.ecolind.2013.10.020|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2012 – In a report prepared for the US Congressman Hansen Clarke, R, researchers Ben Beachy and Juston Zorn, at [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] in [[Harvard University]], recommended that "the Congress should prescribe the broad parameters of new, carefully designed supplemental national indicators; it should launch a bipartisan commission of experts to address unresolved methodological issues, and include alternative indicators." They proposed that the government can use the survey results to see which well-being dimensions are least satisfied and which districts and demographic groups are most deficient, so as to allocate resources accordingly. The report list the Gross National Happiness Index and its seven measurement area as one of the main frameworks to consider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hks.harvard.edu/content/download/67149/1241406/version/1/file/PAE+Beachy_Zorn_2012.pdf|title=National Indicators for a New Era, Ben, Beachy and Juston Zorn, of the John F Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2012 – Professor [[Peter T. Coleman (academic)|Peter T.

[[File:World happiness 2006.png|thumb|300px|The [[Satisfaction with Life Index]]. Blue through red represent most to least happy respectively; grey areas have no reliable data available.]]
The [[Satisfaction with Life Index]] is an attempt to show the average self-reported happiness in different nations. This is an example of a recent trend to use direct measures of happiness, such as surveys asking people how happy they are, as an alternative to traditional measures of policy success such as GDP or GNP.  Some studies suggest that happiness can be measured effectively.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.12/start.html?pg=2 ''The True Measure of Success''] – Wired.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samuelbrittan.co.uk/spee22_p.html ''"Happiness" is not enough''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229084942/http://www.samuelbrittan.co.uk/spee22_p.html |date=2006-12-29 }}- Samuel Brittan: Templeton Lecture Inst. of Economic Affairs 22/11/01&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Inter-American Development Bank]] (IDB), published in November 2008 a major study on happiness economics in Latin America and the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iadb.org/idbdocs/1776308.pdf|title=IADB.org - Page not found (HTTP 404)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, John Helliwell, Richard Layard and Jeffery Sachs compiled a treatise under the title "World Happiness report 2013" to elaborate on the measurement of popular happiness in different countries thereby adding to the wealth of happiness data available while specifically discussing the issues of measurement, explanation and policy. Global and Regional Happiness Levels are explained in terms of 10 regional groupings of countries based on happiness data available for the year 2010-2012. The happiness level is explained as a function of GDP per capita, social support, and healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity and perceptions of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unsdsn.org/resources/publications/world-happiness-report-2013/|title=Sustainable Development Solutions Network - World Happiness Report 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also several examples of measures that includes self-reported happiness as one variable. [[Happy Life Years]], a concept brought by [[Dutch people|Dutch]] sociologist Ruut Veenhoven, combines self-reported happiness with [[life expectancy]]. The [[Happy Planet Index]] combines it with life expectancy and [[ecological footprint]].

[[Gross National Happiness]] (GNH) is a concept introduced by the King of [[Bhutan]] in 1972 as an alternative to [[GDP]]. Several countries have already developed or are in the process of developing such an index.&lt;ref name="MVH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NewMeasure"&gt;[[Andrew Revkin]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/04/science/04happ.html "A New Measure of Well-Being From a Happy Little Kingdom"], ''The New York Times'', October 4, 2005,  [hereinafter "New Measure"].{{Clarify|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhutan's index has led that country to limit the amount of deforestation it will allow and to require that all tourists to its nation must spend US$200&lt;ref name="MVH"/&gt; Allegedly, low-budget tourism and deforestation lead to unhappiness.&lt;ref name="MVH"/&gt;

After the military [[coup]] of 2006, [[Thailand]] also instituted an index.&lt;ref name="MVH"/&gt;  The stated promise of the new Prime Minister [[Surayud Chulanont]] is to make the Thai people not only richer but happier as well.&lt;ref name="MVH"/&gt; Much like GDP results, Thailand releases monthly GNH data.&lt;ref name="Monsters"&gt;[http://news.monstersandcritics.com/asiapacific/news/article_1303777.php Thailand's Gross Domestic Happiness Index Falls], Monsters and Critics, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  The Thai GNH index is based on a 1–10 scale with 10 being the most happy.&lt;ref name="Monsters"/&gt;  As of May 13, 2007, the Thai GNH measured 5.1 points.&lt;ref name="Monsters"/&gt; The index uses poll data from the population surveying various satisfaction factors such as, security, public utilities, good governance, trade, social justice, allocation of resources, education and community problems.&lt;ref name="Monsters"/&gt;

The CIW has adopted the following  working definition of wellbeing: The presence of the highest possible quality of life in its full breadth of expression focused on but not necessarily exclusive to: good living standards, robust health, a sustainable environment, vital communities, an educated populace, balanced time use, high levels of democratic participation, and access to and participation in leisure and culture&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=2012 CIW composite index reveals Canadian wellbeing is on the decline |url=https://uwaterloo.ca/canadian-index-wellbeing/ |date=2012-03-16 |accessdate=2013-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ecuador]]'s and [[Bolivia]]'s new constitutions state the indigenous concept of "good life" ("buen vivir" in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], "sumak kawsay" in [[Quichua]], and "suma qamaña" in [[Aymara language|Aymara]]) as the goal of sustainable development.

== Neoclassical economics ==
[[Neoclassical economics|Neoclassical]], as well as [[classical economics]], are not subsumed under the term ''happiness economics'' although the original goal was to increase the happiness of the people. Classical and neoclassical economics are stages in the development of [[welfare economics]] and are characterized by mathematical modeling. Happiness economics represents a radical break with this tradition. The measurement of ''subjective'' happiness respectively [[life satisfaction]] by means of [[survey research]] across nations and time (in addition to objective measures like lifespan, wealth, security etc.) marks the beginning of happiness economics.

== Criticism ==
Some have suggested that establishing happiness as a metric is only meant to serve political goals.&lt;ref name="MVH"/&gt;  Recently there has been concern that happiness research could be used to advance authoritarian aims.&lt;ref name="MVH"/&gt;  As a result, some participants at a happiness conference in Rome have suggested that happiness research should not be used as a matter of public policy but rather used to inform individuals.&lt;ref name="MVH"/&gt;

Even on the individual level there is discussion on how much effect external forces can have on happiness.  Less than 3% of an individual's level of happiness comes from external sources such as employment,  education level, marital status, and socioeconomic status.&lt;ref name="Stoch"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lykken|first1=D|last2=Tellegen|first2=A|title=Happiness is a stochastic phenomenon|journal=Psychological Science|date=1996|volume=7|issue=3|pages=186–89|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.1996.tb00355.x|citeseerx=10.1.1.613.4004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To go along with this, four of the [[Big Five Personality Traits]]  are substantially associated with life satisfaction, openness to experience is not associated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heller|first1=D|last2=Watson|first2=D|last3=Ilies|first3=R|title=The role of person versus situation in life satisfaction: a critical examination.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=2004|volume=130|issue=4|pages=574–600|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.130.4.574|pmid=15250814}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Having high levels of internal [[locus of control]] lead to higher reported levels of happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Myers|first1=D|title=Pursuit of happiness: Discovering the pathway to fulfillment, well-being, and enduring personal joy.|date=1993|publisher=Harper Paperbacks}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Denny |first1=Katherine G. |last2=Steiner |first2=Hans |date=March 2009 |title=External and Internal Factors Influencing Happiness in Elite Collegiate Athletes |journal=Child Psychiatry and Human Development |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=55–72 |doi=10.1007/s10578-008-0111-z |pmid=18626767}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when happiness can be affected by external sources, it has high [[hedonic adaptation]], some specific events such as an increase in income, disability, unemployment, and loss (bereavement) only have short-term (about a year) effects on a person's overall happiness and after a while happiness may return to levels similar to unaffected peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frederick|first1=S|last2=Loewenstein|first2=George|title=Hedonic adaptation.|date=1999|publisher=Russell Sage Foundation|pages=302–329}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kahneman|first1=D|last2=Krueger|first2=A|last3=Schkade|first3=D|last4=Schwarz|first4=N|last5=Stone|first5=A|title=Would you be happier if you were richer? A focusing illusion|journal=Science|date=2006|volume=312|issue=5782|pages=1908–10|doi=10.1126/science.1129688|pmid=16809528|citeseerx=10.1.1.373.2683}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What has the most influence over happiness are internal factors such as genetics, personality traits, and internal locus of control. It is theorized that 50% of the variation in happiness levels is from genetic sources and is known as the genetic set point. The genetic set point is assumed to be stable over time, fixed, and immune to influence or control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lyubomrsky|first1=S|last2=Sheldon|first2=K|last3=Schkade|first3=D|title=Pursuing happiness: The architecture of sustainable change|journal=Review of General Psychology|date=2005|volume=9|issue=2|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; This goes along with findings that well-being surveys have a naturally positive baseline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diener|first1=E|last2=Diener|first2=C|title=Most People are Happy|journal=Psychological Science|date=1996|volume=7|issue=3|pages=181–85|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.1996.tb00354.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
With such strong internal forces on happiness it is hard to have an effect on a person's happiness externally.  This in turn lends itself back to the idea that establishing a happiness metric is only for political gain and has little other use.  To support this even further it is believed that a country aggregate level of SWB can account for more variance in government vote share than standard macroeconomic variables, such as income and employment.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, George (2015) ''Is happiness a predictor of election results?'' CEP Discussion Papers, CEPDP1343. Centre for Economic Performance, London School of Economics and Political Science, London, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical criticism ==
According to Bond and Lang (2018) the results are skewed due to the fact that the respondents have to "round" their true happiness to the scale of, e.g., 3 or 7 alternatives (e.g., very happy, pretty happy, not too happy). This "rounding error" may cause a less happy group seem more happy, in the average. This would not be the case if the happiness of both groups would be normally distributed with the same variance, but that is usually not the case, based on their results. For some not-implausible log-normal assumptions on the scale, typical results can be reversed to the opposite results.&lt;ref name=bd2018&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~bond10/BondLang2018happy.pdf|title=The Sad Truth about Happiness Scales|year=2018|author=Timothy N. Bond and Kevin Lang|pages=3–4, 10, A–47, A–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They also show that the "reporting function" seems to be different for different groups and even for the same individual at different times. For example, when a person becomes disabled, they soon start to lower their threshold for a given answer (e.g., "pretty happy"). That is, they give a higher answer than they would have given at the same happiness state before becoming disabled.&lt;ref name=bd2018/&gt;

'''''In Search of Our Origins: How the Quran Can Help in Scientific Research''''' is a research based, non-fiction book written by [[Jamshed Akhtar]].

The author is involved in the study of revealed knowledge, contained in the [[Qur'an]] and other religious scriptures for last several years. In the present book, he presents several pointers from the [[epistemological]] study of the [[Qur'an]] on the origin of life and man. These pointers try to explain where the life was created on the primeval earth, what is its link with the man, and how, where and when the first ancestor of modern man and his mate were created on earth.

The research presented in the book differs from the traditional view and presents support from standard lexicons to explain how the Qur'anic/Arabic words were originally understood by Bedouins of the area.

The book also argues that the phenomenon of [[Revelation]] is global and non-human, and several of its premises such as the human pair was born 59000 years ago from a female of a previous specie(s) are likely to generate a lot of controversy amongst the traditionalists of all faiths.

The book suggests "collective scientific investigation" of the information by a panel of linguists, science historians and scientists of various disciplines, for in-depth verification of the research and premises made in the book. The book has outlined a mechanism based on information theory precepts for this purpose.

Author's earlier book [[The Ultimate Revelations]] published in 1996 was a science fiction based on Qur'an.

'''John Nicholas Gray''' (born 17 April 1948) is an English [[political philosopher]] with interests in [[analytic philosophy]] and the [[history of ideas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/philosopherszone/john-gray-at-the-writers-festival---part-1/3274788 |title=John Gray at the Writers' Festival - Part 1 - The Philosopher's Zone - ABC Radio National (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2008-06-28 |accessdate=2013-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He retired in 2008 as School Professor of European Thought at the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]]. Gray contributes regularly to ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' and the ''[[New Statesman]]'', where he is the lead book reviewer. He is an [[atheist]].&lt;ref name=Atheism&gt;{{cite web|last1=Preston|first1=John|title=John Gray interview: how an English academic become the world’s pre-eminent prophet of doom|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/9888780/John-Gray-interview-how-an-English-academic-become-the-worlds-pre-eminent-prophet-of-doom.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gray has written several influential books, including ''[[False Dawn: The Delusions of Global Capitalism]]'' (1998), which argues that free market globalization is an unstable [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] project currently in the process of disintegration; ''Straw Dogs: Thoughts on Humans and Other Animals'' (2003), which attacks philosophical [[humanism]], a worldview which Gray sees as originating in religions; and ''[[Black Mass: Apocalyptic Religion and the Death of Utopia]]'' (2007), a critique of [[utopian]] thinking in the modern world.

Gray sees [[volition (psychology)|volition]], and hence [[morality]], as an illusion, and portrays humanity as a ravenous species engaged in wiping out other forms of life. Gray has written that "humans ... cannot destroy the Earth, but they can easily wreck the environment that sustains them."&lt;ref&gt;John Gray, Straw Dogs: Thoughts on Humans and Other Animals, (Granta Books 2002), p. 12. {{ISBN|1-86207-512-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
Gray was born into a working-class family, with a docker-turned-carpenter father,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/9888780/John-Gray-interview-how-an-English-academic-become-the-worlds-pre-eminent-prophet-of-doom.html |title=John Gray interview: how an English academic become the world’s pre-eminent prophet of doom |publisher=Telegraph |date= 28 February 2013|accessdate=2013-08-09 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[South Shields]], which was then in [[County Durham]]. He attended [[Harton Academy|South Shields Grammar-Technical School for Boys]] from 1959 until 1967,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/philosophy/2009/04/john-gray-enlightenment-world |title=The NS Profile: John Gray |publisher=Newstatesman.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; then studied at [[Exeter College, Oxford]], reading [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]] (PPE), completing his B.A., M.Phil. and D.Phil.

He formerly held posts as lecturer in political theory at the [[University of Essex]], fellow and tutor in politics at [[Jesus College, Oxford]], and lecturer and then professor of politics at the [[University of Oxford]]. He has served as a visiting professor at [[Harvard University]] (1985–86) and Stranahan Fellow at the Social Philosophy and Policy Center, [[Bowling Green State University]] (1990–1994), and has also held visiting professorships at [[Tulane University]]’s Murphy Institute (1991) and [[Yale University]] (1994). He was Professor of European Thought at the [[London School of Economics|London School of Economics and Political Science]] until his retirement from academic life in early 2008.

==Political and philosophical thought==
Among philosophers, he is known for a thoroughgoing rejection of [[John Rawls|Rawlsianism]] and for exploration of the uneasy relationship between [[value pluralism]] and liberalism in the work of [[Isaiah Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}} §4. Ethical Thought and Value Pluralism.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gray's political thought is noted for its mobility across the political spectrum over the years. As a student, Gray was on the left and continued to vote Labour into the mid-1970s. By 1976 he had shifted towards a right-liberal [[New Right]] position, on the basis that the world was changing irrevocably through technological inventions, realigned financial markets and new economic power blocs and that the left failed to comprehend the magnitude and nature of this change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-923X.00137/pdf |title=Ethics Man: John Gray's New Moral World |date=2003-01-10 |accessdate=2013-08-09 |doi=10.1111/1467-923X.00137 |volume=69 |journal=The Political Quarterly |pages=59–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s Gray became an advocate for environmentalism and [[New Labour]]. Gray considers the conventional (left-wing/right-wing) political spectrum of conservatism and [[social democracy]] as no longer viable.&lt;ref&gt;''False Dawn: The Delusions of Global Capitalism''&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[liberalism]], Gray identified the common strands in liberal thought as being ''individualist'', ''egalitarian'', ''[[meliorism|meliorist]]'', and ''universalist''. The individualist element avers the ethical primacy of the human being against the pressures of [[Collectivism|social collectivism]], the egalitarian element assigns the same moral worth and status to all individuals, the meliorist element asserts that successive generations can improve their sociopolitical arrangements, and the universalist element affirms the moral unity of the human species and marginalises local cultural differences.&lt;ref name="Gray, p. xii"&gt;Gray, John. ''Liberalism''. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1995. {{ISBN|0-8166-2801-7}}, p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, he has criticised [[neoliberalism]], the global [[free market]] and some of the central currents in [[Western philosophy|Western thinking]], such as [[humanism]], while moving towards aspects of [[environmentalism|green thought]], drawing on the [[Gaia hypothesis|Gaia theory]] of [[James Lovelock]]. It is perhaps for this critique of humanism that Gray is best known.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Straw Dogs: Thoughts on Humans and Other Animals''&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to the doctrine of humanism, in Gray's view, is the inherently [[utopian]] belief in [[meliorism]]; that is, that humans are not limited by their biological natures and that advances in ethics and politics are cumulative and that they can alter or improve the [[human condition]], in the same way that advances in science and technology have altered or improved [[living standards]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Gray contends, in opposition to this view, that history is not progressive, but cyclical. [[Human nature]], he argues, is an inherent obstacle to cumulative ethical or political progress.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Seeming improvements, if there are any, can very easily be reversed: one example he has cited has been the use of [[torture]] by the United States against terrorist suspects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/node/144806 A Modest Proposal For Preventing Torturers in Liberal Democracies From Being Abused, and For Recognising Their Benefit to The Public]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newhumanist.org.uk/939/going-nowhere-laurie-taylor-interviews-john-gray |title=Going nowhere: Laurie Taylor interviews John Gray |publisher=Newhumanist.org.uk |date=2007-05-31 |accessdate=2013-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; "What's interesting," Gray said in an interview in [[032c]] magazine, "is that torture not only came back, but was embraced by liberals, and defended by liberals. Now there are a lot of people, both liberal and conservative, who say, 'Well, it's a very complicated issue.' But it wasn't complicated until recently. They didn't say that five or ten years ago."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://032c.com/2008/post-american-age/|title=John Gray: Post-American Age|accessdate=11 February 2013|publisher=032c}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, he argues that this belief in progress, commonly imagined to be secular and liberal, is in fact derived from an erroneous Christian notion of humans as morally autonomous beings categorically different from other animals. This belief, and the corresponding idea that history makes sense, or is progressing towards something, is in Gray's view merely a Christian prejudice.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In ''Straw Dogs'' he argues that the idea that humans are [[self-determination|self-determining]] agents does not pass the acid test of experience. Those [[Darwinist]] thinkers who believe humans can take charge of their own destiny to prevent environmental degradation are, in this view, not [[naturalists]], but apostles of humanism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

He identifies the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] as the point at which the [[salvation|Christian doctrine of salvation]] was taken over by secular idealism and became a political religion with universal emancipation as its aim.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Communism, fascism and "global democratic capitalism" are characterised by Gray as Enlightenment 'projects' which have led to needless suffering, in Gray's view, as a result of their ideological allegiance to this religion.&lt;ref&gt;The darkness within.

===Agonistic liberalism&lt;!--'Agonistic liberalism' redirects here--&gt;===

The term '''agonistic liberalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; appears in Gray's 1995 book ''Isaiah Berlin''. Gray uses this phrase to describe what he believes is Berlin's theory of politics, namely his support for both value pluralism and liberalism.

More generally, agonistic liberalism could be used to describe any kind of liberalism that claims its own value commitments do not form a complete vision of politics and society, and that one instead needs to look for what Berlin calls an "uneasy equilibrium" between competing values. In Gray's view, many contemporary liberal theorists would fall into this category, for instance [[John Rawls]] and [[Karl Popper]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Agonistic liberalism is an alternative to Berlin's theory of value pluralism and liberalism. While Berlin claimed equal validity for conflicting liberal views, agonistic liberalism holds that over time solutions may be found that determine which values are correct.&lt;ref&gt;Talisse, Robert B. "Liberalism, Pluralism, and Political Justification", ''THE HARVARD REVIEW OF PHILOSOPHY'' vol.XIII no.2 2005, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Agonistic liberalism is the theory that conflict rather than discussion is the basis of social change.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, James. "Piero Gobetti's agonistic liberalism". ''History of European Ideas'' Volume 32, Issue 2, June 2006, Pages 205-222&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acclaim==

Gray's work has been praised by, amongst others, the novelists [[J. G. Ballard]], [[Will Self]] and [[John Banville]], the theologian [[Don Cupitt]], the journalist [[Bryan Appleyard]], the political scientist [[David Runciman]], the venturer [[George Soros]], the environmental scientist [[James Lovelock]] and the author [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/john-gray-forget-everything-you-know-175755.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150309153822/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/john-gray-forget-everything-you-know-175755.html|archivedate= 9 March 2015 | work=The Independent |title=John Gray: forget everything you know |first=Will| last=Self |date=3 September 2002|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/sep/15/highereducation.shopping | work=The Guardian | first=Jason | last=Cowley | title=Observer review: Straw Dogs by John Gray | date=19 September 2002 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article1961492.ece | work=The Times |first= Bryan | last=Appleyard |authorlink=Bryan Appleyard |title=John Gray's apocalypse}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;False Dawn: The Delusions of Global Capitalism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Black Mass: Apocalyptic Religion and the Death of Utopia&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Friedrich Hayek]] described Gray's 1984 book ''Hayek on Liberty'' as "The first survey of my work which not only fully understands but is able to carry on my ideas beyond the point at which I left off."&lt;ref name="Robin2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Corey Robin|title=The Reactionary Mind: Conservatism from Edmund Burke to Sarah Palin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yk9VczyvtR8C&amp;pg=PT91|date=29 September 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-991188-2|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gray has discussed James Lovelock's new ideas on evolution's next step; a species beyond human species that will be better able to co-exist with other species on this planet in the distant future.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

His 1998 book ''[[False Dawn: The Delusions of Global Capitalism|False Dawn]]'' was praised by George Soros as "a powerful analysis of the deepening instability of global capitalism" which "should be read by all who are concerned about the future of the global economy".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; John Banville praised ''[[Black Mass: Apocalyptic Religion and the Death of Utopia|Black Mass]]'', saying that 'Gray's assault on Enlightenment ideas of progress is timelier than ever'.&lt;ref&gt;Gray's Anatomy: Selected Writings&lt;/ref&gt;

His 2002 book ''Straw Dogs: Thoughts on Humans and Other Animals'' has received particular praise.  J. G. Ballard wrote that the book "challenges most of our assumptions about what it means to be human, and convincingly shows that most of them are delusions" and described it "a powerful and brilliant book", "an essential guide to the new millennium" and "the most exhilarating book I have read since [[Richard Dawkins]]'s ''[[The Selfish Gene]]''."&lt;ref name="amazon"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1862075964 |title=Straw Dogs: Thoughts on Humans and Other Animals: Amazon.co.uk: John Gray: Books |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Will Self called the book "a contemporary work of philosophy devoid of jargon, wholly accessible, and profoundly relevant to the rapidly evolving world we live in" and wrote "I read it once, I read it twice and took notes. I arranged to meet its author so I could publicise the book – I thought it that good."&lt;ref name="independent" /&gt;&lt;ref name="amazon" /&gt;

In 2002 ''Straw Dogs'' was named a book of the year by J. G. Ballard in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''; by [[George Walden]] in ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]''; by Will Self, [[Joan Bakewell]], [[Jason Cowley]] and [[David Marquand]] in the ''[[New Statesman]]''; by [[Andrew Marr]] in ''[[The Observer]]''; by [[Jim Crace]] in ''[[The Times]]''; by Hugh Lawson Tancred in ''[[The Spectator]]''; by [[Richard Holloway]] in the ''[[Glasgow Herald]]''; and by [[Sue Cook]] in ''[[The Sunday Express]]''.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

[[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]] has written that John Gray is the modern thinker for whom he has the most respect, calling him "prophetic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grantabooks.com/page/3012/False+Dawn/1302 |title=Granta Books |publisher=Granta Books |date= |accessdate=2013-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Gray's ''Straw Dogs'' has been criticised by [[Terry Eagleton]], who has written: "mixing [[nihilism]] and [[New Age]]ism in equal measure, Gray scoffs at the notion of [[progress (history)|progress]] for 150 pages before conceding that there is something to be said for [[anaesthetics]]. The enemy in his sights is not so much a Straw Dog as a [[Straw Man]]: the kind of starry-eyed [[rationalist]] who passed away with [[John Stuart Mill]], but who he has to pretend still rules the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Terry Eagleton |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/sep/07/highereducation.news2 |title=Review: Straw Dogs by John Gray &amp;#124; Books |publisher=The Guardian |date=2002-09-07 |accessdate=2013-08-09 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The academic and author Danny Postel of the [[University of Denver]] also took issue with ''Straw Dogs''. Postel stated that Gray's claim that environmental destruction was the result of humanity's flawed nature would be "welcome news to the captains of industry and the architects of the global economy; the ecological devastation they leave in their wake, according to Gray, has nothing to do with their exploits."&lt;ref name="dp"&gt;{{cite web |first=Danny |last=Postel |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/grays-anatomy?page=0,0 |title=Gray's Anatomy |publisher=[[The Nation]] |date=22 December 2003 |accessdate= 25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postel also claimed that too much of ''Straw Dogs'' rested on "blanket assertion", and criticised Gray's use of the term "plague of people" as an outdated " [[neo-Malthusian]] persiflage about [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]]".&lt;ref name="dp" /&gt; Postel strongly condemned Gray for outlining "complete political passivity. There is no point whatsoever in our attempting to make the world a less cruel or more livable place."&lt;ref name="dp" /&gt;

==BBC Radio==

John Gray has made several broadcasts for [[BBC Radio 4]]'s programme ''A Point of View''.

In August and September 2011, he made six broadcasts:
*''Greece and the Meaning of Folly'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01391jt |title=BBC Radio 4 - A Point of View, Greece and the Meaning of Folly |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2011-08-21 |accessdate=2013-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking the myth of the [[Trojan Horse]] as his starting point, he explores what he sees as the modern-day folly unfolding in Europe.

'''Juan José Pérez Sebreli'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://buscardatos.com/personas.php?nombre=Perez%20Sebreli%20Juan%20Jose&amp;cuit=20-04346956-9 "Perez Sebreli Juan Jose"], ''BuscarDatos.com'', Retrieved 29 March 2017 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPA|seˈbɾɛli}}; born 3 November 1930) is an [[Argentine people|Argentine]] [[sociologist]], [[essayist]] and [[philosopher]]. Throughout his intellectual work, he concentrated on the notions of [[reason]], [[city]] and [[everyday life]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://talkingheads.wordpress.com/tag/juan-jose-sebreli/ Sebreli, el tiempo de una vida"], ''Parlante Posmodernidad'', Retrieved 24 July 2013 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Inspired by [[Gay Power]] movement, he was co-founder of [[Frente de Liberación Homosexual]] ("Gay Liberation Front") along with [[Manuel Puig]] and [[Néstor Perlongher]], in the last years of the self-called [[Argentine Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/mundos_intimos/Frente-Liberacion-Homosexual_0_863913741.html El Frente de Liberación Homosexual"], ''Clarín.com'', Retrieved 24 July 2013 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization of the group was an adaptation of the [[democratic centralist]] partisan model.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elortiba.org/perlongher.html Néstor Perlongher"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609073843/http://www.elortiba.org/perlongher.html |date=2010-06-09 }}, ''EL ORTIBA'', Retrieved 24 July 2013 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In years that followed the last [[Proceso de Reorganización Nacional|coup d'état]] he directed study groups that were called "Universidad de las Sombras" ("University of Shadows").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elaleph.com/libro/Los-deseos-imaginarios-del-peronismo-de-Juan-Jose-Sebreli/85309/ Los deseos imaginarios del peronismo"], ''elaleph.com'', Retrieved 25 July 2013 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; As suggested by its name, it had a secret status, which was a consequence of the [[Dirty War]], that is, political persecution and forced disappearance carried out by the military government, both being crimes against humanity.&lt;br&gt;
Sebreli is mainly known because of his past collaboration with cultural magazines, such as [[Contorno]] and [[Sur (magazine)|Sur]]. Nowadays he is columnist for [[La Nación]] and [[Perfil]] newspapers and [[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Ñ magazine]].
He engaged in several TV debates with [[Hugo Mujica]].

==Work==

===Populism===
In his work, Sebreli is radically critic of [[populism]]. His arguments are characterized by a sharp focus in the Argentine heterogeneous experiences of [[Peronism]], movement he describes as [[fascist]] in its core.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.revistaenie.clarin.com/ideas/filosofia/Argentina-populistas_0_812318771.html “Juan José Sebreli: “En la Argentina son todos populistas””], ''Revista Ñ'', Retrieved 24 July 2013 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He criticizes the figure of [[Juan Domingo Perón]], depicting him as an [[authoritarian]] and [[charismatic]] leader, thus making use of [[Weberian]] categories of thought. Sebreli states that the persistence of Peronism could be understood if one considers that, as a matter-of-fact, "there are sectors in the Argentine society that have a (pretended) lack of memory and are prone to self-deception". In one of his latest books ("''El malestar en la política''", 2012), he argues that [[Kirchnerism]] is a form of "latinoamerican neopopulism" and "plebiscitary caesarism", for it perfectly contrasts with a [[democratic republic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1585378-juan-jose-sebreli-estamos-en-un-fin-de-ciclo-pagando-el-fin-de-fiesta Juan José Sebreli: "Estamos en un fin de ciclo, pagando el fin de fiesta"], ''lanacion.com'', Retrieved 24 July 2013 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infobae.com/notas/713259-Juan-Jose-Sebreli-La-idea-de-ir-por-todo-es-tipicamente-totalitaria.html Juan José Sebreli: "La idea de ir por todo es típicamente totalitaria"], ''infobae'', Retrieved 24 July 2013 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irrationalism===
Sebreli is quite known due to his criticism of 'irrational' theoretical inquiries. His arguments are an effort to corrode the foundations of [[psychoanalysis]], and it is for that reason he labels such discipline as [[pseudoscience]], following [[Karl Popper]], as it lacks a proper scientific method.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pinchilonfonseca.wordpress.com/2006/10/26/jj-sebreli-contra-todos/ JJ Sebreli contra todos | Yo nací para esto], ''Pinchilón Fonseca'', Retrieved 24 July 2013 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He asserts that [[Schopenhauer]] is "the true father of modern irracionalism", and that along with [[Dostoievski]] and [[Nietzsche]] he contributed to the transformation of [[philosophy]] in [[art]], the [[aesthetics|aestheticization]] of life and thought.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elcultural.es/version_papel/LETRAS/21343/El_olvido_de_la_razon/ El olvido de la razón], ''El Cultural.es'', Retrieved 24 July 2013 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Existentialism===
Sebreli was member of the so-called “first Argentine [[existentialist]] group” along with [[Oscar Masotta]] and [[Carlos Correas]]. He introduced [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] into the academic milieux of his time.
Molded by the [[Hegelian]] and [[Marxist]] Left, he introduced the political thought of [[Alexandre Kojève]] and that of [[Tran Duc Thao]].

===Political ideology===
In 2002 he supported [[Ricardo López Murphy]] candidacy to presidency, something he later referred to as "situational."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lanacion.com.ar/493409-juan-jose-sebreli-en-las-elecciones-gano-el-que-vuelvan-todos Juan José Sebreli: "En las elecciones ganó el que vuelvan todos"], ''La Nación'', Retrieved 01 March 2018 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sebreli identified as [[social-democrat]], "in a European sense," and more recently as a [[left-liberal]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lanacion.com.ar/2099847-juan-jose-sebreli-si-se-pierde-esta-oportunidad-vuelve-seguro-el-populismo-mas-acerrimo Juan José Sebreli: "Si se pierde esta oportunidad, vuelve seguro el populismo más acérrimo"], ''La Nación'', Retrieved 01 March 2018 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Carnatic}}

The '''Kamalamba Navavarana Kritis''' by Shri [[Muthuswami Dikshitar]] (1776-1836) are some of the most famous pieces of music in the [[Carnatic music|Carnatic system of Indian classical music]]. They are treasures which embody not only the technical brilliance of the composer but also offer a peep into the [[Advaita Vedanta|advaitic school of Hindu philosophy]] and elements of [[Tantric rituals]]. They are very elaborate compositions which may be well compared with major symphonies in the Western system.

==Overview==
These songs are set in praise of the Goddess [[Kamalamba]] who is enshrined in [[Tiruvarur]] in the [[Tanjore district]] of [[Tamil Nadu]] in South India. The Goddess is the reference to the Divine Mother of the universe, or the Supreme Consciousness. The lyrics and the descriptive details are loaded with the mystical symbolism of the Vedantic (advaita) tradition and the chakras of the human system are closely linked to the evolutionary aspects described in the compositions that reflect the scholarly reach, musical depth and mystical significance of the composer. Navavarna refers to the 9 layers of the [[Sri Chakra]] yantra, one of the primary modes of Devi worship. Each avarna has a deity associated with it, which is mentioned in each of the songs.

Musically, they are par excellence and the majestic sweep of well known [[raga]]s (melodic forms) like [[Hanumatodi|Todi]], [[Mechakalyani|Kalyani]], [[Kambhoji]], [[Dheerasankarabharanam|Sankarabharanam]], [[Sahana ragam|Sahana]], [[Anandabhairavi]] and [[Bhairavi (ragam)|Bhairavi]] are offset against haunting melodies in lesser known ragas like [[Punnagavarali]], [[Ghanta]] and [[Ahiri]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.medieval.org/music/world/carnatic/lyrics/srao/kamala.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Dikshitar uses several [[Tala (music)|talas]] (time measures) although Rupakam (3 beats) seems to be his favourite. Ata talam (14 beats) and Misra Jampa (10 beats) in the Kambhoji and Bhairavi pieces are rarely used because of the technical difficulty in executing these. An added element is the use of different case endings (which Dikshitar uses in his other group krities, like the Abhayamba and Nilotpalamba set). The Dhyana (invocatory) kriti in Todi is in the vocative case, followed by the Anandabhairavi in the nominative, Kalyani in the accusative, Sankarabharanam in the instrumental, Kambhoji in the dative, Bhairavi in the ablative and so on. The ninth avarana kriti in Ahiri has all the cases; the raga itself has all the [[Śruti (music)|22 Sruti (notes)]] in the octave. It is believed that such a fusion of all melodic and temporal elements in the same kriti is a musical way of expressing the advaitic ideal of "aham Brahmasmi" or complete union with the Absolute. Indeed, the Ahiri composition is very unusual musically especially the [[pallavi]] which has a repeating and distinctive prose sections, are seamlessly put together.

The set concludes with a short and sweet mangalam (auspicious conclusion) in Sri ragam set in Khanda Ekam (5 beat talam). The entire set consists therefore of the dhyanam (invocation), the nine avaranas, and the mangalam (conclusion), a total of 11 pieces.

==Kritis==

The rendition of this classic cycle of compositions begin with an invocatory song on [[Lord Ganesha]] and [[Lord Muruga]].

# [[Sri Maha Ganapathi ravathu mam]] - Goula - Misra Chapu
# [[Balasubramanyam Bhajeham]] - Surutti - Adi.

The 11 [[kriti]]s are as follows:

# [[Kamalambike]] - Thodi - Rupakam (Dhyana Krithi)
# [[Kamalamba Samrakshathu]] - Anandabhairavi - Misra Chapu
# [[Kamalambaam Bhajare]] - Kalyani - Adi
# [[Sri Kamalambikaya Katakshitoham]] - Shankarabharanam - Rupakam
# [[Kamalambikayai]] - Kambhoji - (Khanda) Ata
# [[Sri Kamalambayah param]] - Bhairavi - Misra Jampa
# [[Kamalambikayaastava]] - Punnagavarali - Rupakam
# [[Sri Kamalambikayam]] - Sahana - Tisra Triputa
# [[Sri Kamalambike]] - Ghanta - Adi
# [[Sri Kamalamba Jayati]] - Ahiri - Rupakam
# [[Sri Kamalambike]] - Sri - Khanda Ekam (Mangala krithi)

One of the specialities of this group set is the usage of Vibhakti or [[declension]] of the noun "Kamalamba" i.e., "कमलांबा" in 8 cases like:

कमलांबा, कमलांबां, कमलांबिकया, कमलांबिकायै, कमलांबिकायाः, कमलांबिकायाः, कमलांबिकायां, कमलांबिके.

The Dhyana krithi, krithi for the eighth chakram, and Mangala krithi use the last declension. The Ahiri krithi can be decomposed so, to detail about the use of declensions of the noun.

Pallavi: 1st vibhakthi

Anupallavi: 
1st two lines - 2nd vibhakthi
Next two lines (Madhyama kala sahityam) - 3rd vibhakthi

Charanam:
1st line - 4th vibhakthi
2nd line - 5th vibhakthi
3rd line - 6th vibhakthi
4th line - 7th vibhakthi
Madhyama kala sahityam - 8th vibhakthi.

The rendering of these Kritis are considered to be extremely challenging owing to the complexity of the words and the notations. The D.K. Pattamal and D.K. Jayaraman school are considered to be specialists in the rendering of these compositions. It requires years of training to render them to perfection.

Sri Muthuswamy Dikshitar was a great Devi Upasaka and was well versed in all aspects of Sri Vidya Upasana. Out of his devotion to Sri Kamalamba, (one of the 64 Sakti Peethams in India), the celebrated deity at the famous Tyagaraja Temple in Tiruvarur and his compassion for all bhaktas, Sri Muthuswamy Dikshitar composed the Kamalamba Navavarana kritis, expounding in each of the nine kritis, the details of the each avarana of the [[Sri Chakra]], including the devatas and the yoginis. Singing these kritis with devotion, sraddha and understanding would be the easy way to Sri Vidya Upasana.

He was also lector at the theological [[Kampen Theological University of the Reformed Churches (Liberated)]] from 1972 until 1987, when he became special professor at the same university ([[dissertation]]: ''Methodologie en de grondslagen van een pluriforme sociologie'' (methodology and the foundations of a pluriform sociology)).

In 1988 Veling became vice rector of the reformed high school-group ''Prof.dr. S. Greijdanus'' in [[Zwolle]] for seven years. From 11 June 1991 until 12 November 2002 Veling was member of the Dutch Parliament. Until 16 May 2002 he was member of the First Chamber (Senate) of the Parliament, the rest of the time member of the Second Chamber and president of the fraction of the Christen Union.

It was co-founded by two musicians, [[reggae]] artist [[Sams’K Le Jah]] and [[Hip hop|rapper]] [[Serge Bambara]] ("Smockey") in the Summer of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moussaoui|first=Rosa|date=3 November 2014|title=Sams’K Le Jah «Les héritiers de Sankara ont grandi, il faut désormais compter avec eux»|language=French|url=https://www.humanite.fr/samsk-le-jah-les-heritiers-de-sankara-ont-grandi-il-faut-desormais-compter-avec-eux-556408|newspaper=[[L'Humanité]]|location=[[Paris]]|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mackey|first=Robert|date=31 October 2014|title=Street-Level Views of the Protests in Burkina Faso|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/01/world/africa/street-level-views-of-the-protests-in-burkina-faso.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|location=[[New York City]]|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They organized several protests in early 2014, for example hosting a joint rally with the newly formed Movement of People for Progress, filling a 35,000-capacity sports stadium to its rafters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theglobalobservatory.org/2014/11/burkina-faso-harnessing-revolution/|title=Burkina Faso and the Harnessing of a Revolution|last=Cummings|first=Ryan|date=5 November 2014|website=www.theglobalobservatory.org|publisher=[[International Peace Institute]]|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When the October [[2014 Burkinabé uprising]] broke out the group became a prominent part of the protests, its activists gaining note due to their presence on the streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=David|date=2 November 2014|title='One game too far': the downfall of Burkina Faso's president|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/02/us-burkina-politics-compaore-idUSKBN0IM0FL20141102|newspaper=[[Reuters]]|location=[[London]]|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Compaoré was forced to resign and flee the country on 31 October, after 27 years of rule. The presidency was subsequently occupied by the [[Military of Burkina Faso|military]], which named the pro-protest officer [[Yacouba Isaac Zida]] as the country's interim leader. Le Balai Citoyen, which launched a symbolic sweeping of [[Ouagadougou]]'s streets following Compaoré's departure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|title=Après avoir chassé le Président, le « balai citoyen » du Burkina nettoie les rues de Ouagadougou|language=French|url=http://rue89.nouvelobs.com/2014/11/03/apres-avoir-chasse-president-balai-citoyen-burkina-nettoie-les-rues-ouagadougou-255841|newspaper=[[Rue89]]|location=[[Paris]]|date=3 November 2014|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been reported to be supportive of Zida's transitional rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date=1 November 2014|title=Lt.

The movement is part of the Burkinabé [[Sankarism|Sankarist]] political tradition, appealing to the legacy and ideals of Captain [[Thomas Sankara]], a radical left-wing revolutionary who ruled the country from 1983 until his death in 1987, killed during a coup orchestrated by his successor Compaoré. Co-founder Sams’K Le Jah received his political education in the [[Pioneers of the Revolution]], the youth movement of Sankara's "Democratic and Popular Revolution".&lt;ref name="BBC1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Duval Smith|first=Alex|date=30 April 2014|title='Africa's Che Guevara': Thomas Sankara's legacy|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-27219307|newspaper=[[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]]|location=[[London]]|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement is named both in reference to "sweeping out" perceived [[political corruption]], and to the regular street-cleaning exercises – initiated by Thomas Sankara – in which citizens would pick up brooms and clean their neighbourhoods, both an act of [[community development]] and a metaphor for societal self-sufficiency. Members carry brooms during protests as a symbol of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|title=With Brooms and Spatulas, a President for Life is Ousted|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2014/11/with-brooms-and-spatulas-a-president-for-life-is-ousted/|newspaper=[[Inter Press Service]]|location=[[Rome]]|date=3 November 2014|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kalinaki|first=Daniel K.|date=1 November 2014|title=Burkina Faso: End of the ‘error’ of Africa’s strongman rule?|url=http://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/news/Burkina-Faso-End-of-the-error-of-Africa-strongman-rule/-/2558/2507638/-/item/2/-/7rbqetz/-/index.html|newspaper=[[The EastAfrican]]|location=[[Kenya]]|accessdate= 8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spread of the Movement ==
Le Balai Citoyen was spread throughout Burkina Faso mostly by Burkinabé youth, as young people (&lt;25 years of age) constitute 65% of Burkina Faso's population.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Henry|first=Vincent|date=September 2015|title=Mouvements Citoyens Engages en Afrique de L'Ouest; Le Cas du Burkina Faso/Public-Spirited Movements in Western Africa; The Example of Burkina Faso|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1726777338/fulltext/925A5A0261CF4F12PQ/1?accountid=13679|journal=Studia Europia|volume=60|pages=57-72|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frère|first=Marie-Soleil|date=April 2015|title=Briefing: Burkina Faso—the Fall of Blaise Compaoré|url=|journal=African Affairs|volume=114|pages=295-307|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://classe-internationale.com/2018/01/04/les-mouvements-de-jeunesse-en-afrique-le-cas-de-balai-citoyen-au-burkina-faso/|title=Les mouvements de jeunesse en Afrique : le cas de Balai Citoyen au Burkina Faso|date=2018-01-04|work=Classe Internationale|access-date=2018-05-03|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smockey and SamsK Le Jah were influenced by movements like Y'en a Marre in Senegal and the Black Power movement in the United States.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://africasacountry.com/2014/10/the-citizens-of-burkina-faso/|title=The Upright Citizens of Burkina Faso|access-date=2018-05-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the two artists spread their political messages to the youth through music broadcast on the radio.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2016/1/28/burkina-faso-a-rappers-role-in-revolution.html|title=The soundtrack to Burkina Faso's revolution|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; They continued to spread their messages at politically involved concerts with many attendees.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Smockey and SamsK Le Jah were able to use their popularity to expand the reaches of their message.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Le Balai Citoyen quickly gained public recognition and was endorsed by influential public figures such as Burkinabé lawyer Guy Hervé Kam. This was accompanied by a rise in young figures speaking out against the current political regime. Thomas Sankara was used as a motivational symbol to bring people together for this movement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Smockey and SamsK Le Jah worked hard to further advance the movement by hosting conferences and meeting with influential figures, rural community members, and students from across the country. People were encouraged to participate in their local Balais Citoyen clubs, and learn the purpose of the movement.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Marches and Civic Engagement ==
Le Balai Citoyen focuses on all aspects of justice and civil rights through community involvement. Directly after its inception in 2013, members participated in several outreach programs and calls to action. On August 12th 2013, the movement put on a commemoration ceremony to honor Thomas Sankara and [[Norbert Zongo]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lebalaicitoyen.com/m-15-qui-sommes-nous.html|title=Qui sommes nous - Le Balai Citoyen|website=www.lebalaicitoyen.com|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between May and June 2014, Le Balai Citoyen held several sit-ins in both Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso, the second largest city in the country. One of the sit-ins occurred at hospital in Bobo-Dioulasso (l'Hopital Sanou Souro) urging officials to renovate the establishment. Another took place in front of Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso's electricity provider SONABEL for better electricity services. One more took place in front of Bobo-Dioulasso's town hall.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 

In October 2014, Blaise Compaoré put forth an amendment to the constitution known as Article 37 and called for a referendum. This amendment would grant him an extension to his presidency.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hagberg|first=Sten|last2=Kibora|first2=Ludovic|last3=Ouattara|first3=Fatoumata|last4=Konkobo|first4=Adjara|date=2015-09-01|title=Au cœur de la révolution burkinabè|url=http://journals.openedition.org/anthropodev/499|journal=Anthropologie &amp; développement|language=fr|issue=42-43|pages=199–224|doi=10.4000/anthropodev.499|issn=2276-2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; L'inserrection Populaire (English: The Popular Insurrection) manifested between October 27th-31st as the public's response to the referendum. In this period Le Balai Citoyen collaborated with Collectif des Femmes pour la Défense de la Constitution (English: Women's Collective for the Defense of the Constitution), Le Collectif anti-referendum (English: The Anti-referendum Collective), and more to protest in the streets. Individuals from all groups carried brooms and spatulas as they marched, to symbolize the sweeping out of the regime.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 

Le Balai Citoyen has also participated in many community service ventures. In 2014 they organized a public service cleaning day for a maternity ward in Ouagadougou (Maternité Pogbi) and arranged a blood drive in both Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; They also opened up an international fundraising campaign for Yalgado, the largest public hospital in Ouagadougou.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In more recent years, the movement has been focused on expressing solidarity with other African nations experiencing political turmoil.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Initially supporting the [[Menshevik Internationalists]] faction within the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]], he joined the [[Bolsheviks]] ("majority") just before the 1917 [[October Revolution]], immediately becoming a leader within the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]]. He would go on to become one of the seven members of the first [[Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee|Politburo]], founded in 1917 to manage the Bolshevik Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Dmitri Volkogonov, ''Lenin.

During the early days of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (RSFSR) and the Soviet Union, he served first as [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs]] and later as the founder and commander of the [[Red Army]], with the title of [[People's Commissar of Military and Naval Affairs of the Russian SFSR|People's Commissar of Military and Naval Affairs]]. He became a major figure in the Bolshevik victory in the [[Russian Civil War]] (1918–1922).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swain|first1=Geoffrey|title=Trotsky and the Russian Civil War|journal=Reinterpreting Revolutionary Russia|date=2006|pages=86–104|doi=10.1057/9780230624924_6|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9780230624924_6|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan, London|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After leading a failed struggle of the [[Left Opposition]] against the policies and [[rise of Joseph Stalin]] in the 1920s and against the increasing role of [[Bureaucratic collectivism|bureaucracy in the Soviet Union]], Trotsky was removed as Commissar for Military and Naval Affairs (January 1925), removed from the Politburo (October 1926), removed from the Central Committee (October 1927), expelled from the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] (November 1927), exiled to [[Almaty|Alma–Ata]] (January 1928), and exiled from the Soviet Union (February 1929). As the head of the [[Fourth International]], Trotsky continued to oppose the Stalinist bureaucracy in the Soviet Union while in exile.

Trotsky was assassinated in Mexico City by [[Ramón Mercader]], a Spanish-born [[NKVD]] agent. On 20 August 1940, Mercader attacked Trotsky with an [[ice axe]] and Trotsky died the next day in a hospital. Mercader acted upon instruction from Stalin and was nearly beaten to death by Trotsky's bodyguards, and spent the next 20 years in a Mexican prison for the murder. Stalin presented Mercader with an [[Order of Lenin]] in absentia.&lt;ref&gt;The murder weapon was a cut-down [[ice axe]], not an [[ice pick]]. Many history and reference books have confused the two. See Robert Conquest, ''The Great Terror: A Reassessment,'' Oxford University Press, 1991; {{ISBN|0-19-507132-8}}, pg. 418 for a detailed account&lt;/ref&gt;

Trotsky's ideas formed the basis of [[Trotskyism]], a major school of Marxist thought that opposes the theories of [[Stalinism]]. He was written out of the history books under Stalin, and was one of the few Soviet political figures who was not [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]] by the government under [[Nikita Khrushchev]] in the 1950s.

==Childhood and family (1879–1895)==
[[File:Leo Trotzki 1888.jpg|thumb|upright|left|8-year-old Lev Bronstein, 1888]]

Leon Trotsky was born Lev Davidovich Bronstein on 7 November 1879, the fifth child of a [[Ukrainian-Jewish]] family of wealthy farmers in Yanovka or Yanivka, in the [[Kherson Governorate|Kherson governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]] (now [[Bereslavka, Ukraine|Bereslavka]], in [[Ukraine]]), a small village {{convert|15|mi|km|order=flip}} from the nearest post office. His parents were David Leontyevich Bronstein (1847–1922) and his wife Anna Lvovna (née Zhivotovskaya) (1850–1910). Trotsky's father was born in [[Poltava]], and later moved to [[Bereslavka, Ukraine|Bereslavka]] as it had a large Jewish community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://focus.ua/news/9045/|title=Наш Троцкий - ФОКУС|website=ФОКУС|language=Ukrainian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last=Deutscher|first=Isaac |title=The Prophet Armed Trotsky: 1879–1921|year=1970|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-281064-2|pages=6–7|authorlink=Isaac Deutscher}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language spoken at home was a mixture of Russian and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] (known as [[Surzhyk]]).&lt;ref&gt;North, David (2010). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=mVqvouA22IkC&amp;pg=PA144&amp;dq=%22david+north%22+yiddish&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=l-geU6yVD-jX0QW8oIGwCw&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22david%20north%22%20yiddish&amp;f=false In Defense of Leon Trotsky],'' Mehring Books, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; Trotsky's younger sister, [[Olga Kameneva|Olga]], who also grew up to be a [[Bolshevik]] and a Soviet politician, married the prominent Bolshevik [[Lev Kamenev]].&lt;ref name="ch3" /&gt;

Some authors, notably [[Robert Service (historian)|Robert Service]], have also claimed that Trotsky's childhood first name was the [[Yiddish]] "Leiba". The American [[Trotskyist]] [[David North (socialist)|David North]] said that this was an assumption from Trotsky's Jewish origins but that, contrary to Service's claims, there is no documentary evidence to support him using a Yiddish name, when that language was not spoken by his family.&lt;ref name="nor_def"&gt;David North, ''In Defence of Leon Trotsky'' (2010); {{ISBN|978-1-893638-05-1}}, pp. 144-46.&lt;/ref&gt; Both North and [[Walter Laqueur]] in their books say that Trotsky's childhood name was "Lyova", a standard Russian diminutive of the name "Lev."&lt;ref name="lac90"&gt;Walter Laqueur, ''Stalin: The Glasnost Revelations'', pp. 59-60&lt;/ref&gt; North has compared the speculation on Trotsky's given name to the undue emphasis given to him having a Jewish surname.&lt;ref name=nor_def/&gt;&lt;ref name=lac90/&gt; 

When Trotsky was eight,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Leon-Trotsky|title=Leon Trotsky - Biography, Books, Assassination, &amp; Facts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; his father sent him to [[Odessa]] to be educated. He was enrolled in a German-language school, which became Russified during his years in Odessa as a result of the Imperial government's policy of [[Russification]].&lt;ref name="Lindemann2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Albert S. Lindemann|title=Esau's Tears: Modern Anti-Semitism and the Rise of the Jews|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NagdhSUgB9oC&amp;pg=PA446|accessdate=26 September 2013|date=4 December 2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-79538-8|page=446}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Isaac Deutscher]] notes in his biography of Trotsky, Odessa was then a bustling cosmopolitan port city, very unlike the typical Russian city of the time. This environment contributed to the development of the young man's international outlook.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Isaac Deutscher, ''The Prophet Armed, 1879–1921'', Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Trotsky spoke French, English and German to a good standard, he said in his autobiography ''[[My Life (Leon Trotsky autobiography)|My Life]]'' that he was never perfectly fluent in any language but Russian and Ukrainian, while [[Raymond Molinier]] wrote that Trotsky spoke French fluently.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.revolutionary-history.co.uk/supplem/bronstei.htm "On Meeting with Trotsky"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070604005522/http://www.revolutionary-history.co.uk/supplem/bronstei.htm|date=4 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early political activities and life (1896–1917) ==

=== Revolutionary activity and imprisonment (1896–1898) ===
[[File:LeonTrotsky1897.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Lev Davidovich Bronstein, 1897]]

Trotsky became involved in revolutionary activities in 1896 after moving to the harbor town of Nikolayev (now [[Mykolaiv]]) on the Ukrainian coast of the [[Black Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Deutscher, ''The Prophet Armed: Trotsky, 1879–1921'', p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; At first a ''[[narodnik]]'' (revolutionary [[Agrarian socialism|agrarian socialist]] [[populism|populist]]), he initially opposed [[Marxism]] but was won over to Marxism later that year by his future first wife, [[Aleksandra Sokolovskaya]]. Instead of pursuing a mathematics degree, Trotsky helped organize the South Russian Workers' Union in Nikolayev in early 1897. Using the name 'Lvov,'&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;chapter XVII of his autobiography, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch07.htm ''My Life''], Marxist Internet Archive&lt;/ref&gt; he wrote and printed leaflets and proclamations, distributed revolutionary pamphlets, and popularized socialist ideas among industrial workers and revolutionary students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Trotsky (Life &amp; Times)|last=Renton|first=Dave|publisher=HAUS PUBLISHING LIMITED|year=2004|isbn=1904341624|location=Cadogan Court Draycott Avenue, London, SW3 3BX|pages=22–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1898, more than 200 members of the union, including Trotsky, were arrested. He was held for the next two years in prison awaiting trial, first in Nikolayev, then [[Kherson]], then [[Odessa]], and finally in Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;Commission of Inquiry into the Charges Made Against Leon Trotsky in the Moscow Trials,&amp;nbsp;''The Case of Leon Trotsky''&amp;nbsp;(1937, reprinted 1968).&lt;/ref&gt; In the Moscow prison he came into contact with other revolutionaries and heard about Lenin and read Lenin's book, ''[[The Development of Capitalism in Russia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Deutscher, ''The Prophet Armed, 1879–1921'', pg. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Two months into his imprisonment, on 1–3 March 1898, the first Congress of the newly formed [[Russian Social Democratic Labor Party]] (RSDLP) was held.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Shapiro, ''The Communist Party of the Soviet Union'' (Vintage Books: New York, 1971), pg. 645.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; From then on Trotsky identified as a member of the party.

===First marriage and Siberian exile (1899–1902)===
{{main|First exile of Trotsky}}
While in the prison in Moscow, in the summer of 1899, Trotsky married [[Aleksandra Sokolovskaya]] (1872–1938), a fellow Marxist.  The wedding ceremony was performed by a Jewish chaplain.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Deutscher, ''The Prophet Armed: Trotsky, 1879–1921'', pg. 42.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900, he was sentenced to four years in exile in [[Siberia]]. Because of their marriage, Trotsky and his wife were allowed to be exiled to the same location in Siberia. They were exiled to [[Ust-Kut]] and the Verkholensk in the [[Baikal Lake]] region of [[Siberia]].  They had two daughters, [[Zinaida Volkova|Zinaida]] (1901 – 5 January 1933) and Nina (1902 – 9 June 1928), both born in Siberia.

In Siberia, Trotsky studied philosophy.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Robert D. Warth,&amp;nbsp;''Leon Trotsky''&amp;nbsp;(1977).&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2018}} He became aware of the differences within the party, which had been decimated by arrests in 1898 and 1899. Some social democrats known as "economists" argued that the party should focus on helping industrial workers improve their lot in life and were not so worried about changing the government.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Shapiro, ''The Communist Party of the Soviet Union'', pp. 31–32.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

They believed that societal reforms would grow out of the worker's struggle for higher pay and better working conditions. Others argued that overthrowing the monarchy was more important and that a well-organized and disciplined revolutionary party was essential. The latter position was expressed by the London-based newspaper ''[[Iskra]],'' or in English, ''The Spark,'' which was founded in 1900. Trotsky quickly sided with the ''Iskra'' position and began writing for the paper.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Deutscher, ''The Prophet Armed: Trotsky, 1879–1921'' (Vintage Books: New York, 1965) pg. 67.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1902, at the urging of his wife, Trotsky escaped from Siberia hidden in a load of hay on a wagon.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Deutscher, ''The Prophet Armed: Trotsky, 1879–1921'', pg. 55.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Aleksandra later escaped from Siberia with their daughters.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2018}} Both daughters married and Zinaida had children, but the daughters died before their parents. Nina Nevelson died from [[tuberculosis]], cared for in her last months by her older sister. Zinaida Volkova died after following her father into exile in [[Berlin]]. She had taken her son by her second marriage, and left her daughter in Russia. Suffering also from tuberculosis, then a fatal disease, and [[Mood disorder|depression]], Volkova committed suicide. Their mother Aleksandra disappeared in 1935 during the [[Great Purge]]s in the Soviet Union under Stalin, and was murdered by Stalinist forces three years later.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Thatcher, Ian D.&amp;nbsp;''Trotsky''.

=== First emigration and second marriage (1902–1903) ===
{{Socialism sidebar}}
Until this point in his life, Trotsky had used his birth name: Lev (Leon) Bronstein.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Deutscher, ''The Prophet Armed: Trotsky 1879–1921'', p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; He changed his surname to "Trotsky"—the name he would use for the rest of his life. It is said he adopted the name of a jailer of the Odessa prison in which he had earlier been held.&lt;ref&gt;cf, for instance, [http://www.bartleby.com/65/tr/Trotsky.html "Leon Trotsky"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314102048/http://www.bartleby.com/65/tr/Trotsky.html |date=14 March 2009 }}, ''The Columbia Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt; This became his primary revolutionary pseudonym. After his escape from Siberia, Trotsky moved to London, joining [[Georgi Plekhanov]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Julius Martov]] and other editors of ''Iskra''. Under the pen name ''Pero'' ("feather" or "pen" in Russian), Trotsky soon became one of the paper's leading writers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Unknown to Trotsky, the six editors of ''Iskra'' were evenly split between the "old guard" led by [[Georgi Plekhanov|Plekhanov]] and the "new guard" led by [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] and [[Julius Martov|Martov]]. Plekhanov's supporters were older (in their 40s and 50s), and had spent the previous 20 years together in exile in Europe. Members of the new guard were in their early 30s and had only recently emigrated from Russia. Lenin, who was trying to establish a permanent majority against Plekhanov within ''Iskra,'' expected Trotsky, then 23, to side with the new guard.

In March 1903 Lenin wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in chapter XII of [http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch12.htm 'My Life'], Marxist Internet Archive&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|I suggest to all the members of the editorial board that they co-opt 'Pero' as a member of the board on the same basis as other members. [...] We very much need a seventh member, both as a convenience in voting (six being an even number), and as an addition to our forces. 'Pero' has been contributing to every issue for several months now; he works in general most energetically for the Iskra; he gives lectures (in which he has been very successful). In the section of articles and notes on the events of the day, he will not only be very useful, but absolutely necessary. Unquestionably a man of rare abilities, he has conviction and energy, and he will go much farther.}}

Because of Plekhanov's opposition, Trotsky did not become a full member of the board. But, from then on he participated in its meetings in an advisory capacity, which earned him Plekhanov's enmity.

In late 1902, Trotsky met [[Natalia Sedova]], who soon became his companion. They married in 1903 and she was with him until his death. They had two children together, [[Lev Sedov]] (24 February 1906 – 16 February 1938) and [[Sergei Sedov]] (21 March 1908 – 29 October 1937), both of whom would predecease their parents. Regarding his sons' surnames, Trotsky later explained that after the 1917 revolution:&lt;ref&gt;Trotsky's [http://www.themilitant.com/2003/6735/673549.html 'Thermidor and anti-Semitism' (1937)]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|In order not to oblige my sons to change their name, I, for "citizenship" requirements, took on the name of my wife.}}

Trotsky never used the name "Sedov" either privately or publicly. Natalia Sedova sometimes signed her name "Sedova-Trotskaya".

===Split with Lenin (1903–1904)===
In the meantime, after a period of secret police repression and internal confusion that followed the [[1st Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|First Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] in 1898, ''Iskra'' succeeded in convening the party's [[2nd Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|Second Congress]] in London in August 1903. Trotsky and other ''Iskra'' editors attended. The first congress went as planned, with ''Iskra'' supporters handily defeating the few "economist" delegates. Then the congress discussed the position of the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Jewish Bund]], which had co-founded the [[RSDLP]] in 1898 but wanted to remain autonomous within the party.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Trotsky, Leon.&amp;nbsp;''My life: an attempt at an autobiography''. Courier Corporation, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly thereafter, the pro-''Iskra'' delegates split into two factions. Lenin and his supporters, the Bolsheviks, argued for a smaller but highly organized party, while Martov and his supporters, the [[Menshevik]]s, argued for a larger and less disciplined party. In a surprise development, Trotsky and most of the ''Iskra'' editors supported Martov and the Mensheviks, while Plekhanov supported Lenin and the Bolsheviks. During 1903 and 1904, many members changed sides in the factions. Plekhanov soon parted ways with the Bolsheviks. Trotsky left the Mensheviks in September 1904 over their insistence on an alliance with Russian liberals and their opposition to a reconciliation with Lenin and the Bolsheviks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cavendish|first=Richard|year=2003|title=The Bolshevik–Menshevik Split|url=http://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/bolshevik-menshevik-split|magazine=History Today|volume=53|number=11|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1904 until 1917, Trotsky described himself as a "non-factional social democrat". He worked between 1904 and 1917 trying to reconcile different groups within the party, which resulted in many clashes with Lenin and other prominent party members. Trotsky later maintained that he had been wrong in opposing Lenin on the issue of the party. During these years, Trotsky began developing his theory of [[permanent revolution]], and developed a close working relationship with [[Alexander Parvus]] in 1904–07.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://bv8ja7kw5x.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%253Aofi%252Fenc%253AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info%253Asid%252Fsummon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%253Aofi%252Ffmt%253Akev%253Amtx%253Ajournal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Parvus%252C+Luxemburg+and+Kautsky+on+the+1905+Russian+Revolution%253A+The+Relationship+with+Trotsky&amp;rft.jtitle=The+Australian+Journal+of+Politics+and+History&amp;rft.au=Weber%252C+Nicholas+S&amp;rft.date=1975-12-01&amp;rft.pub=University+of+Queensland+Press&amp;rft.issn=0004-9522&amp;rft.eissn=1467-8497&amp;rft.volume=21&amp;rft.issue=3&amp;rft.spage=39&amp;paramdict=en-AU|title=Parvus, Luxemburg and Kautsky on the 1905 Russian Revolution: The Relationship with Trotsky|last=Weber|first=Nicholas|date=1975|journal=Australian Journal of Politics and History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During their split, Lenin referred to Trotsky as a "[[Judas Iscariot|Judas]]",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1911/jan/02.htm Lenin: "Judas Trotsky's Blush of Shame"], Marxists Internet Archive; retrieved 26 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; a "scoundrel"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/history/international/comintern/sections/britain/periodicals/communist_review/1950/01/x01.htm CPGB: Stalin: "Slander and Truth"], Marxists Internet Archive; retrieved 26 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and a "swine".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/feb/17ak.htm Lenin: 123.

===1905 revolution and trial (1905–1906)===
The unrest and agitation against the Russian government came to a head in [[Saint Petersburg]] on 3 January 1905 ([[Julian Calendar]]), when a strike broke out at the [[Putilov Works]] in the city. This single strike grew into a general strike and by 7 January 1905, there were 140,000 strikers in Saint Petersburg.&lt;ref&gt;Leon Trotsky, ''1905'' (Vintage Books: New York, 1971), pg. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

On Sunday, 9 January 1905, Father [[Georgi Gapon]] led a peaceful procession of citizens through the streets to the [[Winter Palace]] to beseech the Tsar for food and relief from the oppressive government. The Palace Guard fired on the peaceful demonstration, resulting in the deaths of some 1,000 demonstrators. Sunday, 9 January 1905, became known as [[Bloody Sunday (1905)|Bloody Sunday]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

[[File:Trotskymugshots.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|left|Police mugshots of Trotsky in 1905 after Soviet members were arrested during a meeting in Free Economic Society building]]

Following the events of Bloody Sunday, Trotsky secretly returned to Russia in February 1905, by way of [[Kiev]].&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Deutscher, ''The Prophet Armed: Trotsky 1879–1921'' p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;  At first he wrote leaflets for an underground printing press in Kiev, but soon moved to the capital, Saint Petersburg. There he worked with both Bolsheviks, such as Central Committee member [[Leonid Krasin]], and the local Menshevik committee, which he pushed in a more radical direction. The latter, however, were betrayed by a secret police agent in May, and Trotsky had to flee to rural [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Finland]]. There he worked on fleshing out his theory of permanent revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Leon Trotsky, "Results and Prospects," in ''Permanent Revolution'' (Pathfinder Press: New York, 1969) pp. 27–122.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 September 1905, the typesetters at the [[Ivan Sytin]]'s printing house in Moscow went out on strike for shorter hours and higher pay. By the evening of 24 September, the workers at 50 other printing shops in Moscow were also on strike. On 2 October 1905, the typesetters in printing shops in Saint Petersburg decided to strike in support of the Moscow strikers. On 7 October 1905, the railway workers of the [[Moscow-Kazan Railway|Moscow–Kazan Railway]] went out on strike.&lt;ref&gt;Leon Trotsky, ''1905'', p. 85–88.&lt;/ref&gt; Amid the resulting confusion, Trotsky returned from Finland to Saint Petersburg on 15 October 1905.  On that day, Trotsky spoke before the Saint Petersburg Soviet Council of Workers Deputies, which was meeting at the Technological Institute in the city. Also attending were some 200,000 people crowded outside to hear the speeches—about 50% of all workers in Saint Petersburg.&lt;ref name="Isaac Deutscher p. 126"&gt;Isaac Deutscher, ''The Prophet Armed: Trotsky, 1879–1921'', p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

After his return, Trotsky and [[Parvus]] took over the newspaper ''Russian Gazette,'' increasing its circulation to 500,000. Trotsky also co-founded, together with Parvus and [[Julius Martov]] and other Mensheviks, ''Nachalo'' ("The Beginning"), which also proved to be a very successful newspaper in the revolutionary atmosphere of Saint Petersburg in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Deutscher, ''The Prophet Armed: Trotsky, 1879–1921'', pp. 138–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Just before Trotsky's return, the Mensheviks had independently come up with the same idea that Trotsky had: an elected non-party revolutionary organization representing the capital's workers, the first [[Soviet (council)|Soviet]] ("Council") of Workers. By the time of Trotsky's arrival, the [[Saint Petersburg Soviet]] was already functioning headed by [[Khrustalyev-Nosar]] (Georgy Nosar, alias Pyotr Khrustalyov). Khrustalyev-Nosar had been a compromise figure when elected as the head of the Saint Petersburg Soviet. Khrustalev-Nosar was a lawyer that stood above the political factions contained in the Soviet.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Deutscher, ''The Prophet Armed: Trotsky, 1879–1921'', p. 131.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

However, since his election, he proved to be very popular with the workers in spite of the Bolsheviks' original opposition to him. Khrustalev-Nosar became famous in his position as spokesman for the Saint Petersburg Soviet.&lt;ref&gt;Leon Trotsky, ''1905'', pg. 218.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, to the outside world, Khrustalev-Nosar was the embodiment of the Saint Petersburg Soviet.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Deutscher, ''The Prophet Armed: Trotsky, 1879–1921'', pg. 131.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Trotsky joined the Soviet under the name "Yanovsky" (after the village he was born in, Yanovka) and was elected vice-chairman. He did much of the actual work at the Soviet and, after Khrustalev-Nosar's arrest on 26 November 1905, was elected its chairman. On 2 December, the Soviet issued a proclamation which included the following statement about the Tsarist government and its foreign debts:&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Chapter XIV of [http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch14.htm ''My Life'']&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quote|The autocracy never enjoyed the confidence of the people and was never granted any authority by the people. We have therefore decided not to allow the repayment of such loans as have been made by the Tsarist government when openly engaged in a war with the entire people.}}

The following day, the Soviet was surrounded by troops loyal to the government and the deputies were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;Leon Trotsky, ''1905'', pp.231–233.&lt;/ref&gt; Trotsky and other Soviet leaders were tried in 1906 on charges of supporting an armed rebellion. On 4 October 1906 he was convicted and sentenced to internal exile to Siberia.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Second emigration (1907–1914)===
[[File:ParvusTrotskiDeich.jpg|thumb|Trotsky with [[Alexander Parvus]] (left) and [[Leo Deutsch]] (right) in prison in 1906]]

While en route to exile in [[Salekhard|Obdorsk]], Siberia, in January 1907, Trotsky escaped at [[Beryozovo|Berezov]]&lt;ref&gt;Chapter XXIII of [http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch17.htm ''1905'']&lt;/ref&gt; and once again made his way to London. He attended the [[5th Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|5th Congress of the RSDLP]]. In October, he moved to [[Vienna]], Austria-Hungary. For the next seven years, he often took part in the activities of the [[Austrian Social Democratic Party]] and, occasionally, of the [[German Social Democratic Party]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In Vienna, Trotsky became close to [[Adolph Joffe]], his friend for the next 20 years, who introduced him to [[psychoanalysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Chapter XVII of [http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch17.htm ''My Life''], Marxist Internet Archive; retrieved  31 January 2018.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1908 he was asked to join the editorial staff of ''[[Pravda]]'' ("Truth"), a bi-weekly, Russian-language social democratic paper for Russian workers, which he co-edited with [[Adolph Joffe]] and [[Matvey Skobelev]]. It was smuggled into Russia.&lt;ref name="Isaac Deutscher p. 191"&gt;Isaac Deutscher, ''The Prophet Armed: Trotsky, 1879–1921'', p. 191.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The paper appeared very irregularly; only five issues were published in its first year.&lt;ref name="Isaac Deutscher p. 191"/&gt;

Avoiding factional politics, the paper proved popular with Russian industrial workers. Both the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks split multiple times after the failure of the 1905–1907 revolution. Money was very scarce for publication of ''Pravda.'' Trotsky approached the Russian Central Committee to seek financial backing for the newspaper throughout 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Deutscher, ''The Prophet Armed: Trotsky 1879–1921'', pg. 192.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Central Committee in 1910 was controlled by a majority of Bolsheviks. Lenin agreed to the financing of ''Pravda'', but required a Bolshevik be appointed as co-editor of the paper.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Deutscher, ''The Prophet Armed: Trotsky, 1879–1921'', pg. 192.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; When various Bolshevik and Menshevik factions tried to re-unite at the January 1910 RSDLP Central Committee meeting in Paris over Lenin's objections,&lt;ref&gt;V.I. Lenin, "Towards Unity," in ''Lenin Collected Works: Volume 16'', Progress Publishers: Moscow, 1974, pp. 147–55.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Trotsky's ''Pravda'' was made a party-financed 'central organ'. [[Lev Kamenev]], Trotsky's brother-in-law, was added to the editorial board from the Bolsheviks, but the unification attempts failed in August 1910. Kamenev resigned from the board amid mutual recriminations. Trotsky continued publishing ''Pravda'' for another two years until it finally folded in April 1912.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The Bolsheviks started a new workers-oriented newspaper in Saint Petersburg on 22 April 1912, and also called it ''Pravda''. Trotsky was so upset by what he saw as a usurpation of his newspaper's name that in April 1913 he wrote a letter to [[Nikolay Chkheidze]], a Menshevik leader, bitterly denouncing Lenin and the Bolsheviks. Though he quickly got over the disagreement, the letter was intercepted by the Russian police, and a copy was put into their archives. Shortly after Lenin's death in 1924, the letter was found and publicized by Trotsky's opponents within the Communist Party to portray him as Lenin's enemy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The 1910s was a period of heightened tension within the RSDLP, leading to numerous frictions between Trotsky, the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks. The most serious disagreement that Trotsky and the Mensheviks had with Lenin at the time was over the issue of "expropriations",&lt;ref&gt;Chapter XVI of [http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch16.htm ''My Life'']&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., armed robbery of banks and other companies by Bolshevik groups to procure money for the Party. These actions had been banned by the 5th Congress, but were continued by the Bolsheviks.

In January 1912, the majority of the Bolshevik faction, led by Lenin, as well as a few defecting Mensheviks, held a conference in [[Prague]] and decided to break away from the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]], and formed a new party, the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks)]]. In response, Trotsky organized a "unification" conference of social democratic factions in Vienna in August 1912 (a.k.a. "The August Bloc") and tried to re-unite the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks into one party. The attempt was generally unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In Vienna, Trotsky continuously published articles in radical Russian and Ukrainian newspapers, such as ''Kievskaya Mysl,'' under a variety of pseudonyms, often using "Antid Oto". In September 1912, ''Kievskaya Mysl'' sent him to the Balkans as its war correspondent, where he covered the two [[Balkan Wars]] for the next year and became a close friend of [[Christian Rakovsky]]. The latter was later a leading Soviet politician and Trotsky's ally in the Soviet Communist Party. On 3 August 1914, at the outbreak of World War I, in which [[Austria-Hungary]] fought against the [[Russian Empire]], Trotsky was forced to flee Vienna for neutral Switzerland to avoid arrest as a Russian [[émigré]].&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;

===World War I (1914–1917)===
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2010}}

The outbreak of World War I caused a sudden realignment within the RSDLP and other European social democratic parties over the issues of war, revolution, pacifism and internationalism. Within the RSDLP, Lenin, Trotsky and Martov advocated various internationalist anti-war positions, while Plekhanov and other social democrats (both Bolsheviks and Mensheviks) supported the Russian government to some extent. In [[Switzerland]], Trotsky briefly worked within the [[Swiss Socialist Party]], prompting it to adopt an internationalist resolution. He wrote a book opposing the war, ''The War and the International,''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1914-war/index.htm Marxists.org, ''The War and the International'']&lt;/ref&gt; and the pro-war position taken by the European social democratic parties, primarily the German party. 

[[File:Trotskynina1915.jpg|thumb|upright|Leon Trotsky with his daughter Nina in 1915]]

As a war correspondent for the ''Kievskaya Mysl'', Trotsky moved to France on 19 November 1914. In January 1915 in Paris, he began editing (at first with Martov, who soon resigned as the paper moved to the left) ''Nashe Slovo'' ("Our Word"), an internationalist socialist newspaper. He adopted the slogan of "peace without indemnities or annexations, peace without conquerors or conquered." Lenin advocated Russia's defeat in the war and demanded a complete break with the [[Second International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Life of Lenin|last=Fischer|first=Louis|publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson History|year=2001|isbn=1842122304|location=UK|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trotsky attended the [[Zimmerwald Conference]] of anti-war socialists in September 1915 and advocated a middle course between those who, like Martov, would stay within the Second International at any cost and those who, like Lenin, would break with the Second International and form a [[Third International]]. The conference adopted the middle line proposed by Trotsky. At first opposed, in the end Lenin voted for Trotsky's resolution to avoid a split among anti-war socialists.&lt;ref&gt;Gus Fagan. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/rakovsky/biog/biog2.htm Christian Rakovsky biography], marxists.org; accessed 31 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 March 1916, Trotsky was deported from France to Spain for his anti-war activities. Spanish authorities did not want him and deported him to the United States on 25 December 1916. He arrived in New York City on 13 January 1917. He stayed for nearly three months at 1522 Vyse Avenue in [[The Bronx]]. In New York he wrote articles for the local [[Russian language]] socialist newspaper, ''[[Novy Mir (1916 magazine)|Novy Mir]],'' and the [[Yiddish]]-language daily, [[The Jewish Daily Forward|''Der Forverts'' (''The Jewish Daily Forward'')]], in translation. He also made speeches to Russian émigrés.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Trotsky was living in New York City when the [[February Revolution]] of 1917 overthrew [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II]]. He left New York on 27 March 1917, but his ship, the ''[[SS Kristianiafjord]],'' was intercepted by [[Royal Navy|British naval]] officials in Canada at [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]]. He was detained for a month at [[Amherst Internment Camp]] in Nova Scotia. While imprisoned in the camp, Trotsky established an increasing friendship with the workers and sailors amongst his fellow inmates, describing his month at the camp as "one continual mass meeting".&lt;ref name="ns1758.ca"&gt;[http://ns1758.ca/quote/trotsky1917.html ''Leon Trotsky: My Life - In a Concentration Camp''], ns1758.ca; accessed 31 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Trotsky's speeches and agitation incurred the wrath of German officer inmates who complained to the British camp commander, Colonel Morris, about Trotsky's "anti-patriotic" attitude.&lt;ref name="ns1758.ca"/&gt; Morris then forbade Trotsky to make any more public speeches, leading to 530 prisoners protesting and signing a petition against Morris' order.&lt;ref name="ns1758.ca"/&gt; Back in Russia, after initial hesitation and facing pressure from the workers' and peasants' [[Soviet (council)|soviets]], the Russian foreign minister [[Pavel Milyukov]] was compelled to demand the release of Trotsky as a Russian citizen, and the British government freed him on 29 April 1917.&lt;ref name="ns1758.ca"/&gt;

He reached Russia on 17 May 1917. After his return, Trotsky substantially agreed with the Bolshevik position, but did not join them right away. Russian social democrats were split into at least six groups, and the Bolsheviks were waiting for the next party Congress to determine which factions to merge with. Trotsky temporarily joined the [[Mezhraiontsy]], a regional social democratic organization in [[Saint Petersburg]], and became one of its leaders. At the First [[Congress of Soviets]] in June, he was elected a member of the first [[All-Russian Central Executive Committee]] ("VTsIK") from the Mezhraiontsy faction. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

After an unsuccessful pro-Bolshevik uprising in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]], Trotsky was arrested on 7 August 1917. He was released 40 days later in the aftermath of the failed counter-revolutionary [[Kornilov Affair|uprising by Lavr Kornilov]]. After the Bolsheviks gained a majority in the [[Petrograd Soviet]], Trotsky was elected chairman on {{OldStyleDate|25 September|1917|8 October}}.&lt;ref name= "Wade p. xxi"&gt;{{harvnb|Wade|2004|p=xxi}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sided with Lenin against [[Grigory Zinoviev]] and [[Lev Kamenev]] when the Bolshevik Central Committee discussed staging an armed uprising, and he led the efforts to overthrow the [[Russian Provisional Government, 1917|Provisional Government]] headed by [[Aleksandr Kerensky]].

The following summary of Trotsky's role in 1917 was written by Stalin in ''Pravda'', 6 November 1918.&lt;ref name="NI26"&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/ni/vol02/no06/quote.htm In One And The Same Issue] New International, Vol.2 No.6, October 1935, p.208&lt;/ref&gt; Although this passage was quoted in Stalin's book ''The October Revolution'' (1934),&lt;ref name="NI26" /&gt; it was expunged from Stalin's ''Works'' (1949).&lt;ref&gt;Stalin, J.V.;[https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1918/11/19.htm The October Revolution and the National Question]; Pravda; 6 and 19 November 1918; as published in Stalin's ''Works'', Vol. 4, November, 1917 - 1920; Foreign Languages Publishing House, Moscow, 1953&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|All practical work in connection with the organization of the uprising was done under the immediate direction of Comrade Trotsky, the President of the Petrograd Soviet. It can be stated with certainty that the Party is indebted primarily and principally to Comrade Trotsky for the rapid going over of the garrison to the side of the Soviet and the efficient manner in which the work of the [[Military Revolutionary Committee]] was organized.}}

After the success of the uprising on 7–8 November 1917, Trotsky led the efforts to repel a [[Kerensky-Krasnov uprising|counter-attack]] by [[Cossacks]] under General [[Pyotr Krasnov]] and other troops still loyal to the overthrown Provisional Government at [[Gatchina]]. Allied with Lenin, he defeated attempts by other Bolshevik Central Committee members (Zinoviev, Kamenev, Rykov, etc.) to share power with other socialist parties. By the end of 1917, Trotsky was unquestionably the second man in the Bolshevik Party after Lenin. He overshadowed the ambitious Zinoviev, who had been Lenin's top lieutenant over the previous decade, but whose star appeared to be fading. This reversal of position contributed to continuing competition and enmity between the two men, which lasted until 1926 and did much to destroy them both.

==Russian Revolution and aftermath==
===Commissar for Foreign Affairs and Brest-Litovsk (1917–1918)===
[[File:Leon Trotsky Lev Kamenev Brest-Litovsk negotiations.jpg|thumb|Leon Trotsky and [[Lev Kamenev]] at [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|Brest-Litovsk negotiations]]]]

After the Bolsheviks came to power, Trotsky became the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs]] and published the [[Secret treaty|secret treaties]] previously signed by the [[Triple Entente]] that detailed plans for post-war reallocation of colonies and redrawing state borders.

Trotsky led the Soviet delegation during the peace negotiations in [[Brest, Belarus|Brest-Litovsk]] from 22 December 1917 to 10 February 1918. At that time the Soviet government was split on the issue. [[Left Communism|Left Communists]], led by [[Nikolai Bukharin]], continued to believe that there could be no peace between a Soviet republic and a capitalist country and that only a revolutionary war leading to a pan-European Soviet republic would bring a durable peace.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

They cited the successes of the newly formed (15 January 1918) voluntary [[Red Army]] against Polish forces of Gen. [[Józef Dowbor-Muśnicki]] in Belarus, [[White movement|White]] forces in the [[Don River, Russia|Don]] region, and newly independent [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] forces as proof that the Red Army could repel German forces, especially if propaganda and [[asymmetrical warfare]] were used.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

They were willing to hold talks with the Germans as a means of exposing German imperial ambitions (territorial gains, [[War reparations|reparations]], etc.) in the hope of accelerating the hoped−for Soviet revolution in the West, but they were dead set against signing any peace treaty. In case of a German ultimatum, they advocated proclaiming a revolutionary war against Germany in order to inspire Russian and European workers to fight for socialism. This opinion was shared by [[Left Socialist Revolutionaries]], who were then the Bolsheviks' junior partners in a coalition government.&lt;ref name="lsrm" /&gt;

Lenin, who had earlier hoped for a speedy Soviet revolution in Germany and other parts of Europe, quickly decided that the imperial government of Germany was still firmly in control and that, without a strong Russian military, an armed conflict with Germany would lead to a collapse of the Soviet government in Russia. He agreed with the Left Communists that ultimately a pan-European Soviet revolution would solve all problems, but until then the Bolsheviks had to stay in power. Lenin did not mind prolonging the negotiating process for maximum propaganda effect, but, from January 1918 on, advocated signing a separate peace treaty if faced with a German ultimatum. Trotsky's position was between these two Bolshevik factions. Like Lenin, he admitted that the old Russian military, inherited from the monarchy and the Provisional Government and in advanced stages of decomposition, was unable to fight:&lt;ref&gt;The "Brest-Litovsk" chapter in Trotsky's 1925 book [http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1925/lenin/04.htm ''Lenin''], marxists.org; accessed 1 June 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|That we could no longer fight was perfectly clear to me and that the newly formed [[Red Guards (Russia)|Red Guard]] and Red Army detachments were too small and poorly trained to resist the Germans.}}

But he agreed with the Left Communists that a separate peace treaty with an imperialist power would be a terrible morale and material blow to the Soviet government, negate all its military and political successes of 1917 and 1918, resurrect the notion that the Bolsheviks secretly allied with the German government, and cause an upsurge of internal resistance. He argued that any German ultimatum should be refused, and that this might well lead to an uprising in Germany, or at least inspire German soldiers to disobey their officers since any German offensive would be a naked grab for territories. He wrote in 1925:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1925/lenin/04.htm ''Lenin''], marxists.org; accessed 31 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|We began peace negotiations in the hope of arousing the workmen's party of Germany and Austria-Hungary as well as of the Entente countries. For this reason we were obliged to delay the negotiations as long as possible to give the European workman time to understand the main fact of the Soviet revolution itself and particularly its peace policy. But there was the other question: Can the Germans still fight? Are they in a position to begin an attack on the revolution that will explain the cessation of the war? How can we find out the state of mind of the German soldiers, how to fathom it?}}

Throughout January and February 1918, Lenin's position was supported by 7 members of the Bolshevik Central Committee and Bukharin's by 4. Trotsky had 4 votes (his own, [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]]'s, [[Nikolai Krestinsky]]'s and [[Adolph Joffe]]'s) and, since he held the balance of power, he was able to pursue his policy in Brest-Litovsk. When he could no longer delay the negotiations, he withdrew from the talks on 10 February 1918, refusing to sign on Germany's harsh terms.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

After a brief hiatus, the [[Central Powers]] notified the Soviet government that they would no longer observe the truce after 17 February. At this point Lenin again argued that the Soviet government had done all it could to explain its position to Western workers and that it was time to accept the terms. Trotsky refused to support Lenin since he was waiting to see whether German workers would rebel and whether German soldiers would refuse to follow orders.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Germany resumed [[Operation Faustschlag|military operations]] on 18 February. Within a day, it became clear that the German army was capable of conducting offensive operations and that Red Army detachments, which were relatively small, poorly organized and poorly led, were no match for it. In the evening of 18 February 1918, Trotsky and his supporters in the committee abstained and Lenin's proposal was accepted 7–4. The Soviet government sent a [[Radiogram (message)|radiogram]] to the German side accepting the final Brest-Litovsk peace terms.&lt;ref name=Felshtinsky&gt;{{cite book | first = Yuri | last = Felshtinsky | title = Lenin and His Comrades: The Bolsheviks Take Over Russia 1917–1924 | publisher = Enigma Books | location = New York | isbn =978-1-929631-95-7 | date = 26 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany did not respond for three days, and continued its offensive encountering little resistance. The response arrived on 21 February, but the proposed terms were so harsh that even Lenin briefly thought that the Soviet government had no choice but to fight. But in the end, the committee again voted 7–4 on 23 February 1918; the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Russia–Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] was signed on 3 March and ratified on 15 March 1918. Since Trotsky was so closely associated with the policy previously followed by the Soviet delegation at Brest-Litovsk, he resigned from his position as Commissar for Foreign Affairs in order to remove a potential obstacle to the new policy.

=== Head of the Red Army (spring 1918) ===
[[File:Leon Trotsky Armored Train 1920.jpg|thumb|Leon Trotsky speaks from the Armoured Train, Russian Civil War]]

The failure of the recently formed Red Army to resist the German offensive in February 1918 revealed its weaknesses: insufficient numbers, lack of knowledgeable officers, and near absence of coordination and subordination. Celebrated and feared [[Baltic Fleet]] sailors, one of the bastions of the new regime led by [[Pavel Dybenko]], fled from the German army at [[Narva]]. The notion that the Soviet state could have an effective voluntary or [[militia]] type military was seriously undermined.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Trotsky was one of the first Bolshevik leaders to recognise the problem, and he pushed for the formation of a military council of former Russian generals that would function as an advisory body. Lenin and the Bolshevik Central Committee agreed on 4 March to create the [[Revolutionary Military Council|Supreme Military Council]], headed by former chief of the imperial General Staff [[Mikhail Bonch-Bruevich]].{{cn|date=June 2018}}

The entire Bolshevik leadership of the Red Army, including People's Commissar (defence minister) [[Nikolai Podvoisky]] and commander-in-chief [[Nikolai Krylenko]], protested vigorously and eventually resigned. They believed that the Red Army should consist only of dedicated revolutionaries, rely on propaganda and force, and have elected officers. They viewed former imperial officers and generals as potential traitors who should be kept out of the new military, much less put in charge of it. Their views continued to be popular with many Bolsheviks throughout most of the [[Russian Civil War]], and their supporters, including Podvoisky, who became one of Trotsky's deputies, were a constant thorn in Trotsky's side. The discontent with Trotsky's policies of strict discipline, conscription and reliance on carefully supervised non-Communist military experts eventually led to the [[Military Opposition]] (Russian: [[:ru:Военная оппозиция|Военная оппозиция]]), which was active within the Communist Party in late 1918–1919.&lt;ref name="Life XXXVI"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[My Life (Leon Trotsky autobiography)|My Life]]|last=Trotsky|first=Leon|chapter=XXXVI|year=1930|chapterurl=http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1930/mylife/ch36.htm|accessdate=23 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 March 1918, Trotsky's resignation as Commissar for Foreign Affairs was officially accepted, and he was appointed People's Commissar of Army and Navy Affairs – in place of Podvoisky – and chairman of the Supreme Military Council. The post of commander-in-chief was abolished, and Trotsky gained full control of the Red Army, responsible only to the Communist Party leadership, whose Left Socialist Revolutionary allies had left the government over [[Brest-Litovsk]].&lt;ref name="lsrm"&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/glossary/orgs/l/e.htm#left-srs Left Socialist-Revolutionaries (Left SRs) ]; Glossary of organizations on [[Marxists.org]]&lt;/ref&gt;

With the help of his deputy [[Ephraim Sklyansky]], Trotsky spent the rest of the Civil War transforming the Red Army from a ragtag network of small and fiercely independent detachments into a large and disciplined military machine, through forced conscription, party-controlled [[Barrier troops|blocking squads]], compulsory obedience and officers chosen by the leadership instead of the rank and file. He defended these positions throughout his life.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The caption reads, "Peace and Liberty in [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Sovdepiya]]".]]

The military situation soon tested Trotsky's managerial and organisation-building skills. In May–June 1918, the [[Czechoslovak Legions]] ''en route'' from European Russia to [[Vladivostok]] rose against the Soviet government. This left the Bolsheviks with the loss of most of the country's territory, an increasingly well-organised resistance by Russian anti-Communist forces (usually referred to as the [[White Movement|White Army]] after their best-known component) and widespread defection by the military experts whom Trotsky relied on.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

Trotsky and the government responded with a full-fledged [[mobilization|mobilisation]], which increased the size of the Red Army from fewer than 300,000 in May 1918 to one million in October, and an introduction of [[political commissar]]s into the army. The latter had the task of ensuring the loyalty of military experts (mostly former officers in the imperial army) and co-signing their orders. Trotsky regarded the organisation of the Red Army as built on the ideas of the October Revolution. As he later wrote in his autobiography:&lt;ref&gt;Chapter XXXIV of [http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch34.htm ''My Life''], marxists.org; accessed 31 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|An army cannot be built without reprisals. Masses of men cannot be led to death unless the army command has the death-penalty in its arsenal. So long as those malicious tailless apes that are so proud of their technical achievements—the animals that we call men—will build armies and wage wars, the command will always be obliged to place the soldiers between the possible death in the front and the inevitable one in the rear. And yet armies are not built on fear. The Tsar's army fell to pieces not because of any lack of reprisals. In his attempt to save it by restoring the death-penalty, Kerensky only finished it. Upon the ashes of the great war, the Bolsheviks created a new army. These facts demand no explanation for any one who has even the slightest knowledge of the language of history. The strongest cement in the new army was the ideas of the October revolution, and [[Trotsky's train|the train]] supplied the front with this cement.}}

In response to [[Fanny Kaplan|Fanya Kaplan]]'s failed assassination of Lenin on 30 August 1918, and to the successful assassination of the Petrograd [[Cheka]] chief [[Moisei Uritsky]] on 17 August 1918, the Bolsheviks instructed [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]] to commence a [[Red Terror]], announced in the 1 September 1918 issue of the ''Krasnaya Gazeta'' (''Red Gazette'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/RUSterror.htm|title=Red Terror|publisher=Spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk|accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the Red Terror Trotsky wrote:{{Quote|The bourgeoisie today is a falling class... We are forced to tear it off, to chop it away. The Red Terror is a weapon utilized against a class, doomed to destruction, which does not wish to perish. If the White Terror can only retard the historical rise of the proletariat, the Red Terror hastens the destruction of the bourgeoisie.&lt;ref&gt;''Terrorism and Communism: A Reply to Karl Kautsky'' (1975), pg. 83&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In dealing with deserters, Trotsky often appealed to them politically, arousing them with the ideas of the Revolution.
{{Quote|In the provinces of Kaluga, Voronezh, and Ryazan, tens of thousands of young peasants had failed to answer the first recruiting summons by the Soviets ... The war commissariat of Ryazan succeeded in gathering in some fifteen thousand of such deserters. While passing through Ryazan, I decided to take a look at them. Some of our men tried to dissuade me. "Something might happen," they warned me. But everything went off beautifully. The men were called out of their barracks. "Comrade-deserters – come to the meeting. Comrade Trotsky has come to speak to you." They ran out excited, boisterous, as curious as schoolboys. I had imagined them much worse, and they had imagined me as more terrible. In a few minutes, I was surrounded by a huge crowd of unbridled, utterly undisciplined, but not at all hostile men. The "comrade-deserters" were looking at me with such curiosity that it seemed as if their eyes would pop out of their heads. I climbed on a table there in the yard, and spoke to them for about an hour and a half. It was a most responsive audience. I tried to raise them in their own eyes; concluding, I asked them to lift their hands in token of their loyalty to the revolution. The new ideas infected them before my very eyes. They were genuinely enthusiastic; they followed me to the automobile, devoured me with their eyes, not fearfully, as before, but rapturously, and shouted at the tops of their voices. They would hardly let me go. I learned afterward, with some pride, that one of the best ways to educate them was to remind them: "What did you promise Comrade Trotsky?" Later on, regiments of Ryazan "deserters" fought well at the fronts.}}

Given the lack of manpower and the 16 opposing foreign armies, Trotsky also insisted on the use of former Tsarist officers as military specialists within the Red Army, in combination with Bolshevik political commissars to ensure the revolutionary nature of the Red Army. Lenin commented on this:{{Quote|When Comrade Trotsky informed me recently that the number of officers of the old army employed by our War Department runs into several tens of thousands, I perceived concretely where the secret of using our enemy lay, how to compel those who had opposed communism to build it, how to build communism with the bricks which the capitalists had chosen to hurl against us! We have no other bricks! And so, we must compel the bourgeois experts, under the leadership of the proletariat, to build up our edifice with these bricks. This is what is difficult; but this is the pledge of victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1919/mar/x01.htm |title= Achievements and Difficulties of the Soviet Government|last1=Lenin |first1=Vladimir Ilych |last2= |first2= |date=1919 |website=marxists.org |publisher=Progress Publishers |access-date=6 November 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Vladimir Lenin Leon Trotsky Lev Kamenev 1920.jpg|thumb|[[Vladimir Lenin]], Leon Trotsky, [[Lev Kamenev]] motivate the troops to fight on the [[Polish–Soviet War|Soviet-Polish war]]. May 1, 1920]]

In September 1918, the Bolshevik government, facing continuous military difficulties, declared what amounted to martial law and reorganized the Red Army. The Supreme Military Council was abolished and the position of commander-in-chief was restored, filled by the commander of the [[Latvian Riflemen]], [[Ioakim Vatsetis]] (a.k.a. Jukums Vācietis), who had formerly led the Eastern Front against the Czechoslovak Legions. Vatsetis took charge of day-to-day operations of the army while Trotsky became chairman of the newly formed [[Revolutionary Military Council]] of the Republic and retained overall control of the military. Trotsky and Vatsetis had clashed earlier in 1918, while Vatsetis and Trotsky's adviser Mikhail Bonch-Bruevich were also on unfriendly terms. Nevertheless, Trotsky eventually established a working relationship with the often prickly Vatsetis.

The reorganization caused yet another conflict between Trotsky and Stalin in late September. Trotsky appointed former imperial general [[Pavel Pavlovich Sytin]] to command the Southern Front, but in early October 1918 Stalin refused to accept him and so he was recalled{{by whom|date=February 2014}} from the front. Lenin and [[Yakov Sverdlov]] tried to make Trotsky and Stalin reconcile, but their meeting proved unsuccessful.

==== 1919 ====
Throughout late 1918 and early 1919, there were a number of attacks on Trotsky's leadership of the Red Army, including veiled accusations in newspaper articles inspired by Stalin and a direct attack by the Military Opposition at the [[8th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|VIIIth Party Congress]] in March 1919. On the surface, he weathered them successfully and was elected one of only five full members of the first [[Politburo]] after the Congress. But he later wrote:&lt;ref name="Life XXXVI" /&gt;{{Quote|It is no wonder that my military work created so many enemies for me. I did not look to the side, I elbowed away those who interfered with military success, or in the haste of the work trod on the toes of the unheeding and was too busy even to apologize. Some people remember such things. The dissatisfied and those whose feelings had been hurt found their way to Stalin or Zinoviev, for these two also nourished hurts.}}

In mid-1919 the dissatisfied had an opportunity to mount a serious challenge to Trotsky's leadership: the Red Army grew from 800,000 to 3,000,000, and fought simultaneously on sixteen fronts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/international-politics/2010/03/trotsky-stalin-russian-lenin|title=Lost leaders: Leon Trotsky|work=The New Statesman |location=UK }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Red Army had defeated the White Army's spring offensive in the east and was about to cross the [[Ural Mountains]] and enter Siberia in pursuit of Admiral [[Alexander Kolchak]]'s forces. But in the south, General [[Anton Denikin]]'s White Russian forces advanced, and the situation deteriorated rapidly. On 6 June, Red Army commander-in-chief, [[Jukums Vācietis]], ordered the Eastern Front to stop the offensive so that he could use its forces in the south. But the leadership of the Eastern Front, including its commander [[Sergey Kamenev]] (a former colonel of the Imperial army), and Eastern Front Revolutionary Military Council members [[Ivar Smilga]], [[Mikhail Lashevich]] and Sergey Gusev vigorously protested and wanted to keep the emphasis on the Eastern Front. They insisted that it was vital to capture Siberia before the onset of winter and that once Kolchak's forces were broken, many more divisions would be freed up for the Southern Front. Trotsky, who had earlier had conflicts with the leadership of the Eastern Front, including a temporary removal of Kamenev in May 1919, supported Vācietis.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

At the 3–4 July Central Committee meeting, after a heated exchange the majority supported Kamenev and Smilga against Vācietis and Trotsky. Trotsky's plan was rejected and he was much criticized for various alleged shortcomings in his leadership style, much of it of a personal nature. Stalin used this opportunity to pressure Lenin&lt;ref name="My Life"&gt;Chapter XXXVII of [http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch37.htm ''My Life'']&lt;/ref&gt; to dismiss Trotsky from his post. But when Trotsky offered his resignation on 5 July, the Politburo and the [[Orgburo]] of the Central Committee unanimously rejected it.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

[[File:Trotsky on a Polish poster of 1920.jpg|thumb|upright|A Polish poster depicts Trotsky on a pile of skulls and holding a bloody knife, during the [[Polish-Soviet War]] of 1920]]

However, some significant changes to the leadership of the Red Army were made. Trotsky was temporarily sent to the Southern Front, while the work in Moscow was informally coordinated by Smilga. Most members of the Revolutionary Military Council who were not involved in its day-to-day operations were relieved of their duties on 8 July, and new members, including Smilga, were added. The same day, while Trotsky was in the south, Vācietis was suddenly arrested by the [[Cheka]] on suspicion of involvement in an anti-Soviet plot, and replaced by Sergey Kamenev. After a few weeks in the south, Trotsky returned to Moscow and resumed control of the Red Army. A year later, Smilga and [[Tukhachevsky]] were defeated during the [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]], but Trotsky refused this opportunity to pay Smilga back, which earned him Smilga's friendship and later support during the intra-Party battles of the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Isai Abramovich's [http://lib.ru/MEMUARY/ABRAMOWICH/abramowich1.txt memoirs] re: the Smilga episode. Abramovich (1900–1985), a friend of Smilga's, was one of the few Trotskyists who survived the Great Purges and returned from Stalin's camps in the late 1950s.&lt;/ref&gt;

By October 1919, the government was in the worst crisis of the Civil War: Denikin's troops approached [[Tula, Russia|Tula]] and Moscow from the south, and General [[Nikolay Yudenich]]'s troops approached Petrograd from the west. Lenin decided that since it was more important to defend Moscow, Petrograd would have to be abandoned. Trotsky argued&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch35.htm ''My Life'' (Chapter XXXV)], marxists.org; accessed 31 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; that Petrograd needed to be defended, at least in part to prevent [[Estonia]] and [[Finland]] from intervening. In a rare reversal, Trotsky was supported by Stalin and Zinoviev, and prevailed against Lenin in the Central Committee. He immediately went to Petrograd, whose leadership headed by Zinoviev he found demoralized, and organized its defense, sometimes personally stopping fleeing soldiers. By 22 October, the Red Army was on the offensive and in early November, Yudenich's troops were driven back to Estonia, where they were disarmed and interned. Trotsky was awarded the [[Order of the Red Banner]] for his actions in Petrograd.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

====1920====

With the defeat of Denikin and Yudenich in late 1919, the Soviet government's emphasis shifted to the economy. Trotsky spent the winter of 1919–20 in the Urals region trying to restart its economy. Based on his experiences, he proposed abandoning the policies of [[War Communism]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch38.htm ''My Life'' (Chapter XXXVIII)], marxists.org; accessed 31 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; which included confiscating grain from peasants, and partially restoring the grain market. Still committed to War Communism, Lenin rejected his proposal. He put Trotsky in charge of the country's railroads (while retaining overall control of the Red Army), which he directed should be militarized in the spirit of War Communism. It was not until early 1921, due to economic collapse and social uprisings, that Lenin and the rest of the Bolshevik leadership abandoned War Communism in favor of the [[New Economic Policy]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In early 1920, Soviet–Polish tensions eventually led to the [[Polish–Soviet War]]. In the run-up and during the war, Trotsky argued&lt;ref name="My Life" /&gt; that the Red Army was exhausted and the Soviet government should sign a peace treaty with Poland as soon as possible. He did not believe that the Red Army would find much support in Poland proper. Lenin later wrote that he and other Bolshevik leaders believed the Red Army's successes in the Russian Civil War and against the Poles meant "The defensive period of the war with worldwide imperialism was over, and we could, and had the obligation to, exploit the military situation to launch an offensive war."&lt;ref&gt;''Political Report of the Central Committee of the RKP(b) to the Ninth All-Russian Conference of the Communist Party'' delivered by Lenin on 20 September 1920, Document 59 in ''The Unknown Lenin'', ed. [[Richard Pipes]], [[Yale University Press]], 1996; {{ISBN|0-300-06919-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Red Army was defeated by Poland and the offensive was turned back during the [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]] in August 1920, in part because of Stalin's failure to obey Trotsky's orders in the run-up to the decisive engagements. Back in Moscow, Trotsky again argued for a peace treaty and this time prevailed.

===Trade union debate (1920–1921)===
[[File:Lenin, Trotsky and Voroshilov with Delegates of the 10th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks).jpg|thumb|Trotsky with [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Klim Voroshilov]] among soldiers in [[Petrograd]] in 1921.]]

In late 1920, after the Bolsheviks won the Civil War and before the Eighth and Ninth Congress of Soviets, the Communist Party had a heated and increasingly acrimonious debate over the role of [[trade unions in the Soviet Union]]. The discussion split the party into many "platforms" (factions), including Lenin's, Trotsky's and Bukharin's; Bukharin eventually merged his with Trotsky's. Smaller, more radical factions like the [[Workers' Opposition]] (headed by [[Alexander Shlyapnikov]]) and the [[Group of Democratic Centralism]] were particularly active.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Trotsky's position formed while he led a special commission on the Soviet transportation system, Tsektran. He was appointed there to rebuild the rail system ruined by the Civil War. Being the Commissar of War and a revolutionary military leader, he saw a need to create a militarised "production atmosphere" by incorporating trade unions directly into the State apparatus. His unyielding stance was that in a worker's state the workers should have nothing to fear from the state, and the State should fully control the unions. In the Ninth Party Congress he argued for &lt;blockquote&gt;"....a regime in which every worker feels himself a soldier of labour, who cannot dispose of himself freely; if the order is given to transfer him, he must carry it out; if he does not carry it out, he will be a deserter who is punished. Who looks after this? The trade unions. It creates the new regime. This is the militarisation of the working class."&lt;ref&gt;[[Tony Cliff]]; [https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1990/trotsky2/11-warcomm.html Trotsky: The Sword of the Revolution 1917-1923]; Chapter 11: War Communism at an impasse; paragraph "The militarisation of all labour"; Bookmarks, London 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Lenin sharply criticised Trotsky and accused him of "bureaucratically nagging the trade unions" and of staging "factional attacks". His view did not focus on State control as much as the concern that a new relationship was needed between the State and the rank-and-file workers. He said, "Introduction of genuine labour discipline is conceived only if the whole mass of participants in productions take a conscious part in the fulfillment of these tasks. This cannot be achieved by bureaucratic methods and orders from above."  This was a debate that Lenin thought the party could not afford. His frustration with Trotsky was used by Stalin and Zinoviev with their support for Lenin's position, to improve their standing within the Bolshevik leadership at Trotsky's expense.

[[File:Kronstadt attack.JPG|thumb|left|[[Red Army]] troops attack [[Kronstadt rebellion|Kronstadt sailors]] in March 1921.]]

Disagreements threatened to get out of hand, and many Bolsheviks, including Lenin, feared that the party would splinter. The Central Committee was split almost evenly between Lenin's and Trotsky's supporters, with all three Secretaries of the Central Committee (Krestinsky, [[Yevgeny Preobrazhensky]] and [[Leonid Serebryakov]]) supporting Trotsky.

At a meeting of his faction at the [[10th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|Tenth Party Congress]] in March 1921, Lenin's faction won a decisive victory, and a number of Trotsky's supporters (including all three secretaries of the Central Committee) lost their leadership positions. Krestinsky was replaced as a member of the Politburo by Zinoviev, who had supported Lenin. Krestinsky's place in the secretariat was taken by [[Vyacheslav Molotov]]. The congress also adopted a secret resolution on "Party unity", which banned factions within the Party except during pre-Congress discussions. The resolution was later published and used by Stalin against Trotsky and other opponents. At the end of the Tenth Congress, after peace negotiations had failed, Trotsky gave the order for the suppression of the [[Kronstadt rebellion]], the last major revolt against Bolshevik rule.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1938/07/kronstadt2.htm "More on the Suppression of Kronstadt"] by Leon Trotsky&lt;/ref&gt;

Years later, [[Anarchism|anarchist]] [[Emma Goldman]] and others criticised Trotsky's actions as Commissar for War for his role in the suppression of the rebellion, and argued that he ordered unjustified incarcerations and executions of political opponents such as anarchists, although Trotsky did not participate in the actual suppression.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1938/01/kronstadt.htm "Hue and Cry Over Kronstadt"] by Leon Trotsky&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/goldman/pdfs/PublishedEssaysandPamphlets_TROTSKYPROTESTSTOOMUCH.pdf | first=Emma | last=Goldman | title=Trotsky Protests too Much | date=1938 | publisher=The Anarchist Communist Federation | location=Glasgow | via=UC Berkeley Library | accessdate=14 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Trotskyists, most notably [[Abbie Bakan]], have argued that the claim that the Kronstadt rebels were "counterrevolutionary" has been supported by evidence of White Army and French government support for the Kronstadt sailors' March rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;[[Abbie Bakan]]. [http://www.marxisme.dk/arkiv/bakan/90-krons.htm "Kronstadt – A Tragic Necessity"], marxisme.dk; accessed 31 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians, most notably Paul Avrich, claimed the evidence did not point towards this conclusion, and saw the Kronstadt Rebellion as spontaneous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/append42.html|title=What was the Kronstadt Rebellion? - Anarchist Writers|publisher=anarchism.pageabode.com|accessdate=17 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trotsky's contribution to the Russian Revolution ===
[[File:Leon Trotsky as the October Revolution Guard.jpg|thumb|Leon Trotsky, the [[People's Commissar for Military and Naval Affairs|People's Commissar for Military and Naval Affairs USSR]], as the Guard of [[October Revolution|the October revolution]]]]

Vladimir Cherniaev, a leading Russian historian, sums up Trotsky's main contributions to the Russian Revolution:
{{Quote|Trotsky bears a great deal of responsibility both for the victory of the Red Army in the civil war, and for the establishment of a one-party authoritarian state with its apparatus for ruthlessly suppressing dissent... He was an ideologist and practitioner of the Red Terror.  He despised 'bourgeois democracy'; he believed that spinelessness and soft-heartedness would destroy the revolution, and that the suppression of the propertied classes and political opponents would clear the historical arena for socialism.  He was the initiator of concentration camps, compulsory 'labour camps,' and the militarization of labour, and the state takeover of trade unions. Trotsky was implicated in many practices which would become standard in the Stalin era, including summary executions.&lt;ref&gt;V. I͡U. Cherni͡aev, "Trotsky" in {{cite book|last=Edward Acton, V. I͡U. Cherni͡aev, and William G. Rosenberg, eds.|title=Critical Companion to the Russian Revolution, 1914–1921|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NAZm2EdxKqkC&amp;pg=PA191|year=1997|publisher=Indiana University Press|page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Historian Geoffrey Swain argues that:
{{Quote|The Bolsheviks triumphed in the Civil War because of Trotsky's ability to work with military specialists, because of the style of work he introduced where widescale consultation was followed through by swift and determined action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Geoffrey Swain|title=Trotsky|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P-ahAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA210|year=2014|publisher=Routledge|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lenin said in 1921 that Trotsky was "in love with organisation,"  but in working politics, "he has not got a clue." Swain explains the paradox by arguing that Trotsky was not good at teamwork; he was a loner who had mostly worked as a journalist, not as a professional revolutionary like the others.&lt;ref&gt;Swain (2014), pg. 211&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lenin's illness (1922–1923)===
In late 1921, Lenin's health deteriorated and he was absent from Moscow for longer periods of time. He had three strokes between 25 May 1922 and 9 March 1923, which caused paralysis, loss of speech and finally death on 21 January 1924. With Lenin increasingly sidelined throughout 1922, Stalin was elevated to the newly created position of the Central Committee [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|general secretary]].{{efn|Yakov Sverdlov was the Central Committee's senior secretary responsible for personnel affairs from 1917 and until his death in March 1919. He was replaced by [[Elena Stasova]], and in November 1919 by Nikolai Krestinsky.

After Krestinsky's ouster in March 1921, Vyacheslav Molotov became the senior secretary, but he lacked Krestinsky's authority, since he was not a full Politburo member. Stalin took over the position as senior secretary, which was formalized at the XIth Party Congress in April 1922, with Molotov becoming second secretary.}} Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev{{efn|It is not clear why Kamenev, a mild-mannered man with few leadership ambitions and who was the brother-in-law of Trotsky, sided with Zinoviev and Stalin against Trotsky in 1922. Trotsky later speculated that it may have been due to Kamenev's love of comfort, which Trotsky found "repelled me." He expressed [http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1939/xx/kremlin.htm his feelings to Kamenev] in late 1920 or early 1921:{{Quote|Our relations with Kamenev, which were very good in the first period after the insurrection, began to become more distant from that day.}}}} became part of the ''[[wikt:troika|troika]]'' (triumvirate) formed by Stalin to ensure that Trotsky, publicly the number-two man in the country and Lenin's [[heir presumptive]],{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} would not succeed Lenin.

The rest of the recently expanded Politburo (Rykov, [[Mikhail Tomsky]], Bukharin) was at first uncommitted, but eventually joined the ''troika.'' Stalin's power of patronage{{efn|The Central Committee's Secretariat became increasingly important during the Civil War and especially in its aftermath, as the Party switched from elected officials to appointed ones. The change was prompted by the need to allocate manpower quickly during the Civil War as well as by the transformation of the party from a small group of revolutionaries into the country's ruling party, with a corresponding increase in membership. New members included career seekers and former members of banned socialist parties, who were viewed with apprehension by Old Bolsheviks.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

To prevent a possible degeneration of the party, various membership requirements were instituted for party officials, and the ultimate power of appointment of local officials was reserved for the Secretariat of the Central Committee. This put enormous power in the general secretary's hands.}} in his capacity as general secretary clearly played a role, but Trotsky and his supporters later concluded that a more fundamental reason was the process of slow bureaucratisation of the Soviet regime once the extreme conditions of the Civil War were over. Much of the Bolshevik elite wanted 'normality,' while Trotsky was personally and politically personified as representing a turbulent revolutionary period that they would much rather leave behind.

Although the exact sequence of events is unclear, evidence suggests that at first the ''troika'' nominated Trotsky to head second-rate government departments (e.g., Gokhran, the State Depository for Valuables).&lt;ref&gt;Document 103 (22 May 1922) in ''The Unknown Lenin''&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-July 1922, Kamenev wrote a letter to the recovering Lenin to the effect that "(the Central Committee) is throwing or is ready to throw a good cannon overboard". Lenin was shocked and responded:&lt;ref&gt;Document 106 in ''The Unknown Lenin''&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{Quote|Throwing Trotsky overboard – surely you are hinting at that, it is impossible to interpret it otherwise – is the height of stupidity. If you do not consider me already hopelessly foolish, how can you think of that????}}

From then until his final stroke, Lenin spent much of his time trying to devise a way to prevent a split within the Communist Party leadership, which was reflected in ''[[Lenin's Testament]].'' As part of this effort, on 11 September 1922 Lenin proposed that Trotsky become his deputy at the [[Council of People's Commissars]] (Sovnarkom). The Politburo approved the proposal, but Trotsky "categorically refused".&lt;ref&gt;Document 109 in ''The Unknown Lenin''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1922, Trotsky secured an alliance with Lenin against Stalin and the emerging Soviet bureaucracy.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter XXXIX of [http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch39.htm ''My Life''], Marxist Internet Archive&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin had recently engineered the creation of the [[Soviet Union|Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR), further centralising state control. The alliance proved effective on the issue of foreign trade{{efn|Lenin's [http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1922/dec/15.htm letter] to Stalin dictated on 15 December 1922: "I am sure Trotsky will uphold my views as well as I." Faced with a united opposition by Lenin and Trotsky, the Central Committee reversed its previous decision and adopted the Lenin-Trotsky proposal.}} but was hindered by Lenin's progressing illness.

In January 1923, Lenin amended his Testament to suggest that Stalin should be removed as the party's general secretary, while also mildly criticising Trotsky and other Bolshevik leaders. The relationship between Stalin and Lenin had broken down completely by this time, as was demonstrated during an event where Stalin crudely insulted Lenin's wife, [[Nadezhda Krupskaya]]. In March 1923, days before his third stroke, Lenin asked Trotsky to denounce Stalin and his so-called "Great-Russian nationalistic campaign" at the [[12th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|XIIth Party Congress]].

At the XIIth Party Congress in April 1923, however, just after Lenin's final stroke, Trotsky did not raise the issue.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 11 of Trotsky's unfinished book, entitled [http://maximumred.blogspot.com/2005/08/trotskys-stalin-chap-11-from-obscurity.html ''Stalin'']&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he made a speech about intra-party democracy while avoiding any direct confrontation of the ''troika.''{{efn|Trotsky explained in Chapter 12 of his unfinished book [http://maximumred.blogspot.com/2005_08_01_maximumred_archive.html ''Stalin''] that he refused to deliver the report because "it seemed to me equivalent to announcing my candidacy for the role of Lenin's successor at a time when Lenin was fighting a grave illness.}} Stalin had prepared for the congress by replacing many local party delegates with those loyal to him, mostly at the expense of Zinoviev and Kamenev's backers.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 12 of Trotsky's unfinished book, entitled [http://maximumred.blogspot.com/2005_08_01_maximumred_archive.html ''Stalin'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The delegates, most of whom were unaware of the divisions within the Politburo, gave Trotsky a [[standing ovation]]. This upset the ''troika'', already infuriated by [[Karl Radek]]'s article, "Leon Trotsky – Organiser of Victory"{{efn|Radek wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1937/dewey/session13_c.htm|title=Archived copy|accessdate=24 October 2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051122201847/http://marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1937/dewey/session13_c.htm|archivedate=22 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|The need of the hour was for a man who would incarnate the call to struggle, a man who, subordinating himself completely to the requirements of the struggle, would become the ringing summons to arms, the will which exacts from all unconditional submission to a great, sacrificial necessity.

Stalin delivered the key reports on organisational structure and questions of nationality; while Zinoviev delivered the Central Committee political report, traditionally Lenin's prerogative. Among the resolutions adopted by the XIIth Congress were those calling for greater democracy within the Party, but these were vague and remained unimplemented.

In mid-1923 the ''troika'' had Trotsky's friend and supporter [[Christian Rakovsky]] removed from his post as head of the Ukrainian government ([[Council of People's Commissars (Ukraine)|USSR ''Radnarkom'']]) and sent to London as ambassador. When regional leaders in Ukraine protested against Rakovsky's reassignment, they too were reassigned to various posts all over the Soviet Union. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

=== Left opposition (1923–1924) ===
[[File:Trotsky-Annenkov 1922 sketch.jpg|thumb|upright|Trotsky in a 1922 [[cubist]] portrait by [[Yury Annenkov]] – a version of this appeared on one of the earliest covers of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.]]

Starting in mid-1923, the Soviet economy ran into significant difficulties, which led to numerous strikes countrywide. Two secret groups within the Communist Party, "[[Workers' Truth]]" and "[[Workers Group of the Russian Communist Party|Workers' Group]]", were uncovered and suppressed by the Soviet secret police. On 8 October 1923 Trotsky sent a letter to the Central Committee and the [[Central Control Commission of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Control Commission]], attributing these difficulties to lack of intra-Party democracy. Trotsky wrote:

{{Quote|In the fiercest moment of War Communism, the system of appointment within the party did not have one tenth of the extent that it has now. Appointment of the secretaries of provincial committees is now the rule. That creates for the secretary a position essentially independent of the local organization. [...] The bureaucratization of the party apparatus has developed to unheard-of proportions by means of the method of secretarial selection. [...] There has been created a very broad stratum of party workers, entering into the apparatus of the government of the party, who completely renounce their own party opinion, at least the open expression of it, as though assuming that the secretarial hierarchy is the apparatus which creates party opinion and party decisions. Beneath this stratum, abstaining from their own opinions, there lies the broad mass of the party, before whom every decision stands in the form of a summons or a command.&lt;ref&gt;Leon Trotsky, "The First Letter to the Central Committee" contained in the ''Challenge of the Left Opposition: 1923–1925'' (Pathfinder Press: New York, 1975) pp. 55–56.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed, if any --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other senior communists who had similar concerns sent ''[[The Declaration of 46]]'' to the Central Committee on 15 October in which they wrote:

{{Quote|[...] we observe an ever progressing, barely disguised division of the party into a secretarial hierarchy and into "laymen", into professional party functionaries, chosen from above, and the other party masses, who take no part in social life. [...] free discussion within the party has virtually disappeared, party public opinion has been stifled. [...] it is the secretarial hierarchy, the party hierarchy which to an ever greater degree chooses the delegates to the conferences and congresses, which to an ever greater degree are becoming the executive conferences of this hierarchy.}}

Although the text of these letters remained secret at the time, they had a significant effect on the Party leadership and prompted a partial retreat by the ''troika'' and its supporters on the issue of intra-Party democracy, notably in Zinoviev's ''Pravda'' article published on 7 November. Throughout November, the ''troika'' tried to come up with a compromise to placate, or at least temporarily neutralise, Trotsky and his supporters. (Their task was made easier by the fact that Trotsky was sick in November and December.) The first draft of the resolution was rejected by Trotsky, which led to the formation of a special group consisting of Stalin, Trotsky and Kamenev, which was charged with drafting a mutually acceptable compromise. On 5 December, the Politburo and the Central Control Commission unanimously adopted the group's final draft as its resolution. On 8 December, Trotsky published an open letter, in which he expounded on the recently adopted resolution's ideas. The ''troika'' used his letter as an excuse to launch a campaign against Trotsky, accusing him of factionalism, setting "the youth against the fundamental generation of old revolutionary Bolsheviks"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Max Shachtman. ''The Struggle for the New Course'', New York, New International Publishing Co., 1943. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/shachtma/1943/fnc/nc04.htm ''The Campaign Against "Trotskyism"'']&lt;/ref&gt; and other sins.

Trotsky defended his position in a series of seven letters which were collected as ''The New Course'' in January 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Leon Trotsky, "The New Course" contained in ''The Challenge of the Left Opposition: 1923–1925'', pp. 63–144.&lt;!-- publisher, year, ISSN/ISBN, author needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The illusion of a "monolithic Bolshevik leadership" was thus shattered and a lively intra-Party discussion ensued, both in local Party organizations and in the pages of ''Pravda''. The discussion lasted most of December and January until the XIIIth Party Conference of 16–18 January 1924. Those who opposed the Central Committee's position in the debate were thereafter referred to as members of the [[Left Opposition]].&lt;ref name="lom"&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/glossary/orgs/l/e.htm#left-opposition Left Opposition ]; Glossary of organizations on [[Marxists.org]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the ''troika'' controlled the Party apparatus through Stalin's Secretariat and ''Pravda'' through its editor Bukharin, it was able to direct the discussion and the process of delegate selection. Although Trotsky's position prevailed within the Red Army and Moscow universities and received about half the votes in the Moscow Party organisation, it was defeated elsewhere, and the Conference was packed with pro-''troika'' delegates. In the end, only three delegates voted for Trotsky's position, and the Conference denounced "Trotskyism"{{efn|The term "Trotskyism" was first coined by the Russian liberal politician Pavel Milyukov, the first foreign minister in the Provisional Government who, in April 1917, was forced to demand that the British government release Trotsky.}} as a "petty bourgeois deviation". After the Conference, a number of Trotsky's supporters, especially in the Red Army's Political Directorate, were removed from leading positions or reassigned. Nonetheless, Trotsky kept all of his posts, and the ''troika'' was careful to emphasise that the debate was limited to Trotsky's "mistakes" and that removing Trotsky from the leadership was out of the question. In reality, Trotsky had already been cut off from the decision-making process.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

Immediately after the Conference, Trotsky left for a [[Caucasus (geographic region)|Caucasian]] resort to recover from his prolonged illness. On his way, he learned about Lenin's death on 21 January 1924. He was about to return when a follow up telegram from Stalin arrived, giving an incorrect date of the scheduled funeral, which would have made it impossible for Trotsky to return in time. Many commentators speculated after the fact that Trotsky's absence from Moscow in the days following Lenin's death contributed to his eventual loss to Stalin, although Trotsky generally discounted the significance of his absence.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

===After Lenin's death (1924)===
There was little overt political disagreement within the Soviet leadership throughout most of 1924. On the surface, Trotsky remained the most prominent and popular Bolshevik leader, although his "mistakes" were often alluded to by ''troika'' partisans. Behind the scenes, he was completely cut off from the decision-making process. Politburo meetings were pure formalities since all key decisions were made ahead of time by the ''troika'' and its supporters. Trotsky's control over the military was undermined by reassigning his deputy, Ephraim Sklyansky, and appointing [[Mikhail Frunze]], who was being groomed to take Trotsky's place.

At the [[13th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|thirteenth Party Congress]] in May, Trotsky delivered a conciliatory speech:&lt;ref&gt;Chapter VIII of Boris Souvarine's [http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/writers/souvar/works/stalin/ch08.htm ''Stalin: A Critical Survey of Bolshevism'']&lt;!-- publisher, year, ISSN/ISBN, author, page(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|None of us desires or is able to dispute the will of the Party. Clearly, the Party is always right... We can only be right with and by the Party, for history has provided no other way of being in the right. The English have a saying, "My country, right or wrong", whether it is in the right or in the wrong, it is my country. We have much better historical justification in saying whether it is right or wrong in certain individual concrete cases, it is my party... And if the Party adopts a decision which one or other of us thinks unjust, he will say, just or unjust, it is my party, and I shall support the consequences of the decision to the end.&lt;ref&gt;Leon Trotsky, "Speech to the Thirteenth Party Congress on May 26, 1924" contained in ''The Challenge of the Left Opposition: 1923–1925'', pp. 161-62.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Leon Trotsky attends The October Revolution parade 1924.jpg|thumb|[[Andrei Bubnov]], [[Kliment Voroshilov]], Leon Trotsky, [[Mikhail Kalinin]] and [[Mikhail Frunze]] attend The [[October Revolution]] parade on The [[Red Square]] 07 Nov 1924]]

In the meantime, the Left Opposition, which had coagulated somewhat unexpectedly in late 1923 and lacked a definite platform aside from general dissatisfaction with the intra-Party "regime", began to crystallise. It lost some less dedicated members to the harassment by the ''troika'', but it also began formulating a program. 

Economically, the Left Opposition and its theoretician [[Yevgeni Preobrazhensky]] came out against further development of capitalist elements in the Soviet economy and in favour of faster industrialisation. That put them at odds with Bukharin and Rykov, the "Right" group within the Party, who supported the ''troika'' at the time. On the question of world revolution, Trotsky and Karl Radek saw a period of stability in Europe while Stalin and Zinoviev confidently predicted an "acceleration" of revolution in Western Europe in 1924. On the theoretical plane, Trotsky remained committed to the Bolshevik idea that the Soviet Union could not create a true socialist society in the absence of the world revolution, while Stalin gradually came up with a policy of building '[[Socialism in One Country]]'. These ideological divisions provided much of the intellectual basis for the political divide between Trotsky and the Left Opposition on the one hand and Stalin and his allies on the other.

At the thirteenth Congress Kamenev and Zinoviev helped Stalin defuse Lenin's Testament, which belatedly came to the surface. But just after the congress, the ''troika'', always an alliance of convenience, showed signs of weakness. Stalin began making poorly veiled accusations about Zinoviev and Kamenev. Yet in October 1924, Trotsky published ''[[Lessons of October]],''&lt;ref&gt;Leon Trotsky "Lessons of October" contained in ''Challenge of the Left Opposition: 1923–1925'', pp. 199–258.&lt;/ref&gt; an extensive summary of the events of the 1917 revolution.

In it, he described Zinoviev's and Kamenev's opposition to the Bolshevik seizure of power in 1917, something that the two would have preferred be left unmentioned. This started a new round of intra-party struggle, which became known as the ''Literary Discussion'', with Zinoviev and Kamenev again allied with Stalin against Trotsky. Their criticism of Trotsky was concentrated in three areas:

* Trotsky's disagreements and conflicts with Lenin and the Bolsheviks prior to 1917.
* Trotsky's alleged distortion of the events of 1917 in order to emphasise his role and diminish the roles played by other Bolsheviks.
* Trotsky's harsh treatment of his subordinates and other alleged mistakes during the Russian Civil War.

Trotsky was again sick and unable to respond while his opponents mobilised all of their resources to denounce him. They succeeded in damaging his military reputation so much that he was forced to resign as People's Commissar of Army and Fleet Affairs and Chairman of the Revolutionary Military Council on 6 January 1925. Zinoviev demanded Trotsky's expulsion from the Communist Party, but Stalin refused to go along and played the role of a moderate. Trotsky kept his Politburo seat, but was effectively put on probation.

===A year in the wilderness (1925)===
[[File:Leon Trotsky and Leonid Serebryakov attend the Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union May 1925.jpg|left|thumb|Leon Trotsky and [[Leonid Serebryakov]] attend the [[Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union|Congress of Soviets]] of the Soviet Union May 1925]]

1925 was a difficult year for Trotsky. After the bruising ''Literary Discussion'' and losing his Red Army posts, he was effectively unemployed throughout the winter and spring. In May 1925, he was given three posts:  chairman of the Concessions Committee, head of the electro-technical board, and chairman of the scientific-technical board of industry. Trotsky wrote in ''My Life''&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Chapter 22 of [http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch42.htm ''My Life'']&lt;/ref&gt; that he "was taking a rest from politics" and "naturally plunged into the new line of work up to my ears".&lt;ref&gt;Leon Trotsky, ''My Life'' (Pathfinder Press: New York, 1970) p. 520.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of the few political developments that affected Trotsky in 1925, the circumstances surrounding the controversy around Lenin's Testament were described by American Marxist [[Max Eastman]] in his book ''Since Lenin Died'' (1925). The Soviet leadership denounced Eastman's account and used [[party discipline]] to force Trotsky to write an article denying Eastman's version of the events.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In the meantime, the ''troika'' finally broke up. Bukharin and Rykov sided with Stalin while Krupskaya and Soviet Commissar of Finance [[Grigory Sokolnikov]] aligned with Zinoviev and Kamenev. The struggle became open at the September 1925 meeting of the Central Committee and came to a head at the [[14th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|XIVth Party Congress]] in December 1925. With only the [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] Party organization behind them, Zinoviev and Kamenev, dubbed ''The New Opposition'', were thoroughly defeated while Trotsky refused to get involved in the fight and did not speak at the Congress.

=== United Opposition (1926–1927) ===
[[File:Leon Trotsky speaks on the fifth anniversary of Soviet Georgia.jpg|thumb|Leon Trotsky addresses the meeting in [[House of the Unions]] March 1926]]

In early 1926, Zinoviev, Kamenev and their supporters in the "New Opposition" gravitated closer to Trotsky's supporters, and the two groups soon formed an alliance, which also incorporated some smaller opposition groups within the Communist Party. The alliance became known as the [[United Opposition]].

The United Opposition was repeatedly threatened with sanctions by the Stalinist leadership of the Communist Party, and Trotsky had to agree to tactical retreats, mostly to preserve his alliance with Zinoviev and Kamenev. The opposition remained united against [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] throughout 1926 and 1927, especially on the issue of the [[Chinese Nationalist Revolution|Chinese Revolution]]. The methods used by the Stalinists against the Opposition became more and more extreme. At the XVth Party Conference in October 1926, Trotsky could barely speak because of interruptions and catcalls, and at the end of the Conference he lost his Politburo seat. In 1927, Stalin started using the [[Gosudarstvennoye Politicheskoye Upravlenie|GPU]] (Soviet secret police) to infiltrate and discredit the opposition. Rank-and-file oppositionists were increasingly harassed, sometimes expelled from the Party and even arrested.

Soviet policy toward the Chinese Revolution became the ideological line of demarcation between Stalin and the United Opposition. The Chinese Revolution began on 10 October 1911,&lt;ref&gt;Sterling Seagrave, ''Dragon Lady'' (Alfred A. Knopf Inc.: New York, 1992) p. 454.&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in the abdication of the Chinese Emperor, [[Puyi]], on 12 February 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Compilation Group for the "History of Modern China Series, ''The Revolution of 1911'' (Foreign Languages Press: Peking, 1976) p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sun Yat-sen]] established the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]].
{{check quotation}}
In reality, however, the Republic controlled very little of the country. Much of China was divided between various regional warlords. The Republican government established a new "nationalist people's army and a national people's party" — the [[Kuomintang]]. In 1920, the Kuomintang opened relations with Soviet Russia. With Soviet help, the Republic of China built up the nationalist people's army. With the development of the nationalist army, a [[Northern Expedition]] was planned to smash the power of the warlords of the northern part of the country. This Northern Expedition became a point of contention over foreign policy by Stalin and Trotsky. Stalin tried to persuade the small Chinese [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] to merge with the Kuomintang (KMT) Nationalists to bring about a bourgeois revolution before attempting to bring about a Soviet-style working class revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Stalin, "The Prospects of Revolution in China" a speech to the Chinese Commission of the Executive Committee of the Communist International on 30 November 1926" contained in ''J.

Trotsky wanted the Communist Party to complete an orthodox proletarian revolution and have clear class independence from the KMT. Stalin funded the KMT during the expedition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OCI3gnzsYc0C&amp;pg=PA233&amp;dq=trotsky+squeezed+lemon+chiang&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=d9YjTfu3C4GdlgfNiNHkCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=trotsky%20squeezed%20lemon%20chiang&amp;f=false|title=China in war and revolution, 1895–1949|author=Peter Gue Zarrow|year=2005|publisher=Psychology Press|edition=illustrated|volume=Volume 1 of Asia's transformations|isbn=0-415-36447-7|page=233|accessdate=1 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin countered Trotskyist criticism by making a secret speech in which he said that Chiang's right-wing Kuomintang were the only ones capable of defeating the imperialists, that [[Chiang Kai-shek]] had funding from the rich merchants, and that his forces were to be utilized until squeezed for all usefulness like a lemon before being discarded. However, Chiang quickly reversed the tables in the [[Shanghai massacre|Shanghai massacre of 12 April 1927]] by massacring the Communist Party in Shanghai midway through the Northern Expedition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wjCsAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=trotsky+squeezed+lemon+chiang&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=d9YjTfu3C4GdlgfNiNHkCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=trotsky%20squeezed%20lemon%20chiang&amp;f=false|title=Moscow and Chinese Communists|author=Robert Carver North|year=1963|publisher=Stanford University Press|edition=2|isbn=0-8047-0453-8|page=96|accessdate=1 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yMwdWFtgV0QC&amp;pg=PA282&amp;dq=trotsky+squeezed+lemon+chiang&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=d9YjTfu3C4GdlgfNiNHkCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=trotsky%20squeezed%20lemon%20chiang&amp;f=false|title=A history of Russia: Since 1855|author=Walter Moss|year=2005|publisher=Anthem Press|edition=2, illustrated|volume=Volume 2 of A History of Russia|isbn=1-84331-034-1|page=282|accessdate=1 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the catastrophic events in China completely vindicated Trotsky's criticism of Stalin's approach towards the Chinese Revolution, this paled in significance compared to the demoralization that the Soviet masses felt{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} at such a big setback for socialist revolution in China, with this demoralization aiding Stalin and his allies in the Communist Party and the Soviet state. Attacks against the United Opposition quickly increased in volatility and ferocity afterwards.

===Defeat and exile (1927–1928)===
In October 1927, Trotsky and Zinoviev were expelled from the Central Committee. When the United Opposition tried to organize independent demonstrations commemorating the 10th anniversary of the Bolshevik seizure of power in November 1927, the demonstrators were dispersed by force and Trotsky and Zinoviev were expelled from the Communist Party on 12 November. Their leading supporters, from Kamenev down, were expelled in December 1927 by the [[15th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|XVth Party Congress]], which paved the way for mass expulsions of rank-and-file oppositionists as well as internal exile of opposition leaders in early 1928.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

During this time Trotsky gave the eulogy at the funeral of his friend, the Soviet diplomat [[Adolph Joffe]], in November 1927. It would be the last speech that Trotsky would give in the Soviet Union. When the XVth Party Congress made United Opposition views incompatible with membership in the Communist Party, Zinoviev, Kamenev and their supporters capitulated and renounced their alliance with the Left Opposition. Trotsky and most of his followers, on the other hand, refused to surrender and stayed the course. Trotsky was exiled to [[Almaty|Alma Ata, Kazakhstan]] on 31 January 1928. He was expelled from the Soviet Union to [[Turkey]] in February 1929, accompanied by his wife [[Natalia Sedova]] and their eldest son, [[Lev Sedov|Lev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rubenstein |first1=Joshua |title=Leon Trotsky: a revolutionary's life |date=2011 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, CT |isbn=9780300137248 |pages=155-202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fate of Left Oppositionists after Trotsky's exile (1929–1941)===
[[File:Soviet reaction to Leon Trotsky publication.jpg|thumb|The publication of Trotsky's autobiography ''[[My Life (Leon Trotsky autobiography)|My Life]]'' as reported in the Soviet Union in August 1929, with the editors of ''Projector'' titled the publication: "On the service of bourgeoisie"]]

After Trotsky's expulsion from the Soviet Union, Trotskyists within the Soviet Union began to waver. Between 1929 and 1932, most leading members of the Left Opposition surrendered to Stalin, "admitted their mistakes" and were reinstated in the Communist Party. One initial exception to this was [[Christian Rakovsky]], who inspired Trotsky between 1929 and 1934 with his refusal to capitulate as state suppression of any remaining opposition to Stalin increased by the year. In late 1932, Rakovsky had failed with an attempt to flee the [[Soviet Union]], and was exiled to [[Sakha Republic|Yakutia]] in March 1933. Answering Trotsky's request, the French mathematician and Trotskyist [[Jean Van Heijenoort]], together with his fellow activist [[Pierre Frank]], unsuccessfully called on the influential Soviet author [[Maxim Gorky]] to intervene in favor of Christian Rakovsky, and boarded the ship he was traveling on near Constantinople.&lt;ref name="yedlin"&gt;Tova Yedlin, ''Maxim Gorky: A Political Biography'', Praeger/Greenwood, [[Westport, Connecticut|Westport]], 1992, p.201-202. {{ISBN|978-0-275-96605-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Heijenoort, they only managed to meet Gorky's son, Maxim Peshkov, who reportedly told them that his father was indisposed, but promised to pass on their request.&lt;ref name="yedlin"/&gt; Rakovsky was the last prominent Trotskyist to capitulate to Stalin in April 1934, when Rakovsky formally "admitted his mistakes" (his letter to ''[[Pravda]]'', titled ''There Should Be No Mercy'', depicted Trotsky and his supporters as "agents of the German [[Gestapo]]").&lt;ref&gt;Medvedev, p.169&lt;/ref&gt; Rakovsky was appointed to high office in the Commissariat for Health and allowed to return to Moscow, also serving as Soviet ambassador to Japan in 1935.&lt;ref name="autogenerated8"&gt;Feofanov &amp; Barry, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; However, Rakovsky was cited in allegations involving the killing of [[Sergey Kirov]], and was arrested and imprisoned in late 1937, during the [[Great Purge]]).&lt;ref name="faganoppexile"&gt;Fagan, Gus; Biographical Introduction to Christian Rakovsky; chapter ''[https://www.marxists.org/archive/rakovsky/biog/biog5.htm Opposition and Exile]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost all Trotskyists who were still within the Soviet Union's borders were executed in the [[Great Purge]]s of 1936–1938, although Rakovsky survived until the [[Medvedev Forest massacre]] of September 1941, where he was shot dead along with 156 other prisoners on Stalin's orders, less than three months into the [[Operation Barbarossa|Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union]]. Also among the Medvedev Forest victims was Trotsky's sister/Kamenev's first wife, [[Olga Kameneva]].&lt;ref name="ch3"&gt;Parrish, Michael; ''The Lesser Terror: Soviet State Security, 1939-1953''; [https://books.google.com/books?id=NDgv5ognePgC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;lpg=PA69 Chapter 3 The Orel Massacres, the Killings of Senior Military Officers]; p.69; Greenwood Publishing Group, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exile (1929–1940)==
In February 1929, Trotsky was deported from the Soviet Union to his new exile in Turkey. During his first two months in Turkey, Trotsky lived with his wife and eldest son at the Soviet Union Consulate in [[Constantinople]] and then at a nearby hotel in the city. In April 1929, Trotsky, his wife and son were moved to the island of [[Büyükada]] (aka Prinkipo) by the Turkish authorities. On Prinkipo, they were moved into a house called the Yanaros mansion, where Trotsky and his wife lived until July 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxist.com/esteban-volkov-return-to-prinkipo.htm|title=Esteban Volkov: Return to Prinkipo|first=Greg|last=Oxley|date=1 February 2004|publisher=|via=Marxist.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his exile in Turkey, Trotsky was under the surveillance of the Turkish police forces of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal Pasha]]. Trotsky was also at risk from the many former White Army officers who lived on Prinkipo, officers who had opposed the [[October Revolution]] and who had been defeated by Trotsky and the Red Army in the [[Russian Civil War]]. However, Trotsky's European supporters volunteered to serve as bodyguards and assured his safety.&lt;ref name="marxists.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1935/06/french.htm|title=Leon Trotsky: An Open Letter to the French Workers|first=Marxists.org|last=1935|date=10 June 1935|publisher=|via=Marxists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Trotsky House Istanbul.jpg|thumb|left|Trotsky's house, the Yanaros mansion on the island of [[Büyükada]] in Turkey, as it appears today. Trotsky lived at the house from April 1929 until July 1933.]]

In July 1933, Trotsky was offered asylum in France by Prime Minister [[Édouard Daladier]]. Trotsky accepted the offer, but he was forbidden to live in [[Paris]] and soon found himself under the surveillance of the French police. From July 1933 to February 1934, Trotsky and his wife lived in [[Royan]]. The philosopher and activist [[Simone Weil]] also arranged for Trotsky and his bodyguards to stay for a few days at her parents' house.&lt;ref name="marxists.org"/&gt; Following the [[6 February 1934 crisis]] in France, the French minister of internal affairs, [[Albert Sarraut]], signed a decree to deport Trotsky from France.&lt;ref name="marxists.org"/&gt; However, no foreign government was found willing to accept Trotsky within its borders. Accordingly, the French authorities instructed Trotsky to move to a residence in the tiny village of [[Barbizon]] under the strict surveillance of the French police, where Trotsky found his contact with the outside world to be even worse than  during his exile in Turkey.&lt;ref name="marxists.org"/&gt;

In May 1935, soon after the French government had agreed the [[Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance]] with the Soviet Union government, Trotsky was officially told that he was no longer welcome in France. After weighing his options, Trotsky applied to move to Norway. After obtaining permission from then Justice Minister [[Trygve Lie]] to enter the country, Trotsky and his wife became a guest of [[Konrad Knudsen]] at [[Norderhov]], near [[Hønefoss]], and spent over a year living at Knudsen's house, from 18 June 1935 to 2 September 1936, although Trotsky was hospitalized for a few weeks at the nearby [[Oslo University Hospital, Ullevål|Oslo Community Hospital]] from 19 September 1935.&lt;ref name="author"&gt;Oddvar Høidal's ''Trotsky in Norway: Exile, 1935–1937.''&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;

Following French media complaints about Trotsky's role in encouraging the mass strikes in France in May and June 1936 with his articles, the [[Johan Nygaardsvold]]-led Norwegian government began to exhibit disquiet about Trotsky's actions. In the summer of 1936, Trotsky's asylum was increasingly made a political issue by the fascist [[Nasjonal Samling]], led by [[Vidkun Quisling]],&lt;ref name="author"/&gt;&amp;nbsp; along with an increase in pressure from the Soviet government on the Norwegian authorities. On 5 August 1936, Knudsen's house was burgled by fascists from the Nasjonal Samling while Trotsky and his wife were out on a seashore trip with Knudsen and his wife. The fascist burglars targeted Trotsky's works and archives for vandalism. The raid was largely thwarted by Knudsen's daughter, Hjørdis, although the burglars did take a few papers from the nearest table as they left.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1936/12/nor.htm|title=Leon Trotsky in Norway (1936)|first=Marxists.org|last=1937|date=January 1937|publisher=|via=Marxists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the fascist perpetrators were caught and put on trial, the "evidence" obtained in the burglary was used by the government to make claims against Trotsky.&lt;ref name="author"/&gt;&amp;nbsp;

[[File:Leon Trotsky House, Mexico City (7144251529).jpg|thumb|Trotsky's house in [[Mexico City]] from April 1939 until his assassination in August 1940]]

On 14 August 1936, the Soviet Press Agency [[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union|TASS]] announced the discovery of a "Trotskyist–Zinovievist" plot and the imminent start of the [[Moscow Trials|Trial of the Sixteen]] accused. Trotsky demanded a complete and open enquiry into Moscow's accusations. The accused were sentenced to death, including [[Grigory Zinoviev]] and [[Lev Kamenev]], and executed on 25 August 1936. On 26 August 1936, eight policemen arrived at Knudsen's house demanding that Trotsky sign new conditions for residing in Norway. These conditions included agreeing to write no more about current political matters, to give no interviews, and to have all his correspondence (incoming and outgoing) inspected by the police. Trotsky categorically refused the conditions, and Trotsky was then told that he and his wife would soon be moved to another residence.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The following day Trotsky was interrogated by the police about his political activities, with the police officially citing Trotsky as a "witness" to the fascist raid of 5 August 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1936/12/nor.htm|title=Leon Trotsky in Norway|first=Marxists.org|last=December 1936|accessdate=8 March 2018|publisher=Marxists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 September 1936, four weeks after the fascist break-in at Knudsen's house, Trygve Lie ordered that Trotsky and his wife be transferred to a farm in [[Hurum]],&lt;ref name=Hurum&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dagsavisen.no/fremtiden/en-sensasjonell-rettssak/|title=En sensasjonell rettssak|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where they were under house arrest.&lt;ref name="author"/&gt;&amp;nbsp; The treatment of Trotsky and his wife at Hurum was harsh, as they were forced to stay indoors for 22 hours per day under the constant guard of thirteen policemen, with only one hour permitted twice a day for a walk on the farm.&lt;ref name="author"/&gt;&amp;nbsp; Trotsky was prevented from posting any letters and prevented from arguing back against his critics in Norway and beyond. Only Trotsky's lawyers and the [[Labour Party (Norway)|Norwegian Labour Party]] Parliamentary leader, [[Olav Scheflo]], were permitted to visit.&lt;ref name="author"/&gt;&amp;nbsp; From October 1936, even the outdoor walks were prohibited for Trotsky and his wife.&lt;ref name="author"/&gt;&amp;nbsp; Trotsky did eventually manage to smuggle out one letter on 18 December 1936, titled ''The Moscow "Confessions"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1936/03/confession.htm|title=The Moscow "Confessions" |first=Marxists.org |last=1936|date=18 December 1936|publisher=|via=Marxists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 December 1936, Trotsky and his wife were deported from Norway after being put on the Norwegian oil tanker ''Ruth'', under guard by [[Jonas Lie (government minister)|Jonas Lie]]. When later living in Mexico, Trotsky was utterly scathing about the treatment he received during his 108 days at Hurum, and accused the Norwegian government of trying to prevent him from publicly voicing his strong opposition to the Trial of the Sixteen and other show trials, saying:

From January 1937 to April 1939, Trotsky and his wife lived in the [[Coyoacán]] area of Mexico City at [[Frida Kahlo Museum|La Casa Azul (The Blue House)]], the home of the painter [[Diego Rivera]] and Rivera's wife and fellow painter, [[Frida Kahlo]], with whom Trotsky had an affair.&lt;ref&gt;Herrera, Hayden (1983).

[[File:Trotskycannon.felixmorrow.jpg|thumb|upright|[[James P. Cannon|James Cannon]] and [[Felix Morrow]] with a bust of Trotsky]]
Trotsky wrote prolifically while in exile, penning several key works, including his ''[[History of the Russian Revolution]]'' (1930) and ''[[The Revolution Betrayed]]'' (1936), a critique of the Soviet Union under [[Stalinism]]. He argued that the Soviet state had become a "[[degenerated workers' state]]" controlled by an undemocratic bureaucracy, which would eventually either be overthrown via a [[political revolution]] establishing a workers' democracy, or degenerate into a capitalist class.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

While in Mexico, Trotsky also worked closely with [[James P. Cannon]], [[Joseph Hansen (socialist)|Joseph Hansen]], and [[Farrell Dobbs]] of the [[Socialist Workers Party (US)|Socialist Workers Party]] of the United States, and other supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://spartacus-educational.com/USAcannonJ.htm|title=James P. Cannon|work=Spartacus Educational|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cannon, a long-time leading member of the American communist movement, had supported Trotsky in the struggle against Stalinism since he had first read Trotsky's criticisms of the Soviet Union in 1928. Trotsky's critique of the Stalinist regime, though banned, was distributed to leaders of the [[Comintern]]. Among his other supporters was [[Chen Duxiu]], founder of the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Chen, Duxiu.

===Moscow show trials===
In August 1936, the first Moscow show trial of the so-called "Trotskyite–Zinovievite Terrorist Center" was staged in front of an international audience. During the trial, Zinoviev, Kamenev and 14 other accused, most of them prominent Old Bolsheviks, confessed to having plotted with Trotsky to kill Stalin and other members of the Soviet leadership. The court found everybody guilty and sentenced the defendants to death, Trotsky [[trial in absentia|''in absentia'']]. The second show trial, of [[Karl Radek]], [[Grigori Sokolnikov]], [[Yuri Pyatakov]] and 14 others, took place in January 1937, during which more alleged conspiracies and crimes were linked to Trotsky. In April 1937, an independent [[Dewey Commission|"Commission of Inquiry"]] into the charges made against Trotsky and others at the "Moscow Trials" was held in Coyoacán, with [[John Dewey]] as chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1937/dewey/index.htm|title=Marxists.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings were published in the book ''Not Guilty''.&lt;ref&gt;''Not Guilty; Report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Charges Made Against Leon Trotsky in the Moscow Trials, John Dewey, chairman'', New York, London, Harper &amp; brothers, 1938, xv, 422 pp. 2nd edition New York, Monad Press, distributed by Pathfinder Press 1973, c. 1972 xxiii.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fourth International ===
{{Main|Fourth International}}
For fear of splitting the Communist movement, Trotsky initially opposed the idea of establishing parallel Communist parties or a parallel international Communist organization that would compete with the [[Third International]]. In mid-1933, after the [[Nazism|Nazi]] takeover in Germany and the Comintern's response to it, he changed his mind. He said,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-ger/330715.htm|title=Marxists.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that:

{{Quote|An organization which was not roused by the thunder of fascism and which submits docilely to such outrageous acts of the bureaucracy demonstrates thereby that it is dead and that nothing can ever revive it... In all our subsequent work it is necessary to take as our point of departure the historical collapse of the official Communist International.&lt;ref&gt;Leon Trotsky. ''To Build Communist Parties and an International Anew'', 15 July 1933.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1938, Trotsky and his supporters founded the [[Fourth International]], which was intended to be a revolutionary and internationalist alternative to the Stalinist Comintern.

===Dies Committee===
[[File:Leon Trotsky and American admirers. Mexico - NARA - 283642.jpg|thumb|Trotsky with American comrades, including [[Harry DeBoer]] (left) in Mexico, shortly before his assassination, 1940]]
Towards the end of 1939, Trotsky agreed to go to the United States to appear as a witness before the Dies Committee of the House of Representatives, a forerunner of the [[House Un-American Activities Committee|House Committee on Un-American Activities]]. Representative [[Martin Dies Jr.|Martin Dies]], chairman of the committee, demanded the suppression of the [[Communist Party USA|American Communist Party]]. Trotsky intended to use the forum to expose the NKVD's activities against him and his followers.

He made it clear that he also intended to argue against the suppression of the American Communist Party, and to use the committee as a platform for a call to transform World War II into a world revolution. Many of his supporters argued against his appearance. When the committee learned the nature of the testimony Trotsky intended to present, it refused to hear him, and he was denied a visa to enter the United States. On hearing about it, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union immediately accused Trotsky of being in the pay of the oil magnates and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]].&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Deutscher.

===Final months===
After quarreling with Diego Rivera, Trotsky moved to his final residence on Avenida Viena in April 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Patenaude, Bertrand M. (2009) Trotsky: Downfall of a Revolutionary New York: HarperCollins; {{ISBN|978-0-06-082068-8}}, pp. 171–173.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 February 1940, Trotsky wrote a document known as "Trotsky's Testament", in which he expressed his final thoughts and feelings for posterity. He was suffering from [[hypertension|high blood pressure]], and feared that he would suffer a [[cerebral haemorrhage]].&lt;ref name=Testament&gt;[http://www.newyouth.com/content/view/169/68/ "Trotsky's Testament"] (27 February 1940) Retrieved 12 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; After forcefully denying Stalin's accusations that he had betrayed the working class, he thanked his friends and above all his wife, Natalia Sedova, for their loyal support:{{Quote|In addition to the happiness of being a fighter for the cause of socialism, fate gave me the happiness of being her husband.

==Assassination==
[[File:Trotsky last office.jpg|thumb|The Study where Leon Trotsky was assassinated with an ice axe on 20 August 1940]]
After an ineffectual attempt to have Trotsky murdered in March 1939, Stalin assigned the overall organization of implementing the task to the NKVD officer [[Pavel Sudoplatov]], who in turn co-opted [[Nahum Eitingon]]. According to Sudoplatov's ''[[Special Tasks]]'', the NKVD proceeded to set up three NKVD agent networks to carry out the murder, one of which relied on [[Ramón Mercader]]. According to Sudoplatov, all three networks were designed to operate entirely autonomously from the NKVD's hitherto-established spy networks in the U.S. and Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pavel Sudoplatov|author2=Anatoli Sudoplatov|author3=Jerrold L.

On 24 May 1940, Trotsky survived a raid on [[Leon Trotsky Museum, Mexico City|his villa]] by armed assassins led by the NKVD agent [[Iosif Romualdovich Grigulevich|Iosif Grigulevich]] and Mexican painter [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1940/05/25/archives/trotsky-injured-in-attack-on-home-leon-trotsky-and-home-in-mexico.html |title=TROTSKY INJURED IN ATTACK ON HOME; LEON TROTSKY AND HOME IN MEXICO WHERE HE WAS ATTACKED |first=Times Wide World |last=1939 |date=25 May 1940 |publisher=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trotsky's 14-year-old grandson, Vsevolod Platonovich "Esteban" Volkov (born 7 March 1926), was shot in the foot, and a young assistant and bodyguard of Trotsky, [[Robert Sheldon Harte]], was abducted and later murdered.

On 20 August 1940, Trotsky was attacked in his study by Mercader, who used an [[ice axe]] as a weapon.&lt;ref&gt;[[Isaac Don Levine]], ''The mind of an assassin'' (New American Library: New York, 1960) {{ISBN| 0313209723}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blow to his head was bungled and failed to kill Trotsky instantly. Witnesses stated that Trotsky spat on Mercader and began struggling fiercely with him, which resulted in Mercader's hand being broken. Hearing the commotion, Trotsky's bodyguards burst into the room and nearly killed Mercader, but Trotsky stopped them, laboriously stating that the assassin should be made to answer questions.&lt;ref name="assassin"/&gt; Trotsky was then taken to a hospital, operated on, and survived for more than a day, dying at the age of 60 on 21 August 1940 from exsanguination and shock.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, Lynn, [http://www.marxist.net/trotsky/life/life.htm The Assassination of Trotsky], ''Militant International Review'', Summer 1980; retrieved 29 July 2007.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Enrique Soto-Perez-de-Celis MD, "The Death of Leon Trotsky", Neurosurgery 67: 417–23, 2010 [http://journals.lww.com/neurosurgery/Abstract/2010/08000/The_Death_of_Leon_Trotsky.33.aspx]&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Mercader later testified at his trial:{{Quote|I laid my raincoat on the table in such a way as to be able to remove the ice axe which was in the pocket.

===Legacy===
[[File:Trotsky grave.jpg|thumb|upright|Leon Trotsky's grave in [[Coyoacán]], where his ashes are buried]]
Trotsky's house in [[Coyoacán]] was preserved in much the same condition as it was on the day of the assassination and is now the [[Leon Trotsky Museum, Mexico City|Leon Trotsky Museum]], run by a board which includes his grandson Esteban Volkov. Trotsky's grave is located in its grounds. The foundation "International Friends of the Leon Trotsky Museum" has been organized to raise funds to further improve the museum.

Trotsky was never formally [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]] during the rule of the Soviet government, despite the [[Glasnost]]-era rehabilitation of most other [[Old Bolshevik]]s killed during the Great Purges. His son, [[Sergei Sedov]], killed in 1937, was rehabilitated in 1988, as was [[Nikolai Bukharin]]. Beginning in 1989, Trotsky's books, forbidden until 1987, were published in the Soviet Union.

Trotsky was rehabilitated on 16 June 2001 by the [[Prosecutor General of Russia|General Prosecutor's Office]] (Certificates of Rehabilitation No. 13/2182-90, No. 13-2200-99 in Archives Research Center "Memorial").&lt;ref&gt;[http://memorial-nic.org/iofe/3.html В.

Verónica Volkow, another daughter, is a poet and teacher of history of art in Mexico's National University.

==Contributions to theory==
{{more citations needed|section|date=March 2018}}
{{Main|Trotskyism}}

Trotsky considered himself a "Bolshevik-Leninist", arguing for the establishment of a [[vanguard party]]. He considered himself an advocate of orthodox Marxism.

His politics differed in many respects from those of Stalin or [[Mao Zedong]], most importantly in his rejection of the theory of [[Socialism in One Country]] and his declaring the need for an international "[[permanent revolution]]". Numerous [[Fourth International]]ist groups around the world continue to describe themselves as Trotskyist and see themselves as standing in this tradition, although they have different interpretations of the conclusions to be drawn from this. Supporters of the Fourth International echo Trotsky's opposition to Stalinist [[totalitarianism]], advocating [[political revolution]], arguing that socialism cannot sustain itself without democracy.

=== Permanent Revolution ===
{{Main|Permanent revolution}}
[[File:Diego rivera Commies.jpg|thumb|A [[Diego Rivera]] mural depicts Trotsky with [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] as a true champion of the workers' struggle]]

Permanent Revolution is the theory that the [[bourgeois]] democratic tasks in countries with delayed bourgeois democratic development can only be accomplished through the establishment of a workers' state, and that the creation of a workers' state would inevitably involve inroads against capitalist property. Thus, the accomplishment of bourgeois democratic tasks passes over into [[proletarian]] tasks. Although most closely associated with Leon Trotsky, the call for Permanent Revolution is first found in the writings of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] in March 1850, in the aftermath of the [[1848 Revolution]], in their [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/communist-league/1850-ad1.htm Address] of the Central Committee to the [[Communist League]]:

{{Quote|It is our interest and our task to make the revolution permanent until all the more or less propertied classes have been driven from their ruling positions, until the proletariat has conquered state power and until the association of the proletarians has progressed sufficiently far – not only in one country but in all the leading countries of the world – that competition between the proletarians of these countries ceases and at least the decisive forces of production are concentrated in the hands of the workers. ... Their battle-cry must be: "The Permanent Revolution.}}

Trotsky's conception of Permanent Revolution is based on his understanding, drawing on the work of the founder of Russian Marxism [[Georgy Plekhanov]], that in 'backward' countries the tasks of the Bourgeois Democratic Revolution could not be achieved by the bourgeoisie itself. This conception was first developed by Trotsky in collaboration with [[Alexander Parvus]] in late 1904–1905. The relevant articles were later collected in Trotsky's books ''1905'' and in ''Permanent Revolution'', which also contains his essay "[[Results and Prospects]]".

According to Trotskyists, the [[October Revolution]] was the first example of a successful Permanent Revolution. The proletarian, socialist October Revolution took place precisely because the bourgeoisie, which took power in February, had not been able to solve any of the tasks of the bourgeois-democratic revolution. It had not given the land to the peasants (which the Bolsheviks did on 25 October), nor given freedom to the oppressed minority nations, nor emancipated Russia from foreign domination by ending the war which, at that point, was fought mainly to please the British and French creditors. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Trotskyists today argue that the state of the Third World shows that capitalism offers no way forward for underdeveloped countries, thus again proving the central tenet of the theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Editorial Board|title=The mass uprising in Tunisia and the perspective of permanent revolution|url=https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2011/01/pers-j17.html|work=[[World Socialist Web Site]]|publisher=International Committee of the Fourth International|accessdate=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The United Front===
{{Main|United Front}}
Trotsky was a central figure in the [[Comintern]] during its first four congresses. During this time he helped to generalise the strategy and tactics of the Bolsheviks to newly formed Communist parties across Europe and further afield. From 1921 onwards the [[united front]], a method of uniting revolutionaries and reformists in common struggle while winning some of the workers to revolution, was the central tactic put forward by the Comintern after the defeat of the German revolution.

After he was exiled and politically marginalised by Stalinism, Trotsky continued to argue for a united front against fascism in Germany and Spain. According to Joseph Choonara of the British [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]] in ''[[International Socialism (magazine)|International Socialism]]'', his articles on the united front represent an important part of his political legacy.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Choonara, [http://www.isj.org.uk/index.php4?id=397&amp;issue=117 "The United Front"], ''[[International Socialism (magazine)|International Socialism]]'', 117&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29241">'''Latin manuscripts of the New Testament''' are handwritten copies of translations from the Greek originals. Translations of the New Testament are called ''versions''. They are important in [[textual criticism]], because sometimes versions provide evidence (called a ''witness'') to an earlier reading of the Greek, i.e. to the text that may have been lost (or preserved only very poorly) in the subsequent Greek tradition. It is also hypothesised that, in some cases, for example, in the case of the [[Codex Bezae]], early Latin manuscripts may have influenced some early Greek manuscripts. Thus, accidentally or deliberately, some Latin readings may have "crossed back over" into the Greek. One possible example of this is the well known [[Comma Johanneum]].

Latin manuscripts are divided into "Old Latin" and [[Vulgate]]. Old Latin manuscripts, also called ''[[Vetus Latina]]'' or ''Itala'', are so called not because they are written in [[Old Latin]] (i.e. Latin prior to 75 BC), but because they are the oldest versions of the New Testament in Latin. From the linguistic point of view, Old Latin New Testament manuscripts may at times use non-standard grammar and vocabulary.

Unlike the Vulgate, the Vetus Latina tradition reflects numerous distinct, similar, and not entirely independent translations of various New Testament texts, extending back to the time of the original Greek autographs.&lt;ref&gt;"There is no such thing as a uniform version of the New Testament in Latin prior to Jerome's Vulgate". Elliott (1997:202).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 382 AD [[Jerome]] began a revision of the existing Vetus Latina into contemporary Latin, corrected against manuscripts in the original Greek and Hebrew. [[List of New Testament Latin manuscripts#Jerome's version|Jerome's version]] is known as the [[Vulgate]].&lt;ref&gt;Metzger, UBS4.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clarification ==
=== Identification ===

The list of Old Latin manuscripts below is based on citations in ''[[Novum Testamentum Graece]]'' (NA27) and ''The Greek New Testament'' ([[United Bible Societies|UBS]]4). Each manuscript is identified first by its [[Scribal abbreviation|siglum]] (the first column, '''s.''', in the table), as given by the [[critical apparatus]] of the editions mentioned. These sigla are related to content, so are not unique. For example, the letter ''t'' refers to Codex Bernensis in the [[gospel]]s, but [[Liber Comicus]] elsewhere. So sigla need disambiguation. In the table below, this is done by providing a full name. Additionally, the standard unique serial number for each manuscript is provided. Taken together sigla, name and number provide unambiguous identification, and some further information regarding the content, history and relationship of manuscripts.

Sigla, names and numbers exist to serve different scholastic purposes. Sigla, in the context of reference to an ''original'' document, provide unique and concise identification of witnesses to the text of that original, suited to minimizing the space taken by citation in a critical apparatus. Names, on the other hand, normally refer to specific handwritten ''volumes'' (often including other text), either as originally bound or in their current form. Names are typically Latin, and can refer to the place of composition ([[Abbey library of Saint Gall|Codex Sangallensis]], "Book from [[Abbey of St. Gall|St. Gall]]") or rediscovery ([[Stonyhurst Gospel]]), the current location (Liber Ardmachanus, "[[Book of Armagh]]"), a famous owner (Codex Bezae, "[[Theodore Beza]]'s Book"), a volume's function (Liber Comicus, "The Lectionary"), or can even refer to physical characteristics of a volume ([[Codex Gigas]], "The Huge Book" or [[Codex Aureus (disambiguation)|Codex Aureus]], "The Gold Book"). The [[Book of Mulling]] is also known as Liber Moliensis after the name of the scribe, as tradition has it.

==== Beuron numbers ====

The [[Beuron Archabbey|Beuron]] Ancient Latin Institute (''Vetus Latina Institut'') has introduced a new numerical system for Old Latin manuscripts, of which there are about 90 altogether. These ''Beuron numbers'' are designed to provide unambiguous identification of witnesses in academic usage, yet they are not used very widely in general literature, as they may cause confusion with the Greek minuscule manuscripts.

Beuron Institute allocated numbers up to 100 to all existing Old Latin manuscripts, depending on what parts of NT they include, and how old their text is. The lowest numbers are allocated to the gospels, and to the most complete manuscripts. For example, Codex Bezae (d) is a witness for the Gospels (Gosp), the [[Book of Acts]] and the [[General epistles]] (Gen), and is allocated number 5.
* Manuscripts 1-49 are witnesses to one or more Gospels.
* Manuscripts 50-74 are witnesses to Acts, General epistles or the [[Book of Revelation]] (Rev).
* Manuscripts 75-89 are witnesses to [[Pauline epistles]] (Paul).
* Manuscripts 91-96 are [[Bible gloss|gloss]]es in Spanish Bibles.

=== Other issues ===

NA27 and UBS4 interact with the Vulgate witness only at the level of critical editions, not at the level of manuscripts themselves. The manuscripts that provide evidence of Jerome's version are identified in the apparatus of ''Biblia Sacra Vulgata'' (the [[Vulgate#Weber-Gryson (Stuttgart) edition|Stuttgart edition of the Vulgate]]).

In practice, citation of manuscript evidence implies any of several methodologies. The ideal, but most costly, method is physical inspection of the manuscript itself; alternatively, published photographs or [[facsimile]] editions may be inspected. This method involves [[Paleography|paleographical]] analysis—interpretation of handwriting, incomplete letters and even reconstruction of [[lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]]. More typically, editions of manuscripts are consulted, which have done this paleographical work already. The lists below note the names of the editors of standard editions of the manuscripts listed. As a last resort, sometimes a critical edition of NT, that cites readings of a manuscript in its apparatus, may be offered as authority for the text of the manuscript at these points.

It must also be observed that certain Latin NT manuscripts may present a mixture of Vulgate and Old Latin texts. For example, [[Codex Sangermanensis]] (g&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; ) is Old Latin in Matthew, but Vulgate in the rest of the Gospels. Also, the text of John in Codex Veronensis is believed to be part Old Latin and part Vulgate. Hence, some codices are cited as manuscript witnesses ''both'' to the Vetus Latina and to the Vulgate.

== Old Latin ==

The table below employs the following conventions.
* Dates are estimated to the nearest 50 year increment.
* Content is given to the nearest book (sometimes chapter); verses and lacunae are not listed.
* Editions are those consulted by UBS4; in many cases, better editions are also available.
* Locations are given in [[anglicisation|anglicised]] form, unless linked to sources in other languages.
* Manuscripts will sometimes be referred to as "it" followed by the siglum.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6420">'''Lorenzo Marsili''' (born 1984) is an author, political activist and social entrepreneur.

== Life and activity ==
Marsili was born in Rome, Italy. At 21, after graduating in philosophy from the [[University of London]], he established the Postanalytic Group&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thecollectivelounge.blogspot.de/2004/05/people-from-postanalytic.html|title=the collective lounge|website=thecollectivelounge.blogspot.de|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; in protest against the hegemony of analytical philosophy in the UK. Soon after he founded the quarterly cultural review [[Naked Punch Review|Naked Punch]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amnesiavivace.it/sommario/rivista/brani/pezzo.asp?id=304|title=AV ONLINE - [20 § Interviste] Intervista a Lorenzo Marsili (Naked Punch) (Valerio Cruciani)|website=www.amnesiavivace.it|access-date=2016-11-30|issn=1722-2737}}&lt;/ref&gt; together with contributors such as [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak|Gayatry Spivak]], [[Jacques Rancière|Jacques Ranciere]] and others.

After spending time in China and obtaining a second degree from the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]] he launched Transnational Dialogues,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.e-artnow.org/announcement/article/ACTION/12390/|title=e-artnow.org: Announcement detail view|last=stránok|first=BSP Magnetica, s.r.o. - výroba webových|website=www.e-artnow.org|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; an exchange program between Chinese and European artists and activists. In 2007, on the 50th anniversary of the [[Treaty of Rome|Treaties of Rome]], he established pan-European network [[European Alternatives]], developing it into an international NGO with offices in London, Berlin, Paris and Rome. He established [[Transeuropa Festival]] and was the artistic director of the first four editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/can-europe-make-it/adam-ramsay/homage-to-belgrade-reflections-on-2015-transeuropa-festival|title=Homage to Belgrade: reflections on the 2015 Transeuropa festival|date=2015-10-16|website=openDemocracy|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 he launched the European Media Initiative, gathering 200,000 signatures to demand an EU directive on media freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/mediapolicyproject/2013/03/12/a-unified-eu-policy-on-pluralism-uk-citizens-set-to-join-the-debate/|title=A Unified EU Policy on Pluralism?

In 2016 he becomes one of the initiators of pan-European movement [[Democracy in Europe Movement 2025|DiEM25]] together with [[Yanis Varoufakis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://politicalcritique.org/world/eu/2016/marsili-remain-to-change-is-diems-message-interview/|title=Marsili: Remain to change is DiEM’s message [Interview]|date=2016-06-23|newspaper=Political Critique|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/can-europe-make-it/diem25/leading-activists-artists-scholars-and-political-figures-take-central-role|title=Leading activists, artists, scholars and political figures take central role in DiEM25|date=2016-10-05|website=openDemocracy|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He writes for various European newspapers, including [[The Guardian|''The Guardian'']], ''El Diario'', ''[[El País]]'', [[Al Jazeera English|''Al Jazeera'']], ''[[Neues Deutschland]]'', ''[[Il manifesto]]'', ''[[Il Fatto Quotidiano]]'', ''[[The Huffington Post|Huffington Post]]'', ''[[OpenDemocracy]]''. He is a  guest on Italian national TV [[Rai 3|Rai3]], [[La7]], on [[Al Jazeera]] and is host of ''TalkReal'', a nomadic Europe-wide talk show.

== Political thought on Europe ==
In his books "Il Terzo Spazio" ({{ISBN|978-8858128282}}) and "Citizens of Nowhere" ({{ISBN|978-1786993694}}) he responds directly to the crisis of the European Union and the rise of the nationalist right by proposing a third way between the maintaining the status quo and accepting the demise of the European project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Il Terzo Spazio - oltre establishment e populismo|last=Marsili|first=Lorenzo|publisher=Laterza|year=2017|isbn=978-8858128282|location=Bari, Italy|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marsili has argued that "the nation-state is not the solution, but part of the problem&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://euroalter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Towards-a-transnational-democracy-for-Europe.pdf|title=Towards a transnational democracy for Europe|last=Marsili|first=Lorenzo|last2=Niccolo|first2=Milanese|publisher=EA|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;", while strongly criticising the existing structures of the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/can-europe-make-it/lorenzo-marsili/tennis-court-oath-for-europe|title=A tennis court oath for Europe|date=2015-03-04|website=openDemocracy|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been defined "the Italian response to the euro-sceptics&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.panorama.it/news/marco-ventura-profeta-di-ventura/european-alternatives-think-europeisti/|title=L'alternativa italiana agli anti euro - Panorama|last=Pedersini|first=Marco|date=2013-11-22|newspaper=Panorama|language=it-IT|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;" and is an outspoken advocate of the need for pan-European political parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/brexit-eu-referendum-nobody-speaking-up-for-europeans-europe-politics-a7108951.html|title=After Brexit, nobody is speaking up for Europeans|date=2016-06-29|newspaper=The Independent|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a booklet written together with Niccolo Milanese, he has argued for the need of a pan-European constituent process to draft new Treaties for the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://euroalter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Towards-a-transnational-democracy-for-Europe1.pdf|title=Towards a Transnational Democracy for Europe|last=Marsili|first=Lorenzo|publisher=European Alternatives|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 | title       = A Mantra Chant
 | description = A mantra chant set to Indian classical music (6 minutes 19 seconds)&lt;ref&gt;This is a Buddhist chant. The words in Pali are: Buddham saranam gacchami, Dhammam saranam gacchami, Sangham saranam gacchami. The equivalent words in Sanskrit, according to [[Georg Feuerstein]], are: Buddham saranam gacchâmi, Dharmam saranam gacchâmi, Sangham saranam gacchâmi. The literal meaning: I go for refuge in knowledge, I go for refuge in teachings, I go for refuge in community. In some traditions of Hinduism, the mantra is expanded to seven lines, with first word of the additional lines being Satyam (truth), Ahimsam (non-violence), Yogam (yoga) and Ekam (one universal life). For example, an additional line with Ahimsam is: Ahimsam saranam gacchâmi.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use, structure, function, importance, and types of mantras vary according to the school and philosophy of Hinduism and Buddhism. Mantras serve a central role in [[tantra]].&lt;ref name=staal/&gt;&lt;ref name="Teun Goudriaan 1981"&gt;Teun Goudriaan (1981), Hindu Tantric and Śākta Literature, in A History of Indian Literature, Vol. 2, {{ISBN|978-3447020916}}, Chapter VIII&lt;/ref&gt; In this school, mantras are considered to be a sacred formula and a deeply personal ritual, effective only after initiation. In other schools of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism or Sikhism, initiation is not a requirement.&lt;ref name=boyce/&gt;&lt;ref name=halper&gt;Harvey Alper (1989), Understanding Mantras, {{ISBN|81-208-0746-4}}, State University of New York&lt;/ref&gt;

Mantras come in many forms, including ''ṛc'' (verses from the Rigveda for example) and ''sāman'' (musical chants from the Sāmaveda for example).&lt;ref name=jgtim/&gt;&lt;ref name=staal/&gt; They are typically melodic, mathematically structured meters, believed to be resonant with numinous qualities. At its simplest, the word [[Om|ॐ (Aum, Om)]] serves as a mantra. In more sophisticated forms, mantras are melodic phrases with spiritual interpretations such as a human longing for truth, reality, light, immortality, peace, love, knowledge, and action.&lt;ref name=jgtim/&gt;&lt;ref name=halper/&gt; Some mantras have no literal meaning, yet are musically uplifting and spiritually meaningful.&lt;ref name=staal/&gt;

==Etymology and origins==
[[Image:Mantras written on a rock in nepal.jpg|thumb|Mantras written on a rock near [[Namche Bazaar]] [[Nepal]]]]
The Sanskrit word ''{{IAST|[[:wikt:mantra|mantra-]]}}'' (m.; also n. ''mantram'' in Tamil, the Sanskrit word 'Mantra' derived from Tamil word 'Mantram') consists of the root ''man-'' "to think" (also in ''[[:wikt:manas|manas]]'' "mind") and the suffix ''-tra'', designating tools or instruments, hence a literal translation would be "instrument of thought".&lt;ref&gt;Macdonell, Arthur A., ''A Sanskrit Grammar for Students'' § 182.1.b, p. 162(Oxford University Press, 3rd edition, 1927).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, W.D., ''Sanskrit Grammar'' § 1185.c, p. 449(New York, 2003, {{ISBN|0-486-43136-3}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars&lt;ref name=jgtim&gt;[[Jan Gonda]] (1963), The Indian Mantra, Oriens, Vol. 16, pages 244–297&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=staal&gt;[[Frits Staal]] (1996), Rituals and Mantras, Rules without meaning, {{ISBN|978-8120814127}}, Motilal Banarsidass&lt;/ref&gt; consider mantras to be older than 1000 BC. By the middle [[Vedas|Vedic period]]—1000 BC to 500 BC—claims [[Frits Staal]], mantras in Hinduism had developed into a blend of art and science.&lt;ref name=staal/&gt;

The Chinese translation is {{lang-zh|t=眞言, 真言|p=zhenyan|l=true words|labels=no}}, the Japanese [[on'yomi]] reading of the Chinese being ''[[shingon]]'' (which is also used as the proper name for the prominent esoteric [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon sect]]).

According to Bernfried Schlerath, the concept of ''sātyas mantras'' is found in Indo-Iranian [[Yasna]] 31.6 and the [[Rigveda]], where it is considered structured thought in conformity with the reality or poetic (religious) formulas associated with inherent fulfillment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Schlerath|first=Bernfried|year=1987| chapter="Aša: Avestan Aša"| title=Encyclopaedia Iranica| volume=2 | location=New York|publisher=Routledge |pages=694–696}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mantras are neither unique to Hinduism nor other Indian religions such as Buddhism; similar creative constructs developed in Asian and Western traditions as well.&lt;ref name=staal/&gt; Mantras, suggests [[Frits Staal]], may be older than language.

==Definition==

There is no generally accepted definition of mantra.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Alper (1989), Understanding Mantras, {{ISBN|81-208-0746-4}}, State University of New York, page 3-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Renou has defined mantra as a thought.&lt;ref&gt;T Renou (1946), ''Littérature Sanskrite'', Paris, page 74&lt;/ref&gt; Mantras are structured formulae of thoughts, claims Silburn.&lt;ref&gt;L. Silburn (1955), Instant et cause, Paris, page 25&lt;/ref&gt; Farquhar concludes that mantras are a religious thought, prayer, sacred utterance, but also believed to be a spell or weapon of supernatural power.&lt;ref&gt;J. Farquhar (1920), An outline of the religious literature of India, Oxford, page 25&lt;/ref&gt; Zimmer defines mantra as a verbal instrument to produce something in one’s mind.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Robert Zimmer (1946), Myths and symbols in Indian art and civilization, {{ISBN|9780691017785}}, Washington DC, page 72&lt;/ref&gt; Bharati defines mantra, in the context of the Tantric school of Hinduism, to be a combination of mixed genuine and quasi-morphemes arranged in conventional patterns, based on codified esoteric traditions, passed on from a guru to a disciple through prescribed initiation.&lt;ref name=bharati&gt;Agehananda Bharati (1965), The Tantric Tradition, London: Rider and Co., {{ISBN|0-8371-9660-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jan Gonda]], a widely cited scholar on Indian mantras,&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Alper (1989), Understanding Mantras, {{ISBN|81-208-0746-4}}, State University of New York, page 9&lt;/ref&gt; defines mantra as general name for the verses, formulas or sequence of words in prose which contain praise, are believed to have religious, magical or spiritual efficiency, which are meditated upon, recited, muttered or sung in a ritual, and which are collected in the methodically arranged ancient texts of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=jgvl&gt;Jan Gonda (1975), Vedic Literature (Samhitäs and Brähmanas), (HIL I.I) Wiesbaden: OH; also Selected Studies, (4 volumes), Leiden: E. J. Brill&lt;/ref&gt; There is no universally applicable uniform definition of mantra because mantras are used in different religions, and within each religion in different schools of philosophy. In some schools of Hinduism for example, suggests Gonda, a mantra is sakti (power) to the devotee in the form of formulated and expressed thought.&lt;ref name=jgtim/&gt; Staal clarifies that mantras are not rituals, they are what is recited or chanted during a ritual.&lt;ref name=staal/&gt;

In Oxford Living Dictionary mantra is defined as a word or sound repeated to aid concentration in meditation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/mantra "Mantra"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107170106/https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/mantra |date=7 November 2016 }}. ''Oxford Living Dictionary.''&lt;/ref&gt; Cambridge Dictionary provides two different definitions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/mantra "Mantra"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629002205/http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/mantra |date=29 June 2017 }}. ''Cambridge Dictionary.''&lt;/ref&gt; The first refers to Hinduism and Buddhism: a word or sound that is believed to have a special spiritual power. The second definition is more general: a word or phrase that is often repeated and expresses a particularly strong belief. For instance, a football team can choose individual words as their own "mantra."

==The literal meaning of mantras==
There is a long history of scholarly disagreement on the meaning of mantras and whether they are instruments of mind, as implied by the etymological origin of the word ''mantra''. One school suggests mantras are mostly meaningless sound constructs, while the other holds them to be mostly meaningful linguistic instruments of mind.&lt;ref name="halper"/&gt; Both schools agree that mantras have melody and a well designed mathematical precision in their construction and that their influence on the reciter and listener is similar to that is observed in people around the world listening to their beloved music that is devoid of words.&lt;ref name=jgtim/&gt;&lt;ref name=staal/&gt;

Staal&lt;ref name=staal/&gt; presents a non-linguistic view of mantras. He suggests that verse mantras are metered and harmonized to mathematical precision (for example, in the ''viharanam'' technique), which resonate, but a lot of them are a hodgepodge of meaningless constructs such as are found in folk music around the world. Staal cautions that there are many mantras that can be translated and do have spiritual meaning and philosophical themes central to Hinduism, but that does not mean all mantras have a literal meaning. He further notes that even when mantras do not have a literal meaning, they do set a tone and ambiance in the ritual as they are recited, and thus have a straightforward and uncontroversial ritualistic meaning.&lt;ref name=staal/&gt; The sounds may lack literal meaning, but they can have an effect. He compares mantras to bird songs, that have the power to communicate, yet do not have a literal meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Frits Staal (1985), Mantras and Bird Songs, Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 105, No. 3, Indological Studies, pages 549–558&lt;/ref&gt; On that ''saman'' category of Hindu mantras, which Staal described as resembling the arias of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s oratorios and other European classics, he notes that these mantras have musical structure, but they almost always are completely different from anything in the syntax of natural languages. Mantras are literally meaningless, yet musically meaningful to Staal.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Alper (1989), Understanding Mantras, {{ISBN|81-208-0746-4}}, State University of New York, page 10-11&lt;/ref&gt; The ''saman'' chant mantras were transmitted, from one Hindu generation to next, verbally for over 1000 years, but never written, and a feat suggests Staal that was made possible by the strict mathematical principles used in constructing the mantras. These ''saman'' chant mantras are also mostly meaningless, cannot be literally translated as Sanskrit or any Indian language, but nevertheless are beautiful in their resonant themes, variations, inversions, and distribution.&lt;ref name=staal/&gt; They draw the devotee in. Staal is not the first person to view Hindu mantras in this manner. The ancient Hindu Vedic ritualist Kautsa was one of the earliest scholars to note that mantras are meaningless; their function is phonetic and syntactic, not semantic.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frits Staal]] (1996), Rituals and Mantras, Rules without meaning, {{ISBN|978-8120814127}}, Motilal Banarsidass, page 112-113&lt;/ref&gt;

Harvey Alper&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Alper (1989), Understanding Mantras, {{ISBN|81-208-0746-4}}, State University of New York, page 10-14&lt;/ref&gt; and others&lt;ref&gt;Andre Padoux, in Understanding Mantras, {{ISBN|81-208-0746-4}}, State University of New York, page 295-317; see also Chapter 3 by Wade Wheelock&lt;/ref&gt; present mantras from the linguistic point view. They admit Staal's observation that many mantras do contain bits and pieces of meaningless jargon, but they question what language or text doesn't. The presence of an abracadabra bit does not necessarily imply the entire work is meaningless. Alper lists numerous mantras that have philosophical themes, moral principles, a call to virtuous life, and even mundane petitions. He suggests that from a set of millions of mantras, the devotee chooses some mantras voluntarily, thus expressing that speaker's intention, and the audience for that mantra is that speaker's chosen spiritual entity. Mantras deploy the language of spiritual expression, they are religious instruments, and that is what matters to the devotee. A mantra creates a feeling in the practicing person. It has an emotive numinous effect, it mesmerizes, it defies expression, and it creates sensations that are by definition private and at the heart of all religions and spiritual phenomena.&lt;ref name=jgtim/&gt;&lt;ref name=bharati/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Alper (1989), Understanding Mantras, {{ISBN|81-208-0746-4}}, State University of New York, page 11-13&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of Hindu mantras===
During the early Vedic period, claims Staal,&lt;ref name=staal/&gt; Vedic poets became fascinated by the inspirational power of poems, metered verses, and music. They referred to them with the root ''dhi-'', which evolved into ''dhyana'' (meditation) of Hinduism, and the language used to start and assist this process manifested as a mantra. By the middle vedic period (1000 BC to 500 BC), mantras were derived from all vedic compositions. They included ''ṛc'' (verses from Rigveda for example), ''sāman'' (musical chants from the Sāmaveda for example), ''yajus'' (a muttered formula from the yajurveda for example), and ''nigada'' (a loudly spoken yajus). During the Hindu Epics period and after, mantras multiplied in many ways and diversified to meet the needs and passions of various schools of Hinduism. Mantras took a center stage in the Tantric school,&lt;ref&gt;[[Frits Staal]] (1996), Rituals and Mantras, Rules without meaning, {{ISBN|978-8120814127}}, Motilal Banarsidass, Chapter 20&lt;/ref&gt; which posited that each mantra (''bijas'') is a deity;&lt;ref name="Teun Goudriaan 1981"/&gt; it is this distinct school of Hinduism and 'each mantra is a deity' reasoning that led to the perception that some Hindus have tens of millions of gods. Mantra came to mean in some Hindu schools as ‘that which protects our mind’ or “Manah traayate iti Mantraaha’.

===Function and structure of Hindu mantras===
One function of mantras is to solemnize and ratify rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Gonda (1963), The Indian Mantra, Oriens, Vol. 16, pages 258–259&lt;/ref&gt; Each mantra, in Vedic rituals, is coupled with an act. According to ''Apastamba Srauta Sutra'', each ritual act is accompanied by one mantra, unless the ''Sutra'' explicitly marks that one act corresponds to several mantras. According to Gonda,&lt;ref&gt;Jan Gonda (1980), Vedic Ritual: The non-Solemn Rites, Amsterdam; see also Jan Gonda (1985), The Ritual Functions and Significance of Grasses in the Religion of the Veda, Amsterdam; Jan Gonda (1977), The Ritual Sutras, Wiesbaden&lt;/ref&gt; and others,&lt;ref&gt;P.V. Kane (1962), History of Dharmasastra, Volume V, part II&lt;/ref&gt; there is a connection and rationale between a Vedic mantra and each Vedic ritual act that accompanies it. In these cases, the function of mantras was to be an instrument of ritual efficacy for the priest, and a tool of instruction for a ritual act for others.

Over time, as the Puranas and Epics were composed, the concepts of worship, virtues and spirituality evolved in Hinduism. Religions such as Jainism and Buddhism branched off, and new schools were founded, each continuing to develop and refine its own mantras. In Hinduism, suggests Alper,&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Alper (1989), Understanding Mantras, {{ISBN|81-208-0746-4}}, State University of New York, see Introduction&lt;/ref&gt; the function of mantras shifted from the quotidian to redemptive. In other words,&lt;ref name=ha78&gt;Harvey Alper (1989), Understanding Mantras, {{ISBN|81-208-0746-4}}, State University of New York, pages 7–8&lt;/ref&gt; in Vedic times, mantras were recited a practical, quotidian goal as intention, such as requesting a deity's help in the discovery of lost cattle, cure of illness, succeeding in competitive sport or journey away from home. The literal translation of Vedic mantras suggests that the function of mantra, in these cases, was to cope with the uncertainties and dilemmas of daily life. In a later period of Hinduism,&lt;ref name=hac10&gt;Harvey Alper (1989), Understanding Mantras, {{ISBN|81-208-0746-4}}, State University of New York, Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt; mantras were recited with a transcendental redemptive goal as intention, such as escape from the cycle of life and rebirth, forgiveness for bad karma, and experiencing a spiritual connection with the god. The function of mantras, in these cases, was to cope with the human condition as a whole. According to Alper,&lt;ref name="halper"/&gt; redemptive spiritual mantras opened the door for mantras where every part need not have a literal meaning, but together their resonance and musical quality assisted the transcendental spiritual process. Overall, explains Alper, using Śivasūtra mantras as an example, Hindu mantras have philosophical themes and are metaphorical with social dimension and meaning; in other words, they are a spiritual language and instrument of thought.&lt;ref name=hac10/&gt;

According to Staal,&lt;ref name=staal/&gt; Hindu mantras may be spoken aloud, ''anirukta'' (not enunciated), ''upamsu'' (inaudible), or ''manasa'' (not spoken, but recited in the mind). In ritual use, mantras are often silent instruments of meditation.

===Examples===
The most basic mantra is ''Om'', which in Hinduism is known as the "pranava mantra," the source of all mantras. The [[Hindu philosophy]] behind this is the premise that before existence and beyond existence is only One reality, Brahma, and the first manifestation of Brahma expressed as Om. For this reason, Om is considered as a foundational idea and reminder, and thus is prefixed and suffixed to all Hindu [[prayer]]s. While some mantras may invoke individual gods or principles, fundamental mantras, like the '[[Shanti Mantra]], the '[[Gayatri Mantra]]' and others all ultimately focus on the One reality.

'''Tantric school'''

In the Tantric school the universe is sound.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, L. (2015). Flotation: A Guide for Sensory Deprivation, Relaxation, &amp; Isolation Tanks. {{ISBN|1329173759}}, {{ISBN|978-1329173750}}, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; The supreme (para) brings forth existence through the Word (Shabda). Creation consists of vibrations at various frequencies and amplitudes giving rise to the phenomena of the world.

Buhnemann notes that deity mantras are an essential part of Tantric compendia. The tantric mantras vary in their structure and length. Mala mantras are those mantras which have an enormous number of syllables. In contrast, bija mantras are one-syllabled, typically ending in [[anusvara]] (a simple nasal sound).  These are derived from the name of a deity; for example, [[Durga]] yields ''dum'' and [[Ganesha]] yields ''gam''. Bija mantras are prefixed and appended to other mantras, thereby creating complex mantras. In the tantric school, these mantras are believed to have supernatural powers, and they are transmitted by a preceptor to a disciple in an initiation ritual.&lt;ref&gt;Gudrun Bühnemann, Selecting and perfecting mantras in Hindu tantrism, Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies / Volume 54 / Issue 02 / June 1991, pages 292–306&lt;/ref&gt; Tantric mantras found a significant audience and adaptations in medieval India, Hindu Southeast Asia and numerous Asian countries with Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;David Gordon White (2000), Tantra in Practice, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691057798}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Majumdar and other scholars&lt;ref name=jgtim/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Herbert]], Spiritualite hindoue, Paris 1947, {{ISBN|978-2226032980}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest mantras are central to the Tantric school, with numerous functions. From initiating and emancipating a tantric devotee to worshiping manifested forms of the divine. From enabling heightened sexual energy in the male and the female to acquiring supernormal psychological and spiritual power. From preventing evil influences to exorcizing demons, and many others.&lt;ref&gt;Bhattāchārya, Majumdar and Majumdar, Principles of Tantra, {{ISBN|978-8185988146}}, see Introduction by Barada Kanta Majumdar&lt;/ref&gt; These claimed functions and other aspects of the tantric mantra are a subject of controversy among scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks (1990), The Secret of the Three Cities: An Introduction to Hindu Sakta Tantrism, University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tantra usage  is not unique to Hinduism: it is also found in Buddhism both inside and outside India.&lt;ref&gt;David Gordon White (Editor) (2001), Tantra in practice (Vol. 8), Motilal Banarsidass, Princeton Readings in Religions, {{ISBN|978-8120817784}}, Chapters 21 and 31&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mantra japa'''
{{Main|Japa}}
Mantra ''japa'' is a practice of repetitively uttering the same mantra for an auspicious number of times, the most popular being [[108 (number)|108]], and sometimes just 5, 10, 28 or 1008.&lt;ref name=jgtim/&gt;&lt;ref name=mmw&gt;Monier Monier-Williams (1893), Indian Wisdom, Luzac &amp; Co., London, page 245-246, see text and footnote&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Dictionary of Hinduism, Margaret and James Stutley (Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers) 2002, p.126&lt;/ref&gt; ''Japa'' is found in personal prayer or meditative efforts of some Hindus, as well during formal [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]] (group prayers).  Japa is assisted by [[Japa mala|malas]] (bead necklaces) containing 108 beads and a head bead (sometimes referred to as the '[[Mount Meru (Mythology)|meru]]', or '[[guru]]' bead); the devotee using his/her fingers to count each bead as he/she repeats the chosen mantra. Having reached 108 repetitions, if he/she wishes to continue another cycle of mantras, the devotee turns the mala around without crossing the head bead and repeats the cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Radha |first=Swami Sivananda |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BFfxHiQb3HAC |title=Mantras: Words of Power |publisher=Timeless Books |location=Canada |isbn=978-1-932018-10-3 |page=54 |quote=Mantra Yoga (chanting), Japa Yoga: Vaikhari Japa (speaking), Upamsu Japa (whispering or humming), Manasika Japa (mental repetition), [[RamaKoti|Likhita Japa]] (writing) |date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japa-yajna is claimed to be most effective if the mantra is repeated silently in mind (manasah).&lt;ref name=mmw/&gt;

According to this school, any [[shloka]] from holy Hindu texts like the Vedas, [[Upanishads]], [[Bhagavad Gita]], [[Yoga Sutra]], even the [[Mahabharata]], [[Ramayana]], [[Durga saptashati]] or [[Chandi]] is a mantra, thus can be part of the ''japa'', repeated to achieve a numinous effect.&lt;ref&gt;Some very common mantras, called Nama japa, are: "Om Namah ''(name of deity)''"; for example, ''[[Om Namah Shivaya]]'' or ''Om Namo Bhagavate Rudraya Namah'' (Om and salutations to Lord Shiva); ''Om Namo [[Narayana]]ya'' or ''Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevãya'' (Om and salutations to Lord Vishnu);  ''Om Shri Ganeshaya Namah'' (Om and salutations to Shri [[Ganesha]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meditation and Mantras, Swami Vishnu-Devananda (Motilal Banarsidass Publishers) 1981, p.66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Dictionary of Hinduism, p.271; Some of the major books which are used as reference for Mantra Shaastra are: Parasurama Kalpa Sutra; Shaarada Tilakam; Lakshmi Tantra; Prapanchasara&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Dharmasāstra'' claims [[Gayatri Mantra|Gāyatri mantra]] derived from Rig Veda verse 3.62.10, and the [[Purusha sukta|Purușasūkta]] mantra from Rig Veda verse 10.90 are most auspicious mantras for ''japa'' at sunrise and sunset; it is claimed to purify the mind and spirit.&lt;ref name=jgtim/&gt;

There are numerous other important mantras.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see: Om Namo Narayanaya'' called as Narayana Ashtakshara Mantra; [[Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya]] Dvadasakshari mantra; Om Sri Ram Jai Ram Jai Jai Ram; [[Hare Krishna (mantra)|Hare Krishna Maha Mantra]]; [[Om Namah Shivaya]] Siva Panchakshara mantra; [[Surya Namaskara|Sūrya namaskāra]]; [[Soham (Sanskrit)|So'ham]]'' (''I am He'' or ''I am That'') (See Meditation and Mantras, p.80); [[Ram Nam]] Rama Mantra; [[Aham Brahma Asmi]]'' (''I Am Brahman''); [[Sri Vidya]] Mantras'' – There are 3 Sri Vidya Mantras – [[Five Strengths|Bala]] Tripurasundari Mantra, Panchadasi Mantra, Shodasi Mantra; [[Dakshinamoorthy]] Mantra; Chandi Navakshari Mantra; Santhana GopalaKrishna Mantra; Shoolini Durga Mantra; Maha Sudarshana Mantra; Maha Ganapathi Mantra; Svayamvara Kala Parvati Mantra&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shiva sutra mantras'''

Apart from [[Shiva Sutras]], which originated from Shiva's [[tandava]] dance, the [[Shiva Sutras of Vasugupta]]&lt;ref&gt;Siva Sutras: The Yoga of Supreme Identity, by Vasugupta, translation, Motilal Banarsidass, Delhi, 1979.  {{cite web |url=http://bibleoteca.narod.ru/tantra/Jaideva_Singh_Siva_Sutras.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=22 March 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150421033850/http://bibleoteca.narod.ru/tantra/Jaideva_Singh_Siva_Sutras.pdf |archivedate=21 April 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt; are a collection of seventy-seven aphorisms that form the foundation of the tradition of spiritual mysticism known as [[Kashmir Shaivism]]. They are attributed to the sage [[Vasugupta]] of the 9th century C.E. ''Sambhavopaya'' (1-1 to 1–22), ''Saktopaya'' (2-1 to 2–10) and ''Anavopaya'' (3-1 to 3–45) are the main sub-divisions, three means of achieving God consciousness, of which the main technique of ''Saktopaya'' is a mantra. But "mantra" in this context does not mean incantation or muttering of some sacred formula. The word "mantra" is used here in its etymological signification.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, G.L. (1995). ''Sonic Theology: Hinduism and Sacred Sound.'' Motilal Banarsidass Publ. p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; That which saves one by pondering over the light of Supreme I-consciousness is a mantra. The divine Supreme I-consciousness is the dynamo of all the mantras. ''Deha'' or body has been compared to wood, "mantra" has been compared to ''arani''—a piece of wood used for kindling fire by friction; ''prana'' has been compared to fire. ''Sikha'' or flame has been compared to ''atma'' (Self); ''ambara'' or sky has been compared to Shiva. When prana is kindled by means of mantra used as arani, fire in the form of ''udana'' arises in ''susumna'', and then just as flame arises out of kindled fire and gets dissolved in the sky, so also ''atma'' (Self) like a flame having burnt down the fuel of the body, gets absorbed in Shiva.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, J.

'''Transcendental Meditation'''
{{main|Transcendental Meditation}}

The [[Transcendental Meditation technique|Transcendental Meditation]] technique, also known as 'TM', uses mantras that are assigned to the practitioner to be used as thought sound only, not chanted,  without connection to any meaning or idea.&lt;ref&gt;Shear Jonathon (Editor), ''The Experience of Meditation: Experts Introduce the Major Traditions'',pg.28.Paragon House. St Paul, MN.,2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The spiritual exercises of [[Surat Shabd Yoga|Surat Shabda Yoga]] include [[Simran (Sanskrit word)|simran]] (repetition, particularly silent repetition of a mantra given at initiation), dhyan (concentration, viewing, or contemplation, particularly on the Inner Master), and [[bhajan]] (listening to the inner sounds of the Shabda or the Shabda Master).

Repetition of a "mantram" (i.e., mantra) or holy name is Point 2 in the eight-point [[Passage Meditation]] program taught by [[Eknath Easwaran]], who recommended using a mantram drawn from a faith tradition, east or west. The mantram is to be used frequently throughout the day, at opportune moments.&lt;ref&gt;In Hinduism, frequent repetition at opportune moments is a common type of [[japa]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mantram Handbook|This method of mantram repetition]], and the larger program, was developed for use in any major faith tradition, or outside all traditions.&lt;ref name=mhand&gt;[[Eknath Easwaran]] (2008).

==Jainism==
The concept of mantras in [[Jainism]] is not focused on material aspects, rather mainly deals with seeking forgiveness, praising [[Arihant (Jainism)|Arihant]]s, or deities like Nakoda, Padmavati, Manibhadra, [[Saraswati]], [[Lakshmi]], and others.{{cn|date=April 2015}} Yet some mantras are claimed to enhance intellect, prosperity, wealth or fame. There are many mantras in [[Jainism]]; most of them are in [[Sanskrit]] or [[Prakrit]], but in the last few centuries, some have been composed in [[Hindi]] or [[Gujarati language|Gujrati]] languages. Mantras, couplets, are either chanted or sung, either aloud or by merely moving lips or in silence by thought.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jaina.org jaina.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160516203809/http://www.jaina.org/ |date=16 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Navkar Mantra===
Some examples of Jain mantras are [[Bhaktamara Stotra]], [[Uvasagharam Stotra]], etc. But the greatest is said to be the Namokar or [[Navkar Mantra]].{{cn|date=April 2015}}

The Navkar Mantra (literally, "Nine Line Mantra") is a central mantra in [[Jainism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:Category:Jain mantras|Jain mantras]]&lt;/ref&gt;
The initial 5 lines consist of salutations to various sanctified souls, and the latter 4 lines are explanatory in nature, highlighting the benefits and greatness of this mantra.

&lt;blockquote&gt;

===Micchami Dukkadam===
In [[Jainism]], [[forgiveness]] is one of the main virtues to be cultivated. ''Kṣamāpanā'' or supreme forgiveness forms part of one of the ten characteristics of ''[[Dharma (Jainism)|dharma]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Varni, Jinendra; Ed. Prof. Sagarmal Jain, Translated Justice T.K. Tukol and Dr. K.K. Dixit (1993). Samaṇ Suttaṁ. New Delhi: Bhagwan Mahavir memorial Samiti. verse 84&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the ''[[pratikramana]]'' prayer, Jains repeatedly seek forgiveness from various creatures—even from ''ekindriyas'' or single sensed beings like plants and microorganisms that they may have harmed while eating and doing routine activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Jaini | first =Padmanabh | title =Collected Papers on Jaina Studies | publisher =Motilal Banarsidass Publ. | year =2000 | location =Delhi | isbn =81-208-1691-9 }} p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; Forgiveness is asked by uttering the phrase, ''Micchāmi dukkaḍaṃ.'' ''Micchāmi dukkaḍaṃ'' is a Prakrit phrase literally meaning "may all the evil that has been done be fruitless."&lt;ref&gt;Chapple. C.K. (2006) ''Jainism and Ecology: Nonviolence in the Web of Life'' Delhi:Motilal Banarasidas Publ. {{ISBN|978-81-208-2045-6}} p.46&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forgiveness===
In their daily prayers and [[samayika]], Jains recite the following ''Iryavahi sutra'' in Prakrit, seeking forgiveness from literally all creatures while involved in routine activities:&lt;ref&gt;Translated from Prakrit by Nagin J. shah and Madhu Sen (1993) ''Concept of Pratikramana'' Ahmedabad: Gujarat Vidyapith pp.25–26&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
May you, O Revered One, voluntarily permit me. I would like to confess my sinful acts committed while walking. I honour your permission. I desire to absolve myself of the sinful acts by confessing them. I seek forgiveness from all those living beings which I may have tortured while walking, coming and going, treading on a living organism, seeds, green grass, dew drops, ant hills, moss, live water, live earth, spider web and others. I seek forgiveness from all these living beings, be they one sensed, two sensed, three sensed, four sensed or five sensed, which I may have kicked, covered with dust, rubbed with earth, collided with other, turned upside down, tormented, frightened, shifted from one place to another or killed and deprived them of their lives. (By confessing) may I be absolved of all these sins.

===Theravada===
According to [[Jack Kornfield]], 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The use of mantra or the repetition of certain phrases in Pali is a highly common form of meditation in the Theravada tradition. Simple mantras use repetition of the Buddha’s name, “Buddho,” [as “Buddho” is actually a title rather than a name] or use the “Dhamma,” or the “Sangha,” the community, as mantra words. Other used mantras are directed toward developing loving kindness. Some mantras direct attention to the process of change by repeating the Pali phrase that means “everything changes,” while other mantras are used to develop equanimity with phrases that would be translated, “let go.”

Very often mantra practice is combined with breathing meditation so that one recites a mantra simultaneously with in-breath and out-breath to help develop tranquility and concentration. Mantra meditation is especially popular among the lay people. Like other basic concentration exercises, it can be used simply to the mind, or it can be the basis for an insight practice where the mantra becomes the focus of observation of how life unfolds, or an aid in surrendering and letting go."&lt;ref&gt;Kornfield, j. Modern Buddhist masters, pg 311.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The "Buddho" mantra is widespread in the [[Thai Forest Tradition]] and was taught by [[Ajahn Chah]] and his students.&lt;ref&gt;Ajahn Chah, Clarity of Insight, {{cite web |url=http://www.ajahnchah.org/book/Clarity_Insight1.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=21 May 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602022820/http://www.ajahnchah.org/book/Clarity_Insight1.php |archivedate=2 June 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another popular mantra in [[Buddhism in Thailand|Thai Buddhism]] is ''Samma-Araham'', referring to the Buddha who has 'perfectly' (''samma'') attained 'perfection in the Buddhist sense' (''[[Arhat|araham]]''), used in [[Dhammakaya meditation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/pali|title=The Pali-English dictionary|date=1993|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=8120811445|edition=1.

In the [[Tantric Theravada]] tradition of Southeast Asia, mantras are central to their method of meditation. Popular mantras in this tradition include ''Namo Buddhaya'' ("Homage to the Buddha") and ''Araham'' ("Worthy One").

===Non-esoteric Buddhism===
In Buddhism in China and Vietnam, ten small mantras&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amtfamtf.net/nfgy/sxz.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070324051507/http://www.amtfamtf.net/nfgy/sxz.htm |archivedate=24 March 2007 |title=Pinyin of ten mantras |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=24 March 2007 |accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; were finalized by the monk Yulin (玉琳國師), a teacher of the [[Shunzhi Emperor]] for monks, nuns, and laity to chant in the morning.

Along with the ten mantras, the [[Nīlakantha dhāranī|Great Compassion Mantra]], the [[Shurangama Mantra]] of the [[Shurangama Sutra|Shurangama]], [[Heart Sutra]] and [[Nianfo|various forms of nianfo]] are also chanted. The Shurangama Mantra may be the longest mantra. There are [[Thai people|Thai]] Buddhist [[amulet]] [[Katha_(storytelling_format)|katha]]: that is, mantras to be recited while holding an amulet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mir.com.my/leofoo/Thai-amulets/Chris_Tam_katha_libary/index.htm |title=A mini reference archive library of compiled Buddhist Katha/Katta |publisher=Mir.com.my |date= |accessdate=17 July 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626202226/http://www.mir.com.my/leofoo/Thai-amulets/Chris_Tam_katha_libary/index.htm |archivedate=26 June 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shingon Buddhism===
[[Kūkai]] (774–835), a noted Buddhist monk, advanced a general theory of [[language]] based on his analysis of two forms of Buddhist [[ritual]] language: ''[[dharani]]'' (dhāra.nī) and ''mantra''. Mantra is restricted to [[esoteric]] Buddhist practice whereas dharani is found in both esoteric and [[exoteric]] [[ritual]]. Dharanis for instance are found in the [[Heart Sutra]]. The term "[[shingon]]" (lit. ''true word'') is the Japanese pronunciation of the Chinese term for a mantra, ''zhēnyán''.

The word ''dharani'' derives from a Sanskrit root ''dh.r'' which means to hold or maintain. [[Ryuichi Abe]] suggests that it is generally understood as a [[mnemonic device]] which encapsulates the meaning of a section or chapter of a [[sutra]]. Dharanis are also considered to protect the one who chants them from malign influences and calamities.

The term ''mantra'' is traditionally said to be derived from two roots: ''man'', to [[Thought|think]]; and the action-oriented &lt;!--this doesn't make sense without more context: (k.rt)--&gt; suffix ''-tra''. Thus a mantra can be considered to be a [[Linguistics|linguistic]] device for deepening one's thought or in the Buddhist context for developing the [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightened]] [[mind]]. They have also been used as [[magic spell]]s for purposes such as attaining [[wealth]] and long life and eliminating enemies. In daily living, many thought the pronunciation of the mantra was not important to take its effect and the expected effect, may not happen because of fixed karma (定業), or because there appears a better way to solve the situation.

The distinction between dharani and mantra is hard to make. We can say that all mantras are dharanis but that not all dharanis are mantras. Mantras do tend to be shorter. Both tend to contain some unintelligible [[Phonics|phonic]] fragments such as Om, or Hu.m, which is perhaps why some people consider them to be essentially meaningless. Kūkai made mantra a special class of dharani which showed that every [[syllable]] of a dharani was a manifestation of the true nature of [[reality]]&amp;nbsp;– in Buddhist terms that all sound is a manifestation of [[shunyata]] or emptiness of self-nature. Thus rather than being devoid of meaning, Kūkai suggests that dharanis are in fact saturated with meaning&amp;nbsp;– every syllable is symbolic on multiple levels.

One of Kūkai's distinctive contributions was to take this symbolic association even further by saying that there is no essential difference between the syllables of mantras and [[sacred text]]s, and those of ordinary language. If one understood the workings of mantra, then any sounds could be a representative of ultimate reality. This emphasis on sounds was one of the drivers for Kūkai's championing of the phonetic writing system, the [[kana]], which was adopted in Japan around the time of Kūkai. He is generally credited with the invention of the kana, but there is apparently some doubt about this story amongst [[scholar]]s.

This mantra-based theory of language had a powerful effect on Japanese thought and society which up until Kūkai's time had been dominated by imported [[China|Chinese]] culture of thought, particularly in the form of the Classical Chinese language which was used in the court and amongst the literati, and [[Confucianism]] which was the dominant political [[ideology]]. In particular, Kūkai was able to use this new theory of [[language]] to create links between indigenous Japanese culture and Buddhism. For instance, he made a link between the Buddha Mahavairocana and the [[Shinto]] sun Goddess [[Amaterasu]]. Since the emperors were thought to be descended form Amaterasu, Kūkai had found a powerful connection here that linked the emperors with the Buddha, and also in finding a way to integrate [[Shinto]] with Buddhism, something that had not happened with Confucianism. Buddhism then became essentially an indigenous religion in a way that Confucianism had not. And it was through language and mantra that this connection was made. Kūkai helped to elucidate what mantra is in a way that had not been done before: he addresses the fundamental questions of what a text is, how signs function, and above all, what language is. In this, he covers some of the same ground as modern day [[Structuralism|Structuralists]] and others scholars of language, although he comes to very different conclusions.

In this system of thought, all sounds are said to originate from "a"&amp;nbsp;– which is the short ''a'' sound in f&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;ther. For esoteric Buddhism "a" has a special function because it is associated with Shunyata or the idea that no thing exists in its own right, but is contingent upon causes and conditions. (See [[Dependent origination]]) In Sanskrit "a" is a prefix which changes the meaning of a word into its opposite, so "vidya" is understanding, and "avidya" is ignorance (the same arrangement is also found in many [[Greek language|Greek]] words, like e.g. "atheism" vs. "theism" and "apathy" vs. "pathos"). The letter a is both visualised in the [[Siddhaṃ script|Siddham]] script and pronounced in rituals and [[meditation]] practices. In the [[Mahavairocana Sutra]] which is central to [[Shingon Buddhism]] it says: Thanks to the original vows of the Buddhas and [[Bodhisattva]]s, a [[Miracle|miraculous]] force resides in the mantras, so that by pronouncing them one acquires merit without limits". [in Conze, p.&amp;nbsp;183]

A mantra is [[Kuji-kiri]] in [[Shugendo]]. The word [[Shingon]] means mantra.&lt;ref name="Law1995p173"/&gt; According to Alex Wayman and Ryujun Tajima, Shingon means "true speech", has the sense of "an exact mantra which reveals the truth of the dharmas", and is the path of mantras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alex Wayman|author2=Ryujun Tajima|title=The Enlightenment of Vairocana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rlhQwTAYR-oC|year=1992|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|isbn=978-81-208-0640-5|pages=225, 254, 293–294}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of writing mantras, and copying texts as a spiritual practice, became very refined in Japan, and some of these are written in the Japanese script and [[Siddhaṃ script|Siddham]] script of Sanskrit, recited in either language. There are thirteen mantras used in Shingon-Buddhism, each dedicated to a major deity. The mantra for each deity name in Japanese, its equivalent name in Sanskrit, a transliteration of mantra, and the Japanese version in Shingon tradition are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shingon.org/ritual/daily.html The Koyasan Shingon-shu Lay Practitioner's Daily Service] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060502064538/http://www.shingon.org/ritual/daily.html |date=2 May 2006 }}, Shingon Buddhist International Institute (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indo-Tibetan Buddhism===
[[Mantrayana]] (Sanskrit), which may be translated as "way of the mantra", was the original self-identifying name of those that have come to be determined '[[Nyingmapa]]'.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} The Nyingmapa which may be rendered as "those of the ancient way", a name constructed due to the genesis of the [[Sarma (Tibetan Buddhism)|Sarma]] "fresh", "new" traditions. Mantrayana has developed into a synonym of Vajrayana.

Noted translator of Buddhist texts [[Edward Conze]] (1904–1979) distinguishes three periods in the Buddhist use of mantra.

Initially, according to Conze, like their fellow Indians, Buddhists used mantra as protective spells to ward off malign influences. Despite a [[Vinaya]] rule which forbids monks engaging in the Brahminical practice of chanting mantras for material gain, there is a number of protective mantras for a group of ascetic monks. However, even at this early stage, there is perhaps something more than [[animism|animistic magic]] at work. Particularly in the case of the [[Ratana Sutta]] the efficacy of the verses seems to be related to the concept of "[[truth]]". Each verse of the sutta ends with "by the virtue of this truth may there be happiness".

Conze notes that later mantras were used more to guard the spiritual life of the chanter, and sections on mantras began to be included in some [[Mahayana]] sutras such as the [[White Lotus Sutra]], and the [[Lankavatara Sutra]]. The scope of protection also changed in this time. In the [[Sutra of Golden Light]] the [[Four Heavenly Kings|Four Great Kings]] promise to exercise sovereignty over the different classes of demigods, to protect the whole of Jambudvipa (the Indian subcontinent), to protect monks who proclaim the sutra, and to protect kings who patronise the monks who proclaim the sutra. The apotheosis of this type of approach is the [[Nichiren]] school of Buddhism that was founded in the 13th century Japan, and which distilled many previously complex Buddhist practices down to the [[veneration]] of the [[Lotus Sutra]] through a recitation of the daimoku: "[[Nam myoho renge kyo]]" which translates as "Homage to the Lotus Sutra".

The third period began, according to Conze, in about the 7th century, to take center stage and become a vehicle for salvation in their own right. [[Tantra]] started to gain momentum in the 6th and 7th century, with specifically Buddhist forms appearing as early as 300CE. ''Mantrayana'' was an early name for what is now more commonly known as ''[[Vajrayana]]'', which gives us a hint as to the place of mantra in Indo-Tibetan Buddhism. The aim of Vajrayana practice is to give the practitioner a direct experience of reality, of things as they really are. Mantras function as [[symbol]]s of that reality, and different mantras are different aspects of that reality&amp;nbsp;– for example wisdom or compassion. Mantras are often associated with a particular deity, one famous exception being the [[Heart Sutra#Mantra|Prajnaparamita mantra]] associated with the [[Heart Sutra]]. One of the key Vajrayana strategies for bringing about a direct experience of reality is to engage the entire psycho-physical organism in the practices. In one Buddhist analysis, the person consists of 'body, speech and mind' (refer: [[Three Vajra]]). So a typical sadhana or [[meditation]] practice might include [[mudra]]s, or symbolic [[hand gesture]]s; the recitations of mantras; as well as the visualisation of [[Heaven|celestial]] beings and visualising the letters of the mantra which is being recited. Clearly here mantra is associated with speech. The meditator may visualise the letters in front of themselves, or within their body. They may be pronounced out loud, or internally in mind only.

====Om mani padme hum====

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 135-S-15-22-23, Tibetexpedition, Berghang mit tibetischer Schrift.jpg|thumb|[[Om mani padme hum]] on the [[Yarlung Valley|Gangpori]] (photo [[1938–1939 German expedition to Tibet]].]]

Probably the most famous mantra of Buddhism is [[Om mani padme hum]], the six syllable mantra of the [[Bodhisattva]] of compassion [[Avalokiteśvara]] (Tibetan: ''[[Chenrezig]]'', Chinese: ''[[Guanyin]]''). This mantra is particularly associated with the four-armed Shadakshari form of Avalokiteśvara. The [[Dalai Lama]] is said to be an incarnation of Avalokiteshvara, and so the mantra is especially revered by his devotees.

The book ''Foundations of Tibetan Mysticism'' by [[Lama Anagarika Govinda]], gives a classic example of how such a mantra can contain many levels of symbolic meaning.

[[Donald S. Lopez, Jr.|Donald Lopez]] gives a good discussion of this mantra and its various interpretations in his book ''Prisoners of Shangri-LA: Tibetan Buddhism and the West''. Lopez is an authoritative writer and challenges the stereotypical analysis of the mantra as meaning "The Jewel in the Lotus", an interpretation that is not supported by either a linguistic analysis, nor by Tibetan tradition, and is symptomatic of the Western [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] approach to the 'exotic' East. He suggests that Manipadma is actually the name of a bodhisattva, a form of Avalokiteshvara who has many other names in any case including Padmapani or ''lotus flower in hand''. The Brahminical insistence on the absolutely correct pronunciation of Sanskrit broke down as Buddhism was exported to other countries where the inhabitants found it impossible to reproduce the sounds. So in Tibet, for instance, where this mantra is on the lips of many Tibetans all their waking hours, the mantra is pronounced ''Om mani pema hung''.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

====Some other mantras in Tibetan Buddhism====
The following list of mantras is from ''[[Kailash: A Journal of Himalayan Studies]]'', Volume 1, Number 2, 1973. (pp.&amp;nbsp;168–169) (augmented by other contributors). It also includes renderings of ''Om mani padme hum''. The mantras used in Tibetan Buddhist practice are in [[Sanskrit]], to preserve the original mantras. Visualizations and other practices are usually done in the [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan language]].

*''Om vagishvara hum'' This is the mantra of the Mahabodhisattva [[Manjusri]], Tibetan: Jampelyang ([[Wylie transliteration|Wylie]] "'jam dpal dbyangs")... The Buddha in his wisdom aspect.

*''Om ah hum vajra guru padma siddhi hum'' The mantra of the Vajraguru [[Padmasambhava|Guru Padma Sambhava]] who established [[Mahayana]] Buddhism and Tantra in Tibet.

[[File:Om Tare Tutare Ture Soha.vorb.oga|thumb|right|Om Tare Tutare Ture Soha.]]
*''Om tare tuttare ture svaha'', mantra of Green Arya Tara—[[Jetsun Dolma]] or [[Tara (Buddhist)|Tara]], the Mother of the Buddhas: om represents Tara's sacred body, speech, and mind. Tare means liberating from all discontent. Tutare means liberating from the eight fears, the external dangers, but mainly from the internal dangers, the delusions. Ture means liberating from duality; it shows the "true" cessation of confusion. Soha means "may the meaning of the mantra take root in my mind."

According to Tibetan Buddhism, this mantra (Om tare tutare ture soha) can not only eliminate disease, troubles, disasters, and karma, but will also bring believers blessings, longer life, and even the wisdom to transcend one's circle of reincarnation.

The mantra in [[Chinese Buddhist canon]] are collected by [[Qianlong Emperor]] into a book. Kuang-Ming Lin (林光明) amended it.

==Bahá’í Faith==

Bahá’ís recite the mantra "Alláh-u-Abha" 95 times a day. Many use beads.

==Sikhism==
In the [[Sikh]] religion, a ''mantar'' or ''mantra'' is a [[Shabad (hymn)|Shabad]] (Word or [[hymn]]) from the [[Adi Granth]] to concentrate the mind on God. Through repetition of the mantra, and listening to one's own voice, thoughts are reduced and the mind rises above materialism to tune into the voice of God. 

Mantras in Sikhism are fundamentally different from the secret mantras used in other religions.&lt;ref name="Tālib 1992"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advancedcentrepunjabi.org/eos/MUL%20MANTRA.html|title=MŪL MANTRA|last=Tālib|first=Gurbachan Siṅgh|year=1992|work=Encyclopaedia of Sikhism|publisher=Punjabi University|accessdate=19 September 2010|location=Patiala}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike in other religions, Sikh mantras are open for anyone to use. They are used openly and are not taught in secret sessions but are used in front of assemblies of Sikhs.&lt;ref name="Tālib 1992"/&gt;

The [[Mool Mantar]], the first composition of [[Guru Nanak]], is the second most widely known Sikh mantra.

The most widely known mantra in the Sikh faith is "Wahe Guru." According to the Sikh poet Bhai Gurdas, the word "Wahe Guru" is the Gurmantra, or the mantra given by the Guru, and eliminates ego. &lt;ref name="Bhai Gurdas"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sikhitothemax.org/shabad?id=40293&amp;q=vghjh&amp;type=1&amp;source=all&amp;highlight=202491|title=GUR MANTRA|work=SikhiTotheMax|last=Gurdas|first=Bhai|accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to the 10th Sikh Master, Guru Gobind Singh, the "Wahe Guru" mantra was given by God to the Order of the Khalsa, and reforms the apostate into the purified.

==Taoism==
There are mantras in [[Taoism]], such as the words in Dafan yinyu wuliang yin (大梵隱語無量音) and the Tibetan Buddhism mantra ''[[om]]'' (唵). There are mantras in [[Cheondoism]], [[Daesun Jinrihoe]], [[Jeung San Do]] and [[Onmyōdō]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2s.biglobe.ne.jp/~Taiju/970_kuchizusami.htm |title=口遊 |publisher=S.biglobe.ne.jp |date= |accessdate=18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mario Augusto Bunge''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ʌ|ŋ|ɡ|i}}; {{IPA-es|ˈbuŋxe|lang}}; born September 21, 1919) is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[philosophy|philosopher]], [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] and [[physics|physicist]] who is mainly active in [[Canada]].

==Biography==

=== Early years ===
Bunge was born on September 21, 1919 in [[Buenos Aires]] ([[Argentina]]). His mother, Marie Müser, was a German nurse who left Germany just before the beginning of [[World War I]]. His father, Augusto Bunge, also of some German descent, was an Argentinian physician and socialist legislator. Mario, who was the couple's only child, was raised without any religious education, and enjoyed a happy and stimulating childhood in the outskirts of Buenos Aires.&lt;ref&gt;Memorias. Entre dos mundos. Barcelona: Gedisa&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wife and children ===
Bunge has four children: Carlos F. and Mario A. J. (with ex-wife Julia), and Eric R. and Silvia A., with his present wife, the Argentinian mathematician [[Marta Cavallo]].
Mario and Marta live in [[Montreal, Canada|Montreal]].

=== Studies and career ===
Bunge began his studies at the [[National University of La Plata]], graduating with a [[Ph.D.]] in physico-mathematical sciences in 1952. He was professor of [[theoretical physics]] and philosophy, 1956&amp;ndash;1966, first at La Plata then at [[University of Buenos Aires]]. He was, until his recent retirement at age 90, the Frothingham Professor of Logic and Metaphysics at [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal, Canada|Montreal]], where he had been since 1966.&lt;ref name="MG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GF"/&gt;

Bunge's students include Roger Angel, David Blitz, Mike Dillinger, Andrés Kálnay, Jean-Pierre Marquis, Dan A. Seni, Héctor Vucetich, and Miguel A. Quintanilla.

==Work==
Bunge is a prolific intellectual, having written more than 400 papers and 80 books, notably his monumental ''Treatise on Basic Philosophy'' in 8 volumes (1974–1989), a comprehensive and rigorous study of those philosophical aspects Bunge takes to be the core of modern philosophy: [[semantics]], [[ontology]], [[epistemology]], [[philosophy of science]] and [[ethics]].&lt;ref name="GF"/&gt; Here, Bunge develops a comprehensive [[scientific]] outlook which he then applies to the various natural and social sciences.

His thinking embodies global [[systemics|systemism]], [[emergentism]], [[rationalism]], [[scientific realism]], [[materialism]] and [[consequentialism]]. Bunge has repeatedly and explicitly denied being a [[logical positivism|logical positivist]], and has written on [[metaphysics]]. In the [[politics|political]] arena, Bunge has defined himself as a "[[left-wing politics|left-wing]] [[liberalism|liberal]]" and [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]], in the tradition of [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[José Ingenieros]]. He is also a supporter of the [[Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]], an organisation which advocates for democratic reform in the United Nations, and the creation of a more accountable international political system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.unpacampaign.org/supporters/overview/?mapcountry=allpro&amp;mapgroup=pro|title=Overview: Professors|website=Campaign for a UN Parliamentary Assembly|date=|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popularly, he is known for his remarks considering [[psychoanalysis]] as an example of [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realclearscience.com/2010/10/06/is_psychoanalysis_science_or_pseudoscience_237794.html RealClearScience - "Is Psychoanalysis Science or Pseudoscience?"] Retrieved 16 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He has also freely criticized the ideas of well known scientists and philosophers such as [[Karl Popper]], [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Stephen Jay Gould]], and [[Daniel Dennett]].{{R|"Alcock"}}

In his review of ''Between Two Worlds: Memoirs of a Philosopher-Scientist'', [[James Alcock]] sees in Bunge "a man of exceedingly high confidence who has lived his life guided by strong principles about truth, science, and justice" and one who is "[impatient] with muddy thinking".{{R|"Alcock"}}

== Awards ==
Mario Bunge has been distinguished with twenty one honorary doctorates and four honorary professorships by universities from both the Americas and Europe. Bunge is a fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (1984–) and of the [[Royal Society of Canada]] (1992–). In 1982 he was awarded the ''Premio Príncipe de Asturias'' ([[Prince of Asturias Award]]), in 2009 the [[Guggenheim Fellowship]],&lt;ref name="GF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UO"/&gt; and in 2014 the [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]] Award in Complexity Thinking.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bcsss.org/research/grants-and-prizes/ludwig-von-bertalanffy-award-in-complexity-thinking/&lt;/ref&gt;

It encompasses a quadrivium which he considers "the nucleus of contemporary philosophy", namely, [[semantics]] (theories of meaning and truth), [[ontology]] (general theories of the world), [[epistemology]] (theories of knowledge), and [[ethics]] (theories of value and right action). For approximately two decades, Bunge engaged in writing his magnum opus in order to investigate and synthesize contemporary philosophy in a single grand system that is compatible with the advancement of modern human knowledge both scientifically and philosophically.

'''Mythopoeic thought''' is a hypothetical stage of human thought preceding modern thought, proposed by [[Henri Frankfort]] and his wife Henriette Antonia Frankfort in the 1940s. According to this proposal, there was a "mythopoeic" stage, in which humanity did not think in terms of generalizations and impersonal laws: instead, humans saw each event as an act of will on the part of some personal being. This way of thinking supposedly explains the ancients' tendency to create [[myth]]s, which portray events as acts of gods and spirits. A physiological motivation for this was suggested by [[Julian Jaynes]] in 1976 in the form of [[bicameralism (psychology)|bicameralism]].

==The term==
The term ''[[wikt:mythopoeic|mythopoeic]]'' means "myth-making" (from Greek ''muthos,'' "myth", and ''poiein,'' "to make"). A group of Near Eastern specialists used the term in their 1946 book ''The Intellectual Adventure of Ancient Man: An Essay on Speculative Thought in the Ancient Near East,'' later republished as the 1949 paperback ''Before Philosophy: The Intellectual Adventure of Ancient Man.''&lt;ref&gt; Segal, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; In this book's introduction, two of the specialists, Henri and Mrs. H.A. Frankfort, argue that mythopoeic thought characterizes a distinct stage of human thought that differs fundamentally from modern, scientific thought. Mythopoeic thought, the Frankforts claim, was concrete and personifying, whereas modern thought is abstract and impersonal: more basically, mythopoeic thought is "pre-philosophical", while modern thought is "philosophical".&lt;ref&gt;Segal, p. 40–41&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this basic contrast between mythopoeic and modern thought, the Frankforts often use the term "mythopoeic thought" as a synonym for ancient thought in general.

==Characteristics==

===Personalistic view of nature===
According to the Frankforts, "the fundamental difference between the attitudes of modern and ancient man as regards the surrounding world is this: for modern, scientific man the phenomenal world is primarily an 'It'; for ancient—and also for primitive—man it is a 'Thou'".&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, modern man sees most things as impersonal objects, whereas ancient man sees most things as persons.

According to the Frankforts, ancients viewed the world this way because they didn't think in terms of universal laws. Modern thought "reduces the chaos of perceptions to an order in which typical events take place according to universal laws."&lt;ref name="Frankfort, p. 15"&gt;Frankfort, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; For example, consider a river that usually rises in the spring. Suppose that, one spring, the river fails to rise. In that case, modern thought doesn't conclude that the laws of nature have changed; instead, it searches for a set of fixed, universal laws that can explain why the river has risen in other cases but not in this case. Modern thought is abstract: it looks for unifying principles behind diversity.

In contrast, the Frankforts argue, "the primitive mind cannot withdraw to that extent from perceptual reality".&lt;ref name="Frankfort, p. 15"/&gt; Mythopoeic thought doesn't look for unifying principles behind the diversity of individual events. It is concrete, not abstract: it takes each individual event at face value. When a river rises one year and fails to rise another year, mythopoeic thought doesn't try to unite those two different events under a common law. Instead, "when the river does not rise, it has ''refused'' to rise".&lt;ref name="Frankfort, p. 15"/&gt; And if no law governs the river's behavior, if the river has simply "refused" to rise, then its failure to rise must be a ''choice'': "The river, or the gods, must be angry", and must be ''choosing'' to withhold the annual flooding.&lt;ref name="Frankfort, p. 15"/&gt; Thus, mythopoeic thought ends up viewing the entire world as personal: each event is an act of will.

===Tolerance of contradiction===
The Frankforts argue that mythopoeic thought explains the tolerance of seeming contradictions in mythology. According to the Frankforts' theory, the ancients didn't try to unite different experiences under a universal law; instead, they took each individual experience at face value. Therefore, they sometimes took one experience and developed a myth from it, and took a different experience and developed a different myth from it, without worrying whether those two myths contradicted each other: "The ancients ... are likely to present various descriptions of natural phenomena side by side even though they are mutually exclusive."&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the ancient Egyptians had three different creation myths.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, p. 50–60&lt;/ref&gt;

==The loss of mythopoeic thought==
According to the Frankforts, "ancient Egyptians and Mesopotamians"—the Frankforts' area of expertise—"lived in a wholly mythopoeic world".&lt;ref name="Segal, p. 42"&gt;Segal, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Each natural force, each concept, was a personal being from their viewpoint: "In Egypt and Mesopotamia the divine was comprehended as [[immanent]]: the gods were in nature."&lt;ref name="Frankfort, p. 363"&gt;Frankfort, p. 363&lt;/ref&gt; This immanence and multiplicity of the divine is a direct result of mythopoeic thought: hence, the first step in the loss of mythopoeic thought was the loss of this view of the divine. The ancient Hebrews took this first step through their doctrine of a single, transcendent God: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"When we read in Psalm 19 that 'the heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handiwork,' we hear a voice which mocks the beliefs of the Egyptians and Babylonians. The heavens, which were to the psalmist but a witness of God's greatness, were to the Mesopotamians the very majesty of godhead, the highest ruler, [[Anu]]. [...] The God of the psalmists and the prophets was not in nature. He transcended nature — and transcended, likewise, the realm of mythopoeic thought."&lt;ref name="Frankfort, p. 363"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ancient Hebrews still saw each major event as a divine act. However, they saw the divine as a single being—not a myriad of spirits, one for each natural phenomenon. Moreover, they didn't see the divine as a will within nature: for them, the divine will was a force or law ''behind'' all natural events.

Some Greek philosophers went further. Instead of seeing each event as an act of will, they developed a notion of impersonal, universal law: they finally abandoned mythopoeic thought, postulating impersonal laws behind all natural phenomena.&lt;ref name="Segal, p. 42"/&gt; These philosophers may not have been scientific by today's rigid standards: their hypotheses were often based on assumptions, not empirical data.&lt;ref name ="Frankfort, p. 386"&gt;Frankfort, p. 386&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the mere fact that they looked behind the apparent diversity and individuality of events in search of underlying laws, and defied "the prescriptive sanctities of religion", the Greeks broke away from mythopoeic thought.&lt;ref name="Frankfort, p. 386"/&gt;

==Criticism==
Religious scholar Robert Segal has pointed out that the dichotomy between a personal and an impersonal view of the world is not absolute, as the Frankforts' distinction between ancient and modern thought might suggest: "Any phenomenon can surely be experienced as both an It and a Thou: consider, for example, a pet and a patient."&lt;ref name="Segal, p. 42"/&gt; Furthermore, Segal argues, it is "embarrassingly simplistic" to call the ancient Near East "wholly mythopoeic", the Hebrews "largely nonmythopoeic", and the Greeks "wholly scientific".&lt;ref name="Segal, p. 42"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17301">'''Naturalized epistemology''', coined by [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. O. Quine]], is a collection of [[philosophy|philosophic]] views concerned with the [[theory of knowledge]] that emphasize the role of natural scientific methods. This shared emphasis on scientific methods of studying knowledge shifts focus to the [[empirical]] processes of [[knowledge acquisition]] and away from many traditional philosophical questions. There are noteworthy distinctions within naturalized [[epistemology]]. Replacement naturalism maintains that traditional [[epistemology]] should be abandoned and  replaced with the methodologies of the natural sciences.  The general thesis of cooperative naturalism is that traditional epistemology can benefit in its inquiry by using the knowledge we have gained from the [[cognitive science]]s.  Substantive naturalism focuses on an asserted equality of facts of knowledge and natural facts.  
 
Objections to naturalized epistemology have targeted features of the general project as well as characteristics of specific versions.  Some objectors suggest that natural scientific knowledge cannot be circularly grounded by the knowledge obtained through cognitive science, which is itself a natural science. This objection from circularity has been aimed specifically at strict replacement naturalism. There are similar challenges to substance naturalism that maintain that the substance naturalists' thesis that all facts of knowledge are natural facts is not only circular but fails to accommodate certain facts. Several other objectors have found fault in the inability of naturalized methods to adequately address questions about what value forms of potential knowledge have or lack. Naturalized epistemology is generally opposed to the [[antipsychologism]] of [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Karl Popper]], [[Edmund Husserl]] and others.

==Forms of naturalism==

===Replacement naturalism===
[[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. O. Quine's]] version of naturalized epistemology considers reasons for serious doubt about the fruitfulness of traditional philosophic study of scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name="Epistemology Naturalized"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Epistemology Naturalized |last=Quine |first=Willard |title=Epistemology: An Anthology |pages=292–300 |editor=E. Sosa &amp; J. Kim |publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]] |location=Malden, MA |isbn=0-631-19724-9 |date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; These concerns are raised in light of the long attested incapacity of philosophers to find a satisfactory answer to the problems of radical scepticism, more particularly, to [[David Hume]]'s criticism of induction. But also, because of the contemporaneous attempts and failures to reduce mathematics to pure logic by those in or philosophically sympathetic to [[Vienna Circle|The Vienna Circle]]. He concludes that studies of scientific knowledge concerned with meaning or truth fail to achieve the [[Descartes|Cartesian]] goal of [[certainty]]. The failures in the reduction of mathematics to pure logic imply that scientific knowledge can at best be defined with the aid of less certain set-theoretic notions. Even if set theory's lacking the certainty of pure logic is deemed acceptable, the usefulness of constructing an encoding of scientific knowledge as logic and set theory is undermined by the inability to construct a useful translation from logic and set-theory back to scientific knowledge. If no translation between scientific knowledge and the logical structures can be constructed that works both ways, then the properties of the purely logical and set-theoretic constructions do not usefully inform understanding of scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name="Epistemology Naturalized" /&gt;

On Quine's account, attempts to pursue the traditional project of finding the meanings and truths of science philosophically have failed on their own terms and failed to offer any advantage over the more direct methods of psychology. Quine rejects the analytic-synthetic distinction and emphasizes the holistic nature of our beliefs. Since traditional philosophic analysis of knowledge fails, those wishing to study knowledge ought to employ natural scientific methods. Scientific study of knowledge differs from philosophic study by focusing on how humans acquire knowledge rather than speculative analysis of knowledge.&lt;ref name="Epistemology Naturalized" /&gt; According to Quine, this appeal to science to ground the project of studying knowledge, which itself underlies science, should not be dismissed for its [[Circular reasoning|circularity]] since it is the best option available after ruling out traditional philosophic methods for their more serious flaws. This identification and tolerance of circularity is reflected elsewhere in Quine's works.&lt;ref name="Two Dogmas of Empiricism"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Two Dogmas of Empiricism |last=Quine |first=Willard |title=From a Logical Point of View |pages=20–46 |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |location=Cambridge, MA |isbn=0-674-32351-3 |date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cooperative naturalism===
Cooperative naturalism is a version of naturalized epistemology which states that while there are evaluative questions to pursue, the empirical results from psychology concerning how individuals actually think and reason are essential and useful for making progress in these evaluative questions.  This form of naturalism says that our psychological and biological limitations and abilities are relevant to the study of human knowledge.  Empirical work is relevant to epistemology but only if epistemology is itself as broad as the study of human knowledge.&lt;ref name="Naturalized Epistemology"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology-naturalized/ |title=Naturalized Epistemology |accessdate=September 31, 2009|first=Richard |last=Feldman |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Substantive naturalism===
Substantive naturalism is a form of naturalized epistemology that emphasizes how all epistemic facts are natural facts.  Natural facts can be based on two main ideas.  The first is that all natural facts include all facts that science would verify.  The second is to provide a list of examples that consists of natural items.  This will help in deducing what else can be included.&lt;ref name="Naturalized Epistemology" /&gt;

==Criticism==
Quine articulates the problem of circularity inherent in naturalized epistemology when it is treated as a replacement for traditional epistemology.&lt;ref name="Epistemology Naturalized" /&gt; If the goal of traditional epistemology is to validate or to provide the foundation for the natural sciences, naturalized epistemology would be tasked with validating the natural sciences by means of those very sciences. That is, an empirical investigation into the criteria which are used to scientifically evaluate evidence must presuppose those very same criteria.&lt;ref name="Philosophy of Science Naturalized"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Giere |first=Ronald |date=1985 |title=Philosophy of Science Naturalized |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages=331–356 |doi=10.1086/289255|citeseerx=10.1.1.411.1923 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Quine points out that these thoughts of validation are merely a byproduct of traditional epistemology.&lt;ref name="Epistemology Naturalized" /&gt; Instead, the naturalized epistemologist should only be concerned with understanding the link between observation and science even if that understanding relies on the very science under investigation.&lt;ref name="Epistemology Naturalized" /&gt;

In order to understand the link between observation and science, Quine's naturalized epistemology must be able to identify and describe the process by which scientific knowledge is acquired. One form of this investigation is [[reliabilism]] which requires that a belief be the product of some reliable method if it is to be considered knowledge. Since naturalized epistemology relies on empirical evidence, all epistemic facts which comprise this reliable method must be reducible to natural facts.&lt;ref name="Naturalized Epistemology" /&gt; That is, all facts related to the process of understanding must be expressible in terms of natural facts. If this is not true, i.e. there are facts which cannot be expressed as natural facts, science would have no means of investigating them. In this vein, [[Roderick Chisholm]] argues that there are epistemic principles (or facts) which are necessary to knowledge acquisition, but may not be, themselves, natural facts.&lt;ref name="Naturalized Epistemology" /&gt; If Chisholm is correct, naturalized epistemology would be unable to account for these epistemic principles and, as a result, would be unable to wholly describe the process by which knowledge is obtained.

Beyond Quine's own concerns and potential discrepancies between epistemic and natural facts, [[Hilary Putnam]] argues that the replacement of traditional epistemology with naturalized epistemology necessitates the elimination of the [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]].&lt;ref name="Why Reason Can't Be Naturalized"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Why Reason Can't Be Naturalized |last=Putnam |first=Hilary |title=Epistemology: An Anthology |pages=314–324|editor=E. Sosa &amp; J. Kim |publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]] |location=Malden, MA |isbn=0-631-19724-9 |date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But without the normative, there is no "justification, rational acceptability [nor] warranted assertibility". Ultimately, there is no "true" since any method for arriving at the truth was abandoned with the normative. All notions which would explain truth are only intelligible when the normative is presupposed.  Moreover, for there to be "thinkers", there "must be some kind of truth"; otherwise, "our thoughts aren't really about anything[,...] there is no sense in which any thought is right or wrong".&lt;ref name="Why Reason Can't Be Naturalized" /&gt; Without the normative to dictate how one should proceed or which methods should be employed, naturalized epistemology cannot determine the "right" criteria by which empirical evidence should be evaluated.&lt;ref name="Philosophy of Science Naturalized" /&gt; But these are precisely the issues which traditional epistemology has been tasked with. If naturalized epistemology does not provide the means for addressing these issues, it cannot succeed as a replacement to traditional epistemology.

[[Jaegwon Kim]], another critic of naturalized epistemology, further articulates the difficulty of removing the normative component. He notes that modern epistemology has been dominated by the concepts of [[Theory of justification|justification]] and [[Reliabilism|reliability]].&lt;ref name="What is Naturalized Epistemology"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=What is 'Naturalized Epistemology'? |last=Kim |first=Jaegwon |title=Epistemology: An Anthology |pages=301–313 |editor=E. Sosa &amp; J. Kim |publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]] |location=Malden, MA |isbn=0-631-19724-9 |date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kim explains that epistemology and knowledge are nearly eliminated in their common sense meanings without normative concepts such as these. These concepts are meant to engender the question "What conditions must a belief meet if we are justified in accepting it as true?". That is to say, what are the necessary criteria by which a particular belief can be declared as "true" (or, should it fail to meet these criteria, can we rightly infer its falsity)? This notion of truth rests solely on the conception and application of the criteria which are set forth in traditional and modern theories of epistemology.

Kim adds to this claim by explaining how the idea of "justification" is the only notion (among "belief" and "truth") which is the defining characteristic of an epistemological study. To remove this aspect is to alter the very meaning and goal of epistemology, whereby we are no longer discussing the study and acquisition of knowledge. Justification is what makes knowledge valuable and normative; without it what can rightly be said to be true or false? We are left with only descriptions of the processes by which we arrive at a belief. Kim realizes that Quine is moving epistemology into the realm of psychology, where Quine’s main interest is based on the sensory input-output relationship of an individual. This account can never establish an affirmable statement which can lead us to truth, since all statements without the normative are purely descriptive (which can never amount to knowledge). The vulgar allowance of any statement without discrimination as scientifically valid, though not true, makes Quine’s theory difficult to accept under any epistemic theory which requires truth as the object of knowledge.

As a result of these objections and others like them, most, including Quine in his later writings, have agreed that naturalized epistemology as a replacement may be too strong of a view.&lt;ref name="Naturalized Epistemology" /&gt; However, these objections have helped shape rather than completely eliminate naturalized epistemology. One product of these objections is cooperative naturalism which holds that empirical results are essential and useful to epistemology. That is, while traditional epistemology cannot be eliminated, neither can it succeed in its investigation of knowledge without empirical results from the natural sciences.  In any case, Quinean Replacement Naturalism finds relatively few supporters.&lt;ref name="Naturalized Epistemology" /&gt;

The [[Parmenides]] Foundation was founded by [[Albrecht von Müller]] in 2000 to support interdisciplinary research on thinking.
The foundation has an international faculty of more than 30 researchers from the fields of [[neurosciences]], [[philosophy]], [[neuroinformatics]], [[cognitive psychology]], [[linguistics]], [[evolutionary anthropology]].
Part of the research faculty focusses on two areas: developing an integrative conceptual framework and testing respective hypotheses via various imaging techniques (especially [[fMRI]], [[EEG]] and [[near infrared spectroscopy|NIRS]]) as well as in complementary behavioural studies.

The foundation is a cooperative partner of the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]] and its researchers collaborate with the faculties of experimental and developmental psychology, philosophy, and medicine.

The foundation sells Parmenides EIDOS Suite, which is a derivative of the Think Tools Suite of the now defunct [[Think Tools AG]].

[[File:David Filippo Mazzei.jpg|thumb|215px|Philip Mazzei; portrait by &lt;br /&gt;[[Jacques-Louis David]] (c.1790)]]
'''Filippo Mazzei''' ({{IPA-it|matˈtsei}}, but sometimes erroneously cited with the name of '''Philip Mazzie'''; December 25, 1730 – March 19, 1816) was an [[Italy|Italian]] physician. A close friend of [[Thomas Jefferson]], Mazzei acted as an agent to purchase arms for [[Virginia]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]].

==Biography==
Mazzei was born '''Filippo Mazzei''' in [[Poggio a Caiano]] in [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscany]] as a son of Domenico and Elisabetta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Łukaszewicz |first=Witold |date=1948 |title=Filippo Mazzei (1730-1816). Zarys biograficzny |url=http://kpbc.umk.pl/dlibra/publication?id=46207&amp;tab=3 |journal=Kwartalnik Historyczny |volume= |issue=3–4 |page=304 |doi= |accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied medicine in [[Florence]] and practiced in Italy and the [[Middle East]] for several years before moving to [[London]] in 1755 to take up a mercantile career as an importer. In London he worked as a teacher of Italian language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Łukaszewicz |first=Witold |date=1948 |title=Filippo Mazzei (1730–1816). Zarys biograficzny |url=http://kpbc.umk.pl/dlibra/publication?id=46207&amp;tab=3 |journal=Kwartalnik Historyczny |volume= |issue=3–4 |page=305 |doi= |accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in London he met the Americans [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]] of Virginia. While doing work for Franklin, Mazzei shared his idea of importing Tuscan products, wine and olive trees, to the New World.  They convinced him to undertake his next venture.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

On September 2, 1773 Mazzei boarded a ship from Livorno to Virginia bringing with him plants, seeds, silkworms, and 10 farmers from [[Lucca]].  While visiting Jefferson at his estate, the two became good friends and Jefferson gave Mazzei a large allotment of land for an experimental plantation. Mazzei and Jefferson started what became the first commercial vineyard in the Commonwealth of Virginia. They shared an interest in politics and liberal values, and maintained an active correspondence for the rest of Mazzei's life.

In 1779 Mazzei returned to Italy as a secret agent for the state of Virginia. He purchased and shipped arms to them until 1783. After briefly visiting the [[United States]] again in 1785, Mazzei travelled throughout Europe promoting Republican ideals. He wrote a political history of the American Revolution, 'Recherches historiques et politiques sur les Etats-Unis de l'Amerique septentrionale", and published it in [[Paris]] in 1788. After its publication Mazzei became an unofficial roving ambassador in Europe for American ideas and institutions.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

While in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] he became attached as a [[Privy council|Privy Councilor]] at the court of King [[Stanislaus II Augustus Poniatowski, King of Poland|Stanislaus II]]. There he became acquainted with Polish liberal and constitutional thought, like the works of [[Wawrzyniec Grzymała Goślicki]] and ideas of [[Golden Freedoms]] and [[Great Sejm]]. King Stanislaus appointed Mazzei to be Poland's representative in Paris, where he again met Jefferson.

After Poland [[partitions of Poland|was partitioned]] between [[Russia]] and [[Prussia]] in 1795, Mazzei, along with the rest of the Polish court, was given a pension by the Russian crown. He later spent more time in France, becoming active in the politics of the [[French Revolution]] under the [[French Directory|Directorate]]. When [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] overthrew that government Mazzei returned to [[Pisa, Italy]]. He died there in 1816. After his death the remainder of his family returned to the United States at the urging of Thomas Jefferson. They settled in Massachusetts and Virginia. Mazzei's daughter married a nephew of [[John Adams]]. {{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

He was buried at the Pisa Suburbano Cemetery in Pisa.&lt;ref&gt;{{FAG|11279834}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mazzei letter==
Many biographers believe Jefferson and Washington had a falling out over a letter Jefferson sent to Mazzei in Italy, which called Washington's administration "Anglican, monarchical, and aristocratical" as England and claimed that Washington had appointed as military officers "all timid men that prefer the calm of despotism to the boisterous sea of liberty ... [I]t would give you a fever were I to name to you the apostates who have gone over to these heresies, men who were Samsons in the field and Solomons in the council, but who have had their heads shorn by the harlot England." The letter was eventually published overseas and then re-translated back into English by [[Noah Webster]] and published in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.princeton.edu/~tjpapers/mazzei/index.html "Jefferson's Letter to Philip Mazzei"], ''The Papers of Thomas Jefferson'', princeton.edu; accessed October 21, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acknowledgment==
The contribution of Philip Mazzei to the Declaration of Independence was acknowledged by [[John F. Kennedy]] in his book ''[[A Nation of Immigrants]]'', in which he states that:&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, John F. ''A Nation of Immigrants'', pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The great doctrine 'All men are created equal'&lt;ref&gt;Philip Mazzei, The Virginia Gazette, 1774. Translated by a friend and neighbor, Thomas Jefferson:&lt;br&gt;{{quote|Tutti gli uomini sono per natura egualmente liberi e indipendenti. Quest'eguaglianza è necessaria per costituire un governo libero. Bisogna che ognuno sia uguale all'altro nel diritto naturale.}} {{quote|All men are by nature equally free and independent. Such equality is necessary in order to create a free government.&lt;br&gt; All men must be equal to each other in natural law}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to Joint Resolution 175 of the 103rd Congress: the phrase in the Declaration of Independence 'All men are created equal', was suggested by the Italian patriot and immigrant Philip Mazzei.[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=103_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:hj175eh.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; and incorporated into the Declaration of Independence by Thomas Jefferson, was paraphrased from the writing of Philip Mazzei, an Italian-born patriot and pamphleteer, who was a close friend of Jefferson. A few alleged scholars try to discredit Mazzei as the creator of this statement and idea, saying that "there is no mention of it anywhere until after the Declaration was published". This phrase appears in Italian in Mazzei's own hand, written in Italian, several years prior to the writing of the Declaration of Independence. Mazzei and Jefferson often exchanged ideas about true liberty and freedom. No one man can take complete credit for the ideals of American democracy.}}

==Legacy==
A 40-cent United States airmail stamp was issued in 1980 to commemorate the 250th anniversary of Mazzei's birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usstampgallery.com/view.php?id=5842d61e7d7b7bcb645c0c16b0dbe3c62b457ba0|title=US Stamp Gallery &gt;&gt; Philip Mazzei|first=Iqzero.net and Dick|last=Sine|website=www.usstampgallery.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1777">In the field of [[epistemology]], the '''problem of the criterion''' is an issue regarding the starting point of knowledge. This is a separate and more fundamental issue than the [[regress argument]] found in discussions on [[Epistemology#Justification|justification]] of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IEP |url-id=criterio |title=Problem of the criterion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American philosopher Roderick Chisholm in his ''[[Theory of Knowledge (book)|Theory of Knowledge]]'' details the problem of the criterion with two sets of questions:

# What do we know? or What is the extent of our knowledge?
# How do we know? or What is the criterion of knowing?

An answer to either set of questions will allow us to devise a means of answering the other. Answering the former question set first is called ''[[Epistemological particularism|particularism]]'', whereas answering the latter set first is called ''[[Methodism (philosophy)|methodism]]''. A third solution is ''[[skepticism]]'', which proclaims that since one cannot have an answer to the first set of questions without first answering the second set, and one cannot hope to answer the second set of questions without first knowing the answers to the first set, we are, therefore, unable to answer either. This has the result of us being unable to justify any of our beliefs.

Particularist theories organize things already known and attempt to use these particulars of knowledge to find a method of how we know, thus answering the second question set. Methodist theories propose an answer to question set two and proceed to use this to establish what we, in fact, know. Classical [[empiricism]] embraces the methodist approach.

'''RSVP''' is a process for a response from the invited person or people. It is an [[Acronym and initialism|initialism]] derived from the [[French language|French]] phrase '''''Répondez s'il vous plaît''''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.linternaute.com/dictionnaire/fr/definition/rsvp/|title=Rsvp : Définition simple et facile du dictionnaire|website=www.linternaute.com|language=fr|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "Please respond" to require confirmation of an invitation. The initialism "RSVP"  is no longer used much in France, where it is considered formal and old-fashioned (if not totally unknown by most French people). In French, the complete sentence "Répondez s'il vous plaît"  gives the impression the speaker is begging for an answer. In France, it is now more common to use "Réponse attendue avant le...", meaning "[Your] answer is expected before...". In addition, the French initialism "SVP" is frequently used to represent "s'il vous plaît" ("please").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.linternaute.com/dictionnaire/fr/definition/svp/|title=Svp : Définition simple et facile du dictionnaire|website=www.linternaute.com|language=fr|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== RSVP, regrets only==

The phrase "RSVP, regrets only", or simply "Regrets only", is a popular modern variation that implies "if you do not reply, that will be taken as an acceptance."

More specifically, if most invitations can be assumed to be accepted, a "regrets only" RSVP will reduce the communication required by both the host and their guests. The phrase "Regrets only" refers to the assumption that a declination will be worded with some variation of "We regret we cannot attend...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.announcingit.com/how_to/RSVP_vs_Regrets_Only.htm |title=RSVP vs. Regrets Only |website=www.announcingit.com |series=Invitation Do's and Don'ts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Save the date cards==
Prior to sending the RSVP invitation, the host may mail out a "save the date" card to advise the date and location of the celebration. This may be used when the event will be held a considerable time in the future and/or in a distant location to allow for travel plans, for such events as a wedding, christening, or any other important event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emilypost.com/weddings/new-times-new-traditions/368-21st-century-wedding-trends|title=Invitation Etiquette|publisher=The Emily Post Institute, Inc.|accessdate=2012-06-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620042020/http://www.emilypost.com/weddings/new-times-new-traditions/368-21st-century-wedding-trends|archivedate=2012-06-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==RSVP please==
In recent years, the use of RSVP in the English language has spread outside of the discourse of highly formal correspondence and commonly figures in group emails. In this context, the acronym seems to have loosened its tie to its original meaning and is often understood simply as an abbreviation for "reply". Some writers therefore routinely use the phrase "RSVP please",{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} which is a case of [[RAS syndrome]] or a [[pleonasm]].

[[File:Hugostv.jpg|thumb|Miniature of [[Hugh of Saint Victor]] teaching the young canons of Richard's abbey]]
'''Richard of Saint Victor''', [[Canons Regular|C.R.S.A.]] (died 1173) was a Medieval Scottish philosopher and theologian and one of the most influential religious thinkers of his time. A [[canon regular]], he was a prominent [[Mystical theology|mystical theologian]], and was [[prior]] of the famous Augustinian [[Abbey of St. Victor, Paris|Abbey of Saint Victor]] in Paris from 1162 until his death in 1173.

==Life==

Very little is known about the origins and upbringing of Richard of Saint Victor. John of Toulouse wrote a short ''Vita'' of Richard in the seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;This is reprinted in PL 196:9–14&lt;/ref&gt; He said that Richard came from [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;For further evidence of Richard's British origins, see Franklin T. Harkins and Frans van Liere, eds, ''Interpretation of scripture: theory. A selection of works of Hugh, Andrew, Richard and Godfrey of St Victor, and of Robert of Melun,'' (Turnhout, Belgium: Brepols, 2012), p289.&lt;/ref&gt; John added that Richard was received into the Abbey of St Victor by Abbot Gilduin (1114–1155) and was a student under [[Hugh of St Victor]], the most influential of all Victorine teachers (implying that Richard entered the community before Hugh's death in 1141).&lt;ref&gt;At this time, under the abbot Gilduin, Saint Victor was a thriving community and upon Gilduin's death, the abbey had 44 dependant houses of canons.&lt;/ref&gt; This account of Richard's early life is not accepted by all modern scholars, however, and some have suggested that Richard entered the abbey after Hugh's death in 1141.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd Taylor Coolman and Dale M Coulter, eds, ''Trinity and Creation'', (2010), p198.&lt;/ref&gt;

All scholarship agrees, however, that Richard was a magister during the 1150s,&lt;ref&gt;For further theorising on the state of the Abbey of t Victor in the 1150s, and the nature of Richard's teaching, see For further evidence of Richard's British origins, see Franklin T. Harkins and Frans van Liere, eds, ''Interpretation of scripture: theory. A selection of works of Hugh, Andrew, Richard and Godfrey of St Victor, and of Robert of Melun'', (Turnhout, Belgium: Brepols, 2012), pp289-294.&lt;/ref&gt; and was then promoted to subprior in 1159 (as stated by a document found at the abbey).  He served under [[Achard of St. Victor]]'s elected successor Ernisius, who was unworthy of the position.&lt;ref&gt;Feiss, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; Richard's life was then burdened by the frustrations of working under a man who was ill-suited for his responsibilities. Ernisius wasted the abbey's resources on overly ambitious building projects and persecuted those who attempted to resist him. Richard was allowed to keep his office but his influence was restricted. Things became so unbearable that an appeal was made to the Pope, who then visited Saint Victor in 1162.&lt;ref&gt;Richard p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Through a multitude of transactions, Ernisius was eventually removed from his position and the Pope commended Richard for his continued involvement in the matter. Letters from England written to Richard show that he was in constant touch with English affairs and give evidence of the international character of intellectual life at this time.&lt;ref&gt;Cahn p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

He was then promoted to prior in 1162, a position he held until his death on 10 March 1173.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd Taylor Coolman and Dale M Coulter, eds, ''Trinity and Creation'', (2010), p198.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings==
[[File:Richardi Parisiensis Opera.tif|thumb|''Richardi Parisiensis Opera'' (1650)]]
Richard wrote extensively (Migne's ''[[Patrologia Latina]]'' contains 34 works attributed to him, and this is not Richard's full corpus).&lt;ref&gt;McGinn, ''The Growth of Mysticism'', p593 points out that ''In Cantica Canticorum'', attributed by Migne to Richard (196:0405-0524) is not by Richard, but belongs to the thirteenth century. Some of the spiritual treatises not found in PL196 have been edited in Jean Chatillon and William-Joseph Tulloch, eds, ''Richard de Saint-Victor: Sermons et opuscules spirituels inédits'', (Paris: Desclée, 1949).&lt;/ref&gt; There are some problems with establishing the chronology of Richard’s works. The earliest ones come before 1153, and the latest were written one or two years before his death.&lt;ref&gt;Richard p.21&lt;/ref&gt; His earlier works are similar to the general teaching and writing of the period. His writing develops from basic exegesis, theology and philosophy to more of a study of purely spiritual questions. In his early writings he relies on the moral interpretations of previous theologians such as [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Bede]], [[Pope Gregory I]] and Hugh. He later became more independent and strayed from Hugh's influence.&lt;ref&gt;Feiss p.145&lt;/ref&gt; There is some debate between historians about which of Richard's texts are the most influential and important. Because Richard's work covers many spheres of thought it is somewhat difficult to categorise his work.

===''The Book of the Twelve Patriarchs'', or ''Benjamin Minor''===
''The Book of the Twelve Patriarchs'', sometimes titled ''Benjamin Minor'', is one of Richard of Saint Victor's great works on contemplation.&lt;ref&gt;The Latin title of the work is sometimes given as ''De duodecim patriarchis'', and sometimes as ''De praeparatione animi ad contemplationem. Liber dictus Benjamin minor''. The Latin text is in Migne, PL196:1–64. A more modern Latin text is in Jean Châtillon and Monique Duchet-Suchaux, ''Les douze patriarches, ou, Beniamin minor'', Sources chretiennes 419, (Paris: Cerf, 1997). An English translation is in Richard of St Victor, ''Twelve Patriarchs, Mystical Ark, Book Three of the Trinity.'' Translation and introduction by Grover A. Zinn. (Toronto: Paulist Press, 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; It is not exactly known when it was written, but it would seem to date before 1162. Richard specifies that this work is not a treatise on contemplation but rather prepares the mind for contemplation.&lt;ref&gt;Healy, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;!-- unreferenced and opinative. 
He uses the story of Jacob and his clan to create a treatise on the psychology of vices and virtues. He uses the different elements of the tale to bring to light the relationship between the mind and the body, the senses and reason. By doing this he wishes to establish within the younger members of his community a scheme to discern right and wrong actions through the powers of the mind. It is almost as though Richard is teaching the basic principles of psychology combined with spiritual doctrine. The whole purpose of this text is to prepare his students for contemplation and for a union with God.  Each chapter starts with a text which serves the idea of the writer and other texts are introduced to confirm his points.
--&gt;

===''The Mystical Ark'', or ''Benjamin Major''===
''The Mystical Ark'', sometimes called ''Benjamin Major'' or ''The Grace of Contemplation'' completes this with the study of the mind in relation to prayer.&lt;ref&gt;The Latin title is ''De gratia contemplationis...hacenus dictum Benjamin major (De arca mystica)''. The Latin text is in Migne, PL:196.63-202, with a more modern edition of the Latin text in Marc-Aeilko Aris, ed, ''Contemplatio. Philosophische Studien zum Traktat Benjamin Maior des Richard von St. Victor'', (Frankfurt: Josef Knecht, 1996). An English translation is in Richard of St Victor, ''Twelve Patriarchs, Mystical Ark, Book Three of the Trinity.'' Translation and introduction by Grover A. Zinn. (Toronto: Paulist Press, 1979), pp151-370.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the last chapters of ''Benjamin Major'', written later than the Minor, Richard almost abandons his topic and the discussion of the teaching of mystical theology takes up a good portion of every remaining chapter. He is still attempting to instruct his followers on a text but he has also engaged himself in creating a system of mystical theology.

===''De Trinitate''===
One of Richard’s greatest works was the ''De Trinitate'' which was probably written while Richard was prior, between 1162 and 1173.&lt;ref&gt;For the question of dating, see Coolman and Taylor, ''Trinity and Creation'', (2010), p200.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Migne version of the Latin text is in PL 196:887–992, and is a reprint of the 1650 edition of John of Toulouse. A modern critical edition of the Latin text is in Jean Ribaillier, ed, ''Richard de Saint-Victor. De Trinitate. Texte critique avec introduction, notes et tables'', (Paris: Vrin, 1958). A bilingual (Latin text with French translation) was published by Sources Chrétiennes (no. 63; Textes Monastiques d' Occident, III) in 1959. Full English translations are available in two works: Boyd Taylor Coolman and Dale M Coulter, eds, ''Trinity and creation: a selection of works of Hugh, Richard and Adam of St Victor'', (Turnhout: Brepols, 2010), and R. Angelici, ''Richard of Saint Victor: On the Trinity. English Translation and Commentary'' (Eugene: Cascade, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; This is known because it incorporates pieces of theological text which editors are now finding in earlier works.&lt;ref&gt;Richard, p.21&lt;/ref&gt; ''De Trinitate'' is Richard's most independent and original study on dogmatic theology. It stems from the desire to show that dogmatic truths of Christian revelation are ultimately not against reason. Richard's theological approach stems from a profoundly mystical life of prayer, which in the Spirit seeks to involve the mind, in continuation with the Augustinian and Anselmian tradition.

Owing to the fact that until recently this masterpiece has not been available in any English translation, its diffusion has been limited and its influence has seldom gone beyond 'Book III', condemning serious enquiry to an understanding of Richard's argument that is only partial.&lt;ref&gt;Angelici, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in 2011, through the efforts of Ruben Angelici's scholarship, the first, full translation of Richard's 'De Trinitate' has been released for publication in English and now this scholastic masterpiece is readily available to a wider audience to be appreciated in its entirety.

===Other Treatises and Works===
Richard wrote a massive handbook of biblical education entitled ''Liber Exceptionum'' (''Book of Selections/Book of Notes''),&lt;ref&gt;The Latin text is in Jean Chatillon, ed, ''Richard de Saint-Victor. Liber Exceptionum. Texte critique avec introduction, notes et tables'', (Paris: Vrin, 1958). Selections exist as an English translation in Franklin T. Harkins and Frans van Liere, eds, ''Interpretation of scripture: theory. A selection of works of Hugh, Andrew, Richard and Godfrey of St Victor, and of Robert of Melun'', (Turnhout, Belgium: Brepols, 2012), pp289-326&lt;/ref&gt; important scriptural commentaries, and many treatises.

''The Four Degrees of Violent Charity'',&lt;ref&gt;A critical edition of the Latin text is Gervais Dumeige, ed, ''De quatuor gradibus violentae caritatis'', in ''Ive, Épître à Séverin sur la charité. Richard de Saint-Victor. Les quatre degrés de la violente charité'', (Paris: J Vrin, 1955). An abridged English translation is in ''Richard of St Victor, Selected Writings on Contemplation''. Translated with an introduction and notes by Clare Kirchberger. (London: Faber and Faber, 1957), pp213-33, with a full translation in Hugh Feiss, ed, ''On Love'', (2011), pp300.&lt;/ref&gt; composed about 1170,&lt;ref&gt;See Hugh Feiss, ed, ''On Love'', (2011), p263.&lt;/ref&gt; with its description of how vehement love leads to union with God and more perfect service of neighbour, has been of interest to writers interested in Christian mysticism.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard McGinn, ''The Growth of Mysticism'', (1994), p398.&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard’s other treatises are a number of short works which mainly deal with textual difficulties and theological issues.&lt;ref&gt;A helpful list , including modern editions of each text, can be found in Hugh Feiss, ed, ''On Love'', (2010), pp22-6. They include ''De questionibus regule sancti Augustini solutis'', whose Latin text is in ML Colker, ed, ‘Richard of St Victor and the anonymous of Bridlington’, ''Traditio'' 18 (1962), 181–227.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of them can be grouped together with larger works. Some of them are correspondence between Richard and his students while others seem to have been written at the request of friends.&lt;ref&gt;Richard, p.22&lt;/ref&gt; Although short, they are often interesting because they allow the modern reader to see the mentality of the students and the discussions and issues of the time.

Richard of Saint Victor’s ''Commentary on Ezekiel'' is of special interest in the field of art history because they explanations laid out by the author are accompanied by illustrations. A number of copies have come down to us, none of which are dated, but they are written in a style attributable to the second half of the twelfth century.&lt;ref&gt;Cahn, p.53&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiographical contributions==
What makes Richard of Saint-Victor stand out from other theologians of his time is that he approaches theological problems as more of a psychologist, contributing to 'a careful analysis of contemplative experiences.'&lt;ref&gt;Zinn p2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rosa Peace 1945.jpg|thumb|250px|''Rosa'' 'Madame A. Meilland' (Peace)]]

The '''Peace''' [[rose]], formally '''''Rosa'' 'Madame A. Meilland'''', is a well-known and successful [[garden rose]]. By 1992, over one&amp;nbsp;hundred&amp;nbsp;million plants of this [[hybrid tea rose|hybrid tea]] had been sold. The [[cultivar]] has large flowers of a light yellow to cream color, slightly flushed at the petal edges with crimson-pink. It is hardy and vigorous and relatively resistant to disease, making it popular in gardens as well as in the floral trade.

It was developed by [[France|French]] horticulturist [[Francis Meilland]] in the years 1935 to 1939. When Meilland foresaw the German invasion of France, he sent cuttings to friends in Italy, Turkey, Germany, and the United States to protect the new rose. It is said that it was sent to the US on the last plane available before the German invasion, where it was safely propagated by the [[Conard Pyle Co.]] during the war.&lt;ref name=meilland&gt;{{cite book|title=Meilland, a Life in Roses |last1=Meilland |first1=Alain |last2=Lambert |first2=Gilles |pages=65–71 |date=April 1984 |publisher=Southern Illinois Univ Pr |isbn=0809311119 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gloria Dei Bamberg.jpg|thumb|250px]]
The cultivar was hybridized in 1935, receiving the number 3-35-40 (the third hybridization in 1935, and the 40th cultivar selected for test proliferation). As those first tests produced beautiful flowers in autumn of 1936, the first no. 3-35-40 were grown in Meilland's rose fields in June 1939. That summer, cuttings were sent to partners in other countries. According to Meilland's records, 'Madame A. Meilland' was hybridized from the hybrid tea 'Margaret McGredy' and an unnamed seedling.&lt;ref name=blv&gt;{{cite book |title=Die BLV Rosen Enzyklopädie |publisher= BLV |author= Robert Markley |page=27 |ISBN= 978-3-8354-0272-0 |language= German |trans-title=The BLV Encyclopedia of Roses|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Naming ==
Because Meilland had sent out his cuttings just before the war, communication between the cultivators was not possible, which is why the rose received different names. In France, Francis and Alain Meilland decided to call the cultivar 'Madame A. Meilland', in honor of Francis' deceased mother, Alain Meilland's wife Claudia.&lt;ref name=blv /&gt; This is the formal cultivar name. Other names are considered by the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants as trade or [[International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants#Trade designations|selling name]]s. In Italy it was called {{tdes|Gioia}} (Italian for "joy"), in Germany {{tdes|Gloria Dei}} (Latin for "glory of God") and in the US, Sweden, and Norway {{tdes|Peace}}.

The rose eventually became known as {{tdes|Peace}}. In early 1945 rose grower Meilland wrote to Field Marshal Alan Brooke (later Viscount [[Alanbrooke]]) to thank him for his key part in the liberation of France and to ask if Brooke would give his name to the rose. Brooke declined saying that, though he was honored to be asked, his name would soon be forgotten and a much better and more enduring name would be "Peace".

The adoption of the trade name "Peace" was publicly announced in the [[United States]] on 29 April 1945 by the introducers, [[Conard Pyle Co.]] This was the very day that Berlin fell, a day considered a turning point in the [[Second World War]] in Europe.&lt;ref name=meilland /&gt; Later that year Peace roses were given to each of the delegations at the inaugural meeting of the [[United Nations]] in [[San Francisco]], each with a note that read:

:"We hope the 'Peace' rose will influence men’s thoughts for everlasting [[world peace]]".

[[Peter Beales]], English rose grower and expert, said in his book ''Roses'':

:"'Peace', without doubt, is the finest Hybrid Tea ever raised and it will remain a standard variety forever".

== Description ==
'Mme A. Meilland' forms elegant buds that open to large, cupped flowers with a high-centered form and an average diameter of {{convert|15|cm|abbr=on}}. Their color is a combination of pale yellow and crimson edges that depends on the location, the weather and changes as the flower fades. The durable flowers are very full, with 40 to 43 petals, survive rainy periods, and have a sweet and fruity fragrance that varies in its strength from mild to strong.&lt;ref name=RHS_encyclopedia&gt;{{cite book |title=Rosen - die große Enzyklopädie |publisher= Dorling Kindersley |author= Charles and Brigid Quest-Ritson |page=263 |ISBN=978-3-8310-1734-8 |language=German |trans-title=RHS Encyclopedia of Roses |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cultivar flowers continuously throughout the season up to the first frost.

The vigorous shrub grows {{convert|120|to|200|cm|ft|abbr=on|frac=2}} high and {{convert|90|to|125|cm|ftin|abbr=on}} wide, is winter hardy down to {{convert|−23|C|abbr=on|disp=or}} ([[USDA zone]] 6), half-shade tolerant, and disease resistant. The large, glossy leaves are very dark and leathery. 'Mme A. Meilland' is very versatile—it is used as cut rose and as garden rose, solitarily or in groups, as standard rose to {{convert|90|cm|ft|abbr=on}} high, or in containers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Alles über Rosen |publisher= Eugen Ulmer KG |author= Klaus-Jürgen Strobel |page=208 |ISBN= 3-8001-4471-9 |language= German |trans-title=Everything about Roses|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
'Mme A. Meilland' has been granted numerous awards, starting with the selection as ''Most Beautiful French Rose'' in Lyon in 1942, gold medals in Lyon (1942), Portland (1944), The Hague (1965) and from the [[Royal National Rose Society]] in 1947. In 1944, it was included in the All-America Rose Selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.helpmefind.com/rose/pl.php?n=2203&amp;tab=18 |title='Peace' rose Awards |publisher=HelpMeFind |date= |accessdate=2014-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, it was the first cultivar to be granted the highest award a rose can be granted when it was selected as ''World's Favorite Rose'' and included into the [[Rose Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldrose.org/awards/hof/hof.asp |title=Rose Hall of Fame |publisher=World Federation of Rose Societies |date=2012-09-25 |accessdate=2014-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sports and hybrid offspring ==
As an often cultivated plant, several [[sport (botany)|sports]] of 'Mme A. Meilland' are known. 'Climbing Peace' ([[W. Kordes' Söhne|Kordes]] 1951) has slightly bigger flowers but flowers less well, 'Chicago Peace' (Johnston 1962) differs mainly in its richer colors with a mixture of crimson and apricot, while 'Kronenbourg' (syn. 'Flaming Peace', McGredy 1966) has red petals with yellow backs, creating an interesting contrast.&lt;ref name=RHS_encyclopedia /&gt;

It is also used in the hybridization of new cultivars, and played a role in the development of well known cultivars such as [[Rosa 'Garden Party'|'Garden Party']] (Swim, 1959), [[Rosa 'Super Star'|'Super Star']] (Tantau, 1960), and 'Pullman Orient Express' (Lim &amp; Twomey, 1991).

{{about|the Japanese term|the [[Dragon Ball]] character|Master Roshi|the [[Saint Seiya]] character|Libra Dohko}}
{{Zen Buddhism}}
{{nihongo|'''''Rōshi'''''|老師}} ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: "old teacher"; "old master"; [[Chinese language|Chinese]] {{zh|p=Lǎoshī}}) is a title in [[Zen Buddhism]] with different usages depending on sect and county. In [[Rinzai Zen]], the term is reserved only for individuals who have received ''[[inka shōmei]]'', meaning they have completed the entire ''[[kōan]]'' curriculum; this amounts to a total of less than 100 people at any given time. In [[Sōtō]] Zen and [[Sanbo Kyodan]] it is used more loosely. This is especially the case in the United States and Europe, where almost any teacher who has received [[dharma transmission]] might be called rōshi, or even use it to refer to themselves, a practice unheard of in Japan.

==Etymology==
The Japanese ''rōshi'' is a translation of the more antiquated Chinese ''[[Laozi]]'' ([[Wade-Giles]]; ''Lao Tzu'') meaning 'Old Master' and connoting the archetype of a [[wise old man]]. The modern Chinese 老師/老师 (''Chinese'' {{zh|p=Lǎoshī}}) is a common word for teacher or professor without the religious or spiritual connotation of ''rōshi''. Chinese [[Chan Buddhism|Chán Buddhism]] (Zen is the Japanese transliteration of Chán) uses the semantically related title ''[[sifu]]'' (師父/师父, literally "master father" or "father of masters", or 師傅/师傅, literally "master teacher" or "teacher of masters"; both pronounced "shīfu") as an honorific title for the highest masters, but it also may be used in respectful address of monks and nuns generally.

==Usage==
{{see also|Zen ranks and hierarchy}}

Traditionally, the term  ''rōshi'' has been applied as a respectful honorific to a significantly older Zen teacher considered to have matured in wisdom and to have attained a superior understanding and expression of the [[Dharma]] (Japanese: ''mujōdō no taigen'') . Typically, a ''rōshi'' will have received [[dharma transmission]] (Jap: ''inka shōmei'') many years ago and although often the abbot or spiritual director of a monastery may in fact be too old to carry these responsibilities.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} 

Despite this historical reality, it has come in some modern Zen schools to be applied as a general title for a teacher regardless of the age of the individual who receives it. This is especially true in the United States and Europe where it appears that some confusion has arisen where the word ''rōshi'' has been conflated with the term ''[[oshō]]'', which is the generic term for a Soto Buddhist teacher who has received ''[[Zen ranks and hierarchy#Shihō|shiho]]'' and completed her or his basic training. Historically, the term ''rōshi'' will only be applied to an ''oshō'' after they have given many years of service as a teacher.

===Rinzai===
In some [[Rinzai]] organizations, a monastic is sometimes called ''rōshi'' after they have received ''[[inka shōmei]]'', meaning they have completed ''kōan'' study and received [[Dharma transmission]] from their master;
{{quote|In Rinzai Zen, it is relatively easy to say who is a roshi and who is not. Anyone who is authorized by another roshi (i.e. his teacher) is a roshi. This authorization (officially the "inka-shômei" document) is documented on a piece of paper, that is why it is also called colloquially "ichi-mai", that is "one sheet (of paper)". The transmission is totally vertical from teacher to student, no peer control is involved. That means that the Rinzai sect has no means to control who is made a roshi and who is not. In spite of that, the number of Rinzai roshis is usually less than 100 at any given time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=What is a Roshi?|journal=Buddhadharma: The Practicioner's Quarterly|last=Wenger|first=Michael|year=2002|url=https://www.lionsroar.com/dharma-dictionary-roshi/|accessdate=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Antaiji10 group=web&gt;[http://antaiji.org/english-what-does-it-take-to-become-a-full-fledged-soto-shu-priest-and-is-it-really-worth-the-whole-deal-1/?lang=en Muho Noelke, ''Part 10: What does it take to become a full-fledged Soto-shu priest and is it really worth the whole deal?'']&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

According to roshi Sokun Tsushimoto, the title of ''rōshi'' is equivalent to ''[[Zen master]]'' and ''shike'':&lt;ref name="BD" /&gt;
{{quote|'Roshi' is the title compatible with the most formal title ‘Shike’ who got officially authorized as a Dharma successor by authentic master.&lt;ref name="BD"&gt;[http://boeddhistischdagblad.nl/rients-ritskes-op-beschuldiging-raksu-formeel-uitgereikt-als-bewijs-van-een-competent-zenleader/ Boeddhistisch Dagblad, 17 april 2013, ''Rients Ritskes op beschuldiging: ‘Raksu formeel uitgereikt als bewijs van competent zenleiderschap’''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420011852/http://boeddhistischdagblad.nl/rients-ritskes-op-beschuldiging-raksu-formeel-uitgereikt-als-bewijs-van-een-competent-zenleader/ |date=20 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For more information on Sokun Tsushimoto, see [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/fl20090802x1.html The Japan Times online: Caring for body and soul. Interview with Sokun Tsushimoto]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Sōtō===
In the [[Sōtō]] organization, a person is sometimes called ''rōshi'' after they have received the title of ''shike'', but this is by no means standard practice:
{{quote|There are about 50 or so of these in Soto (the Rinzai roshis can also be addressed as "shike") [...] [T]here is a kind of committee, called the "shike-kai", consisting of all Japanese Soto shike.  There is no foreign shike, as far as I know. The shike-kai can appoint anyone as a shike whom they consider their equal, i.e. who has done genuine training and study, cultivated himself and reached whatever understanding that might be considered enlightened enough to match the enlightenment of the other shike. So shike appointment can be called horizontal in a way.&lt;ref name=Antaiji10 group=web /&gt;}}

===Western Zen===
Many Zen communities in the [[United States]] confer the honorific title of ''rōshi'' to their teachers as a regular title, in deference to perceived Japanese Zen tradition. In most western instances it is used synonymously with the term [[Zen master]], which has a quite specific meaning in Japan, namely the select group of persons who are qualified to supervise the headtemples and monk training halls.&lt;ref name=Antaiji10 group=web /&gt;{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|276}}

In the west, Rinzai and Soto-uses of the term have been mixed:
{{quote|Rinzai Zen came first to the West, so a roshi was understood as someone who was a Zen master with certain credentials. With the introduction of Soto, the emphasis on personal relationship was grafted on, making a complex term that merged the official and legal with the personal and affectionate. To complicate matters further, the Diamond Sangha, the Los Angeles Zen Center and the Rochester Zen Center lineages have combined elements of both modern-day Soto and Rinzai Zen. It’s no wonder there is ambiguity and diversity in the usage of roshi in the West.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.thebuddhadharma.com/issues/2002/winter/dictionary-roshi_winter02.htm Buddhadharma Dictionary: Roshi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121204133920/http://archive.thebuddhadharma.com/issues/2002/winter/dictionary-roshi_winter02.htm |date=2012-12-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the [[Sanbo Kyodan]], a lay organization that combines Soto and Rinzai elements, a person is called ''rōshi'' when they have received ''inka'', indicating they have passed the ''kōan'' curriculum and received Dharma transmission.

==Criticism==
The use of the term ''rōshi'' in the U.S. and Europe has at times led to confusion and controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Ogata, 37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seager, 107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katagiri, 184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gard, 193&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://antaiji.dogen-zen.de/eng/201005.shtml Muho Noelke, ''Ten points to keep in mind about dharma transmission'']&lt;/ref&gt; Stuart Lachs has argued that Zen institutions in the West have often attributed a mythic status to the title ''rōshi'' with harmful consequences.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120316191209/http://www.mandala.hr/5/lachs3.html ''Richard Baker and the Myth of the Zen Roshi'' by Stuart Lachs, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Seungsahn''' ({{korean|hangul=숭산행원대선사|hanja=崇山行願大禪師|rr=Sungsan Haeng'weon Daeseonsa}}, August 1, 1927{{spaced ndash}}November 30, 2004), born '''Duk-In Lee''', was a [[Korean Seon]] master of the [[Jogye Order]] and founder of the international [[Kwan Um School of Zen]]. He was the seventy-eighth Patriarch in his lineage. As one of the early [[Zen_master#Korea|Korean Zen masters]] to settle in the [[United States]], he opened many temples and practice groups across the globe. He was known for his charismatic style and direct presentation of Zen, which was well tailored for the Western audience.

Known by students for his many correspondences with them through letters, his utilization of [[dharma combat]] and expressions such as "only don't know" or "only go straight" in teachings, he was conferred the honorific title of Dae Jong Sa in June 2004 by the Jogye Order for a lifetime of achievements. Considered the highest honor to have bestowed upon one in the order, the title translates "Great Lineage Master" and was bestowed for his establishment of the World Wide Kwan Um School of Zen. He died in November that year at Hwagaesa in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]], at age 77.

==Early life and education==

Seung Sahn was born in 1927 as Duk-In Lee (modern romanisation: ''Yi Deog'in'') in [[Sunchon]] (순천), [[South Pyongan Province]] of [[Korea under Japanese rule|occupied Korea]] (now [[North Korea]]) to [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] parents. In 1944, he joined an underground [[resistance movement]] in response to the ongoing occupation of Korea by the [[Empire of Japan]]. He was captured by Japanese police shortly after, avoided a death sentence, and spent time in [[prison]]. Upon his release, he studied [[Western philosophy]] at [[Dongguk University]]. One day, a [[bhikkhu|monk]] friend of his lent him a copy of the ''[[Diamond Sutra]]''. While reading the text, he became inspired to ordain as a monk and left school, receiving the [[prātimokṣa]] precepts in 1948.&lt;ref name="Ford"&gt;{{cite book| last =Ford| first =James Ishmael| authorlink =James Ishmael Ford| title =Zen Master Who?| publisher =Wisdom Publications| year =2006| location =| pages =99, 100, 101| url =| doi =| id =  | isbn = 0-86171-509-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weishaus"&gt;{{cite web|last=Weishaus |first=Joel |authorlink= |title=Paratext |work= |publisher=[[University of Iowa]] |url=http://www.uiowa.edu/~iareview/tirweb/hypermedia/joel_weishaus/para-1.htm |doi= |accessdate=2008-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222183016/http://www.uiowa.edu/~iareview/tirweb/hypermedia/joel_weishaus/para-1.htm |archivedate=February 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seung Sahn then performed a one-hundred day solitary [[Retreat_(spiritual)|retreat]] in the mountains of Korea, living on a diet of pine needles and rain water. It is said he attained [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] on this retreat.

While seeking out a teacher who could confirm his enlightenment, he found [[Kobong]], who told him to keep a not-knowing mind. In the fall of 1948, Seung Sahn learned dharma combat while sitting a one-hundred day [[sesshin]] at [[Sudeoksa]]—where he was known to stir up mischief, nearly being expelled from the [[vihara|monastery]]. After the sesshin was concluded, he received [[dharma transmission]] (''inka'') from two masters, Keumbong and Keum'oh. He then went to see Kobong, who confirmed Seungsahn's enlightenment on January 25, 1949 and gave him dharma transmission as well. Seung Sahn is the only person Kobong gave Dharma transmission to. He spent the next three years in observed silence.&lt;ref name="prebish"&gt;{{cite book| last =Prebish| first =Charles S| authorlink =| title =Luminous Passage: The Practice and Study of Buddhism in America| publisher =[[University of California Press]]| year =1999| location =| pages =32, 33, 34| url =| doi =| id =  | isbn = 0-520-21697-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cutting edge"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sahn2"&gt;{{cite book| last =Sahn| first =Seung |editor=Hyon Gak | title =The Whole World is a Single Flower| publisher =Tuttle Publishing| year =1992| location =| pages =229–232| url =| doi =| id = | isbn = 0-8048-1782-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

[[File:Dss and gethsemani.JPG|thumb|right|Seungsahn with monks from the [[Abbey of Our Lady of Gethsemani ]]]]
Drafted into the [[Republic of Korea Army]] in 1953, he served as a [[military chaplain|army chaplain]] and then as a [[Captain (armed forces)|captain]] for almost five years, taking over for Kobong as abbot of Hwagaesa in Seoul, South Korea in 1957. In the next decade, he would go on to found [[Buddhist temple|Buddhist temples]] in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Japan]]. While in Japan, he was acquainted with the [[kōan]] (Korean ''gong'an'') tradition of the [[Rinzai school]] of [[Zen]], likely undergoing kōan study with a Rinzai master.&lt;ref name="Ford"/&gt;&lt;ref name="prebish"/&gt;&lt;ref name="batchelor"&gt;{{cite book| last =Batchelor| first =Stephen| authorlink =Stephen Batchelor (author)| title =The Awakening of the West: The Encounter of Buddhism and Western Culture| publisher =Parallax Press| year =1994| location =| url =| doi =| id =  | isbn = 0-938077-69-4| page =222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coming to the United States in 1972, he settled in [[Providence, Rhode Island]] and worked at a [[laundromat]] as a repairman, spending much of his off time improving upon his [[English language|English]]. Shortly after arriving, he found his first students at nearby [[Brown University]], most of whom came by way of a recommendation from a professor there. Among these first students was Jacob Perl ([[Wubong]]), who helped to found the [[Providence Zen Center]] with the others.&lt;ref name="prebish"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cutting edge"&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| title =Coming Empty Handed: Zen Master Seung Sahn in Ann Arbor| work =| publisher =Cutting Edge, American Zen Arts Quarterly| date =Spring 1985| url =http://www.kwanumzen.com/primarypoint/v02n2-1985-spring-dssn-comingemptyhanded.html| doi =| accessdate = 2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Providence Zen Center &amp; Pagoda.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Providence Zen Center]] in [[Cumberland, Rhode Island]].]]
In 1974, Seung Sahn began founding more Zen centers in the United States—his school still yet to be established—beginning with Dharma Zen Center in [[Los Angeles]]—a place where [[Laity|laypeople]] and the ordained could practice and live together. That following year, he went on to found the [[Chogye International Zen Center]] of [[New York City]], and then, in 1977, Empty Gate Zen Center. Meanwhile, in 1979, the [[Providence Zen Center]] moved from its location in Providence to its current space in [[Cumberland, Rhode Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dharmazen.com/center.htm|title=Center|work=DharmaZen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kwan Um School of Zen]] was founded in 1983 and, unlike more traditional practice in [[Korea]], Seungsahn allowed laypersons in the lineage to wear the robes of full monastics. [[Celibacy]] was not required and the rituals of the school are unique. Although the Kwan Um School does utilize traditional Seon and Zen rituals, elements of their practice also closely resemble rituals found often in [[Pure Land Buddhism]], [[Chan Buddhism]], and the [[Huayan school]]. In 1986, along with a former student and Dharma heir [[Dae Gak]], Seungsahn founded a retreat center and temple in [[Clay City, Kentucky]] called [[Furnace Mountain]]—the temple name being ''Kwan Se Um San Ji Sah'' (or, ''Perceive World Sound High Ground Temple''). The center functions independently of the Kwan Um organization today.&lt;ref name="prebish"/&gt;&lt;ref name="strecker"&gt;{{cite book| last =Strecker| first =Zoe Ayn| authorlink =| title =Kentucky Off the Beaten Path, 8th edition| publisher =Globe Pequot| year =2007| location =| pages =106, 107| url =| doi =| id =  | isbn = 0-7627-4201-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Seung Sahn's hermitage.jpg|thumb|right|Seungsahn's hermitage, where he spent most of his final years]]
Over his tenure as Guiding Teacher, Seungsahn appointed many Dharma heirs. He created the title ''Ji Do Poep Sa Nim'' (JDPSN) for those not ready for full dharma transmission but capable of teaching at a higher capacity. In 1977, Seungsahn was hospitalized for [[cardiac arrhythmia]] and it was then discovered that he had advanced [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]]. He had been in and out of hospitals for heart complications for years preceding his death, and in 1987 began spending much less time at his residence in the [[Providence Zen Center]].&lt;ref name="Ho Youn Kwon"/&gt; Starting in 1990, and under invitation from [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], Seungsahn began making trips to the [[Soviet Union]] to teach. His student, Myong Gong Sunim, later opened a practice center in the country (Novgorod Center of Zen Meditation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kwanumzen.spb.ru/about_eng.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020020906/http://www.kwanumzen.spb.ru/about_eng.htm |archivedate=2007-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Teaching style===

Seungsahn implemented the use of simple [[phraseology]] to convey his messages, delivered with [[charisma]], which helped make the teachings easier to consume for [[Western_world|Western]] followers. Some of his more frequently employed phrases included "only go straight" or "only don't know".&lt;ref name="simpkins"&gt;{{cite book |author=Simpkins, C. Alexander |author2=Simpkins, Annellen M. | title =Simple Zen: A Guide to Living Moment by Moment | publisher =[[Tuttle Publishing]]| year =1999| location =| url =| doi =| id =  | isbn = 0-8048-3174-2| page =41}}&lt;/ref&gt; He even went so far as to call his teachings "Don't Know Zen", which was reminiscent of the style of [[Bodhidharma]].&lt;ref name="Seager"&gt;{{cite book| last =Seager| first =Richard Hughes| authorlink =| title =Buddhism In America| publisher =[[Columbia University Press]]| year =2000| location =| url =| doi =| id =  | isbn = 0-231-10868-0| page =172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seungsahn used correspondences between him and his students as teaching opportunities. Back-and-forth letters allowed for a kind of dharma combat through the mail and made him more available to the school's students in his absence. This was another example of his skillful implementation of unorthodox teaching methods, adapting to the norms of Western culture and thus making himself more accessible to those he taught. He was a supporter of what he often termed "together action"—encouraging students to make the lineage's centers their home and practice together.&lt;ref name="prebish2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hayes"&gt;{{cite book| last =Hayes| first =Richard| authorlink =| title =Land of No Buddha| publisher =Windhorse Publications| year =1998| location =| pages =| url =| doi =| id =  | isbn = 1-899579-12-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Joan Halifax and Seung Sahn.jpg|thumb|left|[[Joan Halifax]] with Seungsahn at a [[sesshin]] at the Ojai Foundation in 1979.]]
Seungsahn also developed his own kōan study program for students of the Kwan Um School, known today as the "Twelve Gates". These twelve kōans are a mixture of ancient cases and cases which he developed. Before receiving inka to teach (in Kwan Um, inka is not synonymous with Dharma transmission), students must complete the Twelve Gates, though often they will complete hundreds more. One of the more well known cases of the Twelve Gates is "Dropping Ashes on the Buddha", the Sixth Gate, which is also the title of one of his books. In the book ''[[The Compass of Zen]]'', this kong-an is transcribed as follows: "Somebody comes to the Zen center smoking a cigarette. He blows smoke and drops ashes on the Buddha." Seungsahn then poses the question, "If you are standing there at that time, what can you do?"&lt;ref name="Ford"/&gt;&lt;ref name="seung sahn"&gt;{{cite book| last =Sahn| first =Seung| authorlink =| title =[[The Compass of Zen]]| publisher =Shambhala Publications| year =1997| location =| pages =| url =| doi =| id = | isbn = 1-57062-329-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not included in this version of the kōan is the Kwan Um School of Zen's following side note on the case, "[H]ere is an important factor in this case that has apparently never been explicitly included in its print versions. Zen Master Seung Sahn has always told his students that the man with the cigarette is also very strong and that he will hit you if he doesn't approve of your response to his actions."&lt;ref name="kwan um"&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| title =Seung Sahn's Twelve Gates| work =| publisher =Kwan Um School of Zen| url =http://www.kwanumzen.com/misc/12gates.html| doi =| accessdate = 2008-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Seungsahn first began teaching in the United States, there was an underemphasis in his message on the significance of [[zazen]]. Under advice from some students, however, he soon came to incorporate zazen into the curriculum more frequently. More than a few of his earliest students had practiced Zen previously under the [[Sōtō]] priest [[Shunryū Suzuki]], laying out a convincing argument about how zazen and Zen were seen as inseparable in the Western psyche.&lt;ref name="prebish2"/&gt;

==Later life==
Throughout the 1990s, Seung Sahn made trips to [[Israel]], which led to the 1999 opening of the [[Tel Aviv Zen Center]]. His remaining years were spent in particularly poor health. He had a [[Artificial cardiac pacemaker|pacemaker]] put in his chest in 2000, followed by [[renal failure]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.virtualtourist.com/m/83f37/10267a/|title=VirtualTourist.com ceased operations|website=Members.virtualtourist.com|accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2004, he was given the honorific title ''Dae Jong Sa'' "Great Lineage Master" by the Jogye Order in commemoration of his accomplishments, the highest title the order can grant.
===Death===
Seung Sahn died shortly after on November 30, 2004 at the age of 77 in Seoul, South Korea at Hwagaesa, the first temple where he served as [[Abbot (Buddhism)|abbot]].&lt;ref name="prebish"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kwan um2"&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| title =Zen Master Seung Sahn| work =| publisher =Kwan Um School of Zen| url =http://www.kwanumzen.org/| format =| doi =| accessdate = 2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sahn"&gt;{{cite book| last =Sahn| first =Seung| authorlink =| title =The Compass of Zen| publisher =[[Shambhala Publications]]| year =1997| location =| url =| doi =| id =  | isbn = 1-57062-329-5| page =391}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="prebish3"&gt;{{cite book| last =Prebish| first =Charles S.| authorlink =|author2=Martin Baumann | title =Westward Dharma: Buddhism Beyond Asia| publisher =University of California Press| year =2002| location =| url =| doi =| id = | isbn = 0-520-23490-1| page =183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
{{criticism section|date=November 2012}}
There is a belief that Seung Sahn made too many students Dharma teachers. He also upset some in the [[Jogye Order]] by allowing lay Dharma teachers to wear long robes - while the Korean [[Jogye Order]] also gives the title poep sa (Dharma teachers) to laypeople, long robes are reserved for monks in Korea.&lt;ref name="Ho Youn Kwon"&gt;{{cite book| last =Ho Youn Kwon; Kwang Chung Kim| first =R.

In the beginning of the Kwan Um School of Zen, people became Dharma Teachers rather quickly, mostly out of need in order to run practice. The current requirement is that a person must take the five precepts after at least four days of retreat, or an agreed upon time by the guiding teacher of a Zen Center. To become a Dharma Teacher in Training will take the individual the minimum of two years after taking the five precepts. This also can only be approved of by the guiding teacher. The student will then take the ten precepts. To become a Dharma Teacher, one must complete a minimum of two years of training as a Dharma Teacher in Training that includes a course of study and certain amount of time attending retreats and serving certain practice roles. It takes a minimum of five years after becoming a Dharma Teacher to become a Senior Dharma Teacher and this must be approved by the guiding teacher. At this time, the person will take the sixteen precepts. Receiving inga (inka) only comes when a student has proven satisfactorily in further training sanctioned by a Zen Master and members of the school. Becoming a Zen Master will require the sanction of several Zen Masters in and outside the school.

Seung Sahn was accused of carrying out [[intimate relationship|sexual relationships]] with students secretly while supposedly celibate. The first accusations of sexual relationships between Seung Sahn and students came about in 1988. Sonia Alexander, former director of [[Cambridge Zen Center]], has claimed that Seung Sahn had carried out long-term sexual relationships with a number of his female followers.&lt;ref name="Boucher"&gt;{{cite book| last =Boucher| first =Sandy| authorlink =Sandy Boucher| title =Turning the Wheel: American Women Creating the New Buddhism| publisher =[[Beacon Press]]| year =1993| location =| url =| doi =| id =  | isbn = 0-8070-7305-9| page =226}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist Rick Fields confirms this, writing “the supposedly celibate Korean Zen master Seung Sahn (Seon-sa-nim) revealed long-term relationships with two students.”&lt;ref&gt;How the Swans Came to the Lake: A Narrative History of Buddhism in America, 3rd ed. by Rick Fields. Shambhala 1992) {{ISBN|0-87773-631-6}} pg 364&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sonia Alexander, when questioned about the nature of these relationships Seung Sahn stated that "it wasn't [romantic] love, it wasn't lust."&lt;ref name="Boucher"/&gt; These alleged relationships caused Alexander to end her involvement with the Kwan Um School, believing in retrospect that she had been used over the years only to help build more Zen Centers for the lineage. In addition to Alexander, author [[Sandy Boucher]] spoke with several other women who lived at the Cambridge Zen Center at the time, one of whom said that in her opinion Sonia was very much in the minority in feeling used and that Seung Sahn's affairs had not been hurtful to the women involved. &lt;ref name="Boucher"/&gt; Notwithstanding her reservations, Alexander still has reverence for Seung Sahn, feels her time spent in the school was to her benefit,&lt;ref name="Ford"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boucher"/&gt; and subsequently rejoined the Kwan Um School as a Senior Dharma Teacher in 2011.&lt;ref name="great"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glzc.org/teachers.html |title=GLZC Teachers |author= |website="Great Lake Zen Center" |publisher= |accessdate=18 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923143139/http://glzc.org/teachers.html |archivedate=23 September 2013 |df= }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

According to author [[Timothy Miller]], “the Kwan Um organization has had to struggle with disclosures of controversial sexual conduct on the part of its leader; Seung Sahn was generally understood by his followers to be a celibate monk, and the revelation that he had had affairs with female students caused some members to leave the movement.”&lt;ref&gt;''The 60s communes: Hippies and Beyond'' by Timothy Miller. Syracuse University Press: 1999. {{ISBN|0-8156-0601-X}} pg 112&lt;/ref&gt;

Commenting during this period, Soenghyang (Barbara Rhodes) - now head Zen Master of the Kwan Um School of Zen - said they were "just people learning to live as a community" and their teacher was "just trying to learn the same thing." &lt;ref name="Boucher"/&gt;

Zen Master Seung Sahn did publicly admit the nature of the relationships and did two repentance ceremonies. The Kwan Um School of Zen has since developed and enforced an ethics committee that has very strict guidelines for teacher/student relationships and consequences for unethical behavior of any member of the school.

==Seung Sahn's lineage==

The following list documents Seung-Sahn Haeng-Won's transmission lineage, starting with the Buddha and the First Patriarch.&lt;ref&gt;These charts expand from the basic list in "Zen Master Seung Sahn's Lineage" in: Seung-Sahn, 1997, ''[[The Compass of Zen]]'', edited by Hyon Gak Sunim, Boston: Shambhala Dragon Editions, [[Shambhala Publications]], pages 393–394. {{ISBN|1-57062-329-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The same basic list is online in English at [http://www.kwanumzen.org/about-us/our-lineage/ Kwan Um School of Zen] and in Hangŭl (down to the 76th generation) at [[:ko:조사 (불교)|조사 (불교)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For comparison, see Jinje Seon Sa's lineage chart which is nearly identical with Seung-Sahn's list in ''The Compass of Zen'' down to the 75th master, after which the two lineages split up (to 만공월면 / Man-Gong Weol-Myeon in Seung-Sahn's and to 혜월혜명 / Hyewol Hyemyeong in Jinje's). There are five variations between the Seung-Sahn and Jinje lists: the renderings of the 40th, 43rd, 56th, 65th Masters' names, and the Latin spelling of the 58th's.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Summa Logicae''''' ("Sum of Logic") is a textbook on [[logic]] by [[William of Ockham]]. It was written around 1323.

Systematically, it resembles other works of medieval logic, organised under the basic headings of the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] [[Predicable]]s, [[Category of being|Categories]], [[terminology|terms]], [[proposition]]s, and [[syllogism]]s.  These headings, though often given in a different order, represent the basic arrangement of scholastic works on logic.

This work is important in that it contains the main account of Ockham's [[nominalism]], a position related to the [[problem of universals]].

==Book I. On Terms==
{{ordered list
|list-style-type=lower-roman
|Chapters 1&amp;ndash;17 deal with terms: what they are, and how they are divide into categorematic, abstract and concrete, absolute and connotative, ''first intention'', and ''second intention''.  Ockham also introduces the issue of universals here.
|Chapters 18&amp;ndash;25 deal with the five predicables] of [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]].
|Chapters 26&amp;ndash;62 deal with the [[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]] of Aristotle, known to the medieval philosophers as the ''Praedicamenta''.  The first chapters of this section concern definition and description, the notions of subject and predicate, the meaning of terms like ''whole'', ''being'' and so on.  The later chapters deal with the ten Categories themselves, as follows: Substance (42&amp;ndash;43), Quantity (44&amp;ndash;49), Relation (50&amp;ndash;54), Quality (55&amp;ndash;56), Action (57), Passion (58), Time (59), Place (60), Position (61), Habit (62).
|Chapters 63&amp;ndash;77 onwards deal with the theory of supposition.
}}

==Book II. On Propositions==

{{ordered list
|list-style-type=lower-roman
|On categorical propositions (1&amp;ndash;20)
|On the conversion of propositions (21&amp;ndash;9)
|On hypothetical propositions (30&amp;ndash;7)
}}

==Book III.  On Syllogisms==

===Part I.  On Syllogisms===

{{ordered list
|list-style-type=lower-roman
|On categorical syllogisms (1&amp;ndash;19)
|On modal syllogisms (20&amp;ndash;30)
|On mixed syllogisms (31&amp;ndash;64)
|On syllogisms containing exponible propositions
}}

===Part II.  On Demonstration===

* These 41 chapters are a systematic exposition of Aristotle's [[Posterior Analytics]].

===Part III.  On Consequences===

* The first 37 chapters of Part II are a systematic exposition of Aristotle's [[Topics (Aristotle)|Topics]].  In Part III, Ockham deals with the definition and division of consequences, and provides a treatment of Aristotle's Topical rules.&lt;ref&gt;Boehner p.54&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Ockham a consequence is a [[conditional sentence|conditional proposition]], composed of two categorical propositions by the terms 'if' and 'then'. For example, 'if a man runs, then God exists' (''Si homo currit, Deus est'').&lt;ref&gt;Boehner pp. 54–5&lt;/ref&gt;  A consequence is 'true' when the [[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] implies the [[consequent]]. Ockham distinguishes between 'material' and 'formal' consequences, which are roughly equivalent to the modern [[Material conditional|material implication]] and [[Logical consequence|logical implication]] respectively.  Similar accounts are given by [[Jean Buridan]] and [[Albert of Saxony]].
* Chapters 38 to 45 deal with the [[Theory of obligationes]].
*Chapter 46 deals with the [[Liar paradox|Liar Paradox]]

===Part VI.  On Fallacies (in 18 chapters)===
Part IV, in eighteen chapters, deals with the different species of fallacy enumerated by Aristotle in [[Sophistical Refutations]] (''De sophisticis elenchis'').

*Chapters 2-4 deal with the three modes of [[equivocation]].
*Chapters 5-7 deal with the three types of [[Amphibology|amphiboly]].
*Chapter 8 deals with the fallacies of [[Fallacy of composition|composition]], and [[Fallacy of division|division]].
*Chapter 9 deals with the [[fallacy of accent]].
*Chapter 10 deals with the fallacy of 'figure of speech'.
*Chapter 11 deals with the [[Accident (fallacy)|fallacy of accident]].
*Chapter 12 deals with the fallacy of [[affirming the consequent]].
*Chapter 13 deals with ''[[secundum quid|secundum quid et simpliciter]]''.
*Chapter 14 deals with [[Ignoratio elenchi]] or irrelevant thesis.
*Chapter 15 deals with [[begging the question]] (''petitio principii'').
*Chapter 16 deals with [[Questionable cause|false cause]] (''non-causam ut causam'')
*Chapter 17 deals with the [[Complex question|fallacy of many questions]] (''plures interrogationes ut unam facere'')&gt;
*Ockham ends (chapter 18) by showing how all these fallacies err against the syllogism.

"'''The Critic as Artist'''" is an essay by [[Oscar Wilde]], containing the most extensive statements of his [[aesthetic philosophy]]. A dialogue in two parts, it is by far the longest one included in his collection of essays titled ''Intentions'' published in May 1891. "The Critic as Artist" is a significantly revised version of articles that first appeared in the July and September issues of ''[[Nineteenth Century (periodical)|The Nineteenth Century]]'', originally entitled "'''The True Function and Value of Criticism'''." The essay is a conversation between its leading voice Gilbert and Ernest, who suggests ideas for Gilbert to reject.

==Summary==
The essay sets to collapse the distinction between fine art and criticism cherished by artists and critics such as [[Matthew Arnold]] and [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] - only critical faculty enables any artistic creation at all, while criticism is independent of the object it criticises and not necessarily subject to it. The essay champions contemplative life to the life of action. According to Gilbert, scientific principle of heredity shows we are never less free, never have more illusions than when we try to act with some conscious aim in mind. Critical contemplation is guided by conscious aesthetic sense as well as by the soul. The soul is wiser than we are, writes Wilde, it is the concentrated racial experience revealed by the imagination. Criticism is above reason, sincerity and fairness; it is necessarily subjective. It is increasingly more to criticism than to creation that future belongs as its subject matter and the need to impose form on chaos constantly increases. It is criticism rather than emotional sympathies, abstract ethics or commercial advantages that would make us cosmopolitan and serve as the basis of peace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilde-online.info/the-critic-as-artist-page44.html The Critic as Artist]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Critical Legal Studies Movement''''' is a book by philosopher and politician [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]]. First published in 1983 as an article in the ''Harvard Law Review'', published in book form in 1986, and reissued with a new introduction in 2015, ''The Critical Legal Studies Movement'' is a principal document of the American [[Critical legal studies|critical legal studies movement]] that supplied the book with its title. In the book, Unger argues that law and legal thought offers unrealized possibilities for the self-construction of a more democratic society, and that many lawyers and legal theorists have uncritically surrendered to constraints that undermine their ability to make use of law’s transformative potential. Unger explains how the critical legal studies movement has refined and reformulated the major themes of leftist and progressive legal theorists, namely the critique of formalism and objectivism in legal doctrine, and the purely instrumental use of legal practice and doctrine to advance leftist aims, and in doing so, has identified elements of a constructive program for the reconstruction of society.

==Overview==

Unger sets out to show how contemporary theories of law and society have been constrained by the false belief that law is a necessary expression of certain abstract ideas of social organization, such as democracy or market economy.{{sfn|Unger|2015|pp=83-86}} Unger contends that these modes of social organization do not have any natural, necessary, or inevitable form.{{sfn|Unger|2015|p=103}} Unger begins ''The Critical Legal Studies Movement'' by critiquing formalism and objectivism, the ideas that he believes lie at the root of the necessitarian thinking that blinds us to law's transformative and constructive potential and possibilities.{{sfn|Unger|2015|pp=83-93}} Formalism is the belief that lawmaking differs fundamentally from law application.{{sfn|Unger|2015|pp=79-80}} Objectivism is the belief that authoritative legal materials (statues, cases, accepted legal ideas) embody and sustain a defensible scheme of human association and display an intelligible moral order.{{sfn|Unger|2015|pp=80-81}}

===Chapter 1: The Criticism of Legal Thought===

Unger suggests that applying "extreme criticism" to formalist and objectivist ideas will expose the elements of a constructive program for the reconstruction of society in line with leftist aims.{{sfn|Unger|2015|p=83}} In this chapter he sets forth critiques of objectivism and formalism. His critique of objectivism aims to show that there is no built-in legal structure for a social organization, and that democracy and the market do not have a universal legal language.{{sfn|Unger|2015|pp=83-86}} His attack on formalism shows that existing legal theories claim to achieve "sanctification of the actual"—that is, these theories claim that substantive law and doctrine just happens to coincide with a coherent normative theory about human conduct.{{sfn|Unger|2015|pp=86-90}} Unger explains that such legal analysis is, in reality, pieced together by an endless process of ad hoc adjustments.{{sfn|Unger|2015|p=89}}

Unger explains that the turning point for many critical legal theorists was when they decided to pursue the critical attack on formalism and objectivism to the hilt, at grave risk of "confusion, paralysis, and marginality."{{sfn|Unger|2015|p=93}}

===Chapter 2: From Critique to Construction===

In this chapter, Unger sets forth the constructive outcome of the critiques of formalism and objectivism, namely the practice of "deviationist doctrine" (also called "expanded doctrine"), and the search for alternative institutional forms for basic social institutions, particularly the market and democracy.

Deviationist doctrine, according to Unger, represents an attempt to bridge doctrine with empirical social theory and ideological conflict.{{sfn|Unger|2015|p=96}} Such an expanded form of doctrine fights over the terms of social life, and refuses to accept that established forms of society reflect any practical or psychological necessities.{{sfn|Unger|2015|p=103}} Everything is up for grabs. Such doctrine aims to point out how biased, power-ridden and makeshift legal materials have gained a semblance of necessity that they should not be granted.{{sfn|Unger|2015|p=99}} In brief, deviationist doctrine encourages theorists to transform society by taking an ideal from one part of social life, and extending it into an area from which it had previously been excluded.{{sfn|Unger|2015|pp=99-100}} This has the advantage of allowing the theorist to draw upon a rich collective history of ideas and institutions that have helped to articulate the ideal in the past, and can now be marshaled to defend its extension into a new area of social life.{{sfn|Unger|2015|p=100}}

The search for alternative forms of basic social organization aims to shape social institutions to be more hospitable and nurturing to the context-transcending nature of human beings.  Unger characterizes this search as "the quest for a social world that can better do justice to a being whose most remarkable quality is precisely the power to overcome and revise, with time, every social or mental structure in which he moves."{{sfn|Unger|2015|p=105}} Unger sees this effort as defensible because it pushes the preconceptions of liberal legal and political theory to their natural conclusions.{{sfn|Unger|2015|pp=106-107}}

Unger sketches the various features that the institutional program he proposes should have:
* The program would transform relations between people, a transformation of social life that has been prefigured in the literary and philosophical achievements of 20th century modernism. Under this program, personal relationships would be liberated from the background of social division and hierarchy that has haunted mankind throughout history. Until now, the processes of cultural revolution have been cut off from the struggle over the structure of society.{{sfn|Unger|2015|pp=107-109}} 
* The program would represent an "empowered democracy." Unger points out how existing democracies do not even satisfy the minimal core of the democratic ideal, and he identifies ways to surmount obstacles to empowered democracy.{{sfn|Unger|2015|pp=109-113}} 
* Government should be reorganized to restrain the state without paralyzing its transformative capabilities. The devices that restrain the state in contemporary democracies also serve to deadlock the state.{{sfn|Unger|2015|pp=114-115}}
* The established market system should be destabilized to allow greater access to capital by all, which would disentrench the elites who, by monopolizing privilege, discourage experimentation and hinder economic progress.{{sfn|Unger|2015|pp=115-119}}  
* New rights should be recognized, rights that would protect the interests of all members of society and ensure their ability to participate fully in the political, economic, and moral life of their society.  These rights would include immunity rights, destabilization rights, market rights, and solidarity rights.{{sfn|Unger|2015|pp=119-124}} 
* The program could be summed up as expressing a "superliberalism"—making social life resemble, to some extent, what politics are already like in liberal democracies.{{sfn|Unger|2015|pp=124-125}}

===Chapter 3: Two Models of Doctrine===

In this section, Unger proposes the transformation of existing doctrine that would help to advance the aims of the critical legal studies movement. First, he explains how the ambitions underlying equal protection doctrine could better be achieved by expanding this doctrine so that individuals and institutions are vested with "destabilization rights"—that is, the right to disentrench accumulations of power that serve to inhibit and disempower members of society.{{sfn|Unger|2015|pp=127-143}} Second, he proposes to change the social institutions of contract and property to bring them more in line with principles of solidarity and community.{{sfn|Unger|2015|pp=143-178}}

===Chapter 4: Underlying Conceptions and Broader Implications===

In this chapter, Unger addresses two plausible objections to the program of critical legal studies, and offers his response to them. The objections are, in turn, that it seems merely an accident that we find ourselves in a situation in which we are engaged in the "internal development" of a program such as the one Unger describes, and thus such a program would seem to have no intrinsic authority, since just as easily we could have found ourselves developing a program that leads in another direction. The second plausible objection is that any tradition is inherently ambiguous, and equally compelling arguments could be made for developing the tradition of leftist movements in some other direction.{{sfn|Unger|2015|pp=179-180}}

Unger contends that the program he sets forth is one that has the best chance of harnessing the "negative capability" of human beings—that is, teaching the person "to move within contexts with the dignity of a context-transcending agent." Such a world would be one that more fully reconciles the conflict, felt in every person's life, between the need for self-assertion among other people, and the need to be protected from other people.{{sfn|Unger|2015|pp=181-183}} Furthermore, against the claim that tradition is ambiguous and could be developed in some other direction, Unger argues that his program offers the best chance for making freedom concrete for human beings. Such a program seeks to narrow the gap between our vast transcending capabilities, and the limiting structures in which we live.{{sfn|Unger|2015|p=184}}

===Chapter 5: Another Politics===

Unger concludes ''The Critical Legal Studies Movement'' by describing how his program offers the opportunity to fuse the revolution in the sphere of personal relations, with revolution in the uses of government power and institutional structure.{{sfn|Unger|2015|pp=199-200}} The transformative activity that he urges would take place in several settings: in contributing substantive ideas to the project of a democratic remaking of social life; in the transformation of professional technique in all areas of professional expertise, so that there is less gap between activities that leave social structures unchallenged, and activities that call structures into question, and so that the gap between laymen and professionals begins to wane; and finally, in the setting of law schools, where, by penetrating the specialized study of law, the ideas Unger sets forth have the greatest chance of taking root so that they spread throughout society.{{sfn|Unger|2015|pp=199-204}}

==Reception==

Reviewing the book for the ''New York Times'', Calvin Woodard described ''The Critical Legal Studies Movement'' as an "ambitious and impressive undertaking. It also defies summation. It is a carefully crafted statement with ideas interlocked like a chain-link fence that stretches as far as the eye can see."{{sfn|Woodard|1986}} The central theme of the movement, Woodard explained, is

&lt;blockquote&gt;to remove the constraints and hindrances imposed on individuals by unjust social hierarchy and class, enabling them to develop a new sense of self and to give full and free expression to their innate intelligence and imagination. To Mr. Unger, liberated individuals endowed with dignity, self-respect and equal opportunity are the highest hope of humankind. Collectively, a society of such people would make up a new form of ''empowered democracy'' in which all social decisions would be regarded as political ones...{{sfn|Woodard|1986}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Woodard gave high praise to ''The Critical Legal Studies Movement'', stating that "[w]hether one agrees with Mr. Unger and C.L.S. or not, one cannot fail to be impressed by his high idealism and intelligence,"  but that "I suspect it will be read mostly by the converted and others will not bother. As a result, a whole generation of older readers will miss out on a book that very probably will have enormous influence on the younger generation of law students."{{sfn|Woodard|1986}}

'''''The Range of Reason''''' is a 1952 book of essays by [[Catholic]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]] [[Jacques Maritain]].  The text presents a [[Thomism|Thomist]] philosophy regarding religion and morality. It contains a study of Atheism, titled "The Meaning of Contemporary Atheism", which has had a considerable impact on Catholic views of Atheism.

==Essays==

===On Human Knowledge===
In this essay, Maritain considers [[empiricist]] [[epistemology]]. While he acknowledges that [[sense-data]] plays an important part in human knowledge of the world, he rejects the thesis that the real does not exist or cannot be known, because he believes that the intellect can transcend sensory experience to perceive the [[noumena|noumenal world]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=I6S6dxBhMAIC&amp;pg=PA9 ''Truth matters: essays in honor of Jacques Maritain''],  Jacques Maritain, John G. Trapani, The Catholic University of America Press, 2004, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

===On Artistic Judgement===
Maritain here supports the theory that the [[aesthetic]] carries a "hidden truth", as an expression of the fundamental individuality of the artist.

===The Meaning of Contemporary Atheism===
Maritain introduces various terms to distinguish the beliefs of [[Atheism|atheists]].  These terms are:

*Absolute atheist - one who denies the existence of the god in whom believers actually believe&lt;ref name="Rangep103"&gt;{{cite book|last=Maritain |first=Jacques |title=The Range of Reason|url=http://www2.nd.edu/Departments/Maritain/etext/range08.htm#p103|accessdate=2010-06-23|year=1952}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Negative atheist - one who rejects the idea of God&lt;ref name="Rangep103"/&gt;
*Positive atheist - one who challenges all aspects of God and is an [[Antitheism|antitheist]]&lt;ref name="Rangep103"/&gt;
*Practical atheist - one who claims belief in God, yet whose actions contradict this claim&lt;ref name="Rangep103"/&gt;
*Pseudo-atheist - one who claims atheism, but unconsciously believes in God&lt;ref name="Rangep103"/&gt;
*Real atheist - one who denies the existence of God and follows a pseudo-morality rather than [[Divine law]]&lt;ref name="Rangep83"&gt;{{cite book|last=Maritain |first=Jacques |title=The Range of Reason|url=http://www2.nd.edu/Departments/Maritain/etext/range06.htm#p83|accessdate=2010-06-23|year=1952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Absolute atheist====
The absolute atheist does not lack belief in God, but rather constantly challenges and fights against God.  Those described as such never stop thinking about God in order to liberate themselves from anything that connotes God.&lt;ref name="Rangep96"&gt;{{cite book|last=Maritain |first=Jacques |title=The Range of Reason|url=http://www2.nd.edu/Departments/Maritain/etext/range07.htm#p96|accessdate=2010-06-23|year=1952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Practical atheist====
Practical atheists prefer to be seen as adherents to religious faith for selfish reasons, yet deny the [[gospels]] by lacking concern for the well-being of others.&lt;ref name="Rangep96"/&gt;

====Pseudo-atheist====
The pseudo-atheist believes that he or she is an atheist, but unconsciously believes in God. According to Maritain, the "God" whose existence is denied is not God, but rather a [[being of reason]], a nonexistent entity which he or she has mistakenly labeled as God. Thus, the pseudo atheist actually denies an entity that is self-evidently nonexistent or that necessitates negative consequences for nature or humanity.&lt;ref name="Rangep83"/&gt;

====Real atheist====
The real atheist denies the "God Who is the authentic object of reason and of faith and Whose authentic idea [the atheist's] mind misuses."&lt;ref name="Rangep83"/&gt;  Maritain states the morality of the real atheist is but a false idol of the "separate Good," which is God's morality.&lt;ref name="Rangep83"/&gt;

==Topics covered==
''Unifying Hinduism'' contains 10 chapters.&lt;ref name=uh14&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nicholson |first1=Andrew J. |title=Unifying Hinduism: philosophy and identity in Indian intellectual history |date=2014 |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |location=New York |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LSg0RGmMaTwC |isbn=9780231149877}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Much of the book focuses on the thought of the medieval [[Indian philosophy|Indian philosopher]], [[Vijnanabhiksu]]. The book's central concern is to show that Vijnanabhiksu provided a philosophical synthesis of diverse schools of Indian philosophy, thereby providing a philosophical unification of Hinduism long before the [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|British colonial conquest and rule of India]]. This refutes claims that Hinduism only attained unity (or only was "invented") as a response to colonial influence.

After an introductory first chapter, the next five chapters focus on Vijñānabhikṣu’s philosophical syntheses. Chapter 2, entitled "An Alternate History of Vedanta", sets the stage by tracing the history of [[Bhedabheda|Bhedābheda]] [[Vedānta]], a comparatively neglected tradition that teaches the "difference and nondifference" of [[Brahman]] and the individual self. Vijnanabhikshu's version of this "Difference and Non-Difference" Vedanta is described in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 offers a historical overview of two important non-Vedanta Indian philosophies, the schools of [[Sāṃkhya]] and [[Rāja yoga|Yoga]],
focusing on their views of [[God]], documenting that contrary to widespread views of Sāṃkhya as entirely atheistic, most first millennium Sāṃkhya authors were theists. 
Chapter 5, "Reading Against the Grain of the Samkhyasutras", focuses on a controversial assertion by Vijñānabhikṣu that some Sāṃkhyasūtra verses that explicitly argue against God's existence do not ultimately intend to deny God’s existence, but represent merely a “temporary concession” (abhyupagamavāda) or “bold assertion” (prauḍhivāda). 
Finally, Chapter 6, "Yoga, Praxis, and Liberation", discusses Vijñānabhikṣu’s commentary on [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Patañjali's Yogasūtras]], arguing that Vijñānabhikṣu’s commentaries on Vedānta, Sāṃkhya, and Yoga represent a unified whole.

Chapter 7, "Vedanta and Samkhya in the [[Oriental studies|Orientalist Imagination]]", discusses how Vijñānabhikṣu was diversely viewed by nineteenth-century European scholars, who in some sense can be understood as "intellectual inheritors of Vijñānabhikṣu’s thought".&lt;ref name=uh14/&gt;{{rp|125}}

The next two chapters return to South Asian thought, with Chapter 8 focuses on Indian philosophical [[doxography|doxographies]] (categorizations)
and Chapter 9, "Affirmers (Astikas) and Deniers (Nastikas) in Indian History", providing a history and preferred translation of the two terms [[āstika and nāstika]], which are more often translated as "[[Orthodoxy|orthodox]]" and "[[Heterodoxy|heterodox]]".
The concluding tenth chapter, "Hindu Unity and the Non-Hindu Other", discusses the timing of the unification of Hindu philosophical schools, suggesting that the stimulus was the presence of [[Islam in India|Islam]].

In the ''[[Journal of the American Academy of Religion]]'', Christopher Key Chapple wrote that the author "has created a tour-de-force that puts India’s premodern thinkers in conversation with its postmodern intellectuals".&lt;ref name=chapple12/&gt;{{rp|549}} In particular,
{{quote|Nicholson has created a masterful analysis of how premodern India conceptualized and reflected upon the issues of unity and plurality. Medieval Hindu thinkers set forth a philosophical position that seeks to articulate a coherent worldview without sacrificing the complexity of India’s divergent views and deities. Nicholson demonstrates that this endeavor was not an artificial product of modernist, revisionist hybridity as asserted by [[Oriental studies|Orientalists]] but an authentic autochthonous response to an intricate theological context [and] had a reflexive self-awareness and a level of sophistication commensurate and perhaps even more inclusively complex than those found in the western Christian, Jewish, and Islamic theological traditions.&lt;ref name=chapple12/&gt;{{rp|546–7}}
}}

Also in the ''[[Journal of the American Academy of Religion]]'', Michael S. Allen wrote that the book won Best First Book "for good reason: lucid and accessible... Nicholson’s book offers an excellent model for South Asianists seeking to engage with the wider field of religious studies",&lt;ref name=allen14/&gt;{{rp|879}} while the book "can also be recommended to nonspecialists with interests in religious identity, boundary formation, and comparative theology".&lt;ref name=allen14/&gt;{{rp|883}}  To Allen, "Nicholson has convincingly shown that a process of unification began well before the British colonial period, extending back several centuries at the very least".&lt;ref name=allen14/&gt;{{rp|882}} However, "there is reason to suspect that the beginnings of the process he describes predate the twelfth century.... [which] would in turn call into question the degree to which Islam influenced the process."&lt;ref name=allen14/&gt;{{rp|882–3}}

In ''[[Religious Studies Review]]'', Jeffrey D. Long wrote that the book "sets the record
straight"&lt;ref name=long12/&gt;{{rp|33}} regarding the historical emergence Hinduism, and "promises to change the scholarly conversation on Hindu identity".&lt;ref name=long12/&gt; Long describes the book as "marvelously clear, meticulously researched, and tightly argued", pointing out that the book also 
{{quote|
problematizes or demolishes a number of other oft-repeated truisms of Indian intellectual history, such as that Samkhya was always atheistic, that Advaita is the earliest and truest to the original sources of the systems of Vedanta, and that Vijnanabhiksu... was an unrepresentative thinker of little importance to the Vedanta tradition.&lt;ref name=long12/&gt;{{rp|33}}
}}

In ''[[Sophia (journal)|Sophia]]'', Reid Locklin wrote the book was "somewhat fragmented", with chapters showing marks of prior publication or presentation elsewhere, but that "The cumulative effect is nevertheless very impressive",&lt;ref name=locklin12/&gt;{{rp|332}} and that "Given the enormous scope of its enquiry, the work is relatively concise, very accessible and therefore suitable for the advanced undergraduate or graduate classroom".&lt;ref name=locklin12/&gt;{{rp|332}}

In ''[[Journal of the American Oriental Society]]'', John Nemec wrote that the book's strengths "lie with the larger, theoretical argument Nicholson makes regarding the role of doxography in shaping knowledge",&lt;ref name=nemec10/&gt;{{rp|32}} and that the book
{{quote|is unquestionably a theoretically subtle and thought-provoking treatment of a neglected chapter in the history of Indian philosophy [that] raises important questions about intellectual history and convincingly makes the case for the significance of Vijñānabhikṣu’s writings.&lt;ref name=nemec10/&gt;{{rp|32–3}} 
}}But Nemec was still left "with certain doubts and questions",&lt;ref name=nemec10/&gt;{{rp|32}} such as how our understanding of Vijnanabhiksu's views might change if more of his works were available in translation, and whether premodern Indian philosophers might have been "more aware of their mutual differences than this volume allows".&lt;ref name=nemec10/&gt;{{rp|32}} Despite such doubts, Nemec suggested that the volume would be "of value to medievalists, scholars of Vedānta, Sāṃkhya, and Yoga, and of Indian philosophy more generally, to scholars concerned with colonialism, and even those concerned with [[Communalism (South Asia)|communal relations]] in contemporary South Asia."&lt;ref name=nemec10/&gt;{{rp|33}}

In ''[[Journal of Asian Studies]]'', Tulasi Srinivas wrote that she "found this book very valuable, challenging of my assumptions",&lt;ref name=srinivas12/&gt;{{rp|572}} calling the book "erudite and thought provoking",&lt;ref name=srinivas12/&gt;{{rp|571}} and its argument "powerful, well researched and delivered, and... remarkably persuasive".&lt;ref name=srinivas12/&gt;{{rp|572}} She wondered whether "penetrability"&lt;ref name=srinivas12/&gt;{{rp|572}} between various philosophical schools might be overstated, and how views of Vijnanabhiksu might change if more of his works were available in translation. She regarded the book as having "political ramifications that suggest that the origins of Hinduism are not only the [[Vedas]], as Hindu nationalists claim... nor a product of British colonial rule... as understood by some scholars."&lt;ref name=srinivas12/&gt;{{rp|571}} She also viewed the book as significant for its "broader political and critical claim that Bhedabheda Vedanta is valuable and on par with the better known schools of Indian philosophy".&lt;ref name=srinivas12/&gt;{{rp|572}}

In ''[[Journal of Hindu Studies]]'', David Buchta wrote that the author's position is "clearly and coherently argued and well-supported",&lt;ref name=buchta11/&gt;{{rp|218}} stating that "the balance that Nicholson's analysis offers, correcting exaggerated claims about the colonial invention of Hinduism, is its most important contribution to the study of Hinduism".&lt;ref name=buchta11/&gt;{{rp|218}} Furthermore, Nicholson "shows sensitivity to the political implications of the discussion and the possibility that scholarship supporting the pre-colonial development of a sense of Hindu unity can be co-opted in support of communalism",&lt;ref name=buchta11/&gt;{{rp|218}} and is therefore "careful to emphasise that, while Hindus may have long agreed that a sense of unity exists, the details have just as long been to subject of debate and development".&lt;ref name=buchta11/&gt;{{rp|218}}

In ''South Asian History and Culture'', Kaif Mahmood pointed out that "beliefs" have been only one among many types of religious expression that also include religious art, ritual, and law; Mahmood suggested that Nicholson engaged in "unstated [and debatable] theoretical presumptions that philosophy is identical to religion".&lt;ref name=mahmood12/&gt;{{rp|138–139}} Nicholson's analyses also raise the question, unaddressed by the book, of whether "if what we call Hinduism was invented for the purpose of preserving a particular identity, what was it that was being preserved, if there was no Hinduism before? A weak identity may be strengthened, even refined, but can an identity be invented out of nothing?"&lt;ref name=mahmood12/&gt;{{rp|138}} Mahmood is also concerned that the book fails to discuss or acknowledge a core question related to Vijnanbhiksu's motivation, that is
{{quote|
Did Vijñānabhikṣu create an inclusive classification of Indian philosophy primarily [as propaganda]&lt;!---NB: Although the word 'propaganda' is a strong word, it is appropriate here, because it WAS used by Mahmood, in the sentence just after "fundamentally reconcilable---&gt; to preserve an identity, rather than to state the truth as he saw it? Or, did Vijñānabhikṣu's historical circumstances merely act as catalysts for the elaboration of the fundamentally 'polycentric' nature of Indian philosophy, an elaboration for which conditions had not been ripe earlier – that the schools of philosophy are primarily concerned with different aspects of reality, and hence, fundamentally reconcilable.... This is an important distinction for anyone seriously interested in Indian philosophy and the nature of philosophy in general...&lt;ref name=mahmood12/&gt;{{rp|139}}
}}

In ''Literature and Theology'', Robert Leach wrote that the book was "rich, erudite, challenging, and always interesting [and] it will be very difficult to read this book and retain the notion that the idea of Hinduism was dreamt up, virtually from scratch, in the 19th century".&lt;ref name=leach11/&gt;{{rp|477}} Leach added that
{{quote|
it is not wholly convincing that Vijñānabhikṣu's inclusivist project is categorically distinct from strategies applied by earlier authors whom Nicholson omits from the historical process of unifying Hinduism. Among pre-12th century authors who systematically assembled South Asian intellectual traditions in a conceivably 'proto-Hindu' fashion, and who did so in a context which does not appear to have been shaped by rivalries with Islam, we can count, for example, Bhasarvajna and [[Jayanta Bhatta|Bhatta Jayanta]]. And to these we may add several passages from Puranic works such as the [[Vishnudharmottara Purana|Visnudharmottarapurana]] (e.g. 2.22.128-134) and the [[Agni Purana|Agnipurana]] (219.57c-61).&lt;ref name=leach11/&gt;{{rp|477}}
}}
Leach also found of interest Nicholson's conclusion that "in Classical India nastika principally denoted non-acceptance of 'correct ritual performance' (i.e. heteropraxy), but in late medieval Vedanta came to be understood as the rejection of 'correct opinion' (heterodoxy)",&lt;ref name=leach11/&gt;{{rp|476}} pointing out that "This conclusion can have significant consequences for the debate on the so-called 'Protestantisation' of Hinduism in the 19th century".&lt;ref name=leach11/&gt;{{rp|476}}

In ''[[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries|Choice]]'', R. Puligandla described the book as "clear, analytical, well-documented", recommending that "all scholars and students of Hinduism and Indian philosophy should find this book beneficial and rewarding", although "Nicholson's arguments and conclusions will not persuade some scholars, especially those who hold the view that Hinduism as a unified tradition has existed since ancient times".&lt;ref name=puligandla11/&gt;

In ''Metapsychology'', Vineeth Mathoor described the book as presenting "the history of [the] dialectical relation between Hinduism and the many streams within it [yielding] what it today stands for: tolerance, pluralism and inclusivism", calling the book "path-breaking" and "a must read for scholars of Indian history, Hinduism and south Asian religious traditions".&lt;ref name=mathoor11/&gt;

== Controversy ==
In his book ''[[Indra's Net (book)|Indra's Net: Defending Hinduism's Philosophical Unity]]'', [[Rajiv Malhotra]] quoted and cited numerous ideas from ''Unifying Hinduism'', describing it as an "excellent study of the pre-colonial coherence of Hinduism",&lt;ref name="malhotra14"&gt;{{cite book

However, despite the citations, it was alleged that [[Rajiv Malhotra]]'s work actually plagiarised Nicholson's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.firstpost.com/living/historian-richard-fox-young-accuses-writer-rajeev-malhotra-plagiarism-2331532.html|title=Historian Richard Fox Young accuses writer Rajeev Malhotra of plagiarism|date=2015-07-07|work=Firstpost|access-date=2017-03-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It led to an online controversy without any actual law suit being filed against Rajiv Malhotra.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Rajiv Malhotra Official|title=Columbia University Talk "Hinduphobia in Academia": Rajiv Malhotra|date=2016-04-24|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olQlPZuEWLY|accessdate=2017-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Nicholson, Malhotra stated "I used your work with explicit references 30 times in Indra's Net, hence there was no ill-intention,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://swarajyamag.com/culture/dear-andrew-nicholson|title=Dear Andrew Nicholson..|access-date=2017-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;" and provided with a list of these citations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://swarajyamag.com/culture/nicholsons-untruths/|title=Nicholson's Untruths|access-date=2017-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added that he will be removing all references to Nicholson, replacing them with original Indian sources.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-03-21|title=Rajiv Malhotra|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rajiv_Malhotra&amp;oldid=771345218|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, a re-written version of the debated chapter was posted on the book's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://indrasnetbook.com/changes-chapter-8/|title=Changes to Chapter 8 - Indra's Net|work=Indra's Net|access-date=2017-03-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Hardcastle's publications and articles are based on her research   in cognitive science. She focuses on how and why the brains function and react to certain aspects. An example of this is when she studies whether the function of brains is to 
process information in order to produce adaptive behaviors. Hardcastle focuses her studies and works on the nature and structure of interdisciplinary theories in the cognitive sciences. She has worked to develop a philosophical framework for understanding conscious phenomena responsive to neuroscientific, psychiatric, and psychological data.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artsci.uc.edu/departments/philosophy/fac_staff/byDeptMembers.html?eid=hardcave&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

'''Waris Shah''' ({{lang-pa|{{nq|وارث شاہ}}}} &lt;small&gt;([[shahmukhi]])&lt;/small&gt;, {{lang|pa|ਵਾਰਿਸ ਸ਼ਾਹ}} &lt;small&gt;([[gurmukhi]])&lt;/small&gt;; 1722–1798) was a [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] [[Sufi]] poet of [[Chishti order]], known for his contribution to [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] literature.&lt;ref name=APNA/&gt;

==Background==
Waris Shah was born in [[Jandiala Sher Khan]], [[Punjab region|Punjab]], present-day [[Pakistan]] into a reputed [[Sayyid]] family and was a descendant of [[Sayyid Muhammad Al-Makki]] through his son Sayyid Badruddin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Riaz Al-Ansab |page=684 |editor-first=Sayyid Maqsood |editor-last= Naqvi |publisher=Izhar Sons Printer |date=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father's name was Gulsher Shah and mother's name was Kamal Banu. Waris's parents are said to have died when he was young. Waris spent years in search of the perfect spiritual guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sakhi Sult̤ān Mohammad Najib-ur-Rehman|title=Perfect Spiritual Guide (Murshid-e-Kamil Akmal) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xVxlAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT26&amp;dq=murshid+kamil+akmal&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=murshid%20kamil%20akmal&amp;f=false|publisher=Sultan-ul-Faqr Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waris Shah acknowledged himself to be a disciple of an [[ustad]] from [[Kasur]], namely [[Hafiz Ghulam Murtaza]] from whom he received his education. After completing his education, Waris moved to [[Malka Hans]], a village twelve kilometres north of [[Pakpattan]]. Here he resided in a small room, adjacent to a historic mosque now called Masjid Waris Shah, until his death.&lt;ref name=APNA/&gt;

His mausoleum is a place of pilgrimage today, especially for those in love. The mausoleum complex was completed in 1978 and is a mixture of the Lahore School of Architecture and [[Tughlaq]] Architecture.

== Works ==
Waris Shah is primarily known as the author of ''[[Heer Ranjha]]'' whose verse is a treasure-trove of Punjabi phrases, idioms and sayings. His minute and realistic depiction of each detail of Punjabi life and the political situation in the 18th century, remains unique and the entire poem is an album of colourful and enchanting pictures of life in the Punjab, of varied views but always deeply absorbing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chopra|first1=R M|title=Great Sufi Poets of the Punjab|date=1999|publisher=Iran Society|location=Calcutta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waris Shah was a consummate artiste, a deeply learned person in [[Sufi]] and domestic cultural lore. It is said in history books that the story of romantic love is a poetic expression of the [[mystical]] love of the human soul towards God – the quintessential subject in [[Sufism]] and a recurring theme in both Muslim and [[Hindu mysticism|Hindu]] mysticism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apnaorg.com/poetry/heercomp/ Complete Heer Waris Shah on Academy of the Punjab in North America website] Retrieved 29 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors also suggest that it was Waris Shah's own unrequited love towards a girl named Bhag Bhari that later became the foundation of the poem.

=== Examples ===
Many verses of Waris Shah are widely used in [[Punjab region|Punjab]] in a moral context, for instance:&lt;ref&gt;From the book ''Heer Waris Shah'' (Chatur Singh Jeevan Singh) in [[Gurmukhi]] Punjabi language&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Naa adataan jaandiyan ne, Bhavein katiye poriyan poriyan ji'' (A man never abandons his habits, even if he is hacked to pieces)
* ''Waris rann, faqir, talwar, ghora; Chare thok eh kisse de yar nahin'' (Waris says that woman, begger, sword and horse, these four are never anyone's friends)
* ''Waris Shah faqir di aqal kithe;  eh pattian ishq padhiyan hun'' (It is beyond the wisdom of [[faqeer]] Waris Shah (to write this verse), (But) these lessons are taught by Love)
* ''Eh rooh qalboot da [[dhikr|zikr]] sara nal aqal de mel bulaya ee'' (This entire reference is about Soul meeting with the Divine, Beloved which has been contrived with great wisdom)

== Portrayal in media ==
Waris Shah's life has been fictionalised in Punjabi-language films. A 1964 [[Pakistani]] film titled ''Waris Shah'' featured [[Inayat Hussain Bhatti]] in the title role. Another movie on the life of Waris Shah ''[[Waris Shah: Ishq Daa Waaris]]'' was released in India in 2006 with [[Gurdas Mann]] as Waris Shah.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0892113/ 2006 film ''Waris Shah: Ishq Daa Waaris'' on IMDb website] Retrieved 29 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Punjabi folk love stories in history including [[Heer Ranjha]], [[Sohni Mahiwal]] and [[Mirza Sahiban]] are said to have happened near the banks of ancient [[Chenab River]]. Out of the five rivers of the [[Punjab]], the river Chenab is forever linked and often mentioned in the history books of these folk love tales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1219865/chenab-pakistans-river-of-love |author=Syed Mehdi Bukhari|title=Chenab: Pakistan's river of love (including many pictures of Chenab river)|date=9 December 2015|publisher=Dawn (newspaper)|accessdate=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Platt Jencks''' (August 15, 1927 – January 3, 2007) was an [[United States|American]] [[biochemist]].  He was noted particularly for his work on [[enzymes]], using concepts drawn from [[organic chemistry]] to understand their mechanisms.&lt;ref name="lowenstein"/&gt;&lt;ref name="borman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jencks1997"/&gt;

==Career==

Jencks graduated from [[Harvard College]] in 1947 with a degree in English, and earned a [[Doctor of Medicine]] from [[Harvard University]] in 1951.&lt;ref name="frs" /&gt;  He interned at the [[Brigham and Women's Hospital|Peter Bent Brigham hospital]].  Jencks conducted his first [[postdoctoral research]] for two years with [[Fritz Lipmann]] at [[Harvard Medical School]].&lt;ref name="jencks1997"/&gt;  Jencks was drafted into the Army Medical Corps and was assigned to the Army Medical Service Graduate School at Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington, DC.  He worked with E. L. Durrum and served as the chair of the department of pharmacology.  In 1956–1957, he did a second [[Public Health Service]] [[post-doctoral fellowship|postdoc]] with [[R. B. Woodward]] of the [[Harvard University]] Department of Chemistry.  In 1957, he moved to the new graduate program in biochemistry at [[Brandeis University]].  He became professor emeritus in 1996.

Much of his career focused on reaction mechanisms used by [[enzyme]] [[catalysts]]. He was particularly well known for studies of the reaction of [[nucleophiles]] with [[carbon]]. He proposed that enzymes use ground state destabilization, termed the [[Circe Effect]], to increase the reactivity of their bound substrates.&lt;ref name="pmid16593049"/&gt; Many of these research interests were explored in his influential&lt;ref name="frs" /&gt;{{rp|183}} text ''Catalysis in Chemistry and Enzymology''.&lt;ref name="jencks1987"/&gt; Jencks published close to 400 scientific papers during his career.&lt;ref name="kirsch2010" /&gt;

Jencks was a co-founder of the biannual Winter Enzyme Mechanisms Conference.  He was memorialized at the 20th Enzyme Mechanisms Meeting in St. Pete Beach, Florida, several days after his death.

==Honors and awards==

Jencks was a recipient of the 1962 [[American Chemical Society]] [[Eli Lilly Award in Biological Chemistry]], the 1993 American Society of Biological Chemists Award, the 1995 [[American Chemical Society]] James Flack Norris Award in Physical Organic Chemistry, and the 1996 [[American Chemical Society]] [[Repligen Corporation Award in Chemistry of Biological Processes]]. He was elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] in 1971.&lt;ref name="kirsch2010" /&gt;  Jencks was also a foreign member of the [[Royal Society]]&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt; and a member of the [[American Philosophical Society]].&lt;ref name="richard2009" /&gt;

==Personal life==

Jencks's father, Gardner Jencks, was a pianist and composer.&lt;ref name="jencks1997" /&gt;  Jencks attended the [[Calvert School]], and completed high school from [[St. Paul's School (Brooklandville, Maryland)|St. Paul's School]] near Baltimore.  After his first year at medical school, he did research with [[George Wald]] at the [[Marine Biological Laboratory]] at [[Woods Hole, Massachusetts|Woods Hole]] on lobster shell pigments.&lt;ref name="kirsch2010" /&gt;  At Woods Hole, he met his future wife, Miriam Ehrlich. Jencks was survived by Miriam, his wife of 56 years, children Sara and David, grandson Benjamin, and siblings [[Charles Jencks]] (b. 1939) a landscape architect, [[Penelope Jencks-Hurwitz]], and John Cheetham.

''Zygon'' is sponsored by the [[Institute on Religion in an Age of Science]] and the [[Center for Advanced Study in Religion and Science]].

The name "Zygon" (mod. L., ad. ζυγόν Gr. yoke.), according to the journal founder [[Ralph Wendell Burhoe]], is the Greek term for anything which joins two bodies, especially the yoking or harnessing of a team which must pull together effectively. The Zygon is the symbol of the journal, its aim being to reunite the "split team" of values and knowledge.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

According to the ''[[Journal Citation Reports]]'', the journal has a 2016 [[impact factor]] of 0.617, ranking it 31st out of 41 journals (Q4) in the category "Social Issues".&lt;ref name=WoS&gt;{{cite book |year=2016 |chapter=Journals Ranked by Impact: Social Issues |title=2016 [[Journal Citation Reports]] |publisher=[[Clarivate Analytics]] |edition=Science  |series=[[Web of Science]] |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
