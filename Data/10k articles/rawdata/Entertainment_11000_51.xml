      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4014">'''11 o'clock number''' is a theatre term for a big, show-stopping song that occurs late in the second act of a two-act [[musical theatre|musical]], in which a major character, often the protagonist, comes to an important realization. Examples include "So Long Dearie" from ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]'', "[[Rose's Turn]]" from ''[[Gypsy (musical)|Gypsy]]'', and "Work the Wound" from ''[[Passing Strange]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://newlinetheatre.blogspot.com/2014/11/may-i-have-definition.html "May I Have a Definition?"], The Bad Boy of Musical Theatre blog, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; It was so named because in the days when musical performances would start at 8:30 pm, this song would occur around 11:00 pm.&lt;ref name="playbill"&gt;Ben Rimalower (19 July 2014). [http://playbill.com/news/article/this-time-for-me-the-essential-11-oclock-numbers-324660/print "'This Time For Me': The Essential 11 O'Clock Numbers"]. ''Playbill.com''. Accessed 2015-02-02.  [https://www.webcitation.org/6XNE9XIfA Archived] 2015-03-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the theatre community, there is some debate as to the characteristics of an 11 o'clock number. It often signifies a moment of revelation or change in heart of a lead character, although there are exceptions to this.&lt;ref name="sit down"&gt;[http://www.mtishows.com/news/sit-down-youre-rockin-the-boat-an-unusual-11-oclock-number "'Sit Down, You’re Rockin’ The Boat:' An Unusual 11 o’clock Number"]. ''The Marquee, News and Views from MTI''. Retrieved 23 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The 11 o'clock number is also differentiated from the finale in that it is not the final number in the show, but even this is not considered a requirement by some commenters.&lt;ref name="Musto"&gt;Michael Musto (29 April 2011).

'''''12/12/12''''' (also known as '''''Evil Born''''') is a 2012 American [[horror film]] written and directed by [[Jared Cohn]]. It was filmed in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] and released on December 4, 2012.&lt;ref name="Dread Central"/&gt;&lt;ref name="28 Days Later"&gt;{{cite web|last=Allen|first=Michael|title=Nothing Happens in The Asylum's 12/12/12: A Movie Review|url=http://www.28dayslateranalysis.com/2012/12/nothing-happens-in-asylums-121212-movie.html|publisher=28dayslateranalysis.com|accessdate=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OFDB"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kritik: A Retro Kinski bespricht Evil Born (2012)|url=http://en.ofdb.de/review/232877,557884,Evil-Born|language=German|publisher=Online Film Datenbank|accessdate=May 18, 2015|date=June 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The film begins with a baby, Sebastian, being born. After Sebastian viciously murders the doctors who delivered him, his mother ([[Sara Malakul Lane]]) realizes that there is something seriously wrong with the child (it is later revealed that he is the son of the devil).  Over the course of the movie, Sebastian brutally murders many people and tragedy strikes many others. Mahari ([[Jesus Guevara]]) attempts to steal the baby from Sebastian's birth parents many times and eventually does. He steals Sebastian in order to embrace his evil calling. Police officers attempt to kill Mahari but Mahari and his companions use Sebastian to murder them. The movie ends with all the main characters dead, and their deaths were associated in some way to Sebastian.

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=May 2015}}
''[[Dread Central]]'' called it an "[[The Omen|Omen]]-esque horror flick titled after the date on which its hellspawn will be born".&lt;ref name="Dread Central"/&gt;  Filming the project created controversy in Thailand, in which set photos showing Sara Malakul Lane in costume looking as if pregnant were mistakenly thought to be real, for there are cultural taboos there about unwed motherhood.&lt;ref name="Dread Central"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Foy|first1=Scott|title=The Spawn of Satan Will be Born on 12-12-12 and We Have His Exclusive First Baby Photos|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/36112/the-spawn-of-satan-will-be-born-on-12-12-12-and-we-have-his-exclusive-first-baby-photos/|accessdate=May 18, 2015|publisher=[[Dread Central]]|date=August 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Beautiful Kate''''' is a 2009 Australian [[drama]] film directed by [[Rachel Ward]] and starring [[Ben Mendelsohn]], [[Rachel Griffiths]], [[Bryan Brown]], [[Maeve Dermody]] and [[Sophie Lowe]]. Ward adapted the script from a 1982 novel of the same name by [[Newton Thornburg]]; this was the first novel by Thornburg used for a movie since ''[[Cutter's Way]]'' (1981). The film was shot on location in the [[Flinders Ranges]].

The film premiered in June 2009 at the [[Sydney Film Festival]] and was released in [[limited release]] across Australia on 6 August 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,,25507094-16947,00.html "The Rachel papers"] by Eddie Cockrell, ''[[The Australian]]'' (23 May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Writer Ned Kendall, is returning to the remote and isolated family home inhabited by his sister Sally, to say goodbye to his father, Bruce, who is dying. Ned also brings his fiancée, Toni, who has trouble getting used to the isolation and harshness of rural Australia.

Ned starts reliving memories of his childhood, many involving his beautiful twin sister Kate, and his older brother Cliff. These memories awaken long-buried secrets from the family's past. He begins writing, and his fiancée reads that he had an awkward sexual encounter with Kate, and leaves him without giving him a chance to explain.

Kate continues to entice Ned despite his obvious revulsion, and after a drunken night out with friends, Ned goes for a swim in the family dam. He is joined by Kate, who seduces and subsequently has sex with him on the banks of the dam. Ned shows immediate remorse while Kate remains unperturbed.

After Ned's refusal to have further sexual relations with Kate, Kate instigates a fight between the brothers by suggesting that Ned made unwanted advances towards her. As punishment, Bruce makes Ned accompany Kate to the Christmas dance. During the dance, Ned leaves Kate, and she is left to go home with Cliff. Ned leaves separately and on his way home he finds his sister's dead body in Cliff's crashed car, and then finds that Cliff has hanged himself.

Fearing that Ned will tell Bruce the truth about Kate, Sally reveals that she knew of Ned and Kate's secret. She also reveals that the car's clock stopped on impact of the crash and no one could figure out what took Kate and Cliff so long to get home from the dance. Sally speculates that Kate also had sexual relations with Cliff, who then crashed the car in which Kate died. She tells Ned she believes that Cliff's guilt from his part in Kate's death was multiplied knowing he had committed incest. But Bruce still believes that Kate was an innocent victim, the best of his children, and she doesn't want him shattered with the truth.

Ned then makes amends with Bruce and says that he is sorry for blaming him over Cliff's suicide. He doesn't tell Bruce the truth about Kate and lets him die still believing that Kate was everything he thought she was. Before he leaves, he tells Sally that Bruce died never knowing that she was his greatest achievement.

Don't take it, for Ward's tough-minded and uniquely Australian version of Southern Gothic does reward your perseverance by at last making you care."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/entertainment/film/film-reviews/beautiful-kate/2009/08/06/1249350621643.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1|title=Beautiful Kate|last=Hall|first=Sandra|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=6 August 2009|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Richard Kuipers of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called it "a visually beautiful and emotionally rewarding study of a dying patriarch and his estranged son".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2009/film/reviews/beautiful-kate-1200475010/|title=Review: 'Beautiful Kate'|last=Kuipers|first=Richard|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=21 June 2009|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Megan Lehmann of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' described it as "a provocative slice of Southern Gothic refried Aussie-style".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/beautiful-kate-film-review-93490|title=Beautiful Kate -- Film Review|last=Lehmann|first=Megan|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=10 September 2009|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Frank Hatherley of ''[[Screen Daily]]'' wrote that it is a "handsome and intense love story" that is "awash with Ward's own spiky, brittle dialogue, delivered with relish by her cast".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screendaily.com/reviews/asia-pacific/features/beautiful-kate/5002521.article|title=Beautiful Kate|last=Hatherley|first=Frank|work=[[Screen Daily]]|date=16 June 2009|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Philip French]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote, "The film is well acted but both blunt and awkward."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/aug/01/beautiful-kate-rachel-ward-review|title=Beautiful Kate|last=French|first=Philip|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=31 July 2010|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also writing in ''The Guardian'', Steve Rose rated it two out of four stars and said that it "doesn't do a great deal wrong, but despite broaching taboo subjects, feels too arthouse-by-numbers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jul/29/beautiful-kate-review|title=Beautiful Kate|last=Rose|first=Steve|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=29 July 2010|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sabrina “Brini” Maxwell is a [[fictional character]] created by actor Ben Sander. Described by Guy Trebey of the Village Voice &lt;ref&gt;Guy Trebay in the Village Voice  "[http://www.villagevoice.com/1999-11-09/news/heroine-addiction/]"&lt;/ref&gt; as the "prototypical, pre-feminist, 1960s homemaker", Maxwell has also been described as a composite of [[Doris Day]], [[Mary Tyler Moore]], [[Auntie Mame]], [[That Girl]] and [[Donna Reed]] and came to prominence in the late '90s as the host of her eponymous television show on [[Public-access television]] [[cable TV]] in [[Manhattan]].

==The Brini Maxwell Show==
The pilot for the original show was produced in 1996. The show debuted on [[Manhattan Neighborhood Network]] on January 1, 1998, and aired for five years featuring tips, recipes, entertaining ideas, craft projects, home renovation and interior design schemes. It was produced by Sander’s production company, V.R.U.S.P. Inc., and directed by Sander’s mother, Mary Jane Wells.

In 2001 Sander was contacted by Amy Briamonte, east coast director of development for west coast based Termite Art Productions (now [[Creative Differences Productions]]). Briamonte and Sander developed a pitch for the show for the [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo network]] and received an order for a pilot. The pilot was produced in the summer of 2002 for a show titled Charming, Needs Work. The premise for the show was Maxwell lived in an apartment that she redecorated every week. After Bravo passed on the show Briamonte, Sander and Termite Art pitched it to Stephen Schwartz and Heather Moran, newly named VP’s of programming for the [[Style network]]. The pitch resulted in an order for a 13-episode season

The first season of The Brini Maxwell Show for the Style network was taped in the summer of 2003 with studio production taking place on the main stage at Unitel Studios on west 57th St. in New York City. Location shoots for the season were taped over a period of 6 months in New York City, Los Angeles and Las Vegas. The Brini Maxwell Show debuted on the Style network on Thursday, January 1, 2004 at 9pm.

The second season went into production in the summer of 2004 and debuted in November 2004. The show was cancelled after two seasons. Nevertheless, Brini handled the cancellation with the same grace and style for which she has become well-known. She is still a popular figure in New York City's social circle.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120719173201/http://community.livejournal.com/brini_maxwell/28724.html brini_maxwell: Brini's show has been canceled&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ben Sander==

'''Early Life'''

Ben was born on July 23, 1969, at Boston Lying In Hospital in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] to Peter and Mary Jane. The first seven years of his life were spent in [[Wellesley, Massachusetts|Wellesley]], MA with his father teaching theater at [[Brandeis University]] and his mother alternately keeping house and acting in professional productions in Boston and New York as well as touring with her own one woman adaptation of [[Pride and Prejudice]]. In 1976 the family moved to the small college town of [[Athens, Ohio]], home of [[Ohio University]]. Ben attended elementary and middle school in Athens while his father taught in the graduate theater program there. In 1980 Peter Sander received a [[Pell grant]] and moved the family to [[Cleveland, OH]], where he acted as a [[Dramaturge]] for [[Cleveland Play House|The Cleveland Play House]]. The Playhouse offered Ben his first opportunity to act professionally. He was cast as Bodo in a production of [[Lillian Hellman]]’s [[Watch on the Rhine]]. They returned to Athens in 1981 for two years. In 1983 Peter took a job with The University of Missouri in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] where Ben attended Center Senior High School. Ben performed in high school theatrical productions, but eventually forsook the stage for the costume room becoming the costume designer during his senior year, using his extensive collection of vintage clothing as costumes for the productions that year. After graduating high school in 1987 Sander attended the [[Kansas City Art Institute]] foundations program.

In 2006 the family again moved; this time to [[Hempstead (village), New York|Hempstead, Long Island]], where his father had been hired as the chair for the theater department of [[Hofstra University]]. Ben spent a few years getting his sea legs in [[New York City]], working at various jobs and studying fashion illustration with Veronica Galati. He then applied to, and was accepted into the fashion design program at [[Fashion Institute of Technology]] in 1989. Ben spent four years studying his craft at FIT. Graduating in 1993, he obtained a job at moderate dress house, BGB as an assistant designer. His job was making patterns for the samples. The company reorganized nine months after he was hired and he was let go. After that he worked at a bridal boutique, and two furriers before moving into Manhattan and developing The Brini Maxwell Show for television.

'''Buttermilk''' (1941&amp;ndash;1972) was a [[buckskin (horse)|buckskin]] [[American Quarter Horse|Quarter Horse]]. He appeared in numerous [[Western film]]s with his owner/rider, [[cowgirl]] star [[Dale Evans]].

Buttermilk was ridden by Evans in the 1950s [[television]] series ''[[The Roy Rogers Show]]'' with her husband [[Roy Rogers]] who rode his [[Palomino]], [[Trigger (horse)|Trigger]]. Both horses were extremely popular and became a marketing success with cast iron and plastic replicas, lamps, and dozens of other products purchased by adults and children.

After Buttermilk died in 1972, his hide was stretched over a plaster likeness and put on display at the Roy Rogers and Dale Evans Museum in [[Victorville, California]] (the museum has since been relocated to [[Branson, Missouri]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

[[Image:Carlo Gozzi.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of Carlo Gozzi]]
'''Carlo, Count Gozzi''' ({{IPA-it|ˈkarlo ˈɡɔddzi|lang}}; 13 December 1720 – 4 April 1806)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[playwright]] and champion of [[Commedia dell'arte|Commedia dell'Arte]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Patterson, David Josh, "A Tale of Two Carlos: An Examination of the Ongoing Battle Between the Marginalized and the Privileged as

Exemplified by Carlo Goldoni and Carlo Gozzi During the 18th Century" (2011). All Graduate Theses and Dissertations. Paper 1006.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life ==
Gozzi was born and died in [[Venice]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lees|first=D. Nevile|year=April 1914|title=Carlo Gozzi and the Venetian Drama of the Eighteenth Century|journal=Mask|volume=6|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; he came from a family of minor Venetian aristocracy,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; the Tiepolos.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  At a young age, his parents were no longer able to support him financially, so he joined the army in [[Dalmatia]].&lt;ref&gt;Carlo Gozzi. ''Memoirs''. 2 Vol., trans. John Addington Symonds (London: John C. Nimmo, 1890). 1:249.&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, he had returned to Venice and joined the Granelleschi Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of Literature|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Inc.|year=1995|pages=483|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This society was dedicated to the pursuit of preservation of  [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] literature from the influence of foreign culture; it was particularly interested in saving traditional Italian comedy such as [[Commedia dell'arte|Commedia dell'Arte]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World-wide Encyclopedia and Gazetteer: Compiled and Revised to Date from the Leading Encyclopedias of the World. A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences and Literature, to which is Added Biographies of Living Subjects, One Hundred Colored Maps and Numerous Illustrations, Volume 4|last=Harrison De Puy|first=William|publisher=Christian Herald|year=1908|pages=2877|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works ==
[[Pietro Chiari]] and [[Carlo Goldoni]], two Venetian writers, were moving away from the old style of Italian theatre, which threatened the work of the Granelleschi Society.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1757 Gozzi defended Commedia dell'Arte by publishing a satirical poem, ''La tartana degli influssi per l'anno 1756'', and in 1761 his comedy based on a fairy tale, ''[[The Love for Three Oranges (fairy tale)|The Love for Three Oranges]]'' or ''Analisi riflessiva della fiaba L'amore delle tre melarance'', he parodied Chiari and Goldoni.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Five Tales for the Theatre|last=Gozzi|first=Carlo|publisher=The Chicago University Press|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=1|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To perform his play, he obtained the services of the Sacchi company of players, a Commedia dell'Arte troupe who had been out of work do to the dwindling interest in Commedia dell'Arte after Chiari and Goldoni's efforts.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Their satirical powers thus sharpened by personal vendetta, the play was an extraordinary success, and Gozzi donated his play and the rest of his fairy tales to Sacchi's troupe, which in effect saved the company.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Carlo Gozzi: A Life in 18th Century Venetian Theatre, an Afterlife in Opera|last=DiGaetani|first=John Louis|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=61|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some have called Gozzi the savior of [[Commedia dell'arte|Commedia dell'Arte]] there has been much debate due to the fact that Gozzi wrote out all his scripts and traditional [[Commedia dell'arte|Commedia dell'Arte]] is mainly improvised.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Struck by the effect produced on the audience by the introduction of the supernatural or mythical element,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; which he had merely used as a convenient medium for his satirical purposes, Gozzi produced a series of dramatic pieces based on [[fairy tale]]s. These were hugely popular, but after Sacchi's company disbanded, they were unjustly neglected. Gozzi's fairy tales drew influence from Commedia dell'Arte, and the popularity of them caused a revival of [[Commedia dell'arte|Commedia dell'Arte]] in Italy.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Magic flutes and Enchanted Forests: The Supernatural in Eighteenth Century Musical Theatre|last=Buch|first=David J.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=214|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These fairy tales were much praised by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[August Wilhelm von Schlegel|Schlegel]] brothers, [[E. T. A. Hoffmann|Hoffmann]], [[Anne Louise Germaine de Staël|Madame de Staël]], [[Jean Charles Leonard de Sismondi|Sismondi]] and [[Aleksandr Ostrovsky|Ostrovsky]]; one of these plays, ''[[Turandot (play and character)|Turandot]]'' or ''La Turandotte'', was translated by [[Friedrich Schiller]] and staged by Goethe in Weimar in 1802 with great success. Gozzi was acclaimed throughout most of Europe, but was less esteemed in his own homeland.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In the last years of Gozzi's life he had begun to experiment by producing tragedies with largely comical influences, but these endeavors were met with harsh critical response. He then began to work in Spanish drama, and found minor success before his death.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; He was buried in the church of San Cassiano in Venice.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Personal life ==
He is well known for his feuds with [[Carlo Goldoni]] and [[Pietro Chiari]] between 1756-1762 over the changing style of Italian theatre that was moving away from the masked and improvised styling of [[Commedia dell'arte|Commedia dell'Arte]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

He was the titular protector of Teodora Ricci,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The memoirs of Count Carlo Gozzi|last=Gozzi|first=Carlo|publisher=J.C. Nimmo|year=1890|isbn=|location=|pages=187|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and caused the voluntary exile of Pier Antonio Gratarol, a member of Venetian society whom Gozzi's ''Draghe d'Amore was'' partially based on'','' for having an affair with and ruining the reputation of Ricci.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

His brother, [[Gasparo Gozzi]], was also a well-known writer of the time.

His collected works were published under his own superintendence at Venice in 1792, in 10 volumes.

A number of twentieth-century stage works were inspired by Gozzi's plays. These include treatments of ''[[Turandot (Gozzi)|Turandot]]'' by [[Karl Vollmöller]] and [[Turandot (Brecht)|Bertolt Brecht]], operas based on the same story by [[Turandot (Busoni)|Busoni]], and, more famously, [[Turandot|Puccini]], Prokofiev's ''[[The Love of Three Oranges]]'' and [[Hans Werner Henze]]'s König Hirsch.

{{nihongo|'''''Dance Dance Revolution X2'''''|ダンスダンスレボリューションX2|Dansu Dansu Reboryūshon Ekkusu Tsū}} ('''''DDR X2''''') is a [[music video game]], and a part of the ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]'' series. The arcade version of ''DDR X2'' was revealed by [[Konami]] on November 20, 2009. A sequel to the ''[[Dance Dance Revolution X]]'', X2 began public [[beta testing]] on November 25, 2009. The game was released in Japan and Asia on July 7, 2010, North America on December 31, 2010, and Europe on May 13, 2011

==Development==
[[File:DDR X2.png|thumbnail|''Dance Dance Revolution X2'' in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]]]
The first public location test for ''Dance Dance Revolution X2'' was announced by Konami on November 20, 2009, to be held from the 25th to December 3, 2009 in [[Akihabara|Akihabara, Tokyo]].&lt;ref name="bms-ltannounce"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bemanistyle.com/index.php/news/dance-dance-revolution-x2-location-test-announced-1596|title=DanceDanceRevolution X2 Location Test Announced|date=November 20, 2009|publisher=Bemanistyle|accessdate=27 November 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091123073800/http://www.bemanistyle.com/index.php/news/dance-dance-revolution-x2-location-test-announced-1596|archivedate=23 November 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The location test revealed new features such as a redesigned song selection interface, new adjustable versions of the Sudden and Hidden modifiers, and the ability to adjust these settings and the speed of the arrows in-game using the control buttons on the cabinet. The location test version did not contain an Extra Stage song, but "POSSESSION" was accessible on the build if certain conditions were met.&lt;ref name="bms-x2lt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bemanistyle.com/index.php/news/dancedancerevolution-x2-location-test-1608|title=DanceDanceRevolution X2 Location Test|date=November 25, 2009|publisher=Bemanistyle|accessdate=27 November 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128081254/http://www.bemanistyle.com/index.php/news/dancedancerevolution-x2-location-test-1608|archivedate=28 November 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
*A redesigned [[Cover Flow]]-like song list. This design is based on [[Dance Dance Revolution Universe 3|DDR Universe 3]].
*New "Happy" and "Pro" play modes. Happy mode is designed for beginners, with a simplified interface and reduced song list. Pro is basically the "normal" mode.
*Two new options have been added. The first are HIDDEN+ and SUDDEN+, which are alternate versions of HIDDEN and SUDDEN that can be activated using the up and down buttons on the cabinet. The second is the RISKY option, which gives the player one life bar (like in ENCORE EXTRA STAGE); it is only available when playing SINGLE or DOUBLE mode. If the player missteps, the stage will end and skip to the next stage. This is useful for the players who want to achieve higher scores. In addition, SPEED can also be adjusted using the up and down buttons on the cabinet.
*MARATHON MODE, exclusive for PASELI owners. Players can play up to 7 stages using the PASELI e-money system. Certain CHALLENGE charts for songs are also only available in this mode.
*BATTLE MODE has been removed from the game.
*Step Rating BOO is renamed back to MISS and merged with N.G. ALMOST have been removed entirely.

===Characters===
All characters from the previous game return with new costume. A new character named Rinon is added. Also, Rena from the Hottest Party series makes her first arcade appearance here. There are also seven different-colored Rinons that only make appearances as opposing characters in each song in Replicant-D Action folder. Just like in DDR X, characters can be customized using various accessories.
* Afro
* Alice
* Baby-Lon
* Bonnie
* Emi
* Geisha-Zukin
* Gus
* Jenny
* Julio
* PiX (new)
* Rage
* Rena (new)
* Rinon (new)
* Ruby
* Victory-Concent
* Yuni
* Zero

==Extra Stage==

===Extra Stage===
The Extra Stage system in this game has been changed. The player must obtain performance grade of AA or AAA from the First Stage to a Final Stage to reach Extra Stage. There are no longer songs exclusive to Final Stage that are required to access Extra Stage as with previous versions. The special song available in Extra Stage is '''KIMONO PRINCESS''', but the difficulty ratings of the chart is based on the sum of difficulty ratings and the number of stages on the credit. The list is as follows.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Quantity of stages !! Beginner !! Beginner, Basic !! Beginner, Basic, Difficult !! Beginner, Basic, Difficult, Expert
|-
| 2 || 1 (2 x 0 + 1) to 12 (2 x 6) || 13 (2 x 6 + 1) to 18 (2 x 9) || 19 (2 x 9 + 1) to 26 (2 x 13) || 27 (2 x 13 + 1) to 38 (2 x 19)
|-
| 3 || 1 (3 x 0 + 1) to 18 (3 x 6) || 19 (3 x 6 + 1) to 27 (3 x 9) || 28 (3 x 9 + 1) to 39 (3 x 13) || 40 (3 x 13 + 1) to 57 (3 x 19)
|-
| 4 || 1 (4 x 0 + 1) to 24 (4 x 6) || 25 (4 x 6 + 1) to 36 (4 x 9) || 37 (4 x 9 + 1) to 52 (4 x 13) || 53 (4 x 13 + 1) to 76 (4 x 19)
|-
| 5 || 1 (5 x 0 + 1) to 30 (5 x 6) || 31 (5 x 6 + 1) to 45 (5 x 9) || 46 (5 x 9 + 1) to 65 (5 x 13) || 66 (5 x 13 + 1) to 95 (5 x 19)
|}

The Extra Stage uses Battery Dance Meter; its quantity of lives is 4. The players can choose options for Extra Stage.

===Encore Extra Stage===
To access Encore Extra Stage, the player needs to get AA or better on KIMONO PRINCESS on Expert during Extra Stage. Unlike previous version where the players may choose any song, Encore Extra Stages have been reverted to the style in DDR MAX, where only a specific song can be played. The song is (by default) '''Roppongi EVOLVED''' on Expert. The version of the song is chosen randomly. Players are still able to set options before challenging Encore Extra Stage.

===Replicant D-Action===
For Replicant D-Action, each song has different requirements to access. 
* Pierce The Sky is accessed by passing at least 20 songs in the X2 folder. 
* Sakura Sunrise is accessed by passing at least 2 songs in each song folder (at least 24 songs). 
* Shiny World is accessed by passing 6 courses and 1 drill course. 
* POSSESSION is accessed by getting at least 100 difficulty ratings on CHALLENGE difficulty, and scoring AA or better on Pierce The Sky and Sakura Sunrise on the same difficulty. 
* New Decade is accessed by getting a full combo on 15 different song charts (same songs can have multiple full combos on separate difficulties), and scoring AA or better on Sakura Sunrise and Shiny World on the same difficulty. 
* Anti-Matter is accessed by playing Trial Mode 3 times, and scoring AA or better on Pierce The Sky and Shiny World on the same difficulty. (Note that POSSESSION, New Decade, and Anti-Matter's difficulty depends on what difficulties the player plays on previous songs). 
Scoring AA or better on each song would net a medal.

When the player subsequently earns all six, the player immediately will access the special Encore Extra Stage, '''Valkyrie dimension''' on Expert. The player is forced to play the song immediately, which means the player cannot change options or take a break.

==Music==
There are 83 new songs featured in X2. 17 out of 19 Licensed Songs from ''[[Dance Dance Revolution SuperNova]]'' and 10 out of 13 Licensed Songs from ''[[Dance Dance Revolution SuperNova 2]]'' have been removed due to their licenses expiring. The licensed material from ''[[Dance Dance Revolution X]]'' remains, including tracks from the [[Dancemania]] compilation series, as well as [[A Different Drum]] records. Four classic licensed songs from earlier DDR mixes have also returned in remastered form, along with a special remixed license track. The first location test build contained 14 new songs, plus one secret song, "Possession", which had special conditions required in order to be unlocked.&lt;ref name="bms-x2lt"/&gt; Three additional songs were added on an updated build installed several days after the testing began.&lt;ref name="bms-x2lt-update"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bemanistyle.com/index.php/news/x2-location-test-update-3-songs-added-1613|title=X2 Location Test Update, 3 Songs Added|date=November 29, 2009|publisher=Bemanistyle|accessdate=27 December 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091203105157/http://www.bemanistyle.com/index.php/news/x2-location-test-update-3-songs-added-1613|archivedate=3 December 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010 Japanese Arcade Operators Union expo (AOU2010), Konami showed a newer build of the game. This newer version showcased even more new songs, including additional material from other BEMANI music games.

The final release of the build revealed many new unlocks, special remixes by Konami artists, and song revivals. The licenses include selections by well known Japanese and Western artists. This the very first DDR arcade release to include licenses from the ''Cyber Trance'' series of albums. It is also the first time that [[Super Eurobeat]] tracks have been featured in a DDR game since ''[[Dancing Stage featuring Disney's Rave]]''. Other songs have been ported over from the latest [[PlayStation 2]], [[Wii]], and [[Xbox 360]] DDR releases. There are a total of 444 songs in this game.

One of the new features included in the main game mode is a special "Extra Stage" system. Known as ''Replicant D-Action'', this mode allows players to choose from a set of 6 difficult songs, 3 level 14's (slower songs) and 3 level 17's (faster + tempo change songs). When a player gets rank AA or more one of these songs (any difficulty), they receive a medal for that particular track. When players subsequently earn all 6 medals, they can access the Encore Extra Stage, "Valkyrie dimension" (Expert). "Valkyrie dimension" is known as the first song in the series is harder than the "Extra Stage" despite having one life, let alone the most difficult song in the entire series.

On March 23, 2011, Konami introduced a special promotion called APPEND Festival. This allowed players to unlock 2 special songs for 5 BEMANI games, including ''DDR X2'' and the recently released upgrade version of jubeat knit, ''jubeat knit APPEND''.

Below is a list of songlist changes featured in the final version. A lock indicate that the song must be unlock. A clapperboard indicate a special background videos will be played during the song. However, some of the background videos (mostly from Beatmania IIDX) are actually displayed on the large screen of the background (where the character is dancing) instead of displaying it full screen (mainly because they are considered to be too generic or distracting). A "clapperboard" ('''BG''') will indicate such songs.

'''''Deadline Hollywood''''', also known as '''Deadline.com''' and previously known as news [[blog]] '''''Deadline Hollywood Daily''''', is an [[online magazine]] founded by [[Nikki Finke]] in 2006. Owned by [[Jay Penske]] since 2009, it is a brand of the [[Penske Media Corporation]]. The site is updated several times a day, with [[entertainment industry]] news as its focus.&lt;ref name="deadlineabout"&gt;"[http://www.deadline.com/about-dhd/ About Us – Deadline.com]"&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Finke began writing an ''[[LA Weekly]]'' column series called ''Deadline Hollywood'' in June 2002, and began the ''Deadline Hollywood Daily'' (DHD) blog in March 2006 as an online version of her column.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Finke|first=Nikki|title=Deadline Turns 10 And Celebrates Disruptors: Nikki Finke Looks Back|url=http://deadline.com/2016/05/nikki-finke-deadline-hollywood-10th-anniversary-1201750730/|website=Deadline Hollywood|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|location=United States|date=May 11, 2016|accessdate=May 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, she sold DHD to Mail.com Media for a reported "seven-figure payday", under an agreement by which she would hire an additional writer but remain the site's editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fritz|first=Ben|title=Nikki Finke's Deadline Hollywood Daily is sold to Mail.com|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-ct-deadline24-2009jun24,0,3372246.story|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[tronc|Tronc, Inc.]]|location=[[Los Angeles]]|date=June 24, 2009|accessdate=September 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009, the URL was changed to ''Deadline.com'' and the site's name to ''Deadline Hollywood'', with additional cities planned,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Haber|first=Matt|title=FIXEDJA! Nikki Finke's Deadline Sleeker, Less Daily|url=http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/pressed/2009/09/04/fixedja-nikki-finke/|website=[[Portfolio.com]]|date=September 4, 2009|accessdate=September 4, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318103815/http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/pressed/2009/09/04/fixedja-nikki-finke/|publisher=[[American City Business Journals]]|location=United States|archivedate=March 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; including New York and London. In November 2013, Finke left ''Deadline'' after a year-long disagreement between herself and Penske, who had bought ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', a competing trade magazine and website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kaufman|first=Leslie|title=Nikki Finke Leaves Deadline Hollywood|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/07/business/media/after-year-of-feuding-nikki-finke-leaves-hollywood-website.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|location=[[New York City]]|accessdate=January 1, 2014|date=November 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Death To Spies: Moment Of Truth''''' ({{lang-ru|Смерть шпионам: Момент истины|italic=yes}}) is a [[third-person shooter|third-person]] [[stealth game|stealth]] [[action game|action]] [[PC game]] set during [[World War II]]. Produced by [[1C Company]] along with Russian studio Haggard Games, ''Moment of Truth'' is a sequel to the stealth action ''[[Death to Spies]]''.

==Game Overview==
The game's main character is Semion Strogov, who is a captain in the 4th department of the Soviet counterintelligence service called [[SMERSH]]. SMERSH is an acronym of the [[Russian language|Russian]] phrase ''Smert' Shpionam'', meaning 'Death to Spies', which was the name for a set of counterintelligence departments in the Soviet Army formed during World War II. Semion Strogov is back from his previous missions and must now participate in a series of even more complicated and exciting [[covert]] operations under the code name "Death to Spies: Moment of Truth". The hero possesses all the skills required to accomplish dangerous missions including getting information about the disposition of hostile military and civil units, and assassination of enemy agents and representatives of the [[Wehrmacht]]’s high-ranking officers and espionage. After having undergone some serious retraining, Semion Strogov will have to accomplish various top secret missions. His task is to capture spies, saboteurs and gather information about their actions using unique technologies and devices. The character's [[wikt:forte|forté]] is being able to carry out the operations with maximum stealth, using various techniques which include, but are not limited to: [[picking locks]], stunning or using chloroform on enemies, throwing knives, [[garroting]], [[booby trap]]s: setting traps on dead bodies, doors, etc.

==Game Features==
*Reveals the activities of the mysterious [[SMERSH]] counterintelligence service of World War II,&lt;ref name="Features"&gt;http://www.death2spies.com/?action=smersh_mi&lt;/ref&gt; with missions based on actual historical facts and declassified data on the SMERSH.&lt;ref name="Features"/&gt;
*Stealth action with sneaking, knife throwing, silent elimination of enemies, distracting enemies, picking locks, setting mines and other booby traps, covert observation and surveying.&lt;ref name="Features"/&gt;
*Various World War II era vehicles, including cars and motorcycles.&lt;ref name="Features"/&gt;

==Sequel==
{{main|Alekhine's Gun}}
The third installment in the series was announced in 2010 by [[1C Company]] under the title ''Death to Spies 3: Ghost of Moscow'', which was being developed by Haggard Games.&lt;ref name="1C"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forum.1cpublishing.eu/showthread.php?t=15109 |title=Death To Spies 3 in Development |publisher=1C Company |date=6 October 2010 |accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, 1C Company withdrew from the publishing contract, but  Haggard Games continued developing the title. A crowdfunding campaign was launched on [[Indiegogo]] in 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?id=243597542371781&amp;story_fbid=507396925991840 |title=Facebook - DTS3 Indiegogo |publisher=Haggard Games |date=6 May 2013 |accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another on [[Kickstarter]] in 2014,&lt;ref name="Kickstarter"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/haggardgames/death-to-spies-3 |title=Death to Spies 3: Stealth Action, Hitman meets Splinter Cell |publisher=Kickstarter |date=17 October 2014 |accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; both of which failed. In June 2015, [[Maximum Games]] was announced as the new publisher and developer making it their first in-house game, renaming it to ''[[Alekhine's Gun]]'', which is a reference to the [[Alekhine's gun|chess formation]] of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maximumgames.com/alekhines-gun/ |title=Alekhine's Gun |publisher=MaximumGames.com |accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It saw the light of the day on multiple platforms ([[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]]) on 1 March 2016.

'''Mehmet Ertuğrul Işınbark''' (July 24, 1940 – May 28, 2014), aka '''Mandrake''', was a well-known [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[Magic (illusion)|stage magician]].

==Early years==
He was born in [[Fatih|Fatih, Istanbul]] on July 24, 1940.&lt;ref name="dha1"/&gt; His father was a director at the mint.&lt;ref name="p1"/&gt;

He was inspired by a magic show he had attended at primary school.&lt;ref name="dha1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="c1"/&gt; Since he quickly uncovered the magic trick he observed, he tried to copy it by himself. Skilled in handicraft, he constructed a cardboard box, in which he put torn newspaper and took out pieces of colored paper as a trick. Thus, he could amaze his classmates and his teacher.&lt;ref name="p1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ht1"/&gt;

After a hard search, he found a book titled ''Fenni Eğlenceler'' ("Scientific Entertainments"), from which he learned the finenesses and the secrets of the stage magic art. He began his career in tents set up at special locations during [[Bayram (Turkey)|bayram]]s, the national or religious celebrations in Turkey.&lt;ref name="c1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ht1"/&gt;

At the age of ten, he was invited to perform a magic show during a [[circumcision]] feast, for which he received a fee. In the beginning, his parents were against a career in stage magic, because they wanted him to receive a higher education like his older brother, who became an engineer. However, as he proved that he caould earn money in his job, they agreed. After secondary school, he dropped out and devoted himself to stage magic.&lt;ref name="p1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ht1"/&gt;

As he was gaining wider interest, he asked his older sister, who was a tailor, to make a [[tailcoat]] in black for him, inspired by a photo of the renowned Turkish stage magician [[Zati Sungur]].&lt;ref name="p1"/&gt;

==Stage career==
In 1952, when he was only twelve, Mehmet Ertuğrul Işınbark signed a five–year contract with Fethi Pehlivan, the manager of the renowned singer [[Zeki Müren]]. From then on, he used to perform 7–8 shows every night.&lt;ref name="p1"/&gt; In 1959, he went on his first tour accompanying the famous singer [[Safiye Ayla]]. Later in his career, he went several times around the country visiting many cities, towns and villages.&lt;ref name="p1"/&gt;

As he turned 20, his manager gave him the [[stage name]] "Sihirbaz Mandrake" ("[[Mandrake the Magician]]") after the famous newspaper [[comic strip]], a nickname, with which he became well known in Turkey.&lt;ref name="dha1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="c1"/&gt; He told once that even his wife and his daughter called him with that name at home.&lt;ref name="p1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ht1"/&gt;

His [[magic word]] was "Sim Sala Gala", different from "[[Abracadabra]]" or "[[Hocus Pocus (magic)|Hocus Pocus]]", which other Turkish magicians used. He grew a [[goatee]] just like the renowned magician figure of Abracadabra.&lt;ref name="p1"/&gt;

After he once observed a [[Ventriloquism|ventriloquist]] on the stage, he decided to perform also this type of stagecraft act. He made a puppeteered "dummy", which he called "Cin Ali" ("Ali the Ghost"). Upon his great success in his performance, his manager asked him to continue with ventriloquism only and to quit stage magic. However, he rejected this proposal, retaining magic shows. The number of his performances at different variety show venues increased up to twelve a night. He received more applause than some star singers on the same stage.&lt;ref name="p1"/&gt;

Mandrake was elected Turkish champion of stage magic during a contest in 1965. He established Turkey's first and the only school of stage magic in 1979, with the aim to share his knowledge and skills, and to contribute to the education of young people in the art of stage magic.&lt;ref name="dha1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="c1"/&gt; Many Turkish stage magicians of today were his students.&lt;ref name="ht1"/&gt;

His main characteristic was to invent new magic tricks. Many of his tricks were taken over into related European catalogues.&lt;ref name="p1"/&gt;

==Family life==
In 1958, he met his later wife Süheyla during a feast fair in [[Karagümrük|Karagümrük, Istanbul]]. He returned from his first tour in 1959 with some money in his purse, he married her. The next year, he went into military service in [[Eskişehir]], his wife followed him there.&lt;ref name="p1"/&gt;

Süheyla became [[Magician's assistant|his assistant]] on the stage. At the age of three and half, their daughter Işın began to join them on the stage as well. After his wife retired, their daughter, a bank employee, and her husband assisted Mandrake at the shows.&lt;ref name="p1"/&gt;

Mehmet Ertuğrul Işınbark died of [[heart failure|cardiac insufficiency]] at the age of 73 on May 28, 2014.&lt;ref name="c1"/&gt; He was hospitalized from his summer residence at [[Gelibolu|Gelibolu, Çanakkale]] on May 19. His corpse was transferred to Istanbul on May 29, and he was given a religious ceremony at [[Fatih Mosque]].&lt;ref name="dha1"/&gt;

'''''Festejo''''' (from Spanish 'fiesta') is a festive form of [[Afro-Peruvian music]]. The dance is a staple in the Black coastal populations and it celebrates the emancipation of slaves. Festejo is recognized for its high energy and the improvisation carried out by the dancers. Some believe that its origins trace back to competitive dance circles performed by individuals playing [[cajón]]s. Despite its African origins, people of all different backgrounds participate in the dance that many consider to be one of the greatest representations of Peruvian culture.

'''Fiction writing''' is the composition of non-factual prose texts. Fictional writing often is produced as a story meant to entertain or convey an author's point of view. The result of this may be a [[short story]], [[novel]], [[novella]], [[screenplay]], or [[drama]], which are all types (though not the only types) of fictional writing styles. Different types of [[author]]s practice  fictional writing, including [[novelists]], [[playwrights]], [[short story writers]], [[dramatists]] and [[screenwriters]].

==Categories of prose fiction ==
{{main|Fiction#Categories of fiction}}

===Genre fiction===
A [[genre]] is the subject matter or category that writers use. For instance, [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]] and [[mystery fiction]] are genres. [[Genre fiction]] also known as popular fiction, is plot-driven [[fiction|fictional works]] written with the intent of fitting into a specific [[literary genre]], in order to appeal to readers and fans already familiar with that genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=French|first=Christy Tillery|title=Literary Fiction vs Genre Fiction|url=http://www.authorsden.com/categories/article_top.asp?catid=10&amp;id=18884|work=AuthorsDen|accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genre fiction is storytelling driven by plot, as opposed to literary fiction, which focuses more on theme and character. Genre fiction, or popular fiction, is written to appeal to a large audience and it sells more primarily because it is more commercialised. An example is [[Twilight (novel series)|the ''Twilight'' series]] which may sell more than  [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby Dick]]'', because the "Twilight" novels deal with elements of [[popular culture|pop culture]] – romance and vampires.

===Literary fiction===
[[Literary fiction]] is [[Fiction|fictional works]] that hold [[literary merit]],  that is to say, they are works that offer [[social commentary]], or [[political criticism]], or focus on aspect of the [[human condition]].

Literary fiction is usually contrasted with, popular, commercial, or [[genre fiction]]. Some have described the difference between them in terms of analysing reality (literary) rather than escaping reality (popular). The contrast between these two categories of fiction is [[Western canon#Debate|controversial]] among some critics and scholars.

==Elements of fiction==
===Character===
[[File:American author Jenna Blum photographed by Marcia Perez.jpg|150px|thumb|Author [[Jenna Blum]] described the process of creating a character: "It feels like having a string dangle out of thin air and you pull on the string, and the next thing you know, a sweater knits itself out of nowhere and you have a character who is made out of whole cloth."&lt;ref name=JennaBlum3&gt;Jenna Blum, 2013, ''The Modern Scholar'' published by Recorded Books, ''The Author at Work: The Art of Writing Fiction'', Disk 1, Track 8, {{ISBN|978-1-4703-8437-1}}, “...a character who is made out of whole cloth...”&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''[[Characterization]]''' is one of the five elements of fiction, along with plot, setting, theme, and writing style.  A '''[[fictional character|character]]''' is a participant in the story, and is usually a person, but may be any persona, identity, or entity whose existence originates from a fictional work or performance.

Characters may be of several types:
*'''Point-of-view character''': the character by whom the story is viewed. The point-of-view character may or may not also be the main character in the story.
*'''[[Protagonist]]''': the main character of a story
*'''[[Antagonist]]''': the character who stands in opposition to the protagonist
*'''Minor character''': a character that interacts with the protagonist. They help the story move along.
*'''[[Foil (literature)|Foil character]]''':  a (usually minor) character who has traits opposed to those of the main character

===Plot===
The '''[[plot (narrative)|plot]]''', or storyline, is the rendering and ordering of the events and actions of a story. Starting with the initiating event, then the rising action, conflict, climax, falling action, and ending possibly with a resolution.

Plot consists of action and reaction, also referred to as stimulus and response and has a beginning, a middle, and an ending.

The climax of the novel consists of a single action-packed sentence in which the conflict (problem) of the novel is resolved. This sentence comes towards the end of the novel. The main part of the action should come before the climax.

Plot also has a mid-level structure: scene and sequel. A scene is a unit of drama—where the action occurs. Then, after a transition of some sort, comes the sequel—an emotional reaction and regrouping, an aftermath.

===Setting===
'''[[Setting (fiction)|Setting]]''' is the locale and time of a story. The setting is often a real place, but may be a fictitious city or country within our own world; a different planet; or an alternate universe, which may or may not have similarities with our own universe.  Sometimes setting is referred to as '''[[Social environment|milieu]]''', to include a context (such as society) beyond the immediate surroundings of the story. It is basically where and when the story takes place.

===Theme===
'''[[Theme (literary)|Theme]]''' is what the author is trying to tell the reader. For example, the belief in the ultimate good in people, or that things are not always what they seem. This is often referred to as the "moral of the story." Some fiction contains advanced themes like morality, or the value of life, whereas other stories have no theme, or a very shallow one.

===Style===
[[Style (fiction)|Style]] includes the multitude of choices fiction writers make, consciously or not, in the process of writing a story. It encompasses not only the big-picture, strategic choices such as point of view and choice of [[Narration|narrator]], but also tactical choices of grammar, punctuation, word usage, sentence and paragraph length and structure, tone, the use of imagery, chapter selection, titles, etc. In the process of creating a story, these choices meld to become the writer's voice, his or her own unique style.

For each piece of fiction, the author makes many choices, consciously or subconsciously, which combine to form the writer's unique style. The components of style are numerous, but include point of view, choice of narrator, fiction-writing mode, person and tense, grammar, punctuation, word usage, sentence length and structure, paragraph length and structure, tone, imagery, chapter usage, and title selection.

====Narrator====
The '''[[Narration|narrator]]''' is the story teller. The main character in the book can also be the narrator.

====Point of view====
[[Point of view (literature)|Point of view]] is the perspective (or type of personal or non-personal "lens") through which a story is communicated. Narrative point of view or narrative perspective describes the position of the narrator, that is, the character of the storyteller, in relation to the story being told.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=James McCracken|title=The Oxford English Dictionary |url=http://www.oed.com/|accessdate=October 16, 2011|edition=Online|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tone====
The [[tone (literature)|tone]] of a literary work expresses the writer's attitude toward or feelings about the subject matter and audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Brownstein|1992|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Suspension of disbelief====
'''[[Suspension of disbelief]]''' is the reader's temporary acceptance of story elements as believable, regardless of how implausible they may seem in real life.

==Authors' views on writing==
Ernest Hemingway wrote "Prose is architecture, not interior decoration."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Poore, ''New York Times'', "Hemingway's Quality Built On a Stern Apprenticeship", ?, ?1954, p. ?)&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2016}}

[[Stephen King]], in his [[non-fiction]], part autobiographical, part self-help writing memoir, ''[[On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft]]'', he gives readers helpful advice on honing their craft: "Description begins in the writer's imagination, but should finish in the reader's."{{page needed|date=June 2016}}

==Creative Writing 101: According to Kurt Vonnegut==
[[Kurt Vonnegut]] the author of praised novels ''[[Cat's Cradle]]'', ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]'', and ''[[Breakfast of Champions]]'', has given his readers, from his short story collection, ''[[Bagombo Snuff Box]]'', eight rules on how to write a successful story. The list can be found in the Introduction of the collection.

"Now lend me your ears. Here is Creative Writing 101:

#Use the time of a total stranger in such a way that he or she will not feel the time was wasted.
#Give the reader at least one character he or she can root for.
#Every character should want something, even if it is only a glass of water.
#Every sentence must do one of two things—reveal character or advance the action.
#Start as close to the end as possible.
#Be a sadist. No matter how sweet and innocent your leading characters, make awful things happen to them—in order that the reader may see what they are made of.
#Write to please just one person. If you open a window and make love to the world, so to speak, your story will get pneumonia.
#Give your readers as much information as possible as soon as possible. To heck with suspense. Readers should have such complete understanding of what is going on, where and why, that they could finish the story themselves, should cockroaches eat the last few pages."

'''Garland dancing''' is an [[England|English]] [[dance]] tradition that began in the 19th century in North England's mill towns.

The [[Industrial Revolution]] was centralizing people, bringing rural folk to factory work. As country girls moved to new industrial cities, they brought with them dancing traditions from many [[rural]] areas. Garland dancing was a new combination of familiar movements, made more picturesque by flower-covered garlands. Mill owners encouraged garland dancing as a form of healthful exercise that also brought beauty to company events and town [[parade]]s.

'''''Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.'''''&lt;ref group=fn&gt;The show (and CBS) renders the title as ''Gomer Pyle - USMC''.&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[United States|American]] [[sitcom|situation comedy]] that originally aired on [[CBS]] from September 25, 1964, to May 2, 1969. The series was a [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', and the [[television pilot|pilot episode]] was aired as the [[season finale]] of the fourth season of its parent series on May 18, 1964. The show ran for a total of 150 half-hour episodes spanning over five seasons, first in [[black-and-white]] for the first season, and then in [[color]] for the remaining four seasons. In 2006, [[CBS Home Entertainment]] (distributed by [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]) began releasing the series on DVD. The final season was released in November 2008.

''Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.'' was a hit, never placing lower than tenth in the [[Nielsen ratings]], and ended its run as the second-highest-rated series in the United States. It has enjoyed continued popularity through [[Broadcast syndication|reruns]] and DVD releases. The series was created by [[Aaron Ruben]], who also produced the show with [[Sheldon Leonard]] and Ronald Jacobs. Filmed and set in California (originally set in North Carolina), it stars [[Jim Nabors]] as [[Gomer Pyle]], a naive but good-natured gas station attendant from the town of [[Mayberry]], [[North Carolina]], who enlists in the [[United States Marine Corps]].&lt;ref name=honeyimhome /&gt; [[Frank Sutton]] plays Gomer's high-octane, short-fused [[Gunnery sergeant|Gunnery Sergeant]] Vince Carter, and [[Ronnie Schell]] plays Gomer's friend Duke Slater. [[Roy Stuart (actor)|Roy Stuart]] portrayed Corporal Chuck Boyle, GySgt. Carter's good-natured sidekick. [[Allan Melvin]] played in the recurring role of Gunnery Sergeant Carter's rival, Staff Sergeant Charley Hacker.

==History==
{{See also|The Andy Griffith Show}}

Everett Greenbaum and Jim Fritzell, writers for ''The Andy Griffith Show'', are credited with creating the character of Gomer Pyle. The character was based on an "incompetent" gas station attendant whom Greenbaum met and named after Gomer Cool (a writer) and [[Denver Pyle]] (an actor on ''The Andy Griffith Show'').&lt;ref name=K115&gt;Kelly, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Jim Nabors was cast to play Gomer; he had been performing for a [[Santa Monica]] nightclub, The Horn, when [[Andy Griffith]] discovered him.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jun/02/entertainment/ca-36464|title=Just Like Gomer, Jim Nabors Remains the Optimist|last=King|first=Susan|date=June 2, 2002|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|pages=F-15|accessdate=December 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though originally intended to appear in only one episode, Gomer proved popular, and after appearing in seasons 3 and 4, Nabors was given his own spin-off produced by Aaron Ruben. The [[pilot episode]] of ''Gomer Pyle'' was filmed in 1963 as part of ''The Andy Griffith Show'', but was not aired until 1964, as the [[season finale|finale]] of ''The Andy Griffith Show'''s fourth season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&amp;sql=1:235259 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120720165500/http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&amp;sql=1:235259 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 20, 2012 |title=The Andy Griffith Show: Gomer Pyle USMC |work=[[Allmovie]] |accessdate=December 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1960s had a return to "the more mundane sensibilities of comedy," due to viewers' wishes for television programming to be a "cultural antidepressant." Thus, fantasy and rural-oriented comedies gained popularity and dominated the [[Nielsen ratings]].&lt;ref&gt;Roman, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times Guide to Essential Knowledge'', p. 418&lt;/ref&gt; Like other comedies at the time, ''Gomer Pyle'' was a "deep [[escapism|escapist]]" show; it avoided political commentary and offered viewers a distraction from the [[1960s#Social and political movements|social changes of the 1960s]].&lt;ref&gt;Marc, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Bensman, and Van Dyke p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being a military-themed show and airing during the peak of the [[Vietnam War]], the show never discussed the war.&lt;ref name="Olson"&gt;Olson, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marc &amp; Thompson, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the show focused on "Gomer's innocent simplicity [and] Sergeant Carter's frustration and later concern for Gomer's well-being." This, compounded with the popularity of rural comedies in the 1960s, made the show popular.&lt;ref name="Olson" /&gt; Frank Sutton, who played Carter, also ascribed the show's popularity to its concentration on its two main characters, and the plots being built around their respective personalities.&lt;ref name="Lowry" /&gt; The program remained in the top 10 of the ratings throughout its run—in the top three for all but its third season when CBS moved it from Fridays to Wednesdays.&lt;ref&gt;Farber &amp; Bailey, pp. 401–402&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hyatt, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; Nabors quit because he desired to move to something else, 'reach for another rung on the ladder, either up or down'.&lt;ref name=Gomer&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=CwQVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qwEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2443,3314149&amp;dq=gomer+pyle&amp;hl=en |title=Jim Nabors finished with Gomer |publisher=News.google.com |date=January 31, 1969  |accessdate=November 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''Gomer Pyle'' left the air, Jim Nabors hosted his own [[variety show]], ''[[The Jim Nabors Hour]]'', from 1969 to 1971. As well as showcasing Nabors' singing and rich [[baritone]] voice, the show included comedy sketches that featured Nabors's ''Gomer Pyle'' co-stars Frank Sutton and Ronnie Schell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,844903,00.html |title=Television |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081214145534/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C844903%2C00.html |archivedate=December 14, 2008 |accessdate=December 14, 2008 |date=September 26, 1969 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though told that he should not leave ''Gomer Pyle'', Nabors felt that the show would still be exciting and noted that every character he portrayed in his [[Sketch comedy|sketches]] "turn[ed] out to be Gomer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dkILAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=SlIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4167,166614&amp;dq=the+jim+nabors+hour|title=In Hollywood|last=Scott|first=Vernon|date=October 2, 1969|work=The Bryan Times|accessdate=December 13, 2008|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vehicles in the show were provided by the [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles|Chrysler Corporation]], as opposed to the parent series' vehicles that came from the [[Ford Motor Company]]. Although [[Jeep]]s are also prominent in the show, the brand itself would not become a part of Chrysler until the [[American Motors Corporation|AMC]] buyout that occurred in 1987.

Allan Melvin, who had played Clarence "Doc" Malloy and other antagonists on ''The Andy Griffith Show'', played Sergeant Carter's rival, Staff Sergeant Hacker, for four seasons. Nabors also carried the Gomer Pyle character to fellow CBS series ''[[The Lucy Show]],'' in which he made a cameo appearance in a 1966 episode.

==Premise==
[[File:Jim Nabors Frank Sutton Gomer Pyle 1968.JPG|thumb|Gomer Pyle ([[Jim Nabors]], left) and Gunnery Sergeant Vince Carter ([[Frank Sutton]], right)]]
The premise of ''Gomer Pyle'' is similar to and perhaps inspired by Andy Griffith's movie ''[[No Time for Sergeants#Motion picture|No Time for Sergeants]]'', which was based on the [[Mac Hyman]] [[No Time for Sergeants|novel of the same name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courier-journal.com/article/20090106/FEATURES07/901060330|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120724013832/http://www.courier-journal.com/article/20090106/FEATURES07/901060330|dead-url=yes|archive-date=24 July 2012|title=Andy Griffith mix-up|first=David|last=Inman|work=[[The Courier-Journal]]|accessdate=27 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,650213628,00.html|title=Lovable Gomer Pyle, Andy Griffith both on DVD|first=Chris|last=Hicks|date=December 11, 2006|accessdate=27 January 2009|work=[[Deseret News]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220093959/http://deseretnews.com/article/1%2C5143%2C650213628%2C00.html|archivedate=20 February 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2007/11/13/ira-levin.html?ref=rss |title=Ira Levin, author of Rosemary's Baby, Stepford Wives, dies |date=November 13, 2007 |accessdate=27 January 2009 |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |work=[[CBC.ca]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220145611/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2007/11/13/ira-levin.html?ref=rss |archivedate=February 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Leonard's other shows, ''Gomer Pyle'' was character-driven; the main characters were "accessible" and "engaging," and the supporting characters were often eccentric.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Markoe, and Markoe p. 334&lt;/ref&gt; In the show's pilot episode, Gomer, a gas-station attendant from [[Mayberry]], joins the [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]]. Gomer's naivete immediately exasperates his [[drill instructor#U.S. Marine Corps|drill instructor]], Gunnery Sergeant Carter ([[Frank Sutton]]). Originally situated in Camp Wilson in North Carolina, the setting was moved to the fictional Camp Henderson in California.&lt;ref name="Beck88"&gt;Beck &amp; Clark, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; The show was a [[Wiktionary:fish out of water|fish-out-of-water]] piece, which, like its contemporary ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'', featured rural characters out of their normal settings.&lt;ref name="Walter8"&gt;Davis, Blythe, Winans, Scalese, and Winans p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Browne, p. 331&lt;/ref&gt; Like other comedies of the 1960s, the show avoided political commentary (especially concerning the [[Vietnam War]]) and focused instead on the predicaments that ensued from Gomer's unintentional breaking of the rules or [[Wiktionary:put one's foot in one's mouth|sticking his foot in his mouth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tv.nytimes.com/show/155997/Gomer-Pyle-USMC/overview|title=Gomer Pyle USMC |work=[[The New York Times]] (online)|accessdate=7 December 2008|author=Baseline Studio Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbstvd.com/shows.aspx?showID=35|title=Gomer Pyle - USMC|publisher=[[CBS]]|accessdate=7 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the themes explored were the honesty and "strong family values supposedly inherent in small town life"; according to author [[Gerard Jones]], ''Gomer Pyle'''s basic message was "far simpler than any corporate suburban sitcoms with their lessons in compromise and role-following [...] It said merely that the oldest, most basic, least sophisticated sort of sweetness could redeem even the toughest modern types".&lt;ref name="honeyimhome" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newcomb, pp. 113–115&lt;/ref&gt; Author Elizabeth Hirschman noted that Gomer represented a "uniquely American [[archetype]]"—a "large, powerful man physically" with the "simple, honest nature of a child or animal". She also noted that, like stories with characters of such an archetype, Gomer's trusting nature was often taken advantage of, though in the end he "reaps happiness" because of his innocence.&lt;ref&gt;Hirschman, pp. 73, 75&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Watching ''[[M*A*S*H]]'', Watching America'', media and communications scholar James Wittebols said that ''Gomer Pyle'' illustrated how class differences "supposedly negated or diminished by military training" appeared in military hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Wittebols, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|quote=Gomer's personality might best be summed up by the words "Aw, shucks."|source=''The Andy Griffith Show Book''&lt;ref&gt;Beck &amp; Clark, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[Gomer Pyle]] (played by [[Jim Nabors]]), from [[Mayberry]], North Carolina, is a good-natured and innocent [[Private (rank)|private]] whose naïvete constantly annoys his drill instructor, Sergeant Carter. Eventually, however, his "unquestioning love and trust of the world"&lt;ref name=honeyimhome /&gt; lead those in his platoon to befriend him. His good nature attracts the friendship of women; meanwhile, in so far as Carter's abrasiveness repels women, Gomer is in the position of salvaging numerous social occasions by charming the women whose opinions are important to officers at the Marine base. Gomer was created as a stereotype of a rural American; according to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', he "wears a gee-whiz expression, spouts [[Wiktionary:homily|homilies]] out of a lopsided mouth and lopes around uncertainly like a plowboy stepping through a field of cow dung. He is a walking disaster area."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,837550-1,00.html |title=Success Is a Warm Puppy |date=November 10, 1967 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080127042619/http://time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C837550%2C00.html |archivedate=January 27, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though never promoted beyond [[private first class]] during the show's run, Jim Nabors (who played Gomer) was given an honorary promotion to [[lance corporal#United States|lance corporal]] in 2001 and again to [[corporal]] in 2007 by the Marines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010923064607/http://tv.yahoo.com/news/ap/20010808/099725767900.html|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/news/ap/20010808/099725767900.html|title=Pfc.

"Shazam!" "surprise, surprise, surprise!"). He is also put off by Gomer's expectation that the platoon should be a family, of which Carter is the father figure: As much as Carter wants their working relationship to be temporary, as is common in the military, Gomer expects a life-long friendship, which exasperates Carter. Due to the audience's demand for more family-oriented programming, he eventually revealed his softer side: Carter became a father figure to Gomer as well as his best friend.&lt;ref name="honeyimhome"&gt;Jones, pp. 172–173&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Olson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Beck88" /&gt; Sutton stated that his character was created "[[Wiktionary:out of whole cloth|out of whole cloth]] for the show" and, as the actor played him "by ear," Carter greatly changed during the first season.&lt;ref name="Lowry"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=e4IKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=h0sDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4812,1182940&amp;dq=gomer+pyle|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130124194637/http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=e4IKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=h0sDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4812,1182940&amp;dq=gomer+pyle|dead-url=yes|archive-date=January 24, 2013|title=Gomer Pyle Show Scored Immediately|last=Lowry|first=Cynthia|date=July 29, 1965|work=Ellensburg Daily Record|accessdate=December 6, 2008 |page=4|agency=[[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barbara Stuart]] played his girlfriend "Miss Bunny" for three seasons.

Duke Slater (played by [[Ronnie Schell]]) is Gomer's friend and platoon-mate.

Chuck Boyle (played by [[Roy Stuart (actor)|Roy Stuart]]) is Gomer's corporal. He often serves as Carter's conscience and sticks up for Gomer when Sergeant Carter is annoyed over his mistakes. Stuart debuted in the second season and left the show after the fourth season; Boyle was replaced by Duke Slater as corporal for the final season.

Lou-Ann Poovie (played by [[Elizabeth MacRae]]) is Gomer's girlfriend. She debuts in the third season as a singer for a nightclub, but leaves the job at Gomer's urging to return home to Turtle Creek, North Carolina, and marry her beau Monroe Efford. In a later episode in the same season, she returns to California and reveals that she called the wedding off. At the end of the episode, she reveals that she wants Gomer to be her boyfriend, to the dismay of Carter and Duke. After she loses her job at the nightclub, Gomer finds her a job as a salesclerk at a [[record shop]].

In 1987, some 18 years after ''Gomer Pyle'' finished its broadcast run, [[Stanley Kubrick|Stanley Kubrick's]] film ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]'' was released. In it, the nickname "Gomer Pyle" is derogatorily given to Private Leonard Lawrence (played by [[Vincent D'Onofrio]]) during boot camp, after incurring the drill instructor's wrath (Gunnery Sergeant Hartman played by [[R. Lee Ermey]]) for being unable to turn off his idiot's grin and his perceived incompetence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093058/ IMDb - "Full Metal Jacket" (1987)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark T.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15695">The '''hedonic music consumption model''' was created by music researchers Kathleen Lacher and Richard Mizeski in 1994. Their goal was to use this model to examine the responses that listening to rock music creates, and to find if these responses influenced the listener's intention to later purchase the music.&lt;ref name="Lacher, K. T. 1994"&gt;{{Citation

}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The article begins with a discussion of why the issue of music consumption is important. Music is then explored as an aesthetic product, prior to a discussion of what hedonic consumption is, as well as its origins, and concludes with an in-depth look at the model itself.

==Music consumption==
[[Music]] is consumed in a variety of ways, through the [[radio]], [[television]], and [[internet]], as well as through [[concerts]] and [[performances]].&lt;ref name="Ouellet, J. F. 2007"&gt;Ouellet, J. F. (2007). The purchase versus illegal download of music by consumers: The influence of consumer response towards the artist and music. Canadian Journal of Administrative Sciences, 24, 107-119.&lt;/ref&gt;
North and Hargreaves&lt;ref&gt;North, A. C., &amp; Hargreaves, D. J. (Eds.). (1997). Music and consumer behaviour. The social psychology of music (pp. 268-289). Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested "record buying is perhaps the ultimate behavioural measure of musical preference, involving the purchaser's [[time]], effort, and [[money]]" (p.&amp;nbsp;282). The study of music purchase and consumption was quite limited as of the early 1990s, as only a few academic studies had investigated this topic at that point in time.&lt;ref name="Lacher, K. T. 1994"/&gt; 
 
The impact of illegal [[music downloads]] and [[file sharing]] has again brought the issue of music purchases to the forefront. Much popular press and current academic work is being devoted to this topic. The latest report by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ([[IFPI]]) mentions four academic studies in particular (e.g., Zenter, 2003;&lt;ref&gt;Zentner, A. (2003). Measuring the effect of online piracy on music sales. Journal of Law and Economics, 49, 63-90.&lt;/ref&gt; Liebowitz, 2006;&lt;ref&gt;Liebowitz, S. J. (2006). File sharing: Creative destruction or just plain destruction? Journal of Law and Economics, 49, 1-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Michael, 2006; Rob &amp; Waldfogel, 2006;)&lt;ref&gt;Rob, R., &amp; Waldfogel, J. (2007). Piracy on the silver screen. Journal of Industrial Economics, 55, 379-395.&lt;/ref&gt; that have examined file-sharing as having a negative impact on the record industry. Not all academics believe to be true however, as the Oberholzer &amp; Strumpf (2004) study brought a different viewpoint to this topic in an article published in the prestigious [[Journal of Political Economy]]. These [[Harvard Business School]] professors received considerable media attention with the study's conclusion "the empirical evidence on sales displacement is mixed…the papers using actual file-sharing data, suggest that piracy and music sales are largely unrelated" (pp.&amp;nbsp;24–25).&lt;ref&gt;Oberholzer-Gee, F., &amp; Strumpf, K. (2004). The effect of file sharing on record sales: An empirical analysis. Journal of Political Economy, 115, 1-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music and hedonic consumption==
Hedonic consumption was first introduced as an alternative to the traditional consumer behavior model by in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="Hirschman, E. C. 1982"&gt;Hirschman, E. C., &amp; Holbrook, M. B. (1982). Hedonic consumption: Emerging concepts, methods and propositions. Journal of Marketing, 46, 92-101.&lt;/ref&gt; Conventional [[consumer research]] has traditionally used the black box approach and has historically analyzed the consumption activities of product categories such as package goods and major consumer [[durables]].&lt;ref name="Pucely, M. J. 1988"&gt;Pucely, M. J., Mizerski, R., &amp; Perrewe, P. (1988). A comparison of measures for the purchase and consumption of pre-recorded music. Advances in Consumer Research, 15, 37-42.&lt;/ref&gt; Hedonic consumption focuses on products such as the [[arts]], music, and cultural events such as [[rock concerts]], [[fashion shows]] and [[films]]. These "experience" types of products tend to involve individual preferences that can generate certain [[emotions]], feelings and [[behaviors]].

Music is an [[aesthetic]] product as it often provides an emotional or spiritually moving experience specific to an [[individual]].&lt;ref name="Charters, S. 2006"&gt;Charters, S. (2006). Aesthetic products and aesthetic consumption: A review. Consumption, Markets and Culture, 9, 235-255.&lt;/ref&gt; Holbrook&lt;ref name="Holbrook, M. B. 1982"&gt;Holbrook, M. B. (1982). Mapping the retail market for esthetic products: The case of jazz records. Journal of Retailing, 58, 114-129.&lt;/ref&gt; also states that music is appreciated primarily for its internal essence as opposed to being viewed strictly as an objective product. However, consumer research literature focusing on these types of products often uses the terms "aesthetic" and "hedonic" almost interchangeably. Charters (2006) points out "hedonic consumption is essentially about [[pleasure]]" (p.&amp;nbsp;240),&lt;ref name="Charters, S. 2006"/&gt; and that pleasure is but one aspect of the overall aesthetic experience. He also notes that "[[popular culture]] works may have ‘layers of meaning' for [[consumer]]s" as they may convey symbolic meaning for people in significance or emotion of some type. From a [[retailing]] standpoint, aesthetic products are characterized as having a wide range of [[Product (business)|product]] offerings in the [[marketplace]].&lt;ref name="Holbrook, M. B. 1982"/&gt;

As Hirschman and Holbrook point out, hedonic consumption expands upon the traditional definition of consumer behavior through its inclusion of "the multi-sensory, fantasy and emotive aspects of one's experience with products…including tastes, sounds, scents, tactile impressions and visual images" (p.&amp;nbsp;92).&lt;ref name="Hirschman, E. C. 1982"/&gt; These types of experience-oriented products often involve "[[fun]], amusement, fantasy, [[arousal]], sensory stimulation, and enjoyment" (p.&amp;nbsp;37).&lt;ref name="Pucely, M. J. 1988"/&gt; In addition, hedonic consumption often uses [[ethnic]] background, [[social class]] and [[gender]] to help determine the different consumer emotions and fantasies around a product.&lt;ref name="Hirschman, E. C. 1982"/&gt;

==The origins of hedonic consumption==
The study of the hedonic consumption as an academic field began in the late 1970s. It originated out of different [[behavioral science]] fields, including [[sociology]], [[philosophy]], [[psycholinguistics]], and [[psychology]]. Hirschman and Holbrook considered key contributions to come from two fields of prior academic research. The first was the motivation research of the 1950s, "which focused on the emotional aspects of products and fantasies that the products could arouse and/or fulfill" (p.&amp;nbsp;93).&lt;ref name="Hirschman, E. C. 1982"/&gt; [[Ernest Dichter]] was a key figure in this field of research which was popular from the 1950s to the 1970s. One of the major shortcomings of the early motivation research was the fact that many of its [[clinical studies]] lacked rigor and validity.

Hedonic consumption also owes a big debt to the academic field of product symbolism research.&lt;ref name="Hirschman, E. C. 1982"/&gt; One of the important contributors to this academic field includes Sidney J. Levy, who is now the Coca-Cola Distinguished Professor of Marketing at Eller College of Management at the [[University of Arizona]]. He wrote the groundbreaking article "Symbols for Sale" which first appeared in the July–August 1959 edition of the ''Harvard Business Review''.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, S. J. (1999). Symbols For Sale. In D. W. Rook (Ed.), Brands, consumers, symbols, and research: Sidney J. Levy on marketing (pp. 203-212). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. (Original work published 1959)&lt;/ref&gt; 
Levy observed "consumers buy products and brands not only for so-called functional reasons but for the various ‘symbolic meanings' that their consumption provides" (p.&amp;nbsp;198).&lt;ref name="Rook, D. W. 1999 pp. 197-201"&gt;Rook, D. W. (Ed.). (1999). The symbolic nature of marketing. Brands, consumers, symbols, and research: Sidney J. Levy on marketing (pp. 197-201). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; Another early Levy article "Symbolism and Life Style" was originally published in the December 1963 American Marketing Association's ''Toward Scientific Marketing'' Winter Conference Proceedings. In this article, Levy expanded upon his earlier writings by urging marketers to consider "the sum of an individual's consumption of symbolic goods and services as a 'lifestyle'" (p.&amp;nbsp;199).&lt;ref name="Rook, D. W. 1999 pp. 197-201"/&gt; Levy was interested in the development of a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] that would allow marketers to be able to think more systematically about how to meaningfully fulfill the needs of their individual consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, S. J. (1999). Symbolism and Life Style. In D. W. Rook (Ed.), Brands, consumers, symbols, and research: Sidney J. Levy on marketing (pp. 217-224). Thousand Oaks,CA: Sage. (Original work published 1963)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation==
Hirschman and Holbrook's research in the hedonic consumption field first led Kathleen Lacher to begin to explore music as a hedonic consumption product in the late 1980s. Her goal was to try to understand the factors behind why people bought music.&lt;ref&gt;Lacher, K. T. (1989). Hedonic consumption: Music as a product. Advances in Consumer Research, 16, 367-373.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, she joined forces with Richard Mizerski to conduct an experiment that explored music purchase intentions. These professors proposed a theoretical model they named the "model of music consumption and purchase intention". Their basic premise was that people buy music because of the "experience that the music creates by itself or because music can enhance other experiences, whether it is an individual or shared experiences with others" (p.&amp;nbsp;367).&lt;ref name="Lacher, K. T. 1994"/&gt;

==Model building blocks==
Lacher and Mizerski based their experiments on previous music research that was conducted in the fields of [[music education]] and psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Lacher, K. T. (1989). Hedonic consumption: Music as a product. Advances in Consumer Research, 16, 367-373&lt;/ref&gt; They tested music on four "responses" to see what, if any, had any effect on music purchase intentions.

#''Emotion'' - or the feelings people experience when hearing music, which usually range across a scale extending from rage to [[love]]. Emotion is also considered to be one of the primary factors in [[music appreciation]] as well as a potential factor in the [[purchasing process]].&lt;ref name="Ouellet, J. F. 2007"/&gt; 
#''Sensory'' – music often invokes a raw physical response to move physically or sway to the music. Yingling describes this primal process as "an awareness to the listener's need to either move physically towards or away" from the music source.&lt;ref&gt;Yingling, R. W. (1962). Classification of reaction patterns in listening to music. Journal of Research in Music Education, 10, 105-120.&lt;/ref&gt; 
#''Imaginal'' – This response often involves "images, ''memories'' or situations that music evokes" (p.&amp;nbsp;109).&lt;ref name="Ouellet, J. F. 2007"/&gt; The imaginal response also tends to invoke memories of past events, or to imagine events that could take place in the future.&lt;ref name="Hirschman, E. C. 1982"/&gt;
#''Analytical'' – This response often involves pre-conceived expectations about the music itself. Listeners tend to separate music by identifying of the technical aspects of the music (e.g., [[tempo]], [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]], etc.); type, through music genre (e.g., rock, [[Folk music|folk]], etc.); and intrinsic, through other personalized listener factors (e.g., contemporary, religious, etc.).&lt;ref name="Ouellet, J. F. 2007"/&gt; 
	
Next, these first four inputs link together along a pathway towards music purchase using four additional factors:

&lt;ol start="5"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Experiential response'' – or the experience that one has in becoming absorbed or involved in the music.&lt;ref name="Ouellet, J. F. 2007"/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ''overall affective behavior'' – This is more than just emotion, which "tends to be characterized by short duration intense reactionary episodes attributed to a specific cause.&lt;ref&gt;Zillmann, D. (2003). Theory of affective dynamics: Emotions and moods. In J. Bryant, D. Roskos-Ewoldsen, &amp; J. Cantor (Eds.), Communication and emotion: Essays in honor of Dolf Zillmann (pp. 533-567). Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; Lacher and Mizerski considered the affective domain to capture the various interactions between basic emotions, emotional patterns, as well as [[Mood (psychology)|moods]] and motivations, as well as the previously identified analytical and imagery responses as well.&lt;ref name="Lacher, K. T. 1994"/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Reexperience the music'' – This revolves around the listener's need to want to listen to the music again. The researchers considered this to be a ''key factor'' of music purchase. In other words, the listener is motivated enough to purchase the product in order to control the type of music played, as well as where, when, and with whom the music is experienced in the [[future]].&lt;ref name="Lacher, K. T. 1994"/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Purchase intention'' is the ultimate outcome of the hedonic music consumption model purchase. It should be noted that Lacher and Mizerski hypothesized that each of the first four inputs could also lead directly to any of the factors in the second cluster as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

==The revised significant-paths-only hedonic music consumption model==
Lacher and Mizerski conducted [[experiment]]s with college students to determine if the directly linked relationships they had proposed between these eight factors stayed consistent in ultimately predicting rock music purchases. They picked this music genre as previous research suggested most recorded music was bought by people between the ages of 10 and 25, and that this was the preferred genre of the students in test groups.&lt;ref name="Lacher, K. T. 1994"/&gt;

Lacher and Mizerski found during the course of the tests that their [[hypotheses]] were not as consistent as they had thought, and in some cases, the relationships were not direct. Still they were able to make some general conclusions about why people buy music. They revised their original model to create a significant-paths-only model hedonic music consumption model detailing the revised relationships between the factors. The emotional response was broken down to include six different music dimensions that ranged from calm to exuberant. In short, their end goal was to "foster a systematic system of why people purchase music so we can better understand this important marketplace behavior" (p.&amp;nbsp;375).&lt;ref name="Lacher, K. T. 1994"/&gt; One of the ways that Lacher and Mizerski believed that this hedonic music consumption model might prove helpful in terms of future research was to explain the consumption of other "hedonic" products such as [[books]], movies, [[Play (theatre)|plays]], [[paintings]] and [[sports]] events" (p.&amp;nbsp;377).&lt;ref name="Lacher, K. T. 1994"/&gt;

==Emerging Filmmakers Program==
Launched in February 2008, the Howcast Emerging Filmmakers Program (EFP) offers film students, recent grads, and up-and-coming filmmakers the chance to gain experience, exposure, and some extra income by creating short how-to videos distributed across online, mobile, and offline platforms. Provided with the guidance of Howcast producers, filmmakers are encouraged to flex their creative muscles while building their professional reels and launching their online careers. Filmmakers choose from ready-to-shoot scripts in numerous categories. Each script includes pre-recorded voiceovers, animated graphics, and music tracks so that filmmakers can focus on the creative aspects of shooting and editing their videos. Every accepted video earns a stipend of $50 and if a video is a success on Howcast.com, there are opportunities for revenue sharing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Emerging Filmmakers Program at Howcast Studios| work =| publisher =Howcast.com| date =| url =http://info.howcast.com/filmmakers| doi =| accessdate =2009-11-30| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20091202130325/http://info.howcast.com/filmmakers| archivedate =2009-12-02| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since many filmmakers in the program are film students, the EFP has partnered with film and television programs at [[Boston University]], [[Flashpoint Academy]], and [[Charles Sturt University]] to expose students to Web-video production, increase student awareness of opportunities online, as well as provide real-world experience working for clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Film School Partnerships| work =| publisher =Howcast.com| date =| url =http://info.howcast.com/filmmakers/school| doi =| accessdate =2009-11-30| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20091207131108/http://info.howcast.com/filmmakers/school| archivedate =2009-12-07| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hugo: Jungle Island''''' is a defunct [[interactive television]] program that was an improved replacement to the early 1990s' original children's game show in the [[Hugo (franchise)|''Hugo'' franchise]]. It was originally launched by [[ITE Media]] in Denmark  as ''Hugo Vulkanøen'' in January 1999, and was promptly licensed and broadcast in many other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ite.dk/ite/frame/start3.htm |title=Interactive Television Entertainment |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010429153917/http://www.ite.dk/ite/frame/start3.htm |archivedate=April 29, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this scenario, the evil nemesis of the friendly troll [[Hugo (troll)|Hugo]], the witch Scylla (Afskylia in the original Danish version), has returned and moved to a jungle island where she teamed up with the local tyrant Don Croco. Scylla once again kidnapped Hugo's wife Hugolina and the children, but this time she keeps them captive in a cage in her new lair, located at a top of volcano in the center of the island. The players control Hugo, aided by the monkey Jean Paul and the toucan Ferdinand, as he needs to complete a series [[minigame]]s ("hugocopter", ostrich jockey ride, liana climbing, volcano lava chase, etc.) to reach and defeat the witch and free his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ite.dk/?content=jungleTV.htm |title=ITE |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218235919/http://www.ite.dk/?content=jungleTV.htm |archivedate=February 18, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of two video games based on it were released by ITE Media for the PC adaptation in 1999-2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hugoswelt.de/games/dschungelinsel/hugo7/index.php|title=Hugo 7 - Dschungelinsel|author=Nico Schimmelpfennig}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hugoswelt.de/games/dschungelinsel/hugo8/index.php|title=Hugo 8 - Dschungelinsel 2|author=Nico Schimmelpfennig}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bibliotek.dk/da/work/870970-basis:22591630|title=Hugo - Vulkanøen - bibliotek.dk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bibliotek.dk/da/work/870970-basis:23240041|title=Hugo - Vulkanøen 2 - bibliotek.dk}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by a third game in 2004.&lt;ref name=pdf/&gt; They were released under localized titles in various countries (such as ''Dschungelinsel'' in Germany and ''Tropikalna Wyspa'' in Poland).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gry-online.pl/S016.asp?ID=127|title=Hugo: Tropikalna Wyspa, Hugo: Jungle Island (PC) - GRY-Online.pl|work=GRY-Online.pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Hugo: Jungle Island'' game series was generally well received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesector.dk/2000/11/13/hugo-vulkanoen-2/|title=Hugo Vulkanøen 2|publisher=Gamesector.dk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gry.wp.pl/recenzja/hugo-tropikalna-wyspa,220,1.html|title=Hugo: Tropikalna Wyspa|author=Grupa Wirtualna Polska|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gry-online.pl/S020.asp?ID=246|title=Hugo: Tropikalna Wyspa - recenzja gry|date=1 March 2001|work=GRY-Online.pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first two games reached the top of PC sales charts in Turkey.&lt;ref name=pdf/&gt;

In human information processing research, the sentence has been used to show how readers depend on punctuation to give sentences meaning, especially in the context of scanning across lines of text.&lt;ref name="Velde"&gt;{{cite book

 | edition = Illustrated

 | publisher = [[Walter de Gruyter]]
 | isbn = 3-11-013250-8
 | page = 43
 | quote = In scanning across lines, readers also make use of the information parts carried along with the punctuation {{sic|markes}}: a period, a dash, a colon, a semicolon or a comma may signal different degrees of integration/separation between the groupings.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sentence is sometimes presented as a puzzle, where the solver must add the punctuation.

It refers to two students, James and John, required by an English test to describe a man who had suffered from a cold in the past. John writes "The man had a cold", which the teacher marks incorrect, while James writes the correct "The man had had a cold". Since James' answer was right, it had had a better effect on the teacher.

The sentence is much easier to understand with added punctuation and emphasis:
'''{{quote|James, while John had had "{{em|had}}", had had "{{em|had had}}"; "{{em|had had}}" had had a better effect on the teacher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icpc.amrita.ac.in/2006/Problems-Onsite.pdf "Problem C: Operator Jumble"]. 31st ACM International Collegiate Programming Conference, 2006–2007.&lt;/ref&gt;}}'''

In each of the five "had had" word pairs in the above sentence, the first of the pair is in the [[past perfect]] form.  The italicized instances denote emphasis of [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], focusing on the differences in the students' answers, then finally identifying the correct one.

==Usage==
The sentence can be given as a grammatical puzzle&lt;ref name="GADFLY"&gt;{{cite news

 | publisher = [[Routledge]]
 | isbn = 0-415-23170-1
 | page = 123
 | quote = Finally, verbal humour is often an ingredient of puzzles. As part of an advertising campaign for its educational website &amp;lt;learn.co.uk&gt;, the ''Guardian'' (for 3 january 2001) included the following familiar grammatical puzzle.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="acmicpc"&gt;[http://acmicpc-live-archive.uva.es/nuevoportal/data/problem.php?p=3802 3802 - Operator Jumble] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013133154/http://acmicpc-live-archive.uva.es/nuevoportal/data/problem.php?p=3802 |date=13 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or an item on a test,&lt;ref name="Magonet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dundes"/&gt; for which one must find the proper [[punctuation]] to give it meaning.  [[Hans Reichenbach]] used a similar sentence in 1947 as an exercise to the reader ("John where Jack..."), to illustrate the different levels of language, namely [[object language]] and [[metalanguage]].&lt;ref name="Reichenbach"&gt;Reichenbach, Hans (1947) Elements of symbolic logic.  London: Collier-MacMillan.  Exercise 3-4, p.405; solution p.417.&lt;/ref&gt;

In research showing how people make sense of information in their environment, this sentence was used to demonstrate how seemingly arbitrary decisions can drastically change meaning, analogous to how changes in the punctuation and quotes in the sentence show that the teacher alternately prefers James' work and John's work (e.g., compare: 'James, while John had had "had," had...' vs. 'James, while John had had "had had,"...').&lt;ref name="Weick"&gt;{{cite book

 | pages = 186–187
 | quote = Once a person has generated/bracketed part of the stream, then the activities of punctuation and connection (parsing) can occur in an effort to transform the raw data into information.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sentence is also used to show the [[Semantics|semantic]] vagueness of the word "had", as well as to demonstrate the [[Use–mention distinction|difference between using a word and mentioning a word]].&lt;ref name="Lecercle"&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Lecercle

 | isbn = 0-415-03431-0
 | page = 86
 | quote = Suppose I decide that I wish to make up a sentence containing eleven occurrences of the word 'had' in a row ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been used as an example of the complexities of language, its interpretation, and their effects on a person's [[perception]]s.&lt;ref name="Hollin"&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Hollin
 | first =  Clive R.

 | publisher = [[Routledge]]
 | isbn = 0-7484-0191-1
 | page = 34
 | quote = Do readers make use of the ways in which sentences are structured?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[syntax|syntactic]] structure to be clear to a reader, this sentence requires, at a minimum, that the two phrases be separated by using a [[semicolon]], [[period (punctuation)|period]], [[en-dash]] or [[em-dash]]. Still, [[Jasper Fforde]]'s novel ''The Well of Lost Plots'' employs a variation of the phrase to illustrate the confusion that may arise even from well-punctuated writing:&lt;ref name="Fforde"&gt;

==Series overview==
''Letterkenny'' revolves around the antics of the residents of a small rural Canadian community called Letterkenny.

Expanding the cast from the web series, the series focuses on Wayne and Katy (created for the TV series), siblings who run a small farm and produce stand, with help from Wayne's two friends: Daryl and "Squirrely" Dan (created for the TV series). It also focuses on a pair of local hockey players (Reily and Jonesy) who are involved in a polyamorous relationship with Katy. 

Episodes deal with life in a small town, amongst different types of people: the farmers (the "hicks"), the out-of-towners who make up the local hockey team, the town's minister, the local drug addicts (the "skids"), and members of the local First Nation (the "natives"). Often plots revolve around Wayne defending his reputation as "the toughest guy in Letterkenny", the exploits of the local hockey team, and Wayne's attempt to break up his sister's open relationship with two of the members of the team, the various schemes by "the skids" to rip off the residents of both Letterkenny and the [[Indian reservation|reservation]], and Wayne's various attempts to find love. In later seasons, the scripts feature wordplay and puns as a running joke to convey the intelligence of the small town characters.

==Production==
''Letterkenny'' is the first original series commissioned by [[CraveTV]],&lt;ref name=wfp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/entertainment/TV/Crave-TV-orders-up-first-original-series-Letterkenny-295212911.html|title=Crave TV orders up first original series: Letterkenny|work=Winnipeg Free Press|date=March 5, 2015|accessdate=February 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and premiered on that platform on February 7, 2016.&lt;ref name="570 News"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.570news.com/2015/11/09/tv-show-letterkenny-staring-listowels-jared-keeso-has-a-launch-date/|title=TV Show "Letterkenny", starring Listowel's Jared Keeso, has a launch date|last=Pope|first=Chris|work=570 News|date=November 9, 2015|accessdate=February 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show has its roots in ''Letterkenny Problems'', a short-format [[web series]] created by Keeso and released on [[YouTube]] in 2013.&lt;ref name="globe_refreshing"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/television/john-doyle-letterkennys-a-refreshing-and-intoxicating-canadian-comedy/article28653500/|title=John Doyle: Letterkenny’s a refreshing and intoxicating Canadian comedy|last=Doyle|first=John|work=The Globe and Mail|date=February 8, 2016|accessdate=February 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Letterkenny Problems'' garnered a [[Canadian Screen Award]] nomination for Best Original Fiction Program or Series Created for Digital Media at the [[2nd Canadian Screen Awards]] in 2014.&lt;ref name=wfp/&gt; The town of Letterkenny portrayed in the series is fictional, and not based on the [[Brudenell, Lyndoch and Raglan|actual ghost town]] in [[Renfrew County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.tsn.ca/bardown/Story.aspx?Letterkenny+is+coming+to+CraveTV+and+we+couldn%27t+be+more+excited&amp;id=568936|title=Letterkenny is coming to CraveTV and we couldn't be more excited|work=TSN|date=December 26, 2015|accessdate=March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
[[John Doyle (critic)|John Doyle]] of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' called the series "refreshing and intoxicating", and "funny, mad, droll, childish, and spiky."  Focusing on the show's characteristic use of often thick [[Canadian_English#Ontario|Ontario dialect]], he wrote that "Not since ''[[Trailer Park Boys]]'' launched have we heard the flavourful, [[Profanity|salty]] Canadian vernacular used with such aplomb and abandon"; but also that "Almost all the conversations are raw comedy and utterly plausible as small-town guy talk, not just in Canada but in villages and parishes wherever the grass grows."&lt;ref name="globe_refreshing"/&gt;

===Ratings===
CraveTV has stated that ''Letterkenny'''s debut was the biggest debut of any series on their platform since it launched in 2014, and that as of March 10, 2016, nearly one in three subscribers have watched the series.&lt;ref name="Season 2"/&gt;

[[file:Magnetic lens.jpg|thumb]]
[[file:Magnetic lens .png|thumb]]
[[file:Maier-Leibnitz-Laboratorium 17.jpg|thumb|A subtype of a magnetic lens ([[quadrupole magnet]]) in the Maier-Leibnitz laboratory, Munich]]

A '''magnetic lens''' is a device for the focusing or deflection of moving [[charged particles]], such as [[electron]]s or [[ion]]s, by use of the magnetic [[Lorentz force]]. Its strength can often be varied by usage of [[electromagnet]]s.

Magnetic lenses are used in diverse applications, from [[cathode ray tube]]s over [[electron microscopy]] to [[particle accelerator]]s.

== Design ==

A magnetic lens typically consists of several electromagnets arranged in a [[quadrupole]] (see [[quadrupole magnet]]), [[sextupole magnet|sextupole]], or higher format; the [[electromagnetic coil]]s are placed at the vertices of a square or another [[regular polygon]]. From this configuration a customized magnetic field can be formed to manipulate the [[particle beam]].

The passing particle is subjected to two vector forces &lt;math&gt;H_Z&lt;/math&gt; (parallel to the core), and &lt;math&gt;H_R&lt;/math&gt; (parallel to the radius of the lens). &lt;math&gt;H_R&lt;/math&gt; causes the particle to spiral through the lens, and this spiraling expose the electron to &lt;math&gt;H_Z&lt;/math&gt; which in turn focus the electron. Note that the magnetic field is inhomogeneous, particles close to the center are less strongly deflected than those passing the lens far from the axis.&lt;ref&gt;Hafner B., 2008, ''Introductory Transmission Electron Microscopy Primer,'' Characterization Facility, University of Minnesota - "[http://www.charfac.umn.edu/instruments/tem_primer.pdf Reference]"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
[[File:Crt14.jpg|thumb|A defection yoke (copper coils and white plastic former) around the rear neck of a cathode ray tube television]]
[[File:Ablenksyst1.jpg|thumb|View inside the yoke, with the tube removed]]

Television sets employing [[cathode ray tube]]s use a magnetic lens in the form of a ''[[deflection yoke]]'' to enable an electron beam to [[raster scan|scan]] the image by [[magnetic deflection|deflecting]] it vertically and horizontally.

The '''maxixe''' ({{IPA-pt|maˈʃiʃi}}), occasionally known as the '''Brazilian tango''', is a dance, with its accompanying music (often played as a subgenre of [[choro]]), that originated in the [[Brazil]]ian city of [[Rio de Janeiro]] in 1868, at about the same time as the [[Tango (dance)|tango]] was developing in neighbouring [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]]. It is a dance developed from [[Afro-Brazilian]] dances (mainly the [[lundu (dance)|lundu]]) and from European dances (mainly the [[polka]]).

Like the [[tango (dance)|tango]], the maxixe travelled to [[Europe]] and the [[United States]] in the early years of the 20th century.

The music was influenced by various other forms including the [[tango (dance)|Spanish tango]], [[lundu (dance)|lundu]], [[polka]] and [[habanera (music)|habanera]], and is danced to a rapid 2/4 time. Pianist [[Ernesto Nazareth]] composed many Brazilian tangos; he was known for blending folk influences into his tangos, polkas and waltzes. He resisted using folk terms for his compositions; he preferred ''Brazilian Tango'' to ''maxixe''.&lt;ref name=Nazareth&gt;[http://www.bn.br/fbn/musica/enzpolca.htm Ernesto Nazareth's Polkas and Tangos.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070529110516/http://www.bn.br/fbn/musica/enzpolca.htm |date=2007-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The maxixe was one of the dances that contributed to [[Samba (Brazilian dance)|samba]] dance styles (such as [[samba de gafieira]]) and [[lambada]].

[[Vernon Castle]] said of the maxixe in his 1914 book ''Modern Dancing'', "The steps themselves are not difficult; on the contrary, they are childishly simple; it is the easiest dance of all to do, and I think the hardest of all to do well."&lt;ref name=Castle&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/musdi:@field(DOCID+@lit(M24045)) Castle, Vernon "Modern Dancing" (1914) pg 107 - Accessed at the Library of Congress.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Troy Kinney]] (1914) wrote the following about the Maxixe:&lt;ref name=kinney&gt;[[Troy Kinney]], [[Margaret West Kinney]] (1914) "The Dance: Its Place in Art and Life" ([[public domain]], digitized  by [[Google]])&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This is, virtually, a revival of the [[Two-step (disambiguation)|Two-step]], plus certain [[Tango (dance)|Tango]] steps and ''enchainements'' (&lt;small&gt;step sequences&lt;/small&gt;). Instead of the Tango's touch-and-turn-in of the foot, it employs a device of resting the heel on the floor, the foot pointed upward, while the body assumes a bent-over posture not particularly attractive.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Tie to ''Titanic''==
First-class passenger Edith Russell left her lifeboat, before it was lowered, to retrieve her toy pig from her cabin, then returned. When on the water, she used the toy to amuse a baby in her lifeboat, as the pig played the ''Maxixe'' whenever its tail was twisted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lord, Walter|title=[[A Night to Remember (book)|A Night to Remember]]|page=4 (Chapter 8)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mel B: It's a Scary World''''' is an American [[reality television]] series starring English singer [[Mel B]]. It debuted on [[Style Network]] on September 5, 2010. The show's title is a play on Brown's nickname from when she was part of the [[Spice Girls]], "Scary Spice".

==Series background==
The series follows the life of British singer/actress/television personality [[Mel B]] and her blended family as they deal with Brown's daily life as entertainer, businesswoman, wife and mother. The series is being done in a hybrid docu-comedy type format.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2010/08/09/style-spotlights-sexy-superstar-scary-spice-on-the-new-style-series-mel-b-its-a-scary-world-premiering-sunday-september-5/20100809style01/ From The Futon Critic (August 9, 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
In an interview with the Futon Critic, Brown notes that what viewers will see is what they really do in real life everyday: "I have a job and my husband has a job so they were just following us around. It's not like we had to make anything up or we had to act. It was actually quite easy, to be honest. The kids thoroughly enjoyed it. It was just a very natural thing to do."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefutoncritic.com/rant/2010/09/03/interview-mel-b-its-a-scary-world-star-mel-b/20100903_melb/ "INTERVIEW: "MEL B: IT'S A SCARY WORLD" STAR MEL B"] from The Futon Critic (September 3, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Media Life television critic Tom Conroy had a different take on the show: "Anyone who watches "Mel B: It's a Scary World" will wish Mel the best of luck in her quest to add something memorable to her résumé, but this show isn’t it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medialifemagazine.com/artman2/publish/TV_Reviews_21/-Mel-B-It-s-a-Scary-World-tedious-too.asp "'Mel B: It’s a Scary World,' tedious, too"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909153342/http://www.medialifemagazine.com/artman2/publish/TV_Reviews_21/-Mel-B-It-s-a-Scary-World-tedious-too.asp |date=2010-09-09 }} from Media Life (September 1, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8309">'''The National Center for Voice and Speech''' (NCVS), is a multi-site research and teaching organization dedicated to studying the characteristics, limitations and enhancement of human voice and speech. The NCVS is located in Salt Lake City, Utah with the Lead Institution located at the University of Utah. NCVS is also a Center at the [[University of Iowa]] where it has laboratories in the Department of Speech Pathology and Audiology.  In addition, the NCVS has collaborators in Denver and at many institutions around the United States.  Its focus is [[vocology]], or the science and practice of voice habilitation.&lt;ref&gt;van Mersbergen M et al. (2001). "Preparation of the speech-language pathologist specializing in voice: an educational survey.", J Voice. 15(2):237-50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Titze, I.R. (1994). Principles of Voice Production, Prentice Hall.  {{ISBN|978-0-13-717893-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Initially conceived as a "center without walls," the NCVS was formally organized in 1990 with the assistance of a grant from the [[National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders]] (NIDCD), an institute of the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH). The NCVS was organized on the premise that a consortium of institutions (including the Wilber James Gould Voice Center at the [[Denver Center for the Performing Arts|DCPA]], [[University of Iowa]], [[University of Utah]], [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]) would be better able to conduct and disseminate research than a single organization. NCVS members, although geographically separate, were linked by a common desire to fully understand the characteristics, limitations and enhancement of human voice and speech.

In 1999, NIDCD discontinued the Multi-Purpose Research and Training Center funding mechanism for the entire institute focusing instead on single-project research awards (R01s). In a July 2000 meeting, however, NCVS investigators voted unanimously to continue the concept of a national resource center for voice and speech, to be driven by a variety of single-project research awards (R01s), as well as health communication, core, and training grants. In 2001, the NCVS moved its central location to Denver, where the otolaryngologist Dr. Wilbur James Gould had founded a center to study the voice and speech patterns of stage performers.

The NCVS team of investigators, led by [[Ingo Titze]], studies the powers, limitations and enhancement of [[human voice]] and [[Speech communication|speech]].  The investigators are scientists, clinicians, educators, engineers and musicians who use diverse backgrounds (i.e., speech-language pathology, [[physics]], [[computer science]], [[acoustics]], [[human voice|vocal performance]], [[biology]], [[medicine]] and [[engineering]]) to work together on voice and speech investigations.  As a direct outgrowth of their work, NCVS members also teach other investigators and practitioners who work with voice, as well as speech clients and the general public.  One example is the Summer Vocology Institute, which trains voice coaches and vocal health professionals in the study of [[Vocology]].

'''Puppetoon''' animation is a type of replacement animation, which is itself a type of [[stop-motion]] animation. In traditional stop-motion, the puppets are made with movable parts which are repositioned between frames to create the illusion of motion when the frames are played in rapid sequence.  In puppetoon animation the puppets are rigid and static pieces; each is typically used in a single frame and then switched with a separate, near-duplicate puppet for the next frame.  Thus puppetoon animation requires many separate figures.  It is thus more analogous in a certain sense to cel animation than is traditional stop-motion: the characters are created from scratch for each frame (though in cel animation the creation process is simpler since the characters are drawn and painted, not sculpted).

The style and the term "[[Puppetoons]]" were invented by [[George Pal]].

The '''Federation of Mixed Impact Martial Arts R-1''' is a promotional organization aimed at [[mixed martial arts]] "R-1" development and popularization in Russia. The R-1 Federation unites various aspects of [[martial arts]]. R-1 rules are based on research into preferences of tournament participants and spectators. The rules are intended to guarantee maximum entertainment. A related product called '''Combat Time R-1''' emerged on the world professional sports arena.

The international representative of the organization is the world [[boxing]] champion in four weight classes, actor and singer [[Roy Jones Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.sportbox.ru/Vidy_sporta/ediniborstva/profi/spbfoto_NI369776_Roy-Dzhons-zazheg-v-Rostove-na-Donu Statement by the representative of the International Federation of R-1 Roy Jones Jr. in the tournament, "Combat Time R-1"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boets.ru/new/13906 Roy Jones online Moscow - Rostov-on-Don]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{toclimit|3}}

== Rules ==
* R-1 brings together all kinds of impact martial arts. No wrestling,{{Clarify|date=March 2016}} no takedowns, and no submission holds. The only exception to the rule is a clinch when one is shocked.
* If one is by the opponent, one may try to enter into a clinch under-hook (hold under both arms) to recover. Upon recovery, the fighter must escape the clinch. A throw from a clinch results in disqualification. [[Muay Thai]] clinches are disallowed: on the first occurrence, the combat may continue with a warning; if it recurs, a second warning is followed by disqualification.
* No takedowns.  A second takedown in a match means disqualification.
* The opponent cannot be finished off on the ground. If one occurrence does not stop the fight, the combat can continue. If the fight ended, the combat is replayed. A second time results in disqualificaiton.
* Elbow punches mean disqualification.
* After a knockdown standing over the opponent is allowed once. A second time is disqualifying.
* In a clinch, more than two knee strikes is not allowed.

=== Rounds ===
Rating fights consist of three two-minute rounds.

Title fights consist of five two-minute rounds with rest of one minute.{{clarify|date=June 2016}}  A title combat that results in a draw is awarded to the current champion.

Matches can be completed by knockout, technical knockout, decision, disqualification, draw, or no avail. The referee and ringside doctor can stop the fight. Combat is judged by three judges on a ten-point system: the winner of each round receives ten points and the loser receives nine or fewer; if the round is equal, both receive ten points. If, after five or seven rounds the sum of points is equal, the judges appoint one additional two-minute round.

Judges judge only the extra round. In a draw after additional rounds, the judges evaluate the fight as a whole. The fight can be reckoned a draw if both fighters fall and can not get up at the same time, or in the case of accidental injury in the final stages. A draw requires the fighters to accept a rematch; if one fighter refuses or fails, the victory is awarded to the opponent.

"'''Semper Fidelis'''" is the fifteenth episode of season one of the CBS drama ''[[Jericho (2006 TV series)|Jericho]]''. The episode's title, [[Latin]] for "[[Semper fidelis|always faithful]]", is the motto of the [[United States Marine Corps]].

==Plot==
As the episode begins, Mayor [[Gray Anderson]] is trying to find a solution to the town's supply problems, recognizing that Jericho does not have enough supplies to survive the winter. He believes that their only option is to begin forcing the refugees who have arrived since the bombs exploded to leave. Some townspeople, having lost faith, are already making plans to leave for the south, believing that it will be easier to survive in the warmer climate. Former Mayor [[Johnston Green]] begs for them to stay, fearing that most of them will die or be murdered before they can reach safety. Just when all seems hopeless, a detachment of the [[United States Marine Corps]] under the command of a [[Gunnery Sergeant]] arrives in Jericho, traveling with an [[M1 Abrams|M1A2 Abrams]] tank, and claim that they are there to help restore electricity.

Jake befriends one of the Marines, Cpl. Maggie Mullen ([[Erin Daniels]]), and they rapidly become attracted to each other. However, it turns out that the Marines' arrival might not be such a good thing for the town when the Green family begins to suspect that they are impostors. Before the Marines are able to render any real assistance, and after the people of Jericho have begun sharing their own supplies with them, the Marines receive orders over the radio from [[Dodge City, Kansas|Dodge City]], recalling them to base. Mayor Anderson wants to stay on the Marines' good side, believing that, on their return, they will help to ensure that Jericho receives desperately needed supplies. To this end, Anderson decides to see them off with a fireworks display and a farewell dinner.

As all of this unfolds, a stand-off occurs inside the Hawkinses' house between [[Sarah Mason (Jericho character)|Sarah Mason]] and Robert Hawkins. Suspicious of Sarah's intentions, Hawkins steals her [[Oqo|hand-held communications terminal]]. When he reads her messages, he learns of her duplicity, and that she intends to use his family as leverage in order to acquire "the package". When Sarah discovers the theft, she takes Hawkins' son hostage, telling Hawkins that she was upset to find that he had decided to return to his family in spite of the relationship that they had had together before the bombs went off. Hawkins wants to know for whom Sarah is working, but she insists that she is now working only for herself. She plans to sell "the package" to the highest bidder in order to ensure her own survival.

Sarah ends up holding Hawkins' entire family at gunpoint, and he decides to hand over "the package", retrieving it from behind a concrete wall in his basement. It turns out that it is the unused [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]] that had been destined for [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Ohio]]. After a physical altercation Sarah gets the upper hand on both Richard and Darcy, but she is shot dead by Allison. Upset and frightened, Darcy leaves immediately with both children. Allison says "I love you" to her father for what seems to be the first time. After his family leaves, Robert makes contact with Sarah's partners using her hand-held device, and pretends to be her, telling her partners that he is now dead and that Sarah wants to know where she should take the bomb to deliver it to them. The mysterious contacts reply that they will shortly communicate where they will meet.

==Significance==
The episode does not definitively state whether or not what the "Marines" tell Jericho about the outside world is true or not. They say that the six regional governments have been re-united into one.  They also say that [[United States Secretary of Health and Human Services|Secretary of Health and Human Services]] Charles, who is referred to in "Black Jack" as being the first survivor in the [[United States presidential line of succession|presidential line of succession]], is now officially the president, and that [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Ohio]], where Hawkins' bomb was to have been detonated, is now the new capital of the U.S.A. They also report that the bombs used in the attacks were supplied by [[North Korea]], that the attacks were funded by [[Iran]], and that the U.S. had retaliated against both countries. They also say that American forces are still engaged in pursuing the surviving terrorists all over the world.

However, since the "Marines" themselves later confess that they got this information in bits and pieces of news that they had heard, and made up material to fill in the blanks, none of it can be assumed to be factual. However, it is worth noting that the "Marines" talked of the "war being over" '''before''' they were told that the citizens of Jericho have received little news about the outside world.

==Reception==
Geoff Berkshire at the ''LA Times'' praised the  episode as "a perfect example of the show in top form". He said "[Sarah's] death at the hands of Robert's daughter, Allison (Jazz Raycole), is thrilling and bold. There's something rather creepy about Allison becoming the second teenage killer on this show. It's precisely that kind of unsettling choice that underscores the bleakness and desperation that makes ''Jericho'' stand out from other network dramas."&lt;ref&gt;[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2007/07/jericho-its-nev.html 'Jericho': It's never too late] ''LA Times'',   July 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Seoul Train''''' is a 2004 documentary film that deals with the dangerous journeys of [[North Korean defectors]] fleeing through or to [[People's Republic of China|China]]. These journeys are both dangerous and daring, since if caught, they face forced repatriation, torture, and possible execution.

''Seoul Train'' has been broadcast on television around the world, including on the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] series ''[[Independent Lens]]''.  In January 2007, ''Seoul Train'' was awarded the [[DuPont-Columbia Award|Alfred I. duPont &amp;ndash; Columbia University Silver Baton]] for excellence in broadcast journalism.&lt;ref name="columbia1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.journalism.columbia.edu/cs/ContentServer/jrn/1175295299883/page/1175295299866/simplepage.htm |title=Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism:Site Map |publisher=Journalism.columbia.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907101458/http://www.journalism.columbia.edu/cs/ContentServer/jrn/1175295299883/page/1175295299866/simplepage.htm |archivedate=2009-09-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2007, "Seoul Train" was named runner-up in the [[National Journalism Awards]].&lt;ref name="scripps1"&gt;[http://foundation.scripps.com/foundation/news/releases/07march09.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711112111/http://foundation.scripps.com/foundation/news/releases/07march09.html |date=July 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Serious Sam''''' is a [[first-person shooter]] [[video game]], released in two episodes and the first in the [[Serious Sam|''Serious Sam'' series]], developed by [[Croteam]]. Originally released for [[Microsoft Windows]] only, ''Serious Sam''{{'s}} rising popularity resulted in the porting of the episodes to the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[GameCube]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[Game Boy Advance]], [[Linux]] and [[Palm OS]], as well as in the remaking of both episodes for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Linux]] and [[Xbox 360]] in high-definition.

The series follows the adventures of [[protagonist]] Sam "Serious" Stone and his fight against the forces of the notorious [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] overlord Mental who seeks to destroy humanity.

== Gameplay ==
Enemies spawn frequently and attack in large waves from across the game map, and the player is intended to dodge their projectiles and charges by jumping and strafing rather than by taking cover. Health and armor are non-regenerative on most difficulty levels, and instead are replenished with the health and armor packs which are littered throughout the game. Available health is represented by a percentage number on the screen. The combat is high-paced and frenetic: The levels typically consist of a series of elaborate arenas, in which the player will defeat a set number of re-spawning enemies before proceeding to the next. Enemies range from soldiers with rocket launchers to gigantic charging robots to shrieking suicide bombers without heads and holding bombs. The environments include [[Egyptian pyramids|ancient Egyptian pyramids]], tropical rainforests, and medieval castles. ''Serious Sam'' features [[cooperative gameplay]] through a split-screen mode and via the internet.

== Episodes ==
''Serious Sam'' consists of two episodes: ''Serious Sam: The First Encounter'' and ''Serious Sam: The Second Encounter''. A [[fan-made]] level-pack, ''Dark Island'', was included in ''Serious Sam: Gold''. The games are on separate CDs (in the UK version) and are identical to their individual releases, except that the Sam character model for ''The First Encounter'' was modified to match the one used in ''The Second Encounter''. After the release of the remakes, both titles had "Classic" added to the name to prevent confusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://steamcommunity.com/games/41050 |title=Steam Community: Serious Sam Classic: The First Encounter |work=[[Valve Corporation]] |accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://steamcommunity.com/games/41060 |title=Steam Community: Serious Sam Classic: The Second Encounter |work=[[Valve Corporation]] |accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Serious Sam: The First Encounter'' ===
''The First Encounter'' was the first game in the series; it had been in the making since 1996 and had a video showing its early game play in 2000. ''The First Encounter'' was originally developed by Croteam as a demonstrator for their engine and this is the reason why some countries saw its initial release priced at less than half the price of other games in the genre.

The game takes place after the events of ''[[Serious Sam 3: BFE]]'' and the introduction reveals what happened before the actual story took place. In ancient times, [[Earth]] was involved in a massive conflict between Mental, an evil extraterrestrial being who wants to rule the universe, and the Sirians, a technologically advanced sentient alien race that left many of its artifacts to be discovered by humanity. In the 22nd century, Mental and his army of grotesquely twisted monsters return to Earth intending to destroy humanity. The humans are quickly overwhelmed and driven back to Earth. As a last resort, humanity uses the "Time-Lock". This mysterious Sirian artifact contains the power to transport a single person back to a chosen point in time. Because of his bravery in fighting these monsters, Sam "Serious" Stone is chosen to use the Time-Lock in hopes that he will defeat Mental and change the course of history. As the game opens, Sam appears in [[Egypt]]. He travels from one Egyptian monument to the next, fighting against the monsters Mental sent after him along the way. During Sam's journey, Sam is able to find and activate a hidden Sirian communicator in the shape of an obelisk located in [[Luxor]], which summons a Sirian [[starship]] to Earth from deep space. Sam rushes to the [[Great Pyramids of Giza]] in order to rendezvous with the starship, only to be cornered by Mental's general, Ugh Zan III. After defeating the giant, Sam then teleports himself onto the starship. While Sam is aboard the "SSS Centerprice", he leaves a phone message to Mental telling him that "he has a special delivery package for him" and sets a course to Sirius, the Sirian homeworld.

=== ''Serious Sam: The Second Encounter'' ===
''The Second Encounter'' starts where the previous game left off, with Sam traveling to Sirius on the SSS Centerprice. Unfortunately, the starship is accidentally hit by the "Croteam crate-bus" and plummets down to Earth's surface. As the starship falls, Sam reads the coordinates and frets about crash-landing into Egypt again, but instead he crashes into [[Central America]] in the [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] age, with the starship now heavily damaged upon impact. However, not all hope is lost, since the Sirians left a "back-up starship" on Earth, which was a fail-safe in case anything ever happened to the SSS Centerprice. However, since this back-up starship is located in a different time and age than where and when Sam currently is, he will have to uncover the locations of the Sirian portals that will help him reach his destination. With this new objective, Sam storms through [[Mesoamerica]], then travels to [[Mesopotamia]] and finally to [[Medieval Europe]] where the back-up starship is located. During his journey, Sam battles two of Mental's portal guardians: a powerful Mayan spirit named [[Kukulkan]] the Wind God and a biomechanical creature called the Exotech Larva. Finally, in front of the Cathedral of Sacred Blood, Sam confronts the last obstacle to overcome on his path to the [[Holy Grail]], Mordekai the Summoner. After a glorious battle with Mordekai and his spawning minions, The Summoner is finally silenced forever. In the Cathedral, Sam lifts the Holy Grail in the palms of his hands, followed by his sarcastic confessions of his sins in a booth to Mental, during which he tells Mental that "he's coming to get him." During the end credits, Sam activates the back-up starship, which turns out to be a rocket, and travels back into space toward Sirius, with the "Croteam Big-Heads" cheering him on. The story continues on to ''[[Serious Sam II]]''.

Other than the more varied locations, ''The Second Encounter'' features some additional weapons—a [[chainsaw]], a [[flamethrower]], a [[sniper rifle]], and the powerful Serious Bomb—and a number of new monsters that Sam has to face. This game has also seen the release of a level-pack titled ''Dark Island'', featuring fan-made levels for single and multiplayer mode. ''The Second Encounter'' soundtrack featured three [[instrumental]] songs from the Croatian heavy-metal band Undercode.

== Development ==
Croteam created their own engine for use in both ''The First Encounter'' and ''The Second Encounter''. Named the "Serious Engine", it is designed to cope with extremely large view distances and massive numbers of models by implementing [[level of detail]] rendering. Most contemporary FPS engines were developed for a limited draw distance and only a few animating models (i.e. enemies) on screen at a time. The Serious Engine is very efficient, capable of maintaining dozens of moving enemies (often stampedes) and enormous enemies, even on a modest system challenging the well known [[id Tech]], [[Unreal Engine]] or [[Source (game engine)|Source]] engines. The "Serious Engine" can render through both [[Direct3D]] or [[OpenGL]] and, while it does not support pixel or vertex shaders, it is optimised for [[Direct3D]] 7's hardware transformation, clipping and lighting. The "Serious Engine" is available for licensing from Croteam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.croteam.com/engine_overview.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007101436/http://www.croteam.com/engine_overview.shtml |title=Serious Engine Overview |work=[[Croteam]] |archive-date=7 October 2014 |accessdate=17 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more powerful iteration of the "Serious Engine" was developed for use in ''Serious Sam 2'' and is known as "Serious Engine 2". It supports many features of modern GPUs such as pixel and vertex shaders, HDR, bloom and parallax mapping.

Serious Engine 3 was used in ''Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter'' and ''Serious Sam HD: The Second Encounter''. It includes detailed shading, and enemies are completely remodeled to look more realistic. This engine is also being developed to harness the full capacity of HDR and High Definition mapping. An updated version, Serious Engine 3.5, is used in ''[[Serious Sam 3: BFE]]''.

The latest version is the Serious Engine 4, which [[Croteam]] used in their most recent game, [[The Talos Principle]].

In March 2016, Croteam released Serious Engine v1.10 as [[free and open source software]] on [[GitHub]] under the [[GNU General Public License]] v2.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Serious-Engine-Open-Source Croteam Open-Sources The Serious Engine] by [[Michael Larabel]] on [[Phoronix]] (11 March 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.croteam.com/serious-sam-source-code-released/|title=Serious Sam’s Serious Engine source code release|date=11 March 2016|publisher=Croteam |accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Palm OS version ===
In November 2001, [[Global Star Software]] announced the completion of a [[Palm OS]] version of ''The First Encounter'' developed by [[InterActive Vision]], to be released in early December. The game included 15 levels, and came in both color and monochrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/serious-sam-on-your-palm-2825056 |title=Serious Sam on your Palm |last=Walker |first=Trey |work=[[GameSpot]] |date=15 November 2001 |accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was released on 6 December 2001, as well as two demos for the color and the monochrome versions of the game.

=== Xbox version ===
The Xbox edition of ''Serious Sam'' had notable differences including the model of Sam being changed from the model of ''The First Encounter'' to form a more cartoon style Sam, removing the shades to make him look less like [[Duke Nukem (character)|Duke Nukem]] and more like he does today. The Xbox version includes all of the levels from both of the PC games. As a result, weapons from ''The Second Encounter'' were added to the levels that were part of ''The First Encounter'' on PC. The levels were made smaller by removing the areas outside of the playing area. Unlike the PC version, Sam can't exit too far out of the playing area. This is due to the smaller amount of memory available in the Xbox. The gameplay was given a more arcade touch. A life system was implemented into the single-player game making use of the score. Every 100,000 points grants the player a new life, which allows respawning at the place of death rather than at a save point. Combo points were added for killing multiple enemies at the same time, which allows the player to increase his/her score at a fast pace. Further changes to the game include the addition of treasure and the tweaking of save points. Save points are designated by a red phone booth. Auto-aiming was also added to the Xbox version to compensate for the degree of control usually offered by a keyboard and mouse setup.

== Remake ==
Croteam took their publishing rights from 2K Games to new startup [[Devolver Digital]], after [[2K Games]] became uninterested in ''Serious Sam'', waiting for their long rival ''[[Duke Nukem Forever]]'' to finish.
Both episodes were remade using Serious Engine 3. They featured updated visuals, better performance and lush environments, all in high-definition. The remakes featured 16-player online [[Cooperative gameplay|co-op]] (4-player in the [[Xbox Live Arcade]] version), deathmatch and a new game-mode called "Co-Op Tournament".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.engadget.com/2009/06/25/croteam-seriously-remaking-serious-sam-for-xbla/ |title=Croteam seriously remaking Serious Sam for XBLA [update: It's coming to PC too] |last=Fletcher |first=JC |work=[[Engadget]] |date=25 June 2009 |accessdate=10 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/41000/ |title=Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter on Steam |work=[[Valve Corporation]] |accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Released on 15 May 2012, it contained new maps for the Survival and Multiplayer modes and a new, short set of campaign missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/41019/ |title=Serious Sam HD: The Second Encounter - Legend of the Beast DLC on Steam |work=[[Valve Corporation]] |accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sesquicentennial March''' ({{lang-es|Marcha Sesquicentenario}}) is a well-known [[Peruvian music|Peruvian]] march, composed by the [[Peruvian people|Peruvian]] [[composer (music)|composer]] [[Jaime Díaz Orihuela]] ([[Arequipa]], 1927). The march, winner of a national contest for military music in celebration of the [[sesquicentennial]] of national independence in 1971, represents a grand combination of Andean sentiment and a pronounced martial theme. It is one of the more popular marches among those performed in parades and ceremonies in [[Peru]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filarmonia.org/page/Jaime-Diaz-Orihuela.aspx|title=Jaime Díaz Orihuela|accessdate=2 March 2014|website=Filarmonía 102.7 FM}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nayoulloa.com/numachu.html|title=Jaime Díaz Orihuela|website=Nayo Ulloa, Master of the Peruvian Flute (Kena)|accessdate=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sidewalks Entertainment''''' (1988–present) is a weekly [[United States|American]] television series that is a combination of a [[talk show]], magazine show and [[variety show]] featuring celebrity interviews, music, artistic and novelty acts, and rising performers. The 30-minute program is primarily produced in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] with segments from other parts of the country, including [[Los Angeles]] and [[New York City|New York]].

[[Richard R. Lee]] is the creator and [[executive producer]], as well as lead [[editing|editor]] and [[webmaster]] of [[#The Website|SidewalksTV.com]]. On-air personalities [[Cindy Rhodes]] and [[Rafael Siegel]] are also co-producers.

During the first six years, the show was known as '''''Sidewalks'''''. The producers decided to add ''Entertainment'' to the program's title, so viewers would understand it was an entertainment show and not a show related to public works or about concrete walkways. On websites and television grids, the program is listed as ''Sidewalks Entertainment'', although hosts, guests and on-air graphics may still refer to the program as ''Sidewalks''.

As of April 14, 2007, the show has produced 256 regular editions, along with a number of special episodes and temporary shows.

==History==

===Guests and Segments===
The current version of ''Sidewalks'' is primarily a celebrity-based interview and music show, but the original concept was somewhat different.

The initial draft was to feature [[busking|street performers]], who are also known as ''sidewalk performers'' (hence the show's title). Cameras would follow and showcase the street performers in San Francisco or at the studio where ''Sidewalks'' was produced. Shortly before production began, the street performer segment was dropped due to time and a lack of interest from some of the money-starved talents. Only a handful of street performers eventually appeared on the series.

The early years of ''Sidewalks'' became a TV showcase for unknown aspiring musicians and artists.  Talents appeared with at least one full-length performance, followed by a short interview. For some of the talents, the show produced exclusive music videos of the acts. The ''Sidewalks'' clips became one of the [[trademark]]s of the production for guests and viewers (after airing on an episode, the videos went on to become demonstration reels for the guests and also appeared on some [[international]] television programs).

In 1990, the show expanded its format and experimented with national music videos. Along with musical clips from popular artists such as [[Mariah Carey]], [[Jessica Simpson]], and [[Destiny's Child]], well-known musical stars, ranging from [[Fred Schneider]] of [[The B-52's]] to then-newcomer [[Mary J. Blige]], became guests. Around 1992, the show journeyed into more celebrity interviews, which now included actors from TV and films. The regional show became part of the national media tour, where celebrities would come on a TV show to pitch or promote their projects. The ''Sidewalks'' host would conduct interviews either in-person or from a satellite tour.

Some of the national guests who have appeared on the show:
* Actresses: [[Brittany Murphy]], [[Doris Roberts]], [[Melinda Clarke]], [[Jennie Garth]], [[Jamie-Lynn Sigler|Jamie-Lynn DiScala]], [[Sela Ward]], [[Vanessa Marcil]], [[Debbie Reynolds]], [[AnnaSophia Robb]], [[Catherine Bell (actress)|Catherine Bell]], [[Teri Garr]], [[Rae Dawn Chong]], and [[Nell Carter]].
* Actors: [[Michael Madsen]], [[Bill Paxton]], [[Hank Azaria]], [[Scott Bakula]], [[Danny Glover]], [[Bob Saget]], [[Robert Englund]], and [[Rob Schneider]].
* Singers / bands: [[Green Day]], [[Josh Groban]], [[The Judds]], [[Phil Collins]], [[Bruce Hornsby]], [[Kenny Loggins]], [[David Ford (musician)|David Ford]], [[Teddy Geiger]], [[LaToya London]], [[Rick Springfield]], [[John Hiatt]], country performers [[Sara Evans]] and [[Deana Carter]], rock band [[Barenaked Ladies]], and Christian music stars [[Sandi Patty]], [[Rachael Lampa]], and [[Point of Grace]].
* Sports stars: [[Wayne Gretzky]], [[Jeff Gordon]], [[Mia Hamm]], [[Brandi Chastain]], [[Bonnie Blair]], [[Richard Petty]], [[Jon Wood]], [[Bobby Labonte]], [[Michael Waltrip]], and [[Shaquille O'Neal]].
* TV hosts: [[Meredith Vieira]], [[Elisabeth Hasselbeck]] and [[Joy Behar]] (from [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]''), [[Stephanie Miller]], [[Melissa Rivers]], and [[Donny Osmond|Donny]] and [[Marie Osmond]].
* Authors: [[Judith Krantz]], [[Sidney Sheldon]], and [[Jackie Collins]].

''Sidewalks'' also took its production remotely to showcase a variety of events and conventions. Events such as [[KMEL]] radio's Summer Jam event, the nationwide [[Lollapalooza]] concert tour, [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney]]'s [[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]] ice show, The [[National Association of Recording Merchandisers]] (NARM), The [[Renaissance Pleasure Faire]], the comic and fantasy convention [[WonderCon]], behind-the-scenes at [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus]] and movie premieres were featured. The [[Bay Area Music Awards]] ([[Bammies]]) (later renamed as the [[California Music Awards]]) became one of the show's major annual events.

In 2003, the show's production went bi-coastal, thanks to returning on-air personality of  Siegel, who conducted celebrity interviews on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]]. He had a number of prominent interviews with such stars as [[Wyclef Jean]], [[Heather Headley]], and [[Gang Starr]].

===Hosts and Correspondents===
The on-air personalities for ''Sidewalks'' have been a talented mix of newcomers, many of whom are getting their first opportunities in front of a camera.

The show's 17th season is currently hosted by [[Cindy Rhodes]], [[Rafael Siegel]] and [[Richard R. Lee]], with correspondents [[Natalie Manuel]] and [[Eve Galazin]].

Host/producer Rhodes has been the longest mainstay to the program since 1993. She has interviewed a majority of the celebrity interviews and is producing the satellite media tours segments. Host/producer Siegel, who originally started with the stage name ''Rafael Hernandez'', joined the show in 1994 as viewer-turned production crew member-turned host. Siegel returned to the show in 2003 as an East Coast correspondent. In 2005, he moved back to the West Coast where ''Sidewalks'' is taped and joined the current hosting team.

The first set of nine shows during season one was hosted by [[Robert Guarino]], [[Rosie Sorenson]] and [[Mel Menefee]]. The older Menefee became the show's on-screen [[gimmick]] between 1988 through 1994. The ''Mel Menefee'' character was an ongoing feature as the producers used Menefee's zaniness to form comedic situations, while the other personalities were hosting the episodes. When the show returned after a year hiatus, Menefee was joined by other personalities, most notably [[Denise Yvonne]] (now using the name Dee Jones). Other personalities that appeared for a number of seasons were [[Marci Camacho]], [[Sibyl Motley]], [[Jennifer Parnoff]], and [[Veronica Ornelas]].

''Sidewalks'' also gives college students their first on-air experience. [[Eboni Warnking]], [[Shereelynn Manlangit]], [[Monica Calzada]], Oakland Raiderettes cheerleader [[Michelle Marquez]], and [[Nadine Toren]] have been some of the [[intern]]s.

===Production History===
In early 1988, San Francisco Bay Area resident [[Richard R. Lee]] got a chance to create and produce his first television show at Televents, a local [[El Cerrito, Contra Costa County, California|El Cerrito]], [[California]] [[Cable television|cable]] station, after he helped and worked on various studio productions. That TV show became ''Sidewalks'', which went before the cameras in May and debuted its first episode on September 1, 1988.

The production schedule of ''Sidewalks'' has been irregular (due to [[TV station]] and equipment availability), although the show has never left the air since 1988. ''Sidewalks'' produced nine shows during season one. Almost a year later, the production returned for several more years at the retitled cable company [[Bay Cablevision]] (later purchased by various cable companies including [[AT&amp;T]] and [[Comcast]]).

In 1994, Lee brought the production to [[KCRT-TV]], a non-commercial [[Richmond, California]] TV station, where Lee was already working at for a couple of years. Throughout the [[decade]] run, the TV show was an intermittent co-production between Lee and the station until 2004.

The show is now solely produced by Sidewalks Entertainment, Inc., a California [[corporation]] developed by Rhodes and Lee, to further the production.

===Sidewalks: The Entertainment Project===
The main producers / hosts and a new team are currently working on re-launching the original concept into a potential national broadcast TV series.  They are calling the forthcoming version, ''Sidewalks: The Entertainment Project'' (a title that may change when the new show premieres).

In 2005, the team produced a new one-hour ''test pilot'', which sports among things a new logo and theme music. In the pilot, the segments were interviews with [[American Idol]]'s [[LaToya London]], [[Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]]'s [[Carson Kressley]], young actress [[AnnaSophia Robb]], the pop music group [[From The Desk of Sally]], a [[Kelly Clarkson]] video, and a feature about finding a talent agent.  The pilot is designed to showcase the new production to commercial stations and [[TV networks]].

While the team is developing the new version, the producers and hosts are continuing their long-running ''Sidewalks Entertainment'' and ''[[Sidewalks: Video Nite]]'' series with brand new episodes. Parts of the ''test pilot'' were recycled into two episodes ("American Idols" and "Talent Agents") of ''Sidewalks Entertainment'''s 16th season.

==Spin-off Series: Sidewalks: Video Nite==
{{main|Sidewalks: Video Nite}}
''Sidewalks'' receives music video clips from various [[record companies]]. In 1992, the show opened its fifth season with a set of music video editions. The initial reaction to the  video shows didn't fared well with viewers, because the regular lineup of interviews, musical guests and artistic acts disappeared for a short time. Producer Lee decided to create a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series to handle the load of clips. '''''[[Sidewalks: Video Nite]]''''' was born. Currently, ''Sidewalks: Video Nite'' is a regular series on KCRT-TV and some selected episodes are aired in other markets.

==The Website==
Along with ''Sidewalks Entertainment'' and ''Sidewalks: Video Nite'', the program’s official website, '''SidewalksTV.com''', has become its own entity. Creator and executive producer Lee has been the webmaster for the entire variation of the site.

Originally appearing as a small, couple page website on [[Geocities]] and [[Xoom (web hosting)|Xoom]], the site featured basic information about the TV show and its staff. As time passed, the site moved onto other servers, presented on-line articles and displayed video clips.  From the beginning until fall 2006, the site used exclusively [[RealVideo|Real]] video clips as its choice of [[Streaming media|web streaming]]. The latest clips are now encoded in [[Adobe Flash Player|Flash]] video for better platform delivery.

The main spotlight of the website is celebrity interviews. Since 2003, majority of the show’s interviews have been presented on the site. Generally, the website displays the complete interview with a celebrity, whereas the TV show may exhibit an edited or shorter version of the same interview due to dated content or time allotment. Many of the interviews have debuted on the website days or weeks before it appeared on an episode of ''Sidewalks''.

The website has also been presenting its own interviews and special segments taped by the ''Sidewalks'' production crew or, occasionally, an outside supplier. The crew has been recording multiple segments of an interview that can be used as separate web content. Some of the exclusive web presentations include interviews with [[rapper]] [[David Banner]] and [[R&amp;B]] singer [[Raz-B]]; movie coverage of films “[[Catch a Fire (film)|Catch A Fire]]” and “[[The Pursuit of Happyness|The Pursuit of Happiness]];” behind-the-scenes interviews at The California Music Awards and sci-fi/comic convention [[WonderCon]]; and special features such as the audio mixing of movies, special health segments, and [[KBLX]] radio station’s Kevin Brown Anniversary Party.

In the summer of 2006, Lee and production member [[Justin Langston]] launched the program’s blog, '''''Sidewalks On The Corner'''''. The blog features articles and music and movie reviews.

Since May 2006, SidewalksTV.com has also been releasing selected clips on other digital platforms, such as [[YouTube]] and [[MySpace]].

==Miscellaneous==
* The first satellite tour that ''Sidewalks'' conducted featured an interview with actor [[Sean Patrick Flanery]], who was promoting ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'' made-for-cable films.
* The first video clip encoded for the website was an interview with [[Dr. Dre]] at the Bay Area Music Awards (Bammies).
* The following guests have appeared on the ''Sidewalks'' TV series more than once: [[AnnaSophia Robb]], [[Stacy London]], [[Richard Hatch (actor)|Richard Hatch]], [[Tia Mowry|Tia]] and [[Tamera Mowry]], [[Carson Kressley]], [[Melinda Clarke]], [[Dave Koz]], [[Patti LaBelle]], [[Annie Potts]], and authors [[Sandra Brown]] and [[Sidney Sheldon]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4898">'''TLA Entertainment Group''' is a privately held corporation based in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. It was founded in 1981.

Originally formed to operate a repertory movie theater, the company subsequently moved into catalog and online sales, retail stores, film festivals and film distribution. The catalog began as a pornographic mail order business and grew to include also gay and lesbian non-pornographic films and books and mainstream films.&lt;ref name=wharton&gt;{{cite web | url=http://media.www.whartonjournal.com/media/storage/paper201/news/2003/02/24/Insider/Tlas-Unconventional.Titles.Hit.Homes-376923.shtml | title=TLA'S unconventional titles hit homes | last=Kim | first=Annie | publisher=The Wharton Journal | accessdate=2007-11-04 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312060134/http://media.www.whartonjournal.com/media/storage/paper201/news/2003/02/24/Insider/Tlas-Unconventional.Titles.Hit.Homes-376923.shtml | archivedate=2007-03-12 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
TLA stands for [[Theater of the Living Arts|Theatre of the Living Arts]]. Now a concert venue, it was founded as an experimental theater group in the 1960s &lt;ref name=wharton/&gt; under the direction of [[Andre Gregory]] (of ''My Dinner with Andre'' fame).
The group included [[Danny DeVito]], [[Judd Hirsch]], [[Sally Kirkland]] and [[Ron Leibman]] who performed exclusively in the [[Theater of the Living Arts]] on [[South Street (Philadelphia)|South Street]] in [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tlavideo.com/company/aboutus.cfm | title=About us: TLA Entertainment Group | accessdate=2007-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By the mid- to late-60s, funding for the Theater was running out and the theater was converted to a movie house showing an eclectic mix of classic and foreign films.

In 1981, the founding partners of TLA Entertainment Group met and subsequently ran the theater. For the next six years the TLA was a repertory art movie theater. In addition, for four of those six years, the partners ran a small, first-run art house, the Roxy Screening Room, also located in Center City Philadelphia.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

The [[Theater of the Living Arts]] is no longer affiliated with TLA Entertainment Group.

==Video stores==
In 1985, the first video store was opened next door to [[Theater of the Living Arts]]. The stores expanded into a chain, and by 2005 there were four stores in Philadelphia and one in New York. (The NYC store was in a building previously occupied by the [[8th St. Playhouse]].) Starting in 2007, the stores began closing, with the New York store closing first, followed by the [[Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Chestnut Hill]] and [[Society Hill]] locations in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://citypaper.net/blogs/criticalmass/2009/10/20/south-street-tla-video-closes/ South Street TLA Video Closes]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Rittenhouse Square]] location in 2011. The final store, TLA [[Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania|Bryn Mawr]] remained open until October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.philly.com/2011-10-04/business/30242834_1_video-stores-tla-video-graduate-student TLA Video still holding on in Bryn Mawr]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Online sales==

TLA Entertainment Group launched the TLAvideo website in 1997. The site sells gay and lesbian, American independent, international, Hollywood and pornographic DVDs and books.

==Film festivals==

In 1994, TLA Entertainment Group President Raymond Murray started the [[Philadelphia International Gay &amp; Lesbian Film Festival]].

In 2001, TLA Entertainment Group assumed management of the Philadelphia Festival of World Cinema, now called The [[Philadelphia Film Festival]]. The two-week festival shows over 100 feature films from around the world.  In order to better fund these events, in August 2001 TLA Entertainment Group spun them off and created the non-profit Philadelphia Film Society.

==Film distribution==
[[TLA Releasing]] is the licensing division of TLA Entertainment. It is focused on the acquisition of distribution rights of international, independent, and gay and lesbian films to theaters and on DVD and VHS.  TLA Releasing releases two films a month for the home entertainment market. The catalog of films is available online.

'''John Baker Omohundro''' (July 26, 1846 – June 28, 1880), also known as "Texas Jack," was an American frontier [[Reconnaissance|scout]], [[actor]], and [[cowboy]]. Born in rural Virginia he served in the Confederacy during the American Civil War and later as a civilian scout for the [[US Army]] during the [[Indian Wars]].
Before his untimely death, Texas Jack became a legendary figure in the [[American Old West]] as a western showman performing dramas on the stage throughout the country, and was immortalized in dime novels published around the world.

==Early life==
Omohundro was born in [[Palmyra, Virginia|Palmyra]] on the Pleasure Hill farm in [[Fluvanna County, Virginia]], on July 26, 1846, to John Burwell and Catherine Baker Omohundro of [[English Americans|Anglo-American]] ancestry. He attended grammar school in Fluvanna and at an early age showed a strong skill in hunting and fishing.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Omohundro|Omohundro (1950)]], p. 512.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the [[American Civil War]], Omohundro attempted to join his older brother, Orville, in the [[Confederate Army]]. He was twice refused for his age, but was allowed to serve as a courier at the headquarters of the Virginia Militia under [[John B. Floyd|Major General John B. Floyd]]. Because of his youth and knowledge of the countryside he became known as the "Boy Scout of the Confederacy". In February 1864, at the age of 17, he successfully enlisted as a private in Company G of the [[5th Virginia Cavalry]], part of the [[Army of Northern Virginia]], and was soon serving directly in [[J.E.B. Stuart|General J.E.B. Stuart's]] command as a courier and scout. At the [[Battle of Yellow Tavern]] he delivered a scouting report to J.E.B. Stuart only minutes before the General was killed in battle. During the [[Battle of Trevilian Station]], Omohundro was wounded and admitted to the Confederate States General Hospital in Charlottesville on June 20, 1864. After recovering from his injuries, and a short leave home, he returned to his Company and scouted under the command of [[Lunsford L. Lomax|General Lunsford Lomax]]. Following the [[Third Battle of Winchester]], the 5th Virginia Cavalry was consolidated with the 15th Virginia Cavalry, where Omohundro scouted under [[Fitzhugh Lee|General Fitzhugh Lee]] during the last months of the war.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Omohundro|Omohundro (1950)]], pp. 513–515.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Logan|Logan (1954)]], pp. 9–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cowboy, hunting, and scouting career==
After the Civil War, Omohundro left Virginia at age 19 for Florida. After a short time he moved on to Texas, arriving at the Taylor Ranch near [[Brazos County, Texas|Brazos]], where he began working as a cowboy participating in cattle drives, notably on the [[Chisholm Trail]]. After one drive across Arkansas to a meat-poor Tennessee, he was given nickname "Texas Jack" by the locals. On another drive, Omohundro found a five-year-old boy orphaned after a Native American raid killed his family. He brought the boy to safety in Fort Worth, and the boy later took the name [[Texas Jack (South Africa)|Texas Jack Jr.]] in homage, going on to run the ''Texas Jack's Wild West Show and Circus'' in 1903 in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Yagoda|Yagoda (2000)]], p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1869, Texas Jack moved to [[Fort Hays|Fort Hays, Kansas]], where he met [[California Joe Milner]] and [[Wild Bill Hickok]], the latter being sheriff of Ellis County at the time. Later that year, Jack met and befriended [[Buffalo Bill|William F. "Buffalo Bill" Cody]], who was working with the 5th U.S. Cavalry at [[Fort McPherson, Nebraska|Fort McPherson]], and Jack was hired as a scout and trail guide during the [[American Indian Wars|Indian Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Logan|Logan (1954)]], pp. 31–33; 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Special permission had to be obtained as the U.S. Government did not generally permit the employment of ex-Confederate soldiers. During the [[Battle of Summit Springs]], Texas Jack captured his well known white horse from Indian Chief [[Tall Bull]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Texas Jack - A Sketch of the Frontier Hero and his Horse|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85052141/1872-07-27/ed-1/seq-1/|accessdate=16 May 2017|publisher=The Hickman Courier|date=July 27, 1872}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Texas Jack moved to Cottonwood Springs, Nebraska, where, aside from his work as a scout for the government, he made a lucrative living leading hunting expeditions for American and foreign parties which were popular at the time. Notably, Texas Jack, together with Cody, led the highly publicized royal hunt of 1872 with [[Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Alexei of Russia]] and several American military figures, including [[Philip Sheridan|General Philip Sheridan]], [[George Armstrong Custer|General George Custer]], and [[James W. Forsyth|Colonel James Forsyth]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cody|Cody (1920)]], p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt;
Later in 1874, Texas Jack guided the [[Windham Wyndham-Quin, 4th Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl|Earl of Dunraven]] though [[Yellowstone]] and Geyserland.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dunraven|Dunraven (1917)]], p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1876, Texas Jack led [[Reid baronets|Sir John Rea Reid]] and his party on a hunt around the [[Bighorn Mountains]] and [[Sweetwater County, Wyoming|Sweetwater country]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hunting the Elk|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83016348/1877-04-28/ed-1/seq-4/|accessdate=16 May 2017|publisher=The Cecil Whig|date=April 28, 1877}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acting==
[[File:Texas Jack Cody et al.jpg|thumb|Ned Buntline, Buffalo Bill Cody, Giuseppina Morlacchi, Texas Jack Omohundro]]
In December 1872, Omohundro and Cody debuted the first [[Wild West shows|Wild West show]], ''Scouts of the Prairie'', in Chicago written and produced by [[Ned Buntline]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hall|Hall (2001)]], p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Texas Jack's performance was well-received by critics and featured the first rope act performed on the American stage.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Logan|Logan (1954)]], p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; The show starred [[Giuseppina Morlacchi]], a dancer and actress from [[Milan]], [[Italy]], who was performing in the theater circuit with her ''Morlacchi Ballet Troupe'' when she was invited to join ''Scouts of the Prairie'' with the group.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Barker|Barker (1984)]], p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; She and Texas Jack fell in love and were married on August 31, 1873 at [[St. Mary's Church (Rochester, New York)|St. Mary's Catholic Church in Rochester, NY]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Personal Intelligence|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030313/1873-09-03/ed-1/seq-6/|accessdate=16 May 2017|publisher=The New York Herald|date=September 3, 1873}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1873, Buntline left, and Wild Bill Hickok joined the group to headline in a new play called ''Scouts of the Plains''. Hickok did not enjoy acting, often hiding behind scenery, and in one show he shot the spotlight when it focused on him. He was released from the group after a few months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Burns|first1=Walter Noble|title=Frontier Hero - Reminiscences of Wild Bill Hickok by his old Friend Buffalo Bill|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86091195/1911-11-02/ed-1/seq-2/|accessdate=16 May 2017|publisher=The Blackfoot Optimist. (Blackfoot, Idaho)|date=November 2, 1911}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Desiring a lighter tour schedule, Texas Jack parted ways with Cody, and in 1877 he formed his own acting troupe in St. Louis, known as the ''Texas Jack Combination'' featuring Morlacchi, [[Arizona John Burke]], the [[Modoc War]] scout [[Donald McKay (scout)|Donald McKay]], trick-shot Maud Oswald, and several Sweetwater &amp; Warm Spring Indians. In May of that year he debuted ''Texas Jack in the Black Hills'', written by Harry Seymour, to rave reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wood's Theater|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85025759/1877-05-15/ed-1/seq-1/|accessdate=16 May 2017|publisher=The Cincinnati Daily Star|date=May 15, 1877}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Other plays the combination performed included ''The Trappers Daughter'', ''Life on the Border'', and ''The French Spy''.

==Dime novels==
[[File:Beadles Pocket Library 9.jpg|thumb|Beadles Dime Novel]]
In the late 19th century, [[dime novels]] depicting frontier life were becoming common, and Texas Jack became a popular subject of these stories. The dime novels, printed on inexpensive wood pulp paper and costing five to ten cents each, were published weekly or monthly. One of the first of these novels was titled ''Texas Jack; or The White King of the Pawnees'', written by Ned Buntline, and first appeared in 1872. Texas Jack's popularity grew as he was featured on covers by publishers including Beadle's New York Dime Library, The Nickle Library, Log Cabin Library, DeWitt's Ten Cent, Street and Smith, and others. Many of these stories were written by the prolific author [[Prentiss Ingraham|Col. Prentiss Ingraham]]. Omohundro wrote articles in newspapers across the country recalling his hunting and scouting stories, and is credited as having authored one dime novel titled ''Ned Wylde, the Boy Scout'' for Beadle and Adams in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Johannsen|Johannsen (1950)]], p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900, [[Joel Chandler Harris]] wrote ''On the Wing of Occasions'', a series for the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'', that featured Texas Jack and the [[Confederate Secret Service]] in a fictional plot to kidnap President Lincoln. At the time the stories caused some outrage since it associated Texas Jack with [[John Wilkes Booth]], and after publication Harris received several letters objecting to Texas Jack's portrayal and attempts to clear his name.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Harris|Harris (1900)]], p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#HarrisWooten|Harris; Wooten (1918)]], p. 427.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906, Verlagshaus für Volkslitteratur und Kunst, Berlin, published a series of dime novels in German, titled "''Texas Jack, Der Grosse Kundschafter''" (Texas Jack, The Great Scout). Inspired by Omohundro, the stories are of the fictional Jack Hawkins, an orphan who becomes a scout and cowboy in the American West engaging in skirmishes with Indians and opium smugglers, while some stories are set during the [[Utah War|Mormon War]] and in [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian's Mexico]]. In Germany the novels were republished in three subsequent series, and they were translated into eight languages - French "''Texas Jack, la Terreur Des Indiens''" (Texas Jack, the Terror of the Indians), Swedish "''Texas Jack, Amerikas mest berömde indianbekämpare''" (Texas Jack, Americas Famous Indian Fighter), Finnish, Danish, Polish, Dutch, Portuguese, and Italian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Story of Swedish Western Dime Novels|url=http://collector.pp.fi/TESTI/dimes_swedish.htm|website=Book Collector|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, [[Lion (comics)|Lion]], a weekly [[British comics|comic]] by [[Fleetway Publications|Fleetway]], published a series about Omohundro titled "''Texas Jack''", which was released in the United Kingdom and Australia after earlier success they had with other Western themed comics such as "''Cowboy Comics''", "''Buffalo Bill''", and "''Kit Carson''". Unlike earlier dime novels, they were formatted like comics, and the stories were illustrated using [[Panel (comics)|panels]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kibble-White|Kibble-White (2005)]], pp. 157–161.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, the Lion comics were translated into Spanish and reissued with new cover art by the Rollán publishing house of Madrid for distribution in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Texas Jack (1972, Rollán)|url=https://www.tebeosfera.com/publicaciones/texas_jack_1972_rollan.html|website=Asociación Cultural Tebeosfera|accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ficha Catálogo 32 - Texas Jack|url=http://vallatebeo.blog.galeon.com/1336662346/ficha-cat-logo-32-texas-jack-retapados-serie-b-serie-azul-editorial-roll-n-1973-/|website=Cuadernos de la Historieta Española|accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
[[File:Texas Jack Grave Tight.jpg|thumb|The grave of Texas Jack in Evergreen Cemetery]]
Texas Jack and Morlacchi settled in [[Massachusetts]] with a home in downtown [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]] and a small farm in [[Billerica, Massachusetts|Billerica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=M'lle Morlacchi and Her Farm|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85033673/1870-08-06/ed-1/seq-1/|accessdate=25 November 2017|publisher=Public Ledger (Memphis, Tenn.)|date=6 August 1870}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 1880, after several performances in the region the couple decided to sojourn in the silver-mining town of [[Leadville, Colorado]]. There Omohundro became acquainted with [[Horace Tabor]] and briefly joined Tabor's Light Cavalry, a local militia formed to kept order in the newly founded town.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Logan|Logan (1954)]], p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; A few months after arriving, Texas Jack contracted a cold which developed into pneumonia, he died weeks later. The funeral was well-attended, and he was given full military honors, with several military companies in attendance firing a [[three-volley salute]] as his flag-draped coffin was lowered into the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Racy Reminiscences - Love at First Sight|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn89066489/1884-05-28/ed-1/seq-2/|accessdate=16 May 2017|publisher=The Butler Weekly Times|date=May 28, 1884}}&lt;/ref&gt; His final resting place is Evergreen Cemetery in Leadville. Shortly after Texas Jack's death, Morlacchi returned to their home in Lowell. She never toured again.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Logan|Logan (1954)]], p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

After several years the grave fell into disrepair, and a traveling group of comedians raised funds to provide for its upkeep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Romance of a Scout|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84024546/1889-01-22/ed-1/seq-4/|accessdate=16 May 2017|publisher=Pittsburg Dispatch|date=Jan 22, 1889}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, while passing through Leadville, Cody visited the cemetery and commissioned a granite grave marker for his old friend, mistakenly listing Texas Jack's age as 39 years.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Omohundro|Omohundro (1950)]], p. 523.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, the Texas Jack Association was formed to preserve and promote Texas Jack's memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About TJA|url=http://texasjack.org/wp/about-the-texas-jack-association/|website=The Texas Jack Association|accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Texas Jack Omohundro was inducted into the [[National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum]] in the [[Hall of Great Western Performers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Great Western Performers|url=https://nationalcowboymuseum.org/awards-halls-of-fame/great-western-performers-2/|website=National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum|accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Description of Britain''''', also known by its [[Latin]] name '''''{{lang|la|De Situ Britanniae}}''''' ("On the Situation of Britain"), was a [[literary forgery]] perpetrated by [[Charles Bertram]] on the historians of [[English history|England]]. It purported to be a 15th-century&lt;!--sic--&gt; manuscript by the [[England in the Late Middle Ages|English]] monk [[Richard of Westminster]], including information from a lost contemporary account of [[Roman Britain|Britain]] by a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[dux|general]] (''{{lang|la|dux}}''),&lt;!--Not necessarily dux Brittaniarum--&gt; new details of the [[Roman roads in Britain]] in the style of the [[Antonine Itinerary]], and "an antient map" as detailed as (but improved upon) the works of [[Claudius Ptolemy|Ptolemy]]. Bertram disclosed the existence of the work through his correspondence with the antiquarian [[William Stukeley]] by 1748, provided him "a copy" which was made available in [[London]] by 1749, and published it in Latin in 1757. By this point, his Richard had become conflated with the historical [[Richard of Cirencester]]. The text was treated as a legitimate and major source of information on [[Roman Britain]] from the 1750s through the 19th century, when it was progressively debunked by [[John Hodgson (antiquary)|John Hodgson]], [[Karl Wex]], [[Bernard Bolingbroke Woodward|B. B. Woodward]], and [[John Eyton Bickersteth Mayor|J. E. B. Mayor]]. Effects from the forgery can still be found in works on British history and it is generally credited with having named the [[Pennine Mountains]].

[[Charles Bertram]] was an [[English people|English]] expatriate living in [[Copenhagen]]{{sfnp|Wilson|1869|p=180}} who began a flattering correspondence with the [[antiquarian]] [[William Stukeley]] in 1747 and was vouched for by [[Hans Gram (historian)|Hans Gram]], the royal librarian to [[list of kings of Denmark|King]]&amp;nbsp;[[Frederick V of Denmark|Frederick&amp;nbsp;V]].{{sfnp|Stukeley|1757|p=12}} After a few further letters, Bertram mentioned "a manuscript in a friend's hands of [[Richard of Westminster]],... a history of [[Roman Britain|Roman Brittain]]...&lt;!--sic--&gt; and an antient map of the island annex'd."{{sfnp|Stukeley|1757|pp=12–13}} A "copy" of its [[palaeography|script]] was shown to [[David Casley]], the keeper of the [[Cotton Library]], who "immediately" described it as around 400 years old.{{sfnp|Stukeley|1757|p=13}} Stukeley thereafter always treated Bertram as reliable. He "press'd Mr&amp;nbsp;Bertram to get the manuscript into his hands, if possible... as the greatest treasure we now can boast of in this kind of learning."{{sfnp|Stukeley|1757|p=13}} Stukeley received the text piecemeal over a series of letters which he made available at the [[Royal Society]]'s [[Arundel Library]] in London in 1749.{{sfnp|Poste|1853|p=140}} He had received a drawing of Bertram's map by early 1750,{{sfnp|Shirley|1990|p=2}} which he also placed at the library.{{sfnp|Poste|1853|p=140}}

==Authorship==
{{see also|Richard of Cirencester}}
Bertram described his text's author as "Richard, monk of Westminster" ({{lang-la|Ricardus monachus Westmonasteriensis}}). There had been a [[monk]] named Richard at [[Westminster Abbey]] in the mid-15th century and this was the approximate date offered by Bertram to Stukeley.{{sfnp|Barker|1990}} Stukeley preferred instead to identify Bertram's "Richard of Westminster" with [[Richard of Cirencester]] (''{{lang|la|Ricardus de Cirencestria}}''), who had lived at Westminster in the late 14th century and was known to have [[Christian pilgrimage|journeyed]] to [[Rome]] and to have compiled another history known as the ''[[Speculum Historiale de Gestis regum Angliæ|Historial Mirror]]''.{{sfnp|Stukeley|1757|p=5–6}} Bertram fully adopted the suggestion and published his account under the name ''{{lang|la|Ricardus Corinensis}}'',{{sfnp|Bertram|1757}} from the [[Corinium|archaic Latin form]] of [[Cirencester]]'s name.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

It has [[#Debunking|since become clear]] that the text was the work of an 18th-century forger. Bertram claimed to have borrowed the text from a friend who admitted he had come by it as an act of theft from an English library. Its complete absence from other manuscript lists and the lack of any trace of it among Bertram's surviving papers in Copenhagen has generally led to the conclusion that Bertram himself was Pseudo-Richard.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

{{anchor|The forgery}}

==Text==
Stukeley read his analysis of the work and its itineraries before the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]] and published his paper with its extracts in 1757.{{sfnp|Stukeley|1757}} He was excited that the text provided "more than a hundred names of cities, roads, people, and the like: which till now were absolutely unknown to us" and found it written "with great judgment, perspicuity, and conciseness, as by one that was altogether master of his subject".{{sfnp|Higgins|2013}} His account of the itineraries included an engraving reorienting [[#Map|Bertram's map]] to place north at the top.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Later in 1757,{{efn|This is the usual dating, derived from the volume's title page. In fact, the [[colophon (publishing)|colophon]] shows the edition was actually printed in 1758.{{sfnp|Bertram|1757}}}} at Stukeley's urging,{{sfnp|Stukeley|1757|p=13}}{{sfnp|Bertram|1757|loc=Praefatio, §I}} Bertram published the full text in a volume alongside [[Gildas]]'s ''[[The Ruin of Britain|Ruin of Britain]]'' and the ''[[Historia Brittonum|History of the Britons]]'' traditionally ascribed to [[Nennius]].{{sfnp|Bertram|1757}} Bertram's preface noted that the work "contains many fragments of a better time, which would now in vain be sought for elsewhere".{{efn|Latin: ''{{lang|la|Longe melioris ævi multos pannos purpuræ, &amp; fragmenta egregia continet, quæ singula frustra albi quæsiveris...}}''{{sfnp|Bertram|1757|loc=Praefatio, §I}}}}{{sfnp|Giles|1847|p=ix}} The preface goes on to note that, "considered by Dr.&amp;nbsp;Stukeley... a jewel... worthy to be rescued from destruction", Bertram printed it "from respect for him".{{efn|Latin: ''{{lang|la|Opusculum ipsum quod attinet, a Domino supra nominato, &amp; singulis, quibus videre contigit, habitum est}} {{lang|grc|{{linktext|κειμήλιον}}}}, {{lang|la|dignum, quod impressum ab interitu liberetur. Reverentiam erga ipsum quodammodo testandi gratia, imprimi illud curavi}}.''{{sfnp|Bertram|1757|loc=Praefatio, §I}}}}{{sfnp|Giles|1847|p=ix}} The volume included [[#Map|a map]] as well, differing from Stukeley's in several features apart from its orientation.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

It contained 18 routes ({{lang-la|itinera}}) of the type found in the [[Antonine Itinerary]],{{efn|These are excerpted and compared with other sources in [[Gilbert Dyer|Dyer]].{{sfnp|Dyer|1816|pp=34–178}}}} compiled from fragmentary accounts of a Roman general, adding over 60 new and previously unknown stations to those mentioned in the legitimate account. Best of all, it filled up the entire map of Scotland with descriptions and the names of peoples, the part of Britain about which the least was known with any certainty. It would later be determined that it was actually a clever mosaic of information gleaned from the works of [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], [[Tacitus]], [[William Camden]], [[John Horsley (antiquarian)|John Horsley]], and others, enhanced with Bertram's own fictions.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Bertram's letters to Stukeley proposed that the map accompanying the text was even older than Pseudo-Richard's text. His letters state that he bought a [[intaglio printing|copperplate]] to engrave it himself. Either this original copperplate or a freehand drawing was sent to Stukeley in late 1749 or early 1750{{sfnp|Shirley|1990|p=2}} and formed the basis of the version reoriented and published by Stukeley in his 1757 ''Account''.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Bertram's own engraving appeared in his 1757 ''Three Authors'' but was dated to 1755. It retained the "original" map's orientation, placing east at the top of the map, but did not disguise that Bertram had tidied it up. It is inscribed with a note that it was engraved and done entirely by Bertram. Stukeley later employed this version for the 2nd edition of his own ''{{lang|la|Itinerarium Curiosum}}'', published posthumously in 1776.{{sfnp|Bradley|1885}}

==Reception==

===Acceptance===
Once it had been accepted as genuine, ''The Description of Britain'' exerted a profound effect upon subsequent theories, suppositions, and publications of history. It was the premier source of information—sometimes the only source—for well over 100 years.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Contemporary authoritative works include [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]]'s ''[[Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', which is well-footnoted with his sources of information. ''De Situ Britanniae'' appears among his references to sources on ancient Britain, usually cited to its emended author, [[Richard of Cirencester]]. Major-General [[William Roy]]'s technical ability at surveying was the inspiration for the creation of the [[Ordnance Survey]]. He spent much of his research on [[History of Scotland|ancient Scottish history]] trying to follow the fictional itineraries described in ''De Situ Britanniae''.{{sfnp|Woodward|1866|p=304}} His historical work, ''[[Military Antiquities of the Romans in Britain]]'', relies on the forgery and is consequently lacking as a contribution to history, though his maps are still held in the highest regard. [[William Forbes Skene]], in his introduction to ''Celtic Scotland'', written after ''De Situ Britanniae'' was debunked, disparaged several once-influential histories that relied on it, including [[John Pinkerton|Pinkerton]]'s ''Enquiry'', [[George Chalmers (antiquarian)|Chalmers]]'s ''Caledonia'', Roy's ''Military Antiquities'', and Robert Stuart's ''Caledonia Romana''.

No serious modern historian cites an argument based on the fictional ''De Situ Britanniae'', but conclusions based upon it are still cited indirectly. For example, the influential and respected [[Barry Cunliffe]]'s ''Iron Age Communities in Britain'' places the ancient [[Selgovae]] people far to the east of their only known location, contradicting their placement by the sole legitimate source, [[Ptolemy]].{{sfnp|Ptolemy|1843|loc=Book&amp;nbsp;II, Ch.&amp;nbsp;iii, §8, p.&amp;nbsp;70}}{{sfnp|Ptolemy|2012}} This misplacement relied on William Roy's attempt to make the map of the peoples of ancient Scotland fit ''De Situ Britanniae''.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Debunking===
Enough doubts had arisen by 1838 that the [[English Historical Society]] did not include ''The Description of Britain'' in its list of important historical works.{{sfnp|Wilson|1869|p=195}} Still, the end did not come until 1845. In that year the German writer Karl Wex effectively challenged the authority of the ''Description'' in the ''Rheinisches Museum''.{{sfnp|Wex|1846}} He had been working on a new edition of [[Tacitus]]'s ''[[Agricola (book)|Agricola]]''.{{sfnp|Wilson|1869|p=196}} Consulting the ''Description'', he found that it included impossible [[transcription error]]s that had been introduced to editions of Tacitus by [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] printers in the 15th century.{{sfnp|Wex|1846}} His work was translated into English and printed by the ''[[Gentleman's Magazine]]'' in October 1846.{{sfnp|Cave|1846}}

British scholars were slow to accept the truth.{{sfnp|Wilson|1869|p=182}} Some of the routes mentioned by the work had seemed to have been subsequently borne out and excuses were made for the known errors. Further evidence of the falsity of ''The Description of Britain'' came out in the following years, however, until no serious effort could be made in defense of the document. Bertram had on several occasions adopted variant readings and hypotheses unknown before [[William Camden|Camden]].{{sfnp|Wilson|1869|p=197}} Scholars continued to hem both out of embarrassment (the same information that Wex used had been available to them all along) and because they now knew that their accounts of history had been based on a fiction rather than legitimate information. The final confirmation that the ''Description'' was spurious came in 1869, a quarter century after Wex's publication.{{sfnp|Mullinger|1911}} As part of the [[Rolls Series]], the ''Historial Mirror'' written by the real [[Richard of Cirencester]] (his only surviving work) was closely examined over the 1860s by [[John Eyton Bickersteth Mayor|J.E.B. Mayor]], the librarian of the [[University of Cambridge]]. In his 1869 preface to the second volume of the work, he included a thorough 90-page condemnation of Bertram's manuscript.{{sfnp|Mayor|1869}} Blame fell hardest on the reputation of [[William Stukeley]], although it also impugned [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]], [[William Roy|Roy]], and other scholars who had accepted it.{{sfnp|Mullinger|1911}}

===Revisionism===
Once the work was no longer defensible, various accounts came forward claiming that there had been serious doubts about the ''Description'' prior to Wex. These were somewhat less than accurate. In general, they attempted to conflate earlier concerns about "Richard of Cirencester"'s supposed sources or about his use of his sources with the more fundamental questions raised by Wex. An example is the 1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' account, which asserts that Thomas Reynolds was "skeptical as to the value of Bertram's manuscript".{{sfnp|Chisholm|1910}} Reynolds had been skeptical of the quality of Richard of Cirencester's information,{{sfnp|Reynolds|1799|p=v}}{{sfnp|Reynolds|1799|pp=119–120}} but did not express any doubts about Bertram or the validity of the manuscript.{{sfnp|Reynolds|1799|p=v}}{{sfnp|Reynolds|1799|p=xxiii}} Another tack of latter reviewers was to downplay the magnitude of the earlier acceptance and reliance on the ''Description''. In 1866 and 1867, [[Bernard Bolingbroke Woodward|B.B. Woodward]], the librarian of [[Windsor Castle]], wrote a series of articles for the ''Gentleman's Magazine'' that challenged the validity of the text.{{sfnp|Woodward|1866a}}{{sfnp|Woodward|1866b}}{{sfnp|Woodward|1866c}}{{sfnp|Woodward|1867}} However, his characterisation of ''The Description of Britain'' as "plainly a clumsy forgery by an unpractised hand"{{sfnp|Farrer|1907|p=36}}{{sfnp|Mayor|1869|p=clxii}} is unfair. This same document had been examined in 1749 by [[David Casley]], the keeper of the [[Cotton Library]],{{sfnp|Woodward|1866a|p=303}} and as late as 1840 Sir&amp;nbsp;[[Frederic Madden]] of the manuscript department of the [[British Museum]] had not only expressed his belief in its validity but also criticised the English Historical Society for its omission of the ''Description of Britain'' in its 1838 list of important works.{{sfnp|Farrer|1907|p=36}}

[[File:Pennines edited-1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Pennines]]]]

==Legacy==
Thanks to [[William Roy|Roy]] and others' reliance on the ''Description'', a number of its inventions found their way onto the [[Ordnance Survey]] maps. Another example of the ''Description''’s legacy were continuing references—including in the [[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica|1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']]—to a naval base at [[Dumbarton]] named Theodosia, long after its sole authority had been debunked.{{sfnp|MacPhail|1962}}

A passage in Bertram{{sfnp|Bertram|1809|p=51}} was credited in 1853 by [[Arthur Hussey]] as originating the name of the [[Pennines]].{{sfnp|Hussey|1853|p=272}} In 2004, [[George Redmonds]] reassessed this, finding that numerous respected writers passed over the origin of the mountains' name in silence even in works dedicated to the topological etymology of [[Derbyshire]] and [[Lancashire]].{{sfnp|Redmonds|2004|pp=65–67}} He found that the derivation from Bertram was widely believed and considered uncomfortable.{{sfnp|Redmonds|2004|pp=66–67}} In fact, the name appears at least as early as [[William Camden|Camden]] and Bertram was responsible (at most) with popularizing it against other contenders such as [[Daniel Defoe|Defoe]]'s "English Andes".{{sfnp|Redmonds|2004|pp=67–68}}

'''''The Devil Inside''''' is a [[horror fiction|horror]]-themed [[third-person shooter]] video game developed by Gamesquad and published by [[Cryo Interactive]] for the PC [[Windows]] in 2000.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Devil inside ingame.png|thumb|left|Dave takes aim at a shotgun-wielding Electrocuted Criminal]]

''The Devil Inside'' is presented as a [[reality television]] [[game show]] documenting the [[supernatural]] exploits of the [[protagonist]] Dave and his titular [[alter ego]], a [[succubus]] named Deva. The player can transform between Dave and Deva by activating pentagrams located at certain places throughout the game's levels. During gameplay, Dave/Deva is followed by a small flying camera as well as a cameraman, and the player can switch between the two camera views as desired. Occasionally, a news helicopter will also be present and scripted cutscenes will be viewed from an aerial perspective.

The pacing, exploration, and puzzle factor of the game is similar to that of other [[survival horror]] titles. As Dave, the player has access to a variety of guns, which are equipped with laser sights to assist the player in aiming. As Deva, the player uses spells to attack enemies. Spells do not require ammunition, but do deplete mana that regenerates slowly. Some enemies generate souls when killed, and Deva can inhale souls to replenish her mana. Deva also has the ability to fly and regenerate health when standing in fire. The game uses a checkpoint save system represented by television sets found in-game.

==Development==
The game's script was written by Hubert Chardot, better known for his work in the ''[[Alone in the Dark]]'' series.&lt;ref name="gamespot"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/adventure/devilinside/review.html?om_act=convert&amp;om_clk=gssummary&amp;tag=summary;review |title=The Devil Inside for PC review |accessdate=2008-06-17 |author=[[Greg Kasavin]] |date=2000-11-17 |publisher=[[GameSpot]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its theme is similar to ''[[The Running Man (novel)|The Running Man]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justadventure.com/reviews/Devil_Inside/Devil_Inside.shtm Review: The Devil Inside&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2000/may/25/onlinesupplement5 | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Games reviews | first=Greg | last=Howson | date=2000-05-25 | accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; written by [[Stephen King]], whose name is mentioned early in the game.

==Reception==
According to ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', ''The Devil Inside'' was commercially unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=spiegel&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://archive.is/QSZnj | url=http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/web/gamers-corner-reich-durch-computerspielen-a-136604.html | title=Reich durch Computerspielen | author=Schnelle, Martin | date=May 29, 2001 | work=[[Der Spiegel]] | archivedate=July 21, 2018 | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[GameSpot]]'s [[Greg Kasavin]] awarded the game a 6.8 out of 10, citing difficulties with the control scheme. In regards to the game's action sequences, Kasavin opined that "some of the battles are scripted very well. [...] But other times, the combat is poor." The environments of the game were praised for their realism and atmosphere, while character models and sound effects were rated as plain. Overall, the game was described as competent but lacking polish.&lt;ref name="gamespot"/&gt; ''[[PC Gamer|PC Gamer US]]'' gave the game a score of 79% in their January 2001 issue. The review praised the animations, camera angles, the use of a dual character, and the game's low learning curve. However, the review cited "poor polygonal figures and texturing", and some environmental bugs as the low points of the game.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In Poland, it was one of the first of the series of cheap premiere releases in the ''ExtraGra''  magazine. Shortly after the game's release, one of Poland's most popular TV stations, [[TVN (Poland)|TVN]] aired a report on the game, accusing the distributor, [[CD Projekt]] of selling [[satanism|satanic]] games in commonly accessible kiosks. &lt;ref&gt;http://polygamia.pl/extra-gra-pieklo-dziecko-lis-ksiadz-i-przedstawiciel-cdp/&lt;/ref&gt; The [[epilepsy]] warning, which by the time was already common among video games released in Poland and almost omnipresent in Europe, was used as an example of the game's exceptionally negative impact on young people.&lt;ref&gt;http://gry.wp.pl/artykul/wywiad,marcin-marzecki-devil-inside-w-faktach-2000,5436,1.html?ticket=5188007218622899eO%2F9ZA1B87BDCbeYtTPq1%2B3p5gnZFw3CXTicSpoZFhX6bBtAtjP62M2RH9f1mEOOkVB9Egj%2Bz7UcXIc3XjYjYUA8QE%2B%2Buef6e0TrgNE8JyWaqPj4uOR8OICkv4NQWlgDg5gEWAXeYREh8UbxZlfguQ%3D%3D&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"The Old Castle's Secret"''' is a 32-page [[funny animal]] [[comic book]] adventure/mystery/horror story written, drawn, and lettered by [[Carl Barks]]. It was first published by [[Dell Publishing]] in Four Color #189 (June 1948). Characters include [[Uncle Scrooge]], [[Donald Duck]], and [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]]. The story is about a [[treasure hunt]] led by Uncle Scrooge through an old castle in [[Scotland]]. It is the first of Uncle Scrooge's comic book treasure hunts. The story was published with three one-page gag stories by Barks. The cover is the first comic book cover ever drawn by Barks. The story has been reprinted many times.

==Plot==
Scrooge McDuck, in his second appearance, recruits his nephews to search for a family treasure back in Dismal Downs, the old [[castle]] of [[The Clan McDuck]], built in the middle of a swamp in [[Scotland]]. The treasure once belonged to [[Sir Quackly McDuck]], but both the treasure and its owner disappeared during the siege of 1057. The Clan has been searching for the treasure for centuries but Scrooge, the last McDuck, thinks that he can locate it thanks to an [[X-Ray]] machine that can examine through the castle's walls. 

Finding the treasure proves to be the easy part of the mission, but they have to face a mysterious ghost that steals the treasure from them and repeatedly tries to dispose of them. They can't see it but they can see its shadow, that of a [[skeleton]]. During this, Scottie, the caretaker of the castle, seems to have been murdered by Sir Quackly, and Scrooge, Donald, and the Nephews are trapped on a locked battlement. The Nephews escape by swinging across into the surrounding [[moat]], but can't get in. However, remembering the tale of Sir Swamphole McDuck who sealed the [[dungeons]] (due to the high cost of running a dungeon), they locate a secret passageway into the castle's dungeons through his fake grave site (his skeleton was inside his armor).

Scrooge and Donald remain on the battlement until Scrooge reveals he has a gun which can shoot the lock and unlock the door. Scrooge, embarrassed, tells Donald to give him "a good, swift kick!". While in the dungeon, the Nephews find the treasure box but are nearly attacked by the ghost and find the other way out of the dungeon; the pillar upon which Sir Swamphole's armor is resting is actually a door. Scrooge, Donald, and Huey, Dewey, and Louie find the invisibility spray and give chase to the ghost, now covered in mud and no longer invisible, through the swamp. The nephews and Donald tackle him to the ground and retrieve the treasure box. The ghost is revealed to be a thief who was impersonating Scottie (who had died of old age years before) using a special spray-like formula that made him invisible but did not prevent his skeleton from casting a shadow. Donald then takes all the nephews' credit; they hadn't known the invisibility spray even existed). Enraged, the nephews then trick Donald into thinking the spray is a [[mosquito]] repellent, where they then make him completely invisible save his tail and legs.

==Analysis==
The story is usually referred to as one of Barks' most memorable for several reasons. The plot borrows elements of horror and mystery stories, favorites of Barks; the old and mostly abandoned castle with its dark halls, hidden dungeons and crypts; ancestors' skeletons buried within the castle; the ancient McDuck cemetery with the graves of generations of the main characters' ancestors; the misty swamp, the threatening "ghost", and the imminent danger the characters sense. Barks detailed every panel to afford a sense of melancholy suitable for this rather moody story, and used pictures of old Scottish castles as references to add to the story's realism. "The Old Castle's Secret" is considered to be among Barks' best drawing efforts.

"The Old Castle's Secret" marks the second appearance of Scrooge in a story but the first where Scrooge acts as the leader in a treasure expedition, a theme that Barks would use often for an Uncle Scrooge story. It introduces the Clan McDuck and gives a family history to the characters that would later be expanded by both Barks and his successors and firmly sets the character's origin in [[Scotland]] where a number of later stories would take place. Dismal Downs itself has been used as a setting for other stories, with its history and architecture expanded.

'''''Uncharted: Golden Abyss''''' is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[Platform game|platform]] [[video game]], the fourth entry in the ''[[Uncharted]]'' series. It is the first portable entry in the series, released for the [[PlayStation Vita]]. It was developed by [[SIE Bend Studio]], with development overseen by [[Naughty Dog]]. The game was released as a launch title in Japan on December 17, 2011. It was launched in North America on February 14, 2012, Europe on February 22, 2012 and Australia on February 23, 2012.&lt;ref name=PS3Maven&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ps3maven.com/new-psp-games/|title=Portable Uncharted|date=2011-03-07|publisher=PS3 Maven|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GoldenAbyss"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5805966/playing-uncharted-golden-abyss-is-a-sublime-testament-to-the-ngp |title=Uncharted Golden Abyss Delivers a Home Console Experience |author=Brian Crecente |date=June 2, 2011 |work=[[Kotaku]] |publisher=[[Gawker Media]] |accessdate=May 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Set some time before the first game, the story follows Nathan Drake as he teams up with fellow treasure hunter Marisa Chase to find the lost city of Quivira, while dealing with crooked treasure hunter Jason Dante and his partner, warlord Roberto Guerro.

==Plot==
The story is set some time before the events of ''[[Uncharted: Drake's Fortune]]'', and begins [[in medias res]] with Nathan Drake following rival explorer Jason Dante through a temple complex in [[Panama]]. Dante has ordered his army of mercenaries to kill Drake on sight, and after a series of gunfights, the platform Drake is climbing is hit by an [[Rocket-propelled grenade|RPG]].

The game then flashes back two weeks, when Drake and Dante, revealed to be old friends, arrive at a dig site in Panama headed by Dante's "partner" Marisa Chase, who doesn't trust him. At the site, they find corpses of Spanish [[conquistador]]s that were apparently poisoned and a grave marker with a [[Visigoth]] symbol. Chase also shows Drake an amulet that she hid from Dante. The dig is then interrupted by Dante's real partner, warlord Roberto Guerro. Guerro captures Drake and Chase, however they escape Guerro's base after Chase starts a diversionary fire.

They then go to the house of her grandfather Vincent Perez, who found the amulet at the site. Perez hired Dante to conduct further research after being diagnosed with terminal cancer, and Dante paid off Guerro for access to the site in return for a share of the treasure that Guerro will use to fund his conflict. Chase arrived at the site herself hoping to finish Perez's work. Upon returning to Perez's study, they learn that the marker referred to the Sete Cidades, an ancient Christian sect dedicated to finding the [[Seven Cities of Gold]]. [[Marcos de Niza|Friar Marcos de Niza]], a member of the sect, had led [[Francisco Vásquez de Coronado#Mounting the expedition|Coronado's expedition to find the city of Cíbola]], also known as [[Quivira]], only to find the villages of the [[Zuni people|Zuni]].

Following further clues, one referring to a "Sword of Stephen", they follow Perez's trail to a ruined Sete Cidades retreat. They find Perez, who succumbed to his illness, as well as evidence that leads Drake to suspect that de Niza had deliberately misled Coronado for reasons unknown. Drake then follows the ruins to a crypt that contains the Sword of Stephen - the personal sword of [[Estevanico|Esteban]], de Niza's guide; however, they are interrupted by Dante, who had followed them with Guerro.

Guerro takes the sword and Chase after pushing Dante off a balcony for insulting him. Drake reluctantly teams up with Dante to escape the ruins and Guerro's army, but are unable to stop Guerro from escaping with her. Dante decides to hire an army of mercenaries to rescue Chase and avenge himself on Guerro, and the two part ways after Drake objects. Although hesitant at first, Drake convinces Victor "Sully" Sullivan to help him find Chase and finish Perez's work. The two follow a map made from the charcoal rubbings of symbols found on the sword to a temple complex believed to house the entrance to Quivira. There they witness and fight through a battle between Dante's mercenaries and Guerro's men. Sully is injured in a fall, forcing Drake to continue by himself.

Drake then fights through more of Dante's mercenaries - surviving the explosion from the prologue - and makes his way to the massive entrance of Quivira where he rescues Chase from the remnants of Guerro's army. After Chase insists that they continue, Drake uses the amulet on the gate to open it. The pair then cross a massive underground lake and make it to the Golden Abyss, a massive room whose walls are lined with gold. They also find the corpse of Esteban, who was sacrificed by Marcos. A geiger counter stowed in Chase's backpack then suddenly activates and reveals the gold to be radioactive. Realizing that the Quiviran populace had died out from [[Acute radiation syndrome|radiation poisoning]], they conclude that de Niza had sacrificed Esteban and his scouting party before deliberately misleading Coronado in order to prevent them from looting the irradiated gold.

However, Dante arrives and reveals that he knew about the radiation, while still intending to sell the irradiated gold on the black market anyway. Drake defeats him in a fist fight and escapes with Chase as Dante verbally admonishes him for valuing principles above money. When they return to the gate, Chase detonates explosives that Guerro had planted beforehand, sealing Dante in the cavern for good. As the two escape the ensuing cave-in, Guerro appears and attacks them with a rocket launcher, trapping Chase under a fallen pillar. Drake fights and tricks Guerro into falling through a damaged bridge to his death with the Sword of Stephen. He then frees Chase and the two escape to the surface with Sully's help. Before they leave in a helicopter stolen by Sully, she tosses away the amulet, believing it belongs "in hell" with the rest of Quivira. It is also implied that the two start a relationship following the climax of the game.

== Development ==

On June 2, 2011, the official title for the game was unveiled as ''Golden Abyss'', and numerous hands-on previews of the game were released across several sites. This was the first public appearance of the game since its unveiling in January.&lt;ref name="GoldenAbyss"/&gt; Prior to the announcement though in May 2011, it was rumored that the game's title would be ''Uncharted: Golden Abyss'', before any official announcement from Sony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ripten.com/2011/05/29/uncharted-golden-abyss-coming-to-the-playstation-vita-brycew/ |title=Is "Uncharted: Golden Abyss" Coming to the "PlayStation Vita" (NGP)? |author=Bryce Wilson |date=May 29, 2011 |work= |publisher=RipTen |accessdate=May 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game features touch and motion based controls for navigation and aiming, though these are optional control schemes.&lt;ref name="GoldenAbyss"/&gt; The game was developed by Sony Bend Studio, who were being overseen by Naughty Dog. The game has an optional touchscreen control feature and motion sensitive controls. In a demo at E3 2011, it was shown that weapons can be picked up and reloaded by tapping the weapon icon on-screen. Bend studio creative director John Garvin confirmed that Naughty Dog allowed them to use their mo-cap and voice-over studios. It was also confirmed that the game would contain over 2 hours of cutscenes. The game doesn't run on the full resolution of the [[OLED]] screen of the Vita (960 x 544), instead it runs about half the native resolution (720 x 408)

Nolan North revealed in an interview that he would return to play Drake, lending his voice acting talents along with motion capture work, as in the console games. He revealed as well that the story was also being written by Garvin. According to a motion capture video released from PlayStation, [[Richard McGonagle]] would be returning as well, reprising his role as [[List of Uncharted characters#Victor "Sully" Sullivan|Victor Sullivan]]. Naughty Dog co-president Christophe Balestra confirmed the game's stance in the franchise, as well as suggesting a greater focus on exploration rather than gunplay.

The 1.01 update added "Black Market", an in-game store which enables players to trade and receive bounty items that are collected in the game with other Vita players using the PS Vita's "NEAR" application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2012/02/13/uncharted-golden-abyss-opens-the-black-market/|title=Uncharted: Golden Abyss Opens The Black Market - Playstation Blog|date=February 13, 2012|accessdate=February 13, 2012|publisher=Sony|work=PlayStation Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, the patch also prepared the game to use the Treasure Map DLC pack. Patch update 1.02 fixed bugs and issues. Patch 1.03 enables players to unlock cards based on game collectibles for the upcoming ''Uncharted: Fight for Fortune'' game, and also improves the bounty drop from enemies.

=== Downloadable content ===
The Treasure Map [[downloadable content]] (DLC) adds a treasure map for each chapter to help players easily locate all the collectibles in a chapter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2012/02/21/excavate-the-uncharted-golden-abyss-treasure-map-pack-this-wednesday/|title=Excavate the UNCHARTED: Golden Abyss Treasure Map Pack this Wednesday - Playstation Blog|date=February 21, 2012|accessdate=February 21, 2012|publisher=Sony|work=PlayStation Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
The musical score for'' Uncharted: Golden Abyss'' was composed by Sony PlayStation's Clint Bajakian and was the first major video game score recorded with full orchestra at Ocean Way Studios in Nashville with a 70 piece orchestra led and contracted by Alan Umstead of Nashville Music Scoring.

The game received generally positive reviews. ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' gave it a 7/10, commenting that "A story worthy of the franchise, ''Uncharted: Golden Abyss'' falls short in terms of pacing and controls, as the touchscreen gimmick takes the experience down a big notch."&lt;ref name="EGM"/&gt; ''[[Eurogamer]]'' gave it an 8/10, stating that "While the absence of multiplayer means it won't last you as long as previous instalments, new control options have allowed the developers to line the seams of Drake's adventure with flashy tassels and detailing that make for a varied and entertaining outing - perhaps even more so than its big brothers."&lt;ref name="EuroG"/&gt; ''[[Game Informer]]'' giving it an 8/10, commented "For the first time, we're able to play a handheld game with the scale and production values of a home console title. The base level of craftsmanship on display in ''Golden Abyss'' means you'll get your money's worth – but not a penny more. I wish all the perspiration expelled in the making of the game had been complemented by a bit more inspiration."&lt;ref name="GI"/&gt; [[Game Revolution]] gave it 4 out of 5 stars, noting that "[...] all the game's complaints won't detract from the simple fact that this is Uncharted on a handheld. It's just slightly diminished. ''Golden Abyss'' is more like ''Drake's Fortune'' than it is ''Deception''-it doesn't span that many environments, has smaller set pieces, and lacks online multiplayer."&lt;ref name="GameRev"/&gt;

[[GameSpot]] gave it a 7/10, feeling that "''Golden Abyss'' is full of disappointments. The action set pieces are great, but there's too few of them; the voice acting is exemplary, but the narrative doesn't do it justice; the touch and motion controls work well for some actions, but they ruin others. For every moment of enjoyment you have, something comes along to spoil it. Despite its problems, though, Golden Abyss still succeeds in delivering some intense, entertaining action and combat."&lt;ref name="GSpot"/&gt; [[GamesRadar]] gave it an 8/10, citing that "It's mostly there - the charm, the gameplay, the visual presentation - but there are some key elements missing. The level design leaves much to be desired, and without the cinematic moments the experience simply isn't incredibly strong. It's still an extremely solid cover shooter with a strong story and some fine platforming elements, but as far as an Uncharted game, it comes up short of what we've come to expect."&lt;ref name="GRadar"/&gt; [[GameTrailers]] gave it an 8.6/10, calling the game "A powerful tech demo for the PlayStation Vita, but it's also an engaging game that's a blast to play in spurts. Touch screen use is a little heavy-handed and it's missing those 'wow' moments we're used to getting from the franchise, but it's a solid action adventure with production values strong enough to quell any sense of system buyer's remorse."&lt;ref name="GT"/&gt; [[IGN]]'s [[Greg Miller (Internet personality)|Greg Miller]] gave it an 8.5/10, stating that "The game is great and an impressive launch title for the PlayStation Vita. It's just that the ''Uncharted'' series has been known for being a story-driven experience, and Golden Abyss goes in another direction. It's a beautiful, fun game with tons of collectibles, plenty of laughs, and some cool twists on a franchise PlayStation fans know so well. It's just not an instant classic like the other entries in the series."&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; Anthony Severino of PlayStation LifeStyle gave the game a 9.5 out of 10 score in the first full review of the game.&lt;ref name="PSL"/&gt;

In [[Cinema of Germany|German film history]], an '''Überläufer''' (literally ''[[defector]]'') is a film that was in production under the [[Third Reich]] but only completed and premiered after the end of the [[Second World War]]. The vast majority of such films are [[romantic comedy|romantic comedies]] with no reference to the political and military situation of the time.
