[[File:René-Antoine Houasse - Minerve et Arachne (Versailles).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''[[Minerva]] and Arachne'', [[René-Antoine Houasse]], 1706]]

In [[Greek mythology]] (and later [[Roman mythology]]), '''Arachne''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|r|æ|k|n|iː}}; from {{lang-grc-gre|ἀράχνη}} "spider", cognate with [[Latin]] ''[[araneus]]'')&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; was a talented mortal weaver who challenged [[Athena]], goddess of wisdom and crafts, to a weaving contest; this [[hubris]] resulted in her being transformed into a [[spider]]. There are many versions of the story's weaving contest, with each saying that one or the other won.

== Biography ==
Arachne was a [[Lydians|Lydian]] maiden who was the daughter of [[Idmon]] of [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]], who was a famous dyer in purple.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''Metamorphoses'', 6. 8&lt;/ref&gt; She was credited to have invented linen cloth and nets while her son Closter introduced the use of spindle in the manufacture of wool. She was said to have been a native of [[Hypaepa|Hypæpæ]], near Colophon in [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]]. ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0137:book=7:chapter=57&amp;highlight=arabus#note10 Book 7.56.3];'' According to Justin, B. ii. c. 6, the Athenians introduced the use of wool among their countrymen; but it has been supposed that they learned it from the Egyptians. As we have sufficient evidence that linen was manufactured by the Egyptians at a very early period, we may presume that this account of Arachne is either fabulous, or that, in some way or other, she was instrumental in the introduction of linen into Greece.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==

===Ovid's version===
[[File:Antonio Tempesta Arachne.jpg|thumb|''[[Athena]] and Arachne'' ([[Antonio Tempesta]])]]

One version appears in the ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' of the Roman poet [[Ovid]].

In this version, Arachne was a shepherd's daughter who began weaving at an early age. She became a great weaver, boasted that her skill was greater than that of Athena, and refused to acknowledge that her skill came, in part at least, from the goddess. Athena took offense and set up a contest between them. Presenting herself as an old lady, she approached the boasting girl and warned: "You can never compare to any of the gods. Plead for forgiveness and Athena might spare your soul."

"Ha! I only speak the truth and if Athena thinks otherwise then let her come down and challenge me herself," Arachne replied. Athena removed her disguise and appeared in shimmering glory, clad in a sparkling white chiton. The two began weaving straight away. Athena's weaving represented four separate contests between mortals and the gods in which the gods punished mortals for setting themselves as equals of the gods. Arachne's weaving depicted ways that the gods had misled and abused mortals, particularly Zeus, tricking and seducing many women. When Athena saw that Arachne had not only insulted the gods but done so with a work far more beautiful than Athena's own, she was enraged. She ripped Arachne's work to shreds and hit her on the head three times. Terrified and ashamed, Arachne hanged herself. Then Athena said, "Live on then, and yet hang, condemned one, but, lest you are careless in
future, this same condition is declared, in punishment, against your descendants, to the last generation!" After saying this she sprinkled her with the juice of Hecate's herb, and immediately at the touch of this dark poison, Arachne's hair fell out. With it went her nose and ears, her head shrank to the smallest size, and her whole body became tiny. Her slender fingers stuck to her sides as legs, the rest is belly, from which she still spins a thread, and, as a spider, weaves her ancient web."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kline|first1=A.S,|title=Ovid - the Metamophoses|url=http://tikaboo.com/library/Ovid-Metamorphosis.pdf|website=Tikaboo|publisher=A.S. kline|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This showed how goddesses punished mortals who dared to insult them.

==Influence==
[[File:Velazquez-las hilanderas.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Las hilanderas (Velázquez)|''The Spinners, or, The Fable of Arachne'']] (1644–48) by [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]].]]
The [[Linnaean taxonomy|taxonomical]] class name ''[[Arachnida]]'' and the name for spiders in many [[romance languages]] are both derived from ''arachne''.

The metamorphosis of Arachne in Ovid's telling furnished material for an episode in [[Edmund Spenser]]'s mock-heroic ''[[Muiopotmos]]'', 257–352.&lt;ref&gt;Written c. 1590 and published in ''[[Complaints (Spenser)|Complaints]]'', 1591. Spenser's allusion to Arachne in ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', ii, xii.77, is also noted in Reed Smith, "The Metamorphoses in ''Muiopotmos''" ''Modern Language Notes'' '''28'''.3 (March 1913), pp. 82-85.&lt;/ref&gt; Spenser's adaptation, which "rereads an Ovidian story in terms of the Elizabethan world" is designed to provide a rationale for the hatred of Arachne's descendent Aragnoll for the butterfly-hero Clarion.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Brinkley, "Spenser's ''Muiopotmos'' and the Politics of Metamorphosis" ''[[ELH]]'' '''48'''.4 (Winter 1981, pp. 668-676) p 670. Brinkley makes a case for Spenser's episode as political allegory of Elizabeth's court.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dante Alighieri]] uses Arachne in [[Inferno_(Dante)#Seventh_Circle_(Violence)|Canto XVII]] of ''[[Inferno_(Dante)|Inferno]]'', the first part of ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'', to describe the horrible monster [[Geryon]]. "... his back and all his belly and both flanks were painted arabesques and curlicues: the Turks and Tartars never made a fabric with richer colors intricately woven, nor were such complex webs spun by Arachne."&lt;ref&gt;[[Dante Alighieri]], ''The Divine Comedy, Volume 1: Inferno''. Canto XVII, lines 15-18 (pp. 223-224). Translated by Mark Musa.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The tale of Arachne inspired one of [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]]' most factual paintings: ''[[Las hilanderas (Velázquez)|Las Hilanderas]]'' ("The Spinners, or The fable of Arachne", in the [[Prado]]), in which the painter represents the two important moments of the myth. In the front, the contest of Arachne and the goddess (the young and the old weaver), in the back, an ''Abduction of Europa'' that is a copy of [[Titian]]'s version (or maybe of [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]]' copy of Titian). In front of it appears Minerva (Athena) at the moment she punishes Arachne. It transforms the myth into a reflection about creation and imitation, god and man, master and pupil (and therefore about the nature of art).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La légende d'Arachné|url=http://www.cineclubdecaen.com/peinture/peintres/velazquez/arachne.htm|accessdate=20 February 2013|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that [[Jeremias Gotthelf]]'s nineteenth century novella, ''[[The Black Spider]]'', was heavily influenced by the Arachne story from Ovid's ''[[Metamorphoses]]''.&lt;ref&gt;David Gallagher, "The Transmission of Ovid's Arachne Metamorphosis in Jeremias Gotthelf's Die Schwarze Spinne"'', Neophilologus ''(2008) 92: 699-711&lt;/ref&gt; In the novella, a woman is turned into a venomous spider having reneged on a deal with the devil.

==In popular culture==
[[File:Pendule met Arachne en Athene - Meissen porselein 001.JPG|thumb|Pendule with Arachne and Athena in [[Meissen porcelain]], attributed to Johann Gottlieb Kirchner and George Fritzsche (1727)]]
Arachne has had a considerable degree of influence on modern popular culture. She frequently appears in modern [[fantasy]] books, movies, and television series in the form of a monstrous spider. In ''[[Hercules: The Legendary Journeys]]'', she is pictured as a grotesque, half-woman, half-spider monster who nests on people to produce killer spiders. She is the central character in the 2011 novel ''The Spider Goddess'' by [[Tara Moss]]. In ''[[Class of the Titans]]'', Arachne is changed into a giant spider and makes a deal with Cronus to become human again. Cronus does not hold up the end of his bargain though and betrays her after getting her to trap the heroes for him. After being berated by Atlanta, Athena turns Arachne back into a human, and she is allowed to live at the Olympus High School, weaving for the gods.

In the 13th episode from season 6 of ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'', "Unforgiven", the monster of the week is an Arachne, depicted as a humanoid monster with spider-like attributes and abilities, including the ability to weave strong webs and a poisonous bite that can turn other humans into Arachnes. They can only be killed by decapitation and before one appeared in [[Bristol, Rhode Island]] hadn't been seen in 2,000 years. While soulless, [[Sam Winchester]] hunted one, but was unaware that it had turned its victims into Arachnes as well. One of the turned victims comes back for revenge and Sam is forced to kill him. 

Arachne is also featured in the ''[[Percy Jackson]]'' and ''[[Heroes of Olympus]]'' series. All of Athena's children, including Annabeth Chase, are arachnophobic because of Arachne's dispute with Athena. Arachne appears towards the end of ''[[The Mark of Athena]]'' as a large spider while still maintaining human features. She is defeated by Annabeth because of her pride and eventually they are both sent falling into [[Tartarus]], where Percy Jackson kills Arachne.

In the novel ''[[The Last Unicorn]]'' written by [[Peter S. Beagle]], a plain brown spider is bewitched into believing that she is Arachne until the witch who enchanted her is killed. She is mentioned to be one of the creatures in Mommy Fortuna's Midnight Carnival. The book describes Arachne as "'...the greatest weaver in the world—her fate's the proof of it. She had the bad luck to defeat the goddess Athena in a weaving contest. Athena was a sore loser, and Arachne is now a spider, creating only for Mommy Fortuna's Midnight Carnival, by special arrangement. Warp of snow and woof of flame, and never any two the same. Arachne.'"&lt;ref&gt;Beagle, Peter Soyer. The Last Unicorn. 1968. New York, Penguin Group, 1991. [Page 21.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Marvel Comics]], Arachne is the name used by the second Spider-Woman ([[Julia Carpenter]], currently the new Madame Web) to distinguish herself from [[Jessica Drew]], the original Spider-Woman. In Volume 3 of ''[[Monster Musume]]'', an Arachne (a human female from the hips upward and the body/legs of a spider) named Rachnera Arachnera is introduced; she goes on to become a member of the "Monster Girl" household in Volume 4. Arachne Gorgon is a powerful witch and one of the main antagonists of ''[[Soul Eater (manga)|Soul Eater]]''. She was responsible for crafting the first demon weapons, an act that [[Death (personification)|Death]] fiercely opposed, forcing her to bide her time and remain in hiding for 800 years. She returns to lead the risen Arachnaphobia, her personal army against Death.

The story of Arachne has also been adapted for many plays. She is the inspiration for a character featured in the [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] musical ''[[Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark]]''. ''Arachne: Spider Girl!'' is a play for children based on the myth by [[Ursula Dubosarsky]],  first published in the NSW [[School Magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/Arachne-Spider-Children-Metamorphoses-ebook/dp/B00AA7IGJU |title=Arachne: Spider Girl! (Plays for Children based on Ovid's Metamorphoses Book 8) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gustave Doré]]'s illustration of Arachne's punishment in [[Purgatory]] for Dante's ''[[Purgatorio]]'' has had a surprising number of pop culture appearances. It is one of the many recurring images used by the rock band, [[The Mars Volta]]; it has been used in the cover of their ''[[Live (The Mars Volta EP)|Live]]'' EP, as a backdrop for their live shows, and a favorite accessory for guitarist and composer [[Omar Rodríguez-López]] in the form of a belt buckle. [[Eminem]]'s 2013 music video for the song "Rap God" features imagery from Dante's ''Purgatorio'', including the illustration of Arachne. (This is most likely a metaphor for the rappers who try to compete with the self-proclaimed "Rap God").

On Episode 245 of the Comedy Bang! Bang! Podcast, Comedian Neil Campbell references Arachne and Athena's rivalry during a freestyle rap battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/earwolf/clip-scott-aukerman-amy-1|title=Clip: Scott Aukerman, Amy Poehler, Paul F. Tompkins, Neil Campbell - Freestyle Rap Battle|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earwolf.com/episode/poehler-ice-caps/|title=Poehler Ice Caps, episode #245 of Comedy Bang Bang: The Podcast on Earwolf|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the popular MOBA game, ''[[Smite (video game)|Smite]]'', Arachne is listed as a playable deity in the Greek pantheon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smitegame.com/gods/arachne/|title=Arachne|website=SMITE|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a short story "More Spinned Against" [[John Wyndham]] tells of how Arachne finds herself in the clutches of a spider-obsessed collector and of the deal she makes with the collector's wife Lydia.

| Each team is given one possession from its opponent's twenty-five yard line with no game clock. The team leading after both possessions is declared the winner. If the teams remain tied, overtime periods continue; games cannot end in a tie. Teams that possesses the ball first in each period alternates.

==Overview==
{{see also|List of NCAA Division I FBS football programs|List of NCAA Division I FCS football programs}}
The NFL consists of [[2002 NFL season#Expansion and realignment|thirty-two clubs]] divided into two conferences of sixteen teams each. Each conference is divided into four divisions of four clubs each.
The NFL season format consists of a four-week [[National Football League preseason|preseason]], a seventeen-week [[National Football League regular season|regular season]], and a twelve-team [[NFL Playoffs|single-elimination playoff]] culminating in the [[Super Bowl]], the league's championship game.
College teams mostly play other similarly sized schools through the NCAA's divisional system. [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] generally consists of the major collegiate athletic powers with larger budgets, more elaborate facilities, and more athletic scholarships. [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] primarily consists of smaller public and private institutions that offer fewer scholarships than those in Division I. [[NCAA Division III|Division III]] institutions also field teams, but do not offer any scholarships.
Football teams in Division I are further divided into the [[Football Bowl Subdivision|Bowl Subdivision]] (consisting of the largest programs) and the [[NCAA Football Championship Subdivision|Championship Subdivision]].
The Bowl Subdivision (FBS) previously did not have an organized tournament to determine its champion; instead, teams competed in post-season [[list of college bowl games|bowl games]].  Up through the 2013 season, the BCS National Championship game determined the national champion.  The game featured the #1 and #2 teams in the BCS rankings, a mixture of computer and human polls ranking the top teams in the country.  Beginning in the 2014 season, a 4-team playoff now determines the national champion.  The four teams competing in the [[College Football Playoff]] are decided by a 13-member selection committee using a complex set of selection criteria and each committee member valuing certain selection criteria differently. These criteria include Strength of Schedule, Conference Championships, Win-Loss Record, On-field play, non-conference schedule and much more.  The importance of traditional major bowl games will be preserved by using 2 of the 6 major bowls as the semi-finals of the playoff while the remaining 4 will incorporate traditional conference "tie-ins" to schedule teams in each bowl game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegefootballplayoff.com/overview|title=Overview - College Football Playoff|publisher=|accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Championship Subdivision utilizes a college football playoff, the [[NCAA Division I Football Championship]].  As of 2014, 24 teams are selected for the playoff.  Similar to the NCAA College Basketball Tournament, each conference champion received an automatic bid to the tournament.  The remaining tournament berths are awarded as "at-large" selections by a selection committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.com/interactive-bracket/football/fcs|title=2016 FCS Championship Bracket|publisher=|accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chicago===
In [[2002 Chicago Bears season|2002]], the [[Soldier Field]] was closed and rebuilt with only the exterior wall of the stadium being preserved. It was closed on Sunday, January 20, 2002, a day after the Bears lost in the [[2001–02 NFL playoffs|playoffs]]. It reopened on September 27, 2003 after a complete rebuild (the second in the stadium's history).&lt;ref name="Wrigley Field"&gt;{{cite web | title = Soldier Field History | work = BearsHistory.com | url = http://www.bearshistory.com/lore/soldierfieldhistory.aspx |accessdate = July 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many fans refer to the rebuilt stadium as "New Soldier Field".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Soldier Field History |work=ChicagoBears.com |url=http://www.chicagobears.com/history/sf_facts.jsp |accessdate=July 16, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051205064756/http://www.chicagobears.com/history/sf_facts.jsp |archivedate=December 5, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the {{nfly|2002}} season, the Bears played their home games at the University of Illinois' [[Memorial Stadium (Champaign)|Memorial Stadium]] in [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]], where they went 3–5.

===Cleveland===
[[Cleveland Stadium]] hosted the annual [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]]/[[Navy Midshipmen football|Navy]] college football game 11 times: in 1932, 1934, 1939, 1942, 1943, 1945, 1947, 1950, 1952, 1976 and 1978. The games were well attended, with an average attendance of 69,730 and a high of 84,090 fans for the 1947 game, which was won by Notre Dame 27-0. The only [[Great Lakes Bowl]] was held there in 1947. Local colleges [[Case Institute of Technology]] and [[Western Reserve University]] used the field from time to time as well. The [[Illinois Fighting Illini]] played the [[Penn State Nittany Lions]] there in 1959. The [[Ohio State Buckeyes]] played in the stadium four times. The first was in a 1942 win over Illinois before 68,656, the second a 1943 loss to Purdue, and the third a 1944 victory over Illinois. The final college football contest played there was on October 19, 1991, when the [[Northwestern Wildcats]] played a "home" game against the Buckeyes. While Northwestern received the home team's share of the gate receipts, the crowd was mostly Ohio State fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Toman|first=James A.|title=Cleveland Stadium: Sixty Years of Memories|year=1994|publisher=Cleveland Landmarks Press, Inc.|location=Cleveland, Ohio|isbn=0-936760-09-5|pages=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ohio Classic]] [[college football]] game was held at [[FirstEnergy Stadium (Cleveland)|FirstEnergy Stadium]] in both 2004 and 2005.

===Detroit===
In college sports, Detroit's central location within the Mid-American Conference has made it a frequent site for the league's championship events. While the MAC Basketball Tournament moved permanently to [[Cleveland]] starting in 2000, the MAC Football Championship Game has been played at Ford Field in Detroit since 2004, and annually attracts 25,000 to 30,000 fans. The [[University of Detroit Mercy]] has a  [[NCAA Division I]] program, and [[Wayne State University]] has both NCAA Division I and [[NCAA Division II|II]] programs. The NCAA football [[Little Caesars Pizza Bowl]] is held at Ford Field each December.

===Green Bay===
When built, [[Lambeau Field]] was also slated to be used by Green Bay's public high schools, as old City Stadium had been. However, a key [[1962 NFL season|1962]] game between the [[1962 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]] and [[1962 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]] was affected when two high schools played in the rain the preceding Friday, damaging the field. After that, Lombardi asked the schools to avoid using Lambeau, however both Southwest High and West High played there until a high school stadium was built in the late 1970s. In 1970, Green Bay's Premontre High School (the alma mater of Lombardi's son, Vince Jr., which has since been merged into [[Notre Dame Academy (Green Bay, Wisconsin)|Notre Dame Academy]]) hosted (and won) the state private school football championship.In 1982 and 1983, [[St. Norbert College]] hosted [[Fordham University]] (Lombardi's [[alma mater]]) in benefit games to fight cancer. Shortly after the 2006 Wisconsin–Ohio State hockey game, newspaper reports said the Wisconsin football team might be interested in moving a non-conference road game to Lambeau Field. In 2016, Lambeau Field will host the [[Wisconsin Badgers football|Wisconsin Badgers]] vs. [[LSU Tigers football|LSU Tigers]] in the 2nd of a two-game series starting in 2014, where the game is in [[Houston]] at [[Reliant Stadium]].

===Jacksonville===
[[College sports]], especially [[college football]], are popular in Jacksonville. The city hosts the [[Florida–Georgia game]], an annual [[college football]] game between the [[University of Florida]] and the [[University of Georgia]], and the [[TaxSlayer Bowl]], a post-season college [[bowl game]]. Jacksonville's two universities compete in [[NCAA]] [[NCAA Division I|Division I]]: the [[University of North Florida]] [[North Florida Ospreys|Ospreys]] and the [[Jacksonville University]] [[Jacksonville Dolphins|Dolphins]], both in the [[Atlantic Sun Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= UNF officially moves to Division I|first= Smits|last= Gary|newspaper= [[Jacksonville Business Journal]]|date=July 9, 2009 |url= http://jacksonville.com/sports/college/north_florida_ospreys/2009-07-09/story/unf_officially_moves_to_division_i|accessdate=October 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ju.edu/about.aspx |title=About JU |author= |year=2010 |work=www.ju.edu |publisher=Jacksonville University |accessdate=October 31, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924112727/http://ju.edu/about.aspx |archivedate=September 24, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kansas City===
[[Arrowhead Stadium]] serves as the venue for various intercollegiate football games. It has hosted the [[Big 12 Football Championship Game|Big 12 Championship Game]] five times. On the last weekend in October, the Fall Classic rivalry game between [[Northwest Missouri State Bearcats football|Northwest Missouri State University]] and [[Pittsburg State University]] takes place here. The Bearcats of Northwest and Gorillas of Pitt State are frequently ranked one-two in the [[Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association|MIAA]] conference. In 2005, other games at Arrowhead included [[Arkansas State Red Wolves football|Arkansas State]] playing host to [[Missouri Tigers football|Missouri]], and [[Kansas Jayhawks football|Kansas]] hosting [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma]].

===Los Angeles===
{{see also|History of the National Football League in Los Angeles}}
As of 2016, Los Angeles once again has an NFL team for the first time since the [[1994 NFL season|1994 season]]; with the Rams returning from St Louis playing out of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum while a [[Los Angeles Stadium at Hollywood Park|new stadium]] is constructed at Inglewood. Prior to 1994 it had two teams simultaneously. Immediately after that season, the [[Los Angeles Rams (1946–94)|Los Angeles Rams]] moved from suburban Anaheim to [[St. Louis, Missouri]], and the [[Los Angeles Raiders]] returned to [[Oakland, California]]. The following year, the San Diego Chargers announced that they would return to Los Angeles, again giving it two teams.

Los Angeles had multiple teams in the multiple [[American Football League (disambiguation)|American Football Leagues]], prior to the NFL. The [[Los Angeles Wildcats]], also called "Wilson Wildcats", were a traveling team for the first AFL in 1926. The [[Los Angeles Bulldogs]] were members of AFL  (1937) and a minor AFL (1939) before joining the [[Pacific Coast Professional Football League]]. The Los Angeles Chargers were a charter member of AFL in 1960, becoming the [[San Diego Chargers]] in 1961. The returned to Los Angeles in 2017.

The Los Angeles area has hosted the [[Super Bowl]] seven times. The [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] hosted [[Super Bowl I]] in 1967 and [[Super Bowl VII]] in 1973. The [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]] hosted [[Super Bowl XI]] in 1977, [[Super Bowl XIV]] in 1980, [[Super Bowl XVII]] in 1983, [[Super Bowl XXI]] in 1987 and [[Super Bowl XXVII]] in 1993. The city ranks third on the list of having hosted the most number of Super Bowls, after [[Miami]] and [[New Orleans]].

{{see also|UCLA–USC rivalry}}
The metropolitan area boasts nine [[NCAA]] [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] athletic programs. The best-known are the two whose [[college football|football]] teams compete in the top-level [[Football Bowl Subdivision]], both of which are in the city of Los Angeles proper:

* [[UCLA Bruins football|UCLA Bruins]]&amp;nbsp;– Winners of more national team championships than any other college program (105), and 259 individual national championships (364 total national championships).
* [[USC Trojans football|USC Trojans]]&amp;nbsp;– Winners of 91 national team championships, and 357 individual national championships (448 total national championships).

USC has 11 national championships in football and, together with Notre Dame, has more Heisman Trophy winners than any other school.

===New York City===
The [[New York Jets]] of the [[American Football League]] and later, the [[National Football League]] played at Shea for twenty seasons, from 1964 to 1983 (excluding their first home game in 1977 played at [[Giants Stadium]]). The stadium hosted three Jets playoff games: the [[American Football League]] Championship in 1968 (beat the [[Oakland Raiders]], 27–23), an AFL Divisional Playoff in 1969 (lost 13–6 to the [[Kansas City Chiefs]]) and the 1981 AFC Wild Card Playoff game (lost 31–27 to the [[Buffalo Bills]]). For most of the Jets' tenure at Shea, they were burdened by onerous lease terms imposed at the insistence of the Mets.  Until 1978, the Jets could not play their first home game until the Mets' season was finished. For instance, in [[1969 New York Jets season|1969]], the defending Super Bowl champion Jets didn't play a home game until October 20 due to the Mets advancing to (and winning) the World Series.  Even after 1978, the Mets' status as Shea's primary tenants would require the Jets to go on long road trips (switching Shea from baseball to football configuration was a rather complex process, involving electrical, plumbing, field and other similar work). The stadium was also not well maintained in the 1970s. The Jets moved to [[Giants Stadium]] for the 1984 season, enticed by the additional 15,000+ seats offered there. Fans ripped Shea apart after the last game of the 1983 season, which also was the last NFL appearance for [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] quarterback [[Terry Bradshaw]], who threw two touchdown passes to lead the [[1983 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]] to a 34–7 victory.&lt;ref name="nyt-1983-12-11"&gt;{{cite news |title=Unruly Fans Mar Shea Farewell As Jets Lose, 34–7 |first=Gerald |last=Eskenazi |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/11/sports/unruly-fans-mar-shea-farewell-as-jets-lose-34-7.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 11, 1983 |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the scoreboard operator had a field day, displaying the home team as the "N.J.

Simpson]] became the first running back to gain 2,000 yards in a single season&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Simpson Breaks Mark as Bills Rout Jets |first=Murray |last=Chass |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB081FFE3B59147A93C5A81789D95F478785F9 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 17, 1973 |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and, to date, the only player to do it in 14 games or fewer). In the 1983 season, a Jets game against the [[Los Angeles Rams]] featured an 85-yard touchdown run by rookie [[Eric Dickerson]], as well as a brawl between Rams offensive tackle [[Jackie Slater]] and Jets defensive end [[Mark Gastineau]] when Slater blindsided Gastineau after the Jet performed his infamous "Sack Dance" over fallen Rams quarterback [[Vince Ferragamo]]. The [[National Football League|NFL]]'s [[New York Giants]] played their 1975 season at Shea while [[Giants Stadium]] was being built. The Giants were 5–9 that year (2–5 at Shea). Their coach was [[Bill Arnsparger]] and their quarterback was [[Craig Morton]]. The football field at Shea extended from around home plate all the way to the outfield, with the baseline seating rotating out to fill left and right fields.

The first [[college football]] game played in [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] was a 3-0 [[Syracuse Orange football|Syracuse]] victory over [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pittsburgh]] on October 20, 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luckyshow.org/football/ys.htm|title=Football Games at Yankee Stadium|publisher=Lucky's Amazing Sports Lists|date=December 29, 2012|accessdate=2013-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; When an ill Ruth could not lead the Yankees to the World Series in 1925, college football took center stage at Yankee Stadium that fall. The fiercely competitive [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]]–[[Army Black Knights football|Army]] game moved to Yankee Stadium, where it remained until 1947. In the 1928 game, with the score 0–0 at halftime, legendary Notre Dame coach [[Knute Rockne]] gave his "win one for the Gipper" speech (with reference to All-American halfback [[George Gipp]], who died in 1920); Notre Dame went on to defeat Army, 12–6. The 1929 game between the two teams had the highest attendance in the series at 79,408.&lt;ref&gt;Notre Dame football media guide (PDF copy available at [http://und.cstv.com und.cstv.com])&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1946 Army vs. Notre Dame football game]] at Yankee stadium is regarded as one of the 20th century college football [[Game of the Century (college football)|Games of the Century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Whittingham |first=Richard |editor= |others= |title=Rites of autumn: the story of college football |origyear= |month= |url= |edition= |series= |year= 2001 |publisher=The Free Press |location=New York |isbn=0-7432-2219-9 |oclc= |id= |pages=148–183 |chapter=6 |chapterurl= |quote=It was surely the game of the year, and many have said it was the college football game of the century }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Notre Dame played 24 games at Yankee Stadium, going 15–6–3. Army played 38, compiling a 17–17–4 record (including the best-attended game, on December 1, 1928 when Army lost to [[Stanford University|Stanford]] 26–0 before 86,000 fans). [[New York University]] played more games there than any other school, 96, using it as a secondary home field from 1923 to 1948, with a record of 52–40–4. Nearby [[Fordham University]] played 19 games there, going 13–5–1. Eight college football games were played at Yankee Stadium on [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]], the first seven by [[New York University]].  Perhaps, the most famous Thanksgiving Day game was the first.  Oregon State Agricultural College (now [[Oregon State Beavers football|Oregon State]]) was the first West Coast team to travel across the country and play an East Coast team.  8–1 NYU was a 3–1 favorite to beat 5–3 OSAC, but Oregon State upset the hometown favorites 25–13. Will Rogers lamented what the "Oregon apple knockers" had done to his "city slickers" in a column after the game.  After the 1928 game, NYU beat Carnegie Tech (now [[Carnegie Mellon University]]) in 1931 and 1932, defeated Fordham in 1936, lost to Carnegie Tech in 1929, and lost to Fordham in 1934 and 1935.  In the eighth game, in 1963, Syracuse beat Notre Dame, 14–7. This was a rematch following the teams' controversial 1961 game won by Notre Dame, 17–15. The [[Gotham Bowl]] was scheduled to premiere at Yankee Stadium in 1960, but was canceled when no opponent could be found for [[Oregon State University]]. The 1961 game was moved to the [[Polo Grounds]], and when just 6,166 people came to Yankee Stadium for the 1962 game, in which the [[University of Nebraska]] defeated the [[University of Miami]], 36–34, the Gotham Bowl was never played again. The Miami-Nebraska game remains the only college bowl ever played at the stadium. In 1969, Notre Dame and Army reprised their long series at the Stadium (1925–1946 except 1930) with one final game. Starting in 1971, the Stadium hosted the [[Whitney M. Young]] [[Urban League]] Classic, a game between [[historically black college]]s, often featuring [[Grambling State University]] of [[Louisiana]], coached by [[Eddie Robinson (football coach)|Eddie Robinson]], the first college coach to win 400 games. The Classic helped to spread the fame of Grambling and other similar schools. Yankee Stadium hosted its final Classic during the 1987 season, also the last time a football game was played there. Grambling lost to [[Central State University]] of Ohio, 37–21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindspring.com/~luckyshow/football/ys.htm|title=redirect|publisher=|accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Classic has been held at [[Giants Stadium]] and [[MetLife Stadium]] in [[New Jersey]]'s [[Meadowlands Sports Complex]] ever since, though the Yankees remain a supporter of the event. In 1926, after negotiations failed with the fledgling NFL and the [[Chicago Bears]], [[Red Grange]] and his agent C.C. Pyle formed the [[American Football League (1926)|first American Football League]] and fielded a team called the [[New York Yankees (NFL)|New York Yankees]] based in Yankee Stadium. The league failed after only one year, but the team continued as a member of the NFL for two seasons before ceasing operations. A [[New York Yankees (1936 AFL)|second New York Yankees]] football team, not related to the first, split its home games between Yankee Stadium and [[Downing Stadium]] as it competed in the [[American Football League (1936)|second AFL]] in 1936 and 1937. A [[American Football League (1940)|third AFL]] [[New York Yankees (1940 AFL)|New York Yankees]] took the field in 1940 and became the New York Americans in 1941. The [[New York Yankees (AAFC)|New York Yankees]] of the [[All-America Football Conference]] (AAFC) played their home games at Yankee Stadium from 1946 to 1949. Following the [[1949 NFL season|1949 season]], the NFL [[New York Bulldogs]] acquired many of the players from the 1949 Yankees.  Using the name the [[New York Yanks]] they played two seasons at Yankee Stadium, [[1950 NFL season|1950]] and [[1951 NFL season|1951]]. The [[New York Giants]] of the [[National Football League|NFL]] played their home games at Yankee Stadium from [[1956 NFL season|1956]] to [[1973 NFL season|1973]]. On December 28, 1958, Yankee Stadium hosted the NFL championship game, frequently called "[[1958 NFL Championship Game|The Greatest Game Ever Played]]". The [[1958 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore Colts]] tied the [[1958 New York Giants season|Giants]], 17–17, on a field goal with seven seconds left. Led by quarterback [[Johnny Unitas]], the Colts won in overtime, 23–17. The game's dramatic ending is often cited as elevating professional football to one of the United States' major sports.  Additionally, one of the most notable plays in NFL history occurred at Yankee Stadium on November 20, 1960 when the [[Philadelphia Eagles]]' [[Chuck Bednarik]] forcefully tackled the Giants' [[Frank Gifford]] in the last minute of a close game, forcing a fumble recovered by the Eagles that clinched the victory for Philadelphia and ultimately helped the Eagles dethrone the two-time defending champion Giants as NFL Eastern Division champions. The hit left Gifford with a concussion and forced his temporary retirement from football for the remainder of the [[1960 NFL season|1960 season]] and all of the [[1961 NFL season|1961 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Where Are They Now: C/LB Chuck Bednarik|url=http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/news/Story-WhereAreTheyNow.asp?story_id=15075|publisher=PhiladelphiaEagles.com|accessdate=2011-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Giants played their first two home games at Yankee Stadium in [[1973 NFL season|1973]], concluding their tenancy on September 23 with a 23–23 tie against the [[1973 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]]. In October, they moved to the [[Yale Bowl]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], for the rest of the season.

===Phoenix===
The [[Arizona Cardinals]] moved to Phoenix from [[St. Louis, Missouri]] in 1988 and currently play in the [[NFC West|Western Division]] of the [[National Football League]]'s [[National Football Conference]]. The team, however, has never played in the city itself; they played at [[Sun Devil Stadium]] on the campus of Arizona State University in nearby Tempe until 2006. Sun Devil Stadium held [[Super Bowl XXX]] in 1996 when the [[Dallas Cowboys]] defeated the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. The Cardinals now play at [[University of Phoenix Stadium]] in west suburban Glendale. University of Phoenix Stadium hosted [[Super Bowl XLII]] on February 3, 2008, in which the [[New York Giants]] defeated the [[New England Patriots]]. It is also the home of the annual [[Fiesta Bowl|Tostitos Fiesta Bowl]], a college football bowl game that is part of the [[Bowl Championship Series]] (BCS). The University of Phoenix Stadium will host [[Super Bowl XLIX]] in 2015.

===San Francisco Bay Area===
All three football-playing schools in the Bay Area are in the [[Football Bowl Subdivision]], the highest level of NCAA [[college football]]. The [[California Golden Bears]] and [[Stanford Cardinal]] compete in the [[Pac-12 Conference]], and the [[San Jose State Spartans]] compete in the [[Mountain West Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themwc.com/genrel/050412aag.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130105000238/http://www.themwc.com/genrel/050412aag.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-05 |title=San José State, Utah State to Join Mountain West – Mountain West Conference Official Athletic Site |publisher=Themwc.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cardinal and Golden Bears are intense rivals, with their football teams competing annually in the [[Big Game (American football)|Big Game]] for the Stanford Axe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/sports/college/football&amp;id=8433343 |title=Cal, Stanford get pumped up for The Big Game &amp;#124; abc7news.com |publisher=Abclocal.go.com |date=2011-11-15 |accessdate=2012-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most famous games in the rivalry is the 1982 edition, when the [[California Golden Bears football|Golden Bears]] defeated the [[Stanford Cardinal football|Cardinal]] on a last-second return kickoff known as "[[The Play (Stanford vs. California)|The Play]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://california.scout.com/2/814436.html |title=Scout.com: The Big Game: Cal vs. Stanford |publisher=California.scout.com |date=2008-11-22 |accessdate=2012-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saint Louis===
[[Saint Louis Billikens|Saint Louis University]] (SLU) plays [[NCAA Division I]] sports as a member of the [[Atlantic 10 Conference]]. SLU dropped football as an intercollegiate sport in 1949, but SLU is best known for its [[Saint Louis Billikens men's basketball|men's basketball]] and [[Saint Louis Billikens men's soccer|men's socce]]r programs. The [[Edward Jones Dome]] hosted the first [[Big 12 Football Championship Game|Big 12 Conference football championship game]] in 1996 ([[University of Nebraska|Nebraska]] versus [[University of Texas-Austin|Texas]]). The third game, in 1998, was also held in the dome ([[Kansas State University|Kansas State]] versus [[Texas A&amp;M University|Texas A&amp;M]]). The dome has also been a neutral site for regular-season college football matchups between the [[University of Illinois]] and the [[University of Missouri]], promoted locally as the "[[Arch Rivalry]]". Missouri has won all six games (2002, 2003, 2007, 2008, 2009 &amp; 2010).

===Washington, DC===
On December 20, 2008, Washington hosted its first college bowl game, the [[Military Bowl|EagleBank Bowl]], at RFK Stadium. The [[2008 EagleBank Bowl|first match-up]] saw [[2008 Wake Forest Demon Deacons football team|Wake Forest]] defeat [[2008 Navy Midshipmen football team|Navy]], 29&amp;ndash;19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Washington Post |title=A D.C.

A '''cookbook''' or '''cookery book'''&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cookery+book&lt;/ref&gt; is a kitchen reference containing [[recipe]]s.

Cookbooks may be general, or may specialize in a particular cuisine or category of food.

Recipes in cookbooks are organized in various ways: by [[course (food)|course]] (appetizer, first course, main course, dessert), by main ingredient, by cooking technique, alphabetically, by region or country, and so on. They may include illustrations of finished [[dish (food)|dishes]] and preparation steps; discussions of cooking techniques, advice on kitchen equipment, ingredients, and substitutions; historical and cultural notes; and so on.

Cookbooks may be written by individual authors, who may be chefs, cooking teachers, or other food writers; they may be written by collectives; or they may be anonymous. They may be addressed to home cooks, to professional restaurant cooks, to institutional cooks, or to more specialized audiences.

Some cookbooks are didactic, with detailed recipes addressed to beginners or people learning to cook particular dishes or cuisines;&lt;ref&gt;''e.g.'' ''[[Mastering the Art of French Cooking]]''&lt;/ref&gt; others are simple aide-memoires, which may document the composition of a dish or even precise measurements, but not detailed techniques.&lt;ref&gt;''e.g.'' ''[[Le Répertoire de la Cuisine]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early works===

Ancient Mesopotamian recipes have been found on three Akkadian tablets, dating to about 1700 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1985-05-23/food/fo-8362_1_ancient-recipes LA Times: Chef Breaks Code to Ancient Recipes : Babylonian Collection Now the Oldest Known to Man]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfqhJNUtiww&amp;feature=youtu.be |publisher=[[YouTube]] |author=[[Yale University]] |title=Interdisciplinary team cooks 4000-year old Babylonian stews at NYU event |date=June 13, 2018 |access-date=June 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest collection of recipes that has survived in Europe is ''[[De re coquinaria]]'', written in [[Latin]]. An early version was first compiled sometime in the 1st century and has often been attributed to the Roman gourmet [[Marcus Gavius Apicius]], though this has been cast in doubt by modern research. An ''[[Apicius]]'' came to designate a book of recipes. The current text appears to have been compiled in the late 4th or early 5th century; the first print edition is from 1483. It records a mix of ancient Greek and Roman cuisine, but with few details on preparation and cooking.&lt;ref&gt;Adamson, Melitta Weiss. "The Greco-Roman World" in ''Regional Cuisines of Medieval Europe'', p. 6–7; Simon Varey, "Medieval and Renaissance Italy, A. The Peninsula" in ''Regional Cuisines of Medieval Europe'', pp. 85–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

An abbreviated epitome entitled ''Apici Excerpta a Vinidario'', a "pocket Apicius" by '''Vinidarius''', "an illustrious man",&lt;ref&gt;About Vinidarius himself nothing is known; he may have been a Goth, in which case his Gothic name may have been ''Vinithaharjis''.&lt;/ref&gt; was made in the [[Carolingian]] era.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Grocock and Sally Grainger, ''Apicius. A critical edition with an introduction and an English translation'' (Prospect Books) 2006 {{ISBN|1-903018-13-7}}, pp. 309-325&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of its late date it represents the last manifestation of the cuisine of Antiquity.

The earliest cookbooks known in Arabic are those of [[Ibn Sayyar al-Warraq|al-Warraq]] (an early 10th-century compendium of recipes from the 9th and 10th centuries) and [[Muhammad bin Hasan al-Baghdadi|al-Baghdadi]] (13th century).&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopædia Britannica]], ''s.v.'' cookbook [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/136079/cookbook#ref=ref26264 full text]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese recipe books are known from the [[Tang dynasty]], but most were lost.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} One of the earliest surviving Chinese-language cookbooks is [[Hu Sihui]]'s "Yinshan Zhengyao" (Important Principles of Food and Drink), believed to be from 1330. Hu Sihui, [[Buyantu Khan]]'s dietitian and therapist, recorded a Chinese-inflected Central Asian cuisine as eaten by the [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan]] court; his recipes were adapted from foods eaten all over the [[Mongol Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Hu Sihui, Paul D. Buell, Eugene N. Anderson, tr., ''A Soup for the Qan: Chinese Dietary Medicine of the Mongol Era as Seen in Hu Szu-Hui's Yin-Shan Cheng-Yao: Introduction, Translation, Commentary and Chinese Text'' (London; New York: Kegan Paul International, 2000. {{ISBN|0710305834}}), p. 1-8.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Eumsik dimibang]]'', written around 1670, is the oldest [[Korea]]n cookbook and the first cookbook written by a woman in East Asia.

After a long interval, the first recipe books to be compiled in Europe since Late Antiquity started to appear in the late thirteenth century. About a hundred are known to have survived, some fragmentary, from the age before printing.&lt;ref&gt;John Dickie, ''Delizia! The Epic History of the Italians and Their Food'' 2008, pp50f.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest genuinely medieval recipes have been found in a Danish manuscript dating from around 1300, which in turn are copies of older texts that date back to the early 13th century or perhaps earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Constance B. Hieatt, "Sorting Through the Titles of Medieval Dishes: What Is, or Is Not, a 'Blanc Manger'" in ''Food in the Middle Ages'', pp. 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Low German|Low]] and [[High German]] manuscripts are among the most numerous. Among them is ''Daz buch von guter spise'' ("The Book of Good Food") written c. 1350 in Würzberg and ''Kuchenmeysterey'' ("Kitchen Mastery"), the first printed German cookbook from 1485.&lt;ref&gt;Melitta Weiss Adamson, "The Greco-Roman World" in ''Regional Cuisines of Medieval Europe'', p. 161, 182–83&lt;/ref&gt; Two French collections are probably the most famous: ''[[Viandier|Le Viandier]]'' ("The Provisioner") was compiled in the late 14th century by [[Guillaume Tirel]], master chef for two French kings; and ''[[Le Menagier de Paris]]'' ("The Householder of Paris"), a household book written by an anonymous middle class Parisian in the 1390s.&lt;ref&gt;Adamson (2004), pp. 103, 107.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Du fait de cuisine]] is another Medieval French cookbook, written in 1420.

From Southern Europe there is the 14th century [[Valencian]] manuscript Llibre de Sent Soví (1324), the [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''Llibre de totes maneres de potatges de menjar'' ("The book of all recipes of dishes") and several Italian collections, notably the Venetian mid-14th century ''Libro per Cuoco'',&lt;ref&gt;Text printed in E. Faccioli, ed. ''Arte della cucina dal XIV al XIX secolo'' (Milan, 1966) vol. I, pp.61-105, analysed by John Dickie 2008, pp 50ff.&lt;/ref&gt; with its 135 recipes alphabetically arranged. The printed ''[[De honesta voluptate et valetudine]]'' ("On honourable pleasure"), first published in 1475, is one of the first cookbooks based on Renaissance ideals, and, though it is as much a series of moral essays as a cookbook, has been described as "the anthology that closed the book on medieval Italian cooking".&lt;ref&gt;Simon Varey, "Medieval and Renaissance Italy, A. The Peninsula" in ''Regional Cuisines of Medieval Europe'', p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval English cookbooks include ''[[The Forme of Cury]]'' and ''[[Utilis Coquinario]]'', both written in the fourteenth century. [[The Forme of Cury]] is a cookbook authored by the chefs of [[Richard II]]. [[Utilis Coquinario]] is a similar cookbook though written by an unknown author. Recipes originating in England also include the earliest recorded recipe for ravioli (1390s).{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Modern cookbooks===

[[File:ActonFish.jpg|thumb|from ''[[Modern Cookery for Private Families]]'' by Eliza Acton (London: Longmans, Green, Reader, and Dyer, 1871. p.48.)]]
With the advent of the [[printing press]] in the 16th and 17th centuries, numerous books were written on how to manage households and prepare food. In Holland&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sieben | first = Ria Jansen | title = Een notable boecxtken van cokeryen | year = 1588}}&lt;/ref&gt; and England&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = anon | title = The good Huswifes handmaid for Cookerie | year = 1588 }}&lt;/ref&gt; competition grew between the noble families as to who could prepare the most lavish banquet. By the 1660s, cookery had progressed to an art form and good cooks were in demand. Many of them published their own books detailing their recipes in competition with their rivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = May | first = Robert | title = The accompliſht Cook |  year = 1685}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these books have now been translated and are available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Medieval Cookbooks | author = Judy Gerjuoy | accessdate = 2007-06-15 | url = http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/articles/food_bibliography.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 19th century, the Victorian preoccupation for domestic respectability brought about the emergence of cookery writing in its modern form. In 1796, the first known American cookbook titled, ''[[American Cookery]]'', written by Amelia Simmons, was published in [[Hartford, Connecticut]]. Until then, the cookbooks printed and used in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] were British. The first modern cookery writer and compiler of recipes for the home was [[Eliza Acton]]. Her pioneering cookbook, ''[[Modern Cookery for Private Families]]'' (1845), was aimed at the domestic reader rather than the professional cook or chef. This was an immensely influential book, and it established the format for modern writing about cookery.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} The publication introduced the now-universal practice of listing the ingredients and suggested cooking times with each recipe. It included the first recipe for [[Brussels sprouts]].&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, ''Food For Thought: Extraordinary Little Chronicles of the World'', (2004) pg 144&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary chef [[Delia Smith]] is quoted as having called Acton "the best writer of recipes in the English language."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hub-uk.com/interesting/delia-british-library.htm Interview].&lt;/ref&gt; ''Modern Cookery'' long survived her, remaining in print until 1914 and available more recently in facsimile reprint. 

Acton's work was an important influence on [[Isabella Beeton]],&lt;ref name=Acton&gt;{{cite web|title=Acton, Eliza (1799–1859)|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-2591300080.html|work=[[Women in World History|Women in World History: A Biographical Encyclopedia]]|publisher=Gale Research Inc.|accessdate=8 January 2013}}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; who published ''[[Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management]]'' in 24 monthly parts between 1857 and 1861. The book was a guide to running a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] household, with advice on fashion, [[child care]], [[animal husbandry]], poisons, the management of [[Domestic worker|servants]], science, religion, and industrialism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/b/beeton/isabella/household/chapter16.html ''General Observations on the Common Hog'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tracingpaper.org.uk/2007/04/21/food-in-season-in-1861/ |title=''Food in season in April 1861'' |access-date=2014-06-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131119013243/http://www.tracingpaper.org.uk/2007/04/21/food-in-season-in-1861/ |archive-date=2013-11-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its title, most of the text consisted of recipes, such that another popular name for the volume is ''Mrs Beeton's Cookbook''. Most of the recipes were illustrated with coloured engravings, and it was the first book to show recipes in a format that is still used today. Many of the recipes were plagiarised from earlier writers, including Acton.

In 1885 the ''Virginia Cookery Book'' was published by [[Mary Stuart Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Smith|first=Mary Stuart|title=Virginia Cookery Book|year=1885|publisher=Harper and Bros.|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896 the American cook [[Fannie Farmer]] (1857–1915) published ''The Boston Cooking School Cookbook'' which contained some 1,849 recipes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cunningham | first = Marion | title = The Fannie Farmer Cookbook (revised) | publisher = Bantam Books, New York | year = 1979 | isbn = 0-553-56881-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of cookbooks==
[[File:Betty Crocker's Cook Book for Boys and Girls.djvu|thumb|upright|''Betty Crocker's Cook Book for Boys and Girls'', 1957]]

Cookbooks that serve as basic kitchen references (sometimes known as "kitchen bibles") began to appear in the [[early modern period]]. They provided not just recipes but overall instruction for both kitchen technique and household management. Such books were written primarily for housewives and occasionally domestic servants as opposed to professional cooks, and at times books such as ''[[The Joy of Cooking]]'' ([[Cuisine of the United States|USA]]), ''[[La bonne cuisine de Madame E. Saint-Ange]]'' ([[French cuisine|France]]), ''The [[Art of Cookery]]'' ([[British cuisine|UK]], USA), ''[[Il cucchiaio d'argento]]'' ([[Italian cuisine|Italy]]), and ''[[A Gift to Young Housewives]]'' ([[Russian cuisine|Russia]]) have served as references of record for national cuisines. Cookbook also tell stories of the writers themselves and reflect upon the era in which they are written. They often reveal notions of social, political, environmental or economic contexts. For example, during the era of industrialization, convenience foods were brought into many households and were integrated and present in cookbooks written in this time.&lt;ref&gt;Melissa Fuster (2015) Writing Cuisine in the Spanish Caribbean: A Comparative Analysis of Iconic Puerto Rican and Cuban cookbooks, Food, Culture &amp; Society,
18:4, 659-680&lt;/ref&gt; Related to this class are instructional cookbooks, which combine recipes with in-depth, step-by-step recipes to teach beginning cooks basic concepts and techniques. In vernacular literature, people may collect traditional recipes in [[family cookbooks]].

While western cookbooks usually group recipes for main courses by the main ingredient of the dishes, [[Cuisine of Japan|Japanese]] cookbooks usually group them by cooking techniques (e.g., [[Frying|fried]] foods, [[Steaming|steam]]ed foods, and [[Grilling|grill]]ed foods). Both styles of cookbook have additional recipe groupings such as [[soup]]s or [[sweets]].

===International and ethnic===
[[File:Norwegian immigrant cookbook 1899.jpg|thumb|Norwegian immigrant cookbook in Norwegian Published in the USA 1899]]
International and ethnic cookbooks fall into two categories: the kitchen references of other cultures, translated into other languages; and books translating the recipes of another culture into the languages, techniques, and ingredients of a new audience. The latter style often doubles as a sort of culinary travelogue, giving background and context to a recipe that the first type of book would assume its audience is already familiar with. Popular Puerto Rican cookbook, Cocina Criolla, written by Carmen Aboy Valldejuli, includes recipes that are typically of traditional Puerto Rican cuisine such as mofongo and pasteles. Valldejuli’s cookbook was not only important to Puerto Ricans, but also very popular in the United States where her original cookbook has since been published in several editions, including English versions. These include The Art of Caribbean Cookery - Doubleday, 1957; Puerto Rican Cookery - Pelican Publishing, 1983; and, Juntos en la Cocina (co-authored with her husband, Luis F. Valldejuli) - Pelican Publishing, 1986.  &lt;ref&gt;Melissa Fuster (2015) Writing Cuisine in the Spanish Caribbean: A Comparative Analysis of Iconic Puerto Rican and Cuban cookbooks, Food, Culture &amp; Society, 18:4, 659-680&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professional cookbooks===
Professional cookbooks are designed for the use of working chefs and culinary students and sometimes double as textbooks for culinary schools. Such books deal not only in recipes and techniques, but often service and kitchen workflow matters. Many such books deal in substantially larger quantities than home cookbooks, such as making sauces by the liter or preparing dishes for large numbers of people in a [[catering]] setting. While the most famous of such books today are books like ''[[Le guide culinaire]]'' by [[Escoffier]] or ''The Professional Chef'' by the [[Culinary Institute of America]], such books go at least back to medieval times, represented then by works such as [[Taillevent]]'s ''[[Viandier]]'' and Chiquart d'Amiço's ''Du fait de cuisine''.

===Single-subject===
Single-subject books, usually dealing with a specific ingredient, technique, class of dishes or target group (e.g. for kids), are quite common as well. [[Jack Monroe]] for example features [[Jack Monroe#Cookery books|low budget recipes]].  Some imprints such as [[Chronicle Books]] have specialized in this sort of book, with books on dishes like [[curry|curries]], [[pizza]], and simplified [[ethnic food]]. Popular subjects for narrow-subject books on technique include [[grilling]]/[[barbecue]], [[baking]], [[outdoor cooking]], and even recipe cloning (Recipe cloning is copying commercial recipes where the original is a [[trade secret]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.food.com/slideshow/copycat-faves-restaurant-recipes-revealed-67 Copycat Faves: Restaurant Recipes Revealed]&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Community===
Community cookbooks (also known as compiled, regional, charitable, and fund-raising cookbooks) are a unique genre of culinary literature. Community cookbooks focus on home cooking, often documenting regional, ethnic, family, and societal traditions, as well as local history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/community-cookbooks Answers.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowers|first=Anne|title=Recipes for Reading: Community Cookbooks, Stories, Histories|year=1997|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|location=Amherst|isbn=978-1-55849-089-5|url=http://www.umass.edu/umpress/title/recipes-reading}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sondra Gotlieb]], for example, wrote her cookbooks on Canadian food culture by visiting people and homes by region. She gathered recipes, observed the foodways, observed the people and their traditions of each region by being in their own homes. Gotlieb did this so that she could put together a comprehensive cookbook based on the communities and individuals that make up Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Keneally, Rhona Richman. There is a Canadian Cuisine, and it is unique in all the world: Crafting National Food Culture during the Long 1960s.&lt;/ref&gt;[[Gooseberry Patch]] has been publishing community-style cookbooks since 1992 and built their brand on this community.

===Chefs===
Cookbooks can also document the food of a specific chef (particularly in conjunction with a [[cooking show]]) or restaurant. Many of these books, particularly those written by or for a well-established cook with a long-running TV show or popular restaurant, become part of extended series of books that can be released over the course of many years. Popular chef-authors throughout history include people such as [[Delia Smith]], [[Julia Child]], [[James Beard]], [[Nigella Lawson]], [[Edouard de Pomiane]], [[The Frugal Gourmet|Jeff Smith]], [[Emeril Lagasse]], [[Claudia Roden]], [[Madhur Jaffrey]], [[Katsuyo Kobayashi]], and possibly even [[Apicius]], the semi-pseudonymous author of the Roman cookbook [[De re coquinaria]], who shared a name with at least [[Marcus Gavius Apicius|one other famous food figure]] of the ancient world.

==Collections and collectors ==

Several libraries have extensive collections of cookbooks.

* Harvard's [[Schlesinger Library|Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America]] has a collection of 20,000 cookbooks and other books on food, including the earliest American cookbook, and the personal collections and papers of [[Julia Child]], [[M.F.K. Fisher]], and the authors of ''[[The Joy of Cooking]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.radcliffe.harvard.edu/schlesinger-library/collections]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heather Atwood, "Harvard's Cookbooks Speak of Our History", ''Gloucester Times'', August 8, 2012 [https://www.radcliffe.harvard.edu/news/in-news/harvards-cookbooks-speak-our-history full text]&lt;/ref&gt;
* New York University's [[Fales Library]] includes a Food and Cookery Collection of over 15,000 books, including the personal libraries of [[James Beard]], [[Cecily Brownstone]], and [[Dalia Carmel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.nyu.edu/collections/policies/fales_food.html "Fales Library Food and Cookery Collection Development Policy"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101031516/http://library.nyu.edu/collections/policies/fales_food.html |date=2014-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Brotherton Library]] at [[University of Leeds]] holds a [[Designation Scheme|Designated]] [[Leeds University Library's Cookery Collection|Cookery Collection]] of over 8,000 books and 75 manuscripts, including the personal collections of Blanche Leigh, John Preston and Michael Bateman.&lt;ref name="Cookery Collections Guide"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cookery Collections Guide|url=https://library.leeds.ac.uk/special-collections-cookery-collection|website=Special Collections|publisher=Leeds University Library|accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The English Cookery Book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=White|first1=Eileen|title=The English Cookery Book: Historical Essays|date=2004|publisher=Prospect Books|isbn=1 90301836 6|pages=6–27|url=http://prospectbooks.co.uk/img/EnglishCookeryBook.pdf|accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some individuals are notable for their collections of cookbooks, or their scholarly interest therein. [[Elizabeth Robins Pennell]], an American critic in London from the 1880s, was an early writer on the subject, and has recently been called "one of the most well-known cookbook collectors in the world".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finebooksmagazine.com/issue/200908/pennell-1.phtml "A Greedy Woman:The Long, Delicious Shelf Life of Elizabeth Robins Pennell". Cynthia D. Bertelsen. August 2009. ''Fine Books Magazine''.]&lt;/ref&gt; Much of her collection eventually went to the Rare Book and Special Collections Division at the [[Library of Congress]].

==Usage outside the world of food==
The term ''cookbook'' is sometimes used metaphorically to refer to any book containing a straightforward set of already tried and tested "[[recipe]]s" or instructions for a specific field or activity, presented in detail so that the users who are not necessarily expert in the field can produce workable results. Examples include a set of circuit designs in [[electronics]], a book of [[Spell (paranormal)|magic spells]], or ''[[The Anarchist Cookbook]]'', a set of instructions on destruction and living outside the law. [[O'Reilly Media]] publishes a series of books about [[computer programming]] named the [[O'Reilly Media#Cookbook|Cookbook series]], and each of these books contain hundreds of ready to use, cut and paste examples to solve a specific problem in a single [[programming language]].

They are most known for their seminal book, ''Human Milk in the Modern World'', published by [[Oxford University Press]] in 1978, and for editing the mult-volume ''Advances in International Maternal and Child Health''.  The Jelliffes also wrote over 500 scholarly papers, often together and 22 books.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt; They lived and worked in [[England]], [[Africa]], [[India]], the [[Caribbean]] and settled in [[Los Angeles]] where he held the Chair in [[Public Health]] and Paediatrics at the [[University of California]] from 1972 to 1990.

The Jelliffes' field observations triggered the so-called Baby Killers scandal&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/BABY-KILLER-SCANDAL-INVESTIGATION-PROMOTION/dp/0905990099 The baby killer scandal: a War on Want investigation into the promotion and sale of powdered baby milks in the Third World.] By Andrew Chetley&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Nestlé boycott]]. Professor Jelliffe subsequently testified to a subcommittee of the [[US Senate]] organized by [[Teddy Kennedy]] in 1978. He coined the phrase ''commerciogenic [[malnutrition]]'' to refer to infant starvation caused by inappropriate promotion and use of [[infant formula]] or bottlefeeding in areas with low income and poor water supplies. He is associated with the protection, support and promotion of [[breastfeeding]].

Other areas associated with their research include the changing composition and properties of [[human milk]], the [[contraceptive]] effects of breastfeeding, and the use of breastfeeding for rehydration&lt;ref&gt;[http://rehydrate.org/breastfeed/index.html Breast Milk, Breastmilk, Breastfeeding, Breast Feeding] - Rehydration Project&lt;/ref&gt; and other issues for infant [[refugee]]s. 
Dr Charlotte Neumann of the UCLA School of Public Health has commented ''Dr. Jelliffe was the hero of all in international nutrition and health – he played a pivotal role in bringing pediatrics to Africa.'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ph.ucla.edu/magazine/sphmag_nov06_final.pdf Charlotte Neumann:Pediatrician Provides Food for Thought(p13)] November 2006, UCLA Public Health&lt;/ref&gt;  Derrick Jelliffe was awarded the Wihuri International Prize in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wihurinrahasto.fi/prizes.html  Wihuri Foundation for International Prizes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110423032658/http://www.wihurinrahasto.fi/prizes.html |date=April 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In
1982 Derrick Jelliffe received an [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] from the Faculty of Medicine at [[Uppsala University]], [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uu.se/en/about-uu/traditions/prizes/honorary-doctorates/&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often considered to be the first [[encyclopedia]] to use the term ''encyclopedia'' in its title.{{sfn|Yeo|2001|p=6}} This is not to be confused with the first appearance of the word which was disputed by [[Robert Collison]] who later reported that the work was poorly written, and that [[Joachim Sterck van Ringelbergh]] had used the word "cyclopaedia" to describe his work in 1541.{{fact|date=March 2018}}

'''''Epistulae ad Brutum''''' ('''''Letters to Brutus''''') is a collection of letters between [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] politician and orator [[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]] and fellow politician, and conspirator against [[Julius Caesar]], [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Marcus Junius Brutus]]. The letters in this collection, when combined with Cicero's other letters, are considered some of the most reliable sources of information for the period leading up to the fall of the [[Roman Republic]].&lt;ref name="eb1911-cicero"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Cicero}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero became acquainted with Brutus through his close friend [[Titus Pomponius Atticus]], an admirer of Brutus. Their personal relationship likely grew during their time together in opposition to Caesar during [[Caesar's Civil War|the civil war]] in 49&amp;nbsp;BCE, it being firmly established by the time Cicero returned to Rome in the autumn of 47.&lt;ref name="loeb-2002" /&gt;

Traditionally divided into two books, the collection features 26 letters written from March or April to July 43&amp;nbsp;BCE — a year after the [[assassination of Julius Caesar]], and a year before the death of Brutus in 42. The authenticity of the letters was for a long time cast into doubt, but is now generally recognized, with the exception of the first book's letters 16 and 17.&lt;ref name="loeb-2002"&gt;{{Cite book |editor-last=Shackleton Bailey |editor-first=D. R. |editor-link=D. R. Shackleton Bailey |date=May 2002 |title=Letters to Quintus and Brutus. Letter Fragments. Letter to Octavian. Invectives. Handbook of Electioneering |url=http://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL462/2002/volume.xml |publisher=Harvard University Press |access-date=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two letters resemble the style of ''{{lang|la|suasoriae}}'' — exercises in [[rhetoric]] commonly used by students of the late [[Roman Republic|Republic]] and [[Augustus|Augustan]] eras. The second book of Cicero's letters to Brutus was first printed by [[Andreas Cratander]] of [[Basel]] in 1528 from a now lost manuscript obtained for him by [[Sichardus]] from the [[Lorsch Abbey|Abbey of Lorsch]].&lt;ref name="eb1911-cicero" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6428">The '''Europarl Corpus''' is a [[Text corpus|corpus]] (set of documents) that consists of the proceedings of the [[European Parliament]] from 1996 to the present. 
In its first release in 2001, it covered eleven official languages of the [[European Union]] (Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Swedish).&lt;ref name="Koehn" /&gt; With the political [[Enlargement of the European Union|expansion of the EU]] the official languages of the ten new member states have been added to the corpus data.&lt;ref name="Koehn" /&gt; The latest release (2012)&lt;ref name="Europarl" /&gt; comprised up to 60 million words per language with the newly added languages being slightly underrepresented as data for them is only available from 2007 onwards. This latest version includes 21 European languages: Romanic (French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Romanian), Germanic (English, Dutch, German, Danish, Swedish), Slavic (Bulgarian, Czech, Polish, Slovak, Slovene), Finno-Ugric (Finnish, Hungarian, Estonian), Baltic (Latvian, Lithuanian), and Greek.&lt;ref name="Koehn" /&gt;

The data that makes up the [[Text corpus|corpus]] was extracted from the website of the European Parliament and then prepared for [[linguistic]] research.&lt;ref name="Koehn" /&gt; After sentence splitting and [[Tokenization (lexical analysis)|tokenization]] the sentences were aligned across languages with the help of an algorithm developed by [[Gale-Church alignment algorithm|Gale &amp; Church]] (1993).&lt;ref name="Koehn" /&gt;

The corpus has been compiled and expanded by a group of researchers led by [[Philipp Koehn]] at the University of Edinburgh. Initially, it was designed for research purposes in [[statistical machine translation]] (SMT). However, since its first release it has been used for multiple other research purposes, including for example [[Word-sense disambiguation|word sense disambiguation]]. EUROPARL is also available to search via the corpus management system [[Sketch Engine]].&lt;ref&gt;Kilgarriff, A., Baisa, V., Bušta, J., Jakubíček, M., Kovář, V., Michelfeit, J., ... &amp; Suchomel, V. (2014). [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40607-014-0009-9 The Sketch Engine: ten years on. Lexicography], 1(1), 7-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Europarl Corpus and statistical machine translation ==
In his paper "Europarl: A Parallel Corpus for Statistical Machine Translation" (2005) Koehn sums up in how far the Europarl corpus is useful for research in [[Statistical machine translation|SMT]]. He uses the corpus to develop SMT systems translating each language into each of the other ten languages of the [[Text corpus|corpus]] making it 110 systems. This enables Koehn to establish SMT systems for uncommon language pairs that have not been considered by SMT developers beforehand, such as Finnish-Italian for example.

=== Quality assessment ===
The Europarl corpus may not only be used for developing SMT systems but also for their assessment. By measuring the output of the systems against the original corpus data for the [[Target language (translation)|target language]] the adequacy of the translation can be assessed. Koehn uses the [[BLEU|BLEU metric]] by Papineni et al. (2002) for this, which counts the coincidences of the two compared versions—SMT output and corpus data—and calculates a score on this basis.&lt;ref name="Papineni" /&gt; The more similar the two versions are, the higher the score, and therefore the quality of the translation.&lt;ref name="Koehn" /&gt; Results reflect that some SMT systems perform better than others, e.g., Spanish–French (40.2) in comparison to Dutch–Finnish (10.3).&lt;ref name="Koehn" /&gt; Koehn states that the reason for this is that related languages are easier to translate into each other than those that are not.&lt;ref name="Koehn" /&gt;

=== Back translation ===
Furthermore, Koehn uses the SMT systems and the Europarl corpus data to investigate whether [[back translation]] is an adequate method for the evaluation of machine translation systems. For each language except English he compares the [[BLEU]] scores for translating that language from and into English (e.g. English &gt; Spanish, Spanish &gt; English) with those that can be achieved by measuring the original English data against the output obtained by translation from English into each language and back translation into English (e.g. English &gt; Spanish &gt; English).&lt;ref name="Koehn" /&gt; The results indicate that the scores for back translation are far higher than those for monodirectional translation and what is more important they do not correlate at all with the monodirectional scores. For example, the monodirectional scores for English&lt;&gt;Greek (27.2 and 23.2) are lower than those for English&lt;&gt;Portuguese (30.1 and 27.2). Yet the back translation score of 56.5 for Greek is higher than the one for Portuguese, which gets 53.6.&lt;ref name="Koehn" /&gt; Koehn explains this with the fact that errors committed in the translation process might simply be reversed by back translation resulting in high coincidences of in- and output.&lt;ref name="Koehn" /&gt; This, however, does not allow any conclusions about the quality of the text in the actual [[Target language (translation)|target language]].&lt;ref name="Koehn" /&gt; Therefore, Koehn does not consider back translation an adequate method for the assessment of machine translation systems.

[[Image:FranklinPlanner.png|thumb|right| Franklin Planner in binder with various examples of data forms.]]

The '''Franklin Planner''' is a paper-based [[time management]] system created by [[Hyrum W. Smith]] which began sales in 1984 from Franklin International Institute, Inc. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Hyrum|title=The Advanced Day Planner User's Guide|date=1987|publisher=Franklin International Institute, Inc.|location=Salt Lake City, Utah|isbn=0-939817-01-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The planner itself is the paper component of the time management system developed by Smith. 

The planner pages are drilled, loose-leaf style pages in different sizes and formats. Formats have been updated through the years, but most planners contain areas for an appointment schedule, prioritized daily tasks, and notes. A key section at the rear of the planner contains addresses. Other inserts include [[ledger]] sheets for tracking finances or vehicle mileage, exercise logs, and other individualized reference materials.

Smith named his planning system after [[Benjamin Franklin]] (1706–1790) who kept a small private book, as detailed in ''[[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin]]''. A core technique of the Franklin Planner system involves beginning each day with 15 minutes of "solitude and planning".

== Versions ==
The planner comes in four sizes:

# Monarch (8.5×11″, 216×280&amp;nbsp;mm)
# Classic (5.5×8.5″, 140×216&amp;nbsp;mm)
# Compact (4.25×6.75″,108×172&amp;nbsp;mm)
# Pocket (3.5×6″, 89×153&amp;nbsp;mm)

== Functions ==
Because of its overall design, the Franklin Planner system lends itself to use as a [[tickler file]], as well as a long-range planner. Most annual versions of the page inserts for the Franklin system include yearly calendars for at least five years; future monthly calendars for at least three years; and then the current year's pages and associated monthly calendars for planning. When used as a total package, the system provides a means of tracking minute details; storage of signed agreements (especially if pages are archived in the archival binders); and tracking of business and personal expenses for taxes.

== Marketing ==
The Franklin Planner is marketed to consumers through an e-commerce web site, a US-based call center, and a GSA government contract. Marketing channels also exist outside the United States of America.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Franklin Day Planner was first produced in 1984 by the Franklin International Institute, Inc., which later became Franklin Quest. In 1997, Franklin Quest and the Covey Leadership Center merged to become FranklinCovey. The Franklin Planner has continued to be sold under the FranklinCovey name to this day. However, in 2008, FranklinCovey sold its Consumer Solutions Business Unit, including Franklin Planner, to a private equity firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2008 FranklinCovey Annual Report|url=http://media.corporate-ir.net/media_files/irol/10/102601/2008FCReport.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parent company of the Franklin Planner is currently FC Organizational Products, LLC, which is the exclusive worldwide licensee of the FranklinCovey® brand.

The '''GLBT Historical Society''' (for '''Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual Transgender Historical Society''') maintains an extensive collection of archival materials, artifacts and graphic arts relating to [[LGBT history|the history of LGBT people]] in the United States, with a focus on the LGBT communities of [[San Francisco]] and [[Northern California]]. The society also sponsors '''The GLBT History Museum''', a stand-alone museum that has attracted international attention.&lt;ref name =mr1&gt;GLBT Historical Society (2011-02-22).

The archives, reading room and administrative offices of the GLBT Historical Society are located at 989 Market St., Lower Level, in San Francisco's Mid-Market district. The GLBT History Museum, which serves as a separate center for exhibitions and programs, is located at 4127 18th St. in the city's [[The Castro, San Francisco|Castro neighborhood]].

==Organizational history==

===Founding===
[[Image:MissionSt.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The main gallery at the GLBT Historical Society headquarters at 657 Mission St., San Francisco; opening of the "Polk Street: Lives in Transition" exhibition, curated by Joey Plaster (Jan. 16, 2009).]]
The roots of the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender Historical Society extend to the early 1980s, when Willie Walker and Greg Pennington met and discovered that they shared an interest in gay and lesbian history. They joined forces to pool their personal collections of gay and lesbian periodicals, dubbing the ad hoc initiative the San Francisco Gay Periodical Archive.&lt;ref name = LinneaDue&gt;{{Cite news

  | url = http://www.glbthistory.org/index.html#30th
  | accessdate = 2015-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, Walker was involved in a private study group, the San Francisco Lesbian and Gay History Project; among its members were a number of individuals who would go on to make major cultural contributions, including historians [[Allan Bérubé]] and [[Estelle Freedman]], independent scholar [[Jeffrey Escoffier]], author and community organizer [[Amber Hollibaugh]], and anthropologist and queer theorist [[Gayle Rubin]].&lt;ref name = Wakimoto&gt;Wakimoto, Diana Kiyo (2012). [http://eprints.qut.edu.au/53189/ ''Queer Community Archives in California Since 1950''] (Brisbane, Australia: Queensland University of Technology; Ph.D. dissertation in information systems), chapter 5, "'There Really Is a Sense That This Is Our Space': The History of the GLBT Historical Society." Retrieved 2012-08-18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Koskovich2&gt;{{cite news 
  | last = Koskovich
  | first = Gérard
  | title = La GLBT Historical Society de San Francisco
  | work = Triangul'ère
  | pages = 48–63
  | year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each member of the Lesbian and Gay History Project was asked to develop a major project for presentation to the group; as his contribution, Walker produced a proposal for a historical society to preserve the records of Bay Area gay and lesbian history and to make this history available to the community.&lt;ref name = Koskovich2 /&gt; Walker presented the concept at the History Project meeting on Sept. 5, 1984, and with encouragement from the project, Walker, Pennington, project member Eric Garber and several others held five working meetings before deciding that the plan would require a much larger and more diverse organizing group.&lt;ref name = LinneaDue /&gt;

According to the GLBT Historical Society newsletter, "With this in mind, Walker sent a letter to 160 organizations and 100 individuals inviting them to what turned out to be the pivotal meeting at the [[San Francisco Public Library]] on March 16, 1985. There were 63 people at the library that Saturday afternoon. 'We made the decision that everyone at the meeting was a member,' Pennington remembers. 'And we chose the name, the San Francisco Bay Area Gay and Lesbian Historical Society. On May 18, we held a public membership meeting to adopt the bylaws and elect the first board of directors.'”&lt;ref name = LinneaDue /&gt;

===Name changes===
Over the course of its history, the Historical Society has renamed itself twice to better reflect the scope of its holdings and the range of identities and practices represented in its collections and programs. In 1990, the organization changed its name to the Gay and Lesbian Historical Society of Northern California, thus clarifying the geographical reach of its primary collections.&lt;ref name = Wakimoto/&gt;&lt;ref name = Prog20&gt;GLBT Historical Society (2005-09-29). "GLBT Historical Society 20th anniversary gala" [program brochure] (San Francisco: GLBT Historical Society).&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 1999, responding to concerns raised by bisexual and transgender community members and their allies, the institution adopted its current name—the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender Historical Society—to more clearly state the inclusive mission the society had pursued since it was founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Locations===
The archival collections of the Historical Society initially were housed in the living room of Walker's apartment at 3823 17th St. in San Francisco.&lt;ref name = Wakimoto/&gt;&lt;ref name = Prog20/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The exact address is noted in the administrative files of the GLBT Historical Society; see GLHS Records, carton 1, folder: "Pre-GLHS Collections of Greg Pennington &amp; Bill Walker."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, the society moved into its own space, in the basement of the [[Redstone Building]] on 16th Street near South Van Ness—a building which also housed the gay and lesbian theater company [[Theater Rhinoceros]].&lt;ref name = Prog20/&gt; The collections grew constantly, and by 1995 the Historical Society moved into a {{convert|3700|sqft|m2|adj=on}} space on the fourth floor of 973 Market St.&lt;ref name = Wakimoto/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lagar newsletter: Gay, Lesbian Historical"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The society moved again in 2003 to a location on the third floor of a building at 657 Mission St. that also housed other cultural institutions: the [[Cartoon Art Museum]], San Francisco Camerawork and the [[Catharine Clark Gallery]]. The {{convert|6600|sqft|m2|adj=on}} space included two dedicated exhibition galleries, a reading room, a large reserve for the archival collections, and several offices for staff and volunteers.&lt;ref name = Prog20/&gt; The society regularly used one of the galleries for presentation of history talks and panel discussions, many of which were videotaped for posting on the Web. In November 2010, in anticipation of the opening of its new GLBT History Museum, the society closed its galleries and program space at 657 Mission St., while maintaining its archives, reading room and administrative offices at that location.

At the end of May 2016, the GLBT Historical Society closed its archives at 657 Mission St. in preparation for a move to an expanded space with improved facilities for researchers and staff at 989 Market St. in San Francisco. The archives reopened at the end of June 2016 at the new location, which offers 6,500 square feet devoted to archival and office space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

===Executive directors===
The Historical Society has had six executive directors during the course of its history. The organization was run directly by the Board of Directors from 1985 to 1998. In 1998, the board hired the first paid executive director, [[Susan Stryker]], Ph.D.&lt;ref name = Prog20/&gt; Stryker was succeeded in 2003 by an acting interim executive director, Daniel Bao, who served until the board hired Terence Kissack, Ph.D., in 2004.&lt;ref name = Prog20/&gt; Kissack served until the end of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

===Pop-up museum (2008–2009)===
From November 2008 through October 2009, the GLBT Historical Society sponsored a pop-up museum in the [[Castro District]] at the corner of 18th and Castro streets; the space featured an exhibition, [http://glbthistory.org/passionate_struggle/index.html "Passionate Struggle: Dynamics of San Francisco's GLBT History,"] that traced more than a century of the city's LGBT history using documents and artifacts from the society's collections. The exhibition was curated by Don Romesburg, assistant professor of women's and gender studies at [[Sonoma State University]], and [[Amy Sueyoshi]], associate professor of race and resistance studies and sexuality studies at [[San Francisco State University]], with assistance from a curatorial committee of academics and independent scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Romesburg, Don, and Amy Sueyoshi (2008-Winter). "Passionate Struggle: Dynamics of San Francisco's GLBT History" (exhibition catalog); published in ''Fabulas: The Journal of the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender Historical Society'': pp. 1-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the objects displayed were a preliminary study for the ''[[MaestraPeace]]'' mural on the façade of the San Francisco [[The Women's Building|Women's Building]], the sewing machine used by designer [[Gilbert Baker (artist)|Gilbert Baker]] to create the first [[Rainbow flag (LGBT movement)|rainbow flag]], and the suit worn by openly gay San Francisco Supervisor Harvey Milk when he was assassinated on Nov. 27, 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; Milk's executors preserved a significant selection of his belongings after he was assassinated in 1978; they ultimately were inherited by the mother of Milk's former partner, [[Scott Smith (activist)]], who donated them to the GLBT Historical Society. The collection includes everyday objects such the battered, gold-painted kitchen table from Milk's apartment and several antique cameras that had been displayed at [[Castro Camera]], his shop in San Francisco's Castro District. The collection also includes the suit, shirt, belt and shoes Milk was wearing when he was shot to death by assassin [[Dan White]].

Searchable catalogs of the society's manuscript collections, periodicals holdings and oral histories are available on the institution's website, and complete finding aids for the ephemera collections and many of the manuscript collections are available through the Online Archive of California (a project of the [[California Digital Library]]).

==Periodical publications==
From June 1985 through November 2007, the GLBT Historical Society published 50 issues of a print newsletter. Produced at various points in its run as a bimonthly, a quarterly and an irregularly issued periodical, the publication appeared under several titles: ''San Francisco Bay Area Gay and Lesbian Historical Society Newsletter'', ''Newsletter of the Gay and Lesbian Historical Society of Northern California'', ''Our Stories'' and ''It's About Time.''&lt;ref&gt;See the listings under ''San Francisco Bay Area Gay &amp; Lesbian Historical Society Newsletter'' in the [http://www.glbthistory.org/research online periodicals catalog of the GLBT Historical Society].&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2008, the print newsletter was succeeded by an ongoing electronic newsletter, ''History Happens,'' published monthly until 2014, then bimonthly, before returning to a monthly schedule in late 2015. Links to the current issue and several years of back issues are available on the GLBT Historical Society website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glbthistory.org/news/newsletter/ "This Month in &lt;i&gt;History Happens&lt;/i&gt;"], website of the GLBT Historical Society; accessed 2017-12-10.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the society published three issues of a twice-yearly print journal, ''Fabulas,'' which appeared in 2008–2009.

==GLBT History Museum==
[[File:GLBTHistoryMuseum.FrontWindows12 10.jpg|thumb|left|275px|The GLBT History Museum in San Francisco on the evening that it opened for previews, Dec. 10, 2010.]]
On Dec. 10, 2010, the GLBT Historical Society opened its GLBT History Museum in the [[Castro District]] for previews. Located in a storefront at 4127 18th St. near Castro Street, the {{convert|1600|sqft|m2|adj=on}} space houses two historical galleries with room for public programs, a small museum shop and a reception area. The institution is believed to be the second full-scale, stand-alone GLBT history museum in the world, following the [[Schwules Museum]] in Berlin, which opened in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;GLBT Historical Society Media Release (2011-01-12).

The society signed an initial five-year lease for the space in late 2010; the extensive build-out of the museum, along with a significant discount on the monthly rent, was donated by [[Walgreen Company]], which holds the primary lease and uses about one-quarter of the storefront as an extension for operations of its adjacent satellite pharmacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

===Grand opening===
The grand opening of the museum took place on the evening of Jan. 13, 2011. The newly appointed interim mayor of San Francisco, [[Edwin M. Lee]], cut a rainbow ribbon to officially inaugurate the museum; in addition, he presented a proclamation declaring the date "GLBT History Museum Day" in San Francisco. It was Lee's first appearance as mayor at a public event. Also in attendance was [[Scott Wiener]], newly elected as the member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors for the district including the Castro neighborhood — the seat once held by [[Harvey Milk]] — as well as openly gay Supervisor [[David Campos]], who represents the neighboring [[Mission District]]. Other guests included pioneering lesbian activist [[Phyllis Lyon]], novelist [[Armistead Maupin]], photographer [[Daniel Nicoletta]], former supervisor and then mayoral candidate [[Bevan Dufty]], and noted drag personality [[Donna Sachet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

The GLBT History Museum debuted with two multimedia exhibitions. In the larger main gallery, "Our Vast Queer Past: Celebrating San Francisco's GLBT History" traced more than 20 key themes in the past 100 years of the history of LGBT people and communities in San Francisco and the Bay Area. Curated by historians Gerard Koskovich, Don Romesburg and Amy Sueyoshi with help from seven associate curators, the show included more than 450 objects, photographs, documents, costumes, and film and video clips. All the materials were from the society's collections, and most had never before been displayed.&lt;ref&gt;Koskovich, Gerard (2011-01-11).

Among the items in the exhibition were the 1919 honorable discharge of gay novelist Clarkson Crane, who served in [[World War I]]; the only known photograph of gay men held in the camps that the United States created for the [[Japanese-American internment]] during World War II; documents reflecting the life of female-to-male transsexual organizer and author [[Lou Sullivan]] (1950–1991); an extravagant 1983 gown worn by San Francisco drag personality the Baroness Eugenia von Dieckoff (1920–1988); and photographs, flyers and T-shirts from the [[lesbian sex wars]] of the 1980s-1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

In the smaller front gallery, "Great Collections From the GLBT Historical Society Archives," curated by Historical Society Executive Director Paul Boneberg, offered an introduction to the kinds of materials collected by the society. Among the items on display were a distinctive example of the society's collection of textiles: the pantsuits that [[Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon]] wore to their wedding during San Francisco's "Winter of Love" in 2004 and again in 2008 when they became the first couple to wed during the brief period when the state's high court legalized [[same-sex marriage in California]]. On exhibit as examples of the society's artifacts collections were personal belongings of [[Harvey Milk]]. In addition, the show included examples from the society's collections of [[ephemera]]; posters; periodicals; photographs; [[oral history]] interviews; and film, video and recorded sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

===Changing exhibitions===

The debut show in the front gallery of the museum closed at the end of February 2012; the museum then launched a program of periodically changing exhibitions in the space.

The first of these shows opened in early March 2012: "Life and Death in Black and White: AIDS Direct Action in San Francisco, 1985–1990." The exhibition focused on the work of five photographers — Jane Philomen Cleland, Patrick Clifton, Marc Geller, Rick Gerharter and [[Daniel Nicoletta]] — who used the medium of black-and-white film to document the emergence of militant protests in response to the AIDS epidemic in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;GLBT Historical Society Media Release (2012-02-29). [http://archive.constantcontact.com/fs029/1101960178690/archive/1109418908249.html "New photography exhibition at GLBT History Museum focuses on history of AIDS activism"]. Retrieved 2012-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The ''[[Bay Area Reporter]]'' characterized the show as "a concise, laser-focused exhibition ... of 17 carefully selected black-and-white photographs," adding that it "distills the tenor of those times and provides a microcosm of what was at stake as the federal government, either out of obliviousness, callousness, prejudice or a combination of all three, turned a blind eye and deaf ear to the proliferation and devastating impact of the disease."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

The [[Huffington Post]] review noted that "the exhibition highlights the pain, the rage and the bravery involved in the fight for AIDS awareness. The crisp and clean black and white photos bring a feeling of control and simplicity to a time of chaos, when an unnamed disease targeted half of the city's gay men and government agencies seemed incapable of listening. Yet in the darkest times come the brightest inspirations, as thousands of San Franciscans rose to the challenge and fought for their voices to be heard. The striking images capture protestors, students and policemen, chanting, fighting and just living their lives. In a way it is hard to believe these photos were taken so recently, from 1985-1990. And yet the photographs are good reminders of the fights we are still facing today, from marriage equality to the Occupy movement. These activists showed that civil disobedience can impact political outcomes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

In addition to the larger shows in its main and front galleries, The GLBT History Museum mounts temporary exhibits displayed for approximately one month each, most consisting of a single display case devoted to a timely topic or significant anniversary in San Francisco LGBT history. Eight such temporary exhibits took place during 2011.&lt;ref&gt;GLBT Historical Society (2011-12).

===Group tours===

As part of its educational mission, The GLBT History Museum offers group tours led by trained volunteer docents and occasionally by the  exhibition curators. According to the museum home page, any group of 10 or more people may book a guided tour by making an appointment at least two weeks in advance.&lt;ref name="Museum Home Page"&gt;GLBT Historical Society.

In its first 18 months of operation, the museum reported that it had given guided tours for more than 50 classes and student groups, including the GSA from [[Aragon High School]] in San Mateo, Calif.; classes from [[San Francisco State University]]; students from the San Francisco Police Academy; and Japanese medical students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==Vision 2020 "New Museum" campaign==

In June 2016, the GLBT Historical Society announced a long-term initiative to build a "new museum of LGBTQ history and culture" — a world-class center for LGBT [[public history]] projected for completion in the coming decade; the center would include expanded galleries and archives, new spaces for hosting public programs and researchers, and other enhanced facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; The organization launched the campaign, dubbed Vision 2020, with fundraising for capacity building. Early in 2017, the [[San Francisco Board of Supervisors]] passed a resolution "calling on municipal authorities, philanthropists and business leaders to support the GLBT Historical Society’s efforts to develop a new LGBTQ museum and public history center in the city. Supervisor [[Jeff Sheehy]] introduced the resolution, which was cosponsored by Supervisor [[Jane Kim]]. The board voted unanimously in favor of the resolution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Associated projects==
To expand public access to its archival holdings and historical programs, the GLBT Historical Society has sponsored a number of associated projects:

* In 1991, in partnership with the [[University of California, Berkeley]], the society published a microfilm edition of a broad selection of scarce newsletters, magazines and newspapers from its periodicals collection.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Bill (1991). ''San Francisco Bay Area Gay and Lesbian Serials: A guide to the microfilm collection'' (Berkeley, Calif.: University of California).&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 1999, the society launched an annual series of exhibitions known as "Making a Case for Community History." Under the guidance of exhibitions coordinator Paul Gabriel, the project brought together advisory groups from diverse LGBT communities and organizations in San Francisco to curate historical displays sponsored by the society in a variety of public spaces during [[San Francisco Pride]] celebrations in June. The first "Making a Case" exhibition was shown in the mezzanine of the [[Castro Theatre]] during the International LGBT Film Festival ([[Frameline]]) in the last two weeks of June 1999, then in a tent pavilion on the lawn in front of City Hall in [[San Francisco Civic Center]] on the Saturday and Sunday of the Pride festival. The exhibition included separate cases representing [[Asian Americans]] and Pacific Islanders; [[African Americans]]; [[Latinos/as]]; bears—see "[[bear (gay culture)]]"; the [[transgender]] community; and the [[leather subculture]] and SM community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''GermaNet''' is a lexical-semantic net for the [[German language]] that relates [[noun]]s, [[verb]]s, and [[adjective]]s semantically by grouping lexical units that express the same concept into ''[[synset]]s'' and by defining [[semantic]] relations between these synsets.&lt;ref name="Storjohann2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Petra Storjohann|title=Lexical-semantic relations: theoretical and practical perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OYBWObJ547AC&amp;pg=PA165|accessdate=16 November 2011|date=23 June 2010|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|isbn=978-90-272-3138-3|pages=165–}}&lt;/ref&gt; GermaNet is free for academic use, after signing a license. GermaNet has much in common with the English [[WordNet]] and can be viewed as an on-line [[thesaurus]] or a light-weight [[ontology (information science)|ontology]]. GermaNet has been developed and maintained within various projects at the research group for General and Computational Linguistics, [[University of Tübingen]] since 1997. It has been integrated into the [[EuroWordNet]], a multilingual lexical-semantic database.&lt;ref name="homepage"&gt;[http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/GermaNet GermaNet homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Database==

===Contents===
GermaNet  partitions the lexical space into a set of concepts that are interlinked by semantic relations. A semantic concept is modeled by a ''[[synset]]''. A synset is a set of words (called lexical units) where all the words are taken to have the same or almost the same meaning.Thus a synset is a set of synonyms grouped under one definition, or "gloss".

In addition to the gloss, synsets are labeled with their syntactic function and accompanied by example sentences for each distinct meaning in the synset.&lt;ref name="GernEdiT"&gt;V. Henrich, E. Hinrichs. 2010. [http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2010/pdf/264_Paper.pdf GernEdiT - The GermaNet Editing Tool]. In: ''Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on International Language Resources and Evaluation''.&lt;/ref&gt;
Just as in WordNet, for each word category the semantic space is divided into a number of [[semantic field]]s closely related to major nodes in the semantic network: ''Ort'', or "location", ''Körper'', or "body", etc.&lt;ref name="homepage" /&gt;

The following is an up-to-date statistics of GermaNet's version 11.0 contents (release May 2016):

*Number of synsets: 110167
*Number of Lexical Units: 142814
*Number of Literals: 126348
*Number of Conceptual Relations: 123678
*Number of Lexical Relations (synonymy excluded): 4203
*Number of Split Compounds: 66047
*Number of Interlingual Index (ILI) Records: 28567
*Number of Wiktionary Sense Descriptions: 28552&lt;ref name="homepage" /&gt;

===Format===
All GermaNet data is stored in a relational [[PostgreSQL]] 5 database. The database model follows the internal structure of GermaNet: there are tables to store synsets, lexical units, conceptual and lexical relations, etc.&lt;ref name="GernEdiT"/&gt; The distribution format of all GermaNet data is [[XML]]. The two types of files, one for synsets and the other for relations, represent all data that is available in the GermaNet database.

==Interfaces==
There are several [[Application Programming Interface]]s (API) available for [[Java (programming language)|Java]]&lt;ref name="api"&gt;[http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/lsd/tools.shtml GermaNet APIs in Java]&lt;/ref&gt; and for [[Perl]]. These APIs are distributed freely and provide easy access to all information in various versions of GermaNet.

==Licenses==
GermaNet 11.0 (released May 2016) is free for academic. It can be distributed under one of the following types of [[software license agreement|license agreements]]:
* ''Academic Research Agreement'': free for the research purposes of academic institutions. Licenses are not given to individuals, and those seeking a license are required to talk to an academic advisor.

* ''Research and Development Agreement'': applies to non-academic institutions and research consortia. To be used strictly for technology development and internal research.

* ''Commercial Agreement'': applies to non-academic institutions and commercial enterprises. It permits technology development and internal research, as well as giving the non-exclusive right to distribute and market any derived product or service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/lsd/licenses.shtml|title=Licenses|website=www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de|access-date=2017-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Open-de-WordNet==

Open-de-WordNet is freely available WordNet-compatible alternative to GermaNet.&lt;ref name="odenet"&gt;[https://github.com/hdaSprachtechnologie/odenet open-de-wordnet homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
GermaNet has been used for a variety of applications, including semantic analysis, shallow recognition of implicit document structure, compound analysis;&lt;ref&gt;Manuela Kunze and Dietmar Rösner. 2004. Issues in Exploiting GermaNet as a Resource in Real Applications.&lt;/ref&gt; for analyzing sectional preferences,&lt;ref&gt;Sabine Schulte im Walde, 2004. GermaNet Synsets as Selectional Preferences in Semantic Verb Clustering.&lt;/ref&gt; for word sense disambiguation,&lt;ref&gt;Saito et al., 2002. Evaluation of GermanNet: Problems Using GermaNet for Automatic Word Sense Disambiguation.&lt;/ref&gt; etc.

[[File:Invunche Ancud.png|thumb|Imbunche statue in Plaza de Ancud, Chile.]]
In the [[Chiloé Island|Chilote]] [[folklore]] and [[Chilote mythology]] of the [[Chiloé Island]] in southern [[Chile]], the '''imbunche''' or '''invunche''' ([[Mapudungun]] ''ifünche'': "deformed person", also "short person") is a legendary monster that protects the entrance to a warlock's cave.

==Description==
The invunche is a deformed human with its head twisted backwards, along with having twisted arms, fingers, nose, mouth and ears. The creature walks on one foot or on three feet (actually one leg and two hands) because one of its legs is attached to the back of its neck. The invunche cannot talk, and communicates only by guttural, rough and unpleasant sounds.

==Legend==
According to legend, the invunche is a first-born son less than nine days old that was kidnapped by, or sold by his parents to, a [[Brujo Chilote]] (a type of [[Magician (paranormal)|sorcerer]] or [[warlock]] of Chiloé). If the baby had been [[Baptism|christened]], the warlock debaptizes him.

The Brujo chilote transforms the child into a deformed hairy monster by breaking his right leg and twisting it over his back. When the boy is three months old his tongue is forked and the warlock applies a magic cream over the boy's back to cause thick hairs. During its first months the invunche is fed on [[cat|black cat's]] milk and goat flesh,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lira |first=Marcelo |url=http://mitologiadechiloe.blogspot.com/2008/06/el-invunche-es-el-portero-de-la-cueva.html |title=El Invunche ~ MITOLOGIA DE CHILOÉ - Seres Mitologicos. Marcelo Lira Segovia |publisher=Mitologiadechiloe.blogspot.com |date=2013-11-11 |accessdate=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then with human flesh from [[cemetery|cemeteries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chiloemitologico.cl/?page_id=145 |title=El Invunche &amp;#124; Chiloé Mitológico |publisher=Chiloemitologico.cl |date= |accessdate=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides guarding the entrance to the warlock's cave, the invunche is used by warlocks as an instrument for revenge or curses. And, because it has acquired magical knowledge over its lifetime spent guarding the cave, even if the invunche is not initiated into wizardry, it sometimes acts as the warlock's advisor.

The invunche leaves the cave only in certain circumstances, such as when the cave is destroyed or discovered and the warlock moves to another cave, or when the warlocks have need of it and carry it thrashing and yelling, scaring the townspeople and announcing misfortune to come. The invunche also comes out when the warlocks take it to the Warlock's Council.

The invunche is fed solely by warlocks and is only allowed to search for its own edibles if food is lacking inside the cave.

==In popular culture==
Travel writer [[Bruce Chatwin]] gives an account of Chilote witchcraft and the invunche in his book ''In Patagonia''.

British comic book writer [[Alan Moore]] wrote a version of the invunche very similar to Chatwin's description during his run on ''[[Swamp Thing]]'', as an antagonist to John Constantine in the first story he appeared in.

[[Jose Donoso]]'s [[magical realist]] book ''[[The Obscene Bird of Night]]'' reinterprets invunche folklore as a way to bind a male child in a sack to prevent escape and bodily growth.

In the 2014 urban fantasy novel, ''[[Luke_Coles_Book_Series|Luke Coles and the Flower of Chiloe]]'', the invunche is mentioned seven times. Later in the series, invunches appear in great numbers as Righteous Province's (Recta Provincia's) common foot soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joshwalkerbooks.com |title=Josh Walker |publisher=Joshwalkerbooks.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2014 urban fantasy television series ''[[Constantine (TV series)|Constantine]]'' (based on the comics ''Swamp Thing'' and ''[[Hellblazer]]''), the title character says that invunche are nasty creatures that tore out throats during the time of [[Noah]], but were presumed destroyed in the [[Genesis flood narrative|Great Flood]]. A living invunche appears in [[List of Constantine episodes|"The Saint of Last Resorts"]].

In the 2000 novel [[Portrait in Sepia]] (Retrato en Sepia) by Isabel Allende, the character Aurora del Valle recalls being told about the Imbunche in her childhood.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1652">'''Kiev Archive Museum of Transitional Period''' ({{lang-ru|Музей-архив переходного периода}}, {{lang-uk|Музей-Архів Переходової доби}}) was a propaganda [[museum]] whose establishment was sanctioned by German occupants in 1942. The museum existed in April - October 1942. Its expositions demonstrated "achievements" of the [[German occupation]] and crimes of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s regime. The museum's director was a famous [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] historian [[Oleksandr Ohloblyn]] who used this opportunity to organize an exhibition about cultural monuments destroyed by Bolsheviks. Several historians, such as [[Oleksandr Hruzynsky]], [[Svitozar Drahomanov]], [[Natalia Polonska-Vasylenko]] etc. were appointed scientific advisors of the museum. 

However, the propaganda effect of the museum was very low (about 20 visitors daily), and the museum was soon closed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6314">The '''Kunstareal''' ({{IPA-de|ˈkʊnst.aʁeˌaːl|lang}}, "art district") is a [[museum]] quarter in the city centre of [[Munich]], [[Germany]].

== Area of arts ==
[[Image:Alte Pinakothek.JPG|thumb|290px|[[Alte Pinakothek]]]]
It consists of the three "Pinakotheken" galleries ([[Alte Pinakothek]], [[Neue Pinakothek]] and [[Pinakothek der Moderne]]), the [[Glyptothek]], the [[Staatliche Antikensammlungen]] (both museums are specialized in Greek and Roman art), the [[Lenbachhaus]], the [[Museum Brandhorst]] (a private collection of modern art) and several galleries. Also the [[Staatliche Sammlung für Ägyptische Kunst]] (the state collection of Egypt art) was moved to the Kunstareal in 2013. The history of the museums in this area of Munich began in 1816 with the erection of the Glyptothek at [[Königsplatz, Munich|Königsplatz]] and was completed with the new building for the Egyptian Museum (2012) and the extension of the Lenbachhaus (2013). 

Close to the Pinakothek der Moderne the neo-classical ''Palais Dürckheim'' (constructed in 1842&amp;ndash;44) served at times as a building dedicated to bringing art closer to the visitors, while the adjoining ''[[Türkentor (Munich)|Türkentor]]'' (1826), the gate of a demolished royal caserne, is set to become a display window for temporary contemporary art. As of 2009 a general project plan is under discussion to ensure  the integration of the different museum buildings and to improve the access to the art district from the inner city.

The '''Alte Pinakothek's''' rather monolithic structure contains a treasure trove of the works of European masters between the 14th and 18th centuries. The collection reflects the eclectic tastes of the Wittelsbachs over four centuries, and is sorted by schools over two sprawling floors. Major displays include [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s Christ-like ''[[Self-Portrait (Dürer, Munich)|Self-Portrait]]'', his ''[[The Four Apostles]]'', [[Raphael]]'s paintings'' [[Canigiani Holy Family (Raphael)|The Canigiani Holy Family]]'' and'' [[Tempi Madonna (Raphael)|Madonna Tempi]]'' as well as [[Peter Paul Rubens]] self-portrait ''[[Honeysuckle Bower]]'' and his two-storey-high ''Judgment Day''. The gallery houses one of the world's most comprehensive Rubens collections. The ''[[Madonna of the Carnation]]'' is the only painting of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] in a German gallery. 

The '''Neue Pinakothek''' is especially famous for its comprehensive collection of paintings of [[Impressionism]] from [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Édouard Manet]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Edgar Degas]], [[Vincent van Gogh]] and many others.

The '''Pinakothek der Moderne''' unifies the ''Bavarian State Collection of Modern and Contemporary Arts'', the ''National Collection of Works on Paper'' and the ''Museum for Design and Applied Arts'' with the Munich Technical University's ''Museum of Architecture'' in one building and is deemed one of the most important and popular museums of modern art in Europe. It houses indeed the largest collection of industrial design. The Collection of Works on Paper ranges from masterpieces of Albrecht Dürer, [[Rembrandt]], [[Michelangelo]] and Leonardo da Vinci to Paul Cézanne, [[Henri Matisse]], [[Paul Klee]] and [[David Hockney]]. 
It is owned by the nearby '''[[Staatliche Graphische Sammlung München]]''', a world-renowned collection of 400,000 prints, engravings and drawings dating back to the Renaissance. The Collection of Modern Art keeps a large collection of paintings of [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Max Beckmann]] and of the painters of [[Die Brücke]].

Before [[World War I]], the [[Der Blaue Reiter|Blaue Reiter]] group of artists worked in Munich. Many of their works can now be seen at the '''Lenbachhaus'''. 

[[Image:München - Pinakotheken (Luftbild).jpg|thumb|left|Pinakotheken in the Kunstareal]]
The modern '''Museum Brandhorst''' focus on the work of [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Cy Twombly]].

An important collection of Greek and Roman art is held in the '''Glyptothek''' and the '''Staatliche Antikensammlung''' (State Antiquities Collection). King Ludwig I managed to acquire such famous pieces as the ''[[Medusa Rondanini]]'', the ''[[Barberini Faun]]'' and the ''figures from the [[Temple of Aphaea]]'' on [[Aegina]] for the Glyptothek. The internationally renowned collection of antique pottery is outstanding. The '''Museum für Abgüsse klassischer Bildwerke''' displays the world's most famous ancient Greek and Roman sculptures as plaster casts. 

The Kunstareal was further augmented by the completion of the '''Staatliche Sammlung für Ägyptische Kunst''' (Egyptian Museum). This museum displays exhibits from all periods of Ancient Egypt's history but also reliefs from Assyria and a lion from the [[Ishtar Gate]] of Babylon.

Nearby the Kunstareal are several natural scientific museums of the Bavarian state, like the ''[[Paläontologisches Museum München]]'', the ''[[Geologisches Museum München|Geological Museum]]'' and the ''Museum Reich der Kristalle'' as the public part of the "Mineralogische Staatssammlung Muenchen" (Bavarian State Collection for Mineralogy).

== Plot ==

A couple drives to a secluded [[lovers' lane]] on the outskirts of [[Florence]] to have sex, and is gunned down by a gloved prowler, who uses a knife and a tree branch to sexually mutilate the body of the female victim. The double homicide is the latest in a series of them, the work of a serial killer dubbed "Il Mostro" who Christiana Marelli, a [[criminology]] student, is researching for her [[thesis]], to the dismay of her professor, the local police, and her doctor boyfriend, Alex.

As Christiana investigates Il Mostro, she begins receiving strange telephone calls, and finds herself being shadowed by a stalker, who at one point attempts to break into her apartment while she is home alone. A bartender who had offered to meet with Christiana to provide her with information is later found hanged, and Christiana begins to suspect that her boyfriend is Il Mostro due to a combination of mounting circumstantial evidence, Alex's conspicuous absences during all of the murders, and the fact that she had told him about her planned rendezvous with the barkeep shortly before the man was found dead.

After a couple whom she knew personally is murdered by Il Mostro, Christiana attends a [[séance]] in the hope that it can summon the victims' spirits, and shed light on the identity of Il Mostro. During the ceremony, the [[Mediumship|medium]] has a vision of Il Mostro butchering a pair of camping lovers, and spontaneously develops a wound similar to one that Il Mostro had inflicted upon one of the new victims. Christiana leaves the séance and races to the theater that she had last seen Alex at; she finds him there, which seemingly puts to rest her suspicions of him being Il Mostro. The film ends with Christiana making her way to the seat next to Alex (at one point muttering "excuse me" to the viewer) before settling in to watch ''L'assassino è ancora tra noi''.

== Reception ==

''L'assassino è ancora tra noi'' was derisively deemed "incredibly boring" by [[Moviefone]]'s Alison Nastasi, who went to say that while the film did have "a few disturbing scenes" they were not enough to save it from the "banal dialogue" and "bad characters" that made it "a one way trip to dullsville".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.moviefone.com/2010/05/13/theres-always-room-for-giallo-lassassino-e-ancora-tra-noi-th/|title = There's Always Room for Giallo: ''L'assassino è ancora tra noi (The Murderer is Still with Us)''|last = Nastasi|first = Alison|publisher = [[Moviefone]]|date = 13 May 2010|website = moviefone.com|accessdate = 12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various '''LGBT themes''' are present in different in '''African diasporic mythologies''', primary among them being Voodoo.

{{LGBT mythology mini}}

==Voodoo==
[[Image:Samedi.jpg|thumb|Depiction of Baron Samedi, a bisexual lwa.]]
{{See also|Haitian Vodou and sexual orientation}}
A large number of spirits or deities ([[Loa|lwa]]) exist in [[Haitian Vodou|Haitian]] and [[Louisiana Voodoo]]. These lwa may be regarded as families of individuals or as a singular entity with distinct aspects, with links to particular areas of life.

Some lwa have particular links with magic, ancestor worship or death such as the [[Ghede]]s and [[Baron]]s. A number of these are further particularly associated with transgenderism or same-sex interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 157, "Ghede"&lt;/ref&gt; These include [[Ghede Nibo]], a spirit caring for those who die young. He is sometimes depicted as an effeminate drag queen and inspires those he inhabits to lascivious sexuality of all kinds, especially transgender or lesbian behaviour in women.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 157, "Ghede Nibo"&lt;/ref&gt; Ghede Nibo's parents are [[Baron Samedi]] and [[Maman Brigitte]]; Baron Samedi is the leader of the Ghedes and Barons and is depicted as a bisexual dandy or occasionally as transgender, wearing a [[top-hat]] and [[frock coat]] along with a women's skirts and shoes. Samedi has a tendency toward "lascivious movements" that cross gender boundaries and also imply a lust for anal sex.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 83, "Baron Samedi"&lt;/ref&gt;

Other barons displaying gay behaviour are Baron Lundy and Baron Limba, who are lovers and teach a type of homoerotic nude wrestling at their school, believed to increase magical potency.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 83, "Baron Limba" &amp; "Baron Lundy"&lt;/ref&gt; Baron Oua Oua, who often manifests with a childlike aspect, has been called the baron "most closely linked to homosexuality" by Voodoo practictioners.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 83, "Baron Oua Oua"&lt;/ref&gt;

Another lwa, [[Erzulie]], is associated with love, sensuality and beauty. Erzulie can manifest aspects that are LGBT-related, including transgender or amazonian traits, in addition to traditionally feminine guises. When inhabiting men, these aspects can result in transgender or homoerotic behaviour, whereas they may result in lesbianism or anti-male sentiment in women. Erzulie Freda is seen as the protector of gay men, and Erzulie Dantor is associated with lesbians.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 135, "Erzulie"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Santería and Candomblé===
[[Santería]] and [[Candomblé]] are syncretic religions derived from [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] diasporic beliefs and Catholicism, most prevalent in [[South Americas]], including [[Cuba]] and [[Brazil]]. Their mythologies have many similarities to that of Yoruba, and contains a pantheon of [[Orísha]]s (spirits), comparable to (and often identified with) the lwa of Voodoo.

In one Cuban Santería "pataki", or mythological story, the sea goddess [[Yemaha]] is tricked into incestuous sex with her son [[Shango]]. To hide her shame at this event, she banished her other two sons, [[Inle (Santería)|Inle]] and Abbata, to live at the bottom of the ocean, additionally cutting out Inle's tongue and making Abbata deaf. As a result of their isolation and loneliness, Inle and Abbata become passionate friends and then lovers, able to communicate emphatically. This pataki is used to explain the origin of incest, [[muteness]], and [[deafness]] in addition to homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 39, "Abbata"&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="131585">The [[Indonesian language]] has absorbed many [[loanword]]s from other languages, including [[Sanskrit]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and other [[Austronesian languages]].

Indonesian differs from the form of [[Malay language|Malay]] [[Malaysian language|used in Malaysia]] in a number of aspects, primarily due to the different influences both languages experienced and also due to the fact that the majority of Indonesians speak another language as their mother tongue.  Indonesia functioning as lingua franca for speakers of 200 various languages across the archipelago.

Conversely, many words of [[List of English words of Indonesian origin|Malay-Indonesian]] origin have also been [[List of English words of Indonesian origin|borrowed into English]]. Words borrowed into English (e.g., bamboo, orangutan, dugong, amok, and even "cooties") generally entered through Malay language by way of British colonial presence in Malaysia and Singapore, similar to the way the Dutch have been borrowing words from the various native Indonesian languages. One exception is "bantam", derived from the name of the Indonesian province [[Banten]] in Western Java (see Oxford American Dictionary, 2005 edition). Another is "lahar" which is Javanese for a volcanic mudflow. Still other words taken into modern English from Malay/Indonesian probably have other origins (e.g., "satay" from Tamil, or "ketchup" from Chinese).

During development, various native terms (mostly Javanese) from all over the archipelago made their way into the language. The Dutch adaptation of the Malay language during the colonial period resulted in the incorporation of a significant number of Dutch loanwords and vocabulary. This event significantly affected the original Malay language, which gradually developed into modern Indonesian. Most terms are documented in Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia.&lt;ref name="KBBI"&gt;''Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia'', Departemen Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan, Jakarta, Balai Pustaka: 1999, halaman 1185 s.d. 1188 berisikan Pendahuluan buku ''Senarai Kata Serapan dalam Bahasa Indonesia'', Departemen Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan, Jakarta, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chronology ==
The study of Indonesian etymology and loan words reflects its historical and social context. Examples include the early Sanskrit borrowings, probably during the [[Srivijaya]] period, the borrowings from Arabic and Persian, especially during the time of the establishment of Islam, and words borrowed from Dutch during the colonial period. Linguistic history and cultural history are clearly linked.&lt;ref name="Grijns"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kitlv.nl/pdf_documents/asia-loan.pdf |title=Loan-words in Indonesian and Malay |author=C. D. Grijns et al. (eds) |date= |work= |publisher=KITLV |accessdate=26 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213003310/http://www.kitlv.nl/pdf_documents/asia-loan.pdf |archivedate=13 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Early Hindu and Buddhist influence from India results in many [[Sanskrit]] words in Indonesian (and especially adopted through [[Javanese language|Javanese]] influence). Indian traders may have contributed words as well, in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and Sanskrit-related languages.
* Indonesian has envolved through trade with China since ancient times, including through significant numbers of Chinese immigrants migrating to Indonesia. As a result, some of the [[Chinese language]], especially the [[Hokkien]] dialect, has been incorporated into Indonesian.
* Muslim influence, originally through Arabic and Persian traders over a number of centuries, resulted in an extensive influence from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]].
* [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] contact, trade and colonization in the 16th century was the first contact between Indonesia and European culture, and had an influence that remains today, in spite of the relatively short time period of that influence.
* [[Dutch language|Dutch]] colonization and administration, lasting from the 17th century to the 20th, extensively affected the vocabulary. As Dutch-trained linguists determined the rules for the official Indonesian language, Dutch thus affected the structure of the language as well. For example, suffixes such as "-asi" (e.g., administrasi = administratie) and "-if" (e.g., fiktif = fictief) were applied with consistency. Some loan words are still intensively used today, although Indonesian equivalents exist.
* Modern Indonesian regularly adopts new words from other languages, particularly [[English language|English]]. In contrast to the large number of mechanical terms borrowed from Dutch (e.g., automotive parts), hi-tech words are typically taken from English (e.g., internet).

But the processes may also be ‘out of period’; for example, Indonesian words are still being concocted from Sanskrit, and the influence of the Dutch language certainly continued after the Dutch themselves left.&lt;ref name="Grijns"/&gt;

Indonesian has also generalized brand names into common (lower-case) nouns as generic name. For example, "sanyo" refers to any electrical well pump, regardless of manufacturer or "odol" as all of toothpastes. This is similar to the type of generalization that occurs in English words like "xerox" or "tampax" or "polaroid".

===From Austronesian languages===

====From [[Minangkabau language|Minangkabau]]====
Most of Indonesian's vocabulary is natively derived from Malay, but some might ultimately be loanwords from [[Minangkabau language|Minang language]]. Yet it is unclear, since Malay and Minang are closely related, and some might consider Minang to have been an ancestral dialect of Malay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Nurlela Adan, Ermitati, Rosnida M.

====From [[Javanese language|Javanese]]====
Compared to the [[Malay language]] spoken as the native regional language in Sumatra and the Malay peninsula or the standardized version of Malaysian, Indonesian differs profoundly by the large amount of [[Javanese language|Javanese]] loanwords incorporated into their already rich vocabulary. This is mostly contributed by [[Java]]'s position as the center of Indonesian politics, education, and culture, since the capital is located in [[Jakarta]] on Java island, albeit in the area where the Javanese are not the majority. The disproportionate number of Javanese that dominate Indonesian politics is reflected by the fact that six out of seven Indonesian presidents have been ethnic Javanese. The result is that the Javanese began to pour their own vocabulary into Indonesian to describes terms and words that do not have exact counterparts in the Malay language. It is also important to note that most of Indonesian's [[Sanskrit]] loanwords have been transmitted through [[Old Javanese]], a language whose Sanskrit borrowings number almost 50% of the total vocabulary.

====From [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]]====
Besides Javanese, Sundanese is another local language that has influenced Indonesian's vocabulary, albeit to a lesser extent. This can be attributed to the fact that the capital, Jakarta, was formerly a part of [[West Java]], a province which, together with [[Banten]], before it too was divided, constituted the ''Pasundan'' (Sundanese world), the most significant non-Javanese region in an otherwise Javanese-dominated Java island. Some of the most populous cities in Indonesia are also located in the ''Pasundan'', including West Java's capital, [[Bandung]], and Jakarta's four satellite cities ([[Bekasi]], [[Bogor]], [[Depok]], and [[Tangerang]]).

====From [[Betawi language|Betawi]]====
Betawi is a Malay-based [[creole language|creole]] that arose from influences by foreign traders who stopped at the capital, Jakarta, including those from China and Arabia. Most of its speakers are inhabitants of Jakarta, and its influence upon Indonesian is attributed to its frequent usage in Indonesian mass media, including radio and television. Its status as a "hip" language by other portions of Indonesian society is another contributing factor as well.

===From Indian languages===

====From [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]====
{{further|List of Sanskrit loanwords in Indonesian}}

Although [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] are no longer the major religions of Indonesia, [[Sanskrit]], the language vehicle for these religions, is still held in high esteem, and its status is comparable with that of [[Latin]] in [[English language|English]] and other Western European languages. Sanskrit is also the main source for [[neologism]]s; these are usually formed from Sanskrit roots. For example, the name of [[Jayapura]] city (former Hollandia) and [[Jayawijaya Mountains]] (former Orange Range) in the Indonesian province of Papua were coined in the 1960s; both are Sanskrit origin name to replace its Dutch colonial names. Some Indonesian contemporary medals of honor and awards, such as Bintang Mahaputra medal, Kalpataru award and Adipura award, are also Sanskrit derived names.

The loanwords from Sanskrit cover many aspects of [[religion]], [[art]] and everyday life. The Sanskrit influence came from contacts with [[India]] long ago before the 1st century.&lt;ref name="Becoming Indian p.125"&gt;Becoming Indian: The Unfinished Revolution of Culture and Identity by Pavan K. Varma p.125&lt;/ref&gt; The words are either directly borrowed from India or through the intermediary of the [[Old Javanese language]]. In the classical language of Java, Old Javanese, the number of Sanskrit loanwords is far greater. The Old Javanese — English dictionary by Prof. [[P.J. Zoetmulder]], [[Society of Jesus|S.J.]] (1982) contains no fewer than 25,500 entries. Almost half are Sanskrit loanwords. Sanskrit loanwords, unlike those from other languages, have entered the basic vocabulary of Indonesian to such an extent that, for many, they are no longer perceived to be foreign.

====From [[Pali]]====
[[Pali]] (Pāli) is a [[Prakrit]] language and belongs to the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[language family]] together with [[Sanskrit]]. As Sanskrit is the language vehicle of [[Hinduism]], Pali is the language vehicle for [[Buddhism]], especially the [[Theravada]] tradition which is mainly adhered to by Buddhists within [[Indosphere]] [[Southeast Asia]]. Virtually every word in Pāḷi has cognates in the other Middle Indo-Aryan languages, the Prakrits. The relationship to Vedic Sanskrit is less direct and more complicated; the Prakrits were descended from Old Indo-Aryan vernaculars.

====From [[Tamil language|Tamil]]====
Loanwords from Tamil, while also an Indian language (though not Indo-European like Sanskrit), mainly exist in cuisine, like Chinese and unlike Sanskrit. It is a [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian language]] and not an [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan language]]. However, [[Hinduism]] had great impact in [[Tamil people|Tamil]], there are several [[Indo-Aryan loanwords in Tamil]] and they are possibility to list them in Indo-Aryan loanwords, such as [[Sanskrit]].

Interaction between Tamil speakers and Malay speakers has been established from ancient time. Tamil influence has been around such as [[Pallava dynasty|Palava]] usage as ancient script in Indonesia (Palava dynasty was existed on 275 CE–897 CE) and [[Chola invasion of Srivijaya]] in 1025. It mainly entered the lexicon of Malay (and by extension, Indonesian) with the immigration of South Indian traders who settled around the [[Strait of Malacca]].

===From Middle Eastern languages===

====From [[Arabic language|Arabic]]====
The loanwords from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] are mainly concerned with religion, in particular with [[Islam]]. [[Allah]] is the word for [[God]] even in [[Christian]] [[Bible]] translations.  Many early Bible translators, when they came across some unusual [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] words or proper names, used the Arabic cognates. In the newer translations, this practice has been discontinued. They now turn to [[Greek language|Greek]] names or use the original Hebrew word. For example, the name [[Jesus]] was initially translated as '''Isa'', but is now spelt as ''Yesus''. [[Psalm]]s used to be translated as ''Zabur'', the Arabic name, but now it is called ''Mazmur'' which corresponds more with Hebrew.

===From East Asian languages===

====From [[Chinese language|Chinese]]====
{{further|List of Chinese loanwords in Indonesian}}

The [[Chinese language|Chinese]] loanwords are usually concerned with cuisine, trade or often just exclusively things Chinese. According to the 2000 [[census]], the relative number of people of [[Chinese Indonesian|Chinese descent in Indonesia]] (termed the ''peranakan'') is almost 1% (totaling to about 3 million people, although this may likely be an underestimate due to an anti-Chinese sentiment that exists in some circles of the population), yet the ''peranakan'' are the most successful when it comes to business, trade, and cuisine.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Words of [[Chinese language|Chinese]] origin (presented here with accompanying Hokkien/ Mandarin pronunciation derivatives as well as traditional and simplified characters) include ''pisau'' (匕首 bǐshǒu  – knife), ''mie'' ([[Traditional Chinese characters|T]]:麵, [[Simplified Chinese characters|S]]:面, Hokkien mī – noodles), ''[[lumpia]]'' (潤餅 (Hokkien = lūn-piáⁿ) – springroll), ''teko'' ([[Traditional Chinese characters|T]]:茶壺, [[Simplified Chinese characters|S]]:茶壶 = cháhú [Mandarin], teh-ko [Hokkien] = teapot), 苦力 kuli = 苦　khu (bitter) and 力　li (energy) and even the widely used slang terms ''gua'' and ''lu'' (from the Hokkien 'goa' 我 and 'lu/li' 你 – meaning 'I/ me' and 'you'). Almost all loanwords in Indonesian of Chinese origin come from [[Hokkien]] (福建) or [[Hakka]] (客家).

====From [[Japanese language|Japanese]]====
{{further|List of Japanese loanwords in Indonesian}}

Japanese is an East Asian language spoken by about 126 million people, primarily in [[Japan]], where it is the official language and national language. The influx of Japanese loanword can be classified into two periods, [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|Japanese colonial administration]] period (1942–1945) and globalisation of [[Japanese popular culture]] (1980-now). As Indonesian is written using Latin script, [[Romanization of Japanese|Japanese romanisation systems]] influence the spelling in Indonesian.

====From [[Korean language|Korean]]====
In contrast with [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]], Korean loanword mostly related to Korean culture. These loanword is attributed to increasing popularity of [[South Korean culture]]. Since the turn of the 21st century, South Korea has emerged as a major exporter of popular culture and tourism, aspects which have become a significant part of its burgeoning economy. This phenomenon is called [[Korean Wave]].

===From European languages===
The European influence on Indonesian is largely related to European intervention and colonialism. The most significant consequence is the continued use of the Latin alphabet instead of various local scripts. 

The Portuguese arrived first in the archipelago and influenced the original Malay language after their conquest of Malacca. Portuguese dominance over trade in the region and control of the spice islands of Moluccas significantly increased Portuguese influence, as did the introduction of Christianity in the region. 

However, Dutch has had the most influence on the language, as a result of the Dutch having controlled Indonesia for 300 years after eliminating the Portuguese as a player in the archipelago. The Dutch language itself wasn't properly introduced into the archipelago before 1799, when the Netherlands' crown took over the colony from the already bankrupt VOC (Dutch East India company). Previously, the Malay language had adopted by the VOC due to its trade and diplomatic benefit, which led to large numbers of loanwords being introduced into the language. 

English has also exerted a certain influence on the archipelago's language, being the third most favored foreign language by the educated in colonial days. More recently, English has played an increasingly large role in the nation's official language as a result of globalization.

====From [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]====
Alongside [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] was the ''[[lingua franca]]'' for trade throughout the archipelago from the sixteenth century through to the early nineteenth century. The Portuguese were among the first westerners to sail east to the "[[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]]". Loanwords from [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] were mainly connected with articles the early European traders and explorers brought to Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name="RICKLEFSp24"&gt;{{Cite book | last =Ricklefs  | first =M.C.  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title =A History of Modern Indonesia Since c.1300, 2nd Edition  | publisher =MacMillan  | year =1991  | location =London  | page =26  | url =  | doi =  | isbn = 0-333-57689-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====From [[Spanish language|Spanish]]====
As [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] loan word come from colonialism in [[Spanish East Indies|East Indies]]. In 1606, the Spaniards established some form of trade links with the Maluku Islands. In 1529, Charles I of Spain relinquished all claims to the Spice Islands to Portugal in the treaty of Zaragoza. Thus, there are fewer loanwords from Spanish than Portuguese or Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

====From [[Dutch language|Dutch]]====
{{further|List of Dutch loanwords in Indonesian}}

The former colonial power, the [[Netherlands]], left an extensive imprint on Indonesian vocabulary. These [[Dutch language|Dutch]] loanwords, as well as other non Italo-Iberian European language loanwords which were introduced via Dutch, cover all aspects of life. Some Dutch loanwords possessing clusters of multiple consonants pose difficulties for speakers of Indonesian. This problem is usually solved by the insertion of the [[schwa]]. For example, Dutch ''schroef'' {{IPA|[ˈsxruf]}} → ''sekrup'' {{IPA|[səˈkrup]}}. Many Indonesian vocabulary ending "-i" (e.g.:administras-i) can also be traced to the influence of Dutch vocabulary "-ie" (e.g.:administrat-ie). The months from January (Januari) to December (Desember) used in Indonesian are also derived from Dutch. It is estimated that 10,000 words in the Indonesian language can be traced back to the Dutch language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reference.com/browse/indonesian+language ]{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====From [[Latin language|Latin]]====
It is notable that some of the loanwords that exist in both Indonesian and Malaysian languages are different in spelling and pronunciation mainly due to how they derived their origins: Malaysian utilizes words that reflect the English usage (as used by its former colonial power, the British), while Indonesian uses a Latinate form reflected in the Dutch usage (e.g. aktiviti (Malaysian) vs. aktivitas (Indonesian), universiti (Malaysian) vs. universitas (Indonesian)).

Many English words are adopted in Indonesian through globalization, due to this however many Indonesians mistake words that were originally adopted from Dutch with English due to the Germanic traces that exist in the two languages (both are Indo-European Germanic languages from the same branch, the West Germanic).

====From [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]]====
The North Germanic languages make up one of the three branches of the Germanic languages, a sub-family of the Indo-European languages, along with the West Germanic languages and the extinct East Germanic languages. The language group is sometimes referred to as the "Nordic languages", a direct translation of the most common term used among Danish, Swedish, Icelandic and Norwegian scholars and laypeople.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10520">[[File:MEL-Institute-1931.jpg|thumb|260px|The Lenin Institute building in Moscow as it appeared in 1931]]
The '''Marx–Engels–Lenin Institute''', established in [[Moscow]] in 1919 as the '''Marx–Engels Institute''' ({{lang-ru|Институт К. Маркса и Ф. Энгельса}}), was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] library and archive attached to the [[Communist Academy]]. The institute was later attached to the governing [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] and served as a research center and publishing house for officially published works of [[Marxism|Marxist]] doctrine.

The Marx–Engels Institute gathered unpublished manuscripts by [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels]], [[Vladimir Lenin]] and other leading [[theoretician (Marxism)|Marxist theoreticians]] as well as collecting books, pamphlets and periodicals related to the [[socialism|socialist]] and [[trade union|organized labor]] movements. By 1930, the facility's holdings included more than 400,000 books and journals and more than 55,000 original and photocopy documents by Marx and Engels alone, making it one of the largest and richest holdings of socialist-related material in the world.

In February 1931, director of the Marx–Engels Institute [[David Riazanov]] and others on the staff were purged for ideological reasons. In November of that same year, the Marx–Engels Institute was merged with the larger and less scholarly [[Lenin Institute]] (established in 1923) to form the Marx–Engels–Lenin Institute.

The institute was the coordinating authority for the systematic organization of documents released in the multi-volume works ''[[Marx-Engels-Gesamtausgabe]]'' (''Marx-Engels Collected Works''), Lenin's ''[[Polnoe sobranie sochineniia]]'' (''Complete Collected Works''), [[Joseph Stalin]]'s ''[[Stalin's Works|Sochineniia]]'' (''Works'') and numerous other official publications. The institute was officially terminated in November 1991, with the bulk of its archival holdings now residing with a successor organization, the [[Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History]] (RGASPI).

== History ==
=== Establishment ===
[[File:Riazanov.jpg|thumb|200px|[[David Riazanov]] (1870–1938), head of the Marx–Engels Institute from its formation in 1919 until his arrest in February 1931]]
The Marx–Engels Institute was established in 1919 by the government of [[Soviet Russia]] as a branch of the [[Communist Academy]], intended as an academic research facility to conduct historical studies and to collect documents deemed relevant to the new socialist regime.&lt;ref name=Barber15&gt;John Barber (1981). ''Soviet Historians in Crisis, 1928–1932.'' London: Macmillan. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; First director of the facility, located in [[Moscow]], was [[David Riazanov]].&lt;ref name=Barber15/&gt;

The institute assembled and maintained a [[research library]] devoted to [[Socialism|socialist]]-related theme, amassing in a little over 10 years a collection of some 400,000 books, pamphlets, and journals, 15,000 manuscripts and 175,000 photocopies of original documents held elsewhere.&lt;ref name=Barber15/&gt; Among these were 55,000 manuscripts by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] alone—far and away the single most important accumulation of such material.&lt;ref name=Barber15/&gt;

The institute included an academic staff which engaged in research on historical and topical themes of interest to the regime. The institute included sections devoted to the history of the [[International Workingmen's Association|First]] and [[Second International]]s, the history of [[Germany]], the history of [[France]], the history of [[Great Britain]], the history of the [[United States]], the history of the countries of [[Southern Europe]] and the history of [[international relations]].&lt;ref name=Barber15/&gt; Also included were sections working in philosophy, economics, political science and the history of socialism in Slavic countries.&lt;ref&gt;Barber, ''Soviet Historians in Crisis'', pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main research orientation of the facility was towards history rather than other social sciences.&lt;ref name=Barber16&gt;Barber, ''Soviet Historians in Crisis,'' p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1930, of the 109 employed by the Marx–Engels Institute, fully 87 were historians.&lt;ref name=Barber16/&gt; While working under the watchful eyes of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|All-Union Communist Party]], the Marx–Engels Institute was not a one-party affair in its formative decade, with just 39 of its staff members also members of the Communist Party in 1930.&lt;ref name=Barber16/&gt;

During its first decade, the institute published an array of books by the likes of [[Georgi Plekhanov]], [[Karl Kautsky]], [[Franz Mehring]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[David Ricardo]] and [[Adam Smith]] as well as the anticipated multi-volume works of Marx and Engels.&lt;ref name=Barber16/&gt; The institute also published two regular academic journals, ''Arkhiv Karla Marksa i Friderikha Engel'sa'' (''Archive of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels'') and ''Letopis' marksizma'' (''Marxist Chronicle'').&lt;ref name=Barber16/&gt;

=== Lenin Institute ===
The Lenin Institute began as an independent archival project, established by the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in 1923 to gather manuscripts with a view to publication of a scholarly edition of [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s collected works.&lt;ref name=Barber16/&gt; This work was accomplished through the publication of a thick periodical called ''Leninskii sbornik'' (''Lenin Miscellany''), some 25 numbers of which were published between 1924 and 1933.&lt;ref name=Barber16/&gt;

The mission of the Lenin Institute was expanded in 1924 by the [[13th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|13th Congress of the Russian Communist Party]] to include the "study and dissemination of [[Leninism]] among the broad masses within and outside the party",&lt;ref&gt;"[http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Thirteenth+Congress+of+the+Russian+Communist+Party+Bolshevik Thirteenth Congress of the Russian Communist Party Bolshevik]" in ''[[The Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' (1979), it quotes ''KPSS v rezoliutsiiakh i resheniiakh s"ezdov, konferentsii i plenumov TsK'', 8th ed., vol. 3, 1970, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; namely an enlarged purview which rendered obsolete the previously existing {{Interlanguage link multi|Commission on the History of the October Revolution and the History of the Communist Party|ru|3=Истпарт}} (Istpart).&lt;ref&gt;Barber, ''Soviet Historians in Crisis,'' pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928, Istpart was dissolved and its functions fully absorbed by the Lenin Institute.&lt;ref name=Barber16/&gt;

The Lenin Institute was a slightly larger entity than the Marx–Engels Institute, with a staff of 158 in 1929, but it did not share the reputation for impartial scholarship enjoyed by the older research library and scholarly think tank.&lt;ref name=Barber17&gt;Barber, ''Soviet Historians in Crisis'', p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lenin Institute was initially headed by [[Lev Kamenev]], followed by [[Ivan Skvortsov-Stepanov]] and after his death in 1928 by {{Interlanguage link multi|Maximilian Savelev|ru|3=Савельев, Максимилиан Александрович}}.&lt;ref name=Barber17/&gt;

=== 1931 restructuring ===
In February 1931 as part of the [[1931 Menshevik Trial|Menshevik Trial]] in February 1931, economist [[Isaak Rubin]]—a former employee of the Marx–Engels Institute—implicated the head of the institute David Riazanov as part of the conspiracy, with Riazanov accused of having hidden [[Mensheviks|Menshevik]] documents in the facility.&lt;ref name=Barber122&gt;Barber, ''Soviet Historians in Crisis,'' p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; Although modern scholars consider the accusation in the February [[show trial]] to have been extremely dubious, Riazanov was nevertheless arrested and sent into exile outside of Moscow.&lt;ref name=Barber122/&gt; A purge of Marx–Engels Institute staff deemed to be ideologically suspicious followed.&lt;ref name=Barber122/&gt; In the wake of the ideological [[Purges of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|purges]] of the Marx–Engels Institute in November 1931, the institute was merged with the larger Lenin Institute to form the Marx–Engels–Lenin Institute.&lt;ref name=Barber122/&gt;

=== Later name changes ===
The Marx–Engels–Lenin Institute was subsequently renamed multiple times. In 1952, the facility's formal attachment to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was formally noted with the expanded moniker Marx-Engels–Lenin Institute of the CC CPSU ({{lang-ru|Институт Маркса—Энгельса—Ленина при ЦК КПСС|links=no}}). The name of deceased Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] was added in 1956, with the institute formally becoming the Marx–Engels–Lenin–Stalin Institute of the CC CPSU.

This remained in place until the onset of [[de-Stalinization]] following the so-called [[Secret Speech]] of [[Nikita Khrushchev]] in 1956. At this point, the name changed to Institute of Marxism–Leninism of the CC CPSU ({{lang-ru|Институт марксизма-ленинизма при ЦК КПСС|links=no}}). This name remained unaltered for nearly 35 years, when turmoil in the Soviet Union brought about a name change to Institute of the Theory and History of Socialism of the CC CPSU ({{lang-ru|Институт теории и истории социализма ЦК КПСС|links=no}}). The institute formally ceased to exist in November 1991 following the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]], with the institute's library and archive transferred to control to a new entity called the Russian Independent Institute for Social and National Problems.

The Central Party Archive of the institute was placed under the control of the [[Ministry of Culture (Russia)|Russian Ministry of Culture]] and eventually emerged as the [[Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History]] (RGASPI).

A '''Muslim''' ({{lang-ar|مُسلِم}}) is someone who follows or practices [[Islam]], a [[monotheistic]] [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic religion]]. Muslims consider the [[Quran]], their [[holy book]], to be the verbatim word of [[God in Islam|God]] as revealed to the [[Muhammad in Islam|Islamic]] [[Prophets and messengers in Islam|prophet and messenger]] [[Muhammad]]. The majority of Muslims also follow the teachings and practices of Muhammad (''[[sunnah]]'') as recorded in traditional accounts (''[[hadith]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Qurʼan and Sayings of Prophet Muhammad: Selections Annotated &amp; Explained|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vzx8HlsGnTcC&amp;pg=PR21|accessdate=31 August 2013|year=2007|publisher=SkyLight Paths Publishing|isbn=978-1-59473-222-5|pages=21–}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Muslim" is an [[Arabic language|Arabic word]] meaning "submitter" (to God).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Muslim|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Muslim|publisher=etymonline.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20150907223337/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Muslim|archivedate=7 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The beliefs of Muslims include: that God ({{lang-ar|الله}} ''[[Allāh|{{transl|ar|ALA|Allāh}}]]'') is eternal, transcendent and absolutely one (''[[tawhid]]''); that God is incomparable, self-sustaining and neither begets nor was begotten; that Islam is the complete and universal version of a primordial faith that has been revealed before through many prophets including [[Abraham in Islam|Abraham]], [[Ishmael in Islam|Ishmael]], [[Isaac in Islam|Isaac]], [[Moses in Islam|Moses]], and [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]];&lt;ref name="People-of-the-Book"/&gt; that these previous messages and revelations have been partially changed or corrupted over time (''[[tahrif]]'')&lt;ref name="Distorted"/&gt; and that the Qur'an is the final unaltered revelation from God (Final Testament).&lt;ref&gt;Submission.org, Quran: The Final Testament, Authorized English Version with Arabic Text, Revised Edition IV,{{ISBN|0-9729209-2-7}}, p. x.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qualifier==
The religious practices of Muslims are enumerated in the [[Five Pillars of Islam]]: the declaration of faith (''[[shahadah]]''), daily prayers (''[[salat]]''), fasting during the month of [[Ramadan]] (''[[sawm]]''), almsgiving (''[[zakat]]''), and the pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] (''[[hajj]]'') at least once in a lifetime.&lt;ref name="WSU" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CIA" /&gt;

To become a Muslim and to convert to Islam, it is essential to utter the ''[[Shahada]]'', one of the [[Five Pillars of Islam]], a [[declaration of faith]] and trust that professes that there is [[tawhid|only one]] [[God in Islam|God]] ''([[Allah]])'' and that [[Muhammad]] is God's messenger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e1859 From the article on the Pillars of Islam in Oxford Islamic Studies Online] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20170426134526/http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e1859 |date=26 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a set statement normally recited in Arabic: ''lā ʾilāha ʾillā-llāhu muḥammadun rasūlu-llāh'' ({{lang|ar|لَا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا الله مُحَمَّدٌ رَسُولُ الله}})  "There is no god but Allah, (and) Muhammad is the messenger of God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vHG_VulBdd4C&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=convert+islam+shahada#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Matthew S.

In [[Sunni Islam]], the shahada has two parts: ''la ilaha illa'llah'' (there is no god but [[Allah|God]]), and ''Muhammadun rasul Allah'' ([[Muhammad]] is the messenger of God),&lt;ref name="LS"&gt;Lindsay, p.&amp;nbsp;140–141&lt;/ref&gt; which are sometimes referred to as the first ''shahada'' and the second ''shahada''.&lt;ref name="Cornell9"&gt;Cornell, p.&amp;nbsp;9&lt;/ref&gt; The first statement of the shahada is also known as the ''[[tahlil|tahlīl]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Anthony Sells|title=Approaching the Qur'an: The Early Revelations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EYCFTVDDKmkC|year=1999|publisher=White Cloud Press|page=151|isbn=9781883991265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Shia Islam]], the shahada also has a third part, a phrase concerning [[Ali]], the first [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|Shia Imam]] and the fourth [[Rashidun|Rashid caliph]] of [[Sunni Islam]]: {{lang|ar|وعليٌ وليُّ الله}} ({{transl|ar|DIN|wa ʿalīyyun walīyyu-llāh}}), which translates to "Ali is the ''[[wali]]'' of God.&lt;ref&gt;''The Later Mughals'' by [[William Irvine (historian)|William Irvine]] p.&amp;nbsp;130&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lexicology==
{{see also|Islam#Etymology and meaning}}
The word ''muslim'' ({{lang-ar|مسلم}}, {{IPA-ar|ˈmʊslɪm|IPA}}; {{IPAc-en|lang|ˈ|m|ʌ|z|l|ᵻ|m}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ʊ|z|l|ᵻ|m}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ʊ|s|l|ᵻ|m}} or ''moslem'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɒ|z|l|ə|m}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɒ|s|l|ə|m}}&lt;ref name="muslim pron" /&gt;) is the [[active participle]] of the same verb of which ''islām'' is a [[verbal noun]], based on the [[triliteral]] ''[[S-L-M]]'' "to be whole, intact".&lt;ref&gt;Burns &amp; Ralph, ''World Civilizations'', 5th ed., p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Entry for ''šlm'', p. 2067, Appendix B: Semitic Roots, ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'', 4th ed., Boston, New York: Houghton Mifflin, 2000, {{ISBN|0-618-08230-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A female adherent is a ''muslima'' ({{lang-ar|مسلمة}}) (also [[transliteration|transliterated]] as "Muslimah"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/muslimah Muslimah] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817020605/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/muslimah |date=17 August 2016 }}. ''Oxford Dictionaries''. Oxford University Press. 2016&lt;/ref&gt; ). The plural form in Arabic is ''muslimūn'' ({{lang|ar|مسلمون}}) or ''muslimīn'' ({{lang|ar|مسلمين}}), and its feminine equivalent is ''muslimāt'' ({{lang|ar|مسلمات}}). The Arabic form ''muslimun'' is the stem IV [[Arabic grammar#Participle|participle]]{{refn|group=note|name=participle|also known as "infinitive"}} of the triliteral ''S-L-M''.

The ordinary word in English is "Muslim". It is sometimes [[transliteration|transliterated]] as "Moslem", which is an older spelling.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} The word ''Mosalman'' ({{lang-fa|مسلمان}}, alternatively ''Mussalman'') is a common equivalent for ''Muslim'' used in [[Central Asia|Central]] and [[South Asia]]. Until at least the mid-1960s, many English-language writers used the term ''[[Mohammedan]]s'' or ''Mahometans''.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance the second edition of ''[[Fowler's Modern English Usage|A Dictionary of Modern English Usage]]'' by [[Henry Watson Fowler|H. W. Fowler]], revised by [[Ernest Gowers]] (Oxford, 1965).&lt;/ref&gt; Although such terms were not necessarily intended to be [[pejorative]], Muslims argue that the terms are offensive because they allegedly imply that Muslims worship Muhammad rather than God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| last = Gibb| first = Sir Hamilton| title = Mohammedanism: an historical survey| year = 1969| page=1 | quote=Modern Muslims dislike the terms Mohammedan and Mohammedanism, which seem to them to carry the implication of worship of Mohammed, as Christian and Christianity imply the worship of Christ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other obsolete terms include ''Muslimite''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED|Muslimite}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Muslimist''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abbas|first1=Tahir|title=Muslim Britain: Communities Under Pressure|date=2005|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Musulmán'''/'''Mosalmán''' ({{lang-fa|مسلمان}}) is a synonym for ''Muslim'' and is modified from [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. It is the origin of the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''{{lang|es|musulmán}}'', the (dated) [[German language|German]] ''{{lang|de|Muselmann}}'', the French word ''musulman'', the [[Polish language|Polish]] words ''{{lang|pl|muzułmanin}}'' and ''{{lang|pl|muzułmański}}'', the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] word ''{{lang|pt|muçulmano}}'', the [[Italian language|Italian]] word ''{{lang|it|mussulmano}}'' or ''{{lang|it|musulmano}}'', the [[Romanian language|Romanian]] word ''musulman'' and the [[Greek Language|Greek]] word {{lang|el|μουσουλμάνος}} (all used for a Muslim).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religion-encyclopedia.com/M/musalman.htm Musalman] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070104031529/http://www.religion-encyclopedia.com/M/musalman.htm |date=4 January 2007 }} – Internet Encyclopedia of Religion&lt;/ref&gt; In English it was sometimes spelled '''Mussulman''' and has become [[Archaism|archaic]] in usage.

Apart from Persian, Spanish, Polish, Portuguese, Italian, and Greek, the term could be found, with obvious local differences, in [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Dari (Persian dialect)|Dari]], [[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[Urdu]], [[Hindi]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Panjabi language|Panjabi]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]], [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]], [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]], [[Azerbaijani language|Azeri]], [[Maltese language|Maltese]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], and [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]].

==Meaning==
The Muslim philosopher [[Ibn Arabi]] said:

{{Quote|A Muslim is a person who has dedicated his worship exclusively to God...''Islam'' means making one's religion and faith God's alone.&lt;ref&gt;''Commentary on the Qur'an'', Razi, I, p. 432, Cairo, 1318/1900&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Other prophets===
The Qur'an describes many prophets and messengers within Judaism and Christianity, and their respective followers, as Muslim: [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]], [[Noah]], [[Abraham in Islam|Abraham]], [[Ishmael in Islam|Ishmael]], [[Jacob]], [[Islamic view of Moses|Moses]], and [[Islamic view of Jesus|Jesus]] and his [[apostles]] are all considered to be Muslims in the Qur'an. The Qur'an states that these men were Muslims because they submitted to God, preached His message and upheld His values, which included praying, charity, fasting and pilgrimage. Thus, in Surah 3:52 of the Qur'an, Jesus' disciples tell him, "We believe in God; and you be our witness that we are Muslims (''wa-shahad be anna muslimūn'')." In Muslim belief, before the Qur'an, God had given the [[Tawrat]] ([[Torah]]) to Moses, the [[Zabur]] ([[Psalms]]) to [[David]] and the [[Injil]] ([[Gospel]]) to Jesus, who are all considered important [[Prophets of Islam|Muslim prophets]].

An '''ornithological handbook''' is a book (or series of books) giving summarised information either about the birds of a particular [[geography|geographical]] area or a particular [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] group of birds. Some handbooks cover many aspects of their subjects' biology, whereas others focus on specific topics, particularly identification.

[[File:1stViscountDunedin.jpg|thumb|[[Andrew Murray, 1st Viscount Dunedin|Lord Dunedin]], who first tried to rationalise the law on penalties in 1914 in ''[[Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v New Garage &amp; Motor Co Ltd]]''.]]

'''Penalties in English law''' are [[Contractual terms in English law|contractual terms]] which are not enforceable in the courts because of their penal character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Chitty on Contracts]]|publisher=[[Sweet &amp; Maxwell]]|year=2012|edition=31st|volume=1|at=26–171}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since at least 1720&lt;ref name=Peachy&gt;''Peachy v Duke of Somerset'' (1720) 1 Strange 447.&lt;/ref&gt; it has been accepted as a matter of [[English contract law]] that if a provision in a contract constitutes a penalty, then that provision is unenforceable by the parties.  However, the test for what constitutes a penalty has evolved over time.  The [[United Kingdom Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] most recently restated the law in relation to contractual penalties in the co-joined appeals of ''[[Cavendish Square Holding BV v Talal El Makdessi]]'', and ''ParkingEye Ltd v Beavis''.&lt;ref name=Makdessi&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=[[Cavendish Square Holding BV v Talal El Makdessi]]|court=UKHL |division= |year=2015 |num=67 |date=4 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law relating to contractual penalties in England has been entirely developed by judges at [[common law]] without general statutory intervention.  The [[United Kingdom Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] has noted that "[t]he  penalty  rule  in  England  is  an  ancient,  haphazardly  constructed  edifice which has not weathered well".&lt;ref name=Makdessi/&gt;

However, in addition to the common law rules relating to penalties, there are statutes which make express provision for avoidance of onerous clauses, such as the [[Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977]] and the [[Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999]].

==History==

The origin of the common law rules relating to penalties is often taken to be the decision of the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] in the ''[[Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v New Garage &amp; Motor Co Ltd]]'' decision in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v New Garage &amp; Motor Co Ltd |court=UKHL |division= |year=1914 |num=1 |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  But the jurisdiction is actually much older.  The oldest reported case relating to penalties appears to date from 1720,&lt;ref name=Peachy /&gt; but even that case is decided on the basis that penalties were already generally considered unenforceable.

In their decision in ''Makdessi'' the Supreme Court reviewed the historical origins of the rule against penalty clauses in contracts.&lt;ref&gt;''Makdessi'' at paragraphs 4-12.&lt;/ref&gt;  The law originated in the fifteenth century in relation to "defeasible bonds" (sometimes called [[penal bond]]s) which were a contractual promise to pay money, which might be discharged if certain obligations were performed (and if the obligations were not performed, then the payment terms under the bond could be enforced).&lt;ref&gt;Professor [[A. W. B. Simpson]], ''The  penal  bond  with  conditional defeasance'' (1966) 82 [[Law Quarterly Review|LQR]] 392, 418-419&lt;/ref&gt;  However the courts of equity regarded these as what they really were - security for performance of the underlying obligation - and were prepared to restrain enforcement of such bonds where the defaulting party paid any damages due at common law.&lt;ref&gt;''Sloman v Walter'' (1783) 1 Bro CC 418, at 419 per [[Edward Thurlow, 1st Baron Thurlow|Lord Thurlow LC]].&lt;/ref&gt;  In time the courts of common law began to mirror this approach and stay any proceedings on such bonds where the defendant gave an undertaking to pay damages together with interest and costs.  The position of the common law courts was adopted and codified in the [[Administration of Justice Act 1696]] and later the [[Administration of Justice Act 1705]].  Accordingly, procedurally relief in relation to such bonds was thereafter administered entirely by the common law courts without intervention by the courts of equity.  However, the courts of equity began to develop concurrent remedies for relief from forfeiture.  With the decline of the use of defeasible bonds the procedural mechanics became increasingly applied to [[liquidated damages clause]]s.

However, the decision in ''Dunlop'' in 1914 was taken to authoritatively restate the law.  That case concerned what was expressed to be a liquidated damages clause.  The courts had to determine whether the clause was in fact a penalty.  The leading judgment was given by [[Andrew Murray, 1st Viscount Dunedin|Lord Dunedin]], who opined as follows:

{{cquote|Though the parties to a contract who use the words "penalty" or "liquidated damages" may ''[[prima facie]]'' be supposed to mean what they say, yet the expression used is not conclusive. The Court must find out whether the payment stipulated is in truth a penalty or liquidated damages.

...

The essence of a penalty is a payment of money stipulated as ''[[in terrorem]]'' of the offending party; the essence of liquidated damages is a genuine covenanted pre-estimate of damage.

...

It will be held to be penalty if the sum stipulated for is extravagant and unconscionable in amount in comparison with the greatest loss that could conceivably be proved to have followed from the breach.

...

It is no obstacle to the sum stipulated being a genuine pre-estimate of damage, that the consequences of the breach are such as to make precise pre-estimation almost an impossibility. On the contrary, that is just the situation when it is probable that pre-estimated damage was the true bargain between the parties.&lt;ref&gt;[1915] AC 79, 86–88.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Difficulties with the rule==

The rule is one which judges over the years have confessed difficulty with.  In ''Astley v Weldon''&lt;ref&gt;(1801) 2 Bos &amp; Pul 346 at 350&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Scott, 1st Earl of Eldon|Lord Eldon]] admitted ("not for the first time" according to the Supreme Court in ''Makdessi''&lt;ref&gt;''Makdessi'', at paragraph 3.&lt;/ref&gt;) to being "much embarrassed in ascertaining the principle on which [the rule was] founded".  In ''Wallis v Smith'',&lt;ref&gt;(1882) 21 Ch D 243 at 256&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Jessel (jurist)|Sir George Jessel MR]] similarly confessed: "The ground of that doctrine I do not know". In ''Robophone Facilities Ltd v Blank''&lt;ref&gt;[1966] 1 WLR 1428&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Diplock, Baron Diplock|Diplock LJ]] famously said that he would make "no attempt where so many others have failed to rationalise this common law rule".

Although the decision of Lord Dunedin sought to bring greater clarity to the law in 1914, in practice it often proved difficult to apply.  Cases continued to come before the courts challenging provisions as a penalty, and the courts continued to wrestle with the issue.  In ''Workers Trust &amp; Merchant Bank Ltd v Dojap Investments Ltd''&lt;ref&gt;[1993] AC 573&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson, Baron Browne-Wilkinson|Lord Browne Wilkinson]] tried to describe the scope of the law of penalties, and noted the slightly anomalous rules in relation to forfeiture of deposits in relation to sales of land: "In general a contractual provision which requires one party in the event of his breach of contract to pay or forfeit a sum of money to the other party is unlawful as being a penalty, unless such provision can be justified as being a payment of liquidated damages being a genuine pre-estimate of the loss which the innocent party will incur by reason of the breach. One exception to this general rule is the provision for the payment of a deposit (customarily 10% of the contract price) on the sale of land..."

In the course of their exhaustive review of earlier authorities in ''Makdessi'', the Supreme Court sorted through a large variety of ''[[obiter dictum|obiter dicta]]'' relating to penalties, many of which they considered doubtful, misinterpretations of earlier decisions, or simply capable of being misconstrued.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, ''Makdessi'' at paragraph 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Change in approach==

[[File:Royal_courts_of_justice.jpg|thumb|upright=1.591|The law relating to contractual penalties has been almost entirely developed by judges in England.]]
In more recent cases the courts have taken a considerably more relaxed approach in relation to penalties.  In ''Philips Hong Kong Ltd v AG of Hong Kong''&lt;ref&gt;''Philips Hong Kong Ltd v AG of Hong Kong'' (1993) 61 Build LR 49, 58&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] expressly endorsed the comments of [[Brian Dickson|Dickson J]] in the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in ''Elsey v J.G. Collins Insurance Agencies Ltd''&lt;ref&gt;''Elsey v J.G. Collins Insurance Agencies Ltd'' [http://canliiconnects.org/en/summaries/32389 (1978) 83 DLR (3d) 1], 15.&lt;/ref&gt; that:

{{cquote|... the power to strike down a penalty clause is a blatant interference with [[freedom of contract]] and is designed for the sole purpose of providing relief against oppression for the party having to pay the stipulated sum.  It has no place where there is no oppression.}}

However, the approbation by the Privy Council did not move the editors of ''[[Chitty on Contracts]]'' in relation to the point of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Chitty on Contracts]]|publisher=[[Sweet &amp; Maxwell]] |year=2012 |edition=31st |volume=1 |at=26–172 |quote=However, the correct question is not whether one party secured the clause by the use of unequal bargaining power or oppression, but whether or no the clause is a genuine pre-estimate of loss.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequent to the publication of that edition of ''Chitty'' the Court of Appeal expressly replicated that statement.&lt;ref name=Makdessi/&gt;{{rp|para 44}} But even the editors of ''Chitty'' have acknowledged that their own preferred test of the requirement of genuine pre-estimate of loss has become very flexible.&lt;ref&gt;''Chitty'', at 26–174, citing ''Murray v Leisureplay plc'' [2005] EWCA Civ 963 at [43]: "The parties are allowed a generous margin."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 [[Rupert Jackson|Jackson LJ]] in ''Alfred McAlpine Projects v Tilebox''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Alfred McAlpine Projects v Tilebox|court=EWHC |division= |year=2005 |num=281 |date= }}, at paragraph 48.&lt;/ref&gt; noted that he had only seen four reported cases where a clause has been struck down as a penalty.  In the same year [[Mary Arden (judge)|Arden LJ]], giving the judgment of the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] in ''Murray v Leisureplay plc''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Murray v Leisureplay plc |court=EWCA |division=Civ |year=2005 |num=963 |date= }}
&lt;/ref&gt; set out a series of five questions which the court should consider in relation to penalties:&lt;ref&gt;[2005] EWCA Civ 963, at [64].&lt;/ref&gt;
{{ordered list|type=lower-roman
|To what breaches of contract does the contractual damages provision apply?
|What amount is payable on breach under that clause in the parties' agreement?
|What amount would be payable if a claim for damages for breach of contract was brought under common law?
|What were the parties' reasons for agreeing for the relevant clause?
|Has the party who seeks to establish that the clause is a penalty shown that the amount payable under the clause was imposed ''in terrorem'', or that it does not constitute a genuine pre-estimate of loss for the purposes of the ''Dunlop'' case, and, if he has shown the latter, is there some other reason which justifies the discrepancy between i) and ii) above?
}}

In ''Azimut-Benetti SpA v Healey''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Azimut-Benetti SpA v Healey|court=EWHC |division= |year=2010 |num=2234 |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the court has to consider a provision whereby a boat builder was entitled to terminate for non-payment of instalments and to claim 20% of the contracted price as liquidated damages.  Upholding the clause, [[Christopher Clarke (judge)|Clarke J]] said that commercially justifiable clauses should be enforceable provided the dominant purpose is not to deter the other party from breach.  On the facts, it was clear that the purpose of the clause was to set out a pre-determined commercial solution in the event that the buyer defaulted.

==The current position - ''Cavendish Square Holdings BV v Makdessi''==
{{Main article|Cavendish Square Holding BV v Talal El Makdessi}}

In November 2015 the Supreme Court held joint appeals in the matter of ''Cavendish Square Holding BV v Talal El Makdessi'' and ''ParkingEye Ltd v Beavis'',&lt;ref name=Makdessi /&gt; and took the opportunity to restate the law in a lengthy judgment.  The leading judgment was a joint judgment of [[David Neuberger, Baron Neuberger of Abbotsbury|Lord Neuberger]] and [[Jonathan Sumption|Lord Sumption]], but the court was unanimous save that [[Roger Toulson, Lord Toulson|Lord Toulson]] dissented in part on the ''ParkingEye'' decision.  Their Lordships recounted the relevant legal history, noting that the law originated in cases relating to "[[penal bond]]s", and noting the parallel developments between the rule against penalties (in the common law courts) and relief from forfeiture (in the equitable courts).  After noting the rule had "not weathered well", their Lordships recorded that in relation to consumer contracts the matter was now effectively regulated by the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations.  However the rule on penalties still had a purpose to serve in relation to non-consumer contracts and it should not, therefore, be abolished.  But equally the court felt that it should not be extended.&lt;ref name=Lexology&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=1581e5fd-7fc6-4d75-a655-4737b436369e |title=Enforcement of contractual provisions: the Supreme Court reviews the law on unenforceable penalty clauses |publisher=Lexology |author=Linsey Macdonald and Eleanor Samuels |date=4 November 2015 |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court then reformulated the common law test for what constitutes an unenforceable penalty clause. They held that the validity of such a clause turned on whether the party seeking to enforce the clause could claim a legitimate interest in the enforcement of the clause:&lt;ref name=Lexology /&gt;

{{Cquote|The true test is whether the impugned provision is a secondary obligation which imposes a detriment on the contract-breaker out of all proportion to any legitimate interest of the innocent party in the enforcement of the primary obligation. The innocent party can have no proper interest in simply punishing the defaulter. His interest is in performance or in some appropriate alternative to performance.&lt;br&gt;...&lt;br&gt;The penalty rule is an interference with freedom of contract.  It undermines the certainty which parties are entitled to expect of the law.  [[Kenneth Diplock, Baron Diplock|Diplock LJ]] was neither the first nor the last to observe that “The court should not be astute to descry a ‘penalty clause’”: ''Robophone'' at p 1447. As [[Harry Woolf, Baron Woolf|Lord Woolf]] said, speaking for the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] in ''Philips Hong Kong Ltd v Attorney General of Hong Kong'' (1993) 61 BLR 41, 59, “the court has to be careful not to set too stringent a standard and bear in mind that what the parties have agreed should normally be upheld”, not least because “[a]ny other approach will lead to undesirable uncertainty especially in commercial contracts”.&lt;ref name=Makdessi/&gt;{{rp|paras 32-33}}

Accordingly, the reformulated test has essentially two elements:&lt;ref name=Lexology /&gt;
# is any legitimate business-interest protected by the clause; and
# if so, is the provision made in the clause extravagant, exorbitant or unconscionable?

The Supreme Court also affirmed that the rule against penalties will only apply to secondary obligations, i.e. obligations which arise upon breach of a primary obligation.&lt;ref name=Lexology /&gt;  A clause which stipulates onerous provisions in a contract may be onerous, but unless it is triggered by breach it is not a penalty in the eyes of the law.  Their Lordships also observed that a penalty clause may often be simple payment of money, but it could also encompass other things, such as the withholding of payments, requirements to transfer assets, or (on the facts before them) a requirement to repay a non-refundable deposit.

==Requirement for breach==

A clause which provides for a large payment in pursuant of the performance of obligations is not a penalty at law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.clydeco.com/insight/updates/view/english-contract-law-penalty-clauses-when-do-they-apply|title=English contract law: penalty clauses, when do they apply?|publisher=Clyde &amp; Co|author=Justine Reeves and Patrick Murphy|date=18 February 2014|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Berg v Blackburn Rovers FC''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Berg v Blackburn Rovers FC|court=EWHC |division= |year=2013 |num=1070 |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; it was held that where a football club exercised its right to terminate employment of a manager upon payment out of the remaining salary due under the contract, this was the performance of a term and not a provision designed to constrain breach.  Accordingly, it could not be a penalty.  For English law this position was reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in the ''Makdessi'' decision.&lt;ref name=Lexology /&gt;

The Supreme Court's ruling in respect of the ambit of the penalty rule represents the clear contrast between Australian and UK contract law. In 2012, the High Court of Australia concluded that a provision can be a penalty even if it is not triggered by a breach of contract.&lt;ref name="Andrews"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|30|2012|litigants=Andrews v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited |parallelcite= }}.  {{cite web|url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/judgment-summaries/2012/hca30-2012-09-06.pdf |title=judgment summary |publisher=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]] (Australia) |date=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court held that in general terms,' a stipulation prima facie imposes a penalty on a party (“the first party”) if, as a matter of substance, it is collateral (or accessory) to aprimary stipulation in favour of a second party and this collateral stipulation, upon the failure of the primary stipulation, imposes upon the first party an additional detriment, the penalty, to the benefit of the second party'.&lt;ref name="Andrews"/&gt;{{rp|para 10}} In 2014, the Federal Court of Australia clarified and constrained the limits of the "Andrew's Test", noting that the loss must be "extravagant or unconscionable" compared with the greatest calculation of the proved loss in order to trigger the doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCA|35|2014|litigants=Paciocco v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited |parallelcite= |courtname=auto |date=5 February 2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect==

Cases referring to penalty clauses use the words "[[void (law)|void]]" and "unenforceable" interchangeably.  In the [[High Court of Australia]] in the decision of ''AMEV-UDC Finance Ltd v Austin'',&lt;ref name="Amev-Udc"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|63|1986|litigants=Amev-Udc Finance Ltd v Austin |parallelcite=(1986) 162 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 170 at 192-193 |courtname=auto |date= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthony Mason (judge)|Mason]] and [[Ronald Wilson|Wilson]] [[Justices|JJ]] stated: "At least since the advent of the Judicature system a penalty provision has been regarded as unenforceable &lt;u&gt;or, perhaps void, ab initio&lt;/u&gt;". (emphasis added)

Because an allegation that a clause constitutes a penalty is usually raised as a defence to a contractual claim, there is no practical difference.  However, if a party were to pay out under such a clause and then seek the return of the money paid, then clearly it would be material to establish whether the clause was merely unenforceable (in which case the money could not be claimed back) or void (in which case it could).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=[[Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington LBC]] |year=1996 |court=UKHL |num=12 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Makdessi'' the Supreme Court stuck scrupulously to the word "unenforceable"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harneys.com/files/penalty-clauses----the-new-rules.pdf |title=Penalty Clauses - The New Rules |publisher=Harneys |accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The word "unenforceable" appears 28 times in the judgment.  The word "void" appears only three time - twice in quotes from other judgments, and once in relation to the summary of Mr Makdessi's claim.&lt;/ref&gt; but they also noted that Mr Makdessi had claimed that the clause was "void and unenforceable",&lt;ref&gt;''Makdessi'', at paragraph 64.&lt;/ref&gt; but did not expressly comment upon whether it might be void (and did not need to do so, as they held it was not a penalty).

==Encyclicals==
The following is a list of Papal encyclicals written by Pope Benedict XVI. A Papal [[encyclical]] is a letter usually treating some aspect of Catholic doctrine sent by the Pope and addressed to Catholic bishops.

* ''[[Deus caritas est]]'' (''God is Love'') (2006) [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/encyclicals/documents/hf_ben-xvi_enc_20051225_deus-caritas-est_en.html Text]

==Exhortations==
The following is a list of apostolic exhortations written by Pope Benedict XVI. An [[apostolic exhortation]] is a type of communication from the Pope of the Roman Catholic Church that encourages a community of people to undertake a particular activity, but does not define Church doctrine. It is considered lower in formal authority than a papal encyclical, but higher than other ecclesiastical letters.

'''''Promethea''''' is a [[comic book]] [[ongoing series|series]] created by [[Alan Moore]], [[J. H. Williams III]] and Mick Gray, published by [[America's Best Comics]]/[[WildStorm Productions|WildStorm]].

It tells the story of Sophie Bangs, a [[college]] student from an alternate futuristic New York City in 1999, who embodies the powerful entity known as Promethea whose task it is to bring the [[Apocalypse]].

Originally published as 32 issues from 1999 to 2005, the series has  been re-published into five graphic novels and one hard-back issue. Moore weaves in elements of magic and [[mysticism]] along with [[superhero]] mythology and action, [[spirituality]] and the [[afterlife]] (in particular the [[Tree of Life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]]) and [[science-fiction]]. Promethea includes wide-ranging experimentation with visual styles and art.

==Plot summary==
In the 5th century AD, a Christian mob threatens the home of a magician in Hellenistic Egypt. He tells his daughter Promethea to flee into the desert, hoping the gods of the ancient world will preserve her.
The story shifts to New York City in the late 20th century. Sophie Bangs is hoping to interview a woman named Barbara Shelley for a college paper on "Promethea", a character who seems to recur in literature and pop culture through the centuries. Shelley is hostile to her and warns, "You don't wanna go looking for folklore. And you especially don't want folklore to come looking for you."
After departing, Sophie is tracked and attacked by a creature known as a Smee. Just as things look bleakest for Sophie, she is rescued by Barbara, who has mystical powers and is now dressed as Promethea. She informs Sophie that the only reason she would be attacked is if someone suspects she will become the next vessel for Promethea (Barbara is the current). It turns out that Promethea is called to the world when someone uses their imagination to make her real. As they hide from the pursuing Smee, the weakened and fatally injured Barbara instructs Sophie to write a poem about Promethea hoping Sophie is indeed the successor and the creative expression is a way to get Sophie in the correct state of mind to allow herself to become Promethea. Barbara's idea works and from that night Sophie, having defeated the Smee, becomes the next Promethea.

The story continues with Sophie/Promethea learning about Promethea and the previous individuals who have in the past been the vessels for Promethea. In the days that follow, the hospital where Barbara lies is attacked by demons, an act that leads to Barbara's death. This motivates Sophie to learn more about magic, mysticism and the Tree of Life and its spheres in order to find Barbara and help her seek Steve Shelly, Barbara's dead husband. Throughout their climb up the spheres of Tree of Life Sophie/Promethea and Barbara encounter difficulties such as imprisonment by the demon [[Asmodeus]], as well as meeting figures such as Sophie's father Juan (who died when she was little), Barbara's guardian angel Boo Boo and Promethea's father, who she has not seen since his murder in 411 A.D. Eventually Barbara and Steve find each other and are re-incarnated as twins (who Sophie ends up looking after at the end of the book). Having been gone a whole summer, Sophie is unaware the FBI has been tracking Promethea, and  want to take her into custody for the events Promethea has caused throughout the years. Moments before the FBI arrives, Sophie's mother instructs her to run away (just as Promethea's father had centuries earlier).

Three years pass and Sophie, having abandoned her duties as Promethea, hides in Millennium City under the alias Joey Estrada with new boyfriend Carl. However, after being found by the FBI and [[Tom Strong]], Sophie reluctantly becomes Promethea and in turn carries out one final task; bringing about the end of the world.

==References, Criticisms, and Developments==
{{Original research|section|date=January 2010}}
The series has been both criticized for acting as a mouthpiece for Moore's philosophical views and praised for the beauty of its artwork and innovation regarding the medium itself. Regarding the first claim, the series is, by Moore's own admission, didactic: "there are 1000 comic books on the shelves that don't contain a philosophy lecture and one that does. Isn't there room for that one?"&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Eddie: "Alan Moore Interviewed by Eddie Campbell" Egomaina #2, December 2002: pp1-32.&lt;/ref&gt; While the Kabbalah story arc, and the positive explanations of Moore's philosophy, very explicitly explain, [[Pundit (expert)|talking-head]] style, the symbolism behind the details of every plane of existence, Promethea also contains critiques of materialism which are much more subtle. The material world is, generally, portrayed as having become immersed in [[commercialism]], [[materialism]], [[fetishism]] of science, and trendy [[postmodern]]ist-chic. Moore uses a recurring series of [[billboard (advertising)|billboards]], fictional celebrity references, and other [[advertisement]]s and/or news similar to his seminal 1980s [[miniseries]], ''[[Watchmen]]''. 

As suggested by the title ''Promethea'', which implies the feminine version of the mythological [[Prometheus]], the title also participates in the subgenre of [[feminism]] in [[superhero]] comics. In making his lead character an aspiring poet whose words conjure the malleable form of a literary goddess—as well as the non-linear narratives and references to [[literary theory]] and alternative philosophies—Moore's thematics are closely aligned with the countercultural theory and politics of [[Écriture féminine]].&lt;ref&gt;i.e. Brand, Scott: "Alan Moore's Promethea - Comics als Medium der Götter?" In: Dominas, Konrad/ Trocha, Bogdan/ Walowski, Pawel (ed.): ''Die Antike in der populären Kultur und Literatur''. Berlin: Frank &amp; Timme, 2016. P. 149 - 165. (Warning: this source is written in German).&lt;/ref&gt;

Subjects dealt with in this series include the occult, the [[tarot]] and [[Hermetic Qabalah]]. The comic is laden with mythological mystical symbolism, drawing in many religious and cultural references. Real people who appear in Promethea include [[Aleister Crowley]], [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]], [[Austin Osman Spare]], and [[John Kendrick Bangs]] (who in the comic is distantly related to Sophie Bangs). 

In January 2018, [[DC Comics]], the owner of the America's Best Comics / Wildstorm imprint, introduced Promethea into its mainstream continuity by way of the comic [[Justice League of America]] #24. The controversial storyline&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldcomicbookreview.com/index.php/2018/02/22/exhuming-promethea-authority-dark-knights-wild-hunt-1-v-justice-league-24-comparative-review/|title="Exhuming Promethea and The Authority – Dark Knights: The Wild Hunt #1 v Justice League # 24 (comparative review)"|last=Stewart|first=D.G.|date=February 22, 2018|website=World Comic Book Review|access-date=January 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; involved Promethea assisting various [[Superhero|superheroes]] in fighting a villain called the [[Queen of Fables]].  Artist [[J. H. Williams III|J.H. Williams III]] is reported as having no prior knowledge of the introduction of the character into DC Comics' broader continuity, and is quoted as saying, "I can’t in good conscience condone this happening in any form at all.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsarama.com/38253-j-h-williams-iii-responds-to-promethea-joining-justice-league-of-america.html|title="J.H.

==Main characters==
===Promethea===

Promethea was a young girl whose father was killed by a [[Christian]] mob in [[Alexandria]] in 411 AD. After escaping the mob, alone in the desert she is taken in hand by the god [[Thoth]]-[[Hermes]], who tells her that if she goes with him/them into the Immateria, a plane of existence home to the imagination, she will no longer be just a little girl but a story living eternally. "Promethea" thereafter manifests through a series of individuals or vessels who have channeled her energy through the power of imagination.

Since the incident with the little girl in Alexandria, there have been eight known Promethea vessels. Six are characters in the story, the other two are told as two individuals, one Christian and one Muslim, who lived during the [[Crusades]] and fought each other. As there  should only ever be one active Promethea at any one moment in history, the fight caused Promethea great pain, something that was repeated when Stacia/Grace fought Sophie/Promethea. It could be argued that there is a ninth Promethea vessel; Stacia Vanderveer. However, Stacia was only a vessel for Grace Brannagh, a dead woman who once herself was Promethea and not the original little girl.

===Sophie Bangs/Joey Estrada===

The protagonist of the series, Sophie becomes Promethea after tracing the character's history in literature for a college paper.  Her personality as Sophie is initially somewhat timid; however, by the end of the book she becomes an adept magician and confident young woman. She is the most powerful Promethea to date, and the only one not to have been killed during her time as Promethea. She changes her name to Joey after running away to Millennium City to escape the FBI and her duties as Promethea.

===Barbara Shelley/Boo-Boo Ramirez===

The wife of comic book writer Steven Shelley, Barbara became Promethea when her husband began projecting Barbara's characteristics onto the Promethea character in his comics.  During her passage in the afterlife, Barbara meets her guardian angel Boo-Boo (Barbara's old nickname) who is in fact the younger, beautiful and independent young woman she used to be. By the time she finds her husband, she and Boo-Boo become one person.

===Stacia Vanderveer===

Sophie's best friend, Stacia is an extremely cynical and sarcastic college student.  During an attack at the hospital she was visiting Sophie in, Sophie uses Stacia as a vessel for Grace Brannagh to help the fight.  While Sophie journeyed to find Barbara in the afterlife,  Stacia/Grace were re-instated to temporarily serve as acting Promethea, leading Stacia and Grace to fall in love.  After Sophie's return, Stacia and Grace refused to relinquish the Promethea title, but were forced to by a court hearing in the Immateria. After the Apocalypse, Stacia and former FBI Agent Ball become lovers, while Stacia still has sexual liaisons with Grace in the Immateria.

===Grace Brannagh===

An illustrator who created a series of covers for pulp magazine fantasy stories about Promethea, which were written by several writers under the [[pseudonym]] "Marto Neptura". Brannagh was the most proficient fighter of all the Prometheas. She held the Promethea mantle from 1920–1939. In a text article in Promethea #1, Brannagh's style is compared to that of [[Weird Tales]] illustrator [[Margaret Brundage]].

===Jack Faust===

Jack Faust is a magician who first approaches Sophie in order to confuse her during her first days as Promethea. Jack is first seen as a handsome young man; however, this is a [[shapeshifting|glamour]]. He is actually older, balding and overweight. Jack promises to teach Sophie magic if she (in her Promethea form) agrees to have sex with him. At first Sophie declines, but later agrees, knowing this knowledge will help her travel in the afterlife and help Barbara.

==Recurring characters==
===William 'Bill' Woolcott===

The only man to assume the role of Promethea, Bill Woolcott was a [[gay]] comic artist who became Promethea by drawing her.  He was the longest-lasting Promethea, from 1939–1969, and acted as a "science-hero" in the ABC universe with Tom Strong during that period. Bill/Promethea most resembles a 1960s version of Wonder Woman. Bill was shot in the head by Promethea's lover, FBI Agent Dennis Drucker, who reacted violently when he discovered that his lover was (in a manner of speaking) transgender. Drucker spent several decades in an insane asylum tortured by guilt for having killed Promethea, while Bill/Promethea spent similar time in the Immateria blaming herself for not having told him the truth. The two are reunited during the Apocalypse.

===Anna===

The poet Charlton Sennet, in the 1770s, projected Promethea's likeness onto his housemaid Anna, transforming her into his dream lover.  This Promethea bore him a child, but the baby evaporated on birth, since in a sense it was only "half-real," an amalgamation of the physical nature of Charlton Sennet and the metaphysical nature of Promethea. Anna died in childbirth, leaving Charlton alone (his wife deserted him after finding him in bed with Anna/Promethea).

===Margaret Taylor Case===

The writer of a [[William Randolph Hearst]]-syndicated comic strip titled ''Little Margie in Misty Magic Land'', Case wrote Promethea into her comic book as a helpful spirit to the titular young adventurer, and ended up personifying Promethea to help soldiers on the battlefield from 1900–1920, in a manner similar to the legendary [[Angels of Mons]]. Little Margie also dwells in the Immateria alongside Case and the other past Prometheas, where she is regarded as little more than a pest who interrupts "serious" conversation with her childlike observations, styled after the remarks of the character Nemo in the early 20th-century newspaper strip ''[[Little Nemo in Slumberland]]''. Margaret committed suicide during her tenure as Promethea.

===Five Swell Guys===
{{Main|Five Swell Guys}}
The Five Swell Guys are a team of "science-heroes", and the only such team in New York City. There is similarity between them and The Fantastic Four, with their floating platform and their specialized members. The team meet Sophie Bangs in the first issue, and then meet Promethea in the third issue, after one is badly hurt.

===Weeping Gorilla Comix===
[[Image:Promethea Weeping Gorilla.JPG|thumb|The Weeping Gorilla from ''Promethea'' #1]]
The "Weeping Gorilla Comix" is a series of one-panel comics featuring a weeping gorilla, with a thought bubble pronouncing some thoughtful phrase, usually cynical and self-pitying in nature: "Why do good things happen to bad people?", "Who [[remaindered book|remaindered]] the book of Love?", "She gets the kids and the house. I get the car.", etc.  The whole concept is an industry joke about the supposed tendency for comics to get increased sales from a picture of a [[gorillas in comic books|gorilla]], a weeping character, or the color purple on the cover.&lt;ref&gt;as described by [[Mark Waid]] in an editorial in ''[[Secret Origins]]'' Volume 2, number 40&lt;/ref&gt;  Occasionally Moore shows snippets of the gorilla's [[foil (literature)|foil]], the Chucklin' Duck, who is happy-go-lucky and naively optimistic, with smug saying such as "Heh heh! I got out of internet trading just in time!".  Both the Weeping Gorilla and Chucklin' Duck [[Motif (narrative)|motif]]s were used in the ''[[Greyshirt (comics)|Greyshirt: Indigo Sunset]]'' series by [[Rick Veitch]], and a Weeping Gorilla Comix panel makes a [[cameo appearance]] in the story "King Solomon Pines" in ''[[Tom Strong's Terrific Tales]]'' #5 (scripted by [[Leah Moore]] and illustrated by [[Sergio Aragones]]). The ''[[Tesla Strong]]'' miniseries included, amongst various versions of Solomon, one who resembled the Weeping Gorilla.

'''Reasonable and non-discriminatory''' ('''RAND''') terms, also known as '''fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory''' ('''FRAND''') terms, denote a voluntary licensing commitment that [[standards organization]]s often request from the owner of an intellectual property right (usually a patent) that is, or may become, essential to practice a [[technical standard]].&lt;ref name="Layne-Farrar et al"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Layne-Farrar |first1=Anne |last2=Padilla |first2=A. Jorge |last3=Schmalensee |first3=Richard |year=2007 |title=Pricing Patents for Licensing in Standard-Setting Organizations: Making Sense of FRAND Commitments |journal=Antitrust Law Journal |volume=74 |issue= |pages=671 |publisher= |doi= |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/antil74&amp;div=23&amp;id=&amp;page= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Put differently, a F/RAND commitment is a voluntary agreement between the standard-setting organization and the holder of standard-essential patents. U.S. courts, as well as courts in other jurisdictions, have found that, in appropriate circumstances, the implementer of a standard—that is, a firm or entity that uses a standard to render a service or manufacture a product—is an intended [[third-party beneficiary]] of the FRAND agreement, and, as such, is entitled to certain rights conferred by that agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Microsoft Corp. v. Motorola, Inc., 696 F.3d 872, 884 (9th Cir. 2012); ''In re'' Innovatio IP Ventures, LLC Patent Litig., MDL No. 2303, 2013 WL 5593609, at *4 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 3, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

A standard-setting organization is an industry group that sets common standards for its particular industry to ensure compatibility and interoperability of devices manufactured by different companies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.etsi.org/standards&lt;/ref&gt;  A patent becomes standard-essential when a standard-setting organization sets a standard that adopts the technology that the patent covers.  

Because a patent, under most countries' legal regimes, grants its inventor an exclusive right to exclude others from making, using, selling, or importing the invention, a standard-setting organization generally must obtain permission from the patent holder to include a patented technology in its standard. So, it will often request that a patent holder clarify its willingness to offer to license its standard-essential patents on FRAND terms.  If the patent holder refuses upon request to license a patent that has become essential to a standard, then the standard-setting organization must exclude that technology. When viewed in this light, the FRAND commitment serves to harmonize the private interests of patent holders and the public interests of standard-setting organizations. Many scholars have written about these topics, as well as a variety of other legal and economic issues concerning licensing on F/RAND terms.&lt;ref&gt;J. Gregory Sidak, ''A FRAND Contract's Intended Third-Party Beneficiary'', 69 FLA. L. REV. (forthcoming 2017), https://www.criterioneconomics.com/a-frand-contracts-intended-third-party-beneficiary.html; Thomas F. Cotter, ''Comparative Law and Economics of Standard-Essential Patents and FRAND Royalties'', 22 TEX. INTELL. PROP. L.J. 311 (2013); Mark A. Lemley &amp; Carl Shapiro, ''A Simple Approach to Setting Reasonable Royalties for Standard-Essential Patents'', 28 BERKELEY TECH. L.J. 1135 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

== F/RAND as a contract ==

Standard-setting organizations commonly adopt policies that govern the ownership of [[patent rights]] that apply to the standards they adopt (the patent policy). In the United States, the patent holder's agreement to adhere by the patent policy creates a legally binding contract, as the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled in [[Microsoft v. Motorola]]. One of the most common policies is to require a patent holder that voluntarily agrees to include its patented technology in the standard to license that technology on "reasonable and non-discriminatory terms" (RAND) or on "fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms" (FRAND). The two terms are generally interchangeable; FRAND seems to be preferred in Europe and RAND in the U.S.&lt;ref name="Layne-Farrar et al"/&gt;

Some commentators argue that standard-setting organizations include the FRAND obligation in their bylaws primarily as a means of enhancing the pro-competitive character of their industry. They are intended to prevent members from engaging in licensing abuse based on the [[monopolistic]] advantage generated as a result of having their [[intellectual property]] rights (IPR) included in the industry standards. Once an organization is offering a FRAND license they are required to offer that license to anyone (wishing to access the standard), not necessarily only members of the organization.&lt;ref name="Layne-Farrar et al"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Formulas for fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory royalty determination"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/8569/ |title=Formulas for fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory royalty determination |author=Salant, David J |year=2007 |work= |publisher=Munich Personal RePEc Archive |accessdate=11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without such commitment, members could use [[monopoly]] power inherent in a standard to impose unfair, unreasonable and discriminatory licensing terms that would damage competition and inflate their own relative position.

On the other hand, commentators stress that the FRAND commitment also serves to ensure that the holder of a patent that becomes essential to the standard will receive royalties from users of the standard that adequately compensate the patent holder for the incremental value that its technology contributes to the standard.&lt;ref&gt;J. Gregory Sidak, ''Apportionment, FRAND Royalties, and Comparable Licenses After Ericsson v. D-Link, 2016 U. ILL. L. REV. (forthcoming), https://www.criterioneconomics.com/apportionment-frand-royalties-comparable-licenses-ericsson-dlink.html.&lt;/ref&gt; The development of a patented technology typically requires significant investment in research, and contributing that technology to a standard is not the only option by which a patent holder can recoup that investment and thus monetize its invention. For example, a patent holder has the option to monetize that invention through exclusive use or exclusive licensing. Technology owners might have insufficient incentives to contribute their technologies to a standard-setting organization without the promise of an adequate royalty. The promise of a F/RAND royalty address that problem: the patent holder will typically agree to contribute its technology to the standard, thus forgoing the exclusive use or the exclusive licensing of its technology, in exchange for the assurance that it will receive adequate compensation in reasonable royalties.&lt;ref&gt;Memorandum from J. Gregory Sidak, Chairman, Criterion Economics LLC to the Ministry of Commerce &amp; Industry, Department of Industrial Policy &amp; Promotion of India (Mar. 30, 2016), https://www.criterioneconomics.com/standard-essential-patents-indian-ministry-commerce-industry.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, court decisions and scholarly articles cited FRAND commitments 10 times more often than in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;http://leconcurrentialiste.com/2014/01/27/frand-statistical-comparison-between-cases-and-research-papers/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
While there are no legal precedents to spell out specifically what the actual terms mean, it can be interpreted from the testimony of people like Professor [[Mark Lemley]] from [[Stanford University]], in front of the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary]] that the individual terms are defined as follows:

'''Fair''' relates mainly to the underlying licensing terms. Drawing from anti-trust/[[competition law]]; fair terms means terms which are not anti-competitive and that would not be considered unlawful if imposed by a dominant firm in their relative market. Examples of  terms that would breach this commitment are: requiring licensees to buy licenses for products that they do not want in order to get a license for the products they do want or requiring licensees to take licenses to certain unwanted or unneeded patents to obtain licenses to other desired patents (bundling);  requiring licensees to license their own IP to the licensor for free (free grant backs); and including restrictive conditions on licensees’ dealings with competitors (mandatory exclusivity).

'''Reasonable''' refers mainly to the licensing rates. According to some, a reasonable licensing rate is a rate charged on licenses which would not result in an unreasonable [[aggregate rate]] if all licensees were charged a similar rate. According to this view,  aggregate rates that would significantly increase the cost to the industry and make the industry uncompetitive are unreasonable. Similarly, a reasonable licensing rate must reward the licensor with adequate compensation for contributing its [[essential patent]]s to a standard. Compensation is adequate if it provides the licensor with the incentive to continue investing and contributing to the [[open standard|standard]] in future time periods.&lt;ref&gt;J. Gregory Sidak, ''The Meaning of FRAND, Part I: Royalties'', 9 J. COMPETITION L. &amp; ECON. 931, 989–90 (2013), ''available at'' http://www.criterioneconomics.com/meaning-of-frand-royalties-for-standard-essential-patents.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is worth noting that a licensor which has several different licensing packages might be tempted to have both reasonable and unreasonable packages.  However having a reasonable "bundled" rate does not excuse having unreasonable licensing rates for smaller unbundled packages.  All licensing rates must be reasonable.

'''Non-discriminatory''' relates to both the terms and the rates included in licensing agreements. As the name suggests this commitment requires that licensors treat each individual licensee in a similar manner. This does not mean that the rates and payment terms can’t change dependent on the volume and creditworthiness of the licensee. However it does mean that the underlying licensing condition included in a licensing agreement must be the same regardless of the licensee. This obligation is included in order to maintain a level playing field with respect to existing competitors and to ensure that potential new entrants are free to enter the market on the same basis.

The most controversial issue in RAND licensing is whether the "reasonable" license price should include the value contributed by the standard-setting organization's decision to adopt the standard.  A technology is often more valuable after it has been widely adopted than when it is one alternative among many; there is a good argument that a license price that captures that additional value is not "reasonable" because it does not reflect the intrinsic value of the technology being licensed. On the other hand, the adoption of the standard may signal that the adopted technology is valuable, and the patent holder should be rewarded accordingly. That is particularly relevant when the value of the patent is not clearly known before the adoption of the standard.&lt;ref&gt;Mariniello, Mario (2011) Fair, Reasonable and Non Discriminatory (FRAND) Terms: A Challenge for Competition Authorities - Journal of Competition Law and Economics, Oxford University Press, Vol. 7, n. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Some interpretations of "non-discriminatory" can include time-oriented licensing terms such as an "early bird" license offered by a licensor where terms of a RAND license are better for initial licensees or for licensees who sign a license within the first year of its availability.

==Excluding costless distribution schemes==

RAND terms exclude intangible goods which the producer may decide to distribute at no cost and where third parties may make further copies.  Take for example a software package that is distributed at no cost and to which the developer wants to add support for a video format which requires a patent licence.  If there is a licence which requires a tiny per-copy fee, the software project will not be able to avail of the licence.  The licence may be called "(F)RAND", but the modalities discriminate against a whole category of intangible goods such as [[free software]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/frand-is-a-fraud  "FRAND" is a FRAUD ] Free Software Foundation, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and [[freeware]].&lt;ref name="swpat_FRAND"&gt;{{cite web|title=FRAND|url=http://en.swpat.org/wiki/FRAND|website=End Software Patents|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This form of discrimination can be similarly caused by common licence terms such as only applying to complete implementations of the licensed standard, limiting use to particular fields, or restricting redistribution. The [[Free Software Foundation]] suggests the term "uniform fee only" (UFO) to reflect that such "(F)RAND" licences are inherently discriminatory.&lt;ref name="ufo"&gt;[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#RAND Words to Avoid] gnu.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related licenses==
Related to RAND licenses are RAND-Z (RAND with zero royalty) or RAND-RF (RAND Royalty Free) licensing, in which a company promises to license the technology at no charge, but implementers still have to get the licenser's permission to implement. The licenser may not make money off the deal but can still stop some type of products or require some type of reciprocity or do more subtle things like drag out the licensing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goland.org/buyingopenstandards/ |title=A Buyer's Guide to Standards |date=2002-09-20 |accessdate=2011-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://standardslaw.com/?p=36 |title=Patent Licensing Assurances in Standards Organizations |date=2007-08-06 |accessdate=2011-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://standards.gov/standards_gov/sos_rfi_docs/5_ABA.pdf |format=PDF |title=Standardization Feedback for the National Science and Technology Council |accessdate=2011-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negotiating process==
{{Further|Orange-Book-Standard|Huawei v ZTE}}
The negotiating process for FRAND licenses places requirements on the patent owner and the envisioned patentee. The terms for these negotiations were set in German [[case law]] in a case regarding the [[Orange-Book-Standard]], and these terms are often used in licensing negotiations. In 2015 the [[European Court of Justice]] interpreted FRAND licensing terms in case Huawei v ZTE (C170/13, {{ECLI|ECLI:EU:C:2015:477}} significantly diverging from the Orange-Book-Standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The European Court of Justice on enforcement of FRAND patents: Huawei v. ZTE|accessdate=4 August 2015|work=[[Lexology]]|url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=c936f159-96c3-4390-bd71-75cdaad57fcb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the standard work for [[numismatism|numismatic]] identification of coinage struck by authorisation of Roman emperors.

== Production ==
The production of a chronological catalogue of Roman Imperial coinage was started in 1923 by [[Harold Mattingly]], a [[numismatism|numismatist]] at the [[British Museum]], assisted by [[Edward Allen Sydenham]]. Their catalogue differed from its predecessor, produced by [[Henry Cohen (numismatist)|Henry Cohen]] in the 19th Century. Although Cohen had classified the coins by emperor, and then alphabetically by the legend (text) on them. Mattingly broke down the classification further into which foundry, and in which series, each coin came from. Mattingly and Sydenham were joined by [[C. H. V. Sutherland]] in producing volumes IVb (1938) and IVc (1949), and by [[Percy H. Webb]] for volumes Va (1927) and Vb (1933). After 1930, the editorship of each of the final volumes was given to a specialist of the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zehnacker|1986|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Mattingly's death in 1964, Sutherland and [[R. A. G. Carson]] jointly took over editorship of the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zehnacker|1986|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1984, Sutherland published an expanded edition of the first volume of 1923, which was not as detailed as those that followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zehnacker|1986|p=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saint Christopher''' ({{lang-el|Ἅγιος Χριστόφορος}}, ''Ágios Christóforos'') is [[veneration|venerated]] by several [[Christian]] denominations as a [[martyr]] killed in the reign of the 3rd-century [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[List of Roman emperors|Emperor]] [[Decius]] (reigned 249–251) or alternatively under the Roman Emperor [[Maximinus II (Daia)|Maximinus II Dacian]] (reigned 308–313). There appears to be confusion due to the similarity in names "Decius" and "Dacian".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=T.D. Barnes, The New Empire of Diocletian and Constantine (Cambridge, MA, 1982)|pages=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However his veneration only appears late in Christian tradition, and did not become widespread in the Western Church until the [[Late Middle Ages]], although churches and monasteries were named after him by the 7th century.

It is disputed whether Christopher existed, and if so whether the name applied to a specific person or was a general title meaning "Christ-bearer" which was applied to several different real or legendary people. He may be the same figure as [[Saint Menas]]. His most famous legend, which is mainly known from the West and may draw from [[Ancient Greek mythology]], tells that he carried a child, who was unknown to him, across a river before the child revealed himself as Christ. Therefore, he is the [[patron saint]] of travelers, and small images of him are often worn around the neck, on a bracelet, carried in a pocket, or placed in vehicles by Christians.

== Legend ==
There are no legends associated with the life and death of Saint Christopher which first appeared in Greece and had spread to France by the 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03728a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: St. Christopher|website=www.newadvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 11th-century bishop and poet [[Walter of Speyer]] gave one version, but the most popular variations originated from the 13th-century ''[[Golden Legend]]''.&lt;ref name="mershman"/&gt;

According to the legendary account of his life Christopher was initially called '''Reprobus'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catholicharboroffaithandmorals.com/St.%20Christopher.html|title=Weniger, Francis X., "St. Christopher, Martyr", (1876)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a [[Canaan]]ite, 5 cubits ({{convert|7.5|ft}}) tall and with a fearsome face. While serving the king of Canaan, he took it into his head to go and serve "the greatest king there was". He went to the king who was reputed to be the greatest, but one day he saw the king cross himself at the mention of the devil. On thus learning that the king feared the [[devil]], he departed to look for the devil. He came across a band of marauders, one of whom declared himself to be the devil, so Christopher decided to serve him. But when he saw his new master avoid a wayside cross and found out that the devil feared Christ, he left him and enquired from people where to find Christ. He met a [[hermit]] who instructed him in the Christian faith. Christopher asked him how he could serve Christ. When the hermit suggested fasting and prayer, Christopher replied that he was unable to perform that service. The hermit then suggested that because of his size and strength Christopher could serve Christ by assisting people to cross a dangerous river, where they were perishing in the attempt. The hermit promised that this service would be pleasing to Christ.

After Christopher had performed this service for some time, a little child asked him to take him across the river. During the crossing, the river became swollen and the child seemed as heavy as lead, so much that Christopher could scarcely carry him and found himself in great difficulty. When he finally reached the other side, he said to the child: "You have put me in the greatest danger. I do not think the whole world could have been as heavy on my shoulders as you were." The child replied: "You had on your shoulders not only the whole world but Him who made it. I am Christ your king, whom you are serving by this work." The child then vanished.&lt;ref name=Crawley&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/CHRISTOP.HTM "St. Christopher", ''Lives of Saints'', John J. Crawley &amp; Co., Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Christopher later visited [[Lycia]] and there comforted the Christians who were being martyred. Brought before the local king, he refused to sacrifice to the pagan gods. The king tried to win him by riches and by sending two beautiful women to tempt him. Christopher converted the women to Christianity, as he had already converted thousands in the city. The king ordered him to be killed. Various attempts failed, but finally Christopher was beheaded.&lt;ref name=Crawley/&gt;

== Historical identification ==
[[File:Saint Christopher 001.jpg|thumb|The earliest known [[woodcut]], 1423, [[Buxheim]], with hand-colouring]]
Historical examination of the legends suggests Reprobus (Christopher) lived during the Christian persecutions of the Roman emperor [[Decius]] (249 to 251), and that he was captured and martyred by the governor of [[Antioch]].&lt;ref name="Woods"&gt;David Woods, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1583965 "St. Christopher, Bishop Peter of Attalia, and the Cohors Marmaritarum: A Fresh  Examination"], ''Vigiliae Christianae'', Vol. 48, No. 2 (Jun., 1994), p.170&lt;/ref&gt; Historian David Woods has proposed that St. Christopher's remains were possibly taken to [[Alexandria]] by [[Pope Peter I of Alexandria|Peter of Attalia]] where he may have become identified with the Egyptian martyr [[Saint Menas]].&lt;ref name="Woods"/&gt;

The legend of Saint Christopher records two important historical facts that identify him with the historical [[Saint Menas]]. The first is that the Greek and Latin legends of Saint Christopher identify him as belonging to the [[List of Roman auxiliary regiments|Third Valerian Cohort of the Marmantae]] (Latin: ''Cohors tertia [[Diocletian|Valeria]] Marmantarum''), a military unit of Northern Africa of [[Marmarica]] (between modern day [[Libya]] and [[Egypt]]), recruited by none other than the Emperor [[Diocletian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=D.H. Farmer, The Oxford Dictionary of Saints (3rd ed.: Oxford, 1992), 97-98; or the note by V. Saxer in A. di Berardino (ed.), Encyclopedia of the Early Church I (New York, 1992), 165}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second is that Saint Christopher was martyred in Antioch.

The martyrdom of Saint Menas corresponds to the details of the legend of Saint Christopher. The theory that identifies the two saints as one and the same concludes that the name "Christopher" meaning "Christ-bearer" was a title given to the name of the valiant Menas who died in Antioch. Since he was not a native of that land, his name was not known and so he was simply revered by his generic title: "Christophoros" or "Christ-Bearer."&lt;ref name="origin"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Origin of the Cult of St. Christopher|url=http://www.ucc.ie/milmart/chrsorig.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saint Menas happens to be the patron of travelers in the Coptic tradition,&lt;ref name="origin"/&gt; which further supports an association with Saint Christopher who is the patron of travelers in the Greek and Latin traditions.

==Veneration and patronage==
[[File:Westminster Psalter St Christopher.jpg|thumb|''St. Christopher'', from the [[Westminster Psalter]], c. 1250]]
===Eastern Orthodox liturgy===
The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] venerates Christopher of Lycea with a [[Feast Day]] on May 9. The liturgical reading and hymns refer to his imprisonment by [[Decius (emperor)|Decius]] who tempts Christopher with [[harlots]] before ordering his beheading.&lt;ref name=GOAA&gt;{{cite web | url=http://goarch.org/chapel/saints_view?contentid=47 | title=Christopher the Martyr of Lycea | work=Saints | publisher=Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America | date=2013 | accessdate=April 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[kontakion|Kontakion in the Fourth Tone]] (hymn) reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Thou who wast terrifying both in strength and in countenance, for thy Creator's sake thou didst surrender thyself willingly to them that sought thee; for thou didst persuade both them and the women that sought to arouse in thee the fire of lust, and they followed thee in the path of martyrdom. And in torments thou didst prove to be courageous. Wherefore, we have gained thee as our great protector, O great Christopher.&lt;ref name=GOAA/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Roman Catholic liturgy===
The [[Roman Martyrology]] remembers him on 25 July.&lt;ref&gt;''Martyrologium Romanum'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2001 {{ISBN|88-209-7210-7}})&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tridentine Calendar]] commemorated him on the same day only in private [[Mass (liturgy)|Masses]]. By [[General Roman Calendar of 1954|1954]] his commemoration had been extended to all Masses, but it was dropped in [[General Roman Calendar|1970]] as part of the general reorganization of the calendar of the [[Roman rite]] as mandated by the [[motu proprio]], ''[[Mysterii Paschalis]]''.  His commemoration was described to be not of Roman tradition, in view of the relatively late date (about 1550) and limited manner in which it was accepted into the Roman calendar,&lt;ref&gt;''Calendarium Romanum'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; but his feast continues to be observed locally.&lt;ref name="butler"&gt;{{cite book |last=Butler |first=Alban |title=Butler's lives of the saints, Volume 7|year=2000|publisher=Liturgical Press |isbn=978-0-8146-2383-1 |pages=198–99 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=umn3JEADSTQC&amp;pg=PA198 |authorlink=Alban Butler|editor=Peter Doyle, Paul Burns |accessdate=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relics===
St. Christopher has a sister. The Museum of Sacred Art at Saint Justine's Church (Sveti Justina) in [[Rab]], [[Croatia]] claims a gold-plated [[reliquary]] holds the skull of St. Christopher. According to church tradition, a bishop showed the relics from the city wall in 1075 in order to end a siege of the city by an [[Italo-Norman]]  army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rab-visit.com/en/did-you-know/the-legend-of-st-christopher/3125|title=The legend of St. Christopher|website=rab-visit.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rab.hr/grad-rab/o-gradu-rabu/povijest/P2 Portal Grada Raba: Povijest 14.

===Medals===
[[File:Saint Christopher Medal.png|thumb|right|A bronze St. Christopher medallion]][[Medal]]lions with St. Christopher's name and image are commonly worn as [[pendant]]s, especially by travelers, to show devotion and as a request for his blessing. Miniature statues are frequently displayed in [[automobile]]s. In French a widespread phrase for such medals is "Regarde St Christophe et va-t-en rassuré" ("Look at St Christopher and go on reassured", sometimes translated as "Behold St Christopher and go your way in safety"); Saint Christopher medals and [[holy card]]s in Spanish have the phrase "Si en San Cristóbal confías, de accidente no morirás" ("If you trust St. Christopher, you won't die in an accident").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Year in the Life of Medieval England|first=Toni|last=Mount|publisher=[[Amberley Publishing]]|year=2016|isbn=9781445652405|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WcZ5DAAAQBAJ|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===General patronage===
St. Christopher is a widely popular saint, especially revered by athletes, [[mariner]]s, [[ferry]]men, and travelers.&lt;ref name="mershman"&gt;Mershman, F. (1908).

===Patronage of places===
Christopher is the patron saint of many places, including: [[Baden|Baden, Germany]];&lt;ref name="mershman"/&gt; [[Barga|Barga, Italy]]; [[Braunschweig|Brunswick, Germany]];&lt;ref name="mershman"/&gt; [[Mecklenburg|Mecklenburg, Germany]];&lt;ref name="mershman"/&gt; [[Rab|Rab, Croatia]]; [[Roermond, The Netherlands]]; Saint Christopher's Island ([[Saint Kitts]]); [[Girona|Toses in Catalonia, Spain]]; [[Mondim de Basto|Mondim de Basto, Portugal]]; [[Agrinion|Agrinion, Greece]]; [[Vilnius|Vilnius, Lithuania]]; [[Riga|Riga, Latvia]]; [[Havana|Havana, Cuba]]; [[Paete|Paete, Laguna, Philippines]] and Tivim, Goa, India

===Depictions in art===
[[Image:Christopher icon.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|alt1= |left|In Eastern icons, Saint Christopher is sometimes represented with the [[Cynocephaly|head of a dog]]]]
Because St. Christopher offered protection to travelers and against sudden death, many churches placed images or statues of him, usually opposite the south door, so he could be easily seen.&lt;ref name="butler"/&gt; He is usually depicted as a giant of a man, with a child on his shoulder and a staff in one hand.&lt;ref name="magill"&gt;{{cite book|last=Magill|first=Frank Northen|title=Dictionary of World Biography: The ancient world|year=1998|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-89356-313-4|pages=239–44|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wyKaVFZqbdUC&amp;pg=PA242|author2=J. Moose |author3=Alison Aves |accessdate=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In England, there are more wall paintings of St. Christopher than of any other saint;&lt;ref name="butler"/&gt; in 1904, Mrs. Collier, writing for the [[British Archaeological Association]], reported 183 paintings, statues, and other representations of the saint, outnumbering all others except for the Virgin Mary.&lt;ref name="collier"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Collier |first=Mrs. |title=Saint Christopher and Some Representations of Him in English Churches|journal=[[British Archaeological Association|Journal of the British Archaeological Association]]|year=1904|pages=130–45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UDgNAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA130|accessdate=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[icon|iconography]] (and sometimes in the Western), Saint Christopher is sometimes represented with the [[Cynocephaly|head of a dog]]. The background to the dog-headed Christopher is laid in the reign of the Emperor [[Diocletian]], when a man named ''Reprebus'', ''Rebrebus'' or ''Reprobus'' was captured in combat against tribes dwelling to the west of [[Egypt]] in [[Cyrenaica]]. To the unit of soldiers, according to the [[Hagiography|hagiographic narrative]], was assigned the name ''numerus Marmaritarum'' or "Unit of the Marmaritae", which suggests an otherwise-unidentified "Marmaritae" (perhaps the same as the Marmaricae [[Berber people|Berber]] tribe of [[Cyrenaica]]). He was reported to be of enormous size, with the head of a dog instead of a man, apparently a characteristic of the Marmaritae. This Byzantine depiction of St. Christopher as dog-headed resulted from their misinterpretation of the Latin term ''Cananeus'' (Canaanite) to read ''canineus'' (canine).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=L. |last= Ross |title=Medieval Art: A Topical Dictionary |location=Westport |year=1996 |page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the medieval Irish Passion of St. Christopher, "This Christopher was one of the Dog-heads, a race that had the heads of dogs and ate human flesh." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucc.ie/milmart/chrsirish.html |title=Irish Passion of St. Christopher |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729215126/http://www.ucc.ie/milmart/chrsirish.html |archivedate=2013-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was commonly accepted at the time that there were several types of races, the Cynocephalus, or dog headed people, being one of many believed to populate the world.

The German bishop and poet [[Walter of Speyer]] portrayed St. Christopher as a giant of a cynocephalic species in the land of the Chananeans who ate human flesh and barked. Eventually, Christopher met the Christ child, regretted his former behavior, and received baptism. He, too, was rewarded with a human appearance, whereupon he devoted his life to Christian service and became an [[athlete of God]], one of the [[soldier-saint]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter of Speyer]], ''Vita et passio sancti Christopher martyris'', 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1847">A '''single-field dictionary''' is a [[specialized dictionary]] that has been designed and compiled to cover the terms of one particular subject field. Single-field dictionaries should be contrasted with [[multi-field dictionary|multi-field dictionaries]] and [[sub-field dictionary|sub-field dictionaries]].

The typology consisting of these three dictionaries is important for a number of reasons. First of all a single-field dictionary is an example of a very specialized dictionary in that it covers only one single subject field. Examples of single-field dictionaries are a dictionary of law, a dictionary of economics and a dictionary of welding.

The main advantage of single-field dictionaries is that they can easily be [[maximizing dictionary|maximizing dictionaries]], i.e. attempt to cover as many terms of the subject field as possible without being a dictionary in several volumes. Consequently, single-fields dictionaries are ideal for extensive coverage of the linguistic and extra-linguistic aspects within a particular subject field.

Secondly, if the lexicographers intend to make a bilingual, maximizing single-field dictionary they will not run into the same problems with the space available for presenting the large amount of data that has to be included in the dictionary, cf. a [[multi-field dictionary]].

Consequently, the best coverage of linguistic and extra-linguistic aspects within the subject field covered by a dictionary will be found in a single-field dictionary. However, even more extensive coverage is possible in a [[sub-field dictionary]].

The book includes documentation proving more than 400,000 cases of deliberate killings at an average of 1,576 per day.&lt;ref name="archive"/&gt; It is also considered a follow-up to ''[[The Polish White Book]]'' of 1941.

==Contents==
''The Black Book'' is a collection of authenticated documents, depositions, eye-witness accounts, and Ministerial summaries, describing and illustrating with photographs, the [[Nazi crimes against the Polish nation]] and [[War crimes in occupied Poland during World War II]] committed in mere two years: including massacres, tortures, expulsions, forced colonization, persecution, destruction of culture, and humiliation of a nation.&lt;ref name="archive"/&gt; 

The book is a sequel to ''The German Invasion of Poland'' compiled by the Polish government-in-exile and published in 1940,&lt;ref name="archive"/&gt; sometimes considered as the first volume of this publication series. The original volume deals with the war crimes of the September 1939 invasion of Poland. ''The Black Book'' by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]] of New York (or the 'second volume' of ''The Black Book of Poland'') was published in London by [[Hutchinson (publisher)|Hutchinson]] under a different title: '''''The German New Order in Poland''''', with only 585 pages and 61&amp;nbsp;plates.&lt;ref name="NLoA"&gt;{{cite book |author=National Library of Australia |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/version/26862125 |title=The German new order in Poland |at=Illustrated edition: xiv, 585 pp. London, 1942 (1943).

==History==
The institute was founded in 1965 by the well-known writer, thinker and [[Sufism|Sufi]] teacher [[Idries Shah]]&lt;ref name="wintle"&gt;Justin Wintle (ed), ''Makers of Modern Culture'', Volume I, p474, Routledge, 2001, {{ISBN|0-415-26583-5}}.

In his book ''Listening to Idries Shah'', author, [[Psychotherapy|psychotherapist]] and tutor, [[Ivan Tyrrell]] recounts a conversation in which Shah explained his reasons for founding the ICR: "I want to attract ordinary people and help them think about psychological and cultural issues. But, as an individual, I can't easily get people to listen seriously. I discovered, however, that if I call myself an 'institute' – they will," Shah told him.&lt;ref name="Tyrrell"&gt;{{cite book

==Aims and remit==
The Institute's stated aim was "to stimulate study, debate, education and research into all aspects of human thought, behaviour and culture" and to make the results of its members' academic work accessible to society and also to academics working in different fields.&lt;ref name="charity" /&gt;&lt;ref name="icr-about" /&gt;

The body, which had a number of distinguished Fellows, published several dozen academic monographs and some books over the years&lt;ref name="charity" /&gt;&lt;ref name="icr-about" /&gt; and held regular events.&lt;ref name="charity" /&gt;&lt;ref name="guidestar-statement"&gt;[http://www.guidestar.org.uk/gs_activities.aspx?CCReg=0AWV1MgzSc0%2fkY4xcMOB1g%3d%3d&amp;strQuery= ICR's statement of public benefit at Guidestar.org.uk], made in light of the new Charities Act. Retrieved on 2008-11-14.&lt;/ref&gt; These events usually included a series of six lectures by specialists per year, and a two-day seminar which is usually held in the Autumn. The aim of these was "to connect ideas across disciplines, across cultures, and even through history" and to bring about a broader, more holistic understanding by looking at issues from several different perspectives, with particular interest in human thought and behaviour and issues neglected by contemporary culture.&lt;ref name="guidestar-statement" /&gt;&lt;ref name="icr-events"&gt;[http://www.i-c-r.org.uk/events/index.php Events held by the Institute for Cultural Research] Retrieved on 2008-11-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the Institute supported projects in areas where freedom of access to facts was threatened,&lt;ref name="charity" /&gt; for example in the case of [[Afghanistan]] where assistance had been given to the [[United Nations Children's Fund]] (UNICEF)'s female educational projects.&lt;ref name="icr-about" /&gt;

[[Image:burgesswr.jpg|right|150px|thumb|1961 Heinemann edition]]

'''''The Worm and the Ring''''' is a 1961 [[novel]] by English novelist [[Anthony Burgess]], drawing on his time as a teacher at Banbury Grammar School, [[Oxfordshire]], England, in the early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Kastan |editor-first=David Scott |year=2006 |title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of British Literature, Volume 1 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=321 |isbn=9780195169218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is Burgess's version of the [[Ring Cycle]].&lt;ref name=ziolkowski2017&gt;{{cite book |last=Ziolkowski |first=Theodore |year=2017 |title=Music Into Fiction: Composers Writing, Compositions Imitated |publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer |page=117 |isbn=9781571139733}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dragon pub in the novel corresponds to the worm and a purloined diary to the ring.

==Characters==
([[Der Ring des Nibelungen#List of characters|Wagnerian equivalents]] in brackets)
*'''Woolton''', the school principal ([[Odin|Wotan]])
*'''Frederica''', Woolton's wife ([[Frigg|Fricka]])
*'''Lodge''' ([[Loki|Loge]])
*'''Albert Rich''', a student at the school ([[Alberich]])
*'''three female students''' (the [[Rhinemaidens]])
*'''Linda''' (Woglinde, one of the Rhinemaidens)

==Libel action and revised edition==
The novel was withdrawn from circulation following a libel action by Gwendoline Bustin, the secretary of Banbury Grammar School, where Burgess had taught in the early 1950s. Several characters were recognisable as figures from the school, but only Miss Bustin, later Lady Mayoress of Banbury, objected. Heinemann agreed to "amend all unsold copies of the book" (''The Times'', 25 October 1962) but actually pulped them.

A revised edition of the novel, with the libellous elements removed, was published in 1970.&lt;ref name=ziolkowski2017/&gt;

'''V&amp;A Dundee''' is a design museum in [[Dundee]], Scotland, which opened on 15 September 2018.&lt;ref name="moore"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Moore |first1=Rowan |title=V&amp;A Dundee review – a flawed treasure house on the Tay |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/sep/15/victoria-and-albert-museum-dundee-v-and-a-flawed-treasure-house-on-the-tay |accessdate=16 September 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=15 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="morkis"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Morkis |first1=Stefan |title=World record smashed as V&amp;A Dundee and 3D Festival draw the crowds on museum’s opening weekend |url=https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/local/dundee/725742/world-record-smashed-as-va-dundee-and-3d-festival-draw-the-crowds-on-museums-opening-weekend/ |accessdate=16 September 2018 |work=The Courier |date=15 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The V&amp;A Dundee is the first design museum in Scotland and the first Victoria and Albert museum outside London. The V&amp;A Dundee is also the first building in the United Kingdom that has been designed by [[Kengo Kuma]].

== History ==
The plan for a V&amp;A museum in Dundee originated at the [[University of Dundee]] in 2007 when Professor Georgina Follett (then Dean of [[Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design]]) suggested to bring the V&amp;A to Dundee to [[University of Dundee]] Principal Sir [[Alan Langlands]]. Subsequently, Joan Concannon, the university's director of external relations, made a 20-minute pitch to [[Mark Jones (museum director)|Sir Mark Jones]], then director of the Victoria and Albert Museum, in which the case for Dundee was made including its potential as an anchor for the urban regeneration of the waterfront. A design competition took place in 2010 to decide what the museum would look like. The Japanese architect Kengo Kuma won the competition, his design was inspired by the eastern cliff edges of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dundee.ac.uk/stories/va-dundee/|title=V&amp;A Dundee and the University : Stories|last=Dundee|first=University of|website=University of Dundee|language=en|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Construction ===
[[Royal BAM Group|BAM Construction]] carried out the construction work beginning in April 2014. The original completion date was 2017 but was delayed to 2018. During construction a cofferdam was installed to allow the outer wing expand on to the [[River Tay]] and 780 tonnes worth of pre-cast, grey, concrete slabs were added to the outside of the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bam.co.uk/how-we-do-it/case-study/v-a-museum-of-design-dundee|title=V&amp;A Dundee - BAM Case Study|website=www.bam.co.uk|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opening ===
The V&amp;A Dundee opened to the public on 15 September 2018 with international and national press previews taken place beforehand from 13–14 September 2018. The opening was celebrated with a 3D Festival which featured acts such as [[Primal Scream]], Be Charlotte and [[Lewis Capaldi]] and had featured a light show and a firework display. The opening highlights were broadcast on [[BBC Two Scotland]] in a programme hosted by [[Edith Bowman]]. The museum set itself the target of attracting 500,000 visitors within a year of its opening; it attracted 27,201 visitors during its first week, 100,000 in its first three weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-45614688|title=V&amp;A Dundee welcomes 27,000 in first week|date=2018-09-23|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/v-a-dundee-attracts-100-000-visitors-in-the-space-of-three-weeks-1-4811617|title=V&amp;A Dundee attracts 100,000 visitors in the space of three weeks|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scottish Design Galleries ===
The Scottish Design Galleries feature permanent design works from across Scotland.

=== The Oak Room===
[[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]]'s Oak Room was originally completed in 1908 after being commissioned by [[Catherine Cranston]] for use as a [[tearoom]] on Ingram Street in [[Glasgow]]. The 13.5 meter long double-height room now forms a part of the permanent Scottish Design Gallery at the museum. The Oak Room was restored from over 700 original parts that were stored by [[Glasgow City Council]] for over 50 years. The room took 16 months to install and the total cost of the restoration and conservation was £1.3 million (2018).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vam.ac.uk/dundee/media/15894| title=The Oak Room | publisher=V&amp;A Dundee | access-date=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Projects and groups ==

=== School Design Challenge ===
Before the museum opened, the V&amp;A Dundee launched a 'school design challenge' in 2015 where 11-12 year olds from [[Freshman#Scotland|S1 classes]] had to use design to change their everyday environment. It included schools from across Dundee, Tayside, Angus and Fife.

=== Young People's Collective ===
The V&amp;A Young People's Collective are a group of 16 to 24 year olds that contribute to the young voice of the museum. The group meet every Thursday and take over the V&amp;A Dundee's Twitter account. The Young People's Collective co-designed the 3D Festival alongside [[DF Concerts]] which was part of the museum's opening.

=== Design Champions ===
There are 50 design champions of the V&amp;A Dundee. The design champions are ambassadors to the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/projects/va-dundee-design-champions|title=V&amp;A Dundee Design Champions • V&amp;A Dundee|last=|first=|date=|website=V&amp;A Dundee|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{div col|colwidth=15em}}

'''Yosef Yitzchak Kazen''' (1954 – 1 December 1998),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/36222/jewish/Our-Founding-Director.htm | title=Father of the Jewish Internet Passes Away | publisher=Lubavitch News Service | date=December 3, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt; also known as '''Y.Y. Kazen''', was an [[United States|American]] [[Chabad-Lubavitch]] Hasidic [[rabbi]]. He is known for creating and running [[Chabad.org]] in 1988, before the [[World Wide Web]] existed.

==Early life==
Kazen was born in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] to Rabbi Zalman and Shula Kazen. After arriving in [[Brooklyn, New York]] from the [[Soviet Union]], the Kazens moved to Cleveland after being encouraged to do so by the [[Lubavitcher Rebbe]]. As a child, Kazen went to the Cleveland Kaliver Yeshivah and the Hebrew Academy and studied after school with his father. He also studied in New York and [[Brazil]]. He attended high school at the Telshe ("Telz") Talmudic Academy in Cleveland and later attended the Central Lubavitch Yeshivah.

==Chabad.org==
In 1988, Kazen started working on Chabad.org on his home computer after discovering [[message boards]] on [[Fidonet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pioneering Net rabbi dies of cancer at 44|url=http://www.jweekly.com/1998/12/11/pioneering-net-rabbi-dies-of-cancer-at-44/|accessdate=21 July 2017|publisher=JTA|date=11 December 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received the [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson|Lubavitcher Rebbe's]] approval,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mannes|first1=George|title=Surfin' For Souls On The Internet|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/money/surfin-souls-internet-article-1.734381|accessdate=21 July 2017|publisher=New York Daily News|date=22 December 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; and worked from his basement answering emails and later running the website. He was later given an office at Lubavitch Headquarters. He was inspired to create a website to aid in Chabad's outreach.

Kazen answered emails as part of "Ask the Rabbi" since 1988, making it the longest running online "Ask the Rabbi" service. In 1993, Chabad.org was launched on the World Wide Web. Kazen's outreach included organizing a [[Passover]] service on a boat near Antartica, sending [[kosher]] recipes to Jews worldwide, making thousands of Jewish documents and texts available online and using the site to answer e-mails and frequently asked questions as part of "Ask the Rabbi".&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harmon|first1=Amy|title=Yosef Kazen, Hasidic Rabbi And Web Pioneer, Dies at 44|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/13/nyregion/yosef-kazen-hasidic-rabbi-and-web-pioneer-dies-at-44.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=20 July 2017|date=13 December 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kazen was featured in the [[24 Hours in Cyberspace]] photographic exhibition at the Smithsonian's [[National Museum of American History]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Miller|first1=Leslie|title=Museum Space for 'Cyberspace' |publisher=USA Today|date=2 January 1997 |url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/782747/jewish/Museum-Space-for-Cyberspace.htm |deadurl=no |accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even after being diagnosed with [[lymphoma]] 1998, Kazen continued to answer e-mails and update Chabad.org using a laptop in the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pioneer of the Jewish Internet Had a Passion for People|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/783328/jewish/Pioneer-of-the-Jewish-Internet.htm|website=www.chabad.org|accessdate=20 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kazen died on 1 December and was buried in the Lubavitch section of the [[Montefiore Cemetery|Old Montefiore Cemetery]] in [[Queens, New York]] near the Lubavitcher Rebbe and the [[Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn|Frierdiker Rebbe]].

As of 2013, 488,431 people worldwide are subscribed to Chabad.org's emails, the site has 25 "Ask the Rabbi" responders, 744,370 questions answered in the past decade, content from 1,890 authors, hundreds of kosher recipes and thousands of video and audio files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=One Jewish Website, 37 Million Visitors - Chabad.org's Impact|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/2439248/jewish/One-Jewish-Website-37-Million-Visitors.htm|website=www.chabad.org|accessdate=20 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Kazen married Rochel. Together, they had six children: Raizy, Michoel, Shmuel, Choni, Peretz and Sarah.
