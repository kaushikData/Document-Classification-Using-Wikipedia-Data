'''Alfred Schutz''' ({{IPAc-en|ʃ|ʊ|t|s}}; born '''Alfred Schütz''', {{IPA-de|ʃʏts|lang}}; 13 April 1899 – 20 May 1959) was an Austrian philosopher and social phenomenologist whose work bridged [[sociological]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] traditions. Schutz is gradually being recognized as one of the twentieth century's leading philosophers of social science.&lt;ref&gt;George Walsh, "Introduction", Alfred Schütz, ''The Phenomenology of the Social World'' (Illinois 1997) p. xv&lt;/ref&gt; He related [[Edmund Husserl]]'s work to the social sciences, and influenced Max Weber's legacy of philosophical foundations for sociology and economics through Schutz's major work, ''Phenomenology of the Social World''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barber|first=Michael|title=Alfred Schutz|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/schutz/|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

=== Early life and background ===
Schutz was born in Vienna, Austria, into an upper-middle-class Jewish family as an only child. Following his graduation from high school he was drafted into the Austrian army, where he quickly rose to the American equivalent rank of second lieutenant. His army regiment was dispatched to fight in a series of heavy battles on the Italian front (WWI).

=== Education and later life ===
Schutz enrolled at the [[University of Vienna]] from where he received his law degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Participating Citizen: A Biography of Alfred Schutz|last=Barber|first=Michael|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time at the University of Vienna he also enrolled at the [http://www.wiiw.ac.at/ Viennese Academy of International Trade] from 1919 to 1920 and adopted a concentration in International Law. During his time at the University of Vienna, Schutz went to lectures given by Max Weber, and felt that Weber had left the problem of meaning unanswered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Explorations in Classical Sociological Theory|last=Allan|first=Kenneth|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=314|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by Wagner (1983), Schutz's fascination with the problem of meaning was a result of his experience in combat, combined with returning to starving and economically decimated Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Alfred Schutz: An Intellectual Biography|date=1983|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=6|last1=Wagner|first1=Helmut R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926 Schutz married Ilse Heim, after developing a well-established and prominent career in international banking. He became the chief financial officer for Reitler and Company, the Vienna banking firm. In 1933 the threat of Hitler's rise in Germany caused Schutz and other Viennese intellectuals to flee Austria in order to seek asylum in allied countries. Consequently, Schutz and his family relocated to Paris in 1938 in political exile. Schutz worked as an international lawyer for Reitler and Company, and moved to the United States in 1939, where he became a faculty member of The New School. He taught sociology and philosophy as well as serving as chair of the Philosophy department. Schutz is unique as a scholar of the social sciences in that he pursued a career in law for most of his life, while teaching part-time at the New School for Social Research in New York. Moreover, he produced key papers in phenomenological sociology that fill four volumes (published by Nijhoff, The Hague), while working full-time at the bank. Schutz received a substantial amount of assistance from his wife Ilse, who transcribed his working notes and letters from his taped dictations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allan|first=Kenneth|title=Explorations in classical sociological theory : seeing the social world|year=2005|publisher=Pine Forge Press|location=Thousand Oaks|isbn=9781412905725|page=314}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schutz died in New York City at the age of 60.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allan|first=Kenneth|title=Explorations in Classical Sociological Theory|year=2010|publisher=Pine Forge Press|pages=314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intellectual life==

While Schutz primarily focused on phenomenology and social science methodology his principal aim was to create a philosophical foundation for the [[social sciences]]. Schutz was strongly influenced by [[Ludwig von Mises]], [[Henri Bergson]], [[William James]], and [[Edmund Husserl]]. Contrary to common belief, while Schutz's work paralleled [[George Herbert Mead]]’s analysis of the meanings within social interactions, Schutz was highly critical of Mead’s behavioristic approach.&lt;ref name="GroupedRef1"&gt;Walsh, p. xviii&lt;/ref&gt; Although Schutz was never a student of Husserl he and colleague [[Felix Kaufmann]] intensively studied Husserl's work in order to seek a basis for the interpretive sociology derived from Max Weber. In 1932 Schutz’s efforts resulted in his first published book, ''Der sinnhafte Aufbau der sozialen Welt'' (literally, "the meaningful construction of the social world") which was published in English as ''The Phenomenology of the Social World''. Schutz took up the generic emphasis of phenomenology, arguing that everyday life – other than philosophical or scientific theories – is most important for analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allan|first=Kenneth|title=Explorations in Classical Sociological Theory|year=2005|publisher=Pine Forge Press|location=Thousand Oaks, CA 91320|isbn=9781412905725|page=317}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication brought him to the attention of Husserl, whom he visited often after the publication and corresponded with until Husserl's death (1938). Even so, when Husserl asked Schutz to be his assistant, he was unable to accept the offer&lt;ref name="GroupedRef1" /&gt; at [[Albert-Ludwigs-Universität|Freiburg University]] for personal reasons.

Schutz's main concerns were with how people grasp the consciousness of others while they live within their own stream of consciousness. He talked much about intersubjectivity, but in a larger sense. He used it to mean a concern with the social world, specifically the social nature of knowledge. A great deal of his work deals with the "life world". Within this, people create social reality under the constraints of preexisting social and cultural factors and structures. He was very focused on the "dialectical relationship between the way people construct social reality and the obdurate social and cultural reality that they inherit from those who preceded them in the social world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ritzer|first=George|title=Sociological Theory|year=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|pages=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Schutz's writings had a lasting impact on sociology, both on [[Phenomenological Sociology|phenomenological approaches to sociology]] (especially through the work of [[Thomas Luckmann]] and [[Peter L. Berger]]) and in [[ethnomethodology]] through the writings of [[Harold Garfinkel]]. Luckmann was heavily influenced by Schutz's work.  Luckmann, a student of Schutz's (along with Peter L. Berger), ultimately finished Schutz's work on the structures of the [[Lifeworld]] after Schutz died by filling out his unfinished notes. Berger and Luckmann went on to use Schutz's work to further understand human culture and reality, through the development of a new form of the sociology of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kenneth|first=Allan|title=Explorations in Classical Sociological Theory|year=2010|publisher=Pine Forge Press|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by Farganis (2011), Peter Berger is arguably the best-known living sociologist influenced by Schutz, owing his creation of social construction theory which explains how the processes of externalization, objectification, and internalization contribute to the social construction of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farganis|first1=James|title=Readings in Social Theory:  The Classical Tradition to Post-Modernism|date=2011|publisher=Mc-Graw Hill|location=New York|page=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phenomenology===
Phenomenology originated with Edmund Husserl.  Schutz met Husserl and studied his work. Phenomenology is the study of things as they appear (phenomena). It is also often said to be descriptive rather than explanatory: a central task of phenomenology is to provide a clear, undistorted description of the ways things appear".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Joel|title=Phenomenology|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/phenom/|publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many assumptions behind phenomenology that help explain its creation. First, it rejects the concept of objective research. Phenomenologists would rather group presumptions through a process called ''phenomenological epoche''. Second, phenomenology believes that analyzing the daily human behavior will provide one with a comprehensive understanding of nature. The third assumption is that persons, not individuals, should be explored and questioned. Sociologically speaking, this is in part because persons can be better understood by the unique ways they reflect and symbolize the society he or she lives in. Fourth, phenomenologists prefer to gather “capta,” or ''conscious experience'', rather than traditional data. Finally, phenomenology is considered to be oriented on discovery, and therefore phenomenologists gather research using methods that are far less restricting than in other sciences.&lt;ref name="In S. Littlejohn, &amp; K. Foss (Eds.), Encyclopedia of Communication Theory"&gt;{{cite book|last=Orbe|first=Mark P.|title=Phenomenology|year=2009|publisher=Thousand Oaks|location=CA|page=(pp. 750–752)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social phenomenology===

Social phenomenology is the combination of the social construction of reality and [[ethnomethodology]]. It was concerned with how people use ordinary, everyday interactions to produce a feeling of reality and intersubjectivity. Most of Schutz's work concerned the methods used for the construction of reality through everyday experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=50 Key Sociologists: The Formative Theorists|last=Scott|first=John|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted by Farganis (2011) phenomenological sociology is characterized as particularly subjective in nature because its emphasis of understanding reality through the perspective of the acting subject rather than through the lens of the scientific observer.&lt;ref name="McGraw-Hill"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farganis|first1=James|title=Readings In Social Theory: The Classic Tradition to Post-Modernism|date=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York City|isbn=978-0-07-811155-6|pages=257|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than attempting to uncover and document the social structures which influence our social world Schutz and other sociological phenomenologists seek not only to identify the content of our consciousness related to our conception of the social reality of everyday life but also, how this reality comes to assume the form it is.&lt;ref name="McGraw-Hill" /&gt; In essence, Schutz and social phenomenologists are principally concerned with the happenings of everyday life or what Schutz refers to as the ‘[[Lifeworld|life world]]’. As noted by Ritzer (2011) the life world “is an intersubjective world in which people both create social reality and are constrained by the preexisting social and cultural structures created by their predecessors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ritzer|first=George|title=Sociological Theory|year=2011|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York|pages=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this world, relationships between the social and natural world are what come into doubt. There is this existence of meaning which comes into play yet most people simply accept the world how it is and never second guess the concept or problem of meaning.[14] Schutz delves even more into specific relationships such as the difference between intimate face-to-face relationships and distant and impersonal relationships.

====The four divisions of the lifeworld====
Schutz's division of Husserl's ''Lebenswelt'' (the mundane [[lifeworld]]) into four distinct sub-worlds is perhaps his most influential theoretical contribution. The theory of the lifeworld is that social experience creates a world that is separated between social reality that has been directly experienced and social reality that is on the horizon of direct experience.&lt;ref name="GroupedRef2"&gt;Walsh, p. xxvii&lt;/ref&gt; The former consisted of the ''Umwelt'' of what Schutz termed consociates or fellow-men – of the man who "shares with me a community of space and a community of time".&lt;ref&gt;Schütz, ''Phenomenology'' p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, those who Schutz did not deem his fellow-men, he put them in three classes: the world of contemporaries (Mitwelt), the world of predecessors (Vorwelt). and the world of successors (Folgewelt).&lt;ref name="GroupedRef2" /&gt; The last two represent the past and the future, whereas one's contemporaries share a community of time, if not space, and are different from the predecessors and successors because it is possible for them to become fellow-men or consociates.&lt;ref name="GroupedRef2" /&gt;

Schutz was interested in documenting the transition from direct to indirect experience and the series of experiences in between.&lt;ref&gt;Schütz, ''Phenomenology'' p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; He also wanted to map the progressive anonymisation of the contemporaries (''Mitwelt)'', which was a measurement of increasing anonymity of "my absent friend, his brother whom he has described to me, the professor whose books I have read, the postal clerk, the Canadian Parliament, abstract entities like Canada herself, the rules of English grammar, or the basic principles of jurisprudence".&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, p. xxviii&lt;/ref&gt; Schutz argued that the more one goes into the contemporary world, the more anonymous the contemporary inhabitants become, with the most anonymous being artifacts of any kind that hold meaning, context, and suggest there are unknown people.&lt;ref&gt;Schütz, ''Phenomenology'' p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

In his later writings, Schutz explored how everyday social experiences that pertain to these dimensions are most often intertwined in varying degrees of anonymity.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Schütz, ''The Problem of Social Reality'' (The Hague 1973) p. 352&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, "if in a face-to-face relationship with a friend I discuss a magazine article dealing with the attitude of the President and Congress toward China, I am in a relationship not only with the perhaps anonymous contemporary writer of the article but also with the contemporary individual or collective actors on the social scene designated by the terms, 'President', 'Congress', 'China'".&lt;ref&gt;Schütz, ''Social Reality'' p. 352&lt;/ref&gt;

Alisols have an ''argic horizon'', which has a high [[cation exchange capacity]]. In the subsoil, the [[base saturation]] is low.

There exist mixed forms, for example 'Stagnic Alisol', that are mainly Alisol, but also contain components that are found in [[Stagnosol]]s.

Alisols occur in [[tropical climate|tropical]] and [[humid subtropical climate]]s, but are also found in temperate regions.&lt;ref&gt;Chesworth, Ward (editor); ''Encyclopedia of Soil Science''; p. 36. ISBN&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to [[Lixisol]]s, [[Acrisol]]s and [[Ferralsol]]s, Alisols have much higher-activity clays and are likely to be found on younger terrains or more geologically active regions such as [[Kyushu]] and [[Chugoku]].

==Agricultural use==
Alisols are acidic (increased by limited drainage) and therefore need liming, contain few nutrients and therefore need fertilizer, and do not have much surface coherence so are easily eroded.

Aluminium and manganese toxicity is a very serious problem in Alisols, because at the low [[pH]] of these soils such generally insoluble metals become soluble and can poison plants which are not tolerant of them. [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] mentions oil palm, cotton, and maize (corn) as crops suitable to be grown on Alisols, though most crops require very intensive fertilisation for long-term success.

'''Anti-Romanian sentiment''' or '''Romanophobia'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AXUVAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22romanian-phobia%22&amp;dq=%22romanian-phobia%22&amp;hl=ro&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PGevUd-6BKaE4gSVk4GwCQ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Human Rights at the Turn of New Millenium in the Republic of Moldova|work=google.ro|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-ro|antiromânism}},&lt;ref&gt;The word ''antiromânism'' is sometimes written without diacritics, and can be a cause of some confusion, because ''antiromanism'' can also mean ''antiţiganism'' (discrimination and prejudice against the [[Romani people]]).&lt;/ref&gt; ''românofobie'') is hostility toward or prejudice against [[Romanians]] as an ethnic, linguistic, religious, or perceived racial group, and can range from individual hatred to institutionalized, violent persecution.

Anti-Romanian discrimination and sentiment has been present in various degrees among the peoples and/or governments of countries bordering on [[Romania]], either toward Romania itself or towards Romanian ethnic minorities residing in these countries. Similar patterns have existed toward other groups both in the region and elsewhere in the world, especially where political borders do not coincide with the patterns of ethnic population.

==Kingdom of Hungary==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
[[Transylvania]] in the [[Middle Ages]] was organized according to the system of [[Estates of the realm|Estates]], which were privileged groups (''universitates'') with power and influence in socio-economic and political life, being nonetheless organized according to certain ethnic criteria as well. The first Estate was the lay and ecclesiastic aristocracy, ethnically heterogeneous, but undergoing a process of homogenization  around its [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] nucleus. The other Estates were [[Saxons]], [[Székelys|Szeklers]] and [[Romanians]] (or [[Vlachs]] - ''[[Universitas Valachorum]]''), all with an ethnic and  ethno-linguistic basis (''Universis nobilibus, Saxonibus, Syculis et Olachis''). The general assembly (''congregatio generalis'') of the four Estates had mainly supra-legislative powers in Transylvania, but it sometimes took measures regarding order in the country, relationships between the privileged, military issues, etc.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

The turning point in the history of the Romanian population in Transylvania was in 1366, when through the [[Decree of Turda]] the king [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis I Anjou of Hungary]] redefined nobility in terms of membership in the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and, thus specifically excluding the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] Romanians. The only possibility for Romanians to retain or access nobility was through [[Religious conversion|conversion]] to Roman Catholicism. Some Orthodox Romanian nobles converted, being integrated in the Hungarian nobility, but the most of them declined, thus losing their status and privileges. {{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

As a result, gradually, after 1366 Romanians lost their status as an Estate and were excluded from Transylvania's assemblies. This meant that the Romanian population of Transylvania was never directly represented in the Transylvanian [[Diet (assembly)|Diet]], which consisted of Hungarian nobles, German and Székely nobles (the [[Unio Trium Nationum]]).{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Moreover, in [[Medieval]] times, the Romanians were not allowed to reside within the walls of such Transylvanian cities as [[Sibiu]] (''Nagyszeben''/''Hermannstadt''), [[Braşov]] (''Brassó''/''Kronstadt'') or [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]] (''Kolozsvár''/''Klausenburg''). This led to extensive persecution against the under-represented Romanians. For example, in the 16th century, Transylvanian laws of justice separated the rights of Hungarians, Saxons and Szeklers from the rights of the Romanians.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

As a consequence, Romanian peasants would sometimes revolt and demand better treatment. These revolts, such as the [[Revolt of Horea, Cloşca and Crişan|1784 Romanian peasant uprising]], were ruthlessly suppressed as [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]] after learning the escalated situation ordered the army to intervene. Horea and Cloșca were caught by Romanians in their subterfuge and handled them to [[Paul Kray]] general. Horea and Cloșca were executed by [[breaking on the wheel]].&lt;ref name=HegyesMarczali&gt;Hegyes András - Marczali Henrik: Erdély története (Budapest, 2002) 141-147 o. {{ISBN|9639452297}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This method of execution consisted of the victim being laid on the ground whilst the executioner would break the prisoner’s bones with a spiked wheel.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Other peasants would be forced to watch the executions in order to frighten them from attempting future uprisings. Crișan committed suicide in the prison.&lt;ref name="HegyesMarczali"/&gt;

In 1918, after the First World War, the [[union of Transylvania with Romania]] was declared at [[Alba Iulia]] by an assembly of the delegates of ethnic Romanians in Transylvania. Following the Treaty of Trianon, eventually Transylvania became part of Romania.

==Bulgaria==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
Bulgaria and Romania are neighbors, however, both two countries have been in conflicts in the past, especially over the [[Dobruja]] region. In the 1st millennium AD, [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] owned the territory of modern-day Romania. For many Bulgarians{{which|date=August 2017}}, at that time, Romanians were considered as being just Bulgarians, who spoke Bulgarian and belonged to the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]], a fact denied by the Romanians{{which|date=August 2017}}. It remained controversial even until the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s arrival to the Balkans.

After 1878, when Romania became independent, the two countries tried to resolve the conflict until the [[Second Balkan War]], when Romania attacked [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] and took [[Tutrakan]] from the country, causing anti-Romanian sentiment to raise to higher levels. During [[World War I]], Bulgaria joined the [[Central Powers]] and occupied [[Bucharest]] and Dobruja including the now retaken Tutrakan, which is still a part of Bulgaria today. After the end of the war, however, relations cooled down. In 1940, by the [[Treaty of Craiova]] Dobruja was divided between them with Bulgaria getting the Southern part and Romania getting the Northern part. After, in [[World War 2]], the two countries were allies. After the establishment of the Eastern Bloc, both countries became [[socialist]] republics, which furthered the friendship. The two countries currently have strong ties and have a very special relationship (both joined the [[EU]] in 2007), considering their opposed linguistic and cultural backgrounds.

Although the 1940 issue was reaffirmed later in 1947 by the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Peace Treaties]], today, most Romanians and Bulgarians get along with each other, but Romania is still being held at a negatively by certain groups{{which|date=August 2017}}, which still believe the whole of Romania belongs to them or at least all the Dobruja region.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Russian Empire==

[[Bessarabia]] became a part of the [[Russian Empire]] according to the 1812 [[Treaty of Bucharest (1812)|Treaty of Bucharest]]. &lt;!---DO NOT USE ANNEXATION HERE! One cannot "annex" through the treaty. Read [[annexation]]---&gt; A period of autonomy followed, after which all Romanian government institutions, schools and presses were closed and replaced by a [[Russia]]n-style provincial administration in 1828. At the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, Bessarabia saw an intense process of [[Russification]]. Military service also became a new instrument of Russification. The process of Russification and colonization of this territory started to be carried out by representatives of other ethnic groups of the Russian Empire, including [[Jew]]s, [[Bessarabia Germans|Germans]], [[Bessarabian Bulgarians|Bulgarians]], [[Gagauz people|Gagauz]], and [[Ukrainians]].

== Soviet Union (including the 1917 Revolution) ==

When the Russian Empire collapsed after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], a local body called “[[Sfatul Ţării]]” ("Council of the Country") was created in Bessarabia. Moldova became an independent republic on December 2, 1917. Given that Soviet raids already menaced the newly formed authority, the local body ("Sfatul Ţării") called in support troops from the [[Kingdom of Romania]]. The troops entered [[Bessarabia]] on December 13. On March 27, 1918, the local body ([[Sfatul Ţării]]) voted to unite with [[Romania]]. Subsequently, the Soviet Union refused to recognize the union, and supported an intense propaganda stating that the Kingdom of Romania was an imperialistic multi-ethnic state.

Bessarabia was a part of Romania until 1940 when the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] re-annexed the territory as well as Northern [[Bukovina]].

The convention of October 28, 1920, whereby the [[British Empire]], [[France]], [[Italy]], and [[Japan]] recognized Romanian sovereignty in Bessarabia, was rejected as invalid by the USSR. Moscow even denied the validity of that part of the convention that stipulated that, upon Russian request, the Council of the League of Nations could be empowered to arbitrate the Russo-Romanian dispute over Bessarabia. In short, the Kremlin insisted that Romania was illegally occupying Bessarabia. Moscow also encouraged revolutionary activities by Bolshevik elements in Bessarabia.

The exact position of the USSR on these issues is unknown except for Moscow's unwillingness to make any concessions to [[Bucharest]] on Bessarabian issues. Recent tracts by Romanian historians have emphasized the support given by Romanian Communists to the "democratic forces" opposed to alteration of the status quo in [[Transylvania]] in 1938 and subsequent years. True as this may be, there has been no evidence presented in support of any fundamental change in Moscow's positions with respect to Bessarabia in 1938 and subsequent years.

According to official NKVD documents, over 15,000 Romanians from Northern Bukovina were deported to [[Siberia]] in 1940 alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Gabriel Gherasim, [http://noinu.rdscj.ro/article.php?articleID=149&amp;document=3 Românii din Ucraina (2), p. 3] ("Romanians in Ukraine (2)", p. 3), ''Noi, NU! Revistă de atitudine şi de cultură'', August 7, 2005. Accessed online December 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet action culminated with the [[Fântâna Albă massacre]] when 2,500 to 3,000 Romanian refugees who were attempting to leave Northern Bukovina for Romania were blocked by the [[USSR Border Troops]] and about 200 of them were shot, at a place called "Fântâna Albă" (''White Fountain'' in Romanian). This policy resulted in a substantial shrinkage of the Romanian population in the province. By 1941, out of 250,000 Romanians in Northern Bukovina, only 192,000 were left.

The territory of the [[Moldavian SSR]] was composed of Bessarabia (except for Southern Bessarabia, assigned to [[Ukraine]]) and a part of the territory of the former [[Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] ([[Transnistria]]), founded in 1924 within the territory of Ukraine. In the document confirming the establishment of the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (MASSR) of 12 October 1924 the West frontier of the republic was traced out not along the Dniester River but the [[Prut River]]. In the [[Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|MASSR]] the ideology of a separate Moldovan identity was pursued, including the introduction of [[Moldovan language]], distinct from Romanian. The Cyrillic alphabet and abundant [[Russianism|Russisms]] were introduced.

Another historical event which contributed to the future implementation of the anti-Romanian feelings was [[Romania during World War II|Romania’s behaviour in World War II]], when the Romanian regime allied itself with [[Nazi Germany]].

In Bessarabia, the Soviet government pursued a policy of [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] of the native Romanian population. First, the province was divided into a "Moldovan" Socialist Republic and a southern region known as [[Budjak]], which was renamed [[Izmail Oblast]] and attached to the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. Elite elements of the Romanian population were then deported to Siberia much like their Bukovinian counterparts. Russian and Ukrainian settlers were used to fill the vacant areas caused by the deportation of Romanians.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Nina Negru, [http://www.jurnal.md/articol.php?id=3652&amp;editie=409 Nu-i lua cu fericirile - disciplinează-i cu decalogul] ("Don't reach out to them with promises of happiness, discipline them with the Ten Commandments"), ''Jurnal de Chişinău'', Edition 409, 30 August 2005. Accessed online 20 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946-1947, as a result of the famine organised{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} in the [[Moldavian SSR|MSSR]] (according to some data of certain scientists; official data has not yet been published), around 300,000 died and many cases of cannibalism occurred{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}. In addition, the population of the former MASSR, as a part of the [[Ukrainian SSR|Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]], also suffered from the artificial famine in the 1930s when several million people died in Ukraine (''see also [[Holodomor]]'').

The territory of Transnistria was more industrialised in comparison with the other part of [[Moldova]] and the industrialisation process of Transnistria was accompanied by a population flow from other areas of the USSR, especially from Russia. Although in the [[Moldova|Republic of Moldova]] the level of population density was the highest one in the USSR, [[Moscow]] continued to stimulate the arrival of labour force from outside, including that with a poor qualification. Even [[Igor Smirnov]] himself, current leader of the separatist regime of Transnistria, was sent in 1987 from [[Russia]] to [[Tighina|Bender]] to be the director of an enterprise. This process was also amplified by the excessive militarization of the area.

The 1989 adoption of the Law on state language (official language) and Law on functioning of languages on the territory of the MSSR generated an extremely negative reaction in the industrial centres of Transnistria, where the largely [[Russian language|Russian]]-speaking population was not being consulted, and felt threatened by the prospects of [[Romanianization]]. These laws proclaimed the Moldovan (Romanian) language, written in the Latin alphabet, as the only state language. The fact that [[Moldovan language|Moldovan]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian]] are identical was recognised. Although a majority of the Transnistrian population never read these laws which served as a reason for the conflict's outburst, they feared that by the application of the new linguistic legislation, [[Russian language]] speakers would become second-class citizens. At the industrial enterprises, including those of the military-industrial complex of the USSR, strikes occurred protesting against granting official language status to the Moldavian (Romanian) language.

==Post-Soviet Moldova==

After the breakup of the USSR, various legislative reforms consolidated the position of ethnic Romanians/Moldovans, especially by establishing the [[Moldovan language]] as the official language. The 2001 parliamentary elections, won by the [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]], initially brought a series of attempts to raise Russian to the status of a state language. However, the project was dropped by popular opposition.

Relations between the Moldovan and Romanian governments have initially included some tension as the Moldovan government led by President [[Vladimir Voronin]] accused Romania of ''[[imperialism]]''. Nevertheless, in the recent past relations have improved and President Voronin as well as Romanian President [[Traian Băsescu]] have called for cooperation between the two sovereign states.

In 2006, the [[Gheorghe Asachi]] Romanian-French School was forced by the government to change its name to the Gheorghe Asachi Moldovan-French School. Critics argued that the government acted unilaterally and discriminated against Romanians, as other schools such as the Necui-Leviţki Russian-Ukrainian School were allowed to continue using that name. In protest, four high school students from Asachi replaced the new high school sign with another with the old name. They were charged with "group-committed aggravated hooliganism".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.gandul.info/articol_10181/4_elevi_moldoveni_risca_inchisoarea__pentru_ca_sustin_ca_sunt_romani.html 4 elevi moldoveni risca inchisoarea, pentru ca sustin ca sunt romani] ("Four Moldovan students risk imprisonment for sustaining that they are Romanians"), ''Gândul'', 8 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Transnistria, the situation is considered to be far worse than the rest of Moldova. After the [[War of Transnistria|1992 war]], the Romanian population was substantially persecuted, causing at least 5,000 to 10,000 Romanians to flee the region. Although the number of Romanians in Transnistria is significant, Romanian is almost never used in public.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

Romanian schools comprise about 11% of the total schools in Transnistria. Most of the schools are forced to teach in the [[Cyrillic]] script and use outdated, 40-year-old, communist-era books, and 6 schools are permitted to teach in Romanian using the [[Latin script]]; however, pressure is often put on the institutions to close. The [[Moldovan schools in Transnistria|2004 school crisis]] is a prime example of this, when the pro-Russian government in [[Tiraspol]] forcefully attempted to close down 2 of the schools. In the orphanage of [[Tighina]], Romanian children returning from vacations found the orphanage locked by police. After spending a night outdoors, they forced their way into the building and had to stay there without water and electricity for a few months, until pressure from the Moldovan and Romanian governments and from the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) made the conflict get resolved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osce.org/publications/sg/2005/07/15621_425_en.pdf OSCE report about Romanian language in Transnistria]&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous Romanian parents were arrested or fired from their jobs for their political views and their determination to keep their children in Romanian-language schools.

Citizens who express pro-Romanian or pro-Moldovan attitudes are likewise persecuted in Transnistria. The [[Ilie Ilaşcu]] group is the most commonly known and well-documented of organisation.

==Ukraine==
[[Northern Bukovina]], as well as the [[Tiachiv]] and [[Rakhiv]] [[raion]]s (districts) of [[Zakarpattia Oblast]] (Transcarpathia), are the regions in Ukraine with considerable Romanian minorities, according to the [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|2001 Ukrainian Census]].

The Ukrainian Census of 2001 was criticized by Dr. Ion Popescu, leader of the National Council of the Interregional Union of the Romanian Community in Ukraine and also one of the authors of the [[Constitution of Ukraine]], who claims that the very existence of the classification of Moldovans as a separate ethnic group in census results is a "continuation of the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] and Soviet policies of artificially dividing Romanians into [[Romanians]] and [[Moldovans]]"[https://web.archive.org/web/20071027141344/http://noinu.rdscj.ro/article.php?articleID=149&amp;document=19.]&lt;!---is this a quote? than quotation marks are in order if not, pls replace with the exact quote---&gt;. However, the response to the census question about the ethnicity had to be written in into the census form rather than picked from a pre-determined set of choices and the census respondents were free to claim their ethnicity as they wished &lt;ref name=Censform&gt;[http://www.ukrcensus.gov.ua/eng/organization/ The Census form] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830230721/http://www.ukrcensus.gov.ua/eng/organization/ |date=August 30, 2006 }} at the State Statistics Committee of Ukraine web-site.&lt;/ref&gt;  not to respond to this or any other particular census question or not answer any questions at all; besides, no allegation of counting fraud were ever brought up. It is therefore unclear if Dr. Popescu criticizes the way in which the census was conducted or the way in which data was processed.

The number of Romanian students at [[Chernivtsi University]] declined sharply in Soviet times. In 1991-92, the last year of Soviet rule, the number of Romanian students was only 4.44% (434 out of 9,769) [https://web.archive.org/web/20071027141344/http://noinu.rdscj.ro/article.php?articleID=149&amp;document=19.]. Among teaching faculty, under-representation of Romanians is also evident. The breakdown by nationalities (in the same year) reveals: Ukrainian teachers 465 (77.1%), Russians 102 (16.9%), Moldovans 9 (1.4%), Romanians 7 (1.1%), Belorussians 6 (0.9%), etc. Even after Ukrainian independence, the number of Romanian students at the University continued to decline, to only 3.9% in 1992-93, which is much less than the overall percentage of Romanians in the region's general population. Since 1997, arrangements have been made for some students to study at universities in Romania [http://noinu.rdscj.ro/article.phparticleID=149&amp;document=19]. In 2001 the [[Christian-Democratic Alliance of the Romanians]] from Ukraine reported that Romanians in [[Chernivtsi]] lack an opportunity to study at the university level in their native language.[http://www.minelres.lv/minelres/archive/04052001-10:44:51-22702.html]

However, it should be noted that according to the Ukrainian Constitution adopted after its 1991 independence, [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] is the only [[state language]] in the country, and the state higher education system was switched to Ukrainian, according to the common practice in many countries worldwide and this practice was not directed specifically at the Romanian population. For example, the majority of Ukrainian universities do not provide education in [[Russian language|Russian]] either, despite the fact that Russian is the native language of a much more considerable part of the population in Ukraine.

At the same time, there are schools teaching Romanian as a primary language, as well as newspapers, TV, and radio broadcasting in Romanian [http://www.ucipr.kiev.ua/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=3384&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0&amp;thold=0], [https://web.archive.org/web/20090514084325/http://www.saske.sk/cas/1-2000/gulpa-petrisce.html], [http://www.ucipr.kiev.ua/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=3377&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0&amp;thold=0]. Future teachers for Romanian schools are trained in at the Chernivtsi University in the fields of Romanian philology, mathematics and physics [http://www.chnu.cv.ua/index.php?page=ua/gradinf/rules/02bac_d]. Romanian organizations still complain that despite this, 19 villages inhabited by Romanians have been deprived of schooling in their native language, therefore creating a worse situation than that which existed under the repressive Soviet regime [https://web.archive.org/web/20071027141332/http://noinu.rdscj.ro/article.php?articleID=146&amp;document=3].

==Yugoslavia and modern Serbia==
The [[Romanians of Serbia|Romanians]] living in the Autonomous Province of [[Vojvodina]] are very well represented at the provincial level despite their small presence (about 30,000 people, 1.5% of the province's population of around 2 million), and Romanian is one of the six official languages of the province. However, their counterparts in Eastern [[Central Serbia]] (mostly in the [[Timočka Krajina|Timok Valley]] and [[Braničevo (region)|Branicevo]]), known as [[Vlachs of Serbia|Vlachs]] and outnumbering the Vojvodinian Romanians, have not had any privileges. As example from [[Negotin]] in [[Vrsac]], the Romanian local television station door was vandalized with the inscription "Out Romanians, Serbia!!!" (Serbian: ''Napolje Rumuni, Srbija!!!'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Hronika/342455/Grafiti-mrznje-u-Vrscu-Napolje-Rumuni|title=Blic Online - Grafiti mržnje u Vršcu: "Napolje Rumuni!"|work=Blic Online|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Timok Vlachs speak the same dialect ([[Daco-Romanian]]) as is spoken to the north, in [[Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;Thede Kahl, Ethnizität und räumliche Verteilung der Aromunen in Südosteuropa. Münster, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Serbian authorities have pursued a policy of de-nationalization as they have slowly changed the term ''Romanian'' into ''Vlach'' through the years.&lt;ref&gt;M. V. Fifor. Assimilation or Acculturalisation: Creating Identities in the New Europe. The case of Vlachs in Serbia. Published in Cultural Identity and Ethnicity in Central Europe, [[Jagellonian University]], Cracow. M.Fifor Assimilation or Acculturalisation: Creating Identities in the New Europe.

These people declare themselves on census forms as ethnic [[Vlachs of Serbia|Vlachs]] and their number is about 40,000. Nevertheless, older Serbian censuses counted up to 200,000 Romanians (Vlachs) in present-day Central Serbia (the 1895-census counted 159,510 Romanians, the 1921-census counted 150,098 Romanians, the 1953-census counted 198,793 [[Vlach language in Serbia|Vlach (Romanian)]] - speakers).

Since 2004 they are regular clashes between the Serbian authorities and the Romanian community in Timok when [[Bojan Aleksandrovic]], a [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] priest decided to build a small church where he would hold services in [[Romanian language|Romanian]]. The priest has been subjected to threats while children attending mass with their parents have been humiliated in the village school by their Serbian teacher. Romanians in Serbia proper do not have the right to schooling and public worship in their native language.&lt;ref name="Protests on the Council of Europe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assembly.coe.int/Mainf.asp?link=/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc05/EDOC10533.htm|title=Assemblée parlementaire du Conseil de l'Europe|work=coe.int|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,850103,00.html] April 25, 2003 on [[Deutsche Welle]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the town of [[Negotin]], the Romanian Cultural Association was vandalized in 2004 when Serbian pro-fascist ultra-nationalists wrote "Out of Serbia" on the windows of the main doors.&lt;ref name="Protests on the Council of Europe"/&gt;

== Romania ==
In 2013 accusations of discrimination in [[Covasna]] surfaced against Hungarian students and teachers. During a ceremony for the national day of Hungary, some Romanian students wearing the Romanian flag were physically assaulted by older students, and threatened by teachers with punishment for wearing the national symbol. As a result, the Romanian human rights organisation ActiveWatch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.activewatch.ro/en/about-us/about-activewatch/|title=About ActiveWatch|work=ActiveWatch|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; issued a statement condemning the actions of the school's administration, which it considers a blunt infringement of human rights and freedom of expression.&lt;ref name="activewatch.ro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.activewatch.ro/ro/freeex/reactie-rapida/dreptul-la-libera-exprimare-reprimat-abuziv-de-conducerea-unui-liceu-din-covasna/|title=Dreptul la liberă exprimare reprimat abuziv de conducerea unui liceu din Covasna|work=ActiveWatch|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="activewatch.ro"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adevarul.ro/news/eveniment/protest-sabina-fetita-bentita-tricolor-zeci-persoane-costume-nationale-steaguri-romanesti-s-au-adunat-liceul-covasna-1_514c16d200f5182b853d5d1d/index.html|title=UPDATE Sute de persoane protestează în mai multe oraşe din ţară pentru susţinerea Sabinei, fata cu bentiţa tricoloră|work=adevarul.ro|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realitatea.net/bentita-tricolora-protest-in-costume-nationale-la-liceul-din-covasna-elevii-nu-au-intrat-la-ore_1140838.html|title=BENTIŢA TRICOLORĂ.

== Switzerland ==

In 2009, a right-wing political party ([[Swiss People's Party]] (SVP)) had run an anti-immigration campaign, against Romanians and Bulgarians, distributing and displaying banners depicting citizens of these countries as "crows".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ithaca.edu/rhp/programs/cmd/blogs/posters_and_election_propaganda/another_anti-immigrant_poster_in_switzerland/|title=Posters and Election Propaganda|work=ithaca.edu|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==European Union==

Anti-Romanian sentiment in the European Union refers to the discrimination of Romanian citizens within the European Union.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} As a member of the E.U., Romanian citizens have faced ethnic profiling in various [[Europe|European]] countries and open discrimination in countries like Italy or Austria.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===United Kingdom===
In June 2009, having had their windows broken and deaths threats made against them, twenty Romanian families were forced from their homes in [[Lisburn Road]], [[Belfast]], in [[Northern Ireland]]. Up to 115 people, including women and children, were forced to seek refuge in a local [[church hall]] after being attacked. They were later moved by the authorities to a safer location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2009/0618/1224249058810.html|title=Racist attacks on Roma are latest low in North's intolerant history|date=18 June 2009|publisher=irishtimes.com|accessdate=18 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Anti-racism|anti-racist]] rally in the city on 15 June was attacked by youths chanting [[neo-Nazi]] slogans.

Following the arrest of three local youths in relation to the attacks, the church where the Romanians had been given shelter was badly vandalised. Using 'emergency funds', Northern Ireland authorities assisted most of the victims to return to Romania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/jun/23/belfast-church-vandalised-racist-attacks-romanians|title=Vandals attack Belfast church that sheltered Romanian victims of racism|last= McDonald|first=Henry|date=23 June 2009|publisher=guardian.co.uk,|accessdate=23 June 2009 | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090626063353/http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/jun/23/belfast-church-vandalised-racist-attacks-romanians| archivedate= 26 June 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/8114234.stm|title=Romanians leave NI after attacks|date=23 June 2009|publisher=BBC News website|accessdate=23 June 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090624091208/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/8114234.stm| archivedate= 24 June 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on growing dissatisfaction with the European Union, several British politicians have posed a stance against the free movement of Romanians (and Bulgarians) within the E.U. and subsequently in the United Kingdom. As a result, multiple British newspapers have started publishing discriminatory articles about Romanian citizens, thus inciting an anti-Romanian sentiment; mainly against the Roma minority.

In 2013, Romanian ambassador [[Ion Jinga]] stated that a part of the British media launched a series of negative articles concerning Romanians, with reference to their “invasion”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.publicserviceeurope.com/article/2686/uk-cannot-afford-eu-open-borders-any-longer&lt;/ref&gt; to the United Kingdom, criminality, social benefits abuse,&lt;ref&gt;Public service Europe: http://www.publicserviceeurope.com/article/2686/uk-cannot-afford-eu-open-borders-any-longer&lt;/ref&gt; and accusing Romania of involvement in the [[2013 horse meat scandal|meat adulteration scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2277223/Horsemeat-central-Inside-abattoir-Romania-revealed-main-source-contaminated-products.html|title=Horsemeat central: Inside the abattoir in Romania revealed as main source of contaminated products - Daily Mail Online|work=Mail Online|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ambassador Jinga responded to these allegations through a series of interviews and articles in British newspapers,&lt;ref&gt;ITV: Alarmist predictions' over immigrants can cause racism:  www.itv.com/news/update/2013-02-22/alarmist-predictions...

:''"Now, almost on a daily basis I am asked where I am originally from, and I have to face a racist attitude following my answer."''

In 2013, the [[Daily Express]] newspaper launched a 'Crusade' against new [[European Union]] migrants from [[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]]. The frontpage on Thursday 31 October declared 'Britain is full and fed up. Today join your Daily Express Crusade to stop new flood of Romanian and Bulgarian migrants'. [[UKIP]] leader [[Nigel Farage]] declared that he had signed the petition, and urged other to do the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/440538/I-ve-signed-the-Express-petition-you-should-too-Remember-it-ll-be-Albanians-next|title=I’ve signed the Express petition – you should too!

===Germany===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}
In 2013 a prominent German newspaper, Der Spiegel, has published a short video displaying Roma-Romanians living in the city of Duisburg. The video shows a small number of Roma-Romanians and uncensored under-aged children living in a ghetto-like part of the city, without access to proper public services and living in poor housing conditions. Although there is no proof that the Romanian citizens were unemployed, the video claims they are a burden on the local welfare system. The discriminatory aspect of this video is visible through the fact that a number of German citizens are shown living in the same conditions; yet blaming the foreign citizens. This further increases the anti-Romanian sentiment, in a country where the majority of Romanian (and Bulgarian) citizens are well integrated.

===France===
Historically, France had cultivated a [[France–Romania relations|close relationship]] with the [[Romanian Principalities]] being a strong supporter of their independence and unification in 1859 and ultimately  of Greater Romania in 1918. Many of the prominent Romanian scientists and artists like [[Henry Coanda]] and [[Constantin Brancusi]] had studied and worked in Paris and Bucharest was nicknamed Le Petit Paris for its cosmopolitan atmosphere. Furthermore, the [[Romanian flag]] bears homage to the ideals of the [[French Revolution]] and has been interpreted as Liberty (blue) Justice (yellow) Fraternity (Red). 
Following the deportation of [[Roma-Romanian]] citizens from France, and numerous discriminatory articles in the French media, a small protest occurred in front of the French embassy in Bucharest, against the discrimination against Romanians in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/romanians-protest-discrimination-french-media-111226486.html|title=Romanians protest discrimination in French media|date=13 October 2011|work=[[Yahoo News]]|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===

A Dutch right wing political party ([[Wilders’ Freedom party]] (PVV)), launched a website aimed at gathering denunciations against Polish, Romanian and Bulgarian nationals living in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.com/justice/dutch-website-causes-stir-centra-news-510729|title=Dutch website causes stir in Central Europe|work=EurActiv - EU News &amp; policy debates, across languages|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denunciations consist of competition on the job market, and others, with the slogan: “Are they causing you problems? Or did you lose your job to a Pole, Bulgarian, Romanian or other Central or East European? We would love to hear from you,”; thus inciting social tension between European Citizens exercising their treaty right of freedom of movement and the local population. The Netherlands is one of the main countries blocking Romania and Bulgaria from joining the [[Schengen Agreement]]; as well as one of the countries with growing populism.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44848">'''Brain stimulation reward''' ('''BSR''') is a pleasurable phenomenon elicited via direct stimulation of specific brain regions, originally discovered by [[James Olds]] and Peter Milner.  BSR can serve as a robust [[operant]] reinforcer. Targeted stimulation activates the [[Reward system|reward system circuitry]] and establishes response habits similar to those established by [[natural reward]]s, such as food and sex.&lt;ref name="Wise_1996" /&gt; Experiments on BSR soon demonstrated that stimulation of the [[lateral hypothalamus]], along with other regions of the brain associated with natural reward, was both rewarding as well as motivation-inducing.&lt;ref name = "Wise_2002"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wise RA | title = Brain reward circuitry: insights from unsensed incentives | journal = Neuron | volume = 36 | issue = 2 | pages = 229–40 | date = October 2002 | pmid = 12383779 | doi = 10.1016/s0896-6273(02)00965-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Electrical brain stimulation]] and intracranial drug injections produce robust reward sensation due to a relatively direct activation of the reward circuitry.  This activation is considered to be more direct than rewards produced by natural stimuli, as those signals generally travel through the more indirect [[peripheral]] nerves.&lt;ref name="Wise_1989"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wise RA, Rompre PP | title = Brain dopamine and reward | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 40 | issue =  | pages = 191–225 | date = 1989 | pmid = 2648975 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ps.40.020189.001203 }}&lt;/ref&gt; BSR has been found in all vertebrates tested, including humans, and it has provided a useful tool for understanding how natural rewards are processed by specific brain regions and circuits, as well the neurotransmission associated with the reward system.&lt;ref name = "Rolls_1974"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rolls ET | title = The neural basis of brain-stimulation reward | journal = Progress in Neurobiology | date = January 1974 | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 71–118 | doi = 10.1016/0301-0082(74)90005-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intracranial self-stimulation''' ('''ICSS''') is the operant conditioning method used to produce BSR in an experimental setting.  ICSS typically involves subjects with permanent electrode implants in one of several regions of the brain known to produce BSR when stimulated.  Subjects are trained to continuously respond for electrical stimulation of that brain region, which produces BSR.&lt;ref name="Carlezon_2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carlezon WA, Chartoff EH | title = Intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) in rodents to study the neurobiology of motivation | journal = Nature Protocols | volume = 2 | issue = 11 | pages = 2987–95 | year = 2007 | pmid = 18007634 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1038/nprot.2007.441 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ICSS studies have been particularly useful for examining the effects of various pharmacological manipulations on reward sensitivity.  ICSS has been utilized as a means to gauge addiction liability for drugs of many classes, including those which act on monoaminergic, opioid, and cholinergic neurotransmission.  These data correlate well with findings from [[self-administration]] studies on the addictive properties of drugs.&lt;ref name="Negus_2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Negus SS, Miller LL | title = Intracranial self-stimulation to evaluate abuse potential of drugs | journal = Pharmacological Reviews | volume = 66 | issue = 3 | pages = 869–917 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 24973197 | doi = 10.1124/pr.112.007419 | pmc=4081730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1953, [[James Olds]] and Peter Milner, of [[McGill University]], observed that rats preferred to return to the region of the test apparatus where they received direct electrical stimulation to the septal area of the brain.&lt;ref name="Olds and Milner 1954"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olds J, Milner P | title = Positive reinforcement produced by electrical stimulation of septal area and other regions of rat brain | journal = Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology | volume = 47 | issue = 6 | pages = 419–27 | year = 1954 | pmid = 13233369 | doi = 10.1037/h0058775| url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; From this demonstration, Olds and Milner inferred that the stimulation was rewarding, and through subsequent experiments, they confirmed that they could train rats to execute novel behaviors, such as lever pressing, in order to receive short pulse trains of brain stimulation.&lt;ref name="Olds and Milner 1954" /&gt; Olds and Milner discovered the reward mechanisms in the brain involved in positive reinforcement, and their experiments led to the conclusion that electrical stimulation could serve as an operant reinforcer.&lt;ref name="Olds and Milner 1954" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Milner_1991"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Milner PM | title = Brain-stimulation reward: a review | journal = Canadian Journal of Psychology | volume = 45 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–36 | year = 1991 | pmid = 2044020 | doi = 10.1037/h0084275| url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[B.F. Skinner]], operant reinforcement occurs when a behavior is followed by the presentation of a stimulus, and it is considered essential to the learning of response habits.&lt;ref name="Olds_1975"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olds J | title = Reward and Drive Neurons | journal = Brain Stimulation Reward | year = 1975 | volume = 1 | pages = 1–30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their discovery enabled [[motivation]] and reinforcement to be understood in terms of their underlying physiology, and it led to further experimentation to determine the neural basis of reward and reinforcement.&lt;ref name="Milner_1991" /&gt; Since the initial discovery, the phenomenon of BSR has been demonstrated in all species tested, and Robert Heath similarly demonstrated that BSR can be applied to humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Heath RG | title = Electrical self-stimulation of the brain in man | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 120 | pages = 571–7 | date = December 1963 | pmid = 14086435 | doi = 10.1176/ajp.120.6.571 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brain stimulation reinforcement ==
Early studies on the motivational effects of brain stimulation addressed two primary questions: 1. Which brain sites can be stimulated to produce the perception of reward? and 2. Which drugs influence the response to stimulation and via what mechanism?&lt;ref name="Wise_1996"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wise RA | title = Addictive drugs and brain stimulation reward | journal = Annual Review of Neuroscience | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 319–40 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8833446 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ne.19.030196.001535 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigation of the brain reward circuitry reveals that it consists of a distributed, multi-synaptic circuit that determines both BSR and natural reward function.&lt;ref name="Wise_1996" /&gt; The natural drives that motivate and shape behavior reach the reward circuitry trans-synaptically through the peripheral senses of sight, sound, taste, smell, or touch.  However, experimentally-induced BSR more directly activates the reward circuitry and bypasses transduction through peripheral sensory pathways.&lt;ref name="Wise_2002" /&gt; For this reason, electrical brain stimulation provides a tool for identifying the reward circuitry within the [[central nervous system]] with some degree of anatomical and neurochemical specificity.&lt;ref name="Wise_2002" /&gt; Studies involving these two forms of laboratory reward showed stimulation of a broad range of limbic and diencephalic structures could be rewarding as well as implicated the [[dopamine]]-containing neurons of the [[mesolimbic]] dopamine system in motivational function.&lt;ref name="Wise_1996" /&gt; The motivational effect of intracranial self-stimulation varies substantially depending on the placement site of the surgically implanted electrode during electrical stimulation, and animals will work to stimulate different neural sites depending on their current state.&lt;ref name="Olds_1958"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olds J | title = Self-stimulation of the brain; its use to study local effects of hunger, sex, and drugs | journal = Science | volume = 127 | issue = 3294 | pages = 315–24 | year = 1958 | pmid = 13506579 | doi = 10.1126/science.127.3294.315 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Often, animals that work to initiate brain stimulation will also work to terminate the stimulation.&lt;ref name="Wise_1996" /&gt;

== Relationship to natural rewards and drives ==
The relationship between BSR and natural rewards (e.g. food, water and copulation) has long been debated, and much of the early research on BSR is focused on their respective similarities and differences.  BSR is facilitated through the same reinforcement pathway activated by natural rewards.   Self-stimulation can exert robust activation of central reward mechanisms due to more direct action than natural rewards, which initially activate [[peripheral nerves]].&lt;ref name="Wise_1989" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wise_2002" /&gt; BSR to the [[medial forebrain bundle]] (MFB) through either electrical or chemical means activates key components of the reward pathway also activated by natural rewards.  When specific regions of the [[hypothalamus]] are electrically stimulated, it elicits reward-related behaviors such as eating, drinking, or copulation responses.&lt;ref name="Olds_1975" /&gt;

Natural rewards are associated with a state of deprivation which results from unmet needs or desires (e.g. hunger).  These states drive instinctual, motivated behaviors like food consumption.  It has been argued that this is not the case with BSR, as it does not meet an intrinsic survival-based need.  BSR also notably lacks an established neural representation in memory that naturally facilitates the learning of reward expectancy. Both of these effects lead to diminished response rate for BSR in the early trials of a series; however, experiments have also shown that extinguished behavior can be quickly reinstated by a [[Priming (psychology)|priming]] stimulation that refreshes the short-term association involved in reward expectancy.&lt;ref name="Milner_1991" /&gt; Studies on BSR indicate that reinforcing brain stimulation may activate the natural pathways associated with natural drives as well as stimulate the reinforcement pathways that are usually activated by natural rewards.

=== Strength of drive ===
Rats will perform lever-pressing at rates of several thousand responses per hour for days in order to obtain direct electrical stimulation of the [[lateral hypothalamus]].&lt;ref name="Olds_1958" /&gt; Multiple studies have demonstrated that rats will perform reinforced behaviors at the exclusion of all other behaviors.  Experiments have shown rats will forgo food to the point of starvation in order to work for brain stimulation or intravenous [[cocaine]] when both food and stimulation are offered concurrently for a limited time each day.&lt;ref name="Wise_2002" /&gt;  Rats will also cross electrified grids to press a lever, and they are willing to withstand higher levels of shock to obtain electrical stimulation than to obtain food .&lt;ref name="Olds_1958" /&gt;

=== Satiation ===
Satiation experiments in rats have revealed that BSR does not produce satiety. Olds demonstrated that this lack of satiation associated with BSR allows animals to self-stimulate to sheer exhaustion and that satiation is dependent on the location of the electrical stimulation.&lt;ref name="Olds_1958" /&gt; In a 48-hour satiation test, rats with [[hypothalamic]] electrodes self-stimulated to exhaustion and showed no intrinsic satiation tendencies, whereas [[telencephalic]] electrodes showed radical slowing of self-stimulation after 4 to 8 hours.  The insatiability of BSR is closely related to the strength of drive.  While a natural reward, like food, is met with a feeling of being full (satiety), BSR does not have a comparable correlate.  This allows for BSR to be experienced indefinitely, or in the case of ICSS, until exhaustion.

=== Addiction ===
Addiction is a chronic brain disorder consisting of compulsive drug-taking and seeking that is maintained despite detrimental effects on various aspects of life including health, relationships, and work. Laboratory procedures can establish compulsive self-administration habits of seeking and ingesting that qualify as addictive behaviors.&lt;ref name="Wise_1996" /&gt; Rodents and [[Primate|non-human primates]] have been shown to work in a compulsive manner to receive intravenous injections of stimulants, and when access to the drugs is not limited, they will self-administer drugs to the point of severe weight loss and death.&lt;ref name="Wise_2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bozarth_1985"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bozarth MA, Wise RA | title = Toxicity associated with long-term intravenous heroin and cocaine self-administration in the rat | journal = JAMA | volume = 254 | issue = 1 | pages = 81–3 | year = 1985 | pmid = 4039767 | doi = 10.1001/jama.1985.03360010087032 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to self-administration behavior, responding for intracranial brain stimulation has a highly compulsive component which is characteristic of an addicted state. BSR is hypothesized to be so effective in establishing compulsive habits due to its more direct activation of the reward pathway, bypassing transmission through sensory pathways which occurs in response to natural rewards.  Delayed reinforcement following a response for BSR decreases how strongly this behavior is reinforced and to what extent it continues.  A delay of one second, for example, between a lever-press and reward delivery (stimulation) can reduce response levels.&lt;ref name="Wise_2002" /&gt; BSR offers insights into the neural circuitry involved in reinforcement and compulsive behavior.

Mapping and lesion studies on BSR were designed to determine the location of reward-relevant neurons as well as determine the signal pathways that are directly affected by brain stimulation. The site of intracranial self-stimulation leads to substantially different behavioral characteristics. Sites along the length of the [[medial forebrain bundle]] (MFB) through the lateral and posterior [[hypothalamus]], the [[ventral tegmental area]] (VTA), and into the [[pons]] are associated with the strongest reward effects of stimulation.&lt;ref name="Wise_1996" /&gt;

===Lateral hypothalamus===
The [[lateral hypothalamus]] is a portion of the hypothalamus, and brain stimulation to this area at the level of the medial forebrain bundle produces the highest response rates and subsequently the highest reward potency in rodents.  Lesions in this region or along its boundary cause a loss of positive drive-reward behaviors as well as all other operant drive behaviors.&lt;ref name="Olds_1975" /&gt;

===Medial forebrain bundle===
The [[medial forebrain bundle]] (MFB) is the location of the most frequently investigated brain stimulation reward sites, and it is composed of a complex bundle of [[axons]] projecting from the basal [[olfactory]] regions and the [[septal nuclei]].&lt;ref name="Wise_1989" /&gt; MFB is not the sole anatomical substrate responsible for reinforcing brain stimulation; however, it is the main tract for the ascending dopamine fibers, and it functions to relay information from the VTA to the [[nucleus accumbens]]. The rewarding effect of MFB stimulation is mediated via the activation of the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system.&lt;ref name="Wise_1996" /&gt;

===Mesolimbic pathway===
The [[mesolimbic pathway]] connects the VTA to the [[nucleus accumbens]]. The nucleus accumbens is located in the ventral [[striatum]] and integrates information from [[Mesocortical pathway|cortical]] and limbic brain structures to mediate behaviors the reinforce reward.&lt;ref name="Kokarovtseva et al. 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kokarovtseva L, Jaciw-Zurakiwsky T, Mendizabal Arbocco R, Frantseva MV, Perez Velazquez JL | title = Excitability and gap junction-mediated mechanisms in nucleus accumbens regulate self-stimulation reward in rats | journal = Neuroscience | volume = 159 | issue = 4 | pages = 1257–63 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19409225 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2009.01.065 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a major target for the dopaminergic projections from the VTA, a group of neurons located close to the midline on the floor of the [[midbrain]].  The VTA is the origin of [[dopaminergic]] cell bodies that comprise the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system.&lt;ref name="Wise_1989" /&gt;

BSR has been shown to result in the release of dopamine within the nucleus accumbens, which also occurs in response to natural rewards such as food or sex.&lt;ref name="Wise_1996" /&gt;

===Indirect activation===
[[Electrophysiology|Electrophysiological]] data suggest stimulation of the MFB or VTA does not directly activate dopaminergic neurons in the mesolimbic reward pathway.  These data suggest BSR is facilitated by initial excitation of descending, [[myelinated]] neurons which then activate the ascending, unmyelinated neurons of the VTA.  Excitatory, [[cholinergic]] inputs to the VTA are thought to play a role in this indirect activation, but the neuroanatomical components of this circuit have yet to be fully characterized.&lt;ref name="Carlezon_2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Negus_2014" /&gt;

== Intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) procedures ==
=== Initial training===
Since the initial demonstration of BSR by Olds and Milner, experiments in rodents record ICSS responding to quantify motivation to receive stimulation.  Subjects undergo stereotaxic surgery to permanently implant either a monopolar or bipolar electrode to the desired brain region.  Electrodes are connected to a stimulating apparatus at the time of the experiment.

The first portion of an ICSS experiment involves training subjects to respond for stimulation using a fixed-ratio 1 (FR-1) reinforcement schedule (1 response = 1 reward). In experiments involving rats, subjects are trained to press a lever for stimulation, and the rate of lever-pressing is typically the [[dependent variable]].&lt;ref name="Wise_1996" /&gt;  In ICSS studies using mice, a response wheel is usually used instead of a lever, as mice do not consistently perform lever-pressing behaviors.&lt;ref name="Carlezon_2007" /&gt;  Each quarter turn of the response wheel is recorded and rewarded with stimulation. The rewarding stimulus in BSR experiments is typically a train of short-duration pulses separated by interval pulses,&lt;ref name="Sonnenschein et al. 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sonnenschein B, Conover K, Shizgal P | title = Growth of brain stimulation reward as a function of duration and stimulation strength | journal = Behavioral Neuroscience | volume = 117 | issue = 5 | pages = 978–94 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14570548 | doi = 10.1037/0735-7044.117.5.978 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be manipulated experimentally using the [[independent variables]] of stimulation amplitude, frequency, and pulse [[Time|duration]].&lt;ref name="Wise_1996" /&gt;

===Establishing minimum effective current===
The amplitude (current) of stimulation determines the population of neurons being activated by the implanted electrode. In certain approaches, this is adjusted for every subject due to minor variability in electrode placement, and therefore a slightly different population of affected neurons.&lt;ref name="Milner_1991" /&gt;  Following FR1 training, it is typical to establish a minimum, threshold current which produces sufficient levels of ICSS responding (about 40 responses per minute).  This is called a discrete-trial current intensity procedure.&lt;ref name = "Phillips_2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Phillips TJ, Reed C | title = Targeting GABAB receptors for anti-abuse drug discovery | journal = Expert Opinion on Drug Discovery | volume = 9 | issue = 11 | pages = 1307–17 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25195620 | doi = 10.1517/17460441.2014.956076 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Marcus | first = Richard | last2 = Kornetsky | first2 = Conan | name-list-format = vanc | date = March 1974 | title = Negative and positive intracranial reinforcement tresholds: Effects of morphine | volume = 38 | issue = 1| pages = 1–13 | doi = 10.1007/BF00421282 | journal=Psychopharmacologia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each discrete trial consists of non-contingent stimulation at a certain amplitude followed by a brief window during which the animal can respond for more stimulation.  Effective currents for BSR elicit responding above a certain rate (3 out of 4 trials, for example).  The lowest current the animal responds sufficiently to is deemed the minimum effective current.  This is done at a constant frequency, typically at the higher end of the frequency range employed in ICSS studies (140–160&amp;nbsp;Hz).&lt;ref name="Carlezon_2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Negus_2014" /&gt;

Within-subject study design is often implemented to help eliminate variability introduced by electrode placement.  Between-subject study design requires rigorous [[Histology|histologic]] verification of electrode placement to ensure consistency between experimental groups.  Subjects with imperfect electrode placement require a higher simulation amplitude to activate the reward circuitry and produce ICSS responding.  Subjects with ideal anatomical placement will respond at lower stimulation amplitudes.  This corrective process is limited, however, since increasing the population of activated neurons can result in off-target activation of neighboring circuitry.  This is often culminated in undesired motor side effects upon stimulation, due to the adjacency of the MFB to the [[internal capsule]], a bundle of axons carrying descending motor information to the [[brainstem]].  Inadvertent stimulation of these axons can lead to motor output such as movement of the head or paw twitching.&lt;ref name="Liebman_1983"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liebman JM | title = Discriminating between reward and performance: a critical review of intracranial self-stimulation methodology | journal = Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 45–72 | year = 1983 | pmid = 6132357 | doi = 10.1016/0149-7634(83)90007-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carlezon_2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Milner_1991" /&gt;

=== Frequency-rate responding ===
At a constant minimum effective current, ICSS responding is recorded over a series of trials which vary in stimulation frequency.  Each trial consists of a short priming phase of non-contingent stimulation, a response phase where responses are recorded and rewarded with stimulation, and a short time-out phase where responses are not recorded and no stimulation is delivered.  This is repeated for a series of 10-15 different ascending or descending frequencies, in .05 log-unit increments, which range anywhere from 20–200&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref name="Carlezon_2007" /&gt;

While the amplitude of the stimulation influences which neurons are being stimulated, the frequency of stimulation determines the firing rate induced in that neuronal population.  Generally, increasing stimulation frequency increases the firing rate in the target population.  This is associated with higher ICSS response rates, eventually reaching a maximum level at the maximum firing rate, limited by the refractory properties of neurons.

=== Other factors ===
The independent variables of stimulation train and pulse duration can also be varied to determine how each affects ICSS response rates.  Longer train durations produce more vigorous responding up to a point, after which rate of responding varies inversely with train length.  This is due to lever-pressing for additional stimulation before the previously earned train has finished.&lt;ref name="Wise_1996" /&gt;

The reinforcement schedule can also be manipulated to determine how motivated an animal is to receive stimulation, reflected by how hard they are willing to work to earn it.  This can be done by increasing the number of responses required to receive a reward (FR-2, FR-3, FR-4, etc.) or by implementing a progressive-ratio schedule, where the number of required responses continually increases.  The number of required responses increases for each trial until the animal fails to reach the required number of responses.  This is considered the "break-point" and is a good indication of motivation related to reward magnitude.&lt;ref name="Negus_2014" /&gt;

=== Curve-shift analysis ===
Stimulation intensity, pulse duration, or pulse frequency can be varied to determine dose-response functions ICSS responding using curve-shift analysis.  This approach generally resembles traditional pharmacological dose-response curve where the frequency of stimulation, rather than the dose of a drug, is examined.&lt;ref name="Wise_1996" /&gt;  This method allows for quantitative analysis of reward-modulating treatments on response rates in comparison to baseline conditions.  Lower stimulation frequencies fail to sustain ICSS responding at a probability above chance. Response rates increase rapidly over a dynamic range of stimulation frequencies as the frequency increases, until a maximum response rate is reached.&lt;ref name="Wise_1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wise_1989" /&gt;  Changes in the rate of response over this range reflects changes in the magnitude of the reward.&lt;ref name="Wise_1989" /&gt; Rate-frequency, rate-intensity, or rate-duration functions make inferences about the potency and efficacy of stimulation, as well as elucidate how drugs alter the rewarding impact of stimulation.&lt;ref name="Wise_1996" /&gt;

Curve-shift analysis is often used in pharmacological studies to compare baseline response rates to those following drug administration. The maximum response rate during baseline conditions is typically used to normalize data in a frequency-rate curve to a maximum control rate (MCR).  More specifically, the number of responses for any given trial is divided by the highest number of responses recorded in a baseline condition trial, which is then multiplied by 100. In an experimental condition, if the MCR falls below 100% at the highest stimulation frequencies, it is thought to reflect an impacted capability or motivation to respond, potentially induced by a drug with sedative or aversive properties.  Shifts above 100% of the MCR indicate improved ability or motivation to respond, potentially induced by a drug with rewarding or stimulant properties.&lt;ref name="Liebman_1983" /&gt;

Sensitivity of the neural circuitry to the rewarding properties of stimulation is assessed by analyzing left- or right-shifts in the M50, or the frequency at which 50% of the maximum number of responses was recorded.  Reaching 50% of the MCR at a lower frequency is characteristic of a left-shift in the frequency-rate curve and sensitization of the reward circuitry to stimulation.  An increase in the M50 indicates that a greater stimulation frequency was required to reach 50% of the MCR, and the reward circuitry has been desensitized by the experimental manipulation.  Another way of analyzing the frequency-rate curve between control and experimental conditions is to do a linear regression through the ascending data points in a plot of raw data (which has not been normalized to the MCR).  The point where y=0, or the x-intercept, is called the threshold frequency or theta zero (θ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;).  This is the frequency at which ICSS response rates are equal to 0 (and any frequency above this will theoretically elicit ICSS responding).&lt;ref name="Carlezon_2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Negus_2014" /&gt;

== Modulation with drugs ==
There are several major drug classes which have been studied extensively in relation to ICSS behavior: monoaminergic drugs, opioids, cholinergic drugs, GABAergic drugs, as well as a small number of drugs from other classes.&lt;ref name="Negus_2014" /&gt;  These studies generally compare ICSS responding at baseline and following drug administration.  Typically, the frequency-rate approach is used to determine changes in the M50 or θ&lt;sub&gt;0.&lt;/sub&gt;

Drugs with increased addiction liability generally decrease the stimulation threshold for ICSS responding, while drugs with [[Aversive salience|aversive]] properties generally increase the stimulation threshold to achieve ICSS responding.  These studies provide insight into the specific neurochemical mechanisms involved in the facilitation of BSR, and how reward perception can be modulated by pharmacologically altering the activity of specific neurotransmitter systems.  Pharmacological manipulation of these systems can have either a direct or indirect effect on the activity of the reward circuitry.  Understanding drug-specific effects on ICSS response thresholds has helped elucidate how different neurotransmitter systems influence the reward circuitry by either potentiating or suppressing sensitivity to rewarding stimulation and influencing motivation to perform reward-associated behaviors.

BSR and drugs of addiction produce their rewarding effects through shared neuroanatomical and neurochemical mechanisms.  Studies using lesion, pharmacological, and anatomical mapping of the brain have revealed that many drugs of abuse (e.g. [[amphetamine]], [[cocaine]], [[opioids]], [[nicotine]], etc.) activate the reward circuitry of the MFB, which is similarly activated by stimulation to achieve BSR. The [[Axons|neuronal axons]] of the mesolimbic dopamine system, a key component of the reward circuitry, generally have high thresholds for stimulation.  However, these thresholds can be increased or decreased by drug administration, influencing sensitivity to intracranial stimulation and ICSS behavior.

=== Monoaminergic drugs ===
[[File:Frequency_rate_chart_example.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Frequency_rate_chart_example.jpg|border|right|500x500px|Example frequency-rate plot for 10 trials over increasing stimulation frequencies. Hypothetical data (which reflects established concepts in ICSS procedures) is plotted as the percent maximum responses for any given trial during a sequence. The blue line represents hypothetical data at baseline, while the black line represents hypothetical data following administration of 10 mg/kg cocaine to the subject. This reflects the characteristic "left-shift" of the frequency-rate curve following administration of a drug which increases dopaminergic transmission in the reward pathway.]]
The effects of drugs which alter the neurotransmission of dopamine, [[norepinephrine]], and [[serotonin]] have been studied extensively in relation to BSR.  Neurochemical studies have shown that BSR results in the release of dopamine within the nucleus accumbens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Phillips AG, Blaha CD, Fibiger HC | title = Neurochemical correlates of brain-stimulation reward measured by ex vivo and in vivo analyses | journal = Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 13 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 99–104 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2530478 | doi = 10.1016/S0149-7634(89)80017-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect is generally potentiated following administration of drugs which themselves increase the amount of extracellular dopamine in the nucleus accumbens, such as [[cocaine]], which inhibits re-uptake of dopamine to the intracellular space by blocking its [[Dopamine transporter|transporter]]. Conversely, these levels are decreased and the rewarding properties of BSR are blocked following administration of drugs which antagonize dopamine receptors or reduce the amount of extracellular dopamine, by promoting either degradation or [[Reuptake|re-uptake]] of the neurotransmitter.  While dopamine is generally considered to be the main neurotransmitter implicated in the reward system, it is often not the only neurotransmitter affected by addictive, monoaminergic drugs. Importantly, the circuitry involved in BSR is multi-synaptic and not exclusively dopaminergic.&lt;ref name="Carlezon_2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wise_2002" /&gt; This introduces potential for modulation by other neurotransmitter systems at different stages in the transmission of the reward signal.

Additionally, drugs which affect monoamine transmission vary in their selectivity.  For example, drugs with high selectivity for increasing dopamine and norepinephrine transmission relative to serotonin transmission tend to have highly addictive properties. Amphetamine and cocaine share this selectivity profile, and administration of these drugs generally results in a left-shift in M50 and θ&lt;sub&gt;0,&lt;/sub&gt; indicating sensitization of the reward circuitry and high abuse potential.  This characteristic leftward-shift of M50 in response to a moderate dose of cocaine is illustrated in a hypothetical data set in Figure 1. Note that the maximum response rate is reached at a lower frequency than it is at baseline, and there is a significant response rate at the lowest frequency, which did not produce responding under baseline conditions.  Even following chronic administration of methamphetamine or cocaine, there is little to no tolerance to ICSS facilitation.  After chronic treatment is stopped, however, there is a withdrawal-induced depression of ICSS responding which can be reversed by re-administering the drug.&lt;ref name="Negus_2014" /&gt;

Drugs with more balanced selectivity for dopamine/norepinephrine and serotonin transmission, such as 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine ([[MDMA]]), tend to be less addictive, and they have mixed effects on ICSS responding depending on dose and stimulation frequency. Serotonin selective drugs, however, tend to result in either a lack of ICSS potentiation or depression of ICSS responding (a right-shift in frequency-rate curve), and these drugs are generally considered to be less addictive. One such example is fenfluramine, which was previously marketed as an appetite suppressant.&lt;ref name="Negus_2014" /&gt; Dopamine antagonists generally result in the depression of ICSS responding and a rightward-shift in the frequency-rate curve. This suggests decreased BSR and possibly increased aversive properties of the stimulation.  Following chronic treatment with a dopamine antagonist, there is withdrawal-induced facilitation of ICSS, the opposite effect of what is observed following chronic treatment with stimulants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barr AM, Markou A, Phillips AG | title = A 'crash' course on psychostimulant withdrawal as a model of depression | journal = Trends in Pharmacological Sciences | volume = 23 | issue = 10 | pages = 475–82 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12368072 | doi = 10.1016/S0165-6147(02)02086-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wise_1996" /&gt;

=== Opioids ===
Drugs which act on the [[opioid]] system generally vary in selectivity for the mu (μ), delta (δ), and kappa (κ) opioid receptors.  Their addictive properties are highly dependent on these selectivities. Generally speaking, high potency mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonists have high abuse potential, while kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) agonists generally produce a dysphoric state.  Morphine, a MOR agonist, was one of the earliest studied drugs at the advent of ICSS and BSR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olds J, Travis RP | title = Effects of chlorpromazine, meprobamate, pentobarbital and morphine on self-stimulation | journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 128 | pages = 397–404 | date = April 1960 | pmid = 14428622 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   High potency MOR agonists like morphine have a somewhat varied effect on ICSS responding despite having high abuse potential, resulting in both potentiation and depression.  The effect these drugs have on ICSS responding has been found to be highly dependent on dose, pretreatment time, and previous opioid exposure.  Various studies on the effect of MOR-selective drugs including morphine, heroin, fentanyl, methadone, and hydrocodone have found mixed effects on ICSS responding.  Low doses of these drugs have been found to elicit weak facilitation of ICSS, while high doses result in a biphasic ICSS profile, consisting of a higher threshold for ICSS at lower frequencies followed by ICSS potentiation at higher frequencies. Upon chronic administration of high-potency MOR agonists at low doses, there is no tolerance to ICSS facilitation.&lt;ref name="Negus_2014" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = Ralph U. | last1 = Esposito | first2 = Conan | last2 = Kornetsky | name-list-format = vanc | date = June 1978 | title=Opioids and rewarding brain stimulation | journal = Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 115–122 | doi = 10.1016/0149-7634(78)90052-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opioid receptor antagonists, such as [[naloxone]], can reverse the effects of both opioid receptor agonists on ICSS responding and the potentiating effects of psychostimulants like methamphetamine.  Naloxone, which is a competitive antagonist of all opioid receptor sub-types, does not influence ICSS responding when administered on its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schaefer GJ | title = Opiate antagonists and rewarding brain stimulation | journal = Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–17 | date = 1988 | pmid = 3287237 | doi=10.1016/s0149-7634(88)80068-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  KOR agonism, typically associated with dysphoric states, more consistently results in a depression of ICSS responding.  The KOR agonist salvinorin-A, for example, causes an overall decrease in ICSS response rates at lower stimulation frequencies.  Repeated administration does not produce tolerance to ICSS depression.&lt;ref name="Carlezon_2007" /&gt;  The effects of delta opioid receptor (DOR) agonists/antagonists on ICSS are less clear.  One DOR agonist, SNC80, has been found to cause ICSS depression, but there is counter-evidence suggesting some delta agonists might have weak ICSS facilitation properties.&lt;ref name="Negus_2014" /&gt;

=== Cholinergic drugs ===
Cholinergic drugs have been less extensively studied than monoamines and opioids.  The most commonly studied cholinergic drug is [[nicotine]], the highly-addictive, psychoactive substance in cigarettes.  Nicotine is an agonist of [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]]s (nAchRs), which are ligand-gated ion channels.  The addictive properties of nicotine have been found to be associated with agonism specifically of the [[Alpha-4 beta-2 nicotinic receptor|α4β2]] sub-type of nicotinic receptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Melroy-Greif WE, Stitzel JA, Ehringer MA | title = Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors: upregulation, age-related effects and associations with drug use | journal = Genes, Brain, and Behavior | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 89–107 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26351737 | pmc = 4780670 | doi = 10.1111/gbb.12251 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many studies have confirmed that low doses of nicotine result in ICSS facilitation, while higher doses result in ICSS depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Itasaka M, Hironaka N, Miyata H | title = [Behavioral characteristics of nicotine seeking: a role of the nicotine-conditioned effects and other mechanisms] | journal = Nihon Arukoru Yakubutsu Igakkai Zasshi = Japanese Journal of Alcohol Studies &amp; Drug Dependence | volume = 50 | issue = 3 | pages = 135–43 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 26502572 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Negus_2014" /&gt;  Chronic treatment with nicotine does not result in tolerance to ICSS facilitation at low doses, but does result in tolerance to the depressive effects of high doses.  Withdrawal-induced depression of ICSS facilitation at low doses is also observed, as in MOR agonists and monoamine stimulants.  It should be noted that the effects of nicotine treatment on ICSS response thresholds and maximum response rates are not as significant as they are in the case of many addictive MOR agonists and monoamine stimulants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bauzo RM, Bruijnzeel AW | title = Animal models of nicotine withdrawal: intracranial self-stimulation and somatic signs of withdrawal | journal = Methods in Molecular Biology | volume = 829 | pages = 257–68 | date = 2012 | pmid = 22231819 | doi = 10.1007/978-1-61779-458-2_16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Negus_2014" /&gt;

=== GABAergic drugs ===
GABAergic transmission is inhibitory, and the two main receptors for GABA are [[GABAA receptor|GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[GABAB receptor|GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;]].  Drugs which act on GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors, which are ligand-gated ion channels, are more widely studied, as they generally produce more robust effects on [[sedation]] and [[anxiety]], and they are commonly prescribed for therapeutic uses.  Several of these drugs have addictive properties, including several [[benzodiazepines]] and [[barbiturate]]s. Low doses of these drugs generally result in ICSS facilitation, while higher doses can result in depression of ICSS and an overall decrease in the maximum response rate.  The latter is likely related to an impaired ability to respond due to the sedative and hypnotic properties of these drugs.  Ethanol influences GABA receptor activity, and has been found to moderately facilitate ICSS,&lt;ref name="Negus_2014" /&gt; despite older publications suggesting these findings are inconsistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kornetsky C, Bain GT, Unterwald EM, Lewis MJ | title = Brain stimulation reward: effects of ethanol | journal = Alcoholism, Clinical and Experimental Research | volume = 12 | issue = 5 | pages = 609–16 | date = October 1988 | pmid = 2852475 | doi=10.1111/j.1530-0277.1988.tb00250.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptor agonists and [[Allosteric modulator|positive allosteric modulators]] have been found to result in ICSS depression and have been found to inhibit the reinforcing effects of several drugs, including cocaine, methamphetamine, and nicotine, reversing the ICSS facilitation these drugs typically cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vlachou S, Markou A | title = GABAB receptors in reward processes | journal = Advances in Pharmacology | volume = 58 | pages = 315–71 | date = 2010 | pmid = 20655488 | doi = 10.1016/S1054-3589(10)58013-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Clinical and pre-clinical evidence ==
Mechanisms of BSR offer a tool that provides insight into the way the brain governs behavior through motivation and reinforcement, especially in regard to addictive and compulsive behaviors. ICSS studies of BSR have proven to be a robust measure of reward sensitivity, and have potential to help assess the abuse liability of various future therapeutics.&lt;ref name="Negus_2014" /&gt;  Additionally, ICSS studies have potential to be used to gauge how reward sensitivity is affected by genetic factors associated with addictive disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yu C, McClellan J | title = Genetics of Substance Use Disorders | journal = Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America | volume = 25 | issue = 3 | pages = 377–85 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 27338962 | doi = 10.1016/j.chc.2016.02.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yang J, Li MD | title = Converging findings from linkage and association analyses on susceptibility genes for smoking and other addictions | journal = Molecular Psychiatry | volume = 21 | issue = 8 | pages = 992–1008 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27166759 | pmc = 4956568 | doi = 10.1038/mp.2016.67 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Choi HD, Shin WG | title = Meta-analysis of the association between a serotonin transporter 5-HTTLPR polymorphism and smoking cessation | journal = Psychiatric Genetics | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 87–91 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 26886943 | doi = 10.1097/YPG.0000000000000116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Drugs which have been found to prevent ICSS facilitation have potential to be developed and therapeutically implemented to reduce the risk of addictive disorders in a clinical setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chiamulera C, Padovani L, Corsi M | title = Drug discovery for the treatment of substance use disorders: novel targets, repurposing, and the need for new paradigms | journal = Current Opinion in Pharmacology | volume = 35 | pages = 120–124 | date = August 2017 | pmid = 28874314 | doi = 10.1016/j.coph.2017.08.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Phillips_2014" /&gt;

In [[petrology]], the [[mineral]] [[clinopyroxene]] is used for [[temperature]] and [[pressure]] calculations of the [[magma]] that produced [[igneous rock]] containing this mineral. '''Clinopyroxene thermobarometry''' is one of several [[geothermobarometry|geothermobarometers]]. Two things makes this method especially useful: first, clinopyroxene is a common [[phenocryst]] in igneous rocks and easy to identify; second, the [[fractional crystallization (geology)|crystallization]] of the [[jadeite]] component of clinopyroxene implies a growth in [[molar volume]] being thus a good indicator of [[pressure]].

The '''coefficient of performance''' or '''COP''' (sometimes '''CP''' or '''CoP''') of a [[Heat pump and refrigeration cycle| heat pump, refrigerator or air conditioning system]] is a ratio of useful heating or cooling provided to work required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tetech.com/temodules/graphs/instructions.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124080037/http://www.tetech.com/temodules/graphs/instructions.pdf |archivedate=2013-01-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://us.grundfos.com/service-support/encyclopedia-search/cop-coefficient-ofperformance.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Higher COPs equate to lower operating costs.  The COP usually exceeds 1, especially in heat pumps, because, instead of just converting work to heat (which, if 100% efficient, would be a COP_hp of 1), it pumps additional heat from a heat source to where the heat is required.  For complete systems, COP calculations should include energy consumption of all power consuming auxiliaries. COP is highly dependent on operating conditions, especially absolute temperature and relative temperature between sink and system, and is often graphed or averaged against expected conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tetech.com/temodules/graphs/HP-199-1.4-0.8.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107132318/http://www.tetech.com/temodules/graphs/HP-199-1.4-0.8.pdf |archivedate=2009-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Equation ==
The equation is:
:&lt;math&gt;{\rm COP} = \frac{ Q}{ W}&lt;/math&gt;
where
* &lt;math&gt; Q \ &lt;/math&gt; is the useful [[heat]] supplied or removed by the considered system.
* &lt;math&gt;W \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Mechanical work|work]] required by the considered system.

The COP for heating and cooling are thus different, because the heat reservoir of interest is different. When one is interested in how well a machine cools, the COP is the ratio of the heat removed from the cold reservoir to input work. However, for heating, the COP is the ratio  of the heat removed from the cold reservoir plus the input work to the input work:
:&lt;math&gt; {\rm COP}_{\rm heating}=\frac{| Q_{H}|}{ W}=\frac{| Q_{C}| +  W}{ W}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; {\rm COP}_{\rm cooling}=\frac{| Q_{C}|}{ W}&lt;/math&gt;
where
*&lt;math&gt;  Q_{C} \ &lt;/math&gt; is the heat removed from the cold reservoir.
*&lt;math&gt;  Q_{H} \ &lt;/math&gt; is the heat supplied to the hot reservoir.

==Derivation==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}
According to the [[first law of thermodynamics]], in a reversible system we can show that &lt;math&gt;Q_{H}=Q_{C}+W &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;W=Q_{H}-Q_{C}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;Q_{H}&lt;/math&gt; is the heat transferred to the hot reservoir and &lt;math&gt;Q_{C}&lt;/math&gt; is the heat collected from the cold reservoir.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore, by substituting for W,&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; {\rm COP}_{\rm heating}=\frac{Q_{H}}{Q_{H}-Q_{C}}&lt;/math&gt;

For a heat pump operating at maximum theoretical efficiency (i.e. Carnot efficiency), it can be shown that 
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{Q_{H}}{T_{H}}=\frac{Q_{C}}{T_{C}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q_{C}=\frac{Q_{H}T_{C}}{T_{H}}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;T_{H} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_{C}&lt;/math&gt; are the temperatures of the hot and cold heat reservoirs respectively.
'''Note:''' these equations must '''use an absolute temperature scale''', for example, '''K'''elvin or '''R'''ankine.

At maximum theoretical efficiency, &lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; {\rm COP}_{\rm heating}=\frac{T_{H}}{T_{H}-T_{C}} &lt;/math&gt;
which is equal to the reciprocal of the ideal efficiency for a heat engine, because a heat pump is a heat engine operating in reverse.  Similarly, &lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; {\rm COP}_{\rm cooling}=\frac{Q_{C}}{Q_{H}-Q_{C}} =\frac{T_{C}}{T_{H}-T_{C}}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the COP of a heat pump depends on its duty. The heat rejected to the hot sink is greater than the heat absorbed from the cold source, so the heating COP is 1 greater than the cooling COP.

&lt;math&gt;{\rm COP}_{\rm heating}&lt;/math&gt; applies to heat pumps and &lt;math&gt;{\rm COP}_{\rm cooling}&lt;/math&gt; applies to air conditioners or refrigerators. For heat engines, see [[Thermodynamic efficiency|Efficiency]]. Values for actual systems will always be less than these theoretical maximums. In Europe, the standard tests for ground source heat pump units use 35&amp;nbsp;°C (95&amp;nbsp;°F) for &lt;math&gt;{T_{H}}&lt;/math&gt; and 0&amp;nbsp;°C (32&amp;nbsp;°F) for &lt;math&gt;{T_{C}}&lt;/math&gt;. According to the above formula, the maximum achievable COP would be 7.8.  Test results of the best systems are around 4.5. When measuring installed units over a whole season and accounting for the energy needed to pump water through the piping systems, seasonal COP's are around 3.5 or less. This indicates room for improvement.
&lt;ref&gt;Borgnakke, C., &amp; Sonntag, R. (2013). The Second Law of Thermodynamics. In Fundamentals of Thermodynamics (8th ed., pp. 244-245). Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Air source air conditioners efficiency is derivated from "dry bulb" air temperature  used 20&amp;nbsp;°C (68&amp;nbsp;°F) for &lt;math&gt;{T_{H}}&lt;/math&gt; and 7&amp;nbsp;°C (44.6&amp;nbsp;°F) for &lt;math&gt;{T_{C}}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;According to European Union COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) No 626/2011 ANNEX VII Table 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Improving COP==
As the formula shows, the COP of a heat pump system can be improved by reducing the temperature gap &lt;math&gt;T_{hot} &lt;/math&gt; minus &lt;math&gt;T_{cold}&lt;/math&gt; at which the system works. For a heating system this would mean two things: 1) reducing the output temperature to around {{convert|30|C|F}} which requires piped floor, wall or ceiling heating, or oversized water to air heaters and 2) increasing the input temperature (e.g. by using an oversized ground source or by access to a solar-assisted thermal bank &lt;ref&gt;Thermal banks and Thermal Energy Storage, http://www.icax.co.uk/ThermalBanks.html&lt;/ref&gt; ). Accurately determining [[thermal conductivity]] will allow for much more precise ground loop &lt;ref&gt;Soil Thermal Conductivity Survey, http://www.carbonzeroco.com/field-services/soil-thermal-conductivity-testing/&lt;/ref&gt; or borehole sizing,&lt;ref&gt;Vertical Borehole Sizing, http://www.carbonzeroco.com/ground-source-heat-pumps/ground-source-heating-cooling/&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in higher return temperatures and a more efficient system.  For an air cooler, COP could be improved by using ground water as an input instead of air, and by reducing temperature drop on output side through increasing air flow. For both systems, also increasing the size of pipes and air canals would help to reduce noise and the energy consumption of pumps (and ventilators) by decreasing the speed of fluid which in turn lower the Re number and hence the turbulence (and noise) and the head loss (see [[hydraulic head]]). The heat pump itself can be improved by increasing the size of the internal heat exchangers which in turn increase the [[Heat pump#Efficiency|efficiency]] (and the cost) relative to the power of the compressor, and also by reducing the system's internal temperature gap over the compressor. Obviously, this latter measure makes such heat pumps unsuitable to produce high temperatures which means that a separate machine is needed for producing hot tap water.

==Example==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2012|comment=Note that the footnotes aren't refs}}

A [[geothermal heat pump]] operating at a &lt;math&gt;{\rm COP}_{\rm heating}&lt;/math&gt; of 3.5 provides 3.5 units of heat for each unit of energy consumed (i.e. 1&amp;nbsp;kWh consumed would provide 3.5&amp;nbsp;kWh of output heat). The output heat comes from both the heat source and 1&amp;nbsp;kWh of input energy, so the heat-source is cooled by 2.5&amp;nbsp;kWh, not 3.5&amp;nbsp;kWh.

A heat pump with &lt;math&gt;{\rm COP}_{\rm heating}&lt;/math&gt; of 3.5, such as in the example above, could be less expensive to use than even the most efficient gas furnace except in areas where the electricity cost per unit is higher than 3.5 times the cost of natural gas (e.g. [[Connecticut]] or [[New York City]]).

A heat pump cooler operating at a &lt;math&gt;{\rm COP}_{\rm cooling}&lt;/math&gt; of 2.0 removes 2 units of heat for each unit of energy consumed (e.g. an [[air conditioner]] consuming 1&amp;nbsp;kWh would remove 2&amp;nbsp;kWh of heat from a building's air).

Given the same energy source and operating conditions, a higher COP heat pump will consume less purchased energy than one with a lower COP. The overall environmental impact of a heating or air conditioning installation depends on the source of energy used as well as the COP of the equipment. The operating cost to the consumer depends on the cost of energy as well as the COP or efficiency of the unit. Some areas provide two or more sources of energy, for example, natural gas and electricity. A high COP of a heat pump may not entirely overcome a relatively high cost for electricity compared with the same heating value from natural gas.

For example, the 2009 US average price per therm ({{convert|100,000|BTU|kWh}}) of electricity was $3.38 while the average price per therm of natural gas was $1.16.&lt;ref&gt;Based on average prices of 11.55 cents per kWh for electricity [http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/epm/table5_3.html] and $13.68 per {{convert|1000|ft3|m3}} for natural gas [http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/dnav/ng/hist/n3010us3a.htm], and conversion factors of 29.308 kWh per therm and {{convert|97.2763|ft3|m3}} per therm [http://www.eia.doe.gov/kids/energyfacts/science/energy_calculator.html].&lt;/ref&gt; Using these prices, a heat pump with a COP of 3.5 in moderate climate would cost $0.97&lt;ref&gt;$3.38/3.5~$0.97&lt;/ref&gt; to provide one therm of heat, while a high efficiency gas furnace with 95% efficiency would cost $1.22&lt;ref&gt;$1.16/.95~$1.22&lt;/ref&gt; to provide one therm of heat. With these average prices, the heat pump costs 20% less&lt;ref&gt;($1.16-$0.95)/$1.16~20%&lt;/ref&gt; to provide the same amount of heat. At 0&amp;nbsp;°F (-18&amp;nbsp;°C) COP is much lower. Then, the same system costs as much to operate as an efficient gas heater. The yearly savings will depend on the actual cost of electricity and natural gas, which can both vary widely.

==Conditions of use==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}
While the COP is partly a measure of the efficiency of a heat pump, it is also a measure of the conditions under which it is operating: the COP of a given heat pump will rise as the input temperature increases or the output temperature decreases because it is linked to a warm temperature distribution system like [[underfloor heating]].

== Seasonal efficiency ==
A realistic indication of energy efficiency over an entire year can be achieved by using Seasonal COP or Seasonal Coefficient of Performance (SCOP) for heat. [[Seasonal energy efficiency ratio|Seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER)]] is mostly used for air conditioning. SCOP is a new methodology that gives a better indication of expected real-life performance, using COP can be considered using the "old" scale. Seasonal efficiency gives an indication on how efficient a heat pump operates over an entire cooling or heating season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daikin.co.uk/binaries/Seer%20fact%20sheet%20stg2_tcm511-261046.pdf?quoteId= |title=A new era of Seasonal Efficiency has begun |publisher=Daikin |date= |website=Daikin.co.uk |access-date=31 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140731084805/http://www.daikin.co.uk/binaries/Seer%20fact%20sheet%20stg2_tcm511-261046.pdf?quoteId= |archive-date=31 July 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The protest ==
On Saturday, 22 May 1971 the group met at [[Dublin Connolly railway station|Connolly Station]] in [[Dublin]] and then traveled to Belfast in [[Northern Ireland]] to purchase contraceptives, which were banned in the Republic of Ireland.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The IWLM members were divided about who should go to Belfast.

The '''cooperative eye hypothesis''' is a proposed explanation for the appearance of the [[human eye]]. It suggests that the eye's distinctive visible characteristics [[evolution|evolved]] to make it easier for [[human]]s to follow another's gaze while communicating or while working together on tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Tomasello, Brian Hare, Hagen Lehmann and Josep Call (2007). Reliance on head versus eyes in the gaze following of great apes and human infants: the cooperative eye hypothesis.

==Differences in primate eyes==
Unlike other [[primate]]s, human beings have [[human eye|eye]]s with a distinct colour contrast between the white [[sclera]], the coloured [[iris (anatomy)|iris]], and the black [[pupil]]. This is due to a lack of [[pigment]] in the sclera. Other primates have pigmented sclerae that are brown or dark in colour. There is also a higher [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] between [[human skin]], sclera, and irises. [[Human eye]]s are also larger in proportion to body size, and are longer horizontally. Among primates, humans are the only ones where the outline of the eye and the position of the iris can be clearly seen.&lt;ref name="Than" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cozolino&gt;{{cite book|last=Cozolino|first=Louis|title=The Neuroscience of Human Relationships|year=2006|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-393-70454-9|pages=447|url=http://books.wwnorton.com/books/detail.aspx?id=9329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies==
[[File:Bonobo-Head.jpg|thumb|[[Bonobo]] with dark [[sclera]]]]
[[File:Gorilla-eyes.jpg|thumb|[[Gorilla]] eyes]]
The cooperative eye hypothesis was first proposed by H. Kobayashi and S. Khoshima in 2002&lt;ref&gt;Kobayashi, H. and S. Kohshima 2001. Unique morphology of the human eye and its adaptive meaning: comparative studies on external morphology of the primate eye. ''Journal of Human Evolution'' (40) (5): 419-435.&lt;/ref&gt; and was subsequently tested by [[Michael Tomasello]] and others at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in [[Germany]]. Researchers examined the effect of head and eye movement on changing gaze direction in humans and [[hominidae|great ape]]s. A human experimenter, observed by either a human [[infant]], a [[gorilla]], a [[bonobo]], or a [[chimpanzee]], did one of four actions:
*Tilted his head up while closing his eyes
*Looked at the ceiling with his eyes while keeping his head stationary
*Looked at the ceiling with his head and his eyes
*Looked straight ahead without moving his head or his eyes

The apes were most likely to follow the gaze of the experimenter when only his head moved. The infants followed the gaze more often when only the eyes moved.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Tomasello, Brian Hare, Hagen Lehmann and Josep Call (2007). Reliance on head versus eyes in the gaze following of great apes and human infants: the cooperative eye hypothesis. Journal of Human Evolution 52: 314-320 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Than" /&gt;

The results suggest that humans depend more on eye movements than head movements when trying to follow the gaze of another. Anthropologists not involved in the study have called the hypothesis plausible, noting that "human infants and children both infer cooperative intentions in others and display cooperative intentions themselves."&lt;ref name="Than" /&gt;

==Why did it evolve?==
Studies of great ape behavior show that they are good at cooperating in situations where there is no potential of deception, but behave egotistically in situations where there are motives for deception, suggesting that their "lack of cooperativeness" is not a lack of a cognitive ability at all, but rather a necessary adaptation to a society full of deception.{{fact|date=April 2018}} This suggests that human cooperativeness began when proto-humans began to successfully avoid competition, which is also supported by the fact that the oldest evidence of care for the long-term sick and disabled are from shortly after the first emigration of hominins out of Africa about 1.8 million years ago.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

==Other hypotheses==

The cooperative eye hypothesis is not the only one that has been proposed to explain the appearance of the human eye. Other hypotheses include the proposal that white sclerae are a sign of good health, useful in [[mating|mate selection]], or that eye visibility promotes [[altruism|altruistic]] behaviour by letting people know they are being watched. The Planck institute study noted that "these hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, and highly visible eyes may serve all of these functions."&lt;ref name="Than" /&gt;

'''Critical Metrics''' was a web-based [[Recommender system|music recommendation service]]. Unlike user-driven sites like [[The Hype Machine]] and [[Pandora (music service)|Pandora]], Critical Metrics featured only expert-generated content. Aggregating reviews and playlists from over 150 publications, both print and online, the site also encompassed historical sources. The site then ranked the songs mathematically, based on the information gathered. With a methodology based in the fields of [[bibliometrics]] and [[sentiment analysis]], Critical Metrics quantified these positive citations and sentiments into indices for media playlisting and consumption.

Streaming audio and [[YouTube]] videos were presented with the original recommendations, along with the option to purchase via [[iTunes Store|iTunes]] or other online retailers. When the site was launched in April 2007, it hosted the streaming music itself. A licensing arrangement with [[Rhapsody (online music service)|Rhapsody]] removed the free music, but allowed unlimited listening and playlist-building for Rhapsody subscribers.

Critical Metrics was founded by Joey Anuff, the co-founder of [[Suck.com]] and a former [[VH1]] executive. The site was praised by [[Boing Boing]], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', and ''[[Business Week]]''. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' senior music critic [[Ann Powers]] referred to the site as her "favorite snobby top 40 station".

The term "'''death by sawing'''" indicates the act of sawing a living person in half, either [[Anatomical plane|sagittally]] (usually midsagittally), or transversely. Thus, [[decapitation]] by sawing or [[dismemberment]] by sawing are tangential sub-themes, though some ambiguous cases might be included. Death by sawing was a method of execution reportedly used in different parts of the world. Some of the reviewed examples are legendary.  At least one source states that the method was probably never used.&lt;ref&gt;''Schild'' (1997) p. 44 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
Different methods of death by sawing have been recorded. In cases related to the Roman Emperor [[Caligula]], the sawing is said to be through the middle ([[wiktionary:transversely|transversely]]).&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;''Scott'' (1995), p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In the cases of [[Morocco]], it is stated that the sawing was lengthwise, both from the groin and upwards and from the skull and downwards (mid[[wiktionary:sagittally|sagittally]]).&lt;ref name=Busnot1&gt;''Busnot'' (1717), [https://books.google.com/books?id=yiNSAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA167 pp.167–70]&lt;/ref&gt;

In only one case, in the story about [[Simon the Zealot]], the person is explicitly described as being hung upside-down and sawn apart vertically through the middle, starting at the groin, with no mention of fastening or support boards around the person, in the manner depicted in illustrations.&lt;ref name= "Geyer"&gt;''Geyer'' (1738) [https://books.google.com/books?id=o2VCAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA631 p.631]&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases where details about the method beyond the mere sawing act are explicitly supplied, the condemned person was apparently fastened to either one or two boards prior to sawing.&lt;ref name=Busnot1 /&gt;

==Archaic Age and antiquity==
===Ancient Persia===
;The legend of Jamshid
[[Jamshid]] was a legendary [[shah]] of [[Greater Iran|Persia]], whose story is told in the ''[[Shahnameh]]'' by [[Ferdowsi]]. After 300 years of blessed reign, Jamshid forgot the blessings came from God, and began demanding that he be revered as a god himself. The people rebelled, and [[Zahhak]] had him sawn asunder.&lt;ref&gt;''Osborne'' (1744), [https://books.google.com/books?id=afRSAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA179 p.179]&lt;/ref&gt;
; Parysatis
[[Parysatis]], wife and half-sister of [[Darius II]] (r. 423–405 BC) was the real power behind the throne of the [[Achaemenid Empire]]; she instigated and became involved in a number of court intrigues, made several enemies, yet had an uncanny knack for dispatching them at an opportune time. At one point, she decided to have the siblings of her daughter-in-law [[Stateira (wife of Artaxerxes II)|Stateira]] killed, and only relented from killing Stateira as well due to the desperate pleas of her son, [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes II]]. Stateira's sister Roxana was the first of her siblings to be killed, by being sawn in half. When Dareius II died, Parysatis moved quickly, and was able to have the new queen Stateira poisoned; Parysatis still remained a power to be reckoned with for years after.&lt;ref&gt;''Osborne'' (1747), [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=266&amp;id=Y9gGAAAAcAAJ p.266]&lt;/ref&gt;
;Hormizd IV
[[Hormizd IV]] ({{lang-fa| هرمز چهارم}}), son of [[Khosrow I]], reigned as the twenty-first [[Sasanian Empire|King of Persia]] from AD 579 to 590.&lt;ref&gt;''Dignas; Winter'' (2007) p.42&lt;/ref&gt; As the years went by, he was, due to his "cruelties", deeply resented by the nobility. In 590, a palace coup was staged in which his son, [[Khosrow II]], was declared king. Hormuzd IV was forced to watch his wife and one of his sons sawn in two, and the deposed king was then blinded. After a few days, the new king is said to have killed his old, blind father in a fit of rage.&lt;ref&gt;''Osborne'' (1742), [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=535&amp;id=tfJSAAAAcAAJ p.535]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thracians===
[[Thracians]] were regarded as warlike, ferocious, and bloodthirsty by Romans and Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;''Head; Heath'' (1982), p. 51, ''Webber; McBride'' (2001): "Perhaps the prospect of getting to the spoils explains Thucydides VII, 29: `For the Thracian race, like all the most bloodthirsty barbarians, are always particularly bloodthirsty when everything is going their own way", p.1&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most notorious was the king [[Diegylis]], possibly only topped by his son [[Ziselmius]]. According to [[Diodorus Siculus]], Ziselmius sawed several persons to death and commanded their families to eat the flesh of their murdered relatives. The Thracians eventually rebelled, captured him and sought to inflict every conceivable torture upon him prior to his death.&lt;ref&gt;''Diodorus Seculus'' (1840), [https://books.google.com/books?id=LFg-AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA2450 p.2450]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Rome===
;The Twelve Tables
Promulgated about 451 BC, the [[Twelve Tables]] is the oldest extant law code for the Romans. [[Aulus Gellius]], whose work "Attic Nights" is partially preserved, states that death by the saw was mentioned for some offenses in the tables, but that the use of which was so infrequent that no one could remember ever having seen it done.&lt;ref&gt;For Gellius' statement, see, ''Rosenmüller'' (1820), [https://books.google.com/books?id=dk8_AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA95 p.95]&lt;/ref&gt; Of the retained laws in the Twelve Tables, the following concerning how creditors should proceed with debtors is found in Table 3, article 6: "On the third market-day they [the creditors] shall cut pieces. If they shall have cut more or less [than their shares], it shall be with impunity (_s[in]e fraude_)." The translator notes the ambiguity of the original text, but says that later Roman writers understood this to mean that creditors were allowed to cut their shares from the body of the debtor. If true, that would constitute dismemberment, rather than sawing.&lt;ref&gt;''Coleman-Norton'' (1948))[https://archive.org/stream/thetwelvetables14783gut/14783.txt The Twelve Tables]&lt;/ref&gt;
;Caligula
This method of execution was uncommon throughout the time of the [[Roman Empire]]. However, it was used extensively during the reign of [[Caligula]]&lt;ref&gt;Suet. Calig. 27: multos [...] medios serra dissecuit - , [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html Vita Caligulae] "Many..had them sawn asunder" [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html Life of Caligula]&lt;/ref&gt; when the condemned, including members of his own family, were sawn across the [[torso]] rather than lengthways down the body. It is said that Caligula would watch such executions while he ate, stating that witnessing the suffering acted as an appetiser.&lt;ref name="Scott" /&gt;
;The Kitos War
The [[Kitos War]] occurred 115–117 AD, and was a rebellion by the Jews within the Roman Empire. Major revolts happened several places, and the main source by [[Cassius Dio]] claims that in [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]], 220,000 Greeks were massacred by the Jews; in [[Cyprus]], 240,000. Dio adds that many of the victims were sawn asunder, and that the Jews licked up the blood of the slain, and "twisted the entrails like a girdle about their bodies"&lt;ref&gt;''Gibbon'' (1776), [https://books.google.com/books?id=aLcWAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR76 Appendix, p.lxxvi]&lt;/ref&gt;
;Valens
In 365 AD, [[Procopius (usurper)|Procopius]] declared himself emperor, and moved against [[Valens]]. He was defeated in battle, and due to the treachery of his two generals Agilonius and [[Gomoarius]] (they had been promised they would be "shown favour" by Valens), he was captured. In 366, he was fastened to two trees bent down with force; when the trees were released, Procopius was ripped apart. The "favour" Valens showed to Agilonius and Gomoarius was to have them both sawn asunder.&lt;ref&gt;''Sozomen'' (1846), [https://books.google.com/books?id=lDmxf3_Ju1sC&amp;pg=PA262 p.262]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish tradition===
;Death of Isaiah
The prophet [[Isaiah]] was, according to some traditional rabbinic texts, sawn apart on orders of King [[Manasseh of Judah|Manasseh of Juda]].&lt;ref name="Warnekros"&gt;''Warnekros'' (1832), [https://books.google.com/books?id=P4hAAAAAcAAJ&amp;PA=711 p.368]&lt;/ref&gt; One tradition states that he was put within a tree, and then sawn apart; another says he was sawn apart by means of a wooden saw.&lt;ref&gt;''Du Pin'' (1699), [https://books.google.com/books?id=VzZWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA115 p.115]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian Martyrs===
;Simon the Zealot
[[File:Zersägen des Heiligen Simon.png|thumb|Illustration by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] of St. Simon sawn in two]]
Several early Christians are credited with being martyred by means of a saw. The earliest, and most famous, is the obscure apostle of [[Jesus]], [[Simon the Zealot]]. He is said to have been martyred in [[Iran|Persia]], and that the express mode by which he was executed was to be hanged up by the feet, as in the woodcut illustration.&lt;ref name= "Geyer" /&gt;
;Conus and his son
Living in the age of [[Domitian]], Conus went, after his wife's death, with his 7-year-old son into a desert. However, he then had the idea of attacking paganism, and destroyed several idols in [[Konya|Cogni]], Asia Minor ([[Anatolia]]). Caught, he and his son were tortured by starvation and fire, but they were finally put to the saw, dying while they prayed.&lt;ref&gt;''Schmauss'' (1719), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e6VMAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA69 p.69]&lt;/ref&gt;
;Symphorosa and her seven sons
[[Symphorosa]] was, allegedly, a widow with seven sons living in the age of emperor [[Trajan]] (98-117). They were commanded to pray at a heathen temple, but refusing, Symphorosa was scourged, and then with a large stone fastened to her, thrown in the river [[Aniene]]. The six eldest sons were all killed by stab wounds, but the youngest, Eugenius, was sawn apart.&lt;ref&gt;''Foxe'' (1840), [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=5&amp;id=IeLq-CNyOcIC p.5]&lt;/ref&gt; However, she may have been killed ca. 138, near the end of the reign of [[Hadrian]] (117–138).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14379a.htm Symphorosa] at the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;
;The 38 monks and martyrs on Mount Sinai
Supposedly during the reign of [[Diocletian]], a community of monks lived at [[Mount Sinai]]. One day, the "wild barbarians" (said to be inveterate robbers and even cannibalizing their own sons occasionally) decided to rob the community. But, there was nothing of material wealth there, and in their rage, the Arabs slaughtered them all, several by [[flaying]], others by sawing them with dull saws.&lt;ref&gt;''Deinl'' (1850), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MhJNAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA42 p.42]&lt;/ref&gt;
;St. Tarbula
Accused of practicing witchcraft and of causing sickness to befall the wife of the ardently anti-Christian Persian king [[Shapur II]], she was condemned and executed by being sawed in half in the year 345.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=1909 St. Tarbula]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Africa==
===Egypt===
;The monk from Montepulciano
In the 1630s, there are several reports from the [[Levant]] and Egypt that monks were killed. One of them, Brother Conrad d'Elis Barthelemy, a native of [[Montepulciano]] is said to have been sawn in two, from the head and downwards.&lt;ref&gt;''Chateaubriand'' (1812), [https://books.google.com/books?id=3uFBAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA143 p.143]&lt;/ref&gt;
; The renegade Coptic governor
Writing in 1843, William Holt Yates speaks of a governor under [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]] (r.1801–49), Abd-ur-Rahman Bey, who was said to be particularly cruel and avaricious. He was a renegade [[Copts|Copt]], and abused his position to gain hold of wealth. He is even credited with having sawed people in two. Yates further supplies the detail: "This fellow has since been assassinated-report says, with sanction and approval of the Government"&lt;ref&gt;''Yates'' (1843), [https://books.google.com/books?id=7WRCAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA123 p.123] More on this governor and his assassination in 1840 in ''Gliddon'' (1841), [https://books.google.com/books?id=YWQGAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA70 p.70-72, footnote]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morocco===
;1705 The sawing of Alcaide Melec
One of the most notorious cases of sawing as execution is that of the [[Qaid|Alcaide]] (castellan/governor) Melec under emperor [[Ismail Ibn Sharif|Moulay Ishmael]] (r. 1672–1727). The fullest description of this execution is found in Dominique Busnot's&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Dominique Busnot]]&lt;/ref&gt; 1714 work ''Histoire du règne de Mouley Ismael'', although a brief notice of the event can be found in the January 1706 edition of ''Present state of Europe''.&lt;ref name="Rhodes"&gt;''Rhodes'' (1706), [https://books.google.com/books?id=bwALAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA46 p.46]&lt;/ref&gt; In the following, the tale as told by Busnot will be given.&lt;ref name="Busnot1" /&gt;

Melec was judged as the chief rebel to be punished in a rebellion instigated by one of the emperor's sons, Mulay Muhammad. In particular, according to Busnot, the empress was incensed that Melec had personally beheaded one of her cousins, Ali Bouchasra.&lt;ref&gt;''Busnot'' (1716), [https://books.google.com/books?id=yiNSAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA167 p.66-67]&lt;/ref&gt; In September/October 1705,&lt;ref name="Rhodes" /&gt; Mulay Ismail sent for his chief carpenter and asked if his saws were capable of sawing a man in two. The carpenter answered "Sure enough". He was then given the grisly task, and before he left, he asked him whether Melec should be sawn across or along the length. The emperor said the sawing should proceed lengthwise, from the head downwards. He told, however, Boachasra's sons, they should follow the carpenter and decide for themselves how best to take revenge upon the murderer (i.e., Melec) of their father. Taking with him 8 of the public executioner's assistants, the master carpenter went to the prison where Melec was held, two of his brand new saws packed in cloth, in order to keep from Melec information of the intended manner of execution. Melec was now placed on a mule, bound with an iron chain, and led to the public square, where some 4000 of his relatives and members of his tribe were assembled. These made a "terrifying" spectacle through screaming, and clawing their faces in a public display of grief. Melec, on the other hand, seemed unperturbed, calmly smoking from his tobacco pipe. When taken down from the mule, Melec's clothes were removed, damning letters "proving" his treason was cast in the fire.

Then, he was strapped onto a board, and placed upon a sawbench, his arms and legs fastened. The executioner's team then sought to start by sawing him from the head downwards, but Boucasra's sons intervened, and demanded that one began between Melec's legs instead, because otherwise, he would die too quickly. Under the terrible screams of Melec and his relatives, thus began his execution. Once they had sawed him up to the navel, they pulled out the saw in order to commence from the other side. Melec is said to have been still conscious, asking for some water. His friends, though, thought it best to hasten his demise and shorten his sufferings, and the executioners went on, sawing him from skull to navel so he fell apart. In the process, chunks of flesh were ripped out by the saw's teeth, causing blood to splatter everywhere, thus making the execution quite unbearable to watch.

Around 300 other conspirators were [[Impalement|impaled]] alive, and another report states that in addition to these, some other 20 chief conspirators had their arms and legs sawed off, and left to expire in the marketplace.&lt;ref name="Rhodes" /&gt;
;1721 The sawing of Larbe Shott
19 July 1721, a noble descended from the [[Andalusia]]n [[Moors]], Larbe Shott was put to the saw. He had spent considerable time at [[Gibraltar]], and one of the crimes imputed to him was to have spent time in Christian kingdoms without his emperor's leave. Furthermore, he had been found guilty of defiling himself with Christian women, and often drunk alcohol. In short, he was charged as an apostate and unbeliever, in addition to being charged with having invited the "Spaniards" to invade [[Barbary Coast|Barbary]] (i.e., treason). They brought him to one of the gates in the city, fastened him between two boards, and sawed him in two, from skull and downwards. After his death, Mulay Ishmael pardoned him, so that his body could be picked up and given a decent burial at least, instead of being eaten by the dogs.&lt;ref&gt;''Windus'' (1725), [https://books.google.com/books?id=rmRCAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA156 p.156-57]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Swiss sawing
In 1757, a French officer was executed by his men in a mutiny on [[Cat Island (Mississippi)|Cat Island]] in current-day [[Mississippi]]. Three of the mutineers were eventually captured and brought to [[New Orleans]] for trial. After conviction, two of the mutineers died on the [[Breaking wheel|French wheel]]. The last mutineer, a Swiss from the Karrer regiment, was allegedly, nailed into a coffin-shaped wooden box, and it was sawed into with a cross-cut saw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cuevas, John|title=The History of a Mississippi Gulf Coast Barrier Island|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aTP8fxliBI4C&amp;pg=PA20|year=2011|publisher=McFarland|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This claim of a Swiss being sawed in two was first made by the French captain and traveller [[Jean Bernard Bossu]] in his 1768 ''Nouveaux Voyages aux Indes Occidentales'', translated into English by [[Johann Reinhold Forster]] in 1771.&lt;ref&gt;On French publication date and biographical details of Bossu, see: [http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=5922 Jean Bernard Bossu (1720–1792)] at the website: "[http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/ Encyclopedia of Arkansas History&amp;Culture]". On relevant excerpt, see ''Forster'' (1771), [https://books.google.com/books?id=QiYVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA324 p.324-325]&lt;/ref&gt;

Commenting on Bossu's general reliability in a footnote to his essay ''A Map within an Indian Painting?'', jurist [[Morris S. Arnold]] says the following: "Bossu's books contain a lot of tall tales, so one needs to be cautious about relying on him".&lt;ref&gt;''Lewis, Arnold'' (1998), [https://books.google.com/books?id=h2tGe9U39UIC&amp;pg=PA200 footnote 11, p.200]&lt;/ref&gt; Bossu claims that being "sawed asunder" was a traditional Swiss military punishment, and alleges that one Swiss mutineer actually committed suicide to avoid that punishment.&lt;ref&gt;''Forster'' (1771), [https://books.google.com/books?id=QiYVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA324 p.324]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the one who was allegedly sawed in half had his punishment as governed by Swiss military law, rather than French. An incident from 1741 (in [[Louisbourg]], Canada) shows that at that time, when two Frenchmen and a Swiss were executed, Swiss mercenary troops had been placed under French military law, rather than under Swiss.&lt;ref&gt;" Whatever the rights and wrongs of a particular case might be, the Swiss were not to be treated as an independent unit and their officers must be subordinate to the French commandant", at [http://fortress.cbu.ca/justice/Karrer.htm The Administration Of Justice At The Fortress Of Louisbourg (1713-1758)], excerpted from Greer (1976), "The Soldiers of Isle Royale, 1720-1745"&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, detailing the recorded executions in the Swiss [[Canton of Zürich]] through the 15th-18th century, Gerold Meyer von Knonau records 1445 executions in total, none of them being through death by sawing.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://de.wikisource.org/wiki/ADB:Meyer_von_Knonau,_Gerold_%28Archivar%29 Knonau]'' (1846) [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=335&amp;id=4xRMAAAAYAAJ p.335]&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1791, a [[Haitian Revolution#1791 slave rebellion|great slave revolt]] broke out at [[Saint-Domingue]], eventually leading to Haitian independence. In the process, some 4,000 white planters and their family members were massacred.&lt;ref&gt;''Censer and Hunt'' (2001), p.124&lt;/ref&gt; One of the victims was a carpenter by trade, Robert. The rebels decided he "should die in the way of his occupation" and accordingly fastened him between two boards and sawed him apart.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards (1819), [https://books.google.com/books?id=TcI-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA79 p.79]&lt;/ref&gt;

;An episode from the Crusades
In 1123, [[Joscelin I, Count of Edessa|Joscelin de Courtenay]] and [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem|Baldwin II]] were separately ambushed and surprised by a Turkish [[emir]], Balac, and made prisoners at the castle at Quartapiert. Some 50 [[Armenians]], bound by oath to Joscelin as [[Count of Edessa]], decided to free their liege lord as well as Baldwin II. Dressed as monks and pedlars, they gained entry in the town where the two nobles were held captive, and managed, through massacre, to take control of the castle. Joscelin slipped out in order to raise a force, while Baldwin II and his nephew Galeran remained behind to hold the castle. Apprised of the capture of the castle, Balac sent quickly a force to recapture it, and Baldwin II saw no possibility of holding it. Graciously, Balac took Baldwin and his nephew merely prisoners. Not so merciful was he towards the Armenians: Several of them were flayed, others buried up to the neck and used as target practice, the rest were sawn apart.&lt;ref&gt;''Collins'' (1812), [https://books.google.com/books?id=YhIwAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA220 p.220]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Assassins]], a misnomer for the [[Nizari]], an [[Isma'ilism|Ismaili]] sect, had an independent kingdom in the Levant during the age of the [[Crusades]], and were feared and loathed by Muslims and Christians alike. The Jewish traveller [[Benjamin of Tudela]], travelling the region around 1157 notes that the Assassins were reputed to saw in two the kings of other peoples, if they managed to capture them.&lt;ref&gt;''Benjamin of Tudela'' (1858), [https://books.google.com/books?id=LR09AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA10 p.10]&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of accounts exist where the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] are said to have sawn persons in two, most of them said to occur in [[Mehmed the Conqueror]]'s reign (1451–81).
;1453 conquest of Constantinople
A number of cruel excesses against the populace of [[Constantinople]] is said to have happened in the wake of the [[Fall of Constantinople|taking of the city]]. according to one rendering of the tale:&lt;ref&gt;''Salisbury'' (1830), [https://books.google.com/books?id=24BUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA225 p.225]&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|They no sooner found themselves masters of it, than they began to exercise On the inhabitants the most unremitting barbarities, destroying them by every method of ingenious cruelty.

;1460 Capture of Mystras
After the last [[Despotate of the Morea|Despot of Morea]], [[Demetrios Palaiologos]] in 1460 switched allegiance to the Turks and gave them entry to Mystras, a tale grew up that the actual [[castellan]] at the castle of [[Mystras]] was ordered sawn in two.

In the following years, inhabitants in Greece under the Venetians fought several battles in the Morea. In 1464, for example, a small city is said to have been subdued, and 500 prisoners sent to Constantinople. There, they were put to the saw, according to one account.&lt;ref&gt;''Fallmerayer'' (1836), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2xKAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA420 p.420]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1473, a Sicilian called Anthony, is said to have managed set fire to the sultan's ships at the [[Sanjak of Gelibolu]], [[Gallipoli]]. After being captured at [[Chalcis|Negroponte]], he was brought before the sultan who asked him what harm had been done to him that he performed such an evil deed? The young man answered that he simply wanted to harm the enemy of Christianity in some glorious way. The sultan is said to have ordered that Anthony should be sawn in two.&lt;ref&gt;'''a)'''For dating and place of capture, ''Lempriere'' (1825), [https://books.google.com/books?id=nHRkAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA99 p.99]" '''b)''' For interview between Anthony and sultan, see: ''von Kreckwitz'' (1654), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Py9RAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA240 p.240]"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rigas Feraios]] (1760–98), was an early Greek patriot, whose struggle for independence of Greece preceded with about 30 years the general uprising known as the [[Greek War of Independence]]. His actual manner of death has garnered many tales; [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|Encyclopædia Britannica 1911]], for example, states that he was shot in the back.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theodora.com/encyclopedia/r/constantine_rhigas.html CONSTANTINE RHIGAS]&lt;/ref&gt; Yet others state that he was strangled. Some 19th century stories report that he was sawn in two.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: ''Wigand'' (1844)[https://books.google.com/books?id=uQVIAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA307 p.307]&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, one source asserts he was beheaded.&lt;ref&gt;''Aurach'' (1859), [https://books.google.com/books?id=tKdBAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA82 p.82]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imperial China===
;Technique
The movement of a saw may cause a body to sway back and forth making the process difficult for the executioners. The Chinese overcame this problem by securing the victim in an upright position between two boards firmly fixed between stakes driven deep into the ground. Two executioners, one at each end of the saw, would saw downwards through the stabilized boards and enclosed victim.&lt;ref&gt;''Abbott'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Whether sawing as an execution method actually existed, or that cases referred to are garbled accounts of the "[[Lingchi|slow slicing]]" method of execution will remain an open question.

;Chinese mythology
Sawing people asunder is one of the punishments said to occur in [[Naraka (Buddhism)|Buddhist Hell]], and the priests knew how to make a visible spectacle of sufferings in the beyond, by commissioning artists to make paintings the populace were meant to see and reflect upon:&lt;ref&gt;''Lay'' (1841), [https://books.google.com/books?id=5T8PAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA195 p.195]&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|At a Buddhist temple in Canton, at certain seasons of the year, the court is set round with pictures, which pourtray in a fearful manner the sufferings of the dead. Some are sawn asunder; some are gored with pitchforks; some are thrown into a cauldron of boiling water; others are burnt. The artists, under the gifted instruction of the priests, succeeded in representing every sight that is terrible to the eye or revolting to the senses. In the recess at Mongha beforementioned, a few of these choice subjects were displayed with an edifying effect. The presumed existence of a place of torment brings a revenue into the coffers of the priest, who is assumed to have the power of appeasing the wrath of the judges..}}

===Segare la vecchia===
In Italy and Spain, a curious tradition of "segare la vecchia" ("sawing the old woman") was upheld on [[Laetare Sunday]] (Mid-[[Lent]] Sunday) in hamlets and towns, well into the 19th century. The custom consisted of the boys running about to find the "oldest woman in the village", and then make a wooden effigy in her likeness. Then, the wooden figure was sawn across the middle. The folklorist [[Jacob Grimm]] regards this as an odd spring ritual, in which the "old year"/winter is symbolically defeated. He also notes that a rather similar custom existed in his day among [[South Slavs|Southern Slavs]].&lt;ref&gt;''Grimm'' (1835) [https://books.google.com/books?id=OhIWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA453 p.453]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41629">[[File:Bufo periglenes2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Golden toad]] of [[Monteverde]], [[Costa Rica]], was among the first casualties of amphibian declines. Formerly abundant, it was last seen in 1989.]]
The '''decline in amphibian populations''' is an ongoing [[mass extinction]] of [[amphibian]] species worldwide. Since the 1980s, decreases in amphibian populations, including [[Population decline|population crashes]] and mass localized [[extinction]]s, have been observed in locations all over the world. These declines are known as one of the most critical threats to global [[biodiversity]], and several causes are believed to be involved, including [[disease]], [[habitat destruction]] and modification, exploitation, [[pollution]], [[pesticide]] use, [[introduced species]], and [[ultraviolet-B]] radiation (UV-B). However, many of the causes of amphibian declines are still poorly understood, and the topic is currently a subject of much ongoing research. Calculations based on extinction rates suggest that the current extinction rate of amphibians could be 211 times greater than the [[background extinction rate]] and the estimate goes up to 25,000–45,000 times if endangered species are also included in the computation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCallum |first1=M. L. |year=2007 |title=Amphibian Decline or Extinction? Current Declines Dwarf Background Extinction Rate |journal=Journal of Herpetology |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=483–491 |publisher= |doi=10.1670/0022-1511(2007)41[483:ADOECD]2.0.CO;2 |url=https://www.herpconbio.org/~herpconb/McCallum/amphibian%20extinctions.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217133741/https://www.herpconbio.org/~herpconb/McCallum/amphibian%20extinctions.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although scientists began observing reduced populations of several European amphibian species already in the 1950s, awareness of the phenomenon as a global problem and its subsequent classification as a modern-day mass extinction only dates from the 1980s. By 1993, more than 500 species of frogs and salamanders present on all five continents were in decline. Today, the phenomenon of declining amphibian populations affects thousands of species in all types of ecosystems and is thus recognized as one of the most severe examples of the [[Holocene extinction]], with severe implications for global [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frightening statistics - Amphibian Ark|url=http://www.amphibianark.org/the-crisis/frightening-statistics/|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
{{wikinews|Largest mass extinction in 65 million years underway, scientists say}}
In the past three decades, declines in populations of amphibians (the [[Class (biology)|class]] of organisms that includes [[frogs]], [[toads]], [[salamanders]], [[newts]], and [[caecilians]]) have occurred worldwide. In 2004, the results were published of the first worldwide assessment of amphibian populations, the Global Amphibian Assessment. This found that 32% of species were globally threatened, at least 43% were experiencing some form of population decrease, and that between 9 and 122 species have become extinct since 1980.&lt;ref name="stuart"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stuart |first1=Simon N. |last2=Chanson |first2=Janice S. |last3=Cox |first3=Neil A. |last4=Young |first4=Bruce E. |last5=Rodrigues |first5=Ana S.

Habitat loss, disease and climate change are thought to be responsible for the drastic decline in populations in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conservation International - Amphibians|url=http://www.conservation.org/learn/biodiversity/species/profiles/amphibians/Pages/overview.aspx|accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Declines have been particularly intense in the western [[United States]], [[Central America]], [[South America]], eastern [[Australia]] and [[Fiji]] (although cases of amphibian extinctions have appeared worldwide). While human activities are causing a loss of much of the world's biodiversity, amphibians appear to be suffering much greater effects than other classes of organism. Because amphibians generally have a two-staged life cycle consisting of both [[aquatic animal|aquatic]] ([[larva]]e) and [[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] ([[adult]]) phases, they are sensitive to both terrestrial and [[aquatic ecosystem|aquatic environmental]] effects.  Because their skins are highly permeable, they may be more susceptible to [[toxins]] in the environment than other organisms such as birds or mammals.&lt;ref name="onethird"&gt;''Science Daily'' (October 15, 2004), [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/10/041015103700.htm Amphibians in dramatic decline: Study finds nearly one third of species threatened with extinction]. Sciencedaily.com. Retrieved on September 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many scientists believe that amphibians serve as "[[Animal sentinel#Historical examples|canaries in a coal mine]]," and that declines in amphibian populations and species indicate that other groups of animals and plants will soon be at risk.&lt;ref name="onethird"/&gt;

Declines in amphibian populations were first widely recognized in the late 1980s{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}, when a large gathering of [[herpetology|herpetologists]] reported noticing declines in populations in amphibians across the globe.&lt;ref name="blaustein"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blaustein | first1 = A.R. | last2 = Wake | first2 = D.B. | year = 1990 | title = Declining amphibian populations: a global phenomenon? | url = | journal = Trends in Ecology and Evolution | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 203–204 | doi=10.1016/0169-5347(90)90129-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among these species, the [[Golden toad]] (''Bufo periglenes'') [[Endemism|endemic]] to [[Monteverde]], [[Costa Rica]], featured prominently.  It was the subject of scientific research until populations suddenly crashed in 1987 and it had disappeared completely by 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Crump | first1 = M.L. | last2 = Hensley | first2 = F.R. | last3 = Clark | first3 = K.I. | year = 1992 | title = Apparent decline of the golden toad: Underground or extinct? | url = | journal = Copeia | volume = 1992 | issue = | pages = 413–420 | doi=10.2307/1446201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other species at Monteverde, including the Monteverde Harlequin Frog (''[[Atelopus varius]]''), also disappeared at the same time. Because these species were located in the pristine Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve, and these extinctions could not be related to local human activities, they raised particular concern among biologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=J. Alan Pounds |author2=Martha L.

== Initial skepticism ==
When amphibian declines were first presented as a conservation issue in the late 1980s, some scientists remained unconvinced of the reality and gravity of the conservation issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pechmann | first1 = J.H.K. | last2 = Scott | first2 = D.E. | last3 = Semlitsch | first3 = R.D. | last4 = Caldwell | first4 = J.P. | last5 = Vitt | first5 = L.J. | last6 = Gibbons | first6 = J.W. | year = 1991 | title = Declining amphibian populations: the problem of separating human impacts from natural fluctuations | url = | journal = Science | volume = 253 | issue = 5022| pages = 892–895 | doi=10.1126/science.253.5022.892 | pmid=17751826}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some biologists argued that populations of most organisms, amphibians included, naturally vary through time.  They argued that the lack of long-term data on amphibian populations made it difficult to determine whether the anecdotal declines reported by biologists were worth the (often limited) time and money of conservation efforts.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

However, since this initial skepticism, biologists have come to a consensus that declines in amphibian populations are a real and severe threat to biodiversity.&lt;ref name="stuart" /&gt; This consensus emerged with an increase in the number of studies that monitored amphibian populations, direct observation of mass mortality in pristine sites that lacked apparent cause, and an awareness that declines in amphibian populations are truly global in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Houlahan | first1 = J.E. | last2 = Findlay | first2 = C.S. | last3 = Schmidt | first3 = B.R. | last4 = Meyer | first4 = A.H. | last5 = Kuzmin | first5 = S.L. | year = 2000 | title = Quantitative evidence for global amphibian population declines | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 404 | issue = | pages = 752–758 | doi = 10.1038/35008052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potential causes ==
Numerous potential explanations for amphibian declines have been proposed.  Most or all of these causes have been associated with some population declines, so each cause is likely to affect in certain circumstances but not others. Many of the causes of amphibian declines are well understood, and appear to affect other groups of organisms as well as amphibians.  These causes include habitat modification and fragmentation, introduced predators or competitors, introduced species, pollution, pesticide use, or over-harvesting. However, many amphibian declines or extinctions have occurred in pristine habitats where the above effects are not likely to occur.  The causes of these declines are complex, but many can be attributed to emerging diseases, climate change, increased ultraviolet-B radiation, or long-distance transmission of chemical contaminants by wind.

Artificial lighting has been suggested as another potential cause. Insects are attracted to lights making them scarcer within the amphibian habitats.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenbeis, G., 2006.

Island Press: 281-304.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baker | first1 = B.J. | last2 = Richardson | first2 = J.M.L. | year = 2006 | title = The effect of artificial light on male breeding-season behaviour in green frogs, ''Rana clamitans melanota'' | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Zoology | volume = 84 | issue = | pages = 1528–1532 | doi=10.1139/z06-142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Habitat modification ===
{{Main|Habitat destruction}}
[[Habitat]] modification or destruction is one of the most dramatic issues affecting amphibian species worldwide. As amphibians generally need aquatic and terrestrial habitats to survive, threats to either habitat can affect populations. Hence, amphibians may be more vulnerable to habitat modification than organisms that only require one habitat type. Large scale climate changes may further be modifying aquatic habitats, preventing amphibians from spawning altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7693381.stm | work=BBC News | title=Climate link to amphibian decline | date=2008-10-27 | accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Habitat fragmentation ===
{{Main|Habitat fragmentation}}
Habitat fragmentation occurs when habitats are isolated by habitat modification, such as when a small area of forest is completely surrounded by agricultural fields.  Small populations that survive within such fragments are often susceptible to [[inbreeding]], [[genetic drift]], or extinction due to small fluctuations in the environment.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

=== Pollution and chemical contaminants ===
There is evidence of chemical [[pollutant]]s causing frog developmental deformities (extra limbs, or malformed eyes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The complexity of deformed amphibians|author1=Blaustein, Andrew R|author2=Pieter TJ Johnson|journal=Front.

Some alter the [[central nervous system]]; others like [[atrazine]] cause a disruption in the production and secretion of hormones. Experimental studies have also shown that exposure to commonly used herbicides such as [[glyphosate]] (Tradename [[Roundup (herbicide)|Roundup]]) or insecticides such as [[malathion]] or [[carbaryl]] greatly increase mortality of tadpoles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Relyea | first1 = R.A. | year = 2004 | title = The impact of insecticides and herbicides on the biodiversity and productivity of aquatic communities | url = | journal = Ecological Applications | volume = 15 | issue = 2| pages = 618–627 | doi=10.1890/03-5342}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional studies have indicated that terrestrial adult stages of amphibians are also susceptible to non-active ingredients in Roundup, particularly [[Polyethoxylated tallow amine|POEA]], which is a [[surfactant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Relyea | first1 = R.A. | year = 2005 | title = The lethal impact of Roundup on aquatic and terrestrial amphibians | url = | journal = Ecological Applications | volume = 15 | issue = 4| pages = 1118–1124 | doi=10.1890/04-1291}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Atrazine has been shown to cause male tadpoles of African clawed frogs to become hermaphroditic with development of both male and female organs.

While most pesticide effects are likely to be local and restricted to areas near agriculture, there is evidence from the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains of the western United States that pesticides are traveling long distances into pristine areas, including [[Yosemite National Park]] in [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Grossi, Mark |title=Sierra Frogs Fall Silent|journal=The Fresno Bee|date=24 July 2001|url = http://www.yosemite.org/newsroom/clips2001/July/072401.html|accessdate=2008-10-02|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070618083908/http://www.yosemite.org/newsroom/clips2001/July/072401.html |archivedate = June 18, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ozone depletion, ultraviolet radiation and cloud cover ===

Salamanders and frogs that produce less [[photolyase]], an enzyme that counteracts DNA damage from UVB, are more susceptible to the effects of loss of the ozone layer. Exposure to ultraviolet radiation may not kill a particular species or life stage but may cause sublethal damage.

More than three dozen species of amphibians have been studied, with severe effects reported in more than 40 publications in peer-reviewed journals representing authors from North America, Europe and Australia. Experimental enclosure approaches to determine UVB effects on egg stages have been criticized; for example, egg masses were placed at water depths much shallower than is typical for natural oviposition sites.

These encysted life stages produce developmental abnormalities in post-metamorphic frogs, including additional or missing limbs.&lt;ref name="blaustein" /&gt;  These abnormalities increase frog predation by aquatic birds, the final host of the trematode.

A study showed that high levels of nutrients used in farming and ranching activities fuel parasite infections that have caused frog deformities in ponds and lakes across North America. The study showed increased levels of nitrogen and phosphorus cause sharp hikes in the abundance of trematodes, and that the parasites subsequently form cysts in the developing limbs of tadpoles causing missing limbs, extra limbs and other severe malformations including five or six extra or even no limbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Aquatic eutrophication promotes pathogenic infection in amphibians|doi=10.1073/pnas.0707763104|year=2007|volume=104|issue=40  |pages=15781–15786|author1=Johnson PTJ |author2=Jonathan M.

==== Chytridiomycosis ====
[[File:Chytridiomycosis.jpg|thumb|left|A chytrid-infected frog]]
{{Main|Chytridiomycosis}}
In 1998, following large-scale frog deaths in Australia and Central America, research teams in both areas came up with identical results: a previously undescribed species of [[pathogenic]] fungus, ''[[Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis]]''.&lt;ref name="Lips"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lips|first=K. R.|author2=Brem, F. |author3=Brenes, R. |author4=Reeve, J. D. |author5=Alford, R. A. |author6=Voyles, J. |author7=Carey, C. |author8=Livo, L. |author9=Pessier, A. P. |author10= Collins, J.

The disease caused by ''Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis'' is called chytridiomycosis.  Frogs infected by this disease generally show skin lesions and [[hyperkeratosis]], and it is believed that death occurs because of interference with skin functions including maintenance of fluid balance, electrolyte [[homeostasis]], [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] and role as a barrier to infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Chytridiomycosis in Native Arizona Frogs|author1=Gregory A.

Subsequent research has established that the fungus has been present in Australia since at least 1978, and present in North America since at least the 1970s.  The first known record of chytrid infection in frogs is in the African Clawed Frog, ''[[Xenopus laevis]]''.
Because ''Xenopus'' are sold in pet shops and used in laboratories around the world, it is possible that the chytrid fungus may have been exported from Africa.&lt;ref name="Weldon et al 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weldon|first=Ché|author2=du Preez, Louis H. |author3=Hyatt, Alex D. |author4=Muller, Reinhold |author5=Speare, Rick |title=Origin of the Amphibian Chytrid Fungus|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|year=2004|volume=10|issue=12|pages=2100–2105|doi=10.3201/eid1012.030804|url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/10/12/03-0804_article.htm|pmid=15663845}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Introduced predators ===
{{Main|Introduced species}}
Non-native predators and competitors have also been found to affect the viability of frogs in their habitats.  The [[mountain yellow-legged frog]] which typically inhabits the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] lakes have seen a decline in numbers due to stocking of non-native fish ([[trout]]) for recreational [[fishing]].  The developing tadpoles and froglets fall prey to the fish in large numbers. This interference in the frog's three-year [[Metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]] is causing a decline that is manifest throughout their ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Knapp | first1 = R. A. | last2 = Matthews | first2 = K. R. | year = 2000 | title = Non-native fish introductions and the decline of the mountain yellow-legged frog from within protected areas | url = | journal = Conservation Biology | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 428–438 | doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.2000.99099.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Increased noise levels ===
Frogs and toads are highly vocal, and their reproductive behaviour often involves the use of vocalizations. There have been suggestions that increased noise levels caused by human activities may be contributing to their declines. In a study in Thailand, increased [[ambient noise level]]s were shown to decrease calling in some species and to cause an increase in others.&lt;ref name="Anthropogenic sounds"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sun|first=Jennifer W.C.|author2=Narins, Peter M.|title=Anthropogenic sounds differentially affect amphibian call rate|journal=Biological Conservation|year=2005|volume=121|issue=3|pages=419–427|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2004.05.017|url=https://www.ibp.ucla.edu/Faculty/Narins/publications/pdfs/Sun%20and%20Narins%20BC.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This has, however, not been shown to be a cause for the widespread decline.

== Symptoms of stressed populations ==
Amphibian populations in the beginning stages of decline often exude a number of signs, which may potentially be used to identify at-risk segments in conservation efforts.  One such sign is developmental instability, which has been proven as evidence of environmental stress.&lt;ref name=Alfordetal2007&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alford|first=Ross A.|author2=Bradfield, Kay S. |author3=Richards, Stephen J. |title=Ecology: Global warming and amphibian losses|journal=Nature|year=2007|volume=447|issue=7144|pages=E3–E4|doi=10.1038/nature05940|url=http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/16656/1/16656.pdf|pmid=17538571}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This environmental stress can potentially raise susceptibility to diseases such as chytridiomycosis, and thus lead to amphibian declines.  In a study conducted in [[Queensland]], Australia, for example, populations of two amphibian species, ''[[Litoria nannotis]]'' and ''[[Litoria genimaculata]]'', were found to exhibit far greater levels of limb asymmetry in pre-decline years than in control years, the latter of which preceded die offs by an average of 16 years.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}  Learning to identify such signals in the critical period before population declines occur might greatly improve conservation efforts.

== Conservation measures ==
{{See also|Amphibian Ark}}
On 16 February 2007, scientists worldwide met in [[Atlanta]], [[United States|U.S.]], to form a group called the [[Amphibian Ark]] to help save more than 6,000 species of amphibians from disappearing by starting [[captive breeding]] programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=9&amp;art_id=38447&amp;sid=12249536&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20070216 | title = Bid to save frogs from killer goes worldwide | language =  | accessdate = 2007-02-22 | year = 2007 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151018180029/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=9&amp;art_id=38447&amp;sid=12249536&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20070216 | archivedate = 2015-10-18 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservation efforts have been created by several organizations such as Amphibian Conservation Alliance (ACA) and the World Wildlife Fund to help further studies on frog extinction and educate people on the issue at hand.

Areas with noticed frog extinctions, like Australia, have few policies that have been created to prevent the extinction of these species.  However, local initiatives have been placed where conscious efforts to decrease global warming will also turn into a conscious effort towards saving the frogs. In South America, where there is also an increased decline of amphibian populations, there is no set policy to try to save frogs. Some suggestions would include getting entire governments to place a set of rules and institutions as a source of guidelines that local governments have to abide by.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frogs.org/index.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091219121411/http://www.frogs.org/index.asp |date=December 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denverzoo.org/conservation/project46 ]{{dead link|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A critical issue is how to design protected areas for amphibians which will provide suitable conditions for their survival. Conservation efforts through the use of protected areas have shown to generally be a temporary solution to population decline and extinction because the amphibians become inbred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Amphibians, Reptiles, and their Conservation|last = Crump|first = M.|publisher = Linnet Books|year = 2002|isbn = |location = North Haven, CT|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is crucial for most amphibians to maintain a high level of genetic variation through large and more diverse environments.

Education of local people to protect amphibians is crucial, along with legislation for local protection and limiting the use of toxic chemicals, including some fertilizers and pesticides in sensitive amphibian areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The New Encyclopedia of Reptiles and Amphibians (2 ed.)|last = Halliday, Adler|publisher = Oxford University Pres|year = 2008|isbn = 9780198525073|location = Online|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eggshell and protein membrane separation''' is a [[recycling]] process. Nearly 30% of the [[Egg (food)|eggs]] consumed each year are broken and processed or powdered into foods such as cakes, mixes, mayonnaise, noodles and fast foods.&lt;ref&gt;Sonenklar C: Famous for Egg Waste. Research/ Penn State 1999, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The US food industry generates 150,000 tons of shell waste a year.&lt;ref name="Hecht"&gt;Hecht J: Eggshells break into collagen market. New Scientist 1999, 161:6-6.&lt;/ref&gt;  The disposal methods for waste [[eggshells]] are 26.6% as fertilizer, 21.1% as animal feed ingredients, 26.3% discarded in municipal dumps, and 15.8% used in other ways.&lt;ref name="Fermented"&gt;Daengprok W, Garnjanagoonchorn W, Mine Y: Fermented pork sausage fortified with commercial or hen eggshell calcium lactate. Meat Science 2002, 62:199-204.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many landfills are unwilling to take the waste because the shells and the attached membrane attract vermin.  Together the calcium carbonate eggshell and protein-rich membrane have no value or use.&lt;ref name="Wei"&gt;Wei Z, Li B, Xu C: Application of waste eggshell as low-cost solid catalyst for biodiesel production [electronic resource]. Bioresource Technology 2009, 100:2883-2885.&lt;/ref&gt;  The invention of an eggshell and membrane separator has allowed for the recycling of these two valuable products.

== Eggshell composition ==
{{main|Egg (food)|Eggshell}}

Chicken eggshells are made up of 95% calcium carbonate by weight and the remaining material, 3.5%, is organic matrix.&lt;ref name="Daengrok"&gt;Daengprok W, Issigonis K, Mine Y, Pornsinpatip P, Garnjanagoonchorn W, Naivikul O: Chicken eggshell matrix proteins enhance calcium transport in the human intestinal epithelial cells, Caco-Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry 2003, 51:6056-6061.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Membrane composition ==
{{main|eggshell membrane}}

== Waste eggshell uses ==
=== Pharmaceuticals ===
The rich [[calcium carbonate]] shell has been used in the application for [[Hypocalcaemia|calcium deficiency]] therapies in humans and animals.&lt;ref name="Fermented" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daengrok" /&gt;  A single eggshell has a mass of six grams which yields around 2200&amp;nbsp;mg of calcium.&lt;ref name="Vlad"&gt;Vlad: Eggshell membrane separation method. In US Patent, vol. 7534909. United States: Biova, L.L.C; 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Eggshell particles are used in toothpaste as an anti-tartar agent.&lt;ref name="Fermented" /&gt; Powdered eggshells have been used for bone [[mineralization (biology)|mineralization]] and growth.&lt;ref name="Fermented" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wei" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daengrok" /&gt;

=== Food industry ===
Recent applications of eggshells in the form of [[calcium lactate]] has been used as a firming agent, a [[flavor enhancer]], a flavoring agent, a [[leavening agent]], a nutrient supplement, a stabilizer, and thickener.&lt;ref name="Fermented" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daengrok" /&gt;  Eggshells are also used in as a calcium supplement in orange juice.&lt;ref name="Hecht" /&gt;

=== Other issues ===
Eggshells have been incorporated into [[fertilizer]]s as a [[soil conditioner]].&lt;ref name="Fermented" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Yoo"&gt;Yoo S, Kokoszka J, Zou P, Hsieh JS: Utilization of calcium carbonate particles from eggshell waste as coating pigments for ink-jet printing paper [electronic resource]. Bioresource Technology 2009, 100:6416-6421.&lt;/ref&gt;  They have also been used as a supplement to animal feed.&lt;ref name="Fermented" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Yoo" /&gt;  More recently the egg calcium carbonate particles have been used as coating pigments for ink-jet printing.&lt;ref name="Yoo" /&gt;  Powdered eggshells are also used in making [[pulp (paper)|paper pulp]].&lt;ref name="Hecht" /&gt;  Recently eggshell waste has been used as a low cost catalyst for [[biodiesel]] production.&lt;ref name="Wei" /&gt;

== Methods ==
=== Non-chemical separators ===
Joseph H. MacNeil, Professor of Food Science at [[Penn State University]], developed a machine that uses a delicate multi-bladed knife to scrape the membrane from the surface of shell fragments.&lt;ref&gt;MacNeil JH: Method and apparatus for separating a protein membrane and shell material in waste egg shells. In United States Patent (Foundation TPSR ed., vol. 6,176,376. United States: The Penn State Research Foundation; 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  This invention uses a water-based method to separate the eggshell and [[Membrane protein|protein membrane]]. The two products are processed in two streams to yield mm size particles of dry membrane and mm size particles of dried shell.

Another non-chemical separation technique utilizes steam heat, [[Abrasion (mechanical)|mechanical abrasion]], and a light vacuum to separate the hard eggshell from the protein-containing membranes.&lt;ref name="Adams"&gt;Adams: Egghell membrane separation method.  In US Patent 7,017,277, United States: ESM Technologies, LLC; 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  This invention passes shell fragments obtained from egg-breaking facilities through a series of heated augers.  Once the shell and membrane flakes reach the appropriate moisture content, the vacuum pulls them into a cyclone device.  The cyclonic action further separates the heavier eggshell flakes from the lighter membrane flakes.  This invention has been commercialized and can easily separate multiple metric tons per day, allowing for the production of valuable products including commercial volumes of [[natural eggshell membrane]] or NEM.

Levi New invented a non-chemical and non-thermal separation technique that utilizes airflow to pull egg shells through a venturi.  The material is subjected to pressure waves while passing through the venturi.&lt;ref name="New"&gt;New: Eggshell membrane separation process.  In US Patent 8,448,884 B2, United States; 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  A PulverDryer machine configured with a venturi sized to process egg shell pulverizes the shell component into fine powder and discharges the membrane as an intact dry flake material.  The two components are separated in post processing by a standard shaker screen table, then the membrane is cleaned via one of several standard washing processes, depending on end use.  Up to several tons of egg shell material can be processed per hour.

=== Dissolved air-flotation separation unit ===
The waste eggshells are put into water and then ground to separate the eggshell from the protein membrane.&lt;ref name="Yoo" /&gt;  Then the ground eggshell is placed in a separate vessel where air is injected into the water flow.  The air and water mixture causes the lighter component (protein membrane) to float and the heavier (calcium carbonate eggshells) to sink.  This unit recovers 96% of eggshell membrane and 99% of eggshell calcium carbonate in two hours.&lt;ref name="Yoo" /&gt;

=== Water and acetic acid ===
The inventor of this method is Vladimir Vlad.  The machine uses unseparated eggshells that are placed in a fluid tank, applying [[cavitation]] to separate the eggshell membrane from the eggshell. The fluid tank in this case contains [[distilled water]] and [[acetic acid]] to provide continuous processing. Also this invention has a method for collecting separated eggshells to grind them into an eggshell powder.&lt;ref name="Vlad" /&gt;

{{Politics}}
'''Emergent democracy''' refers to the rise of political structures and behaviors without [[economic planning|central planning]] and by the action of many individual participants, especially when mediated by the Internet. More recently, [[Clay Shirky]] has referred to this as "[[Here Comes Everybody|the power of organizing without organizations]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Shirky
  | first = Clay
  | authorlink = Clay Shirky
  | title = [[Here Comes Everybody: The Power of Organizing Without Organizations]]
  | publisher = The Penguin Press HC
  | page= Subtitle
  | year = 2008
  | isbn = 1-59420-153-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined to stand in contrast to more traditional forms of democracy, such as [[representational democracy]] and [[direct democracy]]. The phrase draws upon [[emergence]] theory for the idea that the simple actions of individuals can collectively create complex and unpredictable results, as when the behavior of [[termites]] results in large, efficient nests beyond the comprehension of any individual participant.

In the paper that first drew attention to the term,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|date=2003-02-13
}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joi Ito]] expresses a hope that the [[Internet]], as a large and decentralized network, will enable innovative responses by citizens to highly complex problems. From its outset, emergent democracy has been seen arising most clearly among bloggers who, as a decentralized network of writers, can provide a fuller airing and development of ideas than can the relatively limited resources of traditional media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | isbn = 0-596-10227-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of the idea point to instances in which [[blogs|bloggers]] have brought about political change by posting about issues that mainstream media had not paid much attention to. The canonical example of emergent democracy was the December 2002 resignation of [[Trent Lott]] as [[United States Senate|Senate]] [[majority leader]] after bloggers publicized his praising of [[Strom Thurmond]]'s 1948 [[Racial segregation|segregation]]ist campaign for the [[President of the United States|presidency]].&lt;ref&gt;Gillmor, pp. 44–45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shirky, pp. 61–66&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Ito had been vocal about issues with Japanese democracy, and had spoken at Davos about how broken he felt Japanese democracy was. "Afterwards, Ms. Ogata, the former UN High Commissioner for Refugees told me that I should stop ranting as a Japanese and think more about global democracy and global issues," he posted.

He organized a group effort to discuss and document the emergent democracy concept, using a term initially coined by [[Ross Mayfield]]. He announced meetings on his weblog, inviting his readers to attend a [[conference call]] that was augmented by [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] chat for posting realtime visual cues and backchannel conversation, and a [[wiki]] for gathering notes from the call. This "multimodal" approach was called a "happening" by Ross Mayfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The discussion and notes were captured in a paper that was placed on a wiki for collaborative editing and enhancement. [[Jon Lebkowsky]] edited the wiki version, and published it as a chapter in the 2005 book ''Extreme Democracy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4653">'''Empathy-altruism''' is a form of [[altruism]] based on feelings for others.

The [[social exchange theory]] states that altruism does not exist unless benefits to the helper outweigh the costs. [[Daniel Batson|C. Daniel Batson]] holds that people help others in need out of genuine concern for the well-being of the other person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aronson |first=E. |last2=Wilson |first2=T. D. |last3=Akert |first3=A. M. |year=2005 |title=Social Psychology |edition=5th |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=0-13-178686-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The key ingredient to helping is "[[empathic concern]]".  According to his {{'}}'''''empathy-altruism''' '''hypothesis'''''{{'}}, if someone feels [[empathy]] towards another person, they will help them, regardless of what they can gain from it (1991). An alternative hypothesis that exists is {{'}}'''''empathy-joy'''''{{'}}, which states a person helps because they find pleasure at seeing another person experience relief (2008). When they do not feel empathy, the social exchange theory takes control.

==Evidence==
Debate over whether other-helping behavior is motivated by self- or other interest has raged over the last 20 years. The prime actors in this debate are [[Daniel Batson]] arguing for empathy-altruism and [[Robert Cialdini]] arguing for [[self-interest]].
However, Batson recognized that people sometimes helped out of selfish reasons.  He and his team were interested in finding ways to distinguish between motives. In one experiment, students were asked to listen to tapes from a radio program. One of the interviews was with a woman named Carol, who talked about her bad car accident in which both of her legs were broken, her struggles and how behind she was becoming in class. Students who were listening to this particular interview were given a letter asking the student to share lecture notes and meet with her. The experimenters changed the level of empathy by telling one group to try to focus on how she was feeling (high empathy level) and the other group not to be concerned with that (low empathy level).  The experimenters also varied the cost of not helping: the high cost group was told that Carol would be in their psychology class after returning to school and the low cost group believed she would finish the class at home. The results confirmed the empathy-altruism hypothesis: those in the high empathy group were almost equally as likely to help her in either circumstance, while the low empathy group helped out of self-interest. Seeing her in class every day made them feel guilty if they did not help (Batson &amp; Toi, 1982&lt;!--Not in reference list--&gt;). 

===Countering hypotheses===
The authors of "Five Studies Testing Two New Egoistic Alternatives to the Empathy-Altruism Hypothesis" set out to show that empathy motivates other-regarding helping behavior not out of self-interest but out of true interest in the well-being of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Batson |first=C. D. |last2=Dyck |first2=J. L. |last3=Brandt |first3=J. R. |last4=Batson |first4=J. G. |last5=Powell |first5=A. L. |year=1988 |title=Five Studies Testing Two New Egoistic Alternatives to the Empathy-Altruism Hypothesis |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=52–77 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.55.1.52 |pmid=3418490 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Two hypotheses that counter the empathy-altruism hypothesis are addressed in this article:
*1) Empathy Specific Reward: Empathy triggers the need for social reward which can be gained by helping.
*2) Empathy Specific Punishment: Empathy triggers the fear of social punishment which can be avoided by helping.

'''Faith''' is an [[English language|English]] feminine given name derived from the word ''[[faith]].'' It became popularized when the [[Puritans]] began using it as a [[virtue name]] during the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.behindthename.com/name/faith|title=Behind the Name: Meaning, Origin and History of the Name Faith|author=Mike Campbell|work=Behind the Name|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Puritans also used Faith as part of longer phrase names, such as Be-faithful, Faithful, Faith-my-joy, and Fight-the-good-fight-of-faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.namenerds.com/uucn/listofweek/puritan.html|title=Name Nerds! List of the Week|publisher=Namenerds.com|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name is also the usual [[English language|English]] translation of the [[Greek language|Greek]] name of [[Saints Faith, Hope and Charity|Saint Faith]], an early Christian child [[martyr]] who was tortured to death along with her sisters Hope and Charity. She is known as Pistis in [[Koine Greek|Greek]] and Fides in [[Ecclesiastical Latin|Church Latin]] and her name is translated differently in other languages. 

Faith, [[Hope (given name)|Hope]] and [[Charity (name)|Charity]], the [[theological virtues|three theological virtues]], are names traditionally given to [[Multiple birth|triplet]] girls, just as Faith and Hope remain common names for [[twin]] girls. There were 40 sets of twins named Faith and Hope born in the [[United States]] in 2009, the second most common name combination for twin girls. In 2011, there were 33 sets of twin girls named Faith and Hope in the United States, the fourth most common name combination for twins.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121201174159/http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/twins.html]&lt;/ref&gt; One example were the American triplets Faith, Hope and Charity Cardwell, who were born in 1899 in [[Texas]] and were recognized in 1994 by the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] as the world's longest lived triplets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/07/garden/at-home-with-faith-hope-and-charity-285-years-young.html|title=AT HOME WITH: Faith, Hope and Charity; 285 Years Young|date=7 July 1994|publisher=Nytimes.com|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faith has been a consistently popular name for girls in the United States, ranking among the top 1,000 names since 1880 and the top 500 names since 1921. It has ranked among the top 100 names in the United States since 1999 and was ranked as the 71st most popular name for newborn girls in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssa.gov/cgi-bin/babyname.cgi|title=Popular Baby Names|publisher=Ssa.gov|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other cultures also give names in reference to religious faith. The name [[Iman (concept)|Iman]] is used by Muslims for both boys and girls in reference to faith in [[Islam]].

'''Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection''' is an idea about [[genetic variance]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 12206233 | volume=56 | title=Perspective: Here's to Fisher, additive genetic variance, and the fundamental theorem of natural selection | journal=Evolution | pages=1313–6 | last1 = Crow | first1 = JF | doi=10.1554/0014-3820(2002)056[1313:phstfa]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.498.9934&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Fisher's Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection Revisited by Sabin Lessard]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[population genetics]] developed by the [[statistics|statistician]] and [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]] [[Ronald Fisher]]. The proper way of applying the abstract mathematics of the theorem to actual biology has been a matter of some debate.

It states:

:"The rate of increase in [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] of any [[organism]] at any time is equal to its genetic variance in fitness at that time."&lt;ref name=Fisher&gt;[[R.A. Fisher|Fisher, R.A.]] (1930) ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]'', Clarendon Press, Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;

Or in more modern terminology:

:"The rate of increase in the mean fitness of any organism at any time ascribable to natural selection acting through changes in [[gene frequencies]] is exactly equal to its genetic variance in fitness at that time".&lt;ref name=Edwards&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Edwards | first1 = A.W.F. | authorlink = A.W.F. Edwards | year = 1994 | title = The fundamental theorem of natural selection | url = | journal = Biological Reviews | volume = 69 | issue = | pages = 443–474 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-185x.1994.tb01247.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The theorem was first formulated in Fisher's 1930 book ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]''.&lt;ref name=Fisher/&gt; Fisher likened it to the [[Second law of thermodynamics|law of entropy]] in [[physics]], stating that "It is not a little instructive that so similar a law should hold the supreme position among the biological sciences". The model of [[Quasi-linkage equilibrium]] was introduced by [[Motoo Kimura]] in 1965 as an approximation in the case of [[weak selection]] and weak [[epistasis]].&lt;ref  name="kimura"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kimura|first=Motoo|title=Attainment of quasi linkage equilibrium when gene frequencies are changing by natural selection|journal=Genetics|year=1965|volume=52|pages=875–890}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SinghKrimbas2000"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Singh|first1=Rama S.|last2=Krimbas|first2=Costas B.|title=Evolutionary Genetics: From Molecules to Morphology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=flmuDNNpYTIC&amp;pg=PA267|date=28 March 2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-57123-4|page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Largely as a result of Fisher's feud with the American geneticist [[Sewall Wright]] about [[adaptive landscapes]], the theorem was widely misunderstood to mean that the average fitness of a population would always increase, even though models showed this not to be the case.&lt;ref name="Provine2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Provine|first=William B.|title=The Origins of Theoretical Population Genetics: With a New Afterword|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Mj0ptluGeQC&amp;pg=PA163|date=May 2001|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-68464-2|pages=140–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, [[George R. Price]] [[Price equation|showed]] that Fisher's theorem was indeed correct (and that Fisher's proof was also correct, given a typo or two), but did not find it to be of great significance. The sophistication that Price pointed out, and that had made understanding difficult, is that the theorem gives a formula for part of the change in gene frequency, and not for all of it. This is a part that can be said to be due to natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Price | first1 = G.R. | authorlink = George R. Price | year = 1972 | title = Fisher's "fundamental theorem" made clear | url = | journal = [[Annals of Human Genetics]] | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 129–140 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-1809.1972.tb00764.x | pmid=4656569}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent work (reviewed by Grafen in 2003) builds on Price's understanding in two ways. One aims to improve the theorem by completing it, i.e. by finding a formula for the whole of the change in gene frequency, and accounting for the effects of mutations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Basener, W.F. &amp; Sanford, J.C., P.|year=2017|title=The fundamental theorem of natural selection with mutations|journal=Journal of Mathematical Biology|doi=10.1007/s00285-017-1190-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The other argues that the partial change is indeed of great conceptual significance, and aims to extend similar partial change results into more and more general population genetic models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Grafen |first=Alan |date=21 August 2003 |title=Fisher the evolutionary biologist |url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~grafen/cv/fisher.pdf |journal=[[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society|The Statistician]] |publisher=[[Royal Statistical Society]] |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages=319-329 |doi=10.1111/1467-9884.00362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to confounding factors, tests of the fundamental theorem are quite rare though Bolnick in 2007 did test this effect in a natural population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Bolnick D. I. &amp; Nosil, P.|title=Natural Selection in Populations Subject to a Migration Load|journal=Evolution|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00179.x|volume=61|pages=2229–2243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roosevelt]] called it one of the "[[Four Freedoms]]" at his [[State of the Union]], which was afterwards therefore referred to as the "Four Freedoms Speech."&lt;ref name="4FS"&gt;Roosvelt, Franklin Delano (January 6, 1941) [http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/fdrthefourfreedoms.htm ''The Four Freedoms''], American Rhetoric&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
In his speech President Franklin D. Roosevelt formulated freedom from fear as follows: "The fourth is freedom from fear, which, translated into world terms, means a worldwide reduction of armaments to such a point and in such a thorough fashion that no nation will be in a position to commit an act of physical aggression against any neighbour—anywhere in the world."&lt;ref name="4FS" /&gt;

The four freedoms of Roosevelt formed an important pillar of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] that were adopted on December 10, 1948, by the [[United Nations General Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;Alfredsson, Gudmundur &amp; Asbjørn Eide (1999) ''The Universal UN Declaration of Human Rights: A Common Standard of Achievement'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=FmuoB-BlMvEC&amp;pg=PA523 page 524], Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, {{ISBN|978-9041111685}}&lt;/ref&gt; The freedom from fear is mentioned in the preamble of the Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations, [https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml ''Universal Declarations of Human Rights'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inspiration==
In 1943 painter [[Norman Rockwell]] created ''[[Freedom from Fear (painting)|Freedom from Fear]]'', in his series of four paintings called ''[[Four Freedoms (Norman Rockwell)|Four Freedoms]]''.

It is an important concept for [[Burma|Burmese]] [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], who published a book on it in 1991 with the title ''[[Freedom from Fear (Aung San Suu Kyi)|Freedom from Fear]]''. In 1999 historian [[David M. Kennedy (historian)|David M. Kennedy]] published a book called ''[[Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929–1945]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3528">'''Gossen's Second “Law”''', named for [[Hermann Heinrich Gossen]] (1810–1858), is the assertion that an [[Economics|economic]] agent will allocate his or her expenditures such that the ratio of the [[marginal utility]] of each [[Good (economics)|good]] or [[Service (economics)|service]] to its price (the marginal expenditure necessary for its acquisition) is equal to that for every other good or service.  Formally,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial U/\partial x_i}{p_i}=\frac{\partial U/\partial x_j}{p_j}~\forall\left(i,j\right)&lt;/math&gt;
where
* &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is [[utility]]
* &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is quantity of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th good or service
* &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; is the price of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th good or service

== Informal derivation ==
Imagine that an agent has spent money on various sorts of goods or services.  If the last unit of currency spent on goods or services of one sort bought a quantity with ''less'' marginal utility than that which would have been associated with the quantity of another sort that could have been bought with the money, then the agent would have been ''better off'' instead buying more of that other good or service.  Assuming that goods and services are continuously divisible, the only way that it is possible that the marginal expenditure on one good or service should not yield more utility than the marginal expenditure on the other (or ''vice versa'') is if the marginal expenditures yield ''equal'' utility.

== Formal derivation ==
Assume that utility, goods, and services have the requisite properties so that &lt;math&gt;\partial U/\partial x_i&lt;/math&gt; is [[Well-defined|well defined]] for each good or service.  An agent then optimizes
:&lt;math&gt;U\left(x_1 ,x_2 ,\dots,x_n\right)&lt;/math&gt;
subject to a [[budget constraint]]
:&lt;math&gt;W\geq\sum_{i=1}^n \left(p_i\cdot x_i \right)&lt;/math&gt;
where
* &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is the total available sum of money
Using the method of [[Lagrange multipliers]], one constructs the function
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\left(x_1 ,x_2 ,\dots,x_n ,\lambda\right)=U\left(x_1 ,x_2 ,\dots,x_n\right)+\lambda\cdot\left[W-\sum_{i=1}^n \left(p_i\cdot x_i \right)\right]&lt;/math&gt;
and finds the first-order conditions for optimization as
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\lambda}=0&lt;/math&gt;
(which simply implies that all of &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; will be spent) and
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial x_i}=0~~\forall i&lt;/math&gt;
so that
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial U}{\partial x_i}-\lambda\cdot p_i =0~~\forall i&lt;/math&gt;
which is algebraically equivalent to
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial U/\partial x_i}{p_i}=\lambda~~\forall i&lt;/math&gt;
Since every such ratio is equal to &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, the ratios are all equal one to another:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial U/\partial x_i}{p_i}=\frac{\partial U/\partial x_j}{p_j}~\forall\left(i,j\right)&lt;/math&gt;

(Note that, as with any maximization using first-order conditions, the equations will hold only if the utility function satisfies specific concavity requirements and does not have maxima on the edges of the set over which one is maximizing.)

'''Green shoots''' is a term used colloquially and propagandistically to indicate signs of economic recovery during an [[economic downturn]]. It was first used in this sense by [[Norman Lamont (1942)|Norman Lamont]], the then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] of the [[United Kingdom]], during the [[Early 1990s recession|1991 Recession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Sparrow | first=Andrew | title=No 10 disowns minister's 'green shoots' comment | date=2009-03-18 | publisher=Guardian UK | accessdate=2009-06-26 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/mar/18/vera-baird-green-shoots}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Chancellor Lamont was criticized for "insensitivity".&lt;ref name="BBC Green Shoots"&gt;''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7828549.stm 'Green shoots' remarks defended ]'', BBC News, 14 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase was used again by [[Baroness Vadera]], former [[Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform|Business Minister]] of the UK in January, 2009 to refer to signs of economic recovery during the [[late-2000s recession]], again to criticism from the media and opposition politicians.&lt;ref name="BBC Green Shoots"/&gt; The U.S. media started to use the phrase to describe domestic economic conditions in February 2009 when in New York Times quoted [[Bruce Kasman]], chief economist at JPMorgan Chase as saying, "It's too early to get excited, but I think there are a couple of green shoots that say  we're not going down as heavily in the first quarter [of 2009] as we were in the fourth quarter [of 2008]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Healy | first=Jack | title=Data Hints As Slowing of Decline | date=2009-02-17 | publisher=NYTimes | accessdate=2009-06-21 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/17/business/economy/17econ.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federal Reserve]] Chairman, [[Ben Bernanke]], made the first public use of the phrase by a Fed official in a March 15, 2009 interview with [[CBS]] [[60 Minutes]].

{{LGBT sidebar|history}}
'''Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender''' ('''LGBT''') '''social movements''' are [[social movements]] that advocate for LGBT+ people in society. Social movements may focus on equal rights, such as the 2000s movement for marriage equality, or they may focus on liberation, as in the gay liberation movement of the 1960s and 1970s. Earlier movements focused on self-help and self-acceptance, such as the homophile movement of the 1950s. Although there is not a primary or an overarching central organization that represents all LGBT+ people and their interests, numerous [[List of LGBT rights organizations|LGBT rights organizations]] are active worldwide. The earliest organizations to support LGBT+ rights were formed in the 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

A commonly stated goal among these movements is [[social equality]] for LGBT people, but there is still denial of full LGBT+ rights.&lt;ref&gt;hoades, M. (2011). Disrupting discourses digitally for LGBT+ rights. Journal of Cultural Research in Art Education, 29, 47-64. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/1038962171&lt;/ref&gt; Some have also focused on building LGBT+ communities or worked towards liberation for the broader society from [[biphobia]], [[homophobia]], and [[transphobia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yedGAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22sexual%2Boppression%22%2B%22it+lies+at+the+roots+of+the+oppression+of+LGBT+people+as+well%22|title=Actors to Gyms|publisher=|accessdate=7 June 2015|isbn=978-0-684-31262-0|author1=Stein|first1=Marc|date=2004-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a struggle for LGBT rights today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/10758216.2015.1041840|title=Nationalism and the Struggle for LGBTQ Rights in Serbia, 1991–2014|journal=Problems of Post-Communism|volume=62|issue=5|first1=John A. |last1=Gould |first2=Edward |last2=Moe |pages=273–286 |date=30 Jul 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; LGBT movements organized today are made up of a wide range of [[activism|political activism]] and cultural activity, including [[lobbying]], [[Demonstration (people)|street marches]], [[social group]]s, [[media (communication)|media]], [[art]], and [[academic research|research]].

Sociologist Mary Bernstein writes: "For the lesbian and gay movement, then, cultural goals include (but are not limited to) challenging dominant constructions of [[masculinity]] and [[femininity]], [[homophobia]], and the primacy of the gendered heterosexual [[nuclear family]] ([[heteronormativity]]). Political goals include changing laws and policies in order to gain new [[rights]], benefits, and protections from harm."&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Mary (2002). ''Identities and Politics: Toward a Historical Understanding of the Lesbian and Gay Movement''. Social Science History 26:3 (fall 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Bernstein emphasizes that activists seek both types of goals in both the civil and political spheres.

As with other social movements, there is also conflict within and between LGBT movements, especially about strategies for change and debates over exactly who represents the constituency of these movements, and this also applies to changing education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Kitchen|first1= Julian|last2= Bellini|first2= Christine|title= Addressing Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ) Issues in Teacher Education: Teacher Candidates' Perceptions. |journal=Alberta Journal of Educational Research|volume= 58|number=3 |pages=444–460|date=November 2012|issn=1923-1857|url=https://journalhosting.ucalgary.ca/index.php/ajer/article/view/55632}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is debate over what extent lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transgender people, intersexed people, and others share common interests and a need to work together.  Leaders of the lesbian and gay movement of the 1970s, 80s and 90s often attempted to hide masculine lesbians, feminine gay men, transgender people, and bisexuals from the public eye, creating internal divisions within LGBT communities.&lt;ref&gt;Bull, C., and J. Gallagher (1996) Perfect Enemies: The Religious Right, the Gay Movement, and the Politics of the 1990s. New York: Crown.&lt;/ref&gt; Roffee and Waling (2016) discovered that LGBTIQ people experience microaggressions, bullying and anti-social behaviours from other people within the LGBTIQ community. This is due to misconceptions and conflicting views as to what entails "LGBTIQ". For example, transgender people found that other members of the community were not understanding to their own, individual, specific needs and would instead make ignorant assumptions, and this can cause health risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Parker |first1=RG |title=Sexuality, health, and human rights. |journal=American Journal of Public Health |date=June 2007 |volume=97 |issue=6 |pages=972–3 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2007.113365 |pmid=17463362|pmc=1874191 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, bisexual people found that lesbian or gay people were not understanding or appreciative of the bisexual sexuality. Evidently, even though most of these people would say that they stand for the same values as the majority of the community, there are still remaining inconsistencies even within the LGBTIQ community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=James Roffee &amp; Andrea Waling Rethinking microaggressions and anti-social behaviour against LGBTIQ+ Youth | doi=10.1108/SC-02-2016-0004 | volume=15 | issue=4 | journal=Safer Communities | pages=190–201| year=2016 | last1=Roffee | first1=James A. | last2=Waling | first2=Andrea }}&lt;/ref&gt;

LGBT movements have often adopted a kind of [[identity politics]] that sees gay, bisexual, and transgender people as a fixed class of people; a [[minority group]] or groups, and this is very common among LGBT communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/cdp/17/2/163/|title=Measuring Multiple Minority Stress|journal=Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology|volume=17|issue=2|pages=163–174|archive-url=https://archive.is/20150307132821/http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/cdp/17/2/163/|archive-date=2015-03-07|dead-url=yes|access-date=|doi=10.1037/a0023244|pmid=21604840|pmc=4059824|year=2011|last1=Balsam|first1=Kimberly F.|last2=Molina|first2=Yamile|last3=Beadnell|first3=Blair|last4=Simoni|first4=Jane|last5=Walters|first5=Karina}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those using this approach aspire to [[liberalism|liberal]] political goals of freedom and [[equal opportunity]], and aim to join the political mainstream on the same level as other groups in society.&lt;ref&gt;One example of this approach is: [[Andrew Sullivan|Sullivan, Andrew]] (1997). ''Same-Sex Marriage: Pro and Con''. New York: Vintage.&lt;/ref&gt; In arguing that [[sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]] are innate and cannot be consciously changed, attempts to change gay, lesbian, and bisexual people into heterosexuals ("[[conversion therapy]]") are generally opposed by the LGBT community. Such attempts are often based in [[religious beliefs]] that perceive gay, lesbian, and bisexual activity as immoral.

However, others within LGBT movements have criticised identity politics as limited and flawed, elements of the [[queer]] movement have argued that the categories of gay and lesbian are restrictive, and attempted to [[Deconstruction|deconstruct]] those categories, which are seen to "reinforce rather than challenge a cultural system that will always mark the nonheterosexual as inferior."&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[French Revolution]] the anticlerical feeling in Catholic countries coupled with the liberalizing effect of the [[Napoleonic Code]] made it possible to sweep away sodomy laws. However, in [[Protestant]] countries, where the church was less severe, there was no general reaction against statutes that were religious in origin. As a result, many of those countries retained their statutes on sodomy until late in the 20th century.

== History ==
{{See also|Timeline of LGBT history}}

=== Enlightenment era ===
In [[Enlightenment era|eighteenth]]- and [[History of Europe#19th century|nineteenth-century Europe]], same-sex sexual behaviour and [[cross-dressing]] were widely considered to be socially unacceptable, and were serious crimes under [[sodomy]] and [[sumptuary law]]s. There were, however, some exceptions. For example, in the 17th century cross dressing was common in plays, as evident in the content of many of [[William Shakespeare]]'s plays and by the actors in actual performance (since female roles in [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan theater]] were always performed by males, usually [[prepubescent]] [[boy]]s).

[[Thomas Cannon]] wrote what may be the earliest published defense of homosexuality in English, ''Ancient and Modern Pederasty Investigated and Exemplify'd'' (1749). Although only fragments of his work have survived, it was a humorous anthology of homosexual advocacy, written with an obvious enthusiasm for its subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Closeted writing and lesbian and gay literature: classical, early modern, eighteenth-century | first=David M. | last=Robinson | publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. | year=2006 | isbn=978-0-7546-5550-3 | page=38 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains the argument: "Unnatural Desire is a Contradiction in Terms; downright Nonsense. Desire is an amatory Impulse of the inmost human Parts: Are not they, however constructed, and consequently impelling, Nature?"

[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|thumb|[[Jeremy Bentham]], an early advocate for the decriminalisation of homosexuality.]]
Social reformer [[Jeremy Bentham]] wrote the first known argument for homosexual law reform in England around 1785, at a time when the legal penalty for [[buggery]] was death by hanging. His advocacy stemmed from his [[utilitarianism|utilitarian philosophy]], in which the morality of an action is determined by the net consequence of that action on human well-being. He argued that homosexuality was a victimless crime, and therefore not deserving of social approbation or criminal charges. He regarded popular negative attitudes against homosexuality as an irrational prejudice, fanned and perpetuated by religious teachings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham, Jeremy]], ''Offences Against One's Self'', c1785  ([http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/eresources/exhibitions/sw25/bentham/index.html full text online]).&lt;/ref&gt; However, he did not publicize his views as he feared reprisal; his powerful essay was not published until 1978.

The emerging currents of [[secular humanism|secular humanist]] thought which had inspired Bentham also informed the [[French Revolution]], and when the newly formed [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]] began drafting the policies and laws of the new republic in 1792, groups of militant "sodomite-citizens" in Paris petitioned the [[Assemblée nationale]], the governing body of the [[French Revolution]], for freedom and recognition.&lt;ref name="blasius"&gt;Blasius, Mark and Phelan, Shane (eds.), 1997. "We Are Everywhere: A Historical Sourcebook of Gay and Lesbian Politics", New York: Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-90859-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1791, France became the first nation to decriminalize homosexuality, probably thanks in part to [[Jean Jacques Régis de Cambacérès]], who was one of the authors of the [[Napoleonic Code]]. With the introduction of the Napoleonic Code in 1808, the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] also decriminalized homosexuality.&lt;ref name="vwdiou"&gt;[http://www.glbtqarchive.com/ssh/poland_S.pdf Poland]. ''The Encyclopedia of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Culture''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1830, the [https://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/leis/lim/lim-16-12-1830.htm new Penal Code] of the [[Brazilian Empire]] did not repeat the [http://www.ci.uc.pt/ihti/proj/filipinas/l5p1162.htm title XIII of the fifth book of the "Ordenações Philipinas"], which made [[sodomy]] a crime. In 1833, an anonymous English-language writer wrote a poetic defense of Captain Nicholas Nicholls, who had been sentenced to death in [[London]] for sodomy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Whence spring these inclinations, rank and strong?
And harming no one, wherefore call them wrong?&lt;ref name="blasius" /&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Three years later in Switzerland, Heinrich Hoessli published the first volume of ''Eros: Die Männerliebe der Griechen'' (English: "Eros: The Male Love of the Greeks"), another defence of same-sex love.&lt;ref name="blasius" /&gt;

In many ways, social attitudes to homosexuality became more hostile during the late [[Victorian era]]. In 1885, the [[Labouchere Amendment]] was included in the [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885|Criminal Law Amendment Act]], which criminalized 'any act of gross indecency with another male person'; a charge that was successfully invoked to convict playwright [[Oscar Wilde]] in 1895 with the most severe sentence possible under the Act.

From the 1870s, [[social reform]]ers began to defend homosexuality, but due to the controversial nature of their advocacy, kept their identities secret.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} A secret British society called the "[[Order of Chaeronea]]" campaigned for the legalisation of homosexuality, and counted playwright [[Oscar Wilde]] among its members in the last decades of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;McKenna, Neil (2003), "The Secret Life of Oscar Wilde: An Intimate Biography". (London: Century) {{ISBN|0-7126-6986-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The society was founded by [[George Cecil Ives]], one of the earliest gay rights{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} campaigners, who had been working for the end of oppression of homosexuals, what he called the "Cause". Ives met [[Oscar Wilde]] at the [[Authors' Club]] in London in 1892. Oscar Wilde was taken by his boyish looks and persuaded him to shave off his moustache, and once kissed him passionately in the [[Travellers' Club]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} In 1893, [[Lord Alfred Douglas]], with whom he had a brief affair, introduced Ives to several Oxford poets whom Ives also tried to recruit. In 1897, Ives created and founded the first homosexual rights group, the [[Order of Chaeronea]]. Members included [[Charles Kains Jackson]], [[Samuel Elsworth Cottam]], [[Montague Summers]], and [[John Gambril Nicholson]].

[[John Addington Symonds]] was a [[poet]] and an early advocate of male love. In 1873, he wrote ''A Problem in Greek Ethics'', a work of what would later be called "[[gay history]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Katz|title=Love Stories|pages=243–244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' credits the medical writer [[Charles Gilbert Chaddock|C.G. Chaddock]] for introducing "homosexual" into the English language in 1892, Symonds had already used the word in ''A Problem in Greek Ethics''.&lt;ref&gt;DeJean, "Sex and Philology," p. 132, pointing to the phrase [https://books.google.com/books?id=FJETAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q=%22homosexual%20relations%22%20inauthor%3Asymonds "homosexual relations"] (here as it appears in the later 1908 edition).&lt;/ref&gt;

Symonds also translated classical poetry on homoerotic themes, and wrote poems drawing on ancient Greek imagery and language such as ''Eudiades'', which has been called "the most famous of his homoerotic poems".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Aldrich|title=The Seduction of the Mediterranean: Writing, Art, and Homosexual Fantasy|publisher=Routledge|year=1993|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the taboos of Victorian England prevented Symonds from speaking openly about homosexuality, his works published for a general audience contained strong implications and some of the first direct references to male-male sexual love in English literature. By the end of his life, Symonds' homosexuality had become an open secret in Victorian literary and cultural circles. In particular, Symonds' memoirs, written over a four-year period, from 1889 to 1893, form the earliest known self-conscious homosexual autobiography.

Another friend of Ives was the English [[socialism|socialist]] poet [[Edward Carpenter]]. Carpenter thought that homosexuality was an innate and natural human characteristic and that it should not be regarded as a sin or a criminal offence. In the 1890s, Carpenter began a concerted effort to campaign against discrimination on the grounds of [[sexual orientation]], possibly in response to the recent death of Symonds, whom he viewed as his campaigning inspiration. His 1908 book on the subject, ''[[The Intermediate Sex]]'', would become a foundational text of the [[LGBT movements]] of the 20th century. Scottish [[anarchism|anarchist]] [[John Henry Mackay]] also wrote in defense of same-sex love and [[androgyny]].

English [[sexology|sexologist]] [[Havelock Ellis]] wrote the first objective scientific study of homosexuality in 1897, in which he treated it as a neutral sexual condition. Called ''Sexual Inversion'' it was first printed in German and then translated into English a year later. In the book, Ellis argued that same-sex relationships could not be characterized as a [[pathology]] or a [[crime]] and that its importance rose above the arbitrary restrictions imposed by society.&lt;ref&gt;''Das Konträre Geschlechtsgefühle''. Leipzig, 1896. See {{cite book|last=White|first=Chris|title=Nineteenth-Century Writings on Homosexuality|year=1999|publisher=CRC Press|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also studied what he called 'inter-generational relationships' and that these also broke societal [[taboo]]s on age difference in sexual relationships. The book was so controversial at the time that one bookseller was charged in court for holding copies of the work. It is claimed that Ellis coined the term 'homosexual', but in fact he disliked the word due to its conflation of [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]].

These early proponents of LGBT rights, such as Carpenter, were often aligned with a broader socio-political movement known as '[[free love]]'; a critique of [[Victorian morality|Victorian sexual morality]] and the traditional institutions of family and marriage that were seen to enslave women. Some advocates of free love in the early 20th century, including Russian anarchist and feminist [[Emma Goldman]], also spoke in defence of same-sex love and challenged repressive legislation.

An early LGBT movement also began in Germany at the turn of the 20th century, centering on the doctor and writer [[Magnus Hirschfeld]]. In 1897 he formed the [[Scientific-Humanitarian Committee]] campaign publicly against the notorious law "[[Paragraph 175]]", which made sex between men illegal. [[Adolf Brand]] later broke away from the group, disagreeing with Hirschfeld's medical view of the "[[Third gender|intermediate sex]]", seeing male-male sex as merely an aspect of manly virility and male social bonding. Brand was the first to use "[[outing]]" as a political strategy, claiming that German [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor]] [[Bernhard von Bülow]] engaged in homosexual activity.

[[File:Lesbiche - 1928 - D- Die freundin 1928.jpg|thumb|May 14, 1928 issue of German lesbian periodical ''Die Freundin'' (''The Girlfriend'').]]

The 1901 book ''Sind es Frauen? Roman über das dritte Geschlecht'' ([[English language|English]]: ''Are These Women? Novel about the Third Sex'') by Aimée Duc was as much a political [[treatise]] as a novel, criticising pathological theories of homosexuality and gender inversion in women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Breger | first1 = Claudia | year = 2005 | title = Feminine Masculinities: Scientific and Literary Representations of "Female Inversion" at the Turn of the Twentieth Century | url = | journal = Journal of the History of Sexuality | volume = 14 | issue = 1/2| pages = 76–106 | doi=10.1353/sex.2006.0004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anna Rüling]], delivering a public speech in 1904 at the request of Hirschfeld, became the first female [[Uranian]] activist. Rüling, who also saw "men, women, and homosexuals" as three distinct genders, called for an alliance between the women's and sexual reform movements, but this speech is her only known contribution to the cause. Women only began to join the previously male-dominated sexual reform movement around 1910 when the German government tried to expand Paragraph 175 to outlaw sex between women. Heterosexual feminist leader [[Helene Stöcker]] became a prominent figure in the movement. [[Friedrich Radszuweit]] published LGBT literature and magazines in [[Berlin]] (e.g., ''Die Freundin'').

Hirschfeld, whose life was dedicated to social progress for people who were transsexual, transvestite and homosexual, formed the [[Institut für Sexualwissenschaft]] (Institute for Sexology) in 1919. The institute conducted an enormous amount of research, saw thousands of transgender and homosexual clients at consultations, and championed a broad range of sexual reforms including sex education, contraception and women's rights. However, the gains made in Germany would soon be [[History of Gays during the Holocaust|drastically reversed]] with the rise of [[Nazism]], and the institute and its library were destroyed in 1933. The Swiss journal [[Der Kreis]] was the only part of the movement to continue through the Nazi era.

USSR's Criminal Code of 1922 decriminalised homosexuality.&lt;ref name="Healey2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dan Healey|title=Homosexual Desire in Revolutionary Russia: The Regulation of Sexual and Gender Dissent|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k_Et9nlFT2YC|accessdate=27 October 2012|date=15 October 2001|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-32233-9|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a remarkable step in the USSR at the time – which was very backward economically and socially, and where many conservative attitudes towards sexuality prevailed. This step was part of a larger project of freeing sexual relationships and expanding women's rights – including legalising abortion, granting divorce on demand, equal rights for women, and attempts to socialise housework. During Stalin's era, however, USSR reverted all these progressive measures – re-criminalizing homosexuality and imprisoning gay men and banning abortion.

In 1928, English writer [[Radclyffe Hall]] published a novel titled ''[[The Well of Loneliness]]''. Its plot centers on Stephen Gordon, a woman who identifies herself as an invert after reading Krafft-Ebing's ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis]]'', and lives within the homosexual subculture of Paris. The novel included a foreword by Havelock Ellis and was intended to be a call for tolerance for inverts by publicizing their disadvantages and accidents of being born inverted.&lt;ref&gt;Faderman (1981), p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt; Hall subscribed to Ellis and Krafft-Ebing's theories and rejected (conservatively understood version of) Freud's theory that [[same-sex attraction]] was caused by childhood trauma and was curable.&lt;ref&gt;Doan, p. XIII.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, several secret or semi-secret groups were formed explicitly to advance the rights of homosexuals as early as the turn of the 20th century, but little is known about them.&lt;ref&gt;Norton, Rictor, (2005), "[http://rictornorton.co.uk/suppress.htm The Suppression of Lesbian and Gay History]"&lt;/ref&gt; A better documented group is [[Henry Gerber]]'s [[Society for Human Rights]] formed in Chicago in 1924, which was quickly suppressed.&lt;ref name="when"&gt;Bullough, Vern, "[http://hnn.us/articles/11316.html When Did the Gay Rights Movement Begin?]", 18 April 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Ladder, October 1957.jpg|thumb|Cover of U.S. lesbian publication ''[[The Ladder (magazine)|The Ladder]]'' from October 1957. The motif of masks and unmasking was prevalent in the [[homophile]] era, prefiguring the political strategy of [[coming out]] and giving the [[Mattachine Society]] its name.]]

Immediately following [[World War II]], a number of homosexual rights groups came into being or were revived across the [[Western world]], in Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands, the Scandinavian countries and the United States. These groups usually preferred the term ''homophile'' to ''homosexual'', emphasizing love over sex. The homophile movement began in the late 1940s with groups in the Netherlands and Denmark, and continued throughout the 1950s and 1960s with groups in Sweden, Norway, the United States, [[Arcadie (French homophile organization)|France]], Britain and elsewhere. [[ONE, Inc.]], the first public homosexual organization in the U.S,&lt;ref name="before"&gt;Percy, William A. &amp; William Edward Glover, 2005, [http://williamapercy.com/pub-Comments-PercyGlover.htm Before Stonewall], November 5, 2005 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621122142/http://williamapercy.com/pub-Comments-PercyGlover.htm |date=June 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was bankrolled by the wealthy transsexual man [[Reed Erickson]]. A U.S. transgender rights journal, ''Transvestia: The Journal of the American Society for Equality in Dress'', also published two issues in 1952.

The homophile movement lobbied to establish a prominent influence in political systems of social acceptability. Radicals of the 1970s would later disparage the homophile groups for being [[Cultural assimilation|assimilationist]]. Any demonstrations were orderly and polite.&lt;ref name="matzner"&gt;Matzner, 2004, "[http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/stonewall_riots.html Stonewall Riots] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060116051051/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/stonewall_riots.html |date=January 16, 2006 }}"&lt;/ref&gt; By 1969, there were dozens of homophile organizations and publications in the U.S,&lt;ref&gt;Percy, 2005, "[http://williamapercy.com/BeforeStonewallReview.htm Before Stonewall: Activists for Gay and Lesbian Rights]" {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827185054/http://williamapercy.com/BeforeStonewallReview.htm |date=August 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a national organization had been formed, but they were largely ignored by the media. A 1962 gay march held in front of [[Independence Hall]] in Philadelphia, according to some historians, marked the beginning of the modern gay rights movement. Meanwhile, in San Francisco, the LGBT youth organization Vanguard was formed by Adrian Ravarour to demonstrate for equality, and Vanguard members protested for equal rights during the months of April–July 1966, followed by the August 1966 Compton's riot, where transgender street prostitutes in the poor neighborhood of [[Tenderloin, San Francisco, California|Tenderloin]] rioted against police harassment at a popular all-night restaurant, [[Compton's Cafeteria riot|Gene Compton's Cafeteria.]]

The [[Wolfenden Report]] was published in Britain on 4 September 1957 after publicized convictions for homosexuality of well-known men, including [[Lord Montagu]]. Disregarding the conventional ideas of the day, the committee recommended that "homosexual behaviour between consenting adults in private should no longer be a criminal offence". All but James Adair were in favour of this and, contrary to some medical and psychiatric witnesses' evidence at that time, found that "homosexuality cannot legitimately be regarded as a disease, because in many cases it is the only symptom and is compatible with full mental health in other respects." The report added, "The law's function is to preserve public order and decency, to protect the citizen from what is offensive or injurious, and to provide sufficient safeguards against exploitation and corruption of others … It is not, in our view, the function of the law to intervene in the private life of citizens, or to seek to enforce any particular pattern of behaviour."

The report eventually led to the introduction of the [[Sexual Offences Act 1967|Sexual Offences Bill 1967]] supported by [[labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP [[Roy Jenkins]], then the Labour [[Home Secretary]]. When passed, The [[Sexual Offences Act]] decriminalised homosexual acts between two men over 21 years of age ''in private'' in [[England]] and [[Wales]].&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/02/tories-out-in-force-gay-pride "From Section 28 to a Home Office float – Tories come out in force at gay march"], ''The Guardian'', London, 3 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bisexual activism became more visible toward the end of the 1960s in the United States. In 1966 bisexual activist [[Stephen Donaldson (activist)|Robert A. Martin (a.k.a. Donny the Punk)]] founded the Student Homophile League at Columbia University and New York University. In 1967 Columbia University officially recognized this group, thus making them the first college in the United States to officially recognize a gay student group.&lt;ref name="binetusa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.binetusa.org/bihealth.html|title=TIMELINE: THE BISEXUAL HEALTH MOVEMENT IN THE US|publisher=BiNetUSA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activism on behalf of bisexuals in particular also began to grow, especially in San Francisco. One of the earliest organizations for bisexuals, the Sexual Freedom League in San Francisco, was facilitated by Margo Rila and Frank Esposito beginning in 1967.&lt;ref name="binetusa" /&gt; Two years later, during a staff meeting at a San Francisco mental health facility serving LGBT people, nurse Maggi Rubenstein came out as bisexual. Due to this, bisexuals began to be included in the facility's programs for the first time.&lt;ref name="binetusa" /&gt;

{{See also|1970s in LGBT rights}}

The American Psychiatric Association removed "homosexuality" from the diagnostics manual of mental illness in 1973.

[[File:Barbara Gittings 1965.jpg|thumb|Gay equality activist [[Barbara Gittings]] picketing [[Independence Hall]] in 1965.]]
The [[new social movements]] of the sixties, such as the [[Black Power]] and [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam war]] movements in the US, the May 1968 insurrection in France, and [[Feminist movement|Women's Liberation]] throughout the Western world, inspired many LGBT activists to become more radical,&lt;ref name="matzner" /&gt; and the [[Gay Liberation]] movement emerged towards the end of the decade. This new radicalism is often attributed to the [[Stonewall riots]] of 1969, when a group of gay men, lesbians, and drag queens at a bar in [[New York City|New York]] resisted a police raid.&lt;ref name="when" /&gt;

Immediately after Stonewall, such groups as the [[Gay Liberation Front]] (GLF) and the [[Gay Activists' Alliance]] (GAA) were formed. Their use of the word ''[[gay]]'' represented a new unapologetic defiance—as an antonym for ''straight'' ("respectable sexual behaviour"), it encompassed a range of non-normative sexualities and sought ultimately to free the bisexual potential in everyone, rendering obsolete the categories of homosexual and heterosexual.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dennis Altman|Altman, D.]] (1971).

Chapters of the GLF were established across the U.S. and in other parts of the Western world. The [[Front Homosexuel d'Action Révolutionnaire]] was formed in 1971 by lesbians who split from the [[Mouvement Homophile de France]].

The [[Gay liberation|Gay Liberation]] movement overall, like the gay community generally and historically, did not welcome transgender individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transgender History : the roots of today's revolution|last=Stryker|first=Susan|publisher=Seal Press|year=2018|isbn=9781580056892|edition= Second |location=New York, NY|pages=68, 77, 110|oclc=990183211}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GLF allowed but was not inclusive toward transgender people from its creation, and the GAA specifically excluded transgender people from its agenda, mission and activism. Transgender communities formed their own organizations, including STAR ([[Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries]]), [[Queens Liberation Front|Queen's Liberation Front]] (QLF), and the Transsexual Activist Organization. [[Sylvia Rivera]] and [[Marsha P. Johnson]] founded STAR in 1970 to provide transgender street kids with a free &amp; safe place to live, food, clothing, and an education. QLF was founded by [[Lee Brewster]] and Bunny Eisenhower to combat the erasure of drag and transgender visibility in the first LGBT pride march, demonstrating how quickly and fully the gay liberation movement excluded transgender activists despite their key role in the Stonewall Riots and previous LGBTQ activism. TAO, founded by Angela K. Douglas in 1970, was the first international [[grassroots]] transgender community organization, and is known for publishing the ''Moonshadow'' and ''Mirage'' newsletters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transgender History : the roots of today's revolution|last=Stryker|first=Susan|publisher=Seal Press|year=2018|isbn=9781580056892|edition= Second |location=New York, NY|pages=110–112|oclc=990183211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bisexual activist [[Brenda Howard]] is known as the "Mother of Pride" for her work in coordinating the first [[pride parade|LGBT pride march]]; the first [[Christopher Street Liberation Day|Christopher Street Liberation Day March]] eventually occurred in New York on June 27, 1970.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transgender History : the roots of today's revolution|last=Stryker|first=Susan|publisher=Seal Press|year=2018|isbn=9781580056892|edition= Second |location=New York, NY|pages=111|oclc=990183211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard also originated the idea for a week-long series of events around [[pride parade|Pride Day]]  which became the genesis of the annual [[Gay pride|LGBT Pride celebrations]] that are now held around the world every June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thirteen.org/pressroom/release.php?get=2475 |title=Channel 13/WNET Out! 2007: Women In the Movement|publisher=WNET}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.queerty.com/the-gay-pride-issue-20070618/ |title=The Gay Pride Issue|date=Jun 18, 2007 |last=Belonsky|first=Andrew|work=Queerty}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Howard along with bisexual activist [[Stephen Donaldson (activist)|Robert A.

One of the values of the movement was [[gay pride]]. Within weeks of the Stonewall Riots, Craig Rodwell, proprietor of the [[Oscar Wilde Bookshop|Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookshop]] in lower Manhattan, persuaded the Eastern Regional Conference of Homophile Organizations (ERCHO) to replace the Fourth of July Annual Reminder at Independence Hall in Philadelphia with a first commemoration of the Stonewall Riots. Liberation groups, including the Gay Liberation Front, Queens, the Gay Activists Alliance, Radicalesbians, and Street Transvestites Action Revolutionaries (STAR) all took part in the first Gay Pride Week. Los Angeles held a big parade on the first Gay Pride Day. Smaller demonstrations were held in San Francisco, Chicago, and Boston.

[[File:Ink glf cover.jpg|thumb|150px|The 1971 [[Gay Liberation Front|GLF]] cover version of ''Ink'' magazine, printed in London.]]

In the United Kingdom the GLF had its first meeting in the basement of the [[London School of Economics]] on 13 October 1970. [[Bob Mellors]] and Aubrey Walter had seen the effect of the GLF in the United States and created a parallel movement based on revolutionary politics and alternative lifestyle.&lt;ref name=outrage-p2&gt;{{harvnb|Lucas|1998|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1971, the UK GLF was recognized as a political movement in the national press, holding weekly meetings of 200 to 300 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=An Alternative to Sexual Shame: Impact of the new militancy among homosexual groups|publisher=The Times|author=Victoria Brittain|date=28 August 1971|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GLF Manifesto was published, and a series of high-profile direct actions, were carried out.&lt;ref name=DANGO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dango.bham.ac.uk/record_details.asp?id=2896&amp;recordType=ngo |title=Gay Liberation Front (GLF) |publisher=Database of Archives of Non-Government Organisations |accessdate=2009-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disruption of the opening of the 1971 [[Nationwide Festival of Light|Festival of Light]] was the best organised of [[UK Gay Liberation Front 1971 Festival of Light action|GLF action]]. The Festival of Light, whose leading figures included [[Mary Whitehouse]], met at [[Westminster Central Hall|Methodist Central Hall]].

Easter 1972 saw the Gay Lib annual conference held in the Guild of Undergraduates Union (students union) building at the [[University of Birmingham]].&lt;ref name="gaybrum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gaybirminghamremembered.co.uk/topics/GLF%20National%20Conference|title=Gay Birmingham Remembered – The Gay Birmingham History Project|publisher=[[Birmingham LGBT Community Trust]]|accessdate=3 October 2012|quote=Birmingham hosted the Gay Liberation Front annual conference in 1972, at the chaplaincy at Birmingham University Guild of Students.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1974, internal disagreements had led to the movement's splintering. Organizations that spun off from the movement included the [[London Lesbian and Gay Switchboard]], ''[[Gay News]]'', and [[Gay's the Word (bookshop)|Icebreakers]]. The GLF Information Service continued for a few further years providing gay related resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lucas|1998|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; GLF branches had been set up in some provincial British towns (e.g., Bradford, Bristol, Leeds, and Leicester) and some survived for a few years longer. The Leicester group founded by Jeff Martin was noted for its involvement in the setting up of the local "Gayline", which is still active today and has received funding from the [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]]. They also carried out a high-profile campaign against the local paper, the ''[[Leicester Mercury]]'', which refused to advertise Gayline's services at the time.&lt;ref&gt;''Gay News'' (1978) No. 135; ''Peace News'' (13 January 1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1970 activists protested the classification of homosexuality as a mental illness by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] in their [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]], and in 1974 it was replaced with a category of "sexual orientation disturbance" then "ego-dystonic homosexuality," which was also deleted, although "gender identity disorder" (a term used for [[Gender dysphoria]]) remains.

In 1972, [[Sweden]] became the first country in the world to allow people who were transsexual by [[legislation]] to surgically change their sex and provide free [[hormone replacement therapy (male-to-female)|hormone replacement therapy]]. Sweden also permitted the age of consent for same-sex partners to be at age 15, making it equal to heterosexual couples.&lt;ref name=RFSU&gt;{{cite web|author=''Hanna Jedvik'' |url=http://www.rfsu.se/lagen_om_konsbyte_ska_utredas.asp |title=Lagen om könsbyte ska utredas |publisher=''RFSU'' |accessdate=24 June 2007 |date=5 March 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012000954/http://www.rfsu.se/lagen_om_konsbyte_ska_utredas.asp |archivedate=12 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, LGBT groups were established in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;「オトコノコのためのボーイフレンド」（1986）&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:ja:LGBTの社会運動#日本におけるLGBTの社会運動|LGBT social movements in Japan]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, [[:ja:東郷健|Ken Togo]] ran for the Upper House election.

[[Bisexual American history|Bisexuals]] became more visible in the LGBT rights movement in the 1970s. In 1972 a Quaker group, the Committee of Friends on Bisexuality, issued the "Ithaca Statement on Bisexuality" supporting bisexuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bimedia.org/1984/june-1972-the-ithaca-statement/ |title=BiMedia – Bisexual News &amp; Opinion from BiMedia.org |publisher= |accessdate=7 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015231948/http://bimedia.org/1984/june-1972-the-ithaca-statement/ |archivedate=15 October 2015 |df= |date=2012-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|The Statement, which may have been "the first public declaration of the bisexual movement" and "was certainly the first statement on bisexuality issued by an American religious assembly," appeared in the Quaker ''[[Friends Journal]]'' and ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'' in 1972.&lt;ref name=donaldson&gt;{{cite book | last = Donaldson | first = Stephen | year = 1995 | contribution = The Bisexual Movement's Beginnings in the 70s: A Personal Retrospective | pages = 31–45 | editor-last = Tucker | editor-first = Naomi | title = Bisexual Politics: Theories, Queries, &amp; Visions | place = New York | publisher = Harrington Park Press | isbn = 978-1-56023-869-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=highleyman&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.camprehoboth.com/issue07_11_03/pastout.htm |title=PAST Out: What is the history of the bisexual movement? |accessdate=2008-03-18 |last=Highleyman |first=Liz |date=2003-07-11 |work=LETTERS From CAMP Rehoboth |volume=13 |number=8 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531051440/http://www.camprehoboth.com/issue07_11_03/pastout.htm |archivedate=2008-05-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Robert|title=Quakers 'come out' at conference|journal=The Advocate|date=1972-08-02|issue=91|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; }} In that same year the [[National Bisexual Liberation Group]] formed in New York.&lt;ref name="ucc.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucc.org/lgbt/lgbt-history-timeline.html|title=LGBT History Timeline|work=United Church of Christ|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1976 the San Francisco Bisexual Center opened.&lt;ref name="ucc.org" /&gt;

From the anarchist Gay Liberation movement of the early 1970s arose a more [[reformism|reformist]] and single-issue Gay Rights movement, which portrayed gays and lesbians as a [[minority group]] and used the language of civil rights—in many respects continuing the work of the homophile period.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, S. (1999). ''Gay and lesbian movements in the United States: Dilemmas of identity, diversity, and political strategy''. in B. D. Adam, J. Duyvendak, &amp; A. Krouwel (Eds.), "The global emergence of gay and lesbian politics" (pp. 30–90).

''Leftist Sexual Politics and Homosexuality: A Historical Overview'', Journal of Homosexuality. New York: Sep 30, 1995. Vol.29, Iss. 2/3&lt;/ref&gt;

Gay and lesbian rights advocates argued that one's sexual orientation does not reflect on one's gender; that is, "you can be a man and desire a man... without any implications for your gender identity as a man," and the same is true if you are a woman.&lt;ref&gt;David Valentine, "'I Know What I Am': The Category 'Transgender' in the Construction of Contemporary U.S. American Conceptions of Gender and Sexuality" (Ph.D. diss., New York University, 2000), p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; Gays and lesbians were presented as identical to heterosexuals in all ways but private sexual practices, and butch "bar dykes" and flamboyant "street queens" were seen as negative stereotypes of lesbians and gays. Veteran activists such as [[Sylvia Rivera]] and [[Beth Elliot]] were sidelined or expelled because they were transgender.

In 1974, [[Maureen Colquhoun]] came out as the first Lesbian [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in the UK. When elected she was married in a heterosexual marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.totalpolitics.com/print/1783/where-are-they-now-maureen-colquhoun.thtml |title=Where are they now: Maureen Colquhoun |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214160313/http://www.totalpolitics.com/print/1783/where-are-they-now-maureen-colquhoun.thtml |archivedate=2013-12-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, the groundbreaking film portraying homosexual gay icon [[Quentin Crisp]]'s life, [[The Naked Civil Servant (film)|The Naked Civil Servant]] was transmitted by [[Thames Television]] for the British Television channel [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]]. The British journal [[Gay Left]] also began publication.&lt;ref name="Knitting Circle"&gt;[http://knittingcircle.org.uk/gayleftcollective.html The Knitting Circle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070114112010/http://knittingcircle.org.uk/gayleftcollective.html |date=2007-01-14 }} – 'Gay Left Collective'&lt;/ref&gt; After [[British Home Stores]] sacked an openly gay trainee Tony Whitehead, a national campaign subsequently picketed their stores in protest.

In 1977, [[Harvey Milk]] was elected to the [[San Francisco Board of Supervisors]] becoming the first openly gay man in the United States elected to public office.  Milk was assassinated by a former city supervisor [[Dan White]] in 1978.

In 1977, a former Miss America contestant and orange juice spokesperson, [[Anita Bryant]], began a campaign "Save Our Children," in Dade County, Florida (greater Miami), which proved to be a major set-back in the Gay Liberation movement. Essentially, she established an organization which put forth an amendment to the laws of the county which resulted in the firing of many public school teachers on the suspicion that they were homosexual.

In 1979, a number of people in [[Sweden]] called in sick with a case of ''being homosexual,'' in protest of homosexuality being classified as an illness.  This was followed by an activist occupation of the main office of the [[National Board of Health and Welfare (Sweden)|National Board of Health and Welfare]]. Within a few months, Sweden became the first country in the world to remove homosexuality as an illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.quistbergh.se/view/514 |language=Swedish |title=Jag känner mig lite homosexuell idag |trans-title=I feel a little gay today |accessdate=12 December 2009 |year=2001 |first=Frederick Quist |last=Bergh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lesbian feminism]], which was most influential from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s, encouraged women to direct their energies toward other women rather than men, and advocated lesbianism as the logical result of feminism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adrienne Rich|Rich, A]]. (1980). ''[[Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence]]''. Signs, 5, 631–660.&lt;/ref&gt; As with Gay Liberation, this understanding of the lesbian potential in all women was at odds with the minority-rights framework of the Gay Rights movement. Many women of the Gay Liberation movement felt frustrated at the domination of the movement by men and formed separate organisations; some who felt gender differences between men and women could not be resolved developed "[[lesbian separatism]]," influenced by writings such as [[Jill Johnston]]'s 1973 book ''Lesbian Nation''. Organizers at the time focused on this issue. [[Diane Felix]], also known as DJ Chili D in the Bay Area club scene, is a Latino American lesbian once joined the Latino American queer organization GALA. She was known for creating entertainment spaces specifically for queer women, especially in Latino American community. These places included gay bars in San Francisco such as A Little More and Colors.&lt;ref&gt;Cassell, Heather. "Music's the life for Chili D." Bay Area Reporter. BAR Media Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Disagreements between different political philosophies were, at times, extremely heated, and became known as the [[lesbian sex wars]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/lesbian_sex_wars.html Lesbian Sex Wars] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060321044928/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/lesbian_sex_wars.html |date=2006-03-21 }}, article by Elise Chenier from GLBTQ encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt; clashing in particular over views on [[sadomasochism]], [[prostitution]] and [[Transsexualism|transsexuality]]. The term "gay" came to be more strongly associated with homosexual males.

In Canada, the coming into effect of [[Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 15]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] in 1985 saw a shift in the gay rights movement in Canada, as Canadian gays and lesbians moved from liberation to litigious strategies. Premised on Charter protections and on the notion of the immutability of homosexuality, judicial rulings rapidly advanced rights, including those that compelled the Canadian government to legalize same-sex marriage. It has been argued that while this strategy was extremely effective in advancing the safety, dignity and equality of Canadian homosexuals, its emphasis of sameness came at the expense of difference and may have undermined opportunities for more meaningful change.&lt;ref&gt;Lehman, M.  (2005). ''Getting Gay Rights Straight''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Segal]], often referred to as the dean of American gay journalism, disrupted the CBS evening news with [[Walter Cronkite]] in 1973, an event covered in newspapers across the country and viewed by 60% of American households, many seeing or hearing about homosexuality for the first time.

Another setback in the United States occurred in 1986, when the US Supreme Court upheld a Georgia anti-sodomy law in the case ''[[Bowers v. Hardwick]]''.  (This ruling would be overturned two decades later in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]).

=====AIDS epidemic=====
Some historians posit that a new era of the gay rights movement began in the 1980s with the emergence of [[AIDS]], which decimated the leadership and shifted the focus for many.&lt;ref name="before" /&gt; This era saw a resurgence of militancy with [[direct action]] groups like [[AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power]] (ACT UP), formed in 1987, as well as its offshoots [[Queer Nation]] (1990) and the [[Lesbian Avengers]] (1992). Some younger activists, seeing ''gay and lesbian'' as increasingly normative and politically conservative, began using ''[[queer]]'' as a defiant statement of all [[sexual minority|sexual minorities]] and [[gender variant]] people—just as the earlier liberationists had done with ''gay''. Less confrontational terms that attempt to reunite the interests of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people also became prominent, including various [[Acronym and initialism|acronyms]] like ''[[LGBT]]'', ''LGBTQ'', and ''LGBTI'', where the ''Q'' and ''I'' stand for ''[[queer]]'' or ''[[Questioning (sexuality and gender)|questioning]]'' and ''[[intersex]]'', respectively.

====="The Overhauling of Straight America"=====
A 1987 essay titled "The Overhauling of Straight America", by [[Marshall Kirk]] and Hunter Madsen (writing as Erastes Pill),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |title=The Overhauling of Straight America |url=http://library.gayhomeland.org/0018/EN/EN_Overhauling_Straight.htm |author=Kirk, Marshall and Pill, Erastes (pseud.) |date=1987 |publisher=Guide Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; lays out a six-point plan for a campaign, which was first published in ''Guide'' magazine. They argued that gays must portray themselves in a positive way to straight America, and that the main aim of making homosexuality acceptable could be achieved by getting Americans "to think that it is just another thing, with a shrug of their shoulders". Then "your battle for legal and social rights is virtually won". The pair developed their argument in the 1989 book ''"After the Ball: How America Will Conquer Its Fear and Hatred of Gays in the '90s."''  The book outlined a public relations strategy for the LGBT movement. It argues that after the [[gay liberation]] phase of the 1970s and 1980s, gay rights groups should adopt more professional public relations techniques to convey their message. After its publication Kirk appeared in the pages of ''Newsweek'', ''Time'' and ''The Washington Post''. The book is often critically described by social conservatives such as [[Focus on the Family]] as important to the success of the LGBT Movement in the 90's and as part of an alleged "homosexual agenda".&lt;ref name="osten"&gt;{{Citation

We must, in addition, take every advantage we can to include public service announcements and paid advertisements, and to cultivate reporters and editors of newspapers, radio, and television. To help facilitate this we need national media workshops to train our leaders. And we must encourage our gay and lesbian press to increase coverage of the national process. Our media efforts are fundamental to the full acceptance of us in American life. But they are also a way for us to increase the funding of our movement. A media campaign costs money, but ultimately it may be one of our most successful fund-raising devices.}} 
The statement also called for an annual planning conference "to help set and modify our national agenda."&lt;ref name="warrentonpaper"/&gt; The [[Human Rights Campaign]] lists this event as a milestone in gay history and identifies it as where [[National Coming Out Day]] originated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.hrc.org/resources/the-history-of-coming-out | publisher=Human Rights Campaign | title = The History of Coming Out | date=2017-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 24, 1994, the first Gay Pride march was celebrated in Asia in the Philippines. In the Middle East, LGBT organizations remain illegal, and LGBT rights activists face extreme opposition from the state.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} The 1990s also saw the emergence of many LGBT youth movements and organizations such as LGBT youth centers, [[gay-straight alliance]]s in high schools, and youth-specific activism, such as the [[National Day of Silence]]. Colleges also became places of LGBT activism and support for activists and LGBT people in general, with many colleges opening LGBT centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegeequalityindex.org/list-colleges-lgbt-center |title=List of Colleges with a LGBT Center |website=College Equality Index |date= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726161842/http://www.collegeequalityindex.org/list-colleges-lgbt-center |archivedate=2014-07-26 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1990s also saw a rapid push of the [[transgender]] movement, while at the same time a "sidelining of the identity of those who are transsexual." In the English-speaking world, [[Leslie Feinberg]] published ''Transgender Liberation: A Movement Whose Time Has Come'' in 1992. Gender-variant peoples across the globe also formed minority rights movements. [[Hijra (South Asia)|Hijra]] activists campaigned for recognition as a [[third gender|third sex]] in India and [[Travesti]] groups began to organize against police brutality across [[Latin America]] while activists in the [[United States]] formed direct-confrontation groups such as the [[Transexual Menace]].

In 2003, in the case ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] struck down [[sodomy laws]] in fourteen states, making consensual homosexual sex legal in all 50 states, a significant step forward in LGBT activism and one that had been fought for by activists since the inception of modern LGBT social movements.&lt;ref&gt;Cordova, Jeanne, ''When We Were Outlaws'' (2011) p 51-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 6 to 9 November 2006, [[The Yogyakarta Principles]] on application of [[international human rights law]] in relation to [[sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]] was adopted by an international meeting of 29 specialists, the [[International Commission of Jurists]] and the [[International Service for Human Rights]].
The [[UN declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity]] was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on 13 December 2008.

On 22 October 2009, the assembly of the [[Church of Sweden]], voted strongly in favour of giving its blessing to homosexual couples,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Synod opened on same-sex marriages |url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/kyrkomotet-oppnade-for-homovigslar-1.979744 |newspaper=DN.se |date=22 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091226085746/http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/kyrkomotet-oppnade-for-homovigslar-1.979744 |archivedate=December 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including the use of the term marriage, ("matrimony").

The 1993 "Don't ask, don't tell" law, forbidding homosexual people from serving openly in the United States military, was repealed in 2010. This meant that gays and lesbians could now serve openly in the military without any fear of being discharged because of their sexual orientation. In 2012, the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]]'s [[Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity]] issued a regulation to prohibit discrimination in federally-assisted housing programs.  The new regulations ensure that the Department's core housing programs are open to all eligible persons, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.

In early 2014 a series of protests organized by [[Add The Words, Idaho]] and former state senator [[Nicole LeFavour]], some including [[civil disobedience]] and concomitant arrests,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ktvb.com/home/Lawyers-donating-their-time-to-defend-Add-the-Words-protesters-243617221.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140228004629/http://www.ktvb.com/home/Lawyers-donating-their-time-to-defend-Add-the-Words-protesters-243617221.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=28 February 2014 |title=Lawyers donating their time to defend 'Add the Words' protesters |author=KTVB, KTVB.COM |date=4 February 2014 |work=KTVB |accessdate=7 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; took place in [[Boise, Idaho]] which advocated adding the words "sexual orientation" and "gender identity" to the state's Human Rights act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/02/03/gay-rights-activists-arrested/5186171/|title=Dozens of gay rights activists arrested in Idaho|author=AP|date=3 February 2014|work=USA TODAY|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idahostatesman.com/2014/02/23/3045530/idaho-gay-friendly-anti-gay-neutral.html|title=Boise, Meridian, Nampa, Caldwell news by Idaho Statesman|publisher=|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idahostatesman.com/2014/02/04/3008121/popkey-dignified-and-resolute.html|title=Boise, Meridian, Nampa, Caldwell news by Idaho Statesman|publisher=|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 26, 2015, in ''[[Obergefell v.

[[Eric Rofes]] author of the book, ''A Radical Rethinking of Sexuality and Schooling: Status Quo or Status Queer?'', argues that the inclusion of teachings on [[homosexuality]] in public schools will play an important role in transforming public ideas about lesbian and gay individuals.&lt;ref name="Rofes"&gt;Rofes, Eric E. "Chapter 2: Candy from Strangers: Queer Teachers and the (Im)Moral Development of Children." A Radical Rethinking of Sexuality and Schooling: Status Quo or Status Queer. Ed. Eric E. Rofes. Lanham, MD: Rowman and Littlefield, 2005. 15–37. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a former teacher in the public school system, Rofes recounts how he was fired from his teaching position after making the decision to come out as gay. As a result of the stigma that he faced as a gay teacher he emphasizes the necessity of the public to take [[political radicalism|radical]] approaches to making significant changes in public attitudes about homosexuality.&lt;ref name="Rofes" /&gt; According to Rofes, radical approaches are grounded in the belief that "something fundamental needs to be transformed for authentic and sweeping changes to occur."The radical approaches proposed by Rofes have been met with strong opposition from [[LGBT rights opposition|anti-gay rights]] activists such as [[John Briggs (politician)|John Briggs]]. Former [[California]] senator, John Briggs proposed [[Briggs Initiative|Proposition 6]], a [[ballot initiative]] that would require that all California state public schools fire any gay or lesbian teachers or counselors, along with any faculty that displayed support for gay rights in an effort to prevent what he believe to be " the corruption of the children's minds".&lt;ref name="Fetner"&gt;Fetner, Tina. 2008. How the Religious Rights Shaped Lesbian and Gay Activism. University of Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The exclusion of homosexuality from the sexual education curriculum, in addition to the absence of sexual counseling programs in public schools, has resulted in increased feelings of isolation and alienation for gay and lesbian students who desire to have gay counseling programs that will help them come to terms with their sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Rofes" /&gt; Eric Rofes founder of youth homosexual programs, such as [[Out There (youth program)|Out There]] and [[Committee for Gay Youth]], stresses the importance of having support programs that help youth learn to identify with their sexual orientation.

[[David Campos]], author of the book, ''Sex, Youth, and Sex Education: A Reference Handbook'', illuminates the argument proposed by proponents of sexual education programs in public schools. Many gay rights supporters argue that teachings about the diverse sexual orientations that exist outside of [[heterosexuality]] are pertinent to creating students that are well informed about the world around them. However, Campos also acknowledges that the sex education curriculum alone cannot teach youth about factors associated with sexual orientation but instead he suggests that schools implement policies that create safe school learning environments and foster support for LGBT youth.&lt;ref name="Campos"&gt;{{cite book|author=Campos, David|title=Sex, Youth, and Sex Education: A Reference Handbook|location=Washington, D.C|publisher=Library of Congress Cataloging|year=2002|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FKmVUwbUlGgC&amp;printsec=copyright#v=onepage|isbn=978-1-57607-776-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is his belief that schools that provide unbiased, factual information about sexual orientation, along with supportive counseling programs for these [[homosexual]] youth will transform the way society treats homosexuality.&lt;ref name="Campos" /&gt;

Many opponents of LGBT social movements have attributed their indifference toward homosexuality as being a result of the immoral values that it may instill in children who are exposed to homosexual individuals.&lt;ref name="Fetner" /&gt; In opposition to this claim, many proponents of increased education about homosexuality suggest that educators should refrain from teaching about [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] in schools entirely. In her book entitled "Gay and Lesbian Movement," [[Margaret Cruickshank]] provides statistical data from the [[Harris Insights &amp; Analytics|Harris and Yankelovich polls]] which confirmed that over 80% of American adults believe that students should be educated about sexuality within their public school. In addition, the poll also found that 75% of parents believe that homosexuality and [[abortion]] should be included in the curriculum as well. An assessment conducted on California public school systems discovered that only 2% of all parents actually disapproved of their child being taught about sexuality in school.&lt;ref name="Darder"&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Darder, Antoninia|editor2=Marta Baltodano|editor3=Raldolfo Torres|lastauthoramp=y|title=The Critical Pedagogy Reader|location=New York, NY|publisher=Routledge Falmer|year=2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a2bvKJ6S-L8C&amp;lpg=PR4&amp;pg=PA496#v=onepage|isbn=978-0-415-92261-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It had been suggested that education has a positive impact on support for same sex marriage. African Americans statistically have lower rates of educational achievement; however, the education level of African Americans does not have as much significance on their attitude towards [[same-sex marriage]] as it does on white attitudes. Educational attainment among whites has a significant positive effect on support for same-sex marriage, whereas the direct effect of education among African Americans is less significant. The income levels of whites have a direct and positive correlation with support for same-sex marriage, but African American income level is not significantly associated with attitudes toward same-sex marriage.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sherkat, Darren E.|author2=Kylan M.

Location also affects ideas towards same-sex marriage; residents of [[rural]] and southern areas are significantly more opposed to same-sex marriage in comparison to residents elsewhere. Gays and lesbians that live in rural areas face many challenges, including: sparse populations and the traditional culture held closely by the small population of most rural areas, generally hostile social climates towards gays relative to urban areas, and less social and institution support and access compared to urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;Wienke, Chris &amp; Hill, Gretchen. (2013). Does Place of Residence Matter? Rural-Urban Differences and the Wellbeing of Gay Men and Lesbians. Journal of homosexuality. 60. 1256-79. 10.1080/00918369.2013.806166.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to combat this problem that the LGBT community faces, social networks and apps such as Moovs have been created for "LGBT individuals with like-minds" that are "enabled to connect, share, and feel the heartbeat of the community as one."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/company/17876310/|title=Moovz - The Global LGBT Social Network|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/28/moovz-gay-social-network_n_4681259.html|title='Moovz,' Gay Social Network, Launched By Interacting Technology|last=Nichols|first=JamesMichael|date=2014-01-28|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-09-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study conducted by Darren E. Sherkat, Kylan M. de Vries, and Stacia Creek at the [[Southern Illinois University Carbondale]],  researchers found that women tend to be more consistently supportive of LBGT rights than men and that individuals that are divorced or have never married are also more likely to grant marital rights to same-sex couples than married or widowed individuals. They also claimed that white women are significantly more supportive than white men, but there are no gender discrepancies among African Americans. The year in which one was born was also found to be a strong indicator of attitude towards same-sex marriage—generations born after 1946 are considerably more supportive of same-sex marriage than older generations. Finally, the study reported that statistically African Americans are more opposed to same-sex marriage than any other ethnicity.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

Studies show that Non-Protestant Christians are much more likely to support same-sex unions than [[Protestants]]; 63% of African Americans claim that they are [[Black church|Baptist]] or Protestant, whereas only 30% of white Americans are. [[Religion]], as measured by individuals' religious affiliations, behaviors, and beliefs, has a lot of influence in structuring same-sex union attitudes and consistently influences opinions about homosexuality. The most liberal attitudes are generally reflected by [[Jews]], liberal Protestants, and people who are not affiliated with religion. This is because many of their religious traditions have not "systematically condemned homosexual behaviors" in recent years. Moderate and tolerant attitudes are generally reflected by Catholics and moderate Protestants. And lastly, the most conservative views are held by [[Evangelicalism in the United States|Evangelical Protestants]]. Moreover, it is a tendency for one to be less tolerant of homosexuality if their social network is strongly tied to a religious congregation. Organized religion, especially Protestant and Baptist affiliations, espouse conservative views which traditionally denounce same-sex unions. Therefore, these congregations are more likely to hear messages of this nature. Polls have also indicated that the amount and level of personal contact that individuals have with homosexual individuals and traditional morality affects attitudes of same-sex marriage and homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Olson, Laura R.|author2=Wendy Cadge|author3=James T. Harrison|title=Religion and Public Opinion about Same-Sex Marriage|journal=Social Science Quarterly|series=2nd ser.|volume=87|issue=2|year=2006|pages=341–60|url=http://www.wendycadge.com/assets/OlsonCadgeHarrison2006.pdf|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6237.2006.00384.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiction literature also has an increased role in shaping people's attitude towards same-sex marriages. An original idea appears in [[Rafael Grugman]] dystopian fiction book ''[[Nontraditional Love]]'' (2008). He describes an inverted world in which mixed-sex marriages are forbidden. In this world intimacy between the opposite sexes is rejected, world history and the classics of world literature have been falsified in order to support the ideology of the homosexual world (in this world same-sex love is a traditional love). At the heart of the novel is a love story between a man and a woman who unfortunately were born as heterosexuals in a homosexual world and they forced to hide their feelings and their sexual orientation. For a homosexual society love between man and women is a non-traditional love. Underlying this story is the idea that society should be tolerant and accepting and respect the right of every person to be themselves. It is unusual approach that supports human rights of all people and same-sex marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Rafael|last=Grugman|title=Nontraditional Love|location=New York|publisher=Liberty Publishing House|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Light-time correction''' is a displacement in the ''[[apparent place|apparent position]]'' of a celestial object from its ''true position'' (or ''geometric position'') caused by the object's motion during the time it takes its light to reach an observer.

Light-time correction occurs in principle during the observation of any moving object, because the [[speed of light]] is finite. The magnitude and direction of the displacement in position depends upon the distance of the object from the observer and the motion of the object, and is measured at the instant at which the object's light reaches the observer. It is ''independent'' of the motion of the observer. It should be contrasted with the [[aberration of light]], which depends upon the instantaneous [[velocity]] of the observer at the time of observation, and is independent of the motion or distance of the object.

Light-time correction can be applied to any object whose distance and motion are known. In particular, it is usually necessary to apply it to the motion of a [[planet]] or other [[solar system]] object. For this reason, the combined displacement of the apparent position due to the effects of light-time correction and aberration is known as ''planetary aberration''. By convention, light-time correction is not applied to the positions of stars, because their [[proper motion|motion]] and distance may not be known accurately.

==Calculation==

A calculation of light-time correction usually involves an [[iteration|iterative]] process. An approximate light-time is calculated by dividing the object's geometric distance from [[Earth]] by the speed of light. Then the object's velocity is multiplied by this approximate light-time to determine its approximate displacement through space during that time. Its previous position is used to calculate a more precise light-time. This process is repeated as necessary. For planetary motions, a few (3–5) iterations are sufficient to match the accuracy of the underlying [[Ephemeris|ephemerides]].

==Discovery==

The effect of the finite speed of light on observations of celestial objects was first recognised by [[Ole Rømer]] in 1675, during a series of observations of [[eclipse]]s of the [[moons of Jupiter|moons]] of [[Jupiter]]. He found that the interval between eclipses was less when Earth and Jupiter are approaching each other, and more when they are moving away from each other. He correctly deduced that this difference was caused by the appreciable time it took for light to travel from Jupiter to the observer on Earth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6505">Memória Abierta is an alliance of Argentine human rights organizations that promotes the memory of recent human rights violations, actions of resistance and struggles for truth and justice. It contributes to the promotion of human rights and seeks to promote reflection on the present.

It was created in 1999 and is currently composed of eight human rights organizations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Memorias urbanas en diálogo: Berlín y Buenos Aires|last=Birle et al.|first=Peter|publisher=Heinrich Boll Stiftung|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;: [[Permanent Assembly for Human Rights]], Buena Memoria Civil Association, [[:es:Centro_de_Estudios_Legales_y_Sociales|Center for Legal and Social Studies]], [[:es:El_Vesubio_(centro_de_detención)|Vesubio]] and Puente 12 Victims' Tribute Commission, Commission for Memory, Truth and Justice of the Northern Zone, Relatives of Disappeared and Arrested for Political Reasons, Historical and Social Memory Foundation of Argentina, [[Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo]] - Founding Line and [[Servicio Paz y Justicia|Service Peace and Justice]].

== History ==

In 1999, a group of human rights organizations began to meet, seeking to participate in a coordinated way in local and national initiatives in favor of the memory of the last dictatorship in Argentina. The main objective was to contribute to the elaboration of the memory of what happened during State terrorism and to the construction of a later democracy to strengthen and promote respect for human rights. The participating organizations came together with the conviction that a joint action would make them stronger in their struggle.

The initial work of Memoria Abierta included actions aimed at founding a Memory Museum, an extensive program of archival treatment of historical-institutional documents of human rights organizations and the construction of an Oral Archive of testimonies in film format on State terrorism. Later on were added works towards the task of systematization of photographs in a Photographic Archive and the production resources for the visualization of spaces of repression and resistance and their transformation into memory sites.

Memoria Abierta participated in the founding of the International Coalition of Sites of Conscience&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sitesofconscience.org/es/inicio/|title=Sites of Conscience|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In this space, coordinates the Latin American and Caribbean Network of Sites of Memory promoting the development of initiatives that stimulate reflection on human rights violations committed in these countries and their consequences in the present.

== Archives ==

Memoria Abierta implements a documentary treatment program. In this framework, it established common guidelines and standards for the cataloging and standardization of the different archives it gathers (documentaries, photographic, audiovisual). It applies international standards of description and a specialized Thesauri on Human Rights.

The Oral Archive of Memoria Abierta produces and gives access to testimonies related to the period of State terrorism, to the social and political life of the 1960s and 1970s and to the different actions promoted by human rights organizations and civil society in the search for truth and justice. It is composed of interviews to people whose lives have been affected in various ways by state terrorism. These testimonies are ordered, cataloged and arranged for public consultation in order to facilitate the study and interpretation of Argentine recent past from the point of view of the actors involved&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=From the Ashes of History: Loss and Recovery of Archives and Libraries in Modern Latin America|last=Aguirre Carlos|first=Javier VillaFlores|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Memoria Abierta archives were included in the "Memory of the World" Register of the UNESCO as part of the "Documentary Heritage on Human Rights in Argentina for the period 1976-1983. Archives for Truth, Memory and Justice in the face of State terrorism".

== Sites ==

It produces tools that make "visible" the sites used by repression. Identifies together with local counterparts, Clandestine Detention Centers in the Argentine territory and collaborates in the recovery processes of these places to turn them into memory sites. 

Memoria Abierta elaborates different types of resources that are regularly incorporated into the processes of judging the crimes of the dictatorship since the mid-2000s, at the request of the investigating magistrates or courts that are involved in oral and public trials in different parts of the country. Memoria Abierta also participate in judicial investigations through expert reports, archival advice and the supply of documentation requested by the courts

== International Work ==

Memoria Abierta works in partnership to rebuild social trust and promote cooperation within civil society and with state entities in a process of strengthening democratic institutions. It maintains different links and develops projects and activities with different organizations with the objective of exchanging and sharing their experience and work methodologies, as well as the characteristics of the Argentine process of truth and justice with other transitional processes of the world.

In this context, it shares strategies, lessons learned and specific methodologies related to the organization and preservation of archives (including oral archives), to topographic research with different sites within Argentina, in the region and in different countries of the world. ,

The institutions that make up the Latin American and Caribbean Network, which Memoria Abierta has been coordinating since 2006, are working to recover and construct collective reports on the serious violations of human rights and resistance in the region during the recent past, in periods of State terrorism, internal armed conflict and high levels of impunity, with the aim of promoting democracy and guarantees of non-repetition. The Latin American and Caribbean Network of Memory Sites develops projects, initiatives, joint trainings that seek to strengthen the integration between institutions with similar perspectives.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6670">The '''Mental Deficiency Act 1913''' was an act of the United Kingdom which made provisions for the institutional treatment of people deemed to be "[[feeble-minded]]" and "moral defectives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studymore.org.uk/mhhglo.htm#MentalDeficiency|title=Mental Health (History) Dictionary|publisher=studymore.org.uk|accessdate=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It proposed an institutional separation so that mental defectives should be taken out of Poor Law institutions and prisons into newly established colonies."&lt;ref&gt;Anne Digby, "Contexts and perspectives" in{{cite book |title=From Idiocy to Mental Deficiency: Historical Perspectives on People With Learning Disabilities|editors=David Wright, Anne Digby|location=London|publisher=Routledge|year=1996|isbn=0-203-16224-2}} 1-21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The [[Idiots Act 1886]] made the legal distinction between "[[idiot]]s" and "[[imbecile]]s". It contained educational provisions for the needs of people deemed to be in these categories. In 1904 the Royal Commission on the Care and Control of the Feeble-Minded was set up with the warrant "to consider the existing methods of dealing with idiots and epileptics, and with imbecile, feeble-minded, or defective persons not certified under the Lunacy Laws... to report as to the amendments in the law or other measures which should be adopted in the matter".&lt;ref name=royal-commission&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/reportroyalcomm00mindgoog |title=Report of the Royal Commission on the Care And Control of the Feebleminded |publisher=His Majesty's Stationery Office |year=1908 |accessdate=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission returned a lengthy report in 1908 which estimated that of a population of 32,527,843 British inhabitants 149,628 people (0.46%) were considered "mentally defective". It recommended the establishment of a board of control which would oversee local authority efforts aimed at "the well-being of the mentally defective".&lt;ref&gt;British Medical Journal #2485, Aug. 15, 1908, pp. 415&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=paget-1911&gt;{{cite book |pages=11-45 |url=https://archive.org/details/feeblemindedness00lapa |title=Feeblemindedness in Children of School-Age |author=Charles Paget Lapage |publisher=Manchester University Press |year=1911 |accessdate=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Winston Churchill]] spoke of the need to introduce compulsory labour camps for "mental defectives" in the House of Commons in February 1911. In May 1912 a Private Members' Bill entitled the "Feeble-Minded Control Bill" was introduced in the House of Commons, which called for the implementation of the Royal Commission's conclusions. It rejected sterilisation of the "feeble-minded", but had provision for registration and segregation.&lt;ref name="gilbert"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winstonchurchill.org/support/the-churchill-centre/publications/finest-hour-online/594-churchill-and-eugenics |title=Churchill and Eugenics |author=Sir Martin Gilbert CBE |date=31 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215071541/http://www.winstonchurchill.org/support/the-churchill-centre/publications/finest-hour-online/594-churchill-and-eugenics |archivedate=15 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the few voices raised against the bill was that of [[G.K. Chesterton]] who ridiculed the bill, calling it the "Feeble-Minded Bill, both for brevity and because the description is strictly accurate".&lt;ref&gt;''Eugenics and Other Evils'', 1923, Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was withdrawn, but a government bill introduced on 10 June 1912 replaced it, which would become the Mental Deficiency Act 1913.&lt;ref name="gilbert" /&gt;

==The Mental Deficiency Act==
The bill was passed in 1913 with only three MPs voting against it.&lt;ref name="gilbert" /&gt; One of them was [[Josiah Wedgwood, 1st Baron Wedgwood|Josiah Wedgwood]], who said of it, "It is a spirit of the Horrible Eugenic Society which is setting out to breed up the working class as though they were cattle."&lt;ref&gt;Jayne Woodhouse, "Eugenics and the feeble-minded: the Parliamentary debates of 1912-14", ''History of Education'' 11:2, 133&lt;/ref&gt; The new act repealed the Idiots Act 1886 and followed the recommendations of the Royal Commission on the Care and Control of the Feeble-Minded. It established the [[Board of Control for Lunacy and Mental Deficiency]] to oversee the implementation of provisions for the care and management of four classes of people,

:a) ''Idiots.'' Those so deeply defective as to be unable to guard themselves against common physical dangers.

:b) ''Imbeciles.'' Whose defectiveness does not amount to idiocy, but is so pronounced that they are incapable of managing themselves or their affairs, or, in the case of children, of being taught to do so.

:c) ''Feeble-minded persons.'' Whose weakness does not amount to imbecility, yet who require care, supervision, or control, for their protection or for the protection of others, or, in the case of children, are incapable of receiving benefit from the instruction in ordinary schools.

:d) ''Moral Imbeciles.'' Displaying mental weakness coupled with strong vicious or criminal propensities, and on whom punishment has little or no deterrent effect.&lt;ref&gt;Gattie, W. H., Holt-Hughes, T. H., "Note on the Mental Deficiency Act, 1913", ''The Law Quarterly Review'' 30 (1914) 202&lt;/ref&gt;

A person deemed to be an idiot or imbecile might be placed in an institution or under guardianship if the parent or guardian so petitioned, as could a person of any of the four categories under 21 years, as could a person of any category who had been abandoned, neglected, guilty of a crime, in a state institution, habitually drunk, or unable to be schooled.&lt;ref&gt;Gattie, W. H., Holt-Hughes, T. H., "Note on the Mental Deficiency Act, 1913", ''The Law Quarterly Review'' 30 (1914) 209&lt;/ref&gt;

At the height of operation of the Mental Deficiency Act, 65,000 people were placed in "colonies" or in other institutional settings. The act remained in effect until it was repealed by the [[Mental Health Act 1959]].&lt;ref&gt;Jan Walmsley, "Women and the Mental Deficiency Act of 1913: citizenship, sexuality and regulation", ''British Journal of Learning Disabilities'', 28 (2000), 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15357">'''Narcissistic mortification''' is "the primitive terror of self dissolution, triggered by the sudden exposure of one's sense of a defective self ... it is death by [[embarrassment]]".&lt;ref name = Libbey&gt;{{cite web|title=On Narcissistic Mortification|url=http://internationalpsychoanalysis.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/libbeypaper.pdf|author= Mary Libbey|publisher= Paper  presented at the Shame Symposium, New York, March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Narcissistic mortification is a term first used by [[Sigmund Freud]] in his last book, ''[[Moses and Monotheism]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Moses and Monotheism'' (Standard Ed., 23) p. 74 and p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; with respect to early injuries to the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]]/self. The concept has been widely employed in [[ego psychology]] and also contributed to the roots of [[self psychology]].

When narcissistic mortification is experienced for the first time, it may be defined as a sudden loss of control over external or internal reality, or both. This produces strong emotions of terror while at the same time narcissistic [[libido]] (also known as ego-libido) or [[destrudo]] is built up.&lt;ref name=Eidelberg&gt;{{cite web|title=An introduction to the study of the narcissistic mortification|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01568757#page-1|publisher=Psychiatric Quarterly|author=Ludwig Eidelberg}} 1957;31(4):657-68.&lt;/ref&gt; Narcissistic libido or ego-libido is the concentration of libido on the self. Destrudo is the opposite of libido and is the impulse to destroy oneself and everything associated with oneself.

==Early developments: Bergler, Anna Freud, and Eidelberg==
[[Edmund Bergler]] developed the concept of narcissistic mortification in connection with early fantasies of [[omnipotence]] in the developing child, and with the fury provoked by the confrontations with reality that undermine his or her illusions.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Bergler, "The Psychology of Gambling", Jon Halliday/Peter Fuller eds., ''The Psychology of Gambling'' (London 1974) p. 182-3&lt;/ref&gt; For Bergler, “the narcissistic mortification suffered in this very early period continues to act as a stimulus throughout his life”.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Bergler, ''The Basic Neurosis'' (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anna Freud]] used the term in connection with her exploration of the [[defence mechanism]] of altruistic surrender, whereby an individual lives only through the lives of others – seeing at the root of such an abrogation of one's own life an early experience of narcissistic mortification at a disappointment with one's self.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Appignanesi/John Forrester, ''Freud's Women'' (2004) p. 294&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychoanalyst and author Ludwig Eidelberg subsequently expanded on the concept in the fifties and sixties. Eidelberg defined narcissistic mortification as occurring when “a sudden loss of control over external or internal reality...produces the painful emotional experience of terror”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/u567q2r527731438/ "An introduction to the study of the narcissistic mortification" Psychiatric Quarterly 31]&lt;/ref&gt; He also stressed that for many patients simply to have to accept themselves as having neurotic symptoms was itself a source of narcissistic mortification.&lt;ref&gt;Eidelberg: [http://www.pep-web.org/document.php?id=paq.029.0582b The Concept of Narcissistic Mortification] Int J Psychoanal. 1959 May-Aug;40:163-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kohut and self psychology==

For Kohut, [[narcissistic rage and narcissistic injury|narcissistic injury]] - the root cause of what he  termed [[narcissistic personality disorder]] – was broadly equivalent to the [[humiliation]] of mortification.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Adamson/Hilary Anne Clark, ''Scenes of Shame'' (1999) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Kohut considered that “if the [[grandiosity]] of the narcissistic self has been insufficiently modified...then the adult ego will tend to vacillate between an irrational overestimation of the self and feelings of inferiority and will react with narcissistic mortification to the thwarting of its ambitions”.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Steven J. Ellman, ''When Theories Touch'' (London 2009) p. 464&lt;/ref&gt;

==Object relations theory==
{{Main|Object relations theory}}
Unlike ego psychologists, object relations theorists have traditionally used a rather different, [[Melanie Klein|post-Kleinian]] vocabulary to describe the early woundings of narcissistic mortification. Recently however  such theorists have found analogies between Freud's emphasis on the sensitivity of the ego to narcissistic humiliation and mortification, and the views of [[W. R. Bion|Bion]] on 'nameless dread' or [[D. W. Winnicott|Winnicott]]'s on the original agonies of the breakdown of childhood consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Eigen, ''The Sensitive Self'' (2004) p. 10, 20, and 25&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time ego psychologists have been increasingly prepared to see narcissistic mortification as occurring in the context of early relations to objects.

==Physical sensations and psychological perceptions==
An individual’s experience of mortification may be accompanied by both physical and psychological sensations. Physical sensations such as: burning, painful tingling over the body, pain in the chest that slowly expands and spreads throughout the torso, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, sweating, blanching, coldness and numbness can be experienced by the individual suffering from mortification. The psychological sensations described are feeling shocked, exposed, and humiliated. Descriptions of this experience can be, for example: “It feels like I won’t survive” and “I have the absolute conviction that he or she hates me and it’s my fault”. These sensations are always followed by shock, although they may have happened on various occasions, they also prompt the need for the individual suffering to do something both internally and externally, to effect a positive self-image in the eyes of their narcissistic object. Narcissistic mortification is extreme in its intensity, global nature, and its lack of perspective, causing the anxiety associated with it to become traumatic.&lt;ref name = Libbey/&gt;

==Normal versus pathological==
In Eidelberg's view, a normal individual would usually be able to avoid being overwhelmed by internal needs because they recognize these urges in time to bring about their partial discharge. However, Eidelberg does not view occasional outbursts of temper as a sign of disorder. An individual experiencing pathological narcissistic mortification is prone to become fixated on infantile objects, resulting in an infantile form of discharge. He or she cannot be satisfied by the partial discharge of this energy, which takes place on an  unconscious level, and this in turn interferes with their well-being. According to Eidelberg, the denial of an infantile narcissistic mortification can be responsible for many defensive mechanisms.&lt;ref name=Eidelberg /&gt;

===Internal versus external===

Narcissistic mortification can be: 
* '''Internal''' - occurs when an individual is overstimulated by their emotions. For example, while debating with classmates on the importance of stem cell research an outspoken student loses his temper causing an uproar. The student has just exhibited an overstimulation of his emotions and used this outburst to relieve internal tension. 
* '''External''' - occurs when something out of one's control influences a situation, for example, an individual who is held at gunpoint while having their wallet stolen. This individual does not hold any control over the scenario nor the actions of the gunman, but their reaction to being held at gunpoint influences the next scenario and what the gunman does next.&lt;ref name=Eidelberg /&gt;

==In cult leadership==
{{POV-section|date=May 2013}}

To escape the narcissistic mortification of accepting their own dependency needs, [[cult]] leaders may resort to delusions of [[omnipotence]].&lt;ref name="pathological narcissist"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shaw|first=Daniel|title=Chris Nemelka - Public Scrutiny|url=http://chrisnemelka.com/the-pathological-narcissist/#more-4828|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their continuing [[shame]] and underlying [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The dark side of enlightenment: sadomasochistic aspects of the quest for perfection|url=http://www.danielshawlcsw.com/dark_side.htm|accessdate=31 March 2013|author=Daniel Shaw|date=22 January 2000|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130629000728/http://www.danielshawlcsw.com/dark_side.htm|archivedate=29 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their repudiation of dependency,&lt;ref name="traumatic abuse in cults"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Daniel|title=Traumatic abuse in cults: A psychoanalytic perspective|journal=Cultic Studies Review|year=2003|volume=2|url=http://www.danielshawlcsw.com/traumabusecults.pdf|accessdate=31 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617040314/http://www.danielshawlcsw.com/traumabusecults.pdf|archivedate=17 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; obliges such leaders to use seduction and manic defenses to externalize and locate dependency needs in others, thus making their followers controllable through a displaced sense of shame.

==Death, anxiety, and suicide==

Because in western culture death is sometimes seen as the ultimate loss of control, fear of it may produce death anxiety in the form of a sense of extreme shame or narcissistic mortification.&lt;ref&gt;J. Kauffman ed.,  ''The Shame of Death, Grief and Trauma'' (2010) p. 77-9&lt;/ref&gt; The shame in this context is produced by the loss of stoicism, productivity, and control, aspects that are highly valued by society and aspects that are taken away as one ages. Death according to Darcy Harris, 'is the ultimate narcissistic wound, bringing about not just the annihilation of self, but the annihilation of one's entire existence, resulting in a form of existential shame for human beings, who possess the ability to ponder this dilemma with their higher functioning cognitive abilities.'&lt;ref&gt;Kauffman&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals who hold this anxiety are ashamed of mortality and the frailty that comes along with it; and may attempt to overcome this reality through diversions and accomplishments, deflecting feelings of inferiority and shame through strategies like [[grandiosity]] in similar fashion to those with narcissistic personality traits.&lt;ref name="shame of death"&gt;{{cite book|title=The shame of death, grief, and trauma |isbn=0-203-88360-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VAn8xnSisJQC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;lpg=PA77&amp;dq=death+anxiety+and+narcissistic+mortification&amp;source=bl&amp;hl=en |editor=Jeffrey Kauffman |accessdate=1 April 2013 |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Narcissistic mortification may also be produced by death of someone close.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold M. Cooper ed., ''Contemporary Psychoanalysis in America'' (2008) p. 680&lt;/ref&gt; Such a loss of an essential object may even lead through narcissistic mortification to suicide.&lt;ref&gt;F. Alexander et al, ''Psychoanalytic Pioneers'' (1995) p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the many motives behind suicidal activities in general are shame, loss of honor, and narcissistic mortification.&lt;ref name="suicide and narcissistic mortification"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ritter |first1=Kristina |last2=Chaudhry |first2=Haroon |last3=Erhabor |first3=Idemudia |last4=Karakula |first4=Hanna |last5=Okribelashvili |first5=Ninõ |last6=Rudaleviciene |first6=Palmira |last7=Stompe |first7=Thomas |title=Suicide motives and culture |journal=Official Journal of World Association of Cultural Psychiatry |year=2008 |url=http://www.wcprr.org/pdf/03-02/2008.02.6976.pdf |accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who suffer from narcissistic mortification are more likely to participate in suicidal behaviors and those who do not receive the proper help more often than not succeed. Suicide related to narcissistic mortification is different from  normal sorrow in that it is associated with deep rooted self-contempt and self-hatred.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, M. M. (1958). Zur Psychologie des Selbstmordes. Acta Psychotherapeutica, Psychosomatica Et Orthopaedagogica, 6317-326. doi:10.1159/000285354&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
According to a paper presented by Mary Libbey, "On Narcissistic Mortification", presented at the 2006 Shame Symposium, long-term goal of psychoanalytic treatment for those who suffer from narcissistic mortification is to transform the mortification into shame. She says by transforming it into shame it enables the sufferer to tolerate and use it as a signal; the process of transforming mortification into shame entails working through both the early mortifying traumas as well as the defenses, often unstable, related to them. If an individual sufferer does not go through this transformation, he or she is left with two unstable narcissistic defenses. Libbey says these defenses are: self-damning, deflated states designed to appease and hold on to self-objects, and narcissistic conceit, which is designed to project the defective self experiences onto self-objects. Both of these defensive styles require a continuation of dependence on the self-object. Transforming the mortification into shame makes it possible for self-appraisal and self-tolerance, this ultimately leads to psychic separation and self-reliance without the need to sustain one's mortification, according to Libbey's paper.&lt;ref name = Libbey/&gt;

==In the 21st century==

Postmodern Freudians link narcissistic mortification to Winnicott's theory of primitive mental states which lack the capacity for symbolisation, and their need for re-integration.&lt;ref&gt;A. B. Druck et al eds., ''A New Freudian Synthesis'' (2011) p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; Returning in the transference to the intolerable mortification underpinning such [[narcissistic defences]] can however also produce positive analytic change, by way of the (albeit mortifying) re-experience of overwhelming object loss within an intersubjective holding environment.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Druck, ''A Freudian Synthesis'' (London 2010) p. 254&lt;/ref&gt;

21st century American analysts are particularly concerned with the potential production of narcissistic mortification as a by-product of analytic interpretation, especially with regard to [[masochistic personality disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;Arnold M. Cooper ed., ''Contemporary Psychoanalysis in America'' (2008) p. 505 and p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary uses==

Narcissistic mortification at injuries to [[self-esteem]] has been seen as pervading Captain Ahab's motivations in his confrontation with [[Moby-Dick]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Adamson, ''Melville, Shame, and the Evil Eye'' (1997) p. 74-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Mortification at one's self is seen in Mary Shelley's [[Frankenstein]] when the Creature stares at his reflection in a pool of water. This is where he becomes convinced that he is in fact the Creature and becomes filled with despondence and mortification.&lt;ref name=Frankenstein&gt;{{cite web|last=Berman|first=Jeffrey|title=Frankenstein; or, the Modern Narcissus|url=http://knarf.english.upenn.edu/Articles/berman.html|publisher=New York University|accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ophelimity''' is an economic concept introduced by [[Vilfredo Pareto]] as a measure of purely economic satisfaction, so he could use the already well-established term [[utility]] as a measure of a more broadly based satisfaction encompassing other dimensions as well, such as the ethical, moral, religious, and political.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Paretian Welfare Theory: Some Neglected Aspects |journal=The Journal of Political Economy |date=1969-01-02 |first=Vincent J. |last=Tarascio |volume=77 |issue=1 |pages=1–20| id= |jstor=1829062 |doi=10.1086/259490}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, it corresponds to the sense in which utility is often used in economic calculations. [[Irving Fisher]] proposed replacing ophelimity (and thus utility as it is commonly construed) with the term ''wantability''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/03/ophelimity-vs-w.html |title=Ophelimity vs. Wantability |accessdate=2011-05-20 |last=Thoma |first=Mark |date=2008-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5261">[[File:Adolf Loos (1870–1933) (vor 1920; Franz Löwy).jpg|thumb|Adolf Loos]]
"'''Ornament and Crime'''" is an essay and lecture by modernist architect [[Adolf Loos]] that criticizes [[ornament (art)|ornament]] in useful objects.

==History==
Contrary to popular belief that it was composed in 1908, Adolf Loos first gave the lecture in 1910 at the Akademischer Verband für Literatur und Musik in Vienna. The essay was then published in 1913 in ''Les Cahiers d’aujourd’hui'' in French as "Ornement et Crime". Only in 1929 was the essay published in German in the ''[[Frankfurter Zeitung]]'', as "Ornament und Verbrechen". It was the architect [[Henry Kulka]], who assisted Loos during a reprint of the essay in 1931 in ''Trotzdem'', that altered the original year to 1908 after he consulted Loos, who either didn't remember well or wanted to assume primacy in the confrontation against the [[Secession (art)|Secessionists]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Long, [http://apps.acsa-arch.org/resources/proceedings/uploads/streamfile.aspx?path=ACSA.AM.85&amp;name=ACSA.AM.85.107.pdf “Ornament, Crime, Myth, and Meaning”], ''85th ACSA Annual Meeting Proceedings, Architecture: Material and Imagined'', 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The essay was written when [[Art Nouveau]]—known as [[Vienna Secession|Secession]] in Austria and which Loos had excoriated even at its height in 1900—was showing a new way forward for modern art. The essay is important in articulating some moralizing views, inherited from the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], which would be fundamental to the [[Bauhaus]] design studio, and would help define the ideology of [[Modern architecture|modernism in architecture]].

"The evolution of culture marches with the elimination of ornament from useful objects," Loos proclaimed, thus linking the optimistic sense of the linear and upward progress of cultures with the contemporary vogue for applying [[evolution]] to cultural contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Jimena Canales, Andrew Herscher, [http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~hsdept/bios/docs/canales-Criminal%20Skins.pdf "Criminal Skins: Tattoos and Modern Architecture in the Work of Adolf Loos"], ''Architectural History'' 48, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Loos's work was prompted by regulations he encountered when he designed a tailorshop without ornamentation next to a palace. He eventually conceded to requirements by adding a flowerpot.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |last=Wise|first=Michael |date=4 December 2013 |title=Reassessing an Uproar in Architecture |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/05/garden/reassessing-an-uproar-in-architecture.html?_r=0 |newspaper=New York Times |location=New York |access-date=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the essay, Loos explains his philosophy, describing how ornamentation can have the effect of causing objects to go out of style and thus become obsolete. It struck him that it was a crime to waste the effort needed to add ornamentation, when the ornamentation would cause the object to soon go out of style. Loos introduced a sense of the "immorality" of ornament, describing it as "degenerate", its suppression as necessary for regulating modern society. He took as one of his examples the [[tattoo]]ing of the "[[Papuan peoples|Papuan]]" and the intense surface decorations of the objects about him—Loos says that, in the eyes of western culture, the Papuan has not evolved to the moral and civilized circumstances of modern man, who, should he tattoo himself, would either be considered a criminal or a degenerate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adolf Loos|year=1908|url=http://www2.gwu.edu/~art/Temporary_SL/177/pdfs/Loos.pdf|title=Ornament and Crime|location=Innsbruck, reprint Vienna, 1930|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403175309/http://www2.gwu.edu/~art/Temporary_SL/177/pdfs/Loos.pdf|archivedate=2015-04-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rawson&gt;{{cite book | last = Rawson | first = Jessica | |authorlink= Jessica Rawson |title = Chinese ornament: the lotus and the dragon | publisher = British Museum Publications | location = London | year = 1984 | isbn = 0-7141-1431-6 |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loos never argued for the complete absence of ornamentation, but believed that it had to be appropriate to the type of material.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

Loos concluded that "No ornament can any longer be made today by anyone who lives on our cultural level ... Freedom from ornament is a sign of spiritual strength".&lt;ref name=rawson/&gt;

{{Hinduism}}
The word, '''Pārijāta''' ([[Sanskrit]]: पारिजात), – refers to the Indian coral tree, night-flowering coral jasmine, or simply fragrance. But, written and pronounced as ''Parijāta'' ([[Sanskrit]]: परिजात) it means - descended from, begotten by or fully developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sanskrit-English Dictionary|publisher=Spokensanskrit de.|url=http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=pArijAta&amp;direction=SE&amp;link=yes&amp;choice=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hindu mythology]], the celestial ''Pārijāta tree'' is the tree of the universe which is owned by [[Shachi|Indrani]] and planted in ''[[svarga]]'' located between heaven and earth, which tree, also known as ''[[Kalpavriksha|Kalpa-taru]]'', is believed to yield all objects of desire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Ancient Deities|publisher=[[Routledge]]|page=373|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sEIngqiKOugC&amp;pg=PA373&amp;dq=parijata&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hqf-VNK-PIyeugTil4GwDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=parijata&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tree is identified with the Mandāra tree.

From the [[Bhagavata Purana]], the [[Vishnu Purana]] and the [[Mahabharata]] it is learnt that the elaborate process of ''[[Samudra manthan]]'' of primal waters of the cosmic ocean yielded the ''Pārijāta tree'' as one of the three valuables, this tree, said to have blossomed atop [[Mount Meru]] in the garden of paradise and identified with the Indian coral tree, was claimed by [[Indra]] no sooner it rose to the surface and emitted its fragrance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Why the Parijata Tree came Down to Earth|author=Anita Nair|publisher=Penguin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XUQnAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT13&amp;dq=parijata&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JKb-VI37OI6GuASI5YHICQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=parijata&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=the Handbook of Tibetan Buddhist Symbols|publisher=Serindia publications|page=193|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-3804Ud9-4IC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;dq=parijata&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JKb-VI37OI6GuASI5YHICQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=parijata&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Krishna]] is believed to have stolen the ''Pārijāta flower'' from Indra’s paradise to which act ''pārijāta-harana'' (removal of the ''Pārijāta tree'' from heaven), which has two forms in the [[Harivamsa]], relates; according to the ''[[puranas]]'', at the behest of his wife, [[Satyabhama]], Krishna had uprooted the ''pārijāta tree'' from the ''Nandana-vana'' of Indra and brought it to [[Dwarka]] though it has no role in rituals and is not associated with the world of humans, being merely a possession of sorts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Festival of Indra|author=Michael Charles Baltutis|publisher=Proquest|pages=61, 78, 79, 82|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SoEIwRq67iEC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=parijata&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yKb-VIKMCcKSuAT0woKwBw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=parijata&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hindu astrology]], the word, ''Pārijāta'', refers to a [[Raja yoga (Hindu astrology)|Rāja yoga]] based on the [[Planetary dispositors (Hindu astrology)|Planetary Dispositor Principle]].  This planetary combination called Pārijāta yoga arises if the lord of the sign occupied by the lord of the [[Lagna]] (Ascendant) and the lord of the sign occupied by the [[dispositor]] of the lord of the lagna both, or if the lords of the [[Navamsa (astrology)|navāmsas]] occupied by these two lords are situated in a ''kendra'' or a ''trikona'' from the ''lagna-kendra'' in their own or exaltation signs. [[Parasara]] states that the person blessed with [[Parijata yoga]] will be fond of battles, strong-willed, full of determination, fearless, adept and successful, kind-hearted, forgiving and generous, have faith in [[Dharma]] and [[Karmas]], a proud possessor and enjoyer of wealth and comforts and the one who leads a royal life during his or her middle and last part of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= [[Bṛhat Parāśara Horāśāstra]] 2002 Ed.|publisher=Manoj Pocket Books|page=190|quote=Sloka 41&amp;42|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Three Hundred Important Combinations|author=B.V.Raman|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]]|page=70|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RAifaE52xPwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Parijata+Yoga&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hbntUofTEuyM7Aa3i4CgCQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Parijata%20Yoga&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pārijāta yoga is a combination of the Parvata yoga and the [[Kahala yoga]]. [[Gautama Buddha]] was blessed with this [[Yoga (Hindu astrology)|yoga]].

{{Planned World Trade Center}}
'''Park51''' (originally named '''Cordoba House''') is a development that was originally envisioned as a 13-story [[Islamic]] [[community center]] and [[mosque]] in [[Lower Manhattan]]. The developers hoped to promote an [[interfaith dialog]]ue within the greater community. Due to its proposed location two blocks from the [[World Trade Center site]], it was widely and controversially referred to as the "'''Ground Zero mosque'''".&lt;ref name=CSM2011&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zraick|first1=Karen|last2=Dobnik|first2=Verena|title=Ground zero mosque opened to public Wednesday|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2011/0922/Ground-zero-mosque-opened-to-public-Wednesday|accessdate=19 December 2015|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Christian Science Monitor|date=September 22, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151221130220/http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2011/0922/Ground-zero-mosque-opened-to-public-Wednesday|archivedate=21 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project would replace an existing 1850s building of [[Italianate architecture|Italianate style]] that was damaged in the [[September 11 attacks]]. The original design was by [[Michel Abboud]], principal of SOMA Architects, who wrestled for months with the challenge of making the building fit naturally into its lower Manhattan surroundings: on the one hand, it should have a contemporary design, and, at the same time, it should look Islamic. His design included a 500-seat auditorium, theater, [[performing arts center]], [[fitness center]], swimming pool, basketball court, childcare area, bookstore, [[culinary school]], art studio, food court, and memorial to the victims of the September 11 attacks. It also included a prayer space for the Muslim community, which would accommodate 1,000–2,000 people.

In late September 2011, a temporary {{convert|4000|sqft|sqm|adj=on}} Islamic center opened in renovated space at the Park51 location. In summer 2014, it was announced that there would instead be a 3-story museum with a prayer space, as well as condos, at 49-51 Park Place. The plans were changed again in September 2015, when the owner announced a {{convert|667|ft|m|adj=on}}, 70-story luxury condominium building at the site. In May 2016, financing was secured for a 43-story condominium building with room for an Islamic cultural museum.

The project was originally called Cordoba House, then renamed Park51, in reference to the street address on Park Place.&lt;ref name="Stanford University Press"/&gt; Later, the Imam leading the project introduced some ambiguity by again referring to the project as "Cordoba House".&lt;ref name="nytimes7"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/08/opinion/08mosque.html|title=Building on Faith|author=Feisal Abdul Rauf|work=The New York Times|date=September 7, 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170506002307/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/08/opinion/08mosque.html|archivedate=May 6, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Park51 website then clarified that Park51 is the community center, while Cordoba House is the "interfaith and religious component of the center".&lt;ref name="amira1"&gt;{{cite news |author=Dan Amira |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2010/07/ground_zero_mosque_gets_lets_m.html |title=Ground Zero Mosque Gets Less Muslim-Invasion-Sounding Name |work=New York |date=July 14, 2010 |accessdate=August 2, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100719020940/http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2010/07/ground_zero_mosque_gets_lets_m.html |archivedate=July 19, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes7"/&gt;

The specific location of the planned facility, "where a piece of the wreckage fell", so close to the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]], was a primary selling point for the Muslims who bought the building.

The board's chairwoman, [[Julie Menin]], supported deletion of references to the building as a mosque and interfaith center that were in an earlier draft of the resolution, saying: "I personally was uncomfortable with the language that talked about the religious institution.

The meeting where the vote was held was contentious. Some of the speakers supporting the project were Muslims who lost family members in the attacks, and were booed by protesters.

===Landmark status declined and litigation===
As the controversy grew New York City's [[Landmarks Preservation Commission]] agreed to reconsider the 1980s landmark application which it had not acted on previously. On August 3, 2010, it voted 9–0 against granting landmark status and historic protection to the building. That cleared the way for it to be demolished, and the new Cordoba House to be built in its place.&lt;ref name=poll/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="observer1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="boston1"/&gt;

[[Adam Leitman Bailey]], the lawyer who represented the Islamic center's developer [[pro bono]], called the decision "a victory for America" and said, "Despite the tempest of religious hatred, the judge flexed our Constitution's muscles enforcing the very bedrock of our democracy."

===Effects on recruitment of radical Islamists===
Counterterrorism analysts have noted that the developing controversy over Park51 has provided a "recruitment opportunity" for radical Islamist groups. According to Evan Kohlmann, the senior partner in the New York-based security firm Flashpoint Global Partners, "[t]he reaction is, at least on the part of extremists, fairly gleeful – that America is playing into our hands, that America is revealing its ugly face, and that even if it doesn't further radicalize people in the Middle East, there's no doubt that it will radicalize a kind of a key constituency that al-Qaida and other extremists are seeking to covet{{Sic}}, seeking to court, which is the small number of homegrown extremists here in the United States".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Gary Thomas |url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/Radical-Islamists-Try-to-Exploit-Islamophobia-101592048.html |title=Radical Islamists Try to Exploit Islamophobia |publisher=Voice of America |date=August 26, 2010 |accessdate=September 2, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830202224/http://www.voanews.com/english/news/Radical-Islamists-Try-to-Exploit-Islamophobia-101592048.html |archivedate=August 30, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Newsweek'' quotes a [[Taliban]] operative as explicitly connecting increased opposition to the project with increased support for the Taliban's cause. "By preventing this mosque from being built, America is doing us a big favor," the Taliban operative stated. "It's providing us with more recruits, donations, and popular support."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Sami Yousafzai |author2=Ron Moreau |lastauthoramp=yes |url=http://www.newsweek.com/2010/08/30/taliban-using-mosque-controversy-to-recruit.html |title=The Taliban vs. the Mosque |work=Newsweek |date=August 30, 2010 |accessdate=September 5, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902031055/http://www.newsweek.com/2010/08/30/taliban-using-mosque-controversy-to-recruit.html |archivedate=September 2, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, filmmaker David Osit produced a documentary about the Park51 controversy, specifically following the story through the experiences of developer Sharif El-Gamal.

Some polls tried to gauge public opinion of Muslims' right to build Park51 near ground zero. The [[Quinnipiac University Polling Institute]] poll of New York State residents released August 31, 2010 found a 54–40 percent majority of voters agreeing 'that because of American freedom of religion, Muslims have the right to build the mosque near Ground Zero'.&lt;ref name="quinn"/&gt; A Fox News national poll taken August 10–11, 2010 found that 61% felt that the project developers had a right to build a mosque there (a majority of Democrats (63–32%), Republicans (57–36%), and Independents (69–29%).&lt;ref name="foxpolldata"/&gt; The [[Economist]]/YouGov poll taken the week of August 19, 2010 concurred that Democrats (57.5–24.9%) and Independents (62.3–25.2%) believed Muslims had a "constitutional right" to build a mosque at the site, but found that Republicans (31.8–53.2%) did not believe that Muslims had such a right. The poll found that 50.2%, overall, supported the constitutional right to build at the site, 32.7% were opposed and 17.1% had no opinion.&lt;ref name="econyougov \" /&gt;

The Economist/YouGov poll also noted that 52% of Americans believe that "Muslims should be able to build mosques in the United States wherever other religions can build houses of worship", as opposed to 34% who believe that "there are some places in the United States where it is not appropriate to build mosques, though it would be appropriate to build other houses of worship" and 14% who believe "mosques should not be permitted anywhere in the United States".&lt;ref name="econyougov \" /&gt;

===Opposition===

The prospect of building a mosque close to [[World Trade Center site|Ground Zero]] was offensive to some opponents of the construction project, since the hijackers in the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]] identified as Muslim.&lt;ref name="Stanford University Press"/&gt;  [[Newt Gingrich]] declared: "There should be no mosque near Ground Zero in New York so long as there are no churches or synagogues in Saudi Arabia."&lt;ref name="NewYorker-16Aug"/&gt;

====9/11 families====
Some relatives of victims of the September 11 attacks said they found the proposal offensive because the perpetrators who committed the attacks did so in the name of Islam.&lt;ref name="nydailynews2"/&gt; A number said that it was not an issue of freedom of religion, property rights, or racism, but rather one of sensitivity to the families of those killed, in choosing the specific location of the center.

A group of victims' relatives, 9/11 Families for a Safe &amp; Strong America, called the proposal "a gross insult to the memory of those who were killed on that terrible day".&lt;ref name="boston2"/&gt; [[Debra Burlingame]], a co-founder of the group whose brother died in the attacks, said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is a place which is {{convert|600|ft|m|disp=sqbr}} from where almost 3,000 people were torn to pieces by Islamic extremists... it is incredibly insensitive and audacious ... for them to build a mosque ... so that they could be in proximity to where that atrocity happened ...

[[Sally Regenhard]], whose son was a firefighter who was killed in the attacks, and who has testified before Congress on 9/11, said that the center would be "sacrilege on sacred ground", and that "People are being accused of being anti-Muslim and racist, but this is simply a matter of sensitivity."&lt;ref name="nyt-2010-07-13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newsweek1"&gt;{{cite news |author=Lisa Miller |url=http://www.newsweek.com/2010/08/08/war-over-ground-zero.html |title=War Over Ground Zero |magazine=Newsweek |date=August 8, 2010 |accessdate=August 8, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811004701/http://www.newsweek.com/2010/08/08/war-over-ground-zero.html |archivedate=August 11, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[Fire Department of New York|NY Fire Department]] Deputy Chief Jim Riches, whose son Jim was killed, said: "I don't want to have to go down to a memorial where my son died on 9/11, and look at a mosque," adding "this is all about location, location, location.

The building of an Islamic community center near Ground Zero has been criticized by some Muslims. The [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]] does not directly oppose the building of a mosque near ground zero but views that the sentiments of non-Muslims should not be unduly hurt. They state that there are other places where mosques can be built and they do not see why that particular location has been chosen.&lt;ref name="movemosque"/&gt; The head of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, [[Mirza Masroor Ahmad]] in London, stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If a mosque is built at the proposed site, then the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community would like to see churches, synagogues, Hindu places of worship and places of worship of all other religions also built near Ground Zero. That would be a good example of how from an act of evil and terror has emerged unity and peace.&lt;ref name="movemosque"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2010/08/23/michael-goodwin-ground-zero-mosque-obama-pelosi-rima-fakih-muslims-howard-dean |title=Good News – The 'Move the Mosque' Movement Is Growing |date=August 23, 2010 |accessdate=September 12, 2010 |work=Fox News |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914195513/http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2010/08/23/michael-goodwin-ground-zero-mosque-obama-pelosi-rima-fakih-muslims-howard-dean/ |archivedate=September 14, 2010 |df= }}/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2LAzT6FJs0 |title=The Holy Qur'an:the Truth Revealed Part 2 |accessdate=September 12, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212003741/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2LAzT6FJs0 |archivedate=December 12, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another founding member of the Center for Islamic Pluralism, Zuhdi Jasser, who is also the founder of the [[American Islamic Forum for Democracy]], a group of Muslim professionals in the Phoenix Valley of Arizona, strongly opposed the project, saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For us, a mosque was always a place to pray...not a way to make an ostentatious architectural statement. ''Ground Zero'' shouldn't be about promoting Islam. It's the place where war was declared on us as Americans."&lt;ref name="boston2"/&gt; ... American freedom of religion is a right, but … it is not right to make one's religion a global political statement with a towering Islamic edifice that casts a shadow over the memorials of Ground Zero. … Islamists in 'moderate' disguise are still Islamists. In their own more subtle ways, the WTC mosque organizers end up serving the same aims (as) separatist and supremacist wings of political Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Muslim Scholar: Don't Build Islamic Center |publisher=CBS News |date=September 11, 2010 |url=http://www.insideedition.com/news/4904/miss-usa-weighs-in-on-mosque-controversy.aspx |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821235121/http://www.insideedition.com/news/4904/miss-usa-weighs-in-on-mosque-controversy.aspx |archivedate=August 21, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neda Bolourchi, a Muslim whose mother died in 9/11, said: "I fear it would become a symbol of victory for militant Muslims around the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/06/AR2010080603006.html |author=Neda Bolourchi |title=A Muslim Victim of 9/11: 'Build your Mosque Somewhere Else{{'-}} |work=The Washington Post |date=August 5, 2010 |accessdate=August 7, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811032547/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/06/AR2010080603006.html |archivedate=August 11, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors [[Raheel Raza]] and [[Tarek Fatah]], board members of the [[Muslim Canadian Congress]], said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;New York currently boasts at least 30 mosques so it's not as if there is pressing need to find space for worshipers. [W]e Muslims know ... [this] mosque is meant to be a deliberate provocation to thumb our noses at the infidel. The proposal has been made in bad faith, ... as ''[[Fitna (word)|Fitna]]'', meaning "mischief-making" that is clearly forbidden in the Koran.... As Muslims we are dismayed that our co-religionists have such little consideration for their fellow citizens, and wish to rub salt in their wounds and pretend they are applying a balm to soothe the pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Raheel Raza |author2=Tarek Fatah |lastauthoramp=yes |url=http://www.ottawacitizen.com/sports/Mischief+Manhattan/3370303/story.html |title=Mischief in Manhattan |work=Ottawa Citizen |date=August 9, 2010 |archivedate=August 18, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818091927/http://www.ottawacitizen.com/sports/Mischief%2BManhattan/3370303/story.html |accessdate=January 2, 2012 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Akbar Ahmed]], Ibn Khaldun Chair of Islamic Studies at [[American University]], while noting that blaming all Muslims for 9/11 was "ridiculous", said:

&lt;blockquote&gt; I don't think the Muslim leadership has fully appreciated the impact of 9/11 on America. They assume Americans have forgotten 9/11 and even, in a profound way, forgiven 9/11, and that has not happened. The wounds remain largely open [...] and when wounds are raw, an episode like constructing a house of worship – even one protected by the Constitution, protected by law – becomes like salt in the wounds.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2010/08/05/u-s-muslims-underestimate-911-effect-muslim-thinker-warns/ |title=U.S. Muslims underestimate 9/11 effect, Muslim thinker warns |publisher=CNN |date=August 5, 2010 |accessdate=August 6, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806125639/http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2010/08/05/u-s-muslims-underestimate-911-effect-muslim-thinker-warns/ |archivedate=August 6, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Abdul Rahman Al-Rashid, general manager of [[Al-Arabiya]] television, also criticized the project in a column titled "A House of Worship or a Symbol of Destruction?" in the Arab daily A-Sharq Al-Awsat, saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Muslims do not aspire for a mosque next to the September 11 cemetery...the mosque is not an issue for Muslims, and they have not heard of it until the shouting became loud between the supporters and the objectors, which is mostly an argument between non-Muslim US citizens! &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Abdul Rahman Al-Rashid |url=http://aawsat.com/english/news.asp?section=2&amp;id=21980 |title=A House of Worship or a Symbol of Destruction? |work=[[Asharq Al-Awsat]] |date=August 16, 2010 |accessdate=August 30, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511083703/http://www.aawsat.com/english/news.asp?section=2&amp;id=21980 |archivedate=May 11, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="csmonitor.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Global-News/2010/0818/Ground-Zero-mosque-debate-swirls-in-world-capitals |title=Ground Zero mosque debate swirls in world capitals |work=The Christian Science Monitor |date=August 18, 2010 |accessdate=August 30, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902162513/http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Global-News/2010/0818/Ground-Zero-mosque-debate-swirls-in-world-capitals |archivedate=September 2, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Rima Fakih]], the first Muslim-American crowned [[Miss USA]] as [[Miss USA 2010]], opposed the project on the grounds of it being insensitive to families of 9/11 victims, telling ''[[Inside Edition]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;I totally agree with President Obama with the statement on the constitutional rights of freedom of religion. [But] it shouldn't be so close to the World Trade Center. We should be more concerned with the tragedy than religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Miss USA Weighs in on Mosque Controversy |work=Inside Edition |date=August 20, 2010 |url=http://www.insideedition.com/news/4904/miss-usa-weighs-in-on-mosque-controversy.aspx |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821235121/http://www.insideedition.com/news/4904/miss-usa-weighs-in-on-mosque-controversy.aspx |archivedate=August 21, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Democratic Representative Mike McMahon of New York's 13 District provided a written statement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We have seen very clearly in the past weeks that building a mosque two blocks from ground zero will not promote necessary interfaith dialogue, but will continue to fracture the faiths and citizens of our city and this country.

Democratic Representative Tim Bishop of New York's 1st District also disagrees with the location, "As a New Yorker, I believe Ground Zero is sacred ground and should unite us.

New York City fireman Tim Brown opposed the project, saying: "A mosque ... that's using foreign money from countries with ''[[shariah]]'' law is unacceptable, especially in this neighborhood".

Similarly, [[Pundit (expert)|political commentator]] [[Charles Krauthammer]] also criticized the construction, saying that it could potentially serve as a breeding ground for [[Islamic extremism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Build the mosque anywhere but Ground Zero |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2010/08/13/2010-08-13_build_it_anywhere_but_here.html#ixzz11h3ylplN |location=New York |work=Daily News |last=Krauthammer |first=Charles |date=August 12, 2010 |accessdate=September 20, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819024759/http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2010/08/13/2010-08-13_build_it_anywhere_but_here.html#ixzz11h3ylplN |archivedate=August 19, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 9, 2010, [[Greg Gutfeld]] stated that he planned on constructing New York City's first Islamic-friendly [[gay bar]] next to the proposed center. He stated that "As an American, I believe they have every right to build the mosque. [...] Which is, why, in the spirit of outreach, I've decided to do the same thing." He insisted that "this is not a joke," and further stated that the project was "an effort to break down barriers and reduce deadly [[homophobia]] in the Islamic world."&lt;ref name="Gutfeld-HuffPost"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/08/10/greg-gutfeld-im-opening-g_n_676699.html |title=Fox Newser: I'm Opening Gay Bar Next To Mosque |date=August 10, 2010 |publisher=[[The Huffington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2010/08/11/glenn-beck-greg-gutfeld-wants-to-build-gay-bar-next-to-ground-zero-mosque/ |title=Glenn Beck: Greg Gutfeld Wants To Build Gay Bar Next To 'Ground Zero' Mosque |date=August 11, 2010 |publisher=[[Fox News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2010/08/19/left-tired-response-to-ground-zero-mosque/ |title=Left's Tired Response To Ground Zero Mosque |author=Greg Gutfeld |date=August 19, 2010 |publisher=[[Fox News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/erecting_gay_bar_next_door_osyp6MY8mcK7BOgycwbyhN |title= Erecting a gay bar next door to Park51 |author=Jennifer Fermino |publisher=[[New York Post]] |date= August 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support===

Project supporters have argued that the Park51 building would not be visible from the World Trade Center site,&lt;ref name="NewYorker-16Aug"/&gt; and that some victims and victims' families have expressed support for the Park51 project, as well as acknowledging the fact that victims of the 9/11 attacks also included Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2010-09-03-1Amuslims911_CV_N.htm |title=For families of Muslim 9/11 victims, a new pain |author=Rick Hampton |newspaper=USA Today |date=September 9, 2010 |accessdate=September 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====9/11 families====
Some relatives of victims of the 9/11 attacks expressed support for the project. Colleen Kelley, who lost her brother William on 9/11, says, the "irony in the debate over the section of the building that would house a mosque is that one might assume that God (the same God to Jews-Christians-Muslims) would be pleased with any type of effort that involves prayer and service to others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.citylimits.org/conversations/111/mosque-debate-religious-intolerance |title=Not All 9-11 Families Oppose The Mosque |date=August 18, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821185609/http://www.citylimits.org/conversations/111/mosque-debate-religious-intolerance |archivedate=August 21, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orlando Rodriguez and Phyllis Schaefer Rodriguez, whose son died in the attack, say they "support the building of the Islamic community center in lower Manhattan" and "feel that it would honor our son and other victims".&lt;ref name=InOurSonsName&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inoursonsname.com/islamiccenter.html |title=Islamic center meant to foster peace, understanding |date=August 17, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ApQC0D2v?url=http://www.inoursonsname.com/islamiccenter.html |archivedate=September 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herb Ouida, whose son Todd died, said: "To say that we're going to condemn a religion and castigate a billion people in the world because they're Muslims, to say that they shouldn't have the ability to pray near the World Trade Center – I don't think that's going to bring people together and cross the divide."&lt;ref name="aolnews1"/&gt;

Marvin Bethea, a former EMS worker who was forced to retire in 2004 because of breathing problems caused by working at the 9/11 site, believes racism is a factor in the controversy, He said "even though my life has changed, I don't hate the Muslims. Especially being a black man, I know what it's like to be discriminated against. I've lived with that."&lt;ref name="aolnews1" /&gt;

Donna O'Connor, whose pregnant daughter died on 9/11, expressed the opinion that "This building will serve as an emblem for the rest of the world that Americans ... recognize that the evil acts of a few must never damn the innocent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www2.timesdispatch.com/news/2010/aug/06/ed-damaj06-ar-414971/ |title=Damaj: To Build or Not to Build a New Mosque in New York |author=M.

[[Theodore Olson|Ted Olson]], former [[Solicitor General of the United States|Solicitor General]] in the George W. Bush administration, whose wife, television commentator [[Barbara Olson]], died in the plane that crashed into [[the Pentagon]], has expressed support for the rights of the Park51 organizers to construct the new site. In remarks on [[MSNBC]], Olson said "we don't want to turn an act of hate against us by extremists into an act of intolerance for people of religious faith."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://amlawdaily.typepad.com/amlawdaily/2010/08/tedolsonmosque.html/ |title=Ted Olson Joins NYC Mosque Debate |author=Brian Baxter |work=The AmLaw Daily |date=August 18, 2010 |postscript= |accessdate=August 18, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922221509/http://amlawdaily.typepad.com/amlawdaily/2010/08/tedolsonmosque.html |archivedate=September 22, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ted Olson, Former Bush Solicitor General And Husband Of 9/11 Victim, Backs Obama On 'Ground Zero Mosque' |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/08/18/liz-cheneys-keep-america-_n_686697.html |date=August 18, 2010 |author=Nick Wing |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |postscript= |accessdate=August 20, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821112433/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/08/18/liz-cheneys-keep-america-_n_686697.html |archivedate=August 21, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruce Wallace, whose nephew died as he rushed in to help the victims, says "the media seems eager to trumpet the feelings of those hurt by the idea of the center. They mostly ignore my feelings and those, like me, who feel the center is an important step for Americans."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://121contact.typepad.com/my_weblog/2010/08/aug-8-2010-ground-zero-mosque-and-media-distortion-of-feelings.html |title='Ground Zero Mosque' and the media's distortion of feelings |date=August 8, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717120913/http://121contact.typepad.com/my_weblog/2010/08/aug-8-2010-ground-zero-mosque-and-media-distortion-of-feelings.html |archivedate=July 17, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judith Keane, whose husband was killed on 9/11, says "To punish a group of Americans who live in peace for the acts of a few is wrong.

Talat Hamdani, whose son was a first responder in the rescue effort and died in 9/11, co-wrote an article supporting the center in the interest of pluralism.&lt;ref name="newsweek1"/&gt; She has also criticized the argument about sensitivity arguing that it was more about the legality of the situation and "our rights as Americans. We are protected under the Constitution. There is freedom of religion." Implying that the ban could be the thin edge of the wedge she said "You know, if it's one faith today, it's going to be another faith tomorrow. That is scary. And to scapegoat the Muslims for the acts of a foreign terrorist, that is – that is hatred." She went on "...&amp;nbsp;if that argument is valid, then, by that token, [[Timothy McVeigh]]'s actions also makes all Christians terrorists. So, that is wrong."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2010/8/18/as_gop_and_some_top_dems |title=As GOP and Some Top Dems Unite in Opposing NY Islamic Community Center, a Roundtable Discussion with Mother of 9/11 Victim, Rabbi, Muslim Lawmaker and Islamic Scholar |work=Democracy Now! |accessdate=August 30, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821060206/http://www.democracynow.org/2010/8/18/as_gop_and_some_top_dems |archivedate=August 21, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anti-war group [[September 11th Families for Peaceful Tomorrows]], released a statement in support of the center, saying "we believe that welcoming the Center, which is intended to promote interfaith tolerance and respect, is consistent with fundamental American values of freedom and justice for all," adding it will be "an emblem for the rest of the world that Americans stand against violence, intolerance, and overt acts of racism and that we recognize that the evil acts of a few must never damn the innocent".&lt;ref name="boston3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peacefultomorrows.org/article.php?id=977 |title=9/11 Families Group Announces Support for Islamic Cultural Center in Lower Manhattan |date=May 20, 2010 |publisher=[[September 11th Families for Peaceful Tomorrows]] |accessdate=May 20, 2010 |postscript= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528022831/http://www.peacefultomorrows.org/article.php?id=977 |archivedate=May 28, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloomberg was asked if he was satisfied that "he is indeed a man of peace given his background where he's supposedly supported Hamas, blamed the U.S. for 9/11 attacks?" The mayor responded: 

&lt;/blockquote&gt;My job is not to vet clergy in this city.... Everybody has a right to their opinions.

Former Minnesota Governor [[Jesse Ventura]] gave his support to Park51, arguing that the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] allows for a mosque to be built near Ground Zero. Ventura also argued that denying the right for a mosque to be built near Ground Zero would be similar to removing churches from [[Oklahoma City]], where the [[Oklahoma City bombing]] occurred (the deadliest act of terrorism in the United States prior to 9/11), if [[Timothy McVeigh]], the man who perpetrated the attack, was a Christian. Ventura also demanded that opposition to the Ground Zero Mosque should be ignored because "people need to remember, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights should be written in stone. You cannot subject them to the popularity. They are there to protect unpopular things, like the First Amendment. The First Amendment is to protect unpopular speech simply because popular speech doesn't need to be protected. It's as simple as that. And you can't, you know, bend the Constitution to the blowing winds of whatever polls might say, otherwise it's a worthless, useless document which in many ways they're turning it to that anyway."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Transcripts |url=http://archives.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1010/15/cnr.08.html |publisher=CNN |accessdate=18 March 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921061424/http://archives.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1010/15/cnr.08.html |archivedate=21 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cohen]], professor of Jewish Civilization in the Near East in the Department of Near Eastern Studies at [[Princeton University]], opined that "The presence of ... mosques like the one planned near Ground Zero, which will be an educational center as well as a place of prayer, is one good way of transcending ... ignorance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Mark R.

Rabbi Geoffrey Dennis, of the [[University of North Texas]] Jewish Studies Program said that when it comes to the issue of freedom to practice religion in a private sphere, such as on a piece of private property in Lower Manhattan, [[freedom of religion]] is virtually inviolate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://religionblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2010/07/texas-faith-is-a-mosque-at-gro.html |title=Texas Faith: Is a mosque at Ground Zero religious freedom too far? |author=Wayne Slater |work=The Dallas Morning News |date=July 29, 2010 |accessdate=August 1, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723144149/http://religionblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2010/07/texas-faith-is-a-mosque-at-gro.html |archivedate=July 23, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hinduism}}
{{Hindu philosophy}}
The [[Upanishadic]] '''philosophy of experience''' expounded by [[Gaudapada]] is based on the cryptic references made by the sage of the [[Mandukya Upanishad]] to the experience of the individual self of its own apparent manifestations in the three fundamental states of consciousness, and to the Fourth known as [[Turiya]]. Turiya is identified with “that goal which all the Vedas declare” - सर्वे वेदा यत् पदमानन्ति ([[Katha Upanishad]] I.ii.15), and whose characteristics are not dissimilar to those of the non-dual [[Brahman]] ([[Mandukya Upanishad]] 7).

==Background==
[[Philosophy]], according to [[Gaudapada]] and [[Adi Sankara]], is an interpretation of the totality of human experience (''bhoga'') or of the whole of life from the standpoint of truth, and the object it seeks is the happiness (''sukham'') and welfare (''hitam'') of all beings (''sarva sattva'') in this world (''ihaiva''). Experience is participation in an event or connecting with a product of one’s own activities; an individual creates the world of his own experiences (''dristisristivada'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Intercultural Philosophy|author=Richard King|publisher=SUNY Press|page=61|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p1bASTAOhjoC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=experience+in+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lO8rU5b3EYLrrQfrkYDACg&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=experience%20in%20vedanta&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rishi Kutsa Angirasa ([[Rig Veda]] I.102.2) draws attention to the fact that no happiness can be derived as relating to the material world of objects without knowing each of the constituents of creation endowed with name, form and colour that have made all objects of faith and devotion. Rishi Kakshivan ([[Rig Veda]] I.116.11) points out the subtlety involved in these matters consisting in the fact that the happiness experienced or to be experienced is in the mind and not in the object of faith or pleasure. Participation involves work (effort) and knowledge. Therefore, a [[Rishi]] of the Rig Veda prays:-
: आ त्वां विश्न्त्वाशवः सोमास इन्द्र गिर्वणः |
: शन्ते सन्तु प्रचेतसे || (R.V. I.v.7)
: "May the objects possessed of active qualities required for accomplishing various aims and gains or results prove beneficial to those learned ones who are the doers of praise-worthy deeds, who factually know the objects as to their qualities, means or utility, and their scope."
Here, the Rishi refers to the experiencing of things (active qualities) and inevitable consequences (beneficial results), and also to the mental modes (factually know) . In a mantra ([[Rig Veda]] I.164.32),
: य ईं चकार न सो अस्य वेद य ईं ददर्श हिरुगिन्नु तस्मात् |
: स मातुर्योना परिवीतो अन्तर्बहुप्रजा निर्ऋतिमा विवेश ||
[[Rishi]] [[Dirghatamas]] tells us that he who is engaged in works alone does not know his own form, but he who does and sees actions and knows his form, nature etc., is different who remaining different re-enters protectively in his mother’s womb returns to earth and re-engages again and again in auspicious works and actions. In this manner the Rishi speaks of two distinct experiences – one which is yet to be experienced and the other which is already being experienced repeatedly; the experience which is yet to be experienced is what the Creator does, who creates for creation sake without being concerned about the results of his actions because His actions do not bind Him to anything, who continues to behave as though He is not aware of anything else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illumination of Knowledge|author=Ravinder Kumar Soni|publisher=GBD Books|pages=199–200,17,252|url= http://www.worldcat.org/title/illumination-of-knowledge-a-brief-reflection-on-the-role-of-agni-the-vedic-god-of-fire/oclc/470877223 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient concept of [[Ṛta]] expresses the idea of a regulative principle in nature and human society; the cosmic energies ([[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]]), hostile forces ([[Asura]]s) and different spirits ([[Gandharva]]s and [[Apsara]]s), all are subject to Rta. All actions contribute to maintaining the cosmic order in balance through liturgy; the cosmic order is the manifestation of the Ultimate Reality ([[Brahman]]) which is Truth ([[Satya]]). The Rig Veda (X.85.1-2) celebrates the relationship between truth and cosmic law (Ṛta). The Rig Veda (VII.56.12) also gives the equation of cosmic law (Ṛta) and truth (Satya), it was by observing the cosmic law the rishis reached the truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Upanishads Vol.I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jj8LAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=satya+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o7xEU8LECIWQrgfS7IDwBQ&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=satya%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Satya'' signifies that which is eternal, the supreme, Existence in its own form ''Sat''; ''rtam'' signifies that which is evident or perceptible, manifested out of the ''satya'', what has come to be in accordance with ''satya'' or that which represents ''satya''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Upanishads|author=IslamKotob|publisher=Islamic Books|page=68|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ONHwyglLcAMC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=satya+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o7xEU8LECIWQrgfS7IDwBQ&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=satya%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The entire philosophy of the [[Upanishads]], is based on the direct experience of the Vedic people; it is concerned with that knowledge which is common to all experience, everywhere, and not only to some specialized exclusive area of experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Upanishads: An Introduction|author=Ananda Wood|publisher=Islamic Books|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N6Y7MTBjWOEC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=experience+in+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wvIrU4-GJcKOrgfOioHoCg&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=experience%20in%20upanishads&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaudapada, who rediscovered the '''Philosophy of Experience''' and wrote his ''Karika'' on the [[Mandukya Upanishad]], too emphasises upon the impossibility of reaching the highest truth unless the totality of human experience or knowledge are taken into consideration and that the experiences in the waking state are required to be matched with the experiences in the other states of consciousness so that the individual inquiry is extended to the possible source of all consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Companion Encyclopaedia of Hindu Philosophy|author=Subodh Kapoor|publisher=Genesis Publishing|page=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JZWdEymxyp4C&amp;pg=PA390&amp;dq=philosophy+of+experience+gaudapada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TV0qU43HF8GGrgepyICIBQ&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=philosophy%20of%20experience%20gaudapada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gaudapada’s interpretation of Maya==
[[Ajativada]], doctrine that there is no birth or production of substantial or fully real things anywhere or at any time, and therefore no real objective world outside consciousness, is central to Gaudapada who holds that all sensory and mental experience, except the experience of content-less consciousness, is illusion or ''[[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]'', which doctrine of ''Maya'' is in conformity with the [[Vedanta|Vedantic reaches and conclusions]] regarding the sole ever-existing eternal real entity (''paramarthatah''), [[Brahman]], which has nothing different from it, and none whatever outside it (''[[Nondualism|advaita]]''), whose reality can be known ('experienced') through the cultivated meditative experience of non-dual consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dispelling Delusion|author=Douglas A. Fox|publisher=SUNY Press|pages=24,40–41|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=W4uQY3666I4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=philosophy+of+experience+gaudapada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TV0qU43HF8GGrgepyICIBQ&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=philosophy%20of%20experience%20gaudapada&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; He maintains the doctrine that the universe was not created at all but takes some cognisance at least of the world as real, though it may be for the perfection of mystical endeavour or ethical conduct even though, philosophically, he may regard it as not having been created at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Constructive Survey of Upanishadic Philosophy|author=R.D.Ranade|publisher=Bharatiya vidya Bhavan|page=166|url=https://archive.org/details/A.Constructive.Survey.of.Upanishadic.Philosophy.by.R.D.Ranade.1926.djvu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gaudapada’s concept of experience==
[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] (II.iii.4-5) tells us that the essence of that which is gross, mortal, limited and defined is the eye, which means that the mental mode associated with comparison is connected with the eye which perceives things and qualities and gives rise to duality and multiplicity i.e. separateness; the eye is the Sun which is the defined but the defined is that which moves within the eye. Gaudapada explores the transcendences by the Self of the three states detailed by the Upanishads and speaks about [[Vaishvanara]], the all-pervading and met with the eye, experiencing the external things; [[Taijasa]] which is inside the mind, as experiencing the inner things and [[Prajna (Vedic)|Prajna]] is the mass of consciousness in the space within the heart, all three interlinked by memory as "I". In this context, [[Adi Sankara|Sankara]] explains that on cessation of the activity called memory Prajna becomes free from diversity and there is no functioning of the mind; perception and recollection are merely vibrations of the mind; in the absence of these there is merely existence of an un-manifested state in the heart. Therefore, the indescribable state of Turiya, is neither a void nor an unreal illusion without a substratum, and is held to be the all-pervasive source of all entities. Vaishvanara and Taijasa are held to be conditioned by cause and effect; Prajna is conditioned by cause, but cause and effect do not exist in Turiya. Cause and effect spring into being so long as there is mental preoccupation with cause and effect; there is no origination of cause and effect when engrossment with cause and effect becomes attenuated. As long as there is mental preoccupation with causality so long does the worldly state continue; when engrossment with causality is exhausted, one does not attain the worldly state. Everything seems to be born because of the empirical outlook; therefore there is nothing eternal; from the standpoint of Reality, everything is the birthless Self; therefore there is no such thing as annihilation (Karika VI.55-57).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Eight Upanishads Vol.2|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|pages=193–203,212–213,369–371|url= http://www.chennaimath.org/istore/product/eight-upanishads-vol-2-gambhirananda/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Apparent manifestations of the self==
Gaudapada begins with the three apparent manifestations of the self – 1) as the 'experiencer' of the external world in the '''Waking state''' (''visva'' or ''[[Vaishvanara]] atman''), 2) as the 'experiencer' in the '''Dream state''' (''[[Taijasa]] atman'') and as the 'experiencer' in '''Deep sleep state''' or ''susupti'' ([[Prajna (Vedic)|Prajna]]) when there is no determinate knowledge, but pure consciousness and pure bliss or ''[[Ānanda (Hindu philosophy)|ananda]]''; the person who knows these three as one is never attached to these experiences. He also describes the Fourth state of the self ([[Turiya]]) which is ''advaita'' ('non-dual') and the All. In the Waking state things are imagined as if existing outside, and in the Dream state, things are imagined internally, both of them are illusory creations of the self; truth is that reality which is perceived as the imagination-less cessation of all appearances (''nirvikalpah prapancopasamah''). The thing that has beginning and an end is false; the existing of things is illusory; things exist only as far as they merely appear or are related to experience and as merely thoughts with which fools are deluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Indian Philosophy Vol.1|author=Surendranath Dasgupta|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=424,426,428|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PoaMFmS1_lEC&amp;pg=PA424&amp;dq=philosophy+of+experience+gaudapada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TV0qU43HF8GGrgepyICIBQ&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=philosophy%20of%20experience%20gaudapada&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gaudapada’s examination of the experience of the experiencing self==
Gaudapada points out that the unchangeable reality is the witness behind the three states of consciousness, waking, dreaming, and dreamless sleep, in all these states the Self is ever-present, and though remaining unknown is the unaffected 'experiencer' of all actions and thoughts in these three states. In deep sleep the mind is withdrawn and does not know anything, but it is disciplined and not withdrawn in ''turiya'', existent and all-seeing. When the individual self, sleeping under the influence of ''maya'' ('ignorance'), is awakened, it then realizes non-duality which is beginning-less and endless; this is the way to illumination within one’s own soul to realize supreme bliss. Gaudapada insists that the mind should not be allowed to enjoy the bliss that arises out of the condition of absorption. It should be freed from attachment to such happiness through the exercise of discrimination. When the mind does not lose itself in inactivity and oblivion, or is not distracted by desires, when the mind achieves quietness and does not give rise to appearances, it verily becomes Brahman. The waking and the dreaming states are equally real and equally unreal, real only in relative sense and unreal as compared with the transcendental in which there is identification with Reality, the unchangeable Self. There is no absolute reality of creation, the one infinite Existence appears to be the manifold universe which universe is not a reality but something superimposed upon the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]. Bondage and liberation, the individual soul and the world, are all unreal. The supreme bliss is the very nature of the Atman, an absolute reality which persists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Spiritual Heritage of India|author= Swami Prabhavananda|publisher=Vedanta Press|pages=276–278|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zupDCwE73O0C&amp;pg=PA275&amp;dq=philosophy+of+experience+gaudapada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TV0qU43HF8GGrgepyICIBQ&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patanjali’s concept of experience==
[[Patanjali]] tells us that experiences of pleasure and pain are the fruits of merit and demerit, respectively; pain is caused by false identification of the experiencer with the object of experience, and the pain which is yet to come may be avoided. The "experiencer" is the Atman, the real human nature, and the "object of experience" is the totality of the apparent world, including the mind and the senses; so long as the experiencer is falsely identified with the object of experience the Atman cannot be known. [[Patanjali]] states – अभाव – प्रत्ययालम्बना वृत्तिर्निद्रा ([[Yoga Sutra]] I.10) that "sleep is a wave of thought about nothingness", which means sleep is a positive experience of nothingness, when the already perceived objects are not forgotten but as experiences unite themselves to the system which existed at the time of going to sleep, in that state there is continuity of experience and the function of remembering is not reduced to utter confusion. He explains that the mind having innumerable impressions and desires acts only to serve the Atman and is able to perceive because it reflects both the Atman and the objects of perception, it cannot act independently for its own sake. The man of discrimination ceases to regard the mind as the Atman, and moves towards liberation. Distractions due to past impressions may arise if the mind relaxes its discrimination, even a little but can be overcome in the same manner as obstacles to enlightenment, that is, by resolving the mind back into its primal cause through meditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Patanjali Yoga Sutras|publisher=Sri Ramakrishna Math|pages=9,160–162,83–85|url=http://www.chennaimath.org/istore/product/patanjali-yoga-sutras/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patanjali tells us – तस्य सप्तधा प्रान्तभूमिः प्रज्ञा ([[Yoga Sutras]] II.27) that the experiencer gains the knowledge of the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] in seven stages, advancing towards the highest beginning with - a) the realization that the source of all spiritual wisdom is inside us, and proceeding to b) when attachments and aversions lose their power, to c) complete realization of, and union with the Atman when the objective universe disappears, to d) when the man of illumination no longer identifies the external world with the Atman, to e) when the mind and the objective world ends their services to the experiencer, to f) when the stored-up impressions within the mind and the [[guna]]s fall away forever, and finally to g) when the state of eternal existence in union with the Atman is reached. [[Swami Prabhavananda]] in connection with Yoga Sutra II.50 tells us that [[Prana]] is the vital energy by which we live and all the powers of the body and all the functions of the senses  and the mind are expressions of the force of Prana; when the [[Kundalini]] is aroused it produces various degrees of enlightenment experienced by the experiencer at seven centers  – according to [[Raja yoga]] when the mind is attached to worldliness, when it dwells in three lower centers, it has no higher spiritual ambitions or visions and stays immersed in the cravings of lust and greed; the fourth center is the heart dwelling wherein the mind makes one experience the first spiritual awakening and is filled with wonder and awe; the mind reaching the fifth center, the throat, makes one freed from ignorance and delusion; with the mind reaching the sixth center, the forehead, there is the direct vision of the Lord; and when the mind reaches the seventh center at the top of the head, [[Samadhi]] is attained. These are the seven gradual yogic experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Patanjali Yoga Sutras|publisher=Sri Ramakrishna Math|pages=92–95, 115–116|url= http://www.chennaimath.org/istore/product/patanjali-yoga-sutras/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implication==
In response to his query – "Which is the deity who experiences dream?" – Surya was told - अत्रैष देवः स्वप्ने महिमानमनुभवति – "In the dream state the deity, the mind, experiences greatness (consisting in assuming diverse forms of subject and object)" ([[Prasna Upanishad]] IV.5); the mind is the instrument of the perceiver in the matter of experiencing greatness, and Sankara explains that the individual soul conditioned by the mind only appears to experience things in its wakefulness and in the dream-state. The body and senses depend on ignorance, desire, and the result of past actions, when these become quiet the nature of the Self becomes non-dual, auspicious and calm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Eight Upanishads Vol.2|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|pages=456–462|url= http://www.chennaimath.org/istore/product/eight-upanishads-vol-2-gambhirananda/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The common experience of Duality, which contains truth and untruth, is produced by the power of illusion (''Maya''), it is only through religious activities that are features of duality – based experiences that the understanding and attainment of the supreme non-dual becomes possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Asian Philosophy|author=Oliver Leaman|publisher=Routledge|page=217|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aWwptHSgGhoC&amp;pg=PA217&amp;dq=philosophy+of+experience+gaudapada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TV0qU43HF8GGrgepyICIBQ&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=philosophy%20of%20experience%20gaudapada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaudapada and Sankara relate ''māyā'' to the Vedic metaphor of hidden (''gūdha'') Brahman ([[Katha Upanishad]] (I.iii.12)).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shankara and Indian Philosophy|author=N.V.Isaeva|publisher=SUNY Press|page=52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hshaWu0m1D4C&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=philosophy+of+experience+gaudapada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TV0qU43HF8GGrgepyICIBQ&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=philosophy%20of%20experience%20gaudapada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaudapada shows that it is only the existent that can appear, the non-existent cannot appear. Sankara tells us that the common experience depends on ''[[adhyasa]]'' (cognition of 'that' in 'not-that'), on something superimposed, and which is a transcendental error or ''[[Avidya (Hinduism)|avidya]]''. ''[[Dvaita]]'' in whatever form is perceived by the mind, duality ceases when the mind ceases to exist and function as the mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in Jaina Philosophy|author=Nathmal Tatia|publisher=Jain Publishing|pages=119–120|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DZ7IwbORbLgC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;dq=philosophy+of+experience+gaudapada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JmIqU8ylJNHRrQfq8oCgCg&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=philosophy%20of%20experience%20gaudapada&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; And, Sankara concedes that the ''[[Samadhi]]''  experience ('Transcendental Consciousness'), which describes the state devoid of cognitive functioning, will not be established, if the phenomenal self is not considered distinct from the cognitive faculty which faculty cannot be an agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Free Will, Agency and Selfhood in Indian Philosophy|author=|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=195|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iWLSAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA188&amp;dq=philosophy+of+experience+gaudapada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IWMqU4ynIcbsrAeLroHABg&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=philosophy%20of%20experience%20gaudapada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sankara insists:

:सङ्घातोऽपि तथा नाहमिति दृश्यविलक्षणम् |
:दृष्टारमनुमानेन निपुणं सम्प्रधारय ||

:"Similarly be sure that you are not the complex of the gross and the subtle-bodies, and intelligently determine, by inference, that you, the ‘seer’, are entirely distinct from the seen" ([[Vakya Vritti]].Sl. 17)

which means that a person should firmly ascertain that in himself he is something other than the gross and the subtle bodies. In his commentary on this statement, [[Swami Chinmayananda]] tells us that the misapprehension that the products of matter, such as body, mind and intellect, are the Self, is an experience caused by the non-apprehension of the Spiritual Essence; the non-apprehension of the Supreme Self in all its supreme transcendental resplendency, generates endless misapprehensions which are to be removed by invoking knowledge, the direct apprehension of the Self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vakya Vritti of Adi Sankara 1991 ed.|publisher=Central Chinmaya Mission Trust|page=39|url= http://www.worldcat.org/title/vakya-vritti-of-adi-sankara-text-with-translation-and-commentary-by-swami-chinmayananda/oclc/248649509/editions?referer=di&amp;editionsView=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Sankara, [[Ramanuja]] does not admit a distinction between illusory perception and true perception, for he declares that even in illusory perception, so-called, there is some perception of reality. Thus all experience has its validity. The immediate intuition of God is not the highest transcendental consciousness (Turiya) but rather it is the transcendental experience of God in which there remains the ego as distinct from him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Spiritual Heritage of India|author=Swami Prabhavananda|publisher=Sri Ramakrishna Math|page=308|url= http://www.chennaimath.org/istore/product/spiritual-heritage-of-india/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ramachandra Dattatrya Ranade|R.D.Ranade]] states that the Upanishadic seers throw hints and suggest the way for realizing the Self, only too cognizant of the fact that any description of the great mystic experience by word of mouth would fall short of reality, as much as any mediate, intellectual, or expressible knowledge would fall short of immediate, intuitive, first-hand experience. There is the same gulf between the expression of an experience and the enjoyment of it, as there is between knowledge and being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Constructive Survey of Upanishadic Philosophy|author=R.D.Ranade|publisher= Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|page=239|url=https://archive.org/details/A.Constructive.Survey.of.Upanishadic.Philosophy.by.R.D.Ranade.1926.djvu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{MahayanaBuddhism}}
'''Prajñāpāramitā''' means "the Perfection of (Transcendent) Wisdom" in [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna Buddhism]]. Prajñāpāramitā refers to this perfected way of seeing the nature of reality, as well as to a particular body of [[sutra]]s and to the personification of the concept in the [[Bodhisattva]] known as the "Great Mother" (Tibetan: Yum Chenmo). The word ''Prajñāpāramitā'' combines the [[Sanskrit]] words ''[[Prajñā (Buddhism)|prajñā]]'' "wisdom" with ''[[pāramitā]]'' "perfection". Prajñāpāramitā is a central concept in [[Mahāyāna Buddhism]] and is generally associated with the doctrine of emptiness ([[Shunyata]]) or 'lack of [[Svabhava]]' (essence) and the works of [[Nagarjuna]]. Its practice and understanding are taken to be indispensable elements of the [[Bodhisattva]] path.

According to [[Edward Conze]], the Prajñāpāramitā Sutras are "a collection of about forty texts ... composed somewhere around Indian subcontinent between approximately 100 BC and AD 600."&lt;ref&gt;Conze, E. Perfect Wisdom: The Short Prajnaparamita Texts, Buddhist Publishing Group, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Some Prajnāpāramitā sūtras are thought to be among the earliest [[Mahāyāna sūtras]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Buddhist Thought.'' Routledge, 2000, pages 131.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations 2nd edition.'' Routledge, 2009, pg. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the important features of the Prajñāpāramitā Sutras is [[anutpada]] (unborn, no origin).&lt;ref&gt;Buswell, Robert; Lopez, Donald S. Jr., eds. (2014), ''The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism'', Princeton University Press pg. 945   "In the PRAJÑĀPĀRAMITĀ literature and the MADHYAMAKA school,  the notion of production comes under specific criticism  (see VAJRAKAṆĀ),  with NĀGĀRJUNA famously asking,  e.g.,  how an effect can be produced from a cause that is either the same as or different from itself.  The prajñāpāramitā sūtras thus famously declare that all dharmas are actually ANUTPĀDA,  or “unproduced.”"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;King, Richard (1995), ''Early Advaita Vedānta and Buddhism: The Mahāyāna Context of the Gauḍapādīya-kārikā'', SUNY Press pg.113 "It is equally apparent that one of the important features of the Prajnaparamita positition is that of the nonarising (anutpada) of dharmas."&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Earliest texts===

====''{{IAST|Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā}}''====
Western scholars have traditionally considered the earliest sūtra in the Prajñāpāramitā class to be the ''Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'' or "Perfection of Wisdom in 8,000 Lines", which was probably put in writing in the 1st century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Mäll, Linnart. ''Studies in the Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā and other essays.'' 2005. p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; This chronology is based on the views of [[Edward Conze]], who largely considered dates of translation into other languages. This text also has a corresponding version in verse format, called the ''{{IAST|Ratnaguṇasaṃcaya Gāthā}}'', which some believe to be slightly older because it is not written in standard literary Sanskrit. However, these findings rely on late-dating Indian texts, in which verses and mantras are often kept in more archaic forms.

Additionally, a number of scholars have proposed that the Mahāyāna Prajñāpāramitā teachings were first developed by the [[Caitika]] subsect of the [[Mahāsāṃghika]]s. They believe that the ''Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'' originated amongst the southern Mahāsāṃghika schools of the [[Coastal Andhra|Āndhra]] region, along the [[Krishna River|Kṛṣṇa River]].&lt;ref&gt;Guang Xing. ''The Concept of the Buddha: Its Evolution from Early Buddhism to the Trikaya Theory.'' 2004. pp. 65-66 "Several scholars have suggested that the Prajnaparamita probably developed among the Mahasamghikas in Southern India, in the Andhra country, on the Krsna River."&lt;/ref&gt; These Mahāsāṃghikas had two famous monasteries near [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amarāvati]] and the [[Dharanikota|Dhānyakataka]], which gave their names to the Pūrvaśaila and Aparaśaila schools.&lt;ref name="Guang Xing 2004. p. 66"/&gt; Each of these schools had a copy of the ''Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'' in [[Prakrit]].&lt;ref name="Guang Xing 2004. p. 66"&gt;Guang Xing. ''The Concept of the Buddha: Its Evolution from Early Buddhism to the Trikaya Theory.'' 2004. p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; Guang Xing also assesses the view of the Buddha given in the ''Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'' as being that of the Mahāsāṃghikas.&lt;ref name="Guang Xing 2004. p. 66"/&gt; [[Edward Conze]] estimates that this sūtra originated around 100 BCE.&lt;ref name="Guang Xing 2004. p. 66"/&gt;

In 2012, Harry Falk and Seishi Karashima published a damaged and partial [[Kharosthi|Kharoṣṭhī]] manuscript of the ''Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā''.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Falk and Seishi Karashima, [https://web.archive.org/web/20131004225647/http://iriab.soka.ac.jp/orc/Publications/ARIRIAB/pdf/ARIRIAB-15.pdf A first‐century Prajñāpāramitā manuscript from Gandhāra&amp;nbsp;— parivarta 1 (Texts from the Split Collection 1)]. Annual Report of the International Research Institute for Advanced Buddhology at Soka University XV (2012), 19-61.&lt;/ref&gt; It is [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dated]] to ca. 75 CE, making it one of the oldest Buddhist texts in existence. It is very similar to the first Chinese translation of the ''Aṣṭasāhasrikā'' by [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokakṣema]] (ca. 179 CE) whose source text is assumed to be in the [[Gāndhārī language]];Lokakṣema's translation is also the first extant translation of the Prajñāpāramitā genre into a non-Indic language. Comparison with the standard Sanskrit text shows that it is also likely to be a translation from Gāndhāri as it expands on many phrases and provides glosses for words that are not present in the Gāndhārī. This points to the text being composed in Gāndhārī, the language of [[Gandhara]] (the region now called the Northwest Frontier of Pakistan, including [[Peshawar]], [[Taxila]] and [[Swat Valley]]). The "Split" manuscript is evidently a copy of an earlier text, confirming that the text may date before the first century of the common era.


====''Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā''====
In contrast to western scholarship, Japanese scholars have traditionally considered the ''[[Diamond Sutra|Diamond Sūtra]]'' (''Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'') to be from a very early date in the development of Prajñāpāramitā literature.&lt;ref name="Williams, Paul 1989 p.42"&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Mahāyāna Buddhism: the Doctrinal Foundations''. London, UK: Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-02537-0}}. p.42&lt;/ref&gt; The usual reason for this relative chronology which places the ''Vajracchedikā'' earlier is not its date of translation, but rather a comparison of the contents and themes.&lt;ref&gt;Schopen, Gregory. ''Figments and Fragments of Mahāyāna Buddhism in India.'' 2005. p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Some western scholars also believe that the ''Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'' was adapted from the earlier ''Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra''.&lt;ref name="Williams, Paul 1989 p.42" /&gt;

Examining the language and phrases used in both the ''Aṣṭasāhasrikā'' and the ''Vajracchedikā'', [[Gregory Schopen]] also sees the ''Vajracchedikā'' as being earlier than the ''Aṣṭasāhasrikā''.&lt;ref name="Schopen, Gregory 2005. pp. 31-32"&gt;Schopen, Gregory. ''Figments and Fragments of Mahāyāna Buddhism in India.'' 2005. pp. 31-32&lt;/ref&gt; This view is taken in part by examining parallels between the two works, in which the ''Aṣṭasāhasrikā'' seems to represent the later or more developed position.&lt;ref name="Schopen, Gregory 2005. pp. 31-32"/&gt; According to Schopen, these works also show a shift in emphasis from an oral tradition (''Vajracchedikā'') to a written tradition (''Aṣṭasāhasrikā'').&lt;ref name="Schopen, Gregory 2005. pp. 31-32"/&gt;

===Overview of the Prajñāpāramitā sūtras===
[[File:Arapacana manjusri - AP State archaeological museum (1).jpg|thumb|Arapacana manjusri with prajnaparamita in his right hand. Statue belongs to 18 CAD, Tibet. Currently at YSR state archaeological museum|349x349px]]
An Indian commentary on the ''[[Mahāyāna-samgraha|Mahāyānasaṃgraha]]'', entitled ''Vivṛtaguhyārthapiṇḍavyākhyā'', gives a classification of teachings according to the capabilities of the audience:
{{quote|[A]ccording to disciples' grades, the Dharma is [classified as] inferior and superior. For example, the inferior was taught to the merchants [[Trapusa and Bahalika|Trapuṣa and Ballika]] because they were ordinary men; the middle was taught to the group of five because they were at the stage of saints; the eightfold ''Prajñāpāramitās'' were taught to bodhisattvas, and [the ''Prajñāpāramitās''] are superior in eliminating conceptually imagined forms. The eightfold [''Prajñāpāramitās''] are the teachings of the Prajñāpāramitā as follows: the ''Triśatikā'', ''Pañcaśatikā'', ''Saptaśatikā'', ''Sārdhadvisāhasrikā'', ''Aṣṭasāhasrikā'', ''Aṣṭadaśasāhasrikā'', ''Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā'', and ''Śatasāhasrikā''.&lt;ref&gt;Hamar, Imre. ''Reflecting Mirrors: Perspectives on Huayan Buddhism.'' 2007. p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The titles of these eight Prajñāpāramitā texts are given according to their length. The texts may have other Sanskrit titles as well, or different variations which may be more descriptive. The lengths specified by the titles are given below.

# ''Triśatikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'': 300 lines, alternatively known as the ''[[Diamond Sutra|Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra]]'' (''Diamond Sūtra'')
# ''Pañcaśatikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'': 500 lines
# ''Saptaśatikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'': 700 lines, the bodhisattva [[Manjusri|Mañjuśrī]]'s exposition of Prajñāpāramitā
# ''Sārdhadvisāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'': 2500 lines, from the questions of Suvikrāntavikrāmin Bodhisattva
# ''Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'': 8000 lines
# ''Aṣṭadaśasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'': 18,000 lines
# ''Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'': 25,000 lines, alternatively known as the ''[[Mahaprajnaparamita Sutra|Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra]]''{{citation needed|reason=It is unclear whether the 25,000-line sutra or the 100,000-line sutra is alternatively referred to as the Mahaprajnaparamita Sutra|date=May 2015}}
# ''Śatasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'': 100,000 lines, alternatively known as the ''[[Mahaprajnaparamita Sutra|Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra]]''{{citation needed|reason=It is unclear whether the 25,000-line sutra or the 100,000-line sutra is alternatively referred to as the Mahaprajnaparamita Sutra|date=May 2015}}

According to Joseph Walser, there is evidence that the ''Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'' (25,000 lines) and the ''Śatasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'' (100,000 lines) have a connection with the [[Dharmaguptaka]] sect, while the ''Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'' (8000 lines) does not.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Mahāyāna Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations.'' 2008. p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these, there are also other Prajñāpāramitā sūtras such as the ''[[Heart Sutra]]'' (''Prajñāpāramitā Hṛdaya''), which exists in a shorter and longer versions. Regarding the shorter texts, Edward Conze writes, "Two of these, the ''Diamond Sūtra'' and the ''Heart Sūtra'' are in a class by themselves and deservedly renowned throughout the world of Northern Buddhism. Both have been translated into many languages and have often been commented upon.".&lt;ref&gt;Conze, Edward. ''The Short Prajñāpāramitā Texts.'' 1973. p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars consider the Diamond Sutra to be much earlier than Conze does.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. Mahāyāna Buddhism: the Doctrinal Foundations. London, UK: Routledge. p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Jan Nattier argues the Heart Sutra to be an apocryphal text composed in China from extracts of the Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā and other texts ca 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Nattier. 1992. The Heart Sūtra : a Chinese apocryphal text? Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies. Vol. 15 (2), p.153-223.&lt;/ref&gt; Red Pine, however, does not support Nattiers argument and believes the Prajnaparamita Hridaya Sutra to be of Indian origin.&lt;ref&gt;"The Heart Sutra Translation and Commentary", 2004. p.22-24&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tantra|Tāntric]] versions of the Prajñāpāramitā literature were produced from the year 500 CE on and include sutras such as the Adhyardhaśatikā Prajñāpāramitā (150 lines). Additionally, Prajñāpāramitā [[Terma (religion)|terma]] teachings are held by some [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhists]] to have been conferred upon [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]] by the [[Nagaraja|Nāgarāja]] "King of the [[Nāga]]s", who had been guarding them at the bottom of the sea.

===Commentaries and translations===
There are various Indian and later Chinese commentaries on the Prajñāpāramitā sutras, some of the most influential commentaries include:

*''[[Mahāprajñāpāramitāupadeśa]]'' (大智度論, T no. 1509) a massive and encyclopedic text translated into Chinese by the Buddhist scholar [[Kumarajiva]] (344–413 CE). It is a commentary on the ''Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā''. This text claims to be from the Buddhist philosopher [[Nagarjuna]] (c. 2nd century) in the [[colophon (publishing)|colophon]], but various scholars such as [[Etienne Lamotte]] have questioned this attribution. This work was translated by Lamotte as ''Le Traité de la Grande Vertu de Sagesse'' and into English from the French by Gelongma Karma Migme Chodron.&lt;ref&gt;Lamotte, Etienne; Gelongma Karma Migme Chodron. THE TREATISE ON THE GREAT VIRTUE OF WISDOM OF NĀGĀRJUNA (MAHĀPRAJÑĀPĀRAMITĀŚĀSTRA) VOL. I CHAPTERS I – XV COMPOSED BY THE BODHISATTVE NĀGĀRJUNA AND TRANSLATED BY THE TRIPIṬAKADHARMĀCĀRYA KUMĀRAJIVA OF THE LAND OF KOUTCHA UNDER THE LATER TS’IN&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Abhisamayalamkara|Abhisamayālaṅkāra]]'' (''Ornament of clear realization''), the central ''Prajñāpāramitā'' shastra in the Tibetan tradition. It is traditionally attributed as a revelation from the Bodhisattva [[Maitreya]] to the scholar [[Asanga]] ([[Floruit|fl.]] 4th century C.E.), known as a master of the [[Yogacara|Yogācāra]] school. The Indian commentary on this text by [[Haribhadra (Buddhist philosopher)|Haribadra]], the [[Abhisamayalankaraloka]], has also been influential on later Tibetan texts.
*''Śatasāhasrikā-pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikāṣṭādaśasāhasrikā-prajñāpāramitā-bṛhaṭṭīkā'', often attributed to [[Vasubandhu]] (4th century).&lt;ref&gt;Karl Brunnhölzl "Prajñāpāramitā, Indian “gzhan ston pas“, And the Beginning of Tibetan gzhan stong" (2011) 197p. https://www.istb.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/wstb/wstb.cgi?ID=78&amp;show_description=1&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Satasahasrika-paramita-brhattika'', attributed to [[Damstrásena]].
*[[Dignaga]]'s ''Prajnaparamitarthasamgraha-karika''.
*[[Ratnākaraśānti]]'s ''Prajñāpāramitopadeśa''.

The sutras were first brought to [[Tibet]] in the reign of [[Trisong Detsen]] (742-796) by scholars [[Jinamitra]] and [[Silendrabodhi]] and the translator Yeshe De.&lt;ref name="Brunnholzl, Karl 2011, page 42"&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl; Gone Beyond: The Prajnaparamita Sutras The Ornament Of Clear Realization And Its Commentaries In The Tibetan Kagyu Tradition (Tsadra) 2011, page 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prajñāpāramitā in Central Asia===
{{see also|Buddhism in Central Asia}}

By the middle of the 3rd century CE, it appears that some Prajñāpāramitā texts were known in [[Central Asia]], as reported by the Chinese monk Zhu Shixing, who brought back a manuscript of the ''Prajñāpāramitā'' of 25,000 lines:&lt;ref&gt;Heirman, Ann. Bumbacher, Stephan Peter. ''The Spread of Buddhism.'' 2007. p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|When in 260 AD, the Chinese monk Zhu Shixing chose to go to [[Kingdom of Khotan|Khotan]] in an attempt to find original Sanskrit ''sūtras'', he succeeded in locating the Sanskrit ''Prajñāpāramitā'' in 25,000 verses, and tried to send it to China. In Khotan, however, there were numerous [[Hinayana|Hīnayānists]] who attempted to prevent it because they regarded the text as [[heterodox]]. Eventually, Zhu Shixing stayed in Khotan, but sent the manuscript to [[Luoyang]] where it was translated by a Khotanese monk named Mokṣala. In 296, the Khotanese monk Gītamitra came to [[Chang'an]] with another copy of the same text.}}

===China===
In China, there was extensive translations of many Prajñāpāramitā texts beginning in the second century CE, main translators include: [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokakṣema]] (支婁迦讖), Zhī Qīan (支謙), [[Dharmarakṣa]] (竺法護), Mokṣala (無叉羅), [[Kumārajīva]] (鳩摩羅什, 408 CE), [[Xuánzàng]] (玄奘), Făxián (法賢) and Dānapāla (施護).&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, M.

Retrieved from https://dx.doi.org/10.5353/th_b4775259&lt;/ref&gt; These translations were very influential in the development of [[East Asian Mādhyamaka]] and on [[Chinese Buddhism]].

[[Xuanzang]] (fl. c. 602–664) was a Chinese scholar who traveled to India and returned to China with three copies of the ''Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra'' which he had secured from his extensive travels.&lt;ref name="Wriggins, Sally Hovey 2004 p.206"&gt;Wriggins, Sally Hovey (2004).

Boulder, Colorado: WestviewPress. {{ISBN|0-8133-6599-6}}. p.206&lt;/ref&gt; Xuanzang, with a team of disciple translators, commenced translating the voluminous work in 660 CE using the three versions to ensure the integrity of the source documentation.&lt;ref name="Wriggins, Sally Hovey 2004 p.206"/&gt; Xuanzang was being encouraged by a number of the disciple translators to render an abridged version. After a suite of dreams quickened his decision, Xuanzang determined to render an unabridged, complete volume, faithful to the original of 600 fascicles.&lt;ref&gt;Wriggins, Sally Hovey (2004).

There are also later commentaries from Zen Buddhists on the Heart and Diamond sutra and [[Kūkai]]'s commentary (9th century) is the first known Tantric commentary.

==Themes in Prajñāpāramitā sutras==
===Core themes===
[[Image:Rabjor or Subhuti.jpg|thumb|280x280px|A Tibetan illustration of [[Subhuti]], a major character in the PP sutras who is proclaimed as the foremost “dweller in non-conflict” (''araṇavihārīnaṃ'') and “of those worthy of offering” (''dakkhiṇeyyānaṃ'').]]

====The Bodhisattva and Prajñāpāramitā====
A key theme of the Prajñāpāramitā sutras is the figure of the [[Bodhisattva]] (literally: awakening-being) which is defined in the 8,000 line PP sutra as:

:"One who trains in all dharmas [phenomena] without obstruction [''asakti, asaktatā''], and also knows all dharmas as they really are."&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, Matthew Bryan. “Chiasmus in the Early Prajñāpāramitā: Literary Parallelism Connecting Criticism &amp; Hermeneutics in an Early Mahāyāna Sūtra”,  University of Hong Kong , 2012, page 159.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A Bodhisattva is then a being that experiences everything "without attachment" (''asakti'') and sees reality or suchness (''Tathātā'') as it is. The Bodhisattva is the main ideal in [[Mahayana]] (Great Vehicle), which sees the goal of the Buddhist path as becoming a [[Buddha]] for the sake of all sentient beings, not just yourself:

:They make up their minds that ‘one single self we shall tame . . . one single self we shall lead to final Nirvana.’ 
:A Bodhisattva should certainly not in such a way train himself.
:On the contrary, he should train himself thus: ‘My own self I will place in Suchness [the true way of things], and, so that all the world might be helped, 
:I will place all beings into Suchness, and I will lead to Nirvana the whole immeasurable world of beings.’&lt;ref name="huntingtonarchive.org"&gt;Conze, Edward, THE PERFECTION OF WISDOM IN EIGHT THOUSAND LINES &amp; ITS VERSE SUMMARY, http://huntingtonarchive.org/resources/downloads/sutras/02Prajnaparamita/Astasahasrika.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A central quality of the Bodhisattva is their practice of Prajñāpāramitā, a most deep (''gambhīra'') state of knowledge which is an understanding of reality arising from analysis as well as [[meditative]] insight. It is non-conceptual and [[non-dual]] (''advaya'') as well as [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendental]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul; Mahayana Buddhism, the doctrinal foundations, pages 49-50.&lt;/ref&gt; Literally, the term could be translated as "knowledge gone to the other (shore)",&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, Matthew Bryan. “Chiasmus in the Early Prajñāpāramitā: Literary Parallelism Connecting Criticism &amp; Hermeneutics in an Early Mahāyāna Sūtra”,  University of Hong Kong , 2012, page 176.&lt;/ref&gt; or transcendental knowledge. The PP sutra in 8000 lines says:

:This is known as the Prajñāpāramitā of the bodhisattvas; not grasping at form, not grasping at sensation, perception, volitions and cognition.&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, Matthew Bryan. “Chiasmus in the Early Prajñāpāramitā: Literary Parallelism Connecting Criticism &amp; Hermeneutics in an Early Mahāyāna Sūtra”,  University of Hong Kong , 2012, page 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

A further passage in the 8,000 line PP sutra states that Prajñāpāramitā means that a Bodhisattva stands in emptiness ([[shunyata]]) by not standing (''√sthā'') or supporting themselves on any dharma (phenomena), whether conditioned or unconditioned. The dharmas that a Bodhisattva does "not stand" on include standard listings such as: the [[five aggregates]], the sense fields ([[ayatana]]), [[nirvana]], [[Buddhahood]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, Matthew Bryan. “Chiasmus in the Early Prajñāpāramitā: Literary Parallelism Connecting Criticism &amp; Hermeneutics in an Early Mahāyāna Sūtra”,  University of Hong Kong , 2012, page 149.&lt;/ref&gt; This is explained by stating that Bodhisattvas "wander without a home" (''aniketacārī''); "home" or "abode" meaning signs (''nimitta'', meaning a subjective mental impression) of sensory objects and the afflictions that arise dependent on them. This includes the absence, the "not taking up" (''aparigṛhīta'') of even "correct" mental signs and perceptions such as "form is not self", "I practice Prajñāpāramitā", etc. To be freed of all constructions and signs, to be signless (''animitta'') is to be empty of them and this is to stand in Prajñāpāramitā.&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, Matthew Bryan. “Chiasmus in the Early Prajñāpāramitā: Literary Parallelism Connecting Criticism &amp; Hermeneutics in an Early Mahāyāna Sūtra”,  University of Hong Kong , 2012, page 180-81.&lt;/ref&gt; The PP sutras state that all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas in the past have practiced Prajñāpāramitā. Prajñāpāramitā is also associated with ''Sarvajñata'' (all-knowledge) in the PP sutras, a quality of the mind of a Buddha which knows the nature of all dharmas.

[[Image:Gandhara, rilievo col buddha shakyamuni che medita nella grotta indrashala e il buddha dipankara, II-III secolo.jpg|thumb|280x280px|Gandharan depiction of the Bodhisattva (the future Buddha [[Shakyamuni]]) prostrating at the feet of the past Buddha [[Dipankara]].]]

According to Karl Brunnholzl, Prajñāpāramitā means that "all phenomena from form up through omniscience being utterly devoid of any intrinsic characteristics or nature of their own."&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl; Gone Beyond: The Prajnaparamita Sutras The Ornament Of Clear Realization And Its Commentaries In The Tibetan Kagyu Tradition (Tsadra) 2011, page 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, "such omniscient wisdom is always nonconceptual and free from reference points since it is the constant and panoramic awareness of the nature of all phenomena and does not involve any shift between meditative equipoise and subsequent attainment."&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl; Gone Beyond: The Prajnaparamita Sutras The Ornament Of Clear Realization And Its Commentaries In The Tibetan Kagyu Tradition (Tsadra) 2011, page 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Conze]] outlined several psychological qualities of a Bodhisattva's practice of Prajñāpāramitā:&lt;ref&gt;Conze, Edward; The Ontology of the Prajnaparamita, Philosophy East and West Vol.3 (1953) PP.117-129, University of Hawaii Press&lt;/ref&gt;

*Non-apprehension (''anupalabdhi'')
*No settling down or "non-attachment" (''anabhinivesa'')
*No attainment (''aprapti''). No person can "have," or "possess," or "acquire," or "gain" any dharma.
*Non-reliance on any dharma, being unsupported, not leaning on any dharma.
*"Finally, one may say that the attitude of the perfected sage is one of non-assertion."

====Other Bodhisattva qualities====
The PP sutras also teach of the importance of the other [[paramitas]] (perfections) for the Bodhisattva such as [[Ksanti]] (patience): "Without resort to this patience (kṣānti) they [bodhisattvas] cannot reach their respective goals".&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, Matthew Bryan. “Chiasmus in the Early Prajñāpāramitā: Literary Parallelism Connecting Criticism &amp; Hermeneutics in an Early Mahāyāna Sūtra”,  University of Hong Kong , 2012, page 124.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another quality of the Bodhisattva is their freedom from fear (''na √tras'') in the face of the seemingly shocking doctrine of the emptiness of all dharmas which includes their own existence. A good friend (''kalyanamitra'') is useful in the path to fearlessness. Bodhisattvas also have no pride or self-conception (''na manyeta'') of their own stature as Bodhisattvas.&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, Matthew Bryan. “Chiasmus in the Early Prajñāpāramitā: Literary Parallelism Connecting Criticism &amp; Hermeneutics in an Early Mahāyāna Sūtra”,  University of Hong Kong , 2012, page 139-40.&lt;/ref&gt; These are important features of the mind of a bodhisattva, called [[bodhicitta]]. The PP sutras also mention that bodhicitta is a middle way, it is neither apprehended as existent (''astitā'') or non-existent (''nāstitā'') and it is "immutable" (''avikāra'') and "free from conceptualization" (''avikalpa'').&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, Matthew Bryan. “Chiasmus in the Early Prajñāpāramitā: Literary Parallelism Connecting Criticism &amp; Hermeneutics in an Early Mahāyāna Sūtra”,  University of Hong Kong , 2012, page 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bodhisattva is said to generate "great compassion" (''maha-[[karuṇā]]'') for all beings on their path to liberation and yet also maintain a sense of equanimity ([[upekṣā]]) and distance from them through their understanding of emptiness, due to which, the Bodhisattva knows that even after bringing countless beings to nirvana, "no living being whatsoever has been brought to nirvana."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; [[Bodhisattvas]] and [[Mahāsattva]]s are also willing to give up all of their meritorious deeds for sentient beings and develop skillful means ([[upaya]]) in order to help abandon false views and teach them the Dharma. The practice of Prajñāpāramitā allows a Bodhisattva to become: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"a saviour of the helpless, a defender of the defenceless, a refuge to those without refuge, a place to rest to those without resting place, the final relief of those who are without it, an island to those without one, a light to the blind, a guide to the guideless, a resort to those without one and....guide to the path those who have lost it, and you shall become a support to those who are without support."&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, Matthew Bryan. “Chiasmus in the Early Prajñāpāramitā: Literary Parallelism Connecting Criticism &amp; Hermeneutics in an Early Mahāyāna Sūtra”,  University of Hong Kong , 2012, page 271.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Tathātā====
[[Image:The Buddha's Descent from Heaven at Samkashya (top; a), The Story of the Bodhisattva Sadaprarudita (middle; b), The Buddha Preaching to the Assembled Gods (bottom; c), Three Folios from LACMA M.86.345.11a-c (4 of 4).jpg|thumb|280x280px|Illustration of Bodhisattva ''Sadāprarudita'' (Ever weeping), a character in the 8000 line PP sutra [[Avadana]] section, which is used by the Buddha as an exemplar of those who seek Prajñāpāramitā.]]

''Tathātā'' (Suchness or Thusness) and the related term ''Dharmatā'' (the nature of Dharma), and [[Tathāgata]] are also important terms of the PP texts. To practice Prajñāpāramitā means to practice in accord with 'the nature of Dharma' and to see the Tathāgata (i.e. the Buddha). As the 8000 line PP sutra states, these terms are generally used equivalently: "As the suchness (''tathatā'') of dharmas is immovable (''acalitā''), and the suchness (''tathatā'') of dharmas is the ''Tathāgata''.".&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, Matthew Bryan. “Chiasmus in the Early Prajñāpāramitā: Literary Parallelism Connecting Criticism &amp; Hermeneutics in an Early Mahāyāna Sūtra”,  University of Hong Kong , 2012, page 233.&lt;/ref&gt; The Tathāgata is said in the 8000 line PP sutra to "neither come nor go". Furthermore, the 8000 line PP sutra includes a list of synonyms associated with Tathāgata as also being "beyond coming and going", these include: 1. Suchness (''tathatā''); 2. Unarisen (''anutpāda''); 3. Reality limit (''bhūtakoṭi''); 4. Śūnyatā; 5. Division (''yathāvatta''); 6. Detachment (''virāga''); 7. Cessation (''nirodha''); 8. Space element (''ākāśadhātu''). The sutra then states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Apart from these dharmas, there is no Tathāgata. The suchness of these dharmas, and the suchness of the Tathāgatas, is all one single suchness (''ekaivaiṣā tathatā''), not two, not divided (''dvaidhīkāraḥ''). … beyond all classification (''gaṇanāvyativṛttā''), due to non-existence (''asattvāt'').&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, Matthew Bryan. “Chiasmus in the Early Prajñāpāramitā: Literary Parallelism Connecting Criticism &amp; Hermeneutics in an Early Mahāyāna Sūtra”,  University of Hong Kong , 2012, page 233.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Suchness then does not come or go because like the other terms, it is not a real entity (''bhūta'', ''svabhāva''), but merely appears conceptually through [[dependent origination]], like a dream or an illusion. 

[[Edward Conze]] lists six ways in which the ontological status of dharmas is considered by the Prajñāpāramitā:&lt;ref&gt;Conze, Edward; The Ontology of the Prajnaparamita, Philosophy East and West Vol.3 (1953) PP.117-129, University of Hawaii Press&lt;/ref&gt;

#Dharmas are non-existent because they have no own-being ([[svabhava]]).
#Dharmas have a purely nominal existence. They are mere words, a matter of conventional expression.
#Dharmas are "without marks, with one mark only, ie., with no mark." A mark (''laksana'') being a distinctive property which separates it from other dharmas.
#Dharmas are isolated (''vivikta''), absolutely isolated (''atyantavivikta'').
#Dharmas have never been produced, never come into existence; they are not really ever brought forth, they are unborn (''ajata'').
#Non-production is illustrated by a number of similes, i.e., dreams, magical illusions, echoes, reflected images, mirages, and space.

It is through seeing this Tathātā that one is said to have a vision of the Buddha (the Tathāgata), seeing this is called seeing the Buddha's [[Dharmakaya]] (Dharma body) which is a not his physical body, but none other than the true nature of dharmas.&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, Matthew Bryan. “Chiasmus in the Early Prajñāpāramitā: Literary Parallelism Connecting Criticism &amp; Hermeneutics in an Early Mahāyāna Sūtra”,  University of Hong Kong , 2012, page 240.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Negation and Emptiness====
Most modern Buddhist scholars such as [[Etienne Lamotte|Lamotte]], Conze and [[Yin Shun]] have seen [[Śūnyatā]] (emptiness, voidness, hollowness) as ''the'' central theme of the PP sutras.&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, Matthew Bryan. “Chiasmus in the Early Prajñāpāramitā: Literary Parallelism Connecting Criticism &amp; Hermeneutics in an Early Mahāyāna Sūtra”,  University of Hong Kong , 2012, page 107-108.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Conze]] writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is now the principal teaching of Prajñāpāramitā with regard to own-being that it is "empty." The Sanskrit term is ''svabhāva-śūnya''. This is a ''[[tatpuruṣa]]'' compound (one in which the last member is qualified by the first without losing its grammatical independence), in which [[svabhava]] may have the sense of any oblique case. The [[Mahayana]] understands it to mean that dharmas are empty of any own-being, i.e.,that they are not ultimate facts in their own right, but merely imagined and falsely discriminated, for each and every one of them is dependent on something other than itself. From a slightly different angle this means that dharmas, when viewed with perfected [[gnosis]], reveal an own-being which is identical with emptiness, i.e in their own-being they are empty.&lt;ref&gt;Conze, Edward; The Ontology of the Prajnaparamita, Philosophy East and West Vol.3 (1953) PP.117-129, University of Hawaii Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The PP sutras commonly use [[apophasis|apophatic]] statements to express the nature of reality as seen by Prajñāpāramitā. A common trope in the Prajñāpāramitā sutras is the negation of a previous statement in the form 'A is not A, therefore it is A', or more often negating only a part of the statement as in, “XY is a Y-less XY”.&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, M. B.. (2012). Chiasmus in the early Prajñāpāramitā : literary parallelism connecting criticism &amp; hermeneutics in an early Mahāyāna sūtra. (Thesis). Page 171. University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong SAR. Retrieved from https://dx.doi.org/10.5353/th_b4775259&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese Buddhologist, Hajime Nakamura, calls this negation the 'logic of not' (''na prthak'').&lt;ref&gt;Nagatomo, Shigenori (2000). The Logic of the Diamond Sutra: A is not A, therefore it is A; Asian Philosophy 10 (3), 217–244&lt;/ref&gt; An example from the [[Diamond sutra]] of this use of negation is:

:As far as ‘all dharmas’ are concerned, Subhuti, all of them are dharma-less. That is why they are called ‘all dharmas.’&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Harrison, Paul. Vajracchedika Prajñaparamita Diamond Cutting Transcendent Wisdom&lt;/ref&gt;

The rationale behind this form is the juxtaposition of conventional truth with ultimate truth as taught in the Buddhist [[two truths doctrine]]. The negation of conventional truth is supposed to expound the ultimate truth of the emptiness ([[Śūnyatā]]) of all reality - the idea that nothing has an ontological essence and all things are merely conceptual, without substance. 

The PP sutras state that dharmas should not be conceptualized either as existent, nor as non existent, and use negation to highlight this: "in the way in which dharmas exist (''saṃvidyante''), just so do they not exist (''asaṃvidyante'')".&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, Matthew Bryan. “Chiasmus in the Early Prajñāpāramitā: Literary Parallelism Connecting Criticism &amp; Hermeneutics in an Early Mahāyāna Sūtra”,  University of Hong Kong , 2012, page 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Māya====
{{Main article|Maya_(religion)#Buddhism}}
The PP sutras commonly state that all dharmas (phenomena), are in some way like an [[illusion]] (''[[Maya_(religion)#Buddhism|māya]]''), like a [[dream]] (''svapna'') and like a [[mirage]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul; Mahayana Buddhism, the doctrinal foundations, pages 52.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Diamond Sutra]]'' states: 

:"A shooting star, a clouding of the sight, a lamp, An illusion, a drop of dew, a bubble, A dream, a lightning’s flash, a thunder cloud— This is the way one should see the conditioned."&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Paul (trans.) Vajracchedika Prajñaparamita Diamond Cutting Transcendent Wisdom, https://hyanniszendo.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/diamondsutra_lettersize1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Even the highest Buddhist goals like [[Buddhahood]] and [[Nirvana]] are to be seen in this way, thus the highest wisdom or prajña is a type of spiritual knowledge which sees all things as illusory. As Subhuti in the 8000 line PP sutra states:

:"Even if perchance there could be anything more distinguished, of that also I would say that it is like an illusion, like a dream. For not two different things are illusions and Nirvāṇa, are dreams and Nirvāṇa."&lt;ref&gt;Shi Huifeng. ''Is “Illusion” a Prajñāpāramitā Creation? The Birth and Death of a Buddhist Cognitive Metaphor.'' Fo Guang University. Journal of Buddhist Philosophy, Vol. 2, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

This is connected to the impermanence and insubstantial nature of dharmas. The PP sutras give the simile of a magician (''māyākāra'': 'illusion-maker') who, when seemingly killing his illusory persons by cutting off their heads, really kills nobody and compare it to the bringing of beings to awakening (by 'cutting off' the conceptualization of self view; Skt: ''ātmadṛṣṭi chindati'') and the fact that this is also ultimately like an illusion, because their aggregates "are neither bound nor released".&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, Matthew Bryan. “Chiasmus in the Early Prajñāpāramitā: Literary Parallelism Connecting Criticism &amp; Hermeneutics in an Early Mahāyāna Sūtra”,  University of Hong Kong , 2012, page 193.&lt;/ref&gt; The illusion then, is the conceptualization and mental fabrication of dharmas as existing or not existing, as arising or not arising. Prajñāpāramitā sees through this illusion, being empty of concepts and fabrications. 

Perceiving dharmas and beings like an illusion (''māyādharmatām'') is termed the "great armor" (''mahāsaṃnaha'') of the Bodhisattva, who is also termed the 'illusory man' (''māyāpuruṣa'').&lt;ref&gt;Orsborn, Matthew Bryan. “Chiasmus in the Early Prajñāpāramitā: Literary Parallelism Connecting Criticism &amp; Hermeneutics in an Early Mahāyāna Sūtra”,  University of Hong Kong , 2012, page 165-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later additions===
According to Paul Williams, another major theme of the PP sutras is "the phenomenon of laudatory self reference – the lengthy praise of the sutra itself, the immense merits to be obtained from treating even a verse of it with reverence, and the nasty penalties which will accrue in accordance with [[karma]] to those who denigrate the scripture."&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul; Mahayana Buddhism, the doctrinal foundations, page 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Edward Conze]], the PP sutras added much new doctrinal material in the later layers and the larger texts. Conze lists the later accretions as:&lt;ref name="huntingtonarchive.org"/&gt;

#Increasing sectarianism, with all the rancor, invective and polemics that that implies
#Increasing scholasticism and the insertion of longer and longer Abhidharma lists
#Growing stress on skill in means, and on its subsidiaries such as the Bodhisattva’s Vow and the four means of conversion, and its logical sequences, such as the distinction between provisional and ultimate truth
#A growing concern with the Buddhist of faith, with its celestial Buddhas and Bodhisattva and their Buddha-fields;
#A tendency towards verbosity, repetitiveness and overelaboration
#Lamentations over the decline of the Dharma
#Expositions of the hidden meaning which become the more frequent the more the original meaning becomes obscured
#Any reference to the Dharma body of the Buddha as anything different from a term for the collection of his teachings
#A more and more detailed doctrine of the graded stages (bhumi) of a Bodhisattva’s career.

==Prajñāpāramitā in visual art==
The Prajnaparamita is often personified as a ''bodhisattvadevi'' (female bodhisattva). Artifacts from [[Nalanda]] depict the Prajnaparamita personified as a deity. The depiction of Prajnaparamita as a Yidam deity can also be found in ancient Java and Cambodian art.

===Prajñāpāramitā in Ancient Indonesia===
[[File:Prajnaparamita Java Front.JPG|thumb|Prajñāpāramitā statue from East Java, Indonesia.|551x551px]]
{{main article|Prajnaparamita of Java}}
[[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]] took root in ancient [[Java]] [[Sailendra]] court in the 8th century CE. The Mahayana reverence of female buddhist deity started with the cult of [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]] enshrined in the 8th century [[Kalasan]] temple in Central Java. Some of Prajnaparamita's important functions and attributes can be traced to those of the goddess Tara. Tara and Prajnaparamita are both referred to as mothers of all Buddhas, since Buddhas are born from wisdom. The Sailendra dynasty was also the ruling family of [[Srivijaya]] in Sumatra. During the reign of the third Pala king Devapala (815-854) in India, Srivijaya Maharaja [[Balaputra]] of Sailendras also constructed one of Nalanda’s main monasteries in India itself. Thereafter manuscript editions of the ''Ashtasahasrika Prajnaparamita Sutra'' circulating in Sumatra and Java instigated the cult of the Goddess of Transcendent Wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asianartnewspaper.com/article/early-buddhist-manuscript-painting%3A-the-palm-leaf-tradition Asian Art] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312213139/http://www.asianartnewspaper.com/article/early-buddhist-manuscript-painting%3A-the-palm-leaf-tradition |date=March 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 13th century, the tantric buddhism gained royal patronage of king [[Kertanegara of Singhasari]], and thereafter some of Prajnaparamita statues were produced in the region, such as the Prajnaparamita of Singhasari in East Java and Prajnaparamita of [[Muaro Jambi Regency]], [[Sumatra]]. Both of East Java and Jambi Prajnaparamitas bear resemblance in style as they were produced in same period, however unfortunately Prajnaparamita of Jambi is headless and was discovered in poor condition.

The statue of Prajnaparamita of East Java is probably the most famous depiction of the goddess of transcendental wisdom, and is considered the masterpiece of classical ancient Java Hindu-Buddhist art in Indonesia. It was discovered in the Cungkup Putri ruins near Singhasari temple, [[Malang]], [[East Java]]. Today the beautiful and serene statue is displayed on 2nd floor Gedung Arca, [[National Museum of Indonesia]], [[Jakarta]].

'''Problem finding''' means problem discovery. It is part of the larger problem process that includes [[problem shaping]] and [[problem solving]]. Problem finding requires intellectual vision and insight into what is missing. This involves the application of [[creativity]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2415">{{Psychoanalysis |Concepts}}

The term '''psychic apparatus''' (also '''psychical apparatus''', '''mental apparatus''') denotes a central, theoretic construct of [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] [[metapsychology]], wherein:

{{quote|We assume that mental life is the function of an apparatus to which we ascribe the characteristics of being extended in space and of being made up of several portions &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Id, ego and super-ego]].|Freud, ''An Outline of Psychoanalysis'' (1940)}}

As a [[Ego psychology|psychologist]], [[Sigmund Freud]] used the German terms '''''psychischer Apparat''''' and '''''seelischer Apparat''''', about the functioning of which he elaborates:

{{quote|We picture the unknown apparatus, which serves the activities of the mind, as being really like an instrument constructed of several parts (which we speak of as 'agencies'), each of which performs a particular function, and which have a fixed, spatial relation to one another: it being understood that by 'spatial relation'—'in front of' and 'behind', 'superficial' and 'deep'—we merely mean, in the first instance, a representation of the regular succession of the functions.|Freud, ''The Question of Lay Analysis'' (1926)}}

Freud proposed the psychic apparatus as solely a theoretic construct explaining the functioning of the [[mind]], and not a [[Neurology|neurologic]] structure of the [[brain]]:

{{quote|It is a [[hypothesis]], like so many others in the sciences: the very earliest ones have always been rather rough. 'Open to revision', we can say in such cases ... the value of a 'fiction' of this kind ... depends on how much one can achieve with its help.|Freud, ''The Question of Lay Analysis'' (1926)}}

Moreover, in emphasizing the immateriality of the psychic apparatus, Freud dismissed the matter of its physical substance:

{{quote|That is not a subject of psychological interest. [[Ego psychology|Psychology]] can be as indifferent to it as, for instance, optics can be to the question of whether the walls of a telescope are made of metal or cardboard. We shall leave entirely to one side the '''material''' line of approach.|Freud, ''The Question of Lay Analysis'' (1926)}}

Most scientists agree that [[religiosity]] is not an independent personality trait, but something that can have the effect of personality traits.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Individual Differences and Personality|last=Ashton|first=Michael C|publisher=Elsevier Academic Press|year=2007|isbn=9780123741295|location=Oxford, UK|pages=260–267}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viewing religiosity through the lenses of differing personality characteristics provides a relatively empirical way to study a difficult concept. Over time, the act of being religious has been a consistent behavior across almost every culture, and thus provides evidence that our personality can help explain the seeming predisposition of religious people.

With the ability to use modern, empirically tested personality measures, researchers can link results with religiosity. In linking personality measures with religion, it is possible to quantitatively study results, which can provide insight into how and why religion is such an important element of being human.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Saroglou|first=Vassilis|title=Religion, Personality, and Social Behavior|year=2014|publisher=Psychology Press|location=New York|url=http://www.psypress.com/books/details/9781848726659/}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, more research is needed to definitively say that there is a correlation between certain personality characteristics and religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Park|first=edited by [[Raymond F. Paloutzian]], Crystal L.|title=Handbook of the psychology of religion and spirituality |year=2005|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York|isbn=1-57230-922-9|pages=253-2-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Five-factor model of personality==
The [[five-factor model]] of personality is currently accepted as a comprehensive model of personality.&lt;ref name=Digman&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Digman | first1 = J.M. | year = 1990 | title = Personality structure: Emergence of the five-factor model | url = |journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 417–440 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ps.41.020190.002221 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The five-factor model (FFM) identifies five broad traits underlying the many narrower traits that can be used to describe personality.  The identified traits are: 1) extraversion, the quantity and intensity of one's interpersonal interactions 2) neuroticism, the tendency to experience negative emotions such as anxiety, depression, and hostility 3) conscientiousness, the persistence, organization, and motivation exhibited in goal-directed behaviors 4) agreeableness, the quality of one's interpersonal interactions along a continuum from compassion to antagonism 5) openness, the proactive seeking and appreciation of new experiences. The idea behind the big five personality characteristics that makes them compatible to religious study is that each trait is orthogonal, or completely independent from one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Funder|first=David C.|title=The personality puzzle|year=2010|publisher=W.W. Norton|location=New York|isbn=9780393933482|pages=243–244|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; In having the ability to separate each essential trait from the other, it is possible to study each personality characteristic and how it relates to religiosity.

The idea of studying the [[psychology of religion]] through a personality lens is not a new idea, however.  There has been research to both support and refute the ability of personality traits to explain religious or spiritual involvement. Research using [[Hans Eysenck|Eysenck]]'s model has found that religiosity in general is associated with low openness to experience, as well as low [[psychoticism]],&lt;ref name="psychology of religion"&gt;{{cite journal|first= Robert A.|last=Emmons|author2=Paloutzian, Raymond F. |title=The Psychology of Religion|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|year=2003|volume=54|pages=377–402|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.54.101601.145024|pmid=12171998}}&lt;/ref&gt; a factor associated inversely with agreeableness and conscientiousness.&lt;ref name=Saroglou/&gt; A review of studies examined the relations between the FFM and measures of religiosity, spiritual maturity, religious fundamentalism, and extrinsic religion. General religiosity was mainly related to Agreeableness and Conscientiousness of the big five traits.&lt;ref name=Saroglou&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saroglou|first=Vassilis|title=Religion and the five-factors of personality: A meta-analytic review.|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|year=2002|pages=15–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there was a weak positive association with extraversion, and a very small but significant relationship with low openness to experience. This same study also found that the two different concepts of religiosity and spirituality both involve an overall compassionate attitude towards others and positively correlates with agreeableness. Open, mature religiosity and spirituality were associated with high openness to experience, extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness, and with low neuroticism. Religious fundamentalism was associated with higher agreeableness, and lower neuroticism and lower openness to experience. Because of these factors, it was also seen that more religious people seem to be altruistic and more well behaved. However, this correlation is pretty small. It is not known if religious people tend to be better behaved or if better behaved people are more attracted to religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Individual Differences and Personality|last=Ashton|first=Michael|publisher=Nikki Levy|year=2018|isbn=978-0-12-809845-5|location=125 London Wall, London EC2Y 5AS, United Kingdom|pages=306}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extrinsic religiosity was associated with higher neuroticism but unrelated to the other personality factors. All of these relationships between personality and religion were small. This finding does not necessarily support the concept of personality for being the specific reason for religiosity, however this correlation with the FFM can lead to more in depth research on the topic.

===Strengths and weaknesses===
As previously stated, one of the major strengths for using the FFM to study religiosity in people is the how empirically tested, and accurate the measure actually is in accordance to personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Costa|first1=P|last2=McCrae|title=The NEO PI-R Professional Manual|journal=The NEO PI-R Professional Manual|date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another strength is that the big five is an excellent starting point for beginning to look at links between personality and religiosity because it is simply laid out. While this is a huge strength, some research argues that its downfall lies in that it is solely a personality indicator, and is not compatible with religious or spiritual matters.  For example, in another study that investigated the correlation between religiosity and the FFM, a conclusion was drawn that religiosity and/or spirituality should be made into a sixth personality factor in order to truly make research using this model accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Piedmont|first=R|title=Strategies for using the five factor model of personality in religious research|journal=Journal of Psychology and Theology|volume=27|pages=338–350}}&lt;/ref&gt; As more advances in research using the FFM to study religiosity and spirituality come, there will be a clearer cut answer as to whether there is a significant place for the FFM in studying religious behavior.

==Attachment theory==
[[Attachment Theory]] is another example of a personality indicator with the ability to help researchers understand religiosity and spirituality.  The basic premise of attachment theory is that infants form relationships with their caregivers, and depending on the type of attachment, personality and future relationships will be influenced accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowlby|first=J|title=Attachment and loss: Separation, anxiety and anger|year=1973|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea behind how the theory relates to the psychology of religion is that these future relationships can be with the particular god, or higher power.

In attachment theory, there have been three attachment styles identified: 1)secure style- confidence in the availability of attachment figures during times of need 2)avoidant style- insecurity and lack of trust in the ability of others to care for one's needs 3) anxious-ambivalent style- view of others as being reluctant to get close to oneself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Park|first=edited by Raymond F. Paloutzian, Crystal L.|title=Handbook of the psychology of religion and spirituality|year=2005|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York|isbn=1-57230-922-9|pages=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research varies in explaining which type of attachment style yields the individual's particular relationship with God.  For example, in one study, a secure relationship with one's parents will translate into a secure attachment to God, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kirkpatrick|first=L|title=God as a substitute attachment figure: a longitudinal study of adult attachment style and religious change in college students.|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|year=1998|volume=24|pages=961–973|doi=10.1177/0146167298249004}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other research has showed that there is a compensatory effect, or the need of people to make up for something that is lacking.  For instance, someone with an insecure attachment style with their parents may in turn, have a very secure, and confident relationship with God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Park|first=edited by Raymond F. Paloutzian, Crystal L.|title=Handbook of the psychology of religion and spirituality|year=2005|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York|isbn=1572309229|pages=256–257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strengths and weaknesses===
The idea of being able to link people's religiousness (or lack thereof) with how their attachment with their caregivers was, seems to be a promising field of study.  The obstacle that makes this seemingly simple idea very complicated is that the current data is so skewed.  There are many studies that found there is a direct correspondence from attachment style with caregivers to God, and there are studies who have found more compensatory results.  The inability of researchers to find a general consensus could be a hindrance towards future exploration in this field.

==Object relations theory==
[[Object relations theory]]'s roots lie in children relating or associating different emotions with different people (objects).  The children associate these emotions to the objects based on how they currently view the world around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kernberg|first=O|title=Structural derivatives of object relationships|journal=International Journal of Psycho-Analysis|pages=236–253}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, kids will associate the emotion of something good with mother, and bad with something like criminals.  In relating this with religious ideals, it seems natural that the same concept should apply.  One's relationship with God should, in theory, be traced back to association.

In this theory, it is hypothesized that the person ends up creating an idea of God according to what the individual needs, and how he or she perceives the world. This view of personality and religion does not focus on how each person differs trait wise, but it centers on the type of relationship the individual has with God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rizzuto|first=A|title=The birth of the living god|year=1979|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strengths and weaknesses===
An important notion to keep in mind with Object Relations theory is that it is highly theoretical.  This is a weakness in the sense that all data is based on a concept that cannot be objectively verified, and thus creates a confound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lilienfeld|first=S |author2=Wood, J |author3=Garb, H|title=The scientific status of projective tests|journal=Psychological Science in the Public Interest|year=2000|doi= 10.1111/1529-1006.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with all inquiries about the psychological nature of religion, it is difficult to find extremely valid and reliable measures because of the introspective nature of the subject.  That being said, there is something that we can learn from this field of study.  By analyzing how this theory of personality development correlates with one's attachment to a religious deity, we can hopefully begin to understand how important association, and perception is to religious ideals.

== Religious struggles and personality ==
Research has shown that struggles with religion correlates to basic personality traits. Studies on [[Big Five personality traits|The Big Five Factors of Personality]], as well as factors such as self-compassion, self-esteem, and entitlement, suggest that there is a significant relationship between religious uncertainty and personality.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;http://sites.nd.edu/lapseylab/files/2016/08/Grubbs_etal_SelfStruggleAndSoul_2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

People who are high in neuroticism may have a hard time trying to find purpose in their life. This correlates with divine struggles as they may encounter distress when it comes to finding the meaning of life as well as recognizing divine figures of religions. Extroversion, however, has not been linked through research or studies with religious struggles. Very little evidence is available to suggest that openness to experience is linked to religious struggles, but it is thought that those who are high in openness to experience may carry more doubt in religion compared to those who are lower in openness to experience. Both agreeableness and conscientiousness have been associated with possible animosity towards God or other divine figures.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;  It has also been found that religious people are more likely to avoid risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929119916300013?via%3Dihub|title=Does local religiosity matter for bank risk-taking?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11166-013-9174-8|title=Risk aversion and religion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religion and life satisfaction ==
Research done by Salsman, Brown, Brechting, and Carlson showed a positive correlation between religion and life satisfaction of about 0.2 to 0.3. It was shown by Salsman that those who practice religion have a generally more positive outlook on life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Individual Differences in Personality|last1=Ashton|first1=Michael C|date=2018|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-12-809845-5|edition=Third|pages=310–311}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many elements of religion have been studied to determine which aspects impacts one's life satisfaction. It was found that both personal and organizational religion can lead to an increased life satisfaction. Individual prayer, a feeling of intimacy with the divine, and meditation were all linked to greater psychological well-being and life satisfaction. When it came to organizational religion, people felt a greater satisfaction knowing that they belonged to a group, had a support system from the church, and felt fulfilled when they increased their participation within the church's community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elliot|first1=Marta|last2=Hayward|first2=R. David|date=October 1, 2009|title=Relgion and Life Satisfaction Worldwide: The Role of Government Regulation|url=https://academic.oup.com/socrel/article/70/3/285/1652126|journal=Sociology of Religion|volume=70|issue=3|pages=285–310|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who feel conflicted about religion may encounter a decline in their health, both mentally and physically. Research has shown that those who have religious struggles could have higher depression and anxiety levels. The risk of suicide is even elevated when struggle is present within religion. These struggles have been linked to a separation from the church or the divine; however the cause for the separation is unknown and may stem from different events throughout life such as a traumatic death in the family, difficult life events, or a mental battle between oneself. More research is needed to validate the causes of religious separation and how it effect one's personality.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Religion and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator ==
The [[Myers-Briggs Type Indicator]], or MBTI, uses four dichotomies to indicate a person's psychological preference. When used in studies alongside religion, it has been shown that introverted types (primarily ISTJ and INTJ) are more likely to be atheist. However, a large portion of Greek Orthodox is ISTJ as well. In addition, the "judging" (J) type is common among evangelical and Protestants.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scienceonreligion.org/index.php/news-research/research-updates/573-the-personality-types-of-christians-and-atheists&lt;/ref&gt;  ESFJ and ENFJ personality types are more interested in becoming ministers than other type. ENFJs are more attracted to becoming ministers of liberal denominations, while ESFJs are more interested in becoming ministers in conservative denominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/j.2333-8504.1957.tb00074.x|title=EVIDENCE BEARING ON USE OF THE MYERS‐BRIGGS TYPE INDICATOR TO SELECT PERSONS FOR ADVANCED RELIGIOUS TRAINING: A PRELIMINARY REPORT}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should also be noted that the Myers-Briggs Personality Type Indicator, although popular, is flawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pittenger|first1=David|title=Measuring the MBTI... And Coming Up Short|journal=Journal of Career Planning &amp; Placement|issue=Fall 1993|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~jobtalk/Articles/develop/mbti.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religiosity and paranormal beliefs ==
Most religions are based around a belief in some sort of supernatural being. This may lead some to believe that the characteristic of being religious would relate in someway to the characteristic of believing in other paranormal beings. However, multiple studies have found no correlation between these two characteristics. This could be due to the fact that many religions discourage their members from thinking too much of paranormal beings, as they are thought to be evil.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In conclusion, paranormal beliefs are probably not highly related to personality traits.

== Religion as a personality characteristic ==
While there are many who believe religion has a strong influence on personality development, some believe it may be a personality trait on its own. Vassilis Saroglou, for example,  has developed on the idea by introducing four traits of personality that religion develop: believing, bonding, behaving, and belonging. Believing refers to someone accepting the belief in a supernatural being or world. Bonding is how important religion is to the self and how it connects them to something larger than themselves. Behaving is how someone changes their own lifestyle to appease their spiritual beliefs. Belonging is the identity one acquires from believing in a religion. This concept, published in 2011, easily applies to religion cross-culturally and to a wide range of spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saroglou|first=Vassilis|date=September 2, 2011|title=Believing, Bonding, Behaving, and Belonging - The Big Four Religious Dimensions and Cultural Variation|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022022111412267|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology |volume=42|pages=1320–1340|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5276">The term '''reparation''' was used by [[Melanie Klein]] (1921) to indicate a psychological process of making mental repairs to a damaged internal world.&lt;ref&gt;Lani A. Gerity, ''Creativity and the Dissociated Patient'' (1999) p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; In [[object relations theory]], it represents a key part of the movement from the [[paranoid-schizoid position]] to the [[depressive position]] — the pain of the latter helping to fuel the urge to reparation.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Caper, ''Immaterial Facts'' (2000) p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

==Klein==
{{Main|Melanie Klein|Splitting (psychology)#Melanie Klein|l2=Klein's theory splitting}}
Klein considered the ability to recognise our destructive impulses towards those we love, and to make reparation for the damage we have caused them, to be an essential part of mental health. A key condition for this to take place is the recognition of one's separateness from one's parents,&lt;ref name = Segal89&gt;Hanna Segal, ''Introduction to the Work of Melanie Klein'' (London 1964) p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; which makes possible the reparative attempt to restore their inner representations, however damaged these may be felt to be.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Appignanesi ed., ''Introducing Melanie Klein'' (Cambridge 2006) p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

Acceptance of reality, inner and outer, forms a major part of this process; it involves both an abandonment of fantasies of [[omnipotence]],&lt;ref&gt;Lesley Caldwell ed., ''Winnicott and the Psychoanalytic Tradition'' (London 2007) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; and accepting the independent existence of one's objects of attachment.&lt;ref name = Segal89/&gt;

Where the damage done to the internal world is felt by a patient to be extreme, however, the task of reparation may seem too great — which is one of the obstacles facing the analytic attempt at cure.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Jacobus, ''The Poetics of Psychoanalysis: In the Wake of Klein'' (Oxford 2005) p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manic reparation==

Kleinian thought distinguishes between true reparation and manic reparation, the latter being driven by guilt rather than overcoming it.&lt;ref&gt;Hyam Sydney Klein/Joan Symington, ''Imprisoned Pain and its Transformation'' (London 2000) p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Manic reparation denies the pain and concern of feeling guilty by using magical methods of repair&lt;ref&gt;Hanna Segal, ''Introduction to the Work of Melanie Klein'' (London 1964), p. 84-5 and p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; which maintain omnipotent control of the object in question, and refuse to allow it its separate existence. Thus manic reparation has to be endlessly repeated, since success would free the object from the manic person's (contemptuous) power.&lt;ref&gt;Hanna Segal, ''Introduction to the Work of Melanie Klein'' (London 1964), p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

==Winnicott==
{{Main|Donald Winnicott}}
Donald Winnicott made his own distinctive contribution to the role of reparation in the "personalising" of the individual, the move from the ruthless use of the external object to a sense of concern.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Janet Malcolm, ''Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession'' (London 1988) p. 34-5&lt;/ref&gt; Winnicott focused on the way at a certain stage of development a feeling of guilt or concern begins to appear after the wholehearted instinctual experience of a feed. But once the reparative gesture—a smile, a gift—has been successfully acknowledged by the mother, Winnicott writes: "The breast (body, mother) is now mended and the day's work is done. Tomorrow's instincts can be awaited with limited fear".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Adam Phillips, ''On Flirtation'' (London 1994) p. 17 and p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; The child's contribution is a way of accepting the debt owed to the mother, for their survival and their participation in the work of reparation.&lt;ref name = Gaitanidis83/&gt; If, on the other hand, the reparative gesture is not accepted, the infant is left with a feeling of depression or meaninglessness.&lt;ref name = Gaitanidis83&gt;A. Gaitanidis/P. Curk, ''Narcissism: A Critical Reader'' (London 2007) p. 83-84&lt;/ref&gt; 

A similar dynamic may later appear between patient and analyst, with the making of progress being offered as a means of reparation.&lt;ref&gt;I. Salzberger-Wittenberg, ''Psychoanalytic Insight and Relationships'' (1984) p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==
Kleinians considered that artistic creation was driven by the phantasy of repairing the loved object (mother).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychoanalysis-and-therapy.com/human_nature/glover/index.html Nicola Glover "Psychoanalytic Aesthetics: The British School"]&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Marion Milner]] in the [[Middle Group|Independent]] tradition also saw art as a way of both symbolizing and enacting inner reparation;&lt;ref&gt;Lesley Caldwell ed., ''Winnicott and the Psychoanalytic Tradition'' (London 2007) p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; but was criticised by Kleinians for giving too large a role to the omnipotent feelings of the artist in reparation.&lt;ref&gt;Hinshelwood, Chapter 3 n54, in [http://www.psychoanalysis-and-therapy.com/human_nature/glover/index.html Glover]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1566">'''''Sex Differences in Cognitive Abilities''''' ({{ISBN|9780805827927}}) is a book by [[Diane Halpern]] published by [[Lawrence Erlbaum Associates]] in 2000, and now in its fourth edition. Diane Halpern served as president of the [[American Psychological Association]] in 2004.

{{cquote|At the time [I started writing this book], it seemed clear to me that any between-sex differences in thinking abilities were due to socialization practices, artifacts, and mistakes in the research. After reviewing a pile of journal articles that stood several feet high and numerous books and book chapters that dwarfed the stack of journal articles, I changed my mind.}}

Halpern writes that gender differences in cognitive abilities can be caused by a "stereotype threat", defined as "the fear of conforming to a negative stereotype associated with one’s group membership, which paradoxically results in the individual behaving in line with the stereotype".&lt;ref name="Psychoneuroendocrinology"&gt; Marcus Hausmann, Daniela Schoofs, Harriet E.S. Rosenthal, Kristen Jordan, "Psychoneuroendocrinology", 2009 &lt;/ref&gt; If an individual is made aware of a stereotype then "the activation of stereotypes might explain why the magnitude of sex differences in sex-sensitive cognitive task varies across studies, depending on whether participants gender-stereotypes are activated or not".&lt;ref name="Psychoneuroendocrinology"/&gt;

{{Jainism}}
'''Skandha''' (Sanskrit) means "heaps, aggregates, collections, groupings". In contrast to [[Buddhism]] that says Skandha is without any underlying substance or identity, [[Jainism]] posits that all Skandhas are ultimately backed by a combination of  [[Paramanu|Paramanus]] or elementary particles that are indestructible and uncreatable. Skandha is nothing but a combination of [[Paramanu|Paramanus]] (elementary particles). Jainism doesn't include the last four types of aggregates of Buddhism because those phenomena are explained in Jainism by the groupings between fine matter called ([[Karma in Jainism|karma particles]], second last from the list below) and [[Atman (Jainism)|Atman]] [[Dravya|Substance]] (unified individual whose existence is denied in Buddhism). A grouping between matter and Atman is not considered a Skandha but is considered a [[Bandha (Jainism)|Bandha (bondage)]].

Each Paramanu has "intensity points" of aridness or cohesiveness that, because of transformation, can increase or decrease between one and infinity. These Paramanus can combine with each other to create Skandhas or Aggregates when there is a difference of two "intensity points", whether it is arid or cohesive or whether having even or odd "intensity points" except the minimum (one) "intensity point". For example, a paramanu with two points of cohesiveness can combine with a [[paramanu]] of four points of cohesiveness or aridness; and that of three points with that of five points and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|pages=545–546|title=Pravachansaara|url=https://ia801904.us.archive.org/1/items/in.ernet.dli.2015.321516/2015.321516.Pravachanasara.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition is given in [[Pravachanasara]].

Skandhas and Paramanus are two types of [[Pudgala]]s (Matter).

Skandha are of six types: Gross-gross, gross, gross-fine, fine-gross, fine, and fine-fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|page=27|title=Niyamsara|url=https://ia600209.us.archive.org/27/items/Niyamsara/Niyamsara%20%28The%20Perfect%20Law%29_text.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This classification is given in [[Niyamsara]].
# Gross-gross: Solids, such as stone and wood, that when broken cannot be united again by themselves.
# Gross: Milk, water, etc. separated but can unite without any help.
# Gross-fine: The sunlight, shade, moon light, darkness etc. One is not able to split them. One is not able to  grab them with his hands.
# Fine-gross: The objects of the four senses of touch, taste, smell, and hearing are even though are known by skin, tongue, nose and ears but still cannot be perceived by eyes and that is why they are fine-gross in nature.
# Fine: The matter particles of the [[Karma in Jainism|karma]] are fine in nature and cannot be perceived by any of the physical senses.
# Fine-fine: Finer than the karma particles are extremely fine in nature. They are finer than karma particles.

[[File:Status set.png|thumb|An example of a status set]]
A '''status set''' is a collection of [[social status]]es that an individual holds. A person may have status of a daughter, wife, mother, student, worker, church member and a citizen.

The term "status set" was coined by [[Robert K. Merton]] in 1957. He made a clear distinction between a "[[role set]]" and a "status set".&lt;ref&gt;Robert K. Merton "On social structure and science" {{ISBN|0-226-52071-4}}, page 113&lt;/ref&gt;

Merton stated that status set is the set of statuses in a society while role set is the set of roles in a society

[[File:TheLadyOrTheTiger.jpg|thumb|"The Lady, or the Tiger?" was the title story in an 1884 collection of twelve stories by [[Frank R. Stockton]] published by [[Scribner (publisher)|Scribner]]]]

"'''The Lady, or the Tiger?'''" is a much-anthologized [[short story]] written by [[Frank R. Stockton]] for publication in the magazine ''[[The Century Magazine|The Century]]'' in 1882. "The Lady, or the Tiger?" has entered the [[English language]] as an [[allegory|allegorical]] expression, a shorthand indication or [[Sign (semiotics)|signifier]], for a problem that is unsolvable.

==Plot summary==
The short story takes place in a land ruled by a semi-barbaric king. Some of the king's ideas are progressive, but others cause people to suffer. One of the king's innovations is the use of a public [[trial by ordeal]] as an agent of poetic justice, with guilt or innocence decided by the result of chance. A person accused of a crime is brought into a public [[arena]] and must choose one of two doors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://learningenglish.voanews.com/content/lady-tiger-frank-stockton-american-stories/2524590.html VOA Learning English video]&lt;/ref&gt; Behind one door is a lady whom the king has deemed an appropriate match for the accused; behind the other is a fierce, hungry tiger. Both doors are heavily soundproofed to prevent the accused from hearing what is behind each one. If he chooses the door with the lady behind it, he is innocent and must immediately marry her, but if he chooses the door with the tiger behind it, he is deemed guilty and is immediately devoured by it.

The king learns that his daughter has a lover, a handsome and brave youth who is of lower status than the princess, and has him imprisoned to await trial. By the time that day comes, the princess has used her influence to learn the positions of the lady and the tiger behind the two doors. She has also discovered that the lady is someone whom she hates, thinking her to be a rival for the affections of the accused. When he looks to the princess for help, she discreetly indicates the door on his right, which he opens.

The outcome of this choice is not revealed. Instead, the narrator departs from the story to summarize the princess's state of mind and her thoughts about directing the accused to one fate or the other, as she will lose him to either death or marriage. She contemplates the pros and cons of each option, though notably considering the lady more. "And so I leave it with all of you: Which came out of the opened door – the lady, or the tiger?"

==Other works==

===By Stockton===
Stockton later wrote "The Discourager of Hesitancy,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unz.org/Pub/Century-1885jul-00482 "The Discourager of Hesitancy" in the ''Century Magazine'' Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; a follow-up to "The Lady, or the Tiger?" that begins with five travelers visiting the kingdom to discover what the accused man in that story found behind the door he chose. An official tells them a second story, of a prince who had come to the kingdom to find a wife. Instead of allowing him to see any available ladies, the king had him immediately taken to guest quarters and summoned attendants to prepare him for a wedding to be held the next day. One attendant introduced himself as the Discourager of Hesitancy and explained that his job was to ensure compliance with the king's will, through the subtle threat of the large "cimeter" ([[scimitar]]) he carried.

At noon on the following day, the prince was blindfolded and brought before a priest, where a marriage ceremony was performed and he could feel and hear a lady standing next to him. Once the ceremony was complete, the blindfold was removed and he turned to find 40 ladies standing before him, one of whom was his new bride. If he did not correctly identify her, the Discourager would execute him on the spot. The prince narrowed the possibilities down to two, one lady smiling and one frowning, and made the correct choice.

The kingdom official tells the five travelers that once they figure out which lady the prince had married, he will tell them the outcome of "The Lady, or the Tiger?" The story ends with a comment that they still have not come to a decision.

===By other artists===
A play adaptation by [[Sydney Rosenfeld]] debuted at [[Wallack's Theatre]] in 1888 ran for seven weeks. In addition to stretching out the story as long as possible to make it a play, at the end the choice was revealed to the audience – neither a lady or tiger, but an old hag.&lt;ref name="lady1"&gt;Smith, Cecil &amp; Glenn Litton. [https://books.google.com/books?id=1VvYAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Musical Comedy in America], p. 44 (1991 ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Toyah Willcox]] and [[Robert Fripp]] released a recording of "The Lady, or the Tiger?" and "The Discourager of Hesitancy" with Willcox reading the stories to electric guitar accompaniment by Fripp.

"The Lady, or the Tiger?" is one of three short stories that were adapted into the [[musical comedy]] ''[[The Apple Tree]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Apple Tree|publisher=Music Theatre International|url=http://www.mtishows.com/show_detail.asp?showid=000007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story was the inspiration for [[Raymond Smullyan]]'s puzzle book by the same title, ''The Lady, or the Tiger?''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|0812921178}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first set of [[logic puzzle]]s in the book had a similar scenario to the short story in which a king gives each prisoner a choice between a number of doors; behind each one was either a lady or a tiger. However, the king bases the prisoner's fate on intelligence and not luck by posting a statement on each door that can be true or false.

''The Lady, or the Tiger?'' adapted to a short film by [[Encyclopaedia Britannica Educational Corp. v. Crooks|Encyclopaedia Britannica Educational Corporation]] on 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.worldcat.org/title/lady-or-the-tiger-and-a-discussion-of-frank-stocktons-the-lady-or-the-tiger/oclc/422754519 |title= The lady or the tiger? ; and, A Discussion of Frank Stockton's The Lady, or the tiger? |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website= WorldCat |access-date= 2018-05-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://kids.britannica.com/kids/assembly/view/139771 |title= Frank Stockton's story |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website= Britannica Kids |access-date= 2018-05-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Lady, or the Tiger?" is referenced in "[[Ennui (sonnet)|Ennui]]", a [[sonnet]] written by [[Sylvia Plath]] and published 43 years after her death. Plath's sonnet, however, speaks of an age when the choice has become no longer relevant.

[[Alternative rock]] band [[They Might Be Giants]] released the song "The Lady and the Tiger" on their 2011 album ''[[Join Us]]''. Like the story, the song ends without a conclusion. The last line reads, "The hall remains, it still contains a pair of doors, a choice. Behind one door, a muffled roar, behind the other, a voice."

''The Lady or the Tiger'' is a one-act play adapted from Stockton's short story and published by [[Lazy Bee Scripts]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lazybeescripts.co.uk/Scripts/script.aspx?iSS=312|title=The Lady or the Tiger by Gerald P. Murphy|work=Lazy Bee Scripts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Purr-fect Crime", Season 1, Episode 19 of the U.S. television series [[Batman (TV series)|''Batman'']] ends with a cliffhanger in which Batman is presented with two doors; one of which opens to Catwoman and the other opens to a tiger. Batman has no hint and chooses the door that has the tiger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Batman (TV Series): The Purr-fect Crime (1966): Plot Summary |publisher=IMDb |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0519547/plotsummary |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3314 (XXIX) (Definition of Aggression)''' was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on December 14, 1974 as a non-binding recommendation to the [[United Nations Security Council]] on the definition it should use for the [[crime of aggression]].&lt;ref name=Yoram/&gt;

== Background ==
The adoption of the definition was the culmination of a long process begun in 1923 under the auspices of the [[League of Nations]]. In December 1967 the General Assembly adopted Resolution 2330 (XXII), which established a Special Committee on the Question of Defining Aggression. This body comprised 35 member states.&lt;ref name="UN_ARES2330XXII_page2"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-2330(XXII) |type=Resolution| body=General Assembly |page=2 |accessdate=2007-11-13|date=18 December 1967|title=Need to expedite the drafting of a definition of aggression in light of the present international situation}}&lt;/ref&gt; After seven years, it reported back to the General Assembly with draft proposals that formed the basis of the final Definition of Aggression.&lt;ref name="UN_ARES3314XXIX_page1"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-3314(XXIX) |type=Resolution| body=General Assembly ||page=1 |accessdate=2007-11-13| title=Definition of aggression}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The definition of aggression ==
The definition makes a distinction between ''[[aggression]]'' (which "gives rise to international responsibility") and ''[[war of aggression]]'' (which is "a crime against international peace"). Article 3 "in accordance with the provisions of article 2", defines certain acts as aggression, such as armed invasions or attacks, bombardments, blockades, armed violations of territory, permitting other states to use one's own territory to perpetrate acts of aggression and the employment of armed irregulars or mercenaries to carry out acts of aggression. Article 2 states that the first use of force in contravention of the UN Charter will be prima facie evidence of aggression, but the Security Council has the authority to determine that given the circumstances aggression has not taken place. A war of aggression is a series of acts committed with a sustained intent. The definition's distinction between an ''act'' of aggression and a ''war'' of aggression make it clear that not every act of aggression would constitute a crime against peace; only war of aggression does. States would nonetheless be held responsible for acts of aggression.

== Criticisms of the definition ==
The wording of the definition has been criticised by many commentators. Its clauses on the use of armed irregulars are vague, as it is unclear what level of "involvement" would entail state responsibility. It is also highly state-centric, in that it deems states to be the only actors liable for acts of aggression. Domestic or transnational insurgent groups, such as those that took part in the [[Sierra Leone Civil War]] and the [[Yugoslav Wars]], were key players in their respective conflicts despite being non-state parties; they would not have come within the scope of the definition.

The Definition of Aggression also does not cover acts by international organisations. The two key military alliances at the time of the definition's adoption, [[NATO]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]], were non-state parties and thus were outside the scope of the definition.&lt;ref&gt;Ingrid Detter Delupis, ''The Law of War'', pp. 69-70. Cambridge University Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the definition does not deal with the responsibilities of individuals for acts of aggression. It is widely perceived as an insufficient basis on which to ground individual criminal prosecutions.&lt;ref&gt;L.F. Damrosch, "Enforcing International Law through Non-forcible Measures", p. 202. ''Recueil De Cours/Collected Courses'', Académie de Droit International de La Haye, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition is not binding on the Security Council. The [[United Nations Charter]] empowers the General Assembly to make recommendations to the [[United Nations Security Council]] but the Assembly may not dictate to the Council. The resolution accompanying the definition states that it is intended to provide guidance to the Security Council to aid it "in determining, in accordance with the Charter, the existence of an act of aggression".&lt;ref name=Yoram&gt;[[Yoram Dinstein]], ''War, Aggression and Self-Defence'', p. 118. Cambridge University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The Security Council may apply or disregard this guidance as it sees fit. Legal commentators argued in 1999 that the Definition of Aggression has had "no visible impact" on the deliberations of the Security Council.&lt;ref&gt;M.C. Bassiouni and B.B. Ferencz, "The Crime against Peace", ''International Criminal Law'', I, 313, 334 (M.C. Bassiouni ed., 2nd ed., 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12795">'''Value theory''' is a range of approaches to understanding how, why, and to what degree persons value things; whether the object or subject of valuing is a person, idea, object, or anything else.

This investigation began in ancient [[philosophy]], where it is called axiology or [[ethics]]. Early philosophical investigations sought to understand [[good and evil]] and the concept of "the good". Today, much of value theory aspires to the [[science|scientifically]] [[empirical]], recording what people do value and attempting to understand why they value it in the context of [[psychology]], [[sociology]], and [[economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Detmer|title=Freedom as a Value: A Critique of the Ethical Theory of Jean-Paul Sartre|publisher=Open Court Publishing|year=1988|isbn=978-0812690835}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the general level, there is a difference between moral and natural goods. Moral goods are those that have to do with the conduct of persons, usually leading to praise or blame. Natural goods, on the other hand, have to do with objects, not persons. For example, the statement "Mary is a good person" uses 'good' very differently than in the statement "That is good food".

Ethics is mainly focused on moral goods rather than natural goods, while economics has a concern in what is economically good for the society but not an individual person and is also interested in natural goods. However, both moral and natural goods are equally relevant to goodness and value theory, which is more general in scope.

==Sociology==
{{Main|Value (personal and cultural)}}
In sociology, value theory is concerned with personal values which are popularly held by a community, and how those values might change under particular conditions. Different groups of people may hold or prioritize different kinds of values influencing social behavior.

Major Western theorists who stress the importance of values as an analytical independent variable include [[Max Weber]], [[Émile Durkheim]], [[Talcott Parsons]], and [[Jürgen Habermas]]. Classical examples of sociological traditions which deny or downplay the question of values are [[Historical institutionalism|institutionalism]], [[historical materialism]] (including Marxism), [[behaviorism]], pragmatic-oriented theories, [[postmodern philosophy]] and various objectivist-oriented theories.

Methods of study range from questionnaire surveys to participant observation.

==Economics==
{{Main|Theory of value (economics)}}
Economic analysis emphasizes goods sought in a market and tends to use the consumer's choices as evidence ([[revealed preference]]) that various products are of [[economic value]]. In this view, religious or political struggle over what "goods" are available in the marketplace is inevitable, and [[consensus]] on some core questions about body and society and ecosystems affected by the transaction, are outside the market's goods so long as they are unowned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Theory of Value: An Axiomatic Analysis of Economic Equilibrium|publisher=Cowles Foundation - Yale University|author=Debreu, G|year=1972|isbn=978-0300015591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some natural goods seem to also be moral  goods. For example, those things that are owned by a person may be said to be natural goods, but over which a particular individual(s) may have moral claims. So it is necessary to make another distinction: between ''moral'' and ''non-moral goods''. A non-moral  good is something that is desirable for someone or other; despite the name to the contrary, it may include moral goods. A moral good is anything which an actor is considered to be morally obligated to strive toward.

When discussing non-moral goods, one may make a useful distinction between inherently serviced and material ''goods in'' the marketplace (or its [[exchange value]]), versus perceived intrinsic and experiential ''goods to'' the buyer. A strict [[service economy]] model takes pains to distinguish between the goods and service guarantees ''to the market'', and that of the service and experience ''to the consumer''.

Sometimes, moral and natural goods can conflict. The value of natural "goods" is challenged by such issues as [[Substance use disorder|addiction]]. The issue of addiction also brings up the distinction between economic and moral goods, where an economic good is whatever stimulates [[economic growth]]. For instance, some claim that [[cigarette]]s are a "good" in the economic sense, as their production can employ [[tobacco]] growers and doctors who treat [[lung cancer]]. Many people would agree that cigarette smoking is not ''morally'' "good", nor ''naturally'' "good," but still recognize that it is economically good, which means, it has exchange value, even though it may have a negative [[public good]] or even be bad for a person's body (not the same as "bad for the person" necessarily&amp;nbsp;– consider the issue of [[suicide]].) 

In [[ecological economics]] value theory is separated into two types: donor-type value and receiver-type value. Ecological economists tend to believe that 'real wealth' needs a donor-determined value as a measure of what things were needed to make an item or generate a service ([[H. T. Odum]], ''Environmental Accounting: Emergy and environmental decision-making'', 1996). An example of receiver-type value is 'market value', or 'willingness to pay', the principal method of accounting used in neo-classical economics.  In contrast, both [[Marx]]'s [[labour theory of value]] and the [[emergy]] concept are conceived as donor-type value. Emergy theorists believe that this conception of value has relevance to all of philosophy, economics, sociology and psychology as well as Environmental Science.

[[Silvio Gesell]] denied value theory in economics. He thought that value theory is useless and prevents economics from becoming science and that a currency administration guided by value theory is doomed to sterility and inactivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://biblio.wiki/wiki/The_Natural_Economic_Order/Part_III/Chapter_3|title=The Natural Economic Order/Part III/Chapter 3 - Bibliowiki|website=biblio.wiki}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics and axiology==
{{Main|Value (ethics)}}

Intuitively, theories of value must be important to ethics. A number of useful distinctions have been made by philosophers in the treatment of value.

===Intrinsic and instrumental value===
{{Main|Instrumental and intrinsic value}}
Many people find it useful to distinguish ''[[instrumental value]]'' and ''[[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]]s'', first discussed by [[Plato]] in the "Republic". An instrumental value is worth having as a means towards getting something else that is good (e.g., a radio is instrumentally good in order to hear music). An intrinsically valuable thing is worth having for itself, not as a means to something else. It is giving value [[intrinsic and extrinsic properties (philosophy)|intrinsic and extrinsic properties]].

Intrinsic and instrumental goods are not mutually exclusive categories. Some things are both good in themselves, and also good for getting other things that are good. "Understanding science" may be such a good, being both worthwhile in and of itself, and as a means of achieving other goods.

A prominent argument in [[environmental ethics]], made by writers like [[Aldo Leopold]] and [[Holmes Rolston III]], is that wild nature and healthy ecosystems have intrinsic value, prior to and apart from their instrumental value as resources for humans, and should therefore be preserved. This line of argument has been articulated further in recent years by Canadian philosopher [[John McMurtry]] within the ''[[Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems]]'' (http://www.eolss.net) published by [[UNESCO]].

===Pragmatism and contributory goodness===
{{Further|Pragmatic ethics}}

[[John Dewey]] (1859-1952), in his book ''Theory of Valuation'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Theory of Valuation |author=Dewey, J|year=1939|publisher=University of Chicago USA|isbn=978-0226575940}}&lt;/ref&gt; sees goodness as the outcome of [[ethic valuation]], a continuous balancing of "ends in view". An end in view is said to be an objective potentially adopted, which may be refined or rejected based on its consistency with other objectives or as a means to objectives already held.

Dewey's empiricist approach evinces [[absolute intrinsic value denial]]; i.e. not accepting intrinsic value as an inherent or enduring property of things. Instead, Dewey sees the appearance of intrinsic value as an illusory product of our continuous valuative activity as purposive beings. In addition to denying categorically that there is anything like intrinsic value, Dewey held the same position with regard to moral values - for Dewey, moral values are also based on a learning process, and are never intrinsic or absolute.

Another contribution of pragmatism to value theory is the idea of contributory goods with a [[contributory conditionality]]. These have the same qualities as the good thing, but need some emergent property of a whole state-of-affairs in order to be good. For example, salt is food on its own, but is far better as part of a prepared meal. In other words, such goods are only "good" when certain conditions are met. This is in contrast to other goods, which may be considered "good" in a wider variety of situations.

===Kant: hypothetical and categorical goods===
The thinking of [[Immanuel Kant]] greatly influenced [[moral philosophy]]. He thought of moral value as a unique and universally identifiable property, as an [[absolute value (philosophy)|absolute value]] rather than a [[Relative value (philosophy)|relative value]]. He showed that many practical goods are good only in states-of-affairs described by a sentence containing an "if" clause, e.g., in the sentence, "Sunshine is only good if you do not live in the desert." Further, the "if" clause often described the category in which the judgment was made (art, science, etc.). Kant described these as "hypothetical goods", and tried to find a "categorical" good that would operate across all categories of judgment without depending on an "if-then" clause.

An influential result of Kant's search was the idea of a ''good will'' being the only [[intrinsic good]]. Moreover, Kant saw a good will as acting in accordance with a moral command, the "[[Categorical Imperative]]": "Act according to those maxims that you could will to be universal law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Critique of Pure Reason|publisher=Macmillan|author= Immanuel Kant  &amp; Gary Banham (Authors) plus other contributors |date=1787–2007 |isbn=978-0230013384}}&lt;/ref&gt;" but should not be confused with the [[Ethic of Reciprocity]] or [[Golden Rule]], e.g. [http://bible.cc/matthew/7-12.htm Mt. 7:12]. Whereas the golden rule states that "One should treat others as one would like others to treat oneself," Kant asks us to analyze whether an act can be performed simultaneously by everyone without exception. For example, murder cannot be performed simultaneously by everyone, one set of people would have to live and the other die. That disparity is an exception. The act cannot be performed without exception, therefore it fails the categorical imperative. Contrast this with the golden rule which is subjective to the individual. Following the logic of the golden rule, if I wanted someone to kill me, then it would be acceptable for me to kill others, because I would be doing to others what I would want done to me. This is very important to keep in mind, because Kant's categorical imperative avoids this flaw. From this, and a few other axioms, Kant developed a moral system that would apply to any "praiseworthy person".&lt;ref name="Kant1786"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|title=Groundlaying toward the Metaphysics of Morals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kantian philosophers believe that any general definition of goodness must define goods that are categorical in the sense that Kant intended.

'''System phenomena''' (also known as and further noted as '''system identification''' and '''[[scientific modeling|modeling]]''') is the science of observing the behaviour of a [[system]]. The classification of a [[dynamic system]] describes how systems are grouped with certain characteristics into special classes and identify mathematical techniques that apply to these classes of problems. 

In particular most systems have five characteristics:
:#[[linear]] or [[nonlinear]]
:#[[Constant (mathematics)|constant]] or [[variable coefficient]]
:#[[forced]] or [[unforced]]
:#[[lumped]] or [[distributed parameter]]
:#[[deterministic]] or [[stochastic]]

'''Political war-weariness''' is the [[public]] or political disapproval for the continuation of a prolonged conflict or [[war]]. The causes normally involve the intensity of [[Casualty (person)|casualties]]—financial, [[civilian]], and [[military]]. It also occurs when a belligerent has the ability to easily leave the conflict yet continues to stay. War-weariness normally leads to a distrust in [[government]] or military leadership and can spark protest and [[anti-war movement|anti-war movements]]. It can also be fueled when a belligerent is found guilty of [[war crime|war crimes]], which can create domestic and international backlash. Rates of enlistment and the [[morale]] of the armed-forces are often affected by war-weariness.

War-weariness is less likely to appear in [[Military dictatorship|military dictatorships]], especially those with heavy propaganda and censorship. According to [[Immanuel Kant]], democratic nations have a better chance of having unpopular news of the war reach the masses, increasing their chance and level of war-weariness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=What Causes War?: An Introduction to Theories of International Conflict|last=Cashman|first=Greg|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2013|isbn=0742566528|location=|pages=234-235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Rights}}

'''Wind rights''' are rights relating to [[windmill]]s, [[wind turbine]]s and [[wind power]]. Historically in [[Continental Europe]] wind rights were manorial rights and obligations relating to the operation and profitability of windmills. In modern times, as wind becomes a more important source of power, rights relating to wind turbines and windmills are sometimes referred to as "wind rights".

== Low Countries ==

Historically, "wind rights" (Dutch: ''windrecht'') referred to a tax paid by [[miller]]s in large parts of the [[Low Countries]] before around 1800. The tax was paid on the "wind catch" (''windvang'') needed to turn a [[windmill]], but it was often based on the windmill's output.&lt;ref&gt; In the northern provinces, however, ancient wind rights were lacking. Government regulations only dated from the 17th century.

Prof. S. J. Fockema Andreae at Leiden University wrote an interesting article on this subject, entitled "Recht van den wind en molendwang", Tijdschrift voor rechtsgeschiedenis, Part 1, Issue 4, 1919, pp. 431-442, Haarlem.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|

This part of the article is an adapted translation of the article on ''windrecht'' at the Dutch version of Wikipedia.|group="N"}}

Since a windmill in a ''[[heerlijkheid]]'' was primarily the property of the lord (although leased out to a miller), wind rights were one way for a lord to discourage competition. In consideration for payment of this tax, the lord ensured that there were no wind obstructions around the mill by imposing a prohibition on buildings and high trees in the area. Another obligation imposed on residents was the "mill obligation" (''molendwang''), which required them to have their grain ground at the lord's mill. To a certain extent, this was another way for a lord to safeguard the income received from the mill.

Because of these rights and obligations, windmills had to be identifiable. They each had a name, traditionally the name of an animal. An image of the animal was placed on the mill so that even the [[Literacy|illiterate]] would know which mill was which.

In the Netherlands, wind rights and the mill obligations were ended around 1800 when a new constitution was introduced in the [[Batavian Republic]]. Similar concepts still exist in modern times. Since around 1973 the wind needed to turn a mill has been referred to as the "windmill [[biotope]]" (''molenbiotoop''). An area of {{convert|375|m|ft}} around a windmill is maintained as a "free zone" so that the windmill can have enough wind. For [[polder]] windmills, ensuring that windmills have enough wind is the responsibility of the [[Water board (The Netherlands)|water board]] (''waterschap'' or ''hoogheemraadschap''). However, this seldom takes priority over the desire of municipalities to build new housing.

== United States ==

In the United States, as a result of the increased interest in wind energy, developers or utilities purchase “wind rights" from landowners to allow the installation of one or more wind generators and an access road to the equipment in exchange for a payment to the landowner.&lt;ref&gt;
