'''Agarose gel electrophoresis''' is a method of [[gel electrophoresis]] used in [[biochemistry]], [[molecular biology]], [[genetics]], and [[clinical chemistry]] to separate a mixed population of macromolecules such as DNA or proteins in a matrix of [[agarose]], one of the two main components of [[agar]]. The proteins may be separated by charge and/or size ([[isoelectric focusing]] agarose electrophoresis is essentially size independent), and the [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] fragments by length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kryndushkin DS, Alexandrov IM, Ter-Avanesyan MD, Kushnirov VV | title = Yeast [PSI+] prion aggregates are formed by small Sup35 polymers fragmented by Hsp104 | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 278 | issue = 49 | pages = 49636–43 | date = December 2003 | pmid = 14507919 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M307996200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Biomolecules are separated by applying an [[electric field]] to move the charged molecules through an agarose matrix, and the biomolecules are separated by size in the agarose gel matrix.&lt;ref&gt;Sambrook J, Russel DW (2001). Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. Cold Spring Harbor, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;

Agarose gel is easy to cast, has relatively fewer charged groups, and is particularly suitable for separating DNA of size range most often encountered in laboratories, which accounts for the popularity of its use. The separated DNA may be viewed with stain, most commonly under UV light, and the DNA fragments can be extracted from the gel with relative ease. Most agarose gels used are between 0.7–2% dissolved in a suitable electrophoresis buffer.

==Properties of agarose gel==
[[File:Two percent Agarose Gel in Borate Buffer cast in a Gel Tray (Front, angled).jpg|right|thumb|An agarose gel cast in tray used for gel electrophoresis]]

[[Agarose]] gel is a three-dimensional matrix formed of helical agarose molecules in supercoiled bundles that are aggregated into three-dimensional structures with channels and pores through which biomolecules can pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Molecular Cloning - A Laboratory Manual |author1=Joseph Sambrook |author2=David Russell |volume=1 |edition=3rd |chapter=Chapter 5, protocol 1  |page=5.4 |isbn=978-0-87969-577-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 3-D structure is held together with hydrogen bonds and can therefore be disrupted by heating back to a liquid state. The melting temperature is different from the gelling temperature, depending on the sources, agarose gel has a gelling temperature of 35–42&amp;nbsp;°C and a melting temperature of 85–95&amp;nbsp;°C. Low-melting and low-gelling agaroses made through chemical modifications are also available.

Agarose gel has large pore size and good gel strength, making it suitable as an anticonvection medium for the electrophoresis of DNA and large protein molecules. The pore size of a 1% gel has been estimated from 100&amp;nbsp;nm to 200–500&amp;nbsp;nm,&lt;ref name="zimm"/&gt;&lt;ref name=viovy&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Reviews of Modern Physics |volume= 72 |pages= 813–872 |year=2000 |title=Electrophoresis of DNA and other polyelectrolytes: Physical mechanisms|author =Jean-Louis Viovy  |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.72.813 |bibcode=2000RvMP...72..813V}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its gel strength allows gels as dilute as 0.15% to form a slab for gel electrophoresis.&lt;ref name="serwer"/&gt; Low-concentration gels (0.1–0.2%) however are fragile and therefore hard to handle. Agarose gel has lower resolving power than polyacrylamide gel for DNA but has a greater range of separation, and is therefore used for DNA fragments of usually 50–20,000 bp in size. The limit of resolution for standard agarose gel electrophoresis is around 750 kb, but resolution of over 6 Mb is possible with [[pulsed field gel electrophoresis]] (PFGE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Molecular Cloning - A Laboratory Manual |author1=Joseph Sambrook |author2=David Russell |volume=1 |edition=3rd |chapter=Chapter 5, protocol 1 |page=5.2–5.3  |isbn=978-0-87969-577-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be used to separate large proteins, and it is the preferred matrix for the gel electrophoresis of particles with effective radii larger than 5–10&amp;nbsp;nm. A 0.9% agarose gel has pores large enough for the entry of [[bacteriophage T4]].&lt;ref name="serwer"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Agarose gels: Properties and use for electrophoresis |author =Philip Serwer |journal=Electrophoresis |volume = 4 |issue =6 |pages =375–382 |year= 1983 |doi=10.1002/elps.1150040602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agarose polymer contains charged groups, in particular [[pyruvate]] and [[sulphate]].&lt;ref name="lonza"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bio.lonza.com/uploads/tx_mwaxmarketingmaterial/Lonza_BenchGuides_SourceBook_Appendix_B_-_Agarose_Physical_Chemistry.pdf |title=Appendix B: Agarose Physical Chemistry |work=Lonza Group }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These negatively charged groups create a flow of water in the opposite direction to the movement of DNA in a process called [[electroendosmosis]] (EEO), and can therefore retard the movement of DNA and cause blurring of bands. Higher concentration gels would have higher electroosmotic flow. Low EEO agarose is therefore generally preferred for use in agarose [[gel electrophoresis of nucleic acids]], but high EEO agarose may be used for other purposes. The lower sulphate content of low EEO agarose, particularly low-melting point (LMP) agarose, is also beneficial in cases where the DNA extracted from gel is to be used for further manipulation as the presence of contaminating sulphates may affect some subsequent procedures, such as [[ligation (molecular biology)|ligation]] and [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]].  Zero EEO agaroses however are undesirable for some applications as they may be made by adding positively charged groups and such groups can affect subsequent enzyme reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Molecular Cloning - A Laboratory Manual |author1=Joseph Sambrook |author2=David Russell |volume=1 |edition=3rd |chapter=Chapter 5, protocol 1 |page=5.7 |isbn=978-0-87969-577-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Electroendosmosis is a reason agarose is used in preference to [[agar]] as the [[agaropectin]] component in agar contains a significant amount of negatively charged sulphate and carboxyl groups. The removal of agaropectin in agarose substantially reduces the EEO, as well as reducing the non-specific adsorption of biomolecules to the gel matrix.  However, for some applications such as the electrophoresis of serum proteins, a high EEO may be desirable, and agaropectin may be added in the gel used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z-bZ_FZHqRcC&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Protein Electrophoresis in Clinical Diagnosis|first= David |last=Keren |pages=7–8 |publisher=CRC Press |date=26 September 2003|isbn=978-0340812136 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Migration of nucleic acids in agarose gel==
{{main article|Gel electrophoresis of nucleic acids}}

===Factors affecting migration of nucleic acid in gel===
[[File:Plasmid miniprep.jpg|thumb|280px|Gels of plasmid preparations usually show a major band of supercoiled DNA with other fainter bands in the same lane. Note that by convention DNA gel is displayed with smaller DNA fragments nearer to the bottom of the gel. This is because historically DNA gels were run vertically and the smaller DNA fragments move downwards faster.]]

A number of factors can affect the migration of nucleic acids: the dimension of the gel pores (gel concentration), size of DNA being electrophoresed, the voltage used, the ionic strength of the buffer, and the concentration of intercalating dye such as ethidium bromide if used during electrophoresis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=G. Lucotte |author2=F. Baneyx |title= Introduction to Molecular Cloning Techniques |page=32 | year=1993 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn=978-0471188490 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smaller molecules travel faster than larger molecules in gel, and double-stranded DNA moves at a rate that is inversely proportional to the logarithm of the number of base pairs. This relationship however breaks down with very large DNA fragments, and separation of very large DNA fragments requires the use of [[pulsed field gel electrophoresis]] (PFGE), which applies alternating current from two different directions and the large DNA fragments are separated as they reorient themselves with the changing current.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee PY, Costumbrado J, Hsu CY, Kim YH | title = Agarose gel electrophoresis for the separation of DNA fragments | journal = Journal of Visualized Experiments | issue = 62 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22546956 | pmc = 4846332 | doi = 10.3791/3923 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For standard agarose gel electrophoresis, larger molecules are resolved better using a low concentration gel while smaller molecules separate better at high concentration gel. High concentrations gel however requires longer run times (sometimes days).

The movement of the DNA may be affected by the [[Chemical structure|conformation]] of the DNA molecule, for example, [[DNA supercoil|supercoiled DNA]] usually moves faster than relaxed DNA because it is tightly coiled and hence more compact. In a normal plasmid DNA preparation, multiple forms of DNA may be present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q6Yd-qYvx9UC&amp;pg=PA97&amp;lpg=PA97&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=DNA Structure and Function |author = Richard R. Sinden |page= 97 |publisher=Academic Press Inc. |isbn=978-0126457506}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gel electrophoresis of the plasmids would normally show the negatively supercoiled form as the main band, while nicked DNA (open circular form) and the relaxed closed circular form appears as minor bands. The rate at which the various forms move however can change using different electrophoresis conditions,&lt;ref name=sambrook1&gt;{{cite book |title=Molecular Cloning - A Laboratory Manual |author1=Joseph Sambrook |author2=David Russell |volume=1 |edition=3rd |chapter=Chapter 5, protocol 1 |page=5.5-5.6 |isbn=978-0-87969-577-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the mobility of larger circular DNA may be more strongly affected than linear DNA by the pore size of the gel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aaij C, Borst P | title = The gel electrophoresis of DNA | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 269 | issue = 2 | pages = 192–200 | date = May 1972 | pmid = 5063906 | doi = 10.1016/0005-2787(72)90426-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethidium bromide which intercalates into circular DNA can change the charge, length, as well as the superhelicity of the DNA molecule, therefore its presence in gel during electrophoresis can affect its movement. For example, the positive charge of ethidium bromide can reduce the DNA movement by 15%.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Agarose gel electrophoresis can be used to resolve circular DNA with different supercoiling topology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Biochemistry |author1=Donald Voet |author2=Judith G. Voet |edition=2nd |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |pages=877–878 |year=1995 |isbn=978-0471586517 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DNA damage due to increased [[cross-link]]ing will also reduce electrophoretic DNA migration in a dose-dependent way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blasiak J, Trzeciak A, Malecka-Panas E, Drzewoski J, Wojewódzka M | title = In vitro genotoxicity of ethanol and acetaldehyde in human lymphocytes and the gastrointestinal tract mucosa cells | journal = Toxicology in Vitro | volume = 14 | issue = 4 | pages = 287–95 | date = August 2000 | pmid = 10906435 | doi = 10.1016/S0887-2333(00)00022-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lu Y, Morimoto K | title = Is habitual alcohol drinking associated with reduced electrophoretic DNA migration in peripheral blood leukocytes from ALDH2-deficient male Japanese? | journal = Mutagenesis | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | pages = 303–8 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19286920 | doi = 10.1093/mutage/gep008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rate of migration of the DNA is proportional to the voltage applied, i.e. the higher the voltage, the faster the DNA moves. The resolution of large DNA fragments however is lower at high voltage. The mobility of DNA may also change in an unsteady field – in a field that is periodically reversed, the mobility of DNA of a particular size may drop significantly at a particular cycling frequency.&lt;ref name="zimm"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zimm BH, Levene SD | title = Problems and prospects in the theory of gel electrophoresis of DNA | journal = Quarterly Reviews of Biophysics | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 171–204 | date = May 1992 | pmid = 1518924 | doi = 10.1017/s0033583500004662 | url = http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gold/pdfs/teaching/ufk_papers/electrokinetics/zimm.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This phenomenon can result in band inversion in field inversion gel electrophoresis (FIGE), whereby larger DNA fragments move faster than smaller ones.

===Migration anomalies===
* "Smiley" gels - this edge effect is caused when the voltage applied is too high for the gel concentration used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=G. Lucotte |author2=F. Baneyx |title= Introduction to Molecular Cloning Techniques |page=41 | year=1993 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn=978-0471188490 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Overloading of DNA - overloading of DNA slows down the migration of DNA fragments.
* Contamination - presence of impurities, such as salts or proteins can affect the movement of the DNA.

===Mechanism of migration and separation===

The negative charge of its phosphate backbone moves the DNA towards the positively charged anode during electrophoresis. However, the migration of DNA molecules in solution, in the absence of a gel matrix, is independent of molecular weight during electrophoresis.&lt;ref name="zimm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="old &amp; primrose"&gt;{{cite book |title=Principle of Gene Manipulation - An Introduction to Genetic Engineering |author1=Robert W. Old |author2=Sandy B. Primrose |page=9 |publisher=Blackwell Scientific |edition=5th |isbn=9780632037124 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The gel matrix is therefore responsible for the separation of DNA by size during electrophoresis, and a number of models exist to explain the mechanism of separation of biomolecules in gel matrix. A widely accepted one is the Ogston model which treats the polymer matrix as a sieve. A globular protein or a [[random coil]] DNA moves through the interconnected pores, and the movement of larger molecules is more likely to be impeded and slowed down by collisions with the gel matrix, and the molecules of different sizes can therefore be separated in this sieving process.&lt;ref name="zimm" /&gt;

The Ogston model however breaks down for large molecules whereby the pores are significantly smaller than size of the molecule. For DNA molecules of size greater than 1 kb, a [[reptation]] model (or its variants) is most commonly used. This model assumes that the DNA can crawl in a "snake-like" fashion (hence "reptation") through the pores as an elongated molecule. A biased reptation model applies at higher electric field strength, whereby the leading end of the molecule become strongly biased in the forward direction and pulls the rest of the molecule along.&lt;ref name="microfluidics"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8wyBp-vKbdcC&amp;pg=PA125&amp;lpg=PA125&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Microfluidics for Biological Applications |editor1=Tian, Wei-Cheng |editor2=Finehout, Erin |chapter=Chapter 4 - Genetic Analysis in Miniaturized Electrophoresis Systems |author1=Li Zhu |author2=Hong Wang |page=125 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-387-09480-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Real-time fluorescence microscopy of stained molecules, however, showed more subtle dynamics during electrophoresis, with the DNA showing considerable elasticity as it alternately stretching in the direction of the applied field and then contracting into a ball, or becoming hooked into a U-shape when it gets caught on the polymer fibres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith SB, Aldridge PK, Callis JB | title = Observation of individual DNA molecules undergoing gel electrophoresis | journal = Science | volume = 243 | issue = 4888 | pages = 203–6 | date = January 1989 | pmid = 2911733 | doi = 10.1126/science.2911733 | bibcode = 1989Sci...243..203S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schwartz DC, Koval M | title = Conformational dynamics of individual DNA molecules during gel electrophoresis | journal = Nature | volume = 338 | issue = 6215 | pages = 520–2 | date = April 1989 | pmid = 2927511 | doi = 10.1038/338520a0 | bibcode = 1989Natur.338..520S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General procedure==

The details of an agarose gel electrophoresis experiment may vary depending on methods, but most follow a general procedure.
[[File:Agarose Gel Electrophoresis - Assembling the Rig and Loading-Running the Gel.webm|thumb|none|Video showing assembly of the rig and loading/running of the gel.]]

===Casting of gel===
[[File:Loading DNA samples into an agarose gel for electrophoresis - CPHST - USDA photo.jpg|thumb|180px|Loading DNA samples into the wells of an agarose gel using a multi-channel pipette.]]

The gel is prepared by dissolving the agarose powder in an appropriate buffer, such as TAE or TBE, to be used in electrophoresis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Agarose Gel Electrophoresis for the Separation of DNA Fragments |url=http://www.jove.com/video/3923/agarose-gel-electrophoresis-for-the-separation-of-dna-fragments |author1=Pei Yun Lee |author2=John Costumbrado |author3=Chih-Yuan Hsu |author4=Yong Hoon Kim |publisher=The Journal of Visualized Experiments |pmid= 22546956 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The agarose is dispersed in the buffer before heating it to near-boiling point, but avoid boiling. The melted agarose is allowed to cool sufficiently before pouring the solution into a cast as the cast may warp or crack if the agarose solution is too hot. A comb is placed in the cast to create wells for loading sample, and the gel should be completely set before use.

The concentration of gel affects the resolution of DNA separation. For a standard agarose gel electrophoresis, a 0.8% gives good separation or resolution of large 5–10kb DNA fragments, while 2% gel gives good resolution for small 0.2–1kb fragments. 1% gels is often used for a standard electrophoresis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Agarose gel electrophoresis (basic method) |url=http://www.methodbook.net/dna/agarogel.html|work=Biological Protocols|accessdate=23 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concentration is measured in weight of agarose over volume of buffer used (g/ml). High percentage gels are often brittle and may not set evenly, while low percentage gels (0.1-0.2%) are fragile and not easy to handle. Low-melting-point (LMP) agarose gels are also more fragile than normal agarose gel.  Low-melting point agarose may be used on its own or simultaneously with standard agarose for the separation and isolation of DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fotadar U, Shapiro LE, Surks MI | title = Simultaneous use of standard and low-melting agarose for the separation and isolation of DNA by electrophoresis | journal = BioTechniques | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = 171–2 | date = February 1991 | pmid = 2059440 }}&lt;/ref&gt; PFGE and FIGE are often done with high percentage agarose gels.

===Loading of samples===
Once the gel has set, the comb is removed, leaving wells where DNA samples can be loaded. Loading buffer is mixed with the DNA sample before the mixture is loaded into the wells. The loading buffer contains a dense compound, which may be glycerol, sucrose, or [[Ficoll]], that raises the density of the sample so that the DNA sample may sink to the bottom of the well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee PY, Costumbrado J, Hsu CY, Kim YH | title = Agarose gel electrophoresis for the separation of DNA fragments | journal = Journal of Visualized Experiments | volume = 62 | issue = 62 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22546956 | pmc = 4846332 | doi = 10.3791/3923 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the DNA sample contains residual ethanol after its preparation, it may float out of the well. The loading buffer also includes colored dyes such as [[xylene cyanol]] and [[bromophenol blue]] used to monitor the progress of the electrophoresis. The DNA samples are loaded using a [[pipette]].

===Electrophoresis===
[[File:Electrophoresis - Moving along gel.jpg|thumb|Agarose gel slab in electrophoresis tank with bands of dyes indicating progress of the electrophoresis. The DNA moves towards anode.]]
Agarose gel electrophoresis is most commonly done horizontally in a submarine mode whereby the slab gel is completely submerged in buffer during electrophoresis. It is also possible, but less common, to perform the electrophoresis vertically, as well as horizontally with the gel raised on agarose legs using an appropriate apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Physical Biochemistry: Applications to Biochemistry and Molecular Biology |author =David Freifelder |edition=2nd |year=1982 |publisher=WH Freeman |pages= 292–293 |isbn= 978-0716714446}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The buffer used in the gel is the same as the running buffer in the electrophoresis tank, which is why electrophoresis in the submarine mode is possible with agarose gel.

For optimal resolution of DNA greater than 2{{Spaces}}kb in size in standard gel electrophoresis, 5 to 8 V/cm is recommended (the distance in cm refers to the distance between electrodes, therefore this recommended voltage would be 5 to 8 multiplied by the distance between the electrodes in cm).&lt;ref name=sambrook1/&gt;   Voltage may also be limited by the fact that it heats the gel and may cause the gel to melt if it is run at high voltage for a prolonged period, especially if the gel used is LMP agarose gel. Too high a voltage may also reduce resolution, as well as causing band streaking for large DNA molecules. Too low a voltage may lead to broadening of band for small DNA fragments due to dispersion and diffusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bio.lonza.com/uploads/tx_mwaxmarketingmaterial/Lonza_BenchGuides_SourceBook_Section_III_-_Loading_and_Running_DNA_in_Agarose_Gels.pdf |title=Section III: Loading and Running DNA in Agarose Gels |work=Lonza Group }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since DNA is not visible in natural light, the progress of the electrophoresis is monitored using colored dyes. Xylene cyanol (light blue color) comigrates large DNA fragments, while Bromophenol blue (dark blue) comigrates with the smaller fragments. Less commonly used dyes include [[Cresol Red]] and [[Orange G]] which migrate ahead of bromophenol blue. A [[Molecular weight size marker|DNA marker]] is also run together for the estimation of the molecular weight of the DNA fragments. Note however that the size of a circular DNA like plasmids cannot be accurately gauged using standard markers unless it has been linearized by [[restriction digest]], alternatively a supercoiled DNA marker may be used.

===Staining and visualization===
[[Image:AgarosegelUV.jpg|thumb| The gel with UV illumination: DNA stained with [[ethidium bromide]] appears as glowing orange bands.]]

DNA as well as RNA are normally visualized by staining with [[ethidium bromide]], which intercalates into the major grooves of the DNA and fluoresces under UV light. The intercalation depends on the concentration of DNA and thus, a band with high intensity will indicate a higher amount of DNA compared to a band of less intensity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The ethidium bromide may be added to the agarose solution before it gels, or the DNA gel may be stained later after electrophoresis. Destaining of the gel is not necessary but may produce better images. Other methods of staining are available; examples are [[SYBR Green I|SYBR Green]], [[GelRed]], [[methylene blue]], [[brilliant cresyl blue]], [[Nile blue]] sulphate, and [[crystal violet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncbe.reading.ac.uk/ncbe/protocols/DNA/PDF/DNA14.pdf |title=DNA revealed |work=National Centre for Biotechnology education |publisher=University of Reading |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304065032/http://www.ncbe.reading.ac.uk/ncbe/PROTOCOLS/DNA/PDF/DNA14.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; SYBR Green, GelRed and other similar commercial products are sold as safer alternatives to ethidium bromide as it has been shown to be [[mutagenic]] in [[Ames test]], although the [[carcinogenicity]] of ethidium bromide has not actually been established. SYBR Green requires the use of a blue-light transilluminator. DNA stained with crystal violet can be viewed under natural light without the use of a UV transilluminator which is an advantage, however it may not produce a strong band.

When stained with ethidium bromide, the gel is viewed with an [[ultraviolet]] (UV) transilluminator. The UV light excites the electrons within the aromatic ring of ethidium bromide, and once they return to the ground state, light is released, making the DNA and ethidium bromide complex fluoresce.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Standard transilluminators use wavelengths of 302/312-nm (UV-B), however exposure of DNA to UV radiation for as little as 45 seconds can produce damage to DNA and affect subsequent procedures, for example reducing the efficiency of [[Transformation efficiency|transformation]], ''in vitro'' [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]], and [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gründemann D, Schömig E | title = Protection of DNA during preparative agarose gel electrophoresis against damage induced by ultraviolet light | journal = BioTechniques | volume = 21 | issue = 5 | pages = 898–903 | date = November 1996 | pmid = 8922632 | url = http://www.biotechniques.com/multimedia/archive/00009/96215rr02_9961a.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Exposure of the DNA to UV radiation therefore should be limited. Using a higher wavelength of 365&amp;nbsp;nm (UV-A range) causes less damage to the DNA but also produces much weaker fluorescence with ethidium bromide. Where multiple wavelengths can be selected in the transillumintor, the shorter wavelength would be used to capture images, while the longer wavelength should be used if it is necessary to work on the gel for any extended period of time.

The transilluminator apparatus may also contain image capture devices, such as a digital or polaroid camera, that allow an image of the gel to be taken or printed.

For gel electrophoresis of protein, the bands may be visualised with [[Coomassie Brilliant Blue|Coomassie]] or [[Silver stain|silver stains]].

===Downstream procedures===
The separated DNA bands are often used for further procedures, and a DNA band may be cut out of the gel as a slice, dissolved and purified. Contaminants however may affect some downstream procedures such as PCR, and low melting point agarose may be preferred in some cases as it contains fewer of the sulphates that can affect some enzymatic reactions. The gels may also be used for blotting techniques.

==Buffers==
In general, the ideal buffer should have good conductivity, produce less heat and have a long life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Gel electrophoresis – Principles and Basics |editor=Sameh Magdeldin |year=2012 |publisher=InTech |isbn=978-953-51-0458-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of buffers used for agarose electrophoresis; common ones for nucleic acids include [[TAE buffer|Tris/Acetate/EDTA]] (TAE) and [[TBE buffer|Tris/Borate/EDTA]] (TBE).   The buffers used contain EDTA to inactivate many nucleases which require divalent cation for their function. The borate in TBE buffer can be problematic as borate can polymerize, and/or interact with cis diols such as those found in RNA. TAE has the lowest buffering capacity, but it provides the best resolution for larger DNA. This means a lower voltage and more time, but a better product.

Many other buffers have been proposed, e.g. [[LB buffer|lithium borate]] (LB), iso electric histidine, pK matched goods buffers, etc.; in most cases the purported rationale is lower current (less heat) and or matched ion mobilities, which leads to longer buffer life. Tris-phosphate buffer has high buffering capacity but cannot be used if DNA extracted is to be used in phosphate sensitive reaction. LB is relatively new and is ineffective in resolving fragments larger than 5 kbp; However, with its low conductivity, a much higher voltage could be used (up to 35 V/cm), which means a shorter analysis time for routine electrophoresis. As low as one base pair size difference could be resolved in 3% agarose gel with an extremely low conductivity medium (1 mM lithium borate).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brody JR, Kern SE | title = History and principles of conductive media for standard DNA electrophoresis | journal = Analytical Biochemistry | volume = 333 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–13 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15351274 | doi = 10.1016/j.ab.2004.05.054 | url = http://www.cc.ahs.chula.ac.th/Molmed/DNA%20electro%27s%20conductive%20media.pdf | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121224121719/http://www.cc.ahs.chula.ac.th/Molmed/DNA%20electro%27s%20conductive%20media.pdf | deadurl = yes | archivedate = 24 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other buffering system may be used in specific applications, for example, barbituric acid-sodium barbiturate or Tris-[[Barbital|barbiturate]] buffers may be used for in agarose gel electrophoresis of proteins, for example in the detection of abnormal distribution of proteins.&lt;ref name="jeppson"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jeppsson JO, Laurell CB, Franzén B | title = Agarose gel electrophoresis | journal = Clinical Chemistry | volume = 25 | issue = 4 | pages = 629–38 | date = April 1979 | pmid = 313856 | url = http://clinchem.aaccjnls.org/content/25/4/629.long }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
*Estimation of the size of DNA molecules following digestion with [[restriction enzyme]]s, e.g. in [[Restriction map|restriction mapping]] of cloned DNA.
*Analysis of products of a [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), e.g. in molecular [[Preimplantation genetic diagnosis|genetic diagnosis]] or [[genetic fingerprinting]]
*Separation of DNA fragments for extraction and purification.
*Separation of restricted genomic DNA prior to [[Southern blot|Southern transfer]], or of RNA prior to [[Northern Blot|Northern transfer]].
*Separation of proteins, for example, screening of protein abnormalities in [[clinical chemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://dmbj.org.rs/jmb/pdf/2010-1/2.pdf |title=Agarose gel electrophoresis: Application in Clinial Chemistry |work=Journal of Medical Biochemistry |doi=10.2478/v10011-009-0033-8 |volume=29|pages= 9–14|date= 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agarose gels are easily cast and handled compared to other matrices and nucleic acids are not chemically altered during electrophoresis. Samples are also easily recovered. After the experiment is finished, the resulting gel can be stored in a plastic bag in a refrigerator.

Electrophoresis is performed in buffer solutions to reduce pH changes due to the electric field, which is important because the charge of DNA and RNA depends on pH, but running for too long can exhaust the buffering capacity of the solution. Further, different preparations of genetic material may not migrate consistently with each other, for morphological or other reasons.

'''André Georges Journel''' is a [[French American]] [[engineer]] who excelled in formulating and promoting [[geostatistics]] in the [[earth sciences]] and [[engineering]], first from the [[Centre of Mathematical Morphology]] in [[Fontainebleau]], France and later from [[Stanford University]].

==Education==
*D.Sc., [[University of Nancy]], [[Applied Mathematics]], 1977
*M.S2., [[University of Nancy]], [[Doctor of Engineering]], 1974
*B.Sc., [[École Nationale Supérieure des Mines de Nancy]], [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], [[Mining Engineering]], 1967

==Early professional career in France==
André joined the [[Paris School of Mines]] research group at Fontainebleau, under the direction of [[Georges Matheron]], as a Mining Project Engineer in 1969, moving to Head of Research four years later.  He remained active primarily teaching courses,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.saimm.co.za/news/398-memories-of-danie-krige-geostatistician-extraordinaire&lt;/ref&gt; doing consulting work for mining companies around the world, and simultaneously formulating new methods often to solve pressing problems. From these days are his contributions to kriging with a trend&lt;ref&gt;André G. Journel (1969).  Study for the estimation of a regionalized variable: application to seafloor cartography (in French). Navy Hydrographic Service, Paris, 153 p.&lt;/ref&gt;  and to stochastic simulation.&lt;ref&gt;André G. Journel (1974). Geostatistics for conditional simulation of ore bodies. Economic Geology 69(5), 673–687&lt;/ref&gt;  The book with Charles Huijbregts is a culmination to his endeavors as mining geostatistician from his native country.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abebooks.com/9780123910561/Mining-Geostatistics-Journel-Huijbregts-0123910560/plp&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second stage at Stanford University==
Journel accepted a position as an Assistant Professor at the Department of Applied Earth Sciences in 1978.  The physical relocation was shortly followed by a reorientation of his research from mining to [[petroleum engineering]].  He was promoted to full professor in 1986 and within the year appointed Chairman of the Department, serving for a period of 6 years.  He was the mentor of several generations of students and enthusiastic promoter of joint research with industry through the Stanford Center for Reservoir Forecasting that he founded also in 1986, remaining as its Director until 2007.&lt;ref&gt;https://pangea.stanford.edu/researchgroups/scrf/&lt;/ref&gt;  Among his numerous research interest and accomplishments, it is worth mentioning his contributions to non-parametric geostatistics,&lt;ref&gt;André G. Journel (1983).  Non-parametric estimation of spatial distributions Journal of the International Association for Mathematical Geology 15(3), 445–468.&lt;/ref&gt; non-Gaussian geostatistics,&lt;ref&gt;André Journel (1988).

[[Metal]]s used for [[Architecture|architectural]] purposes include [[lead (metal)|lead]], for [[water pipes]], [[roofing material|roofing]], and windows; [[tin]], formed into [[tinplate]]; [[zinc]], [[copper]] and [[aluminium]], in a range of applications including roofing and decoration; and [[iron]], which has structural and other uses in the form of [[cast iron]] or [[wrought iron]], or made into [[steel]]. Metal [[alloy]]s used in building include [[bronze]] (mainly copper and tin); [[brass]] (copper and zinc); [[monel metal]] and [[nickel silver]], mainly consisting of nickel and copper; and [[stainless steel]], with important components of nickel and [[chromium]].

== Metal types ==

=== Lead ===
The low [[melting point]] of lead permitted its use on a wide scale throughout human history. [[Water pipes]] were frequently constructed of lead, until its health hazards were publicised in the late 19th century.

Lead has been a popular [[roofing material]] for centuries, being used for roofing, flashing, gutters, downspouts, and conductor heads. Lead was best suited for low-pitched roofs, as steep roofs experienced creep. Lead roofs in regions with large temperature fluctuations, such as the [[mid-Atlantic states]], experienced deterioration from constant expansion and contraction, called fatigue. Beginning in the 19th century, a roofing material called “[[terne]]” or “terneplate” was used, consisting of sheet iron or sheet steel coated with a lead-tin [[alloy]]. It is frequently confused with [[tinplate]].&lt;ref&gt;Gayle &amp; Waite (1980), pp 8-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lead [[came]] was also frequently used for window panes in skylights and stained glass. It was also used for small pieces of sculpture and garden ornamentation. Lead was frequently added to paint, with red lead used as an anti-corrosive pigment for iron, and white lead used as paint for wooden houses. [[Lead-based paint]] was one of the most durable materials developed as a protective exterior coating. The use of lead paint has been restricted on most buildings, due to concerns of [[lead poisoning]].

=== Tin ===
The principal architectural uses of [[tin]] fall into two categories: the alloying of tin with other metals such as [[copper]] to form [[bronze]], and the coating of tin on harder metals, such as tinplated iron or steel. Architectural bronzes usually contain about 90% copper and 10% tin, although the content may vary widely. The term “tin ceiling” is a misnomer, as these decorative sheets were never tinned; they were almost always painted sheet iron or steel.

[[Tinplate]] was a type of architectural material consisting of sheet iron coated with tin. “Tin roofs,” a type of tinplate, was originally used for armor but eventually as a roofing material. Tinplate was also used for decoration, such as ornamental windows, door lintels. Although tinplate is still available today for roofing and flashing, it is generally considered expensive since the initial cost is more than that for common modern roofing types such as [[asphalt]] shingles or built-up roofs. A well-maintained tinplate roof typically lasts several times longer than either of these types of roofing, and is more economical when the longer lifespan is taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;Gayle &amp; Waite (1980), pp 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Zinc ===
Pure [[zinc]] was used for roofing in Belgium, France and Germany, where it replaced more expensive copper and lead in roofing. Starting in the 1820s, Belgian sheet zinc was imported in America, used by builders in New York City and elsewhere. Pure zinc is subject to creep at ordinary temperatures.

Zinc-coated metals were first [[patented]] in 1837, separately by M. Sorel in France and H. W. Crawford in England. The methods employed a “hot dipping” process to coat sheet iron with zinc. By 1839 “galvanized” sheet iron roofing was being used in New York City. The Merchant's Exchange in Manhattan was one of the first buildings to have both a galvanized roof and galvanized gutters. Some galvanized sheet roofing was pressed with designs, a popular technique in the Victorian era.&lt;ref&gt;Gayle &amp; Waite (1980), pp 15-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zinc was also cast for sculptures and decorative elements in Germany and Austria as early as 1832. Decorative architectural elements were frequently cast in zinc, since it molded readily, was inexpensive compared to stone, and could be painted to imitate more expensive metals.

[[Zinc oxide]] paints were nontoxic and resistant to [[pollution]]. They became commercially successful and readily available in America in about 1850 and used widely starting around the 1870s. They had the added benefit of being good rust inhibitors on iron and steel.

During the early decades of the 20th century, the use of pure zinc roofing and ornament decreased in use in the US. It is now gaining popularity in its pure form (99.95%)for building materials. Typically, architectural grade zinc is 99.995 percent pure zinc with trace amounts of titanium, to reduce coefficient of thermal expansion and improve tensile strength and hardness, and copper to improve workability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Evans|first1=Layne|title=Architectural Zinc: From Gray to Green|url=http://construction.com/CE/articles/0712rheinzink-2.asp|website=construction.com|publisher=McGraw Hill Construction|accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exact alloy composition is subject to manufacturer and is a color determinant in zinc's final [[patina]].  Over time, zinc develops its distinctive patina, transforming from a shiny silver to a matte bluish-grey.  Pre patinated finishes are available from certain manufacturers to expedite the natural patination process.  Zinc is still used in alloys such as [[brass]] and [[nickel silver]], and in the [[electroplating]] of steel as well. Today, [[galvanized steel]] and pure zinc material, usually Double Locked Standing Seam panels, are used for roofing a variety of buildings. Creep has been reduced by the introduction of [[titanium]] in most architectural zinc available in North America. Galvanized nails and sheet metal ducts are also common.

Architectural grade zinc is 90 to 95% recycled.  Replacement costs are negligible with a long lifetime of 80 to 100 years for zinc roofing and 200 to 300 years for wall systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zinc|url=http://www.metaltech-usa.com/zinc.html|website=www.metaltech-usa.com|accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This long-life durability is a key component in durability.  At the end of its service life, zinc building products can be recycled indefinitely without loss to chemical or physical properties.  The use of architectural grade zinc can help building qualify for [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] certification due to its high recycled content and sustainability.

=== Copper and its alloys ===
{{Main article|Copper in architecture}}

[[Copper]] is a very durable metal, withstanding [[corrosion]] when forming a bluish-green [[patina]] that variably consists of copper [[carbonates]], [[sulfates]], [[sulfides]], and [[chloride]]s. Sheet copper used as roofing is lighter than wooden shingles and much lighter than slate, tile, or lead. Roofing copper can be folded readily into waterproof seams, or shaped over curved frameworks for [[cupolas]] and domes.

The initial cost of copper was traditionally high, but its length of service more than compensated for the price. Copper could also be shaped to the bends and angles around chimneys and at roof edges and dormers. All nails, screws, bolts, and cleats used with sheet copper must be made of copper or a copper alloy, otherwise galvanic action between the dissimilar metals would occur, causing deterioration.&lt;ref&gt;Gayle &amp; Waite (1980), pp 22-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Copper was also used for decorative purposes, including architectural ornaments or sculptures. One famous example is the [[Statue of Liberty]].

Copper alloys used in architecture include [[bronze]], an alloy of copper and tin, and [[brass]], an alloy of copper and zinc.

=== Nickel and its alloys ===
Although somewhat rare, [[nickel]] has been used for plating architectural details. Nickel is most frequently used for building components in the form of alloys: [[nickel silver]], [[Monel metal]], and [[stainless steel]].

Nickel silver was originally called “German Silver,” until World War I. It has been called “white brass” but probably should be termed “nickel brass,” because it generally contains 75% copper, 20% nickel, and 5% zinc. Different percentages result in a range of colors, including silvery-white, yellow, slight blue, green or pink. Nickel silver hardware was popular in the US during the [[Art Deco]] and Depression Modern periods. Architects and designers preferred nickel silver because it could take and retain appropriate finishes, and it resisted corrosion.&lt;ref&gt;Gayle &amp; Waite (1980), p 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Monel metal is an alloy of approximately two-thirds nickel and one-third copper. It is similar to platinum in color. Monel pioneered many of the present uses of stainless steel. The first architectural use of Monel was for roofing the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] Terminal in New York City in 1909. In 1936, the copper roof on the [[New York City Public Library]] at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street was replaced with a Monel metal roof. Its advantages as a roofing material included its ability to be brazed, welded, or soldered in place to provide a watertight, continuous cover. Monel was popular during the Art Deco periods. During World War II large quantities of nickel and copper were diverted to the war effort, and the supply of Monel was greatly reduced. Following the war, stainless steel and aluminium replaced Monel because of lower production costs.&lt;ref&gt;Gayle &amp; Waite (1980), pp 35-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iron and its alloys ===
Iron has become an important architectural building component. It has been used in four common forms: wrought iron, cast iron, sheet iron, and steel.&lt;ref&gt;Gayle &amp; Waite (1980), pp 42-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wrought iron]] was used for minor structural and decorative elements starting in the 18th century. Until the mid-19th century, the use of wrought iron in buildings was generally limited to small items such as tie rods, straps, nails, and hardware, or to decorative ironwork in balconies, railings fences and gates. Around 1850 its structural use became more widespread as iron mills began to roll rails, bulb-tees, and eventually I-beams. It was also used for decorative purposes, such as ornamental balconies or hardware. Since wrought iron is handmade, no two pieces are identical.

[[Cast iron]] was a major 19th century building material of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Although brittle, it is remarkably strong in compression. It was frequently used for structural purposes, such as columns, building fronts, domes and light courts. Decorative uses have included stairs, elevators, lintels, grilles, verandas, balconies, railings, fences, streetlights, and tombs. The [[Bradbury Building]] is an example of extensive decorative cast iron. Today, cast iron is used for plumbing fixtures and piping in new construction, and its structural and decorative use is used occasionally through historic preservation practices.

Sheet iron can be subject to rapid corrosion, forming rust. Sheet iron was used throughout the 19th century, although it is not clear how widespread sheet iron roofs became. Pressed decorative sheet iron used for ceilings was frequently called a “tin ceiling,” although tin was generally not used indoors.

[[Steel]] was introduced to the construction industry at the end of the 19th century. The development of structural steel in the mid-19th century allowed construction of tall buildings. Builders and manufacturers turned to steel, which was stronger than cast iron in compression and wrought iron in tension. When the [[Bessemer process]] was developed in England in 1856, and the open-hearth process was invented, steel was produced in a quantity that allowed it to be economical. Bridges, railroad companies, and skyscrapers were among the first large-scale uses of structural steel. Although iron and steel are not combustible, they lose strength in a fire if they are not protected from the heat. Almost all structural steel must be “fireproofed” in some manner, utilizing a cladding of [[terra-cotta]], tile, plaster-poured concrete, sprayed concrete, or sprayed [[Building insulation|insulation]]. Ferro concrete, also called [[reinforced concrete]], was developed in the late 19th century when steel wire was added to concrete.

Decorative steels used in buildings include:
* [[Stainless steel]], a chromium-nickel steel, developed between 1903 and 1912. Its most important property is its resistance to corrosion. It contains about 18% chromium and 8-12% nickel. Stainless steel is expensive, so it was used primarily as a nonstructural metal or where there is a high potential for corrosion. One of the most extensive early uses of stainless steel was in the [[Chrysler Building]].
* Copper-bearing steels, containing from .15% to .25% copper, develop increased resistance to atmospheric corrosion, when compared to ordinary steel, by forming a protective oxide coating, having a uniform deep brown color and texture. [[Eero Saarinen]] experimented with the material in the [[Deere and Company]] building in 1964.

=== Aluminium ===
Much like copper, [[Aluminium]] is highly resistant to [[corrosion]]. It also has the added benefit of being a third lighter than steel with comparable strength. Aluminium can also be easily and repeatedly recycled. It has been estimated that of the estimated 900 million tonnes of aluminium produced since 1880, three quarters is still in productive use, 35% of which is in building construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://recycling.world-aluminium.org/review/global-metal-flow.html|title = Global Metal Flow|date = |accessdate = 2014-08-15|website = Aluminium for Future Generations|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aluminum|Aluminium]] was unavailable at reasonable cost or in sufficient quantities for general architectural use until after the beginning of the 20th century. Architectural use of aluminum increased in the 1920s, mainly for decorative detailing. It was used for roofing, flashing, gutters, downspouts, wall panels, and spandrels. Art Deco designs frequently used aluminum for ornamental features. The first extensive use of aluminum in construction was the [[Empire State Building]], where the entire tower portion is aluminum, as well as many decorative features, such as the entrances, elevator doors, ornamental trim, and some 6,000 window [[spandrels]]. Today, aluminum is used frequently in construction except major structural members.&lt;ref&gt;Gayle &amp; Waite (1980), pp 84-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arthur Raistrick''' (1896–1991) was a British geologist, [[archaeology|archaeologist]], academic, and writer. He was born in a working class home in [[Saltaire]], [[Yorkshire]]. He was a scholar in many related, and some unrelated, fields. He published some 330 articles, books, pamphlets and scholarly treatises.

==Early life and work==
In his early life he was imprisoned as a [[conscientious objector]] to the [[First World War]]. During his confines in [[Durham, England|Durham]] and [[Wormwood Scrubs]] prisons he began an association with, and later membership of, the [[Society of Friends]], that lasted throughout his life. As well as a [[pacifist]], he was a [[Socialism|socialist]] and had close ties to the early [[Independent Labour Party]] which he greatly valued into his old age.

His interests ranged widely. His early academic life was spent at [[Former colleges of Durham University|Armstrong and Kings Colleges]], Newcastle part of [[Durham University]] (later to become [[Newcastle University]]) where he attained the role of Reader in Applied Geology. His academic writings start from this period of his life, in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Croucher (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

After work in mine safety, he once again settled into an academic life. His interests widened from geology and mining engineering into what would now be termed landscape studies. At the same time, his interest in mechanical engineering led him to carry out pioneering work on the lead mining industry of his native Yorkshire and elsewhere, including ''Two centuries of Industrial Welfare''&lt;ref&gt;Raistrick (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; (on the [[London Lead Company]]).

Once again refusing war service in 1939, Arthur Raistrick was forced to leave his academic post in Newcastle. He stated that King's College "just had to suspend me", without pay.&lt;ref&gt;Joy (1991) p. 13, quoted in Jennings (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[World War II|war years]], he refused to earn sufficient money to pay income tax which would fund the war effort and he spent much of the time in converting a one-time barn into a home for himself and his wife, Sarah Elizabeth (née Chapman).

As a Friend, Arthur Raistrick became interested in the history of Quaker involvement in science and industry, leading him to publish widely on this subject. In the course of this, he was responsible, with others, for pioneering work on the industrial archaeology of the [[Coalbrookdale]] area. His ''Dynasty of Ironfounders''&lt;ref&gt;Raistrick (1989), originally published in 1953&lt;/ref&gt; remains a seminal work on [[Abraham Darby (disambiguation)|the Darbys]] of [[Coalbrookdale]] and their work in the cradle of the industrial revolution.

==An industrial archaeologist==
Raistrick was also a field archaeologist of some renown, specialising in the Craven area of the Yorkshire Dales, around his long-time home at Linton, near [[Grassington]]. His work in the field of industrial archaeology occupied much of his mature years. He published an early work on the subject, ''Industrial Archaeology''&lt;ref&gt;Raistrick (1972)&lt;/ref&gt; which remains in use in undergraduate courses to this day.

As well as his master's degree and doctorate, Arthur Raistrick received Honorary Doctorates from the [[University of Leeds|Universities of Leeds]] and [[University of Bradford|Bradford]]. He was particularly associated with the latter university and bequeathed his extensive mineral collection to it, together with an unrivalled collection of closely annotated maps of the Yorkshire Dales and North Pennines, which form a commentary to his extensive fieldwork. Raistrick worked closely with the [[Craven Museum &amp; Gallery]] donated many finds from his excavations to the museum and in 1969 was chair of the Friends of the Craven Museum group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dalesman of the millennium|url=http://www.cravenherald.co.uk/nostalgia/nostalgia_history/11725884.Dalesman_of_the_Millennium/|website=www.cravenherald.co.uk|publisher=Craven Herald &amp; Pioneer|accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Speak up if you can help Craven Museum and Gallery|url=http://www.cravenherald.co.uk/news/localnews/10958113.Speak_up_if_you_can_help_Craven_Museum_and_Gallery_heritage_project/|website=www.cravenherald.co.uk|publisher=Craven Herald &amp; Pioneer|accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Richard Harland obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/feb/13/richard-harland-obituary|website=www.the guardian.com|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also left the bulk of his large library to [[Bradford University]].&lt;ref&gt;See external links&lt;/ref&gt;

Among other lifelong interests Raistrick was a keen walker, venturing far and wide amongst his beloved Yorkshire Dales and moors. He had been a founder member of the [[Holiday Fellowship]] and was a one time vice-president of the [[Youth Hostels Association (England &amp; Wales)|Youth Hostels Association]]. His interest in landscape and its conservation led to him serving several terms upon the [[Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority]].

==Honours refused==
Offered an [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] by Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]], Raistrick wrote a letter declining the honour, which started, characteristically, "Dear Harold, I am deeply disappointed in you…".&lt;ref&gt;Unpublished letter in the possession of his family&lt;/ref&gt; His lifelong dislike of privilege made it impossible for him even to consider accepting Wilson's offer.

Raistrick was a true polymath. He was a self-taught expert on the organ works of [[J.S. Bach]]. He immersed himself in studies of ancient Chinese civilisation. Until the end of his long life, he retained the daily routine of a working man, rising at 5 am to work through the day until an early bed at 8 pm.

As a tribute to his accomplishments, the Yorkshire Dales Society named him the ''Dalesman of the Millennium''.&lt;ref&gt;Speakman (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vannevar Bush portrait.jpg|thumb|Vannevar Bush]]

"'''As We May Think'''" is a 1945 essay by [[Vannevar Bush]] which has been described as visionary and influential, anticipating many aspects of [[information society]]. It was first published in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' in July 1945 and republished in an abridged version in September 1945&amp;mdash;before and after the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]. Bush expresses his concern for the direction of scientific efforts toward destruction, rather than understanding, and explicates a desire for a sort of [[collective memory]] machine with his concept of the [[memex]] that would make knowledge more accessible, believing that it would help fix these problems. Through this machine, Bush hoped to transform an information explosion into a knowledge explosion.&lt;ref name="Wardrip"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.newmediareader.com/ | title=The New Media Reader | publisher=The MIT Press |author1=Wardrip-Fruin, Noah  |author2=Montfort, Nick | year=2003 | isbn=9780262232272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept creation==
The article was a reworked and expanded version of Bush's essay "Mechanization and the Record" (1939). Here, he described a machine that would combine lower level technologies to achieve a higher level of organized knowledge (like human [[memory]] processes). Shortly after the publication of this essay, Bush coined the term "[[memex]]" in a letter written to the editor of ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=From Memex to Hypertext - Vannevar Bush and the Mind's Machine | publisher=Academic Press |author1=Nyce, James M.  |author2=Kahn, Paul W. | year=1991 | isbn=9781493301713}}&lt;/ref&gt; That letter became the body of "As We May Think", which added only an introduction and conclusion. As described, Bush's memex was based on what was thought, at the time, to be advanced technology of the future: ultra high resolution [[microfilm]] reels, coupled to multiple screen viewers and cameras, by [[electromechanical]] controls. The memex, in essence, reflects a library of collective knowledge stored in a piece of machinery described in his essay as "a piece of furniture".&lt;ref name="Bush"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bush|first=Vannevar|authorlink=Vannevar Bush|date=July 1945|title=As We May Think|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/|journal=[[The Atlantic|The Atlantic Monthly]]|volume=176|issue=1|pages=101-108|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Atlantic'' publication of Bush's article was followed, in the September 10, 1945 issue of [[Life magazine|''Life'']] magazine, by a reprint that showed illustrations of the proposed memex desk and automatic typewriter. (Coincidentally, the same issue of ''Life'' contained aerial photos of Hiroshima after the dropping of the atomic bomb, a [[Manhattan Project|project]] Bush was instrumental in starting). Bush also discussed other technologies such as [[Dry-plate photography|dry photography]] and [[microphotography]] where he elaborates on the potentialities of their future use. For example, Bush states in his essay that: {{Quote | The combination of optical projection and photographic reduction is already producing some results in microfilm for scholarly purposes, and the potentialities are highly suggestive. |author=''Vannevar Bush''&lt;ref name="Bush" /&gt;}}

==Concept realization==
"As We May Think" predicted (to some extent) many kinds of technology invented after its publication, including [[hypertext]], [[personal computers]], the [[Internet]], the [[World Wide Web]], [[speech recognition]], and [[online encyclopedia]]s such as [[Wikipedia]]: "Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready-made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified."&lt;ref name="Bush" /&gt; Bush envisioned the ability to retrieve several articles or pictures on one screen, with the possibility of writing comments that could be stored and recalled together. He believed people would create links between related articles, thus mapping the thought process and path of each user and saving it for others to experience. Wikipedia is one example of how this vision has in part been realized, allowing elements of an article to reference other related topics. A user's browser history maps the trails of possible paths of interaction, although this is typically available only to the user that created it.
Bush's article also laid the foundation for new media. [[Doug Engelbart]] came across the essay shortly after its publication, and keeping the memex in mind, he began work that would eventually result in the invention of the [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]], the [[word processor]], the [[hyperlink]] and concepts of new media for which these groundbreaking inventions were merely enabling technologies.&lt;ref name="Wardrip" /&gt;

Today, storage has greatly surpassed the level imagined by Vannevar Bush, {{Quote | The ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' could be reduced to the volume of a matchbox. A library of a million volumes could be compressed into one end of a desk. | author=''Vannevar Bush''&lt;ref name="Bush" /&gt;}} On the other hand, it still uses methods of indexing of information which Bush described as artificial: {{Quote|When data of any sort are placed in storage, they are filed alphabetically or numerically, and information is found (when it is) by tracing it down from subclass to subclass. It can be in only one place, unless duplicates are used.|author=''Vannevar Bush''&lt;ref name="Bush" /&gt;}}This description resembles popular [[file systems]] of modern computer operating systems ([[File Allocation Table|FAT]], [[NTFS]], [[ext3]] when used without hard links and symlinks, etc.), which do not easily enable associative indexing as imagined by Bush.

==Outlook in the use of science==
Bush urges that scientists should turn to the massive task of creating more efficient accessibility to our fluctuating [[knowledge base|store of knowledge]]. For years inventions have extended people's physical powers rather than the powers of their mind. He argues that the instruments are at hand which, if properly developed, will give society access to and command over the inherited knowledge of the ages. The perfection of these pacific instruments, he suggests, should be the first objective of our scientists.&lt;ref name="Bush" /&gt;

Through this process, society would be able to focus and evolve past the existing knowledge rather than looping through infinite calculations. We should be able to pass the tedious [[number crunching|work of numbers]] to machines and work on the intricate theory which puts them best to use. If humanity were able to obtain the "privilege of forgetting the manifold things he does not need to have immediately at hand, with some assurance that he can find them again if proven important" only then "will mathematics be practically effective in bringing the [[Knowledge|growing knowledge]] of atomistic to the useful solution of the advanced problems of chemistry, metallurgy, and biology".&lt;ref name="Wardrip" /&gt; To exemplify the importance of this concept, consider the process involved in 'simple' shopping: "Every time a charge sale is made, there are a number of things to be done. The inventory needs to be revised, the salesman needs to be given credit for the sale, the general accounts need an entry, and most important, the customer needs to be charged."&lt;ref name="Wardrip" /&gt; Due to the convenience of the store's central device which rapidly manage thousands of these transactions, the employees may focus on the essential aspects of the department such as sales and advertising.

Indeed, as of today, "science has provided the swiftest [[telecommunication|communication]] between individuals; it has provided a record of ideas and has enabled man to manipulate and to make extracts from that record so that knowledge evolves and endures throughout the life of a race rather than of an individual".&lt;ref name="Wardrip" /&gt; Improved technology has become an extension of our capabilities, much as how external hard drives function for computers so it may reserve more memory for more practical tasks.

Another significant role of practicality in technology is the method of [[association (psychology)|association]] and selection. "There may be millions of fine thoughts, and the account of the experience on which they are based, all encased within stone walls of acceptable architectural form; but if the scholar can get at only one a week by diligent search, his synthesis are not likely to keep up with the current scene."&lt;ref name="Wardrip" /&gt; Bush believes that the tools available in his time lacked this feature, but noted the emergence and development of such ideas such as the Memex, a cross referencing system.

Bush concludes his essay by stating that: {{Quote | The applications of science have built man a well-supplied house, and are teaching him to live healthily therein. They have enabled him to throw masses of people against one another with cruel weapons. They may yet allow him truly to encompass the great record and to grow in the wisdom of race experience. He may perish in conflict before he learns to wield that record for his true good. Yet, in the application of science to the needs and desires of man, it would seem to be a singularly unfortunate stage at which to terminate the process, or to lose hope as to the outcome. | author=''Vannevar Bush''&lt;ref name="Bush" /&gt;}}

==Outline==
Many scientists, especially physicists, get new duties during the War. Now, after the war, they need new duties.

''Section 1:'' The use of Science has improved tremendously in many ways for humans. The knowledge of science has grown considerably. However, the way we manage it still remains the same for centuries. We are no longer able to use what Science finds out. Alternatively, the technology has matured greatly and allows us to now produce complicated, yet cheap and dependable machines.

''Section 2:'' Science is really useful. However, in order to have it to be very efficient and useful it should not only be stored but also be frequently consulted and enhanced. In the future we would probably be able to store human writings in a small room with the use of photography.

''Section 3:'' Using the latest advances of [[Sound recording and reproduction|speech recording]] and [[stenography]], we will soon be able to make printing immediate. The advancement of photography is not going to stop. The thought process of repetition could be in relation to machine. Electrical machines will be the advancement of [[arithmetic]]al computation.

''Section 4:'' There is more to the scientific reasoning than just arithmetic. There are a few machines that are not used for arithmetic, partly due to the market’s needs. Solving [[higher mathematics]] require other repetitive processes of thought to be mechanized.

''Section 5:'' A machine could be used anywhere where there is logical [[thought process]]. At this moment we do not have the necessary tools for the selection (the key to utilize science) of knowledge. One of the best forms of selection is illustrated by the automatic telephone exchange.

''Section 6:'' There is a problem with selection. The main problem of it is the deficiency of the [[Lookup table|indexing]] systems. When data is recorded and put into storage, it is usually [[collation|filed alphabetically or numerically]]. The human mind works differently. It works according to [[association (psychology)|association]]. Instead of using selection by indexing, selection by association may be mechanized. Thus, improving the permanence and clarity of the items stored. The memex is a device that could store information and communication (large memory). Some things that can be entered are, newspaper and books. The user is also able to find a particular book as he or she taps on its code on the keyboard. The codes that are frequently used to call forth pages are [[mnemonic]] and its possible to browse these pages at different speeds.

''Section 7:'' The main feature of the memex is the ability to tie two things together at will. In other words, to be able to associate two arbitrary items when wanted. The user is also able to build a trail, in which they name it, insert a name into the code book, and then taps it out on the keyboard. At any time, the user is able to view two items at the same time, parallel viewing. It is also possible to pass items to another memex.

''Section 8:'' The trails made can be shared with others and can also be published, like an [[encyclopedia]] (many more new forms are to appear). Soon we will be able to establish some kind of direct connection with absorbing material of the record with one of our senses, tactilely, orally, and visually. It would be great for humans to be able analyze present issues. As of now, science has been applied to live better, as well as for destruction. Possibly we may be able to apply the record to become wiser.

==Critical opinion==
"As We May Think" has turned out to be a visionary and influential essay. In their introduction to a paper discussing information literacy as a discipline, Johnston and Webber write {{Quote | Bush's paper might be regarded as describing a microcosm of the information society, with the boundaries tightly drawn by the interests and experiences of a major scientist of the time, rather than the more open knowledge spaces of the 21st century. Bush provides a core vision of the importance of information to industrial/scientific society, using the image of an "information explosion" arising from the unprecedented demands on scientific production and technological application of World War II. He outlines a version of information science as a key discipline within the practice of scientific and technical knowledge domains. His view encompasses the problems of information overload and the need to devise efficient mechanisms to control and channel information for use.|author=''Johnston and Webber''&lt;ref name="JoWe"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Johnston | first1 = | last2 = Webber | first2 = | year = 2006 | title = As We May Think: Information literacy as a discipline for the information age | url = | journal = Research Strategies | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 108–121 | doi = 10.1016/j.resstr.2006.06.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Indeed, Bush was very concerned with information overload inhibiting the research efforts of scientists. His scientist, operating under conditions of "information explosion" and requiring respite from the tide of scientific documents could be construed as a nascent image of the "Information Literate Person" in an information saturated society. {{Quote|text=There is a growing mountain of research. But there is increased evidence that we are being bogged down today as specialization extends. The investigator is staggered by the findings and conclusions of thousands of other workers.|author=''Vannevar Bush''&lt;ref name="Bush" /&gt;}}
{{Quote | Schools, colleges, health care, government, etc., are all implicated in the distribution and use of information, under similar conditions of "information explosion" as Bush's post-war scientists. All these people arguably need some sort of personal "information control" in order to function. |author=''Bill Johnston, Sheila Webber''&lt;ref name="JoWe" /&gt;}}

"'''Attack of the Killer App'''" is the third episode of the [[Futurama (season 6)|sixth season]]&lt;!-- Please do not change. Production order, not airing order, is used here. --&gt; of the American animated sitcom ''[[Futurama]]''. It originally aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on July 1, 2010. The episode focuses on the release of the new eyePhone, resulting in [[Philip J. Fry|Fry]] posting a [[viral video]] of [[Leela (Futurama)|Leela]] on the Internet. [[Craig Ferguson]], host of ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]'', guest stars as Leela's singing [[boil]], Susan.

==Plot==
The episode opens with the Planet Express crew recycling their old electronics. [[Hubert J. Farnsworth]] announces that they will be delivering all the Earth’s [[e-waste]] to the Third World of the [[Antares]] system. After dropping them off, they decide it would be better to keep using their old electronics. This changes when they see a commercial for MomCorp’s new [[iPhone|eyePhone]]. The crew all buy eyePhones, which feature a wide variety of applications, including the [[Twitter|Twitcher]] application. [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]] and [[Philip J. Fry|Fry]] get into a competition to get the most followers, wagering a dollar and stating that the loser must jump into a tub of two-headed alien goat vomit and diarrhea.

Meanwhile, [[Mom (Futurama)|Mom]] reveals to her sons that the eyePhones allow her to direct market to the users, based on what they post on Twitcher. She also reveals her evil plan wherein the “twit worm” will be transmitted as soon as someone has one million followers. The twit worm will work as a virus infecting the human brain and making people into mindless zombies that follow her every whim.

Fry decides he needs to have more interesting twits in order to beat Bender. He soon discovers that [[Leela (Futurama)|Leela]] has a boil, named Susan, which sings show tunes. Fry shares video of the boil on his eyePhone, in spite of his promise not to. The video is a hit and Leela is ridiculed wherever she goes. Fry and Bender both reach one million followers simultaneously and Mom transmits the twit worm to all of their followers, including [[Hermes Conrad]], [[Amy Wong]] and Pro. Farnsworth.

Leela discovers that her humiliation is old news and that a new video has everyone’s attention. She forgives Fry and he reveals to her that he posted a video of himself completing the loser’s side of the bet in order to make up for the humiliation he caused her. Meanwhile, Mom's virus activates turning Fry and Bender's followers to zombies who get in line to buy the eyePhone 2.0 while Mom looks on satisfied.

==Continuity==
Bender's good twin [[List of recurring characters in Futurama#Flexo|Flexo]] makes a brief cameo in one of the recycling bins.&lt;ref name="a.v.club"/&gt; The cell phone [[Amy (Futurama)|Amy]] throws away before getting an eyePhone is the same as in "[[Amazon Women in the Mood]]". The chairs at the pizza restaurant are the same ones the Cygnoids had in "[[A Leela of Her Own]]".

==Cultural references==
Most of the episode focuses on parodies of the [[iPhone]] and [[Twitter]], renamed the eyePhone and Twitcher respectively.&lt;ref name="ign"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/110/1103550p1.html |title=Futurama: "Attack of the Killer App" Review |author=Canning, Robert |date=July 2, 2010 |work=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2010-06-02 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100704042349/http://tv.ign.com/articles/110/1103550p1.html| archivedate= 4 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eyePhone is placed directly in the eye, hence the name ''eye''Phone.&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt; 
Fry asks, "Since when is the internet about robbing people of their privacy?", to which Bender replies, "August 6, 1991", which is the date that [[Tim Berners-Lee]] announced the [[World Wide Web]] project and software on the newsgroup alt.hypertext.&lt;ref name="a.v.club"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/attack-of-the-killer-app,42568/ |title=Futurama "Attack of the Killer App" |author=Handlen, Zack |date=July 1, 2010 |work=[[The A.V.

==Broadcast and reception==
In the original American broadcast, "Attack of the Killer App" was viewed by an estimated 2.159 million households receiving a 1.3 rating/2% share in the [[Nielsen ratings]] and 1.1 rating/4% share in the 18-49 demographic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/07/02/thursday-cable-ratings-usas-royal-pains-bethenny-lags-futurama/56051 |title=Thursday Cable Ratings: USA’s Royal Pains &amp; Burn Notice lead Thursday cable pack; Bethenny Lags Futurama |author=Seidman, Robert |date=July 2, 2010 |work=TVbythenumbers |accessdate=2010-07-04 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100704143202/http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/07/02/thursday-cable-ratings-usas-royal-pains-bethenny-lags-futurama/56051| archivedate= 4 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Canning of [[IGN]] in his review gave the episode an 8.5 calling it "Great" and also stated in his review ""Attack of the Killer App" had more than enough great laughs to outweigh this weak bit", in reference to the Susan Boyle joke. He also praised the references to iPhone and Twitter jokes.&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt; ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' reviewer Zack Helden gave the episode a B saying "This was funny, generally, and I'm glad the series hasn't lost its teeth. It's just, I miss the writers' habit of biting off just a little more than they could chew."&lt;ref name="a.v.club"/&gt; He also found the Susan Boyle jokes to be "mean-spirited" but clever and so "bizarre that it worked".&lt;ref name="a.v.club"/&gt; Darren Franich of [[Entertainment Weekly|EW]] Popwatch said the episode was "as good as anything the show produced in its prime" particularly commenting on the speed of the episode and the precision of its satire. He also noted that the episode benefited from good timing, coming right on the heels of recent iPad and iPhone releases which kept the episode from feeling "outdated".&lt;ref name="EW"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/07/02/futurama-has-returned-well-is-it-still-good/ |title='Futurama' has returned: Well, IS it still good? |first=Darren |last=Franich |date=July 2, 2010 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=July 2, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100705101625/http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/07/02/futurama-has-returned-well-is-it-still-good/| archivedate= 5 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sean Gandert of [[Paste (magazine)|Paste]] rated the episode a 7.1. While he found the eyePhone jokes to be clever he refers to the Boil plotline as "a horrifically stupid joke that dominates and largely ruins the second part of the episode".&lt;ref name="Paste"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2010/07/futurama-review-attack-of-the-killer-apps-63.html |title=Futurama Review: "Attack of the Killer Apps" (6.3) |author=Sean Gandert |date=July 2, 2010 |work= |publisher=Paste |accessdate=July 6, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100705102843/http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2010/07/futurama-review-attack-of-the-killer-apps-63.html| archivedate= 5 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2092">A '''Bettsometer''' is a [[fabric]] degradation [[Test method|tester]] commonly used to [[Measurement|measure]] or test the integrity of fabric coverings (and associated [[Stitch (textile arts)|stitching]]) on [[aircraft]] and their [[wing]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.airborne.com.au/images/aw_directives/SB-007%20Issue1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bettsometer comprises a [[pen]]-like instrument (which functions much like a [[spring balance]]) and a smooth round [[Sewing needle|needle]] or pin. The needle is inserted into the fabric and then the instrument is pulled to exert a specific [[force]] on the fabric in order to test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekmpowershop2.com/ekmps/shops/conairsports/bettsometer-betts-001-2-p.asp |title=Bettsometer BETTS-001 |publisher=Ekmpowershop2.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A visual inspection is made to check for any rips or tears at the needle insertion point.

The Bettsometer test is often a requirement for the annual '[[License|permit]]' renewal and is usually carried out by an aircraft [[inspector]] who will know the requirements of the test (i.e. the areas of sail and stitching to be tested and the force to be exerted).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1419/Bm08i04.pdf |title=Microlight Type Approval Data Sheets |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606161105/http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1419/Bm08i04.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmai.ie/doc/annualpermitrenewalflex.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721125521/http://www.nmai.ie/doc/annualpermitrenewalflex.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcw.gov.cy/mcw/DCA/DCA.nsf/All/1054B4CF316D1BF2C225736F00702A41/$file/3AXIS%20INSPECTION%20SCHEDULE.pdf |title=Department Of Civil Aviation |format=PDF |language=el |date= |accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Center for Hellenic Studies in Greece''' (CHS GR&lt;ref&gt;initials used, for example, on Center's Web site&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Harvard University|Harvard]] [[research Center]] based in [[Nafplio]], [[Greece]]. A twin institution to its counterpart [[Harvard University]]’s [[Center for Hellenic Studies]] in [[Washington, D.C.]],&lt;ref name="en.wikipedia.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/collection.php?cpk=1631|title=Center for Hellenic Studies {{!}} Harvard University Press|last=|first=|date=|website=www.hup.harvard.edu|language=en|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; CHS GR is housed in the Iatrou building, formerly home to the municipal town hall of Nafplio, at Philhellene and King Othon Street. A joint American and Greek Executive Board supervise the Center in Greece. The Director of the Center for Hellenic Studies in Greece is Professor Ioannis Petropoulos of the [[Democritus University of Thrace]].

== History ==
The Center for Hellenic Studies in Greece inaugurated in 2008 by way of a joint decision between the [[Provost (education)|Provost]] and the [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of the [[Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences]]. CHS GR utilizes the knowledge and expertise of [[Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences|Harvard]]'s faculty and [[Research Center|research centers]] and is a part of [[Harvard University|Harvard]]’s continuing effort to expand its international presence.&lt;ref name="summer.harvard.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldwide.harvard.edu/search/all|title=Harvard Worldwide|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=|deadurl=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center serves as a nexus for the network of international Centers operated by Harvard in [[Europe]] and around the globe, and it was organized and developed by being accessible, and free of charge, to the general public.

From a geographical standpoint Nafplio's role in the shaping of modern Greece and its enduring cultural significance make it an opportune setting for Harvard students as well as for visitors from Greece and across the globe. Nafplio neighbors with many archaeological sites in Greece such as [[Mycenae]], [[Mystras]], [[Epidaurus]], [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], [[Tiryns]], etc. Nafplio was the first capital of [[History of modern Greece|modern]] Greece after independence and a port during the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenean period]].

== Digital Library ==
The Center for Hellenic Studies’s facility in Nafplio has been equipped with a [[Digital library|Digital Library]] which provides access to [[Harvard Library]]'s electronic resources and a number of additional databases. Access is open to all researchers and visitors of the Center, regardless of affiliation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nafplio.gr/en/kentroellspoudonharvardmenu.html|title=The Center for Hellenic Studies (Greece), Harvard University|last=|first=|date=|website=www.nafplio.gr|language=en-gb|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs ==
The Center for Hellenic Studies provides training and professional development to students, visitors, and researchers in all fields of study through a wide variety of [[Educational program|programs]], which include internships, workshops and seminars, research initiatives, and study abroad:

*The CHS Cultural Internship Program in Greece&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; brings together a group of college students from different [[Academic institution|institutions]] throughout [[Greece]] and the [[United States]] for five weeks each summer in [[Nafplio]] to work and gain professional experience. Students develop their talents and skills while contributing to projects that directly support the goals and activities of the internship institutions, which are the Fougaro Cultural Complex, the Municipal Organization of Culture, Environment, Sports, and Tourism (DOPPAT), the [[Archaeological Museum of Nafplion|Nafplio Archaeological Museum]] and the [[National Gallery (Athens)|National Gallery, Nafplio Annex]].
*The five-week-long Comparative Cultural Studies Seminar&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.summer.harvard.edu/study-abroad/greece|title=Harvard Summer Program in Greece|last=|first=|date=|work=Harvard Summer School|access-date=|dead-url=|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (CCS) is the oldest [[Harvard University|Harvard]] study-abroad program of [[Harvard Summer School]]. Divided between [[Nafplio]] and [[Thessaloniki]], and led by Harvard Professor [[Gregory Nagy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://classics.fas.harvard.edu/people/gregory-nagy-0|title=Gregory Nagy|last=|first=|date=|website=classics.fas.harvard.edu|language=en|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a founding team of Harvard-trained Senior Fellows, the program seeks to promote cross-cultural understanding by combining historical, literary, philosophical, and linguistic approaches to [[cultural exchange]].
*The CHS GR High School Summer Program (HSSP) is a sixteen-day summer program addressed to high school students from the [[Argolis]]. The students attend an intensive daily seminar led by Harvard faculty, and [[Teaching fellow|Teaching Fellows]] studying at Harvard. The Harvard undergraduate students acting as the Teaching Fellows support the daily program by assembling course material as well as preparing every other activity related to the program. The program is directed by Dr. Nicolas Prevelakis, Lecturer in Harvard's Committee on Degrees in Social Studies and Assistant Director of Curricular Development at [[Center for Hellenic Studies|Center for Hellenic Studies in Washington D.C.]]
*CHS offers [[research]] opportunities to junior faculty members and individual researchers, aiming to build a network of fellows that will enhance learning and support the academic profile of Greece. The CHS-CCS Fellowships Program, addresses junior faculty—Adjunct Lecturers, Lecturers, Assistant Professors—of 100 Schools of [[Humanities]] and [[Social science|Social Sciences]] from [[List of universities in Greece|Greek Universities]]. The fellows participate in the CCS Program in Greece by presenting their research and interacting with colleagues and students from the U.S. and elsewhere. Their year-long appointment includes access to all Harvard electronic resources. CHS also offers in collaboration with the [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]], Faculty of Philosophy, School of Philology, Department of Classics, the CHS-AUTH joint research fellowships to young [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] holders from AUTH’s Department of Classics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.auth.gr/en/affilliations|title=Agreements of Scientific Cooperation {{!}} ARISTOTLE UNIVERSITY OF THESSALONIKI|last=|first=|date=|website=www.auth.gr|language=en|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fellowships include year-long access to Harvard University’s online databases and resources and to AUTH’s library system and also participation in a number of events and activities organized by both institutions.
*In cooperation with the Harvard Alumni Association, the Center for Hellenic Studies supports the organization of the “Greece Spring Break for Students and Alumni” Trip. Academic head of the program is Professor [[Gregory Nagy]]. Starting from [[Nafplio]] and [[Mycenae]] and proceeding through the [[Peloponnese]], [[Delphi]] and [[Athens]], the group supplements its explorations with selected readings in translation from [[Homer]], [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], and some modern texts. The group consists of students, alumni, and participants and alumni from the Harvard [[Massive open online course|MOOC]] The Ancient Greek Hero in 24 Hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edx.org/course/ancient-greek-hero-24-hours-harvardx-hum2x-2|title=The Ancient Greek Hero in 24 Hours|last=|first=|date=|work=edX|access-date=|dead-url=|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Deane Keller''' (December 14, 1901 &amp;ndash; April 12, 1992) was an [[United States|American]] [[artist]], [[academic]], [[soldier]], [[art restorer]] and [[preservationist]]. He taught for forty years at [[Yale University]]'s [[Yale School of Art|School of Fine Arts]] and during [[World War II]] was an officer with the [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program]].

==Biography==
Keller was born in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], [[Connecticut]] in 1901.&lt;ref name="nyt1992"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Deane Keller, Painter And Art Teacher, 91 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=4 April 1992 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/17/obituaries/deane-keller-painter-and-art-teacher-91.html  |accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, [[Albert Galloway Keller]], was a member of the junior faculty at Yale; but during young Deane's formative years, his father would become the first [[William Graham Sumner]] Professor of Sociology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Albert G.

As a student at Yale, he earned degrees in history and science in 1923.  Further studies led to a B.F.A. from the Yale School of Fine Arts in 1926.&lt;ref name="nyt1992"/&gt; Keller was awarded the [[Rome Prize|Gran Prix de Rome]] in 1926.&lt;ref name="nyt1926"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;  |title=Two Get Awards in Art Competition; Grand Prix de Rome Fellowships Go to Deane Keller and Joseph Kissilewski |newspaper=The New York Times |date=5 May 1926 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1926/05/05/archives/two-get-awards-in-art-competition-grand-prix-de-rome-fellowships-go.html |accessdate=28 January 2015 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a Fellow of  the [[American Academy in Rome]] (FAAR) for three years.&lt;ref name="nyt1992"/&gt; After returning from Rome in 1929, Keller began his career as a member of the Yale faculty.&lt;ref name="Yale_archive"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hdl.handle.net/10079/fa/mssa.ms.1685  |title=Deane Keller papers |website=Yale University Manuscripts and Archives |publisher=Yale University Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His academic career was interrupted by the Second World War, when he was asked by School of Fine Arts dean [[Theodore Sizer (art historian)|Theodore Sizer]] to serve as a fine arts officer in the U.S. Army's [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program]]. At war's end, he returned to teach at Yale's School of Fine Arts.&lt;ref name="Yale_archive"/&gt; In total, Keller taught at Yale for forty years, retiring in 1979, and was also professor emeritus of painting at the [[Paier College of Art]].&lt;ref name="Taft School" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Yale_archive"/&gt;

Keller married Katherine Parkhurst Hall in 1938. He had two sons, [[Deane G. Keller]], 1940 – 2005, and William Keller, born in 1950.&lt;ref name="Yale_archive"/&gt;

==World War II==
[[File:Deane Keller with Cosimo I de Medici statue.jpg|thumb|300px|Keller with the head of the Cosimo I de Medici statue, recovered in [[Poggio a Caiano]], Italy]]
From 1943 to 1946, Keller served as an officer of the U.S. 5th Army in the [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |title=Keller, Capt. Deane |publisher=Monuments Men Foundation |url=http://www.monumentsmenfoundation.org/monumentsmen/ |accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Captain Keller was primarily responsible for the identification and transportation of artworks in [[Tuscany, Italy]], the center of the [[Italian Renaissance]] and a major site of [[Nazi plunder|Nazi looting]].&lt;ref name="nyt1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roach"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Roach |first=Catherine |title=Collateral Damage |magazine=Yale Alumni Magazine |date=March 2003 |url=http://archives.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/03_03/keller.html |accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked in [[Pisa, Italy|Pisa]] and [[Florence, Italy|Florence]], where Nazi troops had bombed churches, destroyed or dislocated public art, and seized paintings from museums including the [[Uffizi]].&lt;ref name="Roach" /&gt; As they were discovered during the [[Allied invasion of Italy|invasion of Italy]], Keller repatriated lost works, including [[Giambologna]]'s statue of [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo I de Medici]], a fixture of  Florence's [[Piazza della Signoria]]. He also documented damage to buildings and murals across Tuscany, taking thousands of photographs with Charles Bernholz.&lt;ref name="Roach" /&gt;

One of Keller's most significant wartime undertakings was his attempt to preserve the murals of the [[Camposanto]], a medieval cemetery in Pisa. In July 1944, an American shelling started a fire that caused the frescoes to fracture.&lt;ref name="Taft School" /&gt; Keller organized art experts and enlisted men to protect the mural pieces and protect the cemetery from further damage.&lt;ref name="Taft School" /&gt; Restoration of the frescoes has continued for seventy years.  In recognition of his preservation efforts, an urn containing Keller's ashes was interred in the Camposanto in 2000.&lt;ref name="Taft School" /&gt;

==Honors==
* [[Rome Prize|Gran Prix de Rome]], 1926.&lt;ref name="nyt1926"/&gt;
* [[Legion of Merit]], 1946 (United States).
* [[British Empire Medal]], 1926 (United Kingdom).
* [[Crown of Italy Partisan Medal]], 1946 (Italy).
* [[Medal of the Opera]], Commune of Pisa
* [[Order of St John Lateran]], 1946. (Vatican).

Keller was posthumously recognized for his wartime activities. He was the first to enter Pisa liberated from Nazi, 02 Sept.1944, with the partisan Pierino Fornaciari, liaison officer, with whom he rescued many art works, in particular in the [[Camposanto Monumentale]]. His remains were apportioned and interred in New Britain, Connecticut and the [[Camposanto Monumentale]] in [[Pisa]]; that site is identified with an engraved marble slab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media| author-last1=Berge |author-first1=Robert |author-last2=Cohen |author-first2=Bonni |author-last3=Newnham |author-first3=Nicole |title=The Rape of Europa |date=2006 |medium=film |publisher=Oregon Public Broadcasting |url=https://www.pbs.org/therapeofeuropa/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gallery==
In addition to his academic career, Keller was a prolific portrait painter. He was known as the "unofficial portraitist of the Yale faculty," completing over 160 portrait commissions for the university, including faculty, corporation board members, and two presidents. With one of his portrait subjects, [[Thomas G. Bergin]], Keller worked in collaboration by illustrating the book, ''On Sepulchers''.&lt;ref&gt;Foscolo, Ugo. Bergin, Thomas G., translator.

'''Schluckbildchen'''; from [[Germany|German]], which means literally "swallowable pictures", are small notes of paper that have a [[sacred]] image on them with the purpose of being swallowed. They were used as a religious practice in the [[traditional medicine|folk medicine]] throughout the eighteenth to twentieth century, and were believed to possess curative powers. Frequently found in the "spiritual [[medicine chest|medicine chests"]] of devout believers at that time, by swallowing them they wished to gain these curative powers. They are to be distinguished from ''Esszettel''; from [[Germany|German]], meaning "edible notes of paper", the latter only having text written on them.

==Variations==

===''Esszettel''===
''Esszettel'' had either [[adage]]s, names of [[saint]]s, [[prayer]]s or [[bible]] verses written on them, usually in the shortened form of [[sigil (magic)|sigils]]. Occasionally, red paper was used. In [[Holstein]], for example, feverish people were given slips saying ''„Fieber bleib aus / [[Nomen nescio|N.N.]] ist nicht zu Haus“'' (fever stay away, N.N. is not at home). In Protestant regions like [[Württemberg]], [[East Frisia]], [[Oldenburg]] or [[Hamburg]], people symbolically consumed their own illness by eating a paper note that had their name, date of birth or some kind of phrase written on it. The slip was then stuck into a piece of bread or fruit, and the sick person ate it.&lt;ref name="richter-43"&gt;Richter, Sp. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

Handwritten or printed ''Esszettel''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rheintaler.ch/lokales/rheintal/rt-or/Hilfreiche-Fresszettel-im-Ortsmuseum;art164,1271328 „Fresszettel“ im Ortsmuseum Rüthi-Büchel, St. Gallen, Schweiz]&lt;/ref&gt; were even used to cure animals, from  illnesses like rage disease or numbness (also called ''Fresszettel''). The [[Sator square]] was thought to help against [[Rabies]]. In the [[Upper Bavaria]]n region of ''Isarwinkel'' farmers treated their livestock with ''Esszettel'' to cure [[anthrax]].

Unfortunately, there are not many remains of such ''Esszettel'' today, one of the reasons lying in the fact that the church institutions had mostly seen ''Esszettel'' as pure [[superstition]]. Hints as to how they looked like can be found in literature, where triangle shaped ''Esszettel'' are mentioned, those not only with the purpose of being swallowed, though. The triangle shaped ''Esszettel'' had words or phrases printed on them that were repeated over and over, losing one or two letters with each repetition. That way, the sick person wished to overcome the illness bit by bit.&lt;ref name="richter-43" /&gt;

''Esszettel'' that have survived to the present day are usually remains of mass-produced stock which were sold on [[pilgrimage]] markets. These types of ''Esszettel'' were printed on stamp-like sheets of paper. They were either labeled identically or varied in a certain pattern. The latter version was called ''Lukaszettel'', and one of the printing plates used to print ''Lukaszettel'' has been preserved. Sometimes, ''Esszettel'' were printed on both sides, the back page complementing the front page. These are considered to be the oldest types of ''Esszettel''.

===''Schluckbildchen''===

''Schluckbildchen'' had a square, rectangular or round shape and a feed size of 5 to 20&amp;nbsp;mm. So they were the smallest form of devotional art design. Small pictures of the 19th century were partly bigger, like the version that was produced in [[Einsiedeln]] (32x22 mm). 
Also ''Schluckbildchen'' were produced on light sheets of paper; one sheet could hold 130 pieces. Both possible were series of one theme as well as different themes which would always have the same style.
''Schluckbildchen'' can be detected after the [[middle age]].&lt;ref&gt;Adolph Franz: ''Die kirchlichen Benediktionen im Mittelalter.'' Bd. 2, S. 454, Anm. 2. Freiburg/Br. 1909. Zitiert in Christoph Kürzeder: ''Als die Dinge heilig waren. Gelebte Frömmigkeit im Zeitalter des Barock.'' S. 130. Schnell &amp; Steiner, Regensburg 2005, {{ISBN|3-7954-1769-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to the 19th century [[copper engraving printings]] were most likely, including some notes (for example in [[Mariazell]]) which were produced with a [[woodcarving technique]]. Later, [[colour printing]] was used; in the 20th century also [[photomechanical]] reproduction of old artworks.

''Schluckbildchen'' often show the [[Virgin Mary]] as a [[picture of mercy]] in a specific [[pilgrimage location]], sometimes other saints or portrayals from Christian iconography, like the [[Nomen sacrum]] or [[Titulus INRI]]. Usually, under the theme an inscription is placed naming the location of pilgrimage or the saint that is portrayed. Frequently, someone made the effort also to put on details of the devotional art design. The symmetry of the rectangular, triangular, diamond-shaped, round or elliptical-shaped frame elements concentrated the effect of the picture on the central theme. Also effects like rays of light as well as the floating on clouds put emphasise on the [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] character of the picture.&lt;ref&gt;Schneegass, S. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

==Producer and sales==

''Esszettel'' were sold not only by merchants in pilgrimage locations, but also by [[charlatan]]s. It is passed on that a charlatan was travelling through Saxony in 1898, who gave ''Sympathiezettelchen'' (litaeral translation: sympathy notes) that were written in unreadable words, for an optional prize from 0.30 up to one Deutsche Mark to ill people to eat. ''Esszettel'' were also prescribed by a Saxon quack in 1913, known under the name “the Reinsdorf miner”.

In former times, ''Schluckbildchen'' were sold in all pilgrimage locations. Producers were (among others):
*F. Gutwein, Augsburg
*[[Johann Michael Söckler|J. M. Söckler]], Munich
*F. Pischel, Linz
*Jos. Nowohradsky, Graz
*Frères [[Benziger]], Einsiedeln.

''Brandzettel'' (literal translation: notes of fire), which were used for the recovery of animals, were available at [[Franciscan]] in [[Tölz]]. ''Schluckbildchen'' were from time to time a flourishing business of some monasteries.&lt;ref&gt;Margarete Ruff: ''Zauberpraktiken als Lebenshilfe: Magie im Alltag vom Mittelalter bis heute,'' S. 154. Campus, Frankfurt/Main 2003, {{ISBN|3-593-37380-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the seventies in the 19th century, “Schluckbildchen” were still sold in Mariazell, [[Naples]], and [[Sata Maria del Carmine]] in [[Florence]]. ''Schluckbildchen'' of [[Our Dear Virgin of Everlasting Aid]] were sold from Rome to the whole world.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, Sp. 44&lt;/ref&gt;  Ethnologist Dominik Wunderlin, department manager at the [[Museum der Kulturen Basel]], reported in 2005 that a woman`s monastery in Bavaria, which was not named in that connection, was still giving away ''Schluckbildchen'' at the entrance gate.&lt;ref&gt;Dominik Wunderlin: [http://www.hauszumdolder.ch/referat_d_wunderlin/ Volksfrömmigkeit in der Vergangenheit. Exemplarisch dargestellt an Objekten der Sammlung Dr. Edmund Müller]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
As the terms ''Schluckbildchen'' and ''Esszettel'' suggest, their main medical purpose was of spiritual nature, also called “gratia medicinalis” during the [[Baroque]] period.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Brückner: ''Eßzettel.'' In ''Lexikon für Theologie und Kirche.'' Bd.&amp;nbsp;3, Sp.&amp;nbsp;894. Herder, Freiburg 1993, {{ISBN|3-451-22003-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''paper pills'' were either soaked in water, dissolved or added to dishes, in order to then be swallowed by the sick person. The ingestion of little pictures can be seen as a primitive and unmediated form of taking possession of the embodiment of the saint's curative power (or whoever was depicted). Both the ritual effort that was made to grasp the true meaning of the cult image, but also the memory of the pilgrimage adventure the sick person associated with the ''Schluckbildchen'', increased the miraculous effect. That held true despite the fact that many ''Schluckbildchen'' were hard to decipher and written in poor Latin. What remains unclear until today is the question, whether or not the consumption of ''Schluckbildchen'' was in any way connected to the practices of the [[Eucharist]] or the [[Sacramental bread]].

In rarer cases, ''Schluckbildchen'' were used as letters of protection or as religious [[amulet]]s common at that time (e.g. [[Wettersegen]] or [[Breverl]]). Furthermore, they were used as decorations for gingerbread and other pastries.

If nothing else was at hand, even holy images used in [[Anglican devotions|devotions]] were swallowed; either as a whole or torn apart and soaked in water. Lastly, it was quite common to eat images taken from [[calendar of saints|Calendars of saints]].

''Schluckbildchen'' were used in either practices of [[organized religion]] and [[folk religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Lenz Kriss-Rettenbeck: ''Bilder und Zeichen religiösen Volksglaubens.'' S. 45. [[Callwey Verlag]], München 1963&lt;/ref&gt; On August 3, 1903, the Roman [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] announced that as long as there were no superstitious practices involved, the use of ''Esszettel'' was officially granted.&lt;ref&gt;Philipp Schmidt: ''Frömmigkeit auf Abwegen'' (=Morus-Kleinschriften, Nr. 32), S. 7. Morus-Verlag, Berlin 1955. Zitiert bei Richter, Sp. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Eduard Stemplinger]] on the other hand, on July 29 the same congregation had already decided that swallowing water-soaked paper notes with Madonna images printed on them in order to heal illnesses certainly did not count as  superstition.&lt;ref name="stemplinger"&gt;Eduard Stemplinger: ''Antike und moderne Volksmedizin'' (= Das Erbe der Alten 2; 10), S. 65. Dieterich, Leipzig 1925.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resembling objects==

''Esszettel'' were known as ''Fieberzettel'' (literal translation: fever notes) already in [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]]. In Carolingian [[Indiculus superstitionum]], there was talk about a consumption of an image of deity which was baked in bread. In late Roman medicine the ash of burnt papyrus sheets („charta combusta“) was used as an ingredient for ointment and for orally and rectally applied medicine. Those notes were supposed to have a healing effect both labelled and unlabelled.

Resembling qualities to the ''Esszettel'' also has “fever altar bread” which was given away by the [[minorities]] in the end of the 18th century. [[Wafe]] was also used as healing medicine in the turn of the 15th century as it was described in the poem ''Bluemen der tugent'' by the Tyrolese Hans Vintler: ''„Vil di wellen auf oblat schreiben / und das Fieber damit vertreiben“.''

Further examples are the [[grated clay Madonna]] , which were common up to the 20th century, and from which you grated the surface to eat. For the same purpose water was used, with which relics and resembling objects were cleaned.&lt;ref name="stemplinger" /&gt; Also the “protecting notes”, which were known in the [[Thirty Years` War]] as [[art from Passau]], were also swallowed while facilitating ritual rules.

[[A printing plate]], which was found in the second decade of the 19th century in Eastern [[Mongolia]], proves that also in that culture “eating notes” were used.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walther Heissig]]: ''Heilung durch Zettelschlucken.'' In Walther Heissig, Claudius C. Müller (Hrsg.): ''Die Mongolen.'' Bd.&amp;nbsp;2. Pinguin-Verlag, Innsbruck 1989, {{ISBN|3-7016-2297-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In small squares from approx. 34x29 mm the printing plate contains several Tibetan spells that enclose also the connected purpose. Apparently, it originated from Tibetan [[Lamaistic]] folk medicine and was probably used by a Lamaistic migrant medical practitioner. Depending on the indication those notes had several instructions for use, e.g. “Eat when having flu” or “Eat nine when having stomach ache”.

From [[Uganda]] it is known that in the end of the 1990s followers of a famous Christian [[charismatic]] preacher and magic healer soaked his photographs in water and drank from it in order to swallow up parts of his healing power.&lt;ref&gt;Heike Behrend: ''Photo Magic: Photographs in Practices of Healing and Harming in East Africa.''

'''Differential scanning calorimetry''', or '''DSC''', is a [[thermal analysis|thermoanalytical]] technique in which the difference in the amount of [[heat]] required to increase the [[temperature]] of a sample and reference is measured as a function of temperature. Both the sample and reference are maintained at nearly the same temperature throughout the experiment. Generally, the temperature program for a DSC analysis is designed such that the sample holder temperature increases linearly as a function of time. The reference sample should have a well-defined [[heat capacity]] over the range of temperatures to be scanned.

The technique was developed by E. S. Watson and M. J. O'Neill in 1962,&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|3263484}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and introduced commercially at the 1963 [[Pittsburgh Conference on Analytical Chemistry and Applied Spectroscopy]]. The first [[adiabatic]] differential scanning calorimeter that could be used in biochemistry was developed by P. L. Privalov and D. R. Monaselidze in 1964 at Institute of Physics in Tbilisi, Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=1975|title=Molecular biology|volume=6|place=Moscow |pages=7–33 |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term DSC was coined to describe this instrument, which measures energy directly and allows precise measurements of heat capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = Wunderlich B |year=1990|title=Thermal Analysis|place=New York|publisher=Academic Press|pages=137–140|isbn=0-12-765605-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Types of DSC:
* ''Power-compensated DSC'', keeps power supply constant
* ''Heat-flux DSC'', keeps heat flux constant

==Detection of phase transitions==
The basic principle underlying this technique is that when the sample undergoes a physical transformation such as [[phase transition]]s, more or less heat will need to flow to it than the reference to maintain both at the same temperature. Whether less or more heat must flow to the sample depends on whether the process is [[exothermic reaction|exothermic]] or [[endothermic reaction|endothermic]]. For example, as a solid sample [[melting|melts]] to a liquid, it will require more heat flowing to the sample to increase its temperature at the same rate as the reference. This is due to the absorption of heat by the sample as it undergoes the endothermic [[phase transition]] from solid to liquid. Likewise, as the sample undergoes exothermic processes (such as [[crystallization]]) less heat is required to raise the sample temperature. By observing the difference in heat flow between the sample and reference, differential scanning [[calorimeter]]s are able to measure the amount of heat absorbed or released during such transitions. DSC may also be used to observe more subtle physical changes, such as [[glass transition]]s. It is widely used in industrial settings as a quality control instrument due to its applicability in evaluating sample purity and for studying polymer curing.&lt;ref name=Dean&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = Dean JA |title=The Analytical Chemistry Handbook|place=New York|publisher=McGraw Hill, Inc.|year=1995|pages=15.1–15.5|isbn=0-07-016197-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pugnor&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = Pungor E |title=A Practical Guide to Instrumental Analysis|publisher=Boca Raton|place=Florida|year=1995|pages=181–191}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Skoog&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = Skoog DA, Holler FJ, Nieman T |title=Principles of Instrumental Analysis |edition=5th |place=New York |year=1998 |pages=805–808 |isbn=0-03-002078-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==DTA==
An alternative technique, which shares much in common with DSC, is [[differential thermal analysis]] (DTA). In this technique it is the heat flow to the sample and reference that remains the same rather than the temperature. When the sample and reference are heated identically, phase changes and other thermal processes cause a difference in temperature between the sample and reference. Both DSC and DTA provide similar information. DSC measures the energy required to keep both the reference and the sample at the same temperature whereas DTA measures the difference in temperature between the sample and the reference when the same amount of energy has been introduced into both.

==DSC curves==
[[Image:CalibratingDSCcurve.png|frame|Top: A schematic DSC curve of amount of energy input (y) required to maintain each temperature (x), scanned across a range of temperatures. Bottom: Normalized curves setting the initial heat capacity as the reference. Buffer-buffer baseline (dashed) and protein-buffer variance (solid).]]
[[Image:2and3stDSCcurves.png|frame|Normalized DSC curves using the baseline as the reference (left), and fractions of each conformational state (y) existing at each temperature (right), for two-state (top), and three-state (bottom) proteins. Note the minuscule broadening in the peak of the three-state protein's DSC curve, which may or may not appear statistically significant to the naked eye.]]

The result of a DSC experiment is a curve of heat flux versus temperature or versus time. There are two different conventions: exothermic reactions in the sample shown with a positive or negative peak, depending on the kind of technology used in the experiment. This curve can be used to calculate [[enthalpy|enthalpies of transitions]]. This is done by integrating the peak corresponding to a given transition. It can be shown that the enthalpy of transition can be expressed using the following equation:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta H = K A&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta H&lt;/math&gt; is the enthalpy of transition, &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is the calorimetric constant, and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the area under the curve. The calorimetric constant will vary from instrument to instrument, and can be determined by analyzing a well-characterized sample with known enthalpies of transition.&lt;ref name=Pugnor/&gt;

==Applications==
Differential scanning calorimetry can be used to measure a number of characteristic properties of a sample. Using this technique it is possible to observe [[melting point|fusion]] and [[crystal]]lization events as well as [[glass transition]] temperatures ''T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;''. DSC can also be used to study [[oxidation]], as well as other chemical reactions.&lt;ref name=Dean/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pugnor/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = O'Neill MJ | title=The Analysis of a Temperature-Controlled Scanning Calorimeter|journal=Anal. Chem.|year=1964|volume=36|pages=1238–1245|doi=10.1021/ac60213a020|issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Glass transition]]s may occur as the temperature of an [[amorphous]] solid is increased. These transitions appear as a step in the baseline of the recorded DSC signal. This is due to the sample undergoing a [[Kauzmann paradox|change in heat capacity]]; no formal phase change occurs.&lt;ref name=Dean/&gt;&lt;ref name=Skoog/&gt;

As the temperature increases, an amorphous solid will become less [[viscosity|viscous]]. At some point the molecules may obtain enough freedom of motion to spontaneously arrange themselves into a crystalline form. This is known as the [[crystallization|crystallization temperature]] (''T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''). This transition from amorphous solid to crystalline solid is an exothermic process, and results in a peak in the DSC signal. As the temperature increases the sample eventually reaches its melting temperature (''T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''). The melting process results in an endothermic peak in the DSC curve. The ability to determine [[transition temperature]]s and [[enthalpy|enthalpies]] makes DSC a valuable tool in producing [[phase diagram]]s for various chemical systems.&lt;ref name=Dean/&gt;

Differential scanning calorimetry can also be used  to obtain valuable thermodynamics information about proteins. The thermodynamics analysis of proteins can reveal important information about the global structure of proteins, and protein/ligand interaction. For example, many mutations lower the stability of proteins, while ligand binding usually increases protein stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schön A, Brown RK, Hutchins BM, Freire E | title = Ligand binding analysis and screening by chemical denaturation shift | journal = Analytical Biochemistry | volume = 443 | issue = 1 | pages = 52–7 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 23994566 | pmc = 3809086 | doi = 10.1016/j.ab.2013.08.015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using DSC, this stability can be measured by obtaining [[Gibbs free energy|Gibbs Free Energy]] values at any given temperature. This allows researchers to compare the free energy of unfolding between ligand-free protein and protein-ligand complex, or wild type and mutant proteins. DSC can also be used in studying protein/lipid interactions, nucleotides, drug-lipid interactions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chiu MH, Prenner EJ | title = Differential scanning calorimetry: An invaluable tool for a detailed thermodynamic characterization of macromolecules and their interactions | journal = Journal of Pharmacy &amp; Bioallied Sciences | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 39–59 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 21430954 | pmc = 3053520 | doi = 10.4103/0975-7406.76463 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In studying protein denaturation using DSC, the thermal melt should be at least to some degree reversible, as the thermodynamics calculations rely on chemical equlibreum.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Examples==
The technique is widely used across a range of applications, both as a routine quality test and as a research tool. The equipment is easy to calibrate, using low melting [[indium]] at 156.5985 °C for example, and is a rapid and reliable method of thermal analysis.

===Polymers===
DSC is used widely for examining [[polymer]]ic materials to determine their thermal transitions.  The observed thermal transitions can be utilized to compare materials, although the transitions do not uniquely identify composition. The composition of unknown materials may be completed using complementary techniques such as IR spectroscopy.  [[Melting point]]s and [[glass transition temperature]]s for most [[polymer]]s are available from standard compilations, and the method can show [[polymer degradation]] by the lowering of the expected melting point, ''T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'', for example. ''T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' depends on the [[molecular weight]] of the polymer and thermal history, so lower grades may have lower melting points than expected. The percent crystalline content of a polymer can be estimated from the crystallization/melting peaks of the DSC graph as reference heats of fusion can be found in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | vauthors = Wunderlich B | title = Macromolecular Physics | year = 1980 | volume =  3 | chapter = Chapter 8, Table VIII.6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DSC can also be used to study thermal degradation of polymers using an approach such as Oxidative Onset Temperature/Time (OOT), however, the user risks contamination of the DSC cell, which can be problematic.  [[Thermogravimetric Analysis]] (TGA) may be more useful for decomposition behavior determination.  Impurities in polymers can be determined by examining thermograms for anomalous peaks, and [[plasticiser]]s can be detected at their characteristic boiling points.  In addition, examination of minor events in first heat thermal analysis data can be useful as these apparently "anomalous peaks" can in fact also be representative of process or storage thermal history of the material or polymer physical aging. Comparison of first and second heat data collected at consistent heating rates can allow the analyst to learn about both polymer processing history and material properties.

===Liquid crystals===
DSC is used in the study of [[liquid crystal]]s. As some forms of matter go from solid to liquid they go through a third state, which displays properties of both phases. This [[anisotropic]] liquid is known as a liquid crystalline or mesomorphous state. Using DSC, it is possible to observe the small energy changes that occur as matter transitions from a solid to a liquid crystal and from a liquid crystal to an [[isotropic]] liquid.&lt;ref name=Pugnor/&gt;

===Oxidative stability===
Using differential scanning calorimetry to study the stability to [[oxidation]] of samples generally requires an airtight sample chamber. Usually, such tests are done isothermally (at constant temperature) by changing the atmosphere of the sample. First, the sample is brought to the desired test temperature under an inert atmosphere, usually [[nitrogen]]. Then, oxygen is added to the system. Any oxidation that occurs is observed as a deviation in the baseline. Such analysis can be used to determine the stability and optimum storage conditions for a material or compound.&lt;ref name=Dean/&gt;

===Safety screening===
DSC makes a reasonable initial safety screening tool. In this mode the sample will be housed in a non-reactive crucible (often [[gold]] or gold-plated steel), and which will be able to withstand [[pressure]] (typically up to 100 [[bar (unit)|bar]]). The presence of an [[exothermic]] event can then be used to assess the [[chemical stability|stability]] of a substance to heat. However, due to a combination of relatively poor sensitivity, slower than normal scan rates (typically 2–3 °C/min, due to much heavier crucible) and unknown [[activation energy]], it is necessary to deduct about 75–100 °C from the initial start of the observed exotherm to ''suggest'' a maximal temperature for the material. A much more accurate data set can be obtained from an [[Calorimeter#Adiabatic calorimeters|adiabatic calorimeter]], but such a test may take 2–3 days from [[Ambient temperature|ambient]] at a rate of a 3 °C increment per half-hour.

===Drug analysis===
DSC is widely used in the [[pharmaceutical]] and [[polymer]] industries. For the polymer chemist, DSC is a handy tool for studying [[curing (chemistry)|curing]] processes, which allows the fine tuning of polymer properties. The [[cross-link]]ing of polymer molecules that occurs in the curing process is exothermic, resulting in a negative peak in the DSC curve that usually appears soon after the glass transition.&lt;ref name=Dean/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pugnor/&gt;&lt;ref name=Skoog/&gt;

In the pharmaceutical industry it is necessary to have well-characterized [[Medication|drug]] compounds in order to define processing parameters. For instance, if it is necessary to deliver a drug in the amorphous form, it is desirable to process the drug at temperatures below those at which crystallization can occur.&lt;ref name=Pugnor/&gt;

===General chemical analysis===
[[Freezing-point depression]] can be used as a '''purity analysis''' tool when analysed by differential scanning calorimetry. This is possible because the temperature range over which a mixture of compounds melts is dependent on their relative amounts. Consequently, less pure compounds will exhibit a broadened melting peak that begins at lower temperature than a pure compound.&lt;ref name=Pugnor/&gt;&lt;ref name=Skoog/&gt;

== History ==
The first Django Girls workshop, which kicked off Django Girls, happened during EuroPython 2014, in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=2015 Team|first1=EuroPython|title=Our next keynote: Ola &amp;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16465">'''Dream world''' (also called '''dream realm''' or '''illusory realm''') is a commonly used [[plot device]] in [[fiction]]al works, most notably in [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy fiction]]. The use of a dream world creates a situation whereby a [[fictional character|character]] (or group of characters) is placed in a marvellous and unpredictable environment and must overcome several personal problems to leave it. The dream world also commonly serves to teach some [[moral]] or [[religious]] lessons to the character experiencing it – a lesson that the other characters will be unaware of, but one that will influence decisions made regarding them. When the character is reintroduced into the real world (usually when they wake up), the question arises as to what exactly constitutes [[reality]] due to the vivid recollection and experiences of the dream world.

According to [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], dream worlds contrast with [[fantasy world]]s, in which the world has existence independent of the characters in it.&lt;ref&gt;J.R.R. Tolkien, "On Fairy-Stories", p. 14, ''The Tolkien Reader'', [[Ballantine Books]], New York 1966&lt;/ref&gt; However, other authors have used the dreaming process as a way of accessing a world which, within the context of the fiction, holds as much consistency and continuity as physical reality.&lt;ref&gt;"Whilst the greater number of our nocturnal visions are perhaps no more than faint and fantastic reflections of our waking experiences...&lt;br&gt;
... Sometimes I believe that this less material life is our truer life, and that our vain presence on the terraqueous globe is itself the secondary or merely virtual phenomenon."
– H.P. Lovecraft, from "Beyond the Wall of Sleep", as reprinted in ''The Dream Cycle of H. P. Lovecraft: Dreams of Terror and Death'' (Del Rey, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; The use of "dream frames" to contain a fantasy world, and so explain away its marvels, has been criticized and has become much less prevalent.&lt;ref name="encyc"&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Dreams", p. 297 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional dream worlds==
{{Pop culture|date=February 2018}}
===Literature===
A similar motif, [[Locus amoenus]], is popular in medieval literature (esp. allegory and romance). A dream world is sometimes invoked in [[dream vision]]s such as ''[[The Book of the Duchess]]'' and ''[[Piers Plowman]]''.&lt;ref name="encyc"/&gt;

[[File:Alice par John Tenniel 24.png|right|225px|thumb|The Cheshire Cat vanishes in Wonderland.]]
One of the best-known dream worlds is [[Wonderland (fictional country)|Wonderland]] from [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', as well as [[Looking-Glass Land]] from its sequel, ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''. Unlike many dream worlds, Carroll's logic is like that of actual dreams, with transitions and causality flexible. [[James Branch Cabell]]'s ''[[Smirt]]'' and its two sequels taken together form an extended dream and most of their action takes place in a dream world.

The action of ''[[The Bridge (novel)|The Bridge]]'' by [[Iain M. Banks]] and ''[[The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, the Unbeliever]]'' by [[Stephen R. Donaldson]] take place in dream worlds. Other fictional dream worlds include the [[Dreamlands]] of [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s ''[[Dream Cycle]]''  and ''[[The Neverending Story]]''{{'}}s world of Fantasia, which includes places like the Desert of Lost Dreams, the Sea of Possibilities and the Swamps of Sadness. Dreamworlds, shared hallucinations and other alternate realities feature in a number of works by [[Philip K. Dick]], such as ''[[The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch]]'' and ''[[Ubik]]''. Similar themes were explored by  [[Jorge Luis Borges]], for instance in ''[[The Circular Ruins]]''.

In ''[[The Wheel of Time]]'' book series, [[Tel'aran'rhiod]] is a dream world that exists in close proximity to the real world. Objects and physical locations that do not frequently change in the real world have parallels in [[Tel'aran'rhiod]]. Ordinary people can occasionally slip into [[Tel'aran'rhiod]], and events that occur within this dream world have physical consequences. A person that dies in [[Tel'aran'rhiod]] will never wake up again, and in several cases it is shown that physical injuries gained there persist to the waking world. [[Tel'aran'rhiod]] can be controlled similar to a [[lucid dream]], and several characters in the series can enter and manipulate [[Tel'aran'rhiod]] at will.

''[[Paprika (novel)|Paprika]]'' (1993) by [[Yasutaka Tsutsui]] is a [[science fiction]] novel that involves entering dream worlds using technology. In the book, dream monitoring and intervention as a means of treating [[mental disorder]]s is a developing new form of [[psychotherapy]] in the near future. Unrest ensues when a new psychotherapy dream-analysis device is stolen, allowing the assailant to enter and manipulate people's dreams.

In the feminist science fiction novel ''[[The Kin of Ata Are Waiting for You]]'', the Kin of Ata maintain the real world through their dreaming, making the real world a form of  dream.

===Film===
In the [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|1939 movie]], [[Land of Oz|Oz]] from ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' was altered from a fantasy world (in the novel) to a dream world of Dorothy's; characters who were independent inhabitants of Oz were transformed into dream parallels of introduced Kansas characters.&lt;ref&gt;L. Frank Baum, Michael Patrick Hearn, ''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', p. 96, {{ISBN|0-517-50086-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Matrix]]'', Neo and the rest of the humans live inside a dream world. Their brains are hooked up to a computer network that creates this dream world. However, some may argue that this is not a dream world, as it seems completely normal and indistinguishable from reality (aside from time differences). In the 1980s, the [[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|''Nightmare on Elm Street'' series]] of horror films introduced a dark dream realm inhabited by the supernatural serial killer [[Freddy Krueger]].

In the movie ''[[Sharkboy and Lavagirl]]'' the main characters enter a world dreamt up by a small boy in order to save the real world.
Down Town is the land of nightmares where all people who are in comas go in the movie ''[[Monkeybone]]''. Dreamworlds also appear in ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'' and ''[[Vanilla Sky]]''.

''[[Paprika (2006 film)|Paprika]]'' (2006) is an [[anime]] film adaptation of the 1993 novel of the same name, which involves entering and manipulating dream worlds using dream-analysis devices.

The film ''[[Waking Life]]'' takes place almost entirely in a dream realm.  In the 2010 film ''[[Inception]]'', main characters create artificial, vivid dream worlds and bring others into the dream worlds and perform various things with their brains, without them knowing. This may involve 'Extraction' (stealing memories and secrets), 'Inception' (planting an idea into the mind) and others.

===Comic books, graphic novels and animation===
[[File:Little Nemo 1906-07-22 last two panels.jpg|thumb|A panel from [[Little Nemo]] (1906).]]
One of the earliest newspaper comic strips, recounting [[Little Nemo]]'s adventures in [[Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland|Slumberland]], had a dream world theme.

Writer [[Neil Gaiman]] was tasked with re-imagining a Golden Age character, "[[Sandman (DC Comics)|The Sandman]]".  In his version, the Sandman becomes [[Dream (comics)|Dream]], the Lord of Dreams (also known, to various characters throughout the series, as [[Dream (comics)|Morpheus]], [[Oneiroi|Oneiros]], the Shaper, the Shaper of Form, Lord of the Dreaming, the Dream King, Dream-Sneak, Dream Cat, Murphy, Kai'ckul, and Lord L'Zoril), who is essentially the [[anthropomorphic]] personification of [[dream]]s. At the start of the series, Morpheus is captured by an occult ritual and held prisoner for 70 years. Morpheus escapes in the modern day and, after avenging himself upon his captors, sets about rebuilding his kingdom, which has fallen into disrepair in his absence.

Dream worlds also  appear in ''[[Rozen Maiden]]'', in the Outback(s) of ''[[The Maxx]]''; in Dream Land, the main setting of many [[Kirby series|''Kirby'' games]], in the webcomic ''[[The Dreamland Chronicles]]'',  and the movie ''[[Sailor Moon SuperS movie|Sailor Moon Super S the Movie: Black Dream Hole]]'' also have dream realms in their universes.

The ''[[American Dragon Jake Long]]'' episode "Dreamscape" takes place mainly in a dream realm. Similarly, the ''[[Xiaolin Showdown]]'' episode [[Dreamscape (Xiaolin Showdown)|of the same title]] also uses the dream world in its plotline.

In ''[[Clamp (manga artists)|Clamp]]'' manga series such as ''[[X/1999]]'', ''[[Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle]]'' and ''[[xxxHolic]]'', the dream world is very important to the events that occur within each story. It is later revealed in ''xxxHolic'' that the dream world itself is its own world, as part of the Clamp multiverse. Similarly, in the ''[[Bone (comics)|Bone]]'' graphic novel series by Jeff Smith, the primary plot device is a dream world called "The Dreaming." It exists independently from the real world, and it is described similarly to a river, being said to "flow" through people in "currents."

In ''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure]]'' part 3 "[[Stardust Crusaders]]," Jotaro and his friends and grandpa are put in a dream world which takes the form of an amusement park by Mannish Boy and his Death 13 stand.

In the ''[[Jay Jay the Jet Plane]]'' cartoon series, adventures where air-breathing jet planes cannot go (underwater and in space) happen as dreams.

===TV===
The ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' episode "[[Waking Moments]]" uses several dream realms and false awakenings. In the ''[[UFO (TV series)|UFO]]'' episode "Ordeal," Foster's abduction and rescue is explained away as a dream. The whole of season 8 of ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' was retroactively explained, at the start of Season 9, as a dream had by [[Bobby Ewing]]. In the [[Xena: Warrior Princess]] episode, "Dreamworker", [[Morpheus (mythology)|Morpheus]], god of dreams, abducts Gabrielle to take as his bride. But Xena follows them into his realm, the DreamScape, where she battles to stop the impending [[forced marriage]]. The ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode, "[[Amy's Choice (Doctor Who)|Amy's Choice]]" also depicts multiple dream worlds, which were found out to have been induced by a parasitic seed. Dreamworlds are revisited in the ''Doctor Who'' Christmas special, "[[Last Christmas (Doctor Who)|Last Christmas]]," which depicts dreams within dreams caused by mind-leeching aliens.

===Video games===
The video games ''[[Link's Awakening]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' take place in a dream of the Wind Fish's (whom [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]] must wake up) and [[Mario]]'s respectively.

''[[Alundra]]'' revolves around a dreamwalker who can enter people's dreams. It takes place on an island, where a village has locals suffering from recurring nightmares that sometimes cause death. With his dreamwalking ability, the titular protagonist Alundra attempts to help the locals by entering their dreams.

In the first two games of the [[EarthBound (series)|''EarthBound'']] series, the protagonist (Ninten in ''[[EarthBound Zero]]'' and Ness in ''[[EarthBound]]'') must travel to a dream world named Magicant. However, the two Magicants are different from each other. Ninten visits his Magicant, which is light pink and has seashell spires and clouds, multiple times during the story, until it is revealed to not be his own Magicant but instead just a collection of the memories of his great-grandmother, Maria. Ness's Magicant is a surreal, spacelike land in a purple sea that Ness only gains access to once he records the eight melodies into his Sound Stone, which he then must travel to the center of in order to overcome his weaknesses, characterized by a boss battle against his 'Nightmare' (with an appearance similar to the 'Mani-Mani Statue', a mysterious object encountered in another dreamworld called Moonside), and absorb the power of the Earth into his heart.

About a half of ''[[Tak 2: The Staff of Dreams]]'' takes place in the Dream World, home to the Staff of Dreams, which was later split by Pins and Needles, where Tak has a half of the staff and Pins and Needles have the Staff of Nightmares half. By the end of the game, Tak restored the staff.

In ''[[Dragon Quest VI: Realms of Reverie]]'', the game is split between two worlds initially known as the Real World and the Phantom World, named such because any being from the Real World is rendered unseen by the inhabitants of the Phantom World, like a phantom, and are only capable of becoming visible after drinking a special [[elixir]]. After a time, it is revealed that the Phantom World is in fact the true Real World, while the former Real World is called the Dream World, created from the dreams of the people of the Real World, in which each inhabitant has a Dream World counterpart. In addition, the main antagonist of the game, Deathtamoor, plots to try to merge both the Real World and Dream World with his own "Dark World" in an attempt for world domination.

In ''[[Dreamfall: The Longest Journey]]'' and ''[[Dreamfall Chapters]]'' the protagonist Zoë Castillo can travel to Marcuria by dreaming. There's a third world called 'Storytime' inspired by the Australian ''[[Dreamtime]]'' myths which is the place of the creation and where every story begins and ends. Also, the protagonist must stop a corporation called WATI-Corp which want to steal dreams and memories from people through their new entertainment device: the Dreamachine which allows people to make lucid dreams.

In ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'', the main group of protagonists sometimes experience the lives of three soldiers, [[Laguna Loire|Laguna]], [[Kiros Seagill|Kiros]], and [[Ward Zabac|Ward]] in what they call "the dream world" (which is actually the past) through a mysterious and gifted woman who is acquainted with both parties. The whole of [[Zanarkand]] in ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'' and its [[Final Fantasy X HD|HD remake]] was a dream, along with the main character, [[Tidus]].

In the video game ''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]'', there is a short quest which takes place in a dream world. In the video game, ''[[Fallout 3]]'', a main storyline quest involves the main character going into a virtual reality simulator, referred to as "Tranquility Lane," a dream world simulation of a 1950s suburban neighborhood.   

Other dreamworlds are the Maginaryworld from ''[[Sonic Shuffle]]'', Dream Depot from ''[[Mario Party 5]]'', and in Nightopia and Nightmare (collectively known in a place called the "Night Dimension") from ''[[Nights into Dreams...]]'' and its sequel for the [[Wii]], ''[[Nights: Journey of Dreams]]''.

In the video game ''[[Driver: San Francisco]]'', main character John Tanner suffers a car accident that leaves him in a coma. The game take places in his dream, but the character himself doesn't realize he's dreaming. Instead, he thinks he had a lucky escape and with this, thinks that he got an ability to [[Spirit possession|possess]] other people. During the game, many billboards will turn black and show "wake up" messages.

In [[Pokémon Black and White|''Pokémon Black'' and ''White'']] and its following sequel, players can tuck in one of their Pokémon via a system known as Game Sync. As the tucked in Pokémon falls asleep, it will then be sent to special website, where the player can play with his/her Pokémon in an alternate world called the "Dream World".

In ''[[Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance]]'', the seventh installment in the game series ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'', the two main protagonists are sent to worlds that are in slumber and that are dreaming in order to pass the Mark of mastery exam.

The Dream World is the main focus of ''[[Mario &amp; Luigi: Dream Team]]'' where [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]] travel through a world full of Luigi's dreams.

''[[Klonoa 2: Lunatea's Veil]]'' takes place in Lunatea, a dream world.

'''Erotic furniture''', also known as '''sex furniture''', is any form of [[furniture]] that can act as an aid to [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]]. While almost anything can be used for this purpose, the most common form of furniture employed for sexual activity is the [[bed (furniture)|bed]], but couches and sofas come a close second. These are not strictly [[Eroticism|erotic]] furniture, as their primary use is not erotic.

Specifically designed furniture for erotic purposes can include
* Devices for [[erotic spanking|spanking]] and [[flagellation]] such as the [[Berkley Horse]]
* [[Sex swing]]s
* Sex Gliders
* Devices for using gravity to aid in lovemaking without the use of complicated slings.
* [[Fisting sling]]s
* Various types of angled foam wedges or specially designed pillows that support various [[sex position]]s.  See [[Liberator shapes]] for example or the ergonomically based Lovebumpers.
* [[Bondage (BDSM)|Bondage]] equipment such as [[stocks]] and [[pillory|pillories]]
* [[Smotherbox]]es and other [[queening stool]]s.
* The Love Chair, a curious chair made of curved [[tubular steel]], articulated in several ways and designed to facilitate otherwise impossible sexual acts. This device was advertised in men's magazines in the mid-1970s, and is seen in at least one of [[Nina Hartley]]'s ''Guide to'' videos, but it is no longer commercially available.

{{Evolutionary biology}}

'''Evolutionary psychology''' is a theoretical approach in the [[social science|social]] and [[natural science]]s that examines psychological structure from a modern [[evolution]]ary perspective. It seeks to identify which human psychological traits are evolved [[adaptation]]s – that is, the functional products of [[natural selection]] or [[sexual selection in human evolution]]. [[Adaptationist]] thinking about physiological mechanisms, such as the heart, lungs, and immune system, is common in [[evolutionary biology]]. Some evolutionary psychologists apply the same thinking to psychology, arguing that the [[modularity of mind]] is similar to that of the body and with different modular adaptations serving different functions. Evolutionary psychologists argue that much of human behavior is the output of [[psychological adaptation]]s that evolved to solve recurrent problems in human ancestral environments.&lt;ref&gt;Confer et al. 2010; Buss, 2005; Durrant &amp; Ellis, 2003; Pinker, 2002; Tooby &amp; Cosmides, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the same evolutionary psychologists also suggest that it is not simply a subdiscipline of psychology but that evolutionary theory can provide a foundational, [[Metatheory|metatheoretical]] framework that integrates the entire field of psychology in the same way evolution has for biology.&lt;ref name=Cosmides/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duntley and Buss 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carmen, R.A., et al. (2013). Evolution Integrated Across All Islands of the Human Behavioral Archipelago: All Psychology as Evolutionary Psychology. EvoS Journal: The Journal of the Evolutionary Studies Consortium, 5, pp. 108–26. {{ISSN|1944-1932}} [http://evostudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Carmen_-Vol5Iss1.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary psychologists hold that behaviors or traits that occur universally in all cultures are good candidates for evolutionary adaptations&lt;ref name=Psychology&gt;Schacter et al. 2007, pp. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt; including the abilities to infer others' emotions, discern kin from non-kin, identify and prefer healthier mates, and cooperate with others. They report successful tests of theoretical predictions related to such topics as [[infanticide]], [[intelligence]], [[marriage]] patterns, [[promiscuity]], perception of [[beauty]], [[bride price]], and [[parental investment]].&lt;ref name=social-behavior&gt;"Despite this difficulty, there have been many careful and informative studies of human social behavior from an evolutionary perspective. Infanticide, intelligence, marriage patterns, promiscuity, perception of beauty, bride price, altruism, and the allocation of parental care have all been explored by testing predictions derived from the idea that conscious and unconscious behaviours have evolved to maximize inclusive fitness. The findings have been impressive." "social behaviour, animal." Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica, 2011. Web. 23 January 2011. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/550897/animal-social-behaviour].&lt;/ref&gt;

The theories and findings of evolutionary psychology have applications in many fields, including economics, environment, health, law, management, [[psychiatry]], politics, and literature.&lt;ref name=Oxford2007&gt;The Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, Edited by Robin Dunbar and Louise Barret, Oxford University Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, edited by David M. Buss, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Criticism of evolutionary psychology]] involves questions of testability, cognitive and evolutionary assumptions (such as modular functioning of the brain, and large uncertainty about the ancestral environment), importance of non-genetic and non-adaptive explanations, as well as political and ethical issues due to interpretations of research results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rose |first=Hilary |title=Alas, Poor Darwin : Arguments Against Evolutionary Psychology |year=2000 |publisher=Harmony; 1 Amer ed edition (10 October 2000) |isbn=0-609-60513-5 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Alas-Poor-Darwin-Evolutionary-Psychology/dp/0609605135}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520236202|title=The Trouble with Nature: Sex in Science and Popular Culture|last=Lancaster|first=Roger|publisher=University of California Press|year=2003|isbn=9780520236202|location=Berkeley|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==

===Principles===
Evolutionary psychology is an approach that views [[human nature]] as the product of a universal set of evolved psychological adaptations to recurring problems in the ancestral environment. Proponents suggest that it seeks to integrate psychology into the other natural sciences, rooting it in the organizing theory of biology ([[evolutionary theory]]), and thus understanding [[psychology]] as a branch of [[biology]]. Anthropologist [[John Tooby]] and psychologist [[Leda Cosmides]] note:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Evolutionary psychology is the long-forestalled scientific attempt to assemble out of the disjointed, fragmentary, and mutually contradictory human disciplines a single, logically integrated research framework for the psychological, social, and behavioral sciences – a framework
that not only incorporates the evolutionary sciences on a full and equal basis, but that systematically works out all of the revisions in existing belief and research practice that such a synthesis requires.&lt;ref&gt;Tooby &amp; Cosmides 2005, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Just as human [[physiology]] and [[evolutionary physiology]] have worked to identify physical adaptations of the body that represent "human physiological nature," the purpose of evolutionary psychology is to identify evolved emotional and cognitive adaptations that represent "human psychological nature." According to [[Steven Pinker]], it is "not a single theory but a large set of hypotheses" and a term that "has also come to refer to a particular way of applying evolutionary theory to the mind, with an emphasis on adaptation, gene-level selection, and modularity." Evolutionary psychology adopts an understanding of the mind that is based on the [[computational theory of mind]]. It describes mental processes as computational operations, so that, for example, a fear response is described as arising from a neurological computation that inputs the perceptional data, e.g. a visual image of a spider, and outputs the appropriate reaction, e.g. fear of possibly dangerous animals. Under this view, any [[Domain-general learning]] is impossible because of the [[Combinatorial explosion]]. This implies [[Domain-specific learning]]. Evolutionary Psychology specifies the domain as the problems of survival and reproduction. &lt;ref&gt; Buss, David M. "Evolutionary Psychology: The New Science of The Mind" 5th edition. pages 28-29. &lt;/ref&gt; 

While philosophers have generally considered the human mind to include broad faculties, such as reason and lust, evolutionary psychologists describe evolved psychological mechanisms as narrowly focused to deal with specific issues, such as catching cheaters or choosing mates. The discipline views the [[human brain]] as comprising many functional mechanisms,{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} called ''psychological adaptations'' or evolved cognitive mechanisms or ''[[cognitive modules]]'', designed by the process of natural selection. Examples include [[language acquisition|language-acquisition modules]], [[Westermarck effect|incest-avoidance mechanisms]], [[Wason selection task|cheater-detection mechanisms]], intelligence and sex-specific mating preferences, foraging mechanisms, alliance-tracking mechanisms, agent-detection mechanisms, and others. Some mechanisms, termed ''domain-specific'', deal with recurrent adaptive problems over the course of human evolutionary history.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} ''Domain-general'' mechanisms, on the other hand, are proposed to deal with evolutionary novelty.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Evolutionary psychology has roots in [[cognitive psychology]] and evolutionary biology but also draws on [[behavioral ecology]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[genetics]], [[ethology]], [[anthropology]], [[archaeology]], biology, and [[zoology]]. It is closely linked to [[sociobiology]],&lt;ref name=Psychology/&gt; but there are key differences between them including the emphasis on ''domain-specific'' rather than ''domain-general'' mechanisms, the relevance of measures of current [[fitness (biology)|fitness]], the importance of [[mismatch theory]], and psychology rather than behavior. Most of what is now labeled as sociobiological research is now confined to the field of behavioral ecology.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

(2000). Tingergen's Four Questions Organized. [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~nesse/Nesse-Tinbergen4Q.PDF Read online].&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary psychology focuses primarily on the "why?" questions, while traditional psychology focuses on the "how?" questions.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-Steven-J-C-2003-pp.1-24&gt;Gaulin and McBurney 2003 pp. 1–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|History of evolutionary psychology}}
Evolutionary psychology has its historical roots in [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of natural selection.&lt;ref name=Psychology /&gt; In ''The Origin of Species'', Darwin predicted that psychology would develop an evolutionary basis:
{{quote|In the distant future I see open fields for far more important researches. Psychology will be based on a new foundation, that of the necessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation.|{{cite wikisource |first=Charles |last=Darwin |title=The Origin of Species |year=1859 |page=488 |wslink=Page%3AOrigin_of_Species_1859_facsimile.djvu/500}}}}
Two of his later books were devoted to the study of animal emotions and psychology; ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]]'' in 1871 and ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]'' in 1872. Darwin's work inspired [[William James]]'s functionalist approach to psychology.&lt;ref name=Psychology/&gt; Darwin's theories of evolution, adaptation, and natural selection have provided insight into why brains function the way they do.&lt;ref name=Schacter&gt;{{cite book |last=Schacter |title=Psychology 2nd Ed. |publisher=Worth Publishers |isbn=978-1-4292-3719-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schacter |first=Daniel L. |title=Psychology |year=2011 |publisher=Worth Publishers |location=New York, NY |page=26 |edition=2 |first2=Daniel T. |last2=Gilbert |first3=Daniel M. |last3=Wegner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The content of evolutionary psychology has derived from, on the one hand, the biological sciences (especially [[evolution]]ary theory as it relates to ancient human environments, the study of [[paleoanthropology]] and animal behavior) and, on the other, the human sciences, especially psychology.

Evolutionary biology as an [[academic discipline]] emerged with the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] in the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Sterelny, Kim. 2009. In Ruse, Michael &amp; Travis, Joseph (eds) Wilson, Edward O. (Foreword) Evolution: The First Four Billion Years. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Ma. {{ISBN|978-0-674-03175-3}}. p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s the study of animal behavior (ethology) emerged with the work of the Dutch biologist Nikolaas Tinbergen and the Austrian biologists [[Konrad Lorenz]] and [[Karl von Frisch]].

W.D. Hamilton's (1964) papers on [[inclusive fitness]] and [[Robert Trivers]]'s (1972)&lt;ref name=Trivers1971&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=2822435 |pages=35–57 |last1=Trivers |first1=R. L. |title=The Evolution of Reciprocal Altruism |volume=46 |issue=1 |journal=[[The Quarterly Review of Biology]] |year=1971 |doi=10.1086/406755}}&lt;/ref&gt; theories on [[reciprocity (evolution)|reciprocity]] and parental investment helped to establish evolutionary thinking in psychology and the other social sciences. In 1975, [[E.O. Wilson|Edward O. Wilson]] combined evolutionary theory with studies of animal and social behavior, building on the works of Lorenz and Tinbergen, in his book ''[[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis]]''.

In the 1970s, two major branches developed from ethology. Firstly, the study of animal ''social'' behavior (including humans) generated [[sociobiology]], defined by its pre-eminent proponent Edward O. Wilson in 1975 as "the systematic study of the biological basis of all social behavior"&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Edward O. 1975.[http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog/WILSOR.html ''Sociobiology: The New Synthesis''.] Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Ma. {{ISBN|0-674-00089-7}} p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1978 as "the extension of population biology and evolutionary theory to social organization."&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Edward O. 1978. ''On Human Nature''. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Ma. p. x.&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, there was behavioral ecology which placed less emphasis on ''social'' behavior; it focused on the ecological and evolutionary basis of animal and [[human behavioral ecology|human]] behavior.

In the 1970s and 1980s university departments began to include the term ''evolutionary biology'' in their titles. The modern era of evolutionary psychology was ushered in, in particular, by [[Donald Symons]]' 1979 book ''[[The Evolution of Human Sexuality]]'' and [[Leda Cosmides]] and [[John Tooby]]'s 1992 book ''[[The Adapted Mind]]''.&lt;ref name=Psychology/&gt;

From psychology there are the primary streams of [[developmental psychology|developmental]], [[social psychology|social]] and cognitive psychology. Establishing some measure of the relative influence of genetics and environment on behavior has been at the core of [[Behavioural genetics|behavioral genetics]] and its variants, notably studies at the molecular level that examine the relationship between genes, neurotransmitters and behavior. [[Dual inheritance theory]] (DIT), developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s, has a slightly different perspective by trying to explain how [[human behavior]] is a product of two different and interacting evolutionary processes: [[genetic evolution]] and [[cultural evolution]]. DIT is seen by some as a "middle-ground" between views that emphasize human universals versus those that emphasize cultural variation.&lt;ref&gt;Laland, Kevin N. and Gillian R. Brown. 2002. ''Sense &amp; Nonsense: Evolutionary Perspectives on Human Behavior.'' Oxford University Press, Oxford. pp. 287–319.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical foundations==
{{Main article|Theoretical foundations of evolutionary psychology}}
The theories on which evolutionary psychology is based originated with Charles Darwin's work, including his speculations about the evolutionary origins of social instincts in humans. Modern evolutionary psychology, however, is possible only because of advances in evolutionary theory in the 20th century.

Evolutionary psychologists say that natural selection has provided humans with many psychological adaptations, in much the same way that it generated humans' anatomical and physiological adaptations.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-Steven-J-C-2003-pp.25-56&gt;Gaulin and McBurney 2003 pp. 25–56.&lt;/ref&gt; As with adaptations in general, psychological adaptations are said to be specialized for the environment in which an organism evolved, the environment of evolutionary adaptedness.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-Steven-J-C-2003-pp.25-56/&gt;&lt;ref name=Economics-2003&gt;See also "Environment of evolutionary adaptation," a variation of the term used in Economics, e.g., in {{cite journal | last1 = Rubin | first1 = Paul H | year = 2003 | title = Folk economics | journal = Southern Economic Journal | volume = 70 | issue = 1| pages = 157–71 | doi=10.2307/1061637}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual selection provides organisms with adaptations related to mating.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-Steven-J-C-2003-pp.25-56/&gt; For male [[mammal]]s, which have a relatively high maximal potential reproduction rate, sexual selection leads to adaptations that help them compete for females.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-Steven-J-C-2003-pp.25-56/&gt; For female mammals, with a relatively low maximal potential reproduction rate, sexual selection leads to choosiness, which helps females select higher quality mates.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-Steven-J-C-2003-pp.25-56/&gt; Charles Darwin described both natural selection and sexual selection, and he relied on group selection to explain the evolution of [[Altruism|altruistic]] (self-sacrificing) behavior. But group selection was considered a weak explanation, because in any group the less altruistic individuals will be more likely to survive, and the group will become less self-sacrificing as a whole.

In 1964, [[W.D. Hamilton|William D. Hamilton]] proposed [[inclusive fitness]] theory, emphasizing a [[gene-centered view of evolution]]. Hamilton noted that genes can increase the replication of copies of themselves into the next generation by influencing the organism's social traits in such a way that (statistically) results in helping the survival and reproduction of other copies of the same genes (most simply, identical copies in the organism's close relatives). According to [[Hamilton's rule]], self-sacrificing behaviors (and the genes influencing them) can evolve if they typically help the organism's close relatives so much that it more than compensates for the individual animal's sacrifice. Inclusive fitness theory resolved the issue of how altruism can evolve. Other theories also help explain the evolution of altruistic behavior, including [[evolutionary game theory]], [[tit-for-tat]] reciprocity, and generalized reciprocity. These theories help to explain the development of altruistic behavior, and account for hostility toward cheaters (individuals that take advantage of others' altruism).&lt;ref name=moralanimal/&gt;

Several mid-level evolutionary theories inform evolutionary psychology. The [[r/K selection]] theory proposes that some species prosper by having many offspring, while others follow the strategy of having fewer offspring but investing much more in each one. Humans follow the second strategy. Parental investment theory explains how parents invest more or less in individual offspring based on how successful those offspring are likely to be, and thus how much they might improve the parents' inclusive fitness. According to the [[Trivers-Willard hypothesis]], parents in good conditions tend to invest more in sons (who are best able to take advantage of good conditions), while parents in poor conditions tend to invest more in daughters (who are best able to have successful offspring even in poor conditions). According to [[life history theory]], animals evolve life histories to match their environments, determining details such as age at first reproduction and number of offspring. Dual inheritance theory posits that genes and human culture have interacted, with genes affecting the development of culture, and culture, in turn, affecting human evolution on a genetic level (see also the [[Baldwin effect]]).

==Evolved psychological mechanisms==
{{Main article|psychological adaptation|l1=Evolved psychological mechanisms}}
Evolutionary psychology is based on the hypothesis that, just like hearts, lungs, livers, kidneys, and immune systems, cognition has functional structure that has a genetic basis, and therefore has evolved by natural selection. Like other organs and tissues, this functional structure should be universally shared amongst a species, and should solve important problems of survival and [[reproduction]].

Evolutionary psychologists seek to understand psychological mechanisms by understanding the survival and reproductive functions they might have served over the course of evolutionary history.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} These might include abilities to infer others' emotions, discern kin from non-kin, identify and prefer healthier mates, cooperate with others and follow leaders. Consistent with the theory of natural selection, evolutionary psychology sees humans as often in conflict with others, including mates and relatives. For instance, a mother may wish to wean her offspring from breastfeeding earlier than does her infant, which frees up the mother to invest in additional offspring.&lt;ref name=moralanimal/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scilib-biology.narod.ru/MoralAnimal/index_en.html |title=The Moral Animal: Why We Are The Way We Are: The New Science of Evolutionary Psychology |accessdate=15 October 2013 |first=Robert |last=Wright}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary psychology also recognizes the role of kin selection and reciprocity in evolving prosocial traits such as altruism.&lt;ref name=moralanimal/&gt; Like [[chimpanzee]]s and [[bonobo]]s, humans have subtle and flexible social instincts, allowing them to form extended families, lifelong friendships, and political alliances.&lt;ref name=moralanimal/&gt; In studies testing theoretical predictions, evolutionary psychologists have made modest findings on topics such as infanticide, intelligence, marriage patterns, promiscuity, perception of beauty, bride price and parental investment.&lt;ref name=social-behavior/&gt;

===Historical topics===
Proponents of evolutionary psychology in the 1990s made some explorations in historical events, but the response from historical experts was highly negative and there has been little effort to continue that line of research. Historian [[Lynn Hunt]] says that the historians complained that the researchers:
:have read the wrong studies, misinterpreted the results of experiments, or worse yet, turned to neuroscience looking for a universalizing, anti-representational and anti-intentional ontology to bolster their claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hunt | first1 = Lynn | year = 2014 | title = The Self and Its History | url = | journal = American Historical Review | volume = 119 | issue = 5| pages = 1576–86 | doi=10.1093/ahr/119.5.1576}} quote p 1576.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hunt states that, "the few attempts to build up a subfield of psychohistory collapsed under the weight of its presuppositions." She concludes that as of 2014 the "'iron curtain' between historians and psychology...remains standing."&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, "The Self and Its History." p. 1578.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Products of evolution: adaptations, exaptations, byproducts, and random variation===
Not all traits of organisms are evolutionary adaptations. As noted in the table below, traits may also be [[exaptation]]s, byproducts of adaptations (sometimes called "spandrels"), or random variation between individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Buss et al. 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychological adaptations are hypothesized to be innate or relatively easy to learn, and to manifest in cultures worldwide. For example, the ability of toddlers to learn a language with virtually no training is likely to be a psychological adaptation. On the other hand, ancestral humans did not read or write, thus today, learning to read and write require extensive training, and presumably represent byproducts of cognitive processing that use psychological adaptations designed for other functions.&lt;ref&gt;Pinker, Steven. (1994) The Language Instinct&lt;/ref&gt; However, variations in manifest behavior can result from universal mechanisms interacting with different local environments. For example, Caucasians who move from a northern climate to the equator will have darker skin. The mechanisms regulating their pigmentation do not change; rather the input to those mechanisms change, resulting in different output.

One of the tasks of evolutionary psychology is to identify which psychological traits are likely to be adaptations, byproducts or random variation. [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] suggested that an "adaptation is a special and onerous concept that should only be used where it is really necessary."&lt;ref&gt;George C Williams, ''Adaptation and Natural Selection''. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by Williams and others, adaptations can be identified by their improbable complexity, species universality, and adaptive functionality.

===Obligate and facultative adaptations===
A question that may be asked about an adaptation is whether it is generally obligate (relatively robust in the face of typical environmental variation) or facultative (sensitive to typical environmental variation).&lt;ref name=Buss-D-M-2011&gt;Buss, D. M. (2011). Evolutionary psychology.&lt;/ref&gt; The sweet taste of sugar and the pain of hitting one's knee against concrete are the result of fairly obligate psychological adaptations; typical environmental variability during development does not much affect their operation. By contrast, facultative adaptations are somewhat like "if-then" statements. For example, adult attachment style seems particularly sensitive to early childhood experiences. As adults, the propensity to develop close, trusting bonds with others is dependent on whether early childhood caregivers could be trusted to provide reliable assistance and attention. The adaptation for skin to tan is conditional to exposure to sunlight; this is an example of another facultative adaptation. When a psychological adaptation is facultative, evolutionary psychologists concern themselves with how developmental and environmental inputs influence the expression of the adaptation.

===Cultural universals===
{{main article|Cultural universal}}
Evolutionary psychologists hold that behaviors or traits that occur universally in all cultures are good candidates for evolutionary adaptations.&lt;ref name=Psychology/&gt; Cultural universals include behaviors related to language, cognition, social roles, gender roles, and technology.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald E. Brown|Brown, Donald E.]] (1991) Human Universals. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Evolved psychological adaptations (such as the ability to learn a language) interact with cultural inputs to produce specific behaviors (e.g., the specific language learned). Basic gender differences, such as greater eagerness for sex among men and greater coyness among women,&lt;ref&gt;Symons, D. (1979). The evolution of human sexuality. Oxford: Oxford University Press. Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt; are explained as sexually dimorphic psychological adaptations that reflect the different reproductive strategies of males and females.&lt;ref name=moralanimal/&gt;&lt;ref name=BS&gt;Pinker 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary psychologists contrast their approach to what they term the "[[standard social science model]]," according to which the mind is a general-purpose cognition device shaped almost entirely by culture.&lt;ref&gt;Barkow et al. 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=instinct&gt;"instinct." Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica, 2011. Web. 18 February 2011. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/289249/instinct].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environment of evolutionary adaptedness==
{{Main article|Human evolution}}
Evolutionary psychology argues that to properly understand the functions of the brain, one must understand the properties of the environment in which the brain evolved. That environment is often referred to as the "environment of evolutionary adaptedness".&lt;ref name=Economics-2003/&gt;

The idea of an ''environment of evolutionary adaptedness'' was first explored as a part of [[attachment theory]] by [[John Bowlby]].&lt;ref name=Bowlby1969&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowlby |first=John |title=Attachment |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |year=1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the environment to which a particular evolved mechanism is adapted. More specifically, the environment of evolutionary adaptedness is defined as the set of historically recurring selection pressures that formed a given adaptation, as well as those aspects of the environment that were necessary for the proper development and functioning of the adaptation.

Humans, comprising the genus ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'', appeared between 1.5 and 2.5 million years ago, a time that roughly coincides with the start of the [[Pleistocene]] 2.6 million years ago. Because the Pleistocene ended a mere 12,000 years ago, most human adaptations either newly evolved during the Pleistocene, or were maintained by [[stabilizing selection]] during the Pleistocene. Evolutionary psychology therefore proposes that the majority of human psychological mechanisms are adapted to reproductive problems frequently encountered in Pleistocene environments.&lt;ref name=Symons1992&gt;{{cite book |last=Symons |first=Donald |authorlink=Donald Symons |chapter=On the use and misuse of Darwinism in the study of human behavior |title=The Adapted Mind: Evolutionary psychology and the generation of culture |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1992 |pages=137–59 |isbn=0-19-510107-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In broad terms, these problems include those of growth, development, differentiation, maintenance, mating, parenting, and social relationships.

The environment of evolutionary adaptedness is significantly different from modern society.&lt;ref name=EBO-social/&gt; The ancestors of modern humans lived in smaller groups, had more cohesive cultures, and had more stable and rich contexts for identity and meaning.&lt;ref name=EBO-social&gt;"social behaviour, animal." Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica, 2011. Web. 23 January 2011. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/550897/animal-social-behaviour].&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers look to existing hunter-gatherer societies for clues as to how hunter-gatherers lived in the environment of evolutionary adaptedness.&lt;ref name=moralanimal/&gt; Unfortunately, the few surviving hunter-gatherer societies are different from each other, and they have been pushed out of the best land and into harsh environments, so it is not clear how closely they reflect ancestral culture.&lt;ref name=moralanimal/&gt;

Evolutionary psychologists sometimes look to chimpanzees, bonobos, and other great apes for insight into human ancestral behavior.&lt;ref name=moralanimal&gt;Wright 1995&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher Ryan (author)|Christopher Ryan]] and Cacilda Jethá argue that evolutionary psychologists have overemphasized the similarity of humans and chimps, which are more violent, while underestimating the similarity of humans and bonobos, which are more peaceful.{{sfn|Ryan|Jethá|2010}}

===Mismatches===

Since an organism's adaptations were suited to its ancestral environment, a new and different environment can create a mismatch. Because humans are mostly adapted to [[Pleistocene]] environments, psychological mechanisms sometimes exhibit "mismatches" to the modern environment. One example is the fact that although about 10,000 people are killed with guns in the US annually,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr54/nvsr54_10.pdf CDC pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; whereas spiders and snakes kill only a handful, people nonetheless learn to fear spiders and snakes about as easily as they do a pointed gun, and more easily than an unpointed gun, rabbits or flowers.&lt;ref name=Ohman2001&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ohman |first1=A. |last2=Mineka |first2=S. |year=2001 |title=Fears, phobias, and preparedness: Toward an evolved module of fear and fear learning |journal=Psychological Review |volume=108 |issue=3 |pages=483–522 |url=http://instruct.uwo.ca/psychology/371g/Ohman2001.pdf |accessdate=16 June 2008 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.3.483 |pmid=11488376}}&lt;/ref&gt; A potential explanation is that spiders and snakes were a threat to human ancestors throughout the Pleistocene, whereas guns (and rabbits and flowers) were not. There is thus a mismatch between humans' evolved fear-learning psychology and the modern environment.&lt;ref name=Pinker1999&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pinker |first=Steve |title=How the Mind Works |pages=386–89 |year=1999 |publisher=WW Norton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hagen2006&gt;{{cite journal

This mismatch also shows up in the phenomena of the [[supernormal stimulus]], a stimulus that elicits a response more strongly than the stimulus for which the response evolved. The term was coined by [[Niko Tinbergen]] to refer to non-human animal behavior, but psychologist [[Deirdre Barrett]] said that supernormal stimulation governs the behavior of humans as powerfully as that of other animals. She explained junk food as an exaggerated stimulus to cravings for salt, sugar, and fats,&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, Deirdre. Waistland: The R/Evolutionary Science Behind Our Weight and Fitness Crisis (2007). New York: W.W. Norton. pp. 31–51.&lt;/ref&gt; and she says that television is an exaggeration of social cues of laughter, smiling faces and attention-grabbing action.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, Deirdre.

Norton, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Magazine centerfolds and double cheeseburgers pull instincts intended for an environment of evolutionary adaptedness where breast development was a sign of health, youth and fertility in a prospective mate, and fat was a rare and vital nutrient.&lt;ref name=abcde&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Game theory and human evolution: A critique of some recent interpretations of experimental games

Naturally Selected: The Evolutionary Science of Leadership (2011). New York: Harper Business.&lt;/ref&gt; His argument is that humans are not adapted to work in large, anonymous bureaucratic structures with formal hierarchies. The human mind still responds to personalized, charismatic leadership primarily in the context of informal, egalitarian settings. Hence the dissatisfaction and alienation that many employees experience. Salaries, bonuses and other privileges exploit instincts for relative status, which attract particularly males to senior executive positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Van Vugt |first1=Mark |last2=Ronay |first2=Richard |year=2014 |title=The Evolutionary Psychology of Leadership |url=|journal=Organizational Psychology Review |volume=4 |issue=|pages=74–95 |doi=10.1177/2041386613493635}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research methods==
Evolutionary theory is [[heuristic]] in that it may generate hypotheses that might not be developed from other theoretical approaches. One of the major goals of adaptationist research is to identify which organismic traits are likely to be adaptations, and which are byproducts or random variations. As noted earlier, adaptations are expected to show evidence of complexity, functionality, and species universality, while byproducts or random variation will not. In addition, adaptations are expected to manifest as proximate mechanisms that interact with the environment in either a generally obligate or facultative fashion (see above). Evolutionary psychologists are also interested in identifying these proximate mechanisms (sometimes termed "mental mechanisms" or "psychological adaptations") and what type of information they take as input, how they process that information, and their outputs.&lt;ref name=Buss-D-M-2011/&gt; [[Evolutionary developmental psychology]], or "evo-devo," focuses on how adaptations may be activated at certain developmental times (e.g., losing baby teeth, adolescence, etc.) or how events during the development of an individual may alter life history trajectories.

Evolutionary psychologists use several strategies to develop and test hypotheses about whether a psychological trait is likely to be an evolved adaptation. Buss (2011)&lt;ref&gt;Buss, D.M. (2011). Evolutionary psychology. Chapter 2. Boston: Pearson/A and B.&lt;/ref&gt; notes that these methods include:

:''Cross-cultural Consistency.'' Characteristics that have been demonstrated to be cross cultural [[human universals]] such as smiling, crying, facial expressions are presumed to be evolved psychological adaptations. Several evolutionary psychologists have collected massive datasets from cultures around the world to assess cross-cultural universality.

:''Function to Form (or "problem to solution").'' The fact that males, but not females, risk potential misidentification of genetic offspring (referred to as "paternity insecurity") led evolutionary psychologists to hypothesize that, compared to females, male jealousy would be more focused on sexual, rather than emotional, infidelity.

:''Form to Function (reverse-engineering – or "solution to problem").'' [[Morning sickness]], and associated aversions to certain types of food, during pregnancy seemed to have the characteristics of an evolved adaptation (complexity and universality). [[Margie Profet]] hypothesized that the function was to avoid the ingestion of toxins during early pregnancy that could damage fetus (but which are otherwise likely to be harmless to healthy non-pregnant women).

:''Corresponding Neurological Modules.'' Evolutionary psychology and cognitive neuropsychology are mutually compatible – evolutionary psychology helps to identify psychological adaptations and their ultimate, evolutionary functions, while neuropsychology helps to identify the proximate manifestations of these adaptations.

:''Current evolutionary Adaptiveness.'' In addition to evolutionary models that suggest evolution occurs across large spans of time, recent research has demonstrated that some evolutionary shifts can be fast and dramatic. Consequently, some evolutionary psychologists have focused on the impact of psychological traits in the current environment. Such research can be used to inform estimates of the prevalence of traits over time. Such work has been informative in studying evolutionary psychopathology.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, N.C. (2016). Current Evolutionary Adaptiveness of Psychiatric Disorders: Fertility Rates, Parent-Child Relationship Quality, and Psychiatric Disorders. Journal of Abnormal Psychology&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary psychologists also use various sources of data for testing, including experiments, [[archaeological record]]s, data from hunter-gatherer societies, observational studies, neuroscience data, self-reports and surveys, [[public record]]s, and human products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Main areas of research==
Foundational areas of research in evolutionary psychology can be divided into broad categories of adaptive problems that arise from the theory of evolution itself: survival, mating, parenting, family and kinship, interactions with non-kin, and cultural evolution.

===Survival and individual level psychological adaptations===
Problems of survival are clear targets for the evolution of physical and psychological adaptations. Major problems the ancestors of present-day humans faced included food selection and acquisition; territory selection and physical shelter; and avoiding predators and other environmental threats.&lt;ref name=Buss-D-M-2011b&gt;Buss, D.M.

''Evolutionary Analysis.'' 2007. Pearson Education, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his paper "Evolution of consciousness," [[John Eccles (neurophysiologist)|John Eccles]] argues that special anatomical and physical adaptations of the mammalian [[cerebral cortex]] gave rise to consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=2360081 |pages=7320–24 |last1=Eccles |first1=J. C. |title=Evolution of consciousness |volume=89 |issue=16 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |year=1992 |pmid=1502142 |pmc=49701 |doi=10.1073/pnas.89.16.7320|bibcode=1992PNAS...89.7320E }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, others have argued that the recursive circuitry underwriting consciousness is much more primitive, having evolved initially in pre-mammalian species because it improves the capacity for interaction with both social ''and'' natural environments by providing an energy-saving "neutral" gear in an otherwise energy-expensive motor output machine.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Frederic [http://precedings.nature.com/documents/2444/version/1 "Consciousness as Recursive, Spatiotemporal Self-Location"]&lt;/ref&gt; Once in place, this recursive circuitry may well have provided a basis for the subsequent development of many of the functions that consciousness facilitates in higher organisms, as outlined by Bernard J. Baars.&lt;ref&gt;Baars, Bernard J. ''A Cognitive Theory of Consciousness.'' 1993. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Dawkins suggested that humans evolved consciousness in order to make themselves the subjects of thought.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-5/&gt; Daniel Povinelli suggests that large, tree-climbing apes evolved consciousness to take into account one's own mass when moving safely among tree branches.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-5/&gt; Consistent with this hypothesis, Gordon Gallup found that chimps and orangutans, but not little monkeys or terrestrial gorillas, demonstrated self-awareness in mirror tests.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-5/&gt;

The concept of consciousness can refer to voluntary action, awareness, or wakefulness. However, even voluntary behavior involves unconscious mechanisms. Many cognitive processes take place in the cognitive unconscious, unavailable to conscious awareness. Some behaviors are conscious when learned but then become unconscious, seemingly automatic. Learning, especially implicitly learning a skill, can take place outside of consciousness. For example, plenty of people know how to turn right when they ride a bike, but very few can accurately explain how they actually do so. Evolutionary psychology approaches self-deception as an adaptation that can improve one's results in social exchanges.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-5/&gt;

Sleep may have evolved in humans to conserve energy when activity would be less fruitful or more dangerous, such as at night, and especially during the winter season.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-5&gt;Gaulin and McBurney 2003 p. 101–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sensation and perception====
{{See also|Sensation (psychology)|perception}}

Many experts, such as [[Jerry Fodor]], write that the purpose of perception is knowledge, but evolutionary psychologists hold that its primary purpose is to guide action.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-4/&gt; For example, they say, [[depth perception]] seems to have evolved not to help us know the distances to other objects but rather to help us move around in space.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-4/&gt; Evolutionary psychologists say that animals from fiddler crabs to humans use eyesight for collision avoidance, suggesting that vision is basically for directing action, not providing knowledge.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-4&gt;Gaulin and McBurney 2003 pp. 81–101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Building and maintaining sense organs is metabolically expensive, so these organs evolve only when they improve an organism's fitness.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-4/&gt; More than half the brain is devoted to processing sensory information, and the brain itself consumes roughly one-fourth of one's metabolic resources, so the senses must provide exceptional benefits to fitness.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-4/&gt; Perception accurately mirrors the world; animals get useful, accurate information through their senses.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-4/&gt;

Scientists who study perception and sensation have long understood the human senses as adaptations to their surrounding worlds.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-4/&gt; Depth perception consists of processing over half a dozen visual cues, each of which is based on a regularity of the physical world.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-4/&gt; Vision evolved to respond to the narrow range of electromagnetic energy that is plentiful and that does not pass through objects.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-4/&gt; Sound waves go around corners and interact with obstacles, creating a complex pattern that includes useful information about the sources of and distances to objects.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-4/&gt; Larger animals naturally make lower-pitched sounds as a consequence of their size.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-4/&gt; The range over which an animal hears, on the other hand, is determined by adaptation. Homing pigeons, for example, can hear very low-pitched sound (infrasound) that carries great distances, even though most smaller animals detect higher-pitched sounds.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-4/&gt; Taste and smell respond to chemicals in the environment that are thought to have been significant for fitness in the environment of evolutionary adaptedness.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-4/&gt; For example, salt and sugar were apparently both valuable to the human or pre-human inhabitants of the environment of evolutionary adaptedness, so present day humans have an intrinsic hunger for salty and sweet tastes.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-4/&gt; The sense of touch is actually many senses, including pressure, heat, cold, tickle, and pain.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-4/&gt; Pain, while unpleasant, is adaptive.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-4/&gt; An important adaptation for senses is range shifting, by which the organism becomes temporarily more or less sensitive to sensation.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-4/&gt; For example, one's eyes automatically adjust to dim or bright ambient light.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-4/&gt; Sensory abilities of different organisms often coevolve, as is the case with the hearing of echolocating bats and that of the moths that have evolved to respond to the sounds that the bats make.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-4/&gt;

Evolutionary psychologists contend that perception demonstrates the principle of modularity, with specialized mechanisms handling particular perception tasks.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-4/&gt; For example, people with damage to a particular part of the brain suffer from the specific defect of not being able to recognize faces (prosopagnosia).&lt;ref name=Gaulin-4/&gt; Evolutionary psychology suggests that this indicates a so-called face-reading module.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-4/&gt;

====Learning and facultative adaptations====
In evolutionary psychology, learning is said to be accomplished through evolved capacities, specifically facultative adaptations.&lt;ref name=LearningG8&gt;Gaulin and McBurney 2003 Chapter 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Facultative adaptations express themselves differently depending on input from the environment.&lt;ref name=LearningG8/&gt; Sometimes the input comes during development and helps shape that development.&lt;ref name=LearningG8/&gt; For example, migrating birds learn to orient themselves by the stars during a critical period in their maturation.&lt;ref name=LearningG8/&gt; Evolutionary psychologists believe that humans also learn language along an evolved program, also with critical periods.&lt;ref name=LearningG8/&gt; The input can also come during daily tasks, helping the organism cope with changing environmental conditions.&lt;ref name=LearningG8/&gt; For example, animals evolved Pavlovian conditioning in order to solve problems about causal relationships.&lt;ref name=LearningG8/&gt; Animals accomplish learning tasks most easily when those tasks resemble problems that they faced in their evolutionary past, such as a rat learning where to find food or water.&lt;ref name=LearningG8/&gt; Learning capacities sometimes demonstrate differences between the sexes.&lt;ref name=LearningG8/&gt; In many animal species, for example, males can solve spatial problem faster and more accurately than females, due to the effects of male hormones during development.&lt;ref name=LearningG8/&gt; The same might be true of humans.&lt;ref name=LearningG8/&gt;

====Emotion and motivation====
{{Main article|Evolution of emotion}}
Motivations direct and energize behavior, while emotions provide the affective component to motivation, positive or negative.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-6&gt;Gaulin and McBurney 2003 pp. 121–42.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1970s, [[Paul Ekman]] and colleagues began a line of research which suggests that many emotions are universal.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-6/&gt; He found evidence that humans share at least five basic emotions: fear, sadness, happiness, anger, and disgust.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-6/&gt; Social emotions evidently evolved to motivate social behaviors that were adaptive in the environment of evolutionary adaptedness.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-6/&gt; For example, spite seems to work against the individual but it can establish an individual's reputation as someone to be feared.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-6/&gt; Shame and pride can motivate behaviors that help one maintain one's standing in a community, and self-esteem is one's estimate of one's status.&lt;ref name=moralanimal/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gaulin-6/&gt;
Motivation has a neurobiological basis in the [[reward system]] of the brain. Recently, it has been suggested that reward systems may evolve in such a way that there may be an [[inherent]] or unavoidable [[trade-off]] in the motivational system for activities of short versus long duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Belke | first1 = T.

====Cognition====
Cognition refers to internal representations of the world and internal information processing. From an evolutionary psychology perspective, cognition is not "general purpose," but uses heuristics, or strategies, that generally increase the likelihood of solving problems that the ancestors of present-day humans routinely faced. For example, present day humans are far more likely to solve logic problems that involve detecting cheating (a common problem given humans' social nature) than the same logic problem put in purely abstract terms.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-7&gt;Gaulin and McBurney 2003 Chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the ancestors of present-day humans did not encounter truly random events, present day humans may be cognitively predisposed to incorrectly identify patterns in random sequences. "Gamblers' Fallacy" is one example of this. Gamblers may falsely believe that they have hit a "lucky streak" even when each outcome is actually random and independent of previous trials. Most people believe that if a fair coin has been flipped 9 times and Heads appears each time, that on the tenth flip, there is a greater than 50% chance of getting Tails.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-6/&gt; Humans find it far easier to make diagnoses or predictions using frequency data than when the same information is presented as probabilities or percentages, presumably because the ancestors of present-day humans lived in relatively small tribes (usually with fewer than 150 people) where frequency information was more readily available.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-6/&gt;

====Personality====
Evolutionary psychology is primarily interested in finding commonalities between people, or basic human psychological nature. From an evolutionary perspective, the fact that people have fundamental differences in personality traits initially presents something of a puzzle.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-9&gt;Gaulin and McBurney 2003 Chapter 9.&lt;/ref&gt; (Note: The field of behavioral genetics is concerned with statistically partitioning differences between people into genetic and environmental sources of variance. However, understanding the concept of [[heritability]] can be tricky – heritability refers only to the differences between people, never the degree to which the traits of an individual are due to environmental or genetic factors, since traits are always a complex interweaving of both.)

Personality traits are conceptualized by evolutionary psychologists as due to normal variation around an optimum, due to frequency-dependent selection (behavioral [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphisms]]), or as facultative adaptations. Like variability in height, some personality traits may simply reflect inter-individual variability around a general optimum.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-9/&gt; Or, personality traits may represent different genetically predisposed "behavioral morphs" – alternate behavioral strategies that depend on the frequency of competing behavioral strategies in the population. For example, if most of the population is generally trusting and gullible, the behavioral morph of being a "cheater" (or, in the extreme case, a sociopath) may be advantageous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0140525X00039595 |title=The sociobiology of sociopathy: An integrated evolutionary model |year=2010 |last1=Mealey |first1=Linda |journal=[[Behavioral and Brain Sciences]] |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=523–41}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, like many other psychological adaptations, personality traits may be facultative – sensitive to typical variations in the social environment, especially during early development. For example, later born children are more likely than first borns to be rebellious, less conscientious and more open to new experiences, which may be advantageous to them given their particular niche in family structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sulloway |first=F. |year=1996 |title=Born to rebel. |location=NY |publisher=Pantheon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that shared environmental influences do play a role in personality and are not always of less importance than genetic factors. However, shared environmental influences often decrease to near zero after adolescence but do not completely disappear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bouchard |first=T. J. |year=2004 |title=Genetic influence on human psychological traits. A survey. |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=13 |number=4 |pages=148–51 |accessdate=14 September 2014 |url=http://www.psy.miami.edu/faculty/dmessinger/c_c/rsrcs/rdgs/temperament/boucard.04.curdir.pdf |doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.00295.x }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Language====
{{See also|Evolutionary linguistics|Evolutionary psychology of language}}

According to [[Steven Pinker]], who builds on the work by [[Noam Chomsky]], the universal human ability to learn to talk between the ages of 1 – 4, basically without training, suggests that language acquisition is a distinctly human psychological adaptation (see, in particular, Pinker's ''[[The Language Instinct]]''). Pinker and [[Paul Bloom (psychologist)|Bloom]] (1990) argue that language as a mental faculty shares many likenesses with the complex organs of the body which suggests that, like these organs, language has evolved as an adaptation, since this is the only known mechanism by which such complex organs can develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pinker |first1=S. |last2=Bloom |first2=P. |year=1990 |title=Natural language and natural selection |journal=[[Behavioral and Brain Sciences]] |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=707–27 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X00081061 |citeseerx=10.1.1.116.4044 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pinker follows Chomsky in arguing that the fact that children can learn any human language with no explicit instruction suggests that language, including most of grammar, is basically innate and that it only needs to be activated by interaction. Chomsky himself does not believe language to have evolved as an adaptation, but suggests that it likely evolved as a byproduct of some other adaptation, a so-called [[Spandrel (biology)|spandrel]]. But Pinker and Bloom argue that the organic nature of language strongly suggests that it has an adaptational origin.&lt;ref&gt;Workman, Lance and Will Reader (2004) Evolutionary psychology: an introduction. Cambridge University Press p. 259&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary psychologists hold that the [[FOXP2]] gene may well be associated with the evolution of human language.&lt;ref name=10WR&gt;Workman, Lance and Will Reader (2008). Evolutionary psychology: an introduction. 2nd Ed. Cambridge University Press. Chapter 10.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, psycholinguist Myrna Gropnik identified a dominant gene that causes language impairment in the [[KE family]] of Britain.&lt;ref name=10WR/&gt; This gene turned out to be a mutation of the FOXP2 gene.&lt;ref name=10WR/&gt; Humans have a unique allele of this gene, which has otherwise been closely conserved through most of mammalian evolutionary history.&lt;ref name=10WR/&gt; This unique allele seems to have first appeared between 100 and 200 thousand years ago, and it is now all but universal in humans.&lt;ref name=10WR/&gt; However, the once-popular idea that FOXP2 is a 'grammar gene' or that it triggered the emergence of language in ''Homo sapiens'' is now widely discredited.&lt;ref&gt;Diller, K. C. and R. L. Cann 2009. Evidence against a genetic-based revolution in language 50,000 years ago. In R. Botha and C. Knight (eds), ''The Cradle of Language.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 135–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently several competing theories about the evolutionary origin of language coexist, none of them having achieved a general consensus.&lt;ref name=W&amp;R-2008:277&gt;Workman &amp; Reader 2008:277 "There are a number of hypotheses suggesting that language evolved to fulfil a social function such as social grooming (to bind large groups together), the making of social contracts (to enable monogamy and male provisioning) and the use of language to impress potential mates. While each of these hypotheses has its merits, each is still highly speculative and requires more evidence from different areas of research (such as linguistics and anthropology)."&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers of language acquisition in primates and humans such as [[Michael Tomasello]] and [[Talmy Givón]], argue that the innatist framework has understated the role of imitation in learning and that it is not at all necessary to posit the existence of an innate grammar module to explain human language acquisition. Tomasello argues that studies of how children and primates actually acquire communicative skills suggests that humans learn complex behavior through experience, so that instead of a module specifically dedicated to language acquisition, language is acquired by the same cognitive mechanisms that are used to acquire all other kinds of socially transmitted behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Workman, Lance and Will Reader (2004) Evolutionary psychology: an introduction. Cambridge University Press p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;

On the issue of whether language is best seen as having evolved as an adaptation or as a spandrel, evolutionary biologist [[W. Tecumseh Fitch]], following [[Stephen J. Gould]], argues that it is unwarranted to assume that every aspect of language is an adaptation, or that language as a whole is an adaptation. He criticizes some strands of evolutionary psychology for suggesting a pan-adaptionist view of evolution, and dismisses Pinker and Bloom's question of whether "Language has evolved as an adaptation" as being misleading. He argues instead that from a biological viewpoint the evolutionary origins of language is best conceptualized as being the probable result of a convergence of many separate adaptations into a complex system.&lt;ref&gt;W. Tecumseh Fitch (2010) The Evolution of Language. Cambridge University Press pp. 65–66&lt;/ref&gt; A similar argument is made by [[Terrence Deacon]] who in ''[[The Symbolic Species]]'' argues that the different features of language have co-evolved with the evolution of the mind and that the ability to use symbolic communication is integrated in all other cognitive processes.&lt;ref&gt;Deacon, Terrence W. (1997) The Symbolic Species: The Co-evolution of Language and the Brain. W.W. Norton &amp; Co&lt;/ref&gt;

If the theory that language could have evolved as a single adaptation is accepted, the question becomes which of its many functions has been the basis of adaptation. Several evolutionary hypotheses have been posited: that language evolved for the purpose of social grooming, that it evolved as a way to show mating potential or that it evolved to form social contracts. Evolutionary psychologists recognize that these theories are all speculative and that much more evidence is required to understand how language might have been selectively adapted.&lt;ref&gt;Workman, Lance and Will Reader (2004) Evolutionary psychology: an introduction. Cambridge University Press p. 277&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mating===
{{main article|Sex differences in psychology}}

Given that sexual reproduction is the means by which genes are propagated into future generations, sexual selection plays a large role in human evolution. Human [[mating]], then, is of interest to evolutionary psychologists who aim to investigate evolved mechanisms to attract and secure mates.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, G.D. Love and Instinct. London: Temple Smith, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; Several lines of research have stemmed from this interest, such as studies of mate selection&lt;ref&gt;Buss 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buss &amp; Barnes 1986&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Li |first1=N.

In 1972 [[Robert Trivers]] published an influential paper&lt;ref&gt;Trivers, R. (1972). Parental investment and sexual selection. In B. Campbell (Ed.), ''Sexual Selection and the Descent of Man''. Chicago: Aldine-Atherton.&lt;/ref&gt; on sex differences that is now referred to as [[Parental investment|parental investment theory]]. The size differences of [[gametes]] ([[anisogamy]]) is the fundamental, defining difference between males (small gametes – sperm) and females (large gametes – ova). Trivers noted that anisogamy typically results in different levels of parental investment between the sexes, with females initially investing more. Trivers proposed that this difference in parental investment leads to the [[sexual selection]] of different [[Human mating strategies|reproductive strategies]] between the sexes and to [[sexual conflict]]. For example, he suggested that the sex that invests less in offspring will generally compete for access to the higher-investing sex to increase their [[inclusive fitness]] (also see [[Bateman's principle]]&lt;ref name="doi10.1038/hdy.1948.21"&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = A. J.| title = Intra-sexual selection in Drosophila| journal = Heredity| last1 = Bateman| volume = 2| issue = Pt. 3| pages = 349–821| year = 1948 | doi = 10.1038/hdy.1948.21| pmid=18103134}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Trivers posited that differential parental investment led to the evolution of sexual dimorphisms in [[mate choice]], intra- and inter- sexual reproductive competition, and [[courtship display]]s. In mammals, including humans, females make a much larger parental investment than males (i.e. [[gestation]] followed by childbirth and [[lactation]]). Parental investment theory is a branch of [[life history theory]].

[[David Buss|Buss]] and [[David P. Schmitt|Schmitt]]'s (1993) ''Sexual Strategies Theory''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buss | first1 = D. M. | last2 = Schmitt | first2 = D. P. | year = 1993 | title = Sexual strategies theory: an evolutionary perspective on human mating | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 100 | issue = 2| page = 204 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.100.2.204}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that, due to differential parental investment, humans have evolved sexually dimorphic adaptations related to "sexual accessibility, fertility assessment, commitment seeking and avoidance, immediate and enduring resource procurement, paternity certainty, assessment of mate value, and parental investment." Their ''Strategic Interference Theory''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Buss |first1=D. M. |year=1989 |title=Conflict between the sexes: strategic interference and the evocation of anger and upset |url=|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=56 |issue=5| pages=735–47 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.56.5.735}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that conflict between the sexes occurs when the preferred reproductive strategies of one sex interfere with those of the other sex, resulting in the activation of emotional responses such as anger or jealousy.

Women are generally more selective when choosing mates, especially under long term mating conditions. However, under some circumstances, short term mating can provide benefits to women as well, such as fertility insurance, trading up to better genes, reducing risk of inbreeding, and insurance protection of her offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/sep/03/anthonybrowne.theobserver|title=Women are promiscuous, naturally|first1=Anthony|last1=Browne|first2=health|last2=editor|date=2 September 2000|publisher=|accessdate=10 August 2016|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to male paternity insecurity, sex differences have been found in the domains of [[sexual jealousy]].&lt;ref&gt;Buss 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buss et al. 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Females generally react more adversely to emotional infidelity and males will react more to sexual infidelity. This particular pattern is predicted because the costs involved in mating for each sex are distinct. Women, on average, should prefer a mate who can offer resources (e.g., financial, commitment), thus, a woman risks losing such resources with a mate who commits emotional infidelity. Men, on the other hand, are never certain of the genetic paternity of their children because they do not bear the offspring themselves ("paternity insecurity"). This suggests that for men sexual infidelity would generally be more aversive than emotional infidelity because investing resources in another man's offspring does not lead to propagation of their own genes.&lt;ref&gt;Kalat, J. W. (2013). Biological Psychology (11th ed.). Cengage Learning. {{ISBN|9781111831004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

These putative preferences are predicted to be especially apparent for short-term mating domains because a potential male mate would only be offering genes to a potential offspring. This hypothesis allows researchers to examine whether women select mates who have characteristics that indicate high genetic quality during the high fertility phase of their ovulatory cycles. Indeed, studies have shown that women's preferences vary across the ovulatory cycle. In particular, Haselton and Miller (2006) showed that highly fertile women prefer creative but poor men as short-term mates. Creativity may be a proxy for good genes.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, G. F. (2000b) ''The mating mind: How sexual choice shaped the evolution of human nature''. Anchor Books: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Research by Gangestad et al. (2004) indicates that highly fertile women prefer men who display social presence and intrasexual competition; these traits may act as cues that would help women predict which men may have, or would be able to acquire, resources.

===Parenting===
{{Main article|Evolutionary psychology of parenting}}

Reproduction is always costly for women, and can also be for men. Individuals are limited in the degree to which they can devote time and resources to producing and raising their young, and such expenditure may also be detrimental to their future condition, survival and further reproductive output.
Parental investment is any parental expenditure (time, energy etc.) that benefits one [[offspring]] at a cost to parents' ability to invest in other components of fitness (Clutton-Brock 1991: 9; Trivers 1972). Components of fitness (Beatty 1992) include the well-being of existing offspring, parents' future [[sexual reproduction|reproduction]], and inclusive fitness through aid to kin ([[W. D. Hamilton|Hamilton]], 1964). Parental investment theory is a branch of life history theory.

Robert Trivers' theory of parental investment predicts that the sex making the largest investment in [[lactation]], nurturing and protecting offspring will be more discriminating in mating and that the sex that invests less in offspring will compete for access to the higher investing sex (see [[Bateman's principle]]).&lt;ref name="doi10.1038/hdy.1948.21"/&gt; Sex differences in parental effort are important in determining the strength of sexual selection.

The benefits of parental investment to the offspring are large and are associated with the effects on condition, growth, survival and ultimately, on reproductive success of the offspring. However, these benefits can come at the cost of parent's ability to reproduce in the future e.g. through the increased risk of injury when defending offspring against predators, the loss of mating opportunities whilst rearing offspring and an increase in the time to the next reproduction. Overall, parents are [[Selection (biology)|selected]] to maximize the difference between the benefits and the costs, and parental care will likely evolve when the benefits exceed the costs.

The [[Cinderella effect]] is an alleged high incidence of stepchildren being physically, emotionally or sexually abused, neglected, murdered, or otherwise mistreated at the hands of their stepparents at significantly higher rates than their genetic counterparts. It takes its name from the fairy tale character Cinderella, who in the story was cruelly mistreated by her stepmother and stepsisters.&lt;ref&gt;Daly, Matin, and Margo I. Wilson. (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Daly and Wilson (1996) noted: "Evolutionary thinking led to the discovery of the most important risk factor for child homicide – the presence of a stepparent. Parental efforts and investments are valuable resources, and selection favors those parental psyches that allocate effort effectively to promote fitness. The adaptive problems that challenge parental decision making include both the accurate identification of one's offspring and the allocation of one's resources among them with sensitivity to their needs and abilities to convert parental investment into fitness increments…. Stepchildren were seldom or never so valuable to one's expected fitness as one's own offspring would be, and those parental psyches that were easily parasitized by just any appealing youngster must always have incurred a selective disadvantage"(Daly &amp; Wilson, 1996, pp.&amp;nbsp;64–65). However, they note that not all stepparents will "want" to abuse their partner's children, or that genetic parenthood is any insurance against abuse. They see step parental care as primarily "mating effort" towards the genetic parent.&lt;ref name=Daly_Wilson_98&gt;Daly &amp; Wilson 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family and kin===
{{see also|Human inclusive fitness|Kin selection}}
Inclusive fitness is the sum of an organism's classical fitness (how many of its own offspring it produces and supports) and the number of equivalents of its own offspring it can add to the population by supporting others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.personalityresearch.org/evolutionary/inclusive.html|title=Evolutionary Psychology – Inclusive Fitness|publisher=|accessdate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first component is called classical fitness by Hamilton (1964).

From the gene's point of view, evolutionary success ultimately depends on leaving behind the maximum number of copies of itself in the population. Until 1964, it was generally believed that genes only achieved this by causing the individual to leave the maximum number of viable offspring. However, in 1964 W. D. Hamilton proved mathematically that, because close relatives of an organism share some identical genes, a gene can also increase its evolutionary success by promoting the reproduction and survival of these related or otherwise similar individuals. Hamilton concluded that this leads natural selection to favor organisms that would behave in ways that maximize their inclusive fitness. It is also true that natural selection favors behavior that maximizes personal fitness.

Hamilton's rule describes mathematically whether or not a gene for altruistic behavior will spread in a population:
:&lt;math&gt;rb &gt; c \ &lt;/math&gt;
where
* &lt;math&gt;c \ &lt;/math&gt; is the reproductive cost to the altruist,
* &lt;math&gt;b \ &lt;/math&gt; is the reproductive benefit to the recipient of the altruistic behavior, and
* &lt;math&gt;r \ &lt;/math&gt; is the probability, above the population average, of the individuals sharing an altruistic gene – commonly viewed as "degree of relatedness".

The concept serves to explain how natural selection can perpetuate altruism. If there is an "altruism gene" (or complex of genes) that influences an organism's behavior to be helpful and protective of relatives and their offspring, this behavior also increases the proportion of the altruism gene in the population, because relatives are likely to share genes with the altruist due to [[identical by descent|common descent]]. Altruists may also have some way to recognize altruistic behavior in unrelated individuals and be inclined to support them. As Dawkins points out in ''The Selfish Gene'' (Chapter 6) and ''The Extended Phenotype'',&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard, "The Extended Phenotype", Oxford University Press 1982 (Chapter 9)&lt;/ref&gt; this must be distinguished from the [[green-beard effect]].

Although it is generally true that humans tend to be more altruistic toward their kin than toward non-kin, the relevant proximate mechanisms that mediate this cooperation have been debated (see [[kin recognition]]), with some arguing that kin status is determined primarily via social and cultural factors (such as co-residence, maternal association of sibs, etc.),&lt;ref name=W2010&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2010.08.001 |title=Sixteen common misconceptions about the evolution of cooperation in humans |year=2011 |last1=West |first1=Stuart A. |last2=El Mouden |first2=Claire |last3=Gardner |first3=Andy |journal=Evolution and Human Behavior |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=231–62 |url=http://www.zoo.ox.ac.uk/group/west/pdf/WestElMoudenGardner_11.pdf |access-date=25 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812085608/http://www.zoo.ox.ac.uk/group/west/pdf/WestElMoudenGardner_11.pdf |archive-date=12 August 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; while others have argued that kin recognition can also be mediated by biological factors such as facial resemblance and immunogenetic similarity of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC).&lt;ref&gt;Villinger, J., and Waldman, B. (2012). Social discrimination by quantitative assessment of immunogenetic similarity. Published online before print 5 September 2012, {{DOI|10.1098/rspb.2012.1279}} Proc. R. Soc. B&lt;/ref&gt; For a discussion of the interaction of these social and biological kin recognition factors see Lieberman, Tooby, and Cosmides (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Lieberman, D., Tooby, J. &amp; Cosmides, L. The architecture of human kin detection Nature 445, 727–31 (15 February 2007) |{{DOI|10.1038/nature05510}} {{PMID|17301784}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([http://www.psych.ucsb.edu/research/cep/papers/kinnature05510.pdf PDF]).

Whatever the proximate mechanisms of kin recognition there is substantial evidence that humans act generally more altruistically to close genetic kin compared to genetic non-kin.&lt;ref name=ReferenceA&gt;Buss, D.M. (2011). Evolutionary Psychology. Monterey: Brooks-Cole.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gaulin-2004&gt;Gaulin &amp; McBurney (2004), Evolutionary Psychology, 2nd Ed. NY: Prentice Hall&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Workman &amp; Reader (2008), Evolutionary Psychology, 2nd Ed. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interactions with non-kin / reciprocity===
Although interactions with non-kin are generally less altruistic compared to those with kin, cooperation can be maintained with non-kin via mutually beneficial reciprocity as was proposed by Robert Trivers.&lt;ref name=Trivers1971/&gt; If there are repeated encounters between the same two players in an evolutionary game in which each of them can choose either to "cooperate" or "defect," then a strategy of mutual cooperation may be favored even if it pays each player, in the short term, to defect when the other cooperates. Direct reciprocity can lead to the evolution of cooperation only if the probability, w, of another encounter between the same two individuals exceeds the cost-to-benefit ratio of the altruistic act:
: w &gt; c/b

Reciprocity can also be indirect if information about previous interactions is shared. Reputation allows evolution of cooperation by indirect reciprocity. Natural selection favors strategies that base the decision to help on the reputation of the recipient: studies show that people who are more helpful are more likely to receive help. The calculations of indirect reciprocity are complicated and only a tiny fraction of this universe has been uncovered, but again a simple rule has emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9634232 |year=1998 |last1=Nowak |first1=MA |last2=Sigmund |first2=K |title=Evolution of indirect reciprocity by image scoring |volume=393 |issue=6685 |pages=573–77 |doi=10.1038/31225 |journal=Nature |authorlink1=Martin Nowak |authorlink2=Karl Sigmund |bibcode=1998Natur.393..573N }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indirect reciprocity can only promote cooperation if the probability, q, of knowing someone’s reputation exceeds the cost-to-benefit ratio of the altruistic act:
: q &gt; c/b

One important problem with this explanation is that individuals may be able to evolve the capacity to obscure their reputation, reducing the probability, q, that it will be known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature04201 |title=Human cooperation: Second-order free-riding problem solved? |last1=Fowler |first1=James H. |journal=Nature |volume=437 |issue=7058 |pages=E8; discussion E8–9 |authorlink1=James H. Fowler|date=22 September 2005 |pmid=16177738|bibcode=2005Natur.437E...8F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trivers argues that friendship and various social emotions evolved in order to manage reciprocity.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-Steven-J-C-2003-pp.323-52&gt;Gaulin, Steven J. C. and Donald H. McBurney. Evolutionary Psychology. Prentice Hall. 2003. {{ISBN|978-0-13-111529-3}}, Chapter 14, pp. 323–52.&lt;/ref&gt; Liking and disliking, he says, evolved to help present day humans' ancestors form coalitions with others who reciprocated and to exclude those who did not reciprocate.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-Steven-J-C-2003-pp.323-52/&gt; Moral indignation may have evolved to prevent one's altruism from being exploited by cheaters, and gratitude may have motivated present day humans' ancestors to reciprocate appropriately after benefiting from others' altruism.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-Steven-J-C-2003-pp.323-52/&gt; Likewise, present day humans feel guilty when they fail to reciprocate.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-Steven-J-C-2003-pp.323-52/&gt; These social motivations match what evolutionary psychologists expect to see in adaptations that evolved to maximize the benefits and minimize the drawbacks of reciprocity.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-Steven-J-C-2003-pp.323-52/&gt;

Evolutionary psychologists say that humans have psychological adaptations that evolved specifically to help us identify nonreciprocators, commonly referred to as "cheaters."&lt;ref name=Gaulin-Steven-J-C-2003-pp.323-52/&gt; In 1993, Robert Frank and his associates found that participants in a prisoner's dilemma scenario were often able to predict whether their partners would "cheat," based on a half-hour of unstructured social interaction.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-Steven-J-C-2003-pp.323-52/&gt; In a 1996 experiment, for example, [[Linda Mealey]] and her colleagues found that people were better at remembering the faces of people when those faces were associated with stories about those individuals cheating (such as embezzling money from a church).&lt;ref name=Gaulin-Steven-J-C-2003-pp.323-52/&gt;

===Strong reciprocity (or "tribal reciprocity")===
{{Main article|Strong reciprocity}}

Humans may have an evolved set of psychological adaptations that predispose them to be more cooperative than otherwise would be expected with members of their tribal [[ingroups and outgroups|in-group]], and, more nasty to members of tribal [[ingroups and outgroups|out groups]]. These adaptations may have been a consequence of tribal warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bowles | first1 = S | year = 2009 | title = Did Warfare among Ancestral Hunter-Gatherer Groups Affect the Evolution of Human Social Behaviors | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/324/5932/1293 | journal = Science | volume = 324 | issue = | pages = 1293–98 | doi=10.1126/science.1168112| bibcode = 2009Sci...324.1293B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans may also have predispositions for "[[Third-party punishment|altruistic punishment]]" – to punish in-group members who violate in-group rules, even when this altruistic behavior cannot be justified in terms of helping those you are related to ([[kin selection]]), cooperating with those who you will interact with again ([[Reciprocity (evolution)#Direct reciprocity|direct reciprocity]]), or cooperating to better your reputation with others ([[Reciprocity (evolution)#Indirect reciprocity|indirect reciprocity]]).&lt;ref name=gintis2000&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gintis | first1 = H. | title = Strong Reciprocity and Human Sociality | doi = 10.1006/jtbi.2000.2111 | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 206 | issue = 2 | pages = 169–79 | year = 2000 | pmid =  10966755| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=henrich2012&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Henrich | first1 = J. | last2 = Chudek | first2 = M. | doi = 10.1017/S0140525X11001397 | title = Understanding the research program | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 35 | pages = 29–30 | year = 2012 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolutionary psychology and culture==
{{Main article|Evolutionary psychology and culture|}}

Though evolutionary psychology has traditionally focused on individual-level behaviors, determined by species-typical psychological adaptations, considerable work has been done on how these adaptations shape and, ultimately govern, culture (Tooby and Cosmides, 1989).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tooby|first1=J.|last2=Cosmides|first2=L.|title=Evolutionary psychology and the generation of culture, part I. Theoretical considerations.|journal=Ethology and Sociobiology|date=1989|volume=10|pages=29–49|doi=10.1016/0162-3095(89)90012-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tooby and Cosmides (1989) argued that the mind consists of many domain-specific psychological adaptations, some of which may constrain what cultural material is learned or taught. As opposed to a domain-general cultural acquisition program, where an individual passively receives culturally-transmitted material from the group, Tooby and Cosmides (1989), among others, argue that: "the psyche evolved to generate adaptive rather than repetitive behavior, and hence critically analyzes the behavior of those surrounding it in highly structured and patterned ways, to be used as a rich (but by no means the only) source of information out of which to construct a 'private culture' or individually tailored adaptive system; in consequence, this system may or may not mirror the behavior of others in any given respect." (Tooby and Cosmides 1989).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

===Developmental psychology===
{{Main article|Evolutionary developmental psychology}}

According to [[Paul Baltes]], the benefits granted by evolutionary selection decrease with age. Natural selection has not eliminated many harmful conditions and nonadaptive characteristics that appear among older adults, such as [[Alzheimer disease]]. If it were a disease that killed 20-year-olds instead of 70-year-olds this may have been a disease that natural selection could have eliminated ages ago. Thus, unaided by evolutionary pressures against nonadaptive conditions, modern humans suffer the aches, pains, and infirmities of aging and as the benefits of evolutionary selection decrease with age, the need for modern technological mediums against non-adaptive conditions increases.&lt;ref&gt;Santrock, W. John (2005). A Topical Approach to Life-Span Development (3rd ed.). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill. p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social psychology===
As humans are a highly social species, there are many adaptive problems associated with navigating the social world (e.g., maintaining allies, managing status hierarchies, interacting with outgroup members, coordinating social activities, collective decision-making). Researchers in the emerging field of evolutionary social psychology have made many discoveries pertaining to topics traditionally studied by social psychologists, including person perception, social cognition, attitudes, altruism, emotions, [[group dynamics]], [[leadership]], motivation, prejudice, intergroup relations, and cross-cultural differences.&lt;ref&gt;Neuberg, S.

Evolutionary psychologists have suggested that schizophrenia and bipolar disorder may reflect a side-effect of genes with fitness benefits, such as increased creativity.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-11&gt;Gaulin and McBurney 2003 pp. 239–56.&lt;/ref&gt; (Some individuals with bipolar disorder are especially creative during their manic phases and the close relatives of people with schizophrenia have been found to be more likely to have creative professions.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-11/&gt;) A 1994 report by the American Psychiatry Association found that people suffered from schizophrenia at roughly the same rate in Western and non-Western cultures, and in industrialized and pastoral societies, suggesting that schizophrenia is not a disease of civilization nor an arbitrary social invention.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-11/&gt; Sociopathy may represent an evolutionarily stable strategy, by which a small number of people who cheat on social contracts benefit in a society consisting mostly of non-sociopaths.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-Steven-J-C-2003-pp.1-24/&gt; Mild depression may be an adaptive response to withdraw from, and re-evaluate, situations that have led to disadvantageous outcomes (the "analytical rumination hypothesis")&lt;ref name=ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/&gt; (see [[Evolutionary approaches to depression]]).

Some of these speculations have yet to be developed into fully testable hypotheses, and a great deal of research is required to confirm their validity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Connell | first1 = H | year = 2004 | title = Evolutionary theory in psychiatry and psychology | url = | journal = Irish Journal of Psychological Medicine | volume = 21 | issue = 1| pages = 37–37 | doi=10.1017/s0790966700008193}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rose |first1=S. |year=2001 |title=Revisiting evolutionary psychology and psychiatry |url=|journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=179 |pages=558–59 |doi=10.1192/bjp.179.6.558-b |issue=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antisocial and criminal behavior===
{{Main article|Biosocial criminology#Evolutionary psychology}}
Evolutionary psychology has been applied to explain [[criminal]] or otherwise immoral behavior as being adaptive or related to adaptive behaviors. Males are generally more aggressive than females, who are more selective of their partners because of the far greater effort they have to contribute to pregnancy and child-rearing. Males being more aggressive is hypothesized to stem from the more intense reproductive competition faced by them. Males of low status may be especially vulnerable to being childless. It may have been evolutionary advantageous to engage in highly risky and violently aggressive behavior to increase their status and therefore reproductive success. This may explain why males are generally involved in more crimes, and why low status and being unmarried is associated with criminality. Furthermore, competition over females is argued to have been particularly intensive in late adolescence and young adulthood, which is theorized to explain why crime rates are particularly high during this period.&lt;ref name=AEP&gt;Aurelio José Figueredo, Paul Robert Gladden, Zachary Hohman. The evolutionary psychology of criminal behaviour. In {{Cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = S. C. | editor1-last = Roberts | doi = 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199586073.001.0001 | editor1-first = S.

Many conflicts that result in harm and death involve status, reputation, and seemingly trivial insults.&lt;ref name=AEP/&gt; [[Steven Pinker]] in his book ''[[The Blank Slate]]'' argues that in non-state societies without a police it was very important to have a credible [[deterrence theory|deterrence]] against aggression. Therefore, it was important to be perceived as having a credible reputation for retaliation, resulting in humans to develop instincts for [[revenge]] as well as for protecting reputation ("[[honor]]"). Pinker argues that the development of the state and the police have dramatically reduced the level of violence compared to the ancestral environment. Whenever the state breaks down, which can be very locally such as in poor areas of a city, humans again organize in groups for protection and aggression and concepts such as violent revenge and protecting honor again become extremely important.&lt;ref name=AEP/&gt;

Rape is theorized to be a reproductive strategy that facilitates the propagation of the rapist's progency. Such a strategy may be adopted by men who otherwise are unlikely to be appealing to women and therefore cannot form legitimate relationships, or by high status men on socially vulnerable women who are unlikely to retaliate to increase their reproductive success even further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hagen|first1=Edward H.|title=Evolutionary Psychology FAQ|url=http://www.anth.ucsb.edu/projects/human/evpsychfaq.html|website=www.anth.ucsb.edu|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sociobiological theories of rape]] are highly controversial, as traditional theories typically do not consider rape to be a behavioral adaptation, and objections to this theory are made on ethical, religious, political, as well as scientific grounds.

===Psychology of religion===
{{Main article|Evolutionary psychology of religion}}
Adaptationist perspectives on [[religious belief]] suggest that, like all behavior, religious behaviors are a product of the human brain. As with all other organ functions, [[cognition]]'s functional structure has been argued to have a genetic foundation, and is therefore subject to the effects of natural selection and sexual selection. Like other organs and tissues, this functional structure should be universally shared amongst humans and should have solved important problems of survival and reproduction in ancestral environments. However, evolutionary psychologists remain divided on whether religious belief is more likely a consequence of evolved psychological adaptations,&lt;ref name=Sosis&gt;{{cite journal |year=2003 |title=Signaling, solidarity, and the sacred: the evolution of religious behavior |journal=Evolutionary Anthropology |issue=6 |pages=264–74 |last1=Sosis |first1=R. |first2=C. |last2=Alcorta |doi=10.1002/evan.10120 |volume=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a byproduct of other cognitive adaptations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2006 |title=Whence collective rituals? A cultural selection model of ritualized behavior|journal=American Anthropologist |issue=4 |pages=824–27 |last1=Lienard |first1=P. |first2=P. |last2=Boyer |doi=10.1525/aa.2006.108.4.814 |volume=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coalitional psychology===
Coalitional [[psychology]] is an approach to explain political behaviors between different [[coalitions]] and the [[conditionality]] of these behaviors in evolutionary psychological perspective. This approach assumes that since human beings appeared on the earth, they have evolved to live in groups instead of living as individuals to achieve benefits such as more mating opportunities and increased status.&lt;ref name="Lopez 2011 and all"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lopez | first1 = Anthony C. | last2 = McDermott | first2 = Rose | last3 = Bang Petersen | first3 = Michael | year = 2011| title = States in Mind: Evolution, Coalitional Psychology, and International Politics | url = | journal = International Security | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 61–66 | doi=10.1162/isec_a_00056}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human beings thus naturally think and act in a way that manages and negotiates [[group dynamics]].

Coalitional psychology posits five hypotheses on how these [[psychological adaptation]]s operate:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lopez | first1 = Anthony C. | last2 = McDermott | first2 = Rose | last3 = Bang Petersen | first3 = Michael | year = 2011| title = States in Mind: Evolution, Coalitional Psychology, and International Politics | url = | journal = International Security | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 66–82 | doi=10.1162/isec_a_00056}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Humans represent groups as a special category of individual, unstable and with a short shadow of the future
* [[Political entrepreneurs]] strategically manipulate the coalitional environment, often appealing to emotional devices such as "outrage" to inspire [[collective action]].
* [[Relative gains]] dominate relations with enemies, whereas [[absolute gains]] characterize relations with allies.
* Coalitional size and male physical strength will positively predict individual support for aggressive foreign policies.
* Individuals with children, particularly women, will vary in adopting aggressive foreign policies than those without progeny.

==Reception and criticism==
{{Main article|Criticism of evolutionary psychology}}
Critics of evolutionary psychology accuse it of promoting genetic determinism, panadaptionism (the idea that all behaviors and anatomical features are adaptations), unfalsifiable hypotheses, distal or ultimate explanations of behavior when proximate explanations are superior, and malevolent political or moral ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Kurzban, Robert. [http://human-nature.com/nibbs/02/apd.html Alas poor evolutionary psychology]. The Human Nature Review 2002 Volume 2: 99–109 (14 March ). Retrieved 14 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethical implications===
Critics have argued that evolutionary psychology might be used to justify existing social hierarchies and [[reactionary]] policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rose |first1=Hilary |last2=Rose |first2=Steven |editor1-link=|others=|title=Alas, Poor Darwin: Arguments against Evolutionary Psychology |url=|edition=|year=2000 |publisher=Harmony Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-609-60513-4 |pages=1–13 |chapter=Introduction |chapterurl=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wilson2003&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilson |first1=David Sloan |last2=Dietrich |first2=Eric |last3=Clark |first3=Anne B. |year=2003 |title=On the inappropriate use of the naturalistic fallacy in evolutionary psychology |journal=Biology and Philosophy |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages=669–81 |publisher= |doi=10.1023/A:1026380825208 |url=http://evolution.binghamton.edu/dswilson/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/DSW14.pdf |accessdate=23 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415084544/http://evolution.binghamton.edu/dswilson/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/DSW14.pdf |archive-date=15 April 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested by critics that evolutionary psychologists' theories and interpretations of empirical data rely heavily on [[Ideology|ideological]] assumptions about race and gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Caporael |first1=Linnda R. |last2=Brewer |first2=Marilynn B. |year=1991 |title=The Quest for Human Nature: Social and Scientific Issues in Evolutionary Psychology |journal=Journal of Social Issues |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=1–9 |publisher=|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1991.tb01819.x |url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to such criticism, evolutionary psychologists often caution against committing the [[naturalistic fallacy]] – the assumption that "what is natural" is necessarily a moral good.&lt;ref name=wilson2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pinker&gt;Pinker, S. (2003). The blank slate. NY: Penguin&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2013}}&lt;ref name=Levy/&gt; However, their caution against committing the naturalistic fallacy has been criticized as means to stifle legitimate ethical discussions.&lt;ref name=wilson2003/&gt;

===Contradictions in models===
Some criticisms of evolutionary psychology point at contradictions between different aspects of adaptive scenarios posited by evolutionary psychology. One example is the evolutionary psychology model of extended social groups selecting for modern human brains, a contradiction being that the synaptic function of modern human brains require high amounts of many specific [[nutrient#Essentiality|essential nutrients]] so that such a transition to higher requirements of the same essential nutrients being shared by all individuals in a population would decrease the possibility of forming large groups due to bottleneck foods with rare essential nutrients capping group sizes. It is mentioned that some insects have societies with different ranks for each individual and that monkeys remain socially functioning after removal of most of the brain as additional arguments against big brains promoting social networking. The model of males as both providers and protectors is criticized for the impossibility of being in two places at once, the male cannot both protect his family at home and be out hunting at the same time. In the case of the claim that a provider male could buy protection service for his family from other males by [[barter]]ing food that he had hunted, critics point at the fact that the most valuable food (the food that contained the rarest essential nutrients) would be different in different ecologies and as such vegetable in some geographical areas and animal in others, making it impossible for hunting styles relying on physical strength or risk taking to be universally of similar value in bartered food and instead making it inevitable that in some parts of Africa, food gathered with no need for major physical strength would be the most valuable to barter for protection. A contradiction between evolutionary psychology's claim of men needing to be more sexually visual than women for fast speed of assessing women's fertility than women needed to be able to assess the male's genes and its claim of male sexual jealousy guarding against infidelity is also pointed at, as it would be pointless for a male to be fast to assess female fertility if he needed to assess the risk of there being a jealous male mate and in that case his chances of defeating him before mating anyway (pointlessness of assessing one necessary condition faster than another necessary condition can possibly be assessed).&lt;ref&gt;WE Frankenhuis Environmental unpredictability, Encyclopedia of Evolutionary Psychological Science, 2016 - Springer&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas T Kenrick, VIadas Griskevicius, Omar Mahmoud The rational animal: How evolution made us smarter than we think, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standard social science model===
{{Main article|Standard social science model}}
Evolutionary psychology has been entangled in the larger philosophical and social science controversies related to the debate on [[nature versus nurture]]. Evolutionary psychologists typically contrast evolutionary psychology with what they call the standard social science model (SSSM). They characterize the SSSM as the "[[blank slate]]", "[[Factual relativism|relativist]]", "[[Social constructionism|social constructionist]]", and "[[Cultural determinism|cultural determinist]]" perspective that they say dominated the [[social science]]s throughout the 20th century and assumed that the mind was shaped almost entirely by culture.&lt;ref name=Pinker/&gt;

Critics have argued that evolutionary psychologists created a [[False dilemma|false dichotomy]] between their own view and the [[caricature]] of the SSSM.&lt;ref name=Richardson&gt;{{cite book |last1=Richardson |first1=Robert C. |authorlink1=|authorlink2=|editor1-link=|others=|title=Evolutionary Psychology As Maladapted Psychology |url=https://books.google.com/?id=KeqiKNFa3YgC&amp;pg=PA176 |edition=|year=2007 |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-262-18260-7 |page=176 |chapter=|chapterurl=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wallace |first=Brendan |authorlink= |title=Getting Darwin Wrong: Why Evolutionary Psychology Won't Work |url=|accessdate= |year=2010 |publisher=Imprint Academic |location=Exeter |isbn=978-1-84540-207-5 |page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Solomon |first1=Sheldon |authorlink1=|authorlink2=|editor1-first=Mark |editor1-last=Schaller |editor2-first=Christian S |editor2-last=Crandall |title=The Psychological Foundations of Culture |url=|year=2004 |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |location=Mahwah, N.J. |isbn=978-0-8058-3839-8 |page=17 |chapter=Human Awareness of Mortality and the Evolution of Culture |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/?id=TW4cVuyEnFAC&amp;pg=PA17 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics regard the SSSM as a [[rhetorical device]] or a [[straw man]]&lt;ref name=Levy&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Levy |first1=Neil |year=2004 |title=Evolutionary Psychology, Human Universals, and the Standard Social Science Model |journal=[[Biology and Philosophy]] |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=459–72 |publisher=[[Kluwer Academic Publishers]] |doi=10.1023/B:BIPH.0000036111.64561.63 |citeseerx=10.1.1.90.9290 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Richardson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sampson |first1=Geoffrey |authorlink1=Geoffrey Sampson |authorlink2=|editor1-link=|others=|title=The "Language Instinct" Debate: Revised Edition |url=https://books.google.com/?id=N0zJNPuXTZMC&amp;pg=PA134 |edition=|year=2009 |publisher=Continuum |location=London |isbn=978-0-8264-7384-4 |pages=134–45 |chapter=|chapterurl=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and suggest that the scientists whom evolutionary psychologists associate with the SSSM did not believe that the mind was a blank state devoid of any natural predispositions.&lt;ref name=Levy/&gt;

===Reductionism and determinism===
Some critics view evolutionary psychology as a form of genetic [[Reductionism#Reductionism and science|reductionism]] and [[genetic determinism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Maiers |first1=Wolfgang |authorlink1=|authorlink2=|editor1-first=Niamh |editor1-last=Stephenson |editor1-link=|others=|title=Theoretical Psychology: Critical Contributions |url=|edition=|year=2003 |publisher=Captus University Publications |location=Concord, Ont. |isbn=978-1-55322-055-8 |pages=426–35 |chapter=The Bogus Claim of Evolutionary Psychology |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/?id=uA5VIXQmYQUC&amp;pg=PA426 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Plotkin-Henry-p.150&gt;Plotkin, Henry. 2004 Evolutionary thought in Psychology: A Brief History. Blackwell. p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; a common critique being that evolutionary psychology does not address the complexity of individual development and experience and fails to explain the influence of genes on behavior in individual cases.&lt;ref name=instinct/&gt; Evolutionary psychologists respond that they are working within a nature-nurture interactionist framework that acknowledges that many psychological adaptations are facultative (sensitive to environmental variations during individual development). The discipline is generally not focused on proximate analyses of behavior, but rather its focus is on the study of distal/ultimate causality (the evolution of psychological adaptations). The field of behavioral genetics is focused on the study of the proximate influence of genes on behavior.&lt;ref name=AmPs2010/&gt;

===Testability of hypotheses===
{{See also|Just-so story}}

A frequent critique of the discipline is that the hypotheses of evolutionary psychology are frequently arbitrary and difficult or impossible to adequately test, thus questioning its status as an actual scientific discipline, for example because many current traits probably evolved to serve different functions than they do now.&lt;ref name=Psychology/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ryle |first1=Anthony |year=2005 |title=The Relevance of Evolutionary Psychology for Psychotherapy |journal=British Journal of Psychotherapy |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=375–88 |publisher=|doi=10.1111/j.1752-0118.2005.tb00225.x |url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While evolutionary psychology hypotheses are difficult to test, evolutionary psychologists assert that it is not impossible.&lt;ref name=Buss-Haselton-2007-pp.26-7&gt;"Testing ideas about the evolutionary origins of psychological phenomena is indeed a challenging task, but not an impossible one" (Buss et al. 1998; Pinker, 1997b).&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the critique of the scientific base of evolutionary psychology includes a critique of the concept of the Environment of Evolutionary Adaptation. Some critics have argued that researchers know so little about the environment in which ''Homo sapiens'' evolved that explaining specific traits as an adaption to that environment becomes highly speculative.&lt;ref name=Plotkin-Henry-p.149&gt;Plotkin, Henry. 2004 Evolutionary thought in Psychology: A Brief History. Blackwell. p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary psychologists respond that they do know many things about this environment, including the facts that present day humans' ancestors were hunter-gatherers, that they generally lived in small tribes, etc.&lt;ref&gt;The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology (2005), David M. Buss, Chapter 1, pp. 5–67, Conceptual Foundations of Evolutionary Psychology, John Tooby and Leda Cosmides&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modularity of mind===
{{Main article|Modularity of mind}}
Evolutionary psychologists generally presume that, like the body, the mind is made up of many evolved modular adaptations,&lt;ref name=Kurzban-R-2011&gt;{{cite book |last=Kurzban |first=Robert |year=2011 |title=Why Everyone (Else) Is a Hypocrite: Evolution and the Modular Mind |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=NJ |isbn=9780691146744}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there is some disagreement within the discipline regarding the degree of general plasticity, or "generality," of some modules.&lt;ref name=AmPs2010&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Confer | first1 = J.

In contrast, some academics argue that it is unnecessary to posit the existence of highly domain specific modules, and, suggest that the neural anatomy of the brain supports a model based on more domain general faculties and processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Panksepp |first1=Jaak |last2=Panksepp |first2=Jules B. |year=2000 |title=The Seven Sins of Evolutionary Psychology|journal=Evolution and Cognition |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=108–31 |url=http://www.flyfishingdevon.co.uk/salmon/year3/psy364-intro-psychobiology/panksepp_seven_sins.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=15 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Buller |first1=David J. |authorlink1=|last2=Hardcastle |first2=Valerie Gray |authorlink2=|editor1-first=David J. |editor1-last=Buller |editor1-link=|others=|title=Adapting Minds: Evolutionary Psychology And The Persistent Quest For Human Nature |url=|year=2005 |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-262-02579-9 |pages=127–201 |chapter=Modularity |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/?id=dQ5MGDvn8eIC&amp;pg=PA127 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, empirical support for the domain-specific theory stems almost entirely from performance on variations of the [[Wason selection task]] which is extremely limited in scope as it only tests one subtype of deductive reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Davies |first1=Paul Sheldon |last2=Fetzer |first2=James H. |last3=Foster |first3=Thomas R. |year=1995 |title=Logical reasoning and domain specificity |journal=[[Biology and Philosophy]] |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=1–37 |publisher=|doi=10.1007/BF00851985 |url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=O'Brien |first1=David |authorlink1=|last2=Manfrinati |first2=Angela |authorlink2=|editor1-first=Mike |editor1-last=Oaksford |editor1-link=|editor2-last=Chater |editor2-first=Nick |title=Cognition and Conditionals: Probability and Logic in Human Thinking |url=|year=2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-923329-8 |pages=39–54 |chapter=The Mental Logic Theory of Conditional Propositions |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/?id=iQSDOqAvXIoC&amp;pg=PA47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural rather than genetic development of cognitive tools===
[[Cecilia Heyes]] argues that the picture presented by some evolutionary psychology of the human mind as a collection of cognitive instincts - organs of thought shaped by genetic evolution over very long time periods&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cep.ucsb.edu/primer.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cognitionandculture.net"/&gt; - does not fit research results. She posits instead that humans have cognitive gadgets&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cognitive-Gadgets-Cecilia-Heyes/dp/0674980158&lt;/ref&gt; - 'special-purpose organs of thought' built in the course of development through social interaction. These are products of cultural rather than genetic evolution,&lt;ref&gt;https://philosophy.sas.ac.uk/events/chandaria-lecture-series&lt;/ref&gt; and may develop and change much more quickly and flexibly than cognitive instincts.

===Evolutionary psychology defense===

{{short description|A branch of statistics focusing on spatial data sets}}
{{more footnotes|date=January 2009}}

'''Geostatistics''' is a branch of [[statistics]] focusing on spatial or [[Spacetime|spatiotemporal]] [[dataset]]s. Developed originally to predict [[probability distribution]]s of [[ore grade]]s for [[mining]] operations,&lt;ref&gt;Krige, Danie G. (1951). "A statistical approach to some basic mine valuation problems on the Witwatersrand". J. of the Chem., Metal. and Mining Soc. of South Africa 52 (6): 119–139&lt;/ref&gt; it is currently applied in diverse disciplines including [[petroleum geology]], [[hydrogeology]], [[hydrology]], [[meteorology]], [[oceanography]], [[geochemistry]], [[geometallurgy]], [[geography]], [[forestry]], [[environmental control]], [[landscape ecology]], [[soil science]], and [[agriculture]] (esp. in [[precision farming]]). Geostatistics is applied in varied branches of [[geography]], particularly those involving the spread of diseases ([[epidemiology]]), the practice of commerce and military planning ([[logistics]]), and the development of efficient [[spatial network]]s. Geostatistical algorithms are incorporated in many places, including [[geographic information systems]] (GIS) and the [[R (programming language)|R statistical environment]].&lt;ref&gt;Hemakumara, GPTS, &amp; Rainis, Ruslan. (2015). Geo-statistical modeling to evaluate the socio-economic impacts of households in the context of low-lying areas conversion in Colombo metropolitan region-Sri Lanka. Paper presented at the AIP Conference Proceedings.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Geostatistics is intimately related to interpolation methods, but extends far beyond simple interpolation problems. Geostatistical techniques rely on statistical models that are based on random function (or [[random variable]]) theory to model the uncertainty associated with spatial estimation and simulation.

A number of simpler interpolation methods/algorithms, such as [[inverse distance weighting]], [[bilinear interpolation]] and [[nearest-neighbor interpolation]], were already well known before geostatistics.&lt;ref name="IandS1989"&gt;Isaaks, E. H. and Srivastava, R. M. (1989), ''An Introduction to Applied Geostatistics,'' Oxford University Press, New York, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; Geostatistics goes beyond the interpolation problem by considering the studied phenomenon at unknown locations as a set of correlated random variables.

Let {{math|''Z''('''x''')}} be the value of the variable of interest at a certain location {{math|'''x'''}}. This value is unknown (e.g. temperature, rainfall, [[Potentiometric surface|piezometric level]], geological facies, etc.). Although there exists a value at location {{math|'''x'''}} that could be measured, geostatistics considers this value as random since it was not measured, or has not been measured yet. However, the randomness of {{math|''Z''('''x''')}} is not complete, but defined by a [[cumulative distribution function]] (CDF) that depends on certain information that is known about the value {{math|''Z''('''x''')}}:

:&lt;math&gt;F(\mathit{z}, \mathbf{x}) = \operatorname{Prob} \lbrace Z(\mathbf{x}) \leqslant \mathit{z} \mid \text{information} \rbrace . &lt;/math&gt;

Typically, if the value of {{math|''Z''}} is known at locations close to {{math|'''x'''}} (or in the [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]] of {{math|'''x'''}}) one can constrain the CDF of {{math|''Z''('''x''')}} by this neighborhood: if a high spatial continuity is assumed, {{math|''Z''('''x''')}} can only have values similar to the ones found in the neighborhood. Conversely, in the absence of spatial continuity {{math|''Z''('''x''')}} can take any value. The spatial continuity of the random variables is described by a model of spatial continuity that can be either a parametric function in the case of [[variogram]]-based geostatistics, or have a non-parametric form when using other methods  such as [[multiple-point simulation]]&lt;ref&gt;Mariethoz, Gregoire, Caers, Jef (2014). Multiple-point geostatistics: modeling with training images.  Wiley-Blackwell, Chichester, UK, 364 p.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[pseudo-genetic]] techniques.

By applying a single spatial model on an entire domain, one makes the assumption that {{math|''Z''}} is a [[stationary process]]. It means that the same statistical properties are applicable on the entire domain. Several geostatistical methods provide ways of relaxing this stationarity assumption.

In this framework, one can distinguish two modeling goals:

# [[Estimation theory|Estimating]] the value for {{math|''Z''('''x''')}}, typically by the [[Expected value|expectation]], the [[median]] or the [[Mode (statistics)|mode]] of the CDF {{math|''f''(''z'','''x''')}}. This is usually denoted as an estimation problem.
# [[Sampling (statistics)|Sampling]] from the entire probability density function {{math|''f''(''z'','''x''')}} by actually considering each possible outcome of it at each location. This is generally done by creating several alternative maps of {{math|''Z''}}, called realizations. Consider a domain discretized in {{math|''N''}} grid nodes (or pixels). Each realization is a sample of the complete {{math|''N''}}-dimensional joint distribution function

:: &lt;math&gt;F(\mathbf{z}, \mathbf{x}) = \operatorname{Prob} \lbrace Z(\mathbf{x}_1) \leqslant z_1, Z(\mathbf{x}_2) \leqslant z_2, ..., Z(\mathbf{x}_N) \leqslant z_N \rbrace .&lt;/math&gt;

: In this approach, the presence of multiple solutions to the interpolation problem is acknowledged. Each realization is considered as a possible scenario of what the real variable could be. All associated workflows are then considering ensemble of realizations, and consequently ensemble of predictions that allow for probabilistic forecasting. Therefore, geostatistics is often used to generate or update spatial models when solving [[inverse problem]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, T.M., Journel, A.G., Tarantola, A. and Mosegaard, K. (2006). "Linear inverse Gaussian theory and geostatistics", ''Geophysics'' 71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kitanidis, P.K. and Vomvoris, E.G. (1983). "A geostatistical approach to the inverse problem in groundwater modeling (steady state) and one-dimensional simulations", ''Water Resources Research'' 19(3):677-690&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of methods exist for both geostatistical estimation and multiple realizations approaches. Several reference books provide a comprehensive overview of the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Remy, N., et al.

==Methods==

===Estimation===

==== Kriging ====
{{Main|Kriging}}
Kriging is a group of geostatistical techniques to interpolate the value of a random field (e.g., the elevation, z, of the landscape as a function of the geographic location) at an unobserved location from observations of its value at nearby locations.

==== Indicator kriging ====
{{main|Multiple-indicator kriging}}
Multiple-indicator kriging (MIK) is a recent advance on other techniques for mineral deposit modeling and resource block model estimation, such as ordinary kriging. Initially, MIK showed considerable promise as a new method that could more accurately estimate overall global mineral deposit concentrations or grades.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4890">This is a glossary of levelling terms. Levelling is a surveying method used to find relative height, one use of which is to ensure ground is level during construction, for example, when excavating to prepare for laying a foundation for a house.

== Levelling terms ==

* [[Automatic level]] &amp;ndash; variant of the dumpy level, that makes use of a compensator that ensures that the line of sight remains horizontal once the operator has roughly leveled the instrument. The surveyor sets the instrument up quickly and doesn't have to relevel it carefully each time he sights on a rod on another point. It also reduces the effect of minor settling of the tripod. Three adjustment screws are used to level the instrument.
{{anchor|Back sight}} &lt;!-- redirects lead to this anchor, please do not remove. --&gt;
* [[Back sight]] (BS) – short for "back sight reading", the first staff reading taken by the surveyor after the levelling instrument is set up and levelled. B.S is generally taken on the point of known reduced level as on the benchmark or a change point.&lt;ref&gt;Surveying Volume 1 by Prof. C.L Kochher. Retrieved on 27 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Benchmark (surveying)]] – fixed reference point of known elevation with respect to which RL of other points is determined. Benchmarks can be arbitrary or permanent, the former is used for calculation of reduced levels for small survey works and the latter is used to calculate the elevations of significantly important locations and points. Arbitrary benchmarks are assumed to be equal to 100 meters generally and then the elevations with respect to assumed benchmark is determined. It is commonly practiced by engineering students. For GTS surveys of the country, surveyors use permanent benchmarks to calculate the elevations of different points.&lt;ref&gt;Surveying Volume 1 by Prof C.L Kochher. Retrieved on 28 October 2014. Page no. 218&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Datum surface]] – reference plane with respect to which RL of the other survey points is determined. The datum surface may be real or imaginary location with a nominated elevation of zero.  The commonly used datum is mean sea level.&lt;ref&gt;Surveying Volume 1 by Dr. B.C Punmia and Ashok Kumar Jain. Retrieved on 27 October 2014 &lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Dumpy level]] &amp;ndash; optical instrument used to establish or check points in the same horizontal plane. It is used in surveying and building with a vertical staff to measure height differences and to transfer, measure and set heights. Also called a builder's level or leveling instrument.
{{anchor|Fore sight}} &lt;!-- redirects lead to this anchor, please do not remove. --&gt;
* [[Fore sight (surveying)|Fore sight]] (FS) – short for "fore sight reading", the last staff reading taken before changing the instrument to the other position. It is the staff reading taken on point whose RL is to determined. This sight is considered as negative and deduced from Height of Instrument to determine RL of the point.
{{anchor|Intermediate sight}} &lt;!-- redirects lead to this anchor, please do not remove. --&gt;
* [[Intermediate sight]]s – all readings taken between back sight and fore sight. These are the points whose RL is determined by the method already mentioned above in FS. Also called inter-sight readings.
* [[Laser level]] &amp;ndash; control tool consisting of a laser beam projector that can be affixed to a tripod, and which projects a fixed red or green beam along the horizontal and/or vertical axis. A rotary laser level is a more advanced laser level in that it spins the beam of light fast enough to give the effect of a complete 360 degree horizontal or vertical plane, thus illuminating not just a fixed line, but a horizontal plane.
* [[Levelling]] – measurement of geodetic height using an optical levelling instrument and a level staff or rod having a numbered scale. Common levelling instruments include the spirit level, the dumpy level, the digital level, and the laser level.
* [[Levelling staff]] &amp;ndash; specialized measuring stick or vertical staff used with the dumpy level, held by a second person while the operator of the level looks through it and takes readings off of the staff. Also call a rod.
* [[Reduced level]] (RL) –  equating elevations of survey points with reference to a common assumed datum. The elevation is positive or negative according as point lies above or below datum.
* [[Spirit level]] &amp;ndash; instrument designed to indicate whether a surface is horizontal (level) or vertical (plumb). While used by surveyors, different types of spirit levels may be used by carpenters, stonemasons, bricklayers, other building trades workers, millwrights and other metalworkers, and in some photographic or videographic work.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="567">In [[telecommunication]]s, a '''hybrid balance''' is an expression of the degree of electrical symmetry between two [[impedance matching|impedances]] connected to two conjugate sides of a [[hybrid coil]] or [[resistance hybrid]]. It is usually expressed in [[decibel|dB]]. 

If the respective impedances of the branches of the hybrid that are connected to the conjugate sides of the hybrid are known, hybrid balance may be computed by the formula for [[return loss]].

'''IEEE Std 854-1987''', the ''Standard for Radix-Independent Floating-Point Arithmetic'', was the first [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) [[international standard|standard]] for [[floating-point arithmetic]] with [[radix]] 2 or radix 10 (not more general than that, despite the title).

The standard was published in 1987, nearly immediately superseded by [[IEEE 754-1985]] but never terminated (the year of ratification appears after the dash).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= 854-1987: IEEE Standard for Radix-Independent Floating-Point Arithmetic |year= 1987 |isbn= 0-7381-1167-8 |publisher= IEEE Standards Association |doi= 10.1109/IEEESTD.1987.81037 }}&lt;/ref&gt; IEEE 854 did not specify any formats, whereas IEEE 754-1985 did. IEEE 754 specifies floating-point arithmetic for both radix 2 ([[binary numeral system|binary]]) and radix 10 ([[decimal]]), including specifying two alternative formats for radix 10 floating-point values. IEEE 754-1985 was only superseded in 2008 by [[IEEE 754-2008]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= IEEE 754: Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic |work= Working group web site |url= http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/754/ |accessdate=21 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; IEEE 754-2008 also has many other updates to the IEEE floating point standardisation.

'''iSBEM''' is a free-cost proprietary [[Graphical user interface|software interface]] to the Simplified Building Energy Model (SBEM) which is designed for the purpose of indicating compliance with [[United Kingdom|UK]] building regulations part L2a and L2b in [[England]] and section 6 in [[Scotland]] as regards [[carbon emission]]s from non domestic buildings. The latest version at time of writing is V 5.4.b &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncm.bre.co.uk/newsdetails.jsp?id=50&lt;/ref&gt; which is available as a download from the EPBD NCM website.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncm.bre.co.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;

It has recently undergone additional programming to allow it to be used to produce EPCs for Non-Domestic Buildings.
{{See also|Building regulations in the United Kingdom}}

Several commercial software tools exist, offering a more 'user-friendly' front-end to the SBEM calculation engine than iSBEM.
 
The SBEM calculation engine has some limitations and is explicitly distributed 'Not a Design Tool'. For more complex buildings, accredited Dynamic Simulation Modelling tools should be used for Part L compliance and EPCs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5732">'''Indexing''' in reference to motion is moving (or being moved) into a new position or location quickly and easily but also precisely. When indexing a machine part, its new location is known to within a few hundredths of a millimeter (thousandths of an inch), or often even to within a few thousandths of a millimeter (ten-thousandths of an inch), despite the fact that no elaborate measuring or layout was needed to establish that location. In reference to multi-edge [[Cutting tool (machining)#Cutting tools with inserts (indexable tools)|cutting inserts]], indexing is the process of exposing a new cutting edge for use. Indexing is a necessary kind of motion in many areas of [[mechanical engineering]] and [[machining]]. A object that '''indexes''', or can be '''indexed''', is said to be '''indexable'''.

Usually when the word ''indexing'' is used, it refers specifically to [[rotation]]. That is, indexing is most often the quick and easy but precise rotation of a machine part through a certain known number of [[Degree (angle)|degrees]]. For example, ''[[Machinery's Handbook]]'', 25th edition, in its section on milling machine indexing,{{sfnp|Machinery's Handbook|1996|pp=1873–1916}} says, "Positioning a workpiece at a precise angle or interval of rotation for a machining operation is called indexing."{{sfnp|Machinery's Handbook|1996|p=1873}} In addition to that most classic sense of the word, the swapping of one part for another, or other controlled movements, are also sometimes referred to as ''indexing'', even if rotation is not the focus.

== Examples from everyday life ==

There are various examples of indexing that laypersons (non-engineers and non-machinists) can find in everyday life. These motions are not always called by the name ''indexing'', but the idea is essentially similar:
* The motion of pins inside a [[pin tumbler lock]], which the correct key can move quickly and easily but also rather precisely into [[:File:Pin tumbler with key.svg|the correct position]] to allow the lock's cylinder to turn
* Indexable driver bits for [[screwdriver]]s
* The motion of a retractable [[utility knife]] blade, which often will have well-defined discrete positions (fully retracted, ¼-exposed, ½-exposed, ¾-exposed, fully exposed)
* The indexing of a [[revolver]]'s [[Cylinder (firearms)|cylinder]] with each shot

== Manufacturing applications==

Indexing is vital in [[manufacturing]], especially [[mass production]], where a well-defined cycle of motions must be repeated quickly and easily—but precisely—for each [[interchangeable parts|interchangeable part]] that is made. Without indexing capability, all manufacturing would have to be done on a craft basis, and interchangeable parts would have very high [[unit cost]] because of the time and skill needed to produce each unit. In fact, the evolution of modern technologies depended on the shift in methods from crafts (in which toolpath is controlled via operator skill) to indexing-capable toolpath control. A prime example of this theme was the development of the [[turret lathe]], whose turret indexes tool positions, one after another, to allow successive tools to move into place, take precisely placed cuts, then make way for the next tool. 

=== How indexing is achieved in manufacturing ===

Indexing capability is provided in two fundamental ways: with or without [[Information technology]] (IT).

==== Non-IT-assisted physical guidance ====

Non-IT-assisted physical guidance was the first means of providing indexing capability, via purely mechanical means. It allowed the [[Industrial Revolution]] to progress into the [[Machine Age]]. It is achieved by [[Jig (tool)|jigs]], [[Fixture (tool)|fixtures]], and machine tool parts and accessories, which control toolpath by the very nature of their shape, physically limiting the path for motion. Some archetypal examples, developed to perfection before the advent of the IT era, are [[wikt:drill jig|drill jigs]], the turrets on manual [[turret lathe]]s, [[indexing head]]s for manual [[milling machine]]s, [[rotary table]]s, and various indexing fixtures and blocks that are simpler and less expensive than indexing heads, and serve quite well for most indexing needs in small shops.&lt;ref name=""&gt;{{Harvnb|Bulgin|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although indexing heads of the pre-CNC era are now mostly obsolete in commercial manufacturing, the principle of purely mechanical indexing is still a vital part of current technology, in concert with IT, even as it has been extended to newer uses, such as the indexing of CNC milling machine toolholders or of indexable cutter inserts, whose precisely controlled size and shape allows them to be rotated or replaced quickly and easily without changing overall tool geometry.

==== IT-assisted physical guidance ====

IT-assisted physical guidance (for example, via [[Numerical control|NC]], [[CNC]], or [[robotics]]) has been developed since the [[World War II]] era and uses electromechanical and electrohydraulic [[servomechanism]]s to translate digital information into position control. These systems also ultimately physically limit the path for motion, as jigs and other purely mechanical means do; but they do it not simply through their own shape, but rather using changeable information.

'''Roofing material''' is the outermost layer on the [[roof]] of a building, sometimes self-supporting, but generally supported by an underlying structure. A building's roofing material provides shelter from the natural elements. The outer layer of a roof shows great variation dependent upon availability of material, and the nature of the supporting structure. Those types of roofing material which are commercially available range from natural products such as [[thatch]] and [[slate]] to commercially produced products such as [[tiles]] and [[polycarbonate]] sheeting. Roofing materials may be placed on top of a secondary water-resistant material called underlayment.

==Materials==
The weatherproofing material is the topmost or outermost layer exposed to the weather.  Many materials have been used as weatherproofing material:
* [[Thatch]] is roofing made of plant stalks in overlapping layers
** [[Wheat]] [[straw]], widely used in England, France, and other parts of Europe
**[[Seagrass]], used in coastal areas where there are [[estuary|estuaries]] such as Scotland. Has a longer life than straw. Claimed to have a life in excess of 60 years.
** [[Rye]] straw, commonly used in a barn.
** Raffia palm leaves:A well organised raffia palm leaves is mainly used as roof houses in Nigeria, especially among the Igbos.
** [[Rice]] straw, commonly used in Eastern Asia.
** Water reed, commonly used in Ireland for [[Thatching]].
* [[Roof shingle|Shingle]] is the generic term for a roofing material that is in many overlapping sections, 
** [[Wood shingle]], shingles sawn from bolts of wood such as [[Thuja plicata|red cedar]] which has a useful performance life expectancy of up to 30 years. However, young growth red cedar has a short life expectancy and high cost. In the United States and Canada, eastern [[Thuja occidentalis|white cedar]] is also used. Some [[hardwood]]s were very durable roofing found in Colonial [[Australian architecture|Australian]] and [[American colonial architecture]]; their use is now usually limited to [[building restoration]]. All wood shingles benefit by being allowed to breathe (dry out from below).
** [[Shake (shingle)]], Are different than wood shingles in that they are split on one side and sawed on the back side. Commonly referred to as "resawn Shakes". A cedar shake is NOT the same as a cedar shingle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Grading and Manufacturing {{!}} Products {{!}} Cedar Shake and Shingle Bureau|url = http://www.cedarbureau.org/frequently-asked-questions/product/grading-and-manufacturing.asp|website = www.cedarbureau.org|accessdate = 2015-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Slate]]. High cost with a life expectancy of 80 to 400 years. See the article [[slate industry]] for an overview including names of quarries. Some of the famous quarries where the highest quality slate comes from that are available in Australia are Bethesda in Wales and areas of Spain.
** [[Asphalt shingle]] made of bitumen embedded in an organic or fiberglass mat, usually covered with colored, man-made ceramic grit. Cheaper than slate or tiles. The reduced cost of this particular style of roofing is especially apparent in its application and removal. Installation is very streamlined and a rapid process. Depending on the size of the roof and the experience of the crew, it is possible to remove old shingles and apply new ones on 2-3 houses in one day. Life span varies. Use only on slanted roofs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roofing Requirements One- and Two- Family Dwellings|url=http://roofingroger.com/roofing-requirements-one-and-two-family-dwellings/|publisher=Regulatory Services Department|accessdate=29 August 2015|quote=Asphalt-based organic and fiberglass shingles may only be used on roofs with slopes of 2:12 and greater.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Rubber shingle, alternative to asphalt shingle, slate, shake or tile. Made primarily of rubber, often recycled tire-derived rubber. Other typical ingredients include binders, UV (ultraviolet light) inhibitors and color. Warranted and designed to last at least 50 years in most cases.
** [[Asbestos]] shingles. Very long lifespan, fireproof, and low cost but now rarely used because of health concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/BHCV2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Asbestos_and_your_health?open | title=Asbestos and your health | publisher=[[State Government of Victoria]] | work=Better Health Channel | date=September 2011 | accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Stone slab. Heavy stone slabs (not to be confused with slate) 1–2 inches thick were formerly used as roofing tiles in some regions in England, the [[Alps]], and [[Scandinavia]]. Stone slabs require a very heavyweight roof structure, but their weight makes them stormproof. An obsolete roofing material, now used commercially only for building restoration.
*** [[Collyweston stone slate]]
** [[Solar shingle]]
** Metal shakes or shingles. Long life. High cost, suitable for roofs of 3:12 pitch or greater. Because of the flexibility of metal, they can be manufactured to lock together, giving durability and reducing assembly time. For a discussion of copper system shingles, see [[Copper in architecture#Wall cladding]].
* Ceramic [[tile#Roof tiles|tile]]. High cost, life of more than 100 years.
** [[Imbrex and tegula]], style dating back to ancient Greece and Rome.
** [[Monk and Nun]], a style similar to Imbrex and tegula, but basically using two Imbrex tiles.
** [[Dutch roof tiles]], Netherlands
** [[Mangalore tiles]], India
* [[Membrane roofing]]. Membrane roofing is in large sheets, generally fused in some way at the joints to form a continuous surface.
** [[Thermoset membrane]] (e.g. [[EPDM rubber]]). [[Synthetic rubber]] sheets adhered together with contact adhesive or tape. Primary application is big box stores with large open areas.
** [[Thermoplastic]]s (e.g. [[polyvinyl chloride|PVC]], [[ThermoPlastic Olefin|TPO]], [[Hypalon|CSPE]]) – Plastic sheets welded together with hot air, creating one continuous sheet membrane. They can be re-welded with the exception of CSPE. Lends itself well to both big box and small roof application because of its hot air weldability. This membrane is installed by two methods: 1.) Rolls of membrane are attached to the ridged insulation using a bonding adhesive; 2.) The edge of each roll is fastened through ridged insulation into structural deck, and the proceeding roll is lapped over the fasteners.  The overlap is then heat-welded with hot air to create a mechanically fastened thermoplastic roof. PVC is also known as IB.[[Vinyl roof membrane]].
** [[Liquid roofing]]
** [[Asphalt roll roofing]] including single and double coverage types.
** [[Bituminous waterproofing]] is a general term for:
*** Modified [[bitumen]] – heat-welded, asphalt-adhered, or installed with adhesive. Asphalt is mixed with polymers such as APP or SBS, then applied to fiberglass and/or polyester mat, seams sealed by locally melting the asphalt with heat, hot mopping of asphalt, or adhesive.  Lends itself well to most applications.
*** Built-up roof – Multiple plies of salt-saturated organic felt or coated fiberglass felts. Plies of felt are adhered with hot asphalt, coal tar pitch, or adhesive.  Although the roof membrane can be left bare, it is typically covered with a thick coat of the waterproofing material and covered with gravel.  The gravel provides protection from ultra-violet degradation, stabilizes the temperature changes, protects surface of the roof, and increases the weight of the roof system to resist wind blow-off.
**[[Textile|Fabric]]
** [[polyester]].
** [[PTFE]], (synthetic fluoropolymer) embedded in [[fibreglass]].
* [[Metal roof]]ing.
** [[Corrugated galvanised iron]] is [[Hot-dip galvanizing|Galvanised steel]] manufactured with wavy corrugations to resist lateral flexing and fitted with exposed fasteners. Widely used for low cost and durability. Sheds are normally roofed with this material. ''Gal iron'' or ''Corro'' was the most extensively used roofing material of 20th century Australia, now replaced in popularity by steel with longer-lasting, coloured, alloy coatings.
** [[Copper in architecture#Roofing|Copper roofs]] can last for hundreds of years. Copper roofing offers durability, ease of fabrication, lighter weight than some other roofing materials, can be curved, low maintenance, corrosion resistance, low thermal movement, lightning protection, radio frequency shielding, and are 100% recyclable. Copper roofs have a high initial cost but very long lifetime: tests on European copper roofs from the 18th Century showed that, in theory, copper roofs can last one thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;The glory of copper; ''Metal Roofing Magazine,'' December 2002/January 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Another advantage of copper roofing systems is that they are relatively easy to repair.
** Standing-seam metal with concealed fasteners.
** Mechanically seamed metal with concealed fasteners contains sealant in seams for use on very low sloped roofs, suitable for roofs of low pitch such as 0.5/12 to 3/12 pitch.
** Flat-seam metal with or without soldered seams.
** [[Steel]] coated with a coloured [[alloy]] of [[zinc]] and [[aluminium]].
** [[Stone-coated metal roofing]].
* [[Concrete]] or [[fibre cement]], usually reinforced with fibres of some sort.
** may also be in the form of concrete tiles.
* Structural concrete can also be used for flat roof constructions. There are three main categories, [[Prestressed concrete|precast/prestressed]], cast-in-place and [[Concrete shell|shell]]. There are many types of precast/prestressed concrete roofing. The following are the most common types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Concrete Roof Systems Part 1: Precast/Prestressed Constructions |url=http://www.concreteconstruction.net/Images/Concrete%20Roof%20Systems%20Part%20I_%20Precast_Prestressed%20Construction_tcm45-348518.pdf |accessdate=26 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526171509/http://www.concreteconstruction.net/Images/Concrete%20Roof%20Systems%20Part%20I_%20Precast_Prestressed%20Construction_tcm45-348518.pdf |archivedate=26 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Double tee]]s are the most common products for short spans up to {{Convert|60|ft}}
** [[Hollow-core slab]]s are used when there is a need for flushed ceiling.
** [[T-beam]]s are similar to double tees but can be used for span ranging from {{Convert|30|ft}} to {{Convert|100|ft}}.
** [[Joist]]s and [[Concrete slab|planks]] are combination of using prestressed joists with prestressed planks. [[Keystone (architecture)|Keystone]]-shape joists can be used for up to {{Convert|36|ft|adj=on}} spans and tee-shape joists can be used for up to {{Convert|60|ft|adj=on}} span.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3586">A '''Malament–Hogarth (M-H) spacetime''', named after [[David B. Malament]] and [[Mark Hogarth]], is a [[theory of relativity|relativistic]] [[spacetime]] that possesses the following property: there exists a [[worldline]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and an event ''p'' such that all events along &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; are a finite interval in the past of ''p'', but the [[proper time]] along &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is infinite. The event ''p'' is known as an M-H event. The significance of M-H spacetimes is that they allow for the implementation of certain non-Turing computable tasks ([[hypercomputation]]). The idea is for an observer at some event in ''p''&lt;nowiki&gt;'s&lt;/nowiki&gt; past to set a computer (Turing machine) to work on some task and then have the [[Turing machine]] travel on &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, computing for all eternity. Since &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; lies in ''p''&lt;nowiki&gt;'s&lt;/nowiki&gt; past, the Turing machine can signal (a solution) to ''p'' at any stage of this never-ending task. Meanwhile, the observer takes a quick trip (finite proper time) through spacetime to ''p'', to pick up the solution. The set-up can be used to decide the [[halting problem]], which is known to be undecidable by an ordinary Turing machine. All the observer needs to do is to prime the Turing machine to signal to ''p'' if and only if the Turing machine halts.

The [[Kerr metric]], which describes empty spacetime around a rotating [[black hole]], possesses these features: a computer can orbit the black hole indefinitely, while an observer falling into the black hole experiences an M-H event as they cross the inner [[event horizon]]. (This, however, neglects the effects of [[Hawking radiation|black hole evaporation]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=G. Etesi and I.

The '''portrayal of transgender people in the media''' list includes portrayals of [[transgender people]] and many other non-[[cisgender]] identities in the [[mass media]].

==Terminology==
[[Transgender]] (trans) is the state of one's [[gender identity]] or gender expression not matching one's [[Sex assignment|assigned sex]]. Transgender men are people [[Sex assignment|assigned]] female at birth who identify as men. Transgender women are people [[Sex assignment|assigned]] male at birth who identify as women. Some gender nonconforming people do not [[Gender identity|identify]] with either male or female. [[Cisgender]] men and women are individuals whose gender experiences conform to the sex assigned to them at birth.

[[File:Birth Places of Chinese Philosophers.png|300px|thumb|Birth places of notable Chinese philosophers from Hundred Schools of Thought in Zhou Dynasty. Philosophers of Mohism are marked by triangles in blue.]]
'''Mohism''' or '''Moism''' ({{zh|c=墨家|p=Mòjiā|l=School of Mo}}) was an [[History of Science and Technology in China|ancient Chinese philosophy]] of [[logic]], [[rational]] thought and [[science]] developed by the [[academic]] [[scholars]] who studied under the ancient Chinese philosopher [[Mozi]] (c. 470 BC – c. 391 BC) and embodied in an eponymous book: the ''[[Mozi (book)|Mozi]]''. It evolved at about the same time as [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] and [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]], and was one of the four main [[Hundred Schools of Thought|philosophic schools]] from around 770–221 BC (during the [[Spring and Autumn period|Spring and Autumn]] and [[Warring States period|Warring States]] periods). During that time, Mohism was seen as a major rival to Confucianism. Although its influence endured, Mohism all but disappeared as an independent school of thought.

==Overview==
{{seealso|Mozi (book)}}
Mohism is best known for the concepts of "impartial care" ({{zh|c=兼愛 |p=jiān ài |l=inclusive love/care}}). This is often translated and popularized as "Universal Love", which is misleading as Mozi believed that the essential problem of human ethics was an excess of partiality in compassion, not a deficit in compassion as such. His aim was to re-evaluate behaviour, not emotions or attitudes.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;The Shorter Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Edited by Edward Craig. Routledge Publishing. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mohists formed a highly structured political organization that tried to realize the ideas they preached, the writings of Mozi. Like Confucians, they hired out their services not only for gain, but also in order to realize their own ethical ideals. This political structure consisted of a network of local units in all the major kingdoms of China at the time, made up of elements from both the scholarly and working classes. Each unit was led by a ''juzi'' (literally, "chisel"—an image from craft making). Within the unit, a frugal and ascetic lifestyle was enforced. Each ''juzi'' would appoint his own successor. Mohists developed the sciences of [[fortification]]{{clarify|date=January 2016}}&lt;!-- the target article is mostly about a building type, not art --&gt; and statecraft, and wrote treatises on government, ranging in topic from efficient agricultural production to the laws of inheritance. They were often hired by the many warring kingdoms as advisers to the state. In this way, they were similar to the other wandering philosophers and knights-errant of the period.

===Caring and impartiality===
{{See also|Love#Chinese and other Sinic cultures}}
Mohism promotes a philosophy of impartial caring; that is, a person should care equally for all other individuals, regardless of their actual relationship to him or her.&lt;ref name=philosophers/&gt; The expression of this indiscriminate caring is what makes man a righteous being in Mohist thought. This advocacy of impartiality was a target of attack by the other Chinese philosophical schools, most notably the [[Confucian]]s, who believed that while love should be unconditional, it should not be indiscriminate. For example, children should hold a greater love for their parents than for random strangers.

Mozi is known for his insistence that all people are equally deserving of receiving material benefit and being protected from physical harm. In Mohism, morality is defined not by tradition and ritual, but rather by a constant moral guide that parallels [[utilitarianism]]. Tradition varies from culture to culture, and human beings need an extra-traditional guide to identify which traditions are morally acceptable. The moral guide must then promote and encourage social behaviours that maximize the general utility of all the people in that society. 

The concept of ''Ai'' (愛) was developed by the Chinese philosopher Mozi in the 4th century BC in reaction to Confucianism's benevolent love. Mozi tried to replace what he considered to be the long-entrenched Chinese over-attachment to family and clan structures with the concept of "universal love" (jiān'ài, 兼愛). In this, he argued directly against Confucians who believed that it was natural and correct for people to care about different people in different degrees. Mozi, by contrast, believed people in principle should care for all people equally. Mohism stressed that rather than adopting different attitudes towards different people, love should be unconditional and offered to everyone without regard to reciprocation, not just to friends, family and other Confucian relations. Later in [[Chinese Buddhism]], the term ''Ai'' (愛) was adopted to refer to a passionate caring love and was considered a fundamental desire. In Buddhism, ''Ai'' was seen as capable of being either selfish or selfless, the latter being a key element towards enlightenment.

===State consequentialism===
{{Main article|Mohist consequentialism}}

{{quote box|quote=It is the business of the benevolent man to seek to promote what is beneficial to the world and to eliminate what is harmful, and to provide a model for the world. What benefits he will carry out; what does not benefit men he will leave alone.&lt;ref name="Mozi"&gt;{{cite book |author1 = [[Mozi|Mo, Di]] |author2 = [[Xun Kuang|Xun, Kuang]] |author3 = [[Han Fei|Han, Fei]] |editor = [[Burton Watson|Watson, Burton]] |title = Basic Writings of Mo Tzu, Hsün Tzu, and Han Fei Tzu |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TotJdL_zx9YC&amp;pg=PA110 |year=1967 |publisher = Columbia University Press |ISBN =978-0-231-02515-7 |page = 110}}&lt;/ref&gt;|align=right |width=23%}}

Unlike hedonistic utilitarianism, which views pleasure as a moral good, "the basic goods in Mohist consequentialist thinking are... order, material wealth, and increase in population".&lt;ref name="Cambridge"&gt;{{Cite book |title = [[The Cambridge History of Ancient China]] |year = 2011 |last = Loewe |first = Michael |last2 = Shaughnessy |first2 = Edward L. |publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] |ISBN = 978-0-52-147030-8 |page = 761}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Mozi's era, war and famines were common, and population growth was seen as a moral necessity for a harmonious society. The "material wealth" of Mohist consequentialism refers to [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|basic needs]] like shelter and clothing.&lt;ref name="Norden"&gt;{{Cite book |title = Introduction to Classical Chinese Philosophy |year = 2011 |last = Van Norden |first = Bryan W. |publisher = [[Hackett Publishing]] |ISBN = 978-1-60-384468-0 |page = 52}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stanford University|Stanford]] [[sinologist]] [[David S. Nivison|David Shepherd Nivison]], in ''[[The Cambridge History of Ancient China]]'', writes that the moral goods of Mohism "are interrelated: more basic wealth, then more reproduction; more people, then more production and wealth... if people have plenty, they would be good, filial, kind, and so on unproblematically".&lt;ref name="Cambridge" /&gt; In contrast to [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]]'s views, state consequentialism is not utilitarian because it is not hedonistic. The importance of outcomes that are good for the [[State (polity)|state]] outweigh the importance of individual pleasure and pain.

===Society===
Mozi posited that, when society functions as an organized organism, the wastes and inefficiencies found in the natural state (without organization) are reduced.  He believed that conflicts are born from the absence of moral uniformity found in human cultures in the natural state, i.e. the absence of the definition of what is right (是 shì) and what is wrong (非 fēi). According to Mozi, we must therefore choose leaders who will surround themselves with righteous followers, who will then create the hierarchy that harmonizes Shi/Fei. In that sense, the government becomes an authoritative and automated tool. Assuming that the leaders in the social hierarchy are perfectly conformed to the ruler, who is perfectly submissive to Heaven, conformity in speech and behaviour is expected of all people. There is no freedom of speech {{definition|date=November 2011}} in this model. However, the potentially repressive element is countered by compulsory communication between the subjects and their leaders. Subjects are required to report all things good or bad to their rulers. Mohism is opposed to any form of aggression, especially [[war]] between states. It is, however, permissible for a state to use force in legitimate defense.

===Meritocratic government===
{{Main article|Meritocracy}}
Mozi believed that the norm of handing out important government responsibilities to [[Nepotism|one's relatives]] regardless of capabilities, as opposed to those who were best equipped to handle these responsibilities, restricted [[social mobility]]. Mozi taught that as long as a person was qualified for a task, he should keep his position, regardless of blood relations. If an officer were incapable, even if he were a close relative of the ruler, he ought to be demoted, even if it meant poverty.

A ruler should be in close proximity to talented people, treasuring talents and seeking their counsel frequently. Without discovering and understanding talents within the country, the country will be destroyed. History unfortunately saw many people who were murdered, not because of their frailties, but rather because of their strengths. A good bow is difficult to pull, but it shoots high. A good horse is difficult to ride, but it can carry weight and travel far. Talented people are difficult to manage, but they can bring respect to their rulers.

Law and order was an important aspect of Mozi's philosophy. He compared the [[carpenter]], who uses standard tools to do his work, with the ruler, who might not have ''any'' standards by which to rule at all. The carpenter is always better off when depending on his standard tools, rather than on his emotions. Ironically, as his decisions affect the fate of an entire nation, it is even more important that a ruler maintains a set of standards, and yet he has none. These standards cannot originate from man, since no man is perfect; the only standards that a ruler uses have to originate from Heaven, since only Heaven is perfect. That law of Heaven is [[Love]].

In a perfect governmental structure where the ruler loves all people benevolently, and officials are selected according to meritocracy, the people should have unity in belief and in speech. His original purpose in this teaching was to unite people and avoid sectarianism. However, in a situation of corruption and tyranny, this teaching might be misused as a tool for oppression.

Should the ruler be unrighteous, seven disasters would result for that nation. These seven disasters are:
# Neglect of the country's defense, yet there is much lavished on the palace.
# When pressured by foreigners, neighbouring countries are not willing to help.
# The people are engaged in unconstructive work while useless fools are rewarded.
# Law and regulations became too heavy such that there is repressive fear and people only look after their own good.
# The ruler lives in a mistaken illusion of his own ability and his country's strength.
# Trusted people are not loyal while loyal people are not trusted.
# Lack of food. Ministers are not able to carry out their work. Punishment fails to bring fear and reward fails to bring happiness.
A country facing these seven disasters will be destroyed easily by the enemy.

The measure of a country's wealth in Mohism is a matter of sufficient provision and a large population. Thriftiness is believed to be key to this end. With contentment with that which suffices, men will be free from excessive labour, long-term war and poverty from income gap disparity. This will enable birth rate to increase. Mozi also encourages early marriage.

===Supernatural forces===
Rulers of the period often ritually assigned punishments and rewards to their subjects in spiritually important places to garner the attention of these spirits and ensure that justice was done. The respect of these spirits was deemed so important that prehistoric Chinese ancestors had left their instructions on bamboo, plates and stones to ensure the continual obedience of their future descendants to the dictates of heaven. In Mozi's teachings, sacrifices of bulls and rams were mentioned during appointed times during the spring and autumn seasons. Spirits were described to be the preexisting primal spirits of nature, or the souls of humans who had died.

The Mohists polemicized against elaborate [[funeral]] ceremonies and other wasteful rituals, and called for austerity in life and in governance, but did not deem spiritual sacrifices wasteful. Using historical records, Mohists argued that the spirits of innocent men wrongfully murdered had appeared before to enact their vengeance. Spirits had also been recorded to have appeared to carry out other acts of justice. Mohists believed in heaven as a divine force (天 ''[[Tian]]''), the celestial bureaucracy and spirits which knew about the immoral acts of man and punished them, encouraging moral [[righteousness]], and were wary of some of the more atheistic thinkers of the time, such as [[Han Fei]]. Due to the vague nature of the records, there is a possibility that the Mohist scribes themselves may not have been clear about this subject.

===Against fatalism===
Mozi disagrees with the [[Fatalism|fatalistic]] mindset of people, accusing the mindset of bringing about poverty and suffering. To argue against this attitude, Mozi used three criteria (''San Biao'') to assess the correctness of views. These were:&lt;ref name=philosophers&gt;''One hundred Philosophers. A guide to the world's greatest thinkers'' Peter J. King, Polish edition: Elipsa 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
#Assessing them based on history
#Assessing them based on the experiences of common, average people
#Assessing their usefulness by applying them in law or politics&lt;ref name=philosophers/&gt;
In summary, fatalism, the belief that all outcomes are predestined or fated to occur, is an irresponsible belief espoused by those who refuse to acknowledge that their own sinfulness has caused the hardships of their lives. Prosperity or poverty are directly correlated with either virtue or sinfulness, respectively; not fate. Mozi calls fatalism a heresy which needs to be destroyed.

===Against ostentation===
By the time of Mozi, Chinese rulers and the wealthier citizens already had the practice of extravagant burial rituals. Much wealth was buried with the dead, and ritualistic mourning could be as extreme as walking on a stick hunchback for three years in a posture of mourning. During such lengthy funerals, people are not able to attend to agriculture or care for their families, leading to poverty. Mozi spoke against such long and lavish funerals and also argued that this would even create resentment among the living.

Mozi views [[Art|aesthetics]] as nearly useless. Unlike Confucius, he holds a distinctive repulsion to any development in ritual [[music]] and the [[fine arts]]. Mozi takes some whole chapters named "Against Music" (非樂) to discuss this. Though he mentions that he does enjoy and recognize what is pleasant, he sees them of no utilization in terms of governing, or of the benefit of common people. Instead, since development of music involves man's power, it reduces production of food; furthermore, appreciation of music results in less time for administrative works. This overdevelopment eventually results in shortage of food, as well as anarchy. This is because manpower will be diverted from agriculture and other fundamental works towards ostentations. Civilians will eventually imitate the ruler's lusts, making the situation worse. Mozi probably advocated this idea in response to the fact that during the Warring States period, the Zhou king and the aristocrats spent countless time in the development of delicate music while ordinary peasants could hardly meet their subsistence needs. To Mozi, bare necessities are sufficient; resources should be directed to benefit man.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==The Logicians==
One of the schools of Mohism that has received some attention is the [[School of Names|Logicians]] school, which was interested in resolving logical puzzles. Not much survives from the writings of this school, since problems of [[logic]] were deemed trivial by most subsequent Chinese philosophers. Historians such as [[Joseph Needham]] have seen this group as developing a precursor [[philosophy of science]] that was never fully developed, but others{{Who|date=February 2012}} believe that recognizing the Logicians as proto-scientists reveals too much of a modern bias.

==Mathematics==
The Mohist canon of the ''Mo Jing'' described various aspects of many fields associated with physical science, and provided a small wealth of information on [[mathematics]] as well. It provided an 'atomic' definition of the geometric point, stating that a line is separated into parts, and the part which has no remaining parts (i.e. cannot be divided into smaller parts) and thus the extreme end of a line is a point.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Needham|1986}}, 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Much like [[Euclid]]'s first and third definitions and [[Plato]]'s 'beginning of a line', the ''Mo Jing'' stated that "a point may stand at the end (of a line) or at its beginning like a head-presentation in childbirth. (As to its invisibility) there is nothing similar to it."&lt;ref name="needham92"&gt;{{harvnb|Needham|1986}}, 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the [[atomist]]s of [[Democritus]], the ''Mo Jing'' stated that a point is the smallest unit, and cannot be cut in half, since 'nothing' cannot be halved.&lt;ref name="needham92" /&gt; It stated that two lines of equal length will always finish at the same place,&lt;ref name="needham92" /&gt; while providing definitions for the ''comparison of lengths'' and for ''parallels'',&lt;ref name="needham93"&gt;{{harvnb|Needham|1986}}, 93.&lt;/ref&gt; along with principles of space and bounded space.&lt;ref name="needham93" /&gt; It also described the fact that planes without the quality of thickness cannot be piled up since they cannot mutually touch.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Needham|1986}}, 93-94.&lt;/ref&gt; The book provided definitions for circumference, diameter, and radius, along with the definition of volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Needham|1986}}, 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Siege engineers==
One consequence of Mohist understanding of mathematics and the physical sciences, combined with their anti-militarist philosophy and skills as [[artisans]], was that they became the pre-eminent siege-defense engineers during the period prior to the Qin unification of China.  They believed in aiding the defensive warfare of smaller Chinese states against the hostile offensive warfare of larger domineering states.

: Mozi and his disciples worked concertedly and systematically to invent and synthesise measures of benefit to defence, including defensive arms and strategy, and their corresponding logistics and military mobilisation. Many were actually applied, and remained an aspect of military affairs throughout history. The ''Mozi'' is hence highly respected by modern scholars, and ranks as a classic on military matters on a par with Sunzi's ''Art of War,'' the former of defensive strategy, the latter of offensive strategy.[https://academic.oup.com/cjip/article-abstract/2/3/421/540635]

The Mohist beliefs were popular for a time in China, and Mohist followers were employed for their ability as negotiators and as defense engineers. This component of Mohism is dramatized in the story of Gongshu,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ctext.org/mozi/gong-shu | title=公輸 - Gong Shu | website=Chinese Text Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; recorded in the Mohist canon.  Mozi travels 10 days and nights when he hears that Gongshu Pan has built machines for the king of Chu to use in an invasion of the smaller state of Song.  Upon arriving in Chu, Mozi makes a wall out of his belt and sticks to represent machines, and shows Gongshu Pan that he can defend Song against any offensive strategy Chu might use.  Mozi then announces that three hundred of his disciples are already on the walls of Song, ready to defend against Chu. The king cancels the invasion.

==Decline==
With the [[Qin's wars of unification|unification of China]] under the Qin, China was no longer divided into various states constantly fighting each other: where previously the Mohists proved to be an asset when defending a city against an external threat, without wars, and in particular siege wars, there was no more need for their skills. The ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' suggests, in addition to the decline of siege warfare, "... the major factor is probably that as a social and philosophical movement, Mohism gradually collapsed into irrelevance. By the middle of the former Han dynasty, the more appealing aspects of Mohist thought were all shared with rival schools.

Their core ethical doctrines had largely been absorbed into Confucianism, though in a modified and unsystematic form. Key features of their political philosophy were probably shared with most other political thinkers, and their trademark opposition to warfare had been rendered effectively redundant by unification. The philosophy of language, epistemology, metaphysics, and science of the later Mohist Canons were recorded in difficult, dense texts that would have been nearly unintelligible to most readers (and that in any case quickly became corrupt). What remained as distinctively Mohist was a package of harsh, unappealing economic and cultural views, such as their obsession with parsimony and their rejection of music and ritual. Compared with the classical learning and rituals of the Confucians, the speculative metaphysics of Yin-Yang thinkers, and the romantic nature mysticism and literary sophistication of the Daoists, Mohism offered little to attract adherents, especially politically powerful ones."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mohism/|title=Mohism|work=stanford.edu|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern perspectives==
Jin Guantao, a professor of the Institute of Chinese Studies at the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]], Fan Hongye, a research fellow with the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]]' Institute of Science Policy and Managerial Science, and Liu Qingfeng, a professor of the Institute of Chinese Culture at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, have argued that without the influence of proto-scientific precepts in the ancient philosophy of Mohism, Chinese science lacked a definitive structure:&lt;ref name = "jin fan liu 1996 178 179"&gt;Jin, Fan, &amp; Liu (1996), 178–179.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;From the middle and late Eastern Han to the early Wei and Jin dynasties, the net growth of ancient Chinese science and technology experienced a peak (second only to that of the Northern Song dynasty)...  Han studies of the Confucian classics, which for a long time had hindered the socialization of science, were declining. If Mohism, rich in scientific thought, had rapidly grown and strengthened, the situation might have been very favorable to the development of a scientific structure. However, this did not happen because the seeds of the primitive structure of science were never formed. During the late [[Eastern Han]], disastrous upheavals again occurred in the process of social transformation, leading to [[Three Kingdoms period|the greatest social disorder in Chinese history]]. One can imagine the effect of this calamity on science.&lt;ref name="jin fan liu 1996 178 179"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Evidence of parasitism==

One of the most daunting tasks involved in studying parasitic relationships from the past is supporting the assertion that the relationship between two organisms is indeed parasitic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Littlewood | first1 = D.T.J. | last2 = Donovan | first2 = S.K. | year = 2003 | title = Fossil parasites: A case of identity | journal = Geology Today | volume = 19 | issue = 4| pages = 136–142 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-2451.2003.00406.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Organisms living in "close association" with each other may exhibit one of several different types of [[Trophic dynamics|trophic]] relationships, such as [[parasitism]], [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]], and [[commensalism]].  Demonstration of true parasitism between existing species typically involves observing the harmful effects of parasites on a presumed host.  Experimental infection of the presumed host, followed by recovery of [[:wikt:viable|viable]] parasites from that host also supports any claim of true parasitism.  Obviously such experiments are not possible with specimens of extinct organisms found in paleontological contexts.

Assumptions of true parasitism in paleontological settings which are based on analogy to known present-day parasitic relationships may not be valid, due to [[Host (biology)#Host range|host-specificity]].  For example, ''[[Trypanosoma brucei gambiense]]'' and ''[[Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense]]'' are both devastating human parasites, but the related subspecies ''[[Trypanosoma brucei brucei]]'' will infect a number of animal hosts, but cannot even survive in the human blood stream, much less reproduce and infect a human host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pays | first1 = E. | last2 = Vanhollebeke | first2 = B. | year = 2008 | title = Mutual self-defence: The trypanolytic factor story | journal = Microbes and Infection | volume = 10 | issue = 9| pages = 985–989 | doi=10.1016/j.micinf.2008.07.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;  So a related (or unidentifiable) species of ''Trypanosoma'' found in a paleontological or archaeological context may not be a true human parasite, even though it appears identical (or very similar) to the modern parasitic forms.

The most convincing evidence of paleoparasitism is obtained when a presumed parasite is found in direct association with its presumed host, in a context that is consistent with known host-parasite associations.  Some examples include [[helminth]]s caught in amber in the process of escaping from the body of an insect,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Poinar | first1 = G. | last2 = Jr | first2 =  | last3 = Buckley | first3 = R. | year = 2006 | title = Nematode (Nematoda: Mermithidae) and hairworm (Nematomorpha: Chordodidae) parasites in Early Cretaceous amber | journal = Journal of Invertebrate Pathology | volume = 93 | issue = 1| pages = 36–41 | doi=10.1016/j.jip.2006.04.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; lice found in the fur of guinea pig mummies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dittmar | first1 = K | year = 2000 | title = Evaluation of ectoparasites on the guinea pig mummies of El Yaral and Moquegua Valley, in southern Peru | url = http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?pid=S0717-73562000000100020&amp;script=sci_arttext | journal = [[Chungara (journal)|Chungara&amp;nbsp;— Revista de Antropología Chilena]] | volume = 32 | issue = 1| pages = 123–125 | doi=10.4067/s0717-73562000000100020}}&lt;/ref&gt; protozoans in the alimentary canal of flies in amber,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Poinar | first1 = G. | last2 = Jr | first2 =  | last3 = Telford Jr | first3 = S.R. | year = 2005 | title = ''Paleohaemoproteus burmacis'' gen.n., sp.n.

Host-parasite interactions today are often exploited by other species, and similar examples have been found in the fossil record of plant galls and leaf mines.  For example, there are species of wasps, called [[inquilines]], which are unable to induce their own plant galls, so they simply take up residence in the galls that are made by other wasps.&lt;ref name="journals.royalsociety" /&gt; Another example is the [[predation]] of plant galls or leaf mines, to eat the trapped insect larva inside the gall or mine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Krassilov | first1 = V | year = 2008 | title = Mine and gall predation as top-down regulation in the plant-insect systems from the Cretaceous of Negev, Israel | journal = Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology | volume = 261 | issue = 3–4| pages = 261–269 | doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2008.01.017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4652">'''Penguin Composition Rules''' were the guidelines written by typographer [[Jan Tschichold]] for use in composing the pages and typography of [[Penguin Books]]. The rules were embodied in a four-page booklet of typographic instructions for editors and compositors. The booklet includes headings for various aspects of composition: Text Composition; Indenting of Paragraphs; Punctuation Marks and Spelling; Capitals, Small Capitals, and Italics; References and Footnotes; Folios; The Printing of Plays; The Printing of Poetry; Make-up.

Beyond this specific set of guidelines, Tschichold made further changes to Penguin's graphic standards. Penguin is well known for its standardized book covers and formats, as well as the diversity of the standards.&lt;ref&gt;The seeming contradiction between standardization and diversity is explained by the vast numbers of books produced by Penguin over many years.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jan Tschichold and Penguin==
Penguin Books was founded by Allen Lane in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.penguin.co.uk/static/cs/uk/0/aboutus/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105152710/http://www.penguin.co.uk/static/cs/uk/0/aboutus/history.html |archivedate=2013-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic look of Penguin was established before Lane brought Tschichold to Penguin in the late 1940s as head of typography and production. Tschichold was in England at Penguin between 1947 and 1949 before returning to Switzerland.

Tschichold's standardization of Penguin covers essentially took existing elements and refined them visually and refined their arrangement. Under Tschichold the covers included the use of [[Eric Gill|Eric Gill's]] [[Gill Sans]] typeface, which he was careful to have spaced evenly. According to Tschichold establishing this quality was not immediately embraced by the compositors; “Every day I had to wade through miles of corrections (often ten books daily). I had a rubber stamp made: ‘Equalize letter-spaces according to their visual value.’ It was totally ignored; the hand compositors continued to space out the capitals on title-pages (where optical spacing is essential) with spaces of equal thickness.”&lt;ref name="doubleday"&gt;Richard Doubleday, "[http://www.dis.uia.mx/conference/2005/HTMs-PDFs/PenguinBooks.pdf Jan Tschichold at Penguin Books: A Resurgance [sic&amp;#93; of Classical Book Design]" (PDF).&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with Gill Sans, Tschichold made use of Monotype [[Bembo]], Monotype [[Centaur (typeface)|Centaur]] (by [[Bruce Rogers (typographer)|Bruce Rogers]]) and Gill's [[Perpetua (typeface)|Perpetua]] typeface.&lt;ref name="doubleday" /&gt;

The covers conformed to the golden ratio (4⅜" × 7⅛", 111mm × 181mm). For Penguin's distinctive orange color, Tschichold replaced it with a warmer tone.&lt;ref name="doubleday" /&gt;

The '''Philadelphia [[Herpetological_society|Herpetological Society]]''' (PHS) is the oldest, continually operated [[reptile]] group in [[North America]]. It was founded by [[Roger Conant (herpetologist)]] and a group of like-minded [[herpetologists]] in 1952. The current president is Mark Miller. 

PHS has published the ''Bulletin'' and occasional newsletters throughout its history.
 
They seem to meet infrequently at present but operate a reptile rescue for animals in the [[Philadelphia]] metro area, and a wildlife conservation area in Southern New Jersey.

{{Roman Curia}}
{{Canon Law}}
The '''Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts''' is a [[dicastery]] of the [[Roman Curia]]. Its work "consists mainly in interpreting the laws of the Church". (''[[Pastor Bonus]]'', 154).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19880628_pastor-bonus-roman-curia_en.html#PONTIFICAL%20COUNCILS|title=Pastor Bonus, - John Paul II - Apostolic Constitution (June 28, 1988) {{!}} John Paul II|website=www.vatican.va|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is distinct from the highest tribunal or court in the Church, which is the [[Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura]], and does not have law-making authority to the degree the Pope and the Holy See's tribunals do. Its charge is the interpretation of existing canon laws, and it works closely with the Signatura and the other Tribunals and the Pope. Like the Signatura and the other two final appellate Tribunals, the Roman Rota and the Apostolic Penitentiary, it is led by a prefect who is a bishop or archbishop.

The current President of the Pontifical Council is Archbishop [[Filippo Iannone]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/analysis-who-is-the-popes-new-canon-law-expert-57820 | title = Analysis: Who is the Pope’s new canon law expert? | accessdate = 27 October 2018 | date= 11 April 2018 | first = Andrea | last = Gagliarducci | work = Catholic News Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; the current Secretary is Bishop [[Juan Ignacio Arrieta Ochoa de Chinchetru]].

==History and field of competence==

The Pontifical Commission for Authentic Interpretation of the Code of Canon Law that [[Pope Benedict XV]] established on 5 September 1917 continued in existence until replaced on 28 March 1963 by [[Pope John XXIII]]'s Pontifical Commission for the Revision of the Code of Canon Law, a revision called for by the [[Second Vatican Council]]. [[Pope Paul VI]] established on 11 July 1967 the Pontifical Commission for Interpretation of the Decrees of the Second Vatican Council and, two years later, extended its mandate to the interpretation also of the documents issued by the Holy See to implement those decrees.

On 2 January 1984, [[Pope John Paul II]] set up the Pontifical Commission for Authentic Interpretation of the Code of Canon Law, with competence regarding the new [[Code of Canon Law]] promulgated the year before and the universal laws for the [[Latin Rite]]. This Commission replaced those mentioned in the previous paragraph. On 28 June 1988, it was given its present name.

On 18 October 1990, its competence was extended to interpreting the [[Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches]] and the laws shared in common by the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]].

[[File:Ranging Rods 2014-08-18 12-53.jpg|thumb|Ranging rod and Offset rod]]
A '''ranging rod''' is a [[surveying]] instrument used for marking the position of stations and for sightings of those stations as well as for ranging [[straight line]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/_/dict.aspx?rd=1&amp;word=ranging+rod | title=free dictionary | accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially these were made of light, thin and straight [[bamboo]] or of well seasoned wood such as [[teak]], [[pine]] or [[Cedrus deodara|deodar]]. They were shod with iron at the bottom and surmounted with a flag about 25 cm square in size. &lt;ref&gt;Surveying by prof. Cl Kocher in chapter Linear Measurements, page no. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays they are made of metallic materials only. The rods are usually 3 cm in diameter and 2 m or 3 m long, painted alternatively either [[red]] and [[white]] or [[black]] and white in lengths of 20 cm (i.e. one link length of metric chain). These colours are used so that the rod can be properly sighted in case of long distance or bad weather. Ranging rods of greater length, i.e., 4 m to 6 m, are called ranging poles and are used in case of very long [[surveying|survey]] lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/r7021e/r7021e02.htm | title=elementary surveying instruments | accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another type of ranging rod is known as an offset rod, which has no flag at the top. It is used for measuring small offsets from the survey line when the work is of an ordinary nature.&lt;ref&gt;Surveying by prof. Cl Kocher, page 20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
When the ranging rods are limited, thin sticks 40 cm to 1 m length with white [[paper]]s in the cuts at tops can serve their purpose. Such sticks are pointed at the bottom and are cut from wood. These are called as whites.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6309">'''Real utopian sociology''' is a [[sociology]] and type of emancipatory [[social science]] created and practiced by [[Erik Olin Wright]]. The seemingly contradictory term is literal, as the goal of real [[utopia]]n sociology is finding utopian projects in the world as it exists and systematically evaluating their potential to replace systems of domination, particularly capitalism.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~wright/OVERVIEW.html|title=OVERVIEW|last=Wright|first=Erik|website=www.ssc.wisc.edu|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simply put, real utopian sociology is the scientific and pragmatic pursuit of studying utopian models for society as it could exist, and pathways to get there.&lt;ref name=wash&gt;{{cite news|title=Thinking Utopian: How about a universal basic income?|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/05/11/thinking-utopian-how-about-a-universal-basic-income/?utm_term=.039df752dace|author=Mike Konczal|date=11 May 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=opendem&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/tni/sol-trumbo-vila-nick-buxton/atlas-of-real-utopias|title=An atlas of real utopias?|authors=Sol Trumbo Vila, Nick Buxton|publisher=OpenDemocracy|date=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Since 1991 Wright has organized a series of workshop conferences known as ''The Real Utopian Project'' that model the practice of real utopian sociology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~wright/RealUtopias.htm|title=RealUtopias|last=Wright|first=Erik Olin|website=www.ssc.wisc.edu|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conferences are sponsored by the A.E. Havens Center for Social Justice at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Wisconsin-Madison]] and structured around “a provocative manuscript that lays out the basic outlines of a radical institutional proposal.”&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; This manuscript is then sent to 15-20 scholars, who write essays on the topic. Prior to the conference these essays are circulated to all the conference participants and then each is discussed at the conference. Following the conference, participants have the opportunity to revise their work before it’s collectively published in Verso’s ''Real Utopias Project'' series; with the exception of papers from the first 1991 conference, which were not published as a series.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

[[Image:REAL UIUC.jpg|thumb|200px|The Regional Economics Applications Laboratory (REAL)]]
'''''The Regional Economics Applications Laboratory (REAL)''''' at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] is a [[regional science]] research center for advanced graduate students in the fields of economics, geography, urban and regional planning, computer science and mathematics. Professor [[Geoffrey J.D. Hewings]] is a co-founder of REAL and served as Director until 2016 (currently as Emeritus Director). Professor [[Sandy Dall'erba]] serves as the REAL Director since 2016. 

==Main goal==
Created in 1989 by Philip Israilevich and [[Geoffrey J.D. Hewings]], the Regional Economics Applications Laboratory (REAL) at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] started as a cooperative venture between the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago]] and the [[University of Illinois]]. 

While analyses of economies at the national level have long been prominent in the field of economics, increasing fragmentation of the production process in conjunction with increasing regional specialization due to the reduction of transportation costs obliges us to consider economies from a sub-national or even local perspective. Further, the last decade has seen remarkable progress in techniques for spatial economic analysis – the measurement and interpretation of economic activity across geographies as small as counties to units as extensive as individual countries.  

Based on these approaches and techniques, REAL’s mission is to provide timely, high quality analytical economic information for a variety of uses such as public policy decision making by public sector agencies and for strategic marketing in the private sector. REAL's capabilities revolve around comprehensive state and metropolitan models that integrate econometric and input-output analysis to provide for both impact and forecasting analyses. Current activities focus on interstate trade, forecasts for the [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] and other [[Midwest]] economies, housing market analysis and forecasts, demographic-economic modeling (especially the role of aging and immigration) and the development of alternative computable general equilibrium models created on the same data base.  

Research at REAL always attempts to provide a range of exposure to new curricula materials, methods of conducting interdisciplinary and international collaborative research and guidance in the preparation of material for dissemination in the public policy arena.  The latter component is extremely important and undervalued, yet academic research over the next decade is likely to be more project-driven with funding from stakeholders whose interest lie in the policy arena and less in the academic or scholarly content.  Hence, it is important that scholars learn, at an early stage in their career, how to balance the needs of client-based research with demands imposed on them by the academy for demonstrating high levels of scholarly achievement.  

REAL was created to operate like a science laboratory - with students and faculty together in one space, promoting interaction and collaboration.  A weekly seminar series provides students with many opportunities to present their research and an active Discussion Paper series on the web ensures wide dissemination for research.  REAL is supported by external grants and contracts, many of which have been developed with agencies in [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], and [[Austria]].  Most of the research has successfully served two markets - academic journals and public policy.

==Student involvement==
Since its inception, REAL has provided at least two years (and usually more) support for 38 doctoral students from agricultural economics, economics, geography and urban and regional planning, welcomed 8 "bolsa sandwiche" PhD students from [[Brazil]] who spent one year at REAL working on their doctoral dissertations and hosted over 100 international visitors (visiting students, visiting scholars and visiting professors) who stayed three months or more. Several experiences of foreign scholars coming informally to the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] demonstrated that a period of one or two semesters resulted in a major contribution to the thesis of these young researchers, as well as to their personal enhancement.  At any one time, from 15 to 30 visitors and students will be in residence. An updated list of past and current members is available from the following link: http://www.real.uiuc.edu/[http://www.real.uiuc.edu/]

Foreign visitors appreciate more especially the exposure to the challenges, issues and opportunities in another country because it provides them an important perspective that cannot be “taught” effectively by distance learning. Residence in another country, coupled with engagement with other students and faculty involved in their work provide them with an invaluable learning opportunity. In addition, the mass of students and the profound respect of REAL’s director for the various techniques of regional science allow foreign visitors to build quickly partnerships for their work and receive sound feedback.

Over the years, several colleagues, such as Rodney Jensen ([[Australia]]), Michael Sonis ([[Israel]]), Eduardo Haddad ([[Brazil]]), Joaquim Guilhoto ([[Brazil]]), Carlos Azzoni ([[Brazil]]), Miguel Marquez ([[Spain]]), Julian Ramajo ([[Spain]]) and Nikolaos Kalyviotis ([[Greece]]) have become regular visitors.  The collaboration with Sonis has yielded over 75 publications (including two edited monographs and 24 book chapters). About one third of REAL's alumni are working in academia, another third in local, state and international agencies and the remaining third in the private sector.

The sister organization of REAL is EU-REAL[http://eco.unex.es/eureal/], the [[European Union]] – Regional Economics Applications Laboratory. EU-REAL is a research net in regional science integrated by European scholars tied to REAL. Their goal is to foment the cooperation of their different members, establish permanent linkage among the participant researchers, and promote the development of different investigation lines in regional science.

In [[education]], '''response to intervention'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rtinetwork.org/learn/what/whatisrti|title=What is Response to Intervention (RTI)? {{!}} RTI Action Network|last=Gorski|first=Deb|website=www.rtinetwork.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; (commonly abbreviated '''RTI''' or '''RtI''') is an approach to academic intervention used in the United States to provide early, systematic, and appropriately intensive assistance to children who are at risk for or already underperforming as compared to appropriate grade- or age-level standards. RTI seeks to promote academic success  through universal screening, early intervention, frequent progress monitoring, and increasingly intensive research-based instruction or interventions for children who continue to have difficulty. RTI is a multileveled approach for aiding students that is adjusted and modified as needed if they are failing.

In terms of identifying students with [[learning disability|specific learning disabilities]] (SLD)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.specialeducationguide.com/disability-profiles/specific-learning-disabilities/|title=A Guide to Specific Learning Disabilities {{!}} Special Education Guide|work=Special Education Guide|access-date=2018-06-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, RTI was proposed as an alternative to the ability–achievement discrepancy model, which requires children to exhibit a significant discrepancy between their ability (often measured by [[Intelligence quotient|IQ testing]]) and academic achievement (as measured by their grades and standardized testing). Methods to identify students with SLD have been controversial for decades&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Ysseldyke, J., Thurlow, M., Graden, J., Wesson, C., Algozzine, B., &amp; Deno, S. L.|year=1983|title=Generalizations from five years of research on assessment and decision-making:  The University of Minnesota Institute|journal=Exceptional Education Quarterly|volume=4|pages=75–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; and proponents of RTI claim that the process brings more clarity to the Specific Learning Disability (SLD) category of the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act|Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act]] (IDEA 2004)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.ed.gov/idea/|title=Individuals with Disabilities Education Act {{!}} IDEA|website=sites.ed.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;, while opponents claim that RTI simply identifies low achieving students rather than students with learning disabilities.

==Description==
RTI is originally a special education term that has broadened into general education framework that involves research-based instruction and interventions, regular monitoring of student progress, and the subsequent use of these data over time to make a variety of educational decisions, including, but not limited to SLD eligibility.&lt;ref name="Special Education 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="baojournal.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasponline.org/resources/handouts/revisedPDFs/rtiprimer.pdf|title=Response to Intervention (RTI): A Primer for Parents|publisher=National Association of School Psychologists}}&lt;/ref&gt; To facilitate this broadened conception of RTI, a shift to labeling this as one of the approaches of a Multi-Tier System of Supports (MTSS) occurring in schools and the professional literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Gresham, F., Reschly, D., &amp; Shinn, M. R.|year=2010|chapter=RTI as a driving force in educational improvement: Historical legal, research, and practice perspectives|editors=M. R. Shinn &amp; H. M. Walker |title=Interventions for academic achievement problems in a three-tier model, including RTI|pages=47–77|location=Bethesda, MD|publisher=National Association of School Psychologists}}&lt;/ref&gt; Key to the RTI process is the application of scientifically based interventions that have been demonstrated to work in [[randomized controlled trial]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMHT0025811/|title=Randomized Control Trial - National Library of Medicine|last=pmhdev|website=PubMed Health|language=en|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A goal of the RTI process is to apply accountability to educational program by focusing on programs that work rather than programs that simply look, sound, or feel good.

RTI follows a number of core assumptions:&lt;ref name="Special Education 2005"/&gt; 
#The educational system can effectively teach all children
#Early intervention is critical to preventing problems from getting out of control
#The implementation of a multi-tiered service delivery model is necessary
#A problem solving model should be used to make decisions between tiers
#Research based interventions should be implemented to the extent possible
#Progress monitoring must be implemented to inform instruction
#Data should drive decision making

A learning disability is defined as a neurological disorder that affects the brain's ability to receive, process, store, and respond to information. They are a group of disorders that can impact many areas of learning, including reading, writing, spelling, math, listening, and oral expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncld.org/ld-basics/ld-aamp-language|title=Language &amp; Math|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626065701/http://www.ncld.org/ld-basics/ld-aamp-language|archivedate=June 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the process of identifying learning disabilities, RTI differs from the formerly standard "ability–achievement discrepancy" approach&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.understood.org/en/school-learning/evaluations/evaluation-basics/the-discrepancy-model-what-you-need-to-know|title=The Discrepancy Model: What You Need to Know|work=Understood.org|access-date=2018-06-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in that decisions are based on outcomes of targeted interventions rather than mathematical discrepancies between scores achieved on standardized assessments.

In the RTI process, service delivery is typically divided into three levels (tiers) of support, with the intensity of interventions increasing with each level.&lt;ref name="baojournal.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gresham, F.M.|year=2004|title=Current status and future directions of school-based behavioral interventions|journal=School Psychology Review|volume=33|issue=3|pages=326–343}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Tier 1''' is focused specifically within the core curriculum, with instruction and interventions targeting all students. Approximately 80% to 85% of the general student body should be able to meet grade level norms without additional assistance beyond the first tier. Students who consistently do not perform within the expected level of performance through Tier 1 instruction are then provided with additional supplementary interventions at '''Tier 2''', which typically involves small group instruction. Approximately 3% to 6% of students will continue to have difficulties after Tier 2 interventions; these students will then receive '''Tier 3''' intervention services, which is the most intense level of intervention (often one-on-one) provided in the regular education environment. As RTI is a regular education initiative, all three tiers of services are intended to be provided as supplements to, not replacements for, the regular education curriculum; there are some, however, who view Tier 3 as [[special education]].&lt;ref name="Special Education 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hale (2006) first presented a model that included Standard Protocol Model RTI at Tier 1, Problem-Solving Model RTI at Tier 2, and individualized special education at tier 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===School-wide screening===
The first level of data collected in the RTI process comes from universal school-wide screenings. These screening assessments are typically given to all students within targeted grade levels, and cover basic academic subjects such as reading and mathematics. Most screening measures aim to be practical and efficient to administer, with the goal of identifying students who may require further assessments and interventions.

To evaluate student performance on the screening measures, scores are compared to specific criteria (''criterion referenced'') or to broad norms (''norm referenced''). When specific criteria are used, ''cut scores'' are established to evaluate students against a specific level of proficiency (e.g., achieving a score of 15 or above); in a normative comparison, students' scores are compared against those of a larger group (e.g., scoring above the 25th percentile compared to a national sample of 3rd grade students).

Screenings usually occur three times per year (fall, winter, and spring), and the data from these assessments help to guide instruction through the three tiers of the RTI process. This is important not only for identifying students who are having difficulties, but also for identifying possible areas of improvement in the general classroom instruction in the cases where too many students fall below expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Jenkins, J.R. |date=December 2003|title=Candidate measures for screening at-risk students|conference=NRCLD Responsiveness-to-Intervention Symposium|location=Kansas City, MO|accessdate=April 3, 2006|url=http://www.nrcld.org/symposium2003/jenkins/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Because a single universal screening at the beginning of the year can over-identify students who require preventative intervention, the National Research Center on Learning Disabilities recommends that schools also integrate at least five weeks of weekly progress monitoring to identify students who require preventative intervention&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ldonline.org/resources_new/9749|title=National Research Center on Learning Disabilities {{!}} LD OnLine|website=www.ldonline.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Teaching ===
Core curriculum in the classroom should be research-based and field tested. This means, based on evidence from congregating research, that the core curriculum contains all the fundamentals found necessary to efficiently teach reading and has a recognized record of achievement. Such curriculum is to be delivered by "highly qualified" teachers adequately trained to deliver the selected instruction as intended, that is, with fidelity to design.

===Progress monitoring and tiered service delivery===
Progress monitoring is a set of assessment procedures for determining the extent to which students are benefiting from classroom instruction and for monitoring effectiveness of curriculum.

[[Curriculum-based measurement]] (CBM)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Deno, S. L.|year=1985|title=Curriculum-based measurement: The emerging alternative|journal=Exceptional Children|volume=52|issue=3|pages=219–232|pmid=2934262}}&lt;/ref&gt; is often used to collect [[data]] on interventions and their effectiveness to determine what works best for an individual student. Additional methods are attempted until students "respond" to the intervention and improve their skills. Students that do not respond, or respond at significantly low rates, may be deemed to have biologically based learning disabilities, rather than simply learning difficulties.

Progress monitoring is the scientifically based practice of assessing students' academic performance on a regular basis for three purposes: 
#To determine whether children are profiting appropriately from the instructional program, including the curriculum
#To build more effective programs for the children who do not benefit
#To estimate rates of student improvement

Three tiers of Scientifically Research-Based Interventions (SRBIs) of increasing intensity incorporate the key components of RTI and help ensure the academic growth and achievement of students.

====Tier 1====
The first tier states that all students receive core classroom instruction that is [[differentiated instruction|differentiated]] and utilizes strategies and materials that are scientifically research-based. Assessment in the classroom should be ongoing and effective in that it clearly identifies the strengths and weaknesses for each learner. Any necessary interventions at this level are within the framework of the general education classroom and can be in the form of differentiated instruction, small group review, or one-on-one remediation of a concept.

Progress monitoring in Tier 1 uses universal screening assessments to show individual student growth over time and to determine whether students are progressing as expected. In this process, data are collected, students are identified using benchmark scores, and measurable goals are set for the next data collection point for those who display difficulties. The team then follows a problem-solving process to determine interventions for at-risk students that will work within whole-class instructions. The classroom teacher implements the interventions, observations are conducted to ensure the fidelity of the classroom instruction, and the problem-solving team periodically reviews the progress of students.

====Tier 2====
In the second tier, supplemental interventions may occur within or outside of the general education classroom, and progress monitoring occurs at more frequent intervals. Core instruction is still delivered by the classroom teacher, but small groups of similar instructional levels may work together under a teacher's instruction and/or guidance. This type of targeted instruction is typically for 30 minutes per day, two to four days per week, for a minimum of nine weeks. This targeted instruction may occur in the general education setting or outside in a smaller group setting with a specialized teacher (such as a Literacy Support teacher for struggling readers).

In Tier 2, the main purpose of progress monitoring is to determine whether interventions are successful in helping students learn at an appropriate rate. Decision rules are created to determine when a student might no longer require extra interventions, when the interventions need to be changed, or when a student might be identified for special education.

Oral language abilities at the onset of reading intervention programs are an excellent predictor of final outcomes.&lt;ref name="Lovett 2008 333–352"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lovett|first=M. W.|last2=De Palma |first2=M. |last3=Frijters |first3=J. |last4=Steinbach |first4=K. |last5=Temple |first5=M. |last6=Benson |first6=N. |last7=Lacerenza |first7=L.|title=Interventions for reading difficulties: A comparison of response to intervention by ELL and EFL struggling readers.|journal=Journal of Learning Disabilities|year=2008|volume=41|issue=4|pages=333–352|doi=10.1177/0022219408317859}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both English as a first language and English-language learners demonstrate that the greater the oral language impairment, the greater the associated growth from RTI.&lt;ref name="Lovett 2008 333–352"/&gt; Phonics-based RTI programs are most effective prior to grade 1, however, after grade 1 comprehension and mixed RTI programs are associated with greater effect sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Suggate|first=S. P.|title=Why what we teach depends on when: Grade and reading intervention modality moderate effect size.|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=2010|volume=46|issue=6|pages=1556–1579|doi=10.1037/a0020612|pmid=20873927}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tier 3====
Tier three is for students who require more intense, explicit and individualized instruction and have not shown sufficient response to Tier 1 and Tier 2 interventions. This type of targeted instruction is delivered for a minimum of two 30-minute sessions every week for nine to twelve weeks. The interventions in this tier may be similar to those in Tier 2 except that they are intensified in focus, frequency, and duration. The instruction in Tier 3 is typically delivered outside of the general education classroom. Programs, strategies, and procedures are designed and employed to supplement, enhance, and support Tier 1 and Tier 2 instruction by remediation of the relevant area and development of compensatory strategies. If Tier 3 is not successful, a child is considered for the first time as potentially having a learning disability.

In some cases, Tier 3 is considered to be [[special education]], with instruction being provided to individual students or small groups by special education teachers ''in place of'' general education instruction (rather than as a supplement). Initial goals are established through an [[individualized education program]] (IEP)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parentcenterhub.org/iep-overview/|title=The Short-and-Sweet IEP Overview {{!}} Center for Parent Information and Resources|website=www.parentcenterhub.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which is guided by the results of a comprehensive evaluation, and ongoing progress monitoring helps to direct the teaching process. Special education instruction likely will be considerably longer than the 10 to 12 weeks of supplemental instruction delivered in Tier 2 and beyond. The frequency of special education instruction depends upon student need, and the criteria to exit special education are specified and monitored so that placement can be flexible.

===RTI implementation===
The number of schools implementing RTI continues to grow and 61% of schools surveyed in 2010 indicated that they had fully implemented or were in the process of implementing RTI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Council of Administrators of Special Education|last2=National Association of State Directors of Special Education|last3=American Association of School Administrators|title=Response to Intervention Adoption Survey|date=2010|publisher=Spectrum K-12 School Solutions|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most schools in the survey indicated that the continued to focus on reading interventions at the elementary school. RTI is primarily implemented by grade-level teams or professional learning communities as part of a school-wide problem-solving plan, and previous research found that implementing RTI resulted in several positive outcomes such as reductions in students referred to and placed into special education, more students passing state accountability tests, and increased academic skills among students at-risk for reading failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burns|first1=Matthew|last2=Appleton|first2=James|last3=Stehouwer|first3=Jonathon|title=Meta-analysis of response-to-intervention research: Examining field-based and research-implemented models.|journal=Journal of Psychoeducational Assessment|date=2005|volume=23|pages=381–394|doi=10.1177/073428290502300406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fidelity of implementation===
In an RTI model, fidelity is important at both the school level (e.g., implementation of the process) and the teacher level (e.g., implementation of instruction). Although the concept of fidelity of implementation is supported by research and is generally viewed as common sense, there are practical challenges associated with achieving high levels of fidelity.
Factors that can reduce fidelity when implementing instruction include:&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, E., Mellard, D.F., Fuchs, D., &amp; McKnight, M.A. (2006). Responsiveness to intervention (RTI): How to do it. Lawrence, KS: National Research Center on Learning Disabilities.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Complexity of the interventions and the time required to implement them
*Inaccessibility of required materials and resources
*Low perceptions/expectations of effectiveness (teachers may not fully commit to an intervention if they believe that it will not be effective, or if it is inconsistent with their teaching style)
*Low numbers, expertise, and motivation of those who deliver the interventions
Factors that can increase fidelity when implementing an RTI model include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burns|first1=Matthew|last2=Gibbons|first2=Kimberly|title=Implementing response to intervention in elementary and secondary schools: Procedures to assure scientific-based practices|date=2012|publisher=Routledge|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Well-functioning professional learning communities
*Using a universal screener that is brief, aligned with the curriculum, result in reliable data, and is validated for screening decisions
*Using a data-management system that is easily accessible by classroom teachers
*Implementing interventions that address the skill deficit of students
*Identifying and addressing class-wide needs
*Establishing well-defined decision rules
*Clear leadership from the building principal
*Ongoing training and professional development
*Key stakeholders working together in a flexible manner to improve student learning
*Use of standard-protocol interventions for tier 2
*Not making entitlement (i.e., special education disability identification) decisions until the RTI system is in place and well established.

==Classification of RTI==
RTI is a general education process that is used in schools to ensure students receive the supports they need to be successful and excel in school.  In the educational literature, RTI is often referred to as a ''Standard Protocol Approach'',  as a ''Problem Solving Model.'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Fuchs, D., Mock, D., Morgan, P. L., &amp; Young, C. L.|year=2003|title=Responsiveness-to-Intervention: Definitions, evidence, and implications for the learning disabilities construct|journal=Learning Disabilities Research and Practice|volume=18|issue=3|pages=157–171|url=http://danlane.wiki.westga.edu/file/view/Fuchs+(Responsiveness+to+intervention...).pdf|doi=10.1111/1540-5826.00072}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as a hybrid of the two. However, some have challenged a dichotomous view of RTI because both models incorporate problem solving to identify the academic or social-emotional difficulty the student is having and both use a systematic, universal screening procedure during Tier 1 to determine which students are having difficulties meeting age or grade level benchmarks for a specific skill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Christ|first1=Theodore|last2=Burns|first2=Matthew|last3=Ysseldyke|first3=James|title=Conceptual confusion within response-to-intervention vernacular: Clarifying meaningful differences.|journal=NASP Communique|date=2005|volume=34|issue=3|pages=1, 6–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, [[Curriculum Based Measurement]] (CBM) or other predictive data are used to flag the students who are not meeting expected levels of performance. In the problem-solving model approach, the teacher typically refers the student to a problem-solving team to ascertain the challenges a student is having within the classroom. Using information collected from the classroom teacher and others, observations, etc., the team determines what additional supports the student might need to address the learning gap. Standard-protocol approaches tend to rely more on grade-level teams and professional learning communities to make intervention decisions, but both approaches use a problem-solving procedure to make decisions, which makes the distinction somewhat meaningless. Many schools rely on grade-level teams to make intervention decision and use a standardized intervention for tier 2, but then rely on a problem-solving team to develop individualized interventions for tier 3.

When a student is identified as having difficulties in school, a team provides interventions of increasing intensity to help the child catch up with the rest of his or her peers. When students continue to struggle, even when appropriate evidence-based practices have been delivered with fidelity, students may be referred for a special education evaluation.  Parents can request a special education evaluation at any time in this process, however.   While the RTI process can be a way to ensure that each student is afforded the opportunity to learn, some opponents feel that it allows school districts to avoid or delay identifying students who need special education services. Proponents would point out that RTI is not the process of identifying students with a learning disability by starting tiered interventions when a disability is suspected, but is the process of examining data that already exist from implementing a tiered intervention model, which should expedite the identification process. The expected outcome of RTI is improved instruction that will result in improved outcomes for all students&lt;ref name="Mary Wagner &amp; Phyllis Levine"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shapiro, E., Zigmond, N., Wallace, T., &amp; Marston, D.|title=Models for Implementing Response to Intervention|date=2011|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-60918-124-6|pages=377–394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Support for RTI ==
There are at least four main reasons for implementing RTI: 1) to increase achievement for all students; 2) to reduce racial/ethnic disproportionate representation of minority students in special education; 3) to increase collaboration and integration of general and special education; 4) and to identify students with learning disabilities through a different lens than the IQ-achievement discrepancy model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sawyer, Holland, &amp; Detgen|first1=R., D., &amp; A.|title=State policies and procedures and selected local implementation practices in response to intervention in the six southeast region states|url=http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/edlabs/regions/southeast/pdf/REL_2008063.pdf|website=National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance, regional educational laboratory southeast|accessdate=Feb 6, 2015|ref=REL 2008-063}}&lt;/ref&gt; RTI proponents claim that when interventions work, fewer children, particularly minority children, are referred for special education, and that the RTI model acts as a safeguard, ensuring that a child is not given a label of a disability inappropriately. In addition, proponents state that RTI  helps school districts by eliminating unnecessary referrals, which drain time and resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=AE Farstrup |year=2007|title=RTI: A vital concern for reading professionals|journal=Reading Today|volume=25|issue=3|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics express concern, however, that in attempting to eliminate unnecessary referrals, RTI may also delay or eliminate necessary referrals.

Proponents feel that response to intervention is the best opportunity for giving all students the additional time and support needed to learn at high levels,&lt;ref&gt;Buffum,A., Mattos, M., &amp; Weber,C. (2010). "The why try behind RTI: Response to Intervention flourishes when educators implement the right practices for the right reasons." Educational Leadership, Oct. 2010, 10–16&lt;/ref&gt; and see great benefit in that it applies to the classroom teachers, paraeducators, counselors, and the administration. The RTI process can help identify students who are at-risk, guide adjustments to instruction, monitor student progress, and then make other recommendations as necessary. The objective is that with minor adjustments or simple interventions, students may respond and achieve at higher levels.

RTI is also very useful when working with students who have severe emotional problems.  The structure and evaluation of RTI will help this particular group of students to be successful in the academic environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pearce, I. R. |year=2009|title=Helping children with emotional difficulties: A response to intervention investigation|journal=The Rural Educator |volume=30|issue=2|pages=34–36|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ869307.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reading difficulties is one of the most common reasons students need intervention support.  Reading goals can develop reading self-concept, which influence reading fluency skills and promotes the importance of goal setting in reading intervention programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Quirk|first=M.|author2=Schwaneflugel, P. J. |author3=Webb, M. Y. |title=A short-term longitudinal study of the relationship between motivation to read and reading fluency skill in second grade.|journal=Journal of Literacy Research|year=2009|volume=41|pages=196–227|doi=10.1080/10862960902908467|pmc=2838245}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is imperative that students monitor these goals and celebrate their progress. Students involved in multiple-component reading intervention programs show significant improvement, and students in different socioeconomic, racial, and intellectual quotient groups make equivalent gains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morris|first=R. D.|author2=Lovett, M. W. |author3=Wolf, M. |author4=Sevcik, R. A. |author5=Steinbach, K. A. |author6=Frijters, J. C. |author7=Shapiro, M.

== Relationship between IDEA and RTI ==
The [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA) was revised and signed into law in 2004 and became effective in July 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parentcenterhub.org/idea/|title=IDEA—the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act {{!}} Center for Parent Information and Resources|website=www.parentcenterhub.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;. According to the law, a specific learning disability is a disorder of one or more of the basic psychological processes that adversely affects academic achievement in one or more domains (e.g., reading, writing, math, language). There are three methods of SLD identification under IDEA, as defined in §300.8(c)(10) (OSERS Final Regulations-8/06):
#a discrepancy between "ability" and "achievement"
#failure to respond to scientific research-based  intervention
#alternative research-based procedures for determining whether a child has a specific learning disability
(The "third method" is often considered a "processing strengths and weaknesses" model.)

The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA makes mention of RTI as a method of part of the process of identifying SLD: 
#In diagnosing learning disabilities, schools are no longer required to use the discrepancy model. The act states that, "a local educational agency shall not be required to take into consideration whether a child has a severe discrepancy between achievement and intellectual ability[...]"
#Response to intervention is specifically mentioned in the regulations in conjunction with the identification of a specific learning disability. IDEA 2004 states, "a local educational agency may use a process that determines if the child responds to scientific, research-based intervention as a part of the evaluation procedures."
#Early Intervening Services (EIS) are prominently mentioned in IDEA for the first time. These services are directed at interventions for students prior to referral in an attempt to avoid inappropriate classification, which proponents claim an RTI model does. IDEA now authorizes the use of up to 15% of IDEA allocated funds for EIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idea.ed.gov/explore/view/p/,root,dynamic,QaCorner,8,|work=ed.gov|title=Q&amp;A on Response to Intervention and Early Intervening Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RTI was included in the regulations due to considerable concerns raised by both the House and Senate Committees regarding proponents of RTI claims about the use of IQ tests to identify learning disabled students. There was also recognition in these committees of a growing body of scientific research supporting methods of pre-referral interventions that resolved learning difficulties short of classification. However, the final regulations also allow a third method of SLD identification, often considered a processing strengths and weaknesses model.

The IDEA Committee Conference Report (CCR)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Response to Intervention in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)|year=2004|url=http://www.reading.org/downloads/resources/IDEA_RTI_report.pdf|access-date=2009-02-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324040342/http://www.reading.org/downloads/resources/IDEA_RTI_report.pdf|archive-date=2009-03-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; discusses the use of scientifically based early intervention programs, describes a model response-to-intervention program, and recommends the development of the most effective implementation of responsiveness to intervention models. The report describes such a model as an essential service for reducing the need to label children as disabled.

===Evaluating SLD using RTI===

First, it should be noted that whatever procedures are used to evaluate students as eligible for special education in the category of specific learning disabilities (SLD) must conform to the requirements of the IDEA regulations (2006), which indicate that a full and individual evaluation of a student suspected as having an SLD must address four qualifications. First, the evaluation must document that "...the child does not achieve adequately for the child's age or to meet State-approved grade-level standards in one or more of the following areas, when provided with learning experiences and instruction appropriate for the child's age or state-approved grade-level standards: oral expression, listening comprehension, written expression, basic reading skill, reading fluency skills, reading comprehension, mathematics calculation, mathematics problem-solving" (§300.309[a][1]). Second, the evaluation must document that "...(t)he child does not make sufficient progress to meet age or State-approved grade-level standards in one or more of the areas identified ...when using a process based on the child's response to scientific, research-based intervention; or (t)he child exhibits a pattern of strengths and weaknesses in performance, achievement, or both, relative to age, State-approved grade-level standards, or intellectual development, that is determined by the group to be relevant to the identification of a specific learning disability, using appropriate assessments (§300.309[a][2). Third, the evaluation must establish that the child's academic deficiencies are not the results of "...visual, hearing, or motor disabilities; mental retardation; emotional disturbance; cultural factors; environmental or economic disadvantage; or Limited English proficiency" (§300.309[a][3]) or of a lack of instruction ((§300.309[a][4]). Notably, a child must demonstrate qualifications under all four of these criteria to be identified with an SLD.

Kovaleski, VanDerHeyden and Shapiro (2013)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kovaleski, J.F.|author2=VanDerHeyden, A.M.|author3=Shapiro, E.S.|title=The RTI approach to evaluating learning disabilities|date=2013|publisher=Guilford|isbn=978-1-4625-1154-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; used these IDEA regulations to operationalize how evaluation teams could utilize data collected during the provision of a multi-tier system of support in the evaluation process, particularly those data that inform the second SLD criterion of the child's failure to make sufficient progress in response scientific, research-based intervention (namely, RTI). Although evaluation teams may collect additional data after parents give permission for a full and individual evaluation, there should be ample data collected during three tiers of core instruction and robust intervention that can be analyzed to address all four of the SLD criteria.

In regard to the first SLD criterion, students undergoing multiple tiers of support have typically undergone multiple assessments of their academic skills, including annual state tests, universal screenings of all students that schools typically conduct three times per year, and academic assessments by specialists who deliver increasingly intense academic interventions. To qualify under this first criterion, the preponderance of these data should indicate a significant academic deficiency in at least one of the identified areas.

When using RTI as a component of eligibility decision-making, the school entity (school district, state) establishes a policy that identifies the option of using RTI to address the second SLD criterion (and opts not to select the option to use an assessment of the student's pattern of strengths and weaknesses).  The determination that the student fails to make sufficient progress toward age or grade standards is based on an analysis of the progress-monitoring data that are collected during the provision of intensive intervention, typically at tiers 2 and 3 of a multi-tier system of support. These data consist of the results of short assessments of key academic indicators that are administered as often as once or twice weekly. These data are graphed and rates of improvement calculated so that school teams can determine whether their interventions are working. These data are then compared to the rates of improvement made by typically performing students to determine whether the interventions that are being implemented in general education are sufficient to allow the student to reach grade standards. If not, a need for special education is indicated, and the student meets the second qualification for SLD.

The process for ruling out other disabilities or conditions when using RTI is similar to that employed in other special education evaluations, and consists of procedures to ensure that sensory or intellectual disabilities or environmental disadvantage or cultural/linguistic differences are not the true cause of the student's assessed academic deficiencies. Establishing that the student's deficiencies are not the result of a lack of instruction, however, requires that the evaluation team document that the school has sufficiently provided good core instruction in the basic skills and robust interventions when students have failed to profit from typical instructional practices. The evaluation team must also show evidence that the school personnel conducted repeated assessments of the student's academic problems and communicated the results of those assessments to the student's parents. Schools that use a multi-tier system of support at a high degree of fidelity can typically readily rule out lack of instruction as a cause of the student's academic concerns. On the other hand, in enacting this provision, Congress was demonstrating a concern that students might be identified with a disability (SLD) when the actual cause of their academic failure was ineffective schooling. Identifying students with SLD in failing schools is arguably problematic.

==Response to RTI==
Criticisms point to delays in identifying students needing special education (which was also a concern in a 2010 OSERS Memorandum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www5.esc13.net/thescoop/special/files/2011/01/RTI-Memo-1-21-111.pdf|title=2010 OSERS Memorandum|access-date=2011-12-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503092705/http://www5.esc13.net/thescoop/special/files/2011/01/RTI-Memo-1-21-111.pdf|archive-date=2012-05-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), difficulties in accurately determining the presence of a learning disability,&lt;ref name="Hale et al 2010" /&gt; and the amount of training needed by general education teachers. RTI can require additional work for teachers, and a potentially significant change in expectations represents a great source of resistance toward RTI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Richards, C.|displayauthors=etal|title=Response to Intervention: Building the Capacity of Teachers To Serve Students with Learning Difficulties|journal=Teacher Education|volume=16|issue=2|date=Fall 2007|pages=55–64|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ796252.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism of RTI is that while its core assumptions include "that the educational system can effectively teach all children," interpretations of the approach often do not account for gifted education. An inverted pyramid showing analogous increasing interventions for gifted children could be added to the model so that all children are addressed. A framework for such an approach has been developed by the Montana Office of Public Instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opi.mt.gov/PDF/Gifted/RtI_GTFramework.pdf|title=Response to Intervention (RtI) and Gifted and Talented Education (GT)|date=Fall 2009|publisher=Montana Office of Public Instruction|access-date=2010-03-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304091817/http://www.opi.mt.gov/PDF/Gifted/RtI_GTFramework.pdf|archive-date=2010-03-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concerns and criticisms of RTI for SLD classification==
Criticisms of the RTI model first surfaced in 2004 when IDEA identified it as a viable method for use in SLD eligibility determination&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Hale, J.B., Naglieri, J.A., Kaufman, A.S., &amp; Kavale, K.A.|year=2004|title=Specific learning disability classification in the new Individuals with Disabilities Education Act: The danger of good ideas|journal=The School Psychologist|volume=58|issue=1|pages=6–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some feel that RTI is valuable for prevention, but see little empirical support for using RTI to determine learning disabilities, and have concern that it could be used to delay or deny services to children with learning disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Reynolds, C. R., &amp; Shaywitz, S. E.|year=2009|title=Response to intervention: Remediation, perhaps, diagnosis, no|journal=Child Development Perspectives|volume=3|pages=44–47|issue=1|pmid=20161671|doi=10.1111/j.1750-8606.2008.00075.x|pmc=2819473}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some also argue that there are many unanswered questions about RTI implementation, and that proponents have tended to gloss over or ignore criticisms of the RTI approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Fuchs, D., &amp; Deshler, D.

==Technology application to RTI==
Technology is becoming increasingly important in improving instructional practices and student achievement. Tools that educators can utilize within their classrooms include [[weblog]]s, [[wiki]]s, [[RSS]] [[News aggregator|aggregators]], [[social bookmarking]], online photo galleries, [[webcasting|audio/visual casting]], [[Twitter]], and [[social networking]] sites.&lt;ref name="Richardson 2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Richardson|first=Will|title=Blogs, wikis, podcasts, and other powerful web tools for classrooms|year=2010|publisher=Corwin|location=Thousand Oaks, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these tools can be used for team-based learning and in facilitating students' use of higher forms of thinking such as analysis, evaluation, and synthesis.&lt;ref name="Richardson 2009" /&gt;

Properly integrated technology can increase student learning in areas such as motivation, collaborative learning, critical thinking, and problem solving.&lt;ref name="Schacter 1999" /&gt; Some techniques that have been found to work in education include: identifying similarities and differences; summarizing and note taking; reinforcing effort and providing recognition; assigning homework and practice; utilizing graphic representations of concepts; cooperative learning; providing objectives and feedback; generating and testing hypotheses; providing cues and questions; and using advanced organizers.&lt;ref name="Marzano 1998" /&gt; Technology-rich environments can also be effective for at-risk students, and can motivate students to stay in school and hopefully lessen the achievement gap.&lt;ref name="Collins 2009" /&gt;

Computer Assisted Instruction (CAI)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.readingrockets.org/article/computer-assisted-instruction-and-reading|title=Computer-Assisted Instruction and Reading|date=2013-04-24|work=Reading Rockets|access-date=2018-06-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, has been studied for its effects on lower achieving students. The effectiveness has been attributed to it being non-judgmental and motivational, while giving immediate and frequent feedback, individualizing learning to meet the students' needs, allowing for more student autonomy, and providing multi-sensory components (Barley ''et al.'', 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;97).&lt;ref name="Barley 2002" /&gt; A review of 17 different studies found that CAI positively affected scores in mathematics and literacy for all grade levels and significantly improving scores for students labeled "at-risk" (Barley ''et al.'', 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;105).&lt;ref name="Barley 2002" /&gt;

Technology can also effectively help teach basic literacy skills such as phonemic awareness, alphabetic principle, word recognition, alliteration, and comprehension. Today the use of specialized educational software applications can help support and enhance students' literacy skills. Presentation software such as [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]] can be used to enhance young children learning experience. The use of pictures, colors, sounds, animation, slide designs, or slide transitions can be easily implemented into a literacy lesson, and such software has been used, for example, to help students with autism learn and respond to activity schedules.&lt;ref name="Grabe 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grabe|title=Using Animation in Microsoft PowerPoint to Enhance Engagement and Learning in Young Learners with Developmental Delay|year=2007|journal=[[Teaching Exceptional Children]]|pages=58–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For young learners, the use of animation directs their attention to important features and prompts them to help ensure correct responses. Teachers can create literacy lessons with attention-grabbing elements such as moving graphic images. For example, a teacher might focus on the initial /d/ sound in the word "dog" as an instructional goal; a presentation slide for this would show a picture of a dog, and the teacher would select three possible letters to represent the initial sound in dog, such as /b/, /c/, and /d/. After showing the picture of the dog, and then displaying each of the three letter choices one-by-one, the teacher would ask the student what letter he or she thinks "dog" starts with.&lt;ref name="Parette 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Article|last=Parette|first=H|author2=Blum, C. |author3=Hourcade, J.J |date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other types of presentation software for literacy instruction, such as [[Photo Story]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://download.cnet.com/Photo-Story-3-for-Windows/3000-12511_4-10339154.html|title=Photo Story 3 for Windows|website=Download.com|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;, can allow teachers to add a variety of special effects, soundtracks, captions, and their own voice narration to the photo stories.

The '''Royal Society of the Humanities at Uppsala''' (''Kungl. Humanistiska Vetenskaps-Samfundet i Uppsala'') is a Swedish Royal academy for the study of the humanities.

==Founding==
The society was founded in 1889 by a donation from tannery factory owner [[Jacob Westin]] in Stockholm who gave SEK 50,000 in his will dated 1878 to form a scientific community to further the study of philosophy, philology and history sciences. Westin also donated a large collection of books and manuscripts to [[Uppsala University]] library.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khvsu.se/historik/ Kort historik.] Kungl. Humanistiska Vetenskaps-Samfundet i Uppsala. Retrieved 8 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The society's statutes were ratified by the Swedish king on 28 March 1896.{{citation required|date=November 2015}}

==Prizes==
The society annually awards a prize to two doctoral dissertations, known as the Westinska prize.

Prior to assuming the university's current form, charters had been granted by the [[Texas Legislature]] (Texas Congress 1836–1845) to establish four educational institutions: [[Rutersville College]] of [[Rutersville, Texas]], ''Wesleyan College'' of [[San Augustine, Texas]], [[McKenzie College (Texas)|McKenzie College]] of [[Clarksville, Texas]], and [[Soule University]] of [[Chappell Hill, Texas]].

In 1873, the union of these four institutions opened in Georgetown as ''Texas University''.&lt;ref name="To Survive and Excell, Chapter VI. Fulfillment of the Vision: Southwestern University"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=William B.|title=To Survive and Excel|year=2006|publisher=Southwestern University|location=Georgetown, TX|pages=59–75|url=http://www.southwestern.edu/library/documents/ToSurviveAndExcel.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wishing to reserve that name for a proposed state university in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]], the Texas Legislature instead granted a charter in 1875 under the name ''Southwestern University'' as a continuation of the charters for Rutersville, Wesleyan, McKenzie, and Soule. The university considers its founding date to be 1840 when Rutersville College opened. Southwestern thus claims to be the oldest university in Texas and the second oldest coeducational liberal arts college west of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]].

Southwestern was a charter member of the [[Southwest Conference]] in 1915. [[Southern Methodist University]] was Southwestern's main rival for several decades in remembrance of an unsuccessful attempt to relocate Southwestern to Dallas which instead resulted in the establishment of SMU. When SMU's student population became much larger, students at Southwestern began considering [[Trinity University (Texas)|Trinity University]] and [[Austin College]] to be the school's main rivals. After World War II, Southwestern transformed itself into a small liberal arts institution, discontinuing its post-graduate degrees, disbanding the football team, and rebuilding much of the campus with a massive capital campaign. The endowment rose substantially.

Southwestern has a history of drawing prolific lecturers to campus, including [[William Jennings Bryan]], [[Helen Keller]], [[bell hooks]], and alumnus [[J. Frank Dobie]]. Orators traveling by train often stopped off on their way to or from [[Austin, TX|Austin]], giving their lectures and catching the next train. Speakers at the annual Brown Symposium have included author [[Isaac Asimov]] (through a [[video conference]]) in the early 1980s and [[Nobel prize]]-winning economist [[Joseph Stiglitz]] in 2002. Since it began, the Shilling Lecture series has brought a variety of prominent figures, including presidential advisor [[Karen Hughes]] (2003), [[Archbishop]] [[Desmond Tutu]] (2004), former [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Pakistani Prime Minister]] [[Benazir Bhutto]] (2005), former Governor of [[New Jersey]] [[Thomas Kean]] (2006), former Secretary of State [[James Baker]] (2007), former U.S. senator [[Bill Bradley]] (2008), Nobel Peace Prize winner [[Wangari Maathai]] (2009), senior fellow in the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] Global Health Program [[William Foege]] (2010), founder of TOMs Shoes [[Blake Mycoskie]] (2011), and three-time Pulitzer Prize winner [[Thomas Friedman]] (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roy &amp; Margaret Shilling Lecture Series|url=http://www.southwestern.edu/about/shilling/|accessdate=4 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209072905/http://www.southwestern.edu/about/shilling/|archivedate=February 9, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2002, The Writer's Voice series presented [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning author [[Michael Chabon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.southwestern.edu/library/writers-voice/chabon.html | title = The Writer's Voice presents Michael Chabon | publisher = Southwestern.edu | date = November 4, 2002 | accessdate = October 22, 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080509155553/http://www.southwestern.edu/library/writers-voice/chabon.html | archivedate = May 9, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Writer's Voice has also welcomed such authors as [[Joyce Carol Oates]] (2000), [[Margaret Atwood]] (2003), [[Amy Tan]] (2007), and [[Azar Nafisi]] (2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.southwestern.edu/library/writers-voice/wvoice.html | title = The Writer's Voice | publisher = Southwestern.edu | accessdate = October 22, 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090227005958/http://www.southwestern.edu/library/writers-voice/wvoice.html | archivedate = February 27, 2009 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
The university offers 40 majors and 36 minors divided between the Brown College of Arts and Sciences and the Sarofim School of Fine Arts. In addition to traditional academic majors, Southwestern offers [[interdisciplinary]], independent, and paired majors as well as pre-professional programs in Engineering, Law, Medicine, and [[Theology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southwestern.edu/academics/|title=Southwestern University: Academics|accessdate=October 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southwestern.edu/academics/departments.php|title=Southwestern University: Departments|accessdate=October 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2013-2014 school year, total student enrollment was at 1,536, with a gender distribution of about 60 percent female and 40 percent male. Of the entering first-year students in Fall 2013, 37 percent were in the top 10 percent of their high school graduating class with an average SAT score of 1166 (*writing section not included). While the majority of students come from Texas (89 percent),  the remaining 11 percent come from 23 other states and 6 countries. Minority students constitute 33 percent of the student body.&lt;ref name="Southwestern University Profile"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://southwestern.edu/about/profile.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002035810/http://www.southwestern.edu/about/profile.php |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 2, 2013 |title=Southwestern University Profile |accessdate=December 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The student to faculty ratio is 11:1, with an average class size of 15 students. Ninety-nine percent of the tenured or tenure-track faculty hold a doctorate or highest degree in their fields. Collaborative research and publication with students is common.&lt;ref name="Southwestern University Profile"/&gt;

===Research===
Southwestern hosts two interdisciplinary academic exhibitions each year to showcase research by students at Southwestern and researchers across the country. The ''Brown Symposium'' held in the early spring is an academic conference attracting guest lecturers and panelists. All Brown Symposium speakers present research that shares the symposium's theme for that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southwestern.edu/academics/brownsymposium/|title=Brown Symposium|accessdate=December 5, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527155719/http://www.southwestern.edu/academics/brownsymposium/|archivedate=May 27, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Creative Works Symposium'' held near the end of the spring semester offers undergraduate students an opportunity to display their own research as a formal oral presentation, panel discussion, poster presentation, art exhibit, or technology demonstration. These student presentations are often the culmination of senior capstone projects, independent studies, collaborations with a faculty member, or a requirement for receiving research grants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southwestern.edu/academics/studentworks/|title=Student Works Symposium|accessdate=December 5, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420003938/http://www.southwestern.edu/academics/studentworks/|archivedate=April 20, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
Southwestern University is located in [[Georgetown, Texas]], about 30 miles (50&amp;nbsp;km) north of [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]. The campus comprises 700 acres (2.8&amp;nbsp;km²) mostly located north of [[Texas State Highway 29|University Avenue]], although the eastern portion of these lands remains largely undeveloped with some portions serving as an EcoLab where faculty and students conduct research. The main campus is organized around a central academic mall formed by a semi-circular grassy area bounded by a pedestrian walkway and academic buildings. Residence halls and on-campus apartments are located to the east and northwest of the academic mall. Sports fields, support facilities, and parking are on the periphery of the main campus.

===Notable buildings===
[[File:Rutlo 3772831372 Southwestern.jpg|thumb|The [[Hugh Roy and Lillie Cullen Building]] in 2009]]
[[File:Dustinc 263451159 Southwestern.jpg|thumb|The Lois Perkins Chapel situated along the Academic Mall]]
The [[Hugh Roy and Lillie Cullen Building]] (formerly called the Administration Building) was built in 1898 in the [[Richardsonian Romanesque]] style and is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The Cullen Building currently houses the administration, business office, alumni relations, and classrooms. Throughout various times in its history, it has also housed the campus [[auditorium]], gymnasium, chapel, and library. It is named in honor of [[Hugh Roy Cullen]] and his wife.

[[Mood-Bridwell Hall]], originally a men's [[dormitory]], was completed in 1908 and currently houses classrooms, faculty offices, a computer lab, the Debbie Ellis Writing Center, and an indoor [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]]. Mood-Bridwell is included in the Cullen Building's listing on the National Register of Historic Places.

The [[A. Frank Smith Library Center]] opened in 1939 as the [[Cody Memorial Library]] and was built as part of a [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] project. It was expanded in 1966 and again in 1989, receiving the new name as a result of the second expansion. In addition to books and periodicals, the library houses a film and audio collection, 24-hour computer lab, maps, sheet music, and special collections for Texas history and culture, [[John Tower]], [[J. Frank Dobie]], [[Jessie Daniel Ames]], [[Herman Melville]], [[Aaron Burr]], [[Edward Blake]], [[Thomas Bewick]], and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southwestern.edu/library/special-collections/collections.html|title=Special Collections in Smith Library Center|accessdate=October 23, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527135104/http://www.southwestern.edu/library/special-collections/collections.html|archivedate=May 27, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lois Perkins Chapel]] was built in 1950 and includes an [[Aeolian-Skinner]] [[pipe organ]]. [[Stained glass]] windows along the east and west sides depict [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] leaders and [[Methodist]] leaders with seals for the educational institutions they were affiliated with.

The [[McCombs Campus Center]] opened in 1998, replacing the Bishops' Memorial Student Union Building and University Commons. It includes dining facilities, the campus bookstore, [[ballroom]]s, and student organization offices. It is named for billionaire entrepreneur and Southwestern alum [[Red McCombs]].

The [[Fayez Sarofim]] School of Fine Arts is housed in the Alma Thomas Fine Arts Building, originally built in 1956 on the former property of the Texas rancher [[John Wesley Snyder (Texas)|John Wesley Snyder]], a Southwestern University benefactor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=
http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fsn13|title=H. Allan Anderson of Lubbock, Texas, "John Wesley Snyder"|work=[[The Handbook of Texas]]|accessdate=April 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fine Arts Building (FAB) has been renovated multiple times, most recently in 1998 and 2008. The FAB houses the 700-seat Alma Thomas Theater, the smaller Jones Theater, the Caldwell-Carvey Foyer, numerous practice rooms, art studios, a black box theater, and an instrumental rehearsal hall.

The [[Wilhelmina Cullen Admission Center]] opened in 2009, moving the admissions office out of the Roy and Lillie Cullen Building. It is Southwestern's first "green" building and was designed to receive Gold [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] certification. Some of the building's features include a bamboo floor in the lobby area, skylights in the center of the building, solar-powered sink faucets and reflective roof shingles. Southwestern plans to turn the area in the original Cullen Building formerly occupied by the Admission Office into a museum. The Admissions Center was named after Wilhelmina Cullen, the daughter of Roy and Lillie Cullen.

==Student activities and organizations==

There are over 90 student organizations on campus. The school hosts chapters of 16 academic honor societies, including a chapter of [[Phi Beta Kappa]] and the founding chapter of the [[Alpha Chi]] honor society. The national co-ed service fraternity [[Alpha Phi Omega]] also has a chapter. Several groups on campus participate in social activism and awareness on campus and in the Austin area, including College Democrats, Students for Environmental Activism and Knowledge (SEAK), Latinos Unidos, EBONY, and [[Amnesty International]]. Religious groups on campus include the national [[Christian fraternity]] Kappa Upsilon Chi, Christian sorority [[Sigma Phi Lambda]], Jewish Student Association, Muslim Student Organization, and Buddhist Meditation Group. Other groups include Habitat for Humanity, Model U.N., and German Club.

===Student government===
Student government is primarily handled by the Student Congress, with each member elected to represent students living in residence halls, Greek houses, and at-large for students living off-campus. The Student Congress is headed by a president elected through popular vote. An independent organization, Student Foundation, serves as a liaison between students, faculty, alumni, and the university's administration. A panel of students and faculty maintain the university's [[honor code]], replacing the Student Judiciary which previously adjudicated violations of the honor code.

===Greek life===

Southwestern hosts eight national social [[fraternities and sororities]] governed by the North-American Interfraternity Council (IFC) and the National Panhellenic Council (NPC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://southwestern.edu/studentlife/orgs/greek.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218022453/http://southwestern.edu/studentlife/orgs/greek.php|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2009-02-18|title=Southwestern University: Student Life|work=southwestern.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; All fraternities occupy houses on the western side of the campus. The sororities do not have dedicated housing, although they maintain chapter rooms in the Lord Caskey Center. Southwestern has a deferred rush allowing incoming students to become familiar with the campus before formal recruitment begins in the early spring. About 1/3 of the student life is involved in Greek life.&lt;ref&gt;http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/southwestern-university-3620&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable people==

===Contributors===
Southwestern has had many financial and non-financial supporters, but some stand out by the magnitude or timeliness of their contributions. During the Great Depression, a conditional gift from Southwestern alumna Louisa Carothers Wiess substantially increased the university's endowment and motivated the university to pay off all its debts. While serving in Congress, [[Lyndon Baines Johnson]] helped Southwestern acquire the Navy V-12 Program during World War II at a time when the university was struggling financially. Former student [[Red McCombs]] contributed financial support for the campus center and an apartment complex. The Brown Foundation, Cullen Foundation, and Mabee Foundation have contributed financial support for multiple construction projects.

Spintronics fundamentally differs from traditional electronics in that, in addition to charge state, electron spins are exploited as a further degree of freedom, with implications in the efficiency of data storage and transfer. Spintronic systems are most often realised in [[Magnetic semiconductor|dilute magnetic semiconductors (DMS)]] and [[Heusler alloy]]s and are of particular interest in the field of [[quantum computing]] and neuromorphic computing.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.academia.edu/37832670/A_Survey_of_Spintronic_Architectures_for_Processing-in-Memory_and_Neural_Networks A Survey of Spintronic Architectures for Processing-in-Memory and Neural Networks]", Journal of Systems Architecture, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Spintronics emerged from discoveries in the 1980s concerning spin-dependent electron transport phenomena in solid-state devices. This includes the observation of spin-polarized electron injection from a ferromagnetic metal to a normal metal by Johnson and Silsbee (1985)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Johnson | first1 = M. | last2 = Silsbee | first2 = R.

== Theory ==
{{main|Spin (physics)}}

The [[Spin (physics)|spin]] of the electron is an intrinsic [[angular momentum]] that is separate from the angular momentum due to its orbital motion. The magnitude of the projection of the electron's spin along an arbitrary axis is &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}\hbar&lt;/math&gt;, implying that the electron acts as a [[Fermion]] by the [[spin-statistics theorem]]. Like orbital angular momentum, the spin has an associated [[magnetic moment]], the magnitude of which is expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;\mu=\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\frac{q}{m_e}\hbar&lt;/math&gt;.

In a solid, the spins of many electrons can act together to affect the magnetic and electronic properties of a material, for example endowing it with a permanent magnetic moment as in a [[ferromagnet]].

In many materials, electron spins are equally present in both the up and the down state, and no transport properties are dependent on spin. A spintronic device requires generation or manipulation of a spin-polarized population of electrons, resulting in an excess of spin up or spin down electrons. The polarization of any spin dependent property X can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;P_X=\frac{X_{\uparrow}-X_{\downarrow}}{X_{\uparrow}+X_{\downarrow}}&lt;/math&gt;.

A net spin polarization can be achieved either through creating an equilibrium energy split between spin up and spin down. Methods include putting a material in a large magnetic field ([[Zeeman effect]]), the exchange energy present in a ferromagnet or forcing the system out of equilibrium. The period of time that such a non-equilibrium population can be maintained is known as the spin lifetime, &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;.

In a diffusive conductor, a [[spin diffusion]] length &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; can be defined as the distance over which a non-equilibrium spin population can propagate. Spin lifetimes of conduction electrons in metals are relatively short (typically less than 1 nanosecond). An important research area is devoted to extending this lifetime to technologically relevant timescales.

[[File:Spin Injection.jpg|right|thumb|A plot showing a spin up, spin down, and the resulting spin polarized population of electrons. Inside a spin injector, the polarization is constant, while outside the injector, the polarization decays exponentially to zero as the spin up and down populations go to equilibrium.]]

The mechanisms of decay for a spin polarized population can be broadly classified as spin-flip scattering and spin dephasing. Spin-flip scattering is a process inside a solid that does not conserve spin, and can therefore switch an incoming spin up state into an outgoing spin down state. Spin dephasing is the process wherein a population of electrons with a common spin state becomes less polarized over time due to different rates of electron spin [[precession]]. In confined structures, spin dephasing can be suppressed, leading to spin lifetimes of milliseconds in semiconductor [[quantum dots]] at low temperatures.

[[Superconductors]] can enhance central effects in spintronics such as magnetoresistance effects, spin lifetimes and dissipationless spin-currents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Linder|first1=Jacob|last2=Robinson|first2=Jason W. A.|title=Superconducting spintronics|journal=Nature Physics|date=2 April 2015|volume=11|issue=4|pages=307–315|issn=1745-2473|doi=10.1038/nphys3242|arxiv = 1510.00713 |bibcode = 2015NatPh..11..307L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.

The simplest method of generating a spin-polarised current in a metal is to pass the current through a [[ferromagnetic]] material. The most common applications of this effect involve giant magnetoresistance (GMR) devices. A typical GMR device consists of at least two layers of ferromagnetic materials separated by a spacer layer. When the two magnetization vectors of the ferromagnetic layers are aligned, the electrical resistance will be lower (so a higher current flows at constant voltage) than if the ferromagnetic layers are anti-aligned. This constitutes a magnetic field sensor.

Two variants of GMR have been applied in devices: (1) current-in-plane (CIP), where the electric current flows parallel to the layers and (2) current-perpendicular-to-plane (CPP), where the electric current flows in a direction perpendicular to the layers.

Other metal-based spintronics devices:
* [[Tunnel magnetoresistance]] (TMR), where CPP transport is achieved by using quantum-mechanical tunneling of electrons through a thin insulator separating ferromagnetic layers.
* [[Spin-transfer torque]], where a current of spin-polarized electrons is used to control the magnetization direction of ferromagnetic electrodes in the device.
* Spin-wave logic devices carry information in the phase. Interference and spin-wave scattering can perform logic operations.

The latter technique was used to overcome the lack of spin-orbit interaction and materials issues to achieve spin transport in [[silicon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Žutić | first1 = I. | last2 = Fabian | first2 = J. | doi = 10.1038/447269a | title = Spintronics: Silicon twists | journal = Nature | volume = 447 | issue = 7142 | pages = 268–269 | year = 2007 | pmid =  17507969| pmc = |bibcode = 2007Natur.447..268Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because external magnetic fields (and stray fields from magnetic contacts) can cause large [[Hall effect]]s and [[magnetoresistance]] in semiconductors (which mimic [[spin-valve]] effects), the only conclusive evidence of spin transport in semiconductors is demonstration of spin [[precession]] and [[dephasing]] in a magnetic field non-collinear to the injected spin orientation, called the [[Hanle effect]].

* Emitter (FM1): Injects spin-polarized hot electrons into the base.
* Base (FM2): Spin-dependent scattering takes place in the base. It also serves as a spin filter.
* Collector (GaAs): A [[Schottky barrier]] is formed at the interface. It only collects electrons that have enough energy to overcome the Schottky barrier, and when states are available in the semiconductor.

The magnetocurrent (MC) is given as:

:&lt;math&gt;MC = \frac{I_{c,p}-I_{c,ap}}{I_{c,ap}}&lt;/math&gt;

And the transfer ratio (TR) is

MTT promises a highly spin-polarized electron source at room temperature.

=== Storage media ===

[[Antiferromagnetism|Antiferromagnetic]] storage media have been studied as an alternative to [[ferromagnetism]],&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g.: Jungwirth, T.,  announcement of a colloqium talk at the physics faculty of a bavarian university, 28 April 2014: ''Relativistic Approaches to Spintronics with Antiferromagnets''. [http://www.physik.uni-regensburg.de/aktuell/KollSS14/Kolloquium-Jungwirth.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; especially since with antiferromagnetic material the bits can be stored as well as with ferromagnetic material. Instead of the usual definition 0&amp;nbsp;-&gt; 'magnetisation upwards', 1&amp;nbsp;-&gt; 'magnetisation downwards', the states can be, e.g., 0&amp;nbsp;-&gt; 'vertically-alternating spin configuration' and 1&amp;nbsp;-&gt; 'horizontally-alternating spin configuration'.&lt;ref&gt;This corresponds mathematically to the transition from the rotation group SO(3) to its relativistic covering,  the "double group" SU(2)&lt;/ref&gt;).

The main advantages of antiferromagnetic material are:

* non-sensitivity against data-damaging perturbations by stray fields due to zero net external magnetization;&lt;ref name = "netzero"&gt;Jungwirth, T., Marti, X., Wadley, P. and Wunderlich, J. (2016). Antiferromagnetic spintronics. Nature Nanotechnology, 11(3), pp.231-241.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* no effect on near particles, implying that antiferromagnetic device elements would not magnetically disturb its neighboring elements;&lt;ref name = "netzero" /&gt;
* far shorter switching times (antiferromagnetic resonance frequency is in the THz range compared to GHz ferromagnetic resonance frequency);&lt;ref name = "adv"&gt;Gomonay, O., Jungwirth, T. and Sinova, J. (2017). Concepts of antiferromagnetic spintronics (Phys. Status Solidi RRL 4/2017). Physica Status Solidi RRL - Rapid Research Letters, 11(4), p.1770319.&lt;/ref&gt;
* broad range of commonly available antiferromagnetic materials including insulators, semiconductors, semimetals, metals, and superconductors.&lt;ref name = "adv" /&gt;

Research is being done into how to read and write information to antiferromagnetic spintronics as their net zero magnetization makes this difficult compared to conventional ferromagnetic spintronics. In modern MRAM, detection and manipulation of ferromagnetic order by magnetic fields has largely been done away with in favor of more efficient and scalable reading and writing by electrical current. Methods of reading and writing information by current rather than fields are also being investigated in antiferromagnets as fields are ineffective anyways. Writing methods currently being investigated in antiferromagnets are through [[spin-transfer torque]] and [[Spin–orbit interaction|spin-orbit torque]] from the [[spin Hall effect]] and the [[Rashba effect]]. Reading information in antiferromagnets via magnetoresistance effects such as [[tunnel magnetoresistance]] is also being explored.&lt;ref&gt;Chappert, C., Fert, A. and Van Dau, F. (2007).

[[Image:Katsuragi28shuku dai15ban.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A sutra mound (Katsuragi [[twenty-eight mansions]] - 15th mound)]]
A {{nihongo|'''sutra mound'''|経塚|kyōzuka}} is an [[archaeological site]] where [[sūtra]]s were buried underground. In [[Japanese Buddhism]], it is a type of good deed, and was done as a type of [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]].

== Description ==
In the [[Nara period]], the practice of copying sutras was the center of Buddhism in the country, and was done as a government project. During the [[Heian period]], however, the idea of [[Pure Land Buddhism]] spread, and with it the objective of doing personal prayer. In the middle part of the Heian period, it was predicted that the [[mappō]] age would come into existence, and it was said that this would start in China and Korea.

The [[Lotus Sutra]] was the main sutra that was buried, but the [[Heart Sutra]], [[Amitabha Sutra]], [[Mahavairocana Tantra]], [[Vajrasekhara Sutra]] were also buried. In other locations, the [[Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings]], Kannon sutra, and opening and closing sutras were also found. The sutras were usually copied onto paper, but materials like clay, copper, pebbles and shells were also used. The sutras were stored in metal vessels called {{nihongo|''kyōzutsu''|経筒}}, and inscriptions were written on them.

The sutra tubes were small, but some hexagon-shaped boxes and two-storied pagoda shapes with affixed ornaments were found. The tubes also had caps on them. The tubes were usually made of metal or ceramics, but bamboo and other containers have also been found. The tubes were buried with ancient mirrors, coins, swords and jewels, and were buried with dehumidification substances like charcoal. The sutra tubes were often buried in sacred places such as mountain summits and on the grounds of Shinto temples. Occasionally they were buried underground or above ground, and stone huts were built to enshrine their contents.

== History ==
For Japanese buildings, in 1007, [[Fujiwara no Michinaga]] built the oldest sutra mound at the summit of Kinpusen, a mountain range in [[Yamato Province]]. He did so because there was a sense of impending danger about the coming of [[mappō]] among the aristocracy, and he wanted to prepare for the coming of [[Maitreya]] and ensure that the sutras would be passed along to future generations.

In the middle of the 12th century, a monk who traveled around the country went around handing out copies of the sutras to the masses as a way of improving his spirit and puja.

== Recent times ==
Since they were first buried, the small sutra tubes have decayed, so instead, sutra words have been written on small flat stones. Mounds containing stones where one character has been written on each, and mounds with multiple characters on each stone, became more popular. There are places where the stones were buried and covered up and a memorial stone was placed.

In recent centuries, an increase in agriculture and the permeation of a monetary economy has moved religious actions to the background. Giving copied sutras to temples has become standard as a way to spread knowledge about the sutras.

==Clay tile sutras==
While the ritual burial of sūtra, typically on paper, is known from over two thousand two hundred sites, at several that date to the late-Heian period, {{nihongo|clay tile sutras|瓦経|gakyō}} have been found.&lt;ref name="Tokuno"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asian-studies.org/absts/2000abst/Inter/I-136.htm |title=Gakyô: Clay Tile Sutras and the Preservation of the Buddhist Canon in Medieval Japan |author=Tokuno Kyoko |publisher=[[Association for Asian Studies]] |year=2000 |accessdate=28 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text was incised into clay tiles that were then [[Pottery#Firing|low fired]]; the selection of a more durable medium may have had some symbolic significance.&lt;ref name="Tokuno"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.rekihaku.ac.jp/english/publication/titles/titles_pdf/093003.pdf |title=Gakyo, for the Aim to be Reborn in Paradise: by the Restoration of Gakyo Buried at Ise-Komachizuka and Ise-Bodaisan |author=Muraki Jiro |journal=[[Bulletin of the National Museum of Japanese History]] |year=2002 |volume=93 |publisher=[[National Museum of Japanese History]] |language=Japanese, English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several examples have been excavated in [[Fukuoka Prefecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.city.itoshima.lg.jp/site/bunkazai/gakyou.html |script-title=ja:瓦経 |trans-title=Tile Sutra |language=Japanese |publisher=[[Itoshima, Fukuoka|Itoshima City]] |accessdate=28 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://museum.city.fukuoka.jp/je/html/301-310/310/310_01.htm |script-title=ja:福岡の瓦経 |trans-title=Clay Tile Sutras of Fukuoka |language=Japanese |publisher=[[Fukuoka City Museum]] |accessdate=28 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A clay tile sutra mound in [[Itano, Tokushima|Itano]] is among the [[Historic Sites of Tokushima Prefecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pref.tokushima.jp/docs/2012061800015/files/tokushimabunkazaiitirann.xls

'''The Global Lepidoptera Names Index''' ('''LepIndex''') is a searchable [[database]] maintained by the Department of Entomology at the [[Natural History Museum, London]].

It is based on card indices and scanned journals, nomenclatural catalogues and the ''[[Zoological Record]]''. It contains the majority of world's Lepidoptera names published up until 1981 and for some groups is up to date.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/data/lepindex/intro.html The Global Lepidoptera Names Index Introduction]. Retrieved  2011-01-4&lt;/ref&gt;

The Global Lepidoptera Names Index or LepIndex allows anyone free internet access to:
:the zoological authority who named a butterfly or moth species 
:where the original description was published
:status of the name ([[Valid name (zoology)|valid name]] or [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]])

It is the main source of Lepidoptera names in the [[Integrated Taxonomic Information System]] and [[Catalogue of Life]].

'''The Institute of World Politics''' ('''IWP''') is a [[graduate school]] of [[national security]], [[Military intelligence|intelligence]], and [[international relations|international affairs]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]. It was founded in 1990 to develop leaders in the intelligence, [[national security]], and [[Diplomacy|diplomatic communities]], while teaching the ethical exercise of [[Power in international relations|statecraft]]. The curriculum exposes students to international realities, including history, political culture, current and potential threats, and the strategic role of ideas, values, and belief systems in world politics. It emphasizes various elements of statecraft, including: [[counterintelligence]]; [[counterpropaganda]]; [[economic warfare|economic statecraft]] and [[Military science|warfare]]; [[information operations]]; [[political warfare]]; strategic soft power; and [[public diplomacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailycaller.com/2011/12/04/leaders-with-ginni-thomas-john-lenczowski-institute-of-world-politics/|title=Leaders with Ginni Thomas: John Lenczowski, Institute of World Politics|author=Ginni Thomas|date=4 December 2011|work=The Daily Caller}}&lt;/ref&gt; The faculty is composed almost entirely of senior scholar-practitioners from the relevant fields. IWP offers five [[Master of Arts]] degrees: M.A. in Statecraft and National Security Affairs, M.A. in Statecraft and International Affairs, M.A. in Strategic Intelligence Studies, M.A. in Strategic and International Studies (Professional), and Executive M.A. in National Security Affairs. It also offers Certificates of Graduate Study and continuing education courses.

==Founding and history==
IWP was founded in 1990 by [[John Lenczowski]], the former Director of European and [[the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet Affairs]] at the [[United States National Security Council]] during the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration.&lt;ref name=humanevents&gt;Conservative Spotlight, "John Lenczowski's Institute of World Politics," ''Human Events'' Vol. 50 Issue 1 (1/14/1994): 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Lenczowski’s stated purpose for establishing the Institute was to develop a graduate school and curriculum that integrates “all the instruments of statecraft,” teaching students to apply them across the spectrum of conflict while remaining grounded in American [[United States Declaration of Independence|founding principles]] and the rule of [[public international law|international law]].&lt;ref&gt;Lenczowski, John (2011). ''Full Spectrum Diplomacy and Grand Strategy.''Lexington Books. xii–xiv {{ISBN|0739150650}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="humanevents" /&gt;

From 1991–2005, IWP maintained an affiliation with [[Boston University]].&lt;ref name=humanevents /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diplomatdc.wordpress.com/nssp/|title=NSSP|work=The DC World Affairs Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; This affiliation ended in 2006 as IWP attained independent and full accreditation by the [[Middle States Commission on Higher Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msche.org/institutions_view.asp?idinstitution=278|title=Middle States Commission on Higher Education|author=Info724 Ltd.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, IWP became one of 17 academic institutions that is qualified by the [[U.S. Army]] to host Senior Service Fellows.&lt;ref&gt;http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/IPO/repository/SSC_Schools_%20Info_Catalog_AY12-13[1].pdf{{dead link|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
The Institute of World Politics offers one Doctor of Statecraft and National Security program, five Master of Arts degrees, and 17 Certificates of Graduate Study. It houses the Kosciuszko Chair of Polish Studies, the Center for Culture and Security, and the Center for Human Rights and International Affairs.  IWP also offers Frontiers, a ten-week program in American strategy and statecraft for national security and business professionals.

==International partners==
Qualifying students have the opportunity to participate in an intensive, four-week program of tutorials at the [[University of Oxford]] in England, as coordinated through the Washington International Studies Council.  Successful completion of the program counts toward four-credits of IWP coursework as a general elective. 
Study takes place on the campus of New College,   This unique program includes:
* An Oxford-themed seminar: weekly one-on-one tutorials with an Oxford don that include critique and discussion of student essays
* Access to various lectures by Oxford academics and leading figures in British politics
* The option to attend performances at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre (Stratford) and the Globe Theatre (London)
* Tours of museums in Oxford, London, and Cambridge.

==Students==
The 150 member student body is composed of approximately 65% recent graduates planning to pursue careers in national security, foreign policy, or intelligence; and about 35% mid-career professionals in those fields seeking additional knowledge and credentials.  Students have come to IWP from across the United States as well as approximately 60 countries, the United States armed forces, and United States Government.  Though many IWP students and professors hold security clearances, this is not a prerequisite for studying at IWP, as all coursework,  takes place at an unclassified level. A majority of IWP graduates gain employment in national security, foreign affairs, and intelligence agencies.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Campus==
The Institute of World Politics is located in the Dupont Circle neighborhood of Washington, D.C. Its campus consists of two buildings, the Marlatt Mansion and Bently Hall, both of which contain classrooms and administrative offices. [[Donald E.

==Funding==

Don Bently purchased the Marlatt Mansion and two adjacent townhouses for the Institute. For the first 15 years, he rented the building to the Institute for $1.00 per year. He paid several million dollars to gut and completely renovate the townhouses and later donated them to the Institute. He also endowed the Donald E. Bently Chair of Political Economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=IWP mourns the passing of longtime supporter Donald E.

This is a list of important landmarks in the history of systematic [[Philosophy|philosophical]] inquiry and [[Scientific method|scientific analysis]] of [[phenomena]]. The list seeks to highlight important stages in the development of thoughts and analysis towards conceptualizing and understanding phenomena. This list seeks to include all major landmarks in systematic analysis of phenomena across disciplines that seeks to implement formal methods and systematic formal analysis of phenomena. Thus it seeks to list major landmarks across all scientific philosophy and methodological sciences including [[physical sciences]], [[scientific philosophy (disambiguation)|scientific philosophy]], [[Formal science|formal disciplines]] or pure sciences, [[behavioural sciences]], [[social sciences]], [[biological sciences]], [[life sciences]] and other related disciplines.

|1958|| [[William Phillips (economist)|William Phillips]], introduced [[Phillips curve]] in economic theory. He described the observation of an inverse relationship between money wage changes and unemployment in the British economy over the period examined. In 1960 [[Paul Samuelson]] and [[Robert Solow]] took Phillips' work and made explicit the link between inflation and unemployment: when inflation was high, unemployment was low, and vice versa.||Economic theory, economics, sociology, philosophy

'''Urethral intercourse''' or ''coitus per urethram'' is [[sexual penetration]] of the female [[urethra]] by an object such as a [[Human penis|penis]] or a finger.  It is not the same thing as [[urethral sounding]], the act of inserting a specialized medical tool into the urethra as a form of sexual or fetishistic activity.

The untrained [[Urethral foreign body|insertion]] of foreign bodies into the urethra carries a significant risk that subsequent medical attention may be required.  Documented cases of urethral intercourse appear to have occurred between heterosexual couples;  a survey of the global medical literature available in 1965 reported accounts of thirteen separate cases.&lt;ref name=JAMA1965&gt;{{cite journal

'''Virgilio Cardinal Noè''' (30 March 1922 – 24 July 2011) was an Italian Catholic prelate.

{{infobox cardinalstyles|cardinal name=Virgilio Noè|dipstyle=[[His Eminence]]|offstyle=Your Eminence|relstyle=[[Monsignor]]|See=Voncaria (Titular)|deathstyle=|image = Coat of arms of Virgilio Noè.svg| image_size = 200px|}}

==Early Life and Ministry==

Virgilio Noè was born in 1922 in [[Zelata di Bereguardo]], Lombardy, where the house is marked by a commemorative plaque. He studied at the Seminary of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Pavia|Pavia]]  and was ordained a priest on 1 October 1944 by the Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Pavia|Pavia]], [[Carlo Allorio]]. After ordination he became parish priest of the parish of ''San Salvatore'' in [[Pavia]] and founded a youth association with the aim especially of promoting participation in the Liturgy.

In 1948  [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Pavia|Bishop]], [[Carlo Allorio|Allorio]] sent him to Rome for studies at the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]], where he gained a doctorate in [[ecclesiastical history]] in 1952,{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} with a thesis entitled ''La politica religiosa dei re longobardi'' (''The Religious Policies of the Lombard Kings'').

On returning to the diocese he taught [[History of Christianity|Ecclesiastical History]], [[Patristics]], Liturgy and [[Catholic Church art|Art History]] in the  seminaries of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Pavia|Pavia]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Tortona|Tortona]]. In this period he was also   spiritual director in the ''Collegio Sant'Agostino'' and the ''Collegio San Giorgio'', and played a leading role in the diocesan liturgical commission. Among the projects undertaken were diocesan [[Eucharistic Congress]]es in 1956 and 1964, in the first of which the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Milan|Archbishop of Milan]], [[Giovanni Battista Montini]] took part.

==Activity in Rome==

In the years 1964-1969, starting therefore during the period of the [[Second Vatican Council]], he was in charge of the national ''Centro di Azione Liturgica'' (''Centre for Liturgical Action'') in Rome, and editor of its journal ''Liturgia''. He was also lecturer in [[Catholic Church art|Sacred Art]] at the recently founded [[Pontifical Institute of Sacred Liturgy|Pontifical Liturgical Institute]] of  Sant'Anselmo in the city, and when a commission was formed to revise the papal liturgical celebrations, he was made a member. From 1966 to 1968 he also served as vice-rector of the Pontifical Lombard Seminary (''Pontificio Seminario Lombardo dei SS. Ambrogio e Carlo'') in [[Rome]].

When the Sacred [[Congregation for Divine Worship]] (''Sacra Congregatio pro Cultu Divino'') was established in 1969 to take over the historical brief for liturgical affairs handled since 1588 by the Sacred Congregation of Rites (''Sacra Rituum Congregatio''), Mons. Noè was appointed its Undersecretary and held the post until the [[Congregation for Divine Worship|Congregation]]'s short life came to an end. In the meantime, in 1970, [[Pope Paul VI]]  appointed him [[Master of ceremonies]], a post now renamed for the first time ''[[Office for the Liturgical Celebrations of the Supreme Pontiff|Master of Pontifical Liturgical Celebrations]]'' and which he held until his appointment as a bishop in 1982, when Mons. [[John Magee (bishop)|John Magee]] was appointed to succeed him. In the same period he was chaplain to what is since called the Papal Gendarmeria.

During his period in the office, the challenge for Mons. Noè was to find ways of apply the governing principles and the practical norms of the new liturgical books that were gradually being revised and published to unique circumstances of the papal liturgy. The papal liturgy is in many respects seen as a model, but is also almost always televised and has some papal rites which in the nature of things are peculiar to it. The results of  Mons. Noè's work were generally considered a success. The new papal practice which he established was moderate and sober, had dignity, but was devoid of flamboyance. The Masses and the more frequent liturgies for e beatifications and canonizations, but also the special ceremonies called for by the Jubilee of 1975, the funeral of Paul VI and the inauguration of the pontificates of his  successors, were all given a new shape. The issuing of tasteful booklets for the people that were collector's items in their own right became a consolidated practice.

Throughout this period, Mons. Noè's career then followed the complicated course of successive partial internal organizations of the Roman Curia. When in the summer of 1975 the Sacred [[Congregation for Divine Worship]] was amalgamated with the Sacred [[Congregation for the Discipline of the Sacraments]] (''Sacra Congregatio de Disciplina Sacramentorum'') (founded in 1908 by [[Pope Pius X]]) to form a Sacred [[Congregation for the Sacraments and Divine Worship]] (''Sacra Congregatio de Sacramentis et Cultu Divino''), Mons. Noè was appointed Undersecretary in charge of liturgical affairs.

==Archbishop and Cardinal==

On 30 January 1982 Mons. Noè was promoted to the rank of Secretary in the Sacred [[Congregation for the Sacraments and Divine Worship]] (''Sacra Congregatio de Sacramentis et Cultu Divino''), and simultaneously made [[Titular see|Titular]] [[Archbishop]] of [[Voncaria]]. He was ordained a bishop on 6 March 1982 in St Peter's Basilica by [[Pope John Paul II]], assisted by Archbishop [[Eduardo Martínez Somalo]] and Bishop [[Antonio Giuseppe Angioni]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Pavia|Bishop of Pavia]]. Archbishop,  later Cardinal, [[Eduardo Martínez Somalo|Martínez]], was at the time ''Sostituto'' or Substitute for General Affairs of the [[Secretariat of State]]. In his new rank the now Archbishop Noè had again a particular status within the Congregation as being specifically in charge of a distinct section for Divine Worship.

Between 1984 and 1988 the dicastery was briefly redivided into the Congregation for the Sacraments (''Congregatio de Sacramentis'') and the  [[Congregation for Divine Worship]]  (''Congregatio de Cultu Divino'') under a single Prefect. In this new version of the latter, Archbishop Noè was the sole Archbishop Secretary, according to the classic system. Then, as a result of the [[Apostolic Constitution]] ''[[Pastor Bonus]]'' of 1988, this move was reversed and there emerged the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments  (''Sacra Congregatio de Cultu Divino de et Disciplina Sacramentorum''), which still exists. In this new entity,  Archbishop Noè was no longer the sole Archbishop Secretary, but reverted to being once more Archbishop Secretary but in charge of a distinct section for Divine Worship.

The habits of the Roman Curia at the time foresaw what was called the zigzag system, whereby in order to achieve promotion at the higher ranks, it was necessary to move from one dicastery to another, each move being accompanied by a promotion in rank. Based on no private information, but on the known zigzag principle, it was clear that for a further promotion, there had to be a move to some other part of the Curia. In fact, when the building blocks of a wider series of curial changes were in place, Archbishop Noè was soon transferred to a completely different area and became  Delegate of the [[Fabric of St. Peter]], an entity that is not part of the [[Roman Curia]], but recognized by the 1988 apostolic constitution ''[[Pastor bonus]]'' as "closely associated with the [[Holy See]]."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ewtn.com/library/papaldoc/jp2pastr.htm ''Pastor Bonus'' Part IX], EWTN.com, accessed 3 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The appointment took effect on 24 May 1989. In formal terms the new posting was of equivalent rank to Archbishop Noè's previous appointment. However, it was clearly a promotion in that he was now the number two of an organization that had considerable administrative and financial autonomy and a large workforce, perhaps 6-7 times as many as his former Congregation and perhaps 20 times as many as its liturgical section. Moreover, the elderly head of the [[Fabric of St. Peter]], [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinal]] [[Aurelio Sabattani]] (1983-1991), was not then in robust health, so authority resided in practice with Archbishop Noè, who in fact was given additionally the title of [[Coadjutor bishop|Coadjutor]] [[Archpriest]] of [[St. Peter's Basilica]].

The new Delegate took charge and ruled with a firm hand. While the public saw nothing of internal organization matters, it could not but notice how the place gleamed. In a setting where there was in reality limited scope for radical innovation, he nevertheless brought his background in art history and his esthetic good taste to bear. Given his long period of office, which lasted unusually until he reached the age of 80, the cumulative effects of his policies were considerable.

Archbishop Noè was created [[Cardinal-Deacon]] of ''S. Giovanni Bosco in Via Tuscolana'' in the consistory of 28 June 1991 by [[Pope John Paul II]]. Three days later, he was made [[Archpriest]] of the [[St. Peter's Basilica]], and hence President of the [[Fabric of St. Peter]]. Moreover, as a consequence of the measures established by the papal Chirograph of 14 January 1991 regulating the office of Vicar General of the Vatican City, on becoming Archpriest, he also automatically assumed that post.&lt;ref name="Holy See bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/news_services/press/documentazione/documents/cardinali_biografie/cardinali_bio_noe_v_en.html|title=NOÈ, Card. Virgilio|publisher=Holy See Press Office|date=3 December 2004|accessdate=18 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1993 to  1996 he was additionally President of the Cardinalatial Commission for the Pontifical Shrines of Pompei, Loreto and  Bari.

As is the custom, after 10 years as Cardinal-Deacon, Cardinal Noè took the option of petitioning to be elevated to the rank of Cardinal-Priest with the [[titular church]] of ''[[Regina Apostolorum]]'' as of 26 February 2002. He briefly attracted attention when he claimed that [[Pope Paul VI]] spoke of the "smoke of Satan" in the Catholic Church, he was referring to priests who celebrated Mass badly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wdtprs.com/blog/2008/05/petrus-amazing-interview-with-card-noe-paul-vis-smoke-of-satan-remark-concerned-liturgy Interview with Cardinal Noè: Paul VI's “smoke of Satan” remark concerned liturgy from "What Does The Prayer Really Say?"] by Fr. John Zuhlsdorf at PETRUS&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and Burial==
On 24 July 2011, Cardinal Noè died in Rome at the age of 89.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/cardinal-who-cared-for-upkeep-of-st-peters-basilica-other-vatican-monuments-dies-in-rome/2011/07/24/gIQAH4OoWI_story.html|title=Cardinal, who cared for upkeep of St. Peter's Basilica, other Vatican monuments, dies in Rome|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His funeral Mass was celebrated on 26 July 2011 in the apse of  [[St. Peter's Basilica]], by Cardinal [[Angelo Sodano]], Dean of the College of Cardinals and concelebrated by a large number of Cardinals and bishops. He is buried in the cemetery of Campo Verano, Rome.

[[File:Atmospheric_electromagnetic_opacity.svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Atmospheric_electromagnetic_opacity.svg|thumb|A diagram of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] with the Earth's atmospheric transmittance (or opacity) and the types of telescopes used to image parts of the spectrum.]]'''Visible-light astronomy''' encompasses a wide variety of [[observation]]s via [[telescope]]s that are sensitive in the range of [[visible light]] ([[optical telescope]]s). Visible-light astronomy is part of optical astronomy, and differs from astronomies based on invisible types of light in the [[Electromagnetic spectrum|electromagnetic radiation spectrum]], such as [[Radio astronomy|radio waves]], [[Infrared astronomy|infrared waves]], [[Ultraviolet astronomy|ultraviolet waves]], [[X-ray astronomy|X-ray waves]] and [[gamma-ray astronomy|gamma-ray waves]]. Visible light ranges from 380 to 750 [[Nanometre|nanometers]] in [[wavelength]]. 

Visible-light astronomy has existed as long as people have been looking up at the night sky, although it has since improved in its observational capabilities since the invention of the telescope, which is commonly credited to [[Hans Lippershey]], a German-Dutch spectacle-maker,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KAWwzHlDVksC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=Hans+Lippershey+inventor+of+the+telescope.&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=uJKiTJvkIsP6lweQ4dHbAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Hans%20Lippershey%20inventor%20of%20the%20telescope.&amp;f=false|title=The History of the Telescope|last=King|first=Henry C.|date=2003|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=9780486432656|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Galileo played a large role in the development and creation of telescopes. Visible-light astronomy continues to advance in the modern day, with projects such as the [[James Webb Space Telescope|James Webb Telescope]] being projected for launch in the next few years. 

Since visible-light astronomy is restricted to only visible light, no equipment is necessary for simply [[Amateur astronomy|star gazing]]. This means that it's the most commonly participated in type of astronomy, as well as the oldest.  

==History==
===Beginning===
{{Main|Galileo Galilei}}Before the advent of telescopes, astronomy was limited solely to unaided eyesight. Humans have been looking at stars and objects in the night sky for thousands of years, as is evident in the naming of many constellations, notably the largely Greek names used today. [[File:Bertini fresco of Galileo Galilei and Doge of Venice.jpg|thumb|right|Fresco by [[Giuseppe Bertini]] depicting Galileo showing the [[Doge of Venice]] how to use the telescope]]

[[Hans Lippershey]], a German-Dutch spectacle-maker, is commonly credited as being the first to invent the [[telescope]]. [[Hans Lippershey|Lippershey]] is the first recorded person to apply for a patent for a telescope,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; however it is unclear if [[Hans Lippershey|Lippershey]] was the first to build a telescope. Based only on uncertain descriptions of the [[telescope]] which [[Hans Lippershey|Lippershey]] tried to obtain a patent for, Galileo made a telescope with about 3x magnification in the following year. Galileo later made improved versions with up to 30x magnification.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} With a [[Refracting telescope#Galileo's telescope|Galilean telescope]] the observer could see magnified, upright images on the earth—it was what is commonly known as a terrestrial telescope or a spyglass. Galileo could also use it to observe the sky, and for a time was one of those who could construct telescopes good enough for that purpose. On 25 August 1609, Galileo demonstrated one of his early telescopes, with a magnification of up to 8 or 9, to [[Venice|Venetian]] lawmakers. Galileo's telescopes were also a profitable sideline; selling them to merchants who found them useful both at sea and as items of trade. He published his initial telescopic astronomical observations in March 1610 in a brief treatise entitled ''[[Sidereus Nuncius]]'' (''Starry Messenger'').&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt]] (1994, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-TgYAq3P0P8C&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;f=false pp. 1–2])&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern day ===
In the modern day, visible-light astronomy is still practiced by many [[Amateur astronomy|amateur astronomers]], especially since [[Telescope|telescopes]] are much more widely available for the public, as compared to when they were first being invented. Government agencies, such as [[NASA]], are very involved in the modern day research and observation of visible objects and [[Astronomical object|celestial bodies]]. In the modern day, the highest quality pictures and data are obtained via [[Space telescope|space telescopes]]; [[Telescope|telescopes]] that are outside of the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]]. This allows for much clearer observations, as the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] is not disrupting the image and [[Astronomical seeing|viewing quality]] of the telescope, meaning objects can be observed in much greater detail, and much more distant or low-light objects may be observed. Additionally, this means that observations are able to be made at any time, rather than only during the night.

==== Hubble Space Telescope ====
{{Main|Hubble Space Telescope}}
The [[Hubble Space Telescope]] is a [[space telescope]] created by [[NASA]], and was launched into [[low Earth orbit]] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/postsecondary/features/F_NASA_Great_Observatories_PS.html|title=NASA - NASA's Great Observatories|website=www.nasa.gov|language=en|others=http://teachspacescience.org/graphics/pdf/10000870.pdf, http://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/, http://chandra.harvard.edu/, http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is still in operation today. The [[Hubble Space Telescope]]'s four main instruments observe in the [[Ultraviolet|near ultraviolet]], [[Visible spectrum|visible]], and [[Infrared|near infrared]] [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectra]]. Hubble's images are some of the most detailed images ever taken, leading to many breakthroughs in [[astrophysics]], such as accurately determining the rate of [[expansion of the universe]].

== Optical telescopes ==
{{Main|Optical telescope}}
There are three main types of telescopes used in visible-light astronomy:

*[[Refracting telescope|Refracting telescopes]], which use lenses to form the image. Commonly used by amateur astronomers, especially for viewing brighter objects such as the [[Moon]], and [[Planet|planets]], due to lower cost and ease of usage.
*[[Reflecting telescope|Reflecting telescopes]], which use mirrors to form the image. Commonly used for scientific purposes.
*[[Catadioptric Telescope|Catadioptric telescopes]], which use a combination of lenses and mirrors to form the image; essentially a combination of [[Refracting telescope|refracting]] and [[Reflecting telescope|reflecting]] telescopes.

Each type of telescope suffers from different types of [[Optical aberration|aberration]]; [[Refracting telescope|refracting telescopes]] have [[chromatic aberration]], which causes colors to be shown on edges separating light and dark parts of the image, where there should not be such colors. This is due to the lens being unable to focus all colors to the same convergence point.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marimont|first=David H.|last2=Wandell|first2=Brian A.|date=1994-12-01|title=Matching color images: the effects of axial chromatic aberration|url=https://www.osapublishing.org/josaa/abstract.cfm?uri=josaa-11-12-3113|journal=JOSA A|language=EN|volume=11|issue=12|pages=3113–3122|doi=10.1364/JOSAA.11.003113|issn=1520-8532}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reflecting telescope|Reflecting telescopes]] suffer from several types of optical inaccuracies, such as off-axis aberrations near the edges of the field of view. Catadioptric telescopes vary in the types of optical inaccuracies present, as there are numerous catadioptric telescope designs. 

==Effect of ambient brightness==
[[File:Light_pollution_europe.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Light_pollution_europe.jpg|thumb|Light pollution map of Europe]]The visibility of celestial objects in the night sky is affected by light pollution, with the presence of the [[Moon]] in the night sky historically hindering astronomical observation by increasing the amount of ambient lighting. With the advent of artificial light sources, however, [[light pollution]] has been a growing problem for viewing the night sky. Special filters and modifications to light fixtures can help to alleviate this problem, but for the best views, both professional and amateur optical astronomers seek viewing sites located far from major urban areas. In order to avoid light pollution of Earth's sky, among other reasons, many telescopes are put outside of the Earth's atmosphere, where not only light pollution, but also atmospheric distortion and obscuration are minimized. 

== Commonly observed objects ==
The most commonly observed objects tend to be ones that do not require a telescope to view, such as the [[Moon]], [[Meteoroid|meteors]], [[Planet|planets]], [[Constellation|constellations]], and [[Star|stars]].

The [[Moon]] is a very commonly observed astronomical object, especially by [[Amateur astronomy|amateur astronomers]] and [[Skygazing|skygazers]]. This is due to several reasons: the Moon is the brightest object in the night sky, the Moon is the largest object in the night sky, and the Moon has long been significant in many cultures, such as being the basis for many calendars. The Moon also does not require any kind of telescope or binoculars to see effectively, making it extremely convenient and common for people to observe.

[[Meteoroid|Meteors]], often called "shooting stars" are also commonly observed. [[Meteor shower|Meteor showers]], such as the [[Perseids]] and [[Leonids]], make viewing meteors much easier, as a multitude of meteors are visible in a relatively short period of time.

[[Planet|Planets]] are usually observed with the aid of a telescope or binoculars. [[Venus]] is likely the easiest planet to observe without the aid of any instruments, as it is very bright, and can even be seen in daylight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1995JBAA..105..311E|title=1995JBAA..105..311E Page 311|website=adsabs.harvard.edu|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], and [[Saturn]] can also be seen without the aid of telescopes or binoculars.

[[Constellation|Constellations]] and [[Star|stars]] are also often observed, and have been used in the past for navigation, especially by ships at sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://timeandnavigation.si.edu/navigating-at-sea/navigating-without-a-clock/celestial-navigation|title=Celestial Navigation {{!}} Time and Navigation|website=timeandnavigation.si.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most recognizable constellations is the [[Big Dipper]], which is part of the constellation [[Ursa Major]]. Constellations also serve to help describe the location of other objects in the sky.

{{Chinese folk religion}}
'''''Wu''''' ({{zh|c=巫|p=''wū''|w=''wu''|l=[[shaman]]}}) are spirit mediums who have practiced divination, prayer, sacrifice, rainmaking, and healing in Chinese traditions dating back over 3,000 years.

==The word ''wu''==
The [[Chinese language|Chinese]] word ''wu'' {{linktext|巫}} "spirit medium; shaman; shamaness; sorcerer; doctor; proper names" was first recorded during the [[Shang Dynasty]] (ca. 1600–1046 BCE), when a ''wu'' could be of either sex. During the late [[Zhou Dynasty]] (1045-256 BCE) ''wu'' was used to specify "female shaman; sorceress" as opposed to ''xi'' 覡 "male shaman; sorcerer" (which first appears in the 4th century BCE [[Guoyu (book)|''Guoyu'']]). Other sex-differentiated shaman names include ''nanwu'' 男巫 for "male shaman; sorcerer; wizard"; and ''nüwu'' 女巫, ''wunü'' 巫女, ''wupo'' 巫婆, and ''wuyu'' 巫嫗 for "female shaman; sorceress; witch".

''Wu'' is used in compounds like ''[[Gu (poison)|wugu]]'' 巫蠱 "sorcery; cast harmful spells", ''wushen'' 巫神 or ''shenwu'' 神巫 (with [[Shen (Chinese religion)|''shen'']] "spirit; god") "wizard; sorcerer", and ''wuxian'' 巫仙 (with [[Xian (Taoism)|''xian'']] "immortal; alchemist") "immortal shaman".

The word ''[[Tongji (spirit medium)|tongji]]'' 童乩 (lit. "youth diviner") "shaman; spirit-medium" is a near-synonym of ''wu''. Chinese uses phonetic [[transliteration into Chinese characters|transliteration]] to distinguish native ''wu'' from "[[Shamanism in Siberia|Siberian shaman]]": ''saman'' 薩滿 or ''saman'' 薩蠻. "Shaman" is occasionally written with Chinese Buddhist transcriptions of [[Shramana]] "wandering monk; ascetic": ''shamen'' 沙門, ''sangmen'' 桑門, or ''sangmen'' 喪門.

[[Joseph Needham]] (1954:134) suggests "shaman" was transliterated ''xianmen'' 羨門 in the name of [[Zou Yan]]'s disciple Xianmen Gao 羨門高 (or Zigao 子高). He quotes the ''[[Shiji]]'' that Emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]] (r. 221–210 BCE), "wandered about on the shore of the eastern sea, and offered sacrifices to the famous mountains and the great rivers and the eight Spirits; and searched for ''[[Xian (Taoism)|xian]]'' "immortals", [''xianmen''], and the like." Needham (1954:134) compares two later Chinese terms for "shaman": ''shanman'' 珊蛮, which described the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] leader [[Wanyan Xiyin]], and ''sizhu'' 司祝, which was used for imperial [[Manchu]] shamans during the [[Qing Dynasty]].

===Translations===
''Shaman'' is the common English translation of Chinese ''wu'', but some scholars (de Groot 1910, Mair 1990:35) maintain that the Siberian ''shaman'' and Chinese ''wu'' were historically and culturally different shamanic traditions. [[Arthur Waley]] (1955:9) defines ''wu'' as "spirit-intermediary" and says, "Indeed the functions of the Chinese ''wu'' were so like those of Siberian and Tunguz shamans that it is convenient (as has indeed been done by Far Eastern and European writers) to use shaman as a translation of ''wu''. In contrast, Schiffeler (1976:20) describes the "untranslatableness" of ''wu'', and prefers using the romanization "''wu'' instead of its contemporary English counterparts, "witches," "warlocks," or "shamans"," which have misleading connotations. Taking ''wu'' to mean "female shaman", [[Edward H. Schafer]] translates it as (1951:153) "shamaness" and (1980:11) "shamanka". The transliteration-translation "''wu'' shaman" or "''wu''-shaman" (Unschuld 1985:344) implies "Chinese" specifically and "shamanism" generally. ''Wu'', concludes Falkenhausen (1995:280), "may be rendered as "shaman" or, perhaps, less controversially as "spirit medium"." Paper (1995:85) criticizes "the majority of scholars" who use one word ''shaman'' to translate many Chinese terms (''wu'' 巫, ''xi'' 覡, ''yi'' 毉, ''xian'' 仙, and ''zhu'' 祝), and writes, "The general tendency to refer to all ecstatic religious functionaries as shamans blurs functional differences."
]
===Pronunciations===
The [[Modern Standard Chinese]] pronunciation of 巫 is ''wu'', which [[historical Chinese phonology|phonologically]] descends from (ca. 6th century CE) [[Middle Chinese]] and (ca. 6th century BCE) [[Old Chinese]]. Compare these Middle and Old Chinese reconstructions of ''wu'' 巫: ''m&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;u'' &lt; *''m&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;wo'' ([[Bernhard Karlgren]]), ''mjuo'' &lt; *''{{IPA|mjwaɣ}}'' (Zhou Fagao), *''mjag'' ([[Li Fanggui]]), ''mju'' &lt; *''ma'' (Axel Schuessler), and *''m&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;ag'' ([[Victor H. Mair]]) . Linguists disagree whether ''wu'' had an Old Chinese [[velar]] final ''-g'' or ''-ɣ''. This 巫 is pronounced ''mouh'' in [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]], ''vu'' in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], ''mu'' in [[Korean language|Korean]], and ''fu'' or ''[[miko]]'' in [[Japanese language|Japanese]].

===Characters===

The contemporary [[Chinese character]] [[Wikt:巫|巫]] for ''wu'' combines the graphic [[Radical (Chinese character)|radicals]] ''gong'' [[Wikt:工|工]] "work" and ''ren'' [[Wikt:人|人]] "person" doubled (cf. ''cong'' [[Wikt:从|从]]). This 巫 character developed from [[Seal script]] characters that depicted dancing shamans, which descend from [[Bronzeware script]] and [[Oracle bone script]] characters that resembled a [[cross potent]].

The first [[Chinese dictionary]] of characters, the (121 CE) ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'' defines ''wu'' as ''zhu'' [[Wikt:祝|祝]] "sacrifice; prayer master; invoker; priest" (祝也 女能以舞降神者也 象从工 两人舞形, tr. Hopkins 1920:432) and analyzes the Seal graph, "An Invoker. A woman who can serve the Invisible, and by posturing bring down the spirits. Depicts a person with two sleeves posturing."  This Seal graph for ''wu'' is interpreted as showing "the 工 work of two dancing figures set to each other – a shamanistic dance" (Karlgren 1923:363) or "two human figures facing some central object (possibly a pole, or in a tent-like enclosure?)" (Schafer 1951:153).

This dictionary also includes a variant [[Great Seal script]] (called a ''guwen'' "ancient script") that elaborates ''wu'' 巫.  Hopkins (1920:433) analyzes this ''guwen'' graph as ''gong'' 廾 "two hands held upward" at the bottom (like ''shi'' 筮's Seal graph) and two "mouths" with the "sleeves" on the sides; or (1920:424) "jade" because the ''Shuowen'' defines ''ling'' 靈 "spiritual; divine" as synonymous with ''wu'' and depicting (巫以玉事神, tr. Hopkins 1920:424), "an inspired shaman serving the Spirits with jade."

Schafer (1951:154) compares the Shang Dynasty oracle graphs for ''wu'' and ''nong'' [[Wikt:弄|弄]] "play with; cause" (written with 玉 "jade" over 廾 "two hands") that shows "hands (of a shaman?) elevating a piece of jade (the rain-compelling mineral) inside an enclosure, possibly a tent. The Seal and modern form 巫 may well derive from this original, the hands becoming two figures, a convergence towards the dancer-type graph."

Tu Baikui 塗白奎 (quoted by Boileau 2002:354) believes the ''wu'' oracle character "was composed of two pieces of jade and originally designated a tool of divination." Citing Li Xiaoding 李孝定 that ''gong'' 工 originally pictured a "carpenter's square", Allan (1991:77) argues that oracle inscriptions used ''wu'' 巫 interchangeably with ''fang'' [[Wikt:方|方]] "square; side; place" for sacrifices to the ''sifang'' 四方 "four directions".

This 巫 component is semantically significant in several characters:
*''wu'' [[Wikt:誣|誣]] (with the "speech radical" 言) "deceive; slander; falsely accuse"
*''shi'' [[Wikt:筮|筮]] (with the "bamboo radical" 竹) "[[Achillea millefolium]] (used for divination)"
*''xi'' [[Wikt:覡|覡]] (with the "vision radical" 見) "male shaman; male sorcerer"
*''ling'' [[Wikt:靈|靈]] (with the "cloud radical" 雨 and three 口 "mouths" or "raindrops") "spirit; divine; clever"
*''yi'' [[Wikt:毉|毉]] "doctor", which is an old "shaman" [[Variant Chinese character|variant character]] for ''yi'' [[Wikt:醫|醫]] (with the "wine radical" 酉)

===Meanings===
The comprehensive ''[[Hanyu Da Zidian]]'' dictionary (1989 1:412) lists five meanings of ''wu'' 巫, translatable as:
#"[[Mediumship|spirit medium]]; [[shaman]]; [[Witchcraft|witch]]; [[Magician (paranormal)|wizard]]"
#"[[witch doctor]]; [[medicine man]]"
#"mountain name"
#"[[Toponym|place name]]"
#"[[Wu (surname)|surname]]"
The former two "shaman" and "doctor" ''wu'' meanings are discussed below in detail. The latter three "[[proper name]]" meanings of apply to mountains, places, and people. ''[[Wushan County, Chongqing|Wushan]]'' [[Wikt:|巫山]] "Wu Mountain" is located near [[Chongqing]] in [[Sichuan]] Province. In Chinese, it is known through the [[Chengyu|four-character idiom]] ''Wushanyunyu'' 巫山雲雨 (with "clouds and rain") "lovers' rendezvous; coitus" (for example, see ''[[Rain Clouds over Wushan]]''). In English, Wu Mountain is known as the archeological site where [[Wushan Man]] "taxon of ''[[Homo erectus]]''" was discovered. Two nearby place names are ''[[Wuxi County|Wuxi]]'' 巫溪 (Wu Stream) and ''[[Wu Gorge]]'' (Wuxia 巫峽), which is in the [[Yangtze River]]'s [[Three Gorges]] region. The [[Chinese surname]] ''Wu'' goes back to the Shang Dynasty (for example, legendary [[Wu Xian (astronomer)|Wu Xian]] 巫咸), but is comparatively uncommon today (but does appear, for example, in the name of recording artist Wu Qixian 巫啟賢 "[[Eric Moo]]"). Wuma 巫馬 (lit. "shaman horse") is both a [[Chinese compound surname]] (for example, the Confucian disciple [[Disciples of Confucius#Wuma Shi|Wuma Shi/Qi]] 巫馬施/期) and a name for "horse shaman; equine veterinarian" (for example, the ''Zhouli'' official).

===Etymologies===
[[Historical linguistics|Historical linguists]] hypothetically connect the [[etymology]] of Chinese ''wu'' "spirit medium; shaman" not only with [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] languages, but also with [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic]], [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]], [[Mon–Khmer languages|Mon–Khmer]], [[Turkic languages|Turkic]], and [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] language groups.

[[Berthold Laufer]] (1917:370) proposed a relation between [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] ''bügä'' "shaman", [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ''bögü'' "shaman", "Chinese ''bu'', ''wu'' (shaman), ''buk'', ''puk'' (to divine), and [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] ''aba'' (pronounced ''ba'', sorcerer)".

Coblin (1986:107) puts forward a Sino-Tibetan root **''{{IPA|mjaɣ}}'' "magician; sorcerer" for Chinese ''wu'' &lt; ''mju'' &lt; *''mjag'' 巫 "magician; shaman" and [[Tibetan script|Written Tibetan]]'' 'ba'-po'' "sorcerer" and'' 'ba'-mo'' "sorcereress" (of the [[Bön]] religion).

Schuessler (2007:516) notes Chinese ''xian'' &lt; ''sjän'' &lt; *''sen'' [[仙]] "transcendent; immortal; alchemist" was probably borrowed as Written Tibetan ''gšen'' "shaman" and [[Thai language|Thai]] {{IPA-th|mɔɔ|}} &lt; Proto-Tai *''{{IPA|hmɔ}}'' "doctor; sorcerer". In addition, the [[Mon–Khmer languages|Mon–Khmer]] and Proto-Western-Austronesian  *''{{IPA|səmaŋ}}'' "shaman" may also be connected with ''wu''. Schuessler lists four proposed etymologies.

First, ''wu'' could be the same word as ''wu'' 誣 "to deceive" (Karlgren 1923:363). Schuessler notes a Written Tibetan semantic parallel between "magical power" and "deceive": ''sprul-ba'' "to juggle, make phantoms; miraculous power" cognate with {{IPA-bo|pʰrul|}} "magical deception".

[[File:Tomb brick g.JPG|thumb|Han Dynasty tomb-tile showing "long-sleeved dancers" and attendants.]]
Second, ''wu'' could be cognate with ''wu'' [[Wikt:舞|舞]] "to dance". Based on analysis of ancient characters, Hopkins (1920, 1945) proposed that ''wu'' 巫 "shaman", ''wu'' [[Wikt:無|無]] "not have; without", and ''wu'' 舞 "dance", "can all be traced back to one primitive figure of a man displaying by the gestures of his arms and legs the [[thaumaturgic]] powers of his inspired personality" (1945:5). Many Western Han Dynasty tombs contained jade plaques or pottery images showing "long-sleeved dancers" performing at funerals, who Erickson (1994:52-54) identifies as shamans, citing the ''Shuowen jiezi'' that early ''wu'' characters depicted a dancer's sleeves.

Third, ''wu'' could also be cognate with ''mu'' 母 "mother" since ''wu'', as opposed to ''xi'' 覡, were typically female. [[Edward H. Schafer|Edward Schafer]] associates ''wu'' shamanism with fertility rituals.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Linguistic facts reveal the intimate relationships between the word ''wu'' (*''myu'') "shamanka" and such words as "mother", "dance", "fertility", "egg", and "receptacle". The ancient shamanka, then, was closely related to the fecund mother, to the fertile soil, to the receptive earth. The textual evidence supports these philological associations. In Shang and Chou times, shamankas were regularly employed in the interests of human and natural fertility, above all in bringing rain to parched farmlands – a responsibility they shared with ancient kings. They were musicians and dancers and oracles. (1973:10) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Jensen (1995:421) cites the Japanese sinologist Shirakawa Shizuka 白川静's hypothesis that the mother of [[Confucius]] was a ''wu''.

[[Image:Cross-Potent-Heraldry.svg|thumb|Cross potent]]
Fourth, ''wu'' could be a loanword from [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] *''maguš'' "magi; magician" (cf. [[Old Persian]] ''maguš'', [[Avestan language|Avestan]] ''mogu''), meaning an "able one; specialist in ritual". Mair (1990) provides archaeological and linguistic evidence that Chinese ''wu'' &lt; *''m&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;ag'' 巫 "shaman; witch, wizard; magician" was a [[loanword]] from [[Old Persian]] *''maguš'' "magician; [[magi]]".

Mair connects the nearly identical Chinese Bronze script for ''wu'' 巫 (above) and Western [[heraldic]] [[cross potent]] '''☩''', an ancient symbol of a ''magi'' or ''magician'', for which both words were ultimately borrowed from the same Iranian word.&lt;ref&gt;Victor H. Mair, “The Earliest Identifiable Written Chinese Character”, ''Archaeology and Language: Indo-European Studies Presented to James P. Mallory'', eds. Martin E. Huld, Karlene Jones-Bley &amp; Dean Miller (Washington, D.C.: Institute for the Study of Man, 2012), 265–279.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early records of ''wu''==
The oldest written records of ''wu'' are Shang Dynasty oracle inscriptions and Zhou Dynasty classical texts. Boileau notes the disparity of these sources.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Concerning the historical origin of the ''wu'', we may ask: were they a remnant of an earlier stage of the development of archaic Chinese civilization? The present state of the documentation does not allow such a conclusion for two reasons: first, the most abundant data about the ''wu'' are to be found in Eastern Zhou texts; and, second, these texts have little in common with the data originating directly from the Shang civilization; possible ancestors of the Eastern Zhou ''wu'' are the cripples and the females burned in sacrifice to bring about rain. They are mentioned in the oracular inscriptions but there is no mention of the Shang character ''wu''. Moreover, because of the scarcity of information, many of the activities of the Zhou ''wu'' cannot be traced back to the Shang period. Consequently, trying to correlate Zhou data with Neolithic cultures appears very difficult. (2002:376) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Wu'' in Shang oracular inscriptions===
Shima's (1971:418) concordance of oracle inscriptions lists 58 occurrences of the character ''wu'': 32 in repeated compounds (most commonly 巫帝 "''wu'' spirit/sacrifice" and 氐巫 "bring the ''wu'') and 26 in miscellaneous contexts. Boileau (2002:354-5) differentiates four meanings of these oracular ''wu'':
#"a spirit, ''wu'' of the north or east, to which sacrifices are offered"
#"a sacrifice, possibly linked to controlling the wind or meteorology"
#"an equivalent for ''shi'' 筮, a form of divination using achilea"
#"a living human being, possibly the name of a person, tribe, place, or territory"
The inscriptions about this living ''wu'', which is later identified as "shaman", reveal six characteristics:&lt;blockquote&gt;
#whether the ''wu'' is a man or a woman is not known;
#it could be either the name for a function or the name of a people (or an individual) coming from a definite territory or nation;
#the wu seems to have been in charge of some divinations, (in one instance, divination is linked to a sacrifice of appeasement);
#the wu is seen as offering a sacrifice of appeasement but the inscription and the fact that this kind of sacrifice was offered by other persons (the king included) suggests that the ''wu'' was not the person of choice to conduct all the sacrifices of appeasement;
#there is only one inscription where a direct link between the king and the ''wu'' appears. Nevertheless, the nature of the link is not known, because the status of the ''wu'' does not appear clearly;
#he follows (being brought, presumably, to Shang territory or court) the orders of other people; he is perhaps offered to the Shang as a tribute. (Boileau 2002:355) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Based on this ancient but limited Shang-era oracular record, it is unclear how or whether the ''Wu'' spirit, sacrifice, person, and place were related.

===''Wu'' in Zhou received texts===
Chinese ''wu'' 巫 "shaman" occurs over 300 times in the [[Chinese classics]], which generally date from the late Zhou and early Han periods (6th-1st centuries BCE). The following examples are categorized by the common specializations of ''wu''-shamans:
&lt;blockquote&gt;men and women possessed by spirits or gods, and consequently acting as seers and soothsayers, exorcists and physicians; invokers or conjurers bringing down gods at sacrifices, and performing other sacerdotal functions, occasionally indulging also in imprecation, and in sorcery with the help of spirits. (De Groot 1910 6:1212) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

A single text can describe many roles for ''wu''-shamans. For instance, the ''[[Guoyu (book)|Guoyu]]'' idealizes their origins in a [[Golden Age]]. It contains a story about [[King Zhao of Chu|King Zhao]] of [[Chu (state)|Chu]] (r. 515-489 BCE) reading in the ''Shujing'' that the sage ruler [[Shun (Chinese leader)|Shun]] "commissioned Chong and Li to cut the communication between heaven and earth". He asks his minister to explain and is told.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Anciently, men and spirits did not intermingle. At that time there were certain persons who were so perspicacious, single-minded, and reverential that their understanding enabled them to make meaningful collation of what lies above and below, and their insight to illumine what is distant and profound. Therefore the spirits would descend upon them. The possessors of such powers were, if men, called ''xi'' (shamans), and, if women, ''wu'' (shamanesses). It is they who supervised the positions of the spirits at the ceremonies, sacrificed to them, and otherwise handled religious matters. As a consequence, the spheres of the divine and the profane were kept distinct. The spirits sent down blessings on the people, and accepted from them their offerings. There were no natural calamities.
:In the degenerate time of &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Shaohao]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (traditionally put at the twenty-sixth century B.C.), however, the Nine Li threw virtue into disorder. Men and spirits became intermingled, with each household indiscriminately performing for itself the religious observances which had hitherto been conducted by the shamans. As a consequence, men lost their reverence for the spirits, the spirits violated the rules of men, and natural calamities arose. Hence the successor of [Shaohao], &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Zhuanxu]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;..., charged &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Chong&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, Governor of the South, to handle the affairs of heaven in order to determine the proper place of the spirits, and Li, Governor of Fire, to handle the affairs of Earth, in order to determine the proper place of men. And such is what is meant by cutting the communication between Heaven and Earth. (tr. Bodde 1961:390-391) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Wu-shamans as healers====
The belief that [[demonic possession]] caused disease and sickness is well documented in many cultures, including ancient China. The early practitioners of [[Traditional Chinese Medicine|Chinese medicine]] historically changed from ''wu'' 巫 "spirit-mediums; shamans" who used divination, exorcism, and prayer to ''yi'' 毉 or 醫 "doctors; physicians" who used herbal medicine, [[moxibustion]], and [[acupuncture]].

As mentioned above, ''wu'' 巫 "shaman" was depicted in the ancient 毉 variant character for ''yi'' 醫 "healer; doctor". This archaic ''yi'' 毉, writes Carr (1992:117), "ideographically depicted a shaman-doctor in the act of exorcistical healing with (矢 'arrows' in) a 医 'quiver', a 殳 'hand holding a lance', and a ''wu'' 巫 'shaman'." Unschuld believes this 毉 character depicts the type of ''wu'' practitioner described in the ''Liji''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Several times a year, and also during certain special occasions, such as the funeral of a prince, hordes of exorcists would race shrieking through the city streets, enter the courtyards and homes, thrusting their spears into the air, in an attempt to expel the evil creatures. Prisoners were dismembered outside all gates to the city, to serve both as a deterrent to the demons and as an indication of their fate should they be captured. (1985:37) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Replacing the exorcistical 巫 "shaman" in 毉 with medicinal 酒 "wine" in ''yi'' 醫 "healer; doctor" signified, writes Schiffeler (1976:27), "the practice of medicine was not any longer confined to the incantations of the ''wu'', but that it had been taken over (from an official standpoint) by the "priest-physicians," who administered elixirs or wines as treatments for their patients."
[[File:iching-hexagram-32.svg|thumb|Hexagram 32, ''Heng'' 恆]]
''Wu'' and ''yi'' are compounded in the word ''wuyi'' 巫醫 "shaman-doctor; shamans and doctors", translated "exorcising physician" (De Groot 1910), "sorcerer-physician" (Schiffeler 1976), or "physician-shaman" (Mainfort 2004). Confucius quotes a "Southern Saying" that a good ''wuyi'' must have ''heng'' [[Wikt:恆|恆]] "constancy; ancient tradition; continuation; perseverance; regularity; proper name (e.g., ''Yijing'' [[I Ching hexagram 32#Hexagram 32|Hexagram 32]])". The (ca. 5th century BCE) ''[[Lunyu]]'' "Confucian Analects" and the (ca. 1st century BCE) ''[[Liji]]'' "Record of Rites" give different versions of the Southern Saying.

First, the ''Lunyu'' quotes Confucius to mention the saying and refer to the Heng Hexagram:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Master said, The men of the south have a saying, Without stability a man will not even make a good shaman or witch-doctor. Well said! Of the maxim; if you do not stabilize an act of ''te'' 德, you will get evil by it (instead of good), the Master said, They (i.e. soothsayers) do not simply read the omens. (13/22, tr. Waley 1938:77) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Confucius refers to a ''Yijing'' line interpretation of the Heng "Duration" Hexagram (tr. Wilhelm 1967:127-9): "Nine in the third place means: He who does not give duration to his character meets with disgrace." In Waley's earlier article about the ''Yijing'', he translated "If you do not stabilize your "virtue," Disgrace will overtake you", and quoted the ''Lunyu''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The people of the south have a saying, 'It takes ''heng'' to make even a soothsayer or medicine-man.' It's quite true. 'If you do not stabilize your virtue, disgrace will overtake you'." Confucius adds 不占而已矣, which has completely baffled his interpreters. Surely the meaning is 'It is not enough merely to get an omen,' one must also ''heng'' 'stabilize it'. And if such a rule applies even to inferior arts like those of the diviner and medicine-man, Confucius asks, how much the more does it apply to the seeker after [''de''] in the moral sense? Surely he too must 'make constant' his initial striving! (1933:136-137)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Second, the ''Liji'' quotes Confucius to elaborate upon the Southern Saying.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Master said, 'The people of the south have a saying that "A man without constancy cannot be a diviner either with the tortoise-shell or the stalks." This was probably a saying handed down from antiquity. If such a man cannot know the tortoise-shell and stalks, how much less can he know other men? It is said in the ''Book of Poetry'' (II, v, ode 1, 3) "Our tortoise-shells are wearied out, And will not tell us anything about the plans." The Charge to [Yue] says ([''Shujing''], IV, VIII, sect. 2, 5, 11), "Dignities should not be conferred on men of evil practices. (If they be), how can the people set themselves to correct their ways? If this be sought merely by sacrifices, it will be disrespectful (to the spirits). When affairs come to be troublesome, there ensues disorder; when the spirits are served so, difficulties ensue." 'It is said in the [''Yijing''], "When one does not continuously maintain his virtue, some will impute it to him as a disgrace; (in the position indicated in the Hexagram.) 'When one does maintain his virtue continuously (in the other position indicated), this will be fortunate in a wife, but in a husband evil'." (55, tr. Legge 1885 2:363-364) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
This ''Liji'' version makes five changes from the ''Lunyu'' (Carr 1992:121-122). (1) It writes ''bushi'' 卜筮 "diviner" instead of ''wuyi'' 巫醫 "shaman-doctor", compounding ''bu'' "divine by bone or shell, [[scapulimancy]] or [[plastromancy]]" and ''shi'' (also with "shaman") "divine by milfoil stalks, [[cleromancy]] or sortilege". (2) Instead of quoting Confucius to remark "well said!"; he describes the southern proverb as "probably a saying handed down from antiquity" and rhetorically questions the efficacy of divination. (3) The ''Liji'' correctly quotes the ''Shijing'' (195, tr. Karlgren 1950:142) criticizing royal diviners: "Our tortoises are (satiated =) weary, they do not tell us the (proper) plans." (4) It quotes the "Charge to Yue" 說命 (traditionally attributed to Shang king [[Wu Ding]]) differently from the fabricated ''Guwen'' "[[Old Texts]]" ''[[Shujing]]'' "Classic of History" chapter with this name.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Dignities may not be conferred on man of evil practices, but only on men of worth. Anxious thought about what will be good should precede your movements. Your movements also should have respect to the time for them. … Officiousness in sacrifices is called irreverence; ceremonies when burdensome lead to disorder. To serve the spirits in this way is difficult. (17, tr. Legge 1865:256-8)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
(5) It cites an additional ''Yijing'' Hexagram 32 line (tr. Wilhelm 1967:129) that gender determines the auspiciousness of ''heng''. "Six in the fifth place means: Giving duration to one's character through perseverance. This is good fortune for a woman, misfortune for a man."

The mytho-geography ''[[Shanhaijing]]'' "Classic of Mountains and Seas" associates ''wu''-shamans with medicinal herbs.
&lt;blockquote&gt;East of the Openbright there are Shaman Robust, Shaman Pushaway, Shaman Sunny, Shaman Shoe, Shaman Every, and Shaman Aide. They are all on each side of the corpse of Notch Flaw and they hold the neverdie drug to ward off decay. (tr. Birrell 2000:141) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is Mount Divinepower. This is where Shaman Whole, Shaman Reach, Shaman Share, Shaman Robust, Shaman Motherinlaw, Shaman Real, Shaman Rite, Shaman Pushaway, ShamanTakeleave, and Shaman Birdnet ascend to the sky and come down from Mount Divinepower. This is where the hundred drugs are to be found. (tr. Birrell 2000:174) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
"Shaman Whole" translates [[Wu Xian (astronomer)|Wu Xian]] 巫咸 below.

Boileau contrasts Siberian and Chinese shamanic medicines.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Concerning healing, a comparison of the ''wu'' and the Siberian shaman shows a big difference: in Siberia, the shaman is also in charge of cures and healing, but he does this by identifying the spirit responsible for the disease and negotiates the proper way to appease him (or her), for example by offering a sacrifice or food on a regular basis. In archaic China, this role is performed through sacrifice: exorcism by the ''wu'' does not seem to result in a sacrifice but is aimed purely and simply at expelling the evil spirit. (2002:361) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Wu-shamans as rainmakers====
''Wu'' anciently served as intermediaries with [[nature spirit]]s believed to control rainfall and flooding. During a [[drought]], ''wu''-shamans would perform the ''yu'' [[Wikt:雩|雩]] "sacrificial [[rain dance]] ceremony". If that failed, both ''wu'' and ''wang'' [[Wikt:尪|尪]] "cripple; lame person; emaciated person" engaged in "ritual exposure" (Schafer 1951) [[rainmaking]] techniques based upon [[homeopathic]] or [[sympathetic magic]]. As Unschuld (1985:33-34) explains, "Shamans had to carry out an exhausting dance within a ring of fire until, sweating profusely, the falling drops of perspirations produced the desired rain." These ''wu'' and ''wang'' procedures were called ''pu'' [[Wikt:曝|曝]]/[[Wikt:暴|暴]] "expose to open air/sun", ''fen'' [[Wikt:焚|焚]] "burn; set on fire", and ''pulu'' [[Wikt:暴露|暴露]] "reveal; lay bare; expose to open air/sun".

For the year 639 BCE, the ''Chunqiu'' records, "In summer, there was a great drought" in [[State of Lu|Lu]], and the ''Zuozhuan'' notes a discussion about ''fen wu wang'' 焚巫尪:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The duke (Xi) wanted to burn a ''wu'' and a cripple at the stake. [[Zang Wenzhong]] 臧文仲 said: this is no preparation for the drought. Repair the city walls, limit your food, be economic in your consumption, be parsimonious and advise (people) to share (the food), this is what must be done. What use would be ''wu'' and cripple? If Heaven wanted to have them killed, why were they born at all? If they (the cripple and the ''wu'') could produce drought, burning them would augment very much (the disaster). (tr. Boileau 2002:363, cf. Legge 1872:180) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The duke followed this advice, and subsequently "scarcity was not very great".

The ''Liji'' uses the words ''puwang'' 暴尪 and ''puwu'' 暴巫 to describe a similar rainmaking ritual during the reign (407-375 BCE) of Duke Mu 穆公 of Lu.
&lt;blockquote&gt;There was a drought during the year. Duke Mu called on Xianzi and asked him about the reason for this. He said: 'Heaven has not (given us) rain in a long time. I want to expose to the sun a cripple and what about that?' (Xianzi) said: 'Heaven has not (given us) rain in a long time but to expose to the sun the crippled son of somebody, that would be cruel. No, this cannot be allowed.' (the duke said): 'Well, then I want to expose to the sun a ''wu'' and what about that?' (Xianzi) answered: 'Heaven has not (given us) rain in a long time but to put one's hope on an ignorant woman and offer her to pray (for rain), no, this is too far (from reason).' (tr. Boileau 2002:364, cf. Legge 1885 1:201) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Commentators interpret the ''wu'' as a female shaman and the ''wang'' as a male cripple.

De Groot connects the ''Zuozhuan'' and ''Liji'' stories about ritually burning ''wu''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;These two narratives evidently are different readings of one, and may both be inventions; nevertheless they have their value as sketches of ancient idea and custom. Those 'infirm or unsound' ''wang'' were non-descript individuals, evidently placed somewhat on a line with the ''wu''; perhaps they were queer hags or beldams, deformed beings, idiotic or crazy, or nervously affected to a very high degree, whose strange demeanour was ascribed to possession. (1910 6:1194) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Wu-shamans as oneiromancers====
[[Oneiromancy]] or [[dream interpretation]] was one type of divination performed by ''wu'' 巫. The ''Zuozhuan'' records two stories about ''wu'' interpreting the guilty dreams of murderers.

First, in 581 BCE the lord of [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin]], who had slain two officers from the [[Zhao (surname)|Zhao]] (趙) family, had a nightmare about their ancestral spirit, and called upon an unnamed ''wu'' "shaman" from Sangtian 桑田 and a ''yi'' "doctor" named Huan 緩 from [[Qin (state)|Qin]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;The marquis of [Jin] saw in a dream a great demon with disheveled hair reaching to the ground, which beat its breast, and leaped up, saying: "You have slain my descendants unrighteously, and I have presented my request to the High God in consequence." It then broke the great gate (of the palace), advanced to the gate of the State chamber, and entered. The duke was afraid and went into a side-chamber, the door of which it also broke. The duke then awoke, and called the witch of [Sangtian], who told him everything which he had dreamt. "What will be the issue?" asked the duke. "You will not taste the new wheat," she replied. &lt;br&gt;
After this, the duke became very ill, and asked the services of a physician from [Qin], the earl of which sent the physician [Huan] to do what he could for him. Before he came, the duke dreamt that his disease turned into two boys, who said, "That is a skilful physician; it is to be feared he will hurt us; how shall we get out of his way?" Then one of them said: "If we take our place above the heart and below the throat, what can he do to us?" When the physician arrived, he said, "Nothing can be done for this disease. Its seat is above the heart and below the throat. If I assail it (with medicine), it will be of no use; if I attempt to puncture it, it cannot be reached. Nothing can be done for it." The duke said, "He is a skilful physician", gave him large gifts, and send him back to [Qin].&lt;br&gt;
In the sixth month, on the day [bingwu], the marquis wished to taste the new wheat, and made the superintendent of his fields present some. While the baker was getting it ready, [the marquis] called the witch of [Sangtian], showed her the wheat and put her to death. As the marquis was about to taste the wheat, he felt it necessary to go to the privy, into which he fell, and so died. One of the servants that waited on him had dreamt in the morning that he carried the marquis on his back up to heaven. The same at mid-day carried him on his back out from the privy, and was afterwards buried alive with him. (tr. Legge 1872:374, note "witch" translates ''wu'') &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Commentators have attempted to explain why the ''wu'' merely interpreted the duke's dream but did not perform a healing ritual or exorcism, and why the duke waited until the prediction had failed before ordering the execution. Boileau (2002:368) suggests the ''wu'' was executed in presumed responsibility for the Zhao ancestral spirit's attack.

Second, in 552 BCE a ''wu'' named Gao 皋 both appears in and divines about a dream of Zhongxing Xianzi. After conspiring in the murder of Duke Li of Jin, Zhongxing dreams that the duke's spirit gets revenge.
&lt;blockquote&gt;In autumn, the marquis of [Jin] invaded our northern border. [Zhongxing Xianzi] prepared to invade [Qi]. (Just then), he dreamt that he was maintaining a suit with duke [Li], in which the case was going against him, when the duke struck him with a [''[[Dagger-axe|ge]]''] on his head, which fell down before him. He took his head up, put it on his shoulders, and ran off, when he saw the wizard [Gao] of [Gengyang]. A day or two after, it happened that he did see this [Gao] on the road, and told him his dream, and the wizard, who had had the same dream, said to him: "Your death is to happen about this time; but if you have business in the east, you will there be successful [first]". Xianzi accepted this interpretation. (tr. Legge 1872:478, note "wizard" translates ''wu'') &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Boileau questions:
&lt;blockquote&gt;why wasn't the ''wu'' asked by Zhongxin to expel the spirit of the duke? Perhaps because the spirit went through him to curse the officer. Could it be that the ''wu'' was involved (his involvement is extremely strong in this affair) in a kind of deal, or is it simply that the ''wu'' was aware of two different matters concerning the officer, only one connected to the dream? (2002:369) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to these two stories, ''wu'' were feared and considered dangerous. This attitude is also evident in a ''Zhuangzi'' story about the ''shenwu'' 神巫 "[[Shen (Chinese religion)|spirit/god]] shaman" Jixian 季咸 from [[Zheng (state)|Zheng]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;In [Zheng], there was a shaman of the gods named [Jixian]. He could tell whether men would live or die, survive or perish, be fortunate or unfortunate, live a long time or die young, and he would predict the year, month, week, and day as though he were a god himself. When the people of [Zheng] saw him, they all ran out of his way. (tr. Watson 1968:95) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
"As soothsayers." writes de Groot (1910 6:1195), "the ''wu'' in ancient China no doubt held a place of great importance."

====Wu-shamans as officials====
Sinological controversies have arisen over the political importance of ''wu'' 巫 in ancient China. Some scholars (e.g., Eliade 1964 and Chang 1983) believe Chinese ''wu'' used "techniques of ecstasy" like shamans elsewhere; others (e.g., Keightley 1983) believe ''wu'' were "ritual bureaucrats" or "moral metaphysicians" who did not engage in shamanistic practices.

[[Chen Mengjia]] wrote a seminal article (1936) that proposed Shang kings were ''wu''-shamans.
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the oracle bone inscriptions are often encountered inscriptions stating that the king divined or that the king inquired in connections with wind- or rain-storms, rituals, conquests, or hunts. There are also statements that "the king made the prognostication that …," pertaining to weather, the border regions, or misfortunes and diseases; the only prognosticator ever recorded in the oracle bone inscriptions was the king ... There are, in addition, inscriptions describing the king dancing to pray for rain and the king prognosticating about a dream. All of these were activities of both king and shaman, which means in effect that the king was a shaman. (1936:535, tr. Chang 1983:46-47) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Chen's shaman-king hypothesis was supported by [[Kwang-chih Chang]] who cited the ''Guoyu'' story about Shao Hao severing heaven-earth communication (above).
&lt;blockquote&gt;This myth is the most important textual reference to shamanism in ancient China, and it provides the crucial clue to understanding the central role of shamanism in ancient Chinese politics. Heaven is where all the wisdom of human affairs lies. … Access to that wisdom was, of course, requisite for political authority. In the past, ''everybody'' had had that access through the shamans. Since heaven had been severed from earth, only those who controlled that access had the wisdom – hence the authority – to rule. Shamans, therefore, were a crucial part of every state court; in fact, scholars of ancient China agree that the king himself was actually head shaman. (1983:45) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Some modern scholars disagree. For instance, Boileau (2002:350) calls Chen's hypothesis "somewhat antiquated being based more on an a priori approach than on history" and says,
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the case of the relationship between ''wu'' and ''wang'' [king], Chen Mengjia did not pay sufficient attention to what the king was able to do as a king, that is to say, to the parts of the king's activities in which the ''wu'' was not involved, for example, political leadership as such, or warfare. The process of recognition must also be taken into account: it is probable that the ''wu'' was chosen or acknowledged as such according to different criteria to those adopted for the king. Chen's concept of the king as the head ''wu'' was influenced by [[James George Frazer|Frazer]]'s theories about the origin of political power: for Frazer the king was originally a powerful sorcerer. (2002:351) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Shujing'' "Classic of History" lists [[Wu Xian (astronomer)|Wu Xian]] 巫咸 and Wu Xian 巫賢 as capable administrators of the Shang royal household. The [[Duke of Zhou]] tells Prince [[Shao]] 召 that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I have heard that of ancient time, when [[Tang of Shang|King Tang]] had received the favoring decree, he had with him [[Yi Yin]], making his virtue like that of great Heaven. [[Tai Jia]], again, had Bao Heng. [[Tai Wu]] had Yi Zhi and Chen Hu, through whom his virtue was made to affect God; he had also [巫咸] Wu Xian, who regulated the royal house; [[Zu Yi]] had [巫賢] Wu Xian. [[Wu Ding]] had Gan Pan. These ministers carried out their principles and effected their arrangements, preserving and regulating the empire of [Shang], so that, while its ceremonies lasted, those sovereigns, though deceased, were assessors to Heaven, while it extended over many years. (tr. Legge 1865:206, n.b., names standardized to pinyin) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to Boileau,
&lt;blockquote&gt;In some texts, Wu Xian senior is described as being in charge of the divination using  [''shi'' 筮] achilea. He was apparently made a high god in the kingdom of [[Qin (state)|Qin]] 秦 during the Warring States period. The Tang subcommentary interprets the character ''wu'' of Wu Xian father and son as being a [[cognomen]], the name of the clan from which the two Xian came. It is possible that in fact the text referred to two Shang ministers, father and son, coming from the same eponymous territory ''wu''. Perhaps, later, the name (''wu'' 巫) of these two ministers has been confused with the character ''wu'' (巫) as employed in other received texts. (2002:358) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Wu''-shamans participated in court scandals and dynastic rivalries under [[Emperor Wu of Han]] (r. 141-87 BCE), particularly regarding the crime of ''wugu'' 巫蠱 (with [[Gu (poison)|''gu'']] "venom-based poison") "sorcery; casting harmful spells". In 130 BCE, [[Empress Chen Jiao]] was convicted of using shamans from [[State of Yue|Yue]] to conduct ''wugu'' magic. She "was dismissed from her position and a total of 300 persons who were involved in the case were executed" (tr. Loewe 1970:169), their heads were cut off and exposed on stakes. In 91 BCE, an attempted coup against crown prince [[Liu Ju]] involved accusations of practicing ''wugu'', and subsequently "no less than nine long months of bloody terrorism, ending in a tremendous slaughter, cost some tens of thousands their lives!" (tr. Groot 1910 5:836).

Ever since Emperor Wu of Han established Confucianism as the state religion, the ruling classes have shown increasing prejudice against shamanism (de Groot 1910:1233-42, Waley 1955:11-12). Some modern writers view the traditional Confucianist disdain for female shamans as [[sexism]]. Schafer wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the opinion of the writer, the Chou ruling class was particularly hostile to [[Women in ancient and imperial China#Han dynasty|women in government]], and regarded the ancient fertility rites as impure. This anti-female tendency was even more marked in the state of Lu, where Confucius approved of the official rain-ceremony in which men alone participated. There was, within ancient China, a heterogeneity of culture areas, with female shamans favored in some, males in others. The "licentiousness" of the ceremonies of such a state as Cheng (doubtless preserving the ancient Shang traditions and customs) was a byword among Confucian moralists. Confucius' state seems on the other hand to have taken the "respectable" attitude that the sexes should not mingle in the dance, and that men were the legitimate performers of the fertility rites. The general practice of the later Chou period, or at least the semi-idealized picture given of the rites of that time in such books as the ''Chou li'', apparently prescribed a division of magical functions between men and women. The former generally play the role of exorcists, the latter of petitioners. This is probably related to the metaphysical belief that women, embodying the principle ''yin'', were akin to the spirits, whereas men, exemplifying the element ''yang'', were naturally hostile to them. (1951:158) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Accepting the tradition that Chinese shamans were women (i.e., ''wu'' 巫 "shamaness" as opposed to ''xi'' 覡 "shaman"), Kagan believes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the main themes in Chinese history is the unsuccessful attempt by the male Confucian orthodoxy to [[Women in ancient and imperial China|strip women of their public and sacred powers]] and to limit them to a role of service ... Confucianists reasserted daily their claim to power and authority through the promotion of the phallic ancestor cult which denied women religious representation and excluded them from the governmental examination system which was the path to office, prestige, and status. (1980:3-4) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
In addition, Unschuld (1980:125-128) refers to a "Confucian medicine" based upon systematic correspondences and the idea that illnesses are caused by excesses (rather than demons).

The ''Zhouli'' provides detailed information about the roles of ''wu''-shamans. It lists (Falkenhausen 1995:282), "Spirit Mediums as officials on the payroll of the Zhou Ministry of Rites (''Liguan'' 禮官, or Ministry of Spring, ''Chun guan'' 春官)." This text differentiates three offices: the Siwu 司巫 "Manager/Director of Shamans", Nanwu 男巫 "Male Shamans", and ''Nüwu'' 女巫 "Female Shamans".

The managerial Siwu, who was of [[Chinese nobility#Fengjian and Zongfa of the Zhou Dynasty|''Shi'']] 士 "Gentleman; Yeoman" feudal rank, yet was not a ''wu'', supervised "the many ''wu''".
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Managers of the Spirit Mediums are in charge of the policies and orders issued to the many Spirit Mediums. When the country suffers a great drought, they lead the Spirit Mediums in dancing the rain-making ritual (''yu'' 雩). When the country suffers a great calamity, they lead the Spirit Mediums in enacting the long-standing practices of Spirit Mediums (''wuheng'' 巫恆). At official sacrifices, they [handle] the ancestral tablets in their receptacles, the cloth on which the spirits walk, and the box containing the reeds [for presenting the sacrificial foodstuffs]. In all official sacrificial services, they guard the place where the offerings are buried. In all funerary services, they are in charge of the rituals by which the Spirit Mediums make [the spirits] descend (''jiang'' 降). (tr. von Falkenhausen 1995:285, cf. de Groot 1910 6:1189-1190) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Nanwu and Nüwu have different shamanic specializations, especially regarding inauspicious events like sickness, death, and natural disaster.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Male Spirit Mediums are in charge of the ''si'' 祀 and ''yan'' 衍 Sacrifices to the Deities of the Mountains and Rivers. They receive the honorific titles [of the deities], which they proclaim into the [four] directions, holding reeds. In the winter, in the great temple hall, they offer [or: shoot arrows] without a fixed direction and without counting the number. In the spring, they make proclamations and issue bans so as to remove sickness and disease. When the king offers condolence, they together with the invocators precede him. &lt;br&gt;
The Female Mediums are in charge of anointing and ablutions at the exorcisms that are held at regular times throughout the year. When there is a drought or scorching heat, they dance in the rain-making ritual (''yu''). When the queen offers condolence, they together with the invocators precede her. In all great calamities of the state, they pray, singing and wailing. (26, tr. von Falkenhausen 1995:290, cf. de Groot 1910 6:1189) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Von Falkenhausen concludes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If we are to generalize from the above enumeration, we find that the Spirit Mediums' principal functions are tied up with averting evil and pollution. They are especially active under circumstances of inauspiciousness and distress. In case of droughts and calamities, they directly address the supernatural powers of Heaven and Earth. Moreover, they are experts in dealing with frightful, dangerous ghosts (the ghosts of the defunct at the time of the funeral, the evil spirits at the exorcism, and the spirits of disease) and harmful substances (unburied dead bodies during visits of condolence and all manner of impure things at the lustration festival). (1995:293)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Chu Ci''===
{{Main|Chu Ci}}
The poetry anthology ''Chu Ci'', especially its older pieces, is largely characterized by its shamanic content and style, as explicated to some extent by sinologist [[David Hawkes (Sinologist)|David Hawkes]].(1985[2011]:''passim'') Among other points of interest are the intersection of Shamanic traditions and mythology/folk religion in the earlier textual material, such as ''[[Heavenly Questions|Tianwen]]'' (possibly based on even more ancient shamanic temple murals), the whole question of the interpretation of the 11 verses of the ''[[Jiu Ge]]'' (''Nine Songs'') as the libretto of a shamanic dramatic performance, the motif of shamanic spirit flight from ''[[Li Sao]]'' through subsequent pieces, the evidence of possible regional variations in wu shamanism between [[Chu (state)|Chu]], [[Wei (state)|Wei]], [[Qi (state)|Qi]], and other states (or shamanic colleges associated with those regions), and the suggestion that some of the newer textual material was modified to please Han Wudi, by [[Liu An]], the Prince of Huainan, or his circle. The [[List of Chu Ci contents|''Chu Ci'' contents]] have traditionally been chronologically divided into an older, pre-[[Han dynasty]] group, and those written during the Han Dynasty. Of the traditionally-considered to be the older works (omitting the mostly prose narratives, "[[Bu Ju]]" and "[[Yu Fu]]") David Hawkes considers the following sections to be "functional, explicitly shamanistic": ''[[Jiu Ge]]'', ''Tian Wen'', and the two shamanic summons for the soul, "[[The Great Summons]]" and "[[Summons of the Soul]]".(1985[2011]:38) Regarding the other, older pieces he considers that "shamanism, if there is any" to be an incidental poetic device, particularly in the form of descriptions of the shamanic spirit journey.

====Background====
The mainstream of Chinese literacy and literature is associated with the [[oracle bone|shell and bone]] oracular inscriptions from recovered archeological artifacts from the [[Shang dynasty]] and with the literary works of the Western [[Zhou dynasty]], which include the classic Confucian works. Both are associated with the northern Chinese areas. South of the traditional Shang and Zhou areas was the land (and water) of [[Chu (state)|Chu]]. Politically and to some extent culturally distinct from the Zhou dynasty and its later 6 devolved hegemonic states, Chu was the original source and inspiration for the poems anthologized during the [[Han dynasty]] under the title ''[[Chu Ci]]'', literally meaning something like "the literary material of Chu".(Hawkes:16-17 and 28-29) Despite the tendency of Confucian-oriented  government officials to suppress wu shamanic beliefs and practice, in the general area of Chinese culture, the force of colonial conservatism and the poetic voice of [[Qu Yuan]] and other poets combined to contribute an established literary tradition heavily influenced by wu shamanism to posterity.(Hawkes:19-20) Shamanic practices as described anthropologically are generally paralleled by descriptions of wu practices as found in the ''Chu Ci'', and in Chinese mythology more generally.(Hawkes:42-47)

====''Li Sao'', ''Yuan You'', and ''Jiu Bian''====
{{Main|Li Sao|Yuan You|Jiu Bian}}
The signature poem of the ''Chu Ci'' is the poem ''[[Li Sao]]''. By China's "first poet", [[Qu Yuan]], a major literary device of the poem is the shamanic spirit journey. "[[Yuan You]]", literally "The Far-off Journey" features shamanic spirit flight as a literary device, as does ''[[Jiu Bian]]'', as part of its climactic ending. In the ''Li Sao'', two individual shaman are specified, Ling Fen (靈氛) and Wu Xian (巫咸).(Hawkes:45, note 9) This Wu Xian may or may not be the same as the (one or more) historical person(s) named [[Wu Xian (astronomer)|Wu Xian]]. Hawkes suggests an equation of the word ''ling'' in the Chu dialect with the word ''wu''.(46 and 84)

====Questioning Heaven====
{{Main|Heavenly Questions}}
The ''[[Heavenly Questions]]'' (literally "Questioning Heaven") is one of the ancient repositories of Chinese myth and a major cultural legacy. Propounded as a series of questions, the poem provides incite and provokes questions about the role of wu shaman practitioners in society and history.

====''Jiu Ge''====
{{Main|Jiu Ge}}
The ''Jiu Ge'' may be read as the lyrical preservation of a shamanic dramatic performance. Apparently typical of at least one variety of shamanism of the Chu area of the [[Yangzi River]] basin, the text exhibits a marked degree of eroticism in connection with shamanic invocations.

====Summoning the soul====
{{Further|Hun and po}}
Summoning the soul (''hun'') of the possibly dead was a feature of ancient culture. The 2 ''Chu Ci'' pieces of this type may be authentic transcriptions of such a process.

====Individual wu shaman====
{{Main|List of wu shaman}} 
Various individual wu shaman are alluded to in the ''Chu Ci''. In some cases the binomial nomenclature is unclear, referring perhaps to one or two persons; for example, in the case of Peng Xian, who appears likely to represent Wu Peng and Wu Xian,(Hawkes:70 and 84-86) which is a common type of morphological construction in Classical Chinese poetry. David Hawkes refers to some wu shaman as "Shaman Ancestors". Additionally, the distinction between humans and transcendent divinities tends not to be explicit in the received ''Chu Ci'' text. In some cases, the individual wu shaman are known from other sources, such as the ''[[Shanhaijing]]'' (''Classic of Mountains and Seas''). The name of some individual shaman includes "Wu" (巫) in the normal position of the family surname, for example, in the case of Wu Yang (巫陽, "Shaman Bright"). Wu Yang is the major speaker in ''Zhao Hun''/''Summons for the Soul''. He also appears in ''[[Shanhaijing]]'' together with Wu Peng (巫彭): 6 wu shaman are depicted together reviving a corpse, with Wu Peng holding the Herb of Immortality.(Hawkes:45 and 230-231)

==Modern wu==
[[File:Chuonnasuan, the last shaman of the Oroqen, in July 1994 (Photo by Richard Noll).jpg|thumb|The [[Oroqen people|Oroqen]] shaman Chuonnasuan in July 1994.]]
The ancient Chinese traditions of ''wu''-shamans continue in the contemporary cultures of China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan. Popular practices include clairvoyance, fortune telling, exorcism, invocation, and prayer.

Scholars have studied many aspects of modern ''wu''. De Groot (1910 6:1243-1268) provided descriptions and pictures of hereditary shamans in [[Fujian]], called ''saigong'' (pinyin ''shigong'') 師公. Paper (1999) analyzed ''tongji'' mediumistic activities in the Taiwanese village of Bao'an 保安. Noll (2004) documented Chuonnasuan (1927–2000), the last shaman of the [[Oroqen people|Oroqen]] in northeast China.

Jordan Paper summarizes the present-day shaman's religious significance.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Mediums, frequently associated with local temples … are ubiquitous aspects of popular Chinese religion. They are (or at least were into the mid-twentieth century) common from far north in Manchuria to the extreme south of Hainan and Guangtung, and from the eastern island of Taiwan to Tibet in China's far west. (1995:117-8) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

A '''zoo''' (short for '''zoological garden''' or '''zoological park''' and also called an '''animal park''' or '''menagerie''') is a facility in which all [[Animal|animals]] are housed within enclosures, displayed to the public, and in which they may also breed.

The term "zoological garden" refers to [[zoology]], the study of animals, a term deriving from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''zōon'' (ζῷον, 'animal') and ''lógos'' (λóγος, 'study'). The abbreviation "zoo" was first used of the [[London Zoological Gardens]], which was opened for scientific study in 1828 and to the public in 1857.&lt;ref name=ZSL&gt;[http://www.zsl.org/info/about-us/zsls-history,129,AR.html "ZSL's history"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228235326/http://www.zsl.org/info/about-us/zsls-history%2C129%2CAR.html |date=February 28, 2008 }}, Zoological Society of London.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of major animal collections open to the public around the world now exceeds 1,000 and approximately 80 percent of them are in cities.&lt;ref name=EBZoo/&gt; In the [[United States]] alone, zoos are visited by  over 180 million people annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Visitor Demographics|url=https://www.aza.org/partnerships-visitor-demographics|website=[[Association of Zoos and Aquariums]]|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The [[London Zoo]], which opened in 1826, was initially known as the "Gardens and Menagerie of the Zoological Society of London", and it described itself as a [[menagerie]] or "zoological forest".&lt;ref name=Blunt29&gt;Blunt 1976; Reichenbach 2002, pp. 151–163.&lt;/ref&gt; The abbreviation "zoo" first appeared in print in the United Kingdom around 1847, when it was used for the [[Bristol Zoo|Clifton Zoo]], but it was not until some 20 years later that the shortened form became popular in the song "[[Walking in the Zoo]]" by music-hall artist [[Alfred Vance]].&lt;ref name=Blunt29/&gt; The term "zoological park" was used for more expansive facilities in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]], [[National Zoological Park (United States)|Washington, D.C.]], and the [[Bronx Zoo|Bronx]] in New York, which opened in 1847, 1891 and 1899 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Hyson 2000, p. 29; Hyson 2003, pp. 1356-1357.&lt;/ref&gt;

Relatively new terms for zoos coined in the late 20th century are "conservation park" or "biopark". Adopting a new name is a strategy used by some zoo professionals to distance their institutions from the stereotypical and nowadays criticized zoo concept of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Maple 1995, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "biopark" was first coined and developed by the [[National Zoological Park (United States)|National Zoo in Washington D.C.]] in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson 1987a, pp. 10-17; Robinson 1987b, pp. 678-682.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the New York Zoological Society changed its name to the [[Wildlife Conservation Society]] and rebranded the zoos under its jurisdiction as "wildlife conservation parks".&lt;ref&gt;Conway 1995, pp. 259-276.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Royal menageries ===
{{further information|Menagerie}}
[[File:towrlndn.JPG|thumb|upright|right|The [[Tower of London]] housed [[England]]'s royal menagerie for several centuries (Picture from the 15th century, [[British Library]]).]]

The predecessor of the zoological garden is the [[menagerie]], which has a long history from the ancient world to modern times. The oldest known zoological collection was revealed during excavations at [[Hierakonpolis]], [[Egypt]] in 2009, of a ca. 3500 BCE menagerie. The exotic animals included [[hippopotamus|hippopotami]], [[hartebeest]], [[elephant]]s, [[baboon]]s and [[wildcat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;World's First Zoo - Hierakonpolis, Egypt, ''Archaeology Magazine'', http://www.archaeology.org/1001/topten/egypt.html&lt;/ref&gt; King [[Ashur-bel-kala]] of the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] created zoological and botanical gardens in the 11th century BCE. In the 2nd century BCE, the [[Emperor of China|Chinese Empress]] Tanki had a "house of deer" built, and [[King Wen of Zhou]] kept a {{convert|1500|acre|km2|adj=on}} zoo called ''Ling-Yu,'' or the Garden of Intelligence. Other well-known collectors of animals included [[King Solomon]] of the [[United Monarchy|Kingdom of Israel and Judah]], queen [[Semiramis]] and King [[Ashurbanipal]] of [[Assyria]], and King [[Nebuchadrezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]] of [[Babylonia]].&lt;ref name=EBZoo&gt;"Zoo," ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 4th century BCE, zoos existed in most of the Greek city states; [[Alexander the Great]] is known to have sent animals that he found on his military expeditions back to Greece. The Roman emperors kept private collections of animals for study or for use in the arena,&lt;ref name=EBZoo/&gt; the latter faring notoriously poorly. The 19th-century historian [[William Edward Hartpole Lecky|W. E. H. Lecky]] wrote of the [[Ludi Romani|Roman games]], first held in 366 BCE:

{{quote|At one time, a [[bear]] and a [[bull]], chained together, rolled in fierce combat across the sand ... Four hundred bears were killed in a single day under [[Caligula]] ... Under [[Nero]], four hundred [[tiger]]s fought with bulls and elephants. In a single day, at the dedication of the [[Colosseum]] by [[Titus]], five thousand animals perished. Under [[Trajan]] ... [[lion]]s, tigers, elephants, [[rhinoceros]]es, hippopotami, giraffes, bulls, stags, even crocodiles and serpents were employed to give novelty to the spectacle.&lt;ref&gt;Lecky, W.E.H. ''History of European Morals from Augustus to Charlemagne''. Vol. 1, Longmans, 1869, pp. 280-282.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Charlemagne]] had an elephant named [[Abul-Abbas]] that was given to him by the Abbasid Caliph. [[Henry I of England]] kept a collection of animals at his palace in [[Woodstock, Oxfordshire|Woodstock]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;which reportedly included lions, leopards, and camels.&lt;ref name=Blunt15&gt;Blunt, Wilfred. ''The Ark in the Park: The Zoo in the Nineteenth Century''. Hamish Hamilton, 1976, pp. 15-17.&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent collection in medieval England was in the [[Tower of London]], created as early as 1204 by King [[John I of England|John I]].

[[Henry III of England|Henry III]] received a wedding gift in 1235 of three leopards from [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]], and in 1264, the animals were moved to the Bulwark, renamed the Lion Tower, near the main western entrance of the Tower. It was opened to the public during the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4371908.stm "Big cats prowled London's tower"], BBC News, October 24, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 18th century, the price of admission was three half-pence, or the supply of a cat or dog for feeding to the lions.&lt;ref name=Blunt15/&gt; The animals were moved to the London Zoo when it opened.

[[Aztec]] emperor [[Moctezuma II|Moctezuma]] had in his capital city of [[Tenochtitlan]] a "house of animals" with a large collection of birds, mammals and reptiles in a garden tended by more than 600 employees. The garden was described by several Spanish conquerors, including [[Hernán Cortés]] in 1520. After the Aztec revolt against the Spanish rule, and during the subsequent battle for the city, Cortés reluctantly ordered the zoo to be destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Martín del Campo y Sánchez|first1=Rafael|title=El parque zoológico de Moctezuma en Tenochtitlán|url=http://repositorio.fciencias.unam.mx:8080/jspui/bitstream/11154/143305/1/38VParqueZool%C3%B3gico.pdf|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Enlightenment Era ===
[[File:Versailles M2.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] menagerie during the reign of [[Louis XIV]] in the 17th century]]
{{further information|List of zoos}}

The oldest zoo in the world still in existence is the [[Tiergarten Schönbrunn]] in [[Vienna]], Austria. It was constructed by [[Adrian van Stekhoven]] in 1752 at the order of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]], husband of [[Maria Theresa of Austria]], to serve as an imperial [[menagerie]] as part of [[Schönbrunn Palace]]. The menagerie was initially reserved for the viewing pleasure of the imperial family and the court, but was made accessible to the public in 1765.

In 1775, a zoo was founded in Madrid, and in 1795, the zoo inside the ''[[Jardin des Plantes]]'' in Paris was founded by [[Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre|Jacques-Henri Bernardin]], with animals from the royal menagerie at Versailles, primarily for scientific research and education. The [[Kazan Zoo]], the first zoo in [[Russia]] was founded in 1806 by the Professor of [[Kazan State University]] [[Karl Fuchs (museum founder)|Karl Fuchs]].

=== The modern zoo ===
Until the early 19th century, the function of the zoo was often to symbolize royal power, like King [[Louis XIV]]'s [[menagerie]] at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]]. The modern zoo that emerged in the early 19th century at [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], [[London]], [[Paris]] and [[Dublin]], was focused on providing educational exhibits to the public for entertainment and inspiration.&lt;ref name=Zsl2012&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zsl.org/education/the-modern-zoo/introducing-the-modern-zoo,438,AR.html |title=Introducing the Modern Zoo|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A growing fascination for [[natural history]] and [[zoology]], coupled with the tremendous expansion in the [[urbanization]] of [[London]], led to a heightened demand for a greater variety of public forms of entertainment to be made available. The need for public entertainment, as well as the requirements of scholarly research, came together in the founding of the first modern zoos.
[[File:View of the Zoological Gardens1835.jpg|thumb|[[London Zoo]], 1835]]

The [[Zoological Society of London]] was founded in 1826 by [[Stamford Raffles]] and established the [[London Zoo]] in [[Regent's Park]] two years later in 1828.&lt;ref name="science-history"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.todayinsci.com/4/4_27.htm | title = April 27 | publisher = Today in Science History | accessdate =5 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its founding, it was the world's first scientific zoo.&lt;ref name=EBZoo/&gt;&lt;ref name="ZSL-history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zsl.org/info/about-us/zsls-history,129,AR.html |title=ZSL's History |publisher=[[Zoological Society of London|ZSL]] |accessdate=5 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228235326/http://www.zsl.org/info/about-us/zsls-history%2C129%2CAR.html |archivedate=28 February 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally intended to be used as a collection for [[science|scientific study]], it was eventually opened to the public in 1847.&lt;ref name="ZSL-history" /&gt; The Zoo was located in [[Regent's Park]] - then undergoing development at the hands of the architect [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]]. What set the London zoo apart from its predecessors was its focus on society at large. The zoo was established in the middle of a city for the public, and its layout was designed to cater for the large London population. The London zoo was widely copied as the archetype of the public city zoo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://designforlife.com.sg/thesis/12history.html|title=The Role of Architectural Design in Promoting the Social Objectives of Zoos|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1853, the Zoo opened the world's first [[public aquarium]].

[[Downs' Zoological Gardens]] created by [[Andrew Downs]] and opened to the Nova Scotia public in 1847. It was originally intended to be used as a collection for scientific study. By the early 1860s, the zoo grounds covered 40 hectares with many fine flowers &amp; ornamental trees, picnic areas, statues, walking paths, The Glass House (which contained a greenhouse with an aviary, aquarium, &amp; museum of stuffed animals &amp; birds), a pond, a bridge over a waterfall, an artificial lake with a fountain, a wood-ornamented greenhouse, a forest area, and enclosures &amp; buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cu0SAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Andrew+Downs%22+Halifax&amp;dq=%22Andrew+Downs%22+Halifax&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiIhN3K06vTAhWhgVQKHdKdB1wQ6AEIMzAD|title=The Dalhousie Review|first=Herbert Leslie|last=Stewart|date=29 December 2017|publisher=Dalhousie University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/halifax-zoological-gardens-1.3207653|title=Did you know the first zoo in Canada and the U.S. was in Halifax?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.saltscapes.com/people-culture-section/people-culture-category/1089-zoo-diary.html|title=Zoo Diary - Saltscapes Magazine|first=Scott|last=Noble|website=Saltscapes Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dublin Zoo]] was opened in 1831 by members of the medical profession interested in studying animals while they were alive and more particularly getting hold of them when they were dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/the-great-zoos-who-2669960.html | work=Irish Independent | first=John | last=Costello | title=The great zoo's who | date=June 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first zoological garden in [[Australia]] was [[Melbourne Zoo]] in 1860. In the same year, [[Central Park Zoo]], the first public zoo in the United States, opened in New York, although in 1859, the [[Philadelphia Zoo|Philadelphia Zoological Society]] had made an effort to establish a zoo, but delayed opening it until 1874 because of the [[American Civil War]].

In 1907, the [[Germany|German]] entrepreneur [[Carl Hagenbeck]] founded the [[Tierpark Hagenbeck]] in Stellingen, now a quarter of [[Hamburg]]. His zoo was a radical departure from the layout of the zoo that had been established in 1828. It was the first zoo to use open enclosures surrounded by moats, rather than barred cages, to better approximate animals' natural environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=[[National Audubon Society]] |work=Audubon Magazine |title=The New Zoo |url=http://audubonmagazine.org/features0111/newzoo.html |author=Rene S. Ebersole |date=November 2001 |accessdate=2007-12-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070906144905/http://www.audubonmagazine.org/features0111/newzoo.html |archivedate=2007-09-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also set up mixed-species exhibits and based the layout on the different organizing principle of geography, as opposed to taxonomy.

When [[ecology]] emerged as a matter of public interest in the 1970s, a few zoos began to consider making conservation their central role, with [[Gerald Durrell]] of the [[Durrell Wildlife Park|Jersey Zoo]], George Rabb of [[Brookfield Zoo]], and William Conway of the [[Bronx Zoo]] ([[Wildlife Conservation Society]]) leading the discussion. From then on, zoo professionals became increasingly aware of the need to engage themselves in conservation programs, and the [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums|American Zoo Association]] soon said that conservation was its highest priority.&lt;ref&gt;See Kisling, Vernon N. (ed.): ''Zoo and Aquarium History'', Boca Raton 2001. {{ISBN|0-8493-2100-X}}; Hoage, R. J. Deiss and William A.

''A Different Nature'', Berkeley 2001. {{ISBN|0-520-21879-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to stress conservation issues, many large zoos stopped the practice of having animals perform tricks for visitors. The [[Detroit Zoo]], for example, stopped its elephant show in 1969, and its chimpanzee show in 1983, acknowledging that the trainers had probably abused the animals to get them to perform.&lt;ref&gt;Donahue, Jesse and Trump, Erik. ''Political Animals: Public Art in American Zoos and Aquariums''.
Lexington Books, 2007, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Whipsnade Park]] in [[Bedfordshire]], [[England]], was opened in 1931 as the first safari park. It allowed visitors to drive through the enclosures and come into close proximity with the animals.

The [[Wrocław Zoo]] ({{lang-pl|Ogród Zoologiczny we Wrocławiu}}), the oldest zoo in Poland opened in 1865 and was home to about 10,500 animals representing about 1,132 species (in terms of the number of animal species it is the third largest in the world&lt;ref&gt;[http://wroclaw.wyborcza.pl/wroclaw/1,35771,19502168,wielkie-liczenie-w-zoo-we-wroclawiu-zobacz-ile-zwierzat-w.html Wielkie liczenie w zoo we Wrocławiu. Zobacz, ile zwierząt w nim mieszka]&lt;/ref&gt;). In 2014 the Wrocław Zoo opened the [[Africarium]], the only themed [[oceanarium]] devoted solely to exhibiting the [[fauna of Africa]], comprehensively presenting selected ecosystems from the continent of [[Africa]]. Housing over 10 thousand animals, the facility's breadth extends from housing insects such cockroaches to the large mammals like the elephants on an area of over 33 [[hectare]]s &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Isler |first1=Danuta |title=A trip to Wroclaw Afrykarium |url=http://www.thenews.pl/1/6/Artykul/365527,A-trip-to-Wroclaw-Afrykarium |website=Radio Poland |publisher=Radio Poland}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

[[habitat destruction|Mass destruction of wildlife habitat]] has yet to cease all over the world and many species such as [[elephants]], big cats, [[Penguin|penguins]], tropical birds, primates, [[Rhinoceros|rhinos]], exotic reptiles, and many others are in danger of dying out. Many of today's zoos hope to stop or slow the decline of many endangered species and see their primary purpose as breeding endangered species in captivity and reintroducing them into the wild. Modern zoos also aim to help teach visitors the importance on animal conservation, often through letting visitors witness the animals firsthand.&lt;ref name="Masci, David 2014"&gt;Masci, David. "Zoos in the 21st Century." CQ Researcher 28 Apr. 2000: 353-76. Web. 26 Jan. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics and the majority of animal rights activists say that zoos, no matter what their intentions are, or how noble they are, are immoral and serve as nothing but to fulfill human leisure at the expense of the animals (which is an opinion that has spread over the years). However, zoo advocates argue that their efforts make a difference in wildlife conservation and education.&lt;ref name="Masci, David 2014"/&gt;

=== Human exhibits ===
[[File:Ota Benga at Bronx Zoo.jpg|right|thumb|[[Ota Benga]], a human exhibit in New York, 1906]]
{{further information|Human zoo|Scientific racism|Social Darwinism}}

Human beings were sometimes displayed in cages along with non-human animals, to illustrate the differences between people of [[Europe]]an and non-European origin. In September 1906, [[William Temple Hornaday|William Hornaday]], director of the [[Bronx Zoo]] in New York&amp;mdash;with the agreement of [[Madison Grant]], head of the [[New York Zoological Society]]&amp;mdash;had [[Ota Benga]], a Congolese [[pygmy]], displayed in a cage with the chimpanzees, then with an [[orangutan]] named Dohong, and a parrot. The exhibit was intended as an example of the "missing link" between the orangutan and white man. It triggered protests from the city's clergymen, but the public reportedly flocked to see it.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, Phillips Verner and Blume, Harvey. ''Ota Benga: The Pygmy in the Zoo''.  St. Martins Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTBenga&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C04E7D81F3EE733A25753C1A96F9C946797D6CF "Man and Monkey Show Disapproved by Clergy"], ''The New York Times'', September 10, 1906.&lt;/ref&gt;

Human beings were also displayed in cages during the 1931 [[Paris Colonial Exposition]], and as late as 1958 in a "Congolese village" display at [[Expo '58]] in Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, Pascal; Bancel, Nicolas; and Lemaire, Sandrine.

Zoo animals live in enclosures that often attempt to replicate their natural [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]]s or behavioral patterns, for the benefit of both the animals and visitors. [[Nocturnal]] animals are often housed in buildings with a reversed light-dark cycle, i.e. only dim white or red lights are on during the day so the animals are active during visitor hours, and brighter lights on at night when the animals sleep. Special climate conditions may be created for animals living in extreme environments, such as penguins. Special enclosures for [[bird]]s, [[mammal]]s, [[insect]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[fish]], and other aquatic life forms have also been developed. Some zoos have walk-through exhibits where visitors enter enclosures of non-aggressive species, such as [[lemur]]s, [[marmoset]]s, birds, [[lizard]]s, and [[turtle]]s. Visitors are asked to keep to paths and avoid showing or eating foods that the animals might snatch.

=== Safari park ===
{{main article|Safari park}}
[[File:Giraffes at west midlands safari park.jpg|thumb|right|[[Giraffe]]s in the [[West Midland Safari Park]]]]

Some zoos keep animals in larger, outdoor enclosures, confining them with [[moat]]s and fences, rather than in cages. [[Safari park]]s, also known as zoo parks and lion farms, allow visitors to drive through them and come in close proximity to the animals.&lt;ref name=EBZoo/&gt; Sometimes, visitors are able to feed animals through the car windows. The first safari park was [[Whipsnade Zoo|Whipsnade Park]] in Bedfordshire, England, opened by the [[Zoological Society of London]] in 1931 which today (2014) covers 600 acres (2.4&amp;nbsp;km²). Since the early 1970s, an 1,800 acre (7&amp;nbsp;km²) park in the San Pasqual Valley near San Diego has featured the [[San Diego Zoo Safari Park]], run by the Zoological Society of San Diego. One of two state-supported zoo parks in North Carolina is the {{convert|2000|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[North Carolina Zoo]] in Asheboro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ferral |first=Katelyn |url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2010/07/15/582114/nc-zoo-bucking-a-trend-sets-an.html |title=N.C.

=== Aquaria ===
{{further|Public aquarium}}
[[File:Seals@melb zoo.jpg|thumb|right|Sea lions at the [[Melbourne Zoo]]]]

The first [[public aquarium]] was opened at the London Zoo in 1853. This was followed by the opening of public aquaria in continental Europe (e.g. Paris in 1859, Hamburg in 1864, Berlin in 1869, and Brighton in 1872) and the United States (e.g. Boston in 1859, Washington in 1873, San Francisco Woodward's Garden in 1873, and the New York Aquarium at [[Battery Park]] in 1896).

=== Roadside zoos ===
Roadside zoos are found throughout [[North America]], particularly in remote locations. They are often small, for-profit zoos, often intended to attract visitors to some other facility, such as a gas station. The animals may be trained to perform tricks, and visitors are able to get closer to them than in larger zoos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theguzoo.com/main_page.html Guzoo Animal Farm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510051708/http://www.theguzoo.com/main_page.html |date=May 10, 2008 }}, website about Canadian roadside zoos, accessed June 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Since they are sometimes less regulated, roadside zoos are often subject to accusations of [[neglect]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KeoyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0AcGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2373,1804633&amp;dq=roadside-zoo&amp;hl=en Roadside zoo animals starving.] ''Free Lance-Star.'' 11 Jan. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cruelty to animals|cruelty]].&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, Jennifer.

=== Petting zoos ===
{{main article|Petting zoo}}

A petting zoo, also called petting farms or children's zoos, features a combination of [[domestic animal]]s and wild species that are docile enough to touch and feed. To ensure the animals' health, the food is supplied by the zoo, either from vending machines or a kiosk nearby.

=== Animal theme parks ===
{{main article|Animal theme park}}

An animal theme park is a combination of an [[amusement park]] and a zoo, mainly for entertaining and commercial purposes. [[Marine mammal park]]s such as [[SeaWorld|Sea World]] and [[Marineland of Florida|Marineland]] are more elaborate [[dolphinarium]]s keeping [[whale]]s, and containing additional entertainment attractions. Another kind of animal theme park contains more entertainment and amusement elements than the classical zoo, such as a stage shows, roller coasters, and mythical creatures. Some examples are [[Busch Gardens Tampa Bay]] in [[Tampa, Florida]], [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]] and [[Gatorland]] in [[Orlando, Florida]], [[Flamingo Land]] in [[North Yorkshire, England]], and [[Six Flags Discovery Kingdom]] in [[Vallejo, California]].

== Sources of animals ==
By the year 2000 most animals being displayed in zoos were the offspring of other zoo animals.  This trend, however was and still is somewhat species-specific. When animals are transferred between zoos, they usually spend time in quarantine, and are given time to acclimatize to their new enclosures which are often designed to mimic their natural environment. For example, some species of penguins may require refrigerated enclosures. Guidelines on necessary care for such animals is published in the ''International Zoo Yearbook''.&lt;ref name=EBProcurement&gt;"Zoo: Procurement and care of animals," ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Justification ==

=== Conservation and research ===
[[File:NCZooelephants.jpg|thumb|right|The African plains exhibit at [[North Carolina Zoo]] illustrates the dimension of an open-range zoo.]]

The position of most modern zoos in [[Australasia]], Asia, Europe, and North America, particularly those with scientific societies, is that they display wild animals primarily for the [[conservation biology|conservation]] of endangered [[species]], as well as for [[Animal testing|research purposes]] and education, and secondarily for the entertainment of visitors,&lt;ref&gt;Tudge, Colin. ''Last Animals in the Zoo: How Mass Extinction Can Be Stopped'', London 1991. {{ISBN|1-55963-157-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biaza.org.uk/resources/library/images/MANIFESTO.pdf "Manifesto for Zoos"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823075916/http://www.biaza.org.uk/resources/library/images/MANIFESTO.pdf |date=August 23, 2006 }}, John Regan Associates, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; an argument disputed by critics. The Zoological Society of London states in its charter that its aim is "the advancement of Zoology and Animal Physiology and the introduction of new and curious subjects of the Animal Kingdom." It maintains two research institutes, the Nuffield Institute of Comparative Medicine and the Wellcome Institute of Comparative Physiology. In the U.S., the Penrose Research Laboratory of the Philadelphia Zoo focuses on the study of comparative [[pathology]].&lt;ref name=EBZoo/&gt; The World Association of Zoos and Aquariums produced its first conservation strategy in 1993, and in November 2004, it adopted a new strategy that sets out the aims and mission of zoological gardens of the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waza.org/conservation/wzacs.php "World Zoo and Aquarium Conservation Strategy"], World Association of Zoos and Aquariums.&lt;/ref&gt;

The breeding of endangered species is coordinated by cooperative breeding programmes containing international studbooks and coordinators, who evaluate the roles of individual animals and institutions from a global or regional perspective, and there are regional programmes all over the world for the conservation of [[endangered species]].&lt;ref&gt;In Africa, conservation is handled by the African Preservation Program APP (African Association of Zoological Gardens and Aquaria; in the U.S. and Canada by Species Survival Plans ([http://www.aza.org/ American Zoo and Aquarium Association]), and the [http://www.caza.ca/ Canadian Association of Zoos and Aquariums]); in Australasia, by the Australasian Species Management Program ([http://www.arazpa.org.au/ASMP_Committee.htm Australasian Regional Association of Zoological Parks and Aquaria] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202150900/http://arazpa.org.au/ASMP_Committee.htm |date=2007-02-02 }}); in Europe, by the European Endangered Species Program ([http://www.eaza.net/ European Association of Zoos and Aquaria]); and in Japan, South Asia, and South East Asia, by the Japanese Association of Zoos and Aquariums, the South Asian Zoo Association for Regional Cooperation, and the South East Asian Zoo Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides conservation of captive species, large zoos may form a suitable environment for wild native animals such as [[heron]]s to live in or visit. A colony of [[black-crowned night heron]]s has regularly summered at the [[National Zoological Park (United States)|National Zoo]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] for more than a century.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian's mystery of the black-crowned night herons solved by satellites"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Akpan|first1=Nsikan|title=Smithsonian's mystery of the black-crowned night herons solved by satellites|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/sciencescope-smithsonians-mystery-black-crowned-night-herons-solved-satellites/|website=PBS News Hour|publisher=PBS|accessdate=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some zoos may provide information to visitors on wild animals visiting or living in the zoo, or encourage them by directing them to specific feeding or breeding platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Birdworld Animals|url=http://birdworld.co.uk/animals/|website=Birdworld|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tiergarten&gt;{{cite web |title=Graureiher |url=https://www.zoovienna.at/tiere/voegel/graureiher/ |publisher=Tiergarten Schoenbrunn |accessdate=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Roadside zoos ==
In modern, well-regulated zoos, breeding is controlled to maintain a self-sustaining, global captive population.  This is not the case in some less well-regulated zoos, often based in poorer regions. Overall "stock turnover" of animals during a year in a select group of poor zoos was reported as 20%-25% with 75% of wild caught apes dying in captivity within the first 20 months.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, Derrick and Tweedy-Holmes Karen. ''Thought to exist in the wild: awakening from the nightmare of zoos''. No Voice Unheard, 2007, p. 21; Baratay, Eric and Hardouin-Fugier, Elisabeth. ''Zoo: A History of the Zoological Gardens of the West''. Reaktion, London. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of the report stated that before successful breeding programs, the high mortality rate was the reason for the "massive scale of importations."

One 2-year study indicated that of 19,361 mammals that left accredited zoos in the U.S. between 1992 and 1998, 7,420 (38%) went to dealers, auctions, hunting ranches, unaccredited zoos and individuals, and game farms.&lt;ref&gt;Goldston, Linda. February 11, 1999, cited in Scully, Matthew. ''Dominion''. St. Martin's Griffin, 2004 (paperback), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Animal welfare concerns ==
{{further information|Captivity (animal)|Behavioral enrichment}}
[[File:Dalian zoo bear cages, 1997.jpg|right|thumb|Bear cages, one square meter in size, in Dalian zoo, Port Arthur, Liaoning Province, China, in 1997]]

The welfare of zoo animals varies widely. Many zoos work to improve their animal enclosures and make it fit the animals' needs, although constraints such as size and expense make it difficult to create ideal captive environments for many species.&lt;ref&gt;Norton, Bryan G.; Hutchins, Michael; Stevens, Elizabeth F.; Maple, Terry L. (ed.): ''Ethics on the Ark. Zoos, Animal Welfare, and Wildlife Conservation''. Washington, D.C., 1995. {{ISBN|1-56098-515-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malmud, Randy. ''Reading Zoos. Representations of Animals and Captivity''. New York, 1998. {{ISBN|0-8147-5602-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study examining data collected over four decades found that [[polar bear]]s, lions, tigers and [[cheetah]]s show evidence of stress in captivity.&lt;ref name=MarkNYT2003&gt;Derr, Mark. "Big Beasts, Tight Space and a Call for Change in Journal Report," ''The New York Times'', October 2, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Zoos can be internment camps for animals, but also a place of refuge. A zoo can be considered an internment camp due to the insufficient enclosures that the animals have to live in.  When an elephant is placed in a pen that is flat, has no tree, no other elephants and only a few plastic toys to play with; it can lead to boredom and foot problems (Lemonic, McDowel, and Bjerklie 50). Also, animals can have a shorter life span when they are in these types of enclosures. Causes can be human diseases, materials in the cages, and possible escape attempts (Bendow 382).  However, when zoos take time to think about the animal's welfare, zoos can become a place of refuge. There are animals that are injured in the wild and are unable to survive on their own, but in the zoos they can live out the rest of their lives healthy and happy (McGaffin). In recent years, some zoos have chosen to stop showing their larger animals because they are simply unable to provide an adequate enclosure for them (Lemonic, McDowell, and Bjerklie 50).

=== Moral concerns ===
Some critics and many animal rights activists argue that zoo animals are treated as voyeuristic objects, rather than living creatures, and often suffer due to the transition from being free and wild to captivity.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; In the last 2 decades, European and North-American zoos, strongly depend on breeding within zoos, while decreasing the number of wild caught animals.{{Clarify|date=September 2015}}

=== Behavioural restriction ===
Many modern zoos attempt to improve animal welfare by providing more space and [[behavioural enrichment]]s.  This often involves housing the animals in naturalistic enclosures that allow the animals to express some of their natural behaviours, such as roaming and foraging. However, many animals remain in barren concrete enclosures or other minimally enriched cages.&lt;ref name=Masci2000&gt;{{cite journal|author=Masci, D.|title=Zoos in the 21st century.|journal=CQ Researcher|year=2000|pages=353–76|url=http://www.cqpress.com/product/Researcher-Zoos-in-the-21st-Century.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animals which naturally range over many km each day, or make seasonal migrations, are unable to perform these behaviors in zoo enclosures. For example, elephants usually travel approximately {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on}} each day.&lt;ref name="Are zoos good"&gt;{{cite web|title=Are Zoos good or bad for animals?|url=http://animal.discovery.com/animal-facts/zoos-good-or-bad.htm|accessdate=28 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030041017/http://animal.discovery.com/animal-facts/zoos-good-or-bad.htm|archive-date=30 October 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abnormal behaviour ===
{{further information|List of abnormal behaviours in animals}}

Animals in zoos often exhibit behaviors that are abnormal in their frequency, intensity, or would not normally be part of their [[Ethogram|behavioural repertoire]]. These are usually indicative of stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Perspective On Zoos |url=https://www.theperspective.com/debates/living/the-perspective-on-zoos/ |publisher=The Perspective |date=27 September 2017 |accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, elephants sometimes perform head-bobbing, bears sometimes pace repeatedly around the limits of their enclosure, wild cats sometimes groom themselves obsessively, and birds pluck out their own feathers.&lt;ref name="Are zoos good" /&gt; Some critics of zoos claim that the animals are always under physical and mental stress, regardless of the quality of care towards the animals.&lt;ref name=Sterm2005&gt;{{cite web|author=Sterm, A.|date=28 February 2005|title=Elephant deaths at zoos reignite animal debate: Zoo supporters cite conservation, activists cite confined spaces|publisher=MSNBC/Reuters|url=http://www.elephants.com/media/MSNBC_2_28_05.htm|accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elephants have been recorded displaying [[Stereotypy (non-human)|stereotypical behaviours]] in the form of swaying back and forth, trunk swaying or route tracing. This has been observed in 54% of individuals in UK zoos.&lt;ref name=Harrisetal.2008&gt;{{cite web|author1=Harris, M. |author2=Sherwin, C. |author3=Harris, S. |url=http://randd.defra.gov.uk/Document.aspx?Document=WC05007_7719_FRP.pdf|title=Defra Final Report on Elephant Welfare|publisher=University of Bristol|date=10 November 2008|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shortened longevity ===
Elephants in Japanese zoos have shorter lifespans than their wild counterparts at only 17 years, although other studies suggest that zoo elephants live as long as those in the wild.&lt;ref name=Mott2008&gt;{{cite web|author=Mott, M.|date=11 December 2008|title=Wild elephants live longer than their zoo counterparts|publisher=National Geographic News|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/12/081211-zoo-elephants.html|accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, many other animals, such as reptiles, can live much longer than they would in the wild.

=== Climate concerns ===
Climatic conditions can make it difficult to keep some animals in zoos in some locations. For example, [[Alaska Zoo]] had an elephant named Maggie. She was housed in a small, indoor enclosure because the outdoor temperature was too low.&lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune 2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kershaw|first1=Sarah|title=Alaska's lone zoo elephant heats up national debate|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-01-10/news/0501100102_1_elephant-experts-alaska-zoo-asian-elephant|accessdate=23 January 2016|agency=Chicago Tribune|date=10 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NBC2007&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pemberton|first1=Mary|title=Alaska's only elephant heads to California|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/21587690/ns/technology_and_science-science/t/alaskas-only-elephant-heads-california/#.VqLQkVN95Fw|accessdate=23 January 2016|agency=NBC|date=11 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Surplus animals ==
Especially in large animals, a limited number of spaces are available in zoos. As a consequence, various management tools are used to preserve the space for the most "valuable" individuals and reduce the risk of [[inbreeding]]. Management of animal populations is typically through international organizations such as [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums|AZA]] and [[EAZA]].&lt;ref name=PQA/&gt; Zoos have several different ways of managing the animal populations, such as moves between zoos, [[Wildlife contraceptive|contraception]], sale of excess animals and euthanization (culling).&lt;ref name=WMC/&gt;

Contraception can be effective, but may also have health repercussions and can be difficult (or even impossible) to reverse in some animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What happens when zoo contraceptives work too well?|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/what-happens-when-zoo-contraceptives-work-too-well/article_8e71a4c4-2cd1-58d7-b8af-8fe8eb1be30c.html|publisher=St. Louis Dispatch|author=Hunn, D.|date=February 16, 2014|accessdate=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, some species may lose their reproductive capability entirely if prevented from breeding for a period (whether through contraceptives or isolation), but further study is needed on the subject.&lt;ref name=PQA&gt;{{cite journal|title=Population Q&amp;A|journal=Zooquaria|publisher=EAZA|volume=Autumn 2016|issue=94|pages=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sale of surplus animals from zoos was once common and in some cases animals have ended up in substandard facilities. In recent decades the practice of selling animals from certified zoos has declined.&lt;ref name=WMC&gt;{{cite book|title=Wild Mammals in Captivity|year=2010|author=Kleiman, Thompson and Baer|pages=265–266|isbn=978-0-226-44009-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of animals are culled each year in zoos, but this is controversial.&lt;ref name=HPMG&gt;{{cite web|title=Marius The Giraffe Was Not Alone: Zoos in Europe Kill 5,000 Healthy Animals Annually|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/02/27/marius-giraffe-zoos-cull_n_4865542.html|publisher=Huffington Post|date=February 27, 2014|accessdate=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A highly publicized culling as part of population management was that of [[Marius (giraffe)|a healthy giraffe]] at Copenhagen Zoo in 2014. The zoo argued that its genes already were well-represented in captivity, making the giraffe unsuitable for future breeding. There were offers to adopt it and an online petition to save it had many thousand signatories, but the culling proceeded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Copenhagen Zoo kills 'surplus' young giraffe Marius despite online petition.|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/copenhagen-zoo-kills-surplus-young-giraffe-marius-despite-online-petition-9117317.html|publisher=The Independent|author=Johnston, I.|date=February 9, 2014|accessdate=February 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although zoos in some countries have been open about culling, the controversy of the subject and pressure from the public has resulted in others being closed.&lt;ref name=WMC/&gt; This stands in contrast to most zoos publicly announcing animal births.&lt;ref name=WMC/&gt; Furthermore, while many zoos are willing to cull smaller and/or low-profile animals, fewer are willing to do it with larger high-profile species.&lt;ref name=WMC/&gt;&lt;ref name=HPMG/&gt;

== Live feeding and "baiting" ==

In many countries, feeding live vertebrates to zoo animals is illegal, except in exceptional circumstances.{{cn|date=August 2017}}  For example, some snakes refuse to eat dead prey. However, in the Badaltearing Safari Park in [[China]], visitors can throw live goats into the lion enclosure and watch them being eaten, or can purchase live [[chicken]]s tied to [[bamboo]] rods for the equivalent of 2 [[dollars]]/[[euros]] to dangle into lion pens.  Visitors can drive through the lion compound in buses with specially designed chutes which they can use to push live chickens into the enclosure. In the Xiongsen Bear and Tiger Mountain Village near Guilin in south-east China, live cows and pigs are thrown to tigers to amuse visitors.&lt;ref name=Penman&gt;{{cite news|author=Penman, D|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-506153/Animals-torn-pieces-lions-baying-crowds-spectator-sport-China-DOESNT-want-see.html|title=Animals torn to pieces by lions in front of baying crowds: The spectator sport China DOESN'T want you to see.|publisher=The Daily Mail|date=January 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lairweb1999&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lairweb.org.nz/tiger/release7.html|title=Ferocity training|publisher=Sunday Morning Post, Hong Kong|date=November 29, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Qingdao zoo (Eastern China), visitors can engage in "tortoise baiting", where tortoises are kept inside small rooms with elastic bands around their necks so that they are unable to retract their heads. Visitors are allowed to throw coins at them. The marketing claim is that if a person hits one of the tortoises on the head and makes a wish, it will be fulfilled.&lt;ref name=Penman/&gt;

== Regulation ==
[[File:WPA Zoo Poster (Elephant).jpg|thumb|upright|WPA 1937 poster promoting visits to American zoos]]

=== United States ===
In the United States, any public animal exhibit must be licensed and inspected by the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]], the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]], and the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]]. Depending on the animals they exhibit, the activities of zoos are regulated by laws including the [[Endangered Species Act]], the [[Animal Welfare Act of 1966|Animal Welfare Act]], the [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918]] and others.&lt;ref  name=Grech&gt;Grech, Kali S. [http://www.animallaw.info/articles/ovuszoos.htm "Overview of the Laws Affecting Zoos"], Michigan State University College of Law, Animal Legal &amp; Historical Center, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, zoos in North America may choose to pursue accreditation by the [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums]] (AZA). To achieve accreditation, a zoo must pass an application and inspection process and meet or exceed the AZA's standards for animal health and welfare, fundraising, zoo staffing, and involvement in global conservation efforts. Inspection is performed by three experts (typically one veterinarian, one expert in animal care, and one expert in zoo management and operations) and then reviewed by a panel of twelve experts before accreditation is awarded. This accreditation process is repeated once every five years. The AZA estimates that there are approximately 2,400 animal exhibits operating under USDA license as of February 2007; fewer than 10% are accredited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aza.org/Accreditation/AccreditationIntro/ AZA Accreditation Introduction] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102132956/http://www.aza.org/Accreditation/AccreditationIntro/ |date=November 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
In April 1999, the [[European Union]] introduced a directive to strengthen the conservation role of zoos, making it a statutory requirement that they participate in conservation and education, and requiring all member states to set up systems for their licensing and inspection.&lt;ref name=Defra/&gt; Zoos are regulated in the UK by the Zoo Licensing Act of 1981, which came into effect in 1984. A zoo is defined as any "establishment where wild animals are kept for exhibition ... to which members of the public have access, with or without charge for admission, seven or more days in any period of twelve consecutive months", excluding circuses and pet shops. The Act requires that all zoos be inspected and licensed, and that animals kept in enclosures are provided with a suitable environment in which they can express most normal behavior.&lt;ref name=Defra&gt;[http://www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/gwd/zoo.htm "The Zoo Licensing Act 1981"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504172909/http://www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/gwd/zoo.htm |date=May 4, 2008 }}, Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs.&lt;/ref&gt;
