In 2004 '''Abdullah Baybaşin''' was accused of being [[Illegal drug trade|drug dealer]] in [[London]]. He had been convicted of drug charges in 2006 involving up to {{convert|5.5|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of [[heroin]] and sentenced to 22 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Turkish drug gang leader jailed for 22 years|url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/may/16/drugsandalcohol.drugstrade|newspaper = The Guardian|date = 2006-05-15|access-date = 2016-02-10|issn = 0261-3077|language = en-GB|first = David|last = Pallister}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the [[Court of Appeal (England and Wales)|Court of Appeal]] in 2010 ordered a retrial on the drugs charge after deeming that the judge’s summing up of the evidence at the trial was unfair.

On 22 October 2010, A judge at [[Woolwich Crown Court]] in London ordered the retrial jury to find Baybasin not guilty because the lack of prosecution evidence meant that a conviction would be unsafe. Judge Charles Byers said that there was no direct evidence and very little circumstantial evidence of Baybasin's involvement in a conspiracy to supply 5&amp;nbsp;lb (2.3&amp;nbsp;kg) of heroin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Fox 9 Minneapolis-St. Paul news and weather|url = http://www.myfoxtwincities.com/dpps/news/britains-heroin-godfather-freed-after-smuggling-retrial-collapses-dpgonc-20101022-bb_10242016|website = KMSP|access-date = 2016-02-10|language = en-US|last = FOX}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His family members claimed that Abdullah Baybaşin is a victim of injustice; he was wrongly accused by the [[Law enforcement in the United Kingdom|British Police]]. They alleged that he was convicted at the first trial despite the lack of any evidence against him, except the statement of a convicted felon, that turned out to be untruthful, unreliable and unsafe. It was also claimed that the British Press declared him guilty on the basis of hearsay without carrying out any kind of investigation into the accusations against him.&lt;ref&gt;https://publish.istanbul.indymedia.org/news/2010/10/269229.php{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 November 2010, Abdullah Baybasin was awarded £20,000 in damages by the Prison Services. The [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]] has accepted that Abdullah Baybasin who uses a wheelchair, suffered from degrading treatment and discrimination on account of his disability while he was in Belmarsh jail in London. On hearing the decision of the Ministry he said that " The treatment I received at HMP Belmarsh was very degrading and at times I struggled to cope. I thought I would die in prison, and often thought things would never get better."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Disabled prisoner to be paid £20,000 for discrimination at Belmarsh|url = https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/nov/08/disabled-prisoner-20000-compensation-belmarsh|newspaper = The Guardian|date = 2010-11-08|access-date = 2016-02-10|issn = 0261-3077|language = en-GB|first = Alan|last = Travis|first2 = home affairs|last2 = editor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alfred Hitchcock]] (1899–1980)&lt;ref name=BFI/&gt; was an [[English people|English]] [[filmmaker]] and [[film director|director]]. Popularly known as the "Master of Suspense" for his use of innovative film techniques in thrillers,&lt;ref name=BFI&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306194549/http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9ee3449d|archivedate=6 March 2016|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9ee3449d|title=Alfred Hitchcock|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Flint/&gt; Hitchcock started his career in the British film industry as a title designer and art director for a number of [[silent film]]s during the early 1920s, most of which are now [[Lost film|lost]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brentonfilm.com/articles/alfred-hitchcock-collectors-guide-miscellaneous-british-films|title=Alfred Hitchcock: Miscellaneous British Films|work=Brenton Film|accessdate=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His directorial debut was the 1925 release ''[[The Pleasure Garden (film)|The Pleasure Garden]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814115231/http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/features/hitchcock-mystery-tea-cup|archivedate=14 August 2016|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/features/hitchcock-mystery-tea-cup|title=Hitchcock and the mystery of the tea cup|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|date=17 January 2014|last=Dixon|first=Bryony}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchcock followed this with ''[[The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog]]'', his first commercial and critical success.&lt;ref name="D&amp;L"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2G5YBywx7UUC|last1=McGilligan |first1=Patrick |authorlink1=Patrick McGilligan (biographer) |title=Alfred Hitchcock: A Life in Darkness and Light|format=Google eBook|date=19 October 2010|publisher=[[Harper-Collins]] |location=New York |isbn=978-0-06-202864-8|pages=98, 764–777, 808}}&lt;/ref&gt; It featured many of the thematic elements his films would be known for such as an innocent man on the run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305020134/http://www.bfi.org.uk/distribution/the_lodger|archivedate=5 March 2016|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/distribution/the_lodger|title=The Lodger|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also featured the first of [[List of Alfred Hitchcock cameo appearances|his famous cameo appearances]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Michael|last=Walker|title=Hitchcock's Motifs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OWhZAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA88|year=2005|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=978-90-5356-773-9|pages=87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later he directed ''[[Blackmail (1929 film)|Blackmail]]'' (1929) which was his first [[sound film]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tours/hitch/tour4.html|archivedate=29 August 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160829024026/http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tours/hitch/tour4.html|title=Example: Blackmail: Silent and Sound: 1|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|last=Duguid|first=Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935 Hitchcock directed ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]''. Three years later he directed ''[[The Lady Vanishes]],'' starring [[Margaret Lockwood]] and [[Michael Redgrave]].

Hitchcock's British films – and many of his early American ones – are often mistakenly believed to be in the [[public domain]]. In fact, all of his films are under [[copyright]] in the US and UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brentonfilm.com/articles/alfred-hitchcock-collectors-guide#slaying-the-public-domain-myth|title=Alfred Hitchcock Collectors' Guide: Slaying the public domain myth|work=Brenton Film|accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brentonfilm.com/articles/alfred-hitchcock-dial-c-for-copyright|title=Alfred Hitchcock: Dial © for Copyright|work=Brenton Film|accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, [[Bootleg recording|bootlegs]] of his work continue to be widely disseminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brentonfilm.com/articles/bootlegs-galore-the-great-alfred-hitchcock-rip-off|title=Bootlegs Galore: The Great Alfred Hitchcock Rip-off|work=Brenton Film|accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, Hitchcock transitioned to [[Hollywood]] productions, the first of which was the psychological thriller ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'' starring [[Laurence Olivier]] and [[Joan Fontaine]]. He received his first nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Director]], and the film won [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1941|archivedate=12 March 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312195207/http://oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1941|title=The 13th Academy Awards|publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] (AMPAS)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchcock worked with Fontaine again the following year on the film ''[[Suspicion (1941 film)|Suspicion]]'' which also starred [[Cary Grant]]. In 1943, Hitchcock directed another psychological thriller ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' which starred [[Teresa Wright]] and [[Joseph Cotten]]. Three years later he reunited with Grant on ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' which also starred [[Ingrid Bergman]]. The film included a three-minute intermittent kissing scene between the leads shot specifically to skirt the [[Motion Picture Production Code]] which at the time limited such scenes to three seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-notorious-1946|title=Notorious Movie Review &amp; Film Summary (1946)|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202091651/http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-notorious-1946|archivedate=2 February 2017|last=Ebert|first=Roger|publisher=Roger Ebert|date=August 17, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, Hitchcock directed ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'' which starred [[James Stewart]]. The film was his first in [[Technicolor]] and is remembered for its use of [[long take]]s to make the film appear to be a single continuous shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/78315%7C0/Rope.html |title=Rope |publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6bq1XbkCW?url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/78315%7C0/Rope.html |archivedate=26 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=1 May 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later he directed ''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]'' (1951).

Hitchcock collaborated with [[Grace Kelly]] on three films: ''[[Dial M for Murder]]'' (1954), ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954) and ''[[To Catch a Thief]]'' (1955). For ''Rear Window'', Hitchcock received a nomination for Best Director at the [[Academy Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1955|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312160534/http://oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1955|archivedate=12 March 2017|title=The 27th Academy Awards|publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] (AMPAS)}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1955 marked his debut on television as the host of the anthology television series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' which he also produced.&lt;ref name=Flint&gt;{{cite news|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324152219/http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0813.html|archivedate=24 March 2016|date=30 April 1980|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0813.html|title=Alfred Hitchcock Dies; A Master of Suspense|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[Arthur Ochs Sulzberger]]|first=Peter B.|last=Flint}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, Hitchcock directed the psychological thriller ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' starring Stewart and [[Kim Novak]].

'''''Bibi Blocksberg''''' is a [[Germany|German]] [[Radio drama|audio drama]] series for children, created in 1980 by [[Elfie Donnelly]]. The main character is a girl called Bibi Blocksberg, who is a [[witch]]. As of winter 2009, there have been 95 episodes. The title of the series was ''Eene meene Hexerei''. This title was used for the first seven episodes, after which the series was renamed to ''Bibi Blocksberg''. The first episodes were later released under the new title and with a new cover. The old episodes are very sought after among collectors. The length of the episodes originally varied between 35 and 40 minutes and nowadays between 40 and 45 minutes. An exception is episode #78 with a length of 52 minutes. Bibi's popularity during this era led to her becoming the official mascot of [[Kiddinx]].

In the series, Bibi, who is fond of playing [[practical joke]]s, experiences numerous adventures with her friends. [[Magic (paranormal)|Magic]] often plays a major part, and often leads to trouble, and Bibi's mother, who is also a witch, must come to set things straight. Bibi's antagonist is often the mayor of Neustadt, who is presented as lazy and incompetent. This leads to conflict with the helpful Bibi.

The surname of Bibi is a reference to the old name of the [[The Brocken|Brocken]], a mountain in Saxony-Anhalt in its native Germany that is traditionally connected with witches (''[[Walpurgis Night]]''), most famously in Goethe's ''[[Faust]]''.

The series was adapted into an animated series in 1995. 11 years later, in 2006, it was given an English dub produced by Ocean Productions and recorded at Blue Water Studios.

==Characters==

===Bibi Blocksberg===
Brigitte&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Hexerei in der Schule |series=Bibi Blocksberg (audio series) |number=2 |time=00:16:52 |quote="Wie heißt du überhaupt?" "Brigitte Blocksberg. Aber alle sagen sie Bibi zu mir." |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Bibi" Blocksberg is a 13-year-old witch girl who has blonde hair tied to a [[pony tail]] with a red bow and wears a green dress (green is her favourite colour) and white socks. Bibi likes to use her magical powers to play practical jokes. Not only the mayor, but also the school principal, the teachers and many other people of Neustadt fall victim to her jokes. Her favourite mode of transport is her [[broomstick]] ''Kartoffelbrei'' (''mashed potato'' or ''apple pie'' in the English dub) which she can make fly by chanting spell rhymes, such as ''Eene meene Mei, Kartoffelbrei mein Flugzeug sei'', "Eene meene Mei, flieg los Kartoffelbrei" or ''Eeene meene Schmieg, Kartoffelbrei los, flieg''. Often, the [[journalist]] Karla Kolumna reports her jokes and adventures. Apart from her tendency to make jokes, Bibi has a big heart. She rescues the townspeople in many episodes, tries to help her friends and is opposed to injustice in the world.

===Bibi's family===
Bernhard and Barbara Blocksberg are Bibi's parents. Barbara is also a witch, and flies to the [[Walburgisnacht]] every year on her broomstick ''Baldrian'' (''Baldrian'', "Valerian" in English, is a common sleeping draught). In the first episodes, her eccentric cooking is a source of annoyance for her family. Barbara insists on cooking witches' food with ingredients such as spiders and frogs, even though no member of her family likes it. Once, she admits that she doesn't even like the food herself, but merely tries to uphold old witch traditions. When Barbara is tired of her family, she flies to visit her friend Amanda. She has a witch's laboratory, in which she often makes foul-smelling magical potions and experiments with various herbs. She feels responsible for upholding a "normal" life in her household and has thus set many rules in the Blocksberg house (for example no flying in through the window, no flying to school on the broomstick, use magic only in an emergency), but these rules are often broken. She frequently reminds her daughter of the witches' honour code, which for example forbids conjuring up [[money]]. Like many other adult witches, Barbara is a member of the ''Hexenrat'' (witches' council).

Bernhard Blocksberg has no magic powers, as these are exclusive to women. He would like to have a normal family, which he mentions in nearly every episode. He often forbids Barbara and Bibi to use magic, but they never listen to him. However, he is proud of "his" witches. He has a habit of reading the town newspaper every morning. Although Bernhard and Barbara often have arguments, which sometimes escalate to [[divorce]] threats, they love each other and in some later episodes go on romantic cruises, for example to [[Venice]].

The first seven episodes also feature Bibi's little brother Boris. He is often very jealous of Bibi's magical powers, which leads to many arguments between them. According to episode #1, he is eight years old. In episode #9, he moves to his grandparents' house at the North Sea. The reason that is given is that he has a cough and needs fresh sea air. He is never mentioned again and doesn't return to his parents and sister, not even on important occasions, such as when the Blocksbergs are moving into a new house.

===Monika===
Moni (Monika) is Bibi's best friend. She first appears in episode #10 ''Bibis neue Freundin'' (''Bibi's new friend''), when she comes to Bibi's class. Originally, she was unpopular. She often was unfriendly to her classmates. Because of her old-fashioned clothes and the fact that she used to live in a small village, she was called a ''Landpomeranze'' (derogatory term used for a girl from the countryside). Only when Bibi found out that Moni has trouble with her very strict parents, she decided to help her, and they have been good friends since.

===Marita===
Marita is Bibi's best friend in later episodes. Bibi meets her in episode #19. Marita is a lot more self-confident than Bibi's other friend, Moni. Even though they sometimes have arguments, Bibi and Marita remain close friends. Marita appears often in later episodes and has many exciting adventures with Bibi.

===Florian===
Florian is one of Bibi's best friends and a [[computer]] guru. In later episodes, he also became a fan of [[Sherlock Holmes]]. He has helped Bibi raise a [[dinosaur]] and was present during many other adventures, which would often involve him looking up things on his computer. Bibi and the others often call him "Flori". It is sometimes implied that Bibi's friend Moni might have a crush on Florian.

===The Mayor===
The Mayor's name is Bruno Pressak (''Pressack'' is a type of German sausage, as well as a derogatory term for a corpulent person), but he is nearly always referred to as "The Mayor". He often makes many good promises, but his motive is always only money. He refers to Bibi as "Bibi Blocksbergi". This is due to the fact that in episode #3 ''Die Zauberlimonade'' (''The magic lemonade''), Bibi made him drink magic lemonade that forced him to add an "i" to every word he said. He has kept the habit ever since whenever he meets Bibi. He is dominant and rude to his secretary Pichler. He loves food and is portrayed as overweight. He is sometimes presented as [[megalomania|megalomanic]]. In episode #64 ''Die neue Schule'' (''The new school''), for instance, he orders a new city hall to be built in the shape of a [[castle]], and in episode #63 ''Die Wahrsagerin'' (''The fortune-teller''), he visits a fortune-teller, who tells him he is going to be King of Neustadt, which causes him to order a regal robe and sceptre. He often appears a bit stupid and gullible, and his character is defined by a lust for profit and a habit of emphasising his own importance. However, he is never cruel. He has a good heart hidden deep inside of him.

===Karla Kolumna===
Karla is a reporter, who is always looking for a big story. She is good friends with the Blocksberg family and often helps them. She often rides a [[motorcycle]] on her job. Her notable attributes are her high-pitched, shrill voice and loud laugh, her habit of talking very quickly and her catchphrase ''Sensationell!''. She sometimes refers to the Mayor as her "dearest (or favourite) enemy". She enjoys presenting him as greedy. Karla also appears in the radio drama series ''[[Benjamin Blümchen]]'' and the Bibi Blocksberg spin-off, Bibi und Tina. She is known as "Carla Caramba" in the English dub.

===Flauipaui===
Flauipaui is a young witch who is friends with Bibi and Schubia. She is obsessed with her appearance, often combing her long hair and looking at herself in the mirror. She is very easily scared. She is afraid of her magic teacher Tante Mania, because she never understands her homework. However, she can be very brave in dangerous situations. She goes to magic school with Schubia Wanzhaar and Bibi Blocksberg. Her broomstick is called ''Gänseblümchen'' (''Daisy'').

===Schubia===
Schubia Wanzhaar is a young punk witch. She attends magic school with Bibi and Flauipaui. She has green hair and a motor broomstick called ''Kawakasi'' (probably a pun on the motorcycle manufacturer [[Kawasaki motorcycles|Kawasaki]]). She often has problems with her magic teacher Tante Mania because she's inattentive. She is overconfident, but is good friends with Bibi and Flaupaui, whom she often teases. She appears tough, but has a soft heart. She wears [[punk fashion|punk]] clothes and always wears deep red [[lipstick]].

===Amanda===
Even though Bibi refers to her as "Tante" (aunt), Amanda is not actually related to the Blocksbergs. She is a friend of Barbara's, who doesn't only have magical powers as well, but also shares her passion for witchcraft. In episode #77, it is revealed that she is the chairwoman of the witches' council's progressive wing.

===Mania===
Mania is the oldest witch in and a foundation member of the witches' council. In early episodes, she is portrayed as the typical evil witch of fairy tales, with a strong dislike for other people. In episode #35, she even conjures up eternal winter, only to spite her fellow witches. In later episodes, she is shown as friendlier, but still very strict and set in her own ways. She becomes the teacher of the young witches Bibi, Flauipaui and Schubia. She doesn't care much for Flauipaui and Schubia, but she likes Bibi's kindness and her good heart, as well as her talent in witchcraft. Mania owns several cats, owls and a black raven named Abraxas (which is also the name of ''The Little Witch''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s raven &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Otfried Preußler]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;), whom she uses to send messages, as well as to keep her company.

===Walpurgia===
Walpurgia is the head of the witches' council. She is very strict and insists on rules to be followed. In addition to her position in the witches' council, she runs a boarding school for young witches, to which Bibi, Flauipaui and Schubia are sent temporarily in episode #77.

===The Thunderstorms===
Cecily Thunderstorm is Bibi's aunt from [[Ireland]] and also a witch. She first appears in episode #8, and afterwards in episodes #36 and #82. She is married to Patrick Thunderstorm, who, like Bernard Blocksberg, has no magic powers. Patrick owns a flying car, which has been enchanted by his wife. Their daughter Margie first had problems with Bibi, but when Bibi learned of the castle's financial problems, she helped Margie and they became friends. The two girls have stayed in touch since. Despite the fact that the Thuderstorms are Irish, they always speak German, even among themselves. Only occasionally do they use English terms or phrases, such as "darling" or "Oh yeah!".

There is also an [[animated series]] with 52 episodes, but only the first 26 have been dubbed in English. There is also an animated film ''Geht's auch ohne Hexerei?''.

There are also two spin-offs: ''[[Elea Eluanda]]'', appearing as a guest in episode #78 of the radio show, and ''[[Bibi &amp; Tina]]'', in which Bibi has adventures on a riding farm with her new friend, Tina.

Four films about Bibi and Tina:

The official mobile game "Bibi's Stardust Chase" was released in 2013.

*Barbara: ''Well, if you've fucked up&lt;ref&gt;lit.: built shit&lt;/ref&gt; you have to admit it [and try to iron it out].''&lt;br&gt;Bernhard: ''Barbara! And afterwards you're surprised when our children use expressions like that!''&lt;br&gt;Barbara: ''No, I'm not surprised at all. They've got them from me.''&lt;br&gt;Bernhard: ''Oh dear! That witch drives me crazy.'' (Episode 3: The Magic Lemonade)

==Theme song==
Originally, the series had an instrumental theme. Later it was exchanged by a vocal theme song, arranged by [[Heiko Rüsse]]. Since episode #83, there has been a new theme song, arranged by [[Wolfgang W. Loos]] and Heiko Rüsse.

The proprietors have published both the old song [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtkbcn3LCf0] and the new song [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39OpiNB6TCg] on [[YouTube]].

==Criticism==
Bibi Blocksberg is generally considered a good, entertaining and educational children's series.

It has however received criticism from the scientist [[Gerd Strohmeier]]. The cause of the criticism is the character of the incompetent and corrupt mayor of Neustadt, which Strohmeier claims will give a negative view of politics to children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bpb.de/publikationen/2RQI2Y,2,0,Politik_bei_Benjamin_Bl%C3%BCmchen_und_Bibi_Blocksberg.html Politik bei Benjamin Blümchen und Bibi Blocksberg - Aus Politik und Zeitgeschichte (APuZ 41/2005)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Fallon graduated ''cum laude'' from [[Harvard University|Harvard]],&lt;ref name="NYT-120101"/&gt; where he covered sports for ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thecrimson.com/writer/1233/Brian_E._Fallon/ |title=Brian E. Fallon - Writer Profile |website=The Harvard Crimson |accessdate=November 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]], Fallon worked on the [[John Kerry presidential campaign, 2004|Kerry-Edwards presidential campaign]] as a press aide.&lt;ref name="EvansExpected"&gt;{{cite news |first=Megan |last=Evans |url=http://www.rollcall.com/news/home/brian-fallon-hillary-clinton |title=Former Schumer Aide Expected to Join Clinton Camp |work=[[Roll Call]] |date=March 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[United States Senate election in New Jersey, 2006|2006 Senate election in New Jersey]], Fallon served as campaign press secretary to Senator [[Robert Menendez]]. Fallon then became chief spokesman for Senator [[Charles Schumer]] of [[New York (state)|New York]], and in 2011 additionally became spokesman for the new Senate Democratic Policy and Communications Center.&lt;ref name="EvansExpected"/&gt; In 2013, Fallon left Schumer's office and moved to the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]], with [[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]] [[Eric Holder]] hiring him as the department's director of public affairs.&lt;ref name="EvansExpected"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gearan&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/03/17/clinton-team-picks-justice-spokesman-brian-fallon-as-lead-press-secretary/ | title=Clinton team picks Justice spokesman Brian Fallon as lead press secretary | work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=March 17, 2015 | accessdate=September 15, 2016 |last1=Gearan |first1=Anne  |last2=Rucker |first2=Philip}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
{{see also|Bulgars}}
Bulgarians derive their ethnonym from the ''[[Bulgars]]''. Their name is not completely understood and difficult to trace back earlier than the 4th century AD,&lt;ref name="Gurov"&gt;{{cite web |first=Dilian|last=Gurov |date=March 2007 |title=The Origins of the Bulgars |url=https://www.nada.kth.se/~dilian/bulgars.pdf |pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is possibly derived from the [[Proto-Turkic]] word ''bulģha'' ("to mix", "shake", "stir") and its derivative ''bulgak'' ("revolt", "disorder").&lt;ref&gt;Bowersock, Glen W. &amp; al. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=c788wWR_bLwC&amp;pg=PA354 Late Antiquity: a Guide to the Postclassical World]'', p. 354. Harvard University Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-674-51173-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternate etymologies include derivation from a compound of Proto-Turkic ''bel'' ("five") and ''gur'' ("arrow" in the sense of "[[Turkic tribal confederations|tribe]]"), a proposed division within the [[Utigurs]] or [[Onogurs]] ("ten tribes").&lt;ref&gt;Karataty, Osman. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=h_Qu1ywX0-wC In Search of the Lost Tribe: the Origins and Making of the Croatian Nation]'', p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Early Slavs emerged from their original homeland in the early 6th century, and spread to most of the eastern [[Central Europe]], [[Eastern Europe]] and the [[Balkans]], thus forming three main branches: the [[West Slavs]] in eastern Central Europe, the [[East Slavs]] in Eastern Europe, and the [[South Slavs]] in [[Southeast Europe|Southeastern Europe]] (Balkans).

Some Bulgarians supported the Russian Army when they crossed the Danube in the middle of the 18th century. Russia worked to convince them to settle in areas recently conquered by it, especially in [[Bessarabia]]. As a consequence, many Bulgarian colonists settled there, and later they formed two military regiments, as part of the Russian military colonization of the area in 1759–1763.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Vladimir |last1=Milchev |title=Два хусарски полка с българско участие в системата на държавната военна колонизация в Южна Украйна (1759-1762/63 г.) |trans-title=Two Hussar Regiments with Bulgarian Participation in the System of the State Military Colonization in Southern Ukraine (1759-1762/63) |language=Bulgarian |journal=Исторически преглед |year=2002 |volume= |issue=5–6 |pages=154–65 |url=https://www.ceeol.com/search/article-detail?id=113707 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bulgarian national movement===

During the [[Russo-Turkish War (1806–1812)|Russo-Turkish Wars (1806–1812)]] and [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829)|(1828–1829)]] Bulgarian emigrants formed the Bulgarian Countrymen's Army and joined the [[Imperial Russian Army|Russian army]], hoping Russia would bring Bulgarian liberation, but its imperial interests were focused then on [[Greece]] and [[Wallachia|Valachia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=LBYriPYyfUoC&amp;pg=PA137 |title=Establishment of the Balkan National States: 1804–1918, |first1=Charles |last1=Jelavich |first2=Barbara |last2=Jelavich |publisher=University of Washington Press |year=1977 |page=128 |accessdate=2015-02-11|isbn=9780295803609 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire]] led to a struggle for cultural and religious autonomy of the Bulgarian people. The Bulgarians wanted to have their own schools and liturgy in Bulgarian, and they needed an independent ecclesiastical organisation. Discontent with the supremacy of the Greek Orthodox clergy, the struggle started to flare up in several Bulgarian dioceses in the 1820s.

It was not until the 1850s when the Bulgarians initiated a purposeful struggle against the [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]]. The struggle between the Bulgarians and the Greek [[Phanariotes]] intensified throughout the 1860s. In 1861 the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and the Ottoman government recognized a separate [[Bulgarian Uniat Church]]. As the Greek clerics were ousted from most Bulgarian bishoprics at the end of the decade, significant areas had been seceded from the Patriarchate's control. This movement restored the distinct Bulgarian national consciousness among the common people and led to the recognition of the [[Bulgarian Millet]] in 1870 by the Ottomans. As result, two armed struggle movements started to develop as late as the beginning of the 1870s: the [[Internal Revolutionary Organisation]] and the [[Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee]]. Their armed struggle reached its peak with the [[April Uprising]] which broke out in 1876. It resulted in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)|Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)]], and led to the [[Liberation of Bulgaria|foundation of the third Bulgarian state]] after the [[Treaty of San Stefano]]. The issue of [[Bulgarian nationalism]] gained greater significance, following the [[Congress of Berlin]] which took back the regions of Macedonia and [[Edirne|Adrianople]] area, returning them under the control of the Ottoman Empire. Also an autonomous Ottoman province, called [[Eastern Rumelia]] was created in northern Thrace. As a consequence, the Bulgarian national movement proclaimed as its aim the inclusion of most of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], [[Thrace]] and [[Moesia]] under Greater Bulgaria.

Eastern Rumelia was annexed to Bulgaria in 1885 through bloodless revolution. During the early 1890s, two pro-Bulgarian revolutionary organizations were founded: the [[Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization]] and the [[Supreme Macedonian-Adrianople Committee]]. In 1903 they participated in the unsuccessful [[Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising]] against the Ottomans in Macedonia and the Adrianople [[vilayet]]. [[Macedonian Slavs]] were identified then predominantly as Bulgarians, and significant Bulgarophile sentiments endured up among them until the end of the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;During the 20th century, Slavo-Macedonian national feeling has shifted. At the beginning of the 20th century, Slavic patriots in Macedonia felt a strong attachment to Macedonia as a multi-ethnic homeland. They imagined a Macedonian community uniting themselves with non-Slavic Macedonians... Most of these Macedonian Slavs also saw themselves as Bulgarians. By the middle of the 20th. century, however Macedonian patriots began to see Macedonian and Bulgarian loyalties as mutually exclusive. Regional Macedonian nationalism had become ethnic Macedonian nationalism... This transformation shows that the content of collective loyalties can shift.{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6RveDmHbIv8C&amp;pg=PA147 |title=Region, Regional Identity and Regionalism in Southeastern Europe, Ethnologia Balkanica Series |first1=Klaus |last1=Roth |first2=Ulf |last2=Brunnbauer |publisher=LIT Verlag Münster |year=2010 |isbn=3825813878 |page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Up until the early 20th century and beyond, the international community viewed Macedonians as regional variety of Bulgarians, i.e. Western Bulgarians.[https://books.google.com/books?id=-7TgkO8utHIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Nationalism+and+Territory:+Constructing+Group+Identity+in+Southeastern+Europe,+Geographical+perspectives+on+the+human+past+:+Europe:+Current+Events,+George+W.+White,+Rowman+%26+Littlefield,+2000,&amp;hl=en ''Nationalism and Territory: Constructing Group Identity in Southeastern Europe, Geographical perspectives on the human past : Europe: Current Events''], George W.

The question as of whether a Macedonian nation actually existed in the 1940s when a Communist Yugoslavia decided to recognize one is difficult to answer. Some observers argue that even at this time it was doubtful whether the Slavs from Macedonia considered themselves to be a nationality separate from the Bulgarians.{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZmesOn_HhfEC&amp;pg=PA66 |title=The Macedonian conflict: ethnic nationalism in a transnational world |first=Loring M. |last=Danforth |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1997 |isbn=0-691-04356-6 |pages=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kaufman |first1=Stuart J. |title=Modern hatreds: the symbolic politics of ethnic war |year=2001 |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-8014-8736-6 |page=193 |quote=The key fact about Macedonian nationalism is that it is new: in the early twentieth century, Macedonian villagers defined their identity religiously—they were either "Bulgarian," "Serbian," or "Greek" depending on the affiliation of the village priest.

In the early 20th century the control over Macedonia became a key point of contention between Bulgaria, Greece, and [[Serbia]], who fought the First Balkan War of [[First Balkan War|(1912–1913)]] and the Second Balkan War of [[Second Balkan War|(1913)]]. The area was further fought over during the World War I [[Bulgaria during World War I|(1915–1918)]] and the World War II [[Military history of Bulgaria during World War II|(1941–1944)]].

==Demographics==
{{Main|Demographics of Bulgaria}}
Most Bulgarians live in [[Bulgaria]], where they number around 6 million,&lt;ref name=experts /&gt;&lt;ref name=2001census /&gt; constituting 85% of the population. There are significant Bulgarian minorities in [[Bulgarians in Serbia|Serbia]], [[Bulgarians in Turkey|Turkey]], [[Bulgarians in Albania|Albania]], [[Bulgarians in Romania|Romania]] ([[Banat Bulgarians]]), as well as in [[Bulgarians in Ukraine|Ukraine]] and [[Bulgarians in Moldova|Moldova]] (see [[Bessarabian Bulgarians]]). Many Bulgarians also live in the diaspora, which is formed by representatives and descendants of the old (before 1989) and new (after 1989) emigration. The old emigration was made up of some 2,470,000 {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} economic and several tens of thousands of political emigrants, and was directed for the most part to the U.S., Canada, Argentina, Brazil and Germany. The new emigration is estimated at some 970,000 people and can be divided into two major subcategories: permanent emigration at the beginning of the 1990s, directed mostly to the [[Bulgarian American|U.S.]], [[Bulgarian Canadian|Canada]], Austria, and [[Bulgarians in Germany|Germany]] and labour emigration at the end of the 1990s, directed for the most part to [[Greece]], Italy, the UK and Spain. Migrations to the West have been quite steady even in the late 1990s and early 21st century, as people continue moving to countries like the US, Canada and Australia. Most Bulgarians living in Canada can be found in Toronto, Ontario, and the provinces with the most Bulgarians in Canada are [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]]. According to the 2001 census there were 1,124,240 Bulgarian citizens in the city of [[Sofia]],&lt;ref name=2001census/&gt; 302,858 in [[Plovdiv]], 300,000 in [[Varna]] and about 200,000 in [[Burgas]]. The total number of Bulgarians stood at over 9 million.&lt;ref name="dnevnik.bg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="maritsa.com"/&gt;

==Culture==
The Bulgarian culture has largely the product of influence of incoming cultures and is now going through westernization, especially the cuisine.

===Language===
{{Main|Bulgarian language}}
Bulgarians speak a [[Bulgarian language|Southern Slavic language]] which is [[mutually intelligible]] with [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] and to a lesser degree with [[Serbo-Croatian]], especially the western dialects.&lt;ref&gt;Стойков, Стойко: Българска диалектология, Акад. изд.

Bulgarian demonstrates some linguistic developments that set it apart from other Slavic languages shared with [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] (see [[Balkan language area]]). Bulgarian was influenced lexically by medieval and modern [[Greek language|Greek]], and [[Ottoman Turkish language|Turkish]]. [[Old Bulgarian language|Medieval Bulgarian]] influenced the other South Slavic and Romanian. With Bulgarian and Russian there was a mutual influence in both directions. The language of each other was official or lingua franca of each other in the Middle Ages and the Cold War. Recently, Bulgarian has borrowed many words from German, French and English.

The Bulgarian language is spoken by the majority of the [[Bulgarian diaspora]], but less so by the descendants of earlier emigrants to the U.S., Canada, [[Argentina]] and [[Brazil]].

Bulgarian linguists consider the officialized [[Macedonian language]] (since 1944) a local variation of Bulgarian, just as most ethnographers and linguists until the early 20th century considered the local Slavic speech in the Macedonian region. The president of Bulgaria [[Zhelyu Zhelev]], declined to recognize Macedonian as a separate language when the Republic of Macedonia became a new independent state. The Bulgarian language is written in the [[Cyrillic script]].

====Cyrillic alphabet====
{{Main|Cyrillic alphabet}}
[[File:Ocslavonic.gif|thumb|right|Cyrillic alphabet of the medieval [[Old Bulgarian]] language]]

In the first half of the 10th century, the [[Cyrillic script]] was devised in the [[Preslav Literary School]], [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], based on the [[Glagolitic alphabet|Glagolitic]], the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] and [[Latin alphabet]]s. Modern versions of the alphabet are now used to write five more [[Slavic languages]] such as [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], Russian, [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] as well as [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] and some other 60 languages spoken in the former [[Soviet Union]]. [[First Bulgarian Empire|Medieval Bulgaria]] was the most important cultural centre of the [[Slavic people]]s at the end of the 9th and throughout the 10th century. The two literary schools of [[Preslav Literary School|Preslav]] and [[Ohrid Literary School|Ohrid]] developed a rich literary and cultural activity with authors of the rank of [[Constantine of Preslav]], [[John Exarch]], [[Chernorizets Hrabar]], [[Clement of Ohrid|Clement]] and [[Naum of Ohrid]]. Bulgaria exerted similar influence on her neighbouring countries in the mid- to late 14th century, at the time of the [[Tarnovo Literary School]], with the work of [[Patriarch Evtimiy]], [[Gregory Tsamblak]], [[Constantine of Kostenets]] (Konstantin Kostenechki). Bulgarian cultural influence was especially strong in [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldova]] where the [[Cyrillic script]] was used until 1860, while [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]] was the official language of the princely [[chancellor|chancellery]] and of the church until the end of the 17th century.

====Name system====
{{Main|Bulgarian name}}

There are several different layers of Bulgarian names. The vast majority of them have either Christian (names like Lazar, [[Ivan (name)|Ivan]], Anna, Maria, Ekaterina) or [[Slavs|Slavic]] origin (Vladimir, Svetoslav, Velislava). After the Liberation in 1878, the names of historical [[Bulgars|Bulgar]] rulers like [[Asparuh]], [[Krum]], [[Kubrat]] and [[Tervel]] were resurrected. The old Bulgar name [[Boris (first name)|Boris]] has spread from Bulgaria to a number of countries in the world.

Most Bulgarian male surnames have an ''-ov'' [[family name affix|surname suffix]] ([[Cyrillic]]: ''-ов''), a tradition used mostly by Eastern Slavic nations such as [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]]. This is sometimes [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcribed]] as ''-off'' or ''-of'' (John Atanasov—[[John Atanasoff]]), but more often as ''-ov'' (e.g. [[Boyko Borisov]]). The ''-ov'' suffix is the Slavic gender-[[agreement (linguistics)|agreeing]] suffix, thus ''Ivanov'' ({{lang-bg|Иванов}}) literally means "Ivan's". Bulgarian middle names are patronymic and use the gender-[[agreement (linguistics)|agreeing]] suffix as well, thus the middle name of Nikola's son becomes ''Nikolov'', and the middle name of Ivan's son becomes ''Ivanov''. Since names in Bulgarian are gender-based, Bulgarian women have the ''-ova'' [[family name affix|surname suffix]] (Cyrillic: ''-овa''), for example, ''Maria Ivanova''. The plural form of Bulgarian names ends in ''-ovi'' (Cyrillic: ''-ови''), for example the ''Ivanovi'' family ({{lang|bg|Иванови}}).

&lt;!-- too verbose... --&gt;Other common Bulgarian male surnames have the ''-ev'' [[family name affix|surname suffix]] (Cyrillic: ''-ев''), for example ''Stoev'', ''Ganchev'', ''Peev'', and so on. The female surname in this case would have the ''-eva'' [[family name affix|surname suffix]] (Cyrillic: ''-ева''), for example: ''Galina Stoeva''. The last name of the entire family then would have the plural form of ''-evi'' (Cyrillic: ''-еви''), for example: the ''Stoevi'' family ({{lang|bg|Стоеви}}).

Another typical Bulgarian surname suffix, though less common, is ''-ski''. This surname ending also gets an ''–a'' when the bearer of the name is female (''Smirnenski'' becomes ''Smirnenska''). The plural form of the surname suffix ''-ski'' is still ''-ski'', e.g. the ''Smirnenski'' family ({{lang-bg|Смирненски}}).

The ending ''–in'' (female ''-ina'') also appears rarely. It used to be given to the child of an unmarried woman (for example the son of ''Kuna'' will get the surname ''Kunin'' and the son of ''Gana'' – ''Ganin''). The surname suffix ''-ich'' can be found only occasionally, primarily among the [[Roman Catholicism in Bulgaria|Roman Catholic Bulgarians]]. The surname ending ''–ich'' does not get an additional ''–a'' if the bearer of the name is female.

Most Bulgarians are at least nominally members of the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]] founded in 870 AD ([[autocephalous]] since 927 AD). The [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]] is the independent national church of Bulgaria like the other national branches of the [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox communion]] and is considered a dominating element of Bulgarian national consciousness. The church was abolished once, during the period of Ottoman rule (1396—1878), in 1873 it was revived as [[Bulgarian Exarchate]] and soon after raised again to Bulgarian [[Patriarchate]]. In 2011, the Orthodox Church at least nominally had a total of 4,374,000 members in Bulgaria (59% of the population), down from 6,552,000 (83%) at the 2001 census. 4,240,000 of these pointed out the Bulgarian ethnic group. The Orthodox Bulgarian minorities in the [[Republic of Macedonia]], Serbia, [[Greece]], Albania, [[Ukraine]] and [[Moldova]] nowadays hold allegiance to the respective national Orthodox churches.

Despite the position of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church as a unifying symbol for all Bulgarians, small groups of Bulgarians have converted to other faiths through the course of time. During Ottoman rule, a substantial number of Bulgarians converted to Islam, forming the community of the [[Pomaks]] or [[Muslim Bulgarians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecmi.de/fileadmin/downloads/publications/JEMIE/2007/2-2007-Eminov.pdf |title=Social Construction of Identities: Pomaks in Bulgaria, Ali Eminov, JEMIE 6 (2007) 2 © 2007 by European Centre for Minority Issues |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2015-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 16th and the 17th centuries Roman Catholic missionaries converted a small number of Bulgarian [[Paulicians]] in the districts of [[Plovdiv]] and [[Svishtov]] to [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]]. Nowadays there are some 40,000 Roman Catholic Bulgarians in Bulgaria, additional 10,000 in the [[Banat]] in Romania and up to 100,000 people of Bulgarian ancenstry in South America. The Roman Catholic Bulgarians of the Banat are also descendants of [[Paulicians]] who fled there at the end of the 17th century after an unsuccessful uprising against the Ottomans. Protestantism was introduced in Bulgaria by missionaries from the United States in 1857. Missionary work continued throughout the second half of the 19th and the first half of the 20th century. Nowadays there are some 25,000 Protestant Bulgarians in Bulgaria.

[[Boris Christoff]], [[Nicolai Ghiaurov]], [[Raina Kabaivanska]] and [[Ghena Dimitrova]] made a precious contribution to opera singing with Ghiaurov and Christoff being two of the greatest [[Bass (voice type)|bassos]] in the post-war period. The name of the harpist-[[Anna-Maria Ravnopolska-Dean]] is one of the best-known harpists today.
Bulgarians have made valuable contributions to world culture in modern times as well. [[Julia Kristeva]] and [[Tzvetan Todorov]] were among the most influential European philosophers in the second half of the 20th century. The artist [[Christo]] is among the most famous representatives of [[environmental art]] with projects such as the [[Wrapped Reichstag]].

Bulgarians in the diaspora have also been active. American scientists and inventors of Bulgarian descent include [[John Atanasoff]], [[Peter Petroff]], and [[Assen Jordanoff]]. Bulgarian-American [[Stephane Groueff]] wrote the celebrated book "[[Manhattan Project]]", about the making of the first atomic bomb and also penned "Crown of Thorns", a biography of [[Tsar]] [[Boris III of Bulgaria]].

===Cuisine===
{{main|Bulgarian cuisine}}
[[File:Peach_kompot.JPG|right|thumb|Bulgarian Peach [[Kompot]] - non alcoholic clear juice obtained by cooking fruit]]

Famous for its rich salads required at every meal, Bulgarian cuisine is also noted for the diversity and quality of [[dairy product]]s and the variety of [[Bulgarian wine|local wines]] and alcoholic beverages such as [[rakia]], [[mastika]] and [[menta]]. Bulgarian cuisine features also a variety of hot and cold soups, an example of a cold soup being [[tarator]]. There are many different Bulgarian pastries as well such as [[banitsa]].

Most Bulgarian dishes are oven baked, steamed, or in the form of stew. Deep-frying is not very typical, but grilling—especially different kinds of meats—is very common. Pork meat is the most common meat in the Bulgarian cuisine. Oriental dishes do exist in Bulgarian cuisine with most common being [[moussaka]], gyuvetch, and [[baklava]]. A very popular ingredient in Bulgarian cuisine is the Bulgarian white brine cheese called "[[sirene]]" (сирене). It is the main ingredient in many salads, as well as in a variety of pastries. Fish and chicken are widely eaten and while beef is less common as most cattle are bred for milk production rather than meat, [[veal]] is a natural byproduct of this process and it is found in many popular recipes. Bulgaria is a net exporter of lamb and its own consumption of the meat is prevalent during its production time in spring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepoultrysite.com/articles/572/bulgaria-poultry-and-products-meat-market-update |title=Bulgaria Poultry and Products Meat Market Update |publisher=The Poultry Site |date=2006-05-08 |accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Bread and salt]] tradition in context of welcoming, which is spread in Balto-Slavs, is the usual welcoming of strangers and politicians.

===Folk beliefs and customs===
{{main|Bulgarian customs|Slavic mythology}}
[[File:Кукери.jpg|thumb|[[Kukeri]] from the area of [[Burgas]]]]
[[File:Lazarki from Gabra.jpg|thumb|Girls celebrating [[Lazarice|Lazaruvane]] from Gabrа, [[Sofia Province]]]]
Bulgarians may celebrate [[Saint Theodore's Day]] with horse racings. At Christmas Eve a [[Pogača]] with fortunes is cooked, which are afterwards put under the pillow. At [[Easter]] the first egg is painted red and is kept for a whole year. On the [[Baptism of Jesus]] a competition to catch the cross in the river is held and is believed the sky is "opened" and any wish will be fulfilled.

Bulgarians as [[Albanians]] nod the head up and down to indicates "no" and shake to indicate "yes". They may wear the [[martenitsa]] (мартеница)—an adornment made of white and red yarn and worn on the wrist or pinned on the clothes—from 1 March until the end of the month. Alternatively, one can take off the martenitsa earlier if one sees a stork (considered a harbinger of spring). One can then tie the martenitsa to the blossoming branch of a tree. Family-members and friends in Bulgaria customarily exchange martenitsas, which they regard as symbols of health and longevity. When a stork is seen, the martenitsa should be left on a tree. The white thread represents peace and tranquility, while the red one stands for the cycles of life. Bulgarians may also refer to the holiday of 1 March as [[Baba Marta]] (Баба Марта), meaning ''Grandmother March''. It preserves an ancient pagan tradition, possibly celebrating the [[Martius (month)|old Roman new Year]], beginning on 1 March, identical with Romanian [[Mărțișor]]. Pagan customs found their way to the Christian holidays. The ancient ritual of [[kukeri]] (кукери), similar to Slovenian [[Kurentovanje]], [[Busójárás]] and [[Halloween]], is performed by costumed men in different times of the year and after Easter. This seeks to scare away evil spirits and bring good harvest and health to the community. Goat is symbolized, that was left from the Thracian cult of [[Dionysian Mysteries]]. The ritual consists of dancing, jumping, shouting and collect gifts from the houses in an attempt to banish all evil from the village. The adornments on the costumes vary from one region to another. The [[Thracian Heros]] remains in the image of [[Saint George]], at whose feast the agriculture is celebrated, a lamb is traditionally eaten, accomplished with ritual bathing. [[Tryphon, Respicius, and Nympha|Saint Tryphon]]'s fertility and wine is attributed a Thracian origin, considered to preserve the cult to [[Sabazius]] as the [[Kukeri]].&lt;ref&gt;Колева Т. А. Болгары // Календарные обычаи и обряды в странах зарубежной Европы. Конец XIX — начало XX в. Весенние праздники. — М.: Наука, 1977. — С. 274–295. — 360 с.&lt;/ref&gt; This is followed in February by Pokladi, a tradition of setting massively large fire and jump over as at the [[Kupala Night]] and a competition between couples to eat an egg on a thread is held. Another characteristic custom called [[nestinarstvo]] (нестинарство), or ''firedancing'', distinguishes the [[Strandzha]] region, as well as [[Dog spinning]]. The authentic nestinarstvo with states of [[trance]] is only preserved in the village [[Balgari]]. This ancient custom involves dancing into fire or over live embers. Women dance into the fire with their bare feet without suffering any injury or pain.
 
[[Early Slavs|Slavic]] pagan customs are preserved in Bulgarian Christian holidays. The [[Miladinov brothers]] and foreign authors noticed that even pagan prayers are preserved quoting plenty of Slavic pagan rite songs and tales remained in Bulgarians, including [[Macedonians (Bulgarians)|Macedonians]] and [[Pomaks]], mainly dedicated to the divine nymphs [[Samodiva (mythology)|samovili]] and [[peperuna]] for the feasts [[survakane|surva]], [[Saint George's Day]], [[Koleda]], etc. with evidence of toponymy throughout the regional groups linking directly to the deities [[Svarog]], [[Perun]], [[Hors]] and [[Veles (god)|Veles]], while the regional group Hartsoi derive their name from god [[Hors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tangrabg.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/veda_slovena.pdf |format=PDF |title=?? |website=Tangrabg.files.wordpress.com |accessdate=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bkks.org/files/bnpesni.pdf |format=PDF |title=?? |website=Bkks.org |accessdate=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Анчо Калоянов. СТАРОБЪЛГАРСКОТО ЕЗИЧЕСТВО. LiterNet, 06. 11. 2002. {{ISBN|954-304-009-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Songs dedicated to the Thracian divinity [[Orpheus]] were found in Pomaks, who is said to marry the samovili. The old Bulgarian name of the [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple]] was ''Gromnitsa'' and ''Perunov den'' dedicated to the supreme Slavic thunder god [[Perun]]. In the mix of Christian and pagan patrons of thunder, at [[Saint Elijah]]'s feast day [[Ognyena Maria]] is worshiped, the Slavic goddesses assisting Perun that took a substitutional dual position of the Christian Mother of God. The custom for rain begging [[Peperuna]] is derived from the wife of Perun and the god of the rain [[Dodola]], this was described by a 1792 Bulgarian book as a continued worship of Perun at times of absence of rain with a ritual performed by a boy or a girl dressed like Perun.&lt;ref&gt;История во кратце о болгарском народе словенском&lt;/ref&gt; Similar rain begging is called [[German (mythology)|German]]. In case of continuous lack of rain, a custom of driving out the [[zmey]] from the area is performed. In the dualistic Slavic belief the zmey may be both good [[tutelary spirit]] and evil, in which case is considered not local and good, but evil and trying to inflict harm and drought.&lt;ref name=ivanichka/&gt; Saint [[Jeremiah]]'s feast is of the snakes and the reptiles, there is a tradition of jumping over fire. At the [[Rusalka|Rusalska]] Week the girls don't go outside to prevent themselves from diseases and harm that the dead forces [[Nav'|Rusalii]] can cause.&lt;ref name=ivanichka/&gt; This remained the holiday of the samovili. The men performing the custom are also called Rusalii, they don't let anybody pass through between them, don't talk with each other except for the evening, avoid water, if someone lacks behind a member swoops the sword over the lacker's head to prevent him from evil spirits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bgnow.eu/news.php?cat=2&amp;cp=0&amp;newsid=27862 |title=Русалии - древните български обичаи по Коледа |website=Bgnow.eu |date= |accessdate=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the group encounter on their way a well, dry tree, old cemeteries, crossroads, they go round them three times. Before leaving rusalii say goodbye to their relatives as if they went to war, which is not surprising because some of them are killed. When two rusalii groups met there was a fight to the death in which the dead were buried in special "rusaliyski cemetery." Each year there are holidays in honour of wolves and mouses. A relief for the scared believers is celebrated at the [[Beheading of St. John the Baptist]], when according to Bulgarian belief all the [[List of Slavic mythological figures|mythical figure]]s go back to their caves in a mythical village in the middle of nowhere Zmeykovo of the [[zmey]] king, along with the [[rusalki]], samodivi, and return at [[Annunciation]].&lt;ref name=ivanichka&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mling.ru/etnolingvistika/bg/muth_bg.pdf |format=PDF |title=?? |website=Mling.ru |accessdate=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to other beliefs the danger peaks at the so-called few days around the New Year Eve "Dirty Days", this time starts at [[Koleda]], which merged with [[Christmas]], when groups of kids [[koledari]] visit houses, singing carols and receiving a gift at parting. It is believed that no man can go in Zmeyovo and only the magpie knows the location of this place. At many of the holidays a sexual taboo is said to be practiced to prevent conceiving a vampire or werewolf and not to work, not to go to [[Vechornytsi|Sedenki]] or go out. [[Need fire|Live fire]] is set in case of epidemics.&lt;ref name=ivanichka/&gt; [[Babinden]] for example is rooted in the mother-goddess. On the day of [[St. Vlas]], the tradition of a "wooly" god [[Veles (god)|Veles]] established itself, a god who is considered to be a protector of shepherds, and bread is given to the livestock on that day.&lt;ref name=ivanichka/&gt; The ancient Slavic custom to marry died people occurred in Bulgarian society.&lt;ref name=ivanichka/&gt; [[Survakane]] is performed each new year with a decorated stick by children, who hit adults on the back for health at the New Year Eve, usually in exchange of money. In the [[Chech]] region there is a custom forbidding "touching the land", i.e. construction and agriculture, at the equinox on 25 March and the same custom is found in Belarusian [[Volhynia]] and [[Polesia]].&lt;ref name=ivanichka/&gt;

Bulgarian mythology and fairy tales are mainly about forest figures, such as the dragon [[zmey]], the nymphs [[Samodiva (mythology)|samovili]] (samodivi), the witch veshtitsa. They are usually harmful and devastating, but can also help the people. The samovili are said to live in beeches and sycamores the, which are therefore considered holy and not permitted burning.&lt;ref name=ivanichka/&gt; Samovili, although believed to be masters of everything between the sky and the earth, "run away" from fraxinus, garlic, dew and walnut.&lt;ref name=ivanichka/&gt; Walnut remained in Christianity to be used in prayers to "see" the dead in Spirits Day.&lt;ref name=ivanichka/&gt; [[Dictamnus]] is believed to be their favourite herb, which is intoxicating. The samovili are spirits in Bulgarian beliefs are the diseases themselves and punish people, kidnap shepherds, make blind the people or drown them and are in white colored dress, they are in odd numbers, which suggest they are ones of the "dead".&lt;ref name=ivanichka/&gt; Epic heroes as [[Prince Marko]] are believed to be descended from the samodivi. The elm is believed to scare the evil forces. Sacral trees in Bulgarian beliefs are beeches and oaks.&lt;ref name=ivanichka/&gt; Hawthorn is believed to expel all evil forces and is applied to cure suspected vampires. The tradition forbids killing of sacred animals - deer, while it is hold a belief the samodivi runaway from horse. The alleged as "unclean" animals resembling the devil such as the goat are, however, exempted from being eaten as the holy ones. The zmey is [[transhuman]] and can turn "into" animals, plants and items, he is also "responsible" for diseases, madness and missing women.&lt;ref name=ivanichka/&gt; The female version of the Slavic zmey is [[Lamia]] and [[Ala (demon)|Ala]] is another version. The girls who practiced [[Lazarice|Lazaruvane]] and other rituals "could not" be kidnapped by the zmey. The main enemy of the Sun is the zmey, which tries to eat the Sun, which scene is preserved in church art.&lt;ref name=ivanichka/&gt; The sun is painted one eyed as recorded by beliefs Perun stabbed one of the sun's eyes to save the world from overheating.&lt;ref name=ivanichka/&gt; The [[Vampire hunter|born on Saturday]] are thought as having supernatural powers, those born at the wolves' holidays and a number of people are alleged as [[werewolf|varkolaks]] and vampires.&lt;ref name=ivanichka/&gt; The most spread Bulgarian view of the vampire was that of a rolling bulbous balloon of blood derived from the Slavic term ''pir'' "drink".&lt;ref name=ivanichka/&gt; [[Rusalka]] is believed to be a variety of the samodivi and [[Nav']], but the latter are considered little fairies.&lt;ref name=ivanichka/&gt; The Thursdays remained feasts of Perun in Bulgarian beliefs.&lt;ref name=ivanichka/&gt; The wind and the hot steam of the bread is believed to be the souls of the dead.&lt;ref name=ivanichka/&gt; From Easter to Feast of the Ascension it is believed that the death are in the flowers and the animals. [[Marzanna|Mora]] in Bulgarian beliefs is a black hairy evil spirit with four firing eyes associated with nightmares when causing someone to scream, similarly to [[Kikimora]]. Polunoshtnitsa and [[Poludnica]] are believed to be evil spirits causing death, while to [[Leshy|Lesnik]], [[Domovoi|Domovnik]] and [[Vodyanoy|Vodnik]] a dualistic nature is attributed.&lt;ref name=ivanichka/&gt; Thanks to the [[Volkhv|Vlshebnik]], a man of the community, a magician and a priest, communication with the "other" world was held.&lt;ref name=ivanichka/&gt; Torbalan is the [[Sack Man]] used to scare children, along with [[Baba Yaga]], who is a witch in her Bulgarian version &lt;ref name=ivanichka/&gt;

[[Kuma Lisa]] and [[Hitar Petar]] are the tricky fox and villager from the fairy tales, the tricked antagonist is often [[Nasreddin Hoca]], whereas [[Bay Ganyo]] is a ridiculed Bulgarian villager. Ivancho and Mariika are the protagonists of the jokes.

Despite eastern Ottoman influence is obvious in areas such as cuisine and music, Bulgarian folk beliefs and mythology seem to lack analogies with [[Turkic mythology]], [[Tengriism|paganism]] and any non-European folk beliefs,&lt;ref name=ivanichka/&gt; sо in pre-Christian times the ancient [[Bulgars]] were much inferior to the Slavs in the ethnogenesis and culture that resulted in modern Bulgarians. The Slavic language was officialized at the same time with Christianity, so Slavic paganism has never been a state religion of Bulgaria or more influential than [[Tengriism]].  Most of Bulgarian land lack any pagan archeology left from the Bulgars, despite early Christianization and that during most of the pagan period medieval Bulgarian borders spread significantly only in today's northern Bulgaria. Although legacy indicating ancient [[Bulgar]] culture is at most virtually absent in modern Bulgarian culture, some authors claim there is a similarity between the dress and customs of the [[Chuvashes]], who descend from the [[Volga Bulgars]], and the Bulgarian ethnographic group ''Kapantsi'' from [[Targovishte Province]] and [[Razgrad Province]], among whom the claim that they are direct descendants of [[Asparukh]]'s [[Bulgars]] is popular.,&lt;ref&gt;Следи от бита и езика на прабългарите в нашата народна култура, Иван Коев, София, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="max"&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacDermott|first1=Mercia|title=Bulgarian Folk Customs|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|isbn=9781853024856|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gh4IE6toGJMC&amp;pg=PA22|pages=41, 44|quote=The so-called Kapantsi - an ethnographic group living mainly in the Razgrad and Turgovishte, area of north-east Bulgaria - are believed to be descendants of Asparuh's Proto-Bulgars who have maintained at least something of their original heritage...the traditional costumes of Bulgaria are derived mainly from the ancient Slav costumes...Women's costumes fall into four main categories: one-apron, two-apron, sukman and saya.

The male dress is of likewise origin, usually [[Riza]] "robe",  poyas "belt", poturi "full-bottomed breeches" typical for the Slavs and often a [[Opanak|tsarvul]] and [[kalpak]] for shoes and jacket. Among the most similar relatives of the latter for example is [[Ukrainian Culture#Jewelry|Ukrainian]] hutsul, but the kalpak is attributed to Ottoman influence. The male skirt [[fustanella]] appears on the dress only of the [[Macedonian Bulgarians]] and is of indigenous Balkan origin or influence. In some dress of [[Thrace]] the symbol of the snake as in medieval tombs is found and is considered a Thracian cultural legacy and belief.&lt;ref name=ivanichka/&gt;

Folk songs are most often about the nymphs from Bulgarian and [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] mythology ([[Samodiva (mythology)|samovili]]) and the epic heroes (yunaks).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Instruments [[Gadulka]], [[Gusle|Gusla]] [[Duduk]], [[gaida]] [[Dvoyanka]] are analogous to other Slavic [[gudok]], [[dudka]] and [[Dvodentsivka]]. [[Kaval]] is common in the Balkans and Turkey and is akin to Arab [[Kawala]], as well as Tapan, Goblet Drum, [[Zurna]]. The most spread dance is a [[circle dance]] called [[horo (dance)|horo]] and [[khorovod]]. Songs are generally loud. Recent eastern influences from the genre music [[chalga]] and [[turbo-folk]] even brought a prestige for the masculine voices of females.

[[Valya Balkanska]] is a folk singer thanks to whom the [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian speech]] in her song "[[Izlel ye Delyo Haydutin]]" will be played in the [[Outer space]] for at least 60,000 years more as part of the [[Voyager Golden Record]] selection of music included in the two Voyager spacecraft launched in 1977.

As for most European peoples, [[association football|football]] became by far the most popular sport for the Bulgarians. [[Hristo Stoichkov]] was one of the best football (soccer) players in the second half of the 20th century, having played with the national team and [[FC Barcelona]]. He received a number of awards and was the joint top scorer at the [[1994 World Cup]]. [[Dimitar Berbatov]], formerly in [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen|Bayer Leverkusen]] and others, the national team and two domestic clubs, is still the most popular Bulgarian football player of the 21st century.

In the beginning of the 20th century Bulgaria was famous for two of the best wrestlers in the world – [[Dan Kolov]] and [[Nikola Petroff]]. [[Stefka Kostadinova]] is the best female [[high jump]]er, still holding the world record from 1987, one of the oldest unbroken world records for all kind of athletics. [[Ivet Lalova]] along with [[Irina Privalova]] is currently the fastest white woman at [[100 metres]]. [[Kotoōshū Katsunori|Kaloyan Mahlyanov]] has been the first European sumo wrestler to win the Emperor's Cup in Japan. Veselin Topalov won the 2005 [[World Chess Championship]]. He was ranked No. 1 in the world from April 2006 to January 2007, and had the second highest Elo rating of all time (2813). He regained the world No. 1 ranking again in October 2008.

===Symbols===
The national symbols of the Bulgarians are the [[Flag of Bulgaria|Flag]], the [[Coat of Arms of Bulgaria|Coat of Arms]], the [[National anthem of Bulgaria|National anthem]] and the [[National Guards Unit of Bulgaria|National Guard]], as well other unofficial symbols such as the [[Samara flag]].

The national flag of Bulgaria is a rectangle with three colours: white, green, and red, positioned horizontally top to bottom. The colour fields are of same form and equal size. It is generally known that the white represents – the sky, the green – the forest and nature and the red – the blood of the people, referencing the strong bond of the nation through all the wars and revolutions that have shaken the country in the past.
The [[Coat of Arms of Bulgaria]] is a state symbol of the sovereignty and independence of the Bulgarian people and state. It represents a crowned rampant golden lion on a dark red background with the shape of a shield. Above the shield there is a crown modeled after the crowns of the emperors of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]], with five crosses and an additional cross on top. Two crowned rampant golden lions hold the shield from both sides, facing it. They stand upon two crossed oak branches with acorns, which symbolize the power and the longevity of the Bulgarian state. Under the shield, there is a white band lined with the three national colours. The band is placed across the ends of the branches and the phrase "Unity Makes Strength" is inscribed on it.

Both the Bulgarian flag and the Coat of Arms are also used as symbols of various Bulgarian organisations, political parties and institutions.

The horse of the [[Madara Rider]] is preserved on the back of the Bulgarian [[stotinka]].

'''Cecilia Chung''' is a civil rights leader and activist for [[LGBT rights]], [[HIV/AIDS]] awareness, health advocacy and [[social justice]]. Cecilia is a [[trans woman]]. Her life story was one of four main storylines in the 2017 ABC miniseries ''[[When We Rise]]'' about LGBT rights in the 1970s and 1980s.

== Early life ==
Cecilia was born in [[Hong Kong]] in 1965 and later immigrated to [[Los Angeles]] with her family in 1984.&lt;ref name="TransMarch"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.transmarch.org/performers/cecilia-chung-chair-the-san-francisco-human-rights-commission |title=Cecilia Chung, Chair of the San Francisco Human Rights Commission |publisher=[[Trans March]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404070758/http://www.transmarch.org/performers/cecilia-chung-chair-the-san-francisco-human-rights-commission |archivedate=April 4, 2015 |accessdate=March 12, 2017 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, she moved to San Francisco to attend [[City College of San Francisco]] before transferring to [[Golden Gate University]] in 1987 with a degree in international management. Afterwards she spent a few years working as a court interpreter in [[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara County]],&lt;ref name="SFGate 2013-01-12"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Cecilia-Chung-transgender-health-advocate-4189493.php |title=Cecilia Chung, transgender health advocate |first=Heather |last=Knight |website=[[SFGate]] |date=January 12, 2013 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TheBody 2013-05-16"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ford |first1=Olivia |title=This Positive Life: Cecilia Chung on Violence, Gender, Prisons, Family and Healing |url=http://www.thebody.com/content/71526/this-positive-life-cecilia-chung-on-violence-gende.html |website=The Body |date=May 16, 2013 |accessdate=2016-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a well-paid sales trainer at a financial company.&lt;ref name="TheBody 2013-05-16"/&gt;

== Activism ==
Cecilia has spent much of her adult life advocating for health related issues affecting the LGBT community. This has included working as a HIV test counselor at [[UCSF AIDS Health Project]], HIV Program Coordinator at [[API American Health Forum]] and as Deputy Director at the [[Transgender Law Center]].&lt;ref name="TransMarch"/&gt;  Additionally, Cecilia is the first transgender woman and first Asian to be elected to lead the Board of Directors of the [[San Francisco Pride|San Francisco Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Celebration]], and the first transgender woman as well as the first person living openly with HIV to Chair the [[San Francisco Human Rights Commission]].&lt;ref name="UCSF Transhealth"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://transhealth.ucsf.edu/trans?page=ab-chung |title=Advisory Board: Cecilia Chung |publisher=[[Center of Excellence for Transgender Health]], [[University of California, San Francisco]] |date= |accessdate=August 8, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cecilia founded [[San Francisco Transgender Advocacy and Mentorship]] (SF TEAM) to provide events for the transgender community through the [[San Francisco LGBT Community Center]]. She was also one of the founders of the annual [[Trans March]].&lt;ref name="TransMarch"/&gt;

In 2013, Cecilia made headlines by making San Francisco the first city in the country to pay for [[gender reassignment surgery]] for uninsured transgender patients through her appointment to the Health Commission by Mayor Edward Lee. Through her appointment Cecilia was also able to provide training to [[San Francisco Department of Public Health]] staff members around transgender issues called “Transgender 101”.&lt;ref name="SFGate 2013-01-12"/&gt;

Currently, Cecilia serves on the [[Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS]], the current chair of US PLHIV Caucus and is also the Senior Director of Strategic Projects at the [[Transgender Law Center]].&lt;ref name="HRC"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hrc.org/blog/entry/meet-cecilia-chung-joanne-keatley-two-trailblazers-in-the-fight-against-hiv |title=Meet Cecilia Chung &amp; JoAnne Keatley: Two Trailblazers in the Fight against HIV/AIDS |first=Noël |last=Gordon |publisher=[[Human Rights Campaign]] |date=March 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
In 1992, Cecilia decided to go into transition. She became estranged from her family due to their lack of understanding towards her being transgender. She also had to resign from her around-the-clock position as a sales trainer at the financial company to facilitate the process. She then relied on her court interpreter job as the sole source of income, whose employment contract was soon terminated following a judge noticing her physical changes due to transition.&lt;ref name="TheBody 2013-05-16"/&gt; She eventually ended up [[homelessness|living on the streets]] and had to resort to [[sex work]] for livelihood.&lt;ref name="TheBody 2013-05-16"/&gt; Being a sex worker then subjected her to sexual and physical violence.&lt;ref name="TheBody 2013-05-16"/&gt; She also turned to drugs for self-medication.&lt;ref name="TheBody 2013-05-16"/&gt; In the same year, she was diagnosed as [[HIV positive]].&lt;ref name="TheBody 2013-05-16"/&gt;

In 1995, almost 3 years after having been homeless, Cecilia was stabbed during a sexual assault attempt and taken to the [[emergency room]].&lt;ref name="TheBody 2013-05-16"/&gt; Her mother, who was the emergency contact, came to the hospital for a visit and the two reconciled.&lt;ref name="TheBody 2013-05-16"/&gt; Since then, Cecilia completed her [[gender reassignment surgery]] in [[Bangkok]] in 1998.&lt;ref name="SFGate 2013-01-12"/&gt;

'''Charles Henry Schwanfelder''' (1774&amp;ndash;1837) was an English animal, landscape and portrait painter.

Schwanfelder was born and died in Leeds. He was the son of a German decorative painter and started out helping his father to paint clock faces and snuff boxes. He was renowned for his animal paintings and was appointed animal painter to [[George III of England|George III]] and [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]].&lt;ref name=art/&gt;

He exhibited at the Royal academy between 1809 and 1814&lt;ref name=art&gt;[http://www.artfact.com/catalog/viewLot.cfm?lotCode=miH5AIMh artfact.com] accessed April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Robert Knight''' (October 21, 1874 – April 15, 1953) was an [[United States|American]] [[Animal painter|wildlife]] and [[paleoart]]ist best known for his  paintings of [[dinosaur]]s and other [[prehistory|prehistoric]] animals. His works have been reproduced in many books and are currently on display at several major museums in the United States.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Knight was born in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]].

As a child, Knight was deeply interested in nature and animals, and spent many hours copying the illustrations from his father's [[natural history]] books. Though [[blindness|legally blind]] because of [[astigmatism (eye)|astigmatism]] and a subsequent injury to his right eye, Knight pursued his artistic talents with the help of specially designed glasses, and at the age of twelve, he enrolled at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art|Metropolitan Art School]] to become a [[drawing|commercial artist]]. In 1890, he was hired by a church-decorating firm to design [[stained glass|stained-glass windows]], and after two years with them, became a [[freelancer|freelance]] illustrator for books and [[magazine]]s, specializing in nature scenes.
[[Image:Knight entelodont.jpg|thumb|left|''Entelodon'' (then known as ''Elotherium''), the first commissioned restoration of an extinct animal by Charles R. Knight.{{sfn|Stout|2005|page=ix}}]]
In his free time, Knight visited the [[American Museum of Natural History]], attracting the attention of Dr. Jacob Wortman, who asked Knight to paint a restoration of a prehistoric [[pig]], ''[[Elotherium]]'', whose [[fossil]]ized bones were on display. Knight applied his knowledge of modern pig [[anatomy]], and used his imagination to fill in any gaps. Wortman was thrilled with the final result, and the museum soon commissioned Knight to produce an entire series of [[watercolor]]s to grace their fossil halls. His paintings were hugely popular among visitors, and Knight continued to work with the museum well into the 1930s, painting what would become some of the world's most celebrated images of dinosaurs, prehistoric mammals, and prehistoric humans.
[[Image:Laelaps-Charles Knight-1897.jpg|thumb|''Leaping Laelaps'' by Charles R. Knight, 1897]]
One of Knight's best-known pieces for the American Museum of Natural History is 1897's ''Leaping [[Dryptosaurus|Laelaps]]'', which was one of the few pre-1960s images to present dinosaurs as active, fast-moving creatures (thus anticipating the "[[Dinosaur renaissance|Dinosaur Renaissance]]" theories of modern [[paleontologist]]s like [[Robert Bakker]]). Other familiar American Museum paintings include Knight's portrayals of ''[[Agathaumas]]'', ''[[Allosaurus]]'', ''[[Apatosaurus|Brontosaurus]]'', ''[[Smilodon]]'', and the [[Mammoth|Woolly Mammoth]]. All of these have been reproduced in numerous places and have inspired many imitations.

Knight's work for the museum was not without critics, however: many curators argued that his work was more artistic than scientific, and protested that he did not have sufficient scientific expertise to render prehistoric animals as precisely as he did. While Knight himself agreed that his murals for the Hall of the Age of Man were "primarily a work of art," he insisted that he had as much paleontological knowledge as the museum's own curators.&lt;ref&gt;Cain, Victoria. "'The Direct Medium of the Vision': Visual Education, Virtual Witnessing and the Prehistoric Past at the American Museum of Natural History, 1890-1923." ''Journal of Visual Culture'', 2010, 9: 284, pp. 292-298.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nationwide attention===
[[Image:Smilodon Knight.jpg|thumb|left|''Smilodon'' from 1903.]] 
After Knight established a reputation at the American Museum of Natural History, other natural history museums began requesting paintings for their own fossil exhibits. In 1925, for example, Knight produced an elaborate mural for the [[Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County]] which portrayed some of the [[bird]]s and [[mammal]]s whose remains had been found in the nearby [[La Brea Tar Pits]]. The following year, Knight began a 28-[[mural]] series for [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]'s [[Field Museum of Natural History]], a project which chronicled the history of life on earth and took four years to complete. At the Field Museum, he produced one of his best-known pieces, a mural featuring ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' and ''[[Triceratops]]''. This confrontation scene between a [[predator]] and its [[prey]] would inspire a huge number of imitations, establishing the two dinosaurs as "mortal enemies" in the popular consciousness. The Field Museum's Alexander Sherman says, "It is so well-loved that it has become the standard encounter for portraying the age of dinosaurs".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charlesrknight.com/Alexander_Sherman.htm "Charles Knight: Prehistoric Visions of a Beloved Muralist"] 2002 Field Museum, In the Field article by Alexander Sherman&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Charles R. Knight.jpg|thumb|Knight working on ''[[Stegosaurus]]'' in 1899.]] 
Knight's work also found its way to the [[Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh|Carnegie Museums]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], the [[Smithsonian Institution]], and Yale's [[Peabody Museum of Natural History]], among others. Several [[zoo]]s, such as the [[Bronx Zoo]], the [[Lincoln Park|Lincoln Park Zoo]], and the [[Brookfield Zoo]], also approached Knight to paint murals of their living animals, and Knight enthusiastically complied. Knight was actually the only person in America allowed to paint [[Su Lin (1930s giant panda)|Su Lin]], a [[giant panda]] that lived at Brookfield Zoo during the 1930s.&lt;ref name="InterviewRKK"&gt;{{cite journal

While making murals for museums and zoos, Knight continued illustrating books and magazines, and became a frequent contributor to ''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]''. He also wrote and illustrated several books of his own, such as ''Before the Dawn of History'' (Knight, 1935), ''Life Through the Ages'' (1946), ''Animal Drawing: Anatomy and Action for Artists'' (1947), and ''Prehistoric Man: The Great Adventure'' (1949). Additionally, Knight became a popular [[lecture]]r, describing prehistoric life to audiences across the country.

Eventually, Knight began to retire from the public sphere to spend more time with his grandchildren, who shared his passion for animals and prehistoric life. In 1951, he painted his last work, a mural for the [[Everhart Museum]] in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]]. Two years later, he died in Manhattan.

==Legacy==
[[Image:Pasta-Brontosaurus.jpg|thumb|''Brontosaurus'', 1897.]]
Knight has been hailed as "one of the great popularizers of the prehistoric past", and as having influenced generations of museum-goers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berman|first1=J. C.|doi=10.1525/aa.2003.105.1.143 |title=A Note on the Paintings of Prehistoric Ancestors by Charles R. Knight|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=105|pages=143–146|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of Knight's work frequently appeared in dinosaur books published in the US during the first half of the twentieth century.{{sfn|Stout|2005|page=xi |ps=. "There was scarcely a dinosaur book published in the first sixty years of the 20th century that did not include examples of Knight's work."}} Many works released since then also include examples of Knight's paintings; for example, [[Stephen Jay Gould]] used one of Knight's paintings for the cover of his 1991 book ''[[Bully for Brontosaurus]]'' and another in his 1996 book ''[[Dinosaur in a Haystack]]''. Though many other paleoartists have succeeded Knight (most notably [[Zdeněk Burian]]) Knight's paintings still remain very popular among paleontology enthusiasts. A commemorative edition of Knight's 1946 book ''Life Through the Ages'' {{ISBN|0-253-33928-6}} was recently published by [[Indiana University|Indiana University Press]], and a 2007 [[calendar]] {{ISBN|0-7649-3622-0}} of Knight's paintings is also currently available. Additionally, fantasy artist [[William Stout]] has compiled a series of ''Charles Knight Sketchbooks'', which contain many rare and previously unpublished drawings and [[study (drawing)|studies]] by Knight. 
[[Image:Agathaumas.jpg|thumb|left|Knight's restoration of ''Agathaumas'' from 1897, which was later used as basis for a model ''Agathaumas'' used in the 1925 film ''[[The Lost World (1925 film)|The Lost World]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://silentmoviemonsters.tripod.com/TheLostWorld/LWDELGADO.html Marcel Delgado: The Man Who Made Monsters] Retrieved October 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

Because Knight worked in an era when new and often fragmentary fossils were coming out of the American west in quantity, not all of his creations were based on solid evidence; dinosaurs such as his improbably-adorned ''[[Agathaumas]]'' (1897) for example, were somewhat speculative. His depictions of better-known [[ceratopsians]] as solitary animals inhabiting lush grassy landscapes were largely imaginative (the grasslands that feature in many of his paintings didn't appear until the [[Cenozoic]]).
Although Knight sometimes made musculoskeletal studies of living animals, he did not do so for his dinosaur restorations, and he restored many dinosaurs with typical reptilian-like limbs and narrow hips (Paul, 1996). In the 1920s, studies by the celebrated palaeontologists [[Alfred Romer]] and [[Gerhard Heilmann]] (Heilmann, 1926) had confirmed that dinosaurs had broad avian-like hips rather than those of a typical reptile. Knight often restored extinct mammals, birds and marine reptiles in very dynamic action poses, but his depictions of large dinosaurs as ponderous swamp-dwellers destined for extinction reflected more traditional concepts (Paul, 1996). In his catalogue to ''Life through the Ages'' (1946), he reiterated views that he had written earlier (Knight, 1935), describing the great beasts as "slow-moving dunces" that were "unadaptable and unprogressive" while conceding that small dinosaurs had been more active. Some of his pictures are now known to be wrong, such as the tripod kangaroo-like posture of the [[hadrosaurs]] and [[theropods]], whereas their spinal column was roughly horizontal at the hip; and the [[sauropods]] standing deeply in water whereas they were land-dwellers. Knight also drew dinosaur tails dragging on the ground, whereas they were held out approximately horizontally.
[[File:Font-de-Gaume.jpg|thumb|Cro-Magnon artists painting in Font-de-Gaume, 1920]] 
The late [[Stephen Jay Gould]] was one of Knight's most well-known fans, notably refusing to refer to ''Brontosaurus'' as "''[[Apatosaurus]]''" because Knight had always referred to the creature with the former name.&lt;ref name="InterviewRKK"/&gt; Gould writes in his 1989 book ''[[Wonderful Life (book)|Wonderful Life]]'', "Not since the Lord himself showed his stuff to Ezekiel in the valley of dry bones had anyone shown such grace and skill in the reconstruction of animals from disarticulated skeletons. Charles R. Knight, the most celebrated of artists in the reanimation of fossils, painted all the canonical figures of dinosaurs that fire our fear and imagination to this day".&lt;ref name="WorldCRK"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.charlesrknight.com |title=Welcome to the World of Charles R. Knight}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other admirers have included [[special effects]] artist [[Ray Harryhausen]], who writes in his autobiography ''An Animated Life'', "Long before Obie ([[Willis O'Brien]]), myself, and [[Steven Spielberg]], he put flesh on creatures that no human had ever seen. […] At the L.A. County Museum I vividly remember a beautiful Knight mural on one of the walls depicting the way the tar pits would have looked in ancient times. This, plus a picture book about Knight's work my mother gave me, were my first encounters with a man who was to prove an enormous help when the time came for me to make three-dimensional models of these extinct beings".&lt;ref name="WorldCRK"/&gt; Paleoartist [[Gregory S. Paul]] has also mentioned Knight as a big influence on him.&lt;ref&gt;

In 2012 a book about Knight and his art written by [[Richard Milner (historian)|Richard Milner]] titled ''Charles R. Knight The Artist Who Saw Through Time'' was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parrish|first1=M. A.|title=Grand Master of Reconstruction|doi=10.1126/science.1220073|journal=Science|volume=335|issue=6071|pages=921|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An homage to the painter was also made in the [[IMAX]] feature film, ''[[T-Rex: Back to the Cretaceous]]'', in which he was portrayed by actor Tuck Milligan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5813">[[File:Astronaut patrick g. forrester.jpg|thumb|right|'''[[Patrick Forrester]]''' is the current Chief of the Astronaut Office, having served since June 2017.]]

The '''Chief of the Astronaut Office''' is the most senior leadership position for active [[astronaut]]s at the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA). The Chief Astronaut serves as head of the [[NASA Astronaut Corps]] and is the principal advisor to the [[NASA Administrator]] on astronaut training and operations.

==History==
When [[Deke Slayton]] was grounded from the [[Mercury Seven]] due to a heart condition, he took on the position of '''Coordinator of Astronaut Activities''' and informally held the title of "chief astronaut". In this role, he held responsibility for the operation of the astronaut office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/slayton.html |title=Astronaut Bio: Deke Slayton 6/93 |publisher=Jsc.nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The position of Chief of the Astronaut Office was officially created in November 1963, when [[Alan Shepard]] was named as the first Chief Astronaut. His responsibilities included monitoring the coordination, scheduling, and control of all activities involving NASA astronauts. This included monitoring the development and implementation of effective training programs to assure the flight readiness of available pilot and non-pilot personnel for assignment to crew positions on manned space flights; furnishing pilot evaluations applicable to the design, construction, and operations of spacecraft systems and related equipment; and providing qualitative scientific and engineering observations to facilitate overall mission planning, formulation of feasible operational procedures, and selection and conduct of specific experiments for each flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/shepard-alan.html |title=Astronaut Bio: Alan B. Shepard, Jr. 7/98 |publisher=Jsc.nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Shuttle era, the Chief of the Astronaut Office often returns to active duty in the Office once their term is complete. The Chief is currently responsible for managing Astronaut Office resources and operations, and helps develop astronaut flight crew operation concepts and crew assignments for future spaceflight missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-names-astronaut-patrick-forrester-new-chief-of-astronaut-office |title=NASA Names Astronaut Patrick Forrester New Chief of Astronaut Office |publisher=Jsc.nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2017-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Johan Emil Kauppi''' (28 October 1875 – disappeared 1930) was a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[composer]]. His teachers included [[Jean Sibelius]].&lt;ref&gt;''Otavan Iso Musiikkitietosanakirja 3'', p. 388 (s.v. Kauppi, Johan Emil). Helsinki 1978. {{ISBN|951-1-04553-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kauppi married Liina Lovisa Lindström in 1908.

He wrote two operas. The first, in 1925, was ''Päiväkummun pidot'' (The Feast at Solhaug), which was well received by critics. The second, in 1930, was ''Nummisuutarit'' (The Cobblers on the Heath), which received only poor reviews.

In October 1930, shortly after the premiere of ''Nummisuutarit'', he disappeared and is thought to have committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fimic.fi/fimic/fimic.nsf/mainframe?readform&amp;9615945EFB623137C2256D7B003620A8 FIMIC.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927190030/http://www.fimic.fi/fimic/fimic.nsf/mainframe?readform&amp;9615945EFB623137C2256D7B003620A8 |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Enrique Alvear Urrutia''' (31 January 1916 &amp;ndash; 29 April 1982) was a [[Chilean people|Chilean]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[prelate]] who served as the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of San Felipe, Chile|Bishop of San Felipe]] from 1965 until 1974 when he was made one of the two [[Auxiliary bishop|auxiliaries]] for the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Santiago de Chile|Santiago de Chile archdiocese]].&lt;ref name=CR&gt;{{citeweb|date=15 January 2018|accessdate=17 January 2018|publisher=Crux|title=Pope shakes up Chile trip with surprise visit to 'bishop of the poor'|url=https://cruxnow.com/pope-in-chile-and-peru/2018/01/15/pope-shaks-chile-trip-surprise-visit-bishop-poor/}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a vocal critic during the [[dictatorship]] of [[Augusto Pinochet]] and braved potential detention and [[death threats]] to condemn [[human rights abuses]] and other atrocities the regime undertook.

The process for his potential beatification opened in 2012 and he is titled as a [[Servant of God]]. He has also been referred to as the "bishop of the poor" for his dedication to the poor and oppressed.&lt;ref name=CR/&gt;

==Life==
Enrique Alvear Urrutia was born on 31 January 1916&lt;ref&gt;Some sources suggest he was born on 29 January.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Cauquenes]] in [[Chile]] as the eighth of eleven brothers to Clorindo Alvear Zurita and Teodorinda Urrutia Pérez; his brother was Eduardo.

He spent his education first in his hometown and then in the Luis Campino Humanities Institute before he pursued a law degree from 1934 in the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Chile|Pontifica Universidad Católica de Chile]]. In one spiritual retreat of [[Monsignor]] Carlos Casanueva Opazo he discovered his call to the [[priesthood]] and he began his ecclesial studies.

He received his [[ordination]] to the priesthood in the [[Santiago Metropolitan Cathedral|Santiago Cathedral]] on 20 September 1941 from [[José María Caro Rodríguez]] and then started pastoral work in archdiocese. He first worked as a professor in addition to being a [[spiritual director]] for [[seminarians]]. [[Pope John XXIII]] appointed him in 1963 as a bishop assigned as one of the [[Auxiliary bishop|auxiliaries]] for the [[Talca]] diocese while making him the Titular Bishop of Columnata. He received his [[episcopal consecration]] a month after the appointment from [[Raúl Silva Henríquez]]; the [[co-consecrators]] were Manuel Larraín Errazuriz and Eladio Vicuña Aránquiz. In 1965 he was appointed as the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of San Felipe, Chile|Bishop of San Felipe]]; he held that position until he resigned in 1974. But since he was under the retirement age [[Pope Paul VI]] named him as one of the two auxiliaries for the Santiago archdiocese as well as the [[Diocese of Sita|Titular Bishop of Sita]].&lt;ref name=CR/&gt; He served as a [[Council Father]] in the [[Second Vatican Council]] in the second to fourth sessions.

He opposed [[human rights abuses]] during the [[Augusto Pinochet|Pinochet]] [[dictatorship]] and defended the regime's victims all the while braving potential detention and [[death threats]]. In the evening on 11 September 1973 - against the advice of his aides - he went to prisons to inquire about people who were rounded up in a wave of arrests as part of Pinochet's coup against the sitting [[President of Chile|President]] [[Salvador Allende]]. &lt;ref name=CR/&gt; There was also one occasion where bombs were placed in his office in a failed attempt to intimidate him into silence. He later became involved with the [[Latin American Episcopal Conference|Episcopal Conference of Latin America and the Caribbean]].

He died on 29 April 1982 and his remains were interred in the Marian shrine Nuestra Señora de Lourdes in [[Quinta Normal]] until their transferral on 13 April 2008 to the San Luis Beltrán church. [[Pope Francis]] - during his trip to Chile in 2018 - made an unscheduled visit to the late bishop's tomb for some brief moments of reflection.&lt;ref name=CR/&gt;

==Beatification process==
The beatification process was initiated in the Santiago archdiocese; initial steps towards opening the cause came on 16 December 2011 when the then-Archbishop (now [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinal]]) [[Ricardo Ezzati Andrello]] named the Enrique Alvear Urrutia Foundation as the official actor for promoting the cause. Ezzati later inaugurated the diocesan phase for the cause on 9 March 2012 and closed it later on 3 December 2014; during 2013 the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] declared "[[nihil obstat]]" (no objections) to the cause.&lt;ref name=CR/&gt;

The current [[postulator]] for the cause is the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priest Pascual Cebollada Silvestre.

The museum shows memorabilia of the late president, from his stint in the armed forces down to his presidency. The large cenotaph which contains the glass-encased coffin in which the widely believed embalmed body of Marcos was on public display shortly after his remains were brought in Ilocos Norte from the United States in 1993&lt;ref&gt;Eugene (2008-02-06) [http://www.vistapinas.com/article/marcos-museum-and-mausoleum Marcos Museum and Mausoleum] ''Vista Pinas'', retrieved January 14, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldtourist.us/ilocosnorte/laoag.html The Province of Ilocos Norte] ''World Tourist'', retrieved January 14, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; until his body was re-interred at the [[Heroes' Cemetery]] in [[Taguig]] on November 18, 2016.

==History==
[[File:Marcos Monument Batac Ilocos Norte.jpg|thumb|220px|right|A statue of Ferdinand Marcos erected in [[Batac, Ilocos Norte]]]]
===Ferdinand E. Marcos' death===
On September 28, 1989, Marcos died of lung, kidney and liver complications in [[Hawaii]], three years after he, his family and allies were exiled. In 1986, Marcos fled the country in the face of a [[nonviolent revolution]] "[[People Power Revolution|people power]]" which set the end of his regime.&lt;ref&gt;Admin (2009-11-01) [http://www.valcaulin.com/article/marcos-mausoleum-in-batac-ilocos-norte/843/# Marcos Mausoleum in Batac, Ilocos Norte] ''Valerie Caulin'', retrieved January 14, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The odyssey of his remains began when the government of President [[Corazon Aquino]] denied Marcos' return to the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;Seth Mydans (1988-05-25) [https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/25/world/in-philippines-one-last-symbol-lies-in-state.html In Philippines, One Last Symbol Lies in State] ''[[New York Times]]'', retrieved January 15, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Marcos' remains was interred in a private air conditioned mausoleum at [[Byodo-In_Temple#Modern_Hawai.27i|Byodo-In]], a [[Japanese Buddhism|Japanese Buddhist]] temple, on the island of [[Oahu]].&lt;ref&gt;Admin (2001-05-25) [https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/22512 Ferdinand E. Marcos] ''Find A Grave'', retrieved January 14, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return of Marcos' remains===
In September 1993, after having been kept in a refrigerated, glass-topped coffin inside an air-conditioned crypt for four years, Marcos' remains were finally taken to the Philippines.&lt;ref name="Seattle"&gt;William Branigin (1993-09-07) [http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19930907&amp;slug=1719891 Imelda Marcos Plans Funeral Extravaganza For Ex-Dictator – Hoopla Abounds As Body Arrives In Home Province] ''Seattle Times'', retrieved January 14, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The newly elected president who succeeded Aquino, [[Fidel Ramos]], second cousin of the late president, allowed [[Imelda Marcos]], Marcos' widow, to bring her husband's body home but refused her demand for a hero’s burial.&lt;ref&gt;Seth Mydans (2011-03-09) [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/10/world/asia/10marcos.html?_r=1 A Hero’s Burial for Long-Dead President Marcos? It’s Being Considered] ''[[New York Times]]'', retrieved January 14, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, after series of rituals and ceremonies, Marcos' remains were interred in a mausoleum in his hometown for public display, according to his family&lt;ref name="Seattle" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yodi Insigne (2011-08-23) [http://www.yodisphere.com/2011/08/batac-city-ilocos-norte-understanding.html Batac City, Ilocos Norte » Understanding the Final Argument of a Dictator's Town] ''Yodisphere'', retrieved January 14, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William L.

Esplanada (2011-06-03).

[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/56721/malacanang-mum-on-binay-recommendations-for-marcos-burial Malacanang mum on Binay recommendations for Marcos burial] ''Philippine Daily Inquirer'', retrieved January 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Just recently, the new president, Rodrigo Duterte approved Marcos burial in the cemetery and was buried in the place on November 18, 2016.

===The remains of Ferdinand Marcos===
Frank Malabed, Marcos' mortician, states that he has helped preserve the body during its interment at the former mausoleum in Barac. It took him three weeks to restore Marcos' body so that [[Filipino people|Filipinos]] would recognize it. Local morticians maintain and check it regularly. [[Formaldehyde]] was used to preserve the body before it was flown to the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;Archives (1992-04-03) [http://www.deseretnews.com/article/218855/MARCOS-UNDERTAKER-TO-READY-HIS-BODY-FOR-RETURN-HOME.html Marcos' Undertaker to Ready His Body for Return Home] ''Deseret News'' retrieved January 15, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported on August 2016, that Historian Antonio Montalvan II said that a close Marcos family friend of his revealed that the body displayed on the glass coffin was a wax figure and not the preserved remains of Ferdinand Marcos. Montalvan added that the real body of Marcos is buried underneath the glass coffin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pedroza|first1=Stephen|title=Are we really burying Marcos' 'body'?|url=http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/144664-marcos-necropolitics-bury|accessdate=21 November 2016|work=Rappler|date=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A wax replica of Marcos' remains was reportedly left inside the glass coffin on the day Marcos' real body was interred at the [[Heroes' Cemetery]]. There are reportedly two or three replicas of Marcos' body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cepeda|first1=Mara|title=‘Replica’ left in mausoleum on day of Marcos burial|url=http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/inside-track/152973-replica-body-mausoleum-marcos-burial|accessdate=21 November 2016|publisher=Rappler|date=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dr. Jafar Sharif-Emami (1976).jpg|thumb|left|Sharif-Emami as [[Senate of Iran|President of Senate]]]]

Sharif-Emami was born in [[Tehran]] on 8 September 1910 to a clerical family and his father was a mullah.&lt;ref name=milani/&gt; After high school, Sharif-Emami was sent (along with thirty other young men) to [[Germany]] where he studied for eighteen months, returning to Iran in 1930 to work with state railroad organization until the [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran|Anglo-Soviet Invasion]].&lt;ref name=milani/&gt; Years later he was sent to [[Sweden]] for technical training, returning in 1939 when he received a degree in engineering.&lt;ref name="memoirs"/&gt;

==Career and activities==
Sharif-Emami began his career the Iranian state railways in 1931.&lt;ref name=saxonyt/&gt; Arrested in summer of 1943 for alleged ties to Germany he was kept in detention along with many other members of Iran's elite. After his release he was appointed director general of the Irrigation Agency.&lt;ref name="memoirs"/&gt; In 1950, he was appointed undersecretary of roads and communications.&lt;ref name=saxonyt/&gt; In June 1950, prime minister and General Haj Ali Razmara appointed him acting minister and then minister of roads, his first cabinet post.&lt;ref name="memoirs"/&gt;

He served as the minister of industries and mines in [[Manuchehr Eqbal]]'s cabinet.&lt;ref name="Avsati"&gt;'Alí Rizā Awsatí (عليرضا اوسطى), ''Iran in the Past Three Centuries'' (''Irān dar Se Qarn-e Goz̲ashteh'' - ايران در سه قرن گذشته), Volumes 1 and 2 (Paktāb Publishing - انتشارات پاکتاب, Tehran, Iran, 2003). {{ISBN|964-93406-6-1}} (Vol. 1), {{ISBN|964-93406-5-3}} (Vol. 2).&lt;/ref&gt; He was prime minister from 1960 to 1961, and again in 1978, a few months before the overthrow of the Shah.&lt;ref name=saxonyt/&gt; He was appointed prime minister by Shah on 27 August 1978 because of his ties to clergy.&lt;ref name=Moaddel1994&gt;{{cite book|author=Mansoor Moaddel|title=Class, Politics, and Ideology in the Iranian Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cgt2XSOuVgoC&amp;pg=PA160|accessdate=25 July 2013|date=January 1994|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-51607-5|pages=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharif-Emami succeeded [[Jamshid Amouzegar]] in the post.&lt;ref name=Moaddel1994/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nikazmerad|first=Nicholas M.|title=A Chronological Survey of the  Iranian Revolution|journal=Iranian Studies|date=1980|volume=13|issue=1/4|pages=327–368|jstor=4310346|doi=10.1080/00210868008701575}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his short tenure, he undid many of the Shah's plans including the closing of casinos, abandoning the Imperial calendar, abolishing the [[Rastakhiz Party|Rastakhiz]] Party and allowing all political parties to be active and personally responsible for preventing SAVAK to get involved and preventing the KGB backed clergyman from creating and continuing the 1979 revolution.&lt;ref name="Avsati"/&gt; All of his efforts to reform the political system in Iran, was overshadowed by the [[Black Friday (1978)|Black Friday]] massacre in Jaleh Square (8 September 1978), mass protests, martial law and nationwide strikes, which brought the country's economy to its knees.

'''Joseph Gedaliah Klausner ''' ({{lang-he-n|יוסף גדליה קלוזנר}}; 20 August 1874 – 27 October 1958), was a [[Ashkenazi Jew|Jewish]] historian and professor of [[Hebrew Literature]]. He was the chief [[redactor]] of the ''[[Encyclopedia Hebraica]]''. He was a candidate for president in the [[Israeli presidential election, 1949|first Israeli presidential election]] in 1949, losing to [[Chaim Weizmann]].  Klausner was the great uncle of Israeli author [[Amos Oz]].

== Biography==
Joseph Klausner was born in [[Valkininkai|Olkeniki]], [[Vilna Governorate]] in 1874. At the turn of the 20th century, the Klausners left Lithuania and settled in [[Odessa]]. Klausner was active in the city's scientific, literary and Zionist circles. He was a committed [[Zionist]] who knew [[Theodore Herzl]] personally and attended the [[First Zionist Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=hlIBAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA96&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;dq=first+congress+zionist+klausner&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XaWnOVriZe&amp;sig=eDxs5v5123qoNvN-Rmryk7-C1iM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiKuO2I59_bAhUEkpAKHbyjDLwQ6AEIZzAN#v=onepage&amp;q=first%20congress%20zionist%20klausner&amp;f=false Triumph of Military Zionism: Nationalism and the Origins of the Israeli Right,  Colin Shindler]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1912, Klausner visited Palestine for the first time, and settled there in 1919. In 1925, he became a professor of Hebrew literature at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]].  He specialized in the history of the [[Second Temple period]]. Although not  an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] Jew, he observed  [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] and the [[Kashrut|dietary laws]]. He had a wide grasp of the [[Talmud]] and [[Midrash]]ic literature.
[[File:Young Dr Joseph Klausner.jpg|thumb|150px|A young Joseph Klausner]]
Joseph Klausner was a member of the circle of Russian Zionist political activists from Odessa, which included [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]] and [[Menachem Ussishkin]]. Although not a 'party man,' he supported [[Revisionist Zionism]]. In July 1929, Klausner established the [[Pro-Wailing Wall Committee]] to defend Jewish rights, and resolve problems over access and arrangements for worship at the Western Wall.&lt;ref&gt;Shindler, Colin, ''The Triumph of Military Zionism: Nationalism and the Origins of the Israeli Right'', pp.&amp;nbsp;96–97,  (2006), I B Tauris &amp; Co Ltd., {{ISBN|978-1-84511-030-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; His house in [[Talpiot]] neighborhood of Jerusalem was destroyed in the [[1929 Palestine riots]].&lt;ref&gt;Mattar, Philip, ''The Mufti of Jerusalem: Al-Hajj Amin Al-Husayni and the Palestinian National Movement''. Columbia University Press. {{ISBN|0-231-06463-2}}, (1988), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his Zionist ideology, Klausner had numerous disagreements with [[Chaim Weizmann]]. The two were candidates in the [[Israeli presidential election, 1949|presidential election of 1949]]; Weizmann was declared the first [[President of Israel]].

== Academic career==
Klausner earned his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[Germany]]. One of his most influential books was about [[Jesus]]. The book ''Jesus of Nazareth'', and its sequel, ''From Jesus to Paul'', gained him fame. In it, Klausner described how Jesus was best understood as a Jew and [[Israelite]] who was trying to reform the religion, and died as a devout Jew. [[Herbert Danby]], an Anglican priest, translated the work from Hebrew into English so that English scholars might avail themselves of the information. A number of clergymen, incensed at Danby for translating the book, demanded his recall from Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;[[Amos Oz]], ''A Tale of Love and Darkness'', page 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in his career, he was given a chair in [[Jewish history]].

== Early life ==

''Little Turtle''). Her father, Wok-shin-gah (var. ''Crescent Moon'') was [[Little Turtle|Mihšihkinaahkwa]]'s son. Her mother was Nah-wah-kah-mo-kwa (var.

Her first husband was John Owl, the son of Chief John Owl. In 1826, the pair wed in an area referred to as Seek's Village around the [[Eel River (Wabash River)|Eel River]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; John passed away with the first year or two of their marriage. In 1832, Kiilh-sooh-kwa wed Shaw-pe-nom-quah (var. ''Anthony Revarre''), who was of half Native American, half French descent trader. Together Kiilh-sooh-kwa and Shaw-pe-nom-quah had six children, four of whom died in infancy. Her two surviving children were a son, Wa-pe-mung-quah (var.

== Later life ==
Little is documented of her young adult life, though in 2013 she was described by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] as an important midwife in Indiana who understood and used plant knowledge related to childbirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.nmai.si.edu/main/2013/09/not-the-last-of-the-miamis.html|title=Not the "Last of the Miamis"|website=blog.nmai.si.edu|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her later years, she lived in [[Roanoke, Indiana]] on but forty acres of what remained of her family's and her nation's territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=The Last Of The Miamis|last=Henderson Wheelock|first=Matilda|date=22 August 1909|work=The Star Press (Muncie, Indiana), Sunday Edition|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She only spoke in her native language despite some sources suggested she understood some English.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One of the few English words that she knew and used frequently was "[[rheumatism]]," given her affliction with the disease.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; She was described in 1905 as "a big woman, of swarthy appearance, and...a devotee of the pipe, which she has with her almost incessantly" and, separately, was described as a devout Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Indiana's Only Princess|last=|first=|date=8 November 1905|work=The Elwood Daily Record (Elwood, IN)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Paleface Tribute Makes Squaw Glad – Kil-So-Quah Excited Over One Hundredth Birthday Celebration at Roanoke Today – 20,000 People Expected|last=|first=|date=4 July 1910|work=The Indianapolis Start (Indianapolis, Indiana)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915, a Fort Wayne-based newspaper reported that, "if a stranger called, the old woman would grasp the hand and give a firm grip, and after looking you over would in her quaint way and feeble voice mutter a few words in her native tongue, that if interpreted would be a hearty welcome."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; An estimated 15,000 attendees celebrated her 100th birthday in Roanoke and her centennial was well-documented in Indiana newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Kilsoquah Centennial|last=|first=|date=7 July 1910|work=The Weekly Republican (Plymouth, Indiana)|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She passed away on 4 September 1915 at her home in Roanoke after spending a few weeks ill and confined to her bed. Her death was described as "without a struggle, for death was only a break in the well worn thread of life."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Her passing was characterized in 1917 as a loss of "the last royal Miamis and the oldest resident of the State of Indiana, who had enjoyed a national reputation."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Her funeral services were held at St. James Catholic Church in Roanoke and she was buried in the I.O.O.F. Cemetery (Glenwood Cemetery) in Roanoke.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Dotcom is the founder of now-defunct [[file hosting service]] [[Megaupload]] (2005–2012).&lt;ref name="investigate"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.florianpoullin.fr/sites/florianpoullin.fr/files/investigate.pdf |title=Merry Chrischmitz or Merry Hell? |last1=Wishart |first1=Ian |date=April 2010 |work=[[Investigate (magazine)|Investigate]] |accessdate=31 December 2011}} p29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="news.cnet.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sandoval |first=Greg |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-31001_3-20087753-261/the-mystery-man-behind-megaupload-piracy-fight/ |title=The mystery man behind Megaupload piracy fight |publisher=CNET News |date=4 August 2011 |accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, he achieved notoriety in Germany as a teen hacker who received a two-year suspended sentence for selling identities that he had siphoned from telephone operators' client database. Since the closure of Megaupload, he has been accused of criminal [[copyright infringement]] and other charges, such as [[money laundering]], [[racketeering]] and [[wire fraud]], by the [[U.S. Department of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/01/why-kim-dotcom-hasnt-been-extradited-3-years-after-the-us-smashed-megaupload|title=Why Kim Dotcom hasn't been extradited 3 years after the US smashed Megaupload|last=Farivar|first=Cyrus|date=18 January 2015|website=[[Ars Technica]]|access-date=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 20 February 2017, a New Zealand court ruled that Dotcom, as well as co-accused Mathias Ortmann, Bram van der Kolk and Carter Edwards, could be extradited to the US on fraud charges related to Megaupload. Dotcom denies any wrongdoing and has accused US authorities of pursuing a vendetta against him on behalf of politically influential Hollywood studios.&lt;ref name="Eleanor Ainge Roy"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/20/kim-dotcom-eligible-for-extradition-to-us-new-zealand-high-court-rules |title=Kim Dotcom extradition to US can go ahead, New Zealand high court rules |newspaper=The Guardian |date=20 February 2017|author= Eleanor Ainge Roy |accessdate= 23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 July 2018, the [[New Zealand Court of Appeal]] upheld the lower court's ruling. His lawyer said that he would appeal the decision to the [[Supreme Court of New Zealand|Supreme Court]].&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-newzealand-internet-dotcom/megaupload-founder-kim-dotcom-can-be-extradited-to-u-s-new-zealand-court-idUSKBN1JU2WY|title=Kim Dotcom, Megaupload founder, can face U.S. extradition: New Zealand court|last=Greenfield|first=Charlotte|date=4 July 2018|work=Reuters|access-date=2018-07-05|last2=Kihara|first2=Leika|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Dotcom launched another [[cloud storage]] service called [[Mega (service)|Mega]], although he later severed all ties with the service in 2015. He also started and funded the [[Internet Party (New Zealand)|Internet Party]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/9873341/Launch-day-for-Kim-Dotcoms-Internet-Party Launch day for Kim Dotcom's Internet Party], Stuff 27 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The party contested the [[New Zealand general election, 2014|2014 New Zealand general election]] under an electoral alliance with the [[Mana Movement]], and the [[New Zealand general election, 2017|2017 general election]], but failed to win any seats at either election.

Prior to his arrest in New Zealand, he enjoyed a luxurious life. In 2001, his main source of income was a company called Kimvestor, which he valued at 200 million euros. He is known for spending his money on expensive cars and boats. On one occasion he spent $1 million chartering a 240-foot luxury yacht which he moored in Monte Carlo harbour during the [[2000 Monaco Grand Prix|2000 Monaco Formula One Grand Prix]], and threw lavish parties for guests including [[Rainier III, Prince of Monaco|Prince Rainier of Monaco]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2001/jan/26/internetnews.business2?INTCMP=SRCH The world of Kim Schmitz], The Guardian 26 January 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal investigations ==

=== Germany ===
As a teenager, Schmitz acquired a reputation in his native Germany after saying that he had bypassed the security of [[NASA]], [[the Pentagon]] and [[Citibank]] under the name of Kimble – based on the character of Dr Richard Kimble in the long-running television programme ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]''.&lt;ref name="investigate" /&gt; He also stated that he hacked corporate [[Private branch exchange|PBX]] systems in the United States and said he was selling the access codes at $200 each, bragging that "every PBX is an open door to me".&lt;ref name="Megalife of Kim Dotcom"&gt;Michael Courtenay, [http://www.sociallyengineered.com.au/chronic/2012/02/03/chronic-megalife-of-kim-dotcom/ Megalife of Kim Dotcom]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, he was arrested by German police for trafficking in stolen phone calling card numbers. He was held in custody for a month, released and arrested again on additional hacking charges shortly afterwards. He was eventually convicted of 11 counts of computer fraud, 10 counts of data espionage, and an assortment of other charges. He received a two-year [[suspended sentence]] – because he was underage at the time the crimes were committed.&lt;ref name="Megalife of Kim Dotcom" /&gt; The judge in the case said the court viewed his actions as "youthful foolishness".&lt;ref name="fastcompany.com"&gt;Austin Carr, [http://www.fastcompany.com/1810015/inside-megauploads-megamind-kim-dotcoms-playboy-bunnies-russian-nuclear-vessels-and-private- Inside Megaupload's Megamind: Kim Dotcom's Playboy Bunnies, Russian Nuclear Vessels, And Private War On Terror], 20 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Schmitz bought €375,000 worth of shares of the nearly bankrupt company [[:de:Letsbuyit.com|Letsbuyit.com]] and subsequently announced his intention to invest €50 million in the company.&lt;ref name="spiegel"&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-21303770.html?name=Haftstrafe+f%26uuml%3Br+Schmitz%3F Haftstrafe für Schmitz?] {{de icon}}, ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' 5/2002, 28 January 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement caused the share value of Letsbuyit.com to jump&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manager-magazin.de/geld/boersenblick/0,2828,114029,00.html "Rekordanstieg bei Letsbuyit"] {{de icon}} Manager-Magazin, 25 January 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and Schmitz cashed out, making a profit of €1.5 million. One commentator suggested that Schmitz may have been ignorant of the legal ramifications of what he had done, since [[insider trading]] was not made a crime in Germany until 1995,&lt;ref name="Megalife of Kim Dotcom" /&gt; and until 2002 prosecutors also had to prove the accused had criminal intent.&lt;ref name="businessweek.com"&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_15/b3878157_mz035.htm Luring German Investors Back Into The Pool], ''[[Business Week]]'', 12 April 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thailand ===
Dotcom moved to [[Thailand]] to avoid investigation&lt;ref name="investigate" /&gt; where he was subsequently arrested on behalf of German authorities.&lt;ref name="fastcompany.com" /&gt; In response, he allegedly pretended to kill himself online, posting a message on his website that from now on he wished to be known as "His Royal Highness King Kimble the First, Ruler of the Kimpire".&lt;ref name="fastcompany.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/01/kim-dotcom/ |work=Wired |first=Sean |last=Gallagher |title=The Fast, Fabulous, Allegedly Fraudulent Life of Megaupload's Kim Dotcom |date=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[deported]] back to Germany where he pleaded guilty to [[embezzlement]] in November 2003 and, after five months in jail awaiting trial, again received a [[suspended sentence]], this time of 20 months.&lt;ref name="businessweek.com" /&gt; After avoiding a prison sentence for a second time, he left Germany and moved to Hong Kong in late 2003.&lt;ref name="investigate" /&gt;

=== Hong Kong ===
Dotcom found Hong Kong to his liking and registered Kimpire Limited in December 2003, soon after moving there. He set up a network of interlinked companies, including Trendax, which he said was an artificial intelligence-driven hedge fund that delivered an annual return of at least 25%.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Sean Gallagher, [https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/01/kim-dotcom/ The Fast, Fabulous, Allegedly Fraudulent Life of Megaupload’s Kim Dotcom] 26 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt; However, Trendax was never registered with [[Securities and Futures Commission|Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission]] and the company was legally not allowed to accept investments or to conduct trades.&lt;ref name="wired.com" /&gt; After moving to New Zealand, Dotcom was convicted for failing to disclose his shareholding to the Securities and Futures Commission, and was fined [[Hong Kong dollars|HK$]]8,000.&lt;ref name="smh.com.au" /&gt;

== Move to New Zealand ==
While living in Hong Kong, Dotcom visited New Zealand for 10 days in December 2008 and again for two months from August 2009. On his 2009 visit, he bought 12 cars, valued at $3.2 million, and leased a helicopter on a stand-by basis.&lt;ref name="stuff.co.nz"&gt;[http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/6547471/Secrecy-over-Dotcoms-residency-application Secrecy over Dotcom's residency application], ''The New Zealand Herald'', 9 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He applied for residency and received it in November 2010. [[Immigration New Zealand]] made its decision on his application (despite his foreign convictions and despite his ''[[persona non grata]]'' status in Thailand) after officials used a special direction to waive "good character" requirements. Warwick Tuck, head of Immigration New Zealand, said that New Zealand granted Dotcom residency under the "investor plus" category, which allows people to gain residency if they invest $10 million in New Zealand.&lt;ref name="3news.co.nz"&gt;[http://www.3news.co.nz/Megaupload-accused-Kim-Schmitz-in-court-helicopter-part-of-bail-debate/tabid/423/articleID/240281/Default.aspx Megaupload accused Kim Schmitz in court, helicopter part of bail debate], TV3 News 23 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt; It was anticipated that Dotcom would contribute to New Zealand through investment, consumption and philanthropic activities – he has given $50,000 to the mayoral fund following the [[2011 Christchurch earthquake|Christchurch earthquake]], another $50,000 to a rugby player who was left in a wheelchair after an on-field injury and funded a $600,000 fireworks display in Auckland harbour.&lt;ref name="stuff.co.nz" /&gt; Mr Tuck says Dotcom disclosed his previous convictions and these had been considered;&lt;ref name="3news.co.nz" /&gt; they occurred more than 16 years earlier and did not involve harming anyone. Dotcom also told Immigration New Zealand his convictions had been "erased" from his record under Germany's clean-slate legislation.&lt;ref name="nzherald.co.nz"&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10731751 Flamboyant former hacker to settle in NZ], ''The New Zealand Herald'', 12 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite granting him residency, Immigration New Zealand expressed concern that their decision might attract criticism that they had allowed Dotcom to buy his way into the country, and officials tried to keep it secret. Officials red-flagged his application: "We are requesting that this application be kept as confidential as possible to avoid further media speculation or attention."&lt;ref name="stuff.co.nz" /&gt; Dotcom's residency status subsequently became the subject of intense media speculation when it came to light that [[Mayor of Auckland City|Auckland Mayor]] [[John Banks (New Zealand politician)|John Banks]] had become involved, and that New Zealand's intelligence services had illegally spied on him (see [[Kim Dotcom#Political fallout from Dotcom's arrest|below]]) – which they were not allowed to do because he had residency. Immigration New Zealand officers judged Dotcom's convictions in Hong Kong too minor to consider deporting him.&lt;ref name="smh.com.au" /&gt;

In October 2014, it became public that on 10 September 2009, Dotcom had been caught driving at 149&amp;nbsp;km/h in a 50&amp;nbsp;km/h zone. He pleaded guilty to a charge of dangerous driving, and on 14 September 2009, was convicted under his former name of Kim Schmitz. The court fined him $500 and $130 court costs, and banned him from driving for six months. On his residency application of 3 June 2010, he answered "No" to the question, "Have you ... been ... convicted of an offence (including a traffic offence) committed in the last five years involving dangerous driving." Immigration New Zealand said it was looking into the matter, which raises the possibility that Dotcom could be deported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kim Dotcom didn't declare dangerous driving conviction |first=David |last=Fisher |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11350258 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |date=30 October 2014 |accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Involvement with Auckland mayor John Banks ===
[[John Banks (New Zealand politician)|John Banks]] met Dotcom when he was Mayor of Auckland. He asked Dotcom for help putting on a fireworks display in the city's harbour. Banks later attended a New Year's Eve party thrown by Dotcom at the city centre apartment of now bankrupt property developer [[David Henderson (Auckland, New Zealand)|David Henderson]]. He said it provided a great view of the fireworks display detonated over the [[Waitematā Harbour]]. Banks said he offered advice to the millionaire on how to apply for [[Overseas Investment Office]] permission to buy the Coatesville mansion Dotcom had been renting since coming to New Zealand.&lt;ref name="nzherald.co.nz" /&gt;

On 28 April 2012 Dotcom revealed he also donated $50,000 to John Banks' mayoralty campaign in 2010, and that Banks asked him to split the donation in two, allowing the Banks campaign to claim them as anonymous by falling within the anonymous limit of $25,000. In 2014, Banks was found guilty of [[John Banks (New Zealand politician)#False electoral return accusation|filing a false electoral return]], with evidence from Dotcom playing a major part in the case. This conviction was subsequently overturned on appeal following the discovery of new evidence, and a planned retrial was later cancelled and a verdict of acquittal entered. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11451091|title= John Banks cleared |publisher= NZHerald |date= 19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among Dotcom's revelations was a phone call from Banks, thanking him for the contribution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10834732 Act sticks by Banks – for now], ''The New Zealand Herald'', 18 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Dotcom subsequently recorded a song titled ''Amnesia'', which mocks John Banks' inability to remember the $50,000 donation.&lt;ref name="pop_airing" /&gt;

A poll in October 2012 found the New Zealand public had a more favourable view of Kim Dotcom than of Banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Kim-Dotcom-more-popular-than-John-Banks---poll/tabid/1607/articleID/272362/Default.aspx|title= Kim Dotcom more popular than John Banks – poll|publisher= 3 News NZ |date= 11 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2003, at the same time he registered Trendax, Dotcom set up another company called Data Protect Limited, but changed the name to [[Megaupload]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Megaupload was a [[file hosting service|file hosting]] and [[file sharing|sharing]] online service in which users could share links to files for viewing or editing. In ''10 Facts about the Megaupload Scandal'', Dotcom describes the company like this: "Megaupload is a provider of cloud storage services. The company's primary website, Megaupload.com, offered a popular Internet-based storage platform for customers, who ranged from large businesses to individuals. This storage platform allowed its users to store files in the Internet "cloud" and to use, if needed, online storage space and bandwidth." The company was successful. However, millions of people from across the globe used Megaupload to store and access copies of TV shows, feature films, songs, porn, and software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sandoval |first=Greg |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-31001_3-57362152-261/fbi-charges-megaupload-operators-with-piracy-crimes |title=FBI charges Megaupload operators with piracy crimes |publisher=CNET News |date=20 January 2012 |accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually it had over 150 employees, US$175 million revenues,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Anderson |first=Nate |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2012/01/google-cut-off-megauploads-ad-money-voluntarily-back-in-2007.ars |title=Google cut off Megaupload's ad money voluntarily back in 2007 |work=Ars Technica |date=20 January 2012 |accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 50 million daily visitors.&lt;ref name="indictment"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204616504577171180266957116 |title=Department of Justice indictment |work=The Wall Street Journal |accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its peak Megaupload was estimated to be the 13th most popular site on the Internet and responsible for 4% of all Internet traffic.&lt;ref name="indictment" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/adplanner/planning/site_profile#siteDetails?identifier=megaupload.com |publisher=Google.com |accessdate=20 January 2012|title=Google AdPlanner for megaupload.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dotcom's bank accounts were frozen denying him access to US$175m (NZ$218m) in cash, the contents of 64 bank accounts world-wide, including BNZ and Kiwibank accounts in New Zealand, Government bonds and money from numerous PayPal accounts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/6293542/Megaupload-attempting-to-get-back-online Megaload attempting to get back online], Stuff website 21 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Dotcom was [[Remand (detention)|remanded]] to [[Mt. Eden Prison|Mt Eden Prison]]. He subsequently reported: "The first night I didn't have a blanket, soap, toothpaste or toilet paper. They didn't provide us with the basic things... Every two hours, they would wake me up. I was deprived of sleep. I wrote a complaint. I said, 'This is torture, this is sleep deprivation'." He said he was treated like a convicted criminal and was "stunned to be locked up in prison over claims of criminal copyright infringements when accused murderers were bailed to await trial".&lt;ref name=will_beat&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10788982 Dotcom: I will beat charges], ''The New Zealand Herald'', 1 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 February, North Shore District Court Judge Nevin Dawson overturned previous rulings and released Dotcom on bail. The judge considered there was no longer a significant risk that Dotcom would flee the country as all of his assets had been seized by this time, no new assets or bank accounts had been identified, and he had "every reason to stay to be with his family and fight to keep his assets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-17122866|title=Megaupload founder Kim Dotcom granted bail|publisher=BBC News |date=22 February 2012|accessdate=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== High Court ===
On 28 June 2012, [[High Court of New Zealand]] Justice Helen Winkelmann found that the warrants used to seize Dotcom's property were illegal because they were too broad. "These categories of items were defined in such a way that they would inevitably capture within them both relevant and irrelevant material. The police acted on this authorization. The warrants could not authorize seizure of irrelevant material, and are therefore invalid."&lt;ref name="nzh20120628"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10816121 |title=Dotcom searches illegal: Judge |work=The New Zealand Herald |date=28 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; News emerged later that the Crown knew it was using the wrong order while the raid was in progress and Dotcom should have been given the chance to challenge the seizure.&lt;ref name="Dotcom wins major victory"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10816159|title=Dotcom wins major victory|work=The New Zealand Herald |date=29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Crown also revealed that police had handed seized hard drives to FBI staff who copied them at the police crime lab in South Auckland and sent the copies back to the US.&lt;ref name="Dotcom wins major victory" /&gt; Justice Winkelmann ruled that handing the hard drives seized in the raid to the FBI was in breach of extradition legislation and the FBI's cloning of the hard-drives was also invalid.&lt;ref name="nzh20120628" /&gt;

Declaring the search warrants to be invalid was a significant victory for Dotcom because he was struggling to pay his mounting legal bills. At a hearing in the High Court on 28 August 2012, Justice [[Judith Potter]] allowed Dotcom to withdraw approximately NZ$6 million (US$4.8 million) from his seized funds. He was also allowed to sell nine of his cars. The amount released was to cover $2.6 million in existing legal bills, $1 million in future costs, and another $1 million in rent on his New Zealand mansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Funds released for Dotcom's legal bills |url=http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/breaking-news/funds-released-for-dotcoms-legal-bills/story-e6frg13l-1226460951083 |date=28 June 2012 |accessdate=28 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031082209/http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/breaking-news/funds-released-for-dotcoms-legal-bills/story-e6frg13l-1226460951083 |archivedate=31 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Court of Appeal ===
In May 2012, a district court judge ruled that the FBI should hand over all its evidence against Dotcom relating to the extradition bid. The Crown appealed, but the ruling was upheld by the High Court. The Crown appealed again and in March 2013, the Court of Appeal quashed the previous court decisions. Crown lawyer John Pike, on behalf of the US Government, argued that the district court had no power to make disclosure decisions in an extradition case and that "disclosure was extensive and could involve billions of emails". The Court of Appeal agreed stating that extradition hearings were not trials and the full protections and procedures for criminal trials did not apply. Dotcom's lawyer, Paul Davison, QC, appealed to the Supreme Court. In May 2013, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, so it will make the final decision on whether Dotcom should receive all the FBI investigation files before the extradition hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10884084|title=Supreme Court allows appeal|work=The New Zealand Herald |date=16 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of subsequent court decisions delayed every attempt to hold a hearing focused on extradition. In March 2013, Dotcom won a Court of Appeal ruling allowing him to sue the [[GCSB]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Dotcom-wins-right-to-sue-Govt-spies/tabid/423/articleID/289342/Default.aspx|work=[[3 News NZ]] |title=Dotcom wins right to sue Govt spies|date=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10869764 |work=The New Zealand Herald |title=Dotcom wins right to sue|date=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; rejecting the attorney-general's appeal against a ruling in December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Crown-wants-GCSB-exluded-from-Dotcom-case/tabid/423/articleID/286755/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ |title=Crown wants GCSB exluded from Dotcom case|date=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/128063/judge-describes-dotcom-case-as-a-procedural-mess |work=[[Radio NZ]]|title=Judge describes Dotcom case as a procedural mess|date=14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, Dotcom appeared in court again, seeking compensation from police over the raid on his house, which earlier had been deemed illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Dotcom-back-in-court-to-sue-police/tabid/423/articleID/294275/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ |title=Dotcom back in court to sue police|date=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Confidential settlement with police ===
In November 2017, Dotcom and his former wife Mona accepted a confidential settlement from the police over the raid. The settlement came after a damages claim was filed with the High Court over the "unreasonable" use of force when the anti-terrorism Special Tactics Group raided his mansion in January 2012. Settlements have already been reached between police and Bram van der Kolk and Mathias Ortmann who were also arrested. The ''[[New Zealand Herald]]'' reported that their settlements were six-figure sums and "it is likely Dotcom would seek more as the main target in the raid". Commenting on the settlement, Dotcom said: "We were shocked at the uncharacteristic handling of my arrest for a non-violent Internet copyright infringement charge brought by the United States, which is not even a crime in New Zealand".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11940279 Dotcom wins settlement from police over the 2012 dawn raid which saw him arrested], ''[[New Zealand Herald]]'', 3 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Supreme Court ===
In February 2014, the [[New Zealand Court of Appeal]] deemed the raids on Kim Dotcom to be legal but not the FBI's taking of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/9739447/ |title=Dotcom raid legal, FBI taking evidence not |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dotcom appealed this decision to the Supreme Court. In December four of the five judges agreed with the Court of Appeal that the raid was legal and ordered Dotcom to pay $35,000 costs. Chief Justice Sian Elias dissented, saying there had been a miscarriage of justice as the search warrant was too broad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.3news.co.nz/nznews/court-rules-dotcom-mansion-raid-legal-2014122311#axzz3MkV2gbFR Court rules Dotcom mansion raid legal], TV3 News 23 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

A month before the Supreme Court decision, Dotcom's legal team quit after he had spent $10 million on his defence, financed the Internet Party, but then ran out of money. When the US tried to have his bail revoked, a new lawyer, Ron Mansfield, helped keep him out of prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuff.co.nz/technology/digital-living/63552244/dotcom-officially-broke-right-now.html Dotcom 'officially broke right now' video], Stuff 26 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2014, events took another turn when the High Court in Hong Kong ruled that the United States "did not have a clear path to serve a legal summons on Dotcom's filesharing company" and he could take a case to get back $60 million seized by authorities there. In making this decision, Judge Tallentire said, "No one can say when that process of extradition will be completed given the appeal paths open to the various accused. Indeed, no one can say if it will ever be completed".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11370807 Kim Dotcom's fight for Hong Kong millions], ''New Zealand Herald'', 8 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political fallout ===
After his arrest by the New Zealand police in January 2012, Dotcom had an ongoing dispute with Prime Minister [[John Key]] about when Key had first become aware of Dotcom. Dotcom argued that Key had been involved in a plan to allow him into New Zealand so that he could then be extradited to the US to face copyright charges. Key had consistently said he had never heard of Dotcom until the day before the New Zealand police raid on his mansion in Coatesville.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11324685 Kiwis' data lodged with NSA – Greenwald,] ''The New Zealand Herald'', 15 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Apology for illegal spying on Dotcom ====
On 24 September 2012, Mr Key revealed that, at the request of the police, the [[New Zealand Government Communications Security Bureau]] (GCSB) had spied on Dotcom, illegally helping police to locate him and monitor his communications in the weeks prior to the raid on his house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10836179|title=Dotcom: Illegal spying revealed|work=The New Zealand Herald |date=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GCSB are not allowed to spy on New Zealand citizens or permanent residents; Dotcom, though not a citizen, had been granted permanent residency. Three days later, the Prime Minister John Key apologized for the illegal spying. "I apologize to Mr Dotcom. I apologize to New Zealanders because every New Zealander… is entitled to be protected from the law when it comes to the GCSB Government Communications Security Bureau, and we failed to provide that appropriate protection for him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New Zealand Prime Minister John Key Apologizes To Kim Dotcom, Says Spying Was Illegal |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/27/new-zealand-prime-minister-illegally-spied-on-kim-dotcom_n_1919275.html |date=27 September 2012 |accessdate=27 September 2012 |work=Huffington Post |first=Dominique |last=Mosbergen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, Chief High Court judge Helen Winkelman ordered the GCSB to "confirm all entities" to which it gave information sourced through its illegal spying. This opened the door for Dotcom to sue for damages – against the spy agency and the police.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10852335 Dotcom can pursue case against police], GCSB, ''The New Zealand Herald''&lt;/ref&gt; The Crown appealed but in March 2013, the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court's decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10869764 |title=Dotcom wins right to sue |publisher=Nzherald.co.nz |date=2013-03-07 |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://media.nzherald.co.nz/webcontent/document/pdf/201310/KimDotCOm.pdf |work=The New Zealand Herald|title=Judgement of the court|date=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Media reaction ====
The mistakes by authorities attracted widespread media coverage and Key's handling of the affair was criticised by opposition parties in Parliament. Political commentator Bryce Edwards said the GCSB's involvement and the botched search warrants "turned the pursuit of (Dotcom) and the operations of our law-enforcement agencies into the stuff of farce". A ''[[Waikato Times]]'' editorial said that the announcement of the illegal spying "heightened suspicions that this country's relationship with the United States has become one of servility rather than friendship. ... It is preposterous to suggest Mr Dotcom threatens our national security. The Government's unquestioning readiness to co-operate with American authorities seriously corrodes our claims to be an independent state."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/opinion/news/article.cfm?c_id=466&amp;objectid=10836888 Political round-up: Growing anger over Dotcom fiasco], ''The New Zealand Herald'', 27 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Sunday Star-Times]]'' commentator Richard Boock compared the Dotcom saga to [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] and suggested it might eventually 'bring down' John Key.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/blogs/an-auckland-minute/7783889/Could-Dotcom-bring-down-Key Could Dotcom bring down Key?] Auckland Now, 9 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The story made headlines overseas, including in the ''Wall Street Journal'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443916104578021590722745574 |work=The Wall Street Journal|title=New Zealand Admits Error In Dotcom Investigation}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''New York Times'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/04/technology/megaupload-founder-goes-from-arrest-to-cult-hero.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |work=The New York Times |first=Jonathan |last=Hutchison |title=Megaupload Founder Goes From Arrest to Cult Hero |date=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Guardian'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/sep/27/new-zealand-apologises-kim-dotcom?INTCMP=SRCH |location=London |work=The Guardian |title=New Zealand PM apologises to Kim Dotcom over spying 'error' |date=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Hollywood Reporter''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/kim-dotcom-new-zealand-government-spying-373774 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |first=Pip |last=Bulbeck |title=New Zealand Government Admits to Spying Bungle in Kim Dotcom Extradition Case |date=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which specialises in legal and entertainment issues.&lt;ref&gt;John Key's Hollywood jaunt will be scrutinised, Dominion Post 1 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Internet Mana Party Tour 4 August 2014 03.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Dotcom at a political rally held by the Internet Party and Mana Movement]]

The deal was brokered to serve the Mana Party financially, with the combined structure's political campaign in the [[New Zealand general election, 2014|2014 general election]] being primarily funded by Dotcom. In contrast, the fledgling Internet Party was to benefit from the possibility of seats in parliament in the event that the combined structure were to achieve a greater percentage of the country's vote, helped along by the Mana Party's existing seat. Due to his citizenship status, Dotcom was ineligible to become a member of parliament,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/9600518/Dotcom-sets-sights-on-politics|title=Dotcom sets sights on politics|work=Stuff|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Laila Harré]], a veteran of left-wing politics and trade unions, was chosen as leader of the Internet Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Laila-Harre-to-lead-Internet-Party/tabid/1607/articleID/346312/Default.aspx|title=Laila Harre to lead Internet Party|publisher=|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Moment of Truth===
{{listen|filename=The Moment of Truth Press Conference.ogg|title=Kim Dotcom and others at a press conference after The Moment of Truth}}

On 16 September 2014, Dotcom held an event in the Auckland Town Hall five days before the election in which he promised to provide 'absolute proof' that Key knew about him long before he was arrested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11324988 Dotcom email is a fake – Warner Bros,]''The New Zealand Herald'', 16 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The event was billed as the 'Moment of Truth' and included the release of an email dated 27 October 2010 from Kevin Tsujihara, the chief executive of Warner Bros to a senior executive at the Motion Picture Association of America – the lobby group for the Hollywood studios. ''The New Zealand Herald'', which broke the story, contacted Warner Bros., who said the email was a fake.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11325021 Who is Kevin Tsujihara, the Hollywood exec in Dotcom's big reveal?] ''The New Zealand Herald'', 16 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[New Zealand general election, 2014|2014 general election]], the joint [[Internet Party and Mana Movement]] gained 1.42% of the nationwide party vote but failed to win any seats. Dotcom, who was not a candidate because he is not a New Zealand citizen,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-29268823 New Zealand's National Party wins re-election], BBC News 20 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; sank $NZ3.5 million dollars into the Internet Party, the largest personal contribution to a political party on record in New Zealand, according to the national Electoral Commission.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/19/world/asia/kim-dotcom-online-renegade-shakes-up-new-zealand-election.html Online Renegade, Wanted in U.S., Shakes Up New Zealand Election,] ''The New York Times'', 18 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; "I take full responsibility for this loss tonight," Dotcom told reporters as election results became clear, "because the brand—the brand Kim Dotcom—was poison for what we were trying to achieve".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/world/asia/new-zealands-ruling-national-party-is-re-elected.html New Zealand's Ruling National Party Is Re-elected,] ''The New York Times'', 20 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Serious Fraud Office (New Zealand)|Serious Fraud Office]] investigated the email and determined that it was a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Fisher |first=David |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11820379 |title=SFO: Kim Dotcom's smoking gun email evidence was a 'forgery' |date=17 March 2017 |work=The New Zealand Herald |accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The media criticised Dotcom for 'failing to deliver' at the Moment of Truth after saying for three years that he could prove John Key had lied in relation to his copyright case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11325351 Dotcom telling the truth over email – Harre], New Zealand Herald, 16 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/dotcom-fails-deliver-claim-key-knew-him-6082768 Dotcom fails to deliver on claim about when Key knew of him], TVOne News, 16 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; After the election, in which the Internet Mana alliance failed to win a seat, public support for Dotcom seemed to dissipate.

The party remained leaderless until 8 February 2017, when Suzie Dawson was appointed as its new leader for the [[New Zealand general election, 2017|2017 general election]].

==Extradition==
===District court===

After three years' legal wrangling, involving two supreme court cases and 10 separate delays in the proceedings, [[extradition]] proceedings finally got underway in an Auckland court on 21 September 2015.&lt;ref name=Guardian92115&gt;{{cite news|title=Kim Dotcom in court for US extradition hearing after three years of delays|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/21/kim-dotcom-in-court-for-us-extradition-hearing-after-three-years-of-delays|accessdate=21 September 2015|work=The Guardian|agency=Australian Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wrangling continued at the hearing with Dotcom and his colleagues saying that they were unable to present a proper defence because the US had threatened to seize any funds they try to spend on international experts in Internet copyright issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/286343/dotcom-lawyer-accuses-us-of-'secrecy-bordering-on-deceit' Dotcom lawyer accuses US of 'secrecy bordering on deceit]' Radio New Zealand.&lt;/ref&gt; Dotcom's American lawyer, Ira Rothken, said they would need about US$500,000 to get evidence from the appropriate experts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.nzherald.co.nz/technology/news/article.cfm?c_id=5&amp;objectid=11525855 Dotcom: $500K to fight extradition], NZ Herald&lt;/ref&gt; Harvard Law professor [[Lawrence Lessig]], an international expert in copyright and fair use, provided his written opinion for free. He said there were no legal grounds to extradite Dotcom and the allegations and evidence made public by the US Department of Justice "do not meet the requirements necessary to support a prima facie case that would be recognised by United States federal law".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=11514142 No grounds to extradite Kim Dotcom, says Harvard Law professor Lawrence Lessig], NZ Herald&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the hearing finally got under way, Crown prosecutor Christine Gordon, on behalf of the US Government, called it a "simple scheme of fraud".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=11538846 Kim Dotcom's lawyer: 'There's no crime against making money from a brilliant idea'], NZ Herald, 2 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Defence Lawyer Ron Mansfield's 300 page submission began with the argument that the case should be thrown out because the United States Supreme Court ruled in a parallel case in 1982 that copyright infringement was a civil matter and could not be prosecuted as criminal fraud.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11541364 Kanye, a Kardashian, the King and Dotcom], NZ Herald, 7 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The Crown also made numerous references to intercepted [[Skype]] conversations between Dotcom and his co-defendants. Christine Gordon said one message written by Dotcom, when translated from German, read: "At some point a judge will be convinced about how evil we are and then we are in trouble." Mr Mansfield said this sentence was used repeatedly by Ms Gordon during her submission "with the knowledge that it would make international media headlines".

On 23 December 2015, North Shore District Court Judge, Nevin Dawson, announced that Dotcom and the three other Megaupload co-founders were eligible for extradition. He said the US had a "large body of evidence" which supported a prima facie case.&lt;ref name="extraditionlose"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kim Dotcom loses extradition case|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/75407880/kim-dotcom-loses-extradition-case|accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An immediate appeal was lodged by Dotcom's lawyer.&lt;ref name="radionz.co.nz"&gt;[http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/292902/dotcom-case-'destined-for-supreme-court' Dotcom case 'destined for Supreme Court'], Radio NZ, 24 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="extraditionlose_herald"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kim Dotcom Loses Extradition Battle, Appeal Made|url=http://m.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11565399|accessdate=23 December 2015|publisher=NZ Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==== High Court ====
In February 2017, the [[High Court of New Zealand|New Zealand High Court]] upheld the earlier decision of the district court that Dotcom and his three co-accused could be extradited to the United States.  However, Justice Murray Gilbert accepted the argument made by Dotcom's legal team that he and his former Megaupload colleagues cannot be extradited because of copyright infringement. The judge said he made this decision because: "online communication of copyright protected works to the public is not a criminal offence in New Zealand". However, Justice Gilbert said there were "general criminal law fraud provisions" in New Zealand law which covered the actions of the accused and they could be extradited on that basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11804230 Kim Dotcom and co-accused eligible for extradition to US, says High Court],
 NZ Herald, 20 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Dotcom saw this decision as a major victory saying: "The major part of this litigation has been won by this judgement - that copyright is not extraditable." The ruling opened the door to further appeals because the warrant which was served on him when he was arrested on 20 January 2012, stated he was being charged specifically with "copyright" offences. Both sides are expected to challenge aspects of the ruling before the New Zealand Court of Appeal and eventually the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11804210 Kim Dotcom legal saga: Extradition to US over Megaupload still on cards but he claims court ruling is a 'major victory'], NZ Herald 20 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Court of Appeal ====

On 5 July 2018, the [[Court of Appeal of New Zealand|New Zealand Court of Appeal]] upheld the High Court's decision that Dotcom and the three co-accused could be extradited to the United States. In particular, the Court, disagreeing with Justice Gilbert, found that, even during the time of Megaupload's operations, it is a criminal offence in New Zealand to possess digital copyrighted works with an intention to disseminate them. Accordingly, Dotcom and his co-accused could be extradited on the basis of copyright infringement to stand trial in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court|litigants=Ortmann v United States of America|court=NZCA|opinion=233|date=5 July 2018|url=https://www.courtsofnz.govt.nz/cases/ortmann-ors-v-united-states-of-americe-anor/@@images/fileDecision}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dotcom's lawyer said that he would appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;

== Dotcom's perspective ==

=== On his early offending ===
In a lengthy article on [[TorrentFreak]], Dotcom said that he was not guilty of insider trading in Germany. He said the judge and prosecutor offered him a suspended sentence if he pleaded guilty. "I took the deal and moved on with my life instead of spending the next few years in court rooms defending my innocence."&lt;ref name="torrentfreak"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://torrentfreak.com/from-rogue-to-vogue-megaupload-and-kim-dotcom-111218/ |title=From Rogue To Vogue: Megaupload and Kim Dotcom. December 18, 2011 |publisher=Torrentfreak.com |date=18 December 2011 |accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on his business activities in Hong Kong, he said: "Hong Kong, what an awesome place to do business and to host my new phantom persona. I should write a book about doing business in Hong Kong, that's how good it is."

Dotcom also wrote: "I made mistakes when I was young and I paid the price. Steve Jobs was a hacker and Martha {{Sic||Stuart}} is doing well after her insider trading case. I think over a decade after all of this happened it should NOT be the dominating topic. I am 37 years old now, I am married, I have three adorable children with two more on the way (twin girls – yeah) and I know that I am not a bad person. I have grown and I have learned. Making this into an issue about my past is unfair to everyone else working at Mega. Our business is legitimate."&lt;ref name="torrentfreak" /&gt; "We have spent millions of dollars on legal advice over the last few years and our legal advisers have always told us that we are secure and that we are protected by the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]], which is a law in the US that is protecting online service providers of liability for the actions of their users."&lt;ref name=without_trial /&gt;

=== On Megaupload ===
In regard to Megaupload, Dotcom says he believes the company had actively tried to prevent copyright infringement – its terms of service forced users to agree they would not post copyrighted material to the website. Companies or individuals with concerns that their copyright material was being posted on Megaupload were given direct access to the website to delete infringing links. Megaupload also employed 20 staff dedicated to taking down material that might infringe copyright.&lt;ref name=will_beat /&gt; Dotcom also explained that Megaupload was responsible for the transfer of 800 files every second and that it would be impossible to police all that traffic. In addition, US privacy laws, such as [[Electronic Communication Privacy Act]], prohibit the administrators from looking into the accounts of the users.

On 1 March 2012, Dotcom gave his first interview to New Zealand media after his arrest to [[John Campbell (broadcaster)|John Campbell]] of [[Campbell Live]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Kim-Dotcoms-first-TV-interview-Im-no-piracy-king/tabid/817/articleID/244830/Default.aspx |title=Kim Dotcom's first interview after arrest |publisher=3news.co.nz |date=1 March 2012 |accessdate=1 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120729131119/http://www.3news.co.nz/Kim-Dotcoms-first-TV-interview-Im-no-piracy-king/tabid/817/articleID/244830/Default.aspx |archivedate=29 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He said the services offered by his Megaupload site were not significantly different from comparable services using cloud technology such as [[Rapidshare]] or [[YouTube]],&lt;ref name=without_trial /&gt; and he has just been used as a scapegoat because of his involvement with hacking activities in the past. He explained the close ties of his case to that of [[Viacom International Inc. v. YouTube, Inc.|Viacom vs YouTube]] in which the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA) shielded YouTube from the infringement of its users and described his surprise when he was arrested without trial or a hearing.&lt;ref name=without_trial&gt;{{cite web |last=Anderson |first=Nate |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2012/03/megaupload-got-a-death-sentence-without-trial-says-kim-dotcom-in-first-tv-interview.ars |title=Megaupload takedown a "death sentence without trial," says Kim Dotcom |publisher=Arstechnica.com |date=1 March 2012 |accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== On US involvement in his arrest ===
Dotcom says that he is a legitimate businessman who has been unfairly demonized by United States authorities and industry trade groups such as the [[RIAA]] and [[MPAA]].&lt;ref name="torrentfreak" /&gt; He blames former US President [[Barack Obama]] for colluding with Hollywood to orchestrate his arrest&lt;ref name="pop_airing" /&gt; and has spoken out against his negative portrayal in the media. In regard to the illegal spying conducted by GCSB, Dotcom said they were not spying to find out where he was. "The GCSB was utilised to surveil all my communication in order to give the U.S. Government full access to all my communication, without the requirement of a warrant," he said.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/politics/7802709/Dotcom-more-popular-than-Banks Dotcom more popular than Banks], ''The New Zealand Herald'', 11 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2013, Dotcom released a 39-page [[white paper]] that links his prosecution to Hollywood studios. He states that the US government prosecuted him in return for contributions from the studios to President [[Barack Obama]]. He released the paper to coincide with the visit to New Zealand of [[United States Attorney General]], [[Eric Holder]], head of the [[US Justice Department]], which oversees the FBI.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10882074 Key misled by US, claims Dotcom] ''The New Zealand Herald'', 8 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand Prime Minister John Key added to speculation about Hollywood's role in October 2012 when it was announced he was going on a four-day visit to meet top studio executives.&lt;ref name="nzherald-10837799"&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10837799 Key: LA visit about jobs], ''The New Zealand Herald'', 2 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Key said the trip was intended to promote New Zealand as a good country to produce movies, but he was planning to meet with the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA), which had described Dotcom as "a career criminal".&lt;ref name="nzherald-10837799" /&gt; Using [[Twitter]], Dotcom said that [[Chris Dodd]] was "responsible for the destruction of Megaupload &amp; the abuse of my family".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/KimDotcom/status/253587906604724224|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=27 August 2014|last1=Dotcom|first1=Kim|title=Kim Dotcom Status Update}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' senior journalist David Fisher published ''The Secret Life of Kim Dotcom: Spies, Lies and the War for the Internet.'' The book covers aspects of Dotcom's personal life and reveals that he fears for his life. He is quoted telling a friend "Don't just let it go", if he is killed as part of US allegations of copyright breaches associated with Megaupload.&lt;ref&gt;Inside Kim Dotcom's mind, ''The New Zealand Herald'', 22 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other activities ==
Following the [[11 September 2001 attacks]] in the United States, Dotcom launched a group called Young Intelligent Hackers Against Terrorism (YIHAT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/oct/29/mondaymediasection.afghanistan1|title=Can he save the world?|author=Angus Batey|date=29 October 2001|work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that he had hacked Sudanese bank accounts belonging to Osama Bin Laden and offered a $10 million reward for information leading to Osama's capture on his now-defunct kimble.org site.&lt;ref name="wired.com" /&gt;

Dotcom participated in a mock funeral procession for public broadcaster [[TVNZ 7]] in downtown Auckland, on the day of its final broadcast. He had warmed to one of its more notable shows, ''Media7'', for its championing of Internet freedom, and had been interviewed on the show at least once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/technology/7199883/Kim-Dotcom-joins-TVNZ7-funeral|author=Marika Hill|title=Kim Dotcom joins TVNZ7 funeral|date=30 June 2012|publisher=[[Fairfax NZ News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, [[Lindsey Stirling]] released Lord of The Rings Medley,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQiNVk_u0po|title=Lord of the Rings Medley – Lindsey Stirling|date=2 February 2012|work=YouTube|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a music video funded by Dotcom.

In August 2012, Dotcom released a song titled ''Party Amplifier'' as a sample of his upcoming album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/KimDotcom/status/239200605976031232|author=Kim Dotcom|title=Kim Dotcom's new album|date=24 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dotcom was already in the process of recording the album with friend and producer [[Printz Board]] (who wrote ''Yes We Can'' for [[Barack Obama's 2008 election campaign]]) when he was arrested. Printz and Dotcom recorded more than 20 songs at [[Neil Finn]]'s [[Roundhead Studios]] in [[Newton, Auckland]] – one of which is called ''Mr President'' – an electronica protest against Barack Obama, who Dotcom believes was involved in shutting down Megaupload.&lt;ref name=pop_airing&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10821092 Dotcom's pop protest gets its first airing], ''The New Zealand Herald'', 21 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, Dotcom announced on [[Twitter]] the launch of [[Megaupload#Megabox|Megabox]], a new music streaming service to rival [[Spotify]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.themusicnetwork.com/music-news/industry/2012/06/25/megaupload-founder-to-launch-streaming-service/| title=Megaupload founder to launch streaming serviceMegabox to launch on raid anniversary}}&lt;/ref&gt; He announced in October 2012 that Megabox would launch on 19 January 2013, the first anniversary of the closure of Megaupload and the raid on his Auckland property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Dotcom-to-launch-Megabox-on-raid-anniversary/tabid/412/articleID/274463/Default.aspx|title=Megabox to launch on raid anniversary|date=29 October 2012|publisher=3 News}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, later said that Megabox would be launched a few months after Mega.

On 2 November, Dotcom announced a new file storage service, similar to Megaupload, using the domain name me.ga. It was to be launched 19 January 2013, but the African state of [[Gabon]], which controls the .ga domain, cancelled the me.ga name on 6 November 2012. The site has since registered the names mega.co.nz and mega.net.nz. The new file hosting service offers file encryption to enhance user privacy and security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2223907/kim-dotcom-s-mega-gets-another-domain-name |title=Kim Dotcom's Mega gets another domain name |work=[[The Inquirer]] |date=2012-11-12 |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this encryption, Dotcom and mega.co.nz will not know of the content of the uploaded data, allowing for the claim of [[plausible deniability]] to be made should new charges arise. In January 2013, Dotcom offered a $13,500 reward to anyone able to defeat the site's security system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Russell |first=Jon |url=https://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/02/01/kim-dotcom-puts-up-13500-bounty-for-first-person-to-break-megas-security-system/ |title=Kim Dotcom Offers $13,500 Mega Security Hack Bounty |publisher=The Next Web|date=2013-02-01 |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dotcom has been involved in the local community in Auckland. In December 2012, he announced that he would be playing the part of Santa Claus in the play ''MegaChristmas'', run by Auckland's Basement Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Dotcom-to-star-in-MegaChristmas/tabid/418/articleID/279095/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ |title=Dotcom to star in MegaChristmas|date=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a local ceremony on the first of that month, he turned on the Franklin Road Christmas lights and delivered a speech before the display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Dotcom-dons-Santa-hat/tabid/420/articleID/278867/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ |title=Dotcom dons Santa hat|date=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 September 2013, Kim Dotcom stepped down as director of Mega,&lt;ref name="ceoworld magazine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ceoworld.biz/ceo/2013/09/04/kim-dotcom-has-stepped-down-as-director-of-mega-file-storage-startup|title=Kim Dotcom Has Stepped Down As Director Of Mega File-Storage Startup|author=CEOWORLD magazine|date=4 September 2013|accessdate=4 September 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911164825/http://ceoworld.biz/ceo/2013/09/04/kim-dotcom-has-stepped-down-as-director-of-mega-file-storage-startup|archivedate=11 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and announced he was working on a music streaming service called Baboom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Kim-Dotcom-reveals-music-service-Baboom/tabid/412/articleID/312467/Default.aspx |title=Kim Dotcom reveals music service 'Baboom', 3 News NZ |publisher=3news.co.nz |date= |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dotcom says it will be more advanced than Megabox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://torrentfreak.com/kim-dotcom-teases-new-music-service-baboom-130907 |title=Torrentfreak, Kim Dotcom Teases New Music Service...

On 10 September 2013, Dotcom announced that he would play 100 people in ''Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3'' at New Zealand's first Digital Entertainment Expo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameplanet.co.nz/videos/g523b8ad3ec94e/Kim-Dotcom-vs-100-at-DIGITAL-NATIONZ/ |title=Kim Dotcom vs 100 at DIGITAL NATIONZ |publisher=[[Gameplanet (New Zealand)]] |date=2013-09-20 |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; DIGITAL NATIONZ. The former world number one would play a mix of challengers from the audience who could win prizes for beating him, as well as play against celebrities for charities Y for Youth and [[Starship Hospital]].

On 25 December 2014, Dotcom helped stop&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/post-arcade/how-mega-founder-kim-dotcom-helped-stop-holiday-xbox-live-and-psn-ddos-attacks-by-appeasing-lizard-squad?__lsa=058b-167a|title=How Mega founder Kim Dotcom helped Xbox Live, PSN recover from Lizard Squad's attack|newspaper=Financial Post|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Christmas [[Denial-of-service attack|DDoS]] attacks on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network by giving [[Lizard Squad]] 3,000 $99 one year [[Mega (service)|MEGA]] accounts which would then be converted to lifetime accounts worth approximately $300,000.

On 22 May 2017, Dotcom posted a statement to his website saying to have information relevant to the investigation into the July 2016 [[Murder of Seth Rich|murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gizmodo.com/sean-hannity-tweets-out-ludicrous-seth-rich-conspiracy-1795481166|title=Sean Hannity Tweets Out Ludicrous Seth Rich Conspiracy From Kim Dotcom|newspaper=Gizmodo|access-date=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dotcom said that he had proof that Rich was the source of the [[2016 Democratic National Committee email leak]], and that he was willing to provide evidence if US [[special counsel]] [[Robert Mueller]] could guarantee his safe passage from New Zealand to the United States.

==Early life==
Gazzy Garcia was born August 17, 2000 in [[Miami|Miami, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/lil-pump-mn0003626782/biography|title=Lil Pump {{!}} Biography &amp; History {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/08/happy-birthday-lil-pump/|title=Happy Birthday, Lil Pump! - XXL|work=XXL Mag|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2018 interview with [[J. Cole]], he stated that both of his parents are from [[Colombia]] and that they divorced when he was six years old. He also mentions having an older half-brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Aron A. |title=J.

When he was thirteen years old, his cousin, Lil Ominous, introduced him to Omar Pineiro, better known as [[Smokepurpp]]; the two eventually became collaborators.

==Career==
===Career beginnings (2016)===
Lil Pump's rap career began when Smokepurpp produced a track and asked him to freestyle over it. The single produced was independently released in 2016 on the music streaming website [[SoundCloud]], as his debut single, "Lil Pump".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/look-at-me-the-noisy-soundcloud-revolution-changing-rap-w485101|title=Look At Me!: The Noisy, Blown-Out SoundCloud Revolution Redefining Rap|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=October 10, 2017|date=June 1, 2017|first=David|last=Turner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lil Pump quickly followed the song with singles "Elementary", "Ignorant", "Gang Shit", and "Drum$tick", each possessing over three million streams.&lt;ref name="soundcloud.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/wavey-hefner/tracks|title=Lil Pump's Soundcloud profile|publisher=SoundCloud|accessdate=November 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of his tracks on SoundCloud earned him recognition among the [[South Florida]] [[underground rap]] scene, in a style known as "[[SoundCloud rap]]".  He co-headlined the No Jumper tour in 2016, and also performed at the Rolling Loud Festival.&lt;ref name="HNHH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-lil-pump-news.31687.html?|title=Everything You Need To Know About Lil Pump|last=Schwartz|first=Danny|date=April 26, 2017|accessdate=July 15, 2017|publisher=[[HotNewHipHop]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="XXLChief"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2017/05/chief-keef-lil-pump-hit-the-studio/|title=Chief Keef and Lil Pump Hit the Studio|last=Berry|first=Peter A.|date=May 18, 2017|accessdate=July 15, 2017|publisher=[[XXL (magazine)|XXL Mag]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rising popularity and ''Lil Pump'' (2017)===
Lil Pump began 2017 by releasing the singles "D Rose" and "[[Boss (Lil Pump song)|Boss]]", which were major hits on SoundCloud, collecting a combined 70 million streams.&lt;ref name="soundcloud.com"/&gt; The popularity of "D Rose" led to a [[music video]] being produced by Chicago based director Cole Bennett, also known as Lyrical Lemonade.

== Archaeologists and treasure hunters ==
[[File:Spence with gold sword handle.jpg|right|thumb|[[E. Lee Spence]], noted pioneer underwater archaeologist, author, editor, and discoverer of the ''[[H. L. Hunley (submarine)|Hunley]]''.]]
:'''Marine archaeologists''' (also known as '''maritime archaeologists''') are persons working in the discipline of [[Marine Archaeology]] (also known as '''[[maritime archaeology]]''') and study human interaction with the [[sea]], lakes and rivers through the study of vessels, shore side facilities, cargoes, human remains and submerged landscapes. One speciality is [[underwater archaeology]], which studies the past through any submerged remains. Another specialty within maritime archaeology is [[nautical]] archaeology, which studies vessel construction and use.

:'''[[Treasure hunters]]''' sell the [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] (cannons, bottles, coins, specie, bullion - also known as '''treasure''') they find on [[shipwrecks]] and, when proficient at archaeology and working within the law, they are the capitalists of marine archaeology. Treasure hunters without proficiency in archaeology and salvaging historical artifacts without government permits are looters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shipwrecks.com/ethics_in_underwater_archaeology.htm Ethics in Underwater Archaeology (Capitalism versus Socialism in Underwater Archaeology) by E.

== Oceanographers ==
:'''[[Oceanography]]''' (from the [[Greek language|greek]] words ''Ωκεανός'' meaning [[Ocean]] and ''γράφω'' meaning to write), also called '''oceanology''' or '''marine science''', is the branch of [[Earth Sciences]] that studies the [[Earth]]'s [[ocean]]s and [[sea]]s. It covers a wide range of topics, including [[marine organism]]s and [[ecosystem]] dynamics; [[ocean currents]], [[Water waves|waves]], and geophysical fluid dynamics; [[plate tectonics]] and the geology of the sea floor; and [[flux]]es of various chemical substances and physical properties within the ocean and across its boundaries. These diverse topics reflect multiple disciplines that oceanographers blend to further knowledge of the world ocean and understanding of processes within it: [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[geology]], [[meteorology]], and [[physics]].

== [[Cave Diving|Cave Divers]] ([[Caver]]s and [[speleologist]]s) ==
:Cave diving is one of the most challenging and potentially dangerous kinds of diving and presents many [[Diving hazards and precautions|diving hazards]]. Cave diving is a form of [[penetration diving]], meaning that in an emergency a diver cannot ascend directly to the surface due to the cave's ceilings, and instead may have to swim horizontally. The underwater navigation through the cave system may be difficult and exit routes may be at considerable distance, requiring the diver to have sufficient [[breathing gas]] to make the journey, resulting  in potential [[deep diving]] risks.&lt;ref&gt;

== First Generation Diving Safety Officers ==

A [[Diving Safety Officer]] (DSO) is a person (typically a University Official) appointed by an institution's responsible administrative officer or designee.  He or she must be trained as a scientific diver, be a full member of the [[American Academy of Underwater Sciences]] and be an active underwater instructor from an internationally recognized certifying agency.  He or she is responsible, for the conduct of the scientific diving program of the institution, including the conduct of training and certification, approval of dive plans, maintenance of diving records, and ensuring compliance with all relevant
regulations.

This organizational structure goes back to the model developed at the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] in the early 1950s.  The model spread from there to the other campuses of the University of California, then to other California institutions and then nationwide. It served as the model accepted by the [[AAUS|American Academy of Underwater Sciences]] and OSHA.

Those individuals who were part of the first generation of Diving Officers often had the opportunity to participate in many different undersea exploration programs and made singular contributions to those programs as well as the world of diving and submersibles.

'''Mortimer Baidgent Devot''' writing as '''MB Devot'''  ( 10 April 1934 – 9 June 1987 &lt;ref name=Times&gt;''The Times'' 12 June 1987 "MB Devot"&lt;/ref&gt;) was an [[England|English]] author, [[physics|physicist]], amateur [[natural history|naturalist]] and [[Western esotericism|esotericist]]. During the 1960s and 70s his writing attempted to account for psychic phenomena as a result of  electromagnetic fields and acoustic effects acting on the human brain. In later life, he pursued a synthesis of his early theses and his newer interests in the seemingly diverse subjects of [[folklore]], [[natural history]], [[psychoacoustics]] and [[eternity|eternalism]].&lt;ref name=ForteanTimes53&gt;''Fortean Times'' #53 Autumn 1989 "MB Devot, A Life in the Hedgerow"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Manmohan Desai''' (26 February 1937 – 1 March 1994) was a [[movie producer|producer]] and [[movie director|director]] of [[Indian movie]]s

== Family background ==
Manmohan Desai was of [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] ancestry. His father, Kikubhai Desai,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1509216/ Kikubhai Desai]. IMDb&lt;/ref&gt; was an Indian film producer and owner of Paramount Studios (later Filmalaya)&lt;ref&gt;Tejaswini Ganti 2004, "Bollywood: A Guide to Popular Hindi Cinema", Routeledge Guidebooks, New York and London.&lt;/ref&gt; from 1931 to 1941. His productions, mainly stunt films, included ''Circus Queen'', ''Golden Gang'', and ''Sheikh Challi''.&lt;ref&gt;Connie Haham (2006) ''Enchantment of the Mind: Manmohan Desai's Films'', Roli Books, New Delhi, p 182.&lt;/ref&gt; Manmohan Desai's older brother, Subhash Desai, became a producer in the 1950s&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1194304/ Subhash Desai]. IMDb&lt;/ref&gt; and gave Manmohan his first break with the Hindi film ''[[Chhalia]]'' (1960). Subhash later went on to produce ''[[Bluff Master (film)|Bluff Master]]'', ''[[Dharam Veer (1977 film)|Dharam Veer]]'', and ''[[Desh Premee]]'' with Manmohan as the director.

His wife was Jeevanprabha Desai. She died in April 1979. He was engaged to actress [[Nanda (actress)|Nanda]] from 1992 until the time of his death in 1994. He had one son Ketan Desai who is still involved in the film industry. Ketan is married to Kanchan Kapoor, daughter of [[Shammi Kapoor]] and [[Geeta Bali]].

On 1 March 1994, per news Manmohan Desai fell from the balcony in [[Girgaon]] as the rail he was leaning on collapsed and died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bawa|first1=Jyoti Sharma|title=With Nanda's death, I have lost a very good friend: Actor Mala Sinha|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/with-nanda-s-death-i-have-lost-a-very-good-friend-mala-sinha/article1-1200215.aspx|publisher=Hindustan Times|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Very little is known about his death except that he was suffering from chronic back pain. Rumours of him committing suicide have not been confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mishra|first1=Rashmi|title=Accident, Suicide or Murder? The mysterious deaths in Bollywood|url=http://www.india.com/showbiz/accident-suicide-or-murder-the-mysterious-deaths-in-8179/|publisher=India.com|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Manmohan Desai was known for his family-centered, action-song-and-dance films which catered to the tastes of the Indian masses and through which he achieved great success. His movies defined a new genre called [[masala (film genre)|masala]] films. A common theme in his films were the lost and found plot where family members would be separated and reunited.

He had a string of hits with [[Amitabh Bachchan]] in the 70s and early 80s which helped cement Bachchan's status as a [[superstar]] of Indian cinema. He worked with Amitabh on ''[[Amar Akbar Anthony]]'', ''[[Parvarish (1977 film)|Parvarish]]'', ''[[Suhaag (1979 film)|Suhaag]]'', ''[[Naseeb (1981 film)|Naseeb]]'', ''[[Desh Premee]]'', ''[[Coolie (1983 Hindi film)|Coolie]]'', ''[[Mard (1985 film)|Mard]]'' and ''[[Ganga Jamuna Saraswati]]''; all but the last were box office successes. He was one of the directors who had a special working relationship with [[Amitabh Bachchan]], the others being [[Yash Chopra]], [[Prakash Mehra]], [[Ramesh Sippy]], and [[Hrishikesh Mukherjee]]. Of these, only [[Yash Chopra]] went on to make hits beyond the 1980s.

He often worked with the same actors in several different films:

*Jeetendra in ''Dharam Veer'' (1977) after ''Bhai Ho To Aisa''
*Shatrughan Sinha in ''Naseeb after ''Bhai Ho To Aisa'', ''Shararat'' and Aa Gale Lag Jaa (1973) and ''Rampur Ka Lakshman'' (1972)
*Shashi Kapoor in ''Suhaag'' after ''Aa Gale Lag Jaa'' (1973)
*Shammi Kapoor in ''Parvarish'' (1977) as a father figure after ''Bluffmaster'' (1963)
*Randhir Kapoor in ''Chacha Bhatija'' (1977) after ''Rampur Ka Lakshman'' (1972).

Apart from Bachchan, Manmohan Desai worked with such leading male stars as [[Raj Kapoor]] in the 1960 film ''[[Chhalia]]'', [[Shammi Kapoor]] in "[[Bluffmaster]]" (1963), [[Rajesh Khanna]] in ''[[Sachaa Jhutha]]'' (1970) and ''[[Roti]]'' (1974), [[Randhir Kapoor]] in ''[[Raampur Ka Lakshman]]'' (1972), [[Shashi Kapoor]] in ''[[Aa Gale Lag Jaa (1973 film)|Aa Gale Lag Jaa]]'', [[Dharmendra]] in ''[[Dharam Veer (1977 film)|Dharam Veer]]'' (1977). 1977 was an exceptional year for him. All four of his films released that year were huge hits: ''[[Parvarish (1977 film)|Parvarish]]'', ''[[Amar Akbar Anthony]]'', ''[[Chacha Bhatija]]'' and ''[[Dharam Veer (1977 film)|Dharam Veer]]''. The first two were with Amitabh, and the latter two were with [[Dharmendra]].

Manmohan Desai worked with writers such as [[Salim-Javed]], [[Prayag Raaj]], [[K.K.Shukla]], and [[Kader Khan]], and lyricists such as [[Anand Bakshi]], [[Sahir Ludhianvi]], [[Qamar Jalalabadi]], [[Gulshan Bawra]], and Shailendra. Early in his career he worked with composers Rahul Dev Burman, [[Kalyanji Anandji]], later with [[Laxmikant Pyarelal]] and in the 1980s with music composer [[Anu Malik]].

Out of the 20 films that Desai directed in his career span of 29 years (1960–1989), as many as 13 films were stupendous hits. His success ratio was 65 percent in an industry where flops abound. His favourite playback singer was Mohd Rafi. In most of his movie, Mohd Rafi was used to sing all of his songs. When Kishore Kumar's voice was frequently used on Amitabh Bachchan by other Directors, he used Mohd Rafi's voice on Amitabh Bachcan in films like Suhaag and Naseeb. His biggest hits of Mohd Rafi song was Pardah Hai Pardah from Amar Akbar Anthony and John Jani Janardhan from Naseeb. Manmohan Desai once said that Mohd Rafi's voice is God's voice.

Towards the end of his career, Desai's previously successful stories and style began to lose favour with audiences. Critics accused him of self-parody. His last film as a director ''[[Ganga Jamuna Saraswati]]'' and the films he produced with his son Ketan Desai directing, ''[[Allah Rakha (film)|Allah Rakha]]'' (1986), ''[[Toofan (1989 film)|Toofan]]'' (1989) and ''[[Anmol]]'' (1993) failed at the box office.

'''Manoah''' ({{Lang-he-n|מָנ֫וֹחַ}} ''Mānoaḥ'') is a figure from the [[Book of Judges]] 13:1-23 and 14:2-4 of the [[Hebrew Bible]]. His name means "rest" or "quiet".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keyway.ca/htm2001/20010506.htm Manoah by Wayne Blank]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family ==
According to the Bible, Manoah was of the [[tribe of Dan]] and lived in the city of [[Zorah]]. He married [[Wife of Manoah|one woman]], who was barren. Her name is not mentioned in the Bible, but according to tradition she was called [[Hazelelponi|Hazelelponi or Zʻllpunith]].&lt;ref&gt;''Babylonian Talmud: Tractate Bava Batra [http://www.halakhah.com/bababathra/bababathra_91.html Folio 91]''.&lt;/ref&gt; She was a daughter of Etam and sister of Ishma.

Manoah and [[Wife of Manoah|his wife]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wordlibrary.co.uk/article.php?id=172 Manoah's wife]&lt;/ref&gt; were the parents of famous judge [[Samson]]. According to Rabbinic tradition, they also had a daughter called Nishyan or Nashyan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13071-samson Samson, Jewish Encyclopedia.] "The mother of Samson [was named] Zlelponith, and his sister, Nashyan."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Porter, J. R. (2000). ''The Illustrated Guide to the Bible''. New York: Barnes &amp; Noble Books. p. 75. {{ISBN|0-7607-2278-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Birth of Samson ==
Manoah and his wife were childless, but an [[angel of the Lord]] appeared to Manoah’s wife and told her that she would give birth to a son. The child was to be dedicated from the womb as a [[Nazirite]], which entailed restrictions on his diet, which the angel spelled out in detail. The woman (whose name is not mentioned in the Bible) told her husband, "A man of God came to me". Manoah prayed and the angel returned to instruct the both of them. After the angel left, Manoah tells his wife, "We shall surely die, because we have seen God."&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref||Judges|13:22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with his wife, Manoah subsequently tried to dissuade Samson from marrying a [[Philistines|Philistine]] woman, but traveled with him to [[Timnah]] for the wedding ceremony when they were unable to do so.

Samson's birth has special importance for some Christians (primarily [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Catholics]]), because of its similarity to the [[Annunciation]] to the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]].

After Samson's death, his family recovers his body and buries him near the tomb of Manoah.

== In culture ==
*In 1914 American film ''[[Samson (1914 film)|Samson]]'', Manoah was played by [[George Periolat]], while his wife was played by [[Lule Warrenton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0004558|title=Samson}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the 1949 film ''[[Samson and Delilah (1949 film)|Samson and Delilah]]'' (starring [[Victor Mature]] and [[Hedy Lamarr]]), Manoah is played by Charles Evans in an uncredited appearance.
*In 1996 film ''[[Samson and Delilah (1996 film)|Samson and Delilah]]'', Manoah, played by [[Paul Freeman (actor)|Paul Freeman]], is shown as a poor old man. His wife is called [[Mara (name)|Mara]] in this film.
*In the 2018 film ''[[Samson (2018 film)|Samson]]'', Manoah is played by [[Rutger Hauer]] and his wife (called Zealphonis) is played by [[Lindsay Wagner]].

== Early life ==
Johnson was born Malcolm Michaels Jr. on August 24, 1945 in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]]. She had six siblings and her father, Malcolm Michaels Sr., was an [[assembly line]] worker at [[General Motors]] while her mother, Alberta Claiborne, was a housekeeper. Johnson attended an [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]] as a child and was a devout Christian throughout her life, often taking an interest in Catholicism and other faiths.{{sfn|Chan|2018}} Johnson first began wearing dresses at the age of five but stopped temporarily because she would get harassed by boys who lived near her house. In a 1992 interview, she described being the young victim of [[sexual assault]] by [[Adolescent sexuality|an adolescent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kasino|2012}}: events occur at 4:21 and 4:41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chan|2018}}: "Later, Johnson said in an interview toward the end of her life, she was sexually assaulted by another boy, who was around 13."&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson's mother told her that being homosexual is like being "lower than a dog",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kasino|2012}}: event occurs at 46:52.&lt;/ref&gt; but Johnson said that her mother was unaware of the [[LGBT community]]. After Johnson graduated from the former Edison High School (now the [[Thomas A. Edison Career and Technical Academy]]) in Elizabeth in 1963, she left her home for New York City with $15 and a bag of clothes.{{sfn|Chan|2018}} She [[Waiting staff|waited on tables]] after moving to [[Greenwich Village]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kasino|2012}}: event occurs at 47:22.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Carter|2010}}

== Performance work and identity ==
Johnson initially called herself "Black Marsha" but later decided on "Marsha P. Johnson" as her drag queen name, getting ''Johnson'' from the restaurant [[Howard Johnson's]] on [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]]. She said that the ''P'' stood for "pay it no mind"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kasino|2012}}: event occurs at 37:22; {{harvnb|Carter|2010}}: "In the early days she tended to go out mainly in semidrag and call herself Black Marsha. (When she later dropped the ''Black'' and started calling herself Marsha P. Johnson, she explained that the ''P.'' stood for 'Pay it no mind.')"&lt;/ref&gt; and used the phrase sarcastically when questioned about her gender, saying "it stands for pay it no mind".&lt;ref name = "wow"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://worldofwonder.net/comingattractions-death-life-marsha-p-johnson/ |title=#LGBTQ: Doc Film, "The Death &amp; Life of Marsha P.

According to [[Susan Stryker]], a professor of human gender and sexuality studies at the University of Arizona, Johnson's gender expression may be called ''[[gender variance|gender non-conforming]]'' in absence of Johnson's use of ''transgender'', which was not used broadly during her lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chan|2018}}: "Many transgender people have also come to hail Johnson, and her longtime friend and colleague Sylvia Rivera, as pioneering heroes. (The term transgender was not in wide use in Johnson’s lifetime; she usually used female pronouns for herself, but also referred to herself as gay, as a transvestite or simply as a queen.) 'Marsha P. Johnson could be perceived as the most marginalized of people — black, queer, gender-nonconforming, poor,' said Susan Stryker …"&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson said her style of [[Drag (clothing)|drag]] was not serious (or "high drag") because she could not afford to purchase clothing from expensive stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kasino|2012}}: event occurs at 10:11.&lt;/ref&gt; She received leftover flowers after sleeping under tables used for sorting flowers in the Flower District of Manhattan, and was known for placing flowers in her hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kasino|2012}}: event occurs at 8:42.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson was tall, slender and often dressed in flowing robes and shiny dresses, red plastic high heels, and bright wigs, which tended to draw attention.{{sfn|Chan|2018}}

==Stonewall uprising and other activism==
Johnson said she was one of the first drag queens to go to the [[Stonewall Inn]], after they began allowing women and drag queens inside; it was previously a bar for only gay men.&lt;ref name=MarshaInterview/&gt; On the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, the [[Stonewall Riots|Stonewall uprising]] occurred. While the first two nights of rioting were the most intense, the clashes with police would result in a series of spontaneous demonstrations and marches through the gay neighborhoods of Greenwich Village for roughly a week afterwards.&lt;ref name=CarterWholeBook&gt;{{cite book|last=Carter|first=David|title=Stonewall: The Riots that Sparked the Gay Revolution|year=2004|publisher=St. Martin's|isbn=0-312-20025-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Johnson has been named, along with Zazu Nova and Jackie Hormona, by a number of the Stonewall veterans interviewed by David Carter in his book, ''Stonewall: The Riots That Sparked the Gay Revolution'', as being "three individuals known to have been in the vanguard" of the pushback against the police at the uprising.&lt;ref name=CarterWholeBook/&gt;&lt;ref name="feinberg1996" /&gt; Johnson denied she had started the uprising, stating in 1987 that she had arrived at around "2:00 [that morning]", and that "the riots had already started" when she arrived and that the Stonewall building "was on fire" after cops set it on fire.&lt;ref name=MarshaInterview&gt;{{cite web |url=http://makinggayhistory.com/podcast/episode-11-johnson-wicker/ |title=Making Gay History: Episode 11 - Johnson &amp; Wicker |date=1987 |accessdate=July 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The riots reportedly started at around 1:20 that morning after [[Stormé DeLarverie]] fought back against the police officer who attempted to arrest her that night.&lt;ref name=CarterWholeBook/&gt; 

Carter writes that Robin Souza had reported that fellow Stonewall veterans and gay activists such as Morty Manford and [[Marty Robinson (gay activist)|Marty Robinson]] had told Souza that on the first night, Johnson "threw a [[shot glass]] at a mirror in the torched bar screaming, 'I got my civil rights'".&lt;ref name=CarterWholeBook/&gt; Souza told the Gay Activists Alliance shortly afterwards that it "was the shot glass that was heard around the world".&lt;ref name=CarterWholeBook/&gt; Carter, however, concluded that Robinson had given several different accounts of the night and in none of the accounts were Johnson's name brought up, possibly in fear that if he publicly credited the uprising to Johnson due to her well-known mental state and gender nonconforming, then Stonewall, and indirectly the gay liberation movement, "could have been used effectively by the movement's opponents".&lt;ref name=CarterWholeBook/&gt; The alleged "shot glass" incident has also been heavily disputed.&lt;ref name=investigation /&gt; Prior to Carter's book, it was claimed Johnson had "thrown a brick" at a police officer, an account that was never verified. However, many have corroborated that on the second night, Johnson climbed up a lamppost and dropped a bag with a brick in it down on a cop car, shattering the windshield.&lt;ref name=CarterWholeBook/&gt;

Following the Stonewall uprising, Johnson joined the [[Gay Liberation Front]] and participated in the first Christopher Street Liberation Pride rally on the first anniversary of the Stonewall rebellion in June 1970. One of Johnson's most notable [[direct action]]s occurred in August 1970 when she and fellow GLF members staged a sit-in protest at Weinstein Hall at [[New York University]] after administrators canceled a dance when they found out was sponsored by gay organizations.&lt;ref name="LavenderRed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.workers.org/2006/us/lavender-red-73/|title=Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries|website=www.workers.org|accessdate=July 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after that, she and close friend [[Sylvia Rivera]] co-founded the [[Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries]] (STAR) organization (initially titled ''Street Transvestites Actual Revolutionaries''). The two of them became a visible presence at [[Gay liberation|gay liberation marches]] and other [[Direct action|radical political actions]].{{sfn|Kasino|2012}} In 1973, Johnson and Rivera were banned from participating in the gay pride parade by the gay and lesbian committee who were administering the event stating they "weren't gonna allow drag queens" at their marches claiming they were "giving them a bad name".{{sfn|Kasino|2012}} Their response was to march defiantly ahead of the parade.&lt;ref&gt;Wicker, Randy (2014) "Marsha P Johnson Carols for Ma &amp; Pa Xmas Presents" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SDEcv6QtCI&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kasino|2012}} During a gay rights rally at New York City Hall in the early '70s, photographed by [[Diana Davies (photographer)|Diana Davies]], a reporter asked Johnson why the group was demonstrating, Johnson shouted into the microphone, "Darling, I want my gay rights now!"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kasino|2012}}: event occurs at 17:20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DaviesCityHall&gt;{{cite web |url=https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47e3-57a1-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99 |title=Gay rights activists Sylvia Ray Rivera, Marsha P.

During another incident around this time, which landed Johnson in court, she was confronted by police officers for hustling in New York, and when they went to apprehend her, she hit them with her handbag, which contained two bricks. When Johnson was asked by the judge why she was hustling, Johnson explained she was trying to secure enough money for her husband's tombstone. During a time when [[History of same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage was illegal in the United States]], the judge asked her what "happened to this alleged husband", Johnson responded, "[[New York City Police Department|Pigs]] killed him".&lt;ref name=LeeStone&gt;{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3VfKzfHUME |title=MARSHA P JOHNSON "PIGS KILLED MY HUSBAND" |accessdate=July 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially sentenced to 90 days in prison for the assault, Johnson's lawyer eventually convinced the judge to send her to [[Bellevue Hospital Center|Bellevue]] instead.&lt;ref name=LeeStone/&gt;

With Rivera, Johnson established the [[Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries|STAR House]], a shelter for gay and trans street kids in 1972, and paid the rent for it with money they made themselves as sex workers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Rapping With a Street Transvestite Revolutionary" in Out of the closets : voices of gay liberation. Douglas, c1972&lt;/ref&gt; While the House was not focused on performance, Marsha was a "[[Ball_culture#Houses|drag mother]]" of STAR House, in the longstanding tradition of chosen family in the Black and Latino LGBT community.  Johnson worked to provide food, clothing, emotional support and a sense of family for the young drag queens, [[Trans woman|trans women]], [[Gender variance|gender nonconformists]] and other gay street kids living on the [[Christopher Street]] docks or in their house on the [[Lower East Side]] of New York.&lt;ref name="zagria"&gt;[http://zagria.blogspot.com/2009/05/marsha-p-johnson-1944-1992-activist.html "Marsha P.

In the 1980s Johnson continued her street activism as a respected organizer and marshal with [[ACT UP]]. In 1992, when [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]]'s Stonewall memorial was moved to Christopher Street from Ohio to recognize the gay liberation movement, Johnson commented, "How many people have died for these two little statues to be put in the park to recognize gay people? How many years does it take for people to see that we're all brothers and sisters and human beings in the human race? I mean how many years does it take for people to see that we're all in this rat race together."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kasino|2012}}: event occurs at 41:06&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mental health and death ==
By 1966, Johnson lived on the streets&lt;ref name=pioneer/&gt;&lt;!--"When I first met Marsha in the early 70s, Marsha was homeless." – 7:52 --&gt; and engaged in [[survival sex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kasino|2012}}: event occurs at 17:34.&lt;/ref&gt; In connection with her sex work, Johnson was arrested many times—by her count, over 100—and was also [[Gunshot wound|shot]] once, in the late-1970s.{{sfn|Chan|2018}} Johnson spoke of first having a mental breakdown in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kasino|2012}}: event occurs at 20:12.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bob Kohler, Johnson would walk naked up Christopher Street and be taken away for two or three months to be treated with [[chlorpromazine]], an antipsychotic medication. Upon returning, the medication would wear off over the course of one month and she would then return to normal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kasino|2012}}: event occurs at 19:42.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1980 and her death in 1992, Johnson lived with her friend [[Randy Wicker]], who invited her to stay the night one time when it was "very cold out—about 10 degrees [Fahrenheit]" ({{convert|10|F|C|disp=out}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kasino|2012}}: event occurs at 9:40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though generally regarded as "generous and warmhearted" under her Marsha persona, Johnson's dark side sometimes emerged under Johnson's "male persona as Malcolm",&lt;ref name=Carter66&gt;{{cite book|last=Carter|first=David|title=Stonewall: The Riots that Sparked the Gay Revolution|year=2004|publisher=St. Martin's|pp=66|isbn=0-312-20025-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; often resulting in Johnson being hospitalized and sedated.&lt;ref name=CarterWholeBook/&gt; During those moments when Johnson's violent side emerged, according to an acquaintance Robert Heide, Johnson could be aggressive and short-tempered and speak in a deeper voice and, as Malcolm, would "become a very nasty, vicious man, looking for fights".&lt;ref name=Carter66/&gt; This dual personality of Johnson's has been described as "a schizophrenic personality at work".&lt;ref name=CarterWholeBook/&gt; It had been this reason that gay activists had been reluctant at first to credit Johnson for helping to spark the gay liberation movement of the early 1970s due to her mental state.&lt;ref name=CarterWholeBook/&gt; A 1979 [[Village Voice]] article titled "The Drag of Politics" by Steven Watson reported that Johnson's saintly personality was "volatile" and listed a roster of gay bars from which she had been banned.&lt;ref name=CarterWholeBook/&gt;&lt;!-- On April 17, 1987, Johnson was sent to the mental ward of [[St. Mary's Hospital (Passaic)|St. Mary's Hospital]] after falsely pulling the fire alarm and vandalizing Wicker's apartment building in Hoboken, claiming that "God told [her] to do it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/randywicker/14154535067/in/album-72157625873936233/ |title=Randy Wicker talks of Marsha's incident and arrest |accessdate=July 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; – not a reliable source --&gt; At the time of her death in 1992, Johnson was said to be increasingly sick and in a fragile state, according to Wicker.&lt;ref name="Kasino2012_sick"&gt;{{harvnb|Kasino|2012}}: event occurs at 51:20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several people came forward to say they had seen Johnson harassed by a group of "thugs" who had also robbed people.&lt;ref name=Toney92/&gt;&lt;ref name=PeoplesMemorialWholeVideo/&gt; According to Wicker, a witness saw a neighborhood resident fighting with Johnson on July 4, 1992.

The witness was not successful in relaying this information to the police.&lt;ref name=investigation /&gt; Other locals stated later that law enforcement was not interested in investigating Johnson's death, stating that the case was about a "gay black man" and wanting little to do with at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kasino|2012}}: event occurs at 51:50.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson was [[Cremation|cremated]] and her ashes were released over the river by her friends following a funeral at the local church.

According to Buddhist texts, [[Gautama Buddha]] possessed several superhuman powers and abilities; however, due to an understanding of the workings of the skeptical mind and how the display of [[miracle]]s can be abused by unscrupulous people, he reportedly responded to a request for miracles by saying, "...I dislike, reject and despise them,"&lt;ref&gt;The Long Discourses of the Buddha, A Translation of the Dīgha Níkāya by Maurice Walshe, Wisdom Publication, Boston 1995, p. 176 {{full|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and refused to comply.

==Miraculous birth==
{{Main|Gautama Buddha#Conception and birth|Miraculous births}}
[[File:The infant Buddha taking the Seven Steps.jpg|thumb|The infant Buddha taking the Seven Steps. [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of [[Gandhara]].]]
It is said that immediately after his birth, he stood up, took seven steps north, and uttered:&lt;ref name="buddhanet"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Life of the Buddha: The Birth of the Prince|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/buddhism/lifebuddha/2lbud.htm|publisher=BuddhaNet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I am chief of the world,&lt;br /&gt;
Eldest am I in the world,&lt;br /&gt;
Foremost am I in the world.&lt;br /&gt;
This is the last birth.&lt;br /&gt;
There is now no more coming to be."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Furthermore, every place the baby Buddha placed his foot, a [[lotus (genus)|lotus]] flower bloomed.&lt;ref name="buddhanet"/&gt;  There is a claim that the Buddha's birth was miraculous via his mother's dream of a white elephant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Buddha: Story &amp; Teachings|url=https://www.pbs.org/thebuddha/birth-and-youth/|publisher=[[PBS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This does not mean that the Buddha had a virgin birth like the Christian gospels of the birth of Jesus Christ. Buddha's mother was not a virgin, but Buddha was the product of a miraculous conception and a miraculous birth. The [[Mahāvastu]] and [[Lalitavistara Sūtra|Lalitavistara]] explicitly state that no carnal act took place for Buddha's conception; the [[Buddhacarita]] is ambiguous. Buddha did also have a miraculous birth. He was born out of the side of his mother.

In the Mahapadana-sutra, Digha ii. 12, is the description of the incarnation of the [[Vipassī Buddha]].
"Now Vipassi, brethren, when, as Bodhisat, he ceased to belong to the hosts of the heaven of Delight, descended into his mother’s womb mindful and self-possessed."

==Other miracles==
Other miracles and powers that [[Gautama Buddha]] was said to have possessed and exercised include the six higher knowledges ([[Abhijna]]): [[Iddhi]], [[telepathy]], [[Clairaudience|super-hearing]], [[third eye|divine seeing]], and [[Akashic records|seeing past lives]]. These are described in the ''Mahasihanada Sutta'' and other [[Sūtra|sutta]]s in the [[Pali canon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.012.ntbb.html Maha-sihanada Sutta]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Twin Miracle]] at [[Sravasti]] is also considered as the Buddhist miracle par excellence.&lt;ref name="Strong"&gt;Relics of the Buddha, John Strong, Motilal Banarsidass Publisher, 2007 [https://books.google.com/books?id=xqAB6PKyP98C&amp;pg=PA177 p.177]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Oulad Tidrarin''' ({{lang-ar|أولأد تيدرارين}}) is a [[Sahrawi people|Sahrawi]] [[tribe]] of [[Arab]] origins, formerly considered to be of [[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]] status. They speak [[Hassaniya]] [[Arabic Language|Arabic]]. They are [[Islam|Muslims]], belonging to the [[Maliki]] school of [[Sunni]] [[Islam]]. They live mainly in Western Sahara but also in Morocco and Mauritania.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MdaAdBC-_S4C&amp;pg=PA473&amp;dq=Oulad+Tidrarin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjRp_SxtMrbAhUJKMAKHYQeAAIQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Oulad%20Tidrarin&amp;f=false|title=The Peoples of Africa: An Ethnohistorical Dictionary|last=Olson|first=James Stuart|date=1996|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=|isbn=9780313279188|location=|pages=473|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The Oulad Tidrarin is one of the oldest [[Arab]] tribes that settled the [[Saguia el-Hamra]] and [[Río de Oro]] areas of Northwest Africa, their original home. Many live in the [[Cape Bojador]] and the coastline of the south of [[Morocco]], some on the coast of [[Saguia el-Hamra]] and some branches live in the south and east of [[Mauritania]]. There are some members of the Uladsliman and Lidadsa in subgroups in [[Mali]].

The name Tidrarin is [[Berber languages|Berber]] and means 'small mouintains'. It is the [[diminutive]] form of ''idrarin''. i.e. 'mountains'.

==Religious activism==
The tribe has established centres for the spread of [[Islamic culture]], particularly along the Atlantic coast region. They have received recognition from the Moroccan sultans for their work in this area.

==Clan subdivisions==
Oulad Tidrarin can be divided into eleven clans and twenty-three subclans. The clans are:

1. Almkalcha (Lamghalcha)
:They consist of five subclans:
:* Ahl Hajj
:* Asnubat
:* Lamnabha
:* Ahl Ahmed Msska
:* Sawalih

2. Oulad Sidiasin Ben Aalilaassam &lt;!-- article [[OULAD Sidiasin Ben Aalilaassam]] was nominated for speedy deletion; opted to redirect here instead of allowing it to be deleted --&gt;
:They consist of three subclans:
:* Oulad Sliman
:* Da'anin
:* Ahl Abrehmat

3. Lidadssa (Alidadsa) &lt;br&gt;
4. Alabobat (Laaboubat)&lt;br&gt; &lt;!-- article [[Alabobat]] was nominated for speedy deletion; opted to redirect here instead of allowing it to be deleted --&gt;
5. Oulad Sidahmad Boghanbur (Oulad Boughanbour) &lt;!-- article [[OULAD Sidahmad Boghanbur: (oulad Boughanbour)]] was nominated for speedy deletion; opted to redirect here instead of allowing it to be deleted --&gt;
: This clan consists of six subclans:
:* Lafaaris
:* Oulad Yassin
:* Oulad Abdallah (Oulad Moussa, Oulad Boucheguer)
:* Oulad Ismail
:* Oulad Abderrahman (Ahlsteilah and Arhailat)
:* Ahl Talbaali
6. Al Husinat (Lahssinat) &lt;br&gt;
7. Oulad Ali (Al Alaouiin the brave clan in the tribe) &lt;br&gt;
8. Lahmaidat&lt;br&gt;
9. Ahl Yara &lt;br&gt;
10. Oulad Bousshab &lt;br&gt;
11. Oulad El Ghazi

All of these tribes gathered in Uladtidrrarin flying are attributed to the Ansar;furthermore,they belong to the main tribe of Azd which contains many tribes ,likewise tribe of chuhuh in UAE

The majority adheres to certified documents to prove their Ansar parentage. Some of the documents are stored in patches of skin and some in patches of old paper.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20814">'''Pangool''' (in [[Serer language|Serer]] and [[Cangin languages|Cangin]]) singular: '''Fangool''' (var : ''Pangol'' and ''Fangol''),&lt;ref&gt;[R. P. Crétois, Dictionnaire Sereer-Français, Dakar, CLAD, t. 1 (1972), t. 2 (1973), t. 3 (1974), t. 4 (1975), t. 5 (1976), t. 6 (1977), passim.] and [Abbé L. Diouf, L’homme dans le monde (Vision sereer), communication aux Journées Africaines de Théologie, polygraphié, s. d., p. 6.] [in] Martin &amp; Becker, "Lieux de culte et emplacements célèbres dans les pays sereer", pp 7–8&lt;/ref&gt; are the ancient saints and ancestral spirits of the [[Serer people]] of [[Senegal]], the [[Gambia]] and [[Mauritania]]. The Pangool play a crucial role in [[Serer religion]] and [[Timeline of Serer history|history]].  In a religious sense, they act as [[intercession of saints|interceders]] between the living world and the supreme being [[Roog]] or [[Koox]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Gravrand|Gravrand, Henry]], "La Civilisation Sereer – Pangool", vol.2, Les Nouvelles Editions Africaines du Senegal, (1990), p 278, {{ISBN|2-7236-1055-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a historical sense, the [[States headed by ancient Serer Lamanes|ancient Serer village and town founders]] called [[Lamane]]s were believed to be accompanied by a group of Pangool as they travelled in search of land to exploit.  These Lamanes became guardians of Serer religion and created shrines in honour of the Pangool, thus becoming the custodians of the Pangool cult.&lt;ref name="Gal"&gt;Galvan, Dennis Charles, "The State Must Be Our Master of Fire : How Peasants Craft Culturally Sustainable Development in Senegal", Berkeley, [[University of California Press]] (2004), pp 53, 185&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several Pangool in Serer religion and each one is associated with a specific attribute, have their own [[:Category:Serer holy places|sacred place of worship]], means of worship, etc. The symbol of the Pangool is the [[snake|serpent]], represented by two coiled snakes.&lt;ref&gt;Gravrand, "Pangool", p 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and terminology ==
*''Fangool'' –  the singular of Pangool
*''Pangool'' –  a group of Fangool
*''O Yaal Pangool'' (var : ''yaal pangool'') – the masters of the Pangool cult, i.e. the Serer priestly class – [[Saltigue]]s, previously the [[Lamane|Lamanic class]].&lt;ref&gt;Kalis, p 300&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Pangool ke'' – the ancestors&lt;ref&gt;Kalis, p 122&lt;/ref&gt;

The etymology of ''fangool'' comes from the Serer phrase ''Fang Qool'' which means the sacred [[snake|serpent]]&lt;ref&gt;Gravrand, "Pangool", p 311&lt;/ref&gt; the plural of which is ''pangool''. Fangool means serpent.&lt;ref name="Pangoo p 13"&gt;Gravrand, "Pangool", p 313&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
There are two main types of Pangool: non-human Pangool and human Pangool. Both are sacred and ancient, but the former is more ancient as a general rule. The non-human Pangool include ancient sacred places with vital spiritual energies and personalized as such.&lt;ref name="Pangoo p 13"/&gt; These Pangool generally are the personifications of [[Nature|natural]] forces.&lt;ref&gt;Granvrand, "Pangool", p 327&lt;/ref&gt; Human Pangool on the other hand became Pangool once they are canonized after death. Thus some are ancient, others are [[Medieval Era|medieval]]. Through their intercession with the divine, they form a link which transmits vital energies. Not every dead ancient ancestor is canonized as Pangool.&lt;ref name="Pangoo p 13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kal 122-3"/&gt;

Pangool can be subdivided further into:

:1. those Pangool who are known and revered in a particular region, such as the tombs of ancient Serer kings and queens&lt;ref name="Cr"&gt;{{fr}} R. P. Crétois, "Dictionnaire Sereer-Français", Dakar, CLAD, t. 1 (1972), t. 2 (1973), t. 3 (1974), t. 4 (1975), t. 5 [in] Martin &amp; Becker (pp 7–8)&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Serer ancient history]] and [[Serer creation myth]])
:2. those Pangool who are known and revered in a particular village or town, such as the [[States headed by ancient Serer Lamanes|Serer village or town founders]]&lt;ref name="Cr"/&gt;
:3. those Pangool who are known, revered and venerated in a particular square such as the founder of the square&lt;ref name="Cr"/&gt;
:4. a Fangool made known to an individual and thus became the personal Fangool of the individual in question,&lt;ref name="Cr"/&gt; such as the Fangool ''Ginaaru'' (the personal Fangool of [[Maad a Sinig Maysa Wali Jaxateh Manneh]], var: Maysa Waaly Dione,&lt;ref name="pan344"&gt;Gravrand, "Pangool", p 344&lt;/ref&gt; the first [[Guelowar]] king of [[Kingdom of Sine|Sine]], reigned: 1350–1370&lt;ref name="Sarr"&gt;[[Alioune Sarr|Sarr, Alioune]], "[[Alioune Sarr#Histoire du Sine-Saloum|Histoire du Sine-Saloum]]" (Sénégal),  Introduction, bibliographie et notes par Charles Becker. Version légèrement remaniée par rapport à celle qui est parue en 1986–87. p 19&lt;/ref&gt;).
:5. those Pangool whose names are [[lost history|lost to history]] or did not disclose their identity, but are well known for certain events in Serer history, such as the seizure of certain historical figures, etc.&lt;ref name="Cr"/&gt;

In addition to these, Pangool can be further categorized depending on their character and nature, such as:

:1. ''[[Blood]]'' or ''[[red#Courage and sacrifice|red]] Pangool'': those who require the sacrifice of domesticated animals (i.e. [[cattle]]) in their veneration, or alcohol&lt;ref name="Pan38"/&gt;
:2. ''[[Milk]] Pangool'': those who require the offerings of milk&lt;ref name="Pan38"/&gt;
:3. ''[[Water]] Pangool': those who reside in water, etc.,&lt;ref name="Pan38"/&gt;

Blood is a sign of life in Serer [[cosmogony]]&lt;ref name="Pan38"/&gt; and these types of Pangool fulfill a vital role in Serer society, and are seen as one of the most ancient and powerful. The Fangool Ngolum Joof (var: Ngolum Diouf) is one of these ''blood Pangool''.&lt;ref name="Pan38"/&gt; In many cases, offerings of alcohol rather than the sacrifice of [[domestication|domesticated animals]] are made to these ''blood Pangool''.&lt;ref name="Pan38"&gt;Gravrand, "Pangool", p 338&lt;/ref&gt;
In contrast to the ''blood Pangool'', the ''milk Pangool'' such as  Moussa Sarr, Njemeh (var: Ndiémé) of Languème and Njoxona, etc., are those Pangool who are peaceful in nature and character. They even reject anything that symbolizes violence or things that may evoke destruction or death, i.e. iron, weapons, gunpowder, blood and the colour red. They usually are the protectors of Serer cities and the defenders of the weak.&lt;ref name="Pan38"/&gt;

==History==

===Early history===
{{main|Timeline of Serer history|States headed by ancient Serer Lamanes|Lamane}}
The history regarding the veneration of the Pangool is found within the [[hermeneutics]] of Serer religion, oral tradition and archaeological discoveries. 
Prior to the widespread veneration of the Pangool, the religious habit of the ancient Serers included holding prayers at the beginning of the rainy season. The branches of the ''Njambayargin'' tree ([[bauhinia rufescens]]&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} Lericollais, André, "La mort des arbres à Sob, en pays Sereer" (Sénégal),  pp 3–5 [http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/doc34-08/30676.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;) were fetched by these ancient people because they believed the tree to possess elements which boosted the growth of their crops and produce much fruit. Ritual prayers were made to the supreme spirit [[Roog]] (or [[Koox]] among the [[Cangin languages|Cangin]]), totally distinct from the prayers that would later become afforded to other Serer spiritual entities such as the Pangool.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 283-4"&gt;Gravrand, "Pagool", pp 283–4&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Serer creation myth|Serer cosmogony]], trees play a vital role in the [[Cosmogony|creation narrative]], as they were the first things created on [[Earth]] by the divine, followed by [[animals]] (non-[[humans]]).&lt;ref&gt;Niangoran-Bouah, Georges, "L'univers Akan des poids à peser l'or : les poids dans la société", Les nouvelles éditions africaines – MLB, (1987), p 25, {{ISBN|2723614034}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Universität Frankfurt am Main]], Frobenius-Institut, Deutsche Gesellschaft für Kulturmorphologie, Frobenius Gesellschaft, "Paideuma: Mitteilungen zur Kulturkunde, Volumes 43–44", F. Steiner (1997), pp 144–5, (Henry Gravrand, "La civilisation Sereer -Pangool" [in]) {{ISBN|3515028420}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact date as to when the Pangool cult became prevalent cannot be stated with a degree of accuracy.

===Medieval Era===
{{main|Lamane Jegan Joof|Tukar}}
[[Lamane Jegan Joof]] founder of Tukar c. 11th century, is reported to have been accompanied by a group of Pangool when he migrated from [[Lambaye Arrondissement|Lambaye]] with his brother Ndik following a disagreement with his relative the king of Lambaye.&lt;ref&gt;Galvan, Dennis Charles, The State Must Be Our Master of Fire: How Peasants Craft Culturally Sustainable Development in Senegal, University of California Press, Berkeley (2004), pp 109–111, 80, 2–281 {{ISBN|9780520235915}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bressers, Hans, Rosenbaum, Walter A., Achieving sustainable development: the challenge of governance across social scales, Greenwood Publishing Group, (2003) p. 151 {{ISBN|0275978028}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his migration, he founded Tukar, previously in the Serer pre-colonial [[Kingdom of Sine]],&lt;ref&gt;Gravrand, "Pangool, p 241&lt;/ref&gt; now part of independent [[Senegal]]. Tukar is one of the [[:Category:Serer holy places|Serer holy sites]], and the Pangool affiliated with it are devotedly venerated in the Serer religious calendar, such as the '[[Serer religion#Raan Festival|Raan festival]] which takes place once a year on the second Thursday after the [[new moon]] in April. The descendants of Lamane Jegan Joof (the [[Joof family]] of Tukar) play a vital role in this religious affair.

==Serer religion==
{{Serer religion}}
{{Further|Serer religion|Serer creation myth}}
The Pangool are related to the [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendence]] of the divine. In the Serer home, the altar of the Pangool can not conceal that of the divine.&lt;ref&gt;Gravrand, "Pangool", p 305&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pangool provide the vital energies relating to the realities of the [[Serer people]] especially those forces outside the control of humanity. The religious practices and representations of the Pangool helps the Serer people dominate the hostile forces of nature, hence the advent of the Pangool veneration.&lt;ref name="pan"&gt;Gravrand, "Pangool", pp 307–8&lt;/ref&gt; Through their sacred intercession with the divine, these Pangool act as protectors and transmitters of vital energy to the world of the living. They can be humans, plants, animals, places, supernatural beings, etc.&lt;ref name="pan"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Diène Faye|Faye, Louis Diène]], "Mort et Naissance le monde Sereer", Les Nouvelles Editions Africaines (1983), p 43, {{ISBN|2-7236-0868-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animals and trees are viewed by the Serers as extended relatives of human beings, because they came from the same divine [[placenta]] at the time of the [[Creation myth|coronation]].

Many Pangool are spirits of early ancestors who had died. They represent both Pangool of the paternal line (''pangool o kurcala'') and those of the maternal line (''pangool o ƭeen yaay''). These ancestors guide and protect their descendants. Many [[:Category:Serer families|Serer families]] have a master of the cult who knows how to evokes the ancestor. The earlier Pangool were not human beings, but superior beings created by [[Roog]] at the time human beings were created. They were believed to have been created by the divine in order to help human kind. It is for this reason why the terms Pangool and ''Nguus'' (Serer word for genie&lt;ref&gt;Kalis, p 153&lt;/ref&gt;) are sometimes used interchangeably.&lt;ref name="Kal 122-3"&gt;Kalis, pp 122–123&lt;/ref&gt; Because some Pangool are linked to Serer lineages, only the head of the lineage schooled in the rituals can make a libation to the relevant Pangool or Fangool (the ancestor).&lt;ref name="Pangool p 352"&gt;Gravrand, "Pangool", 352&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Metempsychosis|other world]], the ancestors are the actual carrying-holders of transcendent sacred energies. However, the Pangool are superior in title because they were not transformed in the sacred energy. Thus the distinction between a ''fangool'' (non-human) and a human-ancestor lies in the mode of their participation in the transcendence. In either case, Roog is the first source of the transcendence of sacred energies.&lt;ref&gt;Kalis, p 123-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gravrand, "Pangool", p 330&lt;/ref&gt;

Offerings of fruits, vegetables, crops, milk, or the sacrifice of domesticated animals are made to the Pangool in different places, eg: at the foot of trees, in forests, at community shrines, etc. There are Pangools whose scope is therapeutic, those who deliver justice (see also [[Takhar]] – spirit of justice) and those who are personal Pangool&lt;ref&gt;Gravrand, "Pangool", p 342-4&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul Williams''' (July 2, 1939&amp;nbsp;– August 17, 1973) was an American [[baritone]] singer and [[choreographer]]. Williams was noted for being one of the founding members and original [[lead singer]] of the [[Motown]] group [[The Temptations]]. Along with [[Elbridge "Al" Bryant]], [[Otis Williams]] , and fellow Alabamians [[Eddie Kendricks]] and [[Melvin Franklin]], Williams was a member of The Temptations during the "Classic Five" period. Personal problems and failing health forced Williams to retire in 1971. He was found dead two years later as the result of an apparent suicide.

==Early years==
Paul Williams was born and raised in the [[Ensley (Birmingham)|Ensley]] neighborhood of [[Birmingham, Alabama]].&lt;ref name="williamsbirth"&gt;Ribowsky, Mark (2010). ''Ain't Too Proud to Beg: The Troubled Lives and Enduring Soul of the Temptations''. Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley &amp; Sons. {{ISBN|978-0-470-26117-0}}. Pg. 9-14&lt;/ref&gt; He was the son of Sophia and Rufus Williams, a gospel singer in a gospel music vocal group called the Ensley Jubilee Singers.&lt;ref name="williamsbirth" /&gt; He met [[Eddie Kendricks]] in elementary school; supposedly, the two first encountered each other in a fistfight after Williams dumped a bucket of mop water on Kendricks.&lt;ref name="williamsbirth" /&gt; Both boys shared a love of singing, and sang in their church choir together.&lt;ref name="williamsbirth" /&gt; As teenagers, Williams, Kendricks, and [[Kell Osborne]] and Willie Waller performed in a secular singing group known as The Cavaliers, with dreams of making it big in the music industry. In 1957, Williams, Kendricks, and Osborne left Birmingham to start careers, leaving Waller behind. Now known as The Primes, the trio moved to [[Cleveland, Ohio]], and eventually found a manager in Milton Jenkins, who moved the group to [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. Although The Primes never recorded, they were successful performers, and even launched a spin-off female group called The Primettes, who later became [[The Supremes]].

In 1961, Kell Osborne moved to [[California]], and the Primes disbanded. Kendricks returned to Alabama, but visited Paul in Detroit shortly after. While on this visit, he and Paul had learned that [[Otis Williams]], head of a rival Detroit act known as The Distants, had two openings in his group's lineup. Paul Williams and Kendricks joined Otis Williams, [[Melvin Franklin]], and [[Elbridge Bryant]] to form The Elgins, who signed to the local [[Motown]] label in 1961, after first changing their name to [[The Temptations]].

==With the Temptations==
{{main|The Temptations}}
Although the group now had a record deal, Paul Williams and his bandmates endured a long series of failed singles before finally hitting the [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] Top 20 in 1964 with "[[The Way You Do the Things You Do]]." More hits quickly followed, including "[[My Girl (The Temptations song)|My Girl]]", "[[Ain't Too Proud To Beg]]" and "[[(I Know) I'm Losing You]]."

Williams sang lead on several of the group's songs, and served as the main lead singer during the group's early years. His early leads include, "Your Wonderful Love" (1961), "Slow Down Heart" (1962), "[[I Want a Love I Can See]]" (1963), and "[[Oh Mother of Mine|Oh, Mother of Mine]]" (1961) (the group's first single) and "[[Farewell My Love]]" (1963) both shared with Eddie Kendricks.  Considered the Temptations' best dancer, Williams served as the group's original [[choreographer]], devising routines for his group and [[The Supremes]] (most notably their trademark "[[Stop! In the Name of Love]]" routine), before [[Cholly Atkins]] took over that role for all of Motown's acts. Williams' later leads on Temptations songs include, "Just Another Lonely Night" (1965), "No More Water in the Well" (1967), a cover version of "[[Hey Girl (Freddie Scott song)|Hey Girl]]" (1969), and his signature song "[[Don't Look Back (The Temptations song)|Don't Look Back]]" (1965).

Williams also sang lead with Dennis Edwards, who joined in 1968, on Motown's first Grammy Award-Winner "[[Cloud Nine (The Temptations song)|Cloud Nine]]". One of his best-known lead performances is his stand out live performance of "[[For Once in My Life]]," from the [[television]] special ''[[TCB (television special)|TCB]]'', originally broadcast on December 9, 1968 on [[NBC]]. The live version of the song "Don't Look Back" is also frequently cited as one of his standout performances. He also took over the lead vocal for live performances of "[[My Girl (The Temptations song)|My Girl]]" following [[David Ruffin]]'s departure from the group.

==Personal problems and decline==
Williams suffered from [[sickle-cell anemia]], which frequently wrought havoc on his physical health. In 1965, Williams began an affair with Winnie Brown, hair stylist for [[The Supremes]] and a relative of Supremes member [[Florence Ballard]]. In love with Brown but still devoted to his wife and children, Williams was also [[Major depressive disorder|depressed]] because [[Cholly Atkins]]' presence now made Williams' former role as choreographer essentially, but not completely, obsolete. Life on the road was starting to take its toll on Williams as well, and, having previously consumed nothing stronger than [[milk]], he began to [[alcoholism|drink alcohol heavily]], namely [[Courvoisier]], which, according to [[Otis Williams]], was hard to take.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deseretnews.com/article/660060/Tale-of-the-Temptations.html?pg=all&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1969, Williams and Brown opened a celebrity fashion [[boutique]] in downtown Detroit. The business was not as successful as planned, and Williams soon found himself owing more than [[USD|$]]80,000 in taxes (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|80000|1969}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}). His health had deteriorated to the point that he would sometimes be unable to perform, suffering from combinations of exhaustion and pain which he combated with heavy drinking. Each of the other four Temptations did what they could to help Williams, alternating between raiding and draining his alcohol stashes, personal [[intervention (counseling)|interventions]], and keeping [[oxygen tank]]s backstage, but Williams' health, as well as the quality of his performances, continued to decline and he refused to see a doctor.

Otis Williams and the other Temptations decided to resort to enlisting an on-hand fill-in for Paul Williams. [[Richard Street]], then-lead singer of fellow Motown act [[The Monitors (American band)|The Monitors]] and formerly lead singer of The Distants, was hired to travel with The Temptations and sing all of Williams' parts, save for Williams' special numbers such as "Don't Look Back" and "For Once in My Life", from backstage behind a curtain.  When Williams was not well enough to go on, Street took his place onstage. In April 1971, Williams was finally persuaded to go see a doctor. The doctor found a [[Cirrhosis|spot]] on Williams' [[liver]] and advised him to retire from the group altogether. Williams left the group and Street became his permanent replacement. In support of helping Williams get back on his feet, The Temptations continued to pay Williams his same one-fifth share of the group's earnings, and kept Williams on their payroll as an advisor and choreographer, and Williams continued to help the group with routines and dance moves for the next two years.

==Later years==
By early 1973, Williams made his return to Motown's [[Hitsville USA]] recording studios, and began working on solo material. Kendricks, who had quit the Temptations just before Williams left, produced and co-[[songwriter|wrote]] Williams' first single, "Feel Like Givin' Up", which was to have been issued on Motown's Gordy imprint with "Once You Had a Heart" as its [[b-side]]. However, after Williams' death was ruled a suicide in August 1973, Motown decided to shelve the sides, because the song "Feel Like Givin' Up" was just too literal to bear and the single was not released.

==Death==
On August 17, 1973,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=the temptations|bio=true}}|title=Artist Biography&amp;nbsp;— The Temptations|last=Ankeny|first=Jason|work=All Music Guide|accessdate=10 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Paul Williams was found dead in an alley in a car having just left the new house of his then-girlfriend after an argument.&lt;ref name="williamsdeath" /&gt; A gun was found near his body. His death was ruled a suicide by the coroner; Williams had expressed suicidal thoughts to Otis Williams and Melvin Franklin months before his death.&lt;ref name="williamsdeath"&gt;Ribowsky, Mark (2010).

Williams' funeral was held on August 24, with his family and former bandmates in attendance. He was survived by his wife, Mary Agnes Williams, and five children: Sarita, Kenneth, Paula, Mary and Paul Jr. Paul Jr later joined a Temptations splinter group, The Temptations Review featuring Dennis Edwards. Williams also had three other children, Paul Williams Lucas, Anthony Johnson, and Derrick Vinyard, with three girlfriends.&lt;ref name="williamsdeath2"&gt;{{cite web| author=Snell, Robert | date=June 25, 2011 | title=''Temptations heir sues sister over lost royalties''. | url=http://www.estateofdenial.com/2011/06/28/temptations-heir-sues-sister-over-lost-royalties-mi/ | publisher=''The Detroit News''}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Williams is buried at Lincoln Memorial Park Cemetery, Clinton Township, Macomb County, Michigan in Lot 275, Grave #4, Section #G.

The circumstances surrounding Williams' death caused the Williams family to suspect that some form of foul play was the actual cause of Williams' death.&lt;ref name="williamsdeath" /&gt; According to the coroner, Williams had used his right hand to shoot himself on the left side of his head.&lt;ref name="williamsdeath" /&gt; In addition, a bottle of alcohol was found near Williams' left side, as if he had dropped it while being shot. The gun used in the shooting was found to have fired two shots, only one of which had killed Williams.&lt;ref name="williamsdeath" /&gt;

==Legacy==
As a member of the Temptations, Paul Williams was posthumously inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1989 and the [[Vocal Group Hall of Fame]] in 1999 and the Rhythm &amp; Blues Music Hall of Fame in 2013. Both of his solo recordings were later released by Motown on Temptations-related compilations in the 1980s and 1990s.

In 1998, [[NBC]] aired ''[[The Temptations (TV miniseries)|The Temptations]]'', a four-hour television miniseries based upon an autobiographical book by Otis Williams.  Paul Williams was portrayed by actor [[Christian Payton]].

The music video for the [[Diana Ross]] song "Missing You" pays tribute to [[Marvin Gaye]], Florence Ballard, and Paul Williams, all former Motown artists who had died.

'''Pierre Jaquet-Droz''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒakɛ dʁo|lang}}; 1721–1790) was a [[watchmaker]] of the late eighteenth century. He lived in [[Paris]], [[London]], and [[Geneva]], where he designed and built animated dolls, or [[automata]], to help his firm sell watches and mechanical birds.

==Notable works==
[[File:Automates-Jaquet-Droz-p1030472.jpg|thumb|The [[Jaquet-Droz automata]]]]
Constructed between 1768 and 1774 by Pierre Jaquet-Droz, his son Henri-Louis (1752-1791), and Jean-Frédéric Leschot (1746-1824), the automata include ''The Writer'' (made of 6000 pieces), ''The Musician'' (2500 pieces), and ''The Draughtsman'' (2000 pieces).

His astonishing mechanisms fascinated the kings and emperors of Europe, China, India, and Japan.

Some consider these devices to be the oldest examples of the [[computer]]. ''The Writer'', a mechanical boy who writes with a quill pen upon paper with real ink, has an input device to set tabs, defining individual letters written by the boy, that form a programmable memory. It has 40 cams that represent the read-only programme. The work of Pierre Jaquet-Droz predates that of [[Charles Babbage]] by decades.

The automata of Jaquet-Droz are considered to be some of the finest examples of human mechanical problem solving. Three particularly complex and still functional dolls, now known as the [[Jaquet-Droz automata]], are housed at the [[Musée d'Art et d'Histoire (Neuchâtel)|Musée d'Art et d'Histoire]] (art and history museum) in [[Neuchâtel, Switzerland]].

He once constructed a clock that was capable of the following surprising movements:&lt;blockquote&gt;There were seen on it a negro, a dog, and a shepherd; when the clock struck, the shepherd played six tunes on his flute, and the dog approached and fawned upon him. This clock was exhibited to the King of Spain, who was delighted with it. "The gentleness of my dog," said Droz, "is his least merit; if your Majesty touch one of the apples, which you see in the shepherd's basket, you will admire the fidelity of this animal." The King took an apple, and the dog flew at his hand, and barked so loud, that the King's dog, which was in the room, began also to bark; at this the Courtiers, not doubting that it was an affair of witchcraft, hastily left the room, crossing themselves as they went out. The minister of Marine was the only one that ventured to stay. The king having desired him to ask the negro what o'clock it was, the minister obeyed, but he obtained no reply. Droz then observed, that the negro had not yet learned Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/1/3/8/11384/11384-h/11384-h.htm |title=The Project Gutenberg eBook of "The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction", Vol. 10, Issue 275, September 29, 1827, by Various |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date=2004-03-01 |accessdate=2013-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Richard David Hughes''' (born 8 September 1975, [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]], [[Kent]]) is an English [[musician]], best known as the [[drummer]] of the British pop rock band [[Keane (band)|Keane]].

== Biography ==
Richard David Hughes attended [[Tonbridge School]] where he was friends with future Keane members [[Tim Rice-Oxley]] and [[Dominic Scott]]. At the age of 17, Hughes learned to play the drums, and when Scott and Rice-Oxley formed a small [[cover version|covers]] band in 1995 he was invited to join as drummer. They later invited future lead singer [[Tom Chaplin]] to join the band, although Hughes initially objected, later stating, "The idea of giving someone who's already the loudest person you know a microphone was not something that I was particularly keen on."

Hughes then went to university at [[University College London]] where he received a [[academic degree|degree]] in [[Geography]]. He took a job as a [[secretary]] at the [[BBC]] in order to support himself and the band while they lived and practiced in a flat on Upper Clapton Road in [[London]]. He also had a job as a [[supply teacher]] for a short time. It has been said that the song 'Put it Behind You' was written by Rice-Oxley for Hughes after he had broken up with a girlfriend, and that much of the album 'Perfect Symmetry' - in particular the track 'You Don't See Me' - was also written about him and his unrequited love for a music journalist who broke his heart by marrying another man. Hughes is known to be the most humorous member of the band. Since ''[[Under the Iron Sea]]'' was released he has provided additional backing vocals for the band. He was married, presumably to his long-time girlfriend, in 2010.

He is a [[Human rights activist|Human Rights activist]] with [[Amnesty International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.amnesty.org.uk/blogs_entry.asp?eid=3808 |title=Amnesty Blogs: Press release me, let me go : Death row records: Richard Hughes and Troy Davis |publisher=Blogs.amnesty.org.uk |date=2009-09-25 |accessdate=2011-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 November 2011 Hughes spoke at the [[Oxford Union]] about his work with [[Amnesty International]], and his campaign for justice for [[Troy Davis]].

== Personal life ==
{{BLP sources|date=January 2017}}
Hughes collects "Nikon" brand cameras and calls himself "Nikon Guy". He is a great lover of photography and updates the site [[Keane (band)|Keane]] with "photoblogs" with photographs of the band on tour. He is a fan of the Irish rock band [[U2]], and other bands and groups like [[The Smiths]], [[The Beatles]] and [[Björk]]. His favorite song from the album ''[[Hopes and Fears]]'' is "[[Bend and Break]]" and "Put It Behind You" from [[Under the Iron Sea]]. Hughes is [[colourblind]] to green and brown, as said in a video where Richard answers 50 fan questions (can be found on the band's YouTube channel.)

==Equipment== 
Hughes uses Yamaha drums, [[Zildjian]] cymbals and [[Vic Firth]] drumsticks.  He also used [[Sabian]] cymbals in the past.  

Drums: Yamaha absolute maple 

Cymbals: Zildjian: 
* 14" A Custom hi-hats 
* 18" A Custom projection crash 
* 18" ZBT crash/ride

* 21" A sweet ride  

==Supports and foundations==
Keane took the initiative to participate in [[War Child (charity)|War Child]] (foundation to help children in countries at war). Richard is an activist who defends human rights, together with Amnesty International. He is also very involved in the case of [[Troy Davis]], sometimes wearing T-shirts with the message "I am Troy Davis" during his tour in the [[United States]]. Richard is also a great animal advocate and has been a vegetarian since age 13.

'''Samira Ibrahim''' ({{lang-ar|سميرة إبراهيم}}, {{IPA-arz|sæˈmiːɾæ ebɾˤɑˈhiːm|IPA}}) (born [[circa|c.]] 1987) is an [[Egypt]]ian activist who came to prominence during the Egyptian revolution.

==Tahrir sit-in and aftermath==
On March 9, 2011, she participated in a sit-in at [[Tahrir Square]] in [[Cairo]]. The military violently dispersed protest participants, and Samira and other women were beaten, given electric shocks, [[strip search]]ed, and videotaped by the soldiers. They were also subjected to [[virginity test]]s. The tests were allegedly carried out to protect the soldiers from claims of rape.

After succeeding in placing the case in front of a civilian court, a [[court order]] was issued in December 2011 to stop the practice of “virginity tests”. However, in March 2012, a [[military court]] [[exonerated]] Dr. Adel El Mogy from charges laid in connection with the virginity testing of Ibrahim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2012/03/2012316133129201850.html |title=What made her go there?

Ibrahim vowed to take her case to the international courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Abdel-Rahman Hussein in Cairo |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/mar/13/women-samira-ibrahim-egypt-virginity-tests/print |title='The future of Egyptian women is in danger' - Samira Ibrahim speaks out |publisher=Guardian |date= March 13, 2012|accessdate=2013-05-19 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2013 Twitter allegations==
In early March 2013, Ibrahim came under criticism after [[Samuel Tadros]], writing in ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'', accused her of posting [[anti-Semitic]] and [[anti-American]] statements on her [[Twitter]] account. These statements included quoting [[Adolf Hitler]], writing: "I have discovered with the passage of days, that no act contrary to morality, no crime against society, takes place, except with the Jews having a hand in it. Hitler.” In reaction to a [[2012 Burgas bus bombing|suicide bombing]] of a bus of Israelis in Bulgaria, she wrote "Today is a very sweet day with a lot of very sweet news.”&lt;ref name=Weeklystandard&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/michelle-obama-and-john-kerry-honor-anti-semite-and-911-fan_706547.html |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20130324130812/http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/michelle-obama-and-john-kerry-honor-anti-semite-and-911-fan_706547.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=March 24, 2013 |title=Michelle Obama and John Kerry to Honor Anti-Semite and 9/11 Fan |newspaper=Weekly Standard |author=Samuel Tadros |date=March 6, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 on the anniversary of the [[September 11 terrorist attack]]s, she tweeted "Today is the anniversary of [[9/11]].

The American State Department subsequently announced that it will not be giving the ''International Women of Courage Award'' to her in light of these comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/us-reverses-decision-to-honor-egyptian-woman-activist-in-light-of-anti-us-anti-semitic-tweets/2013/03/07/e3d3b8dc-875b-11e2-a80b-3edc779b676f_story.html|title=US postpones award to honor Egyptian woman activist in light of anti-US, anti-Semitic tweets|newspaper=Washington Post|agency=Associated Press}} {{Dead link|date=April 2014|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4354101,00.html |title=US revokes award for Egyptian woman due to tweets |publisher= Ynetnews.com |date=  8 March 2012 |accessdate= 8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, Ibrahim claimed that her Twitter account had been "previously stolen" and that "any tweet on racism and hatred is not me”.&lt;ref name=Weeklystandard/&gt; However, she later stated "I refuse to apologize to the [[Zionist]] lobby in America regarding my previous anti-Zionist statements under pressure from American government therefore they withdrew the award."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/03/samira-ibrahim-refuses-to-apologize-for-her-tweets/273835/ Samira Ibrahim 'Refuses to Apologize' for Her Tweets] by [[Jeffrey Goldberg]], ''[[The Atlantic]]'', March 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. State Department later stated that Ibrahim had since left the United States to return to Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jta.org/news/article/2013/03/08/3121521/samira-ibrahim-acknowledges-anti-zionist-treat |title=Samira Ibrahim acknowledges ‘anti-Zionist’ tweet |publisher=''[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]]'' (JTA) |date=March 8, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130311104322/http://www.jta.org/news/article/2013/03/08/3121521/samira-ibrahim-acknowledges-anti-zionist-treat |archivedate=March 11, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/politics/kerry/ibrahim.asp |title=Samira Ibrahim |publisher= Snopes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 8, 2013, a spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department stated that "Upon further review, the department has decided not to present her with the award" as American officials "didn't consider some of the public statements that she had made appropriate. They didn't comport with our values" while adding that "There were obviously some problems in our review process, and we're going to do some forensics on how that happened."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/us-cancels-award-samira-ibrahim-after-incendiary-tweets |title=US cancels award for Samira Ibrahim after incendiary tweets |publisher=[[Al-masry Al-youm|Egypt Independent]] |date= March 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sharon Ventura''', also known as '''She-Thing''', is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She has used the pseudonym [[Ms. Marvel]] and has served as a member of the [[Fantastic Four]] and the female wrestlers known as the [[Grapplers (comics)|Grapplers]].

==Publication history==
{{expand-section|date=October 2014}}
Created by [[Mike Carlin]] and [[Ron Wilson (comics)|Ron Wilson]], the character first appeared in ''[[Thing (comics)|Thing]]'' #27 (September 1985).

==Fictional character biography==
[[File:SheThing.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Sharon Ventura (as the She-Thing) battles the Fantastic Four. From ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' #379.]]
Sharon Ventura met [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] at the time when he was involved with the [[Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation]] (UCWF).&lt;ref&gt;''The Thing'' #27&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by him, she signed up for the [[Power Broker]]'s program in order to have her strength augmented and join the UCWF. The Power Broker (actually Curtiss Jackson), employed Dr. [[Karl Malus]] to create super-powered wrestlers for his competitions. Sharon was unaware of the criminal activities of Jackson or Malus. While boosting their subjects' strength, the pair addicted the subjects to a drug, ensuring their obedience. It has been implied that she was raped while a prisoner of Malus, which caused her to temporarily develop an intense hatred and distrust of men. Sharon managed to break free before Malus administered the drug. She adopted the costume which UCWF minder Ann Fraley ([[Auntie Freeze]]) had arranged for her, taking the name '''Ms. Marvel'''. Alongside the Thing, she battled the [[Grapplers (comics)|Grapplers]] and the UCWF wrestlers.&lt;ref&gt;''The Thing'' #35&lt;/ref&gt; She then battled the [[She-Hulk]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Thing'' #36&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Sharon was used by the Power Broker to determine if the augmentation could be reversed.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #330&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside [[Captain America]], she battled the Power Broker.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #331&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharon later joined the [[Fantastic Four]], and alongside the Fantastic Four she battled [[Diablo (Marvel Comics)|Diablo]].&lt;ref&gt;''Fantastic Four'' #306-307&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after joining the Fantastic Four, Sharon was mutated by cosmic rays and took on strength and appearance similar to that of Ben Grimm, a.k.a. the Thing.&lt;ref&gt;''Fantastic Four'' #310, Jan. 1988&lt;/ref&gt; Although she never officially retired her Ms. Marvel moniker, she became more popularly known as the '''She-Thing''' and it is by this name she is most known to comic book fans. She later first encountered [[Aron (comics)|Aron the Rogue Watcher]], and battled the [[She-Hulk]]. With She-Hulk, She-Thing battled [[Dragon Man]].&lt;ref&gt;''Fantastic Four'' #321&lt;/ref&gt; With the Fantastic Four and [[Frightful Four]], she was captured by Aron. They escaped and defeated their clones.&lt;ref&gt;''Fantastic Four'' #328-333&lt;/ref&gt; Sharon later battled the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].&lt;ref&gt;''Fantastic Four'' #35&lt;/ref&gt; She-Thing was offered the chance to be human again by Doctor Doom while a then-powerless Ben Grimm chose to use one of Reed Richards' machines to revert to the Thing to save She-Thing.&lt;ref&gt;''Fantastic Four'' #350&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside the Fantastic Four, she battled the [[Time Variance Authority]]. She-Thing left the Fantastic Four soon after and began working for Doctor Doom. Sharon claimed to be doing this so that Doom would cure Ben as he had her.&lt;ref&gt;''Fantastic Four'' #352-354&lt;/ref&gt; She was sent by Doctor Doom to spy on the Fantastic Four, where she first met [[Alicia Masters]].&lt;ref&gt;''Fantastic Four'' #365-367&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Mister Fantastic]] and the Thing, she was captured by Aron, but rescued by the [[Molecule Man]] and Doctor Doom.&lt;ref&gt;''Fantastic Four'' #371-373&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside the Fantastic Four, she battled the [[Secret Defenders]].&lt;ref&gt;''Fantastic Four'' #374&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside the Fantastic Four, [[Lyja]], and the [[Inhumans]], she battled Doctor Doom.&lt;ref&gt;''Fantastic Four'' #375&lt;/ref&gt; When she refused to betray her friends in the Fantastic Four to Doctor Doom, Doom spitefully mutated her into a much more monstrous form.&lt;ref&gt;''Fantastic Four'' #378&lt;/ref&gt; After a bout of insanity, she briefly joined the [[Frightful Four]] and battered Sue Storm Richards to within inches of her life.&lt;ref&gt;''Fantastic Four Unlimited'' #5&lt;/ref&gt; 

Years later, She-Thing had a guest appearance in ''Marvel Knight''s 4, a spinoff of the main ''Fantastic Four'' book. The appearance established that she was indeed alive and well in the Marvel Universe and her attire implied she was still residing with Wingfoot. Her absence was poked fun at, as she stated that she couldn't believe anybody still had her number.

Sharon Ventura was later seen again in her She-Thing form.&lt;ref&gt;''Fantastic Four'' #543 (March 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, a [[Skrull]] impersonating Sharon's "She-Thing" persona is killed by the [[Skrull Kill Krew]].&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers: The Initiative'' #16&lt;/ref&gt; The real Sharon is recovered alive from a downed Skrull ship after the final battle of the invasion.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers: The Initiative'' #19&lt;/ref&gt; Sharon attends a support group meeting with the others who were replaced by Skrulls.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers: The Initiative'' #20&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharon has since been revealed as a prisoner in the Raft, with evidence suggesting that she is part of a plot to destabilize the Fantastic Four.&lt;ref&gt;''Fantastic Four Vol. 5 #9''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the post-[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]] Marvel Universe, Ms. Ventura has returned to her original human appearance, and has been seen wrestling in her original outfit.&lt;ref&gt;''Sam Wilson: Captain America #15''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
As Ms. Marvel, Sharon had superhuman strength and endurance, thanks to augmentation of her physical attributes by Dr. Karl Malus on behalf of the Power Broker. The mutagenic effect due to exposure to cosmic radiation that turned her into the She-Thing later greatly increased her physical attributes and durability.

Sharon is highly proficient in hand-to-hand combat, and skilled at various martial arts, including [[tae kwon do]] and American [[boxing]]. She is also an expert stuntwoman, scuba diver, skydiver, motorcyclist, mountain climber, skier, lion tamer, and wrestler. She attended a military academy until she was expelled.

As part of Ben Grimm's Fantastic Four, she demonstrated her intelligence by solving complicated situations with her intuition and cunning.&lt;ref&gt;''Fantastic Four'' #324&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==
===Video games===
Sharon Ventura's Ms. Marvel appearance appears as an alternate costume for Ms. Marvel ([[Carol Danvers]]) in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vip.marvelultimatealliance.com/news.php?news_id=87 Marvel ultimatealliance] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/19700101000000/http://vip.marvelultimatealliance.com/news.php?news_id=87 |date=January 1, 1970 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Shinji Ikari'''|碇 シンジ|Ikari Shinji}} is a [[character (arts)|fictional character]] from the ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'' franchise created by [[Gainax]]. He is the franchise's [[poster boy]] and [[protagonist]] who is generally regarded highly by critics.&lt;ref name="90sflashback"&gt;{{cite web |last = Verboon | first = Nick | date =June 13, 2013 | title= 90's Flashback: Neon Genesis Evangelion |url= http://unrealitymag.com/index.php/2013/06/13/90s-flashback-neon-genesis-evangelion/ | publisher= Unreality Mag |accessdate=November 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shinji is a young boy who was abandoned by his father, [[Gendo Ikari|Gendo]], who later requests him to pilot a mecha known as the [[Evangelion (mecha)#EVA Unit 01|Evangelion Unit 01]] to protect the city of Tokyo-3 from creatures known as Angels that threaten to destroy mankind. Shinji pilots Unit 01, at first rigorously and later excellently, and during his time in Tokyo-3 he is gradually freed from his [[Hedgehog's dilemma|Hedgehog's Dilemma]] as he socializes with comrades and gains friends. His talent for piloting and synchronizing Unit 01 has earned him praise from the commanding officers of NERV, an organization which Gendo leads. His toilsome duty and the cruel events of his life bring him severe stress and suffering. At some point in the series he begins to confront his inner self, forming arguments and questions about life and reality.

Shinji's portrayal differs depending on the media in which he is shown such as in the official [[manga]] adaptation where he is written from the author [[Yoshiyuki Sadamoto]]'s point of view as well as other spinoff series. Shinji became highly popular, having appeared and topped in multiple popularity polls. Nick Verboon of ''Unreality Mag'' states "poster boy/protagonist Shinji is one of the most nuanced, popular, and relatable characters in anime history.&lt;ref name="90sflashback"/&gt;

==Conception==
Director [[Hideaki Anno]] described the hero, Shinji Ikari, as a boy who "shrinks from human contact", and has "convinced himself that he is a completely unnecessary person, so much so that he cannot even commit suicide." He describes Shinji and [[Misato Katsuragi]] as "extremely afraid of being hurt" and "unsuitable — lacking the positive attitude — for what people call heroes of an adventure."&lt;ref name="What-were-we-making"&gt;{{cite book | last = Sadamoto | first = Yoshiyuki | authorlink = Yoshiyuki Sadamoto | others = Essay by [[Hideaki Anno]]; translated by Mari Morimoto, English adaptation by Fred Burke | title = Neon Genesis Evangelion, Vol. 1 |date=December 1998 | origyear = July 1995 | publisher = VIZ Media LLC | location = San Francisco | isbn = 1-56931-294-X | pages = 170–171 | chapter = What were we trying to make here? }}&lt;/ref&gt; When compared to the stereotypical hero, Shinji is characterized more by lack of energy and [[emotion]] than by heroism or bravery.&lt;ref&gt;"This, the opening episode is constructed around all the conventions of the classic "saving the world" narrative, only to undermine them by showing IKARI &lt;nowiki&gt;[sic]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Shinji, its fourteen-year-old ostensible hero, in a far from heroic light … In a more conventional anime sf narrative, Shinji would climb into the EVA with gusto and proceed to save the world. In fact he does pilot the EVA and succeeds in destroying the Angel – who turns out to be the third of seventeen – but only with the greatest reluctance and after a display of temper, fear, and vulnerability that seems less than conventionally heroic." pg 424–425 of Napier 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Shinji has an [[Oedipus complex]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://x-ray001473.blog.ocn.ne.jp/iimode_do/2006/04/post_f588.html|title=エディプス・コンプレックス|date=April 23, 2003|website=X-ray001473.blog.ocn.ne.jp|quote=There was this replacement by a robot, so the original mother is the robot, but then there is a mother of the same age, Rei Ayanami, by [Shinji’s] side.

Shinji's relationship with his Evangelion and status as a pilot is very ambivalent; the entire series can be seen as a [[bildungsroman]] revolving around Shinji.&lt;ref&gt;"The animation, 'Evangelion,' is a kind of bildungsroman about the soul-searching of a 14-year-old boy who has to fight mysterious enemies in a new Tokyo in the year 2015 by piloting a human-shaped robot named 'Eva.'" from Japan Economic Newswire, MAY 8, 1997, THURSDAY. "Cartoon 'Eva' captures sense of void among Japanese youth". by Yoichi Kosukegawa. TOKYO, May 8 Kyodo&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"Look at Shinji. Why does he continue to fight as an Eva pilot? The story keeps changing. He said it's because everyone tells him to. Because only he can do it. Because it has to be done to save humanity. Selfless and lofty sentiments for sure, and he believed those reasons to be genuine. Wrong; he wanted his father to approve of him. To say he was a good boy. How selfish of him, really, to be a human being." --[[Megumi Hayashibara]]&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from "What I learned from meeting a girl who didn't know", a 1996 essay translated in Viz's English edition of ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion, volume 3]]''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Shinji has often been seen as a version or reflection of the creator of ''Evangelion'' and Anno has referred to the plot line as a metaphor of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wong |first=Amos |date=January 1996 |title=Interview with Hideaki Anno, director of 'Neon Genesis Evangelion' |journal=Aerial Magazine |url=http://www.aoianime.hu/evangelion/index.php?page=interanno |accessdate=May 4, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613125248/http://www.aoianime.hu/evangelion/index.php?page=interanno|archivedate=2007-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Ikari" means "anchor" in Japanese.  Shinji was named for [[Gainax]] co-founder [[Shinji Higuchi]]; it can be translated to "child of god."&lt;ref&gt;pg 121 of ''Neon Genesis Evangelion: The Unofficial Guide'', by Kazuhisa Fujie and Martin Foster, 2004, {{ISBN|0-9745961-4-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''Evangelion'' character names | work=Translation of essay by [[Hideaki Anno]] about character name origins; includes a link to the original essay in Japanese | url=http://www.evacommentary.org/appendix/character-names.html | accessdate=August 19, 2007 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819093918/http://www.evacommentary.org/appendix/character-names.html | archivedate=August 19, 2007 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Evangelion'' character designer [[Yoshiyuki Sadamoto]] based his design of Shinji on his design of Nadia, the title character of Gainax's popular 1990-1991 TV series, ''[[Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water]]''.&lt;ref name="sadamotointer"&gt;''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion (manga)|Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'', vol. 2, bonus materials&lt;/ref&gt;

Megumi Ogata, who voiced Shinji, found the last scene of ''End of Evangelion'' difficult to perform. Ogata regards Shinji Ikari as one of her "most memorable" roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akadot.com/story.php?id=31 |title=Rocking the Boat |author= |date=2001-04-27 |work=interview |publisher=Digital Manga |accessdate=20 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623173408/http://www.akadot.com/story.php?id=31 |archivedate=June 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances==

===''Neon Genesis Evangelion''===
Shinji makes his first appearance in the first episode where he is invited to Tokyo-3 by his father [[Gendo Ikari]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Angel Attack|airdate=1995-10-04|number=1|credits=Director: Kazuya Tsurumaki, Writers:Hideaki Anno|series=Neon Genesis Evangelion|network=TV Tokyo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unbeknownst to Shinji however, his father told him to come so he could serve as the pilot of Evangelion Unit-01. Shinji reluctantly agrees and defeats the Angel Sachiel, initially experiencing difficulty, but brutally destroys the Angel after Unit-01 goes berserk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Beast|airdate=1995-10-11|number=2|credits=Director: Kazuya Tsurumaki, Writers:Hideaki Anno, Yoji Enokido|series=Neon Genesis Evangelion|network=TV Tokyo}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Angel attack, Shinji begins to attend school in Tokyo-3 and meets Toji Suzuhara and Kensuke Aida who would become his first true friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=A Transfer|airdate=1995-10-18|number=3|credits=Director: Kazuya Tsurumaki, Writers:Hideaki Anno, Akio Satsukawa|series=Neon Genesis Evangelion|network=TV Tokyo}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the Angel Ramiel appears and attempts to destroy Nerv headquarters, Shinji and fellow pilot [[Rei Ayanami]] work together to destroy the Angel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Rei II|airdate=1995-11-08|number=6|credits=Director: Hiroyuki Ishido, Writers:Hideaki Anno, Akio Satsukawa|series=Neon Genesis Evangelion|network=TV Tokyo}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When a nuclear-powered machine intended to fight the Angels runs amok, he and his guardian Misato successfully stop it. Shinji later meets [[Asuka Langley Soryu]], an eva-pilot from Germany, and the two successfully defeat Gaghiel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Asuka Strikes!|airdate=1995-11-01|number=8|credits=Director: Kazuya Tsurumaki, Writers:Hideaki Anno, Yoki Enokido|series=Neon Genesis Evangelion|network=TV Tokyo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shinji, Rei and Asuka assault the explosive angel Sahaquiel, risking their lives to the extreme in order to do so. They defeat the Angel thanks mostly to Shinji's efforts. Shinji later gains supreme synchronization skill, causing Shinji to realize that he was born to pilot the Eva, and he receives praise from the commanding officers of NERV. Shinji, Rei and Asuka are later sent to fight the dark Angel Leliel, whose reverse AT field sucks Shinji into a parallel universe. Shinji confronts the Angel, during which he also confronts his inner self, forming arguments and philosophies. He is brutally freed from the powerful Angel through the intervention of his mother Yui, whose soul is within the Eva, which epically, gruesomely splits the Angel's massive body into two.

After Shinji is forced to fight the Bardiel-controlled Eva-03 while Toji is trapped within,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Ambivalence|airdate=1996-01-31|number=18|credits=Director: Tensai Okamura, Writers:Hideaki Anno, Shinji Higuchi|series=Neon Genesis Evangelion|network=TV Tokyo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shinji decides to quit Nerv. Zeruel soon appears and decapitates the other Evangelion units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Introjection|airdate=1996-02-07|number=19|credits=Director: Masayuki, Writers:Hideaki Anno, Akio Satsukawa|series=Neon Genesis Evangelion|network=TV Tokyo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shinji realizes that only he can defeat it, and returns to NERV. Midway during the battle, however, Unit-01's power supply runs out, eventually causing Shinji to attain a 400% sync ratio with the unit, allowing him to continue his assault and frees the Evangelion in the process. As a result, he is trapped within its core for a month before being released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Weaving a Story 2: Oral Stage|airdate=1996-02-14|number=20|credits=Director: Masahiko Ohtsuka, Writers:Hideaki Anno|series=Neon Genesis Evangelion|network=TV Tokyo}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Rei sacrifices herself to save Shinji and then is subsequently revived through one of her clones while Asuka becomes comatose,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Rei III|airdate=1996-03-06|number=23|credits=Director: Shoichi Masuo, Writers:Hideaki Anno, Hiroshi Yamaguchi|series=Neon Genesis Evangelion|network=TV Tokyo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shinji begins to suffer with depression. He meets [[Kaworu Nagisa]] and the two become friends. However, it is later revealed that Kaworu is in fact the final Angel and Shinji is forced to kill him,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Beginning and the End, or 'Knockin' on Heaven's Door|airdate=1996-03-13|number=24|credits=Director: Shoichi Masuo, Writers:Hideaki Anno, Akio Satsukawa|series=Neon Genesis Evangelion|network=TV Tokyo}}&lt;/ref&gt; giving Shinji extreme mental trauma.

===''The End of Evangelion''===
''[[The End of Evangelion]]'' continues Shinji's story, portraying his downward spiral into depression and eventual loss of the will to live. He is in this state for the majority of the film, remaining catatonic while all the NERV officers, including Misato, are killed. Shinji then decides to pilot the Eva to save those who are still alive, but a bakelite release ordered by Misato accidentally blocks the entrance of Unit-01. When Shinji learns of Asuka's defeat, the Evangelion moves on its own to let Shinji become the transcendent, powerful hero once again. Shinji's Ego cause the Eva's AT field to manifest in the form of gigantic, dreadful, divine wings. Despite this, after witnessing the mangled, mutilated corpse of Unit-02 being carried by the Mass Production Evas, Shinji's trauma becomes even worse as the Human Instrumentality Project begins. Shinji's intense emotion summons the Lance of Longinus stuck on the Moon all the way down to Earth. Shinji's Ego continues to resist Lilith-Rei and SEELE's assaults on his soul; but when Lilith-Rei takes the form of Kaworu Nagisa, Shinji's Ego weakens, as Yui's soul from inside the Eva tells Shinji that Rei is "all of Shinji's hopes and dreams". Lilith-Rei and SEELE ultimately defeat Shinji's Ego. The fusion of the Lance of Longinus with the Eva recreates a Tree of Life. Shinji and the Eva, now possessing both the Fruit of Wisdom and the Fruit of Life, become "God". Shinji, now one with all other humans, converses with them, particularly Rei and Kaworu. It is revealed that Shinji and Eva's absorption of a Fruit of Life and a Fruit of Wisdom meant that Eva, and the pilot inside, will continue to exist forever, "even after the Sun, the Moon, and the planets are gone". He eventually converses with Yui, whom he wonders what will do, until he finally decides that he wants to live and returns to Earth. Asuka appears next to him and Shinji attempts to strangle her for an un-clarified reason, but stops himself and breaks down after Asuka regains consciousness and caresses his face.

===''Rebuild of Evangelion''===
In ''[[Rebuild of Evangelion]]'' Shinji returns as the central protagonist in ''[[Evangelion: 1.0 You Are (Not) Alone]]'', where he is shown to be more outspoken than his TV counterpart. In this film, Shinji's role is very much the same as that of the anime series. He is assigned to be the pilot of Unit-01 and works alongside Rei to defeat the Angel Ramiel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people = [[Hideaki Anno]], [[Kazuya Tsurumaki]], Masayuki (directors) | title = [[Evangelion: 1.0 You Are (Not) Alone]] | medium = [[Film]] | publisher = [[Studio Khara]] |date = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance]]'', Shinji continues his duties as pilot of Unit-01, albeit reluctantly. After the battle with Bardiel, wherein his father forced him to critically injure Asuka, Shinji retires from his duties and leaves NERV. When Zeruel consumes Rei, Shinji returns and defeats the Angel by seemingly fusing with the Evangelion. In ''[[Evangelion: 3.0 You Can (Not) Redo]]'', set fifteen years later, Shinji is awakened to a changed world caused by the Third Impact which he started. Everyone treats Shinji poorly, except Kaworu. A clone of Rei now pilots Mark 09, aka The Vessel of Adams. After Shinji realizes that he did not save Rei, he and Kaworu pilot Eva-13, one of the Four Adams and the most powerful known Evangelion which the two operate. They attempt to erase Third Impact by using the spears of Longinus and Cassius allegedly lodged in Lilith, but instead start Fourth impact after Shinji pulls the two spears of Longinus out from Lilith, ignoring Kaworu and Asuka's warning. Eva-13 then eats the Twelfth Angel and ascends to divinity. However, Kaworu sacrifices himself to stop the Fourth Impact, leaving Shinji losing his will to live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people = [[Hideaki Anno]], [[Kazuya Tsurumaki]], Masayuki (directors) | title = [[Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance]] | medium = [[Film]] | publisher = [[Studio Khara]] |date = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth film is yet to be released.

===In other media===
{{refimprove section|date=April 2009}}
Shinji appears in most manga adaptations of ''Neon Genesis Evangelion'', including [[Yoshiyuki Sadamoto]]'s [[Neon Genesis Evangelion (manga)|manga adaptation]]. The manga generally follows the plot of the anime with occasional alterations in events. In this manga, Shinji's role is very similar to his anime counterpart, although changes in characterization are apparent. This is due to the fact the manga is written from Sadamoto's point of view involving Shinji. Sadamoto was inspired to write the manga after learning of Shinji's role in the first episode of the television series.&lt;ref name="sadamotointer"/&gt; Shinji is also a primary protagonist in ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion: Shinji Ikari Raising Project|the Shinji Ikari Raising Project]]'' and ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion: Campus Apocalypse]]'' where he is portrayed in a different light than his anime counterpart.

Shinji, alongside  other ''Evangelion'' characters, makes frequent appearances in video games, such as ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion (video game)|Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'' for the [[Nintendo 64]]. Shinji is also a playable character in the popular cross-over video game franchise [[Super Robot Wars]] where he and other ''Evangelion'' characters work with characters from various other [[mecha]] series.

==Reception==
Shinji has received critical acclaim as a character. Shinji ranked 25th on [[IGN]]'s first top 25 anime characters list. Editor Chris Mackenzie commented that the IGN staff loved him "not for what he is, but for what he could be".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Top 25 Anime Characters of All Time |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/103/1036651p1.html |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2009-10-22 |date=2009-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, IGN ranked him as the greatest anime character of all time, observing that he is a "genuine work of art", saying that heroes "are often who we want to be", and noting he was different from it: "he was perhaps the most emotionally true-to-life character in anime history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/04/top-25-greatest-anime-characters?page=5 | title=Top 25 Greatest Anime Characters | author=Isler, Ramsey | date=February 4, 2014 | publisher=IGN | accessdate=March 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a ''[[Newtype]]'' poll from March 2010, Shinji was voted as the most popular male character from the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Newtype]], Issue 4|date=March 2010|publisher=[[Kadokawa Shoten]]|title=NT Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 19th and the 20th ''[[Animage]]'' Grand Prix ranked him the best male character of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animage.jp/old/gp/gp_1997.html|script-title=ja:第19回アニメグランプリ 1997年6月号|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Animage]]|accessdate=April 11, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vS3xHqrF?url=http://animage.jp/old/gp/gp_1997.html|archivedate=January 3, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animage.jp/old/gp/gp_1998.html|script-title=ja:第20回アニメグランプリ 1998年6月号|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Animage]]|accessdate=April 11, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vS3xHqrM?url=http://animage.jp/old/gp/gp_1998.html|archivedate=January 3, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pete Harcoff, a reviewer for Anime Critic, gave a positive review of ''Neon Genesis Evangelion'' yet maintained a negative view of Shinji's character, stating that Shinji was ineffective and disappointing to watch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animecritic.com/evangelion/anr-evangelion.html|title=Neon Genesis Evangelion|author=Pete Harcoff|date=May 26, 2003|work=|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215400/http://www.animecritic.com/evangelion/anr-evangelion.html|archivedate=4 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shinji's role in the Rebuild of Evangelion films got a better response as he was noted to be friendlier with other characters in contrast to his role in the TV series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/evangelion/1.0.1-you-are-not-alone/dub-version|title=Evangelion: 1.0.1 You Are &amp;#x5B;Not&amp;#x5D; Alone (dub version)|date=July 9, 2009|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|author=Santos, Carlo|accessdate=December 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/evangelion/2.0-you-can-not-advance|title=Evangelion: 2.0 You Can &amp;#x5B;Not&amp;#x5D; Advance|date=November 24, 2009|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|author=Sevakis, Justin|accessdate=December 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theron Martin from [[Anime News Network]] listed the scene from ''[[Evangelion: 2.22 You Can (Not) Advance]]'' in which Shinji saves Rei as the "Best Scene" in the site's feature "The Best (and Most Notable) of 2011." Martin praised Shinji's determination in such scene as "this is the first time in the entire franchise that he whole-heartedly goes after something because he ''wants'' it, rather than because he's expected to or has no choice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2012-01-05|title=Anime in America: The Best (and Most Notable) of 2011|date=January 5, 2012|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|author=Theron, Martin|accessdate=November 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spike Spencer]], Shinji's English voice actor, has received praise for his role, particularly for his performance in ''The End of Evangelion''. Mike Crandol of [[Anime News Network]] praised the subtle nuances that Spencer brought to the role, as he felt that Spencer had improved over his previous performances where he tended to parody Shinji's inner turmoil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/end-of-evangelion-dvd|title= Neon Genesis Evangelion: End of Evangelion |author= Mike Crandol |date= September 24, 2002|work= |publisher= |accessdate=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pete Harcoff, while critical of Shinji's character, also complimented Spencer, stating that he delivered a solid performance as Shinji.&lt;ref name="animecritic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animecritic.com/evangelion/anr-endofevangelion.html|title=End of Evangelion|author=Pete Harcoff|date=June 6, 2003|work=|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928080610/http://www.animecritic.com/evangelion/anr-endofevangelion.html|archivedate=28 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nick Verboon of ''Unreality Mag'' states "poster boy/protagonist Shinji is one of the most nuanced, popular, and relatable characters in anime history.&lt;ref name="90sflashback"/&gt;

Though she began singing in the paranda, by the 1980s, Blanco's voice and style were more suited to ''gayusa'',{{sfn|Arrivillaga Cortés|Savage|2016}} a call and response type of singing accompanied by a base drum and a flourishing drum providing rhythm with [[maracas]] punctuating the beat.{{sfn|Cayetano|2017}} Traditionally used for ritual songs and dance performances during the rites, the leader performs the call and is answered by the choir.{{sfn|Arrivillaga Cortés|Savage|2016}}{{sfn|Cayetano|2017}} She performed with the group ''Despertar Garífuna Marcos Sánchez Díaz'' (Marcos Sánchez Díaz Garifuna Awakening), which was a group dedicated to preserving and promoting Garifuna heritage. In 1992, Blanco produced a double album with the Guatemalan Tourism Institute ({{lang-es|Instituto Guatemalteco de Turismo INGUAT}}), which contained the music performed at the ''Primer Encuentro de Músicos de la Tradición Popular Garífuna'' (First Gathering of Musicians of the Garifuna Popular Tradition). In 1997, while performing with the Afro-Guatemalan Organization ({{lang-es|Organización Negra Guatemalteca, ONEGUA}}) in Belize, she met [[Ivan Duran]] of Stonetree Records, who produced the music of [[Andy Palacio]].{{sfn|Arrivillaga Cortés|Savage|2016}}

Through that meeting, Duran was inspired to launch the Garifuna Women's Project, seeking out female performers and recording them.{{sfn|Gurza|2008}} Because the women had not performed professionally before, Duran worked with Blanco and the others recording in venues where they were more comfortable than they were in a recording studio.{{sfn|Galilea|2008}} For ten years, Blanco worked with Duran and Palacio to gather the traditions of Garifuna women in music,{{sfn|Montague|2009}} while continuing her international performance career. In 2006, she participated in the anniversary CD ''Ten Years of Stonetree'' and the following year, performed in the chorus for ''[[Wátina]]'', Palacio's last album.{{sfn|Arrivillaga Cortés|Savage|2016}} In 2008, ''Umalali: The Garifuna Women's Project'' was released by Stonetree and in the United States by the [[Cumbancha|Cumbancha label]].{{sfn|Arrivillaga Cortés|Savage|2016}}{{sfn|Gurza|2008}} Among the songs Blanco performed on the album were "Nibari" (My Grandchild), with lyrics composed by her husband and her own lyrics written for "Yunduya Weyu" (The Sun Has Set).{{sfn|Gurza|2008}} "Nibari" was the opening track of the album and earned Blanco praise as one of the "Garifuna's most accomplished voice(s)" and a comparison by Sarah Weeden of [[National Public Radio]] to the emotional performances of [[Edith Piaf]].{{sfn|Weeden|2008}} To promote the album and pay homage to Palacio, who died unexpectedly that same year, she toured with the Garifuna Collective giving performances in Los Angeles,{{sfn|Gurza|2008}} Belize, and then across Europe for two months.{{sfn|Griffith|2008}} 

The reception of the album, sparked the creation of a band of the same name, ''Umalali'', which was composed of members from Palacio's Garifuna Collective, featuring Blanco, Desere Diego, and Chella Torres, as singers. In 2009, they toured in Canada.{{sfn|Montague|2009}} That same year, Blanco founded in Livingston, ''Iseri Laruga'' (New Dawn), a Garifuna youth music and dance troupe, which performs along the Caribbean coast and in central Guatemala. In 2010, the group was invited to [[Walt Disney World]] near [[Miami]], Florida, to perform and she conducted a workshop on Garifuna music traditions in [[Guatemala City]] for artists from the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Guatemala, and Panama.{{sfn|Arrivillaga Cortés|Savage|2016}} That same year, she toured with ''Umalali'' on a tour that began in Seattle, and held performances in San Diego and Chico, California, before appearing in New Hampshire and culminating in a performance at the Cultural Olympiad for the [[2010 Winter Olympic Games]] in Vancouver.{{sfn|''Ambergris Today''|2010}} In 2011, Blanco collaborated with [[Aurelio Martínez]] on ''Laru Beya'' and was recognized by UNESCO as "cultural ambassador and spokesperson for the Garifuna's musical heritage".{{sfn|Arrivillaga Cortés|Savage|2016}} When she is not touring, she works in the family convenience store in Livingston{{sfn|Frishkey|2016|p=80}} and though she has considered stopping touring,{{sfn|Frishkey|2016|p=272}} she performed in Miami in 2018.{{sfn|''My Lifestyle Magazine''|2018}}
