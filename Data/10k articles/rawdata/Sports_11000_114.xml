It is practiced various disciplines including [[Taekwondo]], [[Tang Soo Do]], [[Wushu (sport)|Wushu]], [[Shaolin (martial arts)|Shaolin Quan]], [[Capoeira]] and some [[Karate]] styles but traditionally most associated with the Korean martial arts. However, the most prominent defining feature is that the same leg is used for taking off, kicking, and landing.The other leg is used to propel the performer into the air, and is then retracted before landing. Many martial arts tricksters choose this move as their first move to attempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yc8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT15&amp;dq=JUMP+INSIDE+ROUNDHOUSE;&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ia-xVOeqNMHUat_ggeAK&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=JUMP%20INSIDE%20ROUNDHOUSE%3B&amp;f=false|title=Black Belt|publisher=Books.google.co.uk|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=stcDAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=black%20belt%201991&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwij66PLpZ3SAhXmIcAKHeCtDwY4ChDoAQgxMAY#v=snippet&amp;q=flying%20kicks&amp;f=false|title=Black Belt|first=Active Interest Media|last=Inc|date=1 February 1991|publisher=Active Interest Media, Inc.|accessdate=20 February 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;



This move has a history in ballet as well, where it is performed as an advanced variation of a 'barrel roll'. Principal male ballet dancers include the move in their variation (solo) as a crowd-pleasing feat of excellence. The move and a variation of it, the reverse 540, has been present in ballet for quite some time now, and is used commonly by dancers such as [[Daniil Simkin]], [[Tetsuya Kumakawa]] and Joseph Phillips. This move has been recently introduced into the world of [[professional wrestling]], where it is commonly referred to as a "jumping corkscrew roundhouse kick".

==Variations==
Like most variations of martial arts kicks, the name of the kick is normally determined by the position of the foot, degree of rotation and positioning of the hips, and any additional kicks that may be added during the execution:

===Fake 540===
A jump turning kick that mimics the 540. The practitioner, already facing he target, jumps up to perform an inside crescent or roundhouse kick, and tucks the other to then land on the kicking foot. This motion does not share the full take off pattern of a true 540.

===540 Crescent===
This variation of the kick is typically found in wushu. The kick is executed as a [[Kick#Crescent kick|crescent kick]], meaning that the toes are pointed forewards with the hips facing the target. If aiming for a target, the target would be hit with the inside of the foot (from the heel to the big toe).

===540 Roundhouse===
This version rotates the hips about 90° more than a crescent before executing the kick. The kick is executed as a [[roundhouse kick]] meaning that a target would be hit with the top of the foot or ankle to avoid breaking the toes. It is also called a Bolley Kick by some in [[TaeKwonDo]], and was popularized in the mid-eighties by [[George Chung]] and [[Steven Ho (martial artist)|Steven Ho]] in open martial art competitions. In [[TaeKwonDo]], a tricking "540" kick refers to this 540 roundhouse, rather than the [[TaeKwonDo]] 540 hook kick.

===Reverse 540===
The take off of this is like a 1-over 360 kick. If back on your right foot, throw it forward counterclockwise, tuck it and push off with your right. Jump up and complete 360 with an outside, counterclockwise crescent kick and land on the same foot. Look at the reverse image of a 540 and you can see it.

===Lazyboy 540 (aka Playboy 540)===
Also referred to as simply a ''Lazyboy'', this version is identical to a typical 540 from a technical standpoint. The defining characteristic is that the hands are placed on the back or top of the head. This pose is to simulate the image of a person relaxing or lying down.  While struck in the air, this variation is performed to show the ease in which they can perform the trick, demonstrating that they don't need the momentum of the arms to complete the trick, and/or to add style to the trick. This trick is also known as the ''Playboy 540'' for its extravagance and confident posture such of a playboy.

===Double leg 540===
This is performed with a take off from both legs and executed with an inside crescent kick.

===Sideswipe===
Though, the body mechanics/technique is different, the Sideswipe and 540 are categorized together because they both use the same leg to take off, kick, and land. This version is similar to a standard 540 kick, but the body is spinning parallel to the ground and can be performed almost inverted. After the non-kicking leg is thrown up in the take-off, the body is leaned back so it is spinning at least horizontally. This kick has less practical use due to the higher levels of agility required.

===540 Hook (c720)===
Also called a "Cheat 720" or a "540 Wheel," the 540 hook uses the same takeoff as mentioned previously. However, instead of using the jumping leg to kick, the performer spins around another 180 degrees and performs a hook kick or outside crescent kick with the other leg, depending on the position of the foot. This kick is one of the variations that actually spins a full 540°. A [[TaeKwonDo]] "540" refers to this kick.

===540 Gyro===
In this move, the user will execute a 540 crescent/roundhouse kick but instead of landing immediately on the kicking leg, the kicker will rotate an additional 360 degrees mid-air before landing. It is rather uncommon in the tricking community due to its difficulty, but is present in martial arts disciplines. It is most prevalent in [[Wushu (sport)|Wushu]].

===540 to Splits===
The traditional 540 can be landed into the splits by sending the kicking leg backwards after the kick as been executed and extending the other leg forward during the landing. Theoretically, almost every trick can be landed in the splits, however, landing some of the more advanced versions of tricks like this would require extra height in the jump, extra rotation of the body, and a very keen sense of timing and spatial awareness.

===Multi-Kick Variants===
Some variants of the 540 include multiple kicks being executed while in the air. Some of those variations are:

====Crescent 540/Feilong====
Not to be confused with the 540 crescent, a crescent 540 is where a crescent kick is thrown out with the first leg before the regular 540 kick is thrown with the other. Both of these kicks are executed mid-air. A variation of this is where the first crescent kick is thrown as a twisted front kick, followed by a round house kick. For this the hips must be rotated more before the kicks are thrown, allowing the feet to be turned towards the targets.

====Jacknife====
This is similar to a crescent 540 in that there are two kicks executed in sequence, however the 540 kick (either crescent or roundhouse) is thrown out first. Immediately following the first kick, the other leg comes around to execute a [[Reverse roundhouse kick|heel kick]] after rotating an additional 180 degrees. The mechanics to this variant are almost identical to a 540-wheel or cheat 720. Proper execution of this involves performing a roundhouse kick instead of an inside crescent kick, with the hips turned over and toes pointed. In doing so, after the first kick is completed, the kicker's hips and body are in a better position to spin around and snap out the hook.

====540 Triple====
This is the combination of a crescent 540 and a jacknife, essentially executing three separate kicks during the same motion. One with the landing leg and two with the other. The kicks and their execution are similar to those of a [[360 Crescent kick#720 kicks|720 triple]]. This move is commonly performed in [[TaeKwonDo]] demonstrations.

The men's ice hockey team participates in the [[Turkish Ice Hockey Super League|Turkish Hockey SuperLig]] (TBHSL) and the women's team in the [[Turkish Ice Hockey Women's League]]. Both teams play out of the [[Ankara Ice Palace]]. The club's colors are orange, navy and white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbhf.org.tr/Kulupler/kul%C3%BCpler.htm |publisher=Türkiye Buz Hokeyi Fedeasyonu |title=Buz Hokeyi Kulüpleri |language=Turkish |accessdate=2011-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208073251/http://tbhf.org.tr/Kulupler/kul%C3%BCpler.htm |archivedate=2009-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The ABBA S.K. was founded in 2005 under the name "Kızıl Kaplan" (literally: Red Tiger). In the second half of the same year, the club was renamed "Buz Kaplanları" (Ice Tigers) due to change of the board. In 2007, the club extended its activities by adding the sports branches of figure skating and roller skating.

The hockey team played in the 2006-2007 season in the Turkish Ice Hockey First League. At the end of the season, it nearly missed the championship, and failed so to advance to the Super League. In the 2007-2008 season, the team became champion of the First League with the help of players transferred from [[Belarus]]. In the 2008-2009 season, ABBA SK men's ice hockey team played in the Super League. The team played in the 2009-2010 season in the second division of Turkish Ice Hockey First League'sGroup A.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbhf.org.tr/puan_durumu/2009_2010_puandurumu/1.lig/1_lig_puan_Agrubu.htm |publisher=Türkiye Buz Hokeyi Fedeasyonu |title=2009-2010 Sezonu 1.

The '''Ajax Experience''' was a [[museum]] dedicated to [[AFC Ajax]]' club history in [[Amsterdam]] in the [[Netherlands]]. The museum, located at the [[Rembrandtplein]], was opened on 24 September 2011 and closed within two years after a 9 million euro loss.

== History ==
On 24 September 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pretwerk.nl/topnieuws/nieuwe-attractie-in-amsterdam-geopend-de-ajax-experience/7086|title=Nieuwe attractie in Amsterdam geopend: De Ajax Experience|author=Pretwerk|accessdate=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ajax Amsterdam opened the Ajax Experience as an attempt to bring the [[World of Ajax]] tour closer to [[Amsterdam-Centrum]]. Designed by [[Sid Lee]] and [[Gsmprjct°]], the Ajax Experience was an interactive experience which shared the philosophy of the club with the public, as well as bring the audience closer to the likes of [[Johan Cruijff]], [[Marco van Basten]] or [[Wesley Sneijder]]. Various national and international trophies that were won by the club over the years were on public display as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afootballreport.com/post/15663048817/the-ajax-experience-x-sid-lee-architecture-aside|title=The Ajax Experience x Sid Lee Architecture|author=A Football Report|accessdate=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; With an estimated 3,5 million to 4,5 million fans in the Netherlands, and even more abroad, the Ajax Experience aimed to cater to the various fans who not only frequent the [[Amsterdam ArenA]] or [[Sportpark De Toekomst]], but also those who are visiting Amsterdam as a tourist destination who are not looking to deviate too far from the trusted central area near by frequented destinations such as  [[Stopera]], [[Joods Historisch Museum]], Tunfun, or [[Natura Artis Magistra|Artis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parool.nl/parool/nl/13/AJAX/article/detail/303402/2010/07/02/Ajax-krijgt-experience-center-in-Amsterdam.dhtml|title=Ajax krijgt 'experience center' in Amsterdam|author=Het Parool|accessdate=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Situated on the famed Rembrandtsplein in Amsterdam-Centrum in a former [[ABN-AMRO]] banking facility, the 1,400 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; space proved to be optimal to provide the needed room to supply an interactive experience which featured cinematic match summaries, while showcasing the overall successes and big names associated with the club on the historic downtown square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parool.nl/parool/nl/13/AJAX/article/detail/2925053/2011/09/23/Ajax-Experience-opent-op-Rembrandtplein.dhtml|title=Ajax Experience opent op Rembrandtplein|author=Het Parool|accessdate=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dissolution==
On 23 July 2013 it was announced that Ajax would discontinue the Ajax Experience, citing a loss in revenue as the cause for the discontinuation of the establishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beurs.nl/nieuws/binnenland/3203889/ajax-stopt-met-verliesgevende-project-ajax-experience|title=Ajax stopt met verliesgevende project Ajax Experience|author=Beurs.NL|accessdate=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World of Ajax]] situated at the stadium would however continue to serve as a touristic function for the club, while the fanshop situated at the same location as the Experience remained open until 1 February 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/telesport/voetbal/ajax/21756118/__Ajax_stopt_met_Ajax_Experience__.html|title=Ajax stopt met Ajax Experience|author=De Telegraaf|accessdate=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club made a reported €9 Million loss over the course of two years through the museum, which resulted in its immediate shutdown only 2 years after its opening day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtlnieuws.nl/economie/home/ajax-verliest-9-miljoen-euro-op-museum|title=Ajax verliest 9 miljoen euro op museum|author=RTL Z|accessdate=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Automobile Competition Committee for the United States''' (ACCUS) is an [[umbrella organization]] of [[auto racing]] [[Sport governing body|sanctioning bodies]] in the [[United States]]. It is the official liaison of U.S. sanctioning bodies to the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]]. It was founded in 1955 to take over FIA representation when the [[American Automobile Association]] withdrew from racing and dissolved the [[AAA Contest Board]].&lt;ref name="Capps 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Capps |first=Don |author2=[[Cameron Argetsinger]] |title=Where Upon Our Scribe, Sherman, &amp; Mr. Peabody Once Again Crank Up The Way-Back Machine for 1961... |journal=AtlasF1 |date=25 October 2000 |volume=6 |series=Rear View Mirror |issue=43 |url=http://atlasf1.autosport.com/2000/mal/mirror.html |accessdate=1 May 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yMmon9p8?url=http://atlasf1.autosport.com/2000/mal/mirror.html |archivedate=1 May 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ACCUS processes international competition licenses for drivers in the U.S. and provides [[Homologation (motorsport)|homologation]] and record keeping. ACCUS is also responsible for the inspection process and the issuance of FIA Historic Technical Passports (HTP) for competitors wishing to take part in International Historic events sanctioned by FIA worldwide.

It is also the third sports building to be built in Uptown, after [[Bank of America Stadium]] (home of the NFL's [[Carolina Panthers]]) and [[Spectrum Center (arena)|Spectrum Center]] (home of the NBA's [[Charlotte Hornets]]).

==History==
An Uptown stadium for the Knights had been a long-running saga in Charlotte, occasionally the subject of contentious debate.  Since the dawn of the new millennium, the Knights had consistently had the worst attendance in the [[International League]].  Their stadium at the time, [[Knights Stadium]], was located in [[Fort Mill, South Carolina]], 30 minutes south of Uptown Charlotte. Many fans were unwilling to brave the traffic on [[Interstate 77]] to get there.

The project had been repeatedly blocked by Jerry Reese, a Charlotte lawyer who claimed the land swap was illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Attorneys Argue Baseball Land Swap Lawsuit In Union County |url=http://www.wsoctv.com/news/16090342/detail.html |work=[[WSOC-TV|WSOC]] |location=Charlotte |date=April 30, 2008 |accessdate=April 30, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501172012/http://www.wsoctv.com/news/16090342/detail.html |archivedate=May 1, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reese had ambitions to move a [[Major League Baseball]] team to Charlotte and viewed a Triple-A sized stadium for the Knights as a detriment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Major League Income Shortfall|first=Erik|last=Spanberg|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/stories/2006/02/06/story1.html|newspaper=[[American City Business Journals|Charlotte Business Journal]]|date=February 6, 2006|accessdate=February 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2006 the stadium became the source of more debate, as [[Mecklenburg County, North Carolina|Mecklenburg County]] commission chairman Parks Helms said he would stall an arts project until the [[City Council of Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte City Council]] looked at a proposal he backed to bring baseball to Uptown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Proposal Links New Stadium, Arts Tax, Helms' Plan Has Some Backing on Board, and Sharp Disagreement|first1=Carrie|last1=Levine|first2=Steven|last2=Brown|first3=Greg|last3=LaCour|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_action=list&amp;p_topdoc=11|newspaper=[[The Charlotte Observer]]|date=August 25, 2006|accessdate=April 22, 2014|page=1A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, it could expand the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]]'s plans to return the [[Atlantic Coast Conference Baseball Tournament]] to Charlotte.  The ACC tournament had been held at Knights Stadium until the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA's]] ban on South Carolina having predetermined championships took effect because of [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] pressure in relation to the boycott of the state by the organization.

Multiple new [[mid-rise]] hotels are expected to open in the area around the new stadium, along with restaurants and retail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Retail, Office Towers, Hotels Top Uptown Charlotte's To-Do List|first=Erik|last=Spanberg|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/blog/queen_city_agenda/2014/02/retail-office-towers-hotels-top-uptown-charlottes.html?page=all|newspaper=[[American City Business Journals|Charlotte Business Journal]]|date=February 4, 2014|accessdate=April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first event held at the ballpark was a media softball game, which took place on March 22, 2014.&lt;ref name="mediasoftball"/&gt; The first Knights game took place on April 11, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Charlotte Knights Announce Date for First Uptown Game at BB&amp;T Ballpark |first=Ben |last=Weinrib |url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2013/07/31/4204751/knights-announce-date-for-first.html |newspaper=[[The Charlotte Observer]] |date=July 31, 2013 |accessdate=August 27, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407065251/http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2013/07/31/4204751/knights-announce-date-for-first.html |archivedate=April 7, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium hosted the 2016 [[Triple-A All-Star Game]] in which the [[International League]] All-Stars defeated the [[Pacific Coast League]] All-Stars, 4–2.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.triple-abaseball.com/ASGSummaries6.jsp|title=Triple-A All-Star Game Results (2013–2017)|publisher=Triple-A Baseball|accessdate=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 31, 2018, Charlotte Knights Chief Operating Officer Dan Rajkowski announced that the Knights will host a total of six college baseball games this season during the [https://www.sunbeltrentals.com/about/ Sunbelt Rentals Collegiate Baseball Series]. This is the most in BB&amp;T Ballpark history.

==Naming rights==

On April 23, 2012, it was announced that [[BB&amp;T]] acquired the naming rights for the new ballpark. The terms of the deal were undisclosed and the ballpark will be officially referred to as BB&amp;T Ballpark indefinitely.&lt;ref name="naming"/&gt;

==Features==

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The stadium features a two-level club with skyline views as well as a VIP, climate-controlled club with full service bar.&lt;ref name="hospitality"&gt;{{cite web |title=Club Seats|url=http://charlotteknightsatuptown.com/partnership-opportunities/hospitality-options/item/37-club-seats|publisher=Charlotte Knights at Uptown|accessdate=July 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In total, there are 975 club seats and 22 luxury suites at the ballpark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=BB&amp;T Ballpark Is Reshaping Charlotte Knights Franchise|first=Erik|last=Spanburg|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/print-edition/2013/07/05/bbt-ballpark-is-reshaping-franchise.html?page=all|newspaper=[[American City Business Journals|Charlotte Business Journal]]|date=July 5, 2013|accessdate=September 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is thought to be slightly friendlier to hitters than typical minor-league parks.  Knights general manager Scotty Smith said that due to the limited lot size, the foul lines are a few feet shorter than minor-league guidelines.

[[Image:Aj check swing.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[A. J. Pierzynski]] of the [[Chicago White Sox]] checks his swing on a low pitch.]]

A '''checked swing''' is a type of motion in [[baseball]] made by a [[batter (baseball)|batter]]. A checked swing occurs when a batter starts to swing his bat at the ball, but stops the swing in order to allow the ball to pass without hitting it. If the swing was indeed checked, so that there was no swing, then if the bat did not touch the ball and if the ball did not go through the [[strike zone]], the [[pitch (baseball)|pitch]] counts as a [[balls and strikes|ball]]; but in that circumstance if the swing was not checked, so that a swing occurred, then the pitch counts as a [[balls and strikes|strike]].

Initially, the home plate [[Umpire (baseball)|umpire]] must determine if a swing was checked or not checked. If he indicates that it was checked, an appeal can be made by the catcher or his manager, and the home plate umpire can then make a request to either the 1st or 3rd base umpire to make the call as to whether the swing was indeed checked.  (To maximize visibility, the 1st base umpire makes the call for right-handed batters, and the 3rd base umpire for left-handed batters.) To indicate a checked swing, the umpire will make a “safe” gesture with his hands; to indicate a full swing, he will clench his fist.

If a ball that passes the batter goes through the strike zone, it is a strike even if a swing is checked. A checked swing sometimes results in an unintentional [[bunt (baseball)|swinging bunt]], where the ball hits the bat and rolls a short distance, although the batter apparently stopped his swing. If a ball is hit during a checked swing, it is in play as long as it is not ruled a foul ball.

The [[Major League Baseball]] rulebook does not contain an official definition for a checked swing, but defines a swing as "an attempt to strike at the ball." It is the decision of the umpire as to whether an attempt was made or not. Generally, factors such as whether the bat passes the front of the plate or the batter pulls his wrists back are considered in the ruling.  Some umpires prefer to use the "breaking the wrists" criterion as the method to decide a checked swing: if the wrists "rolled over", a swing occurred.

Check-swinging can also be used in some warm-up exercises, such as the game [[pepper (baseball)|pepper]].

'''Fernando Enrique Astengo Sánchez''' (born 8 January 1960) is a former [[Association football|footballer]] and current manager.

During his years as footballer he played as [[centre back]], position which was well considered after being featured in [[:es:Equipo Ideal de América|1988's America Ideal Team]]. Despite of his success, in 1989, Astengo was involved in [[El Maracanazo (1990 FIFA World Cup qualification)|Chilean national team scandal at Maracanã]], which alongside keeper [[Roberto Rojas]] and his coach [[:Orlando Aravena]] received a three-year ban by the [[FIFA]].

Upon retiring as a footballer he became a manager starting to work with [[Colo-Colo]] lower divisions, later having a brief spell as first-team caretaker coach in 2008, replacing [[Claudio Borghi]]. However, he left the [[Estadio Monumental David Arellano|Pedreros]]–based team and then had short periods at [[Unión San Felipe]] youth ranks in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cooperativa.cl/fernando-astengo-se-hara-cargo-de-las-divisiones-inferiores-de-union-san-felipe/prontus_nots/2009-09-29/205254.html |title=Fernando Astengo se hará cargo de las divisiones inferiores de Unión San Felipe |publisher=[[La Tercera]] |date=29 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Deportes Temuco]] in 2013.

The '''Junior Dragster''' is a scaled-down version of the [[top fuel]] [[drag racing|dragster]]. Also known as the '''Jr dragster''', it reaches speeds of up to 85&amp;nbsp;mph. The cars were developed in New Zealand in 1988, with classes developed by the New Zealand Hot Rod Association &lt;ref&gt;New Zealand Hot Rod Magazine, August 1988&lt;/ref&gt;. The NHRA began sanctioning the class in 1991, with the JDRL (Junior Drag Racing League).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jrdragster.nhra.com/ |title=NHRA Summit Racing Jr. Drag Racing League |publisher=NHRA |date= |accessdate=2013-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The JDRL is a division of the NHRA, which consists of two different dragster classes, traditional Jr. Dragster having a wheelbase between 90-150 inches and a single-cylinder, five brake horsepower [[Briggs &amp; Stratton]] engine, and the larger Jr. Comp dragster being 150-190 inches in [[wheelbase]] and using a motorcycle or [[personal watercraft]] engine.  Junior drag racers may choose to participate in programs run by the [[NHRA]], [[International Hot Rod Association|IHRA]], or at an unsanctioned facility.  Drivers may be male or female and must be at least five years of age to test, and six years to compete, and be no older than 20 years on December 31 of the competition year (a driver who turns 18 on January 2 is permitted to race in the class until December 31 of the year in question).

The track is 1/8 of a mile, and depending on class, is contested as a [[E.T. bracket race|bracket race]] or a heads-up start on a 5-tenths sportsman tree.  Racers E.T (Elapsed Time) is determined by age.  Drivers age 5 can only test in single-car passes, and can go no faster than 20.00 seconds.  Drivers age 6-7 can go no faster than 13.90 (and must start heads-up), and can officially compete in full competition.  Drivers age 5-7 must use a crate engine from Briggs &amp; Stratton with a [[slide valve]] to reduce power.  Drivers age 8-9 can go no faster than 11.90, 10- to 12-year-olds are limited to 8.90 and 13- to 17-year-olds can go up to 7.90 at 85&amp;nbsp;mph. Drivers 14-20 can race in Jr. Comp, where racers are limited to 6.900 at 109.99 MPH.  Drivers who are 9 as of January 1 can participate in either the 8-9 or 10-12 category once they turn 10 during the year, and drivers who are 12 as of January 1 can participate in the 10-12 or 13-17 category once they turn 13 during the year.  Drivers who turn 14 may run in Jr. Comp.  A driver who turns 18 during the year may stay in Jr. Dragster before jumping to either the adult classes or Jr. Comp. [[File:JRdrag.jpg|thumb|The gap between a slower car and a faster car in a bracket race]]

Jr.Dragsters also compete in a different racing class called 'Outlaw'. This class is run to the 330&amp;nbsp;ft cone of the racing surface. The class runs heads-up on a 4-tenths pro tree. Usually this class is a qualified field, so the teams have to give it all they can just to make the field. While different series rules vary, the main principle is the same. The different series restrict engine combinations and weight packages so that the cars do not exceed the 4.10 time NHRA says is the fastest junior dragsters can run to the 330&amp;nbsp;ft. legally.

[[File:JRIRONMAN.jpg|thumb|Winning the same trophy as the Pro's.]]
Racers compete almost every weekend, running in points series at their home tracks, or in various specialty events with big prizes.  During the course of the year, racers could also attend various division events, or Nationals.  In the NHRA, racers choose between attending the [[NHRA Conference Finals|Eastern]], and the Western Conference Finals.  In the UK there are over thirty racers and still growing.  Though Bracket racing is still the main factor of Jr. drag racing, varieties of heads up racing are also a growing part of this sport. The next step up for Jr. Dragster is Jr. Comp, and then moving into the full size cars.

'''Club Social y Deportivo Escuintleca''', also known as ''Juventud Escuintleca'', is a [[Guatemala]]n [[football club]] based in [[Escuintla]], [[Escuintla Department]]. They play their home games in the [[Estadio Armando Barillas]]. The club won its promotion to the top league after winning 2 first division titles in a row. Immediately after the club won the promotion, the owner decided to fire most of the team including the coach. Bad ownership has led to a last place standing in the current season. The club owner once again fired 5 of its players after a 4–0 defeat to Guatemalan heavyweight [[ CSD Municipal]], which resulted in a 6th player quitting in protest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ligaprimeradivision.com.gt/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=68:dep-escuintleca&amp;catid=15:grupoa&amp;Itemid=5 CLUB SOCIAL Y DEPORTIVO ESCUINTLECA] – LigaPrimeraDivision&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Most recently they have again been playing in the [[Primera División de Ascenso|Primera División]] Group "A" or "B". The club was able to gain promotion to the top Guatemalan league after winning the second and first division championships.

The following are nicknames throughout the history of the [[National Football League]] (NFL).

== Teams and units ==
Nicknames for entire teams, or whole offensive or defensive units.
* '''Ain'ts''':&lt;ref name=Aints&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bishop|first1=Greg|title=Beneath Brown Bags, Saints Had Loyal Fans|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/05/sports/football/05bag.html?_r=0|accessdate=May 25, 2016|work=The New York Times|date=February 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nickname given to the [[New Orleans Saints]] after their [[1980 NFL season|1980 season]] of 14 consecutive losses. The name persisted somewhat as, although they would later qualify for the playoffs several times since then, they did not win a playoff game until their defeat of the defending Super Bowl champion [[St. Louis Rams|Rams]] in the Wild Card round of the [[2000–01 NFL playoffs|2000–01 playoffs]].

(The term itself is likely derived from the title of the team's 1978 [[highlight film]].)
* '''Big Blue''':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsmedia101.com/newyorkgiants/2012/07/08/a-look-back-at-the-many-new-york-giants-handles-aliases-and-nicknames/|title=A look back at the many New York Giant handles, aliases, and nicknames|accessdate=2015-03-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402134945/http://www.sportsmedia101.com/newyorkgiants/2012/07/08/a-look-back-at-the-many-new-york-giants-handles-aliases-and-nicknames/|archivedate=April 2, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; An abridged version of the [[New York Giants]] nickname [[Big Blue Wrecking Crew]]

==Rules named after NFL figures==
Throughout the league's history, a number of rules have been enacted largely because of exploits on the field by a single coach, owner, player, or referee.  The following is a partial list of such rule changes:
*'''[[Sammy Baugh|Baugh]]/[[George Preston Marshall|Marshall]] rule''': A forward pass that struck the goal posts was automatically ruled incomplete. Enacted in [[1946 NFL season|1946]], it is named after [[Washington Redskins]] quarterback Sammy Baugh and team owner George Preston Marshall. In the [[1945 NFL Championship Game|previous year's NFL Championship Game]], the [[1945 Cleveland Rams season|Rams]] scored a [[Safety (football score)|safety]] when Baugh, throwing the ball from his own end zone, hit the goal posts (which were on the goal line between [[1933 NFL season|1933]] and [[1973 NFL season|1973]]). The two points were the margin of victory as the Rams won 15–14. Marshall was so mad at the outcome that he was a major force in passing this rule change. (The rule is now mostly obsolete, as the goal posts are now on the end lines and thus out of the field of play.)
*'''[[Bert Emanuel]] rule''':&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

| accessdate=2006-07-07
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ball can touch the ground during a completed pass as long as the receiver maintains control of the ball. Enacted in [[2000 NFL season|2000]] due to a play in the [[1999–2000 NFL playoffs|1999 NFC championship game]], where Emanuel, playing for the [[1999 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]], had a catch ruled incomplete since the ball touched the ground.
*'''[[Bill Belichick]] rule''':&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

| title=Hair length proposal delayed until May; defensive helmet radios approved

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two defensive players, one primary and one backup, will have a radio device in their helmets allowing the head coach to communicate with them through the radio headset, identical to the radio device inside the helmet of the quarterback. This proposal was defeated in previous years, but was finally enacted in [[2008 NFL season|2008]] as a result of [[2007 National Football League videotaping controversy|Spygate]].
*'''[[Brian Bosworth]] rule''':&lt;ref&gt;[http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/03/25/nfl-passes-brian-bosworth-rule-linebackers-can-now-wear-jerseys-numbered-40-49/ NFL passes "Brian Bosworth rule," linebackers can now wear jerseys numbered 40-49] ''[[Profootballtalk.com]]'' (03/25/2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Linebackers are allowed to wear jersey numbers between 40 and 49. Named for Bosworth, who unsuccessfully sued the NFL, and had himself listed as a safety, to be allowed to wear the number 44 as a linebacker, the rule was passed long after Bosworth's retirement.
*'''[[Bronko Nagurski]] rule''':&lt;ref name="rulesname"&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.footballresearch.com/articles/frpage.cfm?topic=rulesname |title=Rules of the Name, or How The Emmitt Rule Became the Emmitt Rule |publisher=Professional Football Researchers Association |accessdate=2009-03-31 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211145916/http://www.footballresearch.com/articles/frpage.cfm?topic=rulesname |archivedate=2007-12-11 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Enacted in [[1933 NFL season|1933]], forward passing became legal from anywhere behind the line of scrimmage. Enacted in response to a controversial call in the [[1932 NFL Playoff Game]], in which Nagurski completed a two-yard pass to [[Red Grange]] for the [[Chicago Bears]]' winning touchdown. The rule at the time mandated that a forward pass had to be thrown from at least five yards behind the [[line of scrimmage]]. Nagurski appeared to have not dropped back five yards before passing to Grange, but the touchdown stood.
*'''[[Calvin Johnson]] rule''':&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news

|title=Calvin Johnson catch: Another silly NFL rule
|work=SFGate
|accessdate=2012-07-06
}}&lt;/ref&gt; A receiver must maintain possession of the football throughout the completion of the play. This was more precisely a clarification of the existing rules regarding catches, made in [[2010 NFL Season|2010]] in response to a play by Calvin Johnson, who caught the ball in the end zone, and placed it on the ground before standing up. This was ruled incomplete upon review, and upheld, though it generated a lot of discussion about what constituted a catch.
*'''[[Carson Palmer]] rule''':&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2389062 ESPN.com: NFL votes to rein in TD celebrations], by John Clayton. Retrieved on 18 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; A rushing defensive player won't be allowed to forcibly hit a quarterback below the knees, unless they are blocked into. Enacted in the [[2006 NFL season]] after Bengals quarterback Carson Palmer was injured in the 2005 AFC Wild Card game after he was hit below by Steelers defender [[Kimo von Oelhoffen]], as well as similar injuries to the Steelers' [[Ben Roethlisberger]] and the Bucs' [[Brian Griese]].
*'''[[Dave Casper]] rule''': See the "Ken Stabler" rule.
*'''[[Deacon Jones]] rule''':&lt;ref name="rulesname"/&gt; No head-slapping. Enacted in [[1977 NFL season|1977]] in response to the defensive end's frequently used technique against opponents.
*'''[[Deion Sanders]] rule''':&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | url=http://static.espn.go.com/nfl/trainingcamp01/s/2001/0720/1228997.html

Enacted after Sanders signed with the [[1995 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] in [[1995 NFL season|1995]] for a minimum salary and a $13 million signing bonus. (There is also a college football rule with this nickname.)
*'''[[Ed Hochuli]] rule''':&lt;ref&gt;

| title=NFL adopts 'Hochuli rule' to make loose balls reviewable
| accessdate=2009-11-30
| work=USA Today
| date=March 26, 2009
}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Instant replay in American and Canadian football|Instant replay]] can be used to determine whether a loose ball from a passer is definitely a fumble or an incomplete pass. This was enacted in [[2009 NFL season|2009]] in response to a play in the [[2008 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]] – [[2008 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] Week 2 [[2008 NFL season|regular season]] game where, in the final minutes, referee [[Ed Hochuli]] ruled that Broncos quarterback [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]] threw an incomplete pass. Replays clearly showed it was a fumble, but the play was previously not reviewable.
*'''[[Emmitt Smith]] rule''':&lt;ref name="rulesname"/&gt; A player cannot remove his helmet while on the field of play, except in the case of obvious medical difficulty. A violation is treated as unsportsmanlike conduct. Enacted in [[1997 NFL season|1997]]. The Dallas Cowboys running back was the most high-profile player who celebrated in this manner immediately after scoring a touchdown.
*'''[[Fran Tarkenton]] rule''':&lt;ref name="rulesname"/&gt; A line judge was added as the sixth official to ensure that a back was indeed behind the line of scrimmage before throwing a forward pass. Enacted in [[1965 NFL season|1965]] in response to Tarkenton, who frequently scrambled around in the backfield from one side to the other.
*'''[[Greg Pruitt]] rule''':&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tear-away jerseys became illegal starting in [[1979 NFL season|1979]]. Pruitt purposely wore flimsy jerseys that ripped apart in the hands of would-be tacklers. Such a jersey was most infamously seen in a [[1978 NFL season|1978]] game between the [[1978 Los Angeles Rams season|Rams]] and [[1978 Houston Oilers season|Oilers]] in which [[Earl Campbell]]'s jersey ripped apart after several missed tackles.
*'''[[Hines Ward]] rule''':&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blocking rule makes illegal a blindside block if it comes from the blocker's helmet, forearm or shoulder and lands to the head or neck area of the defender. Enacted in [[2009 NFL season|2009]] after the [[2008 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]] receiver broke [[2008 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati]] linebacker [[Keith Rivers]]'s jaw while making such a block during the previous season.
*'''[[Jerome Bettis]] rule''':&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enacted in [[1999 NFL season|1999]], the rule states all calls for coin flips will occur ''before'' the referee tosses the coin in the air, and at least two officials will be present during the coin toss.  This is in response to a call considered one of the "worst in history."&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving Day game]] with the [[1998 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]] on [[1998 NFL season|November 26, 1998]], Bettis was sent out as the [[1998 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers]]' representative for the overtime coin toss. Bettis appeared to call "tails" while the coin was in the air but referee [[Phil Luckett]] declared that Bettis called "heads" and awarded possession to Detroit, who would go on to win the game before Pittsburgh had the chance to have possession.

This change was prompted after the 2012 [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving Day]] game when [[2012 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]]' head coach [[Jim Schwartz]] threw a challenge flag on a play where replay clearly showed [[2012 Houston Texans season|Houston Texans]]' running back [[Justin Forsett]]'s knee touched the ground, but was able to get up and score a touchdown. Due to the way the rule was written at the time the penalty for the errant challenge prevented the play from being reviewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Garafolo |first=Mike |title=Giants owner wants challenge rule reviewed (and changed) |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2012/11/23/giants-owner-wants-challenge-rule-reviewed/1722689/ |accessdate=March 26, 2014 |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=November 23, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OMekfIgZ?url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2012/11/23/giants-owner-wants-challenge-rule-reviewed/1722689/ |archivedate=March 26, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the revised rule teams will be charged a time-out (or an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty if the team is out of time-outs) when a coach throws a challenge flag on a booth-reviewable play, but the play will still be reviewed if the replay booth believes a review is necessary.&lt;ref name="2013Rules"&gt;{{cite web|title=2013 Official Playing Rules of the National Football League |url=https://www.nfl.info/download/2012MediaGuides/2013%20NFL%20Rule%20Book.pdf |publisher=[[National Football League]] |accessdate=March 26, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OMcIEBER?url=https://www.nfl.info/download/2012MediaGuides/2013%20NFL%20Rule%20Book.pdf |archivedate=March 26, 2014 |format=PDF |year=2013 |page=3 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Jimmy Graham]] rule''': Effective the [[2014 NFL season]], the action of "dunking" the football through the goal post/crossbar as a prop in touchdown celebrations is now considered an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty (15 yards).  This rule was in response to Graham's tendency to dunk the football after scores while playing for the [[New Orleans Saints]]. One of his dunks during the Saints' 2013 Week 12 [[Thursday Night Football]] game against the [[Atlanta Falcons]] bent the goal posts so much that the game was delayed several minutes in order for the stadium crew to make adjustments. Additionally, the league extended the height of the goal posts from 30 to 35 feet, adding extra weight and therefore increasing the chances that it could collapse.
*'''[[Justin Tucker]] rule''': First named during the controversial [[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]] game between the [[Baltimore Ravens]] and [[New England Patriots]] in Week 3 of the 2012 season (one of the most memorable games that took place during the [[2012 NFL referee lockout]]), commonly referred to simply as the "Tucker Rule," and named after Baltimore kicker Justin Tucker, this rule states that if the ball is kicked directly over one of the posts during a field goal attempt, then the field goal is deemed good. This is, indeed, what happened during the game, as Tucker made a successful kick like this on the final play of the game.
*'''[[Ken Stabler]] rule''':&lt;ref name="rulesname"/&gt; On fourth down at any time in the game or any down in the final two minutes of a half, if a player fumbles forward, only the fumbling player can recover and/or advance the ball. If that player's teammate recovers the ball, it is placed back at the spot of the fumble. A defensive player can recover and advance at any time of play. Enacted in [[1979 NFL season|1979]] in response to the [[1978 NFL season|1978]] "[[Holy Roller (American football)|Holy Roller]]" play that resulted in a last-minute game-winning touchdown over [[1978 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego]], in which [[1978 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] quarterback Stabler fumbled the ball forward, and tight end [[Dave Casper]] eventually performed a soccer-like dribble before falling on it in the end zone.
*'''[[Lester Hayes]] rule''':&lt;ref name="rulesname"/&gt; No [[Stickum]] allowed. Enacted in [[1981 NFL season|1981]] in response to the [[Oakland Raiders]] defensive back, who used the sticky substance to improve his grip.
*'''[[Lou Groza]] rule''':&lt;ref name="rulesname"/&gt; No artificial medium to assist in the execution of a kick. Enacted in [[1956 NFL season|1956]] in response to Groza, who used tape and later a special tee with a long tail to help him guide his foot to the center spot of the football.
*'''[[Mel Blount]] rule''':&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officially known as ''illegal contact downfield'', defensive backs can only make contact with receivers within five yards of the line of scrimmage. Enacted in its current form in [[1978 NFL season|1978]]. While playing for the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], defensive back Blount frequently used physical play against receivers he was covering.
*'''[[Mel Renfro]] rule''':&lt;ref name="rulesname"/&gt; Allows a second player on the offense to catch a tipped ball, without a defender subsequently touching it. Enacted in [[1978 NFL season|1978]]. One of the first high-profile "victims" of the old rule was [[1970 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] defensive back Renfro in [[Super Bowl V]]; his tip of a pass allowed the [[1970 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore Colts]]' [[John Mackey (American football)|John Mackey]] to legally catch the ball and run in for a 75-yard touchdown.
*'''[[NaVorro Bowman]] rule''':&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, Jim (March 27, 2014).

''USA Today''. Retrieved March 27, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Enacted in [[2014 NFL season|2014]], this rule subjects plays in which a loose ball has been recovered to [[instant replay]].

*'''[[Odell Beckham Jr.]] rule''': Any player who accumulates two [[unsportsmanlike conduct]] penalties in a game is automatically ejected. The original draft of the proposed rule would have counted ''any'' two personal fouls toward ejection and drew its name from Beckham, who committed three personal fouls during a game in the [[2015 NFL season|2015 season]].

It was initially ruled by the officials as "no good", but was reversed "upon discussion".

Enacted in [[1977 NFL season|1977]]. Dempsey, who was born without toes on his right foot and no right arm, wore a modified shoe with a flattened and enlarged toe surface, generating controversy about whether such a shoe gave him an unfair advantage kicking field goals.

To this day one can notice the moniker "THE DUKE." branded into every official NFL football just to the left of the NFL Shield.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21472">This is a '''list of baseball players who went directly to the major leagues'''.  They are distinguished as a group by the fact that they made their North American professional debut with a [[Major League Baseball]] franchise without previously having played at the [[Professional baseball|professional]] level (excluding fall leagues and winter leagues), such as [[Minor league baseball|minor league]] affiliates of major league teams, the [[Negro league baseball|Negro Leagues]], [[Baseball in Japan|Japanese professional leagues]], or independent professional teams.

After their major league debuts, many of these players played in professional leagues other than Major League Baseball. Included are the ''Bonus Babies'', who joined major league rosters from 1947 to 1957 and from 1962 to 1965 under the [[Bonus Rule]].

In recent years, the practice of players going directly into the majors has become rare: it has only occurred eight times since 1980, and only twice since 2000.

== Players ==

&lt;!--Please do not add Japanese players who played in Nippon Professional Baseball before coming to the United States since they do not meet the criteria for inclusion as stated in the lead paragraph of this article. --&gt;

The '''National Football Museum''' is England’s national museum of [[Football in England|football]]. It is based in the [[Urbis]] building in [[Manchester]] city centre, and preserves, conserves and displays important collections of [[association football|football]] memorabilia. As a publicly funded national museum, entrance is free.

The museum was originally based in [[Deepdale]], [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], [[Lancashire]], but moved to Manchester in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-manchester-18725667|title=Why football museum moved to Manchester|last=Airey|first=Tom|date=2012-07-06|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-11-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Finney.jpg|thumb|left|Statue recreating the famous [[Tom Finney]] "Splash" photo outside the old National Football Museum.]]
The idea for what became the National Football Museum goes back to 1994 when Baxi Partnership, a local company, acquired Preston North End Football Club (PNE) and began the redevelopment of Deepdale Stadium. A chance conversation between Bryan Gray, Chairman of PNE, and the Football League, led to a meeting with Harry Langton, the man who over thirty years put together what is now called the FIFA Museum Collection. FIFA recognised the importance of the collection and acquired it from Harry Langton with a view to finding a permanent home. FIFA saw the proposed museum at Preston as an ideal permanent location for the FIFA Museum Collection.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Bryan Gray formed a small team of people to work on the project including Keith Cooper of FIFA, David Fleming, Director of Tyne and Wear Museums, Brian Booth, formerly Vice Chancellor of the University of Central Lancashire, and Chris Newbery, director of the Royal Marines Museum in Portsmouth. The Football Association was represented by David Davies. The National Football Museum was incorporated as a private limited company in June 1995 and became a registered charity in November 1995.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

After much hard work, an application to the Heritage Lottery Fund was successful and a grant of £7.5m was awarded in November 1997. The total project cost was estimated at £12m. A ground breaking ceremony took place on 26 September 1998 by Sepp Blatter of FIFA with the Rt Hon Chris Smith in attendance. The foundation stone was laid by Bryan Gray and Ben Casey (who had persuaded Baxi to buy PNE) in April 2000. Finally the National Football Museum was officially opened on 21 June 2001 by HRH The Duke of Kent. Bryan Gray, the founding chairman of trustees, stood down in September 2001 to be succeeded by Brian Booth.

Rob Pratten was the first employee of the Football Museum: he joined the team in May 1995 and for some time was the only employee. Kevin Moore was appointed Director in August 1997 and was later joined by Mark Bushell, Hugh Hornby and Lindsey Jones. The museum's first site was outside [[Deepdale]], [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], [[Lancashire]]. Deepdale was particularly significant as it is the oldest continuously used football league ground in the world.&lt;ref name="Open" /&gt; The museum's president is [[1966 World Cup final|World Cup winner]] [[Bobby Charlton|Sir Bobby Charlton]].

In 2003 the museum and the [[University of Central Lancashire]] established the [[International Football Institute]] to conduct research into historical, social and cultural aspects of football.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=International Football Institute |publisher=University of Central Lancashire |url=http://www.uclan.ac.uk/schools/ssto/research/international_football_institute.php |accessdate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a visit in  2004, [[Sepp Blatter]], President of [[FIFA]] commented  "''The National Football Museum merits my admiration as a footballer and as the President of FIFA — it is a superb realisation, a real jewel!''".  Sir Bobby Charlton commented that he ''“can’t think of a better museum anywhere in the world.”'' and [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]] "''Each time I visit the Museum I am so impressed by the great job it does in bringing the rich history of football to life''".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=A step back in time |url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/news/newsid=752588/index.html |date=25 April 2008 |accessdate=8 July 2012 |publisher=FIFA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum received the award of Large Visitor Attraction of the Year, at the 2005 Lancashire and Blackpool Tourism Awards&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Football museum's expansion plan  |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/lancashire/5149092.stm |date=5 July 2006 |accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2008, chairman of the [[Football League]], [[Brian Mawhinney]] caused controversy when he suggested that the Museum should be moved from Preston to [[Wembley Stadium]] in order to attract more visitors.&lt;ref name="NS" /&gt;
Founder Kevin Moore, stated that it had been an aim to have an exhibition at Wembley, but stated that the trustee's policy was to have its headquarters in Preston.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.culture24.org.uk/history+%26+heritage/art63465 |title=National Football Museum Vows To Pick Preston Over Wembley |publisher=Culture 24 |date=16 December 2008 |accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Minister backs city's claim to football museum |newspaper=Lancashire Evening Post |date=26 December 2008 |url=http://www.lep.co.uk/news/local/minister-backs-city-s-claim-to-football-museum-1-85013 |accessdate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite critical acclaim and attracting 100,000 visitors per year,&lt;ref name="NS"&gt;{{citation |title=Hands off, Wembley |newspaper=New Statesman |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/sport/2009/03/football-museum-preston |first=Hunter |last=Davies |date=12 March 2009 |accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=MPs fight moving football museum |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/lancashire/7780288.stm |date=12 December 2008 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |newspaper=Lancashire Evening Post |title=Manchester United legend: Museum should stay in Preston |url=http://www.lep.co.uk/news/local/manchester-united-legend-museum-should-stay-in-preston-1-98129 |date=9 September 2009 |accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; funding was repeatedly an issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/lancashire/4094452.stm |title=Football Museum jobs under threat |publisher=BBC News |date=15 June 2005 |accessdate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Football museum 'needs more cash' |publisher= BBC News |accessdate=8 July 2012 |date=23 January 2007 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/lancashire/6289689.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, it had an income of £791,256 against out-goings of £1,231,195.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/1135614_national_football_museum_moves_to_manchester |first=David |last=Ottewell |title=National Football Museum moves to Manchester |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |date=8 September 2009 |accessdate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trustees were concerned about the museum's long-term future. In 2009, they approached Manchester City Council about moving the museum.  The city council offered a funding package worth £2m per year for the museum to move to Manchester. Despite an improved offer of £400,000 per year from [[City of Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] and [[Lancashire]] councils, the trustees voted to move the museum to the [[Urbis]] exhibition centre in [[Manchester]].&lt;ref name="MEN18Nov2009"&gt;{{citation |title=National Football Museum to move to Urbis |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/1182980_national_football_museum_to_move_to_urbis |date=18 November 2009 |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |accessdate=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was intended that subject to satisfactory funding, the Preston site would remain open as a secondary centre.&lt;ref name="MEN18Nov2009"/&gt;  However, the museum failed to agree a funding package with Lancashire County Council and the Preston site closed to the public at the end of April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=National Football Museum closes its doors in Preston |publisher=BBC News |date=1 May 2010 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/lancashire/8655373.stm |accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=National Football Museum in Preston to close |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/lancashire/8630976.stm |date=19 April 2010 |accessdate=7 July 2012 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, the Preston site is still used as a research and storage centre.&lt;ref name="Open"/&gt;

Urbis closed in February 2010 in preparation for an intended opening of the new National Football Museum in summer 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Manchester's Urbis closes to become football museum |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/8540418.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 February 2010 |accessdate=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum reopened in Manchester on 6 July 2012. It is hoped that the new museum will attract 350,000 visitors per year.&lt;ref name="Open"&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-18725667 |publisher=BBC News |date=6 July 2012 |title=National Football Museum opens at new Manchester home |first=Tom |last=Airey |accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported in August 2012 that the new National Football Museum attracted over 100,000 visitors in the first six weeks of opening.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Museum welcomes 100,000th visitor |url=http://www.nationalfootballmuseum.com/about-us/latest-news/2012/08/museum-welcomes-100000th-visitor/ |work=National Football Museum |date=21 August 2012 |accessdate=27 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010091630/http://www.nationalfootballmuseum.com/about-us/latest-news/2012/08/museum-welcomes-100000th-visitor/ |archivedate=10 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of April 2013, the museum reached its 350,000 target.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Back of the net: National Football Museum smashes targets for visitors |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/national-football-museum-urbis-manchester-3158075 |work=Manchester Evening News |date=26 April 2013 |accessdate=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
Many exhibits are loaned to museums in the UK and artifacts have been loaned to exhibitions in Germany, Portugal, Switzerland and Belgium. The museum has worked in partnership with UEFA to create the UEFA Jubilee Exhibition, which opened in the European Parliament in Brussels, before moving to the National Football Museum. The museum also worked with UEFA to create the world’s first exhibition dedicated to women’s football, to coincide with the UEFA Euro 2005 Women’s Championship. To mark the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] the museum worked with partners to develop exhibitions in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Germany]]. A special exhibition "Saved for the Nation: The Story of the FA Cup" which featured the oldest surviving [[FA Cup trophy]], used during FA Cup Finals between 1896 and 1910, was launched in May 2006. 

The museum's temporary exhibitions programme has also included "One for All: All for One", a photographic exhibition highlighting the work of Philip Colvin, documenting the experiences and challenges of disabled [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] supporter Samuel Burch as he travelled across the country in support of his team); and "The Greater Game: Football and The First World War", exploring the role football played at home and at the front during the war years, and explores the myths and reality of famous stories from the conflict, including a previously unseen diary detailing the events of the famous [[Christmas Truce]] of 1914, as well as lost footage from the front and of wartime football.

The '''Neal S. Blaisdell Center''' near [[downtown Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]] is a community center for the [[Honolulu County, Hawaii|City &amp; County of Honolulu]].&lt;ref name="HonCDPMap"&gt;"[http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/MapItDrawServlet?geo_id=16000US1517000&amp;_bucket_id=50&amp;tree_id=420&amp;context=saff&amp;_lang=en&amp;_sse=on Honolulu CDP, HI]." ''[[U.S. Census Bureau]]''. Retrieved on May 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Constructed in 1964 on the historic Ward Estate and originally called the '''Honolulu International Center''', the center was renamed after [[Mayor of Honolulu]] [[Neal S. Blaisdell]], who oversaw its construction.&lt;ref name="50anniversary"/&gt;  The multi-purpose complex is composed of an internationally renowned arena, concert hall, conference rooms, galleria and exhibition hall.  It was remodeled and expanded in 1994. The complex is overseen by the City's Department of Enterprise Services which also oversees the [[Waikiki Shell]]. The City is seeking to redevelop the site with extensive stakeholder and public involvement to assess the community’s goals.  Implementation of this plan will require significant investment by the City and its partners over the coming years, and the outcome will be an iconic symbol of the City and County of Honolulu.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.honolulu.gov/tod/dpp-tod-implementation/dpp-tod-projects/dpp-tod-blaisdell.html|title=Blaisdell Center|website=www.honolulu.gov|access-date=2016-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities and events==
===Arena===
[[File:Blaisdell Arena - Honolulu 10-Feb-2010.jpg|thumb|Blaisdell Arena|200px|left]]
The '''Neal S. Blaisdell Arena''' is a circular performance facility used for concerts and major sporting events.  The arena can accommodate 7,700 seats for sports events, and up to 8,800 seats for stage events with seats set up on the arena floor.

[[Elvis Presley]]'s "[[Aloha from Hawaii]]" concert was held here on January 14, 1973. In recognition of the concert, a bronze statue of Elvis was installed in 2007 outside the front of the arena. The statue was sponsored by the cable channel [[TV Land]].&lt;ref&gt;http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2007/Jul/26/br/br7634109285.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Other events at the arena include [[WWE]], [[Disney on Ice]], [[American Idol]] Live!, [[Sesame Street Live]], college [[basketball]] and [[volleyball]], and international [[gymnastics]], as well as a fundraising concert for victims of Hurricane Iniki, with [[Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash]], [[Jackson Browne]] &amp; [[Bonnie Raitt]], and a 1965 [[Billy Graham]] crusade.

Other music artists that have performed at the arena include [[Mariah Carey]], [[Metallica]], [[Aerosmith]], [[Van Halen]], [[Bon Jovi]], [[Elton John]], [[Journey (band)|Journey]], [[Santana (band)|Santana]] and [[Bruno Mars]].

During a circus performance in 1994, Tyke, an African Elephant, killed her trainer and charged out of the arena in rage. The animal rampaged outside the arena for 30 minutes before police fired 86 rounds at the elephant, who eventually collapsed and died as a result of the shootings.

The Philippine TV show [[ASAP (TV series)|ASAP]] performed at the Neal S. Blaisdell Arena on June 30, 2018 through an international concert titled ASAP Live in Honolulu.

===Sports===
The Arena also hosts the start of the exhibition season for the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] and the men's and women's basketball and volleyball games for [[Hawaii Pacific University]], the state's largest private university. It served as the home court for [[University of Hawaii at Manoa|University of Hawai{{okina}}i at Mānoa]] basketball until UH built the [[Stan Sheriff Center]] on campus in 1994. The arena was the home venue for several short-lived attempts to establish Hawaii professional sports teams, including the [[Billings Volcanos|Hawaii Volcanos]] of the [[Continental Basketball Association]], the Hawaii Hurricanes of the [[American Basketball Association (2000-)|American Basketball Association]], the [[Hawaii Leis]] of [[World Team Tennis]] and three indoor football teams: the [[Honolulu Hurricanes]], the [[Hawaii Hammerheads]], and the [[af2]]'s [[Hawaiian Islanders]]. The Leis and Islanders each persisted for three full seasons, the longest of all the pro teams based at the arena. In 1982, the arena served as home court for [[Chaminade Silverswords|Chaminade University]] in a Christmas Eve [[1982 Virginia vs. Chaminade men's basketball game|upset]] of a [[Ralph Sampson]]-led number one ranked [[1982–83 Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball team|University of Virginia]], 77-72.

In November 2006, the [[Professional Bull Riders]] hosted the Cheeseburger Island Style PBR Hawaii All-Star Challenge, a special event that took place between the 2006 PBR World Finals and the start of the 2007 PBR season.

Many graduation and commencement ceremonies are held by schools in the arena and concert hall in late May and June.

The arena also hosts the [[WWE]]'s flagship shows, ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' and ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown LIVE]]'' for two nights, starts from June 25 to 26, 2018.

===Concert Hall===
[[File:Blaisdell Concert Hall - Honolulu 10-Feb-2010.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Blaisdell Concert Hall]]
With a capacity of 2,158 seats, the '''Neal S. Blaisdell Concert Hall''' is the home of the [[Honolulu Symphony]] and the [[Hawaii Opera Theatre|Hawai{{okina}}i Opera Theatre]].  [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] productions such as ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'', ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]'', ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'', ''[[Miss Saigon]]'', ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]'', ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'', and other national touring shows have performed at the concert hall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blaisdellcenter.com/venues/concerthall.html "Neal S. Blaisdell - Venues - Concert Hall" at BlaisdellCenter.com]. Retrieved 10 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In the fall and early winter of 2007 the concert hall was host to the Broadway musical ''[[The Lion King (musical)|The Lion King]]'', a booking which displaced the Honolulu Symphony from its usual home and led to a major cash flow crisis for the orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;Westphal, Matthew. [http://www.playbillarts.com/news/article/7518.html "Honolulu Symphony Runs Out of Money to Pay Musicians", ''Playbill Arts'', 20 December 2007]. Retrieved 10 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exhibition Hall===
[[File:Blaisdell Exhibition Hall.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Inside the Blaisdell Exhibition Hall]]
Located between the Concert Hall and the Arena, the Exhibition Hall provides {{convert|65000|sqft|m2}} of exhibition space on the main floor that is expandable to {{convert|85000|sqft|m2}} when combined with adjoining spaces.  Five meeting rooms are also available in the hall.  The Exhibition Hall accommodates numerous local trade and consumer shows and fundraising events throughout the year, and is one of the main exhibition venues in Honolulu in addition to the [[Hawaii Convention Center]].

The Exhibition Hall hosts events throughout the year such as craft fairs, gun shows, family expos, job fairs, food &amp; product shows, as well as private tradeshows.

===Miscellaneous===
Many religious ceremonies have been performed in the Neal S. Blaisdell Center.  The largest of which were the enthronement of [[Joseph Anthony Ferrario]] as the third [[Roman Catholic Bishop of Honolulu|Bishop of Honolulu]] and the ordination and installation of [[Clarence Richard Silva]] as the fifth Bishop of Honolulu, overseeing the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu]]. [[Kamehameha Schools]] has held their annual [[Kamehameha Schools Song Contest|Song Contest]] at the Blaisdell since 1964. On December 23, 1982, what is considered by many as the greatest upset in sports history happened at the Blaisdell Arena as the then number 1-ranked [[University of Virginia]] [[1982–83 Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball team|Cavaliers]], led by future [[List of players in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Ralph Sampson]], were beaten 77-72 by [[Chaminade Silverswords|Chaminade University]], a small [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]] school (today [[NCAA Division II]]) with a student body of 800.

'''North Greenwich''' was a [[association football|football]] ground and the home of [[Millwall Athletic F.C.|Millwall Athletic Football Club]] from 1901–1910, the team who went on to become [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]].{{sfn|Tarrant|Lindsay|2010|page=19}} It was situated on the [[Isle of Dogs]], [[East London]].

==History==
Millwall Athletic were forced to leave their third ground, [[The Athletic Grounds]] after the Millwall Dock Company told them they wanted to use it as a timberyard. The last game at the Athletic Grounds was a 4–0 win over [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] on 27 April 1901 in the [[Western Football League|Western League]].{{sfn|Tarrant|Lindsay|2010|page=264}} Millwall relocated for the start of the 1901–02 season to a location near their second home, which became known as North Greenwich.{{sfn|Lindsay|1991|pages=32–33}}

Their first game at North Greenwich was against [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] on 21 September 1901, which they lost 2–3. The Game was watched by 6,000 people.{{sfn|Tarrant|Lindsay|2010|page=266}} Coincidentally, the last game played on the Isle of Dogs on 8 October 1910 was against the same team, Portsmouth. This time Millwall won 3–1.{{sfn|Lindsay|1991|page=176}} Due to lack of expansion space in the [[Millwall]] area of East London, Millwall moved to [[South London]] in 1910 and into their ground, [[The Den (defunct stadium)|The Den]].

==Attendances==
The record attendance at North Greenwich was 16,285 in the [[FA Cup]], in a 1–0 win against [[Woolwich Arsenal F.C.|Woolwich Arsenal]] on 10 February 1909 in a Second round replay.{{sfn|Tarrant|Lindsay|2010|page=280}}

A '''one percenter''' ('''1%er''') is a statistic kept in [[Australian rules football]], and relates to a variety of actions which benefit the team, but are infrequent or defensive.

==History==
It has been standard for a long time for a coach to tell his team to "keep doing the one percenters," and this essentially meant that players should keep applying pressure on opponents, by doing the little extra efforts which make turnovers more likely. They have always been seen as the "little extra effort" which went unrewarded on the statistics, and they received the name "one percenter" to represent this. They may not individually affect the outcome of the game, but collectively they can, hence they are regarded as a percentage of the overall performance of the team.  Coaches have always liked to see their teams put in the effort and get plenty of one percenters, and the captains and spiritual leaders of teams are most often skilful players with the most one percenters. At the beginning of the 21st century, one percenters were officially recognised as a statistic. In 2007, the [[AFL Army Award]] was struck to reward, among other defensive skills, one percenters.

==Definition==
There are four actions which constitute a one percenter according to official [[Australian Football League|AFL]] statistics: knock-ons, spoils, smothers, and shepherds.

===Knock-ons===
A '''knock-on''' is using the hand, either clenched or open, to tap the ball to the advantage of a team-mate, without ever taking possession of the football (except out of the ruck). It has the same advantage as a quick handpass or kick, but is not recognised as a disposal because the player never has possession.

===Spoil===
A '''spoil''' is preventing an opposition player from taking clean possession of a pass from a team-mate. This is most usually done by punching the ball away from the contest. In the 2011 semi-final against [[Sydney Swans|Sydney]], [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] defender [[Joshua Gibson (footballer)|Josh Gibson]] compiled an AFL record 21 spoils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Macgugan|first=Mark|title=Hawk defenders have no fear|url=http://www.hawthornfc.com.au/news/2011-09-17/hawk-defenders-have-no-fear|accessdate=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smother===
[[File:Australian football smother.jpg|thumb|A player in red preparing to try and smother the kick from the player in blue]]
A '''smother''' is the act of using the arms or body to get in the way of an opponent's kick, as it leaves the player's boot. A player who smothers the ball is generally seen diving across in front of the kicking player, hoping to trap the ball as it is kicked. Smothers sometimes lead to turn-overs, but not always.

===Shepherd===
{{main|Shepherding (Australian rules football)}}
A '''shepherd''' is the legal act of preventing an opponent from obtaining the ball or tackling a team-mate.

==Other one percenters==
There are other defensive efforts and supporting actions which are not statistically recognised as one percenters. However, when coaches refer to one percenters, these actions are often also considered.

===Chase===
A '''chase''' is the act of making a long pursuit behind an opponent who is running with and bouncing the ball, even if he never catches up and tackles his opponent. A chase puts pressure on the opponent to kick while running quickly and/or while unstable, decreasing the likely accuracy of the kick. Hence, coaches will consider a chase to be a one percenter.

===Hurry===
'''Hurrying''' (or corralling) an opponent is the act of putting them off balance without laying a tackle, while he is taking his kick or handpass. Like the chase, this increases the likelihood of a turnover, and is often considered to be a one percenter.

===Bump===
[[File:Bump womens football.jpg|thumbnail|150px|A strong and legal bump to gain possession of the ball.]]

:See [[Bump (football)]]
A '''bump''' or '''hip and shoulder''' is the act of using the side of the body and running into an opponent with force - under some circumstances. The bump is a type of strong shepherd, but players can also legally bump their opponents out of the way as they run to collected the ball. A bump to an opponent is legal, provided the bump does not ride high and contact an opponent's head. A bump in the back is illegal under the "push in the back".

===Block===
A '''block''' or '''screen''' is a more subtle way to shepherd in a marking contest, and while it is often technically illegal, it will almost never be penalised. The most common way to block is to run between a leading forward and his pursuing opponent, slowing down the defender so that the forward will take his mark uncontested.

The '''Oregon Riptide''' was the name chosen for an [[American Basketball Association (21st century)|American Basketball Association (ABA)]] franchise which was to be based in [[Portland, Oregon]].  In May, 2006, founding team owner, Jeremy "J" Brice, of [[Salem, Oregon|Salem]], had gained ABA approval, opened a front office in downtown Portland, and announced its staff.&lt;ref name="ABA1"&gt;{{cite press release | title = Oregon Riptide announce web site and front office | publisher=American Basketball Association | date = May 4, 2006 | url = http://www.abalive.com/news/releases/?newsid=2006050406001 | accessdate =November 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A May 27 free agent camp was held to recruit an initial roster of players.&lt;ref name="ABA2"&gt;{{cite press release | title = Oregon Riptide free agent camp crucial | publisher=American Basketball Association | date = May 8, 2006 | url = http://www.abalive.com/news/releases/?newsid=2006050806006 | accessdate =November 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brice arranged with [[Warner Pacific College]] for arena facilities for a summer youth basketball camp to be sponsored by the team, and for the competitive season to have begun in November, 2006.&lt;ref name="pdxtrib1"&gt;{{cite news |last = Vondersmith |first = Jason |title = Basketball team owner's past could derail dream |publisher=[[Portland Tribune]] |date = July 13, 2006 |url = http://www.portlandtribune.com/news/story.php?story_id=115284969806224900 |accessdate =February 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He had even contracted with the Jupiter Hotel to house visiting team members.&lt;ref name="ABA3"&gt;{{cite press release | title = Oregon Riptide partners with Jupiter Hotel | publisher=American Basketball Association | date = May 22, 2006 | url = http://www.abalive.com/news/releases/?newsid=2006052206001 | accessdate =November 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plans for the youth camp were quickly cancelled in July, 2006, following an article revealing that Brice, a Nevada native who had served as a high school and youth league coach, was a registered sex offender in both [[California]] and Oregon.  As a result, he could not have unsupervised contact with girls under 18, except for his daughter.  Warner Pacific, a Christian college affiliated with the conservative [[Church of God (Anderson)]], withdrew availability of their facilities.&lt;ref name="pdxtrib1"/&gt;

Brice sold the franchise to [[Christopher Sears]] less than a week later, telling a reporter for the ''Tribune,'' "I am no longer associated with the Riptide due to the negativity and black cloud over my name."  The league approved the transfer, and Joe Newman, ABA CEO, stated that the team would still play in the 2006 season.&lt;ref name="pdxtrib2"&gt;{{cite news | title = Sources say: Scandal-ridden Riptide ownership changes hands | publisher=Portland Tribune | date = July 18, 2006 | url = http://www.portlandtribune.com/sports/story.php?story_id=115319174037799200 | accessdate =February 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the ABA season started in November 2006, however, the Oregon Riptide was not on the schedule.

'''Prince's Cricket Ground''' in [[Chelsea, London]] was a [[cricket]] ground, created by the brothers George and James Prince as part of the [[Prince's Club]],  on which 37 [[first-class cricket|first-class]] matches were played between 1872 and 1878. The ground was built on in 1883. The boundaries of the site, laid out on the former Cattleugh's nursery gardens, are marked by Cadogan Square West, [[Milner Street]], Lennox Gardens Mews, [[Walton Street, London|Walton Street]] and Pont Street.&lt;ref&gt;Not to be confused with the 18th century Brighton [[Prince of Wales Ground]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1872 edition of ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'' described the ground as 'grand and quick and one of the finest playing grounds in England'.&lt;ref name='LPGT'&gt;{{cite web|title=Lennox Gardens|url=http://londongardensonline.org.uk/gardens-online-record.php?ID=KAC094|work=London Gardens Online - Lennox Gardens|publisher=London Parks &amp; Gardens Trust|accessdate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first match played on the ground was Household Brigade v. Lords and Commons on 3 June 1871.&lt;ref name=illustrated&gt;{{cite journal|title=Old Prince's Club|journal=[[The Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News]]|date=21 September 1918|volume=90|issue=2349|pages=82–83|url=http://www.illustratedfirstworldwar.com/item/old-princes-club-bpc000004_19180921_01_0028/#}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prince's Cricket Club|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000181/18710605/027/0004|work=Sheffield and Rotherham Independent|publisher=[[British Newspaper Archive]]|date=5 June 1871|page=4|subscription=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Middlesex County Cricket Club]] used the ground between 1872 and 1876 and played their first match on 23–25 May 1872 against Yorkshire. The ground was also used by [[South of England cricket team|South of England]] and by Gentlemen of the South. Several [[Gentlemen v Players]] fixtures were also played there, the first taking place in July 1873. In 1878, the [[Australian cricket team in England and North America in 1878|touring Australians]] played two matches on the ground: Gentlemen of England v Australians and Players v Australians (the last first-class match held on the ground, scheduled for 11 September to 13 September but finished in two days).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lazenby|first1=John|title=The strangers who came home : the first Australian cricket tour of England, 1878|date=2013|publisher=Bloomsbury|location=London|isbn=978-1408842874|pages=114–121}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing acquisition of portions of the site for building development, made possible by 'The Cadogan and Hans Place Improvement Act of 1874', discouraged its further use.

The former first-class cricketer [[Thomas Box]] was employed as an attendant at the ground. On 12 July 1876, during the Middlesex v Nottinghamshire match, he collapsed. He died three hours later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ci/content/player/9916.html Cricinfo piece on Tom Box]&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was also used for [[lawn tennis]], [[badminton]] and other games. A permanent [[roller skating]] rink was also added.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=45224 Chelsea: Cremorne Gardens, ''Old and New London: Volume 5'', 1878, pp 84-100.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Prix de Royaumont''' is a [[Conditions races|Group 3]] [[Flat racing|flat]] [[Horse racing|horse race]] in [[France]] open to three-year-old [[thoroughbred]] [[Filly|fillies]]. It is run at [[Chantilly Racecourse|Chantilly]] over a distance of 2,400 metres (about 1½ miles), and it is scheduled to take place each year in late May or early June.

==History==
The event is named after [[Royaumont Abbey]], an abbey located 12 km from Chantilly. The race was established in 1883, and it was originally contested over 2,100 metres. It was initially reserved for fillies considered below the standard required for the [[Prix de Diane]], which used to be run on the same day.

The Prix de Royaumont was abandoned throughout World War I, with no running from 1915 to 1918. The first two post-war editions were staged at [[Longchamp Racecourse|Longchamp]].

The race was cancelled once during World War II, in 1940. It was held at Longchamp in 1941 and 1942, and at [[Tremblay Park|Le Tremblay]] with a distance of 2,150 metres in 1943 and 1944. It was contested at Longchamp for the following three years, and it returned to Chantilly in 1948.

The Prix de Royaumont was not run in 1975 because of a strike by stable lads. A new schedule was introduced in 1978, and the race was moved to a date earlier than that of the Prix de Diane.

The event was staged at Longchamp from 1987 to 1990, and it was transferred to [[Saint-Cloud Racecourse|Saint-Cloud]] in 1991. Its distance was extended to 2,400 metres in 1992, and it continued to take place at Saint-Cloud until 1996. The race's only subsequent departure from Chantilly was in 2001, when it was run at Saint-Cloud.

The Prix de Royaumont is now held on the same day as the [[Prix du Jockey Club]].

[[Image:Complet-cysoing-cso-004.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A horse running out to the left to avoid jumping the obstacle.]]
In [[equestrianism|horse riding]], a '''refusal''' is the failure of a horse to jump a fence to which he/she is presented. This includes any stop in forward motion. A '''runout''' occurs when the horse quickly slides past or "ducks out" of a fence instead of jumping it, without stopping forward motion.

==Problems==
Refusals and runouts are counted against riders in jumping competitions. In [[show jumping]] and the stadium phase of eventing, a refusal is worth four penalty points. In the cross-country phase of [[eventing]], a refusal counts as 20 penalty points.

Refusals also have the potential to unseat the rider, which may result in rider injury, such as that of [[Christopher Reeve#Injury|Christopher Reeve]]. Refusals also present the possibility that the horse may crash into the obstacle. In extreme cases, however, it may be best for a horse to refuse rather than jump a fence which he cannot clear, as he might land on the fence, fall on landing, or flip over.

==Reasons==
There are several reasons for refusals, and therefore a rider must try to identify the problem before reprimanding the horse for his disobedience.

'''Rider-based reasons'''
* Poor take-off distance, usually due to rider error, which would make it unsafe to jump
* Horse does not have enough power ([[impulsion]]) to safely clear the obstacle, again usually due to rider error
* Horse has repeatedly been hit in the mouth or back due to a poor [[jumping position]] of the rider, and now associates jumping with pain
* Rider is unsure of jumping the fence, and his or her feelings are transmitted to the horse
* Habit: the horse has learned that it can refuse without consequence, and does so to get out of work
* A solid, colorful, or otherwise different fence may scare the horse
* Horse is "sour," or has been over-jumped and has begun to hate the work

'''Physical problems'''
* Back pain, or general soreness
* Dental problems
* Lameness issues, arthritis
* The horse is physically unable to jump the obstacle, due to [[equine conformation|conformational]] issues, insufficient conditioning, or lack of ability.

If a horse has begun to refuse frequently when before it  was willing, a veterinary exam can be performed to rule out pain.  When pain is ruled out as a factor, rider error is a very common cause for refusals; poor riding may place the horse in a position so that he physically would find it extremely difficult to clear the obstacle (such as too far or too close to the jump). Additionally, riders who do not release over the fence, preventing the horse from stretching down, will hit the horse in the mouth with the bit and cause pain. If this happens frequently, the horse will associate the pain with the jumping effort itself, and may begin to refuse.  Horses that have begun to refuse due to rider error often require retraining.

If a horse is physically unable to jump a fence of a certain size or height, even with the best riding, pushing a horse may result in physical harm to the animal or cause an accident involving both horse and rider.

The '''{{lang|es|Senadores de San Juan}}''' (lit. San Juan Senators) was a professional [[baseball]] team based in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], [[Puerto Rico]].

The Senadores club was founded in 1938 and played intermittently in the Liga de Béisbol Profesional de Puerto Rico, the predecessor to the current [[Liga de Béisbol Profesional Roberto Clemente]].

For the 1984–1985 season, they were rechristened as the [[Liga de Béisbol Profesional Roberto Clemente#Reemergence in the Caribbean Series|Metros de San Juan]], a name that they conserved until the 1993–1994 tournament. The team was sold in 2004 and subsequently relocated to [[Arecibo, Puerto Rico|Arecibo]]. In 2010 they returned to San Juan.

The franchise won eight league titles in its storied history, and also claimed the [[1995 Caribbean Series]] championship, with an undefeated record of 6–0, under [[manager (baseball)|manager]] [[Luis Meléndez (baseball)|Luis Meléndez]].

The Senadores de San Juan were expelled for the 2011-12 season, but have since continued to play.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.primerahora.com/deportes/beisbol/nota/expulsanalossenadoresdesanjuandelaligainvernal-550084/ Expulsan a los Senadores de San Juan de la Liga Invernal] (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

==1995 Dream Team==
In 1995, the Senadores de San Juan assembled one of the strongest teams in the history of the Caribbean Series. The group, which was dubbed ''[[Puerto Rico national baseball team#Caribbean Series|Dream Team]]'', featured Major League Baseball players in most positions, counting with a lineup that included:
*[[Roberto Alomar]]
*[[Carlos Baerga]]
*[[Ricky Bones]]
*[[Carlos Delgado]]
*[[Juan González (baseball)|Juan González]]
*[[Roberto Hernández (relief pitcher)|Roberto Hernández]]

'''Shere''' is a village in the [[Guildford (district)|Guildford district]] of [[Surrey]], England {{convert|4.8|mi|km}} east south-east of [[Guildford]] and {{convert|5.4|mi|km}} west of [[Dorking]], centrally bypassed by the [[A25 road|A25]]. It is a small still partly agricultural village chiefly set in the wooded '[[Vale of Holmesdale]]' between the [[North Downs]] and [[Greensand Ridge]] with many traditional English features. It has a central cluster of old village houses, shops including a blacksmith and trekking shop, tea house, art gallery, two pubs and a [[Norman England|Norman]] church. Shere has a CofE infant and nursery school with 'outstanding academic results' (Ofsted 2015)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/inspection-reports/find-inspection-report/provider/ELS/125246|title=Find an inspection report|last=enquiries@ofsted.gov.uk|first=Ofsted Communications Team.|date=5 November 2010|website=reports.ofsted.gov.uk|language=en|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; catering for 2-7 year old children which serves the village and surrounding villages and towns, and a museum which opens most afternoons at weekends.

The [[River Tillingbourne]] runs through the centre of the village.

Shere is also a [[civil parish]], extending to the east and south into [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]]s founded in the early Middle Ages which officially, in the 19th century, were consolidated into three villages.  These are [[Gomshall]], [[Holmbury St Mary|Holmbury St. Mary]] and [[Peaslake]].

It rendered £15 per year [[feudal system|to its overlords]].&lt;ref name=odS /&gt;&lt;ref name=db&gt;[http://www.gwp.enta.net/surrnames.htm Domesday Book – Surrey] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715015325/http://www.gwp.enta.net/surrnames.htm |date=15 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dmS&gt;[http://domesdaymap.co.uk/place/TQ0747/shere/ Domesdaymap.co.uk complete transcriptions (free)] with original excerpts&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1086, when Gomshall was royal demesne, the [[villein (feudal)|villein]]s (villagers) there were exempt from the sheriff's jurisdiction; Gomshall Netley and Gomshall Towerhill manors had [[court baron]]. Eleanor, Countess of Ormond owning the Vachery manor, had [[view of frankpledge]] in Gomshall Towerhill. In 1281 William Braose was granted [[free warren]] there

In the 13th century Roger de Clare settled for a life-rent on the church and sold the manor of Shere to a grandson of [[Geoffrey Fitz Peter, 1st Earl of Essex]].  In turn his grandson divided the manor, according with the law of [[moiety title]] to his daughter John Butler who thus received the new manor of Shiere Vachery; while [[Richard Óg de Burgh, 2nd Earl of Ulster]] ('the red Earl') received Shiere Ebor(acum).  Two other manors evolved.

===Medieval to 19th century===
The [[Victoria County History]] (Surrey: 1911) cites numerous mentions in the [[Assize Rolls]], [[Patent Rolls]], [[Feet of Fines]] and the ecclesiastical records of Westminster and Lambeth Palaces.  Traditionally the parish included the areas of the current civil parish and measured about 4½ miles from north to south, and from 2 to 2½ miles from east to west and contained 6,400 acres of land and 12 of water.&lt;ref name=m&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=42941 |title=Parishes: Shere |author=H.E. Malden (editor) |publisher=Institute of Historical Research |year=1911 |work=A History of the County of Surrey: Volume 3 |accessdate=7 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The neighbourhood was for a time one of the wildest in [[Surrey]]: sheep-stealers, [[smuggling|smugglers]], and poachers found a refuge in these remote hills. Some of the cottages have, still existing, very large cellars (excavated easily in the sandy hill), stated to have been by H.E. Malden "far too large for any honest purpose, and were no doubt made for storing smuggled goods till they could be conveniently taken on to London".&lt;ref name=m/&gt;

In 1671, a Shere man called Edward Bound was charged by church authorities with "playing [[cricket]] on the Sabbath" and was exonerated, one of the sport's earliest references.&lt;ref&gt;Major, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/main.html |title=From Lads to Lord's; The History of Cricket: 1300 – 1787 |publisher=Stumpsite |first=John |last=Leach |date=2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629134518/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/main.html |archivedate=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iron was worked from the stone and into implements in centuries before the 18th century in Shere.&lt;ref name=m/&gt; In 1911 great quantities of [[watercress]] were grown which is no longer the case;&lt;ref name=m/&gt; the principal area in southern England for this being near the ''[[Watercress Line]]'', a railway in [[Hampshire]].

===19th century===
[[Holmbury St. Mary]] up in the Greensand Ridge was a modern village term devised in 1878 for the two hamlets of Felday in Shere and Pitland Street in Shere and Abinger, when the place became a civil parish and ecclesiastical parish. The [[Church of England]] schools were built in 1860 and enlarged in 1900.&lt;ref name=m/&gt;

== School ==
Shere Infant and Nursery School has been serving the local community since 1852, celebrating its 175th birthday in 2017. The school received a 'Good' status from the Ofsted inspection in December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;([http://www.shere.surrey.sch.uk/ School Website]).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Landmarks==

===St James' Church===
{{see also|List of places of worship in Guildford (borough)}}
The church of St James is in the [[Early English Gothic|Early English]] style, most being 12th, 13th and 14th century.  It replaced an earlier Anglo-Saxon church mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]].&lt;ref name=guide&gt;{{cite book |last1=Austin |first1=Tim |title=History of St James' Church Shere |date=2005 |publisher=Shere parish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constructed of [[ironstone]] rubble with [[Bargate stone|sandstone]] buttresses, it was restored in 1895 by S. Weatherley.  By the north chancel wall there is a 14th-century quatrefoil window and squint – belonging to an [[Anchorite]] cell. There is 14th-century glass in the east window and the chancel fittings were renewed in 1956 by [[Louis Osman]]. It is a Grade I [[listed building]].&lt;ref name=church&gt;{{NHLE| num=1377794|accessdate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Others===
Within the village centre conservation area are 34 [[listed building]]s that pre-date 1830, in some cases by several centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/mapsearch.aspx [[Ordnance Survey]] map, courtesy of [[English Heritage]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==
The village can be accessed for long distance travel from the north and west from the [[A3 road|A3]] at [[West Clandon]] – from the east the [[M25 motorway|M25]] at [[Leatherhead]] and the [[A24 road|A24 at Dorking]] followed by the [[A25 road]] provides a shorter alternative route than taking the first route; there are minor routes south however the nearest major route directly south is the [[A24 road|A24 at Dorking]].

[[Gomshall]] railway station is less than {{convert|1|mi}} away on the [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] to [[Gatwick Airport|Gatwick]] line.  While 1614 people (65% of the parish) in 2001 for instance were economically active, only 178 routinely used public transport and 1037 used motor vehicles.  The average Shere commuter travels {{convert|20.3|km}} to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2001 Census|url=http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&amp;b=800076&amp;c=shere&amp;d=16&amp;e=15&amp;g=490542&amp;i=1001x1003x1004&amp;m=0&amp;r=1&amp;s=1336399531233&amp;enc=1&amp;dsFamilyId=783|publisher=ONS|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy, demography and housing==
[[image:The Shere Shop - geograph.org.uk - 1607980.jpg|thumb|''Shere Shop'', one of the many shops]]
The economy is a mixture of local and regional with the many shops and some farming within it.  A significant minority of the working population are London commuters, particularly in the civil parish at large.  The 2001 census shows the self-employed (including with employees) form 36% of the population, retirees form 16% of the population and employees form 48% of the population. 77% of the ward's population is Christian, of the remainder 22% are of no religion or not stated.&lt;ref name=census/&gt;

[[image:Burdens, Shere - geograph.org.uk - 527201.jpg|thumb|''Burdens'']]

[[Image:Footbridge, Shere - geograph.org.uk - 1094550.jpg|thumb|Footbridge by streamside village centre footpath]]
Within the civil parish are shops, four village halls, and three post offices.  Many walks radiate from the village, including a streamside walk, parts of the [[North Downs Way]] and the [[Pilgrims' Way]]. In the village are Millstream Press, a book publisher named after the Tillingbourne, a textiles-cum-boutique&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mad Jak textiles, food and fashion| url=http://www.loosethreads.co.uk/html/mad_jak.html|accessdate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Surrey Hills Brewery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Surrey Hills Brewery address|url=http://www.misterwhat.co.uk/company/337438-surrey-hills-brewery-ltd-guildford|accessdate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Kingdom Census 2011]] considered the village as four relevant output layers, approximately a third of the [[wards of the United Kingdom|ward]] ''Shere'', the latter being used for elections to [[Guildford (borough)|Guildford Borough Council]].  All parts featured their single largest proportion of housing as either [[Two Family House|semi-detached]] or [[single-family home]]s and most of these with gardens.

In all 439 households (in slightly fewer homes) make up the village including its scattered farms and cottages.  The census boundaries drawn exclude central and eastern Burrows Cross due to is proximity to slightly larger hamlet Gomshall, being contiguous and due south Burrows Cross had census overlap of its output areas (E00155528 and E00155529) and was included within [[Gomshall]].

The proportion of households in three divisions of Shere who owned their home outright was at least 5% above the national average, in the fourth division this was 3% below, a central area including one of the two conservation area thoroughfares.  The proportion of residents who owned their home with a loan was between 2.8% and 11.3% lower than the national average.  The census shows that overall, Shere has a lower proportion than average of rented residential property and of [[social housing]] relative to the [[Surrey]] and national averages.&lt;ref name=ons/&gt;

[[Grade I listed buildings in Surrey#Guildford|The Church of St. James]]).  She received her food and drink from friends and family through a metal grating on the outside wall.  In the interior of the church a [[quatrefoil]] shape was cut out of the wall through which she could receive the [[Eucharist]] and a [[Squint (opening)|squint]] (or [[hagioscope]]) for her use for prayer and reflection.  She left her cell and in 1332 she applied again and was granted permission to be re-enclosed. &lt;ref name=guide /&gt;
*[[Benjamin Williams Leader]] (1831–1923), landscape artist. Lived in the parish from 1889–1923 at Burrows Cross, a large mansion which dominated its hamlet directly south-east of the village, designed by [[Norman Shaw]].
*[[Lewis Pinhorn Wood]] (1848–1918), landscapist and watercolourist, best known for his rural scenes of Sussex and Surrey. In the tradition of the Victorian era, his work depicted idyllic scenes of rural life across the home counties. He lived with his family in the parish in the 1870s and 1880s at 'Burnside'.
*[[Harry Edwards (healer)|Harry Edwards]] (1893–1976), spiritual healer, founded his "Spiritual Healing sanctuary" at Burrows Lea, a house in the east of the parish, in 1946; he went on to found the "National Federation of Spiritual Healers" (NFSH) in 1959.

==Film location==
Even in 1911, the draws of a picturesque valley and authentic [[Tudor period|Tudor]] and similar architecture was considered among the finest in England, as such it has been used for numerous films, the [[Victoria County History]] which was written for the county of Surrey in 1911 lavished more praise than on any other village:

{{cquote|Shere has often been called one of the most beautiful villages in England; certainly few can surpass it in Surrey for a combination of those qualities that go to make up the ideal village... Shere is, therefore, the haunt of painters, many of them residents in and around, and samples of their handiwork may be inspected in the ancient Black Horse Inn.&lt;ref name=m/&gt;}}.

'''''Sport Goofy in Soccermania''''' is an animated television special produced by [[The Walt Disney Company]]. It originally aired May 27, 1987 on [[NBC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-05-27/entertainment/ca-1678_1_sport-goofy|title=Tv Review :  'Sport Goofy' Fumbles Despite The Animation|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During its television debut it was preceded by a [[mockumentary]] showing past Goofy cartoons of him always getting everything wrong, and leading into the cartoon special where the audience is finally shown a competent, athletic Goofy who is the hero.

==Plot==
[[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]] request [[Scrooge McDuck]] [[donation|donate]] $1.49 to buy a championship trophy for their new soccer team. Scrooge gives an old trophy of his he thinks is worthless, but the boys pass the [[curator]] of the Duckburg Museum, who sees it is a rare artifact worth a million dollars. To win back the trophy, Scrooge is now made to sponsor his nephews, and he ends up enlisting the aid of a surprisingly athletic and agile [[Goofy]], who ends becoming the team's coach when the nephews' teammates are shown as ragtag misfits, but the "McDuck Greenbacks" come together under "Sport Goofy"'s patient coaching and sharpen their soccer skills.

Unfortunately, the [[Beagle Boys]] know of the trophy's value, and sought to enter the soccer tournament as well, but since they are out of shape and do not know anything about soccer, they decide Goofy is a problem and [[kidnap]] him. The team is disheartened by the loss of their team captain, but resolve to go on without him. Despite the excellent playing by the team members, the Beagle Boys engage in outright cheating and a [[nearsighted]] referee keeps declaring the Beagles' goals legit, ending the first half with a score of 10-0. Goofy quietly escapes the Beagles' hideout and gets to the field for the second half, which encourages the Greenbacks into incredible playing that not even the Beagles' cheating can counter, causing a comeback of 10-10.

When the enraged Beagles resort to outright physically assaulting Goofy, Scrooge finally makes the referee wear his glasses, causing the referee to cry foul and set up a [[penalty shot]]. The Beagles' captain has secretly placed a bomb in the ball, and orders a Beagle to push the red button on the detonator when Goofy is ready to take his shot. Unfortunately, that Beagle is so uneducated he keeps pushing the green button, causing Sport Goofy to easily make the penalty goal past an overconfident goalie, thus the Greenbacks win 11-10. All of Duckburg rejoices except for the Beagles, whose angry captain pushes the red button causing the ball to explode and send all the Beagle Boys into a waiting [[police van]]. Now that Scrooge has his trophy back, he donates it to the Duckburg Museum, and joins the McDuck Greenbacks in their championship photo.
==Voice actors==
* [[Tony Pope]] - Sport Goofy
* [[Will Ryan]] - Scrooge McDuck, Beagle Boys and Gyro Gearloose
* [[Russi Taylor]] - Huey, Dewey, and Louie, Grandma Duck
* [[Jack Angel]]
* [[Philip Proctor]]
* [[Chick Hearn]] - The Announcer

==Production==
The cartoon marks the first time [[Russi Taylor]] voices Huey, Dewey, and Louie (taking the role from [[Clarence Nash]]) and Grandma Duck (taking the role from [[June Foray]]). [[Joe Ranft]] and [[Tad Stones]] wrote the story.  Ranft went on to work for [[Pixar]], while Stones went on to work at [[Disney Television Animation|Walt Disney Television Animation]],  which was concurrently in production on ''[[DuckTales]]'', another pairing of Uncle Scrooge and his nephews. ''Sport Goofy in Soccermania'' is one of the few Disney cartoons where Uncle Scrooge was not voiced by his classic voice actor of [[Alan Young]], but instead was voiced by [[Will Ryan]].

''Sport Goofy in Soccermania'' was [[Darrell Van Citters]]' last production with Disney. He worked for [[Warner Bros. Animation]] for a couple years, before forming his own animation company, [[Renegade Animation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3584">[[File:Stadium at Delphi, Greece.jpg|thumb|The stadium in Delphi, Greece in March 2009.]]

The '''Stadium of Delphi''' lies on the highest spot of the Archaeological Site of [[Delphi]]. It overlooks the sanctuary of [[Apollo]] and has a marvelous view to the [[Delphic Landscape]]. It was built either within the second half of the 4th century B.C. or even after the [[Battle of Thermopylae (279 BC)|Galatian attacks]]. Its measured 178 meters in length and knew several refurbishment phases. Τhe Stadium of Delphi is the best preserved ancient [[stadium]] in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pausanias-footsteps.nl/english/delphi-eng.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The stadium occupied the highest part of the site, built over and to the northwest of the sanctuary of Apollo. It is [[Epigraphy|epigraphically]] attested as “the pythikon stadion". To the north it was supported by the slope of the mountain, whereas to the south a wall was built to support the seats for the spectators. It is unknown when the site actually started being used for the Pythian Games. However, archaeological study proves that the actual architectural formation took place either within the second half of the 4th century or towards the mid-3rd century B.C., after the victory against the Galatians and possibly at the instigation of the [[Aetolian League]].&lt;ref&gt;Earlier studies concluded that the stadium was first built in the 5th century. See Dinsmooor,W.B.,(1950) The Architecture of Ancient Greece,New York,pp.250-251&lt;/ref&gt; 
Within the stadium took place the “gymnastic” contests, i.e. the track and field sports. Musical contests were probably organized there as well. A 2nd century B.C. inscription informs us on Satyr the Samian who performed a hymn “for the god and the Greeks” to the sound of the guitar.

Another interesting inscription, embedded on the eastern side of the support wall, is that forbidding to take out the wine destined for sacred rituals. The inscription has attracted the interest of epigraphists, but it has been proposed that maybe this was not its original place and that it is actually in second use.

The construction of the stadium can be discerned in at least four different phases. The initial construction dates, as mentioned above, to the 4th or mid-3rd century B.C. The latter dating coincides with the celebration of the Soteria, ceremonial celebration of the victory against the Galatians.  Up to 20 athletes could compete simultaneously on the tracks, but soon the tracks were reduced to 17. The aphesis (starting points) were made of stone. The tiers on the south side were added only in 100 BC. A final restoration phase took place in the Roman period, consisting of the revetment of the tiers with stone.

The total capacity was about 6,500 spectators. The starting point is preserved on the east accompanied with two rows of incised slabs for placing the feet of the runners. Four pillars on the eastern side must have supported a monumental arch.

'''The Pilot Field''' is a [[Association football|football]] [[stadium]] in [[Hastings]], [[East Sussex]]. It is home to [[Hastings United F.C.|Hastings United]] who currently play in the [[Isthmian League]], the club have used the ground since 1985 after the old [[Hastings United F.C. (1948)|Hastings United]] folded, having previously used the ground between 1920 and 1948. The current capacity stands at 4,050 although over 9,000 have been known to attend events in the past and the closure of the grass bank has decreased the capacity.

== History ==

In 1920 the site was earmarked as a site of a potential new sports ground for the town alongside [[Horntye Park]], with the Pilot Field being preferred as it could be ready to use for the [[1920–21 in English football|1920–21]] football season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Pilot Field Suggested |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000293/19200424/146/0008 |work=Hastings &amp; St Leonards Observer |location=Hastings |date=24 April 1920 |access-date=7 December 2017 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pilot Field - Hastings Football History" /&gt; The site was acquired by the Hastings Corporation in June 1920,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=A Football &amp; Hockey Ground Secured |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000293/19200619/202/0009 |work=Hastings &amp; St Leonards Observer |location=Hastings |date=19 June 1920 |access-date=7 December 2017 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pilot Field - Hastings Football History" /&gt; with the Hastings Sports Association taking control in August who did the necessary work needed on the ground for [[Hastings United F.C.|Rock-a-Nore FC]] to compete in the [[Southern Combination Football League|Sussex County League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=The Pilot Field |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000293/19200904/194/0005 |work=Hastings &amp; St Leonards Observer |location=Hastings |date=4 September 1920 |access-date=7 December 2017 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pilot Field - Hastings Football History" /&gt;

In 1925 work on the main stand had started and was officially opened in April 1926, in an opening ceremony where 1,500 assembled in the structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Grand Stand Opening |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000293/19260501/117/0005 |work=Hastings &amp; St Leonards Observer |location=Hastings |date=1 May 1926|access-date=7 December 2017 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pilot Field - Hastings Football History" /&gt; The cycling track was upgraded to cinder in 1948, in preparation for the [[Hastings Saxons]] speedway team moving into the ground.&lt;ref name="Hastings Saxons"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://1066-media.com/hastingssaxons/ |title=Hastings Saxons Speedway |last=Harvey |first=Sarah |publisher=1066 media|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pilot Field - Hastings Football History" /&gt; The same year saw the [[Hastings United F.C.|Hastings &amp; St Leonards]] amateur club get kicked off in favour for the newly formed professional club [[Hastings United F.C. (1948)|Hastings United]], who would stay at the ground until 1985.&lt;ref name="Elms"&gt;{{cite book |title= Claret and Blue |last= Elms |first= Philip |publisher= 1066 Newspapers Ltd |location= Hastings }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pilot Field - Hastings Football History" /&gt;

The ground would see a number of improvements during Hastings United's tenure, including the erection of two new stands at the Elphinstone Road end of the ground in the mid 1950s and the erection of floodlights in 1964. The old speedway track was eventually concreted over to allow spectators to get closer to the playing area and for the erection of the dugouts in front of the main stand.&lt;ref name="Hastings Saxons" /&gt; A new squash complex constructed in the opposite corner to the main turnstiles was opened in 1980, but was later sold off to recuperate some of the debt owed by Hastings United.&lt;ref name="Elms"&gt;{{cite book |title= Claret and Blue |last= Elms |first= Philip |publisher= 1066 Newspapers Ltd |location= Hastings }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pilot Field - Hastings Football History" /&gt;

In 1985 Hastings United folded and Hastings Town moved in from the old upper pitch, now called the Firs, with the ground receiving minor refurbishment work to represent the club colours of red and white. By the 1990s the two Elphinstone Road end stands were in poor condition, with the stand directly behind the goal receiving a major renovation in the mid 1990s whilst the other stand was closed to spectators, before eventually being demolished by 2000. A new clubhouse was built in 1998 and then further extended the following year, with the old clubhouse under the main stand becoming the boardroom. A new stand was built ahead of the [[2005–06 in English football|2005–06]] season and was named the 'Cole Warren' stand after two supporters, this structure consists of a small number of rows of terracing and elevated viewing area for wheelchair users.&lt;ref name="Pilot Field - Hastings Football History" /&gt; In 2010 four new sets of floodlights replaced the old pylons which had been erected in 1964 and in 2016 the club purchased the old squash complex which was now a sports and social club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isthmian.co.uk/hastings-set-for-new-pilot-lights-1897 |title=Hastings set for new Pilot lights|publisher=Isthmian League |accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure and facilities ==
[[File:Hastings United FC (8604843460).jpg|thumb|right|250px|View of the south-west corner of the ground with the main stand in the background]]
The most prominent structure at the ground is the main stand, which covers about three quarters of the length of one side of the pitch. The capacity is 800 for seated spectators mostly on wooden benches, but there are plastic seats to the centre in front of the public address box, some of which are reserved for board members and other guests. There are more plastic seats located to the left of this block covering the front rows, which were relocated from the Firs after [[St. Leonards F.C.|St Leonards]] folded in 2004. Underneath the main stand are the changing rooms, boardroom and a tea bar. The age of the main stand have led to ever increasing maintenance costs for the club and is a major factor in their effort to find a new stadium.

On the opposite side to the main stand is a grass bank, which at one point was open to spectators but was fenced off for health and safety. The closing off of the bank meant the capacity of ground went from 9,000 to 4,050. To the east of the bank, is the Hastings United Sports and Social Club, purchased in 2016, this building contains a gym, a bar and a viewing deck. The east side of the ground is where the Cole Warren stand is, behind the stand, the remains of the speedway track still exists and is used as a car park for players. On the west side of the ground, is the Elphinstone Road end terrace, with the clubhouse immediately to the south. In the south-west corner is a building that houses the club shop, toilets and a tea bar.

== Other uses ==
[[File:Hastings speedway.jpg|thumb|right|250px|View of the Pilot Field hosting Speedway]]

When first opened the ground was intended to be used by various sports including football, rugby and hockey. There are no known records of hockey taking place at the Pilot Field, but there are records of rugby being played. Cricket was also played at the ground between 1920-1922 before being split into upper and lower pitches. The Hastings &amp; St Leonards cycling club also made use of the cycling track built in 1922. The venue also hosted sports days and athletic events.

In 1948 the Hastings Saxons moved to the venue after [[Eastbourne Eagles]] were forced out of their stadium at [[Arlington, East Sussex|Arlington]] due to a petrol ban, however the club left in 1949 following complaints about the noise from local residents. The speedway meets regularly attracted crowds of 9,000.&lt;ref name="Hastings Saxons" /&gt; It was proposed to introduced greyhound racing at the Pilot Field in the 1960s, but there are no records to show any races ever happening.

== Records ==
The known recorded record attendance for football at the Pilot Field is 12,527, when Hastings United drew 3-3 against [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] [[1953–54 FA Cup]] third round tie. The record attendance a game featuring the newer Hastings United, is 4,888 in a friendly against [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] when they were Hastings Town.

The Hastings Saxons regularly attracted crowds of 9,000 but it is unknown if they ever attracted a crowd larger than 12,527.

== Transport ==
The ground is located 1.1 miles away from [[Ore railway station]], which is situated on the [[Marshlink line]] between [[Hastings railway station]] and [[Ashford International]]. Hastings railway station is located 1.6 miles away and served by [[Southern (Govia Thameslink Railway)|Southern]] and [[Southeastern (train operating company)|Southeastern]]. Situated on the Marshlink Line, [[East Coastway line]] to [[Brighton railway station|Brighton]] and the [[Hastings line]] to [[Tonbridge railway station|Tonbridge]], this station has more frequent services.

'''''The Screwball''''' is the seventh [[animated cartoon]] [[short subject]] in the ''[[Woody Woodpecker (TV series)|Woody Woodpecker]]'' series. Released theatrically on February 15, 1943, the film was produced by [[Walter Lantz Productions]] and distributed by [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]].

==Plot==

A local crowd gathers at a baseball park for a game between the Droops and the Drips. A lone policeman stands at the park gate discouraging spectators who have not paid to see the game. Woody notices that kids returning baseballs can get in for free, so he tosses the policeman a cannonball and enters the park.

Woody tries to watch the game but the policeman finds him. He escapes by shaking a [[soda pop]] bottle and spraying it into his adversary's face, adding "No stopper, Copper!"

Woody joins the game as the pitcher for the Drips. When he is up to bat, he causes so much trouble that the entire team chases him along the baselines while the policeman waits for him at [[home plate]]. He escapes by pecking his way through a barrage of [[baseball bat]]s. However, Woody ends up not getting away with murder, being assaulted with a barrage of baseballs as soon as he pops out of the park's scoreboard.

==Production notes==
*''The Screwball'' is set at a [[baseball park]]. It would also the last onscreen credit for director/animator [[Alex Lovy]] on a Woody cartoon for 12 years. He would direct one more entry (''[[The Dizzy Acrobat]]'') before departing the studio.
*This is one of the few Woody Woodpecker cartoons in which Woody loses at the end. The other shorts in which Woody loses include [[Woody Woodpecker (cartoon)|''The Cracked Nut'']], ''[[Banquet Busters]]'', ''[[Smoked Hams]]'', ''[[Real Gone Woody]]'', ''Woody's Clip Joint'', ''[[A Fine Feathered Frenzy]]'', ''[[Tepee for Two]]'', ''[[Well Oiled (film)|Well Oiled]]'', ''[[Ace in the Hole (cartoon)|Ace in the Hole]]'', ''Busman's Holiday'', ''[[Bye Bye Blackboard]]'', ''[[The Tenant's Racket]]'', ''[[Rough Riding Hood]]'', ''[[Chili Con Corny]]'', ''[[Ski for Two]]'', ''[[Knock Knock (1940 film)|Knock Knock]]'', ''[[The Dizzy Acrobat]]'', ''[[What's Sweepin']]'', ''[[The Coo Coo Bird]]'', ''[[The Barber of Seville (cartoon)|The Barber of Seville]]'', ''[[Solid Ivory]]'', and ''[[The Beach Nut]]''.

==Cultural references==
"[[Take Me Out to the Ball Game]]" can be heard in the background score during the establishing shot of the baseball park. The music is used sporadically throughout the film.

'''Tundra Oil &amp; Gas Place''' is a multi-purpose recreation complex located in the town of [[Virden, Manitoba|Virden]], [[Manitoba]], Canada. The venue includes a 1,200-seat [[ice hockey]] arena, community hall, and recreational facilities. The naming rights to the complex were acquired by [[Tundra Oil &amp; Gas Partnership]] in August 2012.&lt;ref name="bs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brandonsun.com/local/virden-unveils-name-for-recreation-centre-166869866.html|title=Virden unveils name for recreation centre|publisher=Brandon Sun|date=2012-08-21|accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
With Virden's aging recreational facilities reaching the end of their useful lives, the Town of Virden held public consultations to assess the needs of the community and region.  The result of this was the idea to build a large multi-use facility that would replace older facilities and provide recreational options not available to residents in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virden.ca/page.aspx?page_id=72|title=New Recreation Facility|publisher=Virden.ca|accessdate=2012-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction on the new complex began in March 2010 and was completed in June 2011.   The total cost of the facility was $18 million, with the federal and provincial governments contributing $5 million in public funding.&lt;ref name="dw" /&gt;

==Arena==
The 1,204-seat arena at Tundra Oil &amp; Gas Place is home to the [[Virden Oil Capitals]] of the [[Manitoba Junior Hockey League]], Virden Oil Kings of the North Central Hockey League, Virden Golden Bears of the Manitoba High School Hockey League, local minor hockey, and local figure skating programs.  The first major event hosted by the arena was the [[2012 Telus Cup]] regional championship, which was hosted by the [[Manitoba Midget 'AAA' Hockey League]]'s Southwest Cougars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hockeymanitoba.ca/news.php?id=1026|title=2012 TELUS Cup West Regional qualifier to be hosted by Virden|date=June 4, 2011|accessdate=April 26, 2012|publisher=[[Hockey Manitoba]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120802212929/http://www.hockeymanitoba.ca/news.php?id=1026|archivedate=August 2, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other facilities==
The complex also features a 500-seat community hall, retail space, fitness centre, running/walking track, and an outdoor swimming pool.  These public facilities, along with the arena, are managed by the Town of Virden's Parks and Recreation department.

The city that will consist of apartment buildings as well as several sports facilities will be built by the Bukhatir Group at a cost of $5 Billion (5.86 Billion Dinars).

Construction began in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tap.info.tn/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=18853&amp;Itemid=155   Construction of Tunis Sports City kickstarted] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902090757/http://www.tap.info.tn/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=18853&amp;Itemid=155 |date=2009-09-02 }}- Construction of Tunis Sports City mega project started in 2008&lt;/ref&gt; after being approved by the former Tunisian President [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zawya.com/Story.cfm/sidKUN0073071102184642/SecMain/pagHomepage/chnAll%20Regional%20News/obj2A17E941-F5E0-11D4-867D00D0B74A0D7C/ Zawya.com] Tunisian president gives green light to Tunis Sports City&lt;/ref&gt;

The site is located in the Lac de Tunis area in the northern suburbs of the city. The entire site is currently an uninhabited green space. The Lac de Tunis area is the major focus for new development and building activity in Tunis, and the area has seen as increasing number of multi-national companies setting up offices in the area. The site is bordered by two roads, the main Rue de Lac on one side and the motorway connecting Tunis with the suburbs on the other.

The first part of the project, namely the residential project "Cedar," will be completed in a two-year period. It is a housing district made up of 11 high-rise apartment buildings, approximately 50 standard villas and grand villas, as well as 13 blocks of low-rise townhouses/apartments which will be called the village. The Tunis Sports City, which will cover an area of 257 hectares, will encompass several spaces of entertainment activities through academies in various sport disciplines like tennis, golf and swimming.

The project also includes sports academies, a 20,000 capacity football stadium, a swimming centre with an olympic swimming pool, a thalassatherapy centre, in addition to an indoors sports services centre.

'''Wylie's Baths''' is an [[heritage register|heritage-listed]] [[tide|tidal]] [[swimming pool]] located near [[Coogee, New South Wales|Coogee Beach]], in the [[Eastern Suburbs (Sydney)|Eastern Suburbs]] of [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], Australia.&lt;ref&gt;UBD Sydney Street Directory, Universal Publishers Pty Ltd, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The baths are noted for holding the first [[Australian Swimming Championships]]&lt;ref name=Citycouncil&gt;{{Cite web |title=Wylie's Baths |work=About Randwick - Heritage - A to Z of people and places |publisher=Randwick City Council |date= |url=http://www.randwick.nsw.gov.au/About_Randwick/Heritage/A_to_Z_of_people_and_places/Wylies_Baths/indexdl_223.aspx |accessdate=19 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and for being one of the first swimming baths for mixed gender swimming in Australia.&lt;ref name=gov&gt;{{Cite web |title=Wylie's Baths—mixed swimming |work=Australia's modern swimmers and ocean baths |publisher=[[Australian Government]] |date=12 January 2009 |url=http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/australias-modern-swimmers |accessdate=19 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Baths were added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 14 November 2003&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677&gt;{{cite NSW SHR|5050360|Wylie's Baths|hr=01677|fn=S90/02970|accessdate=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are also classified by the [[National Trust of Australia]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Wylie's Baths was built in 1907 by Henry Wylie,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Eileen |last=Slarke |title=A Century of Wylie's Baths Coogee |publisher=Wylie's Baths Trust Inc |year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the father of [[Mina Wylie]] who, along with [[Fanny Durack]], were Australia's first female Olympic swimming representatives, and Australia's first woman gold and silver medallists respectively.

== History ==
===Indigenous history===
[[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal people]] are believed to have inhabited the [[Sydney]] region for at least 20,000 years.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677-168&gt;Turbet, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The population of Aboriginal people between [[Palm Beach, New South Wales|Palm Beach]] and [[Botany Bay]] in 1788 has been estimated to have been 1500. Those living south of [[Port Jackson]] to Botany Bay were the [[Cadigal]] people who spoke [[Dharug]],&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677-169&gt;Randwick Library webpage, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; while the local clan name of [[Maroubra, New South Wales|Maroubra]] people was "Muru-ora-dial".&lt;ref&gt;[[City of Sydney]] webpage, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid nineteenth century the traditional owners of this land had typically either moved inland in search of food and shelter, or had died as the result of European disease or confrontation with British colonisers.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677-169/&gt; Few religious beliefs of the people were recorded, but oral traditions have ensured that some have been carried on. Thus it is thought that the Wylie's Baths location may have been a special place for women's business, possibly associated with birthing, although more research needs to be done to confirm this.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677-3116&gt;MLALC, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; There is now a sizable community of Aboriginal people living in the Randwick municipality, many to the south of Coogee in [[La Perouse, New South Wales|La Perouse]].&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

===Colonial history===
One of the earliest land grants in this area was made in 1824 to Captain Francis Marsh, who received {{convert|12|acre|ha|order=flip}} bounded by the present Botany and High Streets, Alison and Belmore Roads.  In 1839 William Newcombe acquired the land north-west of the present town hall in Avoca Street.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

Randwick takes its name from the town of [[Randwick, Gloucestershire]], England. The name was suggested by Simeon Pearce (1821–86) and his brother James. Simeon was born in the English Randwick and the brothers were responsible for the early development of both Randwick and its neighbour, Coogee.  Simeon had come to the colony  in 1841as a 21 year old surveyor.  He built his Blenheim House on the {{convert|4|acre|ha|order=flip}} he bought from Marsh, and called his property "Randwick".  The brothers bought and sold land profitably in the area and elsewhere.  Simeon campaigned for construction of a road from the city to Coogee (achieved in 1853) and promoted the incorporation of the suburb.  Pearce sought construction of a church modelled on the church of St. John in his birthplace.  In 1857 the first St Jude's stood on the site of the present post office, at the corner of the present Alison Road and Avoca Street.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677-170&gt;Pollen &amp; Healy, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|217–8}}

Randwick was slow to progress. The village was isolated from Sydney by swamps and sandhills, and although a horse-bus was operated by a man named Grice from the late 1850s, the journey was more a test of nerves than a pleasure jaunt.  Wind blew sand over the track, and the bus sometimes became bogged, so that passengers had to get out and push it free. From its early days Randwick had a divided society.  The wealthy lived elegantly in large houses built when Pearce promoted Randwick and Coogee as a fashionable area.  But the market gardens, orchards and piggeries that continued alongside the large estates were the lot of the working class.  Even on the later estates that became racing empires, many jockeys and stablehands lived in huts or even under canvas. An even poorer group were the immigrants who existed on the periphery of Randwick in a place called Irishtown, in the area now known as [[The Spot, New South Wales|The Spot]], around the junction of St.Paul's Street  and Perouse Road. Here families lived in makeshift houses, taking on the most menial tasks in their struggle to survive.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

In 1858 when the [[Government of New South Wales|NSW Government]] passed the Municipalities Act, enabling formation of municipal districts empowered to collect rates and borrow money to improve their suburb, Randwick was the first suburb to apply for the status of a municipality.  It was approved in February 1859, and its first Council was elected in March 1859.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

Randwick had been the venue for sporting events, as well as duels and illegal sports, from the early days in the colony's history. Its first racecourse, the Sandy Racecourse or Old Sand Track, had been a hazardous track over hills and gullies since 1860.  When a move was made in 1863 by John Tait, to establish [[Randwick Racecourse]], Simeon Pearce was furious, especially when he heard that Tait also intended to move into Byron Lodge. Tait's venture prospered, however and he became the first person in Australia to organise racing as a commercial sport. The racecourse made a big difference to the progress of Randwick.  The horse-bus gave way to trams that linked the suburb to Sydney and civilisation.  Randwick soon became a prosperous and lively place, and it still retains a busy residential, professional and commercial life.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

Today, some of the houses have been replaced by home units. Many European migrants have made their homes in the area, along with students and workers at the nearby [[UNSW Australia|University of NSW]] and the [[Prince of Wales Hospital (Sydney)|Prince of Wales Hospital]].&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677-170/&gt;{{rp|218–9}}

===Coogee===
Following the opening of the tram line to Coogee Bay in 1883, Coogee became a popular seaside resort. Coogee became well known for its beach and seaside entertainments, similar to [[Manly, New South Wales|Manly]] and [[Bondi, New South Wales|Bondi]]. The Coogee Aquarium opened in December 1887 and included a ballroom and indoor swimming pool. Other beach amusements included swings, donkey rides, bandstand and an outdoor slide and toboggan rink. Later amusements included the Coogee Pleasure Pier built in 1928 (demolished in 1933), the shark net installed in 1929 (removed in 1939) and floodlights for night surfing.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

The late nineteenth century also saw the development of swimming as a competitive sport, in contrast to "bathing" as a therapeutic activity. The first British amateur swimming association was formed in 1869, and the [[Balmain, New South Wales|Balmain]] Swimming Club was formed in March 1884. In 1891 the NSW Amateur Swimming Association was formed by men's swimming clubs and in 1906 women swimmers formed their own association. Fred Cavill arrived in Sydney in 1879 and, with his sons, managed a number of harbourside pools (for example, [[Lavender Bay, New South Wales|Lavender Bay]]) and helped to popularise competitive and long-distance swimming. His son, Dick Cavill introduced the crawl from the Solomon Islands which revolutionised swimming and another son, Sydney Cavill developed the butterfly stroke.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

A number of Sydney ocean and harbourside pools date from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, prior to the main construction phase of ocean and harbour pools in the 1930s and 1940s. Examples includes the [[Dawn Fraser]] Pool (1882), [[Bondi Beach]] Pool ({{circa|1892}}), the original Manly Cove Baths (c.1890), the original Brighton Baths (c.1900), Watson Bay Baths (c.1905) and [[Dee Why]] Rock Pool ({{circa|1915}}). Many of these pools were built as Olympic-sized pools with raised seating to cater for competitive swimming events. North of Wylie's Baths are two more rock pools: the Ross Jones Memorial Baths (built 1947) and the McIver Women's Baths. These occupy the site of a women's bathing spot since before 1876. The Women's Baths were built in 1886 and since 1922 have been managed by the Randwick Coogee Ladies Amateur Swimming Club, formed by Rose McIver and Mina Wylie. At the northern end of Coogee Beach is another rock pool: Giles Baths, which was built in 1902 for men only. By 1909 it was known as the Randwick Municipal Baths. While now in disrepair, the pool is still in use.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

===Wylie's Baths, 1900s-1959===
In the early 1900s Henry Alexander Wylie, a champion long-distance and under-water swimmer - and an amateur builder - obtained a lease for the area below the high water mark (the area above high water mark being Crown Reserve). In 1907 Wylie constructed the present ocean pool, which opened on 12 December 1907. It was originally fenced with a metal hand rail along the eastern edge. At some stage the original fence was replaced with a timber and metal rail which enclosed the pool on three sides. In 1912 Wylie constructed the high timber boardwalk that encloses two sides of the pool, and two change rooms. The deck was elevated by a post and beam construction in blackbutt timber. The posts were embedded into sockets cut into the sandstone cliff face and into the large rocks at the base of the cliff. Wylie also constructed a concrete diving tower on the eastern wall. There was a slippery dip into the pool on the north-western corner. At some stage a second diving tower was located on the southern end. Night bathing and picnicking became popular when Wylie erected three lamp posts along the northern edge and also strung lights across the pool. None of these structures remain today, although the concrete wall on the eastern edge is still thickened at the location of the demolished diving tower, and the concrete bases of the lamp posts can still be seen along the northern edge. At a later date Wylie extended the timber platform, considerably increasing the size of the change rooms at either end.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

Entrance to the baths was from either Grant Reserve or Neptune Street. A fee was collected at the caretaker's cottage (which no longer exists) and swimming costumes issued. There were clothes lockers and possibly a refreshment outlet. The path wound down to timber stairs, which led to the change rooms (men's change room to the right and women's to the left).&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

Wylie's daughter was the well-known Olympic swimmer Wilhelmina (Mina) Wylie (1891-1984) who grew up in [[South Coogee, New South Wales|South Coogee]]. Mina Wiley and Sarah (Fanny) Durack (1889-1956) were Australia's first two female Olympic swimming representatives when they competed in the Stockholm Olympics in 1912 (the first Olympic Games to admit female swimmers). In the 100-metre freestyle race, Durack won the gold medal and Wylie the silver medal. Mina Wiley competed in NSW and Australian championships from 1906 to 1934, winning a total of 115 NSW and Australian titles. As Australia's first Olympic female swimmers, Durack and Wylie inaugurated a long tradition of Australian female swimming champions.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

Another well-known swimmer closely associated with Wylie's Baths is long-distance ocean swimmer, [[Des Renford]] {{post-nominals|country=AUS|MBE}} (1927-1999). Renford swam the English Channel 19 times, was a [[Papal Knight]] and is featured in the NSW Hall of Champions at the [[State Sports Centre]]. He was a regular all-year-round swimmer at Wylie's where he was always conceded the best lane "on the wall" and was a member of the Wylie's Baths Trust and active in the management of the baths. Other swimmers of note associated with Wylie's Baths include Fanny Durack, Bob Parry and Paul Gately.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

===Sunstrip Pool, (1959-1974)===
On 5 November 1959 the lease for Wiley's Baths was transferred to Desmond Selby, who paid an annual rent of $500. Selby renamed the baths "Sunset Pool" and proceeded to upgrade the facilities. Selby removed the existing change rooms and increased the width of the boardwalk. He rebuilt the change rooms on a much smaller scale to provide a larger deck area, catering to the then fashion for sunbathing. At this stage the majority of the balustrade was fully boarded leaving only seven central sections with horizontal timber rails. The northern end of the boardwalk past the women's change room led to an open sitting area which became a popular picnic spot with views over Coogee Beach. Selby used tram parts to construct the building and installed hot showers. Both change rooms had cement roofing and wooden panelling and were externally painted in a checkerboard design in cream and brown. He also added a kiosk and store on the boardwalk.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

===Closure and re-opening of the Baths (1974-1978)===
The buildings and pool were badly damaged in May 1974 by high seas and the pool was closed to the public. Another storm in 1977 caused further damage. In 1978 the baths were re-opened under the control of Randwick Municipal Council and reverted to the original name of Wylie's Baths. A Committee of Management was formed in September 1978, composed of representatives from the Randwick Council and various swimming clubs including  the South Maroubra Dolphins (formed 1960), Randwick/ Coogee Amateur Swimming Club (formed 1896), Randwick Digger's Swimming Club (formed 1936) and [[Coogee Surf Life Saving Club]].&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

===Restoration of the Baths 1995===
In 1994 Randwick City Council resolved to repair the baths in response to public pressure. The successful tenderers were architects [[Allen Jack+Cottier]], and restoration cost approximately $750,000. The work was completed early in 1995. In 1995 Allen, Jack &amp; Cottier were awarded the NSW Greenway Award for Conservation by the [[Royal Australian Institute of Architects]] for their restoration of Wylie's Baths. The work included restoring the boardwalk and building new amenities blocks. The work was praised by the RAIA for its sensitivity in recovering the essence of the original baths. While the nature and style of the new work was clearly modern, it paid attention to the genius loci of the baths, adding a new layer to its history.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;&lt;ref name=cottier-gold&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://architectureau.com/articles/raia-gold-medallist-3/ |date=1 March 2001 |title=RAIA Gold Medallist 2001 |work=Architecture Australia |accessdate=23 August 2016 |volume= 90 |number=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/obituaries/sense-of-community-ran-from-credit-unions-to-wylies-baths-20091019-h4vr.html |title=Sense of community ran from credit unions to Wylies Baths: Maurie Daly, 1934-2009 |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=20 October 2009 |author1=Daly, Gary |author2=Veitch, Harriet }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 Wylie's Baths Trust was established to manage the baths. The Trust consists of representatives of the four local swimming clubs, three local residents and a representative of the Randwick City Council.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

===Photography at the Baths===
In recent years Wylie's Baths has become popular subject for both amateur and professional photographers. The dramatic cliff-hugging location of the baths is one aspect of their photographic appeal, as is the nostalgic seaside appeal of the wooden structures.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

== Description ==
Wylie's Baths is located on the rocks at  the southern end of Coogee Beach with an entrance off Neptune Street via Grant Reserve.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

The pool is a rock and concrete pool {{convert|50|m}} by {{convert|30|m}} located on a natural rock shelf below the high tide mark with concrete walls around four sides. It measures {{convert|50|m}} long and {{convert|30|m}} wide (to provide a {{convert|50|yd|adj=on}} Olympic swimming length) and the depth of the pool varies from about {{convert|0.5|m}} in the south-west corner to about {{convert|1.6|m}} in the north-east corner. It is flushed twice daily by tidal action.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

A high prominent timber boardwalk supported on timber posts wraps around the rock face on two sides of the pool and is clearly visible from Coogee Beach. Three sets of timber [[stairs]] lead down to the pool and rock shelf from the boardwalk. Amenities include men's and women's change rooms, kiosk and store. A steel fence runs around the northern and eastern sides of the pool, preventing access to the rocks.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

=== Condition ===

As at 30 January 2003, following extensive restoration in 1995, the baths are in good condition.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt; Wylie's Baths have been repaired and altered over time. These alterations have been necessary for maintenance especially given the harshness of the marine environment. These alterations have tended to preserve the original vernacular nature of the buildings and contributed to a sense of continuity in the built forms.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt; The extensive restoration by Allen Jack+Cottier in 1995 was praised by the RAIA for its sensitivity in recovering of the original essence of the baths while upgrading and modernising the facilities.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt; Following the 1995 restoration, Wylie's Baths are in good condition.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

=== Modifications and dates ===
*1907 Wylie's Baths opened on 12 December.
*1912 high timber boardwork and change rooms constructed.
*1959 change rooms replaced and boardwork increased in width, the familiar chequerboard walling added. Kiosk and store added.
*1974 baths closed due to storm damage.
*1977 further storm damage.
*1991 stainless steel railing replaced old timber and chain railing.
*1995 restoration work by Allen Jack+Cottier and baths re-opened.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

== Heritage listing ==
As at 29 October 2004, Wylie's Baths is of State significance as one of NSW's oldest, most intact and best-known ocean swimming pools. It is also significant for the possibility that its location was special to Aboriginal women's business. Built in 1907, Wylie's Baths survives as a turn-of-the-century bathing complex, including an Olympic-size pool, elevated boardwalk, change rooms, kiosk and store, which evidences the development of sport and recreational facilities in Sydney.  Wylie's Baths has been used for many competitive and recreational events, including amateur swimming clubs, fitness training, learn-to-swim classes as well as for general swimming, sunbathing and as a popular gathering place. Wylie's Baths has been held in great affection by generations of Sydneysiders.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

Wylie's Baths is closely associated with the development of competitive swimming in Australia and with many swimmers of note, including Henry Alexander Wylie, Mina Wylie and Sarah (Fanny) Durack&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677-3118&gt;Olympic champions, Stockholm 1912&lt;/ref&gt; and Des Renford (long-distance ocean swimmer). It is one of a group of significant Sydney harbour and ocean pools associated with Australian swimming champions. Because of its association with the inaugural championship swimming of Mina Wiley and Fanny Durack at the Stockholm Olympics of 1912, Wylie's Baths is especially associated with Australian women's swimming.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

Wylie's Baths is a well-known Sydney landmark, clearly visible from Coogee Beach and making use of its spectacular ocean setting. It is a popular subject with photographers and makes a large contribution to Coogee's identity as a seaside destination. The elevated timber boardwalk is architecturally striking and rare in Sydney. It is a good example of vernacular architecture and an ingenious design solution to the problem of providing amenities on a steep cliff face.  Recent restoration of the baths by Allen Jack and Cottier in 1995 won the RAIA Greenway Medal for Conservation and was praised for its sensitivity in preserving the integrity of the original swimming pool complex.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

Wylie's Baths may have significance and special meaning for Aboriginal groups, both pre and post-contact. There may be special associations with Aboriginal women and birthing but further research is required.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

Wylie's Baths was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 14 November 2003 having satisfied the following criteria.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''

It is thought that the location for Wylie's Baths may be, or may be near a place that was special to Aboriginal women's business, possibly associated with birthing, although more research needs to be done to confirm this.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

Wylie's Baths survives as one example of the numerous seaside attractions built  at Coogee Beach around the turn of the twentieth century to attract visitors and day-trippers, with other attractions including an aquarium, pier, shark net, floodlighting etc. The construction of Wylie's Baths in 1907 coincided with an emerging interest in seaside baths in Sydney. Wylie's Baths forms a group with the three other ocean pools at Coogee Beach which date from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries: McIver Women's Baths (built 1886); Giles, former men's only (built 1902); and the Ross Jones Memorial Pool (built 1947). It is claimed in the National Trust survey of ocean and harbour pools that Wylie's Baths is the oldest surviving communal sea baths in Australia.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

Wylie's Baths is also historically significant in the development of amateur swimming clubs in Sydney and the development of competitive swimming in Australia. It forms a group with a number of other early Olympic-sized harbour and ocean swimming pools in Sydney built between the 1880s and the First World War to cater to the popularity of competitive swimming. This group of early pools predate the main construction phase of ocean pools in the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

'''The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.'''

Wylie's Baths is strongly associated with the Wylie family who were important in the development of competitive swimming in Australia. Wylie's Baths was built by Henry Alexander Wylie who was a champion long-distance and underwater swimmer. He managed the baths from 1907 until 1959.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

Wylie's Baths is closely associated with many swimmers of note including female Olympic champions, Mina Wylie and Sarah (Fanny) Durack, and long-distance swimmer, Des Renford.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

Wilhelmina (Mina) Wylie (1891-1984) was the daughter of Henry Alexander Wylie and an early female swimming champion. Together with Sarah (Fanny) Durack (1889-1956), Mina Wylie represented Australia at the 1912 Stockholm Olympics (the first Olympic Games to admit female swimmers). Durack won the gold medal and Wylie the silver for the 100 metres freestyle. In an extraordinary swimming career which spanned from 1906 to 1934 Mina Wylie won every NSW and Australian swimming title (a total of 115), making her and Fanny Durack the first in a long line of Australian female swimming champions.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

Mina Wylie was also important in promoting women's swimming. She, with Rose McIver, formed the Randwick Coogee Ladies Amateur Swimming Club which has managed the Women's Baths just north of Wylie's since 1922.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

Wylie's Baths is also strongly associated with long-distance ocean swimming champion, Des Renford (1927-1999) was swam the English Channel 19 times, was awarded an MBE, and was a regular swimmer at Wylie's and active in the management of the Wylie's Baths Trust.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

Wylie's Baths is one of a group of harbour and ocean swimming pools which have strong associations with an Australian swimming champion. Others include the Andrew (Boy) [[Charlton, Queensland|Charlton]] Pool in the Domain and the Dawn Fraser Swimming Pool in Balmain and the McIver Women's Baths in Coogee, the Lavender Bay Baths, now demolished (associated with the Cavill family).&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

Wylie's Baths is also associated with the architects, Allen Jack and Cottier, whose conservation work was awarded the 1995 Greenway Award for Conservation by the Royal Australian Institute of Architects.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''

Wylie's Baths, located on the rocks at the southern end of Coogee Beach, makes use of a dramatic ocean setting. The raised timber boardwalk is architecturally striking and wraps around the rock face on two sides. It offers uninterrupted views across the water and rocks to Coogee Beach. The baths are a popular swimming and picnic spot.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

The baths and the raised boardwalk are also very prominent and clearly visible from Coogee Beach. The baths have become a well-known Sydney landmark and closely identified with Coogee Beach as a holiday seaside destination.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

The baths, despite recent extensive conservation, survive as possibly the last intact example of a turn-of-the-century ocean swimming complex, complete with timber boardwalk, change rooms, kiosk and store. The raised boardwalk, in particular, is rare among Sydney ocean and harbour pools for its size and construction. It offers an ingenious design solution to the problem of providing amenities on a steep cliff face site and represents a good example of vernacular architecture.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

Wylie's Baths has also become a popular subject for amateur and professional photographers. Photographic studies typically feature the dramatic ocean setting, the stark architectural qualities of the wooden structures, and the nostalgic seaside appeal of the setting.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

'''The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''

Wylie's Baths has social significance for the generations of Sydneysiders who have visited the baths since they opened in 1907. The baths are held in great affection for their associations with seaside holiday memories and recreational swimming. The baths have been used for many competitive and recreational events, including amateur swimming clubs, fitness training, learn-to-swim classes as well as for general swimming, sunbathing and as a popular gathering place.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

Wylie's Baths is also significant to a number of local Coogee amateur swimming clubs: South Maroubra Dolphins (formed 1960), Randwick / Coogee Amateur Swimming Club (formed 1896), Randwick Digger's Swimming Club (formed 1936) and Coogee Surf Life Saving Club. These clubs have had a long involvement with the site and were instrumental in re-opening Wylie's Baths after the storm damage in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

Wylie's Baths is highly significant to the Coogee community as a local landmark and as contributing to the sense of place and identity of Coogee of a seaside resort. The high esteem in which it is held is demonstrated by the community agitation for its conservation and re-opening following the damage by storms in the 1970s. The local community continues to be involved in the ongoing management of the baths via the Wylie's Baths Trust, which consists of representatives from local swimming clubs, the general public and Randwick Council.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

Wylie's Baths is also held in high regard by the wider Sydney Community as a landmark and for its historical significance as an ocean pool. This esteem is demonstrated by the numerous heritage listings for the baths (Randwick City Council LEP, [[National Trust of Australia]] (NSW), Australian Heritage Commission - interim).&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''

Due to the harshness of the marine environment and the European occupation of the site since the 1900s, Wylie's Baths is unlikely to yield any archaeological evidence of former Aboriginal occupation or European occupation in the nineteenth century. Nor is the site likely to yield further scientific information in relation to the natural environment.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

The pool and the unusual timber boardwalk, despite various modifications over time, have potential to yield further information on turn-of-the-century vernacular construction techniques and as such are of technical and research significance.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

The baths may have significance and special meaning for Aboriginal groups, both pre and post-contact. Further research is required to investigate this possibility.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''

Wylie's Baths can be considered rare among Sydney's ocean and harbour pools in surviving as a complete turn-of-the-century swimming complex that includes an Olympic-sized pool, boardwalk, men's and women's change rooms, kiosk and store. The sensitivity of the recent conservation works, completed in 1995, has respected and preserved the integrity of the original swimming complex.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

The size and height of the timber boardwalk at Wylie's Baths is possibly unique amongst Sydney ocean and harbour pools. The boardwalk is a well-known Sydney landmark and survives where other once-common timber boardwalks have not. As such, it is rare.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''

Wylie's Baths is a good representative example of an ocean swimming pool built around Sydney's ocean beaches and harbour foreshores in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In being built of rock and concrete, the pool shares construction features with a number of other Sydney pools, including Bondi, [[Fairlight, New South Wales|Fairlight]] and [[Narrabeen]] Pools. These pools largely rely on tidal flushing to clean the water and pre-date the use of chlorination.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;

Wylie's Baths also has a timber boardwalk in common with a number of pools, including the Dawn Fraser Pool in Balmain, [[Northbridge, New South Wales|Northbridge]] Baths and Redleaf Pool in [[Double Bay, New South Wales|Double Bay]]. Because of the need for ongoing repair and maintenance of these timber structures, some others have not survived.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1677/&gt;
