The '''Ch'ing-yang event of 1490''' (also '''Ch'ing-yang''', '''Chi-ing-yang''' or '''Chíing-yang meteor shower''') is a presumed [[meteor shower]] or [[List of meteor air bursts|air burst]] in [[Qingyang|Qìngyáng]] (Ch'ing-Yang, {{zh|s=庆阳|t=慶陽}}) in March or April 1490.&lt;ref name="Meteoritics-1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Webb" /&gt; The area was in the district of [[Shaanxi]] (陕西, now part of [[Gansu]] 甘肃 Province). If a meteor shower did occur, it may have been the result of the disintegration of an [[asteroid]] during an [[atmospheric entry]] [[air burst]].

A large number of deaths were recorded in historical Chinese accounts of the meteor shower, but have not been confirmed by researchers in the modern era. In the same year, Asian astronomers coincidentally discovered comet&amp;nbsp;C/1490&amp;nbsp;Y1, a possible progenitor of the [[Quadrantids|Quadrantid meteor showers]].

==Meteor shower==
At least three surviving Chinese historical records describe a shower during which "stones fell like rain", killing more than 10,000 people. At least one report of the event is found in the [[History of Ming|official History of the Ming Dynasty]], and other journal records which describe the event are also generally considered reliable.&lt;ref name="Sky&amp;Telescope" /&gt; But the official Ming Dynasty history omits the number of casualties, which has been frequently either doubted or discounted by present-day researchers.&lt;ref name="Meteoritics-1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gritzner" /&gt;

Due to the paucity of detailed information and the lack of surviving meteorites or other physical evidence, researchers have also been unable to definitively state the exact nature of the dramatic event,&lt;ref name="NBCNews-2013.02.14" /&gt; even examining the possible occurrence of severe hail.&lt;ref name="Meteoritics-1994" /&gt; However Kevin Yau ''et al.'' of [[NASA]]'s [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] did note several similarities of the Ch'ing-yang meteor fall to the [[Tunguska event]], which would have destroyed a highly populous district.&lt;ref name="Meteoritics-1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewis" /&gt;

One surviving account records:&lt;ref name="Meteoritics-1994" /&gt;
{{quote|text="Stones fell like rain in the Ch’ing-yang district. The larger ones were 4 to 5 [[Catty|catties]] (斤, about 1.5 kg), and the smaller ones were 2 to 3 catties (about 1 kg). Numerous stones rained in Ch'ing-yang. Their sizes were all different. The larger ones were like goose's eggs and the smaller ones were like water-chestnuts. More than 10,000 people were struck dead. All of the people in the city fled to other places."}}

One source of Chinese astronomical information of celestial events, the ''Zhongguo gudai tianxiang jilu zongji'' (Complete collection of records of celestial phenomena in ancient China) records ten works that discuss the March–April 1490 event,&lt;ref name="Webb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CAS" /&gt; including the official History of the Ming Dynasty. Additionally there are records of it in local gazettes and histories of the region.&lt;ref name="Webb" /&gt; The ''[[History of Ming]]'' work (the 明史, or Míng Shǐ) states only that there was a rain of uncountable stones of various sizes. The large objects were as big "as a goose egg, and the small ones were the size of the fruit of an aquatic plant". The date given was the third [[lunar month]] of 1490, which translates as March 21 to April 19, 1490.&lt;ref name="Webb" /&gt;

Although the Ming Dynasty history did not record the number of deaths or injuries, other sources do. One semi-official document recorded that a provincial Shaanxi official reported there had been a rain of stones that weighed as much as 4–5 [[Chinese units of measurement#Mass units in the People's Republic of China since 1959|jin]] (市斤), down to 2–3 jin (modern jins being 605 grams). The number of deaths in this account was in the several tens of thousands.&lt;ref name="Webb" /&gt; The semi-official report and two others date the event to the second lunar month with one source dating the event as April 4, 1490, part of the 3rd lunar month.&lt;ref name="Webb" /&gt;

==Coincidental comet==
In 2007 astronomers determined that the annual January [[Quadrantids|Quadrantid meteor shower]] may have originated with the disintegration of Comet&amp;nbsp;C/1490&amp;nbsp;Y1, approximately a century after it was first identified in 1490 by Chinese, Japanese, and Korean astronomers.&lt;ref name="Haines" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ball" /&gt; A connection with asteroid [[(196256) 2003 EH1]] has also been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Orbital Elements of Comet C/1490 Y1 and the Quadrantid shower|year=2009|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.15535.x|publisher=Cornell University Library|author=Ki-Won Lee|author2=Hong-Jin Yang|author3=Myeong-Gu Park|arxiv=0908.2547|bibcode=2009MNRAS.400.1389L}}&lt;/ref&gt; The large difference between the timing of the January meteor showers and the 1490 Ch'ing-yang event—which occurred in March or April 1490 CE—makes a relationship between the comet and the Ch'ing-yang event appear unlikely.{{Citation needed|reason=Doesn't cite any reference|date=October 2017}}

[[Image:A little joy.jpg|thumb|right|''A Practical Handbook of British Beetles'' vol. 1 (1997 reprint)]]
'''''A Practical Handbook of British Beetles''''' {{ISBN|0-900848-91-X}} is a two-volume work on the British [[beetle]] fauna, by [[Norman H. Joy]], first published by [[H. F. &amp; G. Witherby]] in January 1932. 

== Contents ==
Volume one (xxviii + 622 pages) consists of the text (largely a set of identification keys, with brief status notes for each species). Volume two (194 pages) contains 2040 line-drawings of whole beetles and features referred to in the keys (390 of these were taken from Spry and [[William Edward Shuckard|Shuckard]]'s 1840 publication ''The British Coleoptera Delineated'' but the remainder were drawn by Joy). 

The book covers a fauna of about 3560 different species and has an emphasis on species identification, being "essentially a manual of identification for the use of collectors."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=IMMS|first=A. D.|date=6 August 1932|title=A Practical Handbook of British Beetles|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/130186a0|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=130|issue=3275|pages=186–187|doi=10.1038/130186a0|issn=0028-0836|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A reduced-size reprint was produced by [[E. W. Classey]] in 1976, and again in 1997, while Pisces Conservation released an electronic version in 2009, solving a longstanding problem of availability.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.piscesconservation.com/cube/e-books/entomology-etc/practical-handbook-of-british-beetles.html|title=Practical Handbook of British Beetles - Pisces Conservation - online shop|website=www.piscesconservation.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
One of the main points of attraction for Joy's book was its reasonable price. According to a 1932 review in [[Nature (journal)|Nature]], [[William Weekes Fowler]]'s standard work ''The Coleoptera of the British Islands'' (1887–1891, 1913) was "beyond the means of most students and collectors of insects", while ''A Practical Handbook'' offered a much more affordable option.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Legacy ==
''A Practical Handbook of British Beetles'' instantly became one of the important works on British coleoptera, already being referred to as a classic by the 1956 [[Royal Entomological Society Handbooks|Handbooks for the Identification of British Insects]] volume on beetles, which uses it as one of the major works to be cross-referenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.royensoc.co.uk/sites/default/files/Vol04_Part01.pdf|title=Coleoptera.

Despite its age, it has remained the standard work on the identification of British beetles into the 21st century,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; although the [[British Entomological and Natural History Society]] produced a companion volume, ''[[New British Beetles - species not in Joy's practical handbook]]'' by [[Peter J. Hodge]] and [[Richard A. Jones (entomologist)|Richard A. Jones]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ro/books/about/New_British_Beetles.html?id=cb6tOQAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=New British Beetles: Species Not in Joy's Practical Handbook|last=Hodge|first=Peter J.|last2=Jones|first2=Richard A.|date=1995|publisher=British Entomological and Natural History Society|isbn=9781899935017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; British coleopterists refer to the book colloquially simply as "Joy".

'''Ali Dinar''' ({{lang-ar|علي دينار}}) (1856 – November 6, 1916) was a [[Sultan]] of the [[Sultanate of Darfur]] and ruler from the [[Keira dynasty]].  
  
In 1898, with the decline of the [[Mahdist Sudan|Mahdists]], He managed to regain Darfurs independence.

A rebellion led by him in 1915—in the context of his giving his support to the [[Ottoman Empire]] during the [[First World War]]—provoked the British to launch a [[punitive expedition]], the [[Anglo-Egyptian Darfur Expedition]], in which he was killed, After which his Sultanate was incorporated into the [[Anglo-Egyptian Condominium]].

'''Bendigo State Park''' is a {{convert|100.26|acre|adj=on}} [[List of Pennsylvania state parks|Pennsylvania state park]] in [[Jones Township, Elk County, Pennsylvania|Jones Township]], [[Elk County, Pennsylvania|Elk County]], [[Pennsylvania]] in the United States.
The park is in a [[valley]] on the [[Clarion River|East Branch Clarion River]]. {{convert|20|acre}} of the park are developed. The other {{convert|80|acre}} are undeveloped woodlands of [[beech]], [[birch]], [[cherry]] and [[maple]].

==History==
Bendigo State Park is named for an [[Ireland|Irish]] [[tavern]] keeper, who lived in [[England]], named [[William Thompson (boxer)|William Thompson]]. Thompson was also a [[prizefighter]] of some renown. [[Boxing]] for money was illegal at the time in England and Thompson was arrested 28 times for breaking the law. Legend holds that Thompson fled to America, to avoid prosecution, when an opponent died in the ring due to injuries sustained in the fight. He adopted the name Bendigo, a corruption of the [[Old Testament]] name Abed-nego and moved to the frontier of northwestern Pennsylvania. The newly named, Bendigo, began serving as a [[Methodist]] [[Evangelism|evangelist]] while also working on the [[Rail transport|railroads]]. He was a very tall and strong man and soon became a favorite of his [[Italian people|Italian]] co-workers. No records exist to support the claim that Thompson ever left the British Isles let alone lived in the area.&lt;ref name="bendigosp"/&gt; The [[lumber]] industry was beginning to boom in northwestern Pennsylvania as Bendigo was making his rounds as an evangelist and a mill town in Elk County was named Bendigo in his honor. The lumber era was not to last forever. The forests were largely chopped down by the early 20th century and many of the mill towns, like Bendigo, were abandoned.&lt;ref name="bendigosp"&gt;{{cite web

The [[borough (Pennsylvania)|borough]] of Johnsonburg acquired the land that is currently Bendigo State Park in the 1920s and established a community park. The [[Works Progress Administration]] of [[U.S. President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] made many improvements to the park during the [[Great Depression]]. [[Flood]]ing on the East Branch of the Clarion River destroyed most of the works of the WPA in the 1940s, but a stone wall and dam on the river are still standing. Ownership of the park was transferred to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1949 and over the course of ten years improvements were made. Bendigo State Park was formally opened to the public on August 15, 1959.&lt;ref name="bendigosp"/&gt; The park is at an elevation of {{convert|1493|ft}}.&lt;ref name="gnis"&gt;{{cite web

==Recreation==
Bendigo State Park attracts families interested in using the [[human swimming|swimming]] and picnicking facilities. The pool is opened daily from 11:00 am until 7:00 pm beginning [[Memorial Day]] weekend and ending [[Labor Day]] weekend. There are over 150 picnic tables in several [[picnic]] areas. The picnic areas have [[grilling|charcoal grills]], drinking water, [[Horseshoes|horseshoe]] pits and restrooms.&lt;ref name="bendigosp"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17626">In [[astronomy]], the '''binary mass function''' or simply '''mass function''' is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] that constrains the [[mass]] of the unseen component (typically a [[star]] or [[exoplanet]]) in a single-lined spectroscopic [[binary star]] or in a [[planetary system]]. It can be calculated from [[Observation|observable]] quantities only, namely the [[orbital period]] of the binary system, and the peak [[radial velocity]] of the observed star. The velocity of one binary component and the orbital period provide (limited) information on the separation and gravitational force between the two components, and hence on the masses of the components.

== Introduction ==
[[File:orbit2.gif|160px|frame|Two bodies orbiting a common center of mass, indicated by the red plus. The larger body has a higher mass, and therefore a smaller orbit and a lower orbital velocity than its lower-mass companion.]] 
The binary mass function follows from [[Kepler's third law]] when the radial velocity of one (observed) binary component is introduced.&lt;ref name="karttunen"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Karttunen |editor1-first=Hannu |editor2-last=Kröger |editor2-first=Pekka |editor3-last=Oja |editor3-first=Heikki |editor4-last=Poutanen |editor4-first=Markku |editor5-last=Donner |editor5-first=Karl J. |title=Fundamental Astronomy |publisher=[[Springer Verlag]] |date=2007 |orig-year=1st pub. 1987 |pages=221–227 |chapter=Chapter 9: Binary Stars and Stellar Masses |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=DjeVdb0sLEAC&amp;pg=PA221|isbn=978-3-540-34143-7 |lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Kepler's third law describes the motion of two bodies orbiting a common [[center of mass]]. It relates the orbital period (the time it takes to complete one full orbit) with the distance between the two bodies (the orbital separation), and the sum of their masses. For a given orbital separation, a higher total system mass implies higher [[Orbital speed|orbital velocities]]. On the other hand, for a given system mass, a longer orbital period implies a larger separation and lower orbital velocities.

Because the orbital period and orbital velocities in the binary system are related to the masses of the binary components, measuring these parameters provides some information about the masses of one or both components.&lt;ref name="podsiadlowski"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-astro.physics.ox.ac.uk/~podsi/binaries.pdf |title=The Evolution of Binary Systems, in Accretion Processes in Astrophysics |first1=Philipp |last1=Podsiadlowski |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |access-date=April 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But because the true orbital velocity cannot be determined generally, this information is limited.&lt;ref name="karttunen" /&gt;

Radial velocity is the velocity component of orbital velocity in the line of sight of the observer. Unlike true orbital velocity, radial velocity can be determined from [[Doppler spectroscopy]] of [[spectral line]]s in the light of a star,&lt;ref name="radial"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.planetary.org/explore/space-topics/exoplanets/radial-velocity.html |title=Radial Velocity – The First Method that Worked |publisher=[[The Planetary Society]] |access-date=April 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or from [[pulsar timing|variations in the arrival times]] of pulses from a [[radio pulsar]].&lt;ref name="cornell"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astro.cornell.edu/academics/courses/astro201/psr1913.htm |title=The Binary Pulsar PSR 1913+16 |publisher=[[Cornell University]] |access-date=April 26, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A binary system is called a single-lined spectroscopic binary if the radial motion of only one of the two binary components can be measured. In this case, a lower limit on the mass of the ''other'' (unseen) component can be determined.&lt;ref name="karttunen" /&gt;

The true mass and true orbital velocity cannot be determined from the radial velocity because the [[orbital inclination]] is generally unknown. (The inclination is the orientation of the orbit from the point of view of the observer, and relates true and radial velocity.&lt;ref name="karttunen" /&gt;) This causes a degeneracy between mass and inclination.&lt;ref name="brown"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/805/2/188|title=True Masses of Radial-Velocity Exoplanets|year=2015|last1=

== Derivation for a circular orbit ==
[[File:Doppler Shift vs Time.jpg|frame|Radial velocity curve with peak radial velocity ''K''=1 m/s and orbital period 2 years.]]
The peak radial velocity &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity curve, as shown in the figure. The orbital period &lt;math&gt;P_\mathrm{orb}&lt;/math&gt; is found from the periodicity in the radial velocity curve. These are the two observable quantities needed to calculate the binary mass function.&lt;ref name="podsiadlowski" /&gt;

The observed object of which the radial velocity can be measured is taken to be object 1 in this article, its unseen companion is object 2.

Let &lt;math&gt;M_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M_{2}&lt;/math&gt; be the stellar masses, with &lt;math&gt;M_{1} + M_{2} = M_\mathrm{tot}&lt;/math&gt; the total mass of the binary system, &lt;math&gt;v_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_{2}&lt;/math&gt; the orbital velocities, and &lt;math&gt;a_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_{2}&lt;/math&gt; the distances of the objects to the center of mass. &lt;math&gt;a_{1}+a_{2} = a&lt;/math&gt; is the [[semi-major axis]] (orbital separation) of the binary system.

We start out with Kepler's third law, with &lt;math&gt;\omega_\mathrm{orb} = 2 \pi/P_\mathrm{orb}&lt;/math&gt; the [[Angular frequency|orbital frequency]] and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; the [[gravitational constant]],

&lt;math&gt;GM_\mathrm{tot} = \omega_\mathrm{orb}^{2} a^{3}.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the definition of the center of mass location, &lt;math&gt;M_{1} a_{1} = M_{2} a_{2}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name="karttunen" /&gt; we can write

&lt;math&gt;a = a_{1} + a_{2} = a_{1} \left(1 + \frac{a_{2}}{a_{1}}\right) = a_{1} \left(1 + \frac{M_{1}}{M_{2}}\right) = \frac{a_{1}}{M_{2}} (M_{1} + M_{2}) = \frac{a_{1} M_\mathrm{tot}}{M_{2}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Inserting this expression for &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; into Kepler's third law, we find

&lt;math&gt;GM_\mathrm{tot} = \omega_\mathrm{orb}^{2} \frac{a_{1}^{3}  M_\mathrm{tot}^{3}}{M_{2}^{3}}.&lt;/math&gt;

which can be rewritten to

&lt;math&gt;\frac{M_{2}^{3}}{M_\mathrm{tot}^{2}} = \frac{\omega_\mathrm{orb}^{2} a_{1}^{3}}{G}.&lt;/math&gt;

The peak radial velocity of object 1, &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, depends on the orbital inclination &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; (an inclination of 0° corresponds to an orbit seen face-on, an inclination of 90° corresponds to an orbit seen edge-on). For a circular orbit ([[orbital eccentricity]] = 0) it is given by&lt;ref name="tauris"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tauris |first1=T.M. |last2=van den Heuvel |first2=E.P.J. |author2-link=Ed van den Heuvel |editor1-last=Lewin |editor1-first=Walter |editor1-link=Walter Lewin |editor2-last=van der Klis |editor2-first=Michiel  |editor2-link=Michiel van der Klis |title=Compact stellar X-ray sources |publisher=Cambridge, UK: [[Cambridge University Press]] |date=2006 |pages=623–665 |chapter=Chapter 16: Formation and evolution of compact stellar X-ray sources |arxiv=astro-ph/0303456 |isbn=978-0-521-82659-4 |doi=10.2277/0521826594 |lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;K = v_{1} \mathrm{sin} i = \omega_\mathrm{orb} a_{1} \mathrm{sin} i.&lt;/math&gt;

After substituting &lt;math&gt;a_{1}&lt;/math&gt; we obtain

&lt;math&gt;\frac{M_{2}^{3}}{M_\mathrm{tot}^{2}} = \frac{K^{3}}{G \omega_\mathrm{orb} \mathrm{sin}^{3} i}.&lt;/math&gt;

For an estimated or assumed mass &lt;math&gt;M_{1}&lt;/math&gt; of the observed object 1, a [[minimum mass]] &lt;math&gt;M_\mathrm{2, min}&lt;/math&gt; can be determined for the unseen object 2 by assuming &lt;math&gt;i = 90^{\circ}&lt;/math&gt;. The true mass &lt;math&gt;M_{2}&lt;/math&gt; depends on the orbital inclination. The inclination is typically not known, but to some extent it can be determined from observed [[Transit (astronomy)|eclipses]],&lt;ref name="podsiadlowski" /&gt; be constrained from the non-observation of eclipses,&lt;ref name="bailes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kerkwijk" /&gt; or be modelled using ellipsoidal variations (the non-spherical shape of a star in binary system leads to variations in brightness over the course of an orbit that depend on the system's inclination).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cmi2.yale.edu/bh/week4/pages/page5.html |title=The Orbital Inclination |publisher=[[Yale University]] |access-date=February 17, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limits===

In the case of &lt;math&gt;M_{1} \gg M_{2}&lt;/math&gt; (for example, when the unseen object is an exoplanet&lt;ref name="bailes" /&gt;), the mass function simplifies to

&lt;math&gt;f \approx \frac{M_{2}^{3}\ \mathrm{sin}^{3}i }{M_{1}^{2}}.&lt;/math&gt;

In the other extreme, when &lt;math&gt;M_{1} \ll M_{2}&lt;/math&gt; (for example, when the unseen object is a high-mass [[black hole]]), the mass function becomes&lt;ref name="podsiadlowski" /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;f \approx M_{2}\ \mathrm{sin}^{3}i,&lt;/math&gt;

and since &lt;math&gt;0 \leq \sin(i) \leq 1&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;0^{\circ} \leq i \leq 90^{\circ}&lt;/math&gt;, the mass function gives a lower limit on the mass of the unseen object 2.&lt;ref name="larson" /&gt;

In general, for any &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;M_{1}&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;M_{2} &gt; \mathrm{max}\left(f, f^{1/3} M_{1}^{2/3}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

== Eccentric orbit ==

In an orbit with eccentricity &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, the mass function is given by&lt;ref name="tauris" /&gt;&lt;ref name="boffin"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Boffin |first1=H. M.

== Applications ==

=== X-ray binaries ===
If the accretor in an [[X-ray binary]] has a minimum mass that significantly exceeds the [[Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit]] (the maximum possible mass for a [[neutron star]]), it is expected to be a black hole. This is the case in [[Cygnus X-1]], for example, where the radial velocity of the companion star has been measured.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Mauder | first=H. | date=1973 | title=On the Mass Limit of the X-ray Source in Cygnus X-1 | bibcode=1973A&amp;A....28..473M | journal=[[Astronomy and Astrophysics]] | volume=28 | pages=473–475}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eagle.phys.utk.edu/guidry/astro421/lectures/lecture490_ch15.pdf |title=Observational Evidence for Black Holes |publisher=[[University of Tennessee]] |access-date=November 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exoplanets ===
An [[exoplanet]] causes its host star to move in a small orbit around the center of mass of the star-planet system. This 'wobble' can be observed if the radial velocity of the star is sufficiently high. This is the [[Methods of detecting exoplanets|radial velocity method]] of detecting exoplanets.&lt;ref name="brown" /&gt;&lt;ref name="radial" /&gt; Using the mass function and the radial velocity of the host star, the minimum mass of an exoplanet can be determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://exoplanets.org/methodology.html |title=Documentation and Methodology |publisher=[[Exoplanet Data Explorer]] |access-date=April 25, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1086/504701|title=Catalog of Nearby Exoplanets|year=2006|last1=Butler|first1=R.P.|author1-link=R.

'''BlueNext''' was a [[Europe]]an environmental trading [[Exchange (organized market)|exchange]], considered the largest CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; permit spot market,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601072&amp;sid=ayhabpPvEg74  BlueNext Helps Unwind Trades in Recycled CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Dispute]&lt;/ref&gt; with headquarters in [[Paris]], [[France]]. On October 26, 2012, BlueNext announced that it would close permanently its spot and derivatives trading operations as of December 5, 2012.

== Overview ==
BlueNext was founded in December 2007 when [[NYSE Euronext]] and [[Caisse des Dépôts]] purchased the [[carbon market]] from [[Powernext|PowerNext]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.watersonline.com/public/showPage.html?validate=0&amp;page=dwt_login&amp;url=%2Fpublic%2FshowPage.html%3Fpage%3D698093  Article in Dealing with Technology (DWT)]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
NYSE Euronext holds a 60 percent majority stake in BlueNext and Caisse des Dépôts owns the other 40 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecoseed.org/en/general-green-news/5177-Spot-carbon-trading-kicks-off-on-BlueNext  Spot carbon trading kicks off on BlueNext]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; PowerNext continues to operate its electricity market separately.

Members of BlueNext are offered [[Spot market|spot]] trading of carbon (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) emission rights and [[Derivative (finance)|derivative]] products (futures) on [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme|European Union Allowances]] ([[European Union Emission Trading Scheme|EUAs]]) and [[Certified Emission Reduction]]s ([[Certified Emission Reduction|CERs]]). [[LCH.Clearnet]] SA provides clearing services for BlueNext futures EUA and BlueNext futures CER.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lchclearnet.com/energy/bluenext/ LCH.Clearnet official site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713192744/http://www.lchclearnet.com/energy/bluenext/ |date=July 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an expansion to their existing products and services, BlueNext began offering auction services, and as a result of strategic partnership with [[Markit]] issued their first index, the Markit BlueNext EUA Spot Index.

=== NYSE Blue ===
NYSE Euronext and APX announced on September 7, 2010 plans for a join venture, NYSE Blue, that will focus exclusively on environmental and sustainable energy markets, and expansion of these services in North America and Asia. NYSE Euronext will contribute its ownership in BlueNext in return for a majority interest in the joint venture, while APX will contribute its business (operational, regulatory infrastructure and services for the environmental and sustainable energy markets) in return for a minority interest in the venture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== China ===
China is the world’s leading source of greenhouse gases and is identified as the source of more than 80 percent of carbon credits traded globally. In June 2009, BlueNext and the [[China Beijing Environmental Exchange]] ([[China Beijing Environmental Exchange|CBEEX]]) signed an agreement to set up an international carbon-trading related information platform that would jointly publish and promote [[Clean Development Mechanism]] ([[Clean Development Mechanism|CDM]]) projects based in China. This information is to be sourced from the China Beijing Environmental Exchange.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124528865769526163 BlueNext, China Exchange Partner on Carbon Credits]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exchange-handbook.co.uk/index.cfm?section=news&amp;action=detail&amp;id=83357 World's Biggest Carbon Offset Exchange Comes One Step Closer To Reality As NYSE’s BlueNext And China-Beijing Environmental Exchange Sign China Partnership]&lt;/ref&gt;

The second joint project between BlueNext and CBEEX is the Panda Standard – the first voluntary standard designed specifically for China and the Chinese carbon marketplace, with an initial primary focus on agriculture and forestry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mondaq.com/article.asp?articleid=93854 China: The First Chinese Standard for Voluntary Greenhouse Gas Offset]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
BlueNext announced its intention to extend its presence into the United States. The company is currently going through a period of study and research to design products for this North American market.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14121">The '''Chinese national carbon trading scheme''' is a cap and trade system for carbon dioxide emissions set to be implemented by the end of 2017. This [[Emissions trading|emission trading scheme]] (ETS) creates a carbon market where emitters can buy and sell emission credits. From this scheme, China can limit emissions, but allow economic freedom for emitters to reduce emissions or purchase emission allowances from other emitters. China is currently the largest emitter of greenhouse gases and many major Chinese cities have severe air pollution.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With this plan, China will soon be the largest market in carbon trading.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The scheme will limit emissions from six of China’s top carbon dioxide emitting industries, including coal-fired power plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/china-will-start-the-world-s-largest-carbon-trading-market/|title=China Will Start the World's Largest Carbon Trading Market|last=Fialka,ClimateWire|first=John|work=Scientific American|access-date=2017-05-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; China was able to gain experience in drafting and implementation of an ETS plan from the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC), where China was part of the [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; From this experience with carbon markets, and lengthy discussions with the next largest carbon market, the [[European Union]] (EU), as well as analysis of small scale pilot markets in major Chinese cities and provinces, China’s national ETS will be the largest of its kind and will help China achieve its [[Intended Nationally Determined Contributions|Intended Nationally Determined Contribution]] (INDC) from the [[Paris Agreement]] in 2016.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swartz|first=Jeff|date=March 2016|title=China’s National Emissions Trading System|url=http://www.ieta.org/resources/China/Chinas_National_ETS_Implications_for_Carbon_Markets_and_Trade_ICTSD_March2016_Jeff_Swartz.pdf|journal=Global Economic Policy and Institutions|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plan specifics ==
China promised in the [[Conference of the parties|Conference of Parties]] to reduce their [[carbon intensity]] per unit of GDP by 60-65% by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.carbonbrief.org/climate-pledge-puts-china-on-course-to-peak-emissions-as-early-as-2027|title=Climate pledge puts China on course to peak emissions as early as 2027 {{!}} Carbon Brief|date=2015-07-01|work=Carbon Brief|access-date=2017-05-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; To achieve this, they decided to use market-based mechanisms. They developed the [[Clean Development Mechanism]], which consists in a “bottom up” architecture. China has learned from the [[European Union]], whose carbon trading market is currently twice as big, along with California in the United States, to implement mechanisms such as cap and trade. The idea is to create an international market through exchanges where allowances are traded and carbon emissions get monitored and reported.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

For now,{{When|date=December 2017}} the nation has implemented seven pilot carbon markets in various zones that thrive on [[Cement production|production of cement]], electricity, heat, [[Extraction of petroleum|petroleum and oil extraction]]. These zones are: Beijing, Chongqing, Guangdong, Hubei, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Tianjin, which represent 25% of China’s total GDP. These stationary activities are known for being the most pollutant and emitter of GHG. Since the pilot plan started, it is estimated that 40.24 millions of metric tons of carbon dioxide has been traded.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parenteau, Cao|first=Patrick, Mingde|date=March 2016|title=Carbon Trading in China: Progress and Challenges|url=http://www-assets.vermontlaw.edu/Assets/elc/Parenteau.March2016.pdf|journal=Environmental Law Reporter|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2017, the official launch of the plan will occur, inviting more Chinese cities and industries to collaborate on the cap and trade.

These pilot zones proved the [[Cap-and-trade|cap and trade]] efficiency. Cap refers to a permitted amount of emissions, if the industry exceed said limitation, it would require an allowance. Allowances can be traded, auctioned or even given away for free, depending on the case. Through cap and trade, it is believed that both competitiveness and possibility on carbon leakage would be reduced. Each cap and allowance was assigned to the cities according to their purpose, production rates, or ability to pass along the costs of carbon along the consumer chain. The caps of greenhouse gas emissions vary from 30-350 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year when the price for carbon varies from $1.4-$13.00 US dollars per ton of carbon dioxide. There also are 2 types of allowances: new entry vs. governmental. The new entry allowances are for those who are in need for growth and are freely distributed, whereas the governmental allowance is a fixed, stable fraction that must be sold or auctioned.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There are also conditions that each zone must uphold, mainly regarding monitoring, reporting and verification. Each zone has their own mechanism of doing so, but they all face the same kind of penalties if failing to do so. These penalties include: a reduction on free allowances, a threat on publicizing said status in order to create social pressure, a 2 year restricted access to special funds for energy research and if an excess of emission were to take place, the zone’s government or company would have to pay 3 times the original allowance price.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Difficulties ==
In order for China to achieve their aforementioned goals, they need to put front to certain challenges. China will have to overlook that there will no be any overlap with already existing policies from prevention, reduction and consumption of pollutants. The country will also have to strictly overlook and enforce the said regime, and make sure that there is ultimate transparency, especially on monitoring and reporting advances all the way throughout. There will also need to be special attention on carbon leakage and on price volatility. Ever since the pilot cities began this project, the price on carbon and caps have been fluctuating. The government will also need to make sure that there is an efficient trade and exchange of allowances in spot. In general, there will also need to be an existent plan on reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to achieve their [[Paris agreement]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On the other hand, policy makers face the struggle on allowance allocations. For the free allowance, they need to think about who to give them to. For the auctioned ones, they need to think about the type of auction that is most convenient, and the combined ones, all of the above.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chinacarbon.info/chinas-national-emission-trading-scheme-and-the-european-perspective-what-to-expect-from-2017/|title=China’s national emission trading scheme and the European perspective – what to expect from 2017? {{!}} China Carbon Forum {{!}} 中国碳论坛|website=www.chinacarbon.info|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences ==
Prior to the conception and design of China’s national carbon trading scheme, [[carbon emission trading]] (CET) had never been executed in China. With no CET experience to draw from, in late 2011 the [[National Development and Reform Commission]] (NDRC) approved two provinces and five cities of varying degrees of economic development as pilots. In the Notice on Launching Pilots for Emissions Trading System (ETS), the NDRC approved Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Chongqing, Hubei, Guangdong, and Shenzhen as ETS pilots. Shenzhen was the first pilot to launch, on June 18, 2013, and was soon followed by the other designated pilots, which all completed their first compliance period by June 2015. All of the pilots with compliance data had compliance rates of over 96%, with Shanghai having the highest compliance rate at 100% and Tianjin having the lowest compliance rate at 96.5%. In order to aid the design of implementation details in China’s national carbon trading scheme, each of the pilots were given the freedom to decide values for trading scheme parameters such as allowance allocation, coverage of sectors, and punishment mechanisms. They also vary in their approach to transactions, issues with price uncertainty, and managing risk. To assess the success of one pilot’s trading scheme versus another, market performance was considered.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Zhong Xiang|date=April 2015|title=Carbon Emissions Trading in China: The Evolution from Pilots to a Nationwide Scheme|url=https://ccep.crawford.anu.edu.au/sites/default/files/events/attachments/2015-04/paper_by_professor_zhang.pdf|journal=Australian National University|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pilots' approach to allowance allocation were largely based on historical emissions for most sectors except the power sector, which was calculated an allowance based on benchmarks and production. Guangdong was the only pilot to implement auctioning allowances for its power sector. Additionally, all pilots except Hubei allowed allowance rollover into the next compliance period. To standardize monitoring, reporting, and verification of carbon data, the NDRC issued regulations on monitoring and reporting guidelines. Enterprises were required to monitor and report their emissions, which was compared to a report from a third-party verification agency. Discrepancies in the reports above a threshold would require a re-verification. For most pilots, this threshold was set at a difference of 10% or 100 thousand tons. Funding required for verification was supplied by the local government rather than the enterprise, in order to reduce the compliance burden.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Five of the pilot programs allowed individuals to participate in carbon trading while two only allowed enterprises to do so. Transaction formats varied slightly but were all in spot markets with no carbon futures. In all pilots, enterprises needed to pay the cost of trading, which was a two-way charging scheme. In order to ensure stability in the carbon market, each pilot set a price limit based on the closing price of carbon in the previous compliance period, as well as limits on maximum allowance holdings for enterprises. Each pilot implemented varying degrees of fines for faking carbon data or withholding data. Shenzhen was the only pilot to implement a variable fine, setting it as three times the market clearing price times the excess emissions. Other pilot programs charged a flat fee. All pilots deducted the excess emissions from the next period’s allowance for the enterprise in question.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

From the pilot program’s inception to May 2015, 20.27 MtCO2e had been traded for a total value of 720 million CNY. The carbon price for Shenzhen and Guangdong were the greatest, ranging from 60 to 80 CNY. The price fluctuated more in Shenzhen and Tianjin when compared to other pilots, especially near the compliance period deadline and near the beginning of new periods. The transitive behavior of the carbon market is a result more so of trading entities' understanding of policy and the timing of carbon data acquisition rather than market demand. From the pilot program data, China should improve on the designs of the pilot programs in order to achieve a stable and stimulated national carbon market.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Economic analysis ==
The scheme set the initial carbon allowances to 3–5 billion tones per year. Comparing this to the EU-ETS scheme, it is almost twice as much as the EU allowance. By the time of July 2016, EU-ETS is the world's largest carbon trading system, with a carbon market of two billion tonnes per year. the [[National Development and Reform Commission]] (NDRC) announced that eight sectors would be included in this market, these eight sectors are petrochemicals, chemicals, building materials, steel, ferrous metals, paper-making, power-generation and aviation. The companies that participate in this market are compulsory to use more designated amount of energy. The current number is 10,000 tonnes of standard coal equivalent of energy per year. According to seven pilot cities (7 trial carbon market in China) average price, the launch price would be set to be around 5 dollars per ton, which would generate a revenue of $0.17 to $1.16 billion in the first trading year. The expected carbon trading volume would increase to 7–58 billion dollars per year after 2020 since more market would be introduced to the carbon trading system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.climateactionprogramme.org/news/china_to_open_first_national_carbon_market|title=China to open first national carbon market|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first auction for vintage 2016 allowances happened in Guangdong on September 21. This was held by the China Emission Exchange of Guangdong. The settle price of $1.48 per ton was set while the floor price is $1.40 for 500,000 tonnes. In the future, China’s carbon trading allowance would expect to be increase to 3–5 billion tonnes of CO2, which would bring a revenue of around 60–400 CNY.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://icapcarbonaction.com/en/news-archive/411-recent-developments-in-emissions-trading-in-china|title=Recent Developments in Emissions Trading in China|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cipetir''' (pre-[[Enhanced Indonesian Spelling System|EYD]] spelling and [[Dutch language|Dutch]]: '''Tjipetir''') is a [[village]] in [[Sukabumi Regency|Sukabumi]], [[West Java]], [[Indonesia]]. As of 2010, it has 5,716 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;Census 2010, Badan Pusat Statistik, [http://bps.go.id/eng/download_file/Population_of_Indonesia_by_Village_2010.pdf Population_of_Indonesia_by_Village]&lt;/ref&gt;

The name comes from [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]], and literally means "Thunder River", from ''ci'' ("river") and ''petir'' ("thunder").

Cipetir was the site of a [[gutta-percha]] plantation in the 19th and early 20th century.

[[Marine debris]] consisting of blocks of gutta-percha, which is highly resistant to water corrosion, with the word "TJIPETIR" on them has been found on beaches throughout Europe. They are believed to be coming from one or more sunken ships from the early 1900s. The wreck of the ''[[Miyazaki Maru]]'', sank in 1917, has been put forward as potential source of the blocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cacciottolo  |first=Mario |date=1 December 2014 |title=Tjipetir mystery: Why are rubber-like blocks washing up on European beaches? |publisher=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-30043875 |accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=David |first=Romain |date=2014-04-03 |title=Le mystère des "plaques de Tjipetir" ravive le fantôme du "Titanic" |publisher=Le Figaro |url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2014/04/01/01016-20140401ARTFIG00277-le-mystere-des-plaques-de-tjipetir-ravive-le-fantome-du-titanic.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clipstone Colliery''' was a [[coal mine]] situated near the village of the same name on the edge of an area of [[Nottinghamshire]] known as “[[The Dukeries]]” because of the number of stately homes in the area. The colliery was owned by the [[Bolsover Colliery Company]] and passed to the [[National Coal Board]] in 1947. The headstocks and powerhouse are grade II [[listed buildings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE|num=1380235|desc=Headstocks and Powerhouse at the site of the former Clipstone Colliery|access-date=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The colliery was sunk to exploit the [[Barnsley]] seam or “Tophard”, as it is known locally. In the 1950s the shafts were deepened to over 1000 yards (920 m) to exploit other seams.

The colliery was closed by [[British Coal]], as the National Coal Board had become, in 1993 and reopened by [[RJB Mining]] (now UK Coal) in April 1994, the licence to dig for coal being limited to the Yard seam which is located at a depth of 957 yards (870 m). The colliery was finally closed in April 2003.

[[File:Flintenbreite constructed wetland.jpg|thumb|Constructed wetland in an ecological settlement in Flintenbreite near Lübeck, Germany]]

A '''constructed wetland''' ('''CW''') is an artificial [[wetland]] to treat municipal or industrial [[wastewater]], [[greywater]] or [[stormwater]] runoff. It may also be designed for land reclamation after [[mining]], or as a [[Flood mitigation|mitigation]] step for natural areas lost to [[land development]].

Constructed wetlands are engineered systems that use natural functions [[vegetation]], [[soil]], and organisms to treat wastewater. Depending on the type of wastewater the design of the constructed wetland has to be adjusted accordingly. Constructed wetlands have been used to treat both centralized and on-site wastewater. Primary treatment is recommended when there is a large amount of suspended solids or soluble organic matter (measured as [[Biochemical oxygen demand|BOD]] and [[Chemical oxygen demand|COD]]).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Similarly to natural wetlands, constructed wetlands also act as a [[biofilter]] and/or can remove a range of [[pollutant]]s (such as organic matter, [[Nutrient pollution|nutrients]], [[pathogen]]s, [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]]) from the water. Constructed wetlands are a [[sanitation]] technology that have not been designed specifically for [[pathogen]] removal, but instead, have been designed to remove other water quality constituents such as suspended solids, organic matter and nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; All types of pathogens (i.e., bacteria, viruses, protozoan and helminths) are expected to be removed to some extent in a constructed wetland. Subsurface wetland provide greater pathogen removal than surface wetlands.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

There are two main types of constructed wetlands: subsurface flow and surface flow constructed wetlands. The planted vegetation plays an important role in contaminant removal. The filter bed, consisting usually of [[sand]] and [[gravel]], has an equally important role to play.&lt;ref name="hoffmann" /&gt; Some constructed wetlands may also serve as a [[habitat]] for native and migratory [[wildlife]], although that is not their main purpose. Subsurface flow constructed wetlands are designed to have either horizontal flow or vertical flow of water through the gravel and sand bed. Vertical flow systems have a smaller space requirement than horizontal flow systems.

== Terminology ==

Many terms are used to denote constructed wetlands, such as [[reed bed]]s, soil infiltration beds, treatment wetlands, engineered wetlands, man-made or artificial wetlands.&lt;ref name="hoffmann"&gt;Hoffmann, H., Platzer, C., von Münch, E., Winker, M. (2011): [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/930 Technology review of constructed wetlands – Subsurface flow constructed wetlands for greywater and domestic wastewater treatment]. Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, Eschborn, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; A [[biofilter]] has some similarities with a constructed wetland, but is usually without plants.

The term of constructed wetlands can also be used to describe restored and recultivated land that was destroyed in the past through draining and converting into farmland, or mining.

== Overview ==
[[File:Hamburg-Allermöhe, effluent from constructed wetland (3252520051).jpg|thumb|Effluent from a constructed wetland for [[greywater]] treatment at an ecological housing estate in Hamburg-Allermoehe, Germany]]
[[File:Constructed wetland Bayawan City (4113800865).jpg|thumb|Constructed wetland for domestic wastewater treatment in Bayawan City, the Philippines]]
A constructed wetland is an engineered sequence of water bodies designed to filter and treat [[water pollution|waterborne pollutants]] found in [[sewage]], industrial effluent or [[stormwater|storm water runoff]]. Constructed wetlands are used for [[wastewater treatment]] or for [[greywater]] treatment.&lt;ref name="Dotro"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.iwapublishing.com/open-access-ebooks/3567|title=Volume 7. Biological Wastewater Treatment Series|last1=Dotro|first1=G.|last2=Langergraber|first2=G.|last3=Molle|first3=P.|last4=Nivala|first4=J.|last5= Puigagut Juárez|first5=J.|last6=Stein|first6=O. R.|last7=von Sperling|first7=M.|publisher=IWA Publishing|year=2017|isbn=9781780408767|location=London|pages=|chapter=Treatment wetlands|oclc=984563578}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can be used after a [[septic tank]] for primary treatment (or other types of systems) in order to separate the solids from the liquid effluent. Some constructed wetland designs however do not use upfront primary treatment.

Vegetation in a wetland provides a substrate (roots, stems, and leaves) upon which [[microorganism]]s can grow as they break down organic materials. This community of microorganisms is known as the [[periphyton]]. The periphyton and natural chemical processes are responsible for approximately 90 percent of [[pollutant]] removal and waste breakdown.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} The plants remove about seven to ten percent of pollutants, and act as a [[carbon]] source for the microbes when they decay. Different species of [[aquatic plant]]s have different rates of heavy metal uptake, a consideration for plant selection in a constructed wetland used for water treatment. Constructed wetlands are of two basic types: subsurface flow and surface flow wetlands.

Constructed wetlands are one example of [[nature-based solutions]] and of [[phytoremediation]].

Many regulatory agencies list treatment wetlands as one of their recommended "[[best management practice for water pollution|best management practices]]" for controlling [[urban runoff]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, see Urban Drainage and Flood Control District, Denver, CO. "Treatment BMP Fact Sheets:"

==Removal of contaminants==

Physical, chemical, and biological processes combine in wetlands to remove contaminants from wastewater. An understanding of these processes is fundamental not only to designing wetland systems but to understanding the fate of chemicals once they enter the wetland. Theoretically, [[wastewater treatment]] within a constructed wetland occurs as it passes through the wetland medium and the plant [[Rhizosphere (ecology)|rhizosphere]]. A thin film around each root hair is [[Oxygen|aerobic]] due to the leakage of oxygen from the [[rhizome]]s, [[root]]s, and rootlets.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Aerobic organism|Aerobic]] and [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] micro-organisms facilitate decomposition of organic matter. Microbial [[nitrification]] and subsequent [[denitrification]] releases [[nitrogen]] as gas to the [[atmosphere]]. [[Phosphorus]] is [[Coprecipitation|coprecipitated]] with [[iron]], [[aluminium]], and [[calcium]] compounds located in the root-bed medium.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Brix, H., Schierup, H. (1989): Danish experience with sewage treatment in constructed wetlands. In: Hammer, D.A., ed. (1989): Constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment. Lewis publishers, Chelsea, Michigan, pp. 565–573&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davies, T.H., Hart, B.T. (1990): [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080407845500127 Use of aeration to promote nitrification in reed beds treating wastewater]. Advanced Water Pollution Control 11: 77–84. doi:10.1016/b978-0-08-040784-5.50012-7. {{ISBN|9780080407845}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Suspended solids]] filter out as they settle in the water column in surface flow wetlands or are physically filtered out by the medium within subsurface flow wetlands. Harmful [[bacteria]] and [[virus]]es are reduced by filtration and adsorption by [[biofilm]]s on the gravel or sand media in subsurface flow and vertical flow systems.

===Nitrogen removal===
The dominant forms of nitrogen in wetlands that are of importance to [[wastewater]] treatment include [[organic nitrogen]], [[ammonia]], [[ammonium]], [[nitrate]] and [[nitrite]]. Total nitrogen refers to all nitrogen species. Wastewater nitrogen removal is important because of ammonia’s toxicity to fish if discharged into watercourses. Excessive nitrates in drinking water is thought to cause [[methemoglobinemia]] in infants, which decreases the blood's oxygen transport ability. Moreover, excess input of N from point and non-point sources to surface water promotes eutrophication in rivers, lakes, estuaries, and coastal oceans which causes several problems in aquatic ecosystems e.g. toxic algal blooms, oxygen depletion in water, fish mortality, loss of aquatic biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, S.R., Caraco, N.F., Correll, D.L., Howarth, R.W., Sharpley, A.N. &amp; Smith, V.H. (1998)[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/1051-0761(1998)008%5B0559:NPOSWW%5D2.0.CO;2/abstract  Nonpoint pollution of surface waters with phosphorus and nitrogen].Ecological Applications, 8, 559–568.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ammonia removal occurs in constructed wetlands – if they are designed to achieve biological nutrient removal – in a similar ways as in [[sewage treatment]] plants, except that no external, energy-intensive addition of air (oxygen) is needed.&lt;ref name="Dotro" /&gt; It is a two-step process, consisting of [[nitrification]] followed by [[denitrification]]. The [[nitrogen cycle]] is completed as follows: ammonia in the wastewater is converted to ammonium ions; the aerobic bacterium ''[[Nitrosomonas]]'' sp. oxidizes ammonium to nitrite; the bacterium ''[[Nitrobacter]]'' sp. then converts nitrite to nitrate. Under anaerobic conditions, nitrate is reduced to relatively harmless nitrogen gas that enters the atmosphere.

==== Nitrification ====
{{Further|Nitrification}}
Nitrification is the biological conversion of organic and inorganic nitrogenous compounds from a reduced state to a more oxidized state, based on the action of two different bacteria types.&lt;ref name="Wetzel-1983"&gt;Wetzel, R.G. (1983): Limnology. Orlando, Florida: Saunders college publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Nitrification is strictly an aerobic process in which the end product is nitrate ({{chem|NO|3|-}}). The process of nitrification oxidizes ammonium (from the wastewater) to nitrite ({{chem|NO|2|-}}), and then nitrite is oxidized to nitrate ({{chem|NO|3|-}}).

==== Denitrification ====
{{Further|Denitrification}}
Denitrification is the biochemical reduction of oxidized nitrogen anions, nitrate and nitrite to produce the gaseous products nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide ({{chem|N|2|O}}) and nitrogen gas ({{chem|N|2}}), with concomitant oxidation of organic matter.&lt;ref name="Wetzel-1983" /&gt; The end product, {{chem|N|2}}, and to a lesser extent the intermediary by product, {{chem|N|2|O}}, are gases that re-enter the atmosphere.

====Ammonia removal from mine water====
Constructed wetlands have been used to remove ammonia and other nitrogenous compounds from contaminated [[mine water]],&lt;ref&gt;Hallin, S., Hellman, M., Choudhury, M.I. &amp; Ecke, F. (2015) [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043135415302116 Relative importance of plant uptake and plant associated denitrification for removal of nitrogen from mine drainage in sub-arctic wetlands]. Water Research, 85, 377–383.
&lt;/ref&gt; including cyanide and nitrate.

===Phosphorus removal===
[[Phosphorus]] occurs naturally in both organic and inorganic forms. The analytical measure of biologically available [[Phosphate|orthophosphates]] is referred to as soluble reactive phosphorus (SR-P). Dissolved organic phosphorus and insoluble forms of organic and inorganic phosphorus are generally not biologically available until transformed into soluble inorganic forms.&lt;ref name="Mitsch-Gosselink-1986"&gt;Mitsch, J.W., Gosselink, J.G. (1986): Wetlands. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold Company, p. 536&lt;/ref&gt;

In freshwater [[aquatic ecosystem]]s phosphorus is typically the major limiting nutrient. Under undisturbed natural conditions, phosphorus is in short supply. The natural scarcity of phosphorus is demonstrated by the explosive growth of [[algae]] in water receiving heavy discharges of phosphorus-rich wastes. Because phosphorus does not have an atmospheric component, unlike nitrogen, the [[phosphorus cycle]] can be characterized as closed. The removal and storage of phosphorus from wastewater can only occur within the constructed wetland itself. Phosphorus may be sequestered within a wetland system by:
# The binding of phosphorus in organic matter as a result of incorporation into living biomass,
# [[Precipitation (chemistry)|Precipitation]] of insoluble phosphates with [[ferric]] iron, [[calcium]], and [[aluminium]] found in wetland soils.&lt;ref name="Mitsch-Gosselink-1986" /&gt;

====Biomass plants incorporation====
Aquatic vegetation may play an important role in phosphorus removal and, if harvested, extend the life of a system by postponing phosphorus saturation of the sediments.&lt;ref name="gunten89"&gt;Guntensbergen, G.R., Stearns, F., Kadlec, J.A. (1989): Wetland vegetation. In Hammer, D.A., ed. (1989): Constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment. Lewis publishers, Chelsea, Michigan, pp. 73–88&lt;/ref&gt; Plants create a unique environment at the biofilm's attachment surface. Certain plants transport oxygen which is released at the biofilm/root interface, adding oxygen to the wetland system. Plants also increase soil or other root-bed medium hydraulic conductivity. As roots and rhizomes grow they are thought to disturb and loosen the medium, increasing its porosity, which may allow more effective fluid movement in the rhizosphere. When roots decay they leave behind ports and channels known as macropores which are effective in channeling water through the soil.

===Metals removal===
Constructed wetlands have been used extensively for the removal of dissolved metals and [[metalloids]]. Although these contaminants are prevalent in mine drainage, they are also found in [[stormwater]], [[Leachate|landfill leachate]] and other sources (e.g., leachate or FDG washwater{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} at [[Fossil fuel power plant|coal-fired power plants]]), for which treatment wetlands have been constructed for mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://technology.infomine.com/enviromine/wetlands/Welcome.htm |title=Wetlands for Treatment of Mine Drainage |publisher=Technology.infomine.com |accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mine water—Acid drainage removal====
Constructed wetlands can also be used for treatment of [[acid mine drainage]] from coal mines.&lt;ref&gt;Hedin, R.S., Nairn, R.W.; Kleinmann, R.L.P. (1994): Passive treatment of coal mine drainage. Information Circular (Pittsburgh, PA.: U.S. Bureau of Mines) (9389).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pathogen removal ===
Constructed wetlands are a sanitation technology that have not typically been designed for pathogen removal, but instead, have been designed to remove other water quality constituents such as suspended solids, organic matter (BOD/COD) and nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

All types of pathogens are expected to be removed in a constructed wetland; however, greater pathogen removal is expected to occur in a subsurface wetland. In a free water surface flow wetland one can expect 1 to 2 [[Common logarithm|log10]] reduction of pathogens; however, bacteria and virus removal may be less than 1 log10 reduction in systems that are heavily planted with vegetation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This is because constructed wetlands typically include vegetation which assists in removing other pollutants such as nitrogen and phosphorus. Therefore, the importance of sunlight exposure in removing viruses and bacteria is minimized in these systems.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Removal in a properly designed and operated free water surface flow wetland is reported to be less than 1 to 2 log10 for bacteria, less than 1 to 2 log10 for viruses, 1 to 2 log10 for protozoa:, and 1 to 2 log10 for helminths.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In subsurface flow wetlands, the expected removal of pathogens is reported to be 1 to 3 log10 for bacteria, 1 to 2 log10 for viruses, 2 log10 for protozoa, and 2 log10 for helminths.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The log10 removal efficiencies reported here can also be understood in terms of the common way of reporting removal efficiencies as percentages: 1 log10 removal is equivalent to a removal efficiency of 90%; 2 log10 = 99%; 3 log10 = 99.9%; 4 log10 = 99.99% and so on.&lt;ref name="Dotro" /&gt;

==Types and design considerations==
The main three broad types of constructed wetlands include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stefanakis|first1=Alexandros|last2=Akratos|first2=Christos|last3=Tsihrintzis|first3=Vassilios|title=Vertical Flow Constructed Wetlands: Eco-engineering Systems for Wastewater and Sludge Treatment|date=5 August 2014|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=978-0-12-404612-2|pages=392|edition=1st|url=https://www.elsevier.com/books/vertical-flow-constructed-wetlands/stefanakis/978-0-12-404612-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dotro" /&gt;
* Subsurface flow constructed wetland - this wetland can be either with vertical flow (the effluent moves vertically, from the planted layer down through the substrate and out) or with horizontal flow (the effluent moves horizontally, parallel to the surface)
* Surface flow constructed wetland (this wetland has horizontal flow)
* Floating treatment wetland

The former types are placed in a basin with a substrate to provide a surface area upon which large amounts of waste degrading biofilms form, while the latter relies on a flooded treatment basin upon which aquatic plants are held in flotation till they develop a thick mat of roots and rhizomes upon which biofilms form. In most cases, the bottom is lined with either a polymer [[geomembrane]], concrete or clay (when there is appropriate clay type) in order to protect the water table and surrounding grounds. The substrate can be either [[gravel]]—generally limestone or pumice/volcanic rock, depending on local availability, [[sand]] or a mixture of various sizes of media (for vertical flow constructed wetlands).

===Subsurface flow ===
[[File:Tilley et al 2014 Schematic of the Vertical Flow Constructed Wetland.jpg|thumb|Schematic of a vertical subsurface flow constructed wetland: Effluent flows through pipes on the subsurface of the ground through the root zone to the ground.&lt;ref name="eawag.ch"&gt;Tilley, E., Ulrich, L., Lüthi, C., Reymond, Ph., Zurbrügg, C. (2014): [http://www.eawag.ch/forschung/sandec/publikationen/compendium_e/index_EN Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies – (2nd Revised Edition)]. Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag), Duebendorf, Switzerland. {{ISBN|978-3-906484-57-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Tilley et al 2014 Schematic of the Horizontal Subsurface Flow Constructed Wetland.jpg|thumb|Schematic of the Horizontal Subsurface Flow Constructed Wetland: Effluent flows horizontally through the bed.&lt;ref name="eawag.ch" /&gt;]]
[[File:Final tags.jpg|thumb|right|Vertical flow type of constructed wetlands (subsurface flow)]]

In subsurface flow constructed wetlands the flow of wastewater occurs between the roots of the plants and there is no water surfacing (it is kept below gravel). As a result, the system is more efficient, does not attract mosquitoes, is less odorous and less sensitive to winter conditions. Also, less area is needed to purify water. A downside to the system are the intakes, which can clog or [[bioclogging|bioclog]] easily, although some larger sized gravel will often solve this problem.

Subsurface flow wetlands can be further classified as horizontal flow or vertical flow constructed wetlands. In the vertical flow constructed wetland, the effluent moves vertically from the planted layer down through the substrate and out (requiring air pumps to aerate the bed).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stefanakis|first1=Alexandros|last2=Akratos|first2=Christos|last3=Tsihrintzis|first3=Vassilios|title=Vertical Flow Constructed Wetlands: Eco-engineering Systems for Wastewater and Sludge Treatment|date=5 August 2014|publisher=Elsevier Science|location=Amsterdam|isbn=9780124046122|pages=392|edition=1st|url=https://www.elsevier.com/books/vertical-flow-constructed-wetlands/stefanakis/978-0-12-404612-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the horizontal flow constructed wetland the effluent moves horizontally via gravity, parallel to the surface, with no surface water thus avoiding mosquito breeding. Vertical flow constructed wetlands are considered to be more efficient with less area required compared to horizontal flow constructed wetlands. However, they need to be interval-loaded and their design requires more know-how while horizontal flow constructed wetlands can receive wastewater continuously and are easier to build.&lt;ref name="hoffmann" /&gt;

Due to the increased efficiency a vertical flow subsurface constructed wetland requires only about {{convert|3|m2|sqft}} of space per [[Population equivalent|person equivalent]], down to 1.5 square metres in hot climates.&lt;ref name="hoffmann" /&gt;

The "French System" combines primary and secondary treatment of raw wastewater. The effluent passes various filter beds whose grain size is getting progressively smaller (from gravel to sand).&lt;ref name="hoffmann" /&gt;

==== Applications ====
Subsurface flow wetlands can treat a variety of different wastewaters, such as household wastewater, agricultural, paper mill wastewater, mining [[runoff (water)|runoff]], [[Tanning (leather)|tannery]] or [[meat]] processing wastes, [[storm water]].&lt;ref name="Dotro" /&gt;

The quality of the effluent is determined by the design and should be customized for the intended reuse application (like irrigation or toilet flushing) or the disposal method.

==== Design considerations ====
Depending on the type of constructed wetlands, the wastewater passes through a gravel and more rarely [[sand]] medium on which plants are rooted.&lt;ref name="Dotro" /&gt; A [[gravel]] medium (generally limestone or volcanic rock [[Lava filter|lavastone]]) can be used as well (the use of lavastone will allow for a surface reduction of about 20% over limestone) is mainly deployed in horizontal flow systems though it does not work as efficiently as sand (but sand will clog more readily).&lt;ref name="hoffmann" /&gt;

Constructed subsurface flow wetlands are meant as [[secondary treatment]] systems which means that the effluent needs to first pass a primary treatment which effectively removes solids. Such a primary treatment can consist of sand and grit removal, grease trap, [[compost]] filter, [[septic tank]], [[Imhoff tank]], anaerobic baffled reactor or u[[Upflow  anaerobic sludge blanket|pflow anaerobic sludge  blanket]]  (UASB) reactor.&lt;ref name="hoffmann" /&gt; The following treatment is based on different biological and physical processes like filtration, adsorption or nitrification. Most important is the biological filtration through a biofilm of [[Aerobic bacteria|aerobic]] or [[facultative bacteria]]. Coarse sand in the filter bed provides a surfaces for microbial growth and supports the adsorption and filtration processes. For those microorganisms the oxygen supply needs to be sufficient.

Especially in warm and dry climates the effects of evapotranspiration and precipitation are significant. In cases of water loss, a vertical flow constructed wetland is preferable to a horizontal because of an unsaturated upper layer and a shorter retention time, although vertical flow systems are more dependent on an external energy source. Evapotranspiration (as is rainfall) is taken into account in designing a horizontal flow system.&lt;ref name="Dotro" /&gt;

The effluent can have a yellowish or brownish colour if [[sewage|domestic wastewater]] or [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] is treated. Treated [[greywater]] usually does not tend to have a colour. Concerning pathogen levels, treated greywater meets the standards of pathogen levels for safe discharge to surface water.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Maiga, Y., von Sperling, M., Mihelcic, J. 2017.

Plantings of [[reedbed]]s are popular in European constructed subsurface flow wetlands, although at least twenty other plant species are usable. Many fast growing timer plants can be used, as well for example as Musa spp., Juncus spp., cattails (''[[Typha]]'' spp.) and [[Cyperaceae|sedges]].

==== Operation and maintenance ====
Overloading peaks should not cause performance problems while continuous overloading lead to a loss of treatment capacity through too much suspended solids, sludge or fats.

Subsurface flow wetlands require the following maintenance tasks: regular checking of the pretreatment process, of pumps when they are used, of influent loads and distribution on the filter bed.&lt;ref name="hoffmann" /&gt;

==== Comparisons with other types ====
Subsurface wetlands are less hospitable to [[mosquito]]es compared to surface flow wetlands, as there is no water exposed to the surface. Mosquitos can be a problem in surface flow constructed wetlands. Subsurface flow systems have the advantage of requiring less land area for water treatment than surface flow. However, surface flow wetlands can be more suitable for wildlife habitat.

For urban applications the area requirement of a subsurface flow constructed wetland might be a limiting factor compared to conventional municipal [[wastewater treatment plants]]. High rate aerobic treatment processes like [[activated sludge]] plants, trickling filters, rotating discs, submerged aerated filters or [[membrane bioreactor]] plants require less space. The advantage of subsurface flow constructed wetlands compared to those technologies is their operational robustness which is particularly important in developing countries. The fact that constructed wetlands do not produce secondary sludge ([[sewage sludge]]) is another advantage as there is no need for [[sewage sludge treatment]].&lt;ref name="hoffmann" /&gt; However, primary sludge from primary settling tanks does get produced and needs to be removed and treated.

==== Costs ====
The costs of subsurface flow constructed wetlands mainly depend on the costs of sand with which the bed has to be filled.&lt;ref name="Dotro" /&gt; Another factor is the cost of land.

===Surface flow ===
[[File:Schematic of the Free Water Surface Constructed Wetland.jpg|thumb|Schematic of a free-water surface constructed wetland: It aims to replicate the naturally occurring processes, where particles settle, pathogens are destroyed, and organisms and plants utilize the nutrients.]]
Surface flow wetlands, also known as free water surface constructed wetlands, can be used for tertiary treatment or polishing of effluent from [[wastewater treatment]] plants. They are also suitable to treat stormwater drainage.

Surface flow constructed wetlands always have horizontal flow of wastewater across the roots of the plants, rather than vertical flow. They require a relatively large area to purify water compared to subsurface flow constructed wetlands and may have increased smell and lower performance in winter.

Surface flow wetlands have a similar appearance to ponds for wastewater treatment (such as "[[waste stabilization pond]]s") but are in the technical literature not classified as ponds.&lt;ref name="tilley"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.eawag.ch/en/department/sandec/publications/compendium/|title=Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies|last2=Ulrich|first2=Lukas|last3=Lüthi|first3=Christoph|last4=Reymond|first4=Philippe|last5=Zurbrügg|first5=Chris|publisher=Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag)|isbn=978-3-906484-57-0|edition=2nd|location=Duebendorf, Switzerland|last1=Tilley|first1=Elizabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pathogens are destroyed by natural decay, predation from higher organisms, sedimentation and UV irradiation since the water is exposed to direct sunlight.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The soil layer below the water is anaerobic but the roots of the plants release oxygen around them, this allows complex biological and chemical reactions.

Surface flow wetlands can be supported by a wide variety of soil types including [[bay mud]] and other [[silt]]y [[clay]]s.

Plants such as  Water Hyacinth (''[[Eichhornia crassipes]]'') and ''[[Pontederia]]'' spp. are used worldwide (although Typha and Phragmites are highly invasive).

However, surface flow constructed wetlands may encourage mosquito breeding. They may also have high algae production that lowers the effluent quality and due to open water surface mosquitos and odours, it is more difficult to integrate them in an urban neighbourhood.

===Hybrid systems===
A combination of different types of constructed wetlands is possible to use the specific advantages of each system.&lt;ref name="hoffmann" /&gt;

[[File:Newly planted constructed wetland.jpg|thumb|Newly planted constructed wetland]]
[[File:Mature Constructed Wetland.jpg|thumb|Same constructed wetland, two years later]]

===Others===
====Integrated constructed wetland====
An integrated constructed wetland (ICW) is an unlined free surface flow constructed wetland with emergent vegetated areas and local soil material. Its objectives is not only to treat wastewater from farmyards and other wastewater sources, but also to integrate the wetland infrastructure into the landscape and enhancing its [[Biodiversity|biological diversity]].&lt;ref name=Scholz07b&gt;Scholz M., Sadowski A. J., Harrington R. and Carroll P. (2007b), Integrated Constructed Wetlands Assessment and Design for Phosphate Removal. ''Biosystems Engineering'', 97 (3), 415–423.&lt;/ref&gt;

Integrated constructed wetland facilitates may be more robust treatment systems compared to other constructed wetlands.&lt;ref name=Mustafa09&gt;Mustafa A., Scholz M., Harrington R. and Carrol P. (2009) Long-term Performance of a Representative Integrated Constructed Wetland Treating Farmyard Runoff. ''Ecological Engineering'', 35 (5), 779–790.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Scholz07a&gt;Scholz M., Harrington R., Carroll P. and Mustafa A. (2007a), The Integrated Constructed Wetlands (ICW) Concept. ''Wetlands'', 27 (2), 337–354.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Scholz07b/&gt; This is  due to the greater biological complexity and generally relatively larger land area use and associated longer hydraulic [[Residence time (fluid dynamics)|residence time]] of integrated constructed wetland compared to conventional constructed wetlands.&lt;ref name=Carty08&gt;Carty A., Scholz M., Heal K., Gouriveau F. and Mustafa A. (2008), The Universal Design, Operation and Maintenance Guidelines for Farm Constructed Wetlands (FCW) in [[Temperate|Temperate Climates]]. ''Bioresource Technology'', 99 (15), 6780–6792.&lt;/ref&gt;

Integreated constructed wetlands are used in [[Ireland]], the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and the [[United States]] since about 2007. Farm constructed wetlands, which are a subtype of integrated constructed wetlands, are promoted by the [[Scottish Environment Protection Agency]] and the [[Northern Ireland]] [[Environment Agency]] since 2008.&lt;ref name=Carty08/&gt;

===Plants===

[[File:Newly planted constructed wetland - details (3110372910).jpg|thumb|Newly planted constructed wetland for [[blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] treatment (Lima, Peru)]]
[[File:Constructed wetland (5547294390).jpg|thumb|The large roots of this uprooted plant growing in a constructed wetlands indicate a healthy plant (Lima, Peru)]]
Typhas and Phragmites are the main species used in constructed wetland due to their effectiveness, even though they can be [[Invasive species|invasive]] outside their native range.

In North America, cattails (''[[Typha latifolia]]'') are common in constructed wetlands because of their widespread abundance, ability to grow at different water depths, ease of transport and transplantation, and broad tolerance of water composition (including pH, salinity, dissolved oxygen and contaminant concentrations). Elsewhere, Common Reed (''[[Phragmites australis]]'') are common (both in blackwater treatment but also in [[greywater treatment]] systems to purify wastewater).

Plants are usually [[Indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] in that location for [[Ecology|ecological]] reasons and optimum workings.

===Animals===

[[File:Flowform.jpg|thumb|right|A hybrid system using Flowforms in a treatment pond, in [[Norway]].]]
Locally grown non-[[predator]]y [[fish]] can be added to surface flow constructed wetlands to eliminate or reduce [[pest (organism)|pest]]s, such as [[mosquito]]s. 

[[Stormwater]] wetlands provide habitat for amphibians but the pollutants they accumulate can affect the survival of larval stages, potentially making them function as "ecological traps".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sievers |first1=Michael |last2=Parris |first2=Kirsten M. |last3=Swearer |first3=Stephen E. |last4=Hale |first4=Robin |title=Stormwater wetlands can function as ecological traps for urban frogs |journal=Ecological Applications |date=June 2018 |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=1106–1115 |doi=10.1002/eap.1714}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Costs ==
Since constructed wetlands are self-sustaining their lifetime costs are significantly lower than those of conventional treatment systems. Often their capital costs are also lower compared to conventional treatment systems.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite report |date=December 2003 |title=Technical and Regulatory Guidance Document for Constructed Treatment Wetlands |url=http://www.itrcweb.org/GuidanceDocuments/WTLND-1.pdf |publisher=Interstate Technology &amp; Regulatory Council |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; They do take up significant space, and are therefore not preferred where real estate costs are high.

== History ==
Subsurface flow constructed wetlands with sand filter bed have their origin in Europe and are now used all over the world. Subsurface flow constructed wetlands with a gravel bed are mainly found in North Africa, South Africa, Asia, Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref name="hoffmann" /&gt;

== Examples ==

=== Austria ===
The total number of constructed wetlands in [[Austria]] is 5,450 (in 2015).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Langergraber|first=Guenter|last2=Weissenbacher|first2=Norbert|date=2017-05-25|title=Survey on number and size distribution of treatment wetlands in Austria|url=http://wst.iwaponline.com/content/75/10/2309|journal=Water Science and Technology|language=en|volume=75|issue=10|pages=2309–2315|doi=10.2166/wst.2017.112|issn=0273-1223}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to legal requirements (nitrification), only vertical flow constructed wetlands are implemented in Austria as they achieve better [[nitrification]] performance than horizontal flow constructed wetlands. Only about 100 of these constructed wetlands have a design size of 50 [[population equivalent]]s or more. The remaining 5,350 treatment plants are smaller than that.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== United States of America ===
The [[Arcata Marsh]] in Arcata, California is a sewage treatment and wildlife protection marsh.

=== Australia ===
The [[Urrbrae Wetland]] in Australia was constructed for urban flood control and environmental education.

At the Ranger Uranium Mine, in Australia, ammonia is removed in "enhanced" natural wetlands (rather than fully engineered constructed wetlands), along with manganese, uranium and other metals.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4876">'''Czech Crater''' or Bohemian Crater is a working hypothesis that considers the [[Bohemian Massif]] as an approximately 2 billion year old [[impact crater]]. This is contrary to mainstream geological ideas that describe the Massif as the result of continental collision. Individual independent units collided more than 300 million years ago thanks to their drifting. This is explained by a widely accepted theory of [[plate tectonics]].

== Evolution of the Hypothesis ==
A first comparison of the craters on the [[Moon]] and the Czech circular structure was made by [[Galileo Galilei]] in 1610.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sidereus Nuncius|last=Galilei|first=Galileo|publisher=|year=1610|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boston University]] astronomers [[Farouk El-Baz]] and [[Michael D. Papagiannis]] informed about the structure in 1980's as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1989LPICo.712..189P|title=1989LPICo.712..189P Page 189|website=adsabs.harvard.edu|access-date=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; So did also [[Petr Rajlich]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rajlich|first=Petr|year=1992|title=Bohemian circular structure, Czechoslovakia: Search for the impact evidence|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19930000984|journal=Lunar and Planetary Inst., International Conference on Large Meteorite Impacts and Planetary Evolution|volume=|pages=57–59|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He informed about the discovery of an impact [[breccia]]. Rajlich, Benes and Cobbold also proposed a tectonic experiment related to the hypothesis in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267381280_Wrenching_of_a_Continental_Lithosphere_Containing_a_Circular_Resistant_Inclusion_Physical_Model_Experiments|title=Wrenching of a Continental Lithosphere Containing a Circular Resistant Inclusion: Physical Model Experiments (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; They demonstrated the origin of roughly circular ridges around the Bohemian Massif as a result of simple lithospheric wrenching.

There exist many results of [[radiometric dating]] from the Bohemian Massif like [[zircon]], [[muscovite]] or [[Monazite geochronology|monazite]] ages. The age is often around 340 million years (a presumed [[variscan orogeny]]). The rocks could only be affected by a late variscan hydrothermal event and the ages of zircons or monazites do not indicate the real ages of them according to some papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306828184_Younger_postectonic_monazite_in_the_Pisek_pegmatite|title=Younger postectonic monazite in the Písek pegmatite (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was found a large conical depression in the [[Mohorovičić discontinuity|Moho discontinuity]] 2-D model just beneath the probable center of the crater according to seismic data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hrubcová|first=P.|last2=Środa|first2=P.|last3=Špičák|first3=A.|last4=Guterch|first4=A.|last5=Grad|first5=M.|last6=Keller|first6=G.

== Rajlich's Hypothesis ==
Macroscopic white lamellae exist inside [[quartz]] and other minerals in the [[Bohemian Massif]] and even at another places in whole of the world like wavefronts generated by a [[Impact event|meteorite impact]] according to the [[Rajlich's Hypothesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/276814811|title=Český kráter|last=1944-|first=Rajlich, Petr,|date=2007-01-01|publisher=Jihočeské muzeum|isbn=9788086260808|oclc=276814811}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/883371161|title=Vesmírná příhoda v Českém křemeni (a v Českém masivu)|last=1944-.|first=Rajlich, Petr,|date=2014-01-01|publisher=Geologie|isbn=9788026056782|oclc=883371161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mestan|first=J.|last2=Alvarez Polanco|first2=E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8801">In the oil and gas industry, '''depth in a well''' is the measurement, for any point in that well, of the distance between a reference point or elevation, and that point.  It is the most common method of reference for locations in the well, and therefore, in [[oil industry]] speech, "depth" also refers to the location itself.

By extension, depth can refer to locations below, or distances from, a reference point or elevation, even when there is no well.  In that sense, depth is a concept related to [[elevation]], albeit in the opposite direction.  Depth in a well is not necessarily measured vertically or along a straight line.

Because wells are not always drilled vertically, there may be two "depths" for every given point in a wellbore:  the '''[[measured depth]] (MD)''' measured along the path of the [[borehole]], and the '''[[true vertical depth]] (TVD)''', the absolute vertical distance between the [[Datum (geodesy)|datum]] and the point in the [[wellbore]].  In perfectly vertical wells, the TVD equals the MD; otherwise, the TVD is less than the MD measured from the same datum. Common datums used are ground level (GL), [[drilling rig]] floor ([[Drill floor|DF]]), [[rotary table]] (RT), [[kelly bushing]] (KB) and [[mean sea level]] (MSL).

==The specification of depth==
Although it is an intuitive concept, depth in a well is the source of much confusion because it is frequently not specified correctly.  Absolute depth should always be specified with three components:  
* a unit (e.g. m for metre),  
* a path (e.g. MD for measured depth)  
* and the reference or datum they refer to (e.g. RT for [[Rotary table (drilling rig)#By method of rotation or drilling method|rotary table]]), 
and none of these 3 components should ever be left implicit. 
''Example: the top of a reservoir may be found at 1,500 mMDRT in a particular well (1,500&amp;nbsp;m measured depth below the rotary table), which may be equal to 1,492 mTVDMSL (1,492&amp;nbsp; m true-vertical-depth below mean sea level) after correction for deviations from vertical.''

==Depth in a well as used in the oil and gas industry==
* Well depth values taken during the drilling operation are referred to as "[[driller's depth]]". The "total depth" for the well, core depths and all analysis of core / mud and other materials from the drilling hole are measured in "drillers depth".
* Well depth values from the [[Wireline logging|wireline loggers]] operation are referred to as "[[logger's depth]]". The loggers depth are typically considered more reliable than the drillers depth.
* The differences between loggers and drillers depths are due to different stretch in the drilling string when drilling, and the wire line entered into the bore hole during wireline logging operations. This difference is estimated and referred to as "core shift". A core from a certain drillers depth is lined up with a wireline log (loggers depth) and structures in the core are compared with the log and matched.
* Sign Convention - Depth increases positive in the downward direction.  This may seem intuitive but confusion can arise when using certain references while integrating data from different sources.  Workers mapping surfaces typically use elevation which, by convention, increases positive in the upward direction.  Be mindful when integrating depth and elevation.  For example, shallow wells drilled onshore often encounter reservoir at negative depths when referenced to sea level, mappers would define these same reservoirs at positive elevations when referenced to sea level. 
* Depth increases in the "down" direction, so an elevation is a negative depth.  There is no need to specify above or below the depth reference. 
   ''Example: RT = -10 mMDLAT''
* The term "subsea" (SS) by itself should not be used, as it is ambiguous.  It could mean: below [[sea floor]] or bottom, below mean sea level (MSL), below lowest [[astronomical tide]] (LAT), etc. 
* The acronym TVDSS is commonly used in the oil industry to represent TVD minus the elevation above mean sea level of the depth reference point of the well.  The depth reference point is the kelly bushing in the United States and a few other nations, but is the drill floor in most places.
* Differential (or relative) depths or thicknesses should generally be specified with at least two components: a unit and a path, plus any eventual specifiers to remove any possible ambiguity.  No specifier should ever be left "implicit" or "understood".  There are cases where a path is not needed and in fact should not be specified, because it is defined by the specifier, e.g. isochore (true [[stratigraphic]] thickness, independent of well path or inclination).   
* It is important to remember that depths, whether "absolute", "relative", "true", etc., have an intrinsic uncertainty and are never really true. 
* The distinction between "loggers' depth" and "drillers' depth" is becoming blurred due to the increasing use of logs acquired while drilling ([[LWD (Logging While Drilling)|LWD]]).  At the time of writing, the common practice remains that the petrophysicists or [[geologists]] define the "official depths" in a well, and these depths are frequently different from the "drillers' depth", after various corrections, tie-ins, etc., have been applied.
* Petrophysicists and drilling operations tend to express depths with reference to the rotary table or the original drill floor; geologists tend to use a common datum such as the mean sea level; [[geophysicists]] use the mean sea level.  This can introduce much confusion when a unit is not specified with all 3 components: unit, path, and reference.
* Special consideration must be given to depth measurement in toe-up laterals (J-profile).  In these cases the measured depth will continue to increase while true vertical depth will decrease toward the toe of the wellbore.

==Depth in practice== &lt;!-- examples from in the oil and gas industry in Australia --&gt;
* Unit: the usual unit of depth is the metre (m). 
* Path: common expressions of path are measured depth (MD) – elsewhere often known as along hole depth (AHD) – and true vertical depth (TVD).  Note that using TV for true vertical depth is not consistent with the use of MD for measured depth, hence the recommended TVD. 
* Reference:  
** the legal datum offshore Australia is Lowest Astronomical Tide (LAT) – (Ref. 1 &amp; 2).  Note that this requirement in itself can cause difficulties as it is difficult to measure offshore and can vary greatly between locations and even with time.  There is, however, an advantage to this convention: tidal corrections should always be of the same sign (negative depth), i.e. the sea level is always higher than or equal to LAT. 
** A commonly used alternative is Mean Sea Level (MSL). 
** A datum used in the past was Mean Indian Spring Low Water (MISLW).  It is comparable to, but not exactly the same as, LAT. 
** Common references used in operations include: Rotary Table (RT), Drill Floor (DF), Kelly Bushing (KB), Sea Bottom (SB), Ground Level (GL), Casing Bowl Flange (CBF).   
Any combination of unit, path, and reference can be used, as long as they result in fully specified, unambiguous depths. A well may reach to many kilometers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/longest-drilled-oil-well/ |title=Longest drilled oil well|publisher=Guinness world records |accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldoil.com/news/2015/4/14/sakhalin-1-sets-new-extended-reach-drilling-record-rosneft-says Sakhalin-1 sets new extended reach drilling record, Rosneft says], 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Earth-Three''' is a fictional [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] set in the {{DC Universe}}. It is the Earth of an alternate reality in the [[DC Multiverse]].  It first appeared in ''Justice League of America'' #29 (1964).

==Publication history==

===1964–1985: Original concept ===
[[Image:ClassicCSA.png|left|thumb|140px|The Crime Syndicate of America from ''Justice League of America'' Vol. 1 #207, art breakdowns by George Pérez.]]

Earth-Three was introduced by [[Gardner Fox]] and [[Mike Sekowsky]] in a 1964 issue of ''Justice League of America''. Earth-Three's history is depicted as a [[mirror image]] to that of the Earth we know.&lt;ref name="jla29"&gt;{{cite comic|writer=[[Gardner Fox|Fox, Gardner]]|penciller=[[Mike Sekowsky|Sekowsky, Mike]]|inker=[[Bernard Sachs (comics)|Sachs, Bernard]]|letterer=[[Gaspar Saladino|Saladino, Gaspar]]|editor=[[Julius Schwartz|Schwartz, Julius]]|story=Crisis on Earth-Three|title=[[Justice League of America]]|issue=29|date=August 1964|publisher=National Periodical Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Earth-Three, [[Christopher Columbus]] was [[United States|American]] and discovered [[Europe]]; [[England]] (a [[colony]] of [[United States|America]]) won freedom in a reversed form of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] (with [[George Washington]] surrendering his sword to [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Charles Cornwallis]]) in 1774; President [[John Wilkes Booth]] was assassinated by actor [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Crucially, Earth-Three was home to an analogue to the [[Justice League]], the [[Crime Syndicate of America]].&lt;ref name="jla29"/&gt;

The Crime Syndicate would recur as powerful enemies of the Justice League until DC's 1985 company-wide crossover, ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''. ''Crisis'' revealed  that [[Lex Luthor]], here called [[Alternative versions of Lex Luthor#Earth-Three|Alexander Luthor]], is the only [[superhero]] on an Earth otherwise occupied entirely by villains, most of whom are reversed analogues of heroes on other DC Earths.&lt;ref name="crisis1"&gt;{{cite comic|penciller=[[George Pérez|Pérez, George]]|writer=[[Marv Wolfman|Wolfman, Marv]]|inker=[[Dick Giordano|Giordano, Dick]]|letterer=[[John Costanza|Costanza, John]]|colorist=[[Tony Tollin|Tollin, Tony]]|editor=Wolfman, Marv|story=The Summoning|title=[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]|issue=1|date=April 1985|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earth-Three is destroyed by waves of [[antimatter]] in the opening scenes of the series. The sole survivor is the son of Alexander and Lois Lane Luthor, [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]]&lt;ref name="crisis1"/&gt; At the conclusion of the series, all other worlds in the Multiverse were merged.

===1992–2011: Anti-matter Earth, new Multiverse&lt;!--linked from 'List of DC Multiverse worlds'--&gt;===
DC used ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' to simplify its complex continuity and multiverse into a single narrative set on a single universe, not counting the [[Qward|antimatter universe]] which was integral to the story of how the [[Green Lantern]] villain [[Sinestro]] acquired his powers. Editorial mandate initially meant stories featuring the Crime Syndicate were entirely unavailable to writers, but DC later attempted to reintroduce the Crime Syndicate without the setting of Earth-Three in 1992's ''Justice League Quarterly'' #8, which featured a group of aliens from the planet Qward (the antimatter counterpart of [[Oa]]) who functioned as "more powerful" Justice League analogues.

This first attempt at bringing back the Crime Syndicate did not stick, and the principle concept behind Earth-Three would be revisited in [[Grant Morrison]]'s ''[[JLA: Earth 2]]''. Morrison recast much of Earth-Three's history as that of the Antimatter Universe's own version of Earth, which is home to the [[Crime Syndicate#The modern Syndicate|Crime Syndicate of America]]. He makes notable departures to this formula however, by presenting this world as the product of an [[alternate history]] and by reimagining various Crime Syndicate members (for example, by recasting [[Owlman (comics)#JLA: Earth 2|Owlman]] as Batman's brother Thomas Wayne, and by recasting [[Ultraman (comics)#Post-Crisis Version|Ultraman]] not as the alien Kal-El but a human astronaut who acquires Kryptonian abilities). At the end of ''JLA: Earth-2'', Amerika had launched a [[nuclear warfare|nuclear strike]] on [[London]], against Britain's independence movement.

In ''[[Superman/Batman]] Annual'' #1, three members of this Crime Syndicate of Amerika—Ultraman, Owlman, and [[Superwoman#Crime Syndicate of America|Superwoman]]—appear on the main DC Earth, along with an unnamed antimatter doppelganger of [[Deathstroke]] (whose behavior, including humorous breaking of the fourth wall, and powers are the same as [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Deadpool]]) hired to protect [[Bruce Wayne]]. The story supposedly takes place as the first time Superman and Batman figure out each other's identities, and matches Batman, Superman, and Deathstroke against their respective antimatter selves. The story is told by [[Mr. Mxyzptlk]] and may therefore be completely untrue.

In the final issue of the 52-issue weekly series ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' in 2007, a new [[List of DC Multiverse worlds#The 52|Multiverse]] is revealed, originally consisting of 52 parallel realities. Among the parallel realities shown is one designated "Earth-3". As a result of [[Mister Mind and the Monster Society of Evil|Mister Mind]] "eating" aspects of this reality, it takes on visual aspects of the pre-Crisis Earth-Three.&lt;ref&gt;''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' Week 52 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The Earth-3 concept was not heavily explored after this, but does figure in a couple of issues of ''52''{{'}}s follow-up weekly series, ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]'' (2007&amp;ndash;8). The name of the new Earth-3 team is revealed to be the ''Crime Society of America''. The Crime Society are considered to be evil versions of the heroes of Earth-2, acting as a new Golden Age counterpart to the Antimatter Earth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=11396 Comic Book Resources - CBR News: CCI: DC New World Order&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  A hero known as [[Alternative versions of Joker#Earth-3|the Jokester]] operates in this universe, as later do [[Riddler (comics)|the Riddler]], [[Two-Face|Three-Face (Evelyn Dent)]], and [[Duela Dent]]. In ''Countdown'' #31 the version of [[Zatanna]] ([[Zatanna#Alternate versions|Annataz Arataz]]) from this world was used by [[Superman-Prime]] to keep [[Mister Mxyzptlk]] in check. Based on comments by [[Grant Morrison]], this alternate universe is not the pre-Crisis Earth-Three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=111900 |title=The 52 Exit Interviews: Grant Morrison |accessdate=May 12, 2007 |last=Brady |first=Matt |date=May 8, 2007 |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510031223/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=111900 |archivedate=May 10, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the return of the DC Multiverse and the creation of a new Earth-3, the Antimatter Earth still exists in Qward, acting as an inverted microcosm of New Earth. The pre-established Crime Syndicate of Amerika from the Antimatter Universe were then featured heavily in ''[[Trinity (comic book)|Trinity]]'', DC's third year-long weekly series.

===2013–2016: The New 52===
DC again rebooted its continuity in 2011 as part of [[The New 52]]. In 2013, the "[[Trinity War]]" [[crossover event]] reintroduces Earth-3. It is mentioned as the home of true evil and of the [[Crime Syndicate of America#The New 52|Crime Syndicate]] and that it was destroyed by an unknown [[Anti-Monitor|entity]]. The Crime Syndicate is largely modeled after Morrison's, with the introduction of new characters, and by re-envisioning Ultraman once again as an alien with an origin story which more closely parallels Superman's. In the closing scenes of "Trinity War", Ultraman, Superwoman, Owlman, [[Johnny Quick]], [[Power Ring (DC supervillains)|Power Ring]], [[Firestorm (comics)#Earth-3|Deathstorm]], [[Outsider (comics)#The New 52|Alfred Pennyworth]] and [[Atom (comics)#Rhonda Pineda|Atomica]] reveal themselves to the Justice League of New Earth. [[Aquaman#Earth-3|Sea King]] also inhabited Earth-3, but quickly died after passing through the gateway to New Earth.&lt;ref name="Justice League 23"&gt;{{cite comic|writer=[[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|penciller=Reis, Ivan|inker=Prado, Joe, Oclair Albert, Eber Ferreira|colorist=Reis, Rod|letterer=Napolitano, Nick J.|story=Trinity War Chapter Six: Conclusion|title=[[Justice League#The New 52|Justice League]]|volume=2|issue=23|date=October 2013|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An Earth-3 version [[Martian Manhunter]] is also revealed to exist.&lt;ref name="Pandora 4"&gt;{{cite comic|writer=Fawkes, Ray|artist=Portela, Francis|colorist=Hi-Fi|letterer=Esposito, Taylor|story=End of the Curse Part 1: The New World|title=Trinity of Sin: Pandora|volume=1|issue=4|date=December 2013|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alternate versions of Lex Luthor#Earth-3|Alexander Luthor]], who can become [[Mazahs]], is also from Earth-3, and an enemy of the Crime Syndicate.&lt;ref name="Forever Evil 6"&gt;{{cite comic|writer=[[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|penciller=[[David Finch (comics)|Finch, David]]|inker=Friend, Richard|colorist=Oback, Sonia|letterer=Leigh, Rob|story=Forever Evil Chapter Six: The Power of Mazahs!|title=Forever Evil|volume=1|issue=6|date=May 2014|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official site of DC Comics describes Earth-Three as a world where the values of "good" and "evil" are reversed, with "evil" being the way of the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dccomics.com/characters/earth-3&lt;/ref&gt;

| [[Ultraman (comics)|Ultraman]]
| Lieutenant Clark Kent/Ultraman
| Kal-Il/Clark Kent/Ultraman
| Similar to the story of Superman, the Ultraman was sent from the planet Krypton to Earth-Three where he first encountered Kryptonite in outer space which began to change him into a super-powerhouse possessing vast powers and abilities. Upon reaching adulthood, he renamed himself Ultraman and began a life of conquest and destruction. It would be during his conquering that he encountered four other superpowered beings who would all loosely gather together in various schemes to overtake their world and become the Crime Syndicate of America. His real name is unknown.

Following ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', another version of the character appeared, apparently being killed by quantum energy unleashed from Monarch, in the Earth-51 dimension, along with his entire team, the Crime Society.

The antimatter Ultraman was a human astronaut, whose ship was imploded into hyperspace and an unknown alien race reconstructed Kent in an attempt to repair the damaged astronaut, which ended up altering the human both mentally and physically, giving him ultrapowers. The process also twisted his mind. Ultraman's power relies on his proximity and exposure to a substance called Anti-Kryptonite; the longer and farther he is separated from it, the weaker he becomes. Ultraman is unhappily married to his Crime Syndicate teammate Superwoman. He later died in ''Final Crisis''.

In the New 52, Ultraman comes from a version of Krypton whose people worship strength and despise weakness. When he arrives on Earth, he decides to blend into society until he is ready to conquer the planet, and puts into slavery [[Jonathan and Martha Kent#The New 52: Earth 3|a young abusive couple of drug addicts]].  When he turns seven, he murders them and burns down their farm. As Clark Kent and later on Ultraman, he went on to found the Crime Syndicate and take over the world.  After Earth-3 is devastated by the same being that destroyed Krypton, Ultraman leads the Crime Syndicate to the main DC Earth to conquer it. This version of Ultraman is empowered by Kryptonite (and even snorts it like a drug) and is weakened by sunlight. After being defeated by the Justice League, Ultraman is in the custody of the authorities.

| [[Owlman (comics)|Owlman]]
| colspan="2" | Thomas Wayne, Jr./Owlman
| Owlman is an unnamed super-intelligent supervillain and a member of the Crime Syndicate of America. In some of his appearances, Owlman also had the ability to briefly control other people's minds, though it is unclear how he acquired this ability. He was also able to see in the dark. He developed artificial devices to enhance his mental abilities, most notably the large reflective owl eyes in his helmet which he uses as a focusing transmitter onto his target.

Following ''52'', another version of the character appeared. In ''The Search for Ray Palmer: Crime Society'', he is shown to be killed by the Jokester. Based on statements and illustrations in this same book, it is stated one of earlier Talons succeeded the old Owlman.&lt;br /&gt;A young new Owlman ([[Jason Todd]]'s counterpart) with a different costume and helmet later appears in the same book battling the Jokester. This Owlman appears again in ''Countdown'' #31, assisted by a team referred to as the Crime Society. He was apparently killed by quantum energy unleashed from Monarch, in the Earth-51 dimension, along with the rest of his teammates.

In the antimatter universe, Thomas Wayne, Jr. is the older brother of that reality's Bruce Wayne. Young Bruce is killed along with his mother by a policeman when [[Thomas Wayne#JLA: Earth 2|Thomas, Sr.]], the Commissioner of GCPD, refused to accompany him for questioning. Thomas, Jr., escapes and grows up to become Owlman, a master criminal and  ally to [[James Gordon (comics)#JLA: Earth 2|Boss Gordon]]. While Ultraman is the leader of the Syndicate, Owlman is the brains behind the group. Further complicating issues is that Owlman has carried on a longtime affair with Ultraman's wife Superwoman. Ultraman is aware of the affair, but due to Owlman having undisclosed photographic blackmail material against the villain, he is unable to seek retribution against Owlman for the betrayal.

In the New 52, Thomas, Jr., with the aid of Alfred, murders his parents so he can inherit the Wayne fortune. He grows up to become Owlman and joins the Crime Syndicate. He had a secret affair with Ultraman's wife and teammate Superwoman. Thomas takes Richard Grayson under his wing and trains him to become his sidekick, Talon. He along with the rest of the Crime Syndicate moved to the main DC Earth to conquer it. After being defeated by the Justice League, Owlman is mentioned to still be at large.

| [[Superwoman#Crime Syndicate of America|Superwoman]]
| colspan="2" | Lois Lane/Superwoman&lt;div id="anote1"&gt;
| Similar to the story of Wonder Woman, Super-Woman is an Amazon. Her golden lasso can change shape into any form she desires. Superwoman is a renegade who left Paradise Island on her own accord after finding out about the outside world.

Following ''52'', another version of the character appeared as a member of the Crime Society. This Superwoman is Lois Lane and Ultraman's wife, like her antimatter counterpart. She is apparently killed by quantum energy unleashed from Monarch, in the Earth-51 dimension, along with the rest of her teammates.

&lt;div id="anote1"&gt;In the antimatter universe, Superwoman (alias Lois Lane) is an Amazon born on Damnation Island.  She is the chief editor of the ''Daily Planet'' in what she calls "Patriarch's World".  It is mentioned that she murdered all of her fellow Amazons.  She is assisted by [[Jimmy Olsen]], a compliant sexual deviant, who does what she tells him in exchange for the favor of watching when she changes her outfit. Superwoman has also joined the Crime Syndicate. She is married to Clark Kent/Ultraman, who hates Superwoman's frigidity towards him, while carrying on a torrid affair with Owlman. Her magic lasso is able to release the inhibitions of anyone tied with it.  She also possesses heat vision.

In the New 52, Superwoman/Lois Lane along with the remaining Syndicate members arrive on Prime Earth to conquer it. Her true past and identity are still a mystery. She carries the lasso of submission, which compels the tied individual to obey and love the wielder. She is pregnant and engaging in a secret affair with Owlman, while being married to Ultraman. It is revealed that Superwoman is also in a relationship with the crazed Alexander Luthor, who is the father of her child. She betrays Ultraman and the Syndicate, revealing her child is prophesied to bring the world to an end. After being defeated by the Justice League, she is placed in captivity. Immune to Wonder Woman's lasso of truth, she does not reveal any information.

| colspan="2" | [[Johnny Quick#Crime Syndicate of America|Johnny Quick]]
| Jonathan Allen/Johnny Quick
| Most of Johnny Quick's history is unrevealed. He was born with an enhanced speed, and later found a helmet that allowed him to focus his considerable speed into far greater levels. Adopting the name of "Johnny Quick" he began his lifelong career of criminal conquest, and is a founding member of the Crime Syndicate of America. His real name is unknown.

Following ''52'', another version of the character appeared, as a member of the Crime Society. He is apparently killed by quantum energy unleashed from Monarch, in the Earth-51 dimension, along with the rest of his teammates.

In the antimatter universe, Johnny ([[Wally West]]'s counterpart) receives his powers by injecting himself with a drug called "Speed Juice". He is addicted to it and goes into massive physical withdrawal without it. As part of the Tribute the world's leaders pay the Crime Syndicate, they supply Quick with this drug. His real name is unknown.&lt;br /&gt;Johnny had a predecessor ([[Barry Allen (Flash)|Barry Allen]]'s counterpart), whom he killed and whose blood was used to create the drug. In ''Justice League of America'' #51, [[Jesse Chambers]] says "This Johnny Quick has my father's face", implying that the name is more than coincidence and that her [[Johnny Quick (Johnny Chambers)|father]] and the former Antimatter Johnny Quick (Barry Allen's counterpart) are genetically the same person.

In The New 52, Johnny Quick is one of the members of the Crime Syndicate to arrive on Prime Earth in order to conquer it. He is a high-profile criminal, on the run with his equally criminal girlfriend, Rhonda Pineda. Together they have committed several crimes, many of them against police officers like [[Weather Wizard|Detective Mardon]], [[Sam Scudder|Sergeant Scudder]] and [[Axel Walker|Officer Walker]]. "Johnny and Rhonnie", as they were known, ended up cornered on the roof of S.T.A.R. Labs during a storm, after being chased by two police officers, [[Captain Cold#Other versions|Snart]] and [[Heat Wave (comics)#Earth-3|Rory]]. Lightning hit a satellite, electrocuting Johnny, causing him to gain his powers.&lt;ref name="Justice League 23" /&gt; After that he and his now also empowered girlfriend joined the Syndicate. On Prime Earth, when Lex Luthor's team infiltrates the fallen Watchtower, Johnny Quick joins in the fight.  Captain Cold uses his freeze gun to freeze Johnny Quick's leg and break it off.  When Alexander Luthor from Earth-3 is freed, he kills Johnny Quick and steals his powers.&lt;ref name="Forever Evil 6" /&gt;

| [[Power Ring (DC supervillains)|Power Ring]]
| Joseph Harrolds/Power Ring
| Harold Jordan/Power Ring
| He was actively seeking out mystical power for some reason and found it when a mad monk gave him a lamp and a matching ring of unlimited power. He is a founding member of the Crime Syndicate of America. His real name is unknown.

Following ''52'', another version of the character appeared, as a member of the Crime Society. He wis apparently killed by quantum energy unleashed from Monarch, in the Earth-51 dimension, along with the rest of his teammates.

In the antimatter universe, original Power Ring Joseph Harrolds tricks an unnamed, cowardly slave marine ([[Kyle Rayner]]'s counterpart) into accepting the ring and the power lamp that contains the mad god Volthoom.  The unnamed individual are changed, and the second Power Ring's physical appearance is changed from a white blonde man to [[John Stewart (comics)#Anti-Matter Universe|an African-American bald man]]. His origin and anonymity remain the same.&lt;br /&gt;In his later appearances, Power Ring once again resembles his original version (Hal Jordan's counterpart).

In the New 52, Power Ring is one of the members of the Crime Syndicate to arrive on Prime Earth in order to conquer it. Harold works as a janitor at Ferris Air, where he spies on Carol Ferris' operations. Abin Sur's ring of Volthoom chooses Harold. [[Power Ring (DC Comics)#Abin Sur .28Earth 3.29|Abin]] begs Harold to take the ring, which he does, freeing Abin Sur. The ring opens a pocket dimensional portal to charge itself, unleashing a creature that attacks Harold. Wielding the ring causes Harold Jordan great pain and the cursed weapon often acts on its own accord. On Prime Earth, Power Ring battles Sinestro, but Sinestro cuts off his right arm, releasing him from the ring's control.  The ownerless ring then flies off to find a new host.&lt;ref name="Forever Evil 5"&gt;{{cite comic|writer=[[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|penciller=[[David Finch (comics)|Finch, David]]|inker=Friend, Richard|colorist=Oback, Sonia|letterer=Leigh, Rob|story=Forever Evil Chapter Five: Hit and Run|title=Forever Evil|volume=1|issue=5|date=March 2014|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| Alexander Luthor, Sr.
| Lex Luthor
| [[Alternate versions of Lex Luthor#Earth-3|Alexander Luthor]]/[[Mazahs]]
| Alexander and his wife are able only to save their son, [[Alexander, Jr.]] ("Alex") from the complete destruction of their reality by placing him in a capsule which takes him to Earth-One.  The existence of the Earth-Three reality is ultimately erased from all history. Alexander Luthor, Jr. survives not only the demise of his native reality, but also the collapse of the Multiverse. He alone maintains memories of Alexander Luthor, Sr. and his world.

In the antimatter universe, Lex is the only known hero at the time. It is revealed the Luthor is allowed to live because Ultraman likes the challenge of hunting down Luthor when the hero makes one of his inevitable escapes from custody. During one such break-out Luthor jumps dimensions, landing on New Earth.

In the New 52, Alexander Luthor is revealed as Mazahs, the Earth-3 version of [[Shazam! (DC Comics)|Shazam]]. The Crime Syndicate brings Alexander as their prisoner to Prime Earth. Lex Luthor and his team sneak in to the Justice League Watchtower where the Syndicate has Alexander hostage, and remove the duct tape holding his mouth closed. As soon as this is done, Alexander speaks the word, 'Mazahs', transforming himself into an evil version of Shazam, and kills Johnny Quick. It is also revealed that Superwoman is in a relationship with Alexander and is responsible for tricking her teammates into bringing him with them. She also reveals she is carrying his child, who is prophesied to bring an end to the world. Exploiting his ability to use the powers of those he has killed, Mazahs easily takes down both the Syndicate and Luthor's team. The Lex Luthor of Prime Earth, having the same voice as Mazahs, manages to call down the lightning and transform Mazahs into his human form. Sealing Alexander's mouth, Lex stabs him with a knife, killing him.&lt;ref name="Forever Evil 6" /&gt;

| In the parallel reality known as Earth-Three, Lois Lane married Earth's greatest champion, Alexander Luthor. Shortly before the event known as the Crisis on Infinite Earths, the Luthors gave birth to a baby boy, Alex, Jr. When the Anti-Monitor, released a wave of Antimatter energy that swept across the Multiverse, Lois and Alex placed their son inside of a specially designed module and launched him away from the beleaguered planet. Alex, Sr. and Lois Lane died in each other's arms as the Antimatter swept across their world.

| He was trapped in the Phantom Zone for his crimes. One day he was able to flee from the Zone, reaching Earth-One's Kandor, on the exact day that Brainiac shrank and stole Kandor. In diminutive size, he became a crime boss there. Decades later, Jur-Ll battled Kandor's costumed crimefighters Nightwing and Flamebird.

The people of Krypton of Earth 3 had gained great power from the radiation of their world, but through the machinations of Jor-Il, a mysterious being came to their planet and began a process that would lead to the planet's destruction. Thanks to a shooting spree, Jor-Il is able to secure a lifepod for his son, who he regarded as his best chance of revenge.

| Jackie/The Jokester
| {{N/A}}
| The Joker
| Bullied and abused for much of his life, Jackie found happiness with the beautiful, loving Evelyn Dent, only to lose her when her split personalities developed. He became a struggling comedian at the Last Laugh comedy club, but witnessed the club's owner being murdered by the vicious Owlman. Sick of being bullied, Jackie redesigned his act, focusing all his jokes on Owlman. Aided by manager [[Harley Quinn#Other versions|Harleen Quinzel]], he became a kind of hero to the frustrated Gotham populace for boldly ridiculing every aspect of the thuggish villain. Owlman's retribution, however, was deadly. Harleen was murdered and Jackie's mouth was sliced open, leaving him with an unusually wide grin. Whatever sanity he'd possessed vanished in that moment as he became the Jokester, dedicating his life to ruining and humiliating Owlman and his sidekick Talon. It is revealed that [[Duela Dent]], who has escaped to New Earth, is his daughter.

In the New 52, after killing Talon and assaulting Alfred Pennyworth, the Joker is killed by Owlman. He blamed Owlman for his unstable state.&lt;ref name="Justice League 23.4"&gt;{{cite comic|writer=[[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]], [[Sterling Gates]]|artist=Kudranski, Szymon|colorist=Kalisz, John|letterer=Esposito, Taylor|story=The Wild Card|title=Justice League|volume=2|issue=23.4|date=November 2013|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the antimatter universe, Edward Nashton was fascinated by puzzles and games from an early age. He was considered one of the smartest men on his Earth, and naturally inclined to altruism. He operated as a crimefighter under the moniker "the Quizmaster", eventually becoming a founding member of the Justice Underground. He was a thorn in the side of Owlman and the Crime Syndicate of Amerika for many years. He later has the right half of his face burned by Ultraman, leading him to don a half-face and temporarily take on the name "Enigma".

| Richard "Dick" Grayson/Talon
| Talon had been an apprentice to Owlman. He was in a relationship with the Jokester's daughter, Duela Dent, which led to him leaving Owlman's service for a time. Unfortunately, the truth caused Jokester to disown Duela. Somehow, Duela and Talon ended up on New Earth, where both spent time as temporary members of the [[Teen Titans]]. It is unknown what has happened to Talon beyond that. His real name is unknown. It has been indicated that there have been more than one Talons and this specific iteration is the second one.

In the New 52, Talon is the Dick Grayson of Earth-3. His parents were acrobats and money launderers who ran a corrupt circus, obtaining it after murdering the previous owner, [[Tony Zucco#Earth 3|a clown]]. Dick also had a sister, Rachel. After his family was murdered, Owlman took Dick under his wing and he eventually became his sidekick. Their relationship fell apart when Dick learned that Thomas Wayne, Jr. was responsible for the Graysons' deaths. Dick is later killed by the Joker.&lt;ref name="Justice League 23.4" /&gt;

| Even though the character was created in 1976, her origin story and true parentage were not revealed until ''Countdown Presents The Search for Ray Palmer: Crime Society'' (2007). Before that she claimed to be the daughter of various villains, such as the Joker, [[Catwoman]], [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]], [[The Penguin (comics)|The Penguin]], [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]], [[Dr. Light]] and [[Punch and Jewelee]]. Through the years, she has assumed many aliases, with most of them indicating her "true" parentage. In ''Countdown'' it is revealed she is from Earth-3 and is the daughter of the Jokester and [[Two-Face#Earth-Three|Evelyn Dent]]. She was raised by her mother and her stepfather, the Riddler, and together the three formed the Riddler Family. When she was finally introduced to her birth father, she dropped cryptic hints implying that she or her consciousness shifts unknowingly from Earth to Earth, which is the source of her parental confusion. When the Jokester joined the Riddler Family, Duela revealed that she had been in a relationship with Talon. The Jokester renounced her as his daughter and Duela left with Talon moments before the Crime Society stormed their apartment.

| [[Crime Syndicate of America]]/Crime Society of America
| colspan="2" | Crime Syndicate
| In their first appearance, the Crime Syndicate (CSA), bored with the ease with which they were able to commit crimes on their Earth, discover the existence of parallel worlds. Intrigued by the existence of super-heroes, they cross the dimensional void and attack the JLA and JSA. They are ultimately defeated and imprisoned. Over the ensuing years, the Syndicate or one of its members would occasionally escape and attempt to wreak havoc on Earth-One and/or Earth-Two. Earth-Three and the original Crime Syndicate are destroyed along with the rest of DC's parallel worlds in the 1985 twelve-issue maxi-series ''Crisis on Infinite Earths''. As shown in the first issue, Earth-Three and all of its inhabitants were obliterated by an anti-matter wave that was the catalyst for the story. The five founding members (Ultraman, Owlman, Superwoman, Johnny Quick and Power Ring) of CSA have appeared in all additional iterations of the team.
* A new version of the team was eventually introduced in ''Justice League Quarterly'' #8. This version was composed of Qwardians and they were a [[Justice League International|JLI]] equivalent to the old Crime Syndicate. They are shown to be different from the Earth-Three incarnation by their enlarged eyes, resembling the Weaponers of Qward. They acted as Claire Montgomery's second [[Conglomerate (comics)|Conglomerate]] team and its roster consisted of [[Green Arrow#Other versions|Deadeye]], Elasti-Man ([[Elongated Man]]'s counterpart), Fiero ([[Fire (comics)|Fire]]'s counterpart), Frostbite ([[Ice (comics)|Ice]]'s counterpart), [[Blue Beetle#52 Multiverse|Scarab]], Element Man ([[Metamorpho (comics)|Metamorpho]]'s counterpart) and Slipstream ([[Flash (comics)|Flash]]'s counterpart).
* &lt;div id="anote2"&gt;Following ''52'', a new version of the team is introduced. In ''Countdown'' #31, the name of this team is revealed to be the Crime Society of America, evil doppelgangers of the heroes of Earth-2, and make their first solo appearance in ''Countdown Presents The Search for Ray Palmer: Crime Society'' #1. In addition to the five known members, this version of the CSA includes unnamed counterparts of Martian Manhunter, Green Arrow, [[Wildcat]], [[Hawkwoman]], [[Courtney Whitmore#Other versions|Stargirl]], [[Donna Troy]], [[Booster Gold#52 Multiverse|Booster Gold]] and the [[Spectre (comics)#Miscellaneous|Spectre]]. Later issues introduce [[Zatanna#Earth-3|Annataz Arataz]], [[Black Canary#Other versions|White Cat]] and [[Alternative versions of Supergirl#Mainstream and continually published depictions|Ultragirl]]. Shortly after the Crime Society's introduction, they are offered a place among Monarch's army. All of the Crime Society members who are present in the Earth-51 dimension at the end battle with Superman-Prime and the Monarch are killed, as the entire dimension is completely destroyed with only Superman-Prime and a single plant surviving the cataclysm.

The Crime Syndicate is reintroduced in the graphic novel ''JLA: Earth 2''. Unlike the previous incarnations, this '''Crime Syndicate of Amerika''' rules their world, collecting kickbacks from the world governments. The antimatter Crime Syndicate's motto is "Cui Bono?" ("Who profits?"). The team's roster consists mainly of the five founding members. The Crime Syndicate later reappears, where they lay waste to the planet Qward out of boredom.

In the New 52, the leader of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]], previously known as "the Outsider", is actually working for the Syndicate. He gains possession of Pandora's Box to open a portal to Earth-3 from which the Crime Syndicate emerges. The Syndicate proceeds to attack the fallen Justice League members and claims Prime Earth now belongs to them. The line-up consists of the five founding members as well as Deathstorm, Sea King (who does not survive the trip to Prime Earth), Atomica (who had posed as Atom while working as a mole for the Secrety Society), and Grid(a sentient computer virus in a robot body made from Cyborg's old prosthetic parts). When heroes and villains unite to defeat the Syndicate, Outsider is killed by [[Black Manta]] and Power Ring is murdered by Sinestro. Johnny Quick and Deathstorm  are killed when the Syndicate's enemy Mazahs is freed, while Lex kills Atomica by stepping on her. In the aftermath, Ultraman and Superwoman are captured with Owlman still on the loose.  The other former members of the Syndicate, along with the rest of Earth 3, are killed when that universe is destroyed.

Emergy is an expression of all the energy used in the work processes that generate a product or service in units of one type of energy. Emergy is measured in units of ''emjoule''s, a unit referring to the available energy consumed in transformations. Emergy accounts for different forms of energy and resources (e.g. sunlight, water, fossil fuels, minerals, etc.) Each form is generated by transformation processes in nature and each has a different ability to support work in natural and in human systems. The recognition of these quality differences is a key concept.

==History==

The theoretical and conceptual basis for the emergy methodology is grounded in [[thermodynamics]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}, [[System theory|general system theory]]&lt;ref&gt;von Bertalanffy. L. 1968. [[System theory|General System Theory]]. George Braziller Publ. New York 295 p.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[systems ecology]].&lt;ref name=SysEco&gt;Odum, H. T. 1983.  ''Systems Ecology: An Introduction''.  John Wiley, NY. 644 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Evolution of the theory by [[Howard T. Odum]] over the first thirty years is reviewed in ''Environmental Accounting''&lt;ref name =EnvAcct/&gt; and in the volume edited by C. A. S. Hall titled ''Maximum Power''.&lt;ref name=SelfOrg&gt;Odum, H.T., 1995. Self organization and maximum power. Chapter 28, pp. 311-364 in ''Maximum Power'', Ed. by C .A. S. Hall, University Press of Colorado, Niwot.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background===

Beginning in the 1950s, Odum analyzed [[energy flow (ecology)|energy flow]] in ecosystems (''e.g.'' [[Silver Springs, Florida]];&lt;ref name=SilverSprings&gt;Odum, H. T. 1957.  Trophic structure and productivity of Silver Springs, Florida.  ''Ecol. Monogr''. 27:55-112.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Enewetak Atoll|Enewetak atoll]] in the south Pacific;&lt;ref name=Eniwetok&gt;Odum, H. T. and E. P. Odum. 1955.  Trophic structure and productivity of a windward coral reef at Eniwetok Atoll, Marshall Islands.  ''Ecol. Monogr.'' 25:291-320.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Galveston Bay]], Texas&lt;ref name=Texas&gt;Odum, H. T. and C. M. Hoskin. 1958.  Comparative studies of the metabolism of Texas Bays.  ''Pubi. Inst. Mar. Sci.'', Univ. Tex. 5:16-46.&lt;/ref&gt; and Puerto Rican rainforests,&lt;ref name=PR&gt;Odum, H. T. and R. F. Pigeon, eds. 1970.  ''A Tropical Rain Forest''.  Division of Technical Information, U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. 1600 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; amongst others) where energies in various forms at various scales were observed. His analysis of energy flow in ecosystems, and the differences in the [[potential energy]] of sunlight, fresh water currents, wind and [[ocean current]]s led him to make the suggestion that when two or more different energy sources drive a system, they cannot be added without first converting them to a common measure that accounts for their differences in energy quality. This led him to introduce the concept of "energy of one kind" as a common denominator with the name "energy cost".&lt;ref name=FoodProd&gt;Odum, H. T. 1967.  Energetics of food production.  In: The ''World Food Problem, Report of the President's Science Advisory Committee, Panel on World Food Supply, Vol. 3''. The Whitehouse. pp. 55-94.&lt;/ref&gt; He then expanded the analysis to model food production in the 1960s,&lt;ref name=FoodProd /&gt; and in the 1970s to [[fossil fuel]]s.&lt;ref name= Congress&gt;Odum, H. T. ''et al.'' 1976.  Net Energy Analysis of Alternatives for the United States.  In ''U.S. Energy Policy: Trends and Goals'',  Part V – Middle and Long-term Energy Policies and Alternatives. 94th Congress 2nd Session Committee Print.  Prepared for the Subcommittee on Energy and Power of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce of the U.S. House of Representatives, 66-723, U.S. Govt.  Printing Office, Wash, DC. pp. 254–304.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Man&amp;Nature&gt;Odum, H. T. and E. C. Odum. 1976.  ''Energy Basis for Man and Nature''. McGraw-Hill, NY. 297 pp&lt;/ref&gt;

Odum's first formal statement of what would later be termed emergy was in 1973:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Energy is measured by calories, [[btu]]'s, kilowatthours, and other intraconvertable units, but energy has a scale of quality which is not indicated by these measures.  The ability to do work for man depends on the energy quality and quantity and this is measurable by the amount of energy of a lower quality grade required to develop the higher grade. The scale of energy goes from dilute sunlight up to plant matter, to coal, from coal to oil, to electricity and up to the high quality efforts of computer and human [[information processing]].&lt;ref name=AMBIO&gt;Odum, H. T. 1973.  ''Energy, ecology and economics''.  Royal Swedish Academy of Science.  AMBIO 2(6):220-227.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1975, he introduced a table of "Energy Quality Factors", kilocalories of sunlight energy required to make a kilocalorie of a higher quality energy,&lt;ref name=NRGQuality&gt;Odum, H. T. 1976.  'Energy quality and carrying capacity of the earth.  Response at Prize Ceremony, Institute de la Vie, Paris.  ''Tropical Ecology'' 16(l):1–8.&lt;/ref&gt; the first mention of the energy hierarchy principle which states that "energy quality is measured by the energy used in the transformations" from one type of energy to the next.

These energy quality factors, were placed on a fossil-fuel basis and called "Fossil Fuel Work Equivalents" (FFWE), and the quality of energies were measured based on a fossil fuel standard with rough equivalents of 1 kilocalorie of fossil fuel equal to 2000 kilocalories of sunlight. "Energy quality ratios" were computed by evaluating the quantity of energy in a transformation process to make a new form and were then used to convert different forms of energy to a common form, in this case fossil fuel equivalents. FFWE's were replaced with coal equivalents (CE) and by 1977, the system of evaluating quality was placed on a solar basis and termed solar equivalents (SE).&lt;ref name=NRGAnalysis&gt;Odum, H. T. 1977.  Energy analysis, energy quality and environment.  In ''Energy Analysis: A New Public Policy Tool'', M. W. Gilliland, ed.  American Association for the Advancement of Science, Selected Symposium No. 9, Wash. DC. Westview Press. pp. 55–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Embodied energy===

The term "[[embodied energy]]" was used for a time in the early 1980s to refer to energy quality differences in terms of their costs of generation, and a ratio called a "quality factor" for the calories (or joules) of one kind of energy required to make those of another.&lt;ref name=EnvEdu&gt;Odum, E. C., and Odum, H. T., 1980. Energy systems and environmental education. Pp. 213–231 in: ''Environmental Education- Principles, Methods and Applications'', Ed. by T. S. Bakshi and Z. Naveh. Plenum Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the term embodied energy was used by other groups who were evaluating the fossil fuel energy required to generate products and were not including all energies or using the concept to imply quality, embodied energy was dropped in favor of "embodied solar calories", and the quality factors became known as "transformation ratios".

===Introduction of the term "emergy"===

Use of the term "embodied energy" for this concept was modified in 1986 when [[David M. Scienceman|David Scienceman]], a visiting scholar at the University of Florida from Australia, suggested the term "emergy" and "emjoule" or "emcalorie" as the unit of measure to distinguish emergy units from units of available energy.&lt;ref&gt;Scienceman, D. M., 1987. "Energy and Emergy," in G. Pillet and T. Murota (eds), ''Environmental Economics: The Analysis of a Major Interface,'' R. Leimgruber, Geneva, pp. 257–276. (CFW-86-26)&lt;/ref&gt; The term transformation ratio was shortened to [[transformity]] in about the same time. It is important to note that throughout this twenty years the baseline or the basis for evaluating forms of energy and resources shifted from organic matter, to fossil fuels and finally to solar energy.

After 1986, the emergy methodology continued to develop as the community of scientists expanded and as new applied research into combined systems of humans and nature presented new conceptual and theoretical questions. The maturing of the emergy methodology resulted in more rigorous definitions of terms and nomenclature and refinement of the methods of calculating transformities. The [http://EmergySociety.org International Society for the Advancement of Emergy Research] and a biennial [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611231212/http://www.cep.ees.ufl.edu/conference.asp International Conference] at the University of Florida support this research.

==Definitions and examples==

'''''Emergy'''''— amount of energy of one form that is used in transformations directly and indirectly to make a product or service. The unit of emergy is the '''emjoule''' or emergy joule. Using emergy, sunlight, fuel, electricity, and human service can be put on a common basis by expressing each of them in the emjoules of solar energy that is required to produce them. If solar emergy is the baseline, then the results are solar emjoules (abbreviated seJ). Although other baselines have been used, such as coal emjoules or electrical emjoules, in most cases emergy data are given in solar emjoules.

'''''Unit Emergy Values (UEVs)''''' — the emergy required to generate one unit of output. Types of UEVs:
:'''''Transformity''''' — emergy input per unit of available energy output. For example, if 10,000 solar emjoules are required to generate a joule of wood, then the solar transformity of that wood is 10,000 solar emjoules per joule (abbreviated seJ/J). The solar transformity of the sunlight absorbed by the earth is 1.0 by definition.

:'''''Specific emergy''''' — emergy per unit mass output. Specific emergy is usually expressed as solar emergy per gram (seJ/g). Because energy is required to concentrate materials, the unit emergy value of any substance increases with concentration. Elements and compounds not abundant in nature therefore have higher emergy/mass ratios when found in concentrated form since more environmental work is required to concentrate them, both spatially and chemically.

:'''''Emergy per unit money''''' — the emergy supporting the generation of one unit of economic product (expressed in monetary terms)''.'' It is used to convert money into emergy units. Since money is paid for goods and services, but not to the environment, the contribution to a process represented by monetary payments is the emergy that money purchases. The amount of resources that money buys depends on the amount of emergy supporting the economy and the amount of money circulating. An average emergy/money ratio in solar emjoules/$ can be calculated by dividing the total emergy use of a state or nation by its gross economic product. It varies by country and has been shown to decrease each year, which is one index of inflation. This emergy/money ratio is useful for evaluating service inputs given in money units where an average wage rate is appropriate.

:'''''Emergy per unit labor''''' — the emergy supporting one unit of direct labor applied to a process''.'' Workers apply their efforts to a process and in so doing they indirectly invest in it the emergy that made their labor possible (food, training, transport, etc). This emergy intensity is generally expressed as emergy per time (seJ/yr; seJ/hr), but emergy per money earned (seJ/$) is also used. Indirect labor required to make and supply the inputs to a process is generally measured with the dollar cost of services, so that its emergy intensity is calculated as seJ/$.

:'''''Empower''''' — a flow of emergy (i.e., emergy per unit time)''.''

==Accounting method==

Emergy accounting converts the thermodynamic basis of all forms of energy, resources and human services into equivalents of a single form of energy, usually solar. To evaluate a system, a system diagram organizes the evaluation and account for energy inputs and outflows. A table of the flows of resources, labor and energy is constructed from the diagram and all flows are evaluated. The final step involves interpreting the results.&lt;ref name=EnvAcct /&gt;

===Purpose===

In some cases, an evaluation is done to determine the fit of a development proposal within its environment. It also allows comparison of alternatives. Another purpose is to seek the best use of resources to maximize economic vitality.

===Systems diagram===

[[File:Systems diagram of a city.png|thumb|alt=A systems diagram of a city embedded in its support region showing the environmental energy and non renewable energy sources that drive the region and city system|'''Figure 1''': Energy system diagram of a city in its support region]]
System diagrams show the inputs that are evaluated and summed to obtain the emergy of a flow. A diagram of a city and its regional support area is shown in Figure 1.&lt;ref&gt;Many example diagrams can be found at [http://emergysystems.org/symbols.php EmergySystems.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309041649/http://www.emergysystems.org/symbols.php |date=2010-03-09 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evaluation table===

A table (see example below) of resource flows, labor and energy is constructed from the diagram. Raw data on inflows that cross the boundary are converted into emergy units, and then summed to obtain total emergy supporting the system. Energy flows per unit time (usually per year) are presented in the table as separate line items.

* Column #1 is the line item number, which is also the number of the footnote found below the table where raw data sources are cited and calculations are shown.
*Column # 2 is the name of the item, which is also shown on the aggregated diagram.
*Column # 3 is the raw data in joules, grams, dollars or other units.
*Column # 4 shows the units for each raw data item.
*Column # 5 is the unit emergy value, expressed in solar emergy joules per unit. Sometimes, inputs are expressed in grams, hours, or dollars, therefore an appropriate UEV is used (sej/hr; sej/g; sej/$).
*Column # 6 is the solar emergy of a given flow, calculated as the raw input times the UEV (Column 3 times Column 5).

All tables are followed by footnotes that show citations for data and calculations.

===Calculating unit values===

The table allows a unit emergy value to be calculated. The final, output row (row “O” in the example table above) is evaluated first in units of energy or mass. Then the input emergy is summed and the unit emergy value is calculated by dividing the emergy by the units of the output.

===Performance indicators===

[[File:EmergyRatios5.png|thumb|alt=a basic diagram showing an economic progress that draws resources from the environment that are both renewable and non renewable energies and feedbacks from the main economy.|'''Figure 2''': Systems diagram showing flows used in the performance indicator ratios]]
Figure 2 shows non-renewable environmental contributions (N) as an emergy storage of materials, renewable environmental inputs (R), and inputs from the economy as purchased (F) goods and services. Purchased inputs are needed for the process to take place and include human service and purchased non-renewable energy and material brought in from elsewhere (fuels, minerals, electricity, machinery, fertilizer, etc.). Several ratios, or indices are given in Figure 2 that assess the global performance of a process.
* '''Emergy Yield Ratio (EYR) —''' Emergy released (used up) per unit invested. The ratio is a measure of how much an investment enables a process to exploit local resources.
* '''Environmental Loading Ratio (ELR''') — The ratio of nonrenewable and imported emergy use to renewable emergy use. It is an indicator of the pressure a transformation process exerts on the environment and can be considered a measure of [[ecosystem]] stress due to a production (transformation activity.
* '''Emergy Sustainability Index (ESI''') — The ratio of EYR to ELR. It measures the contribution of a resource or process to the economy per unit of environmental loading.
* '''Areal Empower Intensity —''' The ratio of emergy use in the economy of a region to its area. Renewable and nonrenewable emergy density are calculated separately by dividing the total renewable emergy by area and the total nonrenewable emergy by area, respectively.

Other ratios are useful depending on the type and scale of the system under evaluation.
* '''Percent Renewable Emergy (%Ren''') — The ratio of renewable emergy to total emergy use. In the long run, only processes with high %Ren are sustainable.
* '''Emprice'''. The emprice of a commodity is the emergy one receives for the money spent in sej/$.
* '''Emergy Exchange Ratio (EER''') — The ratio of emergy exchanged in a trade or purchase (what is received to what is given). The ratio is always expressed relative to a trading partner and is a measure of the relative trade advantage of one partner over the other.
* '''Emergy per capita —''' The ratio of emergy use of a region or nation to the population. Emergy per capita can be used as a measure of potential, average standard of living of the population.
* '''Emergy-based energy return on investment''' was introduced as a way to bridge and improve the concept of [[Energy returned on energy invested]] to also include environmental impacts.&lt;ref name="Chen"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Y.|last2=Feng|first2=L.|last3=Wang|first3=J.|last4=Höök|first4=M|title=Emergy-based energy return on investment method for evaluating energy exploitation|journal=Energy|date=2017|volume=128|issue=6|pages=540–549|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2017.04.058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

The recognition of the relevance of energy to the growth and dynamics of [[complex systems]] has resulted in increased emphasis on  environmental evaluation methods that can account for and interpret the effects of matter and energy flows at all scales in systems of humanity and nature. The following table lists some general areas in which the emergy methodology has been employed.

Net-Energy Analysis and the Energy Requirements of Energy Systems. Praeger Publishers, New York, 289 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Emergy theory has been criticized for allegedly offering an energy theory of value to replace other [[Labor theory of value|theories of value]].{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}} The stated goal of emergy evaluations is to provide an "ecocentric" valuation of systems, processes. Thus it does not purport to replace economic values but to provide additional information, from a different point of view.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The idea that a [[calorie]] of sunlight is not equivalent to a calorie of fossil fuel or electricity strikes many as absurd, based on the [[Newton's laws of motion|1st Law]] definition of energy units as measures of heat (i.e. Joule's [[mechanical equivalent of heat]]).&lt;ref&gt;Sciubba, E., 2010. On the Second-Law inconsistency of Emergy Analysis. Energy 35, 3696-3706.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have rejected the concept as impractical since from their perspective it is impossible to objectively quantify the amount of sunlight that is required to produce a quantity of oil. In combining systems of humanity and nature and evaluating environmental input to economies, mainstream economists criticize the emergy methodology for disregarding market values.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}

'''IISD Experimental Lakes Area''' ('''IISD-ELA''', known as '''ELA''' before 2014)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iisd.org/ela/|title=Home - IISD Experimental Lakes Area|website=IISD Experimental Lakes Area|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an internationally unique research station encompassing 58 formerly pristine freshwater lakes in [[Kenora District]] [[Ontario]], [[Canada]].{{Sfn|Stokstad|2008}}{{Sfn|Paris|2012}} Previously run by [[Fisheries and Oceans Canada]], after being de-funded by the Canadian Federal Government, the facility is now managed and operated by the [[International Institute for Sustainable Development]] (IISD) and has a mandate to investigate the aquatic effects of a wide variety of stresses on lakes and their catchments. IISD-ELA uses the whole [[ecosystem approach]] and makes long-term, whole-lake investigations of freshwater focusing on [[eutrophication]].{{Sfn|Schindler|2009a}}{{Sfn|Schindler|Vallentyne|2008|page=x}}

In an article{{Sfn|Stokstad|2008}} published in [[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]]'s well-known scientific journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]],'' Eric Stokstad described ELA's "extreme science"{{Sfn|Stokstad|2008}} as the manipulation of whole [[lake ecosystem]] with ELA researchers collecting long-term records for [[climatology]], [[hydrology]], and [[limnology]] that address key issues in water management.{{Sfn|Schindler|2009a}} The site has influenced public policy in water management in Canada, the USA, and around the world.{{Sfn|Stokstad|2008}}

Minister of State for Science and Technology, [[Gary Goodyear]], argued that "our government has been working hard to ensure that the Experimental Lakes Area facility is transferred to a non-governmental operator better suited to conducting the type of world-class research that can be undertaken at this facility" and that "[t]he federal government has been leading negotiations in order to secure an operator with an international track record." On April 1, 2014, the [[International Institute for Sustainable Development]] announced that it had signed three agreements to ensure that it will be the long-term operator of the research facility and that the facility would henceforth be called IISD Experimental Lakes Area.{{Sfn|IISD|2014}} Since taking over the facility, IISD has expanded the function of the site to include educational and outreach opportunities&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iisd.org/ela/education-and-outreach/|title=Education &amp; Outreach - IISD Experimental Lakes Area|work=IISD Experimental Lakes Area|access-date=2017-07-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a broader research portfolio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iisd.org/ela/science-data/research/|title=Research - IISD Experimental Lakes Area|work=IISD Experimental Lakes Area|access-date=2017-07-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

In 1968, the Province of Ontario and the Government of Canada set aside an area in a sparsely inhabited region of central Canada, southeast of [[Kenora]], Ontario, which is relatively unaffected by external human influences and industrial activities, for experimental studies of the causes and control of [[eutrophication]] and other types of water pollution. It included 46{{Sfn|Johnson|Vallentyne|1971}} small, deep, pristine lakes and their catchment areas in the [[Precambrian Shield]].{{Sfn|Vallentyne|2000}}

The ELA project originated as a Canadian governmental response to the [[International Joint Commission]] (IJC)'s recommendation (1965) to Canada and the United States for additional support for studies on transboundary pollution in the lower Great Lakes.{{Sfn|Vallentyne|2000}}{{Sfn|Podemski|nd}}

In the 1960s, there was a widespread concern about the consequences of eutrophication but there was a lack of solid scientific evidence. Dr. W. E. Johnson of the [[Freshwater Institute]] of Winnipeg (Manitoba, Canada) convinced the Canadian government that unimpeachable evidence could be obtained by experimental pollution of pristine lakes through controlled overfertilization of specified elements.{{Sfn|Schindler|Vallentyne|2008|pages=155-6}} The Experimental Lakes Area was established in 1968 by the Fisheries Research Board of Canada. Dr. John Reubec Vallentyne and Dr. W. E. Johnson of the Freshwater Institute created the Experimental Lakes Area (ELA). While Vallentyne was Scientific Leader of the Eutrophication Section from 1966 to 1972, he attracted a stellar staff of scientists from around the world in the late 1960s and early 1970s.{{Sfn|Planas|2008}} He recruited a junior scientist, [[David W. Schindler]]. Schindler, who would become one of the world's leading [[limnology|limnologists]], would direct ELA projects from 1968 to 1989.{{Sfn|Zagorski|2006}}{{Sfn|Alberta Order of Excellence|nd}}{{Sfn|McGill University Water|2010}}{{Sfn|Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI)|nd}}{{Sfn|Trent University|2008}}{{Sfn|University of Alberta|nd}}{{Sfn|ELA|nd}}

== Contributions to hydrology ==

In 1969, the fertilization experiment began with Lake 227, and in 1973, the double-basin eutrophication experiment on Lake 226 began, in which a section of the Lake 226S was overfertilized with carbon and nitrogen and the other section 226N with carbon and nitrogen as well as phosphorus.{{Sfn|Schindler|1974}} The iconic image of the green eutrophied section 226N has been described as the most important in the history of limnology. It convinced the public and policy-makers that phosphorus levels needed to be controlled.

"Work at the ELA has produced important evidence on the effects of acid rain and led to the discovery that phosphates from household detergents cause algal blooms. It has elucidated the impacts on fish of mercury and shown how wetland flooding for hydroelectricity leads to increased production of greenhouse gases."{{Sfn|Nature|2012}}

In the years leading up to the 2001 Gerhard Herzberg Gold Medal for Science and Engineering award, Schindler's research "demonstrated the cumulative impacts on boreal lake life of global warming, acidification and ozone depletion. Using long-term reference data collected at the ELA, he has shown that climate warming and drought have severe and previously unrecognized effects on the physics, chemistry, and biology of lakes."{{Sfn|NSERC|2001}}

ELA has produced 745 peer-reviewed scientific articles, 126 graduate theses, 102 book chapters and synthesis papers, 185 data reports, and several books. ELA scientists have been the recipients of numerous prestigious international water awards, including the [[Stockholm Water Prize]], the [[Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement]]{{Sfn|Tyler|2006}} and the Gerhard Herzberg Gold Medal for Science and Engineering.{{Sfn|NSERC|2001}}{{Sfn|Orihel|2012}}{{Sfn|Orihel|2012a}}

According to John Shearer, who worked at the ELA as Senior Biologist and Operations Manager, from 1969 until his retirement 2007, 47 PhD candidates completed dissertations and 80 master’s students completed theses, using research they participated in at the ELA.{{Sfn|Shearer|2012}}
[[File:Image of Lake 239 at IISD Experimental Lakes Area from above.jpg|alt=Lake 239 at IISD Experimental Lakes Area from above|thumb|Lake 239 at IISD Experimental Lakes Area from above]]
Hundreds of peer-reviewed articles have been based on ELA research in journals such as ''Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry'', ''Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences'', ''Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics (ACP)'', ''Transactions of the American Fisheries Society'', ''Hydrological Processes'', ''Limnology and Oceanography'', ''Environmental Science and Technology'', including at least 184 in the ''Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences'' and 30 in ''Biogeochemistry''.{{Sfn|Experimental Lakes Area|nd}}

== Controversy about defunding ==

=== Bill C-38 Jobs, Growth and Long-term Prosperity Act cutbacks to science ===

The [[Bill C-38 Jobs, Growth and Long-term Prosperity Act]]{{Sfn|Government of Canada|2012}}{{Sfn|Government of Canada|2012a}}{{Sfn|Government of Canada|2012b}}{{Sfn|Government of Canada|2012}}(informally referred to as '''Bill C-38''') is an Act of the [[Parliament of Canada]], an [[omnibus bill]] passed as a 2012 Budget Implementation Act in June 2012.

=== Fisheries Act ===

Bill C-38 amended the [[Fisheries Act]] and closed the Experimental Lakes Area.{{Sfn|Save Experimental Lakes Area|2012}}{{Sfn|HuffPost Politics|2012}} Bill C-38 was given Royal Assent on June 29, 2012.{{Sfn|Government of Canada|2012d}}

In 2012, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans announced that it planned to discontinue supporting the site at the end of the financial year, March 31, 2013, at a cost of $50 million.{{Sfn|CBC|2012a}} The site would be either decommissioned or handed to a third-party operator.{{Sfn|De Souza|2013}}{{Sfn|Galloway|2013a}}

Senator [[Jim Cowan]]{{Sfn|Jim Cowan|2012}} at the 1st Session, 41st Parliament (June 21, 2012) expressed his concerns. "There are a number of proposed changes to the [[Fisheries Act]] that are causing deep concern among Canadians. The bill amends the act to limit fish protection to the support of "commercial, recreational and Aboriginal fisheries." Protection of fish habitat is relegated to a vastly lower priority — something that caused those four former fisheries ministers, in their words, "especial alarm."{{Sfn|Cowan|2012}} Cowan also expressed dismay at the closure of Experimental Lakes Area.

{{quote|Bill C-38 eliminates $2 million in annual funding to the Experimental Lakes Area in northwestern Ontario. This research centre will close within a year if a new operator cannot be found. John Smol, a biologist at Queen’s University, has said that the Experimental Lakes Area is the best-known freshwater research facility on the planet. The planned closure of the centre was the subject of an article on May 21 in ''Nature'' magazine.|Senator Cowan 2012}}

According to Elizabeth May,{{Sfn|Green Party of Canada|2012}}
{{quote|Fish habitat provisions will be changed to protect only fish of "commercial, Aboriginal, and recreational" value and even those habitat protections are weakened. The new provisions create an incentive to drain a lake and kill all the fish, if not in a fishery, in order to fill a dry hole with mining tailings.|Elizabeth May 2012}}

=== DFO dismantling ELA cabins ===

In March 2013, with no advance notification to scientists whose personal belongings remained at the site or to the IISD, Department of Fisheries and Oceans began dismantling cabins that had been used by the Experimental Lakes Project scientists.{{Sfn|Galloway|2013a}} Scientist Roberto Quinlan of the Society of Canadian Limnologists said that this move "brings into serious doubt the government’s sincerity to actually transfer the facility over to another operator."{{Sfn|Galloway|2013a}}

=== Defunding widely condemned by scientific community ===

The decision to abruptly defund the ELA was widely condemned by the Canadian and international scientific community. The scientific journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 2012, described the decision as "disturbing", and said that it "is hard to believe that finance is the true reason" for the closure.{{Sfn|Nature|2012}} An open letter from five prominent scientific organizations, the [[Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography]], the [[Ecological Society of America]], the [[International Society of Limnology]], the Society of Canadian Limnologists, and the Society for Freshwater Sciences, expressed concern over the impact that a closure would have "on the strong and creative science that has been, and continues to be, conducted by Canadian freshwater researchers."{{Sfn|CASS|2013}}&lt;ref&gt;CASS is supported by the [[Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography]] (ASLO), the Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation (CERF), the Society for Freshwater Science (SFS), and the Society of Wetland Scientists (SWS).&lt;/ref&gt; An organization of Canadian citizens and scientists, the Coalition to Save ELA{{Sfn|Orihel|2012}} has been formed to pressure the Canadian government to reverse the decision to close the Experimental Lakes Area.

The planned closure of the centre was the subject of an article 21 May 2012 in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' journal.{{Sfn|Hoag|2012}}{{Sfn|Save Experimental Lakes Area|2012}}

On 25 May 2012 The [[North American Lake Management Society]] (NALMS), representing nearly 1,000 members-researchers, scientists, administrators, and citizens-wrote a letter of concern the imminent closure of ELA, arguing that NALMS' work "depends on findings from the ELA."{{Sfn|2012|Sosiak}} NALMS asked the federal government to reconsider. "The Experimental Lakes Area (ELA) is a rare resource not only in Canada but throughout the world, as a dedicated research facility for ecosystem-scale experimental investigations and long-term monitoring of ecosystem processes. Operating for more than 40 years, it continues to study physical, chemical and biological processes and interactions operating on an ecosystem spatial scale and a multi-year time frame. These have led to extremely important discoveries. As an example, the world’s fertilizer industry now recognizes the importance of phosphorus in lakes and reservoirs, 40 years after its importance was demonstrated at ELA. Regulatory actions have been supported by ELA research, and now there is action by the industry as a result of research and activities at ELA over several decades. The experience gained at ELA by many scientists has resulted in the dissemination of environmental expertise and problem solving throughout the world, improving human conditions, protecting the environment, and saving millions of dollars for citizens and government agencies. Furthermore, we consider the work now in progress at ELA very important to the future of lake and reservoir management."{{Sfn|2012|Sosiak}}

=== Response from opposition parties and Senators ===

Many Canadian MPs called on the Harper Government to reverse its decision on the forced closure of the Experimental Lakes Project.{{Sfn|Government of Canada|2012e}} NDP MP [[Philip Toone]] argued that the "internationally recognized program with huge spin-offs for Canada will cost more to close and move than the $2 million that the government hopes to save."{{Sfn|Government of Canada|2012e}}
&lt;ref&gt;In November 2012 Toone argued that "this cutback was one of a series of budget cuts and layoffs in fields relating to research and science at the [[Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada]]. For instance, the ocean pollution monitoring program with its 75 scientist positions was eliminated; scientist positions the [[Maurice Lamontagne Institute]] related to the program that studies the effect of contaminants on water and aquatic life were eliminated; [[Fisheries Resource Conservation Council]] (FRCC) a science-based council which protected the viability of fish stocks over the long term and assessed the total allowable catches every year, was closed."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International Institute for Sustainable Development ===

The federal government led negotiations with the Ontario government, the Manitoba government and the [[International Institute for Sustainable Development]] (IISD), headquartered in Winnipeg, to keep the area operational in 2013 and ensure longer-term operations.{{Sfn|Babbage|2013}} IISD is funded by the UN, governments including the Canadian government, international organizations and philanthropic foundations. It also gets money from universities and private-sector companies including [[TransCanada Energy]], [[Enbridge]] and [[Manitoba Hydro]].{{Sfn|Galloway|2012}} On April 1, 2014, IISD announced that three agreements have been signed involving IISD, the [[Government of Ontario]] and the [[Fisheries and Oceans Canada|Government of Canada]] that together ensure the long-term operation of the Experimental Lakes Area (ELA) research facility.{{Sfn|IISD|2014}}

Ontario Premier [[Kathleen Wynne]] has committed support to keep the ELA "operating in the long term after the federal Conservative government walks away from the world-class freshwater research station at the end of August 2013."{{Sfn|Galloway|2013}}

Dr. John Rudd, former DFO Research Scientist (1977-2002), ELA Chief Scientist (1998-2002), and winner of DFO’s most prestigious award, the Deputy Minister’s Prix d’Excellence (2002) argued that "IISD is not qualified on a scientific basis to run ELA... ELA is a unique facility and its scientific research needs to be directed by scientists who know how to do these experiments, but unfortunately, almost all present and recently retired scientists have been cut out of the transfer process."{{Sfn|Orihel|2012a}}{{Sfn|Orihel|2012}}

Elizabeth May, who served on the board of the International Institute for Sustainable Development for nine years prior to entering politics, argues that the "IISD, a think tank, is not necessarily the right organization to take on this mandate. However, keeping the ELA open and functioning, and in a public and transparent context, was paramount."{{Sfn|May|2013}}

== Silence of the Labs ==

In a January 2014 episode of CBC's [[The Fifth Estate (TV)|The Fifth Estate]], investigative reporter Linden MacIntyre examined the climate for scientists in Canada. He included a section on the closure of the ELA, and interviewed Dr. Schindler who continued to work on his area of concern for many years, the state of hydrology in the oil sands region.{{Sfn|MacIntyre|2014}}

== IISD-ELA today ==
Since IISD took over the site in 2014, it has been called IISD Experimental Lakes Area (IISD-ELA). IISD-ELA has continued to carry out its whole-lake experimentation, but has also expanded its research portfolio to include research on nanosilver,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iisd.org/ela/research/current-projects/nanosilver|title=Nanosilver - IISD Experimental Lakes Area|date=2016-04-02|work=IISD Experimental Lakes Area|access-date=2017-07-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[microplastics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lakeheadu.ca/about/news-and-events/news/archive/2017/node/42119|title=Study finds Lake Winnipeg plastics greater than or comparable to Great Lakes {{!}} Lakehead University|website=Lakehead University|language=en|access-date=2017-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; climate change&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iisd.org/ela/research/current-projects/climate-change/|title=The Lake 626 Diversion Project - IISD Experimental Lakes Area|date=2016-04-02|work=IISD Experimental Lakes Area|access-date=2017-07-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more.

'''Geoscience e-Journals''' is an academic portal that includes 54 [[open access]] [[electronic journal]]s, all dealing with [[geosciences]]. Most journals grouped under this aegis give a free and full access to their contents (except for one journal that has an embargo period). Some are electronic only, others are also available in paper-printed versions or in CD or DVD versions.

==History==
Geoscience e-Journals was originally a [[web ring]] launched on March 27, 2003 by [[Bruno Granier]]; it was converted into a [[web portal|portal]] on April 15, 2006. This facility was made possible through joint efforts of [[RedIRIS]] and the [[Université de Bretagne Occidentale]].

This '''glossary of botanical terms''' is a list of terms relevant to [[botany]] and [[plant]]s in general. Terms of [[plant morphology]] are included here as well as at the related [[Glossary of plant morphology]] and [[Glossary of leaf morphology]]. See also [[List of Latin and Greek words commonly used in systematic names]]. You can help by adding illustrations that assist an understanding of the terms.

'''Hydropower''' or '''water power''' (from  {{lang-el|ύδωρ}}, "water") is [[power (physics)|power]] derived from the [[energy]] of falling water or fast running water, which may be harnessed for useful purposes. Since ancient times, hydropower from many kinds of [[watermill]]s has been used as a [[renewable energy]] source for [[irrigation]] and the operation of various mechanical devices, such as [[gristmill]]s, [[sawmill]]s, [[textile]] mills, [[trip hammer]]s, dock [[crane (machine)|cranes]], domestic [[elevator|lifts]], and [[ore]] mills. A [[trompe]], which produces compressed air from falling water, is sometimes used to power other machinery at a distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://energy.gov/eere/water/history-hydropower|title=History of Hydropower {{!}} Department of Energy|website=energy.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.niagarafrontier.com/power.html|title=Niagara Falls History of Power|website=www.niagarafrontier.com|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, hydropower became a source for generating [[electricity]]. [[Cragside]] in Northumberland was the first house powered by hydroelectricity in 1878&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/cragside/|title=Cragside Visitor Information|publisher=The National Trust|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first commercial hydroelectric power plant was built at [[Niagara Falls]] in 1879. In 1881, street lamps in the city of Niagara Falls were powered by hydropower.

Since the early 20th century, the term has been used almost exclusively in conjunction with the modern development of [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power]].  International institutions such as the [[World Bank]] view hydropower as a means for [[economic development]] without adding substantial amounts of carbon to the atmosphere,&lt;ref name=WP5813&gt;{{cite news|title=World Bank turns to hydropower to square development with climate change|url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-05-08/business/39105348_1_jim-yong-kim-world-bank-hydropower|accessdate=9 May 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=8 May 2013|author=Howard Schneider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

[[File: WATER-POWERED ORE MILL, TAKEN FROM SOUTH - Liberty Historic District, Water Powered Ore Mill, Route 2, Cle Elum, Liberty, Kittitas County, WA HABS WASH,19-LIB,1W-1.tif|thumb|Directly water-powered ore mill, late nineteenth century]]

In [[History of India|India]], [[water wheel]]s and [[watermill]]s were built, possibly as early as the 4th century BC, although records of that era are spotty at best.&lt;ref&gt;Terry S. Reynolds, ''Stronger than a Hundred Men: A History of the Vertical Water Wheel'', JHU Press, 2002 {{ISBN|0801872480}}, page 14&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Roman Empire]], water-powered mills produced flour from grain, and were also used for sawing timber and stone; in China, watermills were widely used since the [[Han dynasty]].  In [[China]] and the rest of the Far East, hydraulically operated "pot wheel" pumps raised water into crop or irrigation canals.{{when|date=August 2015}}

The power of a wave of water released from a tank was used for extraction of metal ores in a method known as [[hushing]]. The method was first used at the [[Dolaucothi Gold Mines]] in [[Wales]] from 75 AD onwards, but had been developed in [[Spain]] at such mines as [[Las Médulas]]. Hushing was also widely used in [[Great Britain|Britain]] in the [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] and later periods to extract [[lead]] and [[tin]] ores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hunt|first1=Robert|title=British Mining: A Treatise in the History, Discovery, Practical Development, and Future Prospects of Metalliferous Mines of the United Kingdom|date=1887|publisher=Crosby Lockwood and Co|location=London|page=505|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MQU55QQHRGcC&amp;pg=PA505&amp;lpg=PA505#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It later evolved into [[hydraulic mining]] when used during the [[California Gold Rush]].

In the [[Middle Ages]], Islamic mechanical engineer [[Al-Jazari]] described designs for 50 devices, many of them water powered, in his book, ''The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices'', including clocks, a device to serve wine, and five devices to lift water from rivers or pools, though three are animal-powered and one can be powered by animal or water. These include [[Scoop wheel|an endless belt with jugs attached]], a cow-powered [[shadoof]], and a reciprocating device with hinged valves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Al-Hassani|first1=Salim|title=800 Years Later: In Memory of Al-Jazari, A Genius Mechanical Engineer|url=http://muslimheritage.com/article/800-years-later-memory-al-jazari-genius-mechanical-engineer|website=Muslim Heritage|publisher=The Foundation for Science, Technology, and Civilisation|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better ref needed|date=November 2015}}

In 1753, French engineer [[Bernard Forest de Bélidor]] published ''Architecture Hydraulique'' which described vertical- and horizontal-axis hydraulic machines. By the late nineteenth century, the [[electric generator]] was developed by a team led by [[project managers]] and prominent pioneers of renewable energy [[Jacob S. Gibbs]] and [[Brinsley Coleberd]] and could now be coupled with hydraulics.&lt;ref name="doehis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/windandhydro/hydro_history.html |title=History of Hydropower |publisher=US Department of Energy |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126001540/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/windandhydro/hydro_history.html |archivedate=26 January 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The growing demand for the [[Industrial Revolution]] would drive development as well.&lt;ref name="watenc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hydroelectric Power|url=http://www.waterencyclopedia.com/Ge-Hy/Hydroelectric-Power.html|publisher=Water Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in Britain, water was the main source of power for new inventions such as [[Richard Arkwright]]'s [[water frame]].&lt;ref name="kreis"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/lecture17a.html|title=The Origins of the Industrial Revolution in England|last=Kreis|first=Steven|year=2001|work=The history guide|accessdate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the use of water power gave way to steam power in many of the larger mills and factories, it was still used during the 18th and 19th centuries for many smaller operations, such as driving the bellows in small [[blast furnace]]s (e.g. the [[Dyfi Furnace]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/mid/sites/history/pages/dyfifurnace.shtml|title=Dyfi Furnace|last=Gwynn|first=Osian|work=BBC Mid Wales History|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[gristmill]]s, such as those built at [[Saint Anthony Falls]], which uses the 50-foot (15&amp;nbsp;m) drop in the [[Mississippi River]].

In the 1830s, at the early peak in the US [[canal]]-building, hydropower provided the energy to transport [[barge]] traffic up and down steep hills using [[Cable railway|inclined plane railroads]].  As railroads overtook canals for transportation, canal systems were modified and developed into hydropower systems; the [[history of Lowell, Massachusetts]] is a classic example of commercial development and industrialization, built upon the availability of water power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.uml.edu/clh/Malone/notes_01.pdf|title=Waterpower in Lowell|publisher=University of Massachusetts|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technological advances had moved the open water wheel into an enclosed [[turbine]] or [[Water engine|water motor]]. In 1848 [[James B. Francis]], while working as head engineer of Lowell's Locks and Canals company, improved on these designs to create a turbine with 90% efficiency.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} He applied scientific principles and testing methods to the problem of turbine design. His mathematical and graphical calculation methods allowed the confident design of high-efficiency turbines to exactly match a site's specific flow conditions.  The [[Francis turbine|Francis reaction turbine]] is still in wide use today. In the 1870s, deriving from uses in the California mining industry, [[Lester Allan Pelton]] developed the high efficiency [[Pelton wheel|Pelton wheel impulse turbine]], which utilized hydropower from the high head streams characteristic of the mountainous California interior.

=== Hydraulic power-pipe networks ===
[[Hydraulic power network]]s used pipes to carry pressurized water and transmit mechanical power from the source to end users. The power source was normally a head of water, which could also be assisted by a pump. These were extensive in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] cities in the United Kingdom. A hydraulic power network was also developed in [[Geneva]], Switzerland. The world-famous [[Jet d'Eau]] was originally designed as the over-pressure relief valve for the network.&lt;ref name=geneva&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geneve-tourisme.ch/?rubrique=0000000172|title=Things to do in Geneva, Switzerland - Geneva Tourism Official Website|website=www.geneve-tourisme.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Compressed air hydro ===
{{See also|Trompe}}
Where there is a plentiful head of water it can be made to generate [[compressed air]] directly without moving parts. In these designs, a falling column of water is purposely mixed with air bubbles generated through turbulence or a venturi pressure reducer at the high-level intake. This is allowed to fall down a shaft into a subterranean, high-roofed chamber where the now-compressed air separates from the water and becomes trapped. The height of the falling water column maintains compression of the air in the top of the chamber, while an outlet, submerged below the water level in the chamber allows water to flow back to the surface at a lower level than the intake. A separate outlet in the roof of the chamber supplies the compressed air. A facility on this principle was built on the [[Montreal River (Timiskaming District)|Montreal River]] at Ragged Shutes near [[Cobalt, Ontario]] in 1910 and supplied 5,000 horsepower to nearby mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maynard|first=Frank|date=November 1910|title=Five thousand horsepower from air bubbles|journal=Popular Mechanics|pages=633|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-N0DAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hydropower types ==
{{Main article|Hydroelectricity}}
Hydropower is used primarily to generate [[electricity]]. Broad categories include:
* [[Hydroelectricity#Generating methods|Conventional hydroelectric]], referring to hydroelectric dams.
* [[Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity]], which captures the kinetic energy in rivers or streams, without a large reservoir and sometimes without the use of dams.
* [[Small hydro]] projects are 10 megawatts or less and often have no artificial reservoirs.
* [[Micro hydro]] projects provide a few kilowatts to a few hundred kilowatts to isolated homes, villages, or small industries.
* [[Conduit hydroelectricity]] projects utilize water which has already been diverted for use elsewhere; in a municipal water system, for example.
* [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity]] stores water pumped uphill into reservoirs during periods of low demand to be released for generation when demand is high or system generation is low.
* [[Tidal stream generator|Off-shore Hydropower]] using energy from [[tidal power]] generated from oceans, rivers, and human-made canal systems to generating electricity&lt;ref&gt;http://www.british-hydro.org/tidal-range-off-shore/&lt;/ref&gt;.
* [[Pressure buffering hydropower]] use natural sources (waves for example) for water pumping to turbines while exceeding water is pumped uphill into reservoirs and releases when incoming water flow isn't enough.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Calculating the amount of available power ==
A hydropower resource can be evaluated by its available [[Power (physics)|power]]. Power is a function of the [[hydraulic head]] and [[rate of fluid flow]]. The head is the energy per unit weight (or unit mass) of water. The static head is proportional to the difference in height through which the water falls. Dynamic head is related to the velocity of moving water. Each unit of water can do an amount of work equal to its weight times the head.

The power available from falling water can be calculated from the flow rate and density of water, the height of fall, and the local acceleration due to gravity.
In SI units, the power is:

&lt;math&gt;P=\eta\rho\,Qgh\!&lt;/math&gt;

where
* P is power in watts
* η is the dimensionless efficiency of the turbine
* ρ is the density of water in kilograms per cubic metre
* Q is the flow in cubic metres per second
* g is the acceleration due to gravity
* h is the height difference between inlet and outlet in metres

To illustrate, power is calculated for a turbine that is 85% efficient, with water at 1000&amp;nbsp;kg/cubic metre (62.5 pounds/cubic foot) and a flow rate of 80 cubic-meters/second (2800 cubic-feet/second), gravity of 9.81 metres per second squared and with a net head of 145&amp;nbsp;m (480&amp;nbsp;ft).

In SI units:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Power (W)}  = 0.85\times 1000 \times 80 \times 9.81 \times 145 &lt;/math&gt; which gives 97 MW

In English units, the density is given in pounds per cubic foot so acceleration due to gravity is inherent in the unit of weight. A conversion factor is required to change from foot lbs/second to kilowatts:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Power (W)} = 0.85\times 62.5 \times 2800 \times 480 \times 1.356 &lt;/math&gt; which gives 97 MW (130,000 [[horsepower]])

Operators of hydroelectric stations will compare the total electrical energy produced with the theoretical potential energy of the water passing through the turbine to calculate efficiency. Procedures and definitions for calculation of efficiency are given in test codes such as [[ASME]] PTC 18 and [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 60041. Field testing of turbines is used to validate the manufacturer's guaranteed efficiency. Detailed calculation of the efficiency of a hydropower turbine will account for the head lost due to flow friction in the power canal or penstock, rise in tail water level due to flow, the location of the station and effect of varying gravity, the temperature and barometric pressure of the air, the density of the water at ambient temperature, and the altitudes above sea level of the forebay and tailbay. For precise calculations, errors due to rounding and the number of [[significant digit]]s of constants must be considered.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Some hydropower systems such as [[water wheel]]s can draw power from the flow of a body of water without necessarily changing its height. In this case, the available power is the [[kinetic energy]] of the flowing water. Over-shot water wheels can efficiently capture both types of energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=S. K.|first1=Sahdev|title=Basic Electrical Engineering|publisher=Pearson Education India|isbn=9789332576797|page=418|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The water flow in a stream can vary widely from season to season. Development of a hydropower site requires analysis of [[streamflow|flow records]], sometimes spanning decades, to assess the reliable annual energy supply. Dams and reservoirs provide a more dependable source of power by smoothing seasonal changes in water flow. However reservoirs have significant [[Environmental impact of reservoirs|environmental impact]], as does alteration of naturally occurring stream flow. The design of dams must also account for the worst-case, "probable maximum flood" that can be expected at the site; a [[spillway]] is often included to bypass flood flows around the dam. A computer [[Hydrological modelling|model of the hydraulic basin]] and rainfall and snowfall records are used to predict the maximum flood.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

== Sustainability ==
{{see also|Environmental impact of reservoirs}}
As with other forms of economic activity, hydropower projects can have both a positive and a negative environmental and social impact, because the construction of a dam and power plant, along with the impounding of a reservoir, creates certain social and physical changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Allure and Perils of Hydropower |url = https://undark.org/article/hydropower-dams-albania-vjosa/|website = www.undark.org|accessdate = 2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;These environmental and social impact are not limited to but include the removal of communities near the dam, as well as the hindrance of fish migration. Since water is being taken away, this also affects local communities access and amount of drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;https://scholarworks.uvm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1013&amp;context=envstheses&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence that dams affect the soil, which then alters the ability of vegetation to grow.&lt;ref&gt;https://search-proquest-com.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/earthatmosphericaquatic/docview/761185281/fulltext/A0F81B52C7504484PQ/13?accountid=14784&lt;/ref&gt;
Hydropower projects can also have indirect consequences, contributing to [[global warming]]: reservoirs accumulate plant material, which then decomposes, emitting [[methane]] in uneven bursts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/09/hundreds-new-dams-could-mean-trouble-our-climate |title=Hundreds of new dams could mean trouble for our climate|work=Science |date=September 28, 2016|accessdate= 2016-10-11 |doi=10.1126/science.aah7356|publisher=AAAS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/50/9/766/269391|title=Reservoir Surfaces as Sources of Greenhouse Gases to the Atmosphere: A Global Estimate: Reservoirs are sources of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, and their surface areas have increased to the point where they should be included in global inventories of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases|first1=St|last1=Louis|first2=Vincent|last2=L|first3=Carol A.|last3=Kelly|first4=Éric|last4=Duchemin|first5=John W.

There are several tools to assess the impact of hydropower projects:

*Most new hydropower project must undergo an [[Environmental impact assessment|Environmental and Social Impact Assessment]]. This provides a base-line understanding of the pre-project conditions, estimates of potential impacts and puts in place management plans to avoid, mitigate, or compensate for impacts.

*The [[Hydropower Sustainability Assessment Protocol]] is another tool which can be used to promote and guide more sustainable hydropower projects. It is a methodology used to audit the performance of a hydropower project across more than twenty environmental, social, technical and economic topics. A Protocol assessment provides a rapid sustainability health check. It does not replace an environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA), which takes place over a much longer period of time, usually as a mandatory regulatory requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hydropower Sustainability - Home|url = http://www.hydrosustainability.org/|website = www.hydrosustainability.org|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The [[World Commission on Dams]] final report describes a framework for planning water and energy projects that is intended to protect dam-affected people and the environment, and ensure that the benefits from dams are more equitably distributed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dams and Development Project|url = http://www.unep.org/dams/WCD/|website = www.unep.org|accessdate = 2015-10-01|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20151118100259/http%3A//www.unep.org/dams/WCD/|archivedate = 18 November 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Lempisaari,_Naantali,_Finland..jpg|thumb|An ingression coast, the [[Archipelago Sea]] off [[Naantali]] ([[Finland]])]]
An '''ingression coast''' or '''depressed coast''' is a generally level [[coastline]] that is shaped by the penetration of the [[sea]] as a result of [[crust (geology)|crustal movement]]s or a rise in the [[sea level]].

Such coasts are characterised by a [[subaerial]]ly formed [[relief (geology)|relief]] that has previously experienced little deformation by [[littoral]] ([[tidal]]) processes, because the sea level, which had fallen by more than 100 metres during the [[last glacial period]], did not reach its current level until about 6,000&amp;nbsp;years ago.

Depending on the [[Geomorphology|geomorphological]] shaping of the flooded [[landform]] – e.&amp;#8239;g. [[glacial]]ly or [[fluvial]]ly formed relief – various types of ingression coast emerge, such as [[ria]]s, [[skerry]] and [[fjard]] coasts as well as [[förde]] and [[bodden]] coasts.&lt;ref&gt;Leser, Hartmut, ed.

Traditionally, an '''Islamic garden''' is a cool place of rest and reflection, and a reminder of [[Jannah|paradise]].  The [[Qur'an]] has many references to gardens, and the garden is used as an earthly analogue for the life in paradise which is promised to believers:

:''Allah has promised to the believing men and the believing women gardens, beneath which rivers flow, to abide in them, and goodly dwellings in gardens of perpetual abode; and best of all is Allah's goodly pleasure; that is the grand achievement'' (Qur'an 9.72)

There are surviving formal Islamic gardens in a wide zone extending from Spain and Morocco in the west to India in the east. Famous Islamic gardens include those of the [[Taj Mahal]] in India and the [[Generalife]] and [[Alhambra]] in Spain.

The general theme of a traditional Islamic garden is water and shade, not surprisingly since Islam came from and generally spread in a hot and arid climate.  Unlike English gardens, which are often designed for walking, Islamic gardens are intended for rest and contemplation.  For this reason, Islamic gardens usually include places for sitting.

==Types==
[[D. Fairchild Ruggles|Fairchild Ruggles]] refers to the universal nature of gardening, and the basic human needs it fulfills; the needs to cultivate, to master the wild landscape, and to bring order to it.  The spiritual aspects of gardening, according to this view, were a later development.  She further points out the classic formal garden, known as the [[Charbagh]] (or Chahar Bagh), is but one form which exists in the Islamic civilization; a civilization which has traditionally included peoples of many faiths and cultures.&lt;ref name="Ruggles, D. Fairchild 2008"&gt;[[D. Fairchild Ruggles|Ruggles, D. Fairchild]]. ''Islamic Gardens and Landscapes''. University of Pennsylvania Press, 2008, Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clifford A. Wright, an author on Mediterranean cuisine, describes different garden types for different purposes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cliffordawright.com/caw/food/entries/display.php/topic_id/29/id/53/|title=Did You Know: Food History - The Muslim Gardens of Paradise|website=www.cliffordawright.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The Muslims had different kinds of gardens serving different purposes. The bustan was the garden of the inner court of a house, a formal garden with pools and water channels. The jannah was an orchard with palms, oranges, and vines irrigated by canals. The rawdah referred in particular to the vegetable garden that produced foods for the cooks.}}

==Persian, Arabic and Byzantine influence==
After the Arab invasions of the 7th century CE, the traditional design of the [[Persian garden]] was used in the Islamic garden. [[Persian gardens]] after that time were traditionally enclosed by walls and were designed to represent [[Jannah|paradise]]; the Persian word for enclosed space is 'pairi-daeza.'   In the [[Charbagh]], or [[paradise garden]], four water canals typically carry water into a central pool or fountain, interpreted as the four rivers in paradise, filled with milk, honey, wine and water.&lt;ref name="Gardens of Islam"&gt;{{cite web|title=Islamic Arts|url=http://islamispeace.org.uk/itm.php?id_top=27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014025728/http://islamispeace.org.uk/itm.php?id_top=27|dead-url=yes|archive-date=14 October 2007|website=Islamispeace.org.uk|publisher=Islamispeace.org.uk|accessdate=2 February 2018|date=14 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yves-Marie Allain and Janine Christiany, ''L'Art des jardins en Europe,'' Citadelles &amp; Mazenod, Paris, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hellenistic]] influences are also apparent; the Western use of straight lines in the plan is blended with [[Sassanid]] ornamental plantations and fountains.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marie-Luise Gothein]], ''A History of Garden Art'', Diederichs, 1914, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surviving gardens==
Many of the gardens of Islamic civilization are lost to us today. While most others may retain their forms, the original plantings have been replaced with modern ones.&lt;ref name="Ruggles, D. Fairchild 2008"/&gt; The garden is a transient form of architectural art dependent upon the climate, and the resources available to those who care for it.

===Albania===
[[Evliya Çelebi]]'s 17th century CE [[Seyahatname]] (travel book) contains descriptions of Paradise Gardens around the towns of Berat and Elbasan, Albania. According to Dr. [[Robert Elsie]], an expert on Albanian culture, very few traces of the refined oriental culture of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] era remain here today.&lt;ref name="Elsie"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elsie|first1=Robert|title=Texts and Documents of Albanian History|url=http://www.albanianhistory.net/texts16-18/AH1670_1.html|website=Albanian History|accessdate=3 February 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705153855/http://www.albanianhistory.net/texts16-18/AH1670_1.html|archivedate=5 July 2011|quote=Extract from: Robert Dankoff and Robert Elsie (ed.): Evliya Çelebi in Albania and Adjacent Regions (Kosovo, Montenegro, Ohrid), Leiden 2000, p. 101 127, 161 193.

Elsie: Early Albania, a Reader of Historical Texts, 11th - 17th Centuries, Wiesbaden 2003, p. 195-218.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Çelebi describes the town of Berat:

{{quote|It is a huge open town, entirely outside the walls of the fortress. It is situated in a large area along the bank of the [...] river to the east and south of the upper fortress and is covered in vineyards, rose gardens and vegetable gardens. There are 5,000 one- and two-story stonework houses with red-tiled roofs. They are well built and attractive houses with gardens and are spread over seven verdant hills and valleys. Among them are over 100 splendid mansions with cisterns and fountains and an invigorating climate.&lt;ref name="Elsie"/&gt;}}

Çelebi describes the town of Elbasan:

{{quote|The open town outside the walls extends on all sides of the fortress to the foot of the hills at a distance of one hour's march. The prosperous and cheerful-looking mansions in the open town are adorned with beautiful vineyards, paradisiacal gardens and parks with their pavilions and galleries. They are two or three stories high, made of stonework and with tiled roofs. Each of them has a source of pure flowing water, a pool and a fountain with water spurting from jets. They are luxurious dwellings like those in the gardens of paradise.&lt;ref name="Elsie"/&gt;}}

===Algeria===
Dar al-Bahr, the Lake Palace, is situated on the southern end of [[Beni Hammad Fort]], a ruined fortified city which has remained uninhabited for 800 years.  Artifacts recovered from the site attest to a high degree of civilization. During its time, it was remarked upon by visitors for the nautical spectacles enacted in its large pool.  Surrounding the pool and the palace were terraces, courtyards and gardens.  Little is known of the details of these gardens, other than the lion motifs carved in their stone fountains.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles, D. Fairchild. ''Islamic Gardens and Landscapes''. University of Pennsylvania Press, 2008, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Beni Hammad Fort is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], noted as an "authentic picture of a fortified Muslim city."

===The Shalimar gardens===
The name Shalimar is thought to mean, among other things, "abode of bliss" or "light of the moon". There were originally three gardens with the name Shalimar: [[Shalimar Gardens (Lahore)|one in Lahore, Pakistan]], [[Shalimar Bagh (Srinagar)|another in Jammu Kashmir]], India and finally one, located in Delhi, which has completely disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;Sikander, Sattar. ''The Shalamar: A Typical Muslim Garden''. Environmental Design: Journal of the Islamic Environmental Design Research Centre 2, 1986, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shalimar Gardens, Lahore====
[[Shalimar Gardens (Lahore)|Shalimar Gardens, Lahore]], was built by the governor of Lahore, with funds supplied by the [[Mughal empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Shah Jahan]], beginning in 1641 CE.  The water is supplied by a canal dug from the nearby Ravi river.  Built in the [[Mughal gardens|Mughal style]], it is surrounded by high walls with towers in the corners.  The inner face of the walls have traces of frescoes done in floral patterns.  The canal passes through the gardens, which are constructed on three separate terraces at different elevations.  The garden terraces are laid out in the traditional "paradise" motif of four channels converging on a central fountain, and cover a total of forty acres.&lt;ref&gt;Sikander, Sattar. ''The Shalamar: A Typical Muslim Garden''. Environmental Design: Journal of the Islamic Environmental Design Research Centre 2, 1986, pp. 24–29.&lt;/ref&gt; [https://web.archive.org/web/20060214214014/http://archnet.org/library/pubdownloader/pdf/4883/doc/DPC0715.pdf]

===Andalusian Spain===
The garden was a common feature of homes in Arab Spain.  Andalusian designs emphasized privacy and coolness, with rooms opening onto a roofed, open corridor.  Next to this corridor, one would typically find a verdant patio garden complete with central fountain.&lt;ref&gt;Irving, T. B. ''The Falcon of Spain ''. Ashraf Press, 1962, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Al-Azhar park, Cairo===
[[Al-Azhar Park]] is a modern landmark in Cairo, Egypt. It is laid out along a central series of terraced, formal Islamic gardens.  Multicolored [[Mamluk]] stonework, fountains and [[Islamic geometric patterns]] are the predominating stylistic theme of the park.  It is listed as one of the world's sixty great public spaces by the [[Project for Public Spaces]] ([http://www.pps.org/ PPS]).&lt;ref name="PPS Sixty"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pps.org/info/gps/60places?referrer=gps_home |title=60 of the World's Great Places - Project for Public Spaces |accessdate=2006-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206002657/http://www.pps.org/info/gps/60places?referrer=gps_home |archivedate=2006-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In economics, the '''Jevons paradox''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|ɛ|v|ə|n|z}}; sometimes '''Jevons effect''') occurs when [[technological change|technological progress]] or government policy increases the [[efficiency]] with which a [[resource (economics)|resource]] is used (reducing the amount necessary for any one use), but the rate of [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] of that resource rises due to increasing [[demand (economics)|demand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bauer |first1=Diana |last2=Papp |first2=Kathryn |title=Book Review Perspectives: The Jevons Paradox and the Myth of Resource Efficiency Improvements |journal=Sustainability: Science, Practice, &amp; Policy |date=March 18, 2009 |volume=5 |issue=1 |url=http://sspp.proquest.com/static_content/vol5iss1/book.polimeni-print.html |accessdate=29 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529111127/http://sspp.proquest.com/static_content/vol5iss1/book.polimeni-print.html |archivedate=29 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jevons paradox is perhaps the most widely known paradox in [[environmental economics]].&lt;ref name="York"&gt;{{cite journal|last=York |first=Richard |title=Ecological paradoxes: William Stanley Jevons and the paperless office |journal=Human Ecology Review |year=2006 |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=143–147 |url=http://www.humanecologyreview.org/pastissues/her132/york.pdf |accessdate=2015-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, governments and [[environmentalist]]s generally assume that efficiency gains will lower [[resource consumption]], ignoring the possibility of the paradox arising.&lt;ref name=Alcott1&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2005.03.020|last=Alcott |first=Blake |title=Jevons' paradox |journal=[[Ecological Economics (journal)|Ecological Economics]] |date=July 2005 |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages=9–21 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800905001084 |accessdate=2015-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1865, the English economist [[William Stanley Jevons]] observed that technological improvements that increased the efficiency of coal-use led to the increased consumption of coal in a wide range of industries. He argued that, contrary to common intuition, technological progress could not be relied upon to reduce fuel consumption.&lt;ref name="Coal Question"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jevons |first=William Stanley |title=The Coal Question |publisher=[[Macmillan and Company]] |location=London |year=1866 |edition=2nd |chapter=VII |oclc=464772008 |url=https://books.google.com.sa/books?id=gAAKAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=editions:AAotKDT6KKcC&amp;hl=bg&amp;pg=PR3&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=2008-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alcott2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Alcott |first=Blake |title=The Jevons Paradox and the Myth of Resource Efficiency Improvements |year=2008 |publisher=Earthscan |pages=7–78 | editor=JM Polimeni |editor2=K Mayumi |editor3=M Giampietro |chapter=Historical Overview of the Jevons paradox in the Literature |isbn=1-84407-462-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue has been re-examined by modern economists studying consumption [[rebound effect (conservation)|rebound effects]] from improved [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]]. In addition to reducing the amount needed for a given use, improved efficiency also lowers the relative cost of using a resource, which increases the quantity demanded. This counteracts (to some extent) the reduction in use from improved efficiency. Additionally, improved efficiency increases real incomes and accelerates [[economic growth]], further increasing the demand for resources.  The Jevons paradox occurs when the effect from increased demand predominates, and improved efficiency increases the speed at which resources are used.&lt;ref name="Alcott2"/&gt;

Considerable debate exists about the size of the rebound in energy efficiency and the relevance of the Jevons paradox to [[energy conservation]]. Some dismiss the paradox, while others worry that it may be self-defeating to pursue [[sustainability]] by increasing energy efficiency.&lt;ref name=Alcott1/&gt; Some environmental economists have proposed that efficiency gains be coupled with conservation policies that keep the cost of use the same (or higher) to avoid the Jevons paradox.&lt;ref name="Wackernagel"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wackernagel |first=Mathis |first2=William |last2=Rees |year=1997 |title=Perceptual and structural barriers to investing in natural capital: Economics from an ecological footprint perspective |journal=Ecological Economics |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=3–24 |doi=10.1016/S0921-8009(96)00077-8  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservation policies that increase cost of use (such as [[cap and trade]] or [[green taxes]]) can be used to control the rebound effect.&lt;ref name="Energy Efficiency Policies"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freire-González|first1=Jaume|last2=Puig-Ventosa|first2=Ignasi|title=Energy Efficiency Policies and the Jevons Paradox |journal=International Journal of Energy Economics and Policy |date=2015 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=69–79 |url=https://ideas.repec.org/a/eco/journ2/2015-01-06.html |accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:PSM V11 D660 William Stanley Jevons.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1|alt=Engraving of William Stanley Jevons|[[William Stanley Jevons]], after whom the paradox is named]]

The Jevons paradox was first described by the English economist [[William Stanley Jevons]] in his 1865 book ''[[The Coal Question]]''. Jevons observed that [[England]]'s consumption of [[coal]] soared after [[James Watt]] introduced the [[Watt steam engine]], which greatly improved the efficiency of the coal-fired [[steam engine]] from [[Thomas Newcomen]]'s earlier design. Watt's innovations made coal a more cost-effective power source, leading to the increased use of the steam engine in a wide range of industries. This in turn increased total coal consumption, even as the amount of coal required for any particular application fell. Jevons argued that improvements in fuel efficiency tend to increase (rather than decrease) fuel use, writing: "It is a confusion of ideas to suppose that the economical use of fuel is equivalent to diminished consumption. The very contrary is the truth."&lt;ref name="Coal Question"/&gt;

At that time, many in Britain worried that coal reserves were rapidly dwindling, but some experts opined that improving technology would reduce coal consumption. Jevons argued that this view was incorrect, as further increases in efficiency would tend to increase the use of coal. Hence, improving technology would tend to increase the rate at which England's coal deposits were being depleted, and could not be relied upon to solve the problem.&lt;ref name="Coal Question"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alcott2"/&gt;

Although Jevons originally focused on the issue of coal, the concept has since been extended to the use of any resource, including, for example, [[water use|water usage]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dumont|first1=A.|last2=Mayor|first2=B.|last3=López-Gunn|first3=E.|title=Is the Rebound Effect or Jevons Paradox a Useful Concept for Better Management of Water Resources?

It is perhaps the most widely known paradox in [[environmental economics]].&lt;ref name="York"/&gt;

Economists have observed that consumers tend to travel more when their cars are more fuel efficient, causing a 'rebound' in the [[demand (economics)|demand]] for fuel.&lt;ref name="Small"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Small |first= Kenneth A. |author2=Kurt Van Dender |title = The Effect of Improved Fuel Economy on Vehicle Miles Traveled: Estimating the Rebound Effect Using U.S. State Data, 1966–2001 |journal=Policy and Economics | publisher=University of California Energy Institute, UC Berkeley | date = 2005-09-21 |volume= |series= |issue= |pages= |doi= |url= http://escholarship.org/uc/item/1h6141nj |accessdate=2010-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An increase in the efficiency with which a resource (e.g. fuel) is used, causes a decrease in the [[cost]] of using that resource when measured in terms of what it can achieve (e.g. travel). Generally speaking, a decrease in the cost (or price) of a [[Goods and services|good or service]] will increase the quantity demanded (the [[law of demand]]). With a lower cost for travel, consumers will travel more, increasing the demand for fuel. This increase in demand is known as the [[rebound effect (conservation)|rebound effect]], and it may or may not be large enough to offset the original drop in demand from the increased efficiency. The Jevons paradox occurs when the rebound effect is greater than 100%, exceeding the original efficiency gains.&lt;ref name="Alcott2"/&gt;

The size of the direct rebound effect is dependent on the [[price elasticity of demand]] for the good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chan|first1=Nathan W.|last2=Gillingham|first2=Kenneth|title=The Microeconomic Theory of the Rebound Effect and Its Welfare Implications|journal=Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists|date=1 March 2015|volume=2|issue=1|pages=133–159|doi=10.1086/680256|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/680256|accessdate=4 February 2018|issn=2333-5955}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a perfectly competitive market where fuel is the sole input used, if the price of fuel remains constant but efficiency is doubled, the effective price of travel would be halved (twice as much travel can be purchased). If in response, the amount of travel purchased more than doubles (i.e. demand is [[price elastic]]), then fuel consumption would increase, and the Jevons paradox would occur. If demand is price inelastic, the amount of travel purchased would less than double, and fuel consumption would decrease. However, goods and services generally use more than one type of input (e.g. fuel, labour, machinery), and other factors besides input cost may also affect price. These factors tend to reduce the rebound effect, making the Jevons paradox less likely to occur.&lt;ref name="Alcott2"/&gt;

==Khazzoom–Brookes postulate==
{{Main|Khazzoom–Brookes postulate}}

In the 1980s, economists Daniel Khazzoom and Leonard Brookes revisited the Jevons paradox for the case of society's [[World energy consumption|energy use]]. Brookes, then chief economist at the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority|UK Atomic Energy Authority]], argued that attempts to reduce energy consumption by increasing [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] would simply raise demand for energy in the economy as a whole. Khazzoom focused on the narrower point that the potential for rebound was ignored in mandatory performance standards for domestic appliances being set by the [[California Energy Commission]].&lt;ref name=Saunders&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saunders|first1=Harry D.|title=The Khazzoom-Brookes Postulate and Neoclassical Growth|journal=The Energy Journal|date=October 1992|volume=13|issue=4|pages=131–148|jstor=41322471}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herring|first=Horace|date=19 July 1999|title=Does energy efficiency save energy? The debate and its consequences|journal=Applied Energy|volume=63|issue=3|pages=209–226|issn=0306-2619|doi=10.1016/S0306-2619(99)00030-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the economist Harry Saunders dubbed the hypothesis that improvements in [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] work to increase (rather than decrease) energy consumption the ''Khazzoom–Brookes postulate'', and argued that the hypothesis is broadly supported by neoclassical [[Economic growth|growth theory]] (the mainstream economic theory of [[capital accumulation]], [[Technological change|technological progress]] and [[long-run]] economic growth). Saunders showed that the Khazzoom–Brookes postulate occurs in the [[neoclassical growth model]] under a wide range of assumptions.&lt;ref name=Saunders/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sorrell&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sorrell|first1=Steve|title=Jevons’ Paradox revisited: The evidence for backfire from improved energy efficiency|journal=Energy Policy|date=April 2009|volume=37|issue=4|pages=1456–1469|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2008.12.003|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421508007428|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Saunders, increased [[Electrical efficiency|energy efficiency]] tends to increase energy consumption by two means. First, increased energy efficiency makes the use of energy relatively cheaper, thus encouraging increased use (the direct rebound effect). Second, increased energy efficiency increases real incomes and leads to increased economic growth, which pulls up energy use for the whole economy. At the [[Microeconomics|microeconomic]] level (looking at an individual market), even with the rebound effect, improvements in energy efficiency usually result in reduced energy consumption.&lt;ref name=Greening&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/S0301-4215(00)00021-5 | surname=Greening| first=Lorna | title=Energy efficiency and consumption—the rebound effect—a survey |author2=David L. Greene |author3=Carmen Difiglio| journal=Energy Policy |volume=28 | year=2000 | pages=389–401 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; | issue=6–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the rebound effect is usually less than 100%. However, at the [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] level, more efficient (and hence comparatively cheaper) energy leads to faster economic growth, which increases energy use throughout the economy. Saunders argued that, taking into account both microeconomic and macroeconomic effects, technological progress that improves energy efficiency will tend to increase overall energy use.&lt;ref name=Saunders/&gt;

==Energy conservation policy==
{{See also | Steady-state economy #Resource decoupling and the rebound effect }}
{{Sustainable energy}}

There is considerable debate about whether the Khazzoom-Brookes Postulate is correct, and of the relevance of the Jevons paradox to [[energy conservation]] policy. Most governments, environmentalists and NGOs pursue policies that improve efficiency, holding that these policies will lower resource consumption and reduce environmental problems. Others, including many [[environmental economists]], doubt this 'efficiency strategy' towards [[sustainability]], and worry that efficiency gains may in fact lead to higher production and consumption. They hold that for resource use to fall, efficiency gains should be coupled with other policies that limit resource use.&lt;ref name=Alcott1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sorrell/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/12/20/101220fa_fact_owen|title=Annals of Environmentalism: The Efficiency Dilemma|last=Owen|first=David|date=December 20, 2010|work=[[The New Yorker]]|pages=78–}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other environmental economists point out that, while the Jevons Paradox may occur in some situations, the empirical evidence for its widespread applicability is limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gillingham |first1=Kenneth |last2=Kotchen |first2=Matthew J. |last3=Rapson |first3=David S. |last4=Wagner |first4=Gernot |title=Energy policy: The rebound effect is overplayed |journal=Nature |date=23 January 2013 |volume=493 |issue=7433 |pages=475–476 |doi=10.1038/493475a |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/493475a |accessdate=28 October 2018 |language=En |issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Jevons warned that fuel efficiency gains tend to increase fuel use. However, this does not imply that improved fuel efficiency is worthless if the Jevons paradox occurs; higher fuel efficiency enables greater production and a higher material [[quality of life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ryan|first1=Lisa|last2=Campbell|first2=Nina|title=Spreading the net: the multiple benefits of energy efficiency improvements|journal=IEA Energy Papers|doi=10.1787/20792581|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/energy/spreading-the-net-the-multiple-benefits-of-energy-efficiency-improvements_5k9crzjbpkkc-en|accessdate=5 June 2015|series=IEA Energy Papers|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a more efficient steam engine allowed the cheaper transport of goods and people that contributed to the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Nonetheless, if the Khazzoom–Brookes postulate is correct, increased fuel efficiency, by itself, will not reduce the rate of depletion of [[fossil fuel]]s.&lt;ref name=Saunders/&gt;

The Jevons paradox is sometimes used to argue that [[energy conservation]] efforts are futile, for example, that more efficient use of oil will lead to increased demand, and will not slow the arrival or the effects of [[peak oil]]. This argument is usually presented as a reason not to enact environmental policies or pursue fuel efficiency (e.g. if cars are more efficient, it will simply lead to more driving).&lt;ref name="Potter"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Potter | first=Andrew | title=Planet-friendly design?

First, in the context of a mature market such as for oil in developed countries, the direct rebound effect is usually small, and so increased fuel efficiency usually reduces resource use, other conditions remaining constant.&lt;ref name="Small"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Greening/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

For example, increased fuel efficiency may mitigate the price increases, shortages and disruptions in the global economy associated with peak oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

|doi= 10.1002/aic.10747}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third, environmental economists have pointed out that fuel use will unambiguously decrease if increased efficiency is coupled with an intervention (e.g. a [[fuel tax]]) that keeps the cost of fuel use the same or higher.&lt;ref name="Wackernagel"/&gt;

The Jevons paradox indicates that increased efficiency by itself may not reduce fuel use, and that [[sustainable energy]] policy must rely on other types of government interventions.&lt;ref name="Energy Efficiency Policies"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Amado|first1=Nilton Bispo|last2=Sauer|first2=Ildo L.|title=An ecological economic interpretation of the Jevons effect|journal=Ecological Complexity|date=February 2012|volume=9|pages=2–9|doi=10.1016/j.ecocom.2011.10.003|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1476945X11000717|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the imposition of conservation standards or other government interventions that increase cost of use do not display the Jevon paradox, they can be used to control the rebound effect.&lt;ref name="Energy Efficiency Policies"/&gt; To ensure that efficiency-enhancing technological improvements reduce fuel use, efficiency gains can be paired with government intervention that reduces demand (e.g. [[ecotax|green taxes]], [[Emissions trading|cap and trade]], or higher [[emissions standard]]s). The [[ecological economics|ecological economists]] [[Mathis Wackernagel]] and [[William E. Rees (academic)|William Rees]] have suggested that any cost savings from efficiency gains be "taxed away or otherwise removed from further economic circulation. Preferably they should be captured for reinvestment in [[natural capital]] rehabilitation."&lt;ref name="Wackernagel"/&gt; By mitigating the economic effects of government interventions designed to promote ecologically sustainable activities, efficiency-improving technological progress may make the imposition of these interventions more palatable, and more likely to be implemented.&lt;ref name="Laitner DeCanio Peters"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Laitner |first=John A.|first2=Stephen J.|last2= De Canio |first3= Irene|last3= Peters |title=Incorporating Behavioural, Social, and Organizational Phenomena in the Assessment of Climate Change Mitigation Options  |journal=Society, Behaviour, and Climate Change Mitigation |year=2003|volume=8 |pages=1–64|doi=10.1007/0-306-48160-X_1 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/n107734r313hh4wp/ |accessdate=2010-08-08|series=Advances in Global Change Research|isbn=0-7923-6802-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kaigas''' glaciation was a hypothesized [[snowball earth]] event in the [[Neoproterozoic]] Era, preceding the [[Sturtian glaciation]]. Its occurrence was inferred based on the interpretation of [[Kaigas Formation]] [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]] in the stratigraphy overlying the [[Kalahari Craton]] as correlative with pre-Sturtian Numees formation glacial diamictites. However, the Kaigas formation was later determined to be non-glacial, and a Sturtian age was assigned to the Numees diamictites. Thus, there is no longer any evidence for a Neoproterozoic glaciation prior to the Sturtian snowball earth event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1130/G36511.1|title=A Cryogenian chronology: Two long-lasting synchronous Neoproterozoic glaciations|journal=Geology|volume=43|issue=5|pages=459|year=2015|last1=Rooney|first1=A.

'''The Köyceğiz-Dalyan Special Environmental Protection Area''' is a protected natural reserve in the Turkish province of [[Muğla Province|Muğla]]. In June 1988 it was determined and declared the first protected area of its kind (''Özel Çevre Koruma Bölgesi'') of Turkey. In 1990 the original SPA area was extended westwards.&lt;ref&gt;Die Amphibien und Reptilien der Südwest-Türkei; M. Franzen, M. Bußmann, Th. Kordges. B. Thiesmeier; Laurent Verlag; 2008&lt;/ref&gt; 
Up to now, there are fourteen natural reserves with this status, of which [[Pamukkale]] is probably the best-known. All these areas are under the supervision of the [[Özel Çevre Koruma Korumu|ÖÇKK]], the Turkish Environmental Protection Agency for Special Areas.

The area got its special status as a result of [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip´s]] request to the Turkish Prime Minister [[Turgut Özal]] for a moratorium on the construction of a hotel complex at [[İztuzu Beach]],&lt;ref&gt;Kaptan June and the Turtles; June Haimoff; Janus Publishing 1997&lt;/ref&gt; while awaiting an environmental impact assessment. At the time Prince Philip was President of the [[World Wildlife Fund|WWF]], which had been approached by environmentalists such as [[June Haimoff]], Günther Peter, [[David Bellamy]], [[Lily Venizelos]], Nergis Yazgan and Keith Corbett to help stop the construction of a hotel complex at the beach. İztuzu Beach was one of the main nesting areas for the endangered [[loggerhead turtle]] (''Caretta caretta''), and the environmentalists were trying to preserve the turtle’s habitat. In September 1987 the construction project was suspended for an environmental [[impact assessment]], and in 1988 the Turkish government decided upon a construction prohibition because of the area’s special significance. That was not only because of the natural importance of the beach and its significance as a turtle habitat, but also because of the cultural and historical significance and the geological importance of the Dalyan-Köyceğiz hinterland.
Because of its protected status, the area offers good and ample opportunities for [[ecotourism]] and recreation. For one, the Köyceğiz-Dalyan SEPA boasts the most fantastic panoramic vistas.

From 1990 onwards the protected status of the area was elaborated in a number of  sustainable environmental projects,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.planbleu.org/publications/atelier_tourisme/powerpoints/sessionIII_c_Turkey.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927220132/http://www.planbleu.org/publications/atelier_tourisme/powerpoints/sessionIII_c_Turkey.pdf |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}|Workshop Promoting a sustainable tourism development in Turkey; Koycegiz -Dalyan SPA's projects as an example of good practice; Prof. Dr. Cevat Tosun&lt;/ref&gt; in order to:
* protect and improve its [[biodiversity]];
* counter environmental pollution;
* establish a balance between developments in agriculture, industry and tourism on the one hand and the environment on the other hand;
* protect the area’s ground and surface waters.

The SEPA covers an area of 461&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and includes the Köyceğiz, Toparlar, Beyobaşı and Dalyan districts. There are 17 settlements of which Köyceğiz on the north bank of the lake, and the tourist town of Dalyan on the river emerging from the lake are the most important ones.&lt;ref&gt;Die Amphibien und Reptilien der Südwest-Türkei; M. Franzen, M. Bußmann, Th. Kordges. B. Thiesmeier; Laurent Verlag; 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description of the area ==
[[File:Meer van Köyceğiz.JPG|thumb|left|400px|Köyceğiz Lake. Photo: Maria Jonker]]&lt;br /&gt;
The area consists of various terrestrial structures around the Köyceğiz subsidence lake. &lt;br /&gt;
Köyceğiz Lake is one of Turkey’s largest coastal lakes, which was formed in Antiquity as a result of the formation of a long stretch of dunes (İztuzu Beach). The lake is fed by the waters of the Namnam river in the northwest and the Yuvarlakçay in the east. The latter is reported to be an [[otter]] habitat. In the north and west some mountain streams flow into the lake. &lt;br /&gt;
It is the biotope variety in such a relatively small area that makes the SEPA so special.  There are fresh water lakes, rivers and brooks, a vast [[brackish water]] zone in the estuary, the sea and its sandy beach. Apart from agricultural land for growing citrus fruit, sesame and cotton, there are [[wetlands]], extensive liquidambar forests, pine forests and [[Maquis shrubland|maquis]].
Around the lake there are numerous small wetlands with a rich bird population. Among the birds are the [[European penduline tit|penduline tit]], the [[Eurasian reed warbler]], the [[great reed warbler]] and [[black-crowned night heron]]. The wetlands often border marshy [[Liquidambar orientalis|Turkish sweetgum]] forests. The sweetgum forests are often intersected by ditches and frequently have an undergrowth of [[Equisetum|horse tail]].
The Turkish or Oriental sweetgum is an endemic species that thrives in boggy areas and is often seen in combination with plane trees. The species has traditionally been important for the extraction of its sap, which is processed to [[Storax|balsam storax]] or Turkish sweetgum oil. The sap, which is collected by carefully stripping part of the bark, is used for medical purposes and for the production of perfume. For this reason, the forests used to be of major economical importance. However, there are fewer and fewer master oil makers who can pass on their trade. &lt;br /&gt;
Unfortunately, the liquidambar forest area has been reduced by illegal tree felling &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eldis.org/fulltext/sparea.pdf]|Specially Protected Area Management -Towards a Sustainable Resource Management and Settlement Development in Turkey, p.&amp;nbsp;3 Levent Keskin, (Ministry of Environment), Eyüp Yüksel (Authority for the Protection of Special Areas)&lt;/ref&gt; to create new or vaster agricultural fields. Representative sweetgum forests can still be found on the Yuvarlakçay near the village of Kavakarası, on the bank north of [[Sultaniye (Köyceğiz)|Sultaniye]], northwest of Hamitköy, at Köyceğiz and at Tepearası. [[File:Nijlschildpad.JPG|thumb|left|400px|Nile turtle near mud bath on the Dalyan river. Photo: Maria Jonker]]At the south side of Lake Köyceğiz there is a NW-SE [[Fault (geology)|fault]], along which several sulphurous thermal springs are located. &lt;br /&gt;
The only spa resort, at Sultaniye, was restored in the 90’s and has been a popular tourist attraction ever since. The water temperature amounts to 40&amp;nbsp;°C. Apart from the thermal spring, it also has a mud bath. There is another mud bath somewhat downriver at a former river branch. This is a location where the Nile turtle (''Trionyx triunguis'') can be spotted. It is a turtle with a soft shell, thence also called African softshell turtle, which is about 1 metre in size. It is a protected, thermophile species. Consequently, it is often seen near the thermal springs along the fault line. The species occurs near to the sea, in lagoons, lakes, rivers and canals, both in fresh and brackish waters. The Nile turtle is mainly aquatic and will only leave the water for short periods to rest in the sun. In the Köyceğiz-Dalyan SEPA, [[oviposition]] takes place at the brackish waterside of İztuzu Beach. The Dalyan-Köyceğiz basin is in the utmost northwest of the species’ range.&lt;br /&gt;Northeast and southeast of Köyceğiz Lake there are lowlands, whereas other parts are surrounded by hills. The highest among these are the Ölemez (937 m) in the southwest, and Bozburun Hill (556 m) in the south. The hills at the periphery of the area are mainly covered with [[Turkish pine|Turkish pine trees]] (''Pinus brutia''). &lt;br /&gt;
The Turkish pine is endemic for the eastern Mediterranean and Turkey is the main part of its range. It usually grows at lower altitudes, from sea level to 600 metres height. The tree reaches a height of 20–35 metres, with a maximum trunk diameter of approx. 1 metre. On the river opposite Dalyan are the rock tombs of [[Kaunos|Caunos]], the capital of ancient [[Caria]]. From the topmost rows of its amphitheatre and its Acropolis one has a wonderful view of the river, Alagöl (Çandır bay) and the reeds at the estuary. Apart from its cultural and historical significance, the historic city is interesting for its abundance of reptiles, birds and insects. Many of the altogether 33 reptile species of the Special Environmental Protected Area can be found at Caunos. Among its most conspicuous species are the [[Laudakia stellio|hardim or starred agama]], the [[Sheltopusik|European glass lizard]], the common chameleon, and the black whip snake. Moreover, there are numerous tortoises and terrapins at the site. Spectacular birds at and around Caunos are the [[western rock nuthatch|rock nuthatch]], the [[common kestrel]], the [[blue rock-thrush]] and the [[European roller]]. [[File:Wetlands bij Sülüngürmeer.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Wetlands bordering Sülüngür Lake. Photo: Maria Jonker]] The Dalyan estuary is a labyrinth of canals through the reeds. During a boat trip through the reeds one can see all sorts of birds, such as kingfishers, the [[little egret]], the [[great egret]] and the cormorant. At the west side of the delta is Alagöl, the bay of Çandır, which is heated by a number of thermal springs. This may be the reason why the bay is the mating scene for the loggerhead turtle in the second half of April. &lt;br /&gt;
Oviposition takes place at İztuzu Beach in May and June. With an average number of nests of approx. 200 per annum (57-330 range over the years of recording), İztuzu Beach is one of the main breeding areas of the species in the Mediterranean. For this reason there are strict regulations &lt;ref&gt;[http://caretta.pau.edu.tr/2010rapor.pdf]|DEKAMER 2010 Year Report(English and Turkish)]; Pamukkale University&lt;/ref&gt; to counter any disturbance
* From 1 May till 1 October the beach is closed to the public between 20.00 and 08.00 o’clock, in order to rule out disorientation of adult turtles and hatchlings by human disturbance and artificial light.
* In the nesting zone, which is marked with stakes, parasols and sun beds are banned and digging is forbidden to prevent nest disturbance or damage.
* The presence of vehicles and pets is forbidden at the beach.
* Speed boats are forbidden, both on the river and within a zone of 1 mile &lt;!-- Fact check please. Surely Turkey uses km for the zone regulation. Can anyone correct this figure --&gt; from the coast.

Since May 2009 there has been a sea turtle centre at the beach, run by the Biology Department of Pamukkale University. The staff and volunteers patrol the beach and keep records during the breeding season. Injured turtles found at the beach or at the estuary are taken to the centre for treatment and rehabilitation.  &lt;br /&gt;
The beach is also accessible by road. The route leads along the wetlands of Sülüngür Lake, which is shut off for boat traffic at the river side by a ''dalyan'' or fishing weir.  &lt;br /&gt;
On Bozburun Tepesi above İztuzu Beach lies a radar station, which offers a wonderful panoramic vista of the Köyceğiz-Dalyan SEPA.

The Omphalotus lineage (comprising the genera Omphalotus and ''[[Neonothopanus]]'') contains 12 species, the ''[[Armillaria]]'' lineage has 10 known species, while the [[Mycenaceae|Mycenoid]] lineage (''[[Mycena]]'', ''[[Panellus]]'', ''[[Prunulus]]'', ''[[Roridomyces]]'') has more than 50 species. The recently discovered Lucentipes lineage contains two species, ''[[Mycena lucentipes]]'' and ''[[Gerronema viridilucens]]'', which belong to a [[family (biology)|family]] that has not yet been formally named.&lt;ref name="Oliveira 2012"/&gt; ''[[Armillaria mellea]]'' is the most widely distributed of the luminescent fungi, found across Asia, Europe, North America, and South Africa.&lt;ref name="Vydryakova 2009"/&gt;

Bioluminescent fungi emit a greenish light at a [[wavelength]] of 520–530&amp;nbsp;[[nanometer|nm]]. The light emission is continuous and occurs only in living cells.&lt;ref name="OKane 1990"/&gt; No correlation of fungal [[bioluminescence]] with cell structure has been found. Bioluminescence may occur in both [[mycelia]] and [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]], as in ''[[Panellus stipticus]]'' and ''[[Omphalotus olearius]]'', or only in mycelia and young [[rhizomorph]]s, as in ''Armillaria mellea''.&lt;ref name="Wassink 1978"/&gt; In ''[[Roridomyces roridus]]'' luminescence occurs only in the [[spore]]s, while in ''[[Collybia tuberosa]]'', it is only in the sclerotia.&lt;ref name="Moore 2011"/&gt;

Although the [[biochemistry]] of fungal bioluminescence has not fully been characterized, the preparation of bioluminescent, [[cell-free system|cell-free]] extracts has allowed researchers to characterize the ''[[in vitro]]'' requirements of fungal bioluminescence. Experimental data suggest that a two-stage mechanism is required. In the first, a light-emitting substance (called "[[luciferin]]") is [[redox|reduced]] by a soluble [[reductase]] enzyme at the expense of [[NAD(P)H]]. In the second stage, reduced luciferin is [[oxidation|oxidized]] by an insoluble [[luciferase]] that releases the energy in the form of bluish-green light. Conditions that affect the growth of fungi, such as [[pH]], light and temperature, have been found to influence bioluminescence, suggesting a link between [[metabolism|metabolic activity]] and fungal bioluminescence.&lt;ref name="Moore 2011"/&gt;

All bioluminescent fungi share the same enzymatic mechanism, suggesting that there is a bioluminescent pathway that arose early in the evolution of the mushroom-forming Agaricales.&lt;ref name="Oliveira 2012"/&gt; All known luminescent species are [[white rot]] fungi capable of breaking down [[lignin]], found in abundance in wood. Bioluminescence is an oxygen-dependent metabolic process because it provides antioxidant protection against the potentially damaging effects of [[reactive oxygen species]] produced during wood decay. The physiological and ecological function of fungal bioluminescence has not been established with certainty. It has been suggested that in the dark beneath closed tropical [[forest canopy|forest canopies]], bioluminescent fruit bodies may be at an advantage by attracting [[grazing]] animals (including insects and other arthropods) that could help disperse their spores. Conversely, where mycelium (and [[vegetative reproduction|vegetative]] structures like rhizomorphs and sclerotia) are the bioluminescent tissues, the argument has been made that light emission could deter [[grazing]].&lt;ref name="Moore 2011"/&gt;

The following list of bioluminescent mushrooms is based on a 2008 literature survey by Dennis Desjardin and colleagues,&lt;ref name="Desjardin 2008"/&gt; in addition to accounts of several new species published since then.&lt;ref name="Desjardin 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Capelari 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aravindakshan 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shih 2013"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="186669">A complete '''list of [[introduced species]]''' for even quite small areas of the world would be dauntingly long. Humans have introduced more different species to new environments than any single document can hope to record. This list is generally for '''established species''' with truly wild populations&amp;mdash; not kept domestically&amp;mdash;that have been seen numerous times, and have breeding populations. While most introduced species can cause a negative impact to new environments they reach, some can have a positive impact, just for conservation purpose.

There are 291 peaks in Norway with elevations over sea level of {{convert|2000|m|ft|0}} or more and that have a [[topographic prominence]] of more than 10 meters. The following list includes those 186 that have a topographic prominence of 50 meters or more. The [[Topographic isolation]] refers to the shortest ''horizontal'' distance one would have to travel to find a higher summit.

==Location of peaks==
Most of these peaks are in the municipalities of [[Lom, Norway|Lom]], [[Skjåk]], [[Luster, Norway|Luster]], and [[Vågå]], connected to the mountain chain that reaches its prominence with [[Jotunheimen]]. There are also several peaks in [[Dovrefjell]], [[Rondane]], [[Dovre]], [[Lesja]], and [[Folldal]] that also reach above 2000 meters. All the peaks are to be found in 14 topographical maps ([[Norge 1:50000]]) published by the Norwegian government cartography office, of which 21 peaks are in ''1518 II Galdhøpiggen'', 18 in ''1618 III Glittertinden'', and 13 in ''1617 IV Gjende''. The northernmost is in the Dovre area, meaning there are no 2000 m peaks in northern Norway, even though there are some almost 2000 m there, and some above 2000 m in Sweden near the border.

Most of the difficult summits were ascended in the late 19th and early 20th century by a combination of Norwegian explorers, local guides (in particular the Sulheim family), and British adventurers.  Five women - [[Margaret S. Green]], [[Theresa Bertheau]], [[Antonette Kamstrup]], [[Anne Aukrust]], and [[Rønnaug Garmo]] - were the first to ascend some of these peaks. Aukrust and Garmo were from farms in Lom, where many of the peaks are located. The peak most recently climbed for the first time was [[Veobrehesten]], first ascended in 1949.

==Highest peaks in Norway with prominence above 50 m==

This article is a list of [[tornado]]es that have impacted the [[central business district]] ([[downtown]] or city centre) of a large [[city]] (that is, one having at least 50,000 people, not counting suburbs or outlying communities, at the time of the storm).

It is a common [[tornado myths|myth]] that tornadoes do not strike downtown areas. The odds are much lower due to the small areas covered, but paths can go anywhere, including over downtown areas. [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]] has taken a direct hit four times in less than a century.&lt;ref name="SPC downtown tornadoes"&gt;{{cite web |last=Edwards |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Edwards (meteorologist)|author2=J. Schaefer |title=Downtown Tornadoes |publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]] |url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/downtown.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the tornadoes listed were extremely destructive or caused numerous casualties, and the occurrence of a catastrophic event somewhere is inevitable.&lt;ref name="Violent Urban Tornado Study"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wurman |first=Joshua |authorlink=Joshua Wurman |author2=C. Alexander, P. Robinson, and Y. Richardson |title=Low-Level Winds in Tornadoes and Potential Catastrophic Tornado Impacts in Urban Areas |journal=[[Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society]] |volume=88 |issue=1 |pages=31–46 |publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]] |date=January 2007 |url=http://ams.allenpress.com/perlserv/?request=get-abstract&amp;doi=10.1175%2FBAMS-88-1-31 |doi=10.1175/BAMS-88-1-31 |bibcode = 2007BAMS...88...31W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This list is not exhaustive (listing every single tornado that has struck a downtown area or central business district of any city), as it may never be known if a tornado struck a downtown area, or if it was just a [[microburst]] (powerful downward and outward gush of wind, which cause damage from [[straight-line winds]]), particularly for older events or from areas with limited information. [[Downburst]]s often accompany intense tornadoes, extending damage across a wider area than the tornado path. When a tornado strikes a city, it is occasionally very difficult to determine whether it was a tornadic event at all or if the affected area was indeed the "downtown", "city centre", or "central business district" consisting of very high population density and mid to [[high-rise]]s, as opposed to other heavily urbanized/built-up parts of the city or suburbs. It is sometimes also difficult to determine tornadoes that strike urban cores before 1950, when tornado records (particularly in the US) started to be consistently logged with detail. Before this, lack of details on information from the events, as well as that most cities were far smaller in area and population complicate the record.

For the list of cities that are not listed here for certain reasons, see [[List of tornadoes striking downtown areas#Notable absences|below]].

== Notable absences ==
The [[The "Barrie" Tornado Outbreak of 1985|1985 Barrie Tornado]] that [[1985 United States-Canadian tornado outbreak|struck]] [[Barrie]], [[Ontario]] would be listed here, had it struck today. It is not listed, however, since the town's population was under 50,000 at the time (May 31, 1985). The tornado that hit [[Grand Valley, Ontario]] is not listed for similar reasons. Similarly, the [[1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak]] that spawned the deadly F5 tornado which struck [[Oklahoma City]] and some of its suburbs, including [[Moore, Oklahoma|Moore]] and [[Midwest City, Oklahoma|Midwest City]], is not listed because it did not reach the downtown core of Oklahoma City.

Similarly, the downtown areas of two then-small towns (now large cities) in [[North Carolina]] were struck during the 1884 [[Enigma tornado outbreak|Enigma outbreak]]: [[Concord, North Carolina|Concord]] and [[Cary, North Carolina|Cary]]. Downtown Concord was struck a second time by a tornado in May 1936.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, New York. February 21, 1884&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fort Wayne Daily Gazette, Fort Wayne, Indiana. February 22, 1884&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Finley, John P. Tornadoes: What They Are and How To Observe Them; With Practical Suggestions For The Protection of Life and Property, pages 98-103. The Insurance Monitor, New York, NY, 1887&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1987 [[Edmonton Tornado]] is likewise not listed because it struck [[industrial park]]s, [[trailer park]]s, and [[suburbs|suburban areas]], and was far away from [[Edmonton]]'s downtown core. The "[[Belvidere - Oak Lawn tornado outbreak|Oak Lawn tornado]]" of April 21, 1967 which killed 33&amp;nbsp;people, mostly those in [[rush hour]] [[traffic]] at a busy intersection, and moved across southern [[Chicago]] onto [[Lake Michigan]] is not included because it missed the [[downtown core]]. Most recently, the [[2008 Super Tuesday tornado outbreak|2008 Memphis tornado]] on February 5, 2008 also missed the downtown area (by a significant distance).

The [[Late-May 1998 tornado outbreak and derecho|1998 tornado]] that hit [[Spencer, South Dakota]], killing 6 people, the [[Pine Lake, Alberta Tornado|2000 tornado]] that hit a [[Pine Lake, Alberta|campground]], killing 12 people, the [[May 2007 tornado outbreak|2007 tornado]] that hit [[Greensburg, Kansas]], killing 11 people, the [[Elie, Manitoba tornado]] that hit [[Elie, Manitoba]] in 2007 with no fatalities, and the [[Southern Ontario Tornado Outbreak of 2009|2009 tornado]] that hit [[Durham, Ontario]], killing one person, are not listed because none of these tornadoes hit a metropolitan area that had a population higher than 50,000. The [[Southern Ontario tornado outbreak of 2005]] that hit [[Toronto]] was not confirmed and is therefore not listed.

Another notable absence is the July 7, 1915 storm that struck [[Cincinnati]], killing 38&amp;nbsp;people. This was determined to be most likely a [[windstorm]] causing [[downburst]]s or even a series of [[microburst]]s (with much of the damage coming from the [[straight-line winds]]), and not a [[tornado]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiohistory.org/etcetera/exhibits/swio/pages/content/1915_winds.htm/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070804175619/http://www.ohiohistory.org/etcetera/exhibits/swio/pages/content/1915_winds.htm |archivedate=2007-08-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

European tornadoes that are listed before 1950 are for cities that had at least 50,000&amp;nbsp;people in them at the time. Tornadoes dating back to 1054 are confirmed, due to extensive record-keeping for many weather events and other until-then unexplained weather occurrences.

On September 8, 2010, [[Tropical Storm Hermine (2010)|Tropical Storm Hermine]] went over the state of [[Texas]] and produced a few tornadoes in the [[Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex]]. One notable tornado was located in an industrialized area west of downtown Dallas before it lifted up over [[Interstate 35E (Texas)|Interstate 35E]] just south of [[Dallas Love Field]]. However the EF-2 tornado was only about 3–4 miles away and did not strike the immediate downtown Dallas area.

Reports regarding the '''longest recorded sniper kills''' that contain information regarding the shooting distance and the identity of the sniper have been presented to the general public since 1967. Snipers in modern warfare have had a substantial history following the development of long distance weaponry. As weapons, ammunition, and aids to determine [[Ballistics|ballistic]] solutions improved, so too did the distance from which a kill could be targeted. In mid-2017 it was reported that an unnamed Canadian special forces operator, based in Iraq, had set a new record of {{convert|3540|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}, beating the record previously held by British Corporal Craig Harrison at 2,475 m (2,707 yd).&lt;ref name= "Fife p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Fife|2017|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Murphy p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Murphy|2017|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Bunch p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Bunch|2017|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Global"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kalvapallé|first1=Rahul|title=Small but mighty: How Canada’s military produces some of the world’s best snipers|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/3552281/snipers-canadian-military/|accessdate=June 24, 2017|publisher=Global News|date=June 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sniper technology==
Although technology such as electronics have improved, optical equipment such as rangefinders and ballistic calculators have eliminated manual mathematical calculations to determine elevation and windage, the fundamentals of accurate and precise long-range shooting remain largely the same since the early history of shooting, and the skill and training of the shooter and the shooter's spotter where applicable are the primary factors. Accuracy and precision of ammunition and firearms are also still reliant primarily on human factors and attention to detail in the complex process of producing maximum performance.

The modern method of long-distance sniping (shots over {{Convert|1,100|meters|mi|1|disp=or|abbr=on}}) requires intense training and practice. A sniper must have the ability to accurately estimate the various factors that influence a [[bullet]]'s [[external ballistics|trajectory and point of impact]], such as the shooter's distance from the target, wind direction, wind speed, [[air density]], elevation, and even the [[Coriolis effect]] due to the rotation of the Earth. Mistakes in estimation compound over distance and can cause a shot to only injure, or to miss completely.&lt;ref name="Plaster p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Plaster|1993|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any given combination of firearm and ammunition will have an associated value, known as the [[circular error probable]] (CEP), defined as the radius of a circle whose boundary is expected to contain the impact points of half of the rounds fired.&lt;ref&gt;"Circular Error Probable (CEP)," Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center Technical Paper 6, Ver 2, July 1987, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

If the shooter wishes to improve accuracy and precision, wishes to increase range or wishes to do all of these things, the accuracy of "estimates" of external factors must improve accordingly. At extreme ranges, extremely accurate "estimates" are required and even with the most accurate estimates, hitting the target becomes subject to uncontrollable factors. For example, a rifle capable of firing a 1/2 MOA (approximately 1/2" center to center of the two holes furthest apart) 5-round group (often referred to as "grouping") at 100 yards will fire a theoretical 12.5" group at 2,500 yards. Unless the group is centered perfectly on the target at 100 yards, the 2,500-yard group will be centered 25 times the off-center error at 100 yards. This example ignores all other factors and assumes "perfect" no-wind shooting conditions and identical muzzle velocities and ballistic performance for each shot.

USMC Gunnery Sergeant [[Carlos Hathcock]]'s confirmed {{Convert|2,500|yd|meters|abbr=on}} kill in the Vietnam War was primarily due to the enemy soldier stopping his bicycle on the spot Hathcock had fired at while sighting in his Browning M2 heavy machine-gun.

Devices such as [[laser rangefinder]]s, handheld meteorological measuring equipment, handheld computers, and ballistic-prediction software can contribute to increased accuracy (i.e. reduced CEP), although they rely on proper use and training to realize any advantages. In addition, as instruments of measure, they are subject to accuracy errors and malfunction. Handheld meteorological instruments only measure conditions at the location they are used. Wind direction and speed can vary dramatically along the path of the bullet.

==History==
The science of long-range sniping came to fruition in the [[Vietnam War]]. [[Carlos Hathcock]] held the record from 1967 to 2002 at {{convert|2286|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Scott p. 181"&gt;{{harvnb|Henderson|2003|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He recorded 93 official kills.&lt;ref name="Gaijinass"&gt;{{cite web |ref=harv|date= May 6, 2010|url = http://gaijinass.wordpress.com/2010/05/06/1655/|title = The way of the Gun: USMC S/S|publisher = Gaijinass.com| accessdate = May 6, 2010 | last=Gaijinass| first= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After returning to the U.S., Hathcock helped to establish the Marine Corps [[Scout Sniper]] School at [[Marine Corps Base Quantico|Quantico, Virginia]].&lt;ref name="Scott p. 283"&gt;{{harvnb|Henderson|2003|p=283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his success as a USMC scout-sniper during multiple deployments to Vietnam, Gunnery Sergeant Hathcock competed in multiple USMC shooting teams. Hathcock also won the 1966 Wimbledon Cup, which is earned by the winner of the U.S. 1,000-yard high-powered rifle National Championship. Even after being severely burned during an attack on an [[Landing Vehicle Tracked|Amtrac]] on which he was riding and his efforts to rescue other soldiers, and after being diagnosed with [[multiple sclerosis]], Hathcock continued to serve, shoot and instruct. In Vietnam, Hathcock also completed missions involving a "through the scope" shot which killed an enemy sniper specifically hunting him, and a multiple-day solo stalk and kill of an enemy general.&lt;ref name="Dougherty"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dougherty |first=Martin J |title=Sniper: SAS and Elite Forces Guide: Sniping skills from the world's elite forces |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j1Dm6EnU7mkC&amp;pg=PT40 |publisher=Amber Books Ltd |isbn=978-1-909160-38-5 |page=40 |quote=Upon reaching the target area he discovered that his shot had gone through the scope of the sniper's rifle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="COBRA2004"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sasser |first1=Charles W. |last2=Roberts |first2=Craig |title=Crosshairs on the Kill Zone: American Combat Snipers, Vietnam through Operation Iraqi Freedom |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gQ-s4xBvCg8C&amp;pg=PA76 |date=July 1, 2004 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4165-0362-0 |page=76 |quote=Hathcock's bullet had gone through the cobra sniper's scope and entered his eye}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RiegertKaplan2013"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Riegert |first1=Keith |last2=Kaplan |first2=Samuel |title=The MANual: Trivia.

Hathcock's record stood until Canadian sniper [[Arron Perry]] of the [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]] exceeded it with a shot of {{Convert|2,310|meters|yd|abbr=on}}. Perry held the title for only a few days, as another man in his unit (Corporal [[Rob Furlong]]) beat Perry's distance with a {{convert|2430|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} shot in March 2002. Perry and Furlong were part of a six-man sniper team during 2002's [[Operation Anaconda]], part of the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–14)|War in Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name="Global"/&gt;

Corporal Furlong's record was bested by a British soldier, [[Craig Harrison (sniper)|Corporal of Horse Craig Harrison]], of the Blues and Royals, [[Household Cavalry]], who recorded two {{convert|2475|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} shots (confirmed by [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]) in November 2009, also during the War in Afghanistan, in which he hit two Taliban insurgents consecutively.&lt;ref name="Smith p." /&gt; Harrison killed the two Taliban machine gunners with shots that took the 8.59&amp;nbsp;mm rounds almost five seconds to hit their targets, which were {{Convert|900|meters|yd|abbr=on}} beyond the L115A3 sniper rifle’s recommended range. A third shot took out the insurgents' machine gun. The rifle used was made by [[Accuracy International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/industry/defence/10762782/Accuracy-International-the-gun-maker-of-choice-for-Britains-elite-marksmen.html|title=The company behind the rifle used by the world's deadliest sniper|last=Tovey|first=Alan|date=2 February 2015|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, an unnamed sniper from Canada's Tier 1 special forces unit, [[Joint Task Force 2]], surpassed the 2009 record by over {{convert|1,000|meters|yd|abbr=on}}, with a {{convert|3540|meters|yd|0|abbr=on}} shot in the 
[[Iraqi Civil War (2014–present)|Iraqi Civil War]]. As with the previous two Canadian records, a [[McMillan Tac-50]] with [[Hornady|Hornady A-MAX .50 (.50 BMG)]] ammunition was used.&lt;ref name= "Fife p. "/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Murphy p. "/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Bunch p. "/&gt;

==Confirmed kills {{convert|1250|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} or greater==
This list is not exhaustive, as such data is generally not tracked nor managed under any official procedure. For example, the [[Canadian Army]] 2002 sniper team that saw two soldiers ([[Arron Perry]]/2,310 m and [[Rob Furlong]]/2,430 m) set consecutive new records, also made a number of kills at {{Convert|1,500|meter|yd|abbr=on}} that are not counted here.&lt;ref name="Maclean.Furlong"/&gt; The list also shows that, in some cases, an armed force command may choose to withhold the name of the actual sniper for security reasons. The United Nations Security Forces, such as in the Balkans, also had one U.S. sniper (name withheld) attributed with a {{Convert|1,271|meter|yd|abbr=on}} shot.

While not on the list due to the range being less than the minimum distance used to compile it, Hathcock's second-longest confirmed kill was {{convert|1200|yards|m}} using a "standard" USMC sniper rifle chambered in .30-06 Springfield. At the time of Hathcock's service, snipers had essentially been eliminated from the USMC, and its sniper rifles were a hodgepodge mix of commercial [[Remington Model 700|Remington 700]] and [[Winchester Model 70]] rifles chambered for multiple cartridges. The major challenge for Hathcock and other scout-snipers was improving the performance and reliability of their rifles and ammunition.

'''Maria Makiling''', in [[Philippine mythology]], is a ''[[diwata]]'' ([[anito]]) or ''lambana'' (fairy) associated with [[Mount Makiling]] in [[Laguna province|Laguna]], [[Philippines]].  She is the most widely known ''diwata'' in Philippine mythology,&lt;ref name=Eugenio&gt;{{Citation |last = Eugenio |first = Damiana |authorlink = Damiana L. Eugenio |title = Philippine Folk Literature: The Legends |publisher = University of the Philippines Press |year = 2002 |location =Quezon City |isbn = 971-542-357-4 |page =490 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was venerated in pre-colonial Philippines as a goddess known as Dayang Masalanta or Dian Masalanta who was invoked to stop deluge, storms and earthquakes.

Maria Makiling is the [[genius loci|guardian spirit]] of the mountain, responsible for protecting its bounty and thus, is also a benefactor for the townspeople who depend on the mountain's resources.  In addition to being a guardian of the mountain, some legends also identify Laguna de Bay&amp;nbsp;— and the fish caught from it&amp;nbsp;— as part of her domain. She was sent by [[Bathala]] to aid the people of the area in their everyday life.&lt;ref name=kuro5hin/&gt;

It is often said that Mount Makiling resembles the profile of a woman, said to be Maria herself.  This phenomenon is described as true from several different perspectives, so there is no single location associated with this claim.  The mountain's various peaks are said to be Maria's face and two breasts, respectively, and her hair cascades downwards a gentle slope away from her body.&lt;ref name=Eugenio/&gt;

Maria Makiling is a prominent example of the mountain-goddesses motiff in Philippine mythology, other prominent examples being [[Maria Sinukuan]] of [[Pampanga]]'s [[Mount Arayat]] and [[Maria Cacao]] on [[Cebu]]'s [[Mount Lantoy]].

== Etymology ==
Legends do not clarify whether this spirit was named after the mountain or the mountain was named after her.  The evolution of the name, however, presents some clues.&lt;ref name="Odal"/&gt;

=== "Maria" or "Dayang": "the lady" ===
The name "Mariang Makiling" is the Spanish-Tagalog contraction of "Maria ng Makiling" (Maria '''''of''''' Makiling).  The term is a hispanized evolution of an alternate name for the Diwata, "Dayang Makiling" - "dayang" being an [[austronesian language|Austronesian]] word meaning "princess" or "noble lady".&lt;ref name="Odal"/&gt; Prior to the conversion of the natives to Christianity, Maria Makiling was already known as ''Makiling'', an anito sent by [[Bathala]] in Mount Makiling to aid mankind in their daily tasks. The 'Maria' was added by the Spanish in a bid to 'rebrand' her as Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philsites.net/folklore/stories/legend1.html|title=The Legend of Maria Makiling retold by Gat Jose Rizal|accessdate=2010-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Grace Odal of the University of the Philippines believes there is a significant link between Maria Makiling and the mythical woman (''Ba'i'') for whom the town of [[Bay, Laguna|Bay]] and the lake of [[Laguna de Bay]] are named.   When the lady of the lake also became associated with the nearby mountain, the common description of her became that of the 'lady of the mountain'.&lt;ref name="Odal"&gt;{{Citation | last=Odal-Devora |first=Grace P. |author-link=Grace P. Odal-Devora |contribution="Bae" or "Bai": The Lady of the Lake |editor-last=Alejandro |editor-first=Reyndaldo Gamboa |title= Laguna de Bay: The Living Lake |publisher=Uniliever Philippines |publication-date=2002 |isbn=9719227214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Makiling: "crooked" or "bent" ===
As for the word "Makiling", it has been noted that the mountain rises from Laguna de Bay "''to a rugged top and breaks into irregular hills southward, thus 'leaning' or 'uneven.'''"  The Tagalog word for 'leaning' or 'uneven' is "''Makiling''."&lt;ref name="Eugenio"/&gt;  This corresponds with the common belief that the profile of the mountain resembles that of a reclining woman, from certain angles.

A less often mentioned possible origin for the name of the mountain is that the name describes the mountain as having plenty of the bamboo variety known as "kawayang kiling" ([[Bambusa vulgaris|Bambusa vulgaris Schrad.]]).  By this etymology, the mountain would have been named after the bamboo, and the lady named after the mountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Kauayan-kiling | work = StuartXChange: Philippine Medicinal Plants | publisher = Godofredo Stuart | date = | url = http://www.stuartxchange.org/Kauayan-kiling.html | accessdate = August 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearance ==
Descriptions of Maria Makiling are fairly consistent.  She is a breathtakingly beautiful&lt;ref name="Lanuza"/&gt; young woman who never ages.&lt;ref name="Eugenio"/&gt; Lanuza describes her as having "light olive skin, long shining black hair, and twinkling eyes."

It is said that the abundance and serenity of the enchanted mountain complements Maria's own persona.&lt;ref name="Eugenio"/&gt;

She is also closely associated with the white mist that often surrounds the mountain.  While in just a few stories either her skin or hair is white, in most tales, it is her radiant clothing which makes people who have seen her think that perhaps they just saw a wisp of cloud through the trees and mistook it for Maria.&lt;ref name="Eugenio"/&gt;

== Home on the mountain ==
Unlike Maria Sinukuan and Maria Cacao who live in caves in their respective mountains, Makiling is often described as living in a humble hut.&lt;ref name="Eugenio"/&gt;

In some stories, this hut is situated in the village, amongst the people, where Maria Makiling lived before she fled to the mountains after having been offended for some reason.&lt;ref name="Eugenio"/&gt;

In other stories, the hut is up in the mountain, and can only be found if one is allowed by Maria to find it.&lt;ref name="Rizal"/&gt;

== Legends of Maria Makiling ==
Because stories about Maria Makiling were part of [[oral tradition]] long before they were documented, there are numerous versions of the Maria Makiling legend.&lt;ref name="Eugenio"/&gt;  Some of these are not stories per se, but superstitions.

=== Superstitions about Maria Makiling ===
One superstition is that every so often, men would disappear into the forests of the mountain.  It is said that Makiling has fallen in love with that particular man, and has taken him to her house to be her husband, there to spend his days in matrimonial bliss.
Another superstition says that one can go into the forests and pick and eat any fruits one might like, but never carry any of them home.  In doing so, one runs the risk of angering Maria Makiling.  One would get lost, and be beset by insect stings and thorn pricks.  The only solution is to throw away the fruit, and then to reverse one's clothing as evidence to Maria that one is no longer carrying any of her fruit.

=== Turning Ginger into gold ===
Perhaps the most common "full" story is that of Maria turning ginger into gold to help one villager or the other.&lt;ref name="Eugenio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kuro5hin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lanuza"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rizal"/&gt; In these stories, Maria is said to live in a place known to the villagers, and interacts with them regularly.  The villager in question is often either a mother seeking a cure for her ill child, or a husband seeking a cure for his wife.

The wise Maria recognizes the symptoms as signs not of disease, but of hunger brought about by extreme poverty.  She gives the villager some ginger, which, by the time the villager gets home, has magically turned to gold

In versions where the villager is going home to his wife, he unwisely throws some of the ginger away because it had become too heavy to carry.

In some versions, the villagers love her all the more for her act of kindness.

In most, however, greedy villagers break into Maria's garden to see if her other plants were really gold.  Distressed by the villager's greed, Maria runs away up the mountain, her pristine white clothing soon becoming indistinguishable from the white clouds that play amongst the trees on the upper parts of the mountains.

=== Spurned Lover ===
In many other stories, Makiling is characterized as a spurned lover.

In one story, she fell in love with a hunter who had wandered into her kingdom. Soon the two became lovers, with the hunter coming up the mountain every day.  They promised to love each other forever.  When Maria discovered that he had met, fell in love with, and married a mortal woman, she was deeply hurt. Realizing that she could not trust townspeople because she was so different from them, and that they were just using her, she became angry and refused to give fruits to the trees, let animals and birds roam the forests for hunters to catch, and let fish abound in the lake. People seldom saw her, and those times when she could be seen were often only during pale moonlit nights.&lt;ref name="kuro5hin"&gt;{{Citation  | last =  | first =  | author-link =   | title = A brief introduction to Filipino folklore and mythology  | date = June 21, 2003  | url = http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/6/20/21542/7380  | accessdate = 2007-09-30  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another version of the story, told by the Philippines' National Hero, [[Jose Rizal]], Maria falls in love with a farmer, whom she then watches over.  This leads the townspeople say he is endowed with a charm, or mutya, as it is called, that protected him from harm.  The young man was good at heart and simple in spirit, but also quiet and secretive. In particular, he would not say much of his frequent visits into the wood of Maria Makiling. But then war came to the land, and army officers came recruiting unmarried young men. The man entered an arranged marriage so that he could stay safely in the village. A few days before his marriage, he visits Maria one last time. "I hope that you were devoted to me," she said sadly, "but you need an earthly love, and you do not have enough faith in me besides. I could have protected you and your family." After saying this, she disappeared. Maria Makiling was never seen by the peasants again, nor was her humble hut ever rediscovered.&lt;ref name="Rizal"&gt;{{Citation  | last = Rizal  | first = Jose  | author-link = Jose Rizal  | title = Mariang Makiling   | date =  | year =  | url = http://folklore.philsites.net/stories/legend1.html  | accessdate = 2007-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Three Suitors ===
Michelle Lanuza tells another version of the story, set during the later part of the Spanish occupation:&lt;ref name="Lanuza"&gt;{{Citation|last=Lanuza |first=Michelle |author-link=Michelle Lanuza |title=The Legend of Maria Makiling |date= |year= |url=http://www.faerytales.net/mm.html |accessdate=2007-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071002215709/http://www.faerytales.net/mm.html |archivedate=2007-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Maria was sought for and wooed by many suitors, three of whom were the Captain Lara, a Spanish soldier; Joselito, a Spanish mestizo studying in Manila; and Juan who was but a common farmer. Despite his lowly status, Juan was chosen by Maria Makiling.

Spurned, Joselito and Captain Lara conspired to frame Juan for setting fire to the cuartel of the Spanish. Juan was shot as the enemy of the Spaniards. Before he died, he cried Maria's name out loud.

The ''diwata'' quickly came down from her mountain while Captain Lara and Joselito fled to Manila in fear of Maria's wrath. When she learned what happened, she cursed the two, along with all other men who cannot accept failure in love.

Soon, the curse took effect. Joselito suddenly contracted an incurable illness. The revolutionary Filipinos killed Captain Lara.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"From then on," Lanuza concludes, "Maria never let herself be seen by the people again. Every time somebody gets lost on the mountain, they remember the curse of the ''diwata''. Yet they also remember the great love of Maria Makiling."

== Modern sightings ==
Mount Makiling still abounds with superstitions and stories concerning Makiling. When people get lost on the mountain, the disappearances are still attributed to the diwata or to spirits who follow her.

A common story is that of a group of hikers who leave their camp dirty with human waste and empty cans and bottles. Searching for water, the hikers find themselves befuddled, coming back to the same place over and over again. Only after they cleaned their camp did they manage to find water.

In the [[University of the Philippines Los Baños]], a university that sits on the foot of Mount Makiling, students still tell stories of a woman in white who is sighted walking down the long uphill road heading to the [[College of Forestry and Natural Resources|Upper (College of Forestry) Campus]].  Sometimes, the woman appears to be trying to hitch a ride down the mountain.  Invariably, the observers are said to be frightened and just ignore the woman, believing her to be Maria Makiling.

The unusual weather patterns on the mountain area are also often attributed to Maria Makiling.  Often this means sudden rains whenever particularly noisy events are held in the areas near the mountain.  Locals say that the diwata does not approve of the event. Acclaimed stage and screen actor and director [[Behn Cervantes]] relates a reverse version of this legend, during the launching program for the UP Alumni Association's Maria Makiling Foundation, an advocacy group formed for the protection and conservation of Mount Makiling:&lt;ref name="Cervantes"&gt;{{Citation| author=Behn Cervantes| authorlink=Behn Cervantes| title=Maria Makiling Comes Alive| journal=Filipinas: the Magazine for Filipinos Worldwide| date=April 2009| url=http://www.filipinas.inquirer.net/?p=1156| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030722/http://www.filipinas.inquirer.net/?p=1156| archivedate=2016-03-04| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|During our launch, we had a hair-raising experience. When the remarkable Dulce (singer) reached the climax of her song of praise to Nature, she raised her arms as though in veneration of Maria Makiling. As if on cue, golden leaves from surrounding trees showered the audience like petals from the heavens. The astounded crowd gasped and aahhed in unison. Los Baños' Dr. Portia Lapitan whispered to me, "The diwata approves."}}

== In art and popular culture ==
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Ph seal laguna losbanos.png|right|thumb|Maria Makiling has a prominent place on the Seal of the Municipality of [[Los Baños, Laguna]].]] --&gt;
Maria Makiling is a common theme among Filipino artists, ranging from painters and sculptors to graphic novelists.

*One prominent depiction of Maria Makiling can be found on the Seal of the Municipality of [[Los Baños, Laguna]].  It depicts Maria makiling in the foreground with the mountain in the background and water (representing [[Laguna de Bay]]) at her feet.
*A statue of Maria Makiling was once put up in front of UPLB's main library.  It depicts the diwata surrounded by various creatures of the forest, most noticeably a doe and some birds.  The statue has since been replaced by that of the "Philippine Pegasus" or "Pegaraw".  The original statue was moved to the road leading up to UPLB's College of Forestry, near the University Health Service.
*Another statue of Maria Makiling was once put up at the boundary of Los Baños and [[Calamba City]], on the boundary marker that identifies Los Baños as a "Special Science and Nature City".  The statue has since been removed.  That specific statue had been criticized by some members of Los Baños' religious sector because they said it glorified a [[territorial spirit]].  No official remark has been made, however, as to whether this complaint had anything to do with the removal of the statue.
*The most recently unvailed statue of Maria Makiling stands in UPLB's Alumni Plaza, sculpted by renowned Filipino artist JunYee.
*At least three other statues in the UPLB campus are associated with Makiling, although not explicitly stated to be statues of the goddess herself.  The oldest is the reconstructed pre-war statue referred to as "''Dalambanga''" (literally meaning jar bearer) near the [[Molawin River]], depicting a woman (sometimes interpreted as Makiling herself, and sometimes called "Maria Dalambanga") carrying a jar&amp;nbsp;— a reference to the legend of how [[Calamba, Laguna]] got its name. Another is the "''Mother Nature''" statue that serves as the facade of the Ecosystems Research and Development Bureau in the upper campus.&lt;ref&gt;http://erdb.denr.gov.ph/mother.php&lt;/ref&gt;  The other is Maria Pureza Escaño's 8-Foot Fiberglass Resin Sculpture "''The Rose of Marya: Service through Excellence''" intended as a "tribute to the women of UPLB who excel and serve."&lt;ref&gt;http://puchetteescano.weebly.com/the-rose-of-marya-service-through-excellence.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[Arnold Arre]]'s graphic novel, [[Ang Mundo ni Andong Agimat]], Maria Makiling is in love with a [[Katipunan|Katipunero]] (revolutionary).  When her lover is killed by Zolgo, she loses her memory due to trauma.  She wanders down to the city, with no clue on who she is.  The graphic novel chronicles the efforts of the protagonists to find Maria and restore her memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=San Diego|first=Bayani Jr.|author-link=Bayani San Diego Jr.|title=‘Andong Agimat’ to the US film mart|newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer|pages=|date=8 October 2007|url=http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/entertainment/entertainment/view_article.php?article_id=93095|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011015255/http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/entertainment/entertainment/view_article.php?article_id=93095|archivedate=11 October 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*To celebrate the launching of the [[UPAA Maria Makiling Foundation]], an advocacy group formed by the UP Alumni Association to promote conservation efforts of the mountain, the Foundation held the Mariang Makiling Ecological-Cultural Festival.  A highlight of that event was what UPLB Chancellor Velasco described as a relauching of the image of Maria Makiling—modelled at the event by television star and singer [[Karylle]].&lt;ref name="Karylle"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.uplb.edu.ph/index.php/news/71-karylle-breathes-life-into-mariang-makiling-in-arts-fest|title=Karylle breathes life into Mariang Makiling in arts fest|accessdate=2009-06-14|publisher=University of the Philippines Los Baños|year=2009|author=UPLB Office of Public Relations|work=UPLB: News|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026160429/http://www.uplb.edu.ph/index.php/news/71-karylle-breathes-life-into-mariang-makiling-in-arts-fest|archivedate=2009-10-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Says Renowned theater director and UPAA Board Public Relations Director Behn Cervantes:&lt;ref name="Cervantes"/&gt; ''Karylle was chosen by the organizers for her graceful demeanor and sweet image, her expressive eyes, and her luxuriant wavy hair that typifies long-held descriptions of Maria Makiling.''
*Maria Makiling features significantly in Karen Francisco's novel "Naermyth", a fantasy adventure novel set in a post-apocalyptic Philippines, where creatures of lore, folktales and the once-mythical waged a war that led to the human race's downfall. In the novel, the diwata are neutral in the war between men and naermyth, and Makiling is a major figure among them.
*The character "Salome" (played by [[Mara Lopez]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interaksyon.com/entertainment/video-cinemalayas-debosyon-depicts-mysterious-link-between-love-and-faith/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160516150417/http://www.interaksyon.com/entertainment/video-cinemalayas-debosyon-depicts-mysterious-link-between-love-and-faith/ |archivedate=2016-05-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) in [[Vim Yapan]]'s 2013 film "Debosyon" incorporates the legend of Mariang Makiling, along with other prominent diwata from Philippine myths, such as Mariang Sinukuan, linking them to the legends of [[Daragang Magayon]] and to the mythos of the [[Our Lady of Peñafrancia|Virgin of Peñafrancia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://news.abs-cbn.com/lifestyle/07/31/13/cinemalaya-review-debosyon-more-love-story&lt;/ref&gt;  At one point in the script the character acknowledges herself as the personification of the mythical beings, Makiling named among them, throughout the Philippine archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI-vbfoFFE&lt;/ref&gt;

*A fictionalized version of Makiling was also portrayed in the 2018 Television Series [[Bagani (TV series)|Bagani]] by [[Maricar Reyes|Maricar Reyes-Poon]]

A '''microburst''' is an intense small-scale [[downdraft]] produced by a [[thunderstorm]] or rain shower. There are two types of microbursts: wet microbursts and dry microbursts. They go through three stages in their cycle, the downburst, outburst, and cushion stages also called "Suriano's Stroke".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.weather.gov/bmx/outreach_microbursts|title=What is a Microburst?|date=n.d.|website=[[National Weather Service]]|access-date=March 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A microburst can be particularly dangerous to [[aircraft]], especially during landing, due to the [[wind shear]] caused by its [[gust front]].  Several fatal and historic crashes have been attributed to the phenomenon over the past several decades, and [[flight crew]] training goes to great lengths on how to properly recover from a microburst/wind shear event.

A microburst often has high [[wind]]s that can knock over fully grown trees. They usually last for seconds to minutes.

== History of term ==
The term was defined by [[mesoscale meteorology]] expert [[Ted Fujita]] as affecting an area {{convert|4|km|abbr=on}} in diameter or less, distinguishing them as a type of [[downburst]] and apart from common wind shear which can encompass greater areas.&lt;ref&gt;Glossary of Meteorology. [http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=microburst&amp;submit=Search Microburst.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212043551/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=microburst&amp;submit=Search |date=2008-12-12 }} Retrieved on 2008-07-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Fujita also coined the term macroburst for downbursts larger than {{convert|4|km|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Glossary of Meteorology. [http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=macroburst&amp;submit=Search Macroburst.] Retrieved on 2008-07-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinction can be made between a wet microburst which consists of [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and a dry microburst which typically consists of [[virga]].&lt;ref name="micro"&gt;Fernando Caracena, Ronald L. Holle, and Charles A. Doswell III. [http://www.cimms.ou.edu/~doswell/microbursts/Handbook.html Microbursts: A Handbook for Visual Identification.] Retrieved on 2008-07-09.&lt;/ref&gt; They generally are formed by precipitation-cooled air rushing to the surface, but they perhaps also could be powered by strong winds aloft being deflected toward the surface by dynamical processes in a thunderstorm (see [[rear flank downdraft]]).

=== Dry microbursts ===
[[File:Drymicroburst.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|Dry microburst schematic]]
When rain falls below the [[cloud base]] or is mixed with dry air, it begins to evaporate and this evaporation process cools the air. The cool air descends and accelerates as it approaches the ground. When the cool air approaches the ground, it spreads out in all directions. High winds spread out in this type of pattern showing little or no curvature are known as [[straight-line wind]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Glossary of Meteorology. [http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=straight&amp;submit=Search Straight-line wind.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415101545/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=straight&amp;submit=Search |date=2008-04-15 }} Retrieved on 2008-08-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dry microbursts produced by high based thunderstorms that generate little to no surface rainfall, occur in environments characterized by a thermodynamic profile exhibiting an inverted-V at thermal and moisture profile, as viewed on a [[Skew-T log-P diagram|Skew-T log-P thermodynamic diagram]]. Wakimoto (1985) developed a conceptual model (over the [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]] of the United States) of a dry microburst environment that comprised three important variables: mid-level moisture, a deep and dry adiabatic [[lapse rate]] in the sub-cloud layer, and low surface [[relative humidity]].

=== Wet microbursts ===

Wet microbursts are downbursts accompanied by significant precipitation at the surface.&lt;ref name="fuj85"&gt;* [[Ted Fujita|Fujita, T.T.]] (1985). "The Downburst, microburst and macroburst". SMRP Research Paper 210, 122 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; These downbursts rely more on the drag of precipitation for downward acceleration of [[Air parcel|parcels]] as well as the negative buoyancy which tend to drive "dry" microbursts. As a result, higher [[mixing ratio]]s are necessary for these downbursts to form (hence the name "wet" microbursts). Melting of ice, particularly [[hail]], appears to play an important role in downburst formation (Wakimoto and Bringi, 1988), especially in the lowest {{convert|1|km|abbr=on}} above ground level (Proctor, 1989). These factors, among others, make [[Weather forecasting|forecasting]] wet microbursts difficult.

== Development stages of microbursts ==
The evolution of microbursts is broken down into three stages: the contact stage, the outburst stage, and the cushion stage.

&lt;gallery class="center" style="font-size: small;" widths="250" heights="225" classes="center" styles="font-size: small;"&gt;
File:Contact stage.svg|A downburst initially develops as the downdraft begins its descent from the cloud base. The downdraft accelerates, and within minutes reaches the ground (contact stage).
File:Outburststage.jpg|During the outburst stage, the wind "curls" as the cold air of the downburst moves away from the point of impact with the ground.
File:Cushionstage.jpg|During the cushion stage, winds about the curl continue to accelerate, while the winds at the surface slow due to friction.&lt;ref&gt;[[University of Illinois]] – Urbana Champaign.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Physical processes of dry and wet microbursts ==
{{Expert-subject|meteorology|date=February 2009}}

[[File:Microburst crosssection (vectored).svg|center|500px]]

=== Basic physical processes using simplified buoyancy equations ===
Start by using the [[primitive equations|vertical momentum equation]]:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;{dw\over dt} = -{1\over\rho} {\partial p\over\partial z}-g&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

By decomposing the variables into a basic state and a [[perturbation theory|perturbation]], defining the basic states, and using the [[ideal gas law]] (&lt;math&gt;p = \rho RT_v&lt;/math&gt;), then the equation can be written in the form

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;B \equiv -{\rho^\prime\over\bar\rho}g = g{T^\prime_v - \bar T_v \over \bar T_v}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where B is [[buoyancy]]. The [[virtual temperature]] correction usually is rather small and to a good approximation; it can be ignored when computing buoyancy. Finally, the effects of precipitation loading on the vertical motion are [[Parametrization|parametrized]] by including a term that decreases buoyancy as the liquid water mixing ratio (&lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;) increases, leading to the final form of the parcel's momentum equation:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;{dw^\prime\over dt} = {1\over\bar\rho}{\partial p^\prime\over\partial z} + B - g\ell&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The first term is the effect of perturbation pressure gradients on vertical motion. In some storms this term has a large effect on [[updraft]]s (Rotunno and Klemp, 1982) but there is not much reason to believe it has much of an impact on [[downdraft]]s (at least to a first approximation) and therefore will be ignored.

The second term is the effect of buoyancy on vertical motion. Clearly, in the case of microbursts, one expects to find that B is negative meaning the parcel is cooler than its environment. This cooling typically takes place as a result of [[Phase transition|phase changes]] ([[evaporation]], [[melting]], and [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]]). Precipitation particles that are small, but are in great quantity, promote a maximum contribution to cooling and, hence, to creation of negative buoyancy. The major contribution to this process is from evaporation.

The last term is the effect of water loading. Whereas evaporation is promoted by large numbers of small droplets, it only requires a few large [[Drop (liquid)|drops]] to contribute substantially to the downward acceleration of air parcels. This term is associated with storms having high precipitation rates. Comparing the effects of water loading to those associated with buoyancy, if a parcel has a liquid water mixing ratio of 1.0 [[Gram|g]] [[Kilogram|kg]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, this is roughly equivalent to about 0.3 [[Kelvin|K]] of negative buoyancy; the latter is a large (but not extreme) value. Therefore, in general terms, negative buoyancy is typically the major contributor to downdrafts.&lt;ref name="Chuck"&gt;Charles A. Doswell III. [http://www.cimms.ou.edu/~doswell/barcelona/Barcelona_Wind.html Extreme Convective Windstorms: Current Understanding and Research.] Retrieved on 2008-08-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Negative vertical motion associated only with buoyancy ===
Using pure "parcel theory" results in a prediction of the maximum downdraft of

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;-w_{\rm max} = \sqrt{2\times\hbox{NAPE}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where NAPE is the negative [[Convective available potential energy|available potential energy]],

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hbox{NAPE} = -\int_{\rm SFC}^{\rm LFS} B\,dz&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

and where LFS denotes the level of free sink for a descending parcel and SFC denotes the surface. This means that the maximum downward motion is associated with the [[Integral|integrated]] negative buoyancy. Even a relatively modest negative buoyancy can result in a substantial downdraft if it is maintained over a relatively large depth. A downward speed of {{convert|25|m/s|mi/h km/h|abbr=on}} results from the relatively modest NAPE value of 312.5 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;. To a first approximation, the maximum gust is roughly equal to the maximum downdraft speed.&lt;ref name="Chuck" /&gt;

A microburst often causes aircraft to crash when they are attempting to land (the above-mentioned BOAC and Pan Am flights are notable exceptions). The microburst is an extremely powerful gust of air that, once hitting the ground, spreads in all directions. As the aircraft is coming in to land, the pilots try to slow the plane to an appropriate speed.  When the microburst hits, the pilots will see a large spike in their airspeed, caused by the force of the headwind created by the microburst. A pilot inexperienced with microbursts would try to decrease the speed. The plane would then travel through the microburst, and fly into the tailwind, causing a sudden decrease in the amount of air flowing across the wings. The decrease in airflow over the wings of the aircraft causes a drop in the amount of lift produced. This decrease in lift combined with a strong downward flow of air can cause the thrust required to remain at altitude to exceed what is available, thus causing the aircraft to stall.&lt;ref name="NASA" /&gt; If the plane is at a low altitude shortly after takeoff or during landing, it will not have sufficient altitude to recover.

The strongest microburst recorded thus far occurred at Andrews Field, Maryland on August 1st 1983, with wind speeds reaching 240.5 km/h (149.5 mi/h).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guinness Book of World Records 2014|last=Glenday|first=Craig|publisher=The Jim Pattinson Group|year=2013|isbn=978-1-908843-15-9|location=|pages=20|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3332">[[File:Pothigai Hills Range.jpg|thumb|[[Pothigai|Pothigai Malai]] in [[Tamil Nadu]], proposed to be the original Mount Potalaka in [[India]]]]

'''Mount Potalaka''' ({{zh|t=補陀洛伽山 or 普陀洛迦山 |s=补陀洛伽山 or 普陀洛伽山|p=Bǔtuóluòjiā Shān or Pǔtuóluòjiā Shān}}, [[Japanese language|Japanese]]: 補陀洛 ''Fudaraku-san''), which means "Brilliance",&lt;ref&gt;Lokesh CHANDRA, ''The Thousand-Armed Avalokiteśvara'', New Delhi: Abdhinav Publications/ Indira Gandhi National Center for the Arts, 1988, p. 35;&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[mythical]] dwelling of the Buddhist [[bodhisattva]] [[Avalokiteśvara]], said to exist in the seas south of [[India]].

== Origins ==
The mountain is first mentioned in the final chapter of the ''[[Avatamsaka Sutra|Avataṃsaka Sūtra]]'', the ''[[Avatamsaka Sutra#The Gandavyuha Sutra|Gaṇḍavyūha Sūtra]]'', where the chapter's protagonist journeys to seek the advice of Avalokiteśvara.

The [[Japan]]ese scholar Shu Hikosaka, on the basis of his study of Buddhist scriptures, ancient [[Tamil language|Tamil]] literary sources, as well as field survey, proposes the hypothesis that, the ancient mount Potalaka, the residence of Avalokiteśvara described in the ''Gaṇḍavyūha Sūtra'' and [[Xuanzang]]’s ''[[Great Tang Records on the Western Regions]]'', is the real mountain [[Pothigai|Potikai or Potiyil]] situated at [[Ambasamudram]] in [[Tirunelveli]] district, [[Tamil Nadu]].&lt;ref name=Shu&gt;
Hikosaka, Shu. "The Potiyil Mountain in Tamil Nadu and the Origin of the Avalokiteśvara Cult." Buddhism in Tamil Nadu: Collected Papers. Chennai, India: Institute of Asian Studies, 1998. 119-41.&lt;/ref&gt; Shu also says that mount Potiyil / Potalaka has been a sacred place for the people of South India from time immemorial.&lt;ref name=Shu /&gt;

With the spread of Buddhism in the region beginning at the time of the great king [[Ashoka|Aśoka]] in the third century BCE, it became a holy place also for Buddhists who gradually became dominant as a number of their hermits settled there. The local people, though, mainly remained followers of [[Hinduism]]. The mixed Hindu-Buddhist cult culminated in the formation of the figure of Avalokiteśvara.&lt;ref name=ML&gt;{{cite news | first=Märt | last=Läänemets | title= Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara in the Gandavyuha Sutra

== Local traditions ==
[[File:Model of Putuo Shan island.JPG|thumb|Model of [[Mount Putuo]] island]]

Later Japanese Buddhists, such as the Japanese [[Yogacara]] [[bhikkhu|monk]] [[Jōkei (monk)|Jōkei]], espoused aspiring rebirth on Mount Potalaka as an easier way to attain progress on the Buddhist path than the more well-known [[pure land]] of [[Amitābha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ford | first = James L. | title = Jokei and Buddhist Devotion in Early Medieval Japan | publisher = Oxford University Press, USA | year = 2006 | isbn = 0-19-518814-4 | pages=47–50, 101–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ocean reanalysis''' is a method of combining historical [[ocean observations]] with a general ocean model (typically a [[computational model]]) driven by historical estimates of surface winds, heat, and freshwater, by way of a [[data assimilation]] [[algorithm]] to reconstruct historical changes in the state of the ocean.

Historical observations are sparse and insufficient for understanding the history of the ocean and its circulation. By utilizing data assimilation techniques in combination with advanced computational models of the global ocean, researchers are able to [[Interpolation|interpolate]] the historical observations to all points in the ocean.  This process has an analog in the construction of atmospheric reanalysis and is closely related to ocean state estimation.

==Current projects==
A number of efforts have been initiated in recent years to apply data assimilation to estimate the physical state of the ocean, including [[Sea surface temperature|temperature]], [[salinity]], [[Ocean currents|currents]], and [[sea level]], in recent years.&lt;ref name="carton"&gt;Carton, J.A., and A. Santorelli, 2008: Global upper ocean heat content as viewed in nine analyses, J. Clim., 21, 6015–6035.&lt;/ref&gt;  There are three alternative state estimation approaches.  The first approach is used by the ‘no-model’ analyses, for which temperature or salinity observations update a first guess provided by [[climatological]] monthly estimates.

The second approach is that of the sequential data assimilation analyses, which move forward in time from a previous analysis using a numerical simulation of the evolving temperature and other variables produced by an [[ocean general circulation model]].  The simulation provides the first guess of the state of the ocean at the next analysis time, while corrections are made to this first guess based on observations of variables such as temperature, salinity, or sea level.

The third approach is 4D-Var, which in the implementation described uses the initial conditions and surface forcing as control variables to be modified in order to be consistent with the observations as well as a numerical representation of the equations of motion through iterative solution of a giant optimization problem.

==Methodologies==
===No-model approach===
ISHII and LEVITUS begin with a first guess of the climatological monthly upper-ocean temperature based on climatologies produced by the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] [[National Oceanographic Data Center]]. The innovations are mapped onto the analysis levels.  ISHII uses and alternative 3DVAR approach to do an objective mapping with a smaller decorrelation scale in midlatitudes (300&amp;nbsp;km) that elongates in the zonal direction by a factor of 3 at equatorial latitudes.  LEVITUS begins similarly to ISHII, but uses the technique of Cressman and Barnes with a homogeneous scale of 555&amp;nbsp;km to objectively map the temperature innovation onto a uniform grid.

===Sequential approaches===

The sequential approaches can be further divided into those using Optimal Interpolation and its more sophisticated cousin the [[Kalman Filter]], and those using 3D-Var.  Among those mentioned above, INGV and [[Simple Ocean Data Assimilation|SODA]] use versions of Optimal Interpolation.  CERFACS, GODAS, and GFDL all use 3DVar.  "To date we are unaware of any attempt to use Kalman Filter for multi-decadal ocean reanalyses." &lt;ref name="carton" /&gt; The 4-Dimensional Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (4D-LETKF) has been applied to the [[Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory]]'s (GFDL) [[Modular Ocean Model]] (MOM2) for a 7-year ocean reanalysis from January 1997 – 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, B.R., Kostelich E.J., Szunyogh, I. Efficient Data Assimilation for Spatiotemporal Chaos: A Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter. arXiv:physics/0511236 v1 28 Nov 2005. Dated May 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variational (4D-Var) approach===
One innovative attempt by GECCO has been made to apply 4D-Var to the decadal ocean estimation problem. This approach faces daunting computational challenges, but provides some interesting benefits including satisfying some conservation laws and the construction of the ocean model adjoint.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25392">[[Image:Taxus wood.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Wood is an example of an orthotropic material. Material properties in three perpendicular directions (axial, radial, and circumferential) are different.]]
In [[material science]] and [[solid mechanics]], '''orthotropic materials''' have material properties that differ along three mutually-[[orthogonal]] twofold axes of [[rotational symmetry]]. They are a subset of [[anisotropy|anisotropic materials]], because their properties change when measured from different directions.

A familiar example of an orthotropic material is [[wood]]. In wood, one can define three mutually perpendicular directions at each point in which the properties are different.  These are the axial direction (along the grain), the radial direction, and the circumferential direction.  Because the preferred [[coordinate system]] is cylindrical-polar, this type of orthotropy is also called '''polar orthotropy'''. Mechanical properties, such as strength and stiffness, measured axially (along the grain) are typically better than those measured in the radial and circumferential directions (across the grain). These directional differences in strength can be quantified with [[Hankinson's equation]].

Another example of an orthotropic material is [[sheet metal]] formed by squeezing thick sections of metal between heavy rollers. This flattens and stretches its [[grain structure]]. As a result, the material becomes [[anisotropic]]—its properties differ between the direction it was rolled in and each of the two transverse directions.

If orthotropic properties vary between points inside an object, it possesses both orthotropy and [[inhomogeneous|inhomogeneity]]. This suggests that orthotropy is the property of a point within an object rather than for the object as a whole (unless the object is homogeneous).  The associated planes of symmetry are also defined for a small region around a point and do not necessarily have to be identical to the planes of symmetry of the whole object.

Orthotropic materials are a subset of [[anisotropy|anisotropic materials]]; their properties  depend on the direction in which they are measured. Orthotropic materials have three planes/axes of symmetry.  An [[isotropic]] material, in contrast, has the same properties in every direction. It can be proved that a material having two planes of symmetry must have a third one. Isotropic materials have an infinite number of planes of symmetry.

'''[[Transverse isotropy|Transversely isotropic]]''' materials are special orthotropic materials that have one axis of symmetry (any other pair of axes that are perpendicular to the main one and orthogonal among themselves are also axes of symmetry). One common example of transversely isotropic material with one axis of symmetry is a polymer reinforced by parallel glass or graphite fibers. The strength and stiffness of such a composite material will usually be greater in a direction parallel to the fibers than in the transverse direction, and the thickness direction usually has properties similar to the transverse direction. Another example would be a biological membrane, in which the properties in the plane of the membrane will be different from those in the perpendicular direction. Orthotropic material properties have been shown to provide a more accurate representation of bone's elastic symmetry and can also give information about the three-dimensional directionality of bone's tissue-level material properties.&lt;ref name=Gera&gt;Geraldes DM et al, 2014, '''A comparative study of orthotropic and isotropic bone adaptation in the femur''', International Journal for Numerical Methods in Biomedical Engineering, Volume 30, Issue 9, pages 873–889,  DOI: 10.1002/cnm.2633, http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1002/cnm.2633/full&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to keep in mind that a material which is anisotropic on one length scale may be isotropic on another (usually larger) length scale. For instance, most metals are polycrystalline with very small [[Crystallite|grains]]. Each of the individual grains may be anisotropic, but if the material as a whole comprises many randomly oriented grains, then its measured mechanical properties will be an average of the properties over all possible orientations of the individual grains.

== Orthotropy in physics ==

=== Anisotropic material relations  ===
Material behavior is represented in physical theories by [[constitutive relation]]s.  A large class of physical behaviors can be represented by linear material models that take the form of a second-order [[tensor]].  The material tensor provides a relation between two [[Euclidean vector|vector]]s and can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{f} = \boldsymbol{K}\cdot\mathbf{d}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{d},\mathbf{f}&lt;/math&gt; are two vectors representing physical quantities and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{K}&lt;/math&gt; is the second-order material tensor.  If we express the above equation in terms of components with respect to an [[orthonormal]] [[coordinate system]], we can write
:&lt;math&gt;
   f_i = K_{ij}~d_j ~.
 &lt;/math&gt;
[[Einstein notation|Summation over repeated indices]] has been assumed in the above relation.  In matrix form we have
:&lt;math&gt;
   \underline{\mathbf{f}} = \underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{K}}}~\underline{\mathbf{d}}
  \implies \begin{bmatrix} f_1\\f_2\\f_3 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} K_{11} &amp; K_{12} &amp; K_{13} \\ K_{21} &amp; K_{22} &amp; K_{23} \\
      K_{31} &amp; K_{32} &amp; K_{33} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} d_1\\d_2\\d_3 \end{bmatrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;
Examples of physical problems that fit the above template are listed in the table below.&lt;ref name=Milton&gt;Milton, G. W., 2002, '''The Theory of Composites''', Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Condition for material symmetry ===
The material matrix &lt;math&gt;\underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{K}}}&lt;/math&gt; has a symmetry with respect to a given [[orthogonal transformation]] (&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}&lt;/math&gt;) if it does not change when subjected to that transformation.  
For invariance of the material properties under such a transformation we require
:&lt;math&gt;
  \boldsymbol{A}\cdot\mathbf{f} = \boldsymbol{K}\cdot(\boldsymbol{A}\cdot\boldsymbol{d}) \implies \mathbf{f} = (\boldsymbol{A}^{-1}\cdot\boldsymbol{K}\cdot\boldsymbol{A})\cdot\boldsymbol{d} 
 &lt;/math&gt;
Hence the condition for material symmetry is (using the definition of an orthogonal transformation)
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{K} = \boldsymbol{A}^{-1}\cdot\boldsymbol{K}\cdot\boldsymbol{A} = \boldsymbol{A}^{T}\cdot\boldsymbol{K}\cdot\boldsymbol{A}
 &lt;/math&gt;
Orthogonal transformations can be represented in Cartesian coordinates by a &lt;math&gt;3\times 3&lt;/math&gt; matrix &lt;math&gt;\underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{A}}}&lt;/math&gt; given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   \underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{A}}} = \begin{bmatrix} A_{11} &amp; A_{12} &amp; A_{13} \\ A_{21} &amp; A_{22} &amp; A_{23} \\
      A_{31} &amp; A_{32} &amp; A_{33} \end{bmatrix}~.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Therefore the symmetry condition can be written in matrix form as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{K}}} = \underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{A}^T}}~\underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{K}}}~\underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{A}}}
 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Orthotropic material properties ===
An orthotropic material has three [[orthogonal]] [[plane of symmetry|symmetry plane]]s.  If we choose an orthonormal coordinate system such that the axes coincide with the normals to the three symmetry planes, the transformation matrices are
:&lt;math&gt;
   \underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{A}_1}} = \begin{bmatrix}-1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} ~;~~
   \underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{A}_2}} = \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} ~;~~
   \underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{A}_3}} = \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 \end{bmatrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;
It can be shown that if the matrix &lt;math&gt;\underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{K}}}&lt;/math&gt; for a material is invariant under reflection about two orthogonal planes then it is also invariant under reflection about the third orthogonal plane.

Consider the reflection &lt;math&gt;\underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{A}_3}}&lt;/math&gt; about the &lt;math&gt;1-2\,&lt;/math&gt; plane.  Then we have
:&lt;math&gt;
   \underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{K}}} = \underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{A}^T_3}}~\underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{K}}}~\underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{A}_3}} = \begin{bmatrix} K_{11} &amp; K_{12} &amp; -K_{13} \\ K_{21} &amp; K_{22} &amp; -K_{23} \\
      -K_{31} &amp; -K_{32} &amp; K_{33} \end{bmatrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The above relation implies that &lt;math&gt;K_{13} = K_{23} = K_{31} = K_{32} = 0&lt;/math&gt;.  Next consider a reflection &lt;math&gt;\underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{A}_2}}&lt;/math&gt; about the &lt;math&gt;1-3\,&lt;/math&gt; plane.  We then have
:&lt;math&gt;
   \underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{K}}} = \underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{A}^T_2}}~\underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{K}}}~\underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{A}_2}} = \begin{bmatrix} K_{11} &amp; -K_{12} &amp; 0 \\ -K_{21} &amp; K_{22} &amp; 0 \\
      0 &amp; 0 &amp; K_{33} \end{bmatrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;
That implies that &lt;math&gt;K_{12} = K_{21} = 0&lt;/math&gt;.  Therefore the material properties of an orthotropic material are described by the matrix
&lt;blockquote align="center" style="border: 1px solid black; padding:10px; width:300px"&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
  \underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{K}}} =  \begin{bmatrix} K_{11} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; K_{22} &amp; 0 \\
      0 &amp; 0 &amp; K_{33} \end{bmatrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Orthotropy in linear elasticity ==

=== Anisotropic elasticity ===
In [[linear elasticity]], the relation between [[stress (physics)|stress]] and [[infinitesimal strain theory|strain]] depend on the type of material under consideration.  This relation is known as [[Hooke's law]].  For anisotropic materials Hooke's law can be written as&lt;ref name=Lekh&gt;Lekhnitskii, S. G., 1963, '''Theory of Elasticity of an Anisotropic Elastic Body''', Holden-Day Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\sigma} = \mathsf{c}\cdot\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt; is the stress [[tensor]], &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt; is the strain tensor, and &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{c}&lt;/math&gt; is the elastic [[stiffness tensor]].  If the tensors in the above expression are described in terms of components with respect to an [[orthonormal]] [[coordinate system]] we can write
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{ij} = c_{ijk\ell}~ \varepsilon_{k\ell}&lt;/math&gt;
where summation has been assumed over repeated indices.  Since the stress and strain tensors are [[symmetric tensor|symmetric]], and since the stress-strain relation in linear elasticity can be derived from a [[strain energy density function]], the following symmetries hold for linear elastic materials
:&lt;math&gt;c_{ijk\ell} = c_{jik\ell} ~,~~c_{ijk\ell} = c_{ij\ell k} ~,~~ c_{ijk\ell} = c_{k\ell ij} ~.&lt;/math&gt;
Because of the above symmetries, the stress-strain relation for linear elastic materials can be expressed in matrix form as
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{bmatrix}\sigma_{11}\\ \sigma_{22} \\ \sigma_{33} \\ \sigma_{23} \\ \sigma_{31} \\ \sigma_{12} \end{bmatrix} = 
  \begin{bmatrix} c_{1111} &amp; c_{1122} &amp; c_{1133} &amp; c_{1123} &amp; c_{1131} &amp; c_{1112} \\
      c_{2211} &amp; c_{2222} &amp; c_{2233} &amp; c_{2223} &amp; c_{2231} &amp; c_{2212} \\
c_{3311} &amp; c_{3322} &amp; c_{3333} &amp; c_{3323} &amp; c_{3331} &amp; c_{3312} \\
c_{2311} &amp; c_{2322} &amp; c_{2333} &amp; c_{2323} &amp; c_{2331} &amp; c_{2312} \\
c_{3111} &amp; c_{3122} &amp; c_{3133} &amp; c_{3123} &amp; c_{3131} &amp; c_{3112} \\
c_{1211} &amp; c_{1222} &amp; c_{1233} &amp; c_{1223} &amp; c_{1231} &amp; c_{1212} 
   \end{bmatrix}
   \begin{bmatrix}\varepsilon_{11}\\ \varepsilon_{22} \\ \varepsilon_{33} \\ 2\varepsilon_{23} \\ 2\varepsilon_{31} \\ 2\varepsilon_{12} \end{bmatrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;
An alternative representation in [[Voigt notation]] is
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{bmatrix} \sigma_1 \\ \sigma_2 \\ \sigma_3 \\ \sigma_4 \\ \sigma_5 \\ \sigma_6 \end{bmatrix} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
  C_{11} &amp; C_{12} &amp; C_{13} &amp; C_{14} &amp; C_{15} &amp; C_{16} \\
C_{12} &amp; C_{22} &amp; C_{23} &amp; C_{24} &amp; C_{25} &amp; C_{26} \\
C_{13} &amp; C_{23} &amp; C_{33} &amp; C_{34} &amp; C_{35} &amp; C_{36} \\
C_{14} &amp; C_{24} &amp; C_{34} &amp; C_{44} &amp; C_{45} &amp; C_{46} \\
C_{15} &amp; C_{25} &amp; C_{35} &amp; C_{45} &amp; C_{55} &amp; C_{56} \\
C_{16} &amp; C_{26} &amp; C_{36} &amp; C_{46} &amp; C_{56} &amp; C_{66} \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix} \varepsilon_1 \\ \varepsilon_2 \\ \varepsilon_3 \\ \varepsilon_4 \\ \varepsilon_5 \\ \varepsilon_6 \end{bmatrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;
or 
:&lt;math&gt;
   \underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{\sigma}}} = \underline{\underline{\mathsf{C}}}~\underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The [[stiffness matrix]] &lt;math&gt;\underline{\underline{\mathsf{C}}}&lt;/math&gt; in the above relation satisfies [[point symmetry]].&lt;ref name=Slawinski&gt;Slawinski, M. A., 2010, '''Waves and Rays in Elastic Continua: 2nd Ed.''', World Scientific. http://samizdat.mines.edu/wavesandrays/WavesAndRays.pdf{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Condition for material symmetry ===
The stiffness matrix &lt;math&gt;\underline{\underline{\mathsf{C}}}&lt;/math&gt; satisfies a given symmetry condition if it does not change when subjected to the corresponding [[orthogonal transformation]].  The orthogonal transformation may represent symmetry with respect to a [[point symmetry|point]], an [[axis of symmetry|axis]], or a [[plane of symmetry|plane]].  Orthogonal transformations in linear elasticity include rotations and reflections, but not shape changing transformations and can be represented, in orthonormal coordinates, by a &lt;math&gt;3\times 3&lt;/math&gt; matrix &lt;math&gt;\underline{\underline{\mathbf{A}}}&lt;/math&gt; given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   \underline{\underline{\mathbf{A}}} = \begin{bmatrix} A_{11} &amp; A_{12} &amp; A_{13} \\ A_{21} &amp; A_{22} &amp; A_{23} \\
      A_{31} &amp; A_{32} &amp; A_{33} \end{bmatrix}~.
 &lt;/math&gt;
In Voigt notation, the transformation matrix for the '''stress tensor''' can be expressed as a &lt;math&gt;6\times6&lt;/math&gt; matrix &lt;math&gt;\underline{\underline{\mathsf{A}_\sigma}}&lt;/math&gt; given by&lt;ref name=Slawinski/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
   \underline{\underline{\mathsf{A}_\sigma}} = \begin{bmatrix} 
     A_{11}^2 &amp; A_{12}^2 &amp; A_{13}^2 &amp; 2A_{12}A_{13} &amp; 2A_{11}A_{13} &amp; 2A_{11}A_{12} \\
     A_{21}^2 &amp; A_{22}^2 &amp; A_{23}^2 &amp; 2A_{22}A_{23} &amp; 2A_{21}A_{23} &amp; 2A_{21}A_{22} \\
     A_{31}^2 &amp; A_{32}^2 &amp; A_{33}^2 &amp; 2A_{32}A_{33} &amp; 2A_{31}A_{33} &amp; 2A_{31}A_{32} \\
     A_{21}A_{31} &amp; A_{22}A_{32} &amp; A_{23}A_{33} &amp; A_{22}A_{33}+A_{23}A_{32} &amp; A_{21}A_{33}+A_{23}A_{31} &amp; A_{21}A_{32}+A_{22}A_{31} \\
     A_{11}A_{31} &amp; A_{12}A_{32} &amp; A_{13}A_{33} &amp; A_{12}A_{33}+A_{13}A_{32} &amp; A_{11}A_{33}+A_{13}A_{31} &amp; A_{11}A_{32}+A_{12}A_{31} \\
     A_{11}A_{21} &amp; A_{12}A_{22} &amp; A_{13}A_{23} &amp; A_{12}A_{23}+A_{13}A_{22} &amp; A_{11}A_{23}+A_{13}A_{21} &amp; A_{11}A_{22}+A_{12}A_{21} \end{bmatrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The transformation for the '''strain tensor''' has a slightly different form because of the choice of notation.  This transformation matrix is
:&lt;math&gt;
   \underline{\underline{\mathsf{A}_\varepsilon}} = \begin{bmatrix} 
     A_{11}^2 &amp; A_{12}^2 &amp; A_{13}^2 &amp; A_{12}A_{13} &amp; A_{11}A_{13} &amp; A_{11}A_{12} \\
     A_{21}^2 &amp; A_{22}^2 &amp; A_{23}^2 &amp; A_{22}A_{23} &amp; A_{21}A_{23} &amp; A_{21}A_{22} \\
     A_{31}^2 &amp; A_{32}^2 &amp; A_{33}^2 &amp; A_{32}A_{33} &amp; A_{31}A_{33} &amp; A_{31}A_{32} \\
     2A_{21}A_{31} &amp; 2A_{22}A_{32} &amp; 2A_{23}A_{33} &amp; A_{22}A_{33}+A_{23}A_{32} &amp; A_{21}A_{33}+A_{23}A_{31} &amp; A_{21}A_{32}+A_{22}A_{31} \\
     2A_{11}A_{31} &amp; 2A_{12}A_{32} &amp; 2A_{13}A_{33} &amp; A_{12}A_{33}+A_{13}A_{32} &amp; A_{11}A_{33}+A_{13}A_{31} &amp; A_{11}A_{32}+A_{12}A_{31} \\
     2A_{11}A_{21} &amp; 2A_{12}A_{22} &amp; 2A_{13}A_{23} &amp; A_{12}A_{23}+A_{13}A_{22} &amp; A_{11}A_{23}+A_{13}A_{21} &amp; A_{11}A_{22}+A_{12}A_{21} \end{bmatrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;
It can be shown that &lt;math&gt;\underline{\underline{\mathsf{A}_\varepsilon}}^T = \underline{\underline{\mathsf{A}_\sigma}}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;blockquote align="center" style="border: 1px solid black; padding:10px; width:500px"&gt;
The elastic properties of a continuum are invariant under an orthogonal transformation &lt;math&gt;\underline{\underline{\mathbf{A}}}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if&lt;ref name=Slawinski/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
   \underline{\underline{\mathsf{C}}} = \underline{\underline{\mathsf{A}_\varepsilon}}^T~\underline{\underline{\mathsf{C}}}~\underline{\underline{\mathsf{A}_\varepsilon}}
 &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Stiffness and compliance matrices in orthotropic elasticity ===
An orthotropic elastic material has three [[orthogonal]] [[plane of symmetry|symmetry plane]]s.  If we choose an orthonormal coordinate system such that the axes coincide with the normals to the three symmetry planes, the transformation matrices are
:&lt;math&gt;
   \underline{\underline{\mathbf{A}_1}} = \begin{bmatrix}-1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} ~;~~
   \underline{\underline{\mathbf{A}_2}} = \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} ~;~~
   \underline{\underline{\mathbf{A}_3}} = \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 \end{bmatrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;
We can show that if the matrix &lt;math&gt;\underline{\underline{\mathsf{C}}}&lt;/math&gt; for a linear elastic material is invariant under reflection about two orthogonal planes then it is also invariant under reflection about the third orthogonal plane.

If we consider the reflection &lt;math&gt;\underline{\underline{\mathbf{A}_3}}&lt;/math&gt; about the &lt;math&gt;1-2\,&lt;/math&gt; plane, then we have
:&lt;math&gt;
   \underline{\underline{\mathsf{A}_\varepsilon}} = \begin{bmatrix} 
     1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
     0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
     0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
     0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
     0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\
     0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
      \end{bmatrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;
Then the requirement &lt;math&gt;
   \underline{\underline{\mathsf{C}}} = \underline{\underline{\mathsf{A}_\varepsilon}}^T~\underline{\underline{\mathsf{C}}}~\underline{\underline{\mathsf{A}_\varepsilon}}
 &lt;/math&gt; implies that&lt;ref name=Slawinski/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
  C_{11} &amp; C_{12} &amp; C_{13} &amp; C_{14} &amp; C_{15} &amp; C_{16} \\
C_{12} &amp; C_{22} &amp; C_{23} &amp; C_{24} &amp; C_{25} &amp; C_{26} \\
C_{13} &amp; C_{23} &amp; C_{33} &amp; C_{34} &amp; C_{35} &amp; C_{36} \\
C_{14} &amp; C_{24} &amp; C_{34} &amp; C_{44} &amp; C_{45} &amp; C_{46} \\
C_{15} &amp; C_{25} &amp; C_{35} &amp; C_{45} &amp; C_{55} &amp; C_{56} \\
C_{16} &amp; C_{26} &amp; C_{36} &amp; C_{46} &amp; C_{56} &amp; C_{66} \end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
  C_{11} &amp; C_{12} &amp; C_{13} &amp; -C_{14} &amp; -C_{15} &amp; C_{16} \\
C_{12} &amp; C_{22} &amp; C_{23} &amp; -C_{24} &amp; -C_{25} &amp; C_{26} \\
C_{13} &amp; C_{23} &amp; C_{33} &amp; -C_{34} &amp; -C_{35} &amp; C_{36} \\
-C_{14} &amp; -C_{24} &amp; -C_{34} &amp; C_{44} &amp; C_{45} &amp; -C_{46} \\
-C_{15} &amp; -C_{25} &amp; -C_{35} &amp; C_{45} &amp; C_{55} &amp; -C_{56} \\
C_{16} &amp; C_{26} &amp; C_{36} &amp; -C_{46} &amp; -C_{56} &amp; C_{66} \end{bmatrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The above requirement can be satisfied only if
:&lt;math&gt;
  C_{14} = C_{15} = C_{24} = C_{25} = C_{34} = C_{35} = C_{46} = C_{56} = 0 ~.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Let us next consider the reflection &lt;math&gt;\underline{\underline{\mathbf{A}_2}}&lt;/math&gt; about the &lt;math&gt;1-3\,&lt;/math&gt; plane.  In that case
:&lt;math&gt;
   \underline{\underline{\mathsf{A}_\varepsilon}} = \begin{bmatrix} 
     1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
     0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
     0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
     0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
     0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
     0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1
      \end{bmatrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;
Using the invariance condition again, we get the additional requirement that
:&lt;math&gt;
  C_{16} = C_{26} = C_{36} = C_{45} = 0 ~.
 &lt;/math&gt;
No further information can be obtained because the reflection about third symmetry plane is not independent of reflections about the planes that we have already considered.  Therefore, the stiffness matrix of an orthotropic linear elastic material can be written as
&lt;blockquote align="center" style="border: 1px solid black; padding:10px; width:400px"&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\underline{\underline{\mathsf{C}}} = 
   \begin{bmatrix}
  C_{11} &amp; C_{12} &amp; C_{13} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
C_{12} &amp; C_{22} &amp; C_{23} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0  \\
C_{13} &amp; C_{23} &amp; C_{33} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0  &amp; C_{44} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0  &amp; 0 &amp; C_{55} &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0  &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; C_{66} \end{bmatrix} 
 &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The inverse of this matrix is commonly written as&lt;ref name=Boresi&gt;Boresi, A. P, Schmidt, R. J. and Sidebottom, O. M., 1993, ''Advanced Mechanics of Materials'', Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
  \underline{\underline{\mathsf{S}}} = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \tfrac{1}{E_{\rm 1}} &amp; - \tfrac{\nu_{\rm 21}}{E_{\rm 2}} &amp; - \tfrac{\nu_{\rm 31}}{E_{\rm 3}} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
    -\tfrac{\nu_{\rm 12}}{E_{\rm 1}} &amp; \tfrac{1}{E_{\rm 2}} &amp; - \tfrac{\nu_{\rm 32}}{E_{\rm 3}} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
    -\tfrac{\nu_{\rm 13}}{E_{\rm 1}} &amp; - \tfrac{\nu_{\rm 23}}{E_{\rm 2}} &amp; \tfrac{1}{E_{\rm 3}} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \tfrac{1}{G_{\rm 23}} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \tfrac{1}{G_{\rm 31}} &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \tfrac{1}{G_{\rm 12}} \\
    \end{bmatrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;{E}_{\rm i}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Young's modulus]] along axis &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;G_{\rm ij}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[shear modulus]] in direction &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; on the plane whose normal is in direction &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\nu_{\rm ij}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Poisson's ratio]] that corresponds to a contraction in direction &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; when an extension is applied in direction &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Bounds on the moduli of orthotropic elastic materials ===
The strain-stress relation for orthotropic linear elastic materials can be written in Voigt notation as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}} = \underline{\underline{\mathsf{S}}}~\underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{\sigma}}}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where the compliance matrix &lt;math&gt;\underline{\underline{\mathsf{S}}}&lt;/math&gt; is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   \underline{\underline{\mathsf{S}}} = 
   \begin{bmatrix}
  S_{11} &amp; S_{12} &amp; S_{13} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
S_{12} &amp; S_{22} &amp; S_{23} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0  \\
S_{13} &amp; S_{23} &amp; S_{33} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0  &amp; S_{44} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0  &amp; 0 &amp; S_{55} &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0  &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; S_{66} \end{bmatrix} 
 &lt;/math&gt;
The compliance matrix is [[symmetric matrix|symmetric]] and must be [[Positive-definite matrix|positive definite]] for the [[strain energy density function|strain energy density]] to be positive.  This implies from [[Sylvester's criterion]] that all the principal [[minor (linear algebra)|minor]]s of the matrix are positive,&lt;ref name=Ting&gt;Ting, T. C. T. and Chen, T., 2005, ''Poisson's ratio for anisotropic elastic materials can have no bounds,'', Q. J. Mech. Appl. Math., 58(1), pp. 73-82.&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., 
:&lt;math&gt;
   \Delta_k := \det(\underline{\underline{\mathsf{S}_k}}) &gt; 0
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\underline{\underline{\mathsf{S}_k}}&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;k\times k&lt;/math&gt; principal [[submatrix]] of &lt;math&gt;\underline{\underline{\mathsf{S}}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Then, 
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
   \Delta_1 &gt; 0  &amp; \implies \quad S_{11} &gt; 0 \\
   \Delta_2 &gt; 0  &amp; \implies \quad S_{11}S_{22} - S_{12}^2 &gt; 0 \\
   \Delta_3 &gt; 0  &amp; \implies \quad (S_{11}S_{22}-S_{12}^2)S_{33}-S_{11}S_{23}^2+2S_{12}S_{23}S_{13}-S_{22}S_{13}^2 &gt;0 \\
   \Delta_4 &gt; 0  &amp; \implies \quad S_{44}\Delta_3 &gt; 0 \implies S_{44} &gt; 0\\
   \Delta_5 &gt; 0  &amp; \implies \quad S_{44}S_{55}\Delta_3 &gt; 0 \implies S_{55} &gt; 0 \\
   \Delta_6 &gt; 0  &amp; \implies \quad S_{44}S_{55}S_{66}\Delta_3 &gt; 0 \implies S_{66} &gt; 0
  \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;
We can show that this set of conditions implies that&lt;ref name=Ting1&gt;{{citation|last=Ting|first=T. C. T.|year=1996|title=Positive definiteness of anisotropic elastic constants|journal=[[Mathematics &amp; Mechanics of Solids]]|volume=1|pages=301–314}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
  S_{11} &gt; 0 ~,~~ S_{22} &gt; 0 ~,~~ S_{33} &gt; 0 ~,~~ S_{44} &gt; 0 ~,~~ S_{55} &gt; 0 ~,~~ S_{66} &gt; 0
 &lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;
  E_1 &gt; 0 , E_2 &gt; 0, E_3 &gt; 0, G_{12} &gt; 0 , G_{23} &gt; 0, G_{13} &gt; 0
 &lt;/math&gt;
However, no similar lower bounds can be placed on the values of the Poisson's ratios &lt;math&gt;\nu_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Ting/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3972">'''Phytobiome''' is a term that relates to a [[plant]] (phyto) in a specific ecological area ([[biome]]). It includes the plant itself, the environment and all micro- and macro-[[organism]]s living in, on, or around the plant. These organisms include [[microbes]], [[animals]] and other plants. The environment includes the [[soil]], [[air]] and [[climate]]. Examples of ecological areas are fields, [[rangeland]]s, [[forest]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phytobiomesalliance.org/about/Pages/Phytobiomes.aspx|title=About Phytobiomes|website=Phytobiomes Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
In 2015 the [[American Phytopathological Society]] (APS) launched a research framework, the Phytobiomes Initiative, to facilitate the organization of research into phytobiome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Plant denizens get the big-science treatment|journal= Nature News|author=Heidi Ledford|date=6 July 2015|url=http://www.nature.com/news/plant-denizens-get-the-big-science-treatment-1.17920|doi=10.1038/523137a}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this effort, in 2016 it launched ''Phytobiomes'', an [[open-access journal]]. The journal focuses on transdisciplinary research that impacts the entire plant ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apsjournals.apsnet.org/page/aboutphytobiomes|title=Phytobiomes - An Open Access Transdisciplinary Journal of Sustainable Plant Productivity|website=APS Journals|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An overall research strategy has been published in the Phytobiomes Roadmap, a document developed by a group of scientific societies, companies, research institutes, and governmental agencies.

[[File:NPMS Gas Transmission and Hazardous Liquid Pipelines in the United States.jpg|thumb|A map of pipelines in the United States as of September, 2015. Red is hazardous liquid pipelines, including crude oil.]]
The '''Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration''' ('''PHMSA''') is a [[United States Department of Transportation]] agency created in 2004, responsible for developing and enforcing regulations for the safe, reliable, and environmentally sound operation of the US' 2.6&amp;nbsp;million mile pipeline transportation. It is responsible for nearly 1&amp;nbsp;million daily shipments of [[hazardous materials]] by land, sea, and air. It oversees the nation's pipeline infrastructure, which accounts for 64 percent of the energy commodities consumed in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transportation.house.gov/Media/File/Rail/20080625/SSM_RR_6-25-08.pdf |title=U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure: Hearing on Implementation of Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement, and Safety Act of 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325114950/https://transportation.house.gov/media/file/rail/20080625/ssm_rr_6-25-08.pdf |archive-date=2009-03-25 |access-date=2018-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Made up of the Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) and the Office of Hazardous Materials Safety (OHMS).

PHMSA was created within the U.S. DOT under the Norman Y. Mineta Research and Special Programs Improvement Act of 2004,&lt;ref name=statute118&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-118/html/STATUTE-118-Pg2423.htm|title=United States Statutes at Large, Volume 118, 108th Congress, 2nd Session|publisher=Gpo.gov|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which former United States President [[George W. Bush]] signed into law on November 30, 2004.

[[Howard R. Elliott]] was sworn into office in October 2017, and is the current Administrator. 

== Regulatory base==
The PHMSA enforces the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968({{USPL|90|481}}), which was enacted in response to the [[Richmond, Indiana explosion|Richmond, Indiana, explosion]], as well as the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Act of 1979 ({{USPL|96|129}}), the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002, the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Safety and Enforcement Act (PIPES) Act of 2006, the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (P.L. 112), regulations (49 CFR Parts 190-199) and other statutes.

==History==
Prior to 2005 the U.S. Department of Transportation had no focused research organization and no separately operating administration for pipeline safety and [[hazardous material]]s [[Transportation safety in the United States]]. The [[Norman Y. Mineta]] Research and Special Programs Improvement Act of 2004 provided these, with an opportunity to establish mode government budget and information practices in support of then president Bush's 'Management Agenda' initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/108th-congress/senate-bill/2952/text|title=Text - S.2952 - 108th Congress (2003-2004): Norman Y. Mineta Research and Special Programs Improvement Act|last=John|first=McCain,|date=2004-10-08|website=www.congress.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the Special Programs Act of 2004, PHMSA's hazmat and pipeline safety programs were housed within the Transportation Department's Research and Special Programs Administration, known as RSPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/research-and-special-programs-administration|title=Agencies - Research and Special Programs Administration|website=Federal Register|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Office of Hazardous Materials Safety (OHMS)==
OHMS oversees the transportation of [[dangerous goods|hazardous materials]] by air, rail, highway, and water, with the exception of bulk transportation of hazmat by vessel. OHMS promulgates a national safety program, which consists of:
evaluating safety risks, developing and enforcing standards for transporting hazardous materials, educating shippers and carriers, investigating hazmat incidents and failures, conducting research, providing grants to improve emergency response to incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phmsa.dot.gov/hazmat/about |title=PHMSA - About Hazmat |publisher=Phmsa.dot.gov |date=2008-04-30 |accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OHMS website includes OHM guidance documents, hazmat carriers' special permits and approvals information, reports and incidents summaries, penalty action reports, registration information and forms, the Emergency Response Guidebook for [[First Responder]]s, [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] requests, and the Hazardous Materials Emergency Preparedness (HMEP) grants program.

==Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS)==
OPS oversees the 2.3 million miles of the [[natural gas pipeline system in the United States]] and its hazardous liquid pipelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phmsa.dot.gov/pipeline/about |title=PHMSA - About Pipeline |publisher=Phmsa.dot.gov |date=2008-04-30 |accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{as of| May 2014}} about 80 percent of the funds states spend on pipeline safety comes from PHMSA.&lt;ref name=Strib /&gt;

Several agencies collaborate on the 'federal pipeline safety program', authorized through the fiscal year ending September 30,
2015 such as the [[Transportation Security Administration]],the [[Department of Homeland Security]], and the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]].&lt;ref name=CRS /&gt;

The Pipeline Risk Management Information System (PRIMIS) consists of integrity management programs originally created for transmission pipelines and has led to a reduced amount of pipeline accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/|title=Pipeline Risk Management Information System (PRIMIS)|publisher=Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration|date=n.d.|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2001 the Liquid Integrity Management Program (LIMP)came into law, followed by the 2003 Transmission Integrity Management Program (TIMP) and the 2008 Distribution Integrity Management Program (DIMP).{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The 'Accountable Pipeline Safety and Partnership Act of 1996' requires that OPS adopt rules requiring interstate gas pipeline operators to provide maps of their facilities to the governing body of each municipality, in which the pipeline is located. The National Pipeline Mapping System (NPMS) was removed for a number of months from public use after [[September 11 attacks|September&amp;nbsp;11]], due to security concerns. In 2012, it returned with restriction of use. National Pipeline Maps can still be bought from [[PennWell Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npms.phmsa.dot.gov/|title=NPMS – Home|publisher=Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2014, OPS and PMHSA respectively, have not set minimum qualifications for state inspectors, who lead inspection teams. In one state, for example, an inspector with less than one year's experience was allowed to lead inspections.&lt;ref name=DOT /&gt;

==Pipeline safety record==
In the years 1996-2015, Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) reported a total of 11,199 pipeline incidents{{efn|An incident is defined as:"(1) An event that involves a release of gas from a pipeline, or of liquefied natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, refrigerant gas, or gas from an LNG facility, and that results in one or more of the following consequences: (i) A death, or personal injury necessitating in-patient hospitalization; (ii) Estimated property damage of $50,000 or more, including loss to the operator and others, or both, but excluding cost of gas lost; (iii) Unintentional estimated gas loss of three million cubic feet or more; (2) An event that results in an emergency shutdown of an LNG facility. Activation of an emergency shutdown system for reasons other than an actual emergency does not constitute an incident. (3) An event that is significant in the judgment of the operator, even though it did not meet the criteria of paragraphs (1) or (2) of this definition."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hip.phmsa.dot.gov/Hip_Help/pdmpublic_incident_page_allrpt.pdf|title=Gas Distribution, Gas Gathering, Gas Transmission, and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Incidents|last=|first=|date=May 27, 2014|website=Oracle BI Interactive Dashboards - SC Incident Trend|publisher=Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration|access-date=November 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} in a system that includes a total of {{convert|2509667|mi|km}} of gas pipelines and {{convert|208494|mi|km}} of hazardous liquids pipelines in the United States as of 2015. 856 of those were considered "serious incidents",{{efn|Serious Incidents include a fatality or injury requiring in-patient hospitalization.}} 86 were serious incidents involving hazardous liquids pipelines.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.phmsa.dot.gov/pipeline/library/data-stats/pipelineincidenttrends |title=Pipeline Incident 20 Year Trends (All-Reported Incident 20 Year Trends) |website=hip.phmsa.dot.gov|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an average of approximately 560 incidents per year in the last 20 years for all types of pipelines. These incidents caused a total of 360 fatalities and 1,376 injuries.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; More recent data however reveals that pipeline incidents as well as the total number of releases has decreased by over 50% since PHMSA was created and pipelines now safely deliver over 99.999% of all shipments, the highest safety percentage of any transportation system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and-statistics/pipeline/pipeline-incident-20-year-trends|title=Pipeline Incident 20 Year Trends {{!}} PHMSA|website=www.phmsa.dot.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulatory failures==
The [[2010 San Bruno pipeline explosion]] of a [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company]] (PG&amp;E) gasline in [[San Bruno, California]], a suburb south of San Francisco, killed eight people, injured 58 and destroyed much of a subdivision. Investigators from the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] found weak state and federal oversight.&lt;ref name=NTSB&gt;{{cite web|title=Pacific Gas and Electric Company Natural Gas Transmission Pipeline Rupture and Fire|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/summary/PAR1101.html|work=NTSB Number: PAR-11-01|publisher=National Transportation Safety Board|accessdate=11 May 2014|format=Pipeline Accident Report|date=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The long term costs for pipeline inspection and safety upgrades will be borne at 55% by electricity rate payers per California Public Utilities Commission judgement&lt;ref name=AP&gt;{{cite news|last=Leff|first=Lisa|title=PG&amp;E customers to foot part of pipe safety costs|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/pge-rates-increase-pay-pipeline-costs|accessdate=12 May 2014|newspaper=Associated Press|date=Dec 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   On 1 April 2014 PG&amp;E was indicted in U.S. District Court, San Francisco, California, for multiple violations of the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 relating to its record keeping and pipeline "integrity management" practices.&lt;ref name=OIGSanBruno&gt;{{cite web|title=PG&amp;E Charged with Multiple Violations of the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act|url=http://www.justice.gov/usao/can/news/2014/2014_04_01_pge.charged.press.html|work=Press Release|publisher=Department of Justice|accessdate=11 May 2014|date=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the PHMSA came under criticism for not releasing a Canadian company’s plans for managing oil spills and estimating a worst-case scenario in the event its pipeline burst in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allgov.com/Controversies/ViewNews/US_Regulators_Refuse_to_Release_Spill_Hazard_Estimates_for_Pipeline_from_Canada_110209 |title=News - U.S. Regulators Refuse to Release Spill Hazard Estimates for Pipeline from Canada |publisher=AllGov |date=2011-02-09 |accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Then Transportation Secretary [[Ray LaHood]], who oversaw the pipeline agency, acknowledged weaknesses in the program and asked Congress to pass legislation that would increase penalties for negligent operators and authorize the hiring of additional inspectors.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Pipeline Spills Put Safeguards Under Scrutiny |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/10/business/energy-environment/agency-struggles-to-safeguard-pipeline-system.html?pagewanted=1&amp;src=recg|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal records showed that although the pipeline industry reported 25 percent fewer significant incidents from 2001 through 2010 than in the prior decade, the amount of hazardous liquids being spilled remained substantial. There were more than 100 significant spills each year, a trend that dates back more than 20&amp;nbsp;years. The percentage of dangerous liquids recovered by pipeline operators after a spill dropped considerably.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;

In 2013, PHMSA's Jeffrey Wiese told several hundred oil and gas pipeline compliance officers that his agency has "very few tools to work with", in enforcing safety rules, even after Congress in 2011 allowed it to impose higher fines on companies that cause major accidents. "Do I think I can hurt a major international corporation with a $2 million civil penalty? No," he said.&lt;ref&gt;http://insideclimatenews.org/news/20130911/exclusive-pipeline-safety-chief-says-his-regulatory-process-kind-dying&lt;/ref&gt; These comments reflect the growing trend toward creating industry standards, in order to "drive safety through the adoption of Safety Management Systems (SMS) in regulated communities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.transportation.gov/transition/phmsa-top-policy-issues|title=Pipelines and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration: Top Policy Issues|date=2017-01-27|work=US Department of Transportation|access-date=2018-04-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A May 2014 report by the [[Office of Inspector General for the Department of Transportation]]&lt;ref name=DOT&gt;{{cite web|title=PHMSA’s State Pipeline Safety Program Lacks Effective Management and Oversight|url=http://www.oig.dot.gov/library-item/6514|work=Audit AV-2014-041|publisher=Department of Transportation|accessdate=11 May 2014|author=Office of Inspector General|date=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; found the PHMSA did not ensure "that key state inspectors are properly trained, inspections are being conducted frequently enough and inspections target the most risky pipelines".&lt;ref name=Strib&gt;{{cite news|last=Lowy|first=Joan|title=Watchdog says federal agency fails to ensure states are overseeing gas, other pipeline safety|url=http://www.startribune.com/politics/national/258639841.html|accessdate=11 May 2014|newspaper=Star Tribune, AP|date=9 May 2014|quote=The federal effort is so riddled with weaknesses that it's not possible to ensure states are enforcing pipeline safety.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership==
At the end of FY2012, PHMSA employed 203 staff in total, including 135 inspection and enforcement staff.&lt;ref name=CRS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/homesec/R41536.pdf |work=Congressional Research Service Report for Congress |publisher=Congressional Research Service |author=Paul W.

In [[physics]], specifically [[relativistic quantum mechanics]] (RQM) and its applications to [[particle physics]], '''relativistic wave equations''' predict the behavior of [[particles]] at high [[energy|energies]] and [[velocity|velocities]] comparable to the [[speed of light]]. In the context of [[quantum field theory]] (QFT), the equations determine the dynamics of [[quantum field]]s.

The solutions to the equations, universally denoted as {{math|ψ}} or {{math|Ψ}} ([[Greek language|Greek]] [[Psi (letter)|psi]]), are referred to as "[[wave function]]s" in the context of RQM, and "[[field (physics)|field]]s" in the context of QFT. The equations themselves are called "wave equations" or "field equations", because they have the mathematical form of a [[wave equation]] or are generated from a [[Lagrangian density]] and the field-theoretic [[Euler–Lagrange equation]]s (see [[classical field theory]] for background).

In the [[Schrödinger picture]], the wave function or field is the solution to the [[Schrödinger equation]];

:&lt;math&gt; i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\psi = \hat{H} \psi&lt;/math&gt;

one of the [[Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics#Pictures of dynamics|postulates of quantum mechanics]]. All relativistic wave equations can be constructed by specifying various forms of the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian operator]] ''Ĥ'' describing the [[Physical system|quantum system]]. Alternatively, [[Richard Feynman|Feynman]]'s [[path integral formulation]] uses a Lagrangian rather than a Hamiltonian operator.

More generally – the modern formalism behind relativistic wave equations is [[Lorentz group]] theory, wherein the spin of the particle has a correspondence with the [[representations of the Lorentz group]].&lt;ref name="T Jaroszewicz, P.S Kurzepa"&gt;{{cite news

==History==

===Early 1920s: Classical and quantum mechanics===

The failure of [[classical mechanics]] applied to [[molecule|molecular]], [[atom]]ic, and [[Atomic nucleus|nuclear]] systems and smaller induced the need for a new mechanics: ''[[quantum mechanics]]''. The mathematical formulation was led by [[Louis de Broglie|De Broglie]], [[Niels Bohr|Bohr]], [[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger]], [[Wolfgang Pauli|Pauli]], and [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]], and others, around the mid-1920s, and at that time was analogous to that of classical mechanics. The [[Schrödinger equation]] and the [[Heisenberg picture]] resemble the classical [[equations of motion]] in the limit of large [[quantum number]]s and as the reduced [[Planck constant]] {{math|''ħ''}}, the quantum of [[action (physics)|action]], tends to zero. This is the [[correspondence principle]]. At this point, [[special relativity]] was not fully combined with quantum mechanics, so the Schrödinger and Heisenberg formulations, as originally proposed, could not be used in situations where the particles travel near the [[speed of light]], or when the number of each type of particle changes (this happens in real [[fundamental interaction|particle interaction]]s; the numerous forms of [[particle decay]]s, [[annihilation]], [[matter creation]], [[pair production]], and so on).

===Late 1920s: Relativistic quantum mechanics of spin-0 and spin-{{sfrac|1|2}} particles===

A description of quantum mechanical systems which could account for ''relativistic'' effects was sought for by many theoretical physicists; from the late 1920s to the mid-1940s.&lt;ref name="Esposito"&gt;{{cite journal | author = S. Esposito | year = 2011 | title = Searching for an equation: Dirac, Majorana and the others | arxiv = 1110.6878 | doi=10.1016/j.aop.2012.02.016 | volume=327 | journal=Annals of Physics | pages=1617–1644| bibcode=2012AnPhy.327.1617E }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first basis for [[relativistic quantum mechanics]], i.e. special relativity applied with quantum mechanics together, was found by all those who discovered what is frequently called the [[Klein–Gordon equation]]:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
-\hbar^2\frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial t^2} +(\hbar c)^2\nabla^2\psi = (mc^2)^2\psi \,,
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

by inserting the [[energy operator]] and [[momentum operator]] into the relativistic [[energy–momentum relation]]:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
E^2 - (pc)^2 = (mc^2)^2\,,
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

The solutions to ({{EquationNote|1}}) are [[scalar field]]s. The KG equation is undesirable due to its prediction of ''negative'' [[energy|energies]] and [[probability|probabilities]], as a result of the [[quadratic equation|quadratic]] nature of ({{EquationNote|2}}) – inevitable in a relativistic theory. This equation was initially proposed by Schrödinger, and he discarded it for such reasons, only to realize a few months later that its non-relativistic limit (what is now called the [[Schrödinger equation]]) was still of importance. Nevertheless, – ({{EquationNote|1}}) is applicable to spin-0 [[boson]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Particle Physics | edition = 3rd | author = B. R. Martin, G.Shaw | series =  Manchester Physics Series|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons|year = 2008| page = 3|isbn = 978-0-470-03294-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither the non-relativistic nor relativistic equations found by Schrödinger could predict the [[fine structure]] in the [[Hydrogen spectral series]]. The mysterious underlying property was ''spin''. The first two-dimensional ''spin matrices'' (better known as the [[Pauli matrices]]) were introduced by Pauli in the [[Pauli equation]]; the Schrödinger equation with a non-relativistic Hamiltonian including an extra term for particles in [[magnetic field]]s, but this was ''phenomenological''. [[Hermann Weyl|Weyl]] found a relativistic equation in terms of the Pauli matrices; the [[Weyl equation]], for ''massless'' spin-{{sfrac|1|2}} fermions. The problem was resolved by [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]] in the late 1920s, when he furthered the application of equation ({{EquationNote|2}}) to the [[electron]] – by various manipulations he factorized the equation into the form:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\left(\frac{E}{c} - \boldsymbol{\alpha}\cdot\mathbf{p} - \beta mc \right)\left(\frac{E}{c} + \boldsymbol{\alpha}\cdot\mathbf{p} + \beta mc \right)\psi=0 \,,
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3A}}}}

and one of these factors is the [[Dirac equation]] (see below), upon inserting the energy and momentum operators. For the first time, this introduced new four-dimensional spin matrices {{math|'''α'''}}  and {{math|''β''}} in a relativistic wave equation, and explained the fine structure of hydrogen. The solutions to ({{EquationNote|3A}}) are multi-component [[spinor field]]s, and each component satisfies ({{EquationNote|1}}). A remarkable result of spinor solutions is that half of the components describe a particle while the other half describe an [[antiparticle]]; in this case the electron and [[positron]]. The Dirac equation is now known to apply for all massive [[Spin (physics)|spin-{{sfrac|1|2}}]] [[fermion]]s. In the non-relativistic limit, the Pauli equation is recovered, while the massless case results in the Weyl equation.

Although a landmark in quantum theory, the Dirac equation is only true for spin-{{sfrac|1|2}} fermions, and still predicts negative energy solutions, which caused controversy at the time (in particular – not all physicists were comfortable with the "[[Dirac sea]]" of negative energy states).

===1930s–1960s: Relativistic quantum mechanics of higher-spin particles===

The natural problem became clear: to generalize the Dirac equation to particles with ''any spin''; both fermions and bosons, and in the same equations their [[antiparticle]]s (possible because of the [[spinor]] formalism introduced by Dirac in his equation, and then-recent developments in spinor calculus by [[Bartel Leendert van der Waerden|van der Waerden]] in 1929), and ideally with positive energy solutions.&lt;ref name="Esposito"/&gt;

This was introduced and solved by Majorana in 1932, by a deviated approach to Dirac. Majorana considered one "root" of ({{EquationNote|3A}}):

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\left(\frac{E}{c} + \boldsymbol{\alpha}\cdot\mathbf{p} - \beta mc \right)\psi=0 \,,
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3B}}}}

where {{math|ψ}} is a spinor field now with infinitely many components, irreducible to a finite number of [[tensor]]s or spinors, to remove the indeterminacy in sign. The [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] {{math|'''α'''}} and {{math|β}} are infinite-dimensional matrices, related to infinitesimal [[Lorentz transformation]]s. He did not demand that each component of {{EquationNote|3B}} to satisfy equation ({{EquationNote|2}}), instead he regenerated the equation using a [[Lorentz covariance|Lorentz-invariant]] [[action (physics)|action]], via the [[principle of least action]], and application of [[Lorentz group]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv | author = R. Casalbuoni | year = 2006 | title = Majorana and the Infinite Component Wave Equations | eprint = hep-th/0610252}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Bekaert, Traubenberg, Valenzuela"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=X. Bekaert |author2=M.R. Traubenberg |author3=M. Valenzuela | year = 2009 | title = An infinite supermultiplet of massive higher-spin fields | arxiv = 0904.2533 | doi=10.1088/1126-6708/2009/05/118 | volume=2009 | journal=Journal of High Energy Physics | page=118|bibcode=2009JHEP...05..118B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Majorana produced other important contributions that were unpublished, including wave equations of various dimensions (5, 6, and 16). They were anticipated later (in a more involved way) by de Broglie (1934), and Duffin, Kemmer, and Petiau (around 1938–1939) see [[Duffin–Kemmer–Petiau algebra]]. The Dirac–Fierz–Pauli formalism was more sophisticated than Majorana’s, as spinors were new mathematical tools in the early twentieth century, although Majorana’s paper of 1932 was difficult to fully understand; it took Pauli and Wigner some time to understand it, around 1940.&lt;ref name="Esposito"/&gt;

Dirac in 1936, and Fierz and Pauli in 1939, built equations from irreducible spinors {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}}, symmetric in all indices, for a massive particle of spin {{math|''n'' + ½}}  for integer {{math|''n''}} (see [[Van der Waerden notation]] for the meaning of the dotted indices):

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
p_{\gamma\dot{\alpha}}A_{\epsilon_1\epsilon_2\cdots\epsilon_n}^{\dot{\alpha}\dot{\beta}_1\dot{\beta}_2\cdots\dot{\beta}_n} = mcB_{\gamma\epsilon_1\epsilon_2\cdots\epsilon_n}^{\dot{\beta}_1\dot{\beta}_2\cdots\dot{\beta}_n}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4A}}}}

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
p^{\gamma\dot{\alpha}}B_{\gamma\epsilon_1\epsilon_2\cdots\epsilon_n}^{\dot{\beta}_1\dot{\beta}_2\cdots\dot{\beta}_n} = mcA_{\epsilon_1\epsilon_2\cdots\epsilon_n}^{\dot{\alpha}\dot{\beta}_1\dot{\beta}_2\cdots\dot{\beta}_n} 
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4B}}}}

where {{math|''p''}} is the momentum as a covariant spinor operator. For {{math|''n'' {{=}} 0}}, the equations reduce to the coupled Dirac equations and {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}} together transform as the original [[Dirac spinor]]. Eliminating either {{math|''A''}} or {{math|''B''}} shows that {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}} each fulfill ({{EquationNote|1}}).&lt;ref name="Esposito"/&gt;

In 1941, Rarita and Schwinger focussed on spin-{{frac|3|2}} particles and derived the [[Rarita–Schwinger equation]], including a [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] to generate it, and later generalized the equations analogous to spin {{math|''n'' + ½}} for integer {{math|''n''}}. In 1945, Pauli suggested Majorana's 1932 paper to [[Homi J. Bhabha|Bhabha]], who returned to the general ideas introduced by Majorana in 1932. Bhabha and Lubanski proposed a completely general set of equations by replacing the mass terms in ({{EquationNote|3A}}) and ({{EquationNote|3B}}) by an arbitrary constant, subject to a set of conditions which the wave functions must obey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=R.K. Loide |author2=I. Ots |author3=R.

Finally, in the year 1948 (the same year as [[Feynman]]'s [[path integral formulation]] was cast), [[Valentine Bargmann|Bargmann]] and [[Eugene Wigner|Wigner]] formulated the general equation for massive particles which could have any spin, by considering the Dirac equation with a totally symmetric finite-component spinor, and using Lorentz group theory (as Majorana did): the [[Bargmann–Wigner equations]].&lt;ref name="Esposito"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bargmann, V.|author2=Wigner, E.

Joos]] and [[Steven Weinberg]], the [[Joos–Weinberg equation]]. Various theorists at this time did further research in relativistic Hamiltonians for higher spin particles.&lt;ref name="T Jaroszewicz, P.S Kurzepa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="E.A. Jeffery 1978"&gt;

===1960s–present===

The relativistic description of spin particles has been a difficult problem in quantum theory. It is still an area of the present-day research because the problem is only partially solved; including interactions in the equations is problematic, and paradoxical predictions (even from the Dirac equation) are still present.&lt;ref name = "Bekaert, Traubenberg, Valenzuela"/&gt;

==Linear equations==

{{further|Linear differential equation}}

The following equations have solutions which satisfy the [[superposition principle]], that is, the wave functions are [[additive map|additive]].

Throughout, the standard conventions of [[tensor index notation]] and [[Feynman slash notation]] are used, including Greek indices which take the values 1, 2, 3 for the spatial components and 0 for the timelike component of the indexed quantities. The wave functions are denoted ''{{math|ψ}}'', and {{math|∂&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the components of the [[four-gradient]] operator.

In [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] equations, the [[Pauli matrices]] are denoted by ''{{math|σ&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt;}}'' in which {{math|''μ'' {{=}} 0, 1, 2, 3}}, where {{math|''σ''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the {{math|2 × 2}} [[identity matrix]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma^0 = \begin{pmatrix} 1&amp;0 \\ 0&amp;1 \\ \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

and the other matrices have their usual representations. The expression

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma^\mu \partial_\mu \equiv \sigma^0 \partial_0 + \sigma^1 \partial_1 + \sigma^2 \partial_2 + \sigma^3 \partial_3 &lt;/math&gt;

is a {{math|2 × 2}} [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] [[Operator (mathematics)|operator]] which acts on 2-component [[spinor field]]s.

The [[gamma matrices]] are denoted by ''{{math|γ&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt;}}'', in which again {{math|''μ'' {{=}} 0, 1, 2, 3}}, and there are a number of representations to select from. The matrix {{math|''γ''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;}} is ''not'' necessarily the {{math|4 × 4}} [[identity matrix]]. The expression

:&lt;math&gt;i\hbar \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu + mc \equiv i\hbar(\gamma^0 \partial_0 + \gamma^1 \partial_1 + \gamma^2 \partial_2 + \gamma^3 \partial_3) + mc \begin{pmatrix}1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\ 0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;0 \\ 0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0 \\ 0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

is a {{math|4 × 4}} [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] [[Operator (mathematics)|operator]] which acts on 4-component [[spinor field]]s.

Note that terms such as "{{math|''mc''}}" [[scalar multiplication|scalar multiply]] an [[identity matrix]] of the relevant [[Dimension (vector space)|dimension]], the common sizes are {{math|2 × 2}} or {{math|4 × 4}}, and are ''conventionally'' not written for simplicity.

===Linear gauge fields===

The [[Duffin–Kemmer–Petiau algebra#Duffin–Kemmer–Petiau equation|Duffin–Kemmer–Petiau equation]] is an alternative equation for spin-0 and spin-1 particles:
:&lt;math&gt;(i \hbar \beta^{a} \partial_a - m c) \psi = 0&lt;/math&gt;

==Constructing RWEs==

===Using 4-vectors and the energy–momentum relation===
{{main|Four vector|Energy–momentum relation}}

Start with the standard [[special relativity]] (SR) 4-vectors

:[[4-position]] &lt;math&gt;X^\mu = \mathbf{X} = (ct,\vec{\mathbf{x}})&lt;/math&gt;
:[[4-velocity]] &lt;math&gt;U^\mu = \mathbf{U} = \gamma(c,\vec{\mathbf{u}})&lt;/math&gt;
:[[4-momentum]] &lt;math&gt;P^\mu = \mathbf{P} = \left(\frac{E}{c},\vec{\mathbf{p}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:[[4-wavevector]] &lt;math&gt;K^\mu = \mathbf{K} = \left(\frac{\omega}{c},\vec{\mathbf{k}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:[[4-gradient]] &lt;math&gt;\partial^\mu = \mathbf{\partial} = \left(\frac{\partial_t}{c},-\vec{\mathbf{\nabla}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Note that each 4-vector is related to another by a [[Lorentz scalar]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U} = \frac{d}{d\tau} \mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the [[proper time]]
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P} = m_o \mathbf{U}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;m_o&lt;/math&gt; is the [[rest mass]]
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K} = (1/\hbar) \mathbf{P}&lt;/math&gt;, which is the [[4-vector]] version of the [[Planck–Einstein relation]] &amp; the [[de Broglie]] [[matter wave]] relation
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\partial} = -i \mathbf{K}&lt;/math&gt;, which is the [[4-gradient]] version of [[complex-valued]] [[plane waves]]

Now, just apply the standard Lorentz scalar product rule to each one:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U} \cdot \mathbf{U} = (c)^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P} \cdot \mathbf{P} = (m_o c)^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K} \cdot \mathbf{K} = \left(\frac{m_o c}{\hbar}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\partial} \cdot \mathbf{\partial} = \left(\frac{-i m_o c}{\hbar}\right)^2 = -\left(\frac{m_o c}{\hbar}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

The last equation is a fundamental quantum relation.

When applied to a Lorentz scalar field &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, one gets the Klein–Gordon equation, the most basic of the quantum relativistic wave equations.

:&lt;math&gt;[\mathbf{\partial} \cdot \mathbf{\partial} + \left(\frac{m_o c}{\hbar}\right)^2]\psi = 0&lt;/math&gt;: in 4-vector format

:&lt;math&gt;[\partial_\mu \partial^\mu + \left(\frac{m_o c}{\hbar}\right)^2]\psi = 0&lt;/math&gt;: in tensor format

:&lt;math&gt;[(\hbar \partial_{\mu} + i m_o c)(\hbar \partial^{\mu} -i m_o c)]\psi = 0&lt;/math&gt;: in factored tensor format

The [[Schrödinger equation]] is the low-velocity [[Limiting case (mathematics)|limiting case]] (''v''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''c'') of the [[Klein–Gordon equation]].

When the relation is applied to a four-vector field &lt;math&gt;A^\mu&lt;/math&gt; instead of a Lorentz scalar field &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, then one gets the [[Proca equation]] (in [[Lorenz gauge]]):

:&lt;math&gt;[\mathbf{\partial} \cdot \mathbf{\partial} + \left(\frac{m_o c}{\hbar}\right)^2]A^\mu = 0&lt;/math&gt;

If the rest mass term is set to zero (light-like particles), then this gives the free [[Maxwell equation]] (in [[Lorenz gauge]])

:&lt;math&gt;[\mathbf{\partial} \cdot \mathbf{\partial}]A^\mu = 0&lt;/math&gt;

===Representations of the Lorentz group===

Under a proper [[orthochronous]] [[Lorentz transformation]] {{math|''x'' → Λ''x''}} in [[Minkowski space]], all one-particle quantum states {{math|ψ&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt;}} of spin {{math|''j''}} with spin z-component {{math|σ}} locally transform under some [[Representation theory of the Lorentz group|representation]] {{math|''D''}} of the [[Lorentz group]]:&lt;ref name="Weinberg"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Weinberg, S.|journal=Phys.

where {{math|''D''(Λ)}} is some finite-dimensional representation, i.e. a matrix. Here {{math|ψ}} is thought of as a [[column vector]] containing components with the allowed values of {{math|σ}}. The [[quantum number]]s {{math|''j''}} and {{math|σ}} as well as other labels, continuous or discrete, representing other quantum numbers are suppressed. One value of {{math|σ}} may occur more than once depending on the representation. Representations with several possible values for {{math|''j''}} are considered below.

The [[Representation theory#Subrepresentations, quotients, and irreducible representations|irreducible representation]]s are labeled by a pair of half-integers or integers {{math|(''A'', ''B'')}}. From these all other representations can be built up using a variety of standard methods, like taking [[tensor product]]s and [[direct sum]]s. In particular, [[space-time]] itself constitutes a [[4-vector]] representation {{math|({{sfrac|1|2}}, {{sfrac|1|2}})}} so that {{math|Λ ∈ ''D'''&lt;sup&gt;(1/2, 1/2)&lt;/sup&gt;}}. To put this into context; [[Dirac spinor]]s transform under the {{math|({{sfrac|1|2}}, 0) ⊕ (0, {{sfrac|1|2}})}} representation. In general, the {{math|(''A'', ''B'')}} representation space has [[Linear subspace|subspace]]s that under the [[subgroup]] of spatial [[rotation]]s, [[SO(3)]], transform irreducibly like objects of spin ''j'', where each allowed value:

:&lt;math&gt;j = A + B, A + B - 1, ..., |A - B|,&lt;/math&gt;

occurs exactly once.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The representations {{math|''D''&lt;sup&gt;(''j'', 0)&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|''D''&lt;sup&gt;(0, ''j'')&lt;/sup&gt;}} can each separately represent particles of spin {{math|''j''}}. A state or quantum field in such a representation would satisfy no field equation except the Klein–Gordon equation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1212">'''Slaughter tapping''' is an obsolete method of extracting large quantities of [[latex|natural latex]] from [[rubber tree]]s in a forest environment. Prior to commercial exploitation of latex-bearing trees such as ''[[Hevea brasiliensis]]'' in the Amazon Basin and ''[[Funtumia elastica]]'' in the Congo, native populations limited harvesting to non-lethal tapping of the latex. However, with the rising demand for rubber worldwide in the late nineteenth century, [[debt slavery|debt-slave]] "hunters" began tapping more intensively, using ladders to extract as much latex as possible from all areas of the tree, killing the tree as a result. This "slaughter tapping" resulted in the destruction of all latex-bearing trees across large swathes of sub-Saharan Africa and South America. Eventually, the establishment of rubber [[plantation]]s in the [[Far East]] made "hunting" of naturally occurring rubber trees unprofitable, and the practice largely ceased in the early twentieth century.

'''Snake handling''' as a religious [[ritual|rite]] in the United States, also called '''serpent handling''', is observed in a small number of isolated churches, mostly in the [[United States]], usually characterized as [[rural]] and part of the [[Holiness movement]]. The practice began in the early 20th century in [[Appalachia]] and plays only a small part in the church service. Participants are either [[Holiness movement|Holiness]], [[Pentecostals]], [[Charismatics]], or other [[evangelicals]].

==History==
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:George Went Hensley preaching.JPG|200px|thumb|alt=A man preaching with one hand in the air, a woman next to him holds a Bible.|George Went Hensley preaching in 1947 outside a [[Hamilton County, Tennessee]] courthouse in which a snake-handling minister was on trial (from ''Taking Up Serpents: Snake Handlers of Eastern Kentucky'' by David L. Kimbrough)&lt;ref name="Kimbrough2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=David L. Kimbrough|title=Taking up serpents: snake handlers of eastern Kentucky|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Wq1s7ChmmIC|date=February 2002|publisher=Mercer University Press|pages=xiv, 37–51|isbn=978-0-86554-798-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] --&gt;

Many writers have attempted to designate [[George Went Hensley]] (1880–1955) as both the progenitor and popularizer of Appalachian religious snake handling,{{sfn|Hood and Williamson|2008|p=37}}{{sfn|Kimbrough|2002|p=191}} but his role in initiating the practice has been disputed by academic studies.{{sfn|Kimbrough|2002|p=191}} Kimbrough notes that claims of Hensley being the originator of snake handling are usually found to be unsubstantiated by research, and the origins of the observance are unclear.{{sfn|Kimbrough|2002|p=191}} Hood and Williamson similarly argue that the beginnings of Pentecostal snake handling rituals cannot be ascribed to a single person,{{sfn|Hood and Williamson|2008|p=37}} and that the observance arose independently on multiple occasions.{{sfn|Hood and Williamson|2008|p=38}}

Historians agree that Hensley helped spread Pentecostal snake handling throughout the southeast United States,{{sfn|Hood and Williamson|2008|p=38}} and that coverage of Hensley's ministry was influential in prompting various churches to include the practice in their services.{{sfn|Hood and Williamson|2008|p=41}} The media has focused on popular snake handlers such as Hensley, and the deaths of ministers due to snakebite have received particular attention.{{sfn|Hood and Williamson|2008|p=39}}

==George Went Hensley==
{{main article|George Went Hensley}}
George Went Hensley is often credited with introducing snake handling practices into the [[Church of God (Holiness)|Church of God Holiness]], an association of autonomous Christian Methodist congregations, founding the Dolly Pond Church of God in Birchwood, Tennessee, around 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of American Religions gives the year as 1909; the Encyclopedia of Religion in the South gives it as 1913.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/oct/13/religion.scienceandnature|title=Robert Winston: Why do we believe in God?|date=13 October 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later traveled the Southeast promoting the practice, eventually resigning his ministry to start the first [[holiness movement]] church to require snake handling as evidence of salvation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Robert Mapes|title=Vision of the Disinherited: The Making of American Pentecostalism|year=1979|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, New York; Oxford|page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hood, Jr.|first1=Ralph W.|last2=Williamson|first2=W. Paul|title=Them That Believe: The Power and the Meaning of the Christian Serpent-Handling Tradition|year=2008|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles, California|isbn=978-0-520-25587-6|pages=xiv, 37, 38}}&lt;/ref&gt; If believers truly had the Holy Spirit within them, Hensley argued, they should be able to handle rattlesnakes and any number of other venomous serpents. They should also be able to drink poison and suffer no harm whatsoever. Snake handling as a test or demonstration of faith became popular wherever Hensley traveled and preached in the small towns of Tennessee, Kentucky, the Carolinas, Virginia, Ohio, and Indiana. Sister-churches later sprang up throughout the [[Appalachia]]n region.{{sfn|Kimbrough|2002|p=}} In July 1955, Hensley died following a snakebite received during a service he was conducting in [[Altha, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[George Went Hensley#Death]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hensley's life was unusual for a clergyman. He had four wives (the first three marriages ended in divorce) and was frequently drunk. Practitioners of snake handling continue to view him as a great man. Kimbrough recorded a discussion with an advocate of snake handling who dismissed Hensley's personal failings as slanderous fabrications.{{sfn|Kimbrough|2002|p=6}} His advocacy, leadership, and particularly his personal charisma, were important factors in the advancement of the movement.{{sfn|Hill, Hood and Williamson|2005|p=118}}

==Prevalence==
Most religious snake handlers are still found in the [[Appalachian Mountains]] and other parts of the [[southeastern United States]], especially in [[Alabama]], [[Mississippi]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Kentucky]], [[North Carolina]], [[Tennessee]], [[West Virginia]], and [[South Carolina]]. In 2001, about 40 small churches practiced snake handling, most of them considered to be either [[Holiness movement|Holiness]], [[Pentecostal]]s, or [[Charismatic Movement|Charismatic]]s. In 2004, there were four snake-handling congregations in the provinces of [[Alberta]] and [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s4AP30k4IFwC|title=Fabulous Creatures, Mythical Monsters, and Animal Power Symbols: A Handbook|first=Cassandra|last=Eason|date=1 January 2008|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ralph Hood]], professor of social psychology and the psychology of religion at the [[University of Tennessee]], who has studied the snake handling movement, indicated in 2003 that the practice is "currently at a fairly low ebb of popularity".&lt;ref name="ng"&gt;{{cite news | last=Handwerk | first=Brian | title=Snake Handlers Hang On in Appalachian Churches |date=7 April 2003 | publisher=National Geographic News | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/04/0407_030407_snakehandlers.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 article by [[National Public Radio]] gave a figure of "about 125" churches where snakes are handled, but also indicated that "snake handlers are notoriously private".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/10/04/226838383/snake-handling-preachers-open-up-about-takin-up-serpents|title=Snake-Handling Preachers Open Up About 'Takin' Up Serpents'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs and practices==
Practitioners believe serpent handling dates to antiquity and quote the [[Gospel of Mark]] and the [[Gospel of Luke]] to support the practice:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
And these signs shall follow them that believe: In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues. They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.({{bibleref|Mark|16:17-18|KJV}})
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you. ({{bibleref|Luke|10:19|KJV}})
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Another passage from the New Testament used to support snake handlers' beliefs is {{bibleref|Acts|28:1-6|KJV}}, which relates that Paul was bitten by a venomous viper and suffered no harm:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita. And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold. And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand. And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live. And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm. Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
As in the early days, worshipers are still encouraged to [[Laying on of hands|lay hands on the sick]], [[Glossolalia|speak in tongues]], provide [[Testimony#Religion|testimony]] of [[miracle]]s, and occasionally consume poisons such as [[strychnine]].&lt;ref name="salvation"&gt;[[Dennis Covington]], ''Salvation on Sand Mountain: Snake Handling and Redemption in Southern Appalachia'' (Reading, MA.: Addison-Wesley, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Snake handlers do not worship snakes, instead using the snakes to show non-Christians that God protects them from harm.{{fact|date=September 2018}} In church services, when they feel the anointing of the Holy Spirit come upon them, these Christians reach into boxes, pick up venomous snakes and hold them up as they pray, sing, and dance.{{fact|date=September 2018}} Gathering mainly in homes and converted buildings, snake handlers generally adhere to strict [[dress code]]s such as uncut hair, ankle-length dresses, and no cosmetics for women; and short hair and long-sleeved shirts for men.{{fact|date=September 2018}} Most preach against any use of tobacco or alcohol.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

Like their predecessors, today's snake handlers believe in a strict and literal interpretation of the Bible, and most [[Church of God with Signs Following]] churches are [[non-denominational]], believing that denominations are human-made and carry the [[Mark of the Beast]].{{fact|date=September 2018}} Worshipers attend services several nights a week, where if the [[Holy Spirit]] "intervenes", services can last up to five hours; the minimum is usually 90 minutes.{{fact|date=September 2018}} Those who die from snakebites are never criticized for lack of adequate faith; it is believed that it was simply the deceased’s time to die.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Duin|first1=Julia|title=In WVA, Snake Handling is still considered a sign of faith|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/in-wva-snake-handling-is-still-considered-a-sign-of-faith/2011/10/18/gIQAmiqL9M_story.html|website=Washington Post|accessdate=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final 12 verses of [[Mark 16]] are a point of controversy. Most scholars, following the approach of the textual critic [[Bruce M. Metzger|Bruce Metzger]], believe that verses 9-20 were not part of the original text.&lt;ref name="ActJTomb"&gt;[[Robert W. Funk|Funk, Robert W.]] and the [[Jesus Seminar]]. ''The acts of Jesus: the search for the authentic deeds of Jesus.'' HarperSanFrancisco. 1998. "Empty Tomb, Appearances &amp; Ascension" p. 449-495.&lt;/ref&gt; Chronologically, the Gospel of Mark was the first of the four gospels, and the last 12 verses of Mark are absent from the two earliest manuscripts.{{fact|date=September 2018}} Early third-century theologians like [[Origen]] and [[Clement of Alexandria]] also make no mention of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dias|first1=Elizabeth|title=Snake Salvation: One Way to Pray in Appalachia|url=http://swampland.time.com/2013/09/09/snake-salvation-one-way-to-pray-in-appalachia/|accessdate=30 July 2014|agency=Time Magazine|date=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of [[patristic]] evidence from the late 2nd century for the existence of copies of Mark with the longer ending, it is contended by a majority of scholars that the longer ending must have been written and attached no later than the early 2nd century.&lt;ref name="May Metzger"&gt;May, Herbert G. and Bruce M. Metzger. The New Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocrypha. 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==
All Appalachian states except West Virginia outlawed the snake-handling ritual when it first emerged. The states of Alabama, Kentucky, and Tennessee have passed laws against the use of venomous snakes and/or other reptiles that endangers the lives of others, or without a permit. The Kentucky law specifically mentions religious services; in Kentucky snake handling is a misdemeanor and punishable by a $50 to $100 fine.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lrc.ky.gov/Statutes/statute.aspx?id=19053&lt;/ref&gt;

Snake handling is legal in the state of West Virginia, as the current state constitution does not allow any law to impede upon nor promote a religious practice.&lt;ref name="Bastress"&gt;{{cite book |title= The West Virginia Constitution: A Reference Guide|last= Bastress |first= Robert |authorlink= |year= 1995|publisher= Greenwood Press |location= Westport, CT |pages= 102–103 |isbn=0313274096}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snake handling was made a felony punishable by death under Georgia law in 1941, following the death of a seven-year-old from a rattlesnake bite. However, the punishment was so severe that juries would refuse to convict, and the law was repealed in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 1992, Glen Summerford, a serpent-handling preacher, was convicted of attempted murder of his wife with a rattlesnake.&lt;ref name="hm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hiddenmysteries.org/religion/pentecostal/snakeskill-fool.shtml|title=Snake Kills Evangelist - HiddenMysteries Spiritual Studies|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=history of snake handling|url=http://archive.tennessean.com/interactive/article/99999999/PROMO/120601019/History-snake-handling|website=Tennesseean.com|accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, ''[[Salvation on Sand Mountain]]'', [[Dennis Covington]], a journalist covering the Summerford trial, discusses his first-hand, investigative experiences at a snake-handling church in Appalachia. Because of their snake-handling beliefs, the congregation does not feel that Glen Summerford should be convicted.{{page needed|date=September 2018}} They fully believe that adherents need to handle the snakes as a demonstration of their having the Holy Spirit within.{{page needed|date=September 2018}} And, if they get bit by the snake, then they lack the true Spirit.{{page needed|date=September 2018}} Moreover, if they are bitten, then the congregation prays over them.{{page needed|date=September 2018}} If they die, then God intended for that to happen.{{page needed|date=September 2018}} This congregation did not care to put themselves in harm's way.

In July 2008, ten people were arrested and 125 venomous snakes were confiscated as part of an undercover [[sting operation]] titled "Twice Shy." Pastor Gregory James Coots of the Full Gospel Tabernacle in Jesus' Name (FGTJN) in [[Middlesboro, Kentucky]], was arrested and 74 snakes seized from his home as part of the sting.&lt;ref name="alford"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2008/07/11/national/a183128D08.DTL|title=Pastor among suspects in illegal snake bust|last=Alford|first=Roger|date=12 July 2008|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=12 July 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803025928/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fn%2Fa%2F2008%2F07%2F11%2Fnational%2Fa183128D08.DTL|archivedate=3 August 2008|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risks==
The handling of venomous snakes has significant risks. [[Ralph Hood]] observes, "If you go to any serpent-handling church, you'll see people with atrophied hands, and missing fingers. All the serpent-handling families have suffered such things".&lt;ref name="ng"/&gt; [[Jamie Coots]], a pastor who subsequently died from a snakebite, said, "Handlers get bitten all the time, and every few years someone dies".&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/10/18/236997513/serpent-experts-try-to-demystify-pentecostal-snake-handling|title=Serpent Experts Try To Demystify Pentecostal Snake Handling|date=18 October 2013|agency=National Public Radio|author=John Burnett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various figures for the total number of deaths from [[snakebite]] during religious services have been proposed:
* "over 100 documented deaths" (2003) by [[Ralph Hood]]&lt;ref name="ng"/&gt;
* "around 120" (2005) by [[Robert Winston]].&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;
* "about 100 deaths" (2013) by [[Julia Duin]], a journalist who has covered snake handling churches and is writing a book on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Hood also notes that the practice does not present a danger to observers. There is no documented case of a non-handling member being bitten by a serpent handled by another believer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hood|first1=Ralph W.|title=Them that Believe: The Power and Meaning of the Serpent-Handling Tradition|url=http://www.religiousstudiesproject.com/2013/06/05/stereotypes-and-dangerous-rituals-a-reflection-on-the-academic-study-of-serpent-handling-by-travis-warren-cooper/|website=religiousstudiesproject.com|accessdate=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who handle are consenting adults and as few as ten to fifteen percent of congregants handle the snakes in services.{{fact|date=September 2018}} Children do not participate,{{fact|date=September 2018}} and those not handling the serpents sit apart from the ritual as it proceeds.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

==Media coverage==
A number of films and television programs have been made about religious snake handling.

* ''[[Holy Ghost People (1967 film)|Holy Ghost People]]'' is a 1967 documentary by [[Peter Adair]]. It is about the service of a snake handling [[Pentecostal]] community in [[Scrabble Creek]], [[West Virginia]], United States. This documentary has entered the [[public domain]] and is available at the [[Internet Archive]].
* ''[[Heaven Come Down]]'' is a 2006 television [[documentary film]] about some unusual worship practices of some [[Pentecostal]] Christians in [[Appalachia]], including snake handling.
* ''Snake Salvation'' is a 2013 series produced by the [[National Geographic Channel]], comprising 16 episodes in a [[reality television]] format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/snake-salvation/|title=Snake Salvation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show featured two modern snake-handling pastors and their congregations. The show's focus was on [[Jamie Coots]], who subsequently died of a snakebite. The other featured pastor was Andrew Hamblin, pastor of the Tabernacle Church of God in LaFollette, Tennessee. Hamblin, a protégé of Coots, was worshiping at his mentor's church alongside Coots when the fatal snake bite occurred in February 2014.&lt;ref name="kentucky.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kentucky.com/living/religion/article44471886.html|title=Snakebite death of Middlesboro pastor was quick, son says; medical treatment refused|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pushkaram]] is the Hindu festival about the 12 auspicious rivers in India. One of the 12 rivers is the river Tapti. Usually, one river is worshipped every year, but sometimes that changes, one of these rivers have a celebration and thousands of people dive in to take a bath as worship.

[[Lake Taupo]], in the centre of [[New Zealand]]’s North Island, is the [[caldera]] of a large [[rhyolitic]] [[supervolcano]] called the '''Taupo Volcano'''.  This huge [[volcano]] has produced two of the world’s most violent eruptions in geologically recent times.

The Taupo Volcano forms part of the [[Taupo Volcanic Zone]], a region of volcanic activity that extends from [[Mount Ruapehu|Ruapehu]] in the South, through the [[Taupo District|Taupo]] and [[Rotorua District|Rotorua]] regions, to [[Whakaari/White Island|White Island]], in the [[Bay of Plenty]].

Taupo began erupting about 300,000 years ago, but the main eruptions that still affect the surrounding landscape are the [[Oruanui eruption]], about 26,500 years ago, which is responsible for the shape of the modern caldera, and the [[Hatepe eruption]], about 1,800 years ago.  However, there have been many more eruptions, with major ones every thousand years or so (see timeline of last 10,000 years of eruptions).&lt;ref&gt;A continent on the move: New Zealand geoscience into the 21st century.

Considering recent history alone, the volcano has been inactive for an unusually long period of time, but considering its long-term activity, it was inactive for much longer between 8100 and 5100 BC (3,000 year inactivity, compared to the current 1,800 years)

The Taupo Volcano erupts [[rhyolite]], a viscous magma, with a high silica content.

If the magma does not contain much gas, rhyolite tends to just form a lava dome.  However, when mixed with gas or steam, rhyolitic eruptions can be extremely violent.  The magma froths to form pumice and ash, which is thrown out with great force.

If the volcano creates a stable plume, high in the atmosphere, the pumice and ash is blown sideways, and eventually falls to the ground, draping the landscape like snow.

If the material thrown out cools too rapidly, and becomes denser than the air, it cannot rise as high, and suddenly collapses back to the ground, forming a [[pyroclastic flow]], hitting the surface like water from a waterfall, and spreading sideways across the land at enormous speed.  When the pumice and ash settles, it is sufficiently hot to stick together as a rock called [[Ignimbrite]].  Pyroclastic flows can travel hundreds of kilometres an hour.

==Earlier eruptions==
Earlier ignimbrite eruptions occurred further north than Taupo.  Some of these were enormous, and two eruptions around 1.25 and 1.0 million years ago were big enough to generate an ignimbrite sheet that covered the North Island from Auckland to Napier.

While Taupo has been active for 300,000 years, explosive eruptions became more common 65,000 years ago.

==The Oruanui eruption==
{{Main|Oruanui eruption}}
[[Image:Taupo 2.png|thumb|300 px|A large eruption column during the Oruanui eruption as it may have appeared from space]]
The Oruanui eruption of the Taupo Volcano was the world's largest known eruption in the past 70,000 years, with a [[Volcanic Explosivity Index]] of 8. It occurred around 26,500 years ago and generated approximately 430&amp;nbsp;km³ of [[pyroclastic fall]] deposits, 320&amp;nbsp;km³ of [[pyroclastic density current]] (PDC) deposits (mostly [[ignimbrite]]) and 420&amp;nbsp;km³ of primary intracaldera material, equivalent to 530&amp;nbsp;km³ of [[magma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Wilson, Colin J.

Modern [[Lake Taupo]] partly fills the [[caldera]] generated during this eruption.

[[Tephra]] from the eruption covered much of the central [[North Island]] with ignimbrite up to 200 metres deep. Most of New Zealand was affected by ash fall, with even an 18&amp;nbsp;cm ash layer left on the [[Chatham Islands]], 1,000&amp;nbsp;km away. Later erosion and sedimentation had long-lasting effects on the landscape, and caused the [[Waikato River]] to shift from the [[Hauraki Plains]] to its current course through the Waikato to the [[Tasman Sea]].

==The Taupo eruption==
{{Main|Hatepe eruption}}
[[Image:Lake taupo landsat.jpg|thumb|right|The Taupo eruption's three main vents ran parallel to Lake Taupo's current southeastern shore.]]
The Taupo eruption (also known as the Hatepe eruption) represents the most recent major eruption of the Taupo Volcano, and occurred about 1,800 years ago.  It represents the most violent eruption in the world in the last 5,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;"Taupo the eruption" (a single sheet pamphlet), C.J.N. Wilson and B.F. Houghton, Institute of Geological &amp; Nuclear Sciences, c2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, C.J.N. and Walker, G.P.L., 1985. The Taupo eruption, New Zealand I. General aspects. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, A314: 199-228.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stages of eruption===
The eruption went through several stages.
*A minor eruption occurred beneath the ancestral Lake Taupo.
*A dramatic increase in activity produced a high eruption column from a second vent, and pumice was deposited over a wide area.
*Water entered the first vent, and mixed with the magma, producing a white ash-rich pumice fall.
*A new vent formed, and produced a dark ash- and obsidian-rich fall deposit.
*A larger eruption ensued, producing pumice over a huge area, and a small [[ignimbrite]] deposit.
*The most destructive part of the eruption then occurred.  Part of the vent area collapsed, unleashing about 30&amp;nbsp;km³ of material, that formed a fast moving (600–900&amp;nbsp;km/h) pyroclastic flow.
* [[Rhyolitic]] [[lava dome]]s were extruded some years later, forming the [[Horomatangi]] [[reef]]s and [[Waitahanui]] bank.&lt;ref&gt;Houghton, B.F. (2007). ''[http://www2.hawaii.edu/~bhoughto/NZ_Field_Guide_Spring07.pdf Field Guide - Taupo Volcanic Zone]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main pyroclastic flow devastated the surrounding area, climbing over 1500 metres (5000&amp;nbsp;ft) to overtop the nearby [[Kaimanawa Ranges]] and [[Mount Tongariro]], and covering the land within {{convert|80|km|mi}} with [[ignimbrite]] from [[Rotorua]] to [[Waiouru]].  Only [[Mount Ruapehu|Ruapehu]] was high enough to divert the flow.

The power of the pyroclastic flow was so strong that in some places it [[Erosion|eroded]] more material off the ground surface than it replaced with ignimbrite.  Valleys were filled with ignimbrite, evening out the shape of the land.

All vegetation within the area was flattened.  Loose pumice and ash deposits formed [[lahar]]s down all the main rivers.

The eruption further expanded the [[lake]], which had formed after the much larger Oruanui eruption. The previous outlet was blocked, raising the lake 35 metres above its present level until it broke out in a huge flood, flowing for more than a week at roughly 200 times the [[Waikato River]]'s current rate.

===Dating the Taupo eruption===
Many dates have been given for the Taupo eruption. One estimated date is 181 CE from [[ice core]]s in [[Greenland]] and [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laketauponz.com/aboutlaketaupo.cfm?method=displaysubsection&amp;sectionid=73dea3d0-efad-ba3f-9d50-1c4db6b33ec3 Lake Taupo Official Site] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312071957/https://www.laketauponz.com/aboutlaketaupo.cfm?method=displaysubsection&amp;sectionid=73dea3d0-efad-ba3f-9d50-1c4db6b33ec3 |date=2007-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that the [[meteorological]] phenomena described by [[Fan Ye (historian)|Fan Ye]] in China and by [[Herodian]] in Rome&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of the Roman Empire |last=Herodian of Antioch | volume=Book 1 | chapter=Chapter 14 | quote=Stars remained visible during the day; other stars, extending to an enormous length, seemed to be hanging in the middle of the sky. | url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/herodian_01_book1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; were due to this eruption, which would give a date of exactly 186&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The First New Zealand Book? — an Eyewitness account of the Taupo eruption of AD 186 |last=Barton |first=John |authorlink= |year=2001 |publisher=Trustees of the Dalberton Library |location=New Plymouth |isbn=0-473-08268-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however ash from volcanic activity does not normally cross hemispheres,&lt;ref&gt;Iridium: tracking down the extraterrestrial element in sedimentary clays {{Cite journal|title=New Scientist |year = 1989 |page = 58 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G9URSQkDMYgC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;dq=volcanic+ash+crossing+hemisphere&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ivQUAtdKwQ&amp;sig=odPTx4XdLXZQUp9HHUlkRHWAROc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=SYivTb3YEYfliALY3I2wBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=volcanic%20ash%20crossing%20hemisphere&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recent radiocarbon dating by R. Sparks has put the date at 233 CE +/- 13 (95% confidence).&lt;ref&gt;Sparks, R.J., Melhuish, W.H., McKee, J.W.A., Ogden, J., Palmer, J.G., 1995. 14C calibration in the Southern Hemisphere and the date of the last Taupo eruption: evidence from tree-ring sequences. Radiocarbon 37, 155–163.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was no local population [[History of New Zealand|at this time]], so the nearest humans would have been those in Australia, more than 2000&amp;nbsp;km to the west.

'''Violet Lake''' ({{lang-haw|Kiʻowaiokihawahine}}), is a small high-elevation lake located at {{convert|5,020|ft|m|abbr=on}} above sea level on Mauna Kahalawai (the [[West Maui Mountains]]), situated in the western part of the island of [[Maui]]. It is located in the boggy slopes near the ʻEke Crater and [[Puʻu Kukui]], the highest peak of the West Maui Mountains. It is approximately {{convert|10x20|ft|m|abbr=on}} in size.&lt;ref name="Maui2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WestMaui" /&gt;

The lake's English name derive from the reflected color of the lake's surface and also the Maui [[Viola (plant)|violet]] (''[[Viola mauiensis]]'') which grows on its banks.&lt;ref name="Wianecki"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Wianecki|first=Shannon|title=Rooted in Mystery: A Glimpse into Puʻu Kukui, Maui’s Protected Native Plant Heaven|url=http://mauimagazine.net/rooted-in-mystery/|magazine=Maui Nō Ka ʻOi Magazine|volume=|issue=|date=|publisher=|location=Wailuku|ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pukui|first1=Mary Kawena|authorlink1=Mary Kawena Pukui|last2=Elbert|first2=Samuel H.|authorlink2=Samuel Hoyt Elbert|last3=Mookini|first3=Esther T.|title=Place Names of Hawaii|url=http://ulukau.org/elib/cgi-bin/library?c=pepn&amp;l=en |year=1974|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|location=Honolulu|isbn=978-0-8248-0524-1|oclc=1042464|ref=|page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Howe1918"&gt;{{cite book|last=MacCaughey|first=Vaughan|editor-last=Taylor|editor-first=Norman|title=The Hawaiian Violaceae|journal=Torreya: A Monthly Journal of Botanical Notes and News|url=https://archive.org/details/jstor-40595842|volume=XVIII|date=January 1918|publisher=Torrey Botanical Society|location=New York|jstor=40595842|oclc=5550601940|ref=|pages=1–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hawaiian language]] name Kiʻowaiokihawahine means the "pond of Kihawahine".&lt;ref name="Maui2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WestMaui" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guide"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hawaii Natural Area Reserves System|year=2003|url=http://www.conservehi.org/documents/CCH_PosterGuide03.pdf|accessdate=May 27, 2017|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Young|first=Peter T.|title=Kiowaiokihawahine (Violet Lake)|work=Image of Old Hawaiʻi|publisher=Hoʻokuleana LLC|date=February 18, 2015|url=http://imagesofoldhawaii.com/eke-crater/kiowaiokihawahine-violet-lake/|accessdate=May 27, 2017|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lake was important to the traditional [[Hawaiian religion]]. During ancient times, the lake and surrounding summit area was protected by ''[[kapu]]'' and regarded as the meeting place of heaven and earth.&lt;ref name="Maui2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WestMaui" /&gt; The lake was believed to be the home of the Hawaiian ''moʻo'' (lizard) goddess [[Kihawahine]], who was associated with the [[Alii nui of Maui|''aliʻi nui'']] (high chiefs or kings) of Maui and an ''[[aumakua|ʻaumakua]]'' (family deity) of Queen [[Keōpūolani]], a descendant of the Maui royal line and the highest-ranking wife of King [[Kamehameha I]], who established the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]], and their son [[Kamehameha III]].&lt;ref name="Wianecki" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Klieger1998" /&gt; Kihawahine was also associated with the wetland and former royal complex at [[Mokuʻula]] located in the watersheds below the lake in [[Lahaina]].&lt;ref name="Klieger1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Klieger|first=P.

The surrounding [[Hawaiian tropical rainforests|montane rainforest]] ecosystem on the slopes of Puʻu Kukui Watershed Management Area (the second wettest spot in the [[Hawaiian Islands]]) is extremely diverse and home to many endemic species. The lake's own unique ecosystem have not been well studied.&lt;ref name="Wianecki" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Percyetal2008"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.biology.duke.edu/cunningham/pdfs/PercyMetrosideros2008.pdf |first=Diana M. |last=Percy |author2=Adam M.

Species include the dwarfed ʻōhiʻa lehua tree (''[[Metrosideros polymorpha]]''), the Maui violet (''Viola mauiensis''), a variety of [[Hawaiian lobelioids]]  (''[[Lobelia gloriamontis]]''), the Hawaiian damsel flies (''[[Megalagrion|Megalagrion spp.]]''), and others.&lt;ref name="Maui2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wianecki" /&gt;  It has been described as an "extremely rare gem" which have "residents and visiting scientists alike".&lt;ref name="Maui2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WestMaui" /&gt;
