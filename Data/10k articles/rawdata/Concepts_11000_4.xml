'''Amy Barbour-James''' (25 January 1906 – 4 May 1988) was a London-born Guyanese Black [[civil rights activist]] and civil servant.

== Early life and family ==
Caroline Amy Aileen Barbour-James was born in [[Acton, London]],&lt;ref name=postcard&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jeffreygreen.co.uk/amy-barbour-james-and-the-league-of-coloured-peoples-1942 |title=005: Amy Barbour-James &amp; the League of Coloured Peoples 1942 « Jeffrey Green.

Her father, John Barbour-James worked as administrator in West Africa&lt;ref name=postcard /&gt; and had access to a large network of contacts throughout the continent. In 1918, he founded the [[African Patriotic Intelligence Bureau]].

== Activism ==
Inspired by her father, Barbour-James became active in the civil rights movements and was involved in the [[African Progress Union]] and the [[League of Coloured Peoples]], becoming secretary of later organisation in 1942.

In 2011, a short drama based on Barbour-James's life was broadcast by [[BBC Radio 4]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00fssr3 |title=Writing the Century 11: 1963–1966 - All My Trials, Episode 1, Excerpt from: All My Trials |publisher=BBC Radio 4|work=15 Minute Drama|date= |accessdate=2016-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4262">In [[physics]] and [[mathematics]], an '''ansatz''' ({{IPAc-en|'|ae|n|s|ae|t|s}}; {{IPA-de|ˈʔanzats|lang}}, meaning: "initial placement of a tool at a work piece", plural '''ansätze''' {{IPAc-en|'|ae|n|s|ɛ|t|s|ə}}; {{IPA-de|ˈʔanzɛtsə|lang}} or '''ansatzes''') is an educated guess&lt;ref name="Gershenfeld 1999"&gt;In his book on "The Nature of Mathematical Modelling", Neil Gershenfeld introduces ''ansatz'', with interpretation "a trial answer", to be an important technique for solving differential equations. Gershenfeld 1999, p.10.&lt;/ref&gt; that is verified later by its results.

==Use==
An ansatz is the establishment of the starting equation(s), the theorem(s), or the value(s) describing a mathematical or physical problem or solution. It can take into consideration [[Boundary value problem|boundary conditions]].  After an ansatz has been established (constituting nothing more than an assumption), the equations are solved for the general function of interest (constituting a confirmation of the assumption).

==Examples==
Given a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of experimental data that looks to be [[Cluster analysis|clustered]] about a line, a linear ansatz could be made to find the [[parameter]]s of the line by a [[least squares]] curve fit. [[Calculus of variations|Variational]] [[approximation]] methods use ansätze and then fit the parameters.

Another example could be the mass, energy, and entropy balance equations that, considered simultaneous for purposes of the elementary operations of [[linear algebra]], are the ''ansatz'' to most basic problems of [[thermodynamics]].

Another example of an ansatz is to suppose the solutions of a homogeneous linear [[differential equation]] and [[difference equation]] to have, respectively, exponential and power form. More generally, one can guess a particular solution of a system of equations and test such an ansatz by direct substitution of the solution in the system of equations.

[[Information]] is that which reduces uncertainty, wholly or in part.
Similarly, anti-information is that which increases uncertainty.
It is negative information.

[[Noise_(signal_processing)|Noise]] on a [[Noisy-channel coding theorem|noisy communication channel]] is an example of anti-information.
According to [[Shannon–Hartley theorem|Shannon's Channel Coding Theorem]]
the [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]] of the noise must be subtracted to obtain the [[channel capacity]]
that remains available for reliable communication.

The [[gambling]] industry has made a business out of selling anti-information.
People are willing to pay for anti-information.
The increase in uncertainty enables them to savor the information that they subsequently receive
when the uncertainty is finally resolved.

The term anti-information was introduced by [[Jacobus Verhoeff|Koos Verhoeff]] in the 1970s
while teaching [[informatics]] at the [[Erasmus University Rotterdam]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13970">'''Attractiveness Principle''' is one of [[System Dynamics]] archetypes. [[System archetype]]s describe common patterns of behavior in dynamic [[complex systems]]. Attractiveness principle is a variation of [[Limits to Growth]] archetype, with restrictions caused by multiple limits. The limiting factors here are each of different character and usually cannot be dealt with the same way and/or (and very likely) they cannot be all addressed.

== Introduction to the problem ==
Attractiveness principle is a concept that incorporates the fact that any product or kind of business cannot ever be ''“all things to all people”'' &lt;ref name="systemsthinking"&gt;Attractiveness Principle at Systems-thinking.org. http://www.systems-thinking.org/theWay/sap/ap.htm&lt;/ref&gt; though companies very often strive to follow this way.&lt;ref name="Powell"&gt;Powell, Bob (2001). The Attractiveness Principle. Continuous Improvement Associates. 1–2. http://www.exponentialimprovement.com/cms/uploads/flyer_attractiveness_principle2p.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; One needs to make necessary decisions on the characteristics of the product as it cannot be perfect in all dimensions. If she doesn’t, the product is not going to be successful as of the natural constraints (limited resources) it will have to face – sooner or later. It is a fact of life that (assuming we know the relationships among the system’s elements) we can influence, inhibit or remove some of these limits through making expert changes in the system. The archetype can help us to get the insight into the system behavior so we could identify and decide which limiting factors to inhibit before they inhibit the results we want to achieve. But there will always be some limits we are not able to reduce and simply “we have to learn to live with them” and make compromises between our goals.

=== Application field ===
Knowledge of the attractiveness principle system archetype is essential in management of various projects and businesses. Managers decide which problem is more attractive in terms of possible future improvement of the company &lt;ref name="Braun"/&gt; – the origin of the archetype’s name actually came from this point. Manager as a decision-maker needs efficient support in solving such complex problems, and system dynamics can play this role. Its main advantage is the ability to reach higher complexity and to provide simultaneous calculations. These can be used to determine the future possible behavior of the [[system]].&lt;ref&gt;Mildeová, Stanislava and Vojtko, Viktor (2006). Selected Chapters of System Dynamics. KARTPRINT. 86–87. {{ISBN|80-88870-60-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If managers are able to recognize the archetype in a problem it often helps them to solve it with less cost and they are also often able to change its [[structure]].&lt;ref&gt;Mildeová, Stanislava and Vojtko, Viktor (2003). Systémová dynamika. Oeconomica. 39. {{ISBN|80-245-0626-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History ===
The term attractiveness principle was first used by inventor of system dynamics [[Jay W. Forrester]].&lt;ref name="forrester"&gt;Forrester, J. W. (1975). Collected Papers of Jay W. Forrester. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Wright-Allen Press. http://dieoff.org/page23.htm&lt;/ref&gt; According to Forrester, the only way to control growth is to control attractiveness.&lt;ref name="forrester" /&gt; Other references on this topic can be found in The Systems Thinker &lt;ref&gt;The Systems Thinker. Pegasus Communications, Inc. Waltham, MA.&lt;/ref&gt; and in The Fifth Discipline Fieldbook &lt;ref&gt;Senge, P. et al. (1994). The Fifth Discipline Fieldbook. New York: Doubleday Currency.&lt;/ref&gt; in articles and parts by Michael Goodman and Art Kleiner.

== Model ==

=== Structure ===
The system is made up of a [[reinforcing loop]] and at least two [[balancing loop]]s. See [[causal loop diagram]] and [[stock and flow diagram]] for the insight into model fundamentals.&lt;br /&gt;
 [[File:Attractiveness Principle-Causal Loop.svg|thumb|400px|left|Figure 1. Causal loop diagram]] &lt;br /&gt; [[File:Attractiveness principle-stock and flow.svg|thumb|400px|left|Figure 2. Stock and flow diagram]]

The Reinforcing Loop (R1 in Figure 1 and 2) represents accelerating growth – a growing action is producing results. This is a positive feedback loop – the more the growing action taken, the higher the results level, and yet the result itself produces even more of growing action.
Balancing loops (B2 and B3 in Figure 1 and 2) represent the way the system turns back to its original state. Result produced in the reinforcing loop is influenced within the balancing loop. There are (at least) two limits causing the slowing actions in the system and adding to them. Limiting actions start to influence the system at various levels of results, generally. Since that moment slowing actions act in the system simultaneously. Both the slowing actions contribute to the total slowing action. Total slowing action then inhibits the results (this process is delayed in time).
If we get back to the reinforcing loop then we can see the inhibited results are reducing growing action which is leading to the reduced results again.

=== Trade-offs ===
[[Trade-off]]s must be calculated to decide which ones of limits to focus on and address first.&lt;ref name="sherrer"&gt;Sherrer, J. Alex (2010). Fix It With Systems Thinking: Part 4. Project Management Road Trip. http://www.pmroadtrip.com/art09004c.html#ATTRACTIVENESS&lt;/ref&gt; The one that is more attractive in terms of future benefit to the results should be chosen to be dealt with. It is necessary to compare the future situations after removing each of the slowing actions and their values in terms of reaching the desired result. But not only the one that will have a greater impact should be chosen but a possible [[Synergy|synergetic effect]] when removing interdependent limits should be considered when making a decision.&lt;ref name="Braun"/&gt;

== System behavior ==
Graphs in Figure 3 and 4 show the results of simulation in [http://simgua.com/ Simgua] simulation tool.
 [[File:Atractiveness Principle-graph no limits.png|thumb|400px|left|Figure 3. Situation with no limiting factor.]] &lt;br /&gt; [[File:Atractiveness Principle-graph limits.png|thumb|400px|left|Figure 4. Situation with one limiting factor set at 3 and another one set at 5.]]

==Examples==

=== Project management example &lt;ref name="sherrer"/&gt; ===

There is a project with a negative impact of a risk. Some people were taken off the team, there are unexpected changes in the project content and the economic circumstances have changed, too. The indicators of its quality, schedule and costs need to be kept up. Management’s task is to allocate the resources as well as possible in terms of the project’s indicators. Due to the fact the resources are limited it is necessary to make tradeoffs among opportunities.

=== Attractiveness of geographical areas ===
[[Jay W. Forrester]] studied the attractiveness principle of geographical areas.&lt;ref name="forrester"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Forrester, Jay (1971). Counterintuitive behavior of social systems. Technology Review. {{cite web|url=http://sysdyn.clexchange.org/sdep/Roadmaps/RM1/D-4468-2.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090823210010/http://sysdyn.clexchange.org/sdep/Roadmaps/RM1/D-4468-2.pdf |archivedate=2009-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He states that all the places in the world tend to the equilibrium where they are all equally attractive, no matter the population class. Let attractivity be the overall rating of a city in terms of its desirability for potential inhabitants. If a city has high attractivity people move to this city, which increases the prices of housing which is getting scarce, cause overloading of job opportunities (leading to unemployment), the environmental stress is rising, city getting overcrowded etc. These changes demonstrate the impact of the movement as of an equalizing process which makes the mentioned city less and less attractive – to the (idealized) point when no one wants to move to it anymore.
We can illustrate this situation by Forester’s words:
:''To illustrate the attractiveness principle, imagine for a moment the ideal city. Perhaps the ideal city would be one with readily available housing at low cost, a surplus of jobs at high wages, excellent schools, no smoke or pollution, housing located near one's place of work, no crime, beautiful parks, cultural opportunities, and to this list the reader can add his own preferences. Suppose such a city existed. What would happen? It would be perceived as the ideal place to live. People from everywhere would move into the ideal city until the advantages had been so swamped by rising population that the city would offer no net attractiveness compared with other locations.'' (,&lt;ref name="forrester"/&gt; pg. 275-276)
As stated by [[Richard C. Duncan]], using Forrester’s Word dynamics model to predict the behavior of [[Third World]] countries shows that it is not possible to stop the immigration from these countries to USA as these countries can never reach the USA’s level of geographical attractiveness (and so there always will be a tendency to immigrate).&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, Richard C. (2007). The olduvai theory: terminal decline imminent. http://www.oilcrash.com/articles/olduv_7.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

# Knowing the growth is limited is the first step.
# The insight is complicated by mutual interaction of limits, so analysis of their relation should be a priority. Such an analysis can also reveal possible synergies that can be achieved by allocating resources to carefully chosen limits.
# Consider replacing limited resources by another ones.
# Dominant strategy is to monitor the limits and using tradeoff analysis for deciding which of them it is convenient to reduce or remove to obtain desired results.
# Define the acceptable level of (un)attraction.
# Slowing actions are not usually appearing at the same time so it is important to manage them through the time.
# Try to inhibit the limits before they even start to act like limits.
# As limits start to have impact on various levels of results it is important to keep the right timing – intercept the moment when the limit starts playing its role but not waste the resources to avoid its impact unless it is necessary.

It is important to have in mind that dynamic complexity is very often counterintuitive – cause and effect are distant in time and space, but decision-makers rather tend to look for causes “near” their effects. The solution is not to concentrate on the symptoms of the problem, but on its causes.&lt;ref&gt;Sterman, John D. (2000). Business Dynamics: Systems thinking and modeling for a complex world.

'''Benni Efrat''' (born 1936) is an [[Israel]]i painter, sculptor, printmaker and filmmaker who was born in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]].  
==Biography==
Benni Efrat immigrated to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] in 1947. From 1959 to 1961, he studied at the [[Avni Institute of Art and Design]] in [[Tel Aviv]] under [[Yehezkel Streichman]] (1906–1993). From 1966 to 1976, he lived in [[London]], where he studied at [[Saint Martin's School of Art]] in London. 
==Art career==
Benni Efrat was one of the first of Israeli [[Conceptual Art|Conceptual artists]] and influenced others in this direction (e.g., [[Joshua Neustein]], [[Michael Gitlin]], [[Buky Schwartz]]). His works were systems of components which spoke for themselves and sought to represent no more than the sum of their parts. In the mid-1970s his displays were accompanied by films, on the back of which the artist had painted. After settling in [[New York City]] in 1976, became involved with conceptual art, producing drawings, prints and photographs that explore energy, space and the perception in sculpture.  Efrat currently lives in [[Belgium]].

'''The Bill of Rights''', also known as the '''English Bill of Rights''', is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of England]] that sets out certain basic [[civil rights]] and clarifies who would be next to inherit [[the Crown]]. It received the [[Royal Assent]] on 16 December 1689 and is a restatement in [[Statute|statutory form]] of the [[Declaration of Right, 1689|Declaration of Right]] presented by the [[Convention Parliament (1689)|Convention Parliament]] to [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] in February 1689, inviting them to become joint sovereigns of [[Kingdom of England|England]]. The Bill of Rights lays down limits on the powers of the [[monarch]] and sets out the rights of Parliament, including the requirement for regular parliaments, free elections, and [[freedom of speech]] in Parliament. It sets out certain rights of individuals including the prohibition of [[cruel and unusual punishment]] and reestablished the right of [[Protestantism|Protestants]] to [[right to bear arms|have arms for their defence]] within the [[rule of law]]. Furthermore, the Bill of Rights described and condemned several misdeeds of [[James II]] of England.&lt;ref&gt;The key landmark is the Bill of Rights (1689), which established the supremacy of Parliament over the Crown. ... The Bill of Rights (1689) then settled the primacy of Parliament over the monarch’s prerogatives, providing for the regular meeting of Parliament, free elections to the Commons, free speech in parliamentary debates, and some basic human rights, most famously freedom from ‘cruel or unusual punishment’. {{cite web |title=Britain's unwritten constitution |url=http://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/articles/britains-unwritten-constitution |publisher=British Library |accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These ideas reflected those of the political thinker [[John Locke]] and they quickly became popular in England.{{sfn|Schwoerer|1990|pp=531–548}} It also sets out – or, in the view of its drafters, restates – certain constitutional requirements of [[the Crown]] to seek the consent of the people, as represented in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Maurice Adams |author2=Anne Meuwese |author3=Ernst Hirsch Ballin |title=Constitutionalism and the Rule of Law: Bridging Idealism and Realism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-oY7DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA97 |via=Google Books |year=2017 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], the Bill of Rights is further accompanied by [[Magna Carta]], the [[Petition of Right]], the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1679]] and the [[Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949]] as some of the basic documents of the uncodified [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British constitution]]. A separate but similar document, the [[Claim of Right Act 1689]], applies in [[Scotland]]. The Bill of Rights 1689 was one of the inspirations for the [[United States Bill of Rights]].

Along with the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], the Bill of Rights is still in effect in all [[Commonwealth realm]]s. Following the [[Perth Agreement]] in 2011, legislation amending both of them came into effect across the Commonwealth realms on 26&amp;nbsp;March 2015.

==Background==
During the 17th&amp;nbsp;century, there was [[Magna Carta#17th–18th centuries|renewed interest in Magna Carta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/videos/from-legal-document-to-public-myth-magna-carta-in-the-17th-century |title=From legal document to public myth: Magna Carta in the 17thth&amp;nbsp;century |website=The British Library |access-date=2017-10-16 |postscript=none}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sal.org.uk/events/2015/06/magna-carta-magna-carta-in-the-17th-century/|title=Magna Carta: Magna Carta in the 17th&amp;nbsp;century |website=The Society of Antiquaries of London |access-date=2017-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Parliament of England passed the [[Petition of Right]] in 1628 which established certain liberties for subjects. The [[English Civil War]] (1642–1651) was fought between the King and an oligarchic but elected Parliament,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Origins and growth of Parliament |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/citizen_subject/origins.htm |publisher=The National Archives |accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rise of Parliament |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/rise_parliament/citizenship2.htm |publisher=The National Archives |accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; during which the idea of a political party took form with groups debating rights to political representation during the [[Putney Debates]] of 1647.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Putney debates |url=https://www.bl.uk/taking-liberties/articles/putney-debates |publisher=The British Library |accessdate=22 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, [[the Protectorate]] (1653–1659) and the [[English Restoration]] (1660) restored more autocratic rule although Parliament passed the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1679|Habeas Corpus Act]] in 1679, which strengthened the convention that forbade detention lacking sufficient cause or evidence.

===Glorious Revolution===
{{Main|Glorious Revolution}}
Objecting to the policies of [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|King]] [[James II of England]] (James&amp;nbsp;VII of Scotland and James&amp;nbsp;II of Ireland), a group of English Parliamentarians invited the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] [[stadtholder]] [[William III of England|William&amp;nbsp;III]] of [[House of Orange-Nassau|Orange-Nassau]] (William of Orange) to overthrow the King. William's successful invasion with a Dutch fleet and army led to James fleeing to France. In December&amp;nbsp;1688, William took over the provisional government by appointment of the peers of the realm, as was the legal right of the latter in circumstances when the King was incapacitated, and summoned an assembly of certain members of parliament. This assembly called for an [[Convention Parliament (1689)|English Convention Parliament]] to be elected, which convened on 22&amp;nbsp;January 1689.{{sfn|Anon.|2010|pp=2–4}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill of Rights|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/takingliberties/staritems/510billofrights.html|publisher= British Library|accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Declaration of Right===
{{Main|Declaration of Right, 1689}}
[[File:Samuel Wale, The Bill of Rights Ratified at the Revolution by King William, and Queen Mary, Previous to their Coronation (1783).jpg|thumb|An 18th&amp;nbsp;century engraving, based on a drawing by [[Samuel Wale]], of the Bill of Rights being presented to [[William III of England|William&amp;nbsp;III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary&amp;nbsp;II]]]]
The proposal to draw up a statement of rights and liberties and James's violation of them was first made on 29&amp;nbsp;January 1689 in the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]], with members arguing that the House "cannot answer it to the nation or Prince of Orange till we declare what are the rights invaded" and that William "cannot take it ill if we make conditions to secure ourselves for the future" in order to "do justice to those who sent us hither". On 2&amp;nbsp;February a committee specially convened reported to the Commons 23&amp;nbsp;Heads of Grievances, which the Commons approved and added some of their own. However, on 4&amp;nbsp;February the Commons decided to instruct the committee to differentiate between "such of the general heads, as are introductory of new laws, from those that are declaratory of ancient rights". On 7&amp;nbsp;February the Commons approved this revised Declaration of Right, and on 8&amp;nbsp;February instructed the committee to put into a single text the Declaration (with the heads which were "introductory of new laws" removed), the resolution of 28&amp;nbsp;January and the Lords' proposal for a revised oath of allegiance. It passed the Commons without division.{{sfn|Horwitz|1977|p=12}}

On 13&amp;nbsp;February the clerk of the House of Lords read the Declaration of Right, and the [[George Savile, 1st&amp;nbsp;Marquess of Halifax|Marquess of Halifax]], in the name of all the estates of the realm, asked William and Mary to accept the throne. William replied for his wife and himself: "We thankfully accept what you have offered us". They then went in procession to the great gate at Whitehall. The [[Garter Principal King of Arms|Garter King at Arms]] proclaimed them King and Queen of England, France, and Ireland, whereupon they adjourned to the Chapel Royal, with the [[Henry Compton (bishop)|Bishop of London]] preaching the sermon.{{sfn |Carpenter|1956|pp=145–146}} They were crowned on 11&amp;nbsp;April, swearing an oath to uphold the laws made by Parliament. The [[Coronation Oath Act 1688]]  had provided a new coronation oath, whereby the monarchs were to "solemnly promise and swear to govern the people of this kingdom of England, and the dominions thereunto belonging, according to the statutes in parliament agreed on, and the laws and customs of the same". They were also to maintain the laws of God, the true profession of the Gospel, and the Protestant Reformed faith established by law.{{sfn|Williams|1960|pp=37–39}} This replaced an oath which had deferred more to the monarch. The previous oath required the monarch to rule based on "the laws and customs ... granted by the Kings of England".&lt;ref name=refUKPBoR&gt;{{cite web|title= The Convention and Bill of Rights|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/parliamentaryauthority/revolution/overview/billofrights/|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions of the Act==
The Declaration of Right was enacted in an Act of Parliament, the Bill of Rights 1689, which received the [[Royal Assent]] in December&amp;nbsp;1689.{{sfn|Thatcher|1907|pp=10}} The Act asserted "certain ancient rights and liberties" by declaring that:{{sfn|Williams|1960|pp=28–29}}
* the pretended power of suspending the laws and dispensing with{{refn|group="nb"|i.e. ignoring}} laws by regal authority without consent of Parliament is illegal;
* the [[Ecclesiastical Commission of 1686|commission for ecclesiastical]] causes is illegal;
* levying taxes without grant of Parliament is illegal;
* it is the right of the subjects to [[petition]] the king, and prosecutions for such petitioning are illegal;
* keeping a [[standing army]] in time of peace, unless it be with consent of Parliament, is against law;{{refn|Arguably, this right is subject to continuing [[derogation]] in modern times; see, for example, [[Armed Forces Act]] and discussion of the same in [[Military Covenant]].|group="nb"}}
* Protestants may have [[Right to keep and bear arms|arms for their defence]] suitable to their conditions and as allowed by law;
* election of members of Parliament ought to be free;
* the [[freedom of speech]] and debates or proceedings in Parliament ought not to be [[Parliamentary privilege|impeached or questioned]] in any court or place out of Parliament;
* [[excessive bail]] ought not to be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor [[cruel and unusual punishment]]s inflicted;
* jurors in trials for high treason ought to be freeholders;
* promises of fines and forfeitures before conviction are illegal and void;
* for redress of all grievances, and for the amending, strengthening and preserving of the laws, Parliaments ought to be held frequently.

The Act declared James' flight from England following the [[Glorious Revolution]] to be an [[abdication]] of the throne. It listed twelve of James's policies by which James designed to "endeavour to subvert and extirpate the protestant religion, and the laws and liberties of this kingdom".{{sfn|Williams|1960|p=26}} These were:{{sfn|Williams|1960|p=27}}
* by assuming and exercising a power of dispensing with and suspending of laws and the execution of laws without consent of Parliament;
* by prosecuting the [[Seven Bishops]]; by establishing of the court of commissioners for ecclesiastical causes;
* by levying taxes for the use of the Crown by pretence of prerogative as if the same was granted by Parliament;
* by raising and keeping a standing army within this kingdom in time of peace without consent of Parliament;
* by causing Protestants to be disarmed at the same time when papists were both armed and employed contrary to law;
* by violating the freedom of election of members to serve in Parliament;
* by prosecutions in the Court of King's Bench for matters and causes cognizable only in Parliament, and by divers other arbitrary and illegal courses;
* by employing unqualified persons on juries in trials, and jurors in trials for high treason which were not freeholders;
* by imposing excessive bail on persons committed in criminal cases against the laws made for the liberty of the subjects;
* by imposing excessive fines and illegal and cruel punishments;
* by making several grants and promises made of fines and forfeitures before any conviction or judgment against the persons upon whom the same were to be levied;
* all which are utterly and directly contrary to the known laws and statutes and freedom of this realm.

In a prelude to the Act of Settlement to come twelve years later, the Bill of Rights barred [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] from the throne of England as "it hath been found by experience that it is inconsistent with the safety and welfare of this Protestant kingdom to be governed by a papist prince"; thus [[William III of England|William&amp;nbsp;III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary&amp;nbsp;II]] were named as the successors of James II and that the throne would pass from them first to Mary's heirs, then to her sister, [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Princess Anne of Denmark]] and her heirs (and, thereafter, to any heirs of William by a later marriage).

==Date and title==
The Bill of Rights is commonly dated in legal contexts to 1688. This convention arises from the [[legal fiction]] (prior to the passage of the [[Acts of Parliament (Commencement) Act 1793]]) that an [[Act of Parliament]] came into force on the first day of the session in which it was passed. The Bill was therefore deemed to be effective from 13&amp;nbsp;February 1689 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|New Style]]), or, under the [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style calendar]] in use at the time, 13&amp;nbsp;February 1688. Under the [[Short Titles Act 1896]], the Bill was given the official [[short title]] of "The Bill of Rights", without a calendar year suffix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/WillandMarSess2/1/2#reference-c2144673 |title=Bill of Rights [1688] |publisher=legislation.gov.uk |at=note X1 |accessdate=14 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Augmentation and effect==

The Bill of Rights was later supplemented by the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] (which was agreed to by the [[Parliament of Scotland]] as part of the [[Treaty of Union]]). The Act of Settlement altered the line of succession to the throne laid out in the Bill of Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Act of Settlement|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/parliamentaryauthority/revolution/overview/actofsettlement/|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, both the Bill of Rights and the Claim of Right contributed a great deal to the establishment of the concept of [[parliamentary sovereignty]] and the curtailment of the powers of the monarch.&lt;ref&gt;This vigorous assertion of the rights of the subject meant that the Bill of Rights is often seen as parallel in importance with Magna Carta itself. {{cite web |title=The Bill of Rights |url=http://www.bl.uk/collection-items/the-bill-of-rights |publisher=British Library |accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Although the Bill of Rights attacked the abuse of prerogative power rather than prerogative power itself, it had the virtue of enshrining in statute what many regarded as ancient rights and liberties. However, some historians maintain that a more profound change in the relationship between sovereign and Parliament emerged as a result of the financial settlement that Parliament negotiated with William and Mary. {{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/rise_parliament/making_history_rise.htm |title=Rise of Parliament |publisher=The National Archives |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The earliest, and perhaps greatest, victory for liberalism was achieved in England. The rising commercial class that had supported the Tudor monarchy in the 16th&amp;nbsp;century led the revolutionary battle in the 17th, and succeeded in establishing the supremacy of Parliament and, eventually, of the House of Commons. What emerged as the distinctive feature of modern constitutionalism was not the insistence on the idea that the king is subject to law (although this concept is an essential attribute of all constitutionalism). This notion was already well established in the Middle Ages. What was distinctive was the establishment of effective means of political control whereby the rule of law might be enforced. Modern constitutionalism was born with the political requirement that representative government depended upon the consent of citizen subjects. ... However, as can be seen through provisions in the 1689 Bill of Rights, the English Revolution was fought not just to protect the rights of property (in the narrow sense) but to establish those liberties which liberals believed essential to human dignity and moral worth. The "rights of man" enumerated in the English Bill of Rights gradually were proclaimed beyond the boundaries of England, notably in the American Declaration of Independence of 1776 and in the French Declaration of the Rights of Man in 1789. {{cite web |title=Constitutionalism: America &amp; Beyond |url=http://www.ait.org.tw/infousa/zhtw/DOCS/Demopaper/dmpaper2.html |department=Bureau of International Information Programs |publisher=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=30 October 2014 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024130317/http://www.ait.org.tw/infousa/zhtw/DOCS/Demopaper/dmpaper2.html |archive-date=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading, ultimately, to the establishment of [[constitutional monarchy]],{{sfn|Walker|2009|p=2: "thereby establishing a constitutional monarchy"}} while also (along with the [[Penal law (Britain)|penal laws]]) settling the political and religious turmoil that had convulsed Scotland, England and Ireland in the 17th&amp;nbsp;century.

The Bill of Rights (1689) reinforced the [[Petition of Right]] (1628) and the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1679|Habeas Corpus Act]] (1679) by codifying certain rights and liberties. Described by [[William Blackstone]] as ''[[Fundamental Laws of England]]'', the rights expressed in these Acts became associated with the idea of the [[rights of Englishmen]].{{sfn|Billias|2011|p=54}} The Bill of Rights directly influenced the 1776 [[Virginia Declaration of Rights#Drafting and adoption|Virginia Declaration of Rights]],{{refn|Section Seven of the Virginia Declaration of Rights reads,
:That all power of suspending laws, or the execution of laws, by any authority, without consent of the representatives of the people, is injurious to their rights and ought not to be exercised.
which strongly echoes the first two "ancient rights and liberties" asserted in the Bill of Rights 1689:
:That the pretended power of suspending the laws or the execution of laws by regal authority without consent of Parliament is illegal;
:That the pretended power of dispensing with laws or the execution of laws by regal authority, as it hath been assumed and exercised of late, is illegal;

And the Virginia Declaration's Section Nine, 
:That excessive bail ought not to be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.
is borrowed word for word from the Bill of Rights 1689.|group="nb"}} which in turn influenced the [[United States Declaration of Independence#Influences and legal status|Declaration of Independence]].{{sfn|Maier|1997|pp=126–28}}

Although not a comprehensive statement of civil and political liberties, the Bill of Rights stands as one of the landmark documents in the development of [[civil liberties in the United Kingdom]] and a model for later, more general, statements of rights;&lt;ref name=refUKPBoR /&gt; these include the [[United States Bill of Rights]], the French [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], the [[United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="unesco2011"&gt;All the main principles of the Bill of Rights are still in force today, and the Bill of Rights continues to be cited in legal cases in the UK and in Commonwealth countries. It has a primary place in a wider national historical narrative of documents which established the rights of Parliament and set out universal civil liberties, starting with Magna Carta in 1215. It also has international significance, as it was a model for the US Bill of Rights 1789, and its influence can be seen in other documents which establish rights of human beings, such as the Declaration of the Rights of Man, the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. {{cite web |title=2011 UK Memory of the World Register |url=http://www.unesco.org.uk/2011-uk-memory-of-the-world-register |publisher=United Kingdom National Commission for UNESCO |date=23 May 2011 |accessdate=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/news/facts-about-the-bill-of-rights-on-its-220th-anniversary |title=Facts About the Bill of Rights on Its 220th Anniversary |date=15 December 2011 |publisher=History.com |accessdate=29 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215342/http://www.history.com/news/facts-about-the-bill-of-rights-on-its-220th-anniversary |archivedate=4 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, as with the Bill of Rights 1689, the [[US Constitution#Influences|US Constitution]] prohibits excessive bail and "[[cruel and unusual punishment]]". Similarly, "cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment" is banned under Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article&amp;nbsp;3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

==Legal status==
The Bill of Rights remains in statute and continues to be cited in legal proceedings in the United Kingdom and other [[Commonwealth realm]]s, particularly Article&amp;nbsp;9 on [[Parliamentary privilege|parliamentary freedom of speech]].{{sfn|Lock|1989|pp=540–561}}&lt;ref name=Topo&gt;{{cite web |author=Toporoski, Richard |url=http://www.monarchist.ca/mc/invisibl.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970617074036/http://www.monarchist.ca/mc/invisibl.htm |archivedate=17 June 1997 |title=''Monarchy Canada'': The Invisible Crown |date=Summer 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Perth Agreement]] in 2011, legislation amending the Bill of Rights and the Act of Settlement 1701 came into effect across the Commonwealth realms on 26&amp;nbsp;March 2015 which changed the laws of succession to the British throne.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;In Quebec the validity of the Canadian parliament's [[Succession to the Throne Act, 2013|legislation]] is under [[Judicial review in Canada|judicial review]]. {{cite news |author=Blanchfield, Mike |date=22 July 2013 |title=Quebec government to mount legal challenge to new royal succession law |newspaper=National Post |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/world/quebec-government-to-mount-legal-challenge-to-new-royal-succession-law}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the Bill of Rights remains in statute in the [[Republic of Ireland]].

===United Kingdom===
The Bill of Rights applies in [[England and Wales]]; it was enacted in the [[Kingdom of England]] which at the time included Wales. [[Scotland]] has its own legislation, the [[Claim of Right Act 1689]], passed before the Act of Union between England and Scotland. There are doubts as to whether, or to what extent, the Bill of Rights applies in [[Northern Ireland]].{{sfn|Lock|1989|pp=540–561}}{{refn|group=nb|The United Kingdom consists of four countries and three distinct legal systems: [[England and Wales]], [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Guide to the UK Legal System |url=http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/United_Kingdom.html |department=Hauser Global Law School Program |publisher=New York University School of Law |accessdate=16 March 2016 |date=November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Legal System of the United Kingdom |url=http://www.cilex.org.uk/about_cilex_lawyers/the_uk_legal_system.aspx |publisher=The Chartered Institute of Legal Executives |accessdate=16 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313232551/http://www.cilex.org.uk/about_cilex_lawyers/the_uk_legal_system.aspx |archivedate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These jurisdictions have particular legal considerations of their own, arising from differences in [[English law]], [[Scots law]] and [[Northern Ireland law]].}}

On 21&amp;nbsp;July 1995 a [[libel]] case brought by [[Neil Hamilton (politician)|Neil Hamilton]] (then a member of parliament) against ''[[The Guardian]]'' was stopped after Justice May ruled that the Bill of Rights' prohibition on the courts' ability to question parliamentary proceedings would prevent ''The Guardian'' from obtaining a [[fair trial|fair hearing]]. Section 13 of the [[Defamation Act 1996]], was subsequently enacted to permit [[Member of Parliament|MP]]s to waive their [[parliamentary privilege]] and thus cite their own speeches if relevant to litigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Alexander Horne |author2=Oonagh Gay |title=Ending the Hamilton Affair? |url=http://ukconstitutionallaw.org/2014/05/21/alexander-horne-and-oonagh-gay-ending-the-hamilton-affair/ |publisher=UK Constitutional Law Association Blog |accessdate=19 March 2015 |date=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|United Kingdom European Union membership referendum]] in 2016, the Bill of Rights was quoted in a court ruling on a legal challenge seeking a judicial declaration that [[R (Miller and Dos Santos) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union|triggering EU exit must first be authorised by an act of Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;This subordination of the Crown (i.e. the executive government) to law is the foundation of the rule of law in the United Kingdom. It has its roots well before the war between the Crown and Parliament in the seventeenth century but was decisively confirmed in the settlement arrived at with the Glorious Revolution in 1688 and has been recognised ever since,&lt;br&gt;Sir Edward Coke reports the considered view of himself and the senior judges of the time in The [[Case of Proclamations]] (1610) 12&amp;nbsp;Co. Rep.&amp;nbsp;74, that:&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;blockquote&gt;the King by his proclamation or other ways cannot change any part of the common law, or statute law, or the customs of the realm"
and that:&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;blockquote&gt;the King hath no prerogative, but that which the law of the land allows him."
The position was confirmed in the first two parts of Section&amp;nbsp;1 of the Bill of Rights 1688:&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;blockquote&gt;Suspending power – That the pretended power of suspending of laws or the execution of laws by regall authority without consent of Parlyament is illegall.
:Late dispensing power – That the pretended power of dispensing with laws or the execution of laws by regall authoritie as it hath beene assumed and exercised of late is illegall."

The Bill of Rights was invoked in New Zealand in the 1976 case of ''[[Fitzgerald v Muldoon and Others]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Constitutional Setting |url=http://www.ssc.govt.nz/display/document.asp?docid=4277&amp;pageno=3 |publisher=States Services Commission, New Zealand |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016073216/http://www.ssc.govt.nz/display/document.asp?docid=4277 |archivedate=16 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; which centred on the purporting of newly appointed Prime Minister [[Robert Muldoon]] that he would advise the [[Governor-General]] to abolish a [[superannuation]] scheme established by the New Zealand Superannuation Act, 1974, without new legislation. Muldoon felt that the dissolution would be immediate and he would later introduce a bill in parliament to retroactively make the abolition legal. This claim was challenged in court and the [[Chief Justice]] declared that Muldoon's actions were illegal as they had violated Article&amp;nbsp;1 of the Bill of Rights, which provides "that the pretended power of dispensing with laws or the execution of laws by regal authority ... is illegal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The legitimacy of judicial review of executive decision-making|url=http://www.lawsociety.org.nz/publications_and_submissions/lawtalk/2010_issues/lawtalk,_issue_743/the_legitimacy_of_judicial_review_of_executive_decision-making |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204112322/http://www.lawsociety.org.nz/publications_and_submissions/lawtalk/2010_issues/lawtalk,_issue_743/the_legitimacy_of_judicial_review_of_executive_decision-making |archivedate=4 February 2010 |publisher=New Zealand Law Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3042">{{short description|unwanted secondary product of an item or process}}
A '''by-product''' is a secondary product derived from a manufacturing process or chemical reaction. It is not the primary product or service being produced. In the context of [[Manufacturing|production]], a by-product is the 'output from a joint production process that is minor in quantity and/or [[net realizable value]] (NRV) when compared with the main products'.&lt;ref&gt;Wouters, Mark; Selto, Frank H.; Hilton, Ronald W.; Maher, Michael W. (2012): ''Cost Management: Strategies for Business Decisions'', International Edition, McGraw-Hill, p. 535.&lt;/ref&gt; Because they are deemed to have no influence on reported financial results, by-products do not receive allocations of [[joint cost]]s. By-products also by convention are not inventoried, but the NRV from by-products is typically recognized as 'other income' or as a reduction of [[joint production process]]ing costs when the by-product is produced.&lt;ref&gt;[[World Trade Organization]] (2004): ''United States - Final dumping determination on softwood lumber from Canada'', WT/DS264/AB/R, 11 August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; A by-product can be useful and marketable or it can be considered waste. For example, [[bran]] is a byproduct of the [[mill (grinding)|milling]] of refined [[flour]], sometimes [[compost]]ed or burned for disposal but in other cases used as a nutritious ingredient in [[food]] or [[animal feed|feed]], and [[gasoline]] was once a byproduct of [[oil refinery|oil refining]] that later became a desirable [[commodity]] as [[motor fuel]].

[[International Energy Agency|IEA]] defines "by-product" in the context of [[life-cycle assessment]]: "... main products, co-products (which involve similar revenues to the main product), by-products (which result in smaller revenues), and waste products (which provide little or no revenue)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ieabioenergy-task38.org/systemdefining/biomitre_technical_manual.pdf# |title=BIOMITRE Technical Manual, Horne, R. E. and Matthews, R., November 2004 |access-date=2011-02-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726171133/http://www.ieabioenergy-task38.org/systemdefining/biomitre_technical_manual.pdf# |archive-date=2011-07-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some chemists treat "by-product" and "side-product" as synonyms in the above sense of a generic secondary (untargeted) product, others find it useful to distinguish the two.  When the two terms are distinguished, "by-product" is used to refer to a product that is not desired but inevitably results from molecular fragments of starting materials and/or reagents that are not incorporated into the desired product, as a consequence of conservation of mass.  In contrast, "side-product" is used to refer to a product that is formed from a competitive process that could, in principle, be suppressed by optimization of reaction conditions.

The '''Canadian Arrow''' was a privately funded, early-2000s [[rocket]] and [[space tourism]] project concept founded by [[London, Ontario]], [[Canada]] [[entrepreneurs]] Geoff Sheerin, Dan McKibbon and Chris Corke. The project's objective was to take the first civilians into [[space]], on a vertical [[sub-orbital spaceflight]] reaching an altitude of 112&amp;nbsp;km.

Canadian Arrow was considered one of the top three candidates for the [[Ansari X Prize|X-Prize]] competition{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}, along with [[Scaled Composites]] ([[Burt Rutan]]), and [[Armadillo Aerospace]] ([[John D. Carmack|John Carmack]]). Scaled Composites won the competition on October 4, 2004.

The Canadian Arrow team's motto was "making SPACE for you". They have completed the first series of tests on their 57,000&amp;nbsp;lbf (254&amp;nbsp;kN) thrust engine and have built a space training centre and a full-scale mock-up of their rocket.  After an open nomination process, they also recruited a team of six astronauts from around the world, including several seasoned military pilots and a [[NASA]] trained [[astronaut]] from [[Ukraine]]. Astronaut candidates – the group "Arrow Six" includes David Ballinger, Ted Gow, Terry Wong, Jason Dyer, Larry Clark and Yaroslav "Yarko" Pustovyi, the only member of the team with actual space training.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aero-news.net/index.cfm?do=main.textpost&amp;id=fde1ebe9-d043-4449-b7f6-4550a721b4c9]&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010 Geoff Sheerin, the president of Canadian Arrow stated the company is unlikely to fly a Canadian Arrow rocket as a space tourism vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2010/11/12/spaceflight-x-prize-feeney-da-vinci.html#ixzz15AikHdWo CBC News - Canadian space flight dreams live on]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
[[Image:Canadian arrow.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A rendering of a Canadian Arrow vehicle in flight.]]
The Canadian Arrow is a 16.5 m tall two-stage rocket, where the second stage is a three-person space capsule. The Canadian Arrow team's somewhat conservative approach has been to base the design of their rocket engine and aerodynamics on the well proven [[V-2 rocket|V-2]] design from [[World War II|WWII]].

===First stage===
The rocket's first stage is 10.2 m long and 1.7 m in diameter.  It is propelled by a single liquid fuel rocket engine. It produces a thrust of 254 [[kilonewton|kN]]. Graphite jet vanes are used for stabilisation before the rocket has reached a velocity high enough for the four fins to be effective. About one minute after ignition, the fuel is depleted and the engine shuts off.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

===Second stage===
The rocket's second stage is 6 m long and 1.7 m in diameter at the base. It carries three astronauts and is propelled by four [[JATO]]-type solid rocket engines. These are ignited immediately after stage separation, and will carry the capsule to an altitude of ~112&amp;nbsp;km. Cold gas jets were planned to be used for attitude control.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

===Crew Cabin Escape System===
The design proposed four solid rocket engines in the second stage that could be fired at any time, even when the rocket stands on its launch pad. This constitutes an escape system, which can, in a case of an emergency, quickly separate the second stage from the rocket and propel it to an altitude of 1.5&amp;nbsp;km, where its parachutes can be deployed.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

===Rocket engine===
The rocket engine was to use alcohol and liquid oxygen as propellants, and produces a maximum thrust of 254 [[Kilonewton|kN]], and burns for 55 s. It is constructed of low carbon steel, with propellant injectors made out of [[brass]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===Flight profile===
The Canadian Arrow rocket will launch vertically from the ground. Initial thrust is ~75.5&amp;nbsp;kN, but the rocket quickly reaches maximum thrust. After 55 s, the propellant is depleted and stage separation occurs. The solid fuel rockets in the second stage are ignited and boosts it up to an altitude of ~112&amp;nbsp;km, where the crew and passengers will experience a few minutes of "zero-G", or weightlessness.

After stage separation the first stage reaches an apogee of over 80&amp;nbsp;km before descent begins. Four parachutes slow the Canadian Arrow's first stage down before splashdown occurs at a speed of ~9&amp;nbsp;m/s, after which recovery of the spacecraft can take place.

During descent, the crew cabin (the second stage) was planned to use a [[ballute]] to reduce its speed. When its velocity becomes subsonic, the second stage's ballute was to be released and pull out the three parachutes before splashdown.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==Funding, commercial aspects and the future==
Canadian Arrow started as a team competing in the international X-Prize competition, with the ultimate goal of continuing past the X-Prize into the commercial sector providing private access to space. Funding during the X-Prize was provided by sponsorship and private investment.
In early 2003 the company would receive a major infusion of financial support by Canadian Arrow partner and Director of Spacecraft Development - Lou van Amelsvoort.
As a result, during the next two years The Company would also proceed to open the world's first private Astronaut training facility, continue vehicle development, and test propulsion and recovery systems.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Geoff Sheerin, president and CEO of Canadian Arrow, and Dr. [[Chirinjeev Kathuria]] announced on May 17, 2005, the creation of [[PlanetSpace|PlanetSpace Corporation]]. It is through this enterprise that Canadian Arrow will complete the construction of their space craft, and within 24 months offer suborbital space flight to aspiring space tourists. Planetspace expects to fly about 2,000 new astronauts within five years of operation. The price is expected to be $250,000 for each flight, including fourteen days of training. [[Cape Breton Island]], in [[Nova Scotia]] is being considered as a launch site, and a contract has been signed with the government of Nova Scotia to provide {{convert|120|acre|km2}} of land for the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

A requirement of the X-Prize for each participating company was to propose other possible markets for their spacecraft.  Canadian Arrow coined the term "Spacediving", while investigating the possible use of Canadian Arrow spacecraft for a high altitude version of skydiving.

On November 11, 2005 Canadian Arrow teamed up with former X-Prize competitor Romanian aerospace company, [[ARCASPACE]], to develop privately built spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On December 15, 2005 [[PlanetSpace|PlanetSpace Corporation]] unveiled plans for an orbital commercial vehicle capable of carrying eight passengers.  This vehicle to be called the [[Silver Dart (spacecraft)|Silver Dart]] is based on the [[U.S. Air Force]]'s [[Martin-Marietta X-24|Flight Dynamics Laboratory-7]] [[lifting body]] program from the 1970s.

On June 21, 2013 Blackburn news reported that the full scale engineering mock-up of the Canadian Arrow rocket was purchased by Sarnia Ontario's Preferred Towing. Having spent several years at Chris Hatfield Airport in Sarnia, Ontario, Preferred Towing expressed interest in hopes of restoring the rocket for display in Sarnia.  This plan has since been scrapped and the mock-up no longer exists.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6166">The '''Carltona doctrine''' (or '''Carltona principle''') expresses the idea that, in [[United Kingdom law]], the acts of government departmental officials are synonymous with the actions of the [[Minister (government)|minister]] in charge of that department. The point was established in ''Carltona Ltd v Commissioners of Works.''&lt;ref&gt;[1943] 2 All ER 560 (CA)&lt;/ref&gt;

==The judgment in ''Carltona''==

Faced with the requisition of their factory by the war-time government, the factory owners raised a [[Judicial Review in English Law|judicial review]] action to challenge the legality of the requisition order. The order had been made under the auspices of the Defence (General) Regulations 1939, which authorised the Commissioners of Works to requisition such land as they deemed necessary in the national interest. The Regulations specified that the Commissioner's powers were exercisable by, ''inter alia'' the Minister of Works and Planning. The factory owners sought to argue that the requisition was invalid because the order had not in fact been signed by the minister, but by an official within the Ministry of Works and Planning. In rejecting this contention, the [[Master of the Rolls]], [[Lord Greene]], acknowledged the realities of [[government]] in the 20th century:

{{Quotation|
"In the administration of government in this country the functions which are given to ministers (and constitutionally properly given to ministers because they are constitutionally responsible) are functions so multifarious that no minister could ever personally attend to them...[therefore] The duties imposed upon ministers and the powers given to ministers are normally exercised under the authority of ministers by responsible officials of the department. Public business could not be carried on if that were not the case."}}

This statement of the way government operates has only become more true in recent decades as increased state interventionism and juridification have produced a rapid growth in the use of [[delegated legislation]]. Clearly, confronted with this reality, it would have been preposterous for the Court to construe the wording of the Regulations so narrowly that only the Minister, in person, could exercise the powers. Thus Lord Greene explained that:

{{Quotation|
"Constitutionally, the decision of such an official is, of course, the decision of the minister."}}

It should be emphasised that the essence of the ''Carltona'' doctrine therefore lies in the elision of the identity of departmental officials with the relevant Minister. It is emphatically not the case that the Minister has delegated his decision-making power to a subordinate and therefore the doctrine achieves consistency with the principle that Parliament's delegatees have, unless specifically provided by statute, no power to delegate ([[Delegata potestas non potest delegari|''delegatus non potest delegare'']]).

Lord Greene proceeded to reconcile this with the doctrine of parliamentary accountability on the basis that:

{{Quotation|
"It is he [the minister] who must answer before Parliament for anything that his officials have done under his authority, and, if for an important matter he selected an official of such junior standing that he could not be expected competently to perform the work, the minister would have to answer for that in Parliament. The whole system of departmental organisation and administration is based on the view that ministers, being responsible to Parliament, will see that important duties are committed to experienced officials. If they do not do that, Parliament is the place where complaint must be made against them."}}

==Scope of the rule==

Despite suggestions to the contrary by some academic commentators,&lt;ref&gt;De Smith, Woolf and Jowell ''Judicial Review of Administrative Action'' (5th edn.) para. 6-114&lt;/ref&gt; it seems that there is no restriction on the applicability of the doctrine on account of the nature of the power being wielded. In ''HMA v. Copeland''&lt;ref&gt;1988 SLT 249&lt;/ref&gt; it was opined, by the [[High Court of Justiciary|highest criminal court in Scotland]] that:

{{Quotation|
" ...there is no obligation on the minister to exercise his powers personally even when those powers involve a serious invasion of the freedom or property rights of the subject."
}}

However, in some instances Parliament has chosen to statutorily override this position by providing that the relevant minister must exercise the power in person.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. s.60(9)(a) Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 (c.33) ("and not by a person acting under his authority") [https://archive.is/20120805181602/http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;Year=1999&amp;number=33&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=1888846&amp;ActiveTextDocId=1888933&amp;filesize=7868]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ireland ==

The [[Supreme Court of Ireland]] has confirmed that the Carltona doctrine applies to its fullest extent to the Irish civil service also- see ''Devanney v'' ''Shields'' [1998] 2 I.R. 230.

'''Causality''' is the relationship between [[cause]]s and effects.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Celia (2003). ''The Lost Cause: Causation and the Mind–Body Problem''. Oxford: Oxford Forum. {{ISBN|0-9536772-1-4}}. Includes three chapters on causality at the microlevel in physics.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bunge, Mario (1959). ''Causality: the place of the causal principle in modern science''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered to be fundamental to all natural [[science]], especially [[physics]]. [[Causality]] is also a topic studied from the perspectives of [[philosophy]] and [[statistics]]. Causality means that an effect cannot occur from a cause that is not in the back (past) [[light cone]] of that event. Similarly, a cause cannot have an effect outside its front (future) light cone.

==Causality in physics==

In classical physics, an effect cannot occur ''before'' its cause. In Einstein's theory of special&lt;!--To just say 'the theory of relativity' is wrong; Einstein had two theories.--&gt; relativity, causality means that an effect can not occur from a cause that is not in the back (past) [[light cone]] of that event. Similarly, a cause cannot have an effect outside its front (future) light cone. These restrictions are consistent with the grounded belief (or assumption) that causal influences cannot travel faster than the speed of light and/or backwards in time. In quantum field theory, observables of events with a spacelike relationship, "elsewhere", have to commute, so the order of observations or measurements of such observables do not impact each other.

Causality in this context should not be confused with [[Second law of motion|Newton's second law]], which is related to the conservation of momentum, and is a consequence of the spatial homogeneity of physical laws. The word causality in this context means that all effects must have specific causes&lt;ref&gt;"Causality." Cambridge English Dictionary. Accessed November 18, 2018. https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/causality&lt;/ref&gt;. As discussed below, this is a principle that is violated in some theories of modern physics.

Another requirement, at least valid at the level of human experience, is that cause and effect be mediated across space and time (requirement of ''contiguity''). This requirement has been very influential in the past, in the first place as a result of direct observation of causal processes (like pushing a cart), in the second place as a problematic aspect of Newton's theory of gravitation (attraction of the earth by the sun by means of [[Action at a distance (physics)|action at a distance]]) replacing mechanistic proposals like [[The World (Descartes)#Descartes' Universe|Descartes' vortex theory]]; in the third place as an incentive to develop dynamic [[Classical field theory|field theories]] (e.g., [[Electromagnetism#Classical electrodynamics|Maxwell's electrodynamics]] and [[Einstein field equations|Einstein's general theory of relativity]]) restoring contiguity in the transmission of influences in a more successful way than did Descartes' theory.

The empiricists' aversion to metaphysical explanations (like Descartes' vortex theory) lends heavy influence against the idea of the importance of causality. Causality has accordingly sometimes been downplayed (e.g., Newton's "[[Hypotheses non fingo]]"). According to [[Ernst Mach]]&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Mach, ''Die Mechanik in ihrer Entwicklung, Historisch-kritisch dargestellt'', Akademie-Verlag, Berlin, 1988, section 2.7.&lt;/ref&gt; the notion of force in Newton's second law was [[Pleonasm|pleonastic]], tautological and superfluous. Indeed, it is possible to consider the Newtonian equations of motion of the gravitational interaction of two bodies,

:&lt;math&gt; m_1 \frac{d^2 {\mathbf r}_1 }{ dt^2} = -\frac{m_1 m_2 g ({\mathbf r}_1 - {\mathbf r}_2)}{ |{\mathbf r}_1 - {\mathbf r}_2|^3};\; m_2 \frac{d^2 {\mathbf r}_2 }{dt^2} = -\frac{m_1 m_2 g ({\mathbf r}_2 - {\mathbf r}_1) }{ |{\mathbf r}_2 - {\mathbf r}_1|^3}, &lt;/math&gt;

as two coupled equations describing the positions &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle {\mathbf r}_1(t) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle {\mathbf r}_2(t) &lt;/math&gt; of the two bodies, ''without interpreting the right hand sides of these equations as forces''; the equations just describe a process of interaction, without any necessity to interpret one body as the cause of the motion of the other, and allow one to predict the states of the system at later (as well as earlier) times.

The ordinary situations in which humans singled out some factors in a physical interaction as being prior and therefore supplying the "because" of the interaction were often ones in which humans decided to bring about some state of affairs and directed their energies to producing that state of affairs—a process that took time to establish and left a new state of affairs that persisted beyond the time of activity of the actor. It would be difficult and pointless, however, to explain the motions of binary stars with respect to each other in that way.

The possibility of such a time-independent view is at the basis of the [[deductive-nomological]] (D-N) view of scientific explanation, considering an event to be explained if it can be subsumed under a scientific law. In the D-N view, a physical state is considered to be explained if, applying the (deterministic) law, it can be derived from given initial conditions. (Such initial conditions could include the momenta and distance from each other of binary stars at any given moment.) Such 'explanation by determinism' is sometimes referred to as [[Determinism#Varieties|causal determinism]]. A disadvantage of the D-N view is that causality and determinism are more or less identified. Thus, in [[classical physics]], it was assumed that all events are caused by earlier ones according to the known laws of nature, culminating in [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]]'s claim that if the current state of the world were known with precision, it could be computed for any time in the future or the past (see [[Laplace's demon]]). However, this is usually referred to as Laplace ''determinism'' (rather than `Laplace causality') because it hinges on [[Determinism#In mathematical models|determinism in mathematical models]] as dealt with in the mathematical [[Cauchy problem]]. Confusion of causality and determinism is particularly acute in [[quantum mechanics]], this theory being acausal in the sense that it is unable in many cases to identify the causes of actually observed effects or to predict the effects of identical causes, but arguably [[Quantum mechanics#Theory|deterministic]] in some interpretations (e.g. if the wave function is presumed not to actually collapse as in the [[many-worlds interpretation]], or if its collapse is due to [[hidden variable theory|hidden variables]], or simply redefining determinism as meaning that probabilities rather than specific effects are determined).

In [[modern physics]], the notion of causality had to be clarified. The insights of the theory of [[special relativity]] confirmed the assumption of causality, but they made the meaning of the word "simultaneous" observer-dependent.&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Einstein|A. Einstein]], "Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Koerper", ''Annalen der Physik'' '''17''', 891–921 (1905).&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the relativistic principle of causality says that the cause must precede its effect ''according to all [[inertial]] observers''. This is equivalent to the statement that the cause and its effect are separated by a [[timelike]] interval, and the effect belongs to the future of its cause. If a timelike interval separates the two events, this means that a signal could be sent between them at less than the speed of light. On the other hand, if signals could move faster than the speed of light, this would violate causality because it would allow a signal to be sent across [[spacelike]] intervals, which means that at least to some inertial observers the signal would travel ''backward in time''. For this reason, special relativity does not allow communication faster than the [[speed of light]].

In the theory of [[general relativity]], the concept of causality is generalized in the most straightforward way: the effect must belong to the future light cone of its cause, even if the [[spacetime]] is curved. New subtleties must be taken into account when we investigate causality in [[quantum mechanics]] and relativistic [[quantum field theory]] in particular. In quantum field theory, causality is closely related to the [[principle of locality]]. However, the principle of locality is disputed: whether it strictly holds depends on the [[interpretation of quantum mechanics]] chosen, especially for experiments involving [[quantum entanglement]] that satisfy [[Bell's Theorem]].

Despite these subtleties, causality remains an important and valid concept in physical theories. For example, the notion that events can be ordered into causes and effects is necessary to prevent (or at least outline) [[causality paradox]]es such as the [[grandfather paradox]], which asks what happens if a time-traveler kills his own grandfather before he ever meets the time-traveler's grandmother. See also [[Chronology protection conjecture]].

===Distributed causality===

Theories in [[physics]] like the [[butterfly effect]] from [[chaos theory]] open up the possibility of a type of [[distributed parameter systems]] in causality. {{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} The butterfly effect theory proposes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Small variations of the initial condition of a nonlinear dynamical system may produce large variations in the long term behavior of the system."&lt;/blockquote&gt; This opens up the opportunity to understand a distributed causality.

A related way to interpret the butterfly effect is to see it as highlighting the difference between the application of the notion of causality in physics and a [[Causality|more general use of causality]] as represented by [[INUS|Mackie's INUS conditions]]. In classical (Newtonian) physics, in general, only those conditions are (explicitly) taken into account, that are both necessary and sufficient. For instance, when a massive sphere is caused to roll down a slope starting from a point of [[Mechanical equilibrium|unstable equilibrium]], then its velocity is assumed to be caused by the force of gravity accelerating it; the small push that was needed to set it into motion is not explicitly dealt with as a cause. In order to be a physical cause there must be a certain proportionality with the ensuing effect. A distinction is drawn between triggering and causation of the ball's motion. By the same token the butterfly can be seen as triggering a tornado, its cause being assumed to be seated in the atmospherical energies already present beforehand, rather than in the movements of a butterfly.

===Causal dynamical triangulation===
{{main|Causal dynamical triangulation}}
'''Causal dynamical triangulation''' (abbreviated as "CDT") invented by [[Renate Loll]], [[Jan Ambjorn|Jan Ambjørn]] and [[Jerzy Jurkiewicz]], and popularized by [[Fotini Markopoulou]] and [[Lee Smolin]], is an approach to [[quantum gravity]] that like [[loop quantum gravity]] is [[background independent]]. This means that it does not assume any pre-existing arena (dimensional space), but rather attempts to show how the [[spacetime]] fabric itself evolves. The [http://loops05.aei.mpg.de/ Loops '05] conference, hosted by many loop quantum gravity theorists, included several presentations which discussed CDT in great depth, and revealed it to be a pivotal insight for theorists. It has sparked considerable interest as it appears to have a good semi-classical description. At large scales, it re-creates the familiar 4-dimensional spacetime, but it shows spacetime to be 2-d near the [[Planck scale]], and reveals a [[fractal]] structure on slices of constant time. Using a structure called a [[simplex]], it divides spacetime into tiny triangular sections. A simplex is the generalized form of a [[triangle]], in various dimensions. A 3-simplex is usually called a [[tetrahedron]], and the 4-simplex, which is the basic building block in this theory, is also known as the pentatope, or [[pentachoron]]. Each simplex is geometrically flat, but simplices can be "glued" together in a variety of ways to create curved spacetimes. Where previous attempts at triangulation of quantum spaces have produced jumbled universes with far too many dimensions, or minimal universes with too few, CDT avoids this problem by allowing only those configurations where cause precedes any effect. In other words, the timelines of all joined edges of simplices must agree.

Thus, maybe, causality lies in the foundation of the [[spacetime]] geometry.

===Causal sets===
{{main|Causal sets}}
In causal set theory, causality takes an even more prominent place. The basis for this approach to quantum gravity is in a theorem by [[David Malament]]. This theorem states that the [[causal structure]] of a spacetime suffices to reconstruct its [[conformal class]]. So knowing the conformal factor and the causal structure is enough to know the spacetime. Based on this, [[Rafael Sorkin]] proposed the idea of Causal Set Theory, which is a fundamentally discrete approach to quantum gravity. The causal structure of the spacetime is represented as a [[Poset]], while the conformal factor can be reconstructed by identifying each poset element with a unit volume.

'''Chinese Whispers''' is a clustering method used in network science named after the famous [[Chinese whispers|whispering game]].&lt;ref name= "Biemann2006"&gt;Chris Biemann,[http://wortschatz.uni-leipzig.de/~cbiemann/pub/2006/BiemannTextGraph06.pdf "Chinese Whispers- an Efficient Graph Clustering Algorithm and its Applications to Natural Language Processing Problems"], 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Clustering methods are basically used to identify communities of nodes or links in a given network. This algorithm was designed by [[Chris Biemann]] and [[Sven Teresniak]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="Biemann2006"/&gt; The name comes from the fact that the process can be modeled as a separation of communities where the nodes send the same type of information to each other.&lt;ref name="Biemann2006"/&gt;

Chinese Whispers is a hard partitioning, randomized, flat clustering (no [[hierarchical clustering|hierarchical relations between clusters]]) method.&lt;ref name="Biemann2006"/&gt; The random property means that running the process on the same network several times can lead to different results, while because of hard partitioning one node can only belong to one cluster at a given moment.  The original algorithm is applicable to undirected, weighted and unweighted graphs. Chinese Whispers is time linear which means that it is extremely fast even if the number of nodes and links are very high in the network.&lt;ref name="Biemann2006"/&gt;

==Algorithm==
[[File:Chinese Whispers example cluster.png|thumb|right|An example of how Chinese Whispers works in action. The different colors represent different classes.]]

The algorithm works in the following way in an undirected unweighted graph:&lt;ref name="Biemann2006"/&gt;
# All nodes are assigned to a random class. The number of initial classes equals the number of nodes.
# Then all of the network nodes are selected one by one in a random order. Every node moves to the class which the given node connects with the most links. In the case of equality the cluster is randomly chosen from the equally linked classes.
# Step two repeats itself until a predetermined number of iteration or until the process converges. In the end the emerging classes represent the clusters of the network.

The predetermined threshold for the number of the iterations is needed because it is possible that process does not converge. On the other hand in a network with approximately 10000 nodes the clusters does not change significantly after 40-50 iterations even if there is no convergence.&lt;ref name="Biemann2006"/&gt;

==Strengths and Weaknesses==

The main strength of Chinese Whispers lies in its time linear property. Because of the processing time increases linearly with the number of nodes, the algorithm is capable of identifying communities in a network very fast. For this reason Chinese Whispers is a good tool to analyze community structures in graph with a very high number of nodes. The effectiveness of the method increases further if the network has the [[Small-world experiment|small world property]].&lt;ref name="Biemann2006"/&gt;

On the other hand because the algorithm is not deterministic in the case of small node number the resulting clusters often significantly differ from each other. The reason for this is that in the case of a small network it matters more from which node the iteration process starts while in large networks the relevance of starting points disappears.&lt;ref name="Biemann2006"/&gt; For this reason for small graphs other clustering methods are recommended.

==Applications==

Chinese Whispers is used in many subfield of network science. Most frequently it is mentioned in the context of [[Natural Language Processing]] problems.&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Di Marco - Roberto Navigili,[http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/full/10.1162/COLI_a_00148#.VW4sDc_tmko "Clustering and Diversifying Web Search Results with Graph Based Word Sense Induction"], 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ioannis Korkontzelos - Suresh Manandhar,[http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P09-2017 "Detecting Compositionality in Multi-Word Expressions"], 2009&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand the algorithm is applicable to any kind of community identification problem which is related to a network framework. Chinese Whispers is available for personal use as an extension package for [[Gephi]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://marketplace.gephi.org/plugin/chinese-whispers-clustering/ "Gephi Marketplace" ]&lt;/ref&gt; which is an [[Open-source software|open source]] program designed for network analysis.

[[File:Circuit diagram – pictorial and schematic.png|right|thumb|250px|Comparison of pictorial and schematic styles of circuit diagrams]]

[[File:Circuit elements.svg|right|thumbnail|250px|Common schematic diagram symbols (US symbols)]]

[[File:4 bit counter.svg|right|thumbnail|250px|The circuit diagram for a four-bit [[Transistor-transistor logic|TTL]] counter, a type of [[state machine]]]]

A '''circuit diagram''' ('''electrical diagram''', '''elementary diagram''', '''electronic schematic''') is a graphical representation of an [[Electrical network|electrical circuit]]. A [[pictorial]] circuit diagram uses simple images of components, while a [[schematic diagram]] shows the components and interconnections of the circuit using standardized symbolic representations. The presentation of the interconnections between circuit components in the schematic diagram does not necessarily correspond to the physical arrangements in the finished device.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kpsec.freeuk.com/cdiags.htm Circuit diagrams and component layouts]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike a [[block diagram]] or [[Integrated circuit layout|layout diagram]], a circuit diagram shows the actual [[electrical connection]]s. A drawing meant to depict the physical arrangement of the wires and the components they connect is called ''artwork'' or ''[[Integrated circuit layout|layout]]'', ''physical design'', or ''[[wiring diagram]]''.

Circuit diagrams are used for the design ([[circuit design]]), construction (such as [[Printed circuit board|PCB]] layout), and maintenance of electrical and electronic equipment.

In [[computer science]], circuit diagrams are useful when visualizing expressions using [[Boolean algebra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Herzfeld|first=Noreen|title=Computer Concepts and Applications|year=2012|publisher=College of Saint Benedict/St. John's University|location=Minnesota|pages=9[6]-9[12]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbols==
{{Main|Electronic symbol}}
Circuit diagrams are pictures with symbols that have differed from country to country and have changed over time, but are now to a large extent internationally standardized. Simple components often had symbols intended to represent some feature of the physical construction of the device. For example, the symbol for a resistor shown here dates back to the days when that component was made from a long piece of wire wrapped in such a manner as to not produce inductance, which would have made it a [[inductor|coil]]. These wirewound resistors are now used only in high-power applications, smaller resistors being cast from ''carbon composition'' (a mixture of [[carbon]] and [[Filler (materials)|filler]]) or fabricated as an insulating tube or chip coated with a metal film. The internationally standardized symbol for a resistor is therefore now simplified to an oblong, sometimes with the value in [[ohm]]s written inside, instead of the zig-zag symbol. A less common symbol is simply a series of peaks on one side of the line representing the conductor, rather than back-and-forth as shown here.

[[File:Wire Crossover Symbols for Circuit Diagrams.png|500px|thumb|'''Wire Crossover Symbols for Circuit Diagrams.''' The [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] symbol for insulated crossing wires is the same as the older, non-CAD symbol for non-insulated crossing wires. To avoid confusion, the wire "jump" (semi-circle) symbol for insulated wires in non-CAD schematics is recommended (as opposed to using the CAD-style symbol for no connection), so as to avoid confusion with the original, older style symbol, which means the exact opposite. The newer, recommended style for 4-way wire connections in both CAD and non-CAD schematics is to stagger the joining wires into T-junctions.&lt;ref name = "electronicsclub.info"&gt;{{cite web|title=Circuit Symbols|url=http://electronicsclub.info/circuitsymbols.htm|website=electronicsclub.info|accessdate=2 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The linkages between leads were once simple crossings of lines.  With the arrival of computerized drafting, the connection of two intersecting wires was shown by a crossing of wires with a "dot" or "blob" to indicate a connection. At the same time, the crossover was simplified to be the same crossing, but without a "dot". However, there was a danger of confusing the wires that were connected and not connected in this manner, if the dot was drawn too small or accidentally omitted (e.g. the "dot" could disappear after several passes through a copy machine).&lt;ref&gt;
"It is good practice to never use a + connection with a dot. Why? The dot can disappear when the schematic is copied for the 12th time." --
[http://www.siteswithstyle.com/VoltSecond/Schematic_notes/Schematic_reading_notes.html "Notes on Reading Schematics"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008031902/http://www.siteswithstyle.com/VoltSecond/Schematic_notes/Schematic_reading_notes.html |date=2011-10-08 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, the modern practice for representing a 4-way wire connection is to draw a straight wire and then to draw the other wires staggered along it with "dots" as connections (see diagram), so as to form two separate T-junctions that brook no confusion and are clearly not a crossover.&lt;ref&gt;
"We recommend against using a 4-way connection point ... To avoid confusion, use only three-way connections." --
[http://www.engr.colostate.edu/~dga/mech307/project_report_samples/GF_Guidelines_8.pdf "Design News Gadget Freak Submission Guidelines"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929002946/http://www.engr.colostate.edu/~dga/mech307/project_report_samples/GF_Guidelines_8.pdf |date=2011-09-29 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
"Wires connected at 'crossroads' should be staggered slightly to form two T-junctions" --
[http://www.kpsec.freeuk.com/symbol.htm "The Electronics Club: Circuit Symbols"]
&lt;/ref&gt;

For crossing wires that are insulated from one another, a small semi-circle symbol is commonly used to show one wire "jumping over" the other wire&lt;ref name = "electronicsclub.info" /&gt;&lt;ref name="circuitstoday"&gt;{{cite web|title=Electronic Circuit Symbols |url=http://www.circuitstoday.com/electronic-circuit-symbols |website=www.circuitstoday.com |accessdate=2 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013185140/http://www.circuitstoday.com/electronic-circuit-symbols |archivedate=13 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electronicshub.org/symbols/ Electronics Circuit Symbols]&lt;/ref&gt; (similar to how jumper wires are used).

A common, hybrid style of drawing combines the T-junction crossovers with "dot" connections and the wire "jump" semi-circle symbols for insulated crossings. In this manner, a "dot" that is too small to see or that has accidentally disappeared can still be clearly differentiated from a "jump".&lt;ref name = "electronicsclub.info" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "circuitstoday" /&gt;

On a circuit diagram, the [[electronic symbol|symbols]] for components are labelled with a descriptor or [[reference designator]] matching that on the list of parts. For example, C1 is the first [[capacitor]], L1 is the first [[inductor]], Q1 is the first [[transistor]], and R1 is the first [[resistor]]. Often the value or type designation of the component is given on the diagram beside the part, but detailed specifications would go on the parts list.

Detailed rules for reference designations are provided in the International standard [[IEC 61346]].

==Organization==
It is a usual although not universal convention that schematic drawings are organized on the page from left to right and top to bottom in the same sequence as the flow of the main signal or power path.  For example, a schematic for a radio receiver might start with the antenna input at the left of the page and end with the loudspeaker at the right.  Positive power supply connections for each stage would be shown towards the top of the page, with grounds, negative supplies, or other return paths towards the bottom.  Schematic drawings intended for maintenance may have the principal signal paths highlighted to assist in understanding the signal flow through the circuit.   More complex devices have multi-page schematics and must rely on cross-reference symbols to show the flow of signals between the different sheets of the drawing.

Detailed rules for the preparation of circuit diagrams, and other document types used in electrotechnology, are provided in the international standard [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] [[IEC 61082|61082-1]].

[[Relay logic]] line diagrams, also called [[ladder logic]] diagrams, use another common standardized convention for organizing schematic drawings, with a vertical power supply rail on the left and another on the right, and components strung between them like the rungs of a ladder.

==Artwork==
[[File:Rats nest diagram.JPG|right|thumbnail|A rat's nest]]
Once the schematic has been made, it is converted into a layout that can be fabricated onto a printed circuit board (PCB). [[Schematic-driven layout]] starts with the process of [[schematic capture]]. The result is what is known as a rat's nest. The rat's nest is a jumble of wires (lines) criss-crossing each other to their destination nodes. These wires are routed either manually or automatically by the use of electronics design automation (EDA) tools. The EDA tools arrange and rearrange the placement of components and find paths for tracks to connect various nodes. This results in the final [[Integrated circuit layout|layout]] artwork for the [[integrated circuit]] or [[printed circuit board]].&lt;ref&gt;

A generalized design flow may be as follows:
:Schematic → schematic capture → [[netlist]] → rat's nest → [[routing (electronic design automation)|routing]] → artwork → PCB development and etching → component mounting → testing

==Education==
Teaching about the functioning of electrical circuits is often on primary and secondary school curricula.&lt;ref&gt;BBC Bitesize. Circuits. https://www.bbc.com/education/topics/zq99q6f&lt;/ref&gt; Students are expected to understand the rudiments of circuit diagrams and their functioning. Use of diagrammatic representations of circuit diagrams can aid understanding of principles of electricity. 

Principles of the physics of circuit diagrams are often taught with the use of analogies, such as comparing functioning of circuits to other closed systems such as water heating systems with pumps being the equivalent to batteries.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, M. D., &amp; Garlovsky, D. (2016). Going with the flow: Using analogies to explain electric circuits.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7624">[[File:David Orrell at Art Center Global Dialogues.jpg|thumb|David Orrell (left) speaking with [[Robert Matthews (scientist)|Robert Matthews]] at the Art Center Global Dialogues, Barcelona, 2008]]'''David John Orrell''' (born 1962 in [[Edmonton]]) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] writer and [[mathematician]]. He received his doctorate in [[mathematics]] from the [[University of Oxford]]. His work in the prediction of [[complex systems]] such as the [[weather]], [[genetics]] and the [[economy]] has been featured in [[New Scientist]], the [[Financial Times]], [[Adbusters]], [[BBC Radio]], [[Russia-1 (TV channel)|Russia-1]], and [[CBC Television|CBC TV]]. He now conducts research and writes in the areas of [[systems biology]] and [[economics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.postpythagorean.com/bio.html |title=Biography| accessdate=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and runs a mathematical consultancy Systems Forecasting. He is the son of theatre historian and English professor [[John Orrell]].

His books have been translated into over ten languages. ''[[Apollo's Arrow]]: The Science of Prediction and the Future of Everything'' was a national bestseller and finalist for the 2007 Canadian Science Writers' Award. ''[[Economyths]]: Ten Ways Economics Gets It Wrong'' was a finalist for the 2011 National Business Book Award.

==Criticism of use of mathematical models==
A consistent topic in Orrell’s work is the limitations of mathematical models, and the need to acknowledge these limitations if we are to understand the causes of forecast error. He argues for example that errors in weather prediction are caused primarily by model error, rather than the [[butterfly effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Orrell|first=David| last2=Smith | first2 = Leonard | last3=Barkmeijer | first3 = Jan | last4 = Palmer | first4 = Tim | title=Model error in weather forecasting|journal=Nonlinear Proc. Geoph. | year=2001| volume=9 | pages=357–371 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Economic model]]s are seen as particularly unrealistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Orrell|first=David| last2=McSharry| first2 = Patrick| title=System economics: Overcoming the pitfalls of forecasting models via a multidisciplinary approach|journal=International Journal of Forecasting | year=2009| volume=25 | pages=734–743| doi=10.1016/j.ijforecast.2009.05.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Truth or Beauty: Science and the Quest for Order'', he suggests that many such theories, along with areas of physics such as [[string theory]], are motivated largely by the desire to conform with a traditional scientific [[aesthetic]], that is currently being subverted by developments in [[complexity science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last= Shea|first= Christopher |date=29 January 2013 |title=Is Scientific Truth Always Beautiful? |magazine=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quantum theory of money and value==
In ''The Evolution of Money''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Angel|first=James| title=The Evolution of Money. By David Orrell and Roman Chlupatý|journal=Business History Review | year=2017| volume=91 | issue=2 |pages=397-399}}&lt;/ref&gt; (coauthored with journalist Roman Chlupatý) and two articles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Orrell|first=David| title=A Quantum Theory of Money and Value|journal=Economic Thought | year=2016| volume=5 | issue=2 |pages=19-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Orrell|first=David| title=A Quantum Theory of Money and Value, Part 2: The Uncertainty Principle|journal=Economic Thought | year=2017| volume=6 | issue=2 |pages=14-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orrell proposed a quantum theory of money and value, which states that money has dualistic properties because it combines the properties of an owned and valued thing, with those of abstract number. The fact that these two sides of money are incompatible leads to its complex and often unpredictable behavior. In ''Quantum Economics: The New Science of Money'' he argues that these dualistic properties feed up to affect the economy as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Clegg|first=Brian| url= http://popsciencebooks.blogspot.com/2018/07/quantum-economics-david-orrell.html|title=Quantum Economics - David Orrell | date=5 July 2018| accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''De Brevitate Vitae''''' ({{lang-en|On the Shortness of Life}}) is a moral [[essay]] written by [[Seneca the Younger]], a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Stoicism|Stoic]] [[philosopher]], sometime around the year 49 AD, to his father-in-law Paulinus. The philosopher brings up many [[Stoicism|Stoic]] principles on the nature of [[time]], namely that people waste much of it in meaningless pursuits.  According to the essay, nature gives people enough time to do what is really important and the individual must allot it properly. In general, time is best used by living in the present moment in pursuit of the intentional, purposeful life.

Similar ideas can be found in Seneca's treatise ''[[De Otio]]'' (''On Leisure'') and discussion of these themes can often be found in his ''[[Letters to Lucilius]]'' (letter 49, 101, etc.).

==Date and addressee==
The work is addressed to a man called Paulinus&amp;mdash;probably Pompeius Paulinus, a knight of [[Arelate]]&amp;mdash;and is usually dated to around 49 AD. It is clear from chapters 18 and 19 of ''De Brevitate Vitae'' that Paulinus was ''[[praefectus annonae]]'', the official who superintended the grain supply of Rome, and was, therefore, a man of importance. He was likely a near relative of Seneca's wife, [[Pompeia Paulina]], and quite plausibly her father. He is also thought to be the father of another [[Pompeius Paullinus|Pompeius Paulinus]], who held high public posts under [[Nero]] ([[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], ''Nat. Hist.'' xxxiii. 143; [[Tacitus]], ''Annals'', xiii. 53. 2; xv. 18. 4).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lucius Annaeus Seneca:On the Shortness of Life|first=John W.|last=Basore|publisher=William Heinemann Loeb Classical Library|year=1932|page=287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for the date of composition, it must have been after the death of [[Caligula]] (41 AD), which Seneca mentions in §18.5. Furthermore, there are two known periods when Paulinus could have served as ''praefectus annonae'', 48–55 and 62–71 AD, and scholars prefer the earlier period. A date of 49 AD has previously been suggested because Seneca writes in §13.8 "that [[Sulla]] was the last of the Romans who extended the ''[[pomerium]]''" (the boundary of [[Rome]]). Since [[Claudius]] extended this in 49/50 AD, it would have been written before this. However [[Miriam Griffin]] has argued that Seneca is quoting a pedant who is asserting that Claudius' extension was illegal, which would mean that Seneca was writing after this date. Griffin has suggested that Seneca wrote ''De Brevitate Vitae'' as an excuse for Paulinus to retire early in 55 AD.&lt;ref name="smithy"&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott Smith|first=R.|chapter=De Brevitate Vitae|title=Brill's Companion to Seneca: Philosopher and Dramatist|pages=161–6|editor1-first=Andreas|editor1-last=Heil|editor2-first=Gregor|editor2-last=Damschen|year=2013|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9004217088}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
In chapter 1 Seneca counters the complaint that life is too short with the view that life is long enough if well-managed. Chapters 2 to 9 survey the many ways in which life is squandered and time frittered away by those people (''occupati'') engrossed in pointless pursuits. Chapters 10 to 17 contrast the philosophical approach to leisure (''[[otium]]'') with the deluded common approach. This culminates in chapters 18 to 20 showing the emancipation of the wise, who can soar above the lives of others mired in endless preoccupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Williams|first=G. D.|title=Seneca: De Otio, De Brevitate Vitae|year=2003|page=19|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521588065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Topics===
After the introduction (§1), Seneca reviews (§2–3) the distractions which make life seem short, and explains that people are great wasters of time. He then offers (§4–6) three examples of famous Romans ([[Augustus]], [[Cicero]] and [[Marcus Livius Drusus (tribune)|Livius Drusus]]) who, in various ways, were victims of the engrossed life. He explains (§7–8) that the engrossed do not know how to live or have awareness, and that they waste time because they do not know its value. One should purposefully live for the moment (§9), because tomorrow will be too late. In contrast (§10) the lives of the engrossed seem so short to them because they are constrained to the fleeting present, and recollect the past in pain. They desperately cling on to life (§11) because they haven't lived, unlike the wise, who are always ready to leave life behind. The engrossed include those who live in leisure and luxury (§12), and Seneca explains (§13) that even those who devote themselves to scholarship are wasting their time if their efforts are directed to no end. Accordingly, (§14–15) only those who dedicate their time properly truly live, becoming equal with the great minds of the past, allowing the mind of the sage to even transcend time, like a god. The engrossed, on the other hand, (§16–17) are prey to fidgety and contradictory moods, and their joys and pleasures are bitter with the sense of precariousness. Finally (§18–19) Seneca exhorts Paulinus to abandon public occupations and adopt the contemplative life of the wise, free from the passions. This is contrasted (§20) with the suffering of the engrossed: they die without having ever lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=A.|last=Traina|title=La brevità della vita|language=it|publisher=BUR Biblioteca Univ. Rizzoli|year=1993|isbn=8817169404}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
In the treatise Seneca argues that we waste so much time because we do not properly value it. We expend great effort in protecting other valuables such as money and property, but because time appears intangible, we allow others to occupy it and take time away from us. Wise people, on the other hand, understand that time is the most valuable of all resources, and with effort can free themselves from external control to engage in meaningful introspection and create an intentional life.&lt;ref name="smithy"/&gt;

Seneca urges his readers to live in the present, and adapt themselves to a purposeful life in agreement with Nature. Only by doing so, can one then truly unlock both past and future. The completeness of each present moment allows one's awareness to expand to the equal of that of the universe, and achieve true virtue and happiness.&lt;ref name="smithy"/&gt;

The statements which urge Paulinus to retire from public life are in notable contrast to Seneca's advice in his ''[[De Tranquillitate Animi]]'' (to his friend [[Annaeus Serenus]]) to seek public employments in order to render life attractive.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SIoFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=The+stoic+sage+Seneca+de+tranquilitates+animi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VwoKVYG-GcvnUsS5gdAD&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20stoic%20sage%20Seneca%20de%20tranquilitates%20animi&amp;f=false Seneca as a Moralist and Philosopher]" in ''The National quarterly review'', p. 18, published 1868 (ed. by [[Edward Isidore Sears|E. I. Sears]]). Retrieved 2017-11-21.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in his related treatise, ''[[De Otio]]'', Seneca makes the point that there is no inconsistency, and that one can serve the greater community in either or both roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott Smith|first=R.|chapter=De Otio|title=Brill's Companion to Seneca: Philosopher and Dramatist|pages=150|editor1-first=Andreas|editor1-last=Heil|editor2-first=Gregor|editor2-last=Damschen|year=2013|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9004217088}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Habitat destruction and fragmentation ===
[[File:Lacanja burn.JPG|thumb|Lacanja burn shows deforestation]]

Human population growth results in changes in land-use, which can cause natural habitats to become fragmented, altered, or destroyed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Large mammals are often more vulnerable to extinction than smaller animals because they require larger [[home range]]s and thus are more prone to suffer the effects of [[deforestation]]. Large species such as [[elephant]]s, [[rhinoceros]]es, large [[primate]]s, [[tapir]]s and [[Peccary|peccaries]] are the first animals to disappear in fragmented [[rainforest]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Kinnaird, M. F., Sanderson, E. W., O'Brien, T. G., Wibisono, H. T. and Woolmer, G., "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Eric_Sanderson2/publication/227602224_Deforestation_Trends_in_a_Tropical_Landscape_and_Implications_for_Endangered_Large_Mammals/links/0912f5108705b72742000000.pdf Deforestation Trends in a Tropical Landscape and Implications for Endangered Large Mammals.]" ''Conservation Biology'' (2003) 17: 245–257.&lt;/ref&gt;

A case study from Amazonian Ecuador analyzed two oil-road management approaches and their effects on the surrounding wildlife communities. The free-access road had forests that were cleared and fragmented and the other had enforced access control. Fewer species were found along the first road with density estimates being almost 80% lower than at the second site that which had minimal disturbance.&lt;ref name="oil roads"&gt;Suárez, E., Morales, M., Cueva, R., Utreras Bucheli, V., Zapata-Ríos, G., Toral, E., Torres, J., Prado, W. and Vargas Olalla, J., "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Galo_Zapata-Rios/publication/229528550_Oil_Industry_Wild_Meat_Trade_and_Roads_Indirect_Effects_of_Oil_Extraction_Activities_in_a_Protected_Area_in_North-Eastern_Ecuador/links/02e7e528ccfdcbb399000000/Oil-Industry-Wild-Meat-Trade-and-Roads-Indirect-Effects-of-Oil-Extraction-Activities-in-a-Protected-Area-in-North-Eastern-Ecuador.pdf Oil Industry, Wild Meat Trade and Roads: Indirect Effects of Oil Extraction Activities in a Protected Area in North-Eastern Ecuador.]" ''Animal Conservation'' 12 (2009): 364–373.&lt;/ref&gt; This finding suggests that disturbances affected the local animals' willingness and ability to travel between patches.[[File:Amazonie deforestation.jpg|thumb|right|Fishbone deforestation pattern. This was found in Brazil and is visible from satellite]]

[[Habitat fragmentation|Fragmentation]] lowers populations while increasing extinction risk when the remaining [[habitat]] size is small.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; When there is more unfragmented land, there is more habitat for more diverse species. A larger land patch also means it can accommodate more species with larger [[home range]]s.  However, when patch size decreases, there is an increase in the number of isolated fragments which can remain unoccupied by local [[fauna]]. If this persists, species may become extinct in the area.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Rybicki, J., "[http://izt.ciens.ucv.ve/ecologia/Archivos/ECO_POB%202013/ECOPO2_2013/Ecological%20effects%20of%20environ.%20change/Rybicki%20y%20Hanski%202013.pdf Species–area Relationships and Extinctions Caused by Habitat Loss and Fragmentation.]" ''Ecology Letters'' 16 (2013): 27-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study on [[deforestation of the Amazon rainforest|deforestation in the Amazon]] looked at two patterns of [[habitat fragmentation]]: "fish-bone" in smaller properties and another unnamed large property pattern. The large property pattern contained fewer fragments than the smaller fish-bone pattern. The results suggested that higher levels of fragmentation within the fish-bone pattern led to the [[loss of species]] and decreased diversity of large vertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, D. A., Hobbs, R. J. and Margules, C. R., "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Denis_Saunders/publication/227638151_Saunders_D_Hobbs_R_Margules_C_Biological_Consequences_of_Ecosystem_Fragmentation_A_Review_Conservation_Biology/links/53d20be10cf2a7fbb2e9620f/Saunders-D-Hobbs-R-Margules-C-Biological-Consequences-of-Ecosystem-Fragmentation-A-Review-Conservation-Biology.pdf Biological Consequences of Ecosystem Fragmentation: A Review.]" ''Conservation Biology'' 5 (1991): 18–32.&lt;/ref&gt; Human impacts, such as the fragmentation of forests, may cause large areas to lose the ability to maintain [[biodiversity]] and [[ecosystem function]] due to loss of key ecological processes.&lt;ref&gt;Jorge, M. L. S. P., Galetti, M., Ribeiro, M. C., Ferraz, K.M.P.M.B.

=== Invasive species ===

Human influences, such as colonization and agriculture, have caused species to become distributed outside of their native ranges.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Fragmentation also has cascading effects on native species, beyond reducing habitat and resource availability; it leaves areas vulnerable to non-native invasions. [[Invasive species]] can out-compete or directly prey upon native species, as well as alter the habitat so that native species can no longer survive.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oil roads"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeschke, J., et. al. "[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cobi.12299/full Defining the Impact of Non-Native Species.]" ''Conservation Biology'' 28.5 (2014): 1188-1194.&lt;/ref&gt;

In extinct animal species for which the cause of extinction is known, over 50% were affected by invasive species. For 20% of extinct animal species, invasive species are the only cited cause of extinction. Invasive species are the second-most important cause of extinction for mammals.&lt;ref&gt;Clavero, M., Garcia-Berthou, E. "[http://dugi-doc.udg.edu:8080/bitstream/handle/10256/12285/InvasiveSpeciesLeading.pdf?sequence=1 Invasive Species are a Leading Cause of Animal Extinctions.]" ''Trends in Ecology and Evolution'' 20.3 (2005): 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global patterns ==

Tropical regions are the most heavily impacted by defaunation.&lt;ref name="def ant" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eco and evo" /&gt; These regions, which include the [[Brazilian Amazon]], the [[Congo Basin]] of Central Africa, and [[Indonesia]], experience the greatest rates of overexploitation and [[habitat degradation]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; However, specific causes are varied, and areas with one endangered group (such as birds) do not necessarily also have other endangered groups (such as mammals, insects, or amphibians).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Press release: Global map shows new patterns of extinction risk|url=http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_2-11-2006-10-49-47|work=Imperial College London and the Natural Environment Research Council|date=2 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon leads to habitat fragmentation and overexploitation. Hunting pressure in the Amazon rainforest has increased as traditional hunting techniques have been replaced by modern weapons such as shotguns.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Access roads built for mining and logging operations fragment the forest landscape and allow hunters to move into forested areas which previously were untouched.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The bushmeat trade in Central Africa incentivizes the overexploitation of local fauna.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Indonesia has the most endangered animal species of any area in the world.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Endangered Species in Indonesia - Australian Science|url = http://www.australianscience.com.au/environmental-science/endangered-species-in-indonesia/|website = Australian Science|accessdate = 2015-11-30|language = en-US|first = Ivanovic,|last = Josip}}&lt;/ref&gt; International trade in wild animals, as well as extensive logging, mining and agriculture operations, drive the decline and extinction of numerous species.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Ecological impacts ==

=== Genetic loss ===
[[Inbreeding]] and [[genetic diversity]] loss often occur with endangered species populations because they have small and/or declining populations. Loss of genetic diversity lowers the ability of a population to deal with change in their environment and can make individuals within the community [[homogeneous]]. If this occurs, these animals are more susceptible to [[disease]] and other occurrences that may target a specific [[genome]]. Without genetic diversity, one disease could eradicate an entire species. Inbreeding lowers reproduction and [[survival rate]]s. It is suggested that these genetic factors contribute to the extinction risk in threatened/endangered species.&lt;ref&gt;Frankham, R., "Genetics and Conservation Biology." C. R. ''Biologies'' 326 (2003): S22-S29.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Seed dispersal ===

==== Effects on plants and forest structure ====
The consequences of defaunation can be expected to affect the plant community. There are three non-mutually exclusive conclusions as to the consequences on tropical forest plant communities:

# If seed dispersal agents are targeted by hunters, the effectiveness and amount of dispersal for those plant species will be reduced&lt;ref name="eco and evo" /&gt;
# The species composition of the [[seedling]] and [[sapling]] layers will be altered by hunting,&lt;ref name="eco and evo" /&gt; and
# Selective hunting of medium/large-sized animals instead of small-sized animals will lead to different seed predation patterns, with an emphasis on smaller seeds&lt;ref name="eco and evo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Galetti 2–7"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Defaunation affects the populations and diets of rodents in Neotropical rainforests|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000632071500186X|journal = Biological Conservation|date = 2015-10-01|pages = 2–7|volume = 190|doi = 10.1016/j.biocon.2015.04.032|first = Mauro|last = Galetti|first2 = Roger|last2 = Guevara|first3 = Carolina L.|last3 = Neves|first4 = Raisa R.|last4 = Rodarte|first5 = Ricardo S.|last5 = Bovendorp|first6 = Marcelo|last6 = Moreira|first7 = John B.|last7 = Hopkins III|first8 = Justin D.|last8 = Yeakel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One recent study analyzed seedling density and composition from two areas, Los Tuxtlas and Montes Azules. Los Tuxtlas, which is affected more by human activity, showed higher seedling density and a smaller average number of different species than in the other area. Results suggest that an absence of vertebrate dispersers can change the structure and diversity of forests.&lt;ref&gt;Dirzo, R. and Miranda, A. "Altered Patterns of Herbivory and Diversity in the Forest Understory: A Case Study of the Possible Consequences of Contemporary Defaunation." In: ''Plant-Animal Interactions: Evolutionary ecology in tropical and temperate regions''. P. W. Price, T. M. Lewinsohn, G. W. Fernandes &amp; W. W. Benson (Eds.). Wiley and Sons Pub. New York pp: 273-287.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, a plant community that relies on animals for dispersal could potentially have an altered [[biodiversity]], species [[Dominance (ecology)|dominance]], survival, [[demography]], and spatial and genetic structure.&lt;ref&gt;Beaune, David. "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Beaune/publication/256303581_Seed_dispersal_strategies_and_the_threat_of_defaunation_in_a_Congo_forest/links/00b4952246469ee96c000000.pdf Seed Dispersal Strategies and the Threat of Defaunation in a Congo Forest]." ''Biodiversity and Conservation'' 22.1 (2013): 225-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Poaching is likely to alter plant composition because the interactions between game and plant species varies in strength. Some game species interact strongly, weakly, or not at all with species. A change in plant species composition is likely to be a result because the net effect removal of game species varies among the plant species they interact with.&lt;ref name="poachers alter"/&gt;

==== Effects on small-bodied seed dispersers and predators ====

As large-bodied vertebrates are increasingly lost from seed-dispersal networks, small-bodied seed dispersers (i.e. bats, birds, dung beetles) and seed predators (i.e. rodents) are affected. Defaunation leads to reduced species diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Seed predation in a human-modified tropical landscape|url = http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S026646741500019X|journal = Journal of Tropical Ecology|date = 2015-07-01|issn = 1469-7831|pages = 379–383|volume = 31|issue = 4|doi = 10.1017/S026646741500019X|first = Jenny|last = Zambrano|first2 = Rosamond|last2 = Coates|first3 = Henry F.|last3 = Howe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Selective defaunation affects dung beetle communities in continuous Atlantic rainforest|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320713000992|journal = Biological Conservation|date = 2013-07-01|pages = 79–89|volume = 163|series = Special Issue: Defaunation's impact in terrestrial tropical ecosystems|doi = 10.1016/j.biocon.2013.04.004|first = Laurence|last = Culot|first2 = Emilie|last2 = Bovy|first3 = Fernando|last3 = Zagury Vaz-de-Mello|first4 = Roger|last4 = Guevara|first5 = Mauro|last5 = Galetti}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to relaxed competition; small-bodied species normally compete with large-bodied vertebrates for food and other resources. As an area becomes defaunated, dominant small-bodied species take over, crowding out other similar species and leading to an overall reduced species diversity.&lt;ref name="Galetti 2–7"/&gt; The loss of species diversity is reflective of a larger [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]], which has consequences for the maintenance of [[ecosystem services]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The quality of the physical habitat may also suffer. Bird and bat species (many of who are small bodied seed dispersers) rely on [[Geophagy|mineral licks]] as a source of sodium, which is not available elsewhere in their diets. In defaunated areas in the Western Amazon, mineral licks are more thickly covered by vegetation and have lower water availability. Bats were significantly less likely to visit these degraded mineral licks.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Defaunation of tropical forests reduces habitat quality for seed-dispersing bats in Western Amazonia: an unexpected connection via mineral licks|journal = Animal Conservation|date = 2014-02-01|issn = 1469-1795|pages = 44–51|volume = 17|issue = 1|doi = 10.1111/acv.12055|first = S. J.|last = Ghanem|first2 = C. C.|last2 = Voigt}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degradation of such licks will thus negatively affect the health and reproduction of bat populations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Defaunation has negative consequences for seed dispersal networks as well. In the western Amazon, birds and bats have separate diets and thus form separate [[Guild (ecology)|guilds]] within the network.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Partitioning of seed dispersal services between birds and bats in a fragment of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest|url = http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S1984-46702014000300006&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en|journal = Zoologia (Curitiba)|issn = 1984-4670|pages = 245–255|volume = 31|issue = 3|doi = 10.1590/S1984-46702014000300006|first = Raissa|last = Sarmento|first2 = Cecília P.|last2 = Alves-Costa|first3 = Adriana|last3 = Ayub|first4 = Marco A. R.|last4 = Mello|year = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is hypothesized that large-bodied vertebrates, being generalists, connect separate guilds, creating a stable, [[Ecological resilience|resilient]] network. Defaunation results in a highly modular network in which specialized frugivores instead act as the connector hubs.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Ecosystem services===
{{main|ecosystem services}}
Changes in predation dynamics, seed predation, seed dispersal, carrion removal, dung removal, vegetation trampling, and other ecosystem processes as a result of defaunation can affect ecosystem supporting and regulatory services, such as [[nutrient cycling]] and [[decomposition]], crop pollination, [[pest control]], and [[water quality]].&lt;ref name="def ant" /&gt;

=== Conservation ===
Efforts against defaunation include wildlife overpasses&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pell|first=Stuart|last2=Jones|first2=Darryl|date=2015-04-01|title=Are wildlife overpasses of conservation value for birds?

Wildlife overpasses are specifically used for the purpose of protecting many animal species from the roads.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Many countries use them and they have been found to be very effective in protecting species and allowing forests to be connected.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; These overpasses look like bridges of forest that cross over many roads, like a walk bridge for humans, allowing animals to migrate from one side of the forest to the other safely since the road cut off the original connectivity.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; It was concluded in a study done by Pell and Jones, looking at bird use of these corridors in Australia, that many birds did, in fact, use these corridors to travel from one side of forest to the other and although they did not spend much time in the corridor specifically, they did commonly use them.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Riparian corridors are very similar to overpasses they are just on flat land and not on bridges, however, they also work as connective "bridges" between fragmented pieces of forest. One study done connected the corridors with bird habitat and use for seed dispersal.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The conclusions of this study showed that some species of birds are highly dependent on these corridors as connections between forest, as flying across the open land is not ideal for many species.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Overall both of these studies agree that some sort of connectivity needs to be established between fragments in order to keep the forest ecosystem in the best health possible and that they have in fact been very effective.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== Marine ==
Defaunation in the [[marine biology|ocean]] has occurred later and less intensely than on land. A relatively small number of marine species have been driven to extinction. However, many species have undergone local, ecological, and commercial extinction.&lt;ref name="mar def"&gt;McCauley, D. J., Pinsky, M. L., [[Stephen R. Palumbi|Palumbi, S. R.]], Estes, J. A., Joyce, F. H., and Warner, R. R., "[http://escholarship.org/uc/item/1gj9w82r.pdf Marine defaunation: Animal loss in the global ocean.]" ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' 347 (2015): 12555641.&lt;/ref&gt; Most large marine animal species still exist, such that the size distribution of global species assemblages has changed little since the Pleistocene, but individuals of each species are smaller on average, and [[overfishing]] has caused reductions in genetic diversity. Most extinctions and population declines to date have been driven by human overexploitation.&lt;ref&gt;Dulvy, N. K., Pinnegar, J. K., and Reynolds, J. D.

Oxford University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consequences===
Marine defaunation has a wide array of effects on ecosystem structure and function. The loss of animals can have both top-down (cascading) and bottom-up effects,&lt;ref&gt;Myers, R. A., Baum, J. K., Shepherd, T. D.,  Powers, S. P., and Peterson, C. H. "[http://people.umass.edu/bethanyb/GCE/Myers%20et%20al.,%202007%20sharks.pdf Cascading effects of the loss of apex predatory sharks from a coastal ocean]".

''Science'', 334(2011), 1703-1706.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as consequences for [[biogeochemical cycling]], [[ecosystem connectivity]], and [[ecosystem stability]].

Two of the most important ecosystem services threatened by marine defaunation are the provision of food and coastal storm protection.&lt;ref name="mar def" /&gt;

'''Directed mutagenesis''', also known as '''directed mutation''', was a [[hypothesis]] proposing that organisms can respond to environmental stresses by [[orthogenesis|orthogenetically]] directing [[Evolution#Mutation|mutations]] to certain [[genes]] or areas of the [[genome]].

==History==

===Early work===
{{further|Mutationism|Orthogenesis}}

The Russian ichthyologist [[Lev Berg]] proposed directed mass mutations as the main mechanism for evolution in his anti-Darwinian book ''Nomogenesis; or, Evolution Determined by Law'' (1922). Berg's theory was both [[mutationist]] (involving mutation in place of selection) and [[orthogenetic]] (involving direction).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Georgy S. |last=Levit |first2=Lennart |last2=Olsson |chapter=Evolution on Rails: Mechanisms and Levels of Orthogenesis |editor-last=Wissemann |editor-first=Volker |title=Annals of the History and Philosophy of Biology |volume=11 |year=2006 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=TJso832AGXEC&amp;pg=PA112 |publisher=Universitätsverlag Göttingen |isbn=978-3-938616-85-7 |pages=112–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early studies of "directed mutation" were performed by German geneticists. [[Richard Goldschmidt]] claimed to have produced evidence for directed mutation in 1929 in his experiments on ''[[Drosophila]]'' fruit flies exposed to elevated temperatures. Viktor Jollos (1887–1941) in the 1930s had also carried out experiments on ''Drosophila'' and written that his results had confirmed Goldschmidt's work which was evidence for directed mutation in contrast to [[natural selection]]. However, later American geneticists were unable to replicate these experiments and the concepts fell out of favour compared to the standard Darwinian mechanism of randomly occurring [[Evolution#Mutation|mutations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jonathan |last=Harwood |chapter=3.

Directed mutagenesis was re-proposed in 1988&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cairns, J.; Overbaugh, J.; Miller, S. |title=The origin of mutants |journal=Nature |volume=335 |issue=6186 |pages=142–5 |date=September 1988  |pmid=3045565 |doi=10.1038/335142a0 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v335/n6186/abs/335142a0.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[John Cairns (biochemist)|John Cairns]] who was studying ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' that lacked the ability to [[metabolize]] [[lactose]].  He grew these bacteria in [[Growth medium|media]] in which lactose was the only source of [[energy]].  In doing so, he found that the rate at which the bacteria [[evolved]] the ability to metabolize lactose was many [[orders of magnitude]] higher than would be expected if the [[mutations]] were truly [[random]].  This inspired him to propose that the mutations that had occurred had been ''directed'' at those genes involved in lactose utilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=N |last=Symonds |title=A fitter theory of evolution?: Biologists have always denied that organisms can adapt their genes to suit a new environment.

Later support for this hypothesis came from Susan Rosenberg, then at the [[University of Alberta]], who found that an enzyme involved in [[DNA repair|DNA recombinational repair]], [[recBCD]], was necessary for the directed mutagenesis observed by Cairns and colleagues in 1989. The directed mutagenesis hypothesis was challenged in 2002, by work showing that the phenomenon was due to general [[Somatic hypermutation|hypermutability]] due to selected gene amplification, followed by natural selection, and was thus a standard [[Darwinian]] process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Slechta |first=E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8486">'''Germ theory denialism''' is the belief that [[Microorganism|germs]] do not cause infectious disease, and that the [[germ theory of disease]] is wrong.{{R|"novella"}} It usually involves arguing that [[Louis Pasteur]]'s model of infectious disease was wrong, and that [[Antoine Béchamp]]'s was right. In fact, its origins are rooted in Béchamp's empirically disproved (in the context of disease) theory of [[pleomorphism (microbiology)|pleomorphism]]. {{R|"gorski"}} Another obsolete variation is known as [[terrain theory]] and postulates that diseased tissue attracts germs rather than being caused by it.{{R|"brock"}}

== About ==

Germ theory denialism (GTD) is as old as germ theory itself beginning with the rivalry of Pasteur and Béchamp. Pasteur's work in preventing beverage contamination led him to discover that it was due to [[microorganisms]] and led him down the path to be the first scientist to show the theory was valid and popularize it in Europe.{{R|"gorski"}} Although he was not the first to have the idea and scientists such as [[Girolamo Fracastoro]] (had the idea that [[fomites]] could harbor the seeds of contagion), [[Agostino Bassi]] (discovered the [[muscardine]] disease of silkworms was caused by a fungus that was named [[Beauveria bassiana]]), [[Friedrich Henle]] (developed the concepts of contagium vivum and contagium animatum), and others had earlier proposed ideas similar to germ theory.{{R|"contagion"}}{{R|"guthrie"}}

Béchamp strongly contested this view offering up a competing idea known as the pleomorphic theory of disease. This theory says that all life is based on forms that a certain class of organisms take during stages of their life-cycles and that germs are attracted to the environment of diseased tissue rather than being the cause of it.{{R|"bechamp"}} Proponents of this idea insist microbes that live in an organism go through the same stages of their development. According to [[Günther Enderlein]] they are as follows: [[Colloid]] — [[microbe]] (primitive phase), [[bacteria]] (middle phase), and [[fungus]] (end phase).{{R|"synth"}}

Earlier non-germ theories, in addition to the earlier idea of [[Miasma theory|miasma]], focused on [[spontaneous generation]] - the idea that living matter could arise from non-living - and the terrain theory variation of Béchamp's ideas. Pasteur disproved spontaneous generation with a series of experiments in the 1870s.{{R|"contagion"}} However, understanding the cause of a sickness does not always immediately lead to effective treatment of sickness and the great decline in mortality during the 19th century is mostly associated with improvement in hygiene and cleanliness. In fact, one of the first movements to deny the germ theory was the Sanitary Movement, and was nevertheless central in developing America's [[public health]] infrastructure. By providing clean water and sanitation there was less of an environment for [[pathogens]] to develop and [[mortality rates]] fell dramatically.{{R|"pizzi"}}

GTD has significant overlap with [[chiropractic]] practice. Many [[chiropractor]]s believe [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]] to be a function of spine alignment and the brain's ability to communicate efficiently with the body and that it has little to nothing to do with external [[pathogen]]s.{{R|"barrett"}}

A common thread among many alternative medicine proponents is [[Anti-vaccine movement|opposition to vaccines]] and many use GTD to justify their claims.{{R|"crislip"}} Germ theory deniers make many claims about the biological underpinnings of the theory and the historical record{{R|"fielder"}}{{R|"arizona"}} that are at odds with what is accepted by most modern scientists and historians.{{R|"novella"}}{{R|"gorski"}}{{R|"contagion"}}{{R|"hodkinson"}} Another popular claim from the anti-vaccine community is that all diseases are caused by [[Bacteremia|toxemia]] due to inadequate diet and health practices.{{R|"hall"}}

== Criticism ==

[[Harriet Hall]] published an article in ''[[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|Skeptic]]'' where she describes her experience arguing with germ theory deniers.{{R|"hall"}}

Members of the medical community that are also skeptics, such as [[David Gorski]] and [[Steven Novella]], point out that denying germ theory is counter to years of experiments and the prevailing opinion of most doctors and scientists.{{R|"novella"}}{{R|"gorski"}}{{R|"orac"}}

'''Giulio Paolini''' (born 5 November 1940) is an [[Italy|Italian]] artist associated with both [[Arte Povera]] and [[Conceptual Art]].&lt;ref name=Nota1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondazionepaolini.it/biografia.php |title= Biography |publisher= Artist's official website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Paolini was born in [[Genoa]]. After a childhood spent in [[Bergamo]], he moved with his family to [[Turin]] where he still lives today. He attended the Giambattista Bodoni State Industrial Technical School of Graphics and Photography, graduating in the Graphics department in 1959. He had been interested in [[visual arts|art]] from an early age, visiting museums and galleries and reading art periodicals. Towards the end of the 1950s he approached [[painting]], trying some pictures of an abstract nature, close to [[monochrome]]. The discovery of [[Graphic design|modern graphics]] during his studies and the fact that there were architecture magazines around the house – his elder brother Cesare (1937–1983) was an architect – contributed to orienting him towards a line of research aimed at zeroing the image.

He did his first work in 1960, ''Disegno geometrico'' (''Geometrical Drawing''), which consists of the squaring in ink of a canvas painted with white tempera. This preliminary gesture of any representation whatever would remain the point of “eternal recurrence” in the universe of Paolini’s thought: topical moment and original instant that revealed the artist to himself, representing the conceptual foundation of all his future work.

In the early 1960s, Paolini developed his research by focusing on the very components of the picture: on the painter’s tools and on the space of representation. For his first solo show – in 1964 at Gian Tommaso Liverani’s La Salita gallery in [[Rome]] – he presented some rough wooden panels leant against or hanging on the wall, suggesting an exhibition in the process of being set up. The show was seen by Carla Lonzi and Marisa Volpi who would shortly afterwards write the first critical texts on the young artist. In 1965 Paolini began to use photography, which allowed him to extend his inquiry to the relationship between artist and work (''Delfo'', 1965; ''1421965'', 1965). In the same year, through Carla Lonzi, he met [[Luciano Pistoi]], owner of the Galleria Notizie in Turin, who introduced him to a new circle of friends and collectors and became his main dealer until the beginning of the 1970s.

Between 1967 and 1972, the critic [[Germano Celant]] invited him to take part in [[Arte Povera]] exhibitions which resulted in his name being associated with that movement. In fact Paolini’s position was clearly distinct from the vitalistic climate and “existential phenomenology” that distinguished the propositions of Celant’s artists. He repeatedly declared an intimate belonging to the history of art, identifying programmatically with the lineage of all the artists who had preceded him. Some of his best known works can be traced back to this purpose, extraneous to the militant scene of the late 1960s: ''Giovane che guarda Lorenzo Lotto'' (''Young Man Looking at Lorenzo Lotto'', 1967), the “self-portraits” from Poussin and Rousseau (1968) and the pictures in which he reproduces details of old masters’ paintings (''L’ultimo quadro di Diego Velázquez'', 1968; ''Lo studio'', 1968). Among Paolini’s main references in those years were [[Jorge Luis Borges]], to whom he paid homage on several occasions, and [[Giorgio de Chirico]] from whom he borrowed the constituent phrase of the work ''Et.quid.amabo.nisi.quod.ænigma est'' (1969).

His first official acknowledgements came with the 1970s: from shows abroad, which placed him on the international avant-garde gallery circuit, to his first museum exhibitions. In 1970 he took part in the [[Venice Biennale]] with ''Elegia'' (''Elegy'', 1969), the first work in which he used the [[plaster cast]] of a [[classical antiquity|classic]] subject: the eye of Michelangelo’s ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'' with a fragment of mirror applied to the pupil. One of the outstanding themes in this decade was a backward glance at his own work: from literal citation of celebrated paintings he arrived at self-citation, proposing a historicizing in perspective of his oeuvre. Works such as ''La visione è simmetrica?'' (''Is Vision Symmetrical?'', 1972) or ''Teoria delle apparenze'' (''Theory of Appearances'', 1972) allude to the idea of the picture as potential container of all past and future works. Another theme investigated with particular interest in this period was that of the double and the copy, which found expression above all in the group of works entitled ''Mimesi'' (''Mimesis'', 1975–76) consisting of two plaster casts of the same classical statue set face to face, calling into question the concept of [[mimesis|reproduction]] and representation itself.

The period most dense in exhibitions and retrospectives, with the publication of important monographs, was the 1980s. In the first half of the decade an explicitly theatrical dimension began to establish itself with works marked by fragmentation and dispersion (''La caduta di Icaro'', 1982; ''Melanconia ermetica'', 1983) or distinguished by theatrical figures such as eighteenth century valets de chambre (''Trionfo della rappresentazione'', 1984). Paolini’s poetics was considerably enriched by literary attributions and [[Mythology|mythological]] references, as well as by the introduction of cosmic images. In the late 1980s the artist's reflections turned mainly on the very act of exhibiting. Starting with his solo show at the [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Nantes|Musée des Beaux-Arts]] in Nantes (1987) the concept of the exhibition – its premises and its promises – became progressively configured as the actual subject of the works themselves.

In the course of the 1990s, further inquiry into the idea of exhibiting spread into other, new modalities. The increasingly complex set-ups often followed a typology that was additive (seriality, juxtaposition) or centrifugal (dispersion or dissemination from a central nucleus) or centripetal (concentration and implosive superimposition). The place of the exhibition became the stage par excellence of the “theatre of the opus”, meaning of the work in its doing and undoing: the place that defined the very eventuality of its happening (''Esposizione universale'', 1992; ''Teatro dell’opera'', 1993; ''Essere o non essere'', 1995). Completion of the work was moreover constantly deferred, leaving the spectator in perennial expectation: just what the artist always feels from the start at his worktable, waiting for the work to manifest itself.

In the 2000s, another theme especially dear to Paolini took on special importance, as much in his artwork as in his writings: the identity of the author, his condition as spectator, his lack of contact with a work that always precedes and supersedes him.

Paolini’s poetics and artistic practice as a whole may be characterised as a self-reflective meditation on the dimension of art, on its timeless “classicality” and its perspective without vanishing point. By means of [[photography]], [[collage]], [[plaster cast]]s and [[drawing]] his intention is always to inquire, with great conceptual rigour, into the tautological and at the same time metaphysical nature of artistic practice.&lt;ref name=Nota1/&gt;

==Exhibitions==
[[File:Paolini - 'L'Altra Figura' (1984).jpg|thumb|''L'Altra Figura'' (1984) in the [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]]]]
Since his first solo show ([[Rome]], 1964) Paolini has exhibited in art galleries and museums worldwide. Collaboration with avant-garde Italian galleries of the 1960s and 1970s (La Salita, [[Rome]]; Galleria Notizie, [[Turin]]; Galleria dell'Ariete, [[Milan]]; Galleria del Leone, [[Venice]]; La Tartaruga, [[Rome]]; L'Attico, Rome; Studio Marconi, [[Milan]]; Modern Art Agency, [[Naples]]) was swiftly integrated with regular presence in important foreign galleries (from 1971 Paul Maenz, [[Cologne]]; from 1972 [[Ileana Sonnabend|Sonnabend]], [[New York City]]; from 1973 Annemarie Verna, [[Zurich]]; from 1976 [[Yvon Lambert Gallery|Yvon Lambert]], [[Paris]]; from 1977 [[Lisson Gallery]], [[London]]). Since the 1980s Paolini has mainly been represented by the galleries Christian Stein, [[Milan]]; Massimo Minini, [[Brescia]]; Alfonso Artiaco, [[Naples]]; [[Yvon Lambert Gallery|Yvon Lambert]], [[Paris]] and Marian Goodman, [[New York City]].

The great anthological exhibitions took off towards the late 1970s (Istituto di Storia dell'Arte dell'Università di Parma, [[Parma]], 1976; Städtisches Museum, [[Mönchengladbach]], 1977; Mannheimer Kunstverein, [[Mannheim]], 1977; Museo Diego Aragona Pignatelli Cortes, [[Naples]], 1978; [[Stedelijk Museum]], [[Amsterdam]], touring to The Museum of Modern Art, [[Oxford]], 1980) and culminated in the second half of the 1980s (Le Nouveau Musée, [[Villeurbanne]], 1984, touring to [[Montreal]], [[Vancouver]] and [[Charleroi]]; [[Neue Staatsgalerie|Staatsgalerie]], Stuttgart, 1986; [[Castle of Rivoli|Castello di Rivoli]], [[Rivoli (TO)|Rivoli]], 1986; [[Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna]], [[Rome]], 1988; Galleria Comunale d'Arte Moderna, Villa delle Rose, [[Bologna]], 1990). Outstanding recent solo shows were held in [[Graz]] (Neue Galerie im Landesmuseum Joanneum, 1998), [[Turin]] (Galleria Civica d'Arte Moderna e Contemporanea, 1999), [[Verona]] (Galleria d'Arte Moderna e Contemporanea Palazzo Forti, 2001), [[Milan]] (Fondazione Prada, 2003), [[Winterthur]] ([[Kunstmuseum Winterthur]], 2005) and [[Münster]] (Westfälisches Landesmuseum für Kunst und Kulturgeschichte, 2005). For the season 2002/2003 in the [[Vienna State Opera]] Giulio Paolini designed a large scale picture (176 sqm) as part of the exhibition series "Safety Curtain", conceived by [[museum in progress]].&lt;ref name="Safety Curtain by Giulio Paolini"&gt;[http://www.mip.at/creations/eiserner-vorhang-2002-2003 "Safety Curtain 2002/2003"], [[museum in progress]], Vienna.&lt;/ref&gt;

Group exhibitions, innumerable since his participation in the 1961 ''Premio Lissone'', include the shows connected with [[Arte Povera]] (1967–1971, 1984–85, 1997, 2001–02), the main international exhibitions of Italian art and many of the most significant shows dedicated to artistic development in the second half of the 20th century (for example: ''Vitalità del negativo'', [[Rome]] 1970; ''Contemporanea'', Rome 1973; ''Projekt '74'', [[Cologne]] 1974; ''Europe in the Seventies'', [[Chicago]] and touring through the [[United States]] 1977–78; ''Westkunst'', [[Cologne]] 1981; ''‘60–'80': Attitudes/concepts/images'', [[Amsterdam]] 1982; ''An International Survey of Recent Painting and Sculpture'', [[New York City]] 1984; ''The European Iceberg'', [[Toronto]] 1985; ''Transformations in Sculpture'', [[New York City]] 1985; ''Bilderstreit'', [[Cologne]] 1989; ''1965–1975: Reconsidering the Object of Art'', [[Los Angeles]] 1995; ''The Last Picture Show: Artists Using Photography, 1960–82'', [[Minneapolis]] and touring 2003–05). Paolini has appeared several times at [[documenta]] Kassel (1972, 1977, 1982, 1992) and the [[Venice Biennale]] (1970, 1976, 1978, 1980, 1984, 1986, 1993, 1995, 1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondazionepaolini.it/esposizioni_personali.php |title= Exhibitions |publisher= Artist’s official website}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the Whitechapel Gallery in London staged Giulio Paolini: To Be or Not To Be, an exhibition of Paolini's sculptures, exhibitions and installations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.whitechapelgallery.org/exhibitions/giulio-paolini-to-be-or-not-to-be/&lt;/ref&gt; "Giorgio De Chirico-Giulio Paolini Giuilo Paolini Giorgio De Chirico" Center for Italian Modern Art, Oct. 13, 2016-June 24, 2017, New York, NY, italianmodernart.org

In the course of his career Paolini has also worked in the [[scenic design|theatre]], from the sets and costumes for [[Vittorio Alfieri]]’s ''Bruto II'', directed by Gualtiero Rizzi (1969), to his collaboration with Carlo Quartucci and the Zattera di Babele in the 1980s. Outstanding recent projects include the sets for [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]’s [[Die Walküre]] (2005) and [[Parsifal]] (2007) at the [[Teatro di San Carlo]] in Naples, directed by Federico Tiezzi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondazionepaolini.it/scenografie.php |title= Set Design |publisher= Artist’s official website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bibliography==

Right from the start Paolini’s productions have been accompanied by written reflections and comments, seen as elements complementary to and parallel with the image. His first collection of texts, ''Idem'', was published by [[Giulio Einaudi|Einaudi]] in 1975 with an essay by [[Italo Calvino]]. Recent collections include ''Quattro passi. Nel museo senza muse'' (Einaudi, Turin 2006) and ''Dall'Atlante al Vuoto (in ordine alfabetico)'' published by Mondadori Electa, Milan 2010. In 1995 Maddalena Disch edited a complete edition of his writings and interviews (''Giulio Paolini: la voce del pittore. Scritti e interviste 1965–1995'', ADV Publishing House, [[Lugano]]).

The first monograph on the artist, by [[Germano Celant]], was published in 1972 in [[New York City]] by [[Ileana Sonnabend|Sonnabend Press]]. The most significant books on Giulio Paolini, including critical anthologies and a wealth of documentation, are the catalogues brought out on the occasion of his solo shows in [[Parma]] (1976), [[Ravenna]] (1985, ''Giulio Paolini. Tutto qui'', Edizioni Essegi, Ravenna), [[Stuttgart]] (1986), [[Rome]] (1988), [[Graz]] (1998) and [[Milan]] (2003). In 1990 Francesco Poli edited a monograph for Edizioni Lindau of Turin. In 1992 Marco Noire published ''Impressions graphiques. L’opera grafica 1967–1992 di Giulio Paolini'', a general catalogue of his prints and multiples. In 2008 the publisher Skira of Milan brought out a two volume Catalogue Raisonné of Paolini's works from 1960 to 1999, edited by Maddalena Disch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondazionepaolini.it/bibliografia.php |title= Bibliography |publisher= Artist’s official website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gravitational field Earth lines equipotentials.svg|right|thumb|Image depicting [[Earth]]'s [[gravitational field]]. Objects accelerate towards the Earth, thus losing their gravitational energy and transforming it into [[kinetic energy]].]]
'''Gravitational energy''' is the [[potential energy]] a [[body (physics)|body]] with [[mass]] has in relation to another massive object due to [[gravity]]. It is potential energy associated with the [[gravitational field]]. Gravitational energy is dependent on the [[mass]]es of two bodies, their distance apart and the [[gravitational constant]] ({{math|''G''}}).&lt;ref name=gpe&gt;{{cite web|title=Gravitational Potential Energy|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/gpot.html|website=hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In everyday cases only one body is accelerating measurably, and its acceleration is constant (for example, dropping a ball on Earth). For such scenarios the Newtonian formula can – for the potential energy of the accelerating body with respect to the stationary – be reduced to:

:&lt;math&gt;U = mgh&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is the gravitational potential energy, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the object accelerating, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the acceleration of the object, and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the bodies.&lt;ref name=gpe/&gt; Note that this formula treats the potential energy as a positive quantity.

== Newtonian mechanics ==

In [[classical mechanics]], two or more [[mass]]es always have a gravitational [[potential (physics)|potential]]. [[Conservation of energy]] requires that this gravitational field energy is always [[Negative energy|negative]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Guth]]'' The Inflationary Universe: The Quest for a New Theory of Cosmic Origins'' (1997), Random House, {{ISBN|0-224-04448-6}} Appendix A: ''Gravitational Energy'' demonstrates the negativity of gravitational energy.&lt;/ref&gt; The gravitational potential energy is the potential energy an object has because it is within a gravitational field.

The force one point mass &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; exerts onto another point mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is given by [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Newton's law of gravitation]]: &lt;math&gt;F = G\frac {mM}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

To get the total work done by an external force to bring point mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; from infinity to the final distance &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; (for example the radius of Earth) of the two mass points, the force is integrated with respect to displacement:

: &lt;math&gt;W=\int_\infty^R G\frac {mM}{r^2}dr = &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;-G\left . {mM\over r} \right \vert _{\infty}^{R}&lt;/math&gt;

Because &lt;math&gt;\lim_{r\rightarrow \infty}\frac{1}{r}=0&lt;/math&gt;, the total work done on the object can be written as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Physics for the IB Diploma Full Colour |edition=revised |first1=K. A. |last1=Tsokos |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-521-13821-5 |page=143 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uWVQrIZqz_MC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=uWVQrIZqz_MC&amp;pg=PA143 Extract of page 143]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Equation box 1

== General relativity ==

{{Main article|Mass in general relativity}}
[[File:Spacetime lattice analogy.svg|thumb|right|A depiction of curved [[geodesics]] ("world lines"). According to [[general relativity]], mass distorts [[spacetime]] and gravity is a natural consequence of Newton's First Law.]]
In [[general relativity]] gravitational energy is extremely complex, and there is no single agreed upon definition of the concept. It is sometimes modeled via the [[Landau–Lifshitz pseudotensor]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Lev Davidovich Landau]] &amp; [[Evgeny Mikhailovich Lifshitz]], ''The Classical Theory of Fields'', (1951), Pergamon Press, {{ISBN|7-5062-4256-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; that allows retention for the energy-momentum conservation laws of [[classical mechanics]]. Addition of the matter [[stress–energy–momentum tensor]] to the Landau–Lifshitz pseudotensor results in a combined matter plus gravitational energy pseudotensor that has a vanishing [[Four-vector|4]]-[[divergence]] in all frames - ensuring the conservation law. Some people object to this derivation on the grounds that [[pseudotensor]]s are inappropriate in general relativity, but the divergence of the combined matter plus gravitational energy pseudotensor is a [[tensor]].

'''Grey-collar''' refers to the balance of employed people not classified as [[white-collar worker|white-]] or [[Blue-collar worker|blue collar]]. It is used to refer to occupations that incorporate some of the elements of both blue- and white-collar, and generally are in between the two categories in terms of income-earning capability.

Examples of grey-collar industries:
* [[Police officers]], [[firefighters]], [[nurses]], and [[Emergency medical services]] personnel
* [[Tradesman|Skilled tradespeople]] and [[technician]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200412/21/eng20041221_168119.html|title = China strives to cultivate grey collar workers|work = [[People's Daily]]|date = 2004-12-21|accessdate = 2008-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Farmer]] or [[agribusiness]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.hrinasia.com/general/what-are-grey-collar-workers/|title = What Are Grey-Collar Workers?|work = [[HR in Asia]]|date = 2014-09-11|accessdate = 2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Audio typist|Typists]], [[Shorthand|stenographers]], and [[paralegal]]s
* [[Airline pilots]] and [[Flight attendants]]
* [[Teachers]] and [[School Administrators]]
* [[Clergy]]
* [[Salesperson]]
* [[Funeral Director]]

Grey-collar workers often have licenses, associate degrees or diplomas from a trade or technical school in a particular field. They are unlike blue-collar workers in that blue-collar workers can often be trained on the job within several weeks whereas grey-collar workers already have a specific skill set and require more specialized knowledge than their blue-collar counterparts.

The field which most recognizes the diversity between these two groups is that of human resources and the insurance industry. These different groups must be insured differently for liability as the potential for injury is different.

==Other definitions==
The [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] wrote that another definition for grey collar could be the underemployed white collar worker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work= [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] | title=It's not just blue or white collar anymore as consultants labels for new jobs to the pallette | url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180414235410/http://www.post-gazette.com/businessnews/2006/08/11/It-s-not-just-blue-or-white-collar-anymore-as-consultants-labels-for-new-jobs-to-the-pallette/stories/200608110192 | date=2006-08-11 | accessdate=2018-04-14 | last=Sostek | first=Anya | quote=The least defined term of all seems to be grey collar, which can refer to those working well into their 60s, because they can't afford to retire, or to an underemployed white collar worker, such as someone with a bachelor's degree in English literature working as a customer service representative.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charle Brecher of the Citizens Budget Commission and the Partnership for New York City defined it sub-blue-collar jobs: "maintenance and [[Janitor|custodial]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work=Workforce Management | date=2009-12-18 | title=Business Groups Attack New York City’s ‘Lavish’ Health Benefits | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718113621/http://www.workforce.com/section/news/article/business-groups-attack-new-york-citys-lavish-health-benefits.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''HINDRAF''' or '''Hindu Rights Action Force''' ({{lang-ms|Barisan Bertindak Hak-Hak Hindu}}, [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: இந்து உரிமைகள் போராட்டக் குழு, [[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 兴权 )  with its slogan of ''People's Power'' (மக்கள் சக்தி translated as ''Makkal Sakthi'') began as a coalition of 30 Hindu [[non-governmental organisation]]s committed to the [[Hinduism in Malaysia|preservation of Hindu community]] rights and heritage in a multiracial [[Malaysia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.financialexpress.com/latest_full_story.php?content_id=128069 Hindu group protests "temple cleansing" in Malaysia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704022731/http://www.financialexpress.com/latest_full_story.php?content_id=128069 |date=4 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/HA14Ae04.html|publisher=Asia Times |title=Southeast Asia news and business from Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam |accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
HINDRAF has made a major impact to the political landscape of Malaysia in staging the [[2007 HINDRAF rally]]. In late 2007, several prominent members of the HINDRAF  were arrested, some on charges of [[sedition]]; following an enormous rally organised by HINDRAF in November. The charges were dismissed by the courts. Five people have since been detained without trial under the [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act]]. The group has over the last two years developed a broader political program to preserve and to push for equal rights and opportunities for the minority Indians. It has been successful in continuing to focus attention on the racist aspects of the Malaysian Government policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/newsMaps/idUSKLR29657920071214 | work=Reuters | title=Malaysia's Anwar condemns use of security law | date=14 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Between April to May 2006, several legal Hindu temples were demolished by city hall authorities in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malaysiakini.com/opinionsfeatures/52600 Temple row - a dab of sensibility please], ''malaysiakini.com''&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 April 2006, the Malaimel Sri Selva Kaliamman Temple in Kuala Lumpur was reduced to rubble after the city hall sent in bulldozers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gatago.com/talk/politics/mideast/12428067.html Muslims Destroy Century-Old Hindu Temple] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104235008/http://www.gatago.com/talk/politics/mideast/12428067.html |date=4 November 2006 }}, ''gatago.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hindu Rights Action Force or HINDRAF, a coalition of several NGO's, have protested these demolitions by lodging complaints with the [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]] but with no response.&lt;ref name="Finexp"/&gt; Many Hindu advocacy groups have protested what they allege is a systematic plan of temple cleansing in Malaysia. The official reason given by the Malaysian government has been that the temples were built illegally. However, several of the temples are centuries old.&lt;ref name="Finexp"&gt;[http://www.financialexpress.com/latest_full_story.php?content_id=128069 "Hindu group protests 'temple cleansing' in Malaysia"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704022731/http://www.financialexpress.com/latest_full_story.php?content_id=128069 |date=4 July 2007 }}, ''Financial Express''&lt;/ref&gt;
According to a lawyer for HINDRAF, a [[Hindu temple]] is demolished in Malaysia once every three weeks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://in.reuters.com/article/topNews/idINIndia-30397720071108?pageNumber=1 Malaysia ethnic Indians in uphill fight on religion] Reuters India - 8 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrests in October 2007===
On 30 October, four HINDRAF Group fellows and human rights, namely [[M. Manoharan]], [[P. Uthayakumar]], [[Waytha Moorthy Ponnusamy|P. Waytha Moorthy]] and V. Ganabathirau, were arrested and detained for taking part in the [[2007 HINDRAF demonstration]] against the demolishing of a Hindu shrine in [[Kuala Lumpur]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.policewatchmalaysia.com/index.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1194230687&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=5&amp; "4 HINDRAF Founding Lawyers Arrested"]&lt;/ref&gt; However, they were acquitted due to a lack of evidence of incitement and sedition.

===Human rights forum===
A series of peaceful weekend forums were organised throughout Malaysia to increase the awareness of [[Persecution of Hindus|Hindu human rights]] by HINDRAF. A previous forum held near central [[Kuala Lumpur]] had been disrupted by the [[Royal Malaysian Police]], according to HINDRAF.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bangkit.net/2007/10/09/police-attempts-to-sabotage-hindraf-forum-in-semenyih-on-6102007/ POLICE ATTEMPTS TO SABOTAGE HINDRAF FORUM IN SEMENYIH ON 6.10.2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212131659/http://www.bangkit.net/2007/10/09/police-attempts-to-sabotage-hindraf-forum-in-semenyih-on-6102007/ |date=12 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Subsequently, HINDRAF appealed directly to the Inspector General of [[Law enforcement in Malaysia|the Malaysian Police]] in an attempt to ensure future forums went on peacefully.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.policewatchmalaysia.com/index.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1195208061&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=9&amp; Hindraf seek IGP protection for nationwide forums / assemblies]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrests in November===
On 23 November 2007, three HINDRAF, P. Uthayakumar, Waytha Moorthy, and V. Ganabathirau, were arrested and charged under the [[Sedition Act (Malaysia)|Sedition Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Police arrest Hindraf leaders (update 2) | date = 23 November 2007 | work= Malaysia Star | url =  http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/11/23/nation/20071123123403&amp;sec=nation }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Lawyers charged with sedition | work= Malaysia Star| date = 24 November 2007 |  url = http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/11/24/nation/19567875&amp;sec=nation}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a series of repeated arrests and releases, the courts could not prove that they had incited racial hatred. The only evidence against them were unreliable translations of their Tamil speeches into Bahasa Malaysia presented by the Attorney-General's Chambers, which the courts deemed as unverifiable. Eventually, they were all acquitted due to a shaky prosecution and the lack of evidence of any wrongdoing or crime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/75273] Subscription required&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 August 2007, the 50th anniversary of Malaysia's independence, [[Waytha Moorthy Ponnusamy|P. Waytha Moorthy]], a HINDRAF lawyer filed a [[class action]] suit against the Government of the United Kingdom at the [[Royal Courts of Justice]] in London for US$4 trillion (US$1 million for every [[Malaysian Indian]]) for "withdrawing after granting independence and leaving us (Indians) unprotected and at the mercy of a majority Malay-Muslim government that has violated our rights as minority Indians"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.policewatchmalaysia.com/index.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1188457297&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=9&amp;] Particulars of Claim.&lt;/ref&gt; as guaranteed in the [[Constitution of Malaysia|Federal Constitution]] when independence was granted.&lt;ref name="T"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1687973,00.html|title=Facing Malaysia's Racial Issues|date=26 November 2007|work=TIME.com|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lawsuit is not only claiming 4 trillion [[pound sterling|British Pounds]] as compensation, it is also seeking to strike out [[Article 153 of the Malaysian Constitution]] which acknowledges [[Ketuanan Melayu|Malay Supremacy]] and for the court to declare that Malaysia is a [[secular state]] and not an [[Islamic state]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=39221 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211003316/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=39221 |archivedate=11 December 2007 |df=dmy-all }} [[Inter Press Service]] news report.&lt;/ref&gt; as declared by former Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohamad|Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad]] who is quarterly of Indian-Muslim descent.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bf-1.com/asian-news/malaysia-singapore-news/mahathir-biografy Mahathir – Biografy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://malaysia.jbdirectory.com/Doctor_in_the_House_-_I_Am_A_Malay Doctor in the House - I Am A Malay&lt;/ref&gt;

As the group, which represents mainly working class [[Malaysian Indian]]s, could not afford the legal fees required, a petition was circulated with 100,000 signatures to be presented to [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] to appoint a [[Queen's Counsel]] to argue the case.&lt;ref name="T"/&gt; The purpose of the rally was to hand over a 100,000 signature memorandum to the [[British Embassy]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]].

HINDRAF organised the rally on Sunday, 25 November 2007 to submit the petition at the British [[High Commission]]. Malaysian police refused to grant a permit for the rally,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www5.malaysiakini.com/news/75027 Malaysiakini (needs subscription)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205220911/http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/75027 |date=5 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and set up roadblocks in [[Klang Valley]] along roads leading up to the rally to screen motorists entering the city centre and identify "troublemakers".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.detikdaily.net/m3/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1204 Detikdaily - Hindraf rally: Arrests, roadblocks will make it worse&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071125005115/http://www.detikdaily.net/m3/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1204 |date=25 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also advised the public not to participate in the rally,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRxMhk9cD40|title=Hindraf rally: Cops warn of 'stern action'|date=23 November 2007|accessdate=15 April 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; and arrested three leaders of HINDRAF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEIE3N_DvXA|title=Another Hindraf lawyer arrested|date=23 November 2007 |accessdate=15 April 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many shops around Kuala Lumpur including [[Suria KLCC]] were closed on that day in fear of trouble from the rally.

One day before the rally, police arrested three HINDRAF lawyers, [[P. Uthayakumar]], [[P. Waytha Moorthy]] and V. Ganabathirau for sedition charges. Uthayakumar and Ganabathirau posted bail of 800 [[Malaysian ringgit]]s each, but Waytha Moorthy refused bail as a sign of protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=54188 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603232003/http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=54188 |archivedate=3 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }} Daily Express, East Malaysia Independent Newspaper&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=6&amp;art_id=57494&amp;sid=16446487&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20071124&amp;fc=10 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916172221/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=6&amp;art_id=57494&amp;sid=16446487&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20071124&amp;fc=10 |archivedate=16 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }} ''The Standard'' Hong Kong&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianmalaysian.com/sound/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=777] iMOL, Indian Malaysian Online&lt;/ref&gt;

The police roadblocks started the week before the rally to create massive traffic jams across the city and the outskirts of [[Kuala Lumpur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Friday/National/2091564/Article/index_html|publisher=New Straits Times |title=Malaysia General Business Sports and Lifestyle News |accessdate=15 April 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205073438/http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Friday/National/2091564/Article/index_html|archivedate=5 February 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Malaysian Opposition leader [[Lim Kit Siang]] of the DAP pointed out that this high-handed act by the police was unnecessary as it caused major inconvenience to everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.limkitsiang.com/2007/11/23/hindraf-rally-police-stop-stop-over-reacting-dismantle-roadblocks-and-issue-permit/|title=Hindraf rally – police stop over-reacting, dismantle roadblocks and issue permit « Lim Kit Siang|work=Lim Kit Siang|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:HINDRAF.jpg|thumb|right|Riot police use [[teargas]] and [[water cannon]] to break up the march on 25 November 2007.]]
On the morning of the rally, an estimated twenty thousand people gathered near the [[Petronas Twin Towers]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]], carrying life-size portraits of Queen Elizabeth and [[Mahatma Gandhi]], to indicate the nonviolent nature of their protest.&lt;ref name="T"/&gt; Five thousand members riot police dispatched to the scene used tear gas and water cannon to disperse the crowds. 136 people were arrested.&lt;ref name="T"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/11/26/nation/19575394&amp;sec=nation Cops forced to use tear gas, water cannons] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003072937/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2007%2F11%2F26%2Fnation%2F19575394&amp;sec=nation |date=3 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Al-Jazeera]]'s coverage of the event&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbMwU03rywY|title=YouTube |accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed police officers using tear gas to disperse the protesters. A few hundred protesters and three police officers were injured.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/11/26/nation/19575975&amp;sec=nation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010115656/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2007%2F11%2F26%2Fnation%2F19575975&amp;sec=nation |date=10 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The protest at the [[Batu Caves]] resulted in minor property damages,&lt;ref&gt;[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/11/26/nation/19576008&amp;sec=nation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010115706/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2007%2F11%2F26%2Fnation%2F19576008&amp;sec=nation |date=10 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although the Hindu temple itself was not damaged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/11/27/nation/19582291&amp;sec=nation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010115716/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2007%2F11%2F27%2Fnation%2F19582291&amp;sec=nation |date=10 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

HINDRAF later claimed to have faxed the petition to the British High Commission staff. However, as of 28 November, the British Envoy had not yet received any petition from the HINDRAF, though they did say they had received some unspecified information by fax.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/11/28/nation/19597270&amp;sec=nation British envoy: No petition received] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212134322/http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2007%2F11%2F28%2Fnation%2F19597270&amp;sec=nation |date=12 February 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response from the government===
Malaysian prime minister, [[Najib Tun Razak]] warned that the government will invoke the [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act]] against the demonstrators if they needed. The prime minister further criticised the demonstrators, after he made a promise that he will listen to everyone even if they have unpleasant words to say, the government of Abdullah also attempted to link terrorism with the Hindraf rally via the media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straitstimes.com/Latest%2BNews/Asia/STIStory_181660.html US defends peaceful protests in Malaysia] ''The Straits Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 11 December 2007, the HINDRAF leaders were all acquitted by the judicial courts due to lack of evidence and a flimsy prosecution case against their allegations. To contain the movement while not being able to charge them according to valid evidence-based legal processes, on 12 December 2007 Prime Minister [[Abdullah Badawi]] personally signed the detention letters to imprison the HINDRAF leaders under the [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|ISA]] for two years, in which their detention terms are subject to infinite renewal. The reason given for this arrest was that the HINDRAF leadership has had links with international terrorist organisations such as LTTE and also supposedly militant organisations in the mould of RSS in India. The invocation of the ISA to capture the HINDRAF leaders was seen as a strategic move by the UMNO government to arrest the momentum generated by HINDRAF.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}
The UMNO lead Government has threatened the Malaysian Indian community{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} with sweeping arrests under the Emergency Act and ISA (similar to Operasi Lalang of the 1987, which targeted anti-BN elements in Malaysia, mostly of Malaysian Chinese extraction){{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}. This hardline approach is also softened by the MIC reconciliatory approach to blunt HINDRAF's thrust as the champion of the Malaysian Indian community.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Response to the detentions==
Even as Prime Minister [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]] started threatening to use the ISA against the HINDRAF leaders for bringing Malaysia's racist policies out into the open for all to see, foreign news outlets criticised Badawi's lack of initiative to tackle the root cause of the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=904&amp;Itemid=31|title=Independent news and analysis about Asia's politics, economics, culture and more|work=Asia Sentinel|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/12/09/stories/2007120955290100.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Malaysia considering ISA against Hindraf | date=9 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The detention without trial of the HINDRAF leaders drew negative comments in the foreign press about Badawi's administration and the poor way that the [[Government of Malaysia]] were handling the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Ethnic_Indians_held_under_security_law_Malaysia/articleshow/2619910.cms |title=Ethnic Indians held under security law: Malaysia|work=The Times of India |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071216202637/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Ethnic_Indians_held_under_security_law_Malaysia/articleshow/2619910.cms |archivedate=16 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific/view/317384/1/.html|title=Channel NewsAsia|work=Channel NewsAsia|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Democratic Action Party]] vowed to challenge the detention of the HINDRAF leaders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newkerala.com/one.php?action=fullnews&amp;id=3201] [http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/12/14/nation/19762029&amp;sec=nation]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the arrests, the opposition and most of the NGOs were unfazed and continued to challenge [[UMNO]]'s deconstruction of democracy in Malaysia. The United States had also voiced their disapproval of this latest round of ISA arrests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=40473|publisher=Inter Press Service |title=News and Views from the Global South |accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official HINDRAF website at http://www.policewatchmalaysia.com has been allowed by Malaysian ISPs again, after a brief ban.  However this site is constantly plagued by faults and downtime.  In response to the ban, sites such as http://www.hindraf.org, http://www.myhindraf.com were spawned to maintain awareness of this movement, in addition to the many blogs available.  The movement started in Malaysia, has grown global and now has following in UK, Australia, Canada and USA.

There has also been candlelight vigils at Hindu temples throughout Malaysia to protest the detention of five leaders of the HINDRAF.  This was condemned by Malaysian minister [[Samy Vellu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://in.news.yahoo.com/indiaabroad/20080128/r_t_ians_wl_asia/twl-malaysian-minister-slams-pro-hindraf-d5d6288_1.html "Malaysian minister slams pro-Hindraf campaign"], Yahoo! India News, January 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==War of the Roses==
The Rose to the PM campaign was mooted to present a humanistic element in HINDRAF's campaign.  The central focus of this campaign was the delivery of a rose, as a symbol of love and compassion, to the Malaysian Prime Minister at the Malaysian Parliament by Vwaishnavi Wathya Moorthy (aged 5).  This symbolic act was to occur on 16 February 2008, but the Malaysian Lower House was dissolved for the Federal Elections on 13 February 2008.

In a dramatic show of force, the police fired teargas and targeted water cannon at several hundred ethnic Tamils at the centre of Kuala Lumpur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/02/17/stories/2008021750180100.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Hindraf's 'roses campaign' thwarted | date=17 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More than 200 people were detained by the authorities after being attacked by the police near the site of an Indian temple.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080216/wl_asia_afp/malaysiaprotestsrights_080216164742&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.mysinchew.com/node/7133?tid=4 |title=Malaysia: Police Break Up Ethnic Indian Rally, Detain More Than 120 People |date=17 February 2008 |author=ULIA ZAPPEI|work=AP Associated Press|publisher=MySinchew |accessdate=8 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The impact of HINDRAF on the 12th Malaysian general elections==
The 12th general Election showed how HINDRAF had become one of the triggers for a major change in the course of the country.  The general dissatisfaction with the regime ruled by UMNO which had been brewing for some years was the kerosene and Hindraf Rally of 25 November was the tinder that sparked off the kerosene into a major explosion in what has come to be called a Political Tsunami in Malaysian politics.

The ruling UMNO led government lost its two-thirds majority in Parliament and came close to  getting just over half the seats in Parliament from the Peninsula.  HINDRAF which had barely existed for 3 years up to that time, and which was barely known up till August 2007 suddenly had caught the mood of a large proportion of Malaysians, not only Tamils and Hindus but the Chinese and a sizeable section of the Malays as well, causing a major upset in the process.

==Hindraf declared as illegal organisation==
After several warnings by the Malaysian government HINDRAF was officially banned on 15 October 2008, confirmed by [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Malaysia)|Malaysian Home Minister]] Datuk Seri Syed Hamid Albar.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/10/15/nation/20081015184431&amp;sec=nation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malaysianbar.org.my/legal/general_news/hindraf_declared_an_illegal_organisation.html|title=The Malaysian Bar|publisher=|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v3/news_lite.php?id=364772|title=Malaysian National News Agency ~ BERNAMA|publisher=|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a statement issued at the ministry, Syed Hamid said the decision to declare HINDRAF as an illegal organisation was made following the ministry being satisfied with facts and evidence that showed HINDRAF had and was being used for unlawful purposes and posed a threat to public order and morality.

"Based on powers vested under Section 5(1) of the Societies Act, HINDRAF from today is declared an illegal organisation," he said.

He said the order was being made as a result of monitoring and investigation on the organisation's activities by the Registrar of Societies (ROs) and Home Ministry, since Hindraf's inception.

==More detentions by the Malaysian government==
On 23 October 2008, a group comprising eight men, three women and a child, were arrested by the police after they tried to hand a memorandum to the Prime Minister's office. The memorandum called for the release of the five Hindraf leaders from detention under the Internal Security Act.
&lt;ref&gt;http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/10/23/nation/20081023194129&amp;sec=nation Hindraf members arrested in front of PM's office&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Friday/National/2384293/Article/index_html Hindraf 11 held over illegal assembly&lt;/ref&gt;  It was discovered that Hindraf leader P.Waythamoorthy's six-year-old daughter was amongst the people arrested.&lt;ref&gt;http://mt.m2day.org/2008/content/view/14190/84/ Waythamoorthy's wife, daughter and 10 other Hindraf supporters detained&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interlok==
On 27 February 2011, HINDRAF organised a demonstration in [[Kuala Lumpur]] protesting against the government's decision to include the Malay language novel ''[[Interlok]]'' in the school curriculum as compulsory reading for the Malay literature subject for students in secondary 5. HINDRAF alleges that ''Interlok'' contained disparaging remarks against Malaysian Indians and is deemed racist. The police arrested 109 people for allegedly taking part in an illegal demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article1495169.ece|title=109 people linked to Hindu rights group held in Malaysia|date=27 February 2011|work=The Hindu|accessdate=27 February 2011|location=Chennai, India|first=P. S.|last=Suryanarayana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status==
The ban imposed on this minority right group was later lifted by the Malaysian Home Ministry on 26 January 2013 and on 8 March 2013 the Malaysian Registrar of Societies had approved the registration of Hindraf.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thesundaily.my/news/685223&lt;/ref&gt; Recently on 18 April 2013, fractions of Hindraf which were led by P. Waythamoorthy  signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with [[Barisan Nasional|BN]] in which they would work together to uplift displaced estate workers, resolve the issue of stateless persons and provide business opportunities thus bringing poor Indians into the mainstream of the country's development while others spreading out to parties within the federal opposition [[Pakatan Rakyat]] (PR), mostly to [[Democratic Action Party|DAP]] or [[People's Justice Party, Malaysia|PKR]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2013/01/26/govt-lifts-ban-on-hindraf/|title=Govt lifts ban on Hindraf|work=Free Malaysia Today|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hornbillunleashed.wordpress.com/2013/04/15/44780/|title=WHAT A SNAKE!

'''''Habeas corpus''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|eɪ|b|i|ə|s|_|ˈ|k|ɔr|p|ə|s}}; [[Medieval Latin]] meaning literally "that you have the body")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=habeas corpus|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/habeas%20corpus|website=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Legal recourse|recourse in law]] through which a person can report an [[Arbitrary arrest and detention|unlawful detention or imprisonment]] to a [[court]] and request that the court order the custodian of the person, usually a prison official, to bring the prisoner to court, to determine whether the detention is lawful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What is Habeas Corpus|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/criminal/habeas_corpus.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=1 May 2017|language=English|date=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The writ of ''habeas corpus'' is known as "the great and efficacious writ in all manner of illegal confinement".&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;per Blackstone&lt;/ref&gt; It is a summons with the force of a [[court order]]; it is addressed to the custodian (a prison official, for example) and demands that a prisoner be taken before the court, and that the custodian present proof of authority, allowing the court to determine whether the custodian has lawful authority to detain the prisoner. If the custodian is acting beyond his or her authority, then the prisoner must be released. Any prisoner, or another person acting on his or her behalf, may petition the court, or a judge, for a writ of ''habeas corpus''. One reason for the writ to be sought by a person other than the prisoner is that the detainee might be held [[Solitary confinement|incommunicado]]. Most [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions provide a similar remedy for those unlawfully detained, but this is not always called ''habeas corpus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution|first=Albert|last=Venn Dicey|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kz40AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR3&amp;dq=INTRODUCTION+TO+THE+STUDY+OF+THE+LAW+OF+THE+CONSTITUTION+A.+V.+Dicey|year=1908}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in some Spanish-speaking nations, the equivalent remedy for unlawful imprisonment is the ''[[amparo de libertad]]'' ("protection of freedom").

''Habeas corpus'' has certain limitations. Though a writ of right, it is not a writ of course.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The applicant must make out a ''prima facie'' case. However, once that is done, the applicant is entitled to the writ as of right, which is then granted ''ex debito justitae'' ("from a debt of justice", that is, as a matter of right)&lt;/ref&gt; It is technically only a procedural [[legal remedy|remedy]]; it is a guarantee against any detention that is forbidden by law, but it does not necessarily protect other rights, such as the entitlement to a fair trial. So if an imposition such as internment without trial is permitted by the law, then ''habeas corpus'' may not be a useful remedy. In some countries, the writ has been temporarily or permanently suspended under the pretext of war or [[state of emergency]].{{elucidate|date=February 2016}}

The right to petition for a writ of ''habeas corpus'' has nonetheless long been celebrated as the most efficient safeguard of the liberty of the subject. The jurist [[Albert Venn Dicey]] wrote that the British [[Habeas Corpus Act 1679|Habeas Corpus Acts]] "declare no principle and define no rights, but they are for practical purposes worth a hundred constitutional articles guaranteeing individual liberty".&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Wright (1994) [https://books.google.com/books?id=I7oOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=declare+no+principle+and+define+no+rights,+but+they+are+for+practical+purposes+worth+a+hundred+constitutional+articles+guaranteeing+individual+liberty&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10#v=onepage&amp;q=declare%20no%20principle%20and%20define%20no%20rights%2C%20but%20they%20are%20for%20practical%20purposes%20worth%20a%20hundred%20constitutional%20articles%20guaranteeing%20individual%20liberty ''Citizens and subjects: an essay on British politics''], Routledge, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

The writ of ''habeas corpus'' is one of what are called the "extraordinary", "[[common law]]", or "[[prerogative writ]]s", which were historically issued by the [[English courts]] in the name of the monarch to control inferior courts and public authorities within the kingdom. The most common of the other such prerogative writs are ''[[quo warranto]]'', ''[[prohibito]]'', ''[[mandamus]]'', ''[[procedendo]]'', and ''[[certiorari]]''. The due process for such petitions is not simply civil or criminal, because they incorporate the presumption of non-authority. The official who is the respondent must prove his authority to do or not do something. Failing this, the court must decide for the petitioner, who may be any person, not just an interested party. This differs from a motion in a civil process in which the movant must have standing, and bears the burden of proof.

==Etymology==
From Latin ''habeas'', 2nd person singular present [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] active of ''habere'', "to have", "to hold"; and ''corpus'', accusative singular of ''corpus'', "body". In reference to more than one person, ''habeas corpora''.

Literally, the phrase means "[we command] that you should have the [detainee's] body [brought to court]". The complete phrase ''habeas corpus ad subjiciendum'' means "that you have the person for the purpose of subjecting him/her to (examination)". These are the opening words of writs in 14th century Anglo-French documents requiring a person to be brought before a court or judge, especially to determine if that person is being legally detained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=habeas corpus |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=habeas%20corpus |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Similarly named writs===
The full name of the writ is often used to distinguish it from similar ancient writs, also named ''habeas corpus''. These include:
* ''Habeas corpus ad deliberandum et recipiendum'': a writ for bringing an accused from a different county into a court in the place where a crime had been committed for purposes of trial, or more literally to return holding the body for purposes of "deliberation and receipt" of a decision. ("[[Extradition]]")
* ''Habeas corpus ad faciendum et recipiendum'' (also called ''habeas corpus cum causa''): a writ of a superior court to a custodian to return with the body being held by the order of a lower court "with reasons", for the purpose of "receiving" the decision of the superior court and of "doing" what it ordered.
* ''Habeas corpus ad prosequendum'': a writ ordering return with a prisoner for the purpose of "prosecuting" him before the court.
* ''Habeas corpus ad respondendum'': a writ ordering return to allow the prisoner to "answer" to new proceedings before the court.
* ''Habeas corpus ad testificandum'': a writ ordering return with the body of a prisoner for the purposes of "testifying".

==Origins in England==
{{further|English law}}
''Habeas corpus'' originally stems from the [[Assize of Clarendon]], a re-issuance of rights during the reign of [[Henry II of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/medieval/assizecl.asp |title=Assize of Clarendon, 1166. |date=1 December 1998 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century, the foundations for ''habeas corpus'' were "wrongly thought" to have originated in [[Magna Carta]].&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Ralph V. ''Magna Carta'' Pearson (2003) p162 and p219&lt;/ref&gt; This charter declared that:{{quote|No [[Estates of the realm|Freeman]] shall be taken or imprisoned, or be disseized of his [[Freehold (law)|Freehold]], or Liberties, or free Customs, or be outlawed, or exiled, or any other wise destroyed; nor will We not pass upon him, nor condemn him, but by lawful judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the land.}}

[[William Blackstone]] cites the first recorded usage of ''habeas corpus ad subjiciendum'' in 1305, during the reign of [[Edward I of England|King Edward&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, other [[writ]]s were issued with the same effect as early as the reign of [[Henry II of England|Henry&amp;nbsp;II]] in the 12th century. Blackstone explained the basis of the writ, saying "[t]he king is at all times entitled to have an account, why the liberty of any of his subjects is restrained, wherever that restraint may be inflicted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Blackstone |first1=William |title=Commentaries on the Laws of England: A Facsimile of the First Edition of 1765-1769, vol. 3, pp. 129-37 |date=1768 |publisher=University of Chicago Press (1979), reproduced in ''The Founders' Constitution,'' Volume 3, Article 1, Section 9, Clause 2, Document 4 |location=Chicago |url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_9_2s4.html |accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The procedure for issuing a writ of ''habeas corpus'' was first codified by the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1679]], following judicial rulings which had restricted the effectiveness of the writ. A previous law (the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1640]]) had been passed forty years earlier to overturn a ruling that the command of the King was a sufficient answer to a petition of ''habeas corpus''.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Maxwell. [http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/canbarev18&amp;div=24 Habeas Corpus Cum Causa-The Emergence of the Modern Writ-II.] Can. B. Rev. 18 (1940): 172, 174-175.&lt;/ref&gt; The cornerstone purpose of the &lt;nowiki&gt;''writ of habeas corpus'' was to limit the King's Chancery's ability to undermine the surety of law by allowing courts of justice decisions to be overturned in favor and application of ''equity'', a process managed by the Chancelor (a bishop) with the King'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/images/public_education/05_mar08_habeascorpus_landman.pdf|title=Understanding Habeas Corpus|last=Landman|first=James|date=|website=American Bar Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1679 codification of ''habeas corpus'' took place in the context of a [[Exclusion crisis|sharp confrontation]] between King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and the [[British Parliament|Parliament]], which was dominated by the then sharply oppositional, nascent [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig Party]]. The Whig leaders had good reasons to fear the King moving against them through the courts (as indeed happened in 1681) and regarded ''habeas corpus'' as safeguarding their own persons. The short-lived Parliament which made this enactment came to be known as the ''[[Habeas Corpus Parliament]]'' - being dissolved by the King immediately afterwards.

Then, as now, the writ of ''habeas corpus'' was issued by a superior court in the name of the Sovereign, and commanded the addressee (a lower court, sheriff, or private subject) to produce the prisoner before the royal courts of law. A ''habeas corpus'' petition could be made by the prisoner him or herself or by a third party on his or her behalf and, as a result of the Habeas Corpus Acts, could be made regardless of whether the court was in session, by presenting the petition to a judge. Since the 18th century the writ has also been used in cases of unlawful detention by private individuals, most famously in ''[[Somersett's Case]]'' (1772), where the black slave Somersett was ordered to be freed.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Charles Moncreiff (2006). "The Wit and Wisdom of the Bench and Bar", pp.85–86. The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; During that case, these famous words are said to have been uttered: "The air of England has long been too pure for a slave, and every man is free who breathes it".&lt;ref&gt;George Birkbeck Hil (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=2EQCXQ0IbUkC&amp;pg=PA364&amp;dq=The+air+of+England+has+long+been+too+pure+for+a+slave,+and+every+man+is+free+who+breathes+it.&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20air%20of%20England%20has%20long%20been%20too%20pure%20for%20a%20slave%2C%20and%20every%20man%20is%20free%20who%20breathes%20it. Life of Johnson, Volume 3] Kessinger Publishing, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Seven Years' War]] and later conflicts, the Writ was used on behalf of soldiers and sailors [[Impressment|pressed]] into military and naval service.&lt;ref&gt;Costello, Kevin, Habeas Corpus and Military and Naval Impressment 1756–1816, The Journal of Legal History 29.2 215 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Habeas Corpus Act 1816]] introduced some changes and expanded the territoriality of the legislation.

The privilege of ''habeas corpus'' has been suspended or restricted several times during [[English history]], most recently during the 18th and 19th centuries. Although internment without trial has been authorised by statute since that time, for example during the two [[World War]]s and the [[The Troubles|Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]], the ''habeas corpus'' procedure has in modern times always technically remained available to such internees. However, as ''habeas corpus'' is only a procedural device to examine the lawfulness of a prisoner's detention, so long as the detention is in accordance with an [[Act of Parliament]], the petition for ''habeas corpus'' is unsuccessful. Since the passage of the [[Human Rights Act 1998]], the courts have been able to declare an Act of Parliament to be incompatible with the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], but such a declaration of incompatibility has no legal effect unless and until it is acted upon by the government.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt200607/jtselect/jtrights/128/12807.htm Joint Committee On Human Rights Sixteenth Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

The wording of the writ of ''habeas corpus'' implies that the prisoner is brought to the court for the legality of the imprisonment to be examined. However, rather than issuing the writ immediately and waiting for the return of the writ by the custodian, modern practice in England is for the original application to be followed by a hearing with both parties present to decide the legality of the detention, without any writ being issued. If the detention is held to be unlawful, the prisoner can usually then be released or [[bail]]ed by order of the court without having to be produced before it. With the development of modern public law, applications for habeas corpus have been to some extent discouraged, in favour of applications for [[judicial review]].&lt;ref&gt;Re (Habeas Corpus) [1996] QB 599; Re B [1991] 1 FLR 106&lt;/ref&gt; The writ, however, maintains its vigour, and was held by the UK Supreme Court to be available in respect of a prisoner captured by British forces in Afghanistan, albeit that the Secretary of State made a valid return to the writ justifying the detention of the claimant.&lt;ref&gt;[[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs v Rahmatullah]] [2012] UKSC 48&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
The writ of ''habeas corpus'' as a procedural remedy is part of [[Australia]]'s English law inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, David and Gerard McCoy (1998), "Habeas Corpus" (Federation Press)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the [[Australian parliament]] passed the [[Australian Anti-Terrorism Act 2005]]. Some legal experts questioned the constitutionality of the act, due in part to limitations it placed on ''habeas corpus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Human Rights Guide to Australia's Counter-Terrorism Laws|url=https://www.humanrights.gov.au/human-rights-guide-australias-counter-terrorism-laws|website=Australian Human Rights Commission|accessdate=13 April 2015|date=2012-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UNESCOZ&gt;{{cite web|title=National security and anti-terrorism laws in Australia|url=http://www.thenewsmanual.net/Resources/medialaw_in_australia_06.html|website=The News Manual|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rix|first1=Mark|title=Australia's Anti-Terrorism Legislation - The national security state and the community legal sector.|journal=Research Online - University of Wollongong|date=2006|url=http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&amp;context=gsbpapers|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
''Habeas corpus'' rights are part of the British legal tradition inherited by Canada. The rights exist in the common law but have been enshrined in the [[Constitution Act 1982]], under [[Section Ten of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section Ten]] of the [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-15.html |title=The Constitution Act, 1982; Part I, Section 10(c): Legal Rights |publisher=Canadian Department of Justice |accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This states that "Everyone has the right on arrest or detention&amp;nbsp;... (c) to have the validity of the detention determined by way of ''habeas corpus'' and to be released if the detention is not lawful".

Suspension of the writ in Canadian history occurred famously during the [[October Crisis]], during which the [[War Measures Act]] was invoked by the [[Governor General of Canada]] on the [[Advice (constitutional)|constitutional advice]] of Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]], who had received a request from the [[Quebec]] Cabinet. The Act was also used to justify German, Slavic, and [[Ukrainian Canadian internment]] during the [[First World War]], and the internment of German-Canadians, Italian-Canadians and [[Japanese Canadian internment|Japanese-Canadians]] during the [[Second World War]]. The writ was suspended for several years following the [[Battle of Fort Erie (1866)]] during the [[Fenian Rising]], though the suspension was only ever applied to suspects in the [[Thomas D'Arcy McGee]] assassination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/033001/f2/033001-1402.7-e.pdf |title=The Fenians in Canada |author=David A. Wilson |publisher=[[Library and Archives Canada]] |accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The writ is available where there is no other adequate remedy. However, a superior court always has the discretion to grant the writ even in the face of an alternative remedy (see ''May v Ferndale Institution'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII |litigants=May v Ferndale Institution |link= |year=2005 |court=scc |num=82 |parallelcite=[2005] 3 SCR 809 |date=2005-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] the writ is largely unavailable if a statutory right of appeal exists, whether or not this right has been exercised.

===France===
A fundamental human right in the "1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man]]" drafted by [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]] in cooperation with [[Thomas Jefferson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monticello.org/site/jefferson/marquis-de-lafayette|title=Marquis de Lafayette|publisher=Thomas Jefferson Encyclopedia|date=2014|accessdate=2014-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the guarantees against arbitrary detention are enshrined in the French Constitution and regulated by the Penal Code. The safeguards are equivalent to those found under the Habeas-Corpus provisions found in Germany, the United States and several Commonwealth countries. The French system of accountability prescribes severe penalties for ministers, police officers and civil and judiciary authorities who either violate or fail to enforce the law.

"Article 7 of [1789] Declaration also provides that 'No individual may be accused, arrested, or detained except where the law so prescribes, and in accordance with the procedure it has laid down.' ... The Constitution further states that 'No one may be arbitrarily detained. The judicial authority, guardian of individual liberty, ensures the observance of this principle under the condition specified by law.' Its article 5 provides that everyone has the right to liberty and sets forth permissible circumstances under which people may be deprived of their liberty and procedural safeguards in case of detention. In particular, it states that 'anyone deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/habeas-corpus/france.php|title=Habeas Corpus Rights: France - Author - Nicole Atwill, Senior Foreign Law Specialist|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|date=2009|accessdate=2014-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

France and the United States played a synergistic role in the international team, led by Eleanor Roosevelt, which crafted the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. The French judge and Nobel Peace Laureate [[René Cassin]] produced the first draft&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.droits-fondamentaux.org/spip.php?article42 |title="A World Made New, Eleanor Roosevelt and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights" de Mary Ann GLENDON - Author Emmanuel Decaux |publisher=Le Centre de recherche sur les droits de l'homme et le droit humanitaire, CRDH, Université Panthéon-Assas |accessdate=2014-06-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714114736/http://www.droits-fondamentaux.org/spip.php?article42 |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/history.shtml |title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights: History of The Document |publisher=The United Nations |accessdate=2014-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and argued against arbitrary detentions. René Cassin and the French team subsequently championed the ''habeas corpus'' provisions enshrined in the [[European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/history/twentieth-century-european-history/rene-cassin-and-human-rights-great-war-universal-declaration?format=HB |title=René Cassin and Human Rights: From the Great War to the Universal Declaration - Authors - Jay Winter, Antoine Prost |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=June 2013 |accessdate=2013-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
Germany has constitutional guarantees against improper detention and these have been implemented in statutory law in a manner that can be considered as equivalent to writs of habeas corpus.

Article 104, paragraph 1 of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]] provides that deprivations of liberty may be imposed only on the basis of a specific enabling statute that also must include procedural rules. Article 104, paragraph 2 requires that any arrested individual be brought before a judge by the end of the day following the day of the arrest. For those detained as criminal suspects, article 104, paragraph 3 specifically requires that the judge must grant a hearing to the suspect in order to rule on the detention.

Restrictions on the power of the authorities to arrest and detain individuals also emanate from article 2 paragraph 2 of the Basic Law which guarantees liberty and requires a statutory authorization for any deprivation of liberty. In addition, several other articles of the Basic Law have a bearing on the issue. The most important of these are article 19, which generally requires a statutory basis for any infringements of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Basic Law while also guaranteeing judicial review; article 20, paragraph 3, which guarantees the rule of law; and article 3 which guarantees equality.

In particular, a constitutional obligation to grant remedies for improper detention is required by article 19, paragraph 4 of the Basic Law, which provides as follows: "Should any person's right be violated by public authority, he may have recourse to the courts. If no other jurisdiction has been established, recourse shall be to the ordinary courts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/habeas-corpus/germany.php |title=Habeas Corpus Rights: Germany&amp;#124;Law Library of Congress |publisher=Loc.gov |date= March 2009|accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
The Indian judiciary, in a catena of cases, has effectively resorted to the writ of ''habeas corpus'' to secure release of a person from illegal detention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Baxi |first1=Pratiksha (April 2009 - Reprint 2012) |title=Habeas Corpus Juridical Narratives of Sexual Governance |url=http://www.jnu.ac.in/cslg/workingPaper/09-Habeus%20%28Pratiksha%20Baxi%29.pdf |publisher=Centre for the Study of Law and Governance Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi |accessdate=23 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006125237/http://www.jnu.ac.in/cslg/workingPaper/09-Habeus%20%28Pratiksha%20Baxi%29.pdf |archivedate=6 October 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in October 2009, the Karnataka High Court heard a ''habeas corpus'' petition filed by the parents of a girl who married a Muslim boy from Kannur district and was allegedly confined in a ''madrasa'' in Malapuram town.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/love-jihad-court-unhappy-with-probe/article169724.ece|title='Love Jihad': court unhappy with probe|date=27 Oct 2009|newspaper=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, in most other jurisdictions, the writ is directed at police authorities. The extension to non-state authorities has its grounds in two cases: the 1898 [[Queen's Bench]] case of ''[[Ex Parte]] [[Proctor#Disciplinary functions|Daisy Hopkins]]'', wherein the Proctor of Cambridge University did detain and arrest Hopkins without his jurisdiction, and Hopkins was released,&lt;ref&gt;''Exparte, Hopkins'' (Daisy) (1891) 56 JP 262; 61 LJQB 240&lt;/ref&gt; and that of ''[[Somerset v Stewart]]'', in which an African slave whose master had moved to London was freed by action of the writ.

The Indian judiciary has dispensed with the traditional doctrine of ''[[locus standi]]'', so that if a detained person is not in a position to file a petition, it can be moved on his behalf by any other person. The scope of ''habeas'' relief has expanded in recent times by actions of the Indian judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legalserviceindia.com/articles/wha.htm |title=Writ Of Habeas Corpus For Securing Liberty - Author - ABS-CBN News |publisher=Legalserviceindia.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, the ''habeas'' writ was used in the [[Rajan case]], a student victim of torture in local police custody during the nationwide [[The Emergency (India)|Emergency]] in India. On 12 March 2014, [[Subrata Roy]]'s counsel approached the Chief Justice moving a ''habeas corpus'' petition. It was also filed by the Panthers Party to protest the imprisonment of [[Anna Hazare]], a social activist.

===Ireland===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], the writ of ''habeas corpus'' is available at common law and under the Habeas Corpus Acts of 1782 and 1816. A remedy equivalent to ''habeas corpus'' is also guaranteed by Article 40 of the [[Constitution of Ireland|1937 constitution]].

The article guarantees that "no citizen shall be deprived of his personal liberty save in accordance with law" and outlines a specific procedure for the [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]] to enquire into the lawfulness of any person's detention. It does not mention the Latin term, ''habeas corpus'', but includes the English phrase "produce the body".

Article 40.4.2° provides that a prisoner, or anyone acting on his behalf, may make a complaint to the High Court (or to any High Court judge) of unlawful detention. The court must then investigate the matter "forthwith" and may order that the defendant bring the prisoner before the court and give reasons for his detention. The court must immediately release the detainee unless it is satisfied that he is being held lawfully. The remedy is available not only to prisoners of the state, but also to persons unlawfully detained by any private party. However the constitution provides that the procedure is not binding on the [[Irish Defence Forces|Defence Forces]] during a state of war or armed rebellion.

The full text of Article 40.4.2° is as follows: {{quote|Upon complaint being made by or on behalf of any person to the High Court or any judge thereof alleging that such person is being unlawfully detained, the High Court and any and every judge thereof to whom such complaint is made shall forthwith enquire into the said complaint and may order the person in whose custody such person is detained to ''produce the body'' of such person before the High Court on a named day and to certify in writing the grounds of his detention, and the High Court shall, upon the body of such person being produced before that Court and after giving the person in whose custody he is detained an opportunity of justifying the detention, order the release of such person from such detention unless satisfied that he is being detained in accordance with the law. [''Italics'' added]}}

The writ of ''habeas corpus'' continued as part of the Irish law when the state seceded from the [[United Kingdom]] in 1922. A remedy equivalent to ''habeas corpus'' was also guaranteed by Article 6 of the [[Constitution of the Irish Free State]], enacted in 1922. That article used similar wording to Article 40.4 of the current constitution, which replaced it 1937.

The relationship between the Article 40 and the Habeas Corpus Acts of 1782 and 1816 is ambiguous, and Forde and Leonard write that "The extent if any to which Art 40.4 has replaced these Acts has yet to be determined". In ''The State (Ahern) v Cotter'' (1982) Walsh J opined that the ancient writ referred to in the Habeas Corpus Acts remains in existence in Irish law as a separate remedy from that provided for in Article 40.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Forde, David Leonard, ''Constitutional Law of Ireland'', 2013, pp. 371-372.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, the Article 40 procedure was restricted by the [[Second Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Second Amendment]]. Prior to the amendment, a prisoner had the constitutional right to apply to any [[High Court of the Republic of Ireland|High Court]] judge for an enquiry into her detention, and to as many High Court judges as she wished. If the prisoner successfully challenged her detention before the High Court she was entitled to immediate, unconditional release.

The Second Amendment provided that a prisoner has only the right to apply to a single judge, and, once a writ has been issued, the President of the High Court has authority to choose the judge or panel of three judges who will decide the case. If the High Court finds that the prisoner's detention is unlawful due to the unconstitutionality of a law the judge must refer the matter to the [[Irish Supreme Court|Supreme Court]], and until the Supreme's Court's decision is rendered the prisoner may be released only on bail.

The power of the state to detain persons prior to trial was extended by the [[Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Sixteenth Amendment]], in 1996. In 1965, the Supreme Court ruled in the ''O'Callaghan'' case that the constitution required that an individual charged with a crime could be refused bail only if she was likely to flee or to interfere with witnesses or evidence. Since the Sixteenth Amendment, it has been possible for a court to take into account whether a person has committed serious crimes while on bail in the past.

===Italy===
The right to freedom from arbitrary detention is guaranteed by Article 13 of the [[Constitution of Italy]], which states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Italian Constitution|url=http://www.quirinale.it/page/costituzione|publisher=The official website of the Presidency of the Italian Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|Personal liberty is inviolable. No one may be detained, inspected, or searched nor otherwise subjected to any restriction of personal liberty except by order of the Judiciary stating a reason and only in such cases and in such manner as provided by the law. In exceptional circumstances and under such conditions of necessity and urgency as shall conclusively be defined by the law, the police may take provisional measures that shall be referred within 48 hours to the Judiciary for validation and which, in default of such validation in the following 48 hours, shall be revoked and considered null and void. Any act of physical and moral violence against a person subjected to restriction of personal liberty shall be punished. The law shall establish the maximum duration of preventive detention.}}

===Malaysia===
In [[Malaysia]], the remedy of ''habeas corpus'' is guaranteed by the federal constitution, although not by name. Article 5(2) of the [[Constitution of Malaysia]] provides that "Where complaint is made to a High Court or any judge thereof that a person is being unlawfully detained the court shall inquire into the complaint and, unless satisfied that the detention is lawful, shall order him to be produced before the court and release him".

As there are several statutes, for example, the [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act 1960]], that still permit detention without trial, the procedure is usually effective in such cases only if it can be shown that there was a procedural error in the way that the detention was ordered.

===New Zealand===
In [[New Zealand]], ''habeas corpus'' may be invoked against the government or private individuals. In 2006, a child was allegedly kidnapped by his maternal grandfather after a custody dispute. The father began ''habeas corpus'' proceedings against the mother, the grandfather, the grandmother, the great grandmother, and another person alleged to have assisted in the kidnap of the child. The mother did not present the child to the court and so was imprisoned for [[contempt of court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;ObjectID=10407667|title=New Zealand Herald newspaper|publisher=Nzherald.co.nz|date=2006-10-26|accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was released when the grandfather came forward with the child in late January 2007.

===Pakistan===
Issuance of a writ is an exercise of an extraordinary jurisdiction of the superior courts in Pakistan. A writ of habeas corpus may be issued by any High Court of a province in Pakistan. Article 199 of the [[Constitution of Pakistan|1973 Constitution]] of the [[Islamic Republic of Pakistan]], specifically provides for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, empowering the courts to exercise this prerogative. Subject to the Article 199 of the Constitution, "A High Court may, if it is satisfied that no other adequate remedy is provided by law, on the application of any person, make an order that a person in custody within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court be brought before it so that the Court may satisfy itself that he is not being held in custody without a lawful authority or in an unlawful manner". The hallmark of extraordinary constitutional jurisdiction is to keep various functionaries of State within the ambit of their authority. Once a High Court has assumed jurisdiction to adjudicate the matter before it, justiciability of the issue raised before it is beyond question. The Supreme Court of Pakistan has stated clearly that the use of words "in an unlawful manner" implies that the court may examine, if a statute has allowed such detention, whether it was a colorable exercise of the power of authority. Thus, the court can examine the malafides of the action taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/habeas-corpus/pakistan.php|title=Habeas Corpus Rights: Pakistan|work=loc.gov|date=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Philippines===
In the Bill of Rights of the Philippine constitution, ''habeas corpus'' is guaranteed in terms almost identically to those used in the U.S. Constitution. in Article 3, Section 15 of the [[Constitution of the Philippines]] states that "The privilege of the writ of ''habeas corpus'' shall not be suspended except in cases of invasion or rebellion when the public safety requires it".

In 1971, after the [[Plaza Miranda bombing]], the Marcos administration, under [[Ferdinand Marcos]], suspended ''habeas corpus'' in an effort to stifle the oncoming insurgency, having blamed the [[Communist Party of the Philippines|Filipino Communist Party]] for the events of August 21. Many considered this to be a prelude to [[martial law]]. After widespread protests, however, the Arroyo administration decided to reintroduce the writ. In December 2009, ''habeas corpus'' was suspended in Maguindanao as the province was placed under martial law. This occurred in response to the [[Maguindanao massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=andoybarrios on Sat, 12/05/2009 - 23:08|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/12/04/09/arroyo-orders-martial-law-maguindanao|title=Arroyo proclaims martial law in Maguindanao - ABS-CBN News Online|publisher=Abs-cbnnews.com|date=2009-12-05|accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] said he was planning on suspending the habeas corpus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/152167-duterte-suspend-writ-habeas-corpus-warning|title=Duterte to suspend writ of habeas corpus if 'forced'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 23, 2017 at 10&amp;nbsp;pm Philippine time, President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] declared martial law in the whole island of Mindanao including Sulu and Tawi-tawi for the period of 60 days due to the series of attacks mounted by the [[Maute group]], an ISIS-linked terrorist organization. The declaration suspends the writ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2017/05/23/1703088/duterte-declares-martial-law-mindanao|title=Duterte declares martial law in Mindanao|accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scotland===
The [[Parliament of Scotland]] passed a law to have the same effect as ''habeas corpus'' in the 18th century. This is now known as the Criminal Procedure Act 1701 c.6.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?ActiveTextDocId=1519689 Full text of the Act]. This law was given its current short title by the [[Statute Law Revision (Scotland) Act 1964]]&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally called "the Act for preventing wrongful imprisonment and against undue delays in trials". It is still in force although certain parts have been repealed.

===Spain===
The present [[Constitution of Spain]] states that "A ''habeas corpus'' procedure shall be provided for by law to ensure the immediate handing over to the judicial authorities of any person illegally arrested". The statute which regulates the procedure is the ''Law of Habeas Corpus of 24 May 1984'', which provides that a person imprisoned may, on her or his own or through a third person, allege that she or he is imprisoned unlawfully and request to appear before a judge. The request must specify the grounds on which the detention is considered to be unlawful, which can be, for example, that the custodian holding the prisoner does not have the legal authority, that the prisoner's constitutional rights have been violated, or that he has been subjected to mistreatment. The judge may then request additional information if needed, and may issue a ''habeas corpus'' order, at which point the custodian has 24 hours to bring the prisoner before the judge.

Historically, many of the territories of Spain had remedies equivalent to the ''habeas corpus'', such as the privilege of ''manifestación'' in the [[Crown or Aragon]] or the right of the Tree in [[Biscay]].

===United States===
{{Main|Habeas corpus in the United States}}
&lt;!-- This section is only a BRIEF SUMMARY. Please consider adding extra material to the main article instead! --&gt;
The United States inherited ''habeas corpus'' from the [[English common law]]. In England, the writ was issued in the name of the monarch. When the original [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen American colonies]] declared independence, and became a republic based on popular sovereignty, any person, in the name of the people, acquired authority to initiate such writs. The [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] specifically includes the ''habeas'' procedure in the [[Suspension Clause]] (Clause 2), located in [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One]], Section 9. This states that "The privilege of the writ of ''habeas corpus'' shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it".

The writ of ''habeas corpus ad subjiciendum'' is a civil, not criminal, ''[[ex parte]]'' proceeding in which a court inquires as to the legitimacy of a prisoner's custody. Typically, ''habeas corpus'' proceedings are to determine whether the court that imposed sentence on the defendant had jurisdiction and authority to do so, or whether the defendant's sentence has expired. ''Habeas corpus'' is also used as a legal avenue to challenge other types of custody such as pretrial detention or detention by the [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|United States Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] pursuant to a deportation proceeding.

Presidents [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Ulysses Grant]] suspended ''habeas corpus'' during the Civil War and Reconstruction for some places or types of cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/historicdocuments/a/lincolnhabeas.htm |title=Abraham Lincoln's 1862 Proclamation Suspending Habeas Corpus |publisher=Usgovinfo.about.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=70261 |title=Ulysses S. Grant: Proclamation 204 – Suspending the Writ of Habeas Corpus in the County of Union, South Carolina |publisher=Presidency.ucsb.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War II]], President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] suspended habeas corpus. Following the [[September 11 attacks]], President [[George W. Bush]] attempted to place [[Guantanamo Bay]] detainees outside of the jurisdiction of ''habeas corpus'', but the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] overturned this action in ''[[Boumediene v. Bush]]''.

==Equivalent remedies==
===Biscay===
In 1526, the ''Fuero Nuevo of the Señorío de Vizcaya'' (''New Charter of the Lordship of Biscay'') established a form of ''habeas corpus'' in the territory of the ''[[Lord of Biscay|Señorío de Vizcaya]]'', nowadays part of [[Spain]]. This revised version of the ''Fuero Viejo'' (Old Charter) of 1451 codified the medieval custom whereby no person could be arbitrarily detained without being summoned first to the [[Gernikako Arbola|Oak of Gernika]], an ancestral oak tree located in the outskirts of [[Gernika]] under which all laws of the Lordship of Biscay were passed.

The New Charter formalised that no one could be detained without a court order (Law 26 of Chapter 9) nor due to debts (Law 3 of Chapter 16). It also established that no one could be arrested without previously having been summoned to the [[Gernikako Arbola|Oak of Gernika]] and given 30 days to answer the said summon, and that upon presenting themselves under the Tree, they had to be provided with all evidence and accusations so that they could defend themselves (Law 7 of Chapter 9). No one could be sent to prison or deprived of their freedom until being formally trialed, and no one could be accused of a different crime until their current court trial was over (Law 5 of Chapter 5). Those fearing they were being arrested illegally could appeal to the ''Regimiento General'' that their rights could be upheld. The ''Regimiento'' (the executive arm of the [[Juntas Generales]] of Biscay) would demand the prisoner be handed over to them, and thereafter the prisoner would be released and placed under the protection of the Regimiento while awaiting for trial.&lt;ref&gt;Trask, L. The History of Basque Routledge: 1997 {{ISBN|0-415-13116-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crown of Aragon===
The [[Crown of Aragon]] also had a remedy equivalent to the ''habeas corpus'' called the ''manifestación de personas'' (literally, ''demonstration of persons'').&lt;ref&gt;R.E. Giesey, If not, not: The Oath of the Aragonese and the Legendary Laws of Sobrarbe. Princeton University Press, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; According to the right of ''manifestación'', the [[Justicia de Aragon]] (lit. ''Justice of Aragon'', an Aragonese judiciary figure similar to an [[ombudsman]], but with far reaching executive powers) could require a judge, a court of justice, or any other official that they handed over to the ''Justicia'' (i.e., that they ''demonstrated'') anyone being prosecuted so as to guarantee that this person's rights were upheld, and that no violence would befall this person prior to him being sentenced.&lt;ref name="Tomás y Valiente 2000"&gt;Tomás y Valiente, Francisco (2000). La tortura judicial en España (2ª edición). Barcelona: Crítica. {{ISBN|84-8432-029-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the ''Justicia'' retained the right to examine the judgement and decide whether it satisfied the conditions of a fair trial; if the ''Justicia'' was not satisfied, he could refuse to hand the accused back to the authorities. The right of ''manifestación'' acted like an habeas corpus: knowing that the appeal to the ''Justicia'' would immediately follow any unlawful detention, these were effectively illegal. Equally, [[torture]] (which had been banned since 1325 in Aragon) could never take place.&lt;ref name="Tomás y Valiente 2000"/&gt; In some cases, people exerting their right of manifestación were kept under the Justicia's watch in ''manifestación'' prisons (famous for their mild and easy conditions) or house arrest; more generally however, the person was released from confinement and placed under the ''Justicia's protection'', awaiting trial. The ''Justicia'' always granted the right of ''manifestación'' by default, but they only really had to act in extreme cases, as for instance famously happened in 1590 when [[Antonio Pérez (statesman)|Antonio Pérez]], the disgraced secretary to [[Philip II of Spain]], fled from [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]] to Aragon and used his Aragonese ascendency to appeal to the ''Justicia'' for manifestación right, and therefore prevent his arrest at the King's behest.

The right of ''manifestación'' was codified in 1325 in the [[Declaratio Privilegii generalis]] passed by the [[Aragonese Corts]] under king [[James II of Aragon]].&lt;ref&gt;González Antón, Luis, ''Las Uniones aragonesas y las Cortes del Reino (1283-1301)'', Zaragoza, Escuela de Estudios Medievales; CSIC; Librería General, 1975. {{ISBN|978-84-00-04150-2}} [http://books.google.es/books?id=sIYVCrzY8-4C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage Vol I. Texto]. {{ISBN|978-84-00-04151-9}} [http://books.google.es/books?id=FVbKFaPne8sC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage Vol. II. Documentos]. {{ISBN|978-84-00-04177-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had been practiced since the inception of the kingdom of Aragon in the 11th century, and therefore predates the ''habeas corpus'' itself.&lt;ref name="Tomás y Valiente 2000"/&gt;

===Poland===
In 1430, King [[Władysław II Jagiełło]] of Poland granted the Privilege of [[Jedlnia]], which proclaimed, ''[[Neminem captivabimus]] nisi iure victum'' ("We will not imprison anyone except if convicted by law"). This revolutionary innovation in civil [[libertarianism]] gave Polish citizens due process-style rights that did not exist in any other European country for another 250 years. Originally, the Privilege of Jedlnia was restricted to the nobility (the [[szlachta]]), but it was extended to cover townsmen in the [[Constitution of 3rd May|1791 Constitution]]. Importantly, social classifications in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] were not as rigid as in other European countries; townspeople and Jews were sometimes ennobled. The Privilege of Jedlnia provided broader coverage than many subsequently enacted habeas corpus laws because Poland's nobility constituted an unusually large percentage of the country's total population, which was Europe's largest. As a result, by the 16th century, it was protecting the liberty of between five hundred thousand and a million Poles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indylaw.indiana.edu/instructors/cole/web%20page/polconst.pdf Poland's 1997 Constitution in Its Historical Context]; Daniel H. Cole, Indiana University School of Law, September 22, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman-Dutch law===
In [[South Africa]] and other countries whose legal systems are based on [[Roman-Dutch law]], the ''[[interdictum de homine libero exhibendo]]'' is the equivalent of the writ of ''habeas corpus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Murdoch |last=Watney |title=Arrest, detention and the ''interdictum de homine libero exhibendo'' |journal=Journal of South African Law |volume=2011 |year=2011 |number=3 |pages=555–562 |url=http://reference.sabinet.co.za/webx/access/electronic_journals/ju_tsar/ju_tsar_2011_n3_a10.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In South Africa, it has been entrenched in the [[Bill of Rights (South Africa)|Bill of Rights]], which provides in section 35(2)(d) that every detained person has the right to challenge the lawfulness of the detention in person before a court and, if the detention is unlawful, to be released.

==World ''habeas corpus''==
In the 1950s, American lawyer [[Luis Kutner]] began advocating an international writ of ''habeas corpus'' to protect individual human rights. In 1952, he filed a petition for a "United Nations Writ of Habeas Corpus" on behalf of [[William N. Oatis]], an American journalist jailed the previous year by the Communist government of [[Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;The petition was titled "United Nations Ex Rel., Luis Kutner, For and on Behalf of William N. Oatis, Petitioner, v. Czechoslovakia, Respondent - Petition of Luis Kutner For and on Behalf of William N. Oatis, For a United Nations Writ of Habeas Corpus." See [http://cornelllawreview.org/files/2013/03/Jacksonfinal.pdf Vicki C. Jackson, "World Habeas Corpus", 91 Cornell Law Review 303, 309 (January 2006).] (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; Alleging that Czechoslovakia had violated Oatis's rights under the [[United Nations Charter]] and the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and that the [[United Nations General Assembly]] had "inherent power" to fashion remedies for human rights violations, the petition was filed with the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]].&lt;ref name=Jackson&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://cornelllawreview.org/files/2013/03/Jacksonfinal.pdf|format=PDF|first=Vicki C. |last=Jackson|title=World Habeas Corpus |volume=91 Cornell Law Review 303, 309-314 |year=January 2006|website=cornelllawreview.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission forwarded the petition to Czechoslovakia, but no other United Nations action was taken.&lt;ref name=Jackson/&gt; Oatis was released in 1953. Kutner went on to publish numerous articles and books advocating the creation of an "International Court of Habeas Corpus".&lt;ref&gt;His first article was "A Proposal for a United Nations Writ of Habeas Corpus and International Court of Human Rights", Tulane Law Review, 28 (June 1954): 417-441. See also, Luis Kutner, ''World Habeas Corpus'', Dobbs Ferry, NY: Oceana, 1962, p. 266, for his draft of a "Treaty-Statute of the International Court of Habeas Corpus".&lt;/ref&gt;

==International human rights standards==
Article 3 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] provides that "everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person". [[Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights]] goes further and calls for persons detained to have the right to challenge their detention, providing at article 5.4: {{quote|Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful.}}

The '''electronic&amp;ndash;hydraulic analogy''' (derisively referred to as the '''drain-pipe theory''' by [[Oliver Lodge]]) &lt;ref&gt;[[Paul J. Nahin]], ''Oliver Heaviside: The Life, Work, and Times of an Electrical Genius of the Victorian Age'', JHU Press, 2002 
{{ISBN|0801869099}} page 59&lt;/ref&gt; is the most widely used analogy for "electron fluid" in a metal conductor.  Since [[electric current]] is invisible and the processes at play in [[electronics]] are often difficult to demonstrate, the various [[electronic component]]s are represented by [[hydraulic]] equivalents.  Electricity (as well as [[heat current|heat]]) was originally understood to be a kind of [[fluid]], and the names of certain electric quantities (such as current) are derived from hydraulic equivalents.  As with all analogies, it demands an intuitive and competent understanding of the baseline [[paradigm]]s (electronics and hydraulics).

==Paradigms==
There is no unique paradigm for establishing this analogy.  Two paradigms can be used to introduce the concept to students using pressure induced by gravity or by pumps.

In the version with pressure induced by gravity, large tanks of water are held up high, or are filled to differing water levels, and the potential energy of the water [[Head (hydraulic)|head]] is the pressure source.  This is reminiscent of electrical diagrams with an up arrow pointing to +V, grounded pins that otherwise are not shown connecting to anything, and so on.  This has the advantage of associating [[electric potential]] with [[gravitational potential]].

A second paradigm is a completely enclosed version with pumps providing pressure only and no gravity.  This is reminiscent of a circuit diagram with a voltage source shown and the wires actually completing a circuit.  This paradigm is further discussed below.

Other paradigms highlight the similarities between equations governing the flow of fluid and the flow of charge. Flow and pressure variables can be calculated in both steady and transient fluid flow situations with the use of the [[hydraulic ohm]] analogy.&lt;ref&gt;A. Akers, M. Gassman, &amp; R. Smith, ''Hydraulic Power System Analysis''. Taylor &amp; Francis, New York, 2006, Chapter 13, {{ISBN|0-8247-9956-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Esposito, "A Simplified Method for Analyzing Circuits by Analogy". Machine Design, October 1969, pp. 173-177.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hydraulic ohms are the units of hydraulic impedance, which is defined as the ratio of pressure to volume flow rate.  The pressure and volume flow variables are treated as [[phasor]]s in this definition, so possess a phase as well as magnitude.&lt;ref&gt;Brian J. Kirby, ''Micro- and Nanoscale Fluid Mechanics'', p. 69, Cambridge University Press, 2010 {{ISBN|1139489836}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A slightly different paradigm is used in acoustics, where [[acoustic impedance]] is defined as a relationship between pressure and air speed.  In this paradigm, a large cavity with a hole is analogous to a capacitor that stores compressional energy when the time-dependent pressure deviates from atmospheric pressure. A hole (or long tube) is analogous to an inductor that stores kinetic energy associated with the flow of air.&lt;ref&gt;Schelleng, John C. "The violin as a circuit." The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 35.3 (2005): 326-338. http://www.maestronet.com/forum/index.php?app=core&amp;module=attach&amp;section=attach&amp;attach_id=13435&lt;/ref&gt;

A circuit was used to model feedback stabilization of a hydrodynamic plasma instability in a [[magnetic mirror]] &lt;ref&gt;"Axial feedback stabilization of a flute mode in a simple mirror reactor, by M. A. Lieberman and S. L. Wong, Plasma Physics, Vol. 19, pp. 745-55 (1977). The article contains an L-C circuit that is unstable because the "capacitance" is negative: http://iopscience.iop.org/0032-1028/19/8/005/pdf/0032-1028_19_8_005.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  In this application, the effort was to keep the plasma column centered by applying voltages to the plates, and except for the presence of turbulence and non-linear effects, the plasma was an actual electric circuit element (not really an analog).

==Hydraulic analogy with horizontal water flow==

===Voltage, current, and charge===
[[File:Hydraulic pressure.svg|thumb|300px|Hydraulic pressure difference]]
In general, [[electric potential]] is equivalent to [[hydraulic head]]. This model assumes that the water is flowing horizontally, so that the force of gravity can be ignored.  In this case electric potential is equivalent to [[pressure]].  The [[voltage]] (or [[voltage drop]] or ''potential difference'') is a difference in pressure between two points. Electric potential and voltage are usually measured in [[volts]]. 
 
[[Electric current]] is equivalent to a hydraulic [[volume flow rate]]; that is, the volumetric quantity of flowing water over time.  Usually measured in [[amperes]].

[[Electric charge]] is equivalent to a quantity of water.

===Basic circuit elements===
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Electrionics Analogy - Pipe (Wire).svg|''[[electrical wiring|Conducting wire]]:''&amp;nbsp; a simple pipe.
Image:Electrionics Analogy - Reduced Pipe (Resistor).svg|''[[Resistor]]:''&amp;nbsp;a constricted pipe.
File:1-1111 CU-solderfitting-type 5130-22.jpg|''Node in [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchhoff's junction rule]]:''&amp;nbsp;A [[Piping and plumbing fittings|pipe tee]] filled with flowing water.
 
&lt;/gallery&gt;
A relatively wide pipe completely filled with water is equivalent to [[Wire|conducting wire]].  When comparing to a piece of wire, the pipe should be thought of as having semi-permanent caps on the ends.  Connecting one end of a wire to a circuit is equivalent to un-capping one end of the pipe and attaching it to another pipe.  With few exceptions (such as a high-voltage power source), a wire with only one end attached to a circuit will do nothing; the pipe remains capped on the free end, and thus adds nothing to the circuit.

A [[resistor]] is equivalent to a constriction in the bore of the pipe which requires more pressure to pass the same amount of water. All pipes have some resistance to flow, just as all wires have some resistance to current.

A node (or junction) in [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchhoff's junction rule]] is equivalent to a [[Piping and plumbing fittings|pipe tee]].  The net flow of water into a piping tee (filled with water) must equal the net flow out.
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:CapacitorHydraulicAnalogyAnimation.gif|''[[Capacitor]]:''&amp;nbsp; a flexible diaphragm sealed inside a pipe.
File:Hydraulic inductor model.svg|''[[Inductor]]:''&amp;nbsp; a heavy paddle wheel or turbine placed in the current.
File:Axial compressor.gif|''[[voltage source|Voltage]] or [[current source|current]] source:'' &amp;nbsp;A dynamic pump with feedback control.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

A [[capacitor]] is equivalent to a tank with one connection at each end and a rubber sheet dividing the tank in two lengthwise&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amasci.com/emotor/cap1.html|title=ELECTRICITY MISCONCEPTIONS:  Capacitor|website=amasci.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a [[hydraulic accumulator]]). When water is forced into one pipe, equal water is simultaneously forced out of the other pipe, yet no water can penetrate the rubber diaphragm. Energy is stored by the stretching of the rubber. As more current flows "through" the capacitor, the back-pressure (voltage) becomes greater, thus current "leads" voltage in a capacitor. As the back-pressure from the stretched rubber approaches the applied pressure, the current becomes less and less. Thus capacitors "filter out" constant pressure differences and slowly varying, low-frequency pressure differences, while allowing rapid changes in pressure to pass through. &lt;!--Don't understand the next paragraph--&gt;
&lt;!--  Note that the device described will pass all changes in pressure "through" equally well, regardless of rate of change, just as an electrical capacitor will. Any device in series must obey (electrical) Kirchhoff's Current Law, or its hydraulic equivalent. 
Considering the "filter" action, a better and more exact analogy is the hydraulic accumulator "pressure tank", as described, but with a closed, pressurized air bladder and only one water connection. Such accumulators are commonly used in hydraulic power systems exactly for the purpose of damping out pressure surges and "hammers" due to valves opening and closing. --&gt;
 An [[inductor]] is equivalent to a heavy paddle wheel placed in the current. The [[mass]] of the wheel and the size of the blades restrict the water's ability to rapidly change its rate of flow (current) through the wheel due to the effects of [[inertia]], but, given time, a constant flowing stream will pass mostly unimpeded through the wheel, as it turns at the same speed as the water flow. The mass and surface area of the wheel and its blades are analogous to inductance, and friction between its axle and the axle bearings corresponds to the resistance that accompanies any non-superconducting inductor.&lt;br/&gt;An alternative inductor model is simply a long pipe, perhaps coiled into a spiral for convenience.  This fluid-inertia device is used in real life as an essential component of a [[hydraulic ram]].  The [[inertia]] of the water flowing through the pipe produces the inductance effect; inductors "filter out" rapid changes in flow, while allowing slow variations in current to be passed through.  The drag imposed by the walls of the pipe is somewhat analogous to parasitic resistance. &lt;br/&gt;In either model, the pressure difference (voltage) across the device must be present before the current will start moving, thus in inductors voltage "leads" current. As the current increases, approaching the limits imposed by its own internal friction and of the current that the rest of the circuit can provide, the pressure drop across the device becomes lower and lower.{{clear}}

An ideal [[voltage source]] (ideal [[battery (electricity)|battery]]) or ideal [[current source]] is a [[gas compressor|dynamic pump]] with feedback control. A pressure meter on both sides shows that regardless of the current being produced, this kind of pump produces constant pressure difference.  If one terminal is kept fixed at ground, another analogy is a large body of water at a high elevation, sufficiently large that the drawn water does not affect the water level.  To create the analog of an ideal [[current source]], use a [[positive displacement pump]]: A current meter (little [[paddle wheel]]) shows that when this kind of pump is driven at a constant speed, it maintains a constant speed of the little paddle wheel.

===Other circuit elements===
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Electrionics Analogy - Valve (Diode, conducting).svg|A simple one-way ball-type check valve, in its "open" state acts as a diode in its conducting state.
Image:Electrionics Analogy - Pressure-activated valve (Transistor).svg|A pressure-actuated valve combined with a one-way check valve acts as a (field-effect) transistor.
Image:Electrionics Analogy - Valve (Diodes comparison).svg|Like a one-way check valve, a diode blocks current that flows the wrong way.  Current that flows the right way goes through almost unchanged.
Image:Electrionics Analogy - Example Circuit.svg|A simple A/C circuit consisting of an oscillating pump, a "diode" valve, and a "capacitor" tank.  Any kind of motor could be used here to drive the pump, as long as it oscillates.
&lt;/gallery&gt;
A [[diode]] is equivalent to a one-way [[check valve]] with a slightly leaky valve seat.  As with a diode, a small pressure difference is needed before the valve opens.  And like a diode, too much  [[P-n junction#Reverse bias|reverse bias]] can damage or destroy the valve assembly.

A [[transistor]] is a valve in which a diaphragm, controlled by a low-current signal (either constant current for a [[Bipolar junction transistor|BJT]] or constant pressure for a [[Field effect transistor|FET]]), moves a plunger which affects the current through another section of pipe.

[[CMOS]] is a combination of two [[MOSFET]] transistors.  As the input pressure changes, the pistons allow the output to connect to either zero or positive pressure.

A [[memristor]] is a [[needle valve]] operated by a flow meter.  As water flows through in the forward direction, the needle valve restricts flow more; as water flows the other direction, the needle valve opens further providing less resistance.

== Principal equivalents ==
EM wave speed ([[velocity of propagation]]) is equivalent to the [[speed of sound]] in water.  When a light switch is flipped, the electric wave travels very quickly through the wires.

Charge flow speed ([[drift velocity]]) is equivalent to the particle speed of water.  The moving charges themselves move rather slowly.

[[Direct current|DC]] is equivalent to the a constant flow of water in a circuit of pipes.

[[Low frequency]] [[Alternating current|AC]] is equivalent to water oscillating back and forth in a pipe

[[high frequency|Higher-frequency]] AC and [[transmission line]]s is somewhat equivalent to [[sound]] being transmitted through the water pipes, though this does not properly mirror the cyclical reversal of alternating electric current. As described, the fluid flow conveys pressure fluctuations, but fluids do not reverse at high rates in hydraulic systems, which the above "low frequency" entry does accurately describe. A better concept (if sound waves are to be the phenomenon) is that of direct current with high-frequency "ripple" superimposed.

Inductive spark used in [[induction coil]]s is similar to [[water hammer]], caused by the inertia of water

If the differential equations have the same form, the response will be similar.

== Limits to the analogy ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
If taken too far, the water analogy can create misconceptions.  For it to be useful, one must remain aware of the regions where electricity and water behave very differently.

'''[[electromagnetic field|Fields]] ([[Maxwell equations]], [[Inductance]]):''' Electrons can push or pull other distant electrons via their fields, while water molecules experience forces only from direct contact with other molecules.  For this reason, waves in water travel at the speed of sound, but waves in a sea of charge will travel much faster as the forces from one electron are applied to many distant electrons and not to only the neighbors in direct contact.  In a hydraulic transmission line, the energy flows as mechanical waves through the water, but in an electric transmission line the energy flows as fields in the space surrounding the wires, and does not flow inside the metal.  Also, an accelerating electron will drag its neighbors along while attracting them, both because of magnetic forces.

'''Charge:'''  Unlike water, movable charge carriers can be positive or negative, and conductors can exhibit an overall positive or negative net charge.  The mobile carriers in electric currents are usually electrons, but sometimes they are charged positively, such as the positive ions in an [[electrolyte]], the [[hydron (chemistry)|H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;ions]] in [[proton conductor]]s or [[electron hole|holes]] in [[p-type semiconductor]]s and some (very rare) conductors.

'''Leaking pipes:'''  The [[electric charge]] of an electrical circuit and its elements is usually almost equal to zero, hence it is (almost) constant. This is formalized in [[Kirchhoff's current law]], which does not have an analogy to hydraulic systems, where amount of the liquid is not usually constant. Even with [[incompressible]] liquid the system may contain such elements as [[piston]]s and open pools, so the volume of liquid contained in a part of the system can change. For this reason, continuing electric currents require closed loops rather than hydraulics' open source/sink resembling spigots and buckets.

'''Fluid velocity and resistance of metals:'''  As with water hoses, the carrier drift velocity in conductors is directly proportional to current.  However, water only experiences drag via the pipes' inner surface, while charges are slowed at all points within a metal, as with water forced through a filter.  Also, typical velocity of charge carriers within a conductor is less than centimeters per minute, and the "electrical friction" is extremely high.  If charges ever flowed as fast as water can flow in pipes, the electric current would be immense, and the conductors would become incandescently hot and perhaps vaporize.  To model the resistance and the charge-velocity of metals, perhaps a pipe packed with sponge, or a narrow straw filled with syrup, would be a better analogy than a large-diameter water pipe. Resistance in most electrical conductors is a linear function: as current increases, voltage drop increases proportionally (Ohm's Law). Liquid resistance in pipes is not linear with volume, varying as the square of volumetric flow (see [[Darcy–Weisbach equation]]).

'''[[Quantum Mechanics]]:''' Solid conductors and insulators contain charges at more than one [[Energy level|discrete level of atomic orbit energy]], while the water in one region of a pipe can only have a single value of pressure.  For this reason there is no hydraulic explanation for such things as a [[battery (electricity)|battery]]'s charge pumping ability, a [[diode]]'s [[depletion layer]] and voltage drop, [[solar cell]] functions, [[Peltier effect]], etc., however equivalent devices can be designed which exhibit similar responses, although some of the mechanisms would only serve to regulate the flow curves rather than to contribute to the component's primary function.

In order for the model to be useful, the reader or student must have a substantial understanding of the model (hydraulic) system's principles. It also requires that the principles can be transferred to the target (electrical) system. Hydraulic systems are deceptively simple: the phenomenon of [[Cavitation#Pumps and propellers|pump cavitation]] is a known, complex problem that few people outside of the fluid power or irrigation industries would understand. For those who do, the hydraulic analogy is amusing, as no "cavitation" equivalent exists in electrical engineering. The hydraulic analogy can give a mistaken sense of understanding that will be exposed once a detailed description of electrical circuit theory is required.

One must also consider the difficulties in trying to make an analogy match reality completely.  The above "electrical friction" example, where the hydraulic analog is a pipe filled with sponge material, illustrates the problem: the model must be increased in complexity beyond any realistic scenario.

[[File:Visit of Sakhali college to study on impact of mining on environment and village Community - 03.jpg|thumb|Studying the impact of mining on environment and village community]]
[[File:Pollution de l'air.jpg|thumb|Pollution from a factory]]
'''I = PAT''' is the mathematical notation of a formula put forward to describe the [[human impacts on the environment|impact of human activity on the environment]].

:'''I''' = '''P''' × '''A''' × '''T'''

The expression equates [[Environmental issue|human impact on the environment]] to the [[product (mathematics)|product]] of three [[independent variable|factors]]: [[World population|Population]], [[Affluence]], and [[Technology]]. It is similar in form to the [[Kaya identity]] which applies specifically to emissions of the [[greenhouse gas]] [[carbon dioxide]].

The validity of expressing environmental impact as a simple product of independent factors, and the factors that should be included and their comparative importance, have been the subject of debate among environmentalists. In particular, some have drawn attention to potential inter-relationships among the three factors; and others have wished to stress other factors not included in the formula, such as political and social structures, and the scope for beneficial, as well as harmful, environmental actions.

==History==
The equation was developed in 1970 during the course of a debate between [[Barry Commoner]], [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] and [[John Holdren]]. Commoner argued that [[environmental impact]]s in the United States were caused primarily by changes in its production technology following [[World War II]] and aimed his thoughts on present day deteriorating environmental conditions in the U.S. Ehrlich and Holdren argued that all three factors were important and emphasized in particular the role of human [[population growth]], but focused more on a broader scale, being less specific in space and time.&lt;ref name ="End of Population Growth"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = O'Neill | first1 = B.C. |last2 = MacKellar | first2 = F.L. | first3 = W.| last3= Lutz | date = 2004 | chapter = Population, greenhouse gas emissions, and climate change | title = The End of World Population Growth in the 21st Century: New Challenges for Human Capital Formation &amp; Sustainable Development | editor1-first = W. | editor1-last = Lutz | editor2-first = W.C. | editor2-last= Sanderson | editor3-first= S. | editor3-last = Scherbov | publisher = Earthscan Press | location = London | pages = 283–314}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ehrlich  | first1 = Paul R.  | authorlink1 = Paul R.

The equation can aid in understanding some of the factors affecting human impacts on the environment,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chertow | first1 = M.

Ehrlich|Paul Ehrlich]], [[George Wald]], [[Denis Hayes]], [[Lester R. Brown|Lester Brown]], [[René Dubos]], and [[Sidney Dillon Ripley|Sidney Ripley]] that did not come to pass.&lt;ref name="bailey_2000"&gt;[[Ronald Bailey|R Bailey]] (2000) ''Earth day then and now'', [[Reason (magazine)|Reason]] '''32'''(1), 18-28&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neal Koblitz]] classified equations of this type as "mathematical [[propaganda]]" and criticized Ehrlich's use of them in the media (e.g. on [[The Tonight Show]]) to sway the general public.&lt;ref name="koblitz_1981"&gt;[[Neal Koblitz|N Koblitz]] (1981) "Mathematics as Propaganda", in ''Mathematics Tomorrow'', ed. [[Lynn Steen]], pp 111-120.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The dependent variable: Impact==
&lt;!-- A definition of impact was missing. Added here.  --&gt;

The variable "I" in the "I=PAT" equation represents environmental impact. The environment may be viewed as a self-regenerating system that can sustain a certain level of impact sustainably. The maximum sustainable impact is called the [[carrying capacity]]. As long as "I" is less than this amount the associated population, affluence, and technology that make up "I" are sustainable. If "I" exceeds the carrying capacity, then the system is said to be in [[Overshoot (population)|overshoot]], which can only be a temporary state. Overshoot may degrade the ability of the environment to sustain impact, therefore reducing the carrying capacity.

Impact may be measured using [[ecological footprint]] analysis in units of [[global hectares]] (gha). Ecological footprint per capita is a measure of the quantity of  Earth's biologically productive surface that is needed to regenerate the resources consumed per capita.

Impact is modeled as the product of three terms, giving gha as a result. Population is expressed in human numbers, therefore Affluence is measured in units of gha per capita. Technology is a unitless efficiency  factor.

==The three factors==
===Population===
{{See also|World population|Human overpopulation}}

[[File:Population curve.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|right|Population (est.) 10,000 BC – 2000 AD.]]

In the '''I=PAT''' equation, the variable '''P''' represents the population of an area, such as the world. Since the rise of industrial societies, human population has been increasing exponentially. This has caused [[Thomas Malthus]], [[Paul R. Ehrlich|Paul Ehrlich]] and many others{{Who|date=February 2011}} to postulate that this growth would continue until checked by widespread hunger and famine (see [[Malthusian growth model]]).

The United Nations project that world population will increase from 7.6 billion today (2018) to 9.8 billion in 2050 and about 11.2 billion in 2100.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Publications/Files/WPP2017_KeyFindings.pdf|title=Population Prospects 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These projections take into consideration that population growth has slowed in recent years as women are having fewer children. This phenomenon is the result of [[demographic transition]] all over the world. The UN projects that human population might stabilize around 11.2 billion in 2100 (up from 9.2 billion).&lt;ref name="End of Population Growth"/&gt; However, since the world population is set to keep rising for the next few decades, this factor of the '''I=PAT''' equation will likely keep increasing [[human impact on the environment]] for the near future.

====Environmental impacts of population====
Increased population increases humans' environmental impact in many ways, which include but are not limited to:

* Increased [[land use]] - Results in habitat loss for other species.
* Increased [[resource use]] - Results in changes in land cover
* Increased [[pollution]] - Can cause sickness and damages [[ecosystem]]s.

===Affluence===
{{Main|Consumption (economics)}}

[[File:World GDP Capita 1-2003 A.D.png|thumb|right|upright=1.5|right|World GDP per capita (in 1990 [[Geary-Khamis dollars]])]]

The variable '''A''', in the '''I=PAT''' equation stands for [[affluence]]. It represents the average consumption of each person in the population. As the consumption of each person increases, the total environmental impact increases as well. A common proxy for measuring consumption is through [[GDP per capita]]. While GDP per capita measures production, it is often assumed that consumption increases when production increases.  GDP per capita has been rising steadily over the last few centuries and is driving up human impact in the '''I=PAT''' equation.

====Environmental impacts of affluence====
&lt;!-- Not a great example - needs fleshing out; number of automobiles per capita would be a better example, as it changes, ... --&gt;

Increased consumption significantly increases human environmental impact. This is because each product consumed has wide-ranging effects on the environment. For example, the construction of a car has the following environmental impacts:

* 605,664 gallons of water for parts and tires&lt;ref name ="Phillis"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Andriantiatsaholiniaina | first1 = L. A. | last2 = Kouikoglou | first2 = V. S. | last3 = Phillis | first3 = Y. A. | doi = 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2003.08.009 | title = Evaluating strategies for sustainable development: Fuzzy logic reasoning and sensitivity analysis |journal = [[Ecological Economics (journal)|Ecological Economics]]| volume = 48 | issue = 2 | pages = 149 | year = 2004 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 682&amp;nbsp;lbs. of pollution at a mine for the [[lead battery]].&lt;ref name ="Phillis" /&gt;
* 2178&amp;nbsp;lbs. of discharge into water supply for the 22&amp;nbsp;lbs. of copper contained in the car.&lt;ref name ="Phillis" /&gt;

The more cars per capita, the greater the impact.
Ecological impacts of each product are far reaching, increases in consumption quickly result in large impacts on the environment through direct and indirect sources.

===Technology===
{{See also|Environmental technology|Appropriate technology}}

The '''T''' variable in the '''I=PAT''' equation represents how resource intensive the production of affluence is; how much environmental impact is involved in creating, transporting and disposing of the goods, services and amenities used.  Improvements in efficiency can reduce resource intensiveness, reducing the T multiplier.  Since technology can affect environmental impact in many different ways, the unit for '''T''' is often tailored for the situation '''I=PAT''' is being applied to. For example, for a situation where the human impact on climate change is being measured, an appropriate unit for '''T''' might be greenhouse gas emissions per unit of GDP.

====Environmental impacts of technology====
Increases in efficiency can reduce overall environmental impact. However, since '''P''' has increased exponentially, and '''A''' has also increased drastically, the overall environmental impact, '''I''', has still increased.

==Criticism==
[[File:Native American fishing at Willamette Falls.jpg|thumb|Native American Fishing Practices (Low Technology) have a vastly smaller Impact than Industrialized Fishing]]
Criticisms of the "I=PAT" formula
* Too Simplistic for complex problem
* Inter dependencies between variables
* General sweeping assumptions of variables’ effect toward environmental impact
* Cultural differences cause wide variation in impact
* Technology cannot properly be expressed in a unit. Varying the unit will prove to be inaccurate, as the result of the calculation depends on one’s view of the situation

===Interdependencies===
The I=PAT equation has been criticized for being too simplistic by assuming that P, A, and T are independent of each other. In reality, at least 7 interdependencies between P, A, and T could exist, indicating that it is more correct to rewrite the equation as I = f(P,A,T).&lt;ref name="Alcott, B. 2010"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Alcott | first1 = B. | title = Impact caps: Why population, affluence and technology strategies should be abandoned | doi = 10.1016/j.jclepro.2009.08.001 | journal = [[Journal of Cleaner Production]] | volume = 18 | issue = 6 | pages = 552–560 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a doubling of technological efficiency, or equivalently a reduction of the T-factor by 50%, does not necessarily reduce the environmental impact (I) by 50% if efficiency induced price reductions stimulate additional consumption of the resource that was supposed to be conserved, a phenomenon called the [[rebound effect (conservation)]] or [[Jevons Paradox]].  As was shown by Alcott,&lt;ref name="Alcott, B. 2010" /&gt;{{rp|Fig. 5}} despite significant improvements in the carbon intensity of GDP (i.e., the efficiency in carbon use) since 1980, world fossil energy consumption has increased in line with economic and population growth. Similarly, an extensive historical analysis of technological efficiency improvements has conclusively shown that improvements in the efficiency of energy and material use were almost always outpaced by economic growth, resulting in a net increase in resource use and associated pollution.&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011).

===Neglect of beneficial human impacts===
There have also been comments that this model depicts people as being purely detrimental to the environment, ignoring any [[conservation (ethic)|conservation]] or [[Environmental restoration|restoration]] efforts that societies have made.&lt;ref name=moseley242&gt;{{Cite book |title=An Introduction to Human-Environment Geography: Local Dynamics and Global Processes |last=Moseley |first=William |last2=Perramond |first2=Eric |last3=Hapke |first3=Holly |last4=Laris |first4=Paul |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |year=2014 |isbn=9781405189316 |location=Hoboken, NJ |pages=241–242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neglect of political and social contexts===
Another major criticism of the I=PAT model is that it ignores the political context and decision making structures of countries and groups. This means the equation does not account for varying degrees of power, influence, and responsibility of individuals over environmental impact.&lt;ref name=moseley242/&gt; Also, the P factor does not account for the complexity of social structures or behaviors, resulting in blame being placed on the global poor.&lt;ref name=moseley242/&gt; I=PAT does not account for sustainable resource use among some poor and indigenous populations, unfairly characterizing these populations whose cultures support low impact practices.&lt;ref name=moseley242/&gt; However, the latter criticism not only assumes low impacts for indigenous populations, but also misunderstands the I=PAT equation itself. Environmental impact is a function of human numbers, affluence (ie resources consumed per capita) and technology. It is assumed that small scale societies have low environmental impacts due to their practices and orientations alone but there is little evidence to support this&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Primitive polluters : Semang impact on the Malaysian tropical rain forest ecosystem |last=Rambo |first=A.

In fact the generally low impact of small scale societies compared to state societies is due to a combination of their small numbers and low level technology. Thus, the environmental sustainability of these societies is largely an epiphenomenon due their ''inability'' to significantly affect their environment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Eric Alden|last2=Wishnie|first2=Mark|date=2000|title=Conservation and Subsistence in Small-Scale Societies|url=https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.anthro.29.1.493|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=29|issue=1|pages=493–524|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.29.1.493}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hames|first=Raymond|date=2007|title=The Ecologically Noble Savage Debate|url=https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.anthro.35.081705.123321|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=36|issue=1|pages=177–190 |doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.35.081705.123321}}&lt;/ref&gt;. That all types of societies are subject to I=PAT was actually made clear in Ehrlich and Holdren's 1972 dialogue with Commoner in ''The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists''&lt;ref name=BAS1/&gt; where they examine the pre-industrial (and indeed prehistoric) impact of human beings on the environment. Their position is further clarified by Holdren's 1993 paper, ''A Brief History of "IPAT"''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://mahb.stanford.edu/blog/review-anthrozoology/|title=Paul Ehrlich reviews Tobias and Morrison’s most recent book –“Anthrozoology: Embracing Co-Existence in the Anthropocene” |date=2017-01-31|work=MAHB|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Policy implications===
As a result of the interdependencies between P, A, and T and potential rebound effects, policies aimed at decreasing environmental impacts through reductions in P, A, and T may not only be very difficult to implement (e.g., [[population control]] and material sufficiency and [[degrowth]] movements have been very controversial) but also are likely to be rather ineffective compared to rationing (i.e., quotas) or [[Pigovian tax|Pigouvian taxation]] of resource use or pollution.&lt;ref name="Alcott, B. 2010"/&gt;

'''Indefinite Monism''' is a philosophical conception of [[reality]] that asserts that only [[Awareness]] is real and that the wholeness of [[Reality]] can be conceptually thought of in terms of [[immanent]] and [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] aspects.  The immanent aspect is denominated simply as [[Awareness]], while the [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] aspect is  referred to as ''Omnific Awareness''.  

[[Awareness]] in this system is not equivalent to [[consciousness]].  Rather, Awareness is the venue for consciousness, and the transcendent aspect of [[Reality]], ''Omnific Awareness'', is what [[consciousness]] is of.  

In this system, what is real is distinguished from that which exists by showing that everything that we are conscious of exists but is not real since it is contingent upon awareness for its existence.  Awareness is the source of its own energetic display -- its omneity.  Rather than leading to a solipsistic account of reality, it is claimed through an analysis of consciousness that it is an error on our part to conceive of individuated awareness.  That error being found in a conflation of the objects of consciousness with the subject of consciousness within an assumed form of reality of separate physical things.  Proceeding from the one [[logical truth|necessarily true]] and unquestionable fact – that we are present to our experiences – an understanding of reality is developed that is neither a [[materialist]] nor an [[idealist]] conceptualization.  This way of viewing the world is referred to as [[surjective]], a metaphorical use of a concept found in mathematical set theory that means a function that works upon every member of a set, where Awareness is the function and ''Omnific Awareness'' is the set, in order to distinguish this position from both subjectivity and objectivity.

Within this system anything whatsoever can arise from ''Omnific Awareness'', thus the use of the term “indefinite” in labeling this monism.  What does arise as the existents that we are conscious of is conditioned by the affections of Awareness for its display.  Thus this system does away with the idea of an active, creative force called Free Will and replaces it with an active volitional component known as affections, that does not itself create anything, whether movement or structure, but instead, constrains the possibilities of what arises naturally.  Arguably, the concept of [[Free Will]] necessitates a world of separation as it implies an actor and that which is acted upon.  In this conception there is no such separation.  Yet our intuitive modeling of the existents of reality as arising from natural processes, as well as our intuitive understanding that we can ‘cause’ things to happen by our ‘will’, are both cleanly supported.

The distinction between physical phenomena and mental phenomena is also removed by this system.  ''Omnific Awareness'' gives rise to everything – thus the use of the term ''omnific'' – and this includes thoughts that phenomenally arise in brains as well as existents that arise phenomenally as things in the world.  By removing this distinction this system cuts off the inevitable paradoxes that otherwise arise in philosophical systems.  The implications of this move create a number of novel, but necessary, modifications in current categorizations of ideas about reality and our study of it.  For instance, [[ontology]] – the study of being – is necessitated by the assumption of a physical world of separate things, but when viewed surjectively ontology collapses into [[epistemology]] – the study of the methods or grounds of knowledge.  Similarly, by removing the distinction between mental and physical phenomena the tensions created in dualist understandings of reality of how the mental and physical interact with one another are dispelled.  Surprisingly, the removal of this distinction also completely removes the need for claims of metaphysical realms of being or metaphysical processes, thus collapsing all of reality into this reality.

The implications of this view of Reality are carried as far as [[ethics]], where the lack of separation between Awareness and that which it gives rise to necessitate a far-reaching adjustment in our ethical beliefs.  One such difference that is highlighted for instance is that all conscious beings, which are called “knowings” in deference to this new conception of reality, are qualitatively the same; thus our current distinction between “human beings” and “animals” is based upon a [[false dichotomy]], and this new understanding will necessitate an adjustment in our ideas of who or what can be “property” and who or what can be a “person.”

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6662">In [[mathematics]], especially in the field of [[category theory]], the concept of '''injective object''' is a generalization of the concept of [[injective module]]. This concept is important in [[cohomology]], in [[homotopy theory]] and in the theory of [[model category|model categories]]. The dual notion is that of a [[projective object]].

==Definition==
[[File:Diagrammadefinizionemoduloiniettivo.png|thumb|An object {{var|Q}} is injective if, given a monomorphism {{var|f}} : {{var|X}} → {{var|Y}}, any {{var|g}} : {{var|X}} → {{var|Q}} can be extended to {{var|Y}}.]]

An object &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; in the category &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{C}&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''injective''' if for every [[monomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;f: X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; and every morphism &lt;math&gt;g: X \to Q&lt;/math&gt; there exists a morphism &lt;math&gt;h: Y \to Q&lt;/math&gt; extending &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. such that &lt;math&gt; h \circ f = g&lt;/math&gt;.

The morphism &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; in the above definition is not required to be uniquely determined by &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;.

In a locally small category, it is equivalent to require that the [[hom functor]] &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathfrak{C}}(-,Q)&lt;/math&gt; carries monomorphisms in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{C}&lt;/math&gt; to surjective set maps.

==In Abelian categories==
The notion of injectivity was first formulated for [[Abelian category|abelian categories]], and this is still one of its primary areas of application. When &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt; is an abelian category, an object ''Q'' of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt; is injective [[if and only if]] its [[hom functor]] Hom&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;(&amp;ndash;,''Q'') is [[exact functor|exact]].

If
:&lt;math&gt;0 \to Q \to U \to V \to 0&lt;/math&gt;
is an [[exact sequence]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt; such that ''Q'' is injective, then the [[splitting lemma|sequence splits]].

==Enough injectives and injective hulls==
The category &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{C}&lt;/math&gt; is said to ''have enough injectives'' if for every object ''X'' of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{C}&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a monomorphism from ''X'' to an injective object. 

A monomorphism ''g'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{C}&lt;/math&gt; is called an [[essential monomorphism]] if for any morphism ''f'', the composite ''fg'' is a monomorphism only if ''f'' is a monomorphism.

If ''g'' is an essential monomorphism with domain ''X'' and an injective codomain ''G'', then ''G'' is called an '''injective hull''' of ''X''.  The injective hull is then uniquely determined by ''X'' [[up to]] a non-canonical isomorphism.

==Examples==
*In the category of [[Abelian group]]s and [[group homomorphism]]s, an injective object is necessarily a [[divisible group]]. Assuming the axiom of choice, the notions are equivalent.
*In the category of [[Module (mathematics)|modules]] and [[module homomorphism]]s, ''R''-Mod, an injective object is an [[injective module]]. ''R''-Mod has [[injective hull]]s (as a consequence, R-Mod has enough injectives).
*In the category of [[metric space]]s and [[nonexpansive mapping]]s, [[Category of metric spaces|Met]], an injective object is an [[injective metric space]], and the injective hull of a metric space is its [[tight span]].
*In the category of [[T0 space]]s and [[continuous mapping]]s, an injective object is always a [[Scott topology]] on a [[continuous lattice]] therefore it is always [[Sober space|sober]] and [[locally compact]].

==Uses==
If an abelian category has enough injectives, we can form [[Injective resolution|injective resolutions]], i.e. for a given object ''X'' we can form a long exact sequence
:&lt;math&gt;0\to X \to Q^0 \to Q^1 \to Q^2 \to \cdots&lt;/math&gt;
and one can then define the [[derived functor]]s of a given functor ''F'' by applying ''F'' to this sequence and computing the homology of the resulting (not necessarily exact) sequence. This approach is used to define [[Ext functor|Ext]] and [[Tor functor|Tor]] functors and also the various [[cohomology]] theories in [[group theory]], [[algebraic topology]] and [[algebraic geometry]]. The categories being used are typically [[functor category|functor categories]] or categories of [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]] of [[sheaf of modules|O&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; modules]] over some [[ringed space]] (''X'',O&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;) or in general any [[Grothendieck category]].

== Generalization ==
[[File:Injective object.svg|thumb|An object {{var|Q}} is {{var|H}}-injective if, given {{var|h}} : {{var|A}} → {{var|B}} in {{var|H}}, any {{var|f}} : {{var|A}} → {{var|Q}} [[List of mathematical jargon#factor through|factors through]] {{var|h}}.]]

Let  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{C}&lt;/math&gt; be a category and let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Class (set theory)|class]] of [[Morphism|morphisms]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{C}&lt;/math&gt;.

An object &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{C}&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;''-injective''' if for every morphism &lt;math&gt;f: A \to Q&lt;/math&gt; and every morphism &lt;math&gt;h: A \to B&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; there exists a morphism &lt;math&gt;g: B \to Q&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; g \circ h = f&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; is the class of [[monomorphism]]s, we are back to the injective objects that were treated above.

The category &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{C}&lt;/math&gt; is said to ''have enough &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;-injectives'' if for every object ''X'' of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{C}&lt;/math&gt;, there exist a ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;''-morphism from ''X'' to an ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;''-injective object.

A ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;''-morphism ''g'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{C}&lt;/math&gt; is called '''''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;''-essential''' if for any morphism ''f'', the composite ''fg'' is in ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;'' only if ''f'' is in ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;''.

If ''g'' is a ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;''-essential morphism with domain ''X'' and an ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;''-injective codomain ''G'', then ''G'' is called an '''''H''-injective hull''' of ''X''. 

=== Examples ===

*In the category of [[simplicial set]]s, the injective objects with respect to the class ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;'' of [[anodyne extension]]s are [[Kan complex]]es.
*In the category of partially ordered sets and monotonic functions, the [[complete lattice]]s form the injective objects for the class ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;'' of [[order-embedding]]s, and the [[Dedekind–MacNeille completion]] of a partially ordered set is its ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;''-injective hull.

'''Interactive street theatre''' is a combination of [[street theatre]] and [[interactive art]].
There are different kinds of interactive street theatre. The biggest difference between “normal interactive art” and "interactive street theatre" is that the presentation. 
The presentation of is always outside in a public place and most of the time on a festival. The audience are people how just walk by and stop and participate. You can participate but if you don’t want you can just watch. It is temporary, only a few hours. And it is easier to participate than in a gallery or a museum. People who might not have ever to a theatre or museum can now participate in an interactive street theatre.

Some interactive art installations visitor can "walk" in, on, and around them. And to “play” with the object of the installations. Another form is that spectators themselves become part of the artwork. And a third option is that spectator become active and work to gather to great a collective art piece.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1965">In [[mathematics]], an '''interleave sequence''' is obtained by merging two [[sequence]]s via an [[in shuffle]].

Let &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Set (mathematics)|set]], and let  &lt;math&gt;(x_i)&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;(y_i)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;i=0,1,2,\ldots,&lt;/math&gt; be two [[sequence]]s in &lt;math&gt;S.&lt;/math&gt; The interleave sequence is defined to be the sequence  &lt;math&gt;x_0, y_0, x_1, y_1, \dots.&lt;/math&gt; Formally, it is the sequence  &lt;math&gt;(z_i), i=0,1,2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; given by

:&lt;math&gt; z_i := \begin{cases} x_{i/2} &amp; \text{ if } i \text{ is even,} \\
 y_{(i-1)/2} &amp; \text{ if } i \text{ is odd.}  \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

==Properties==
* The interleave sequence &lt;math&gt;(z_i)&lt;/math&gt; is [[limit of a sequence|convergent]] [[if and only if]] the sequences &lt;math&gt;(x_i)&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;(y_i)&lt;/math&gt; are convergent and have the same limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Way of Analysis|first=Robert S.|last=Strichartz|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|year=2000|isbn=9780763714970|page=78|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yix09oVvI1IC&amp;pg=PA78}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Consider two [[real number]]s ''a'' and ''b'' greater than zero and smaller than 1. One can interleave the sequences of digits of ''a''  and ''b'', which will determine a third number ''c'', also greater than zero and smaller than 1. In this way one obtains an [[Injective function|injection]] from the square (0, 1)&amp;times;(0, 1) to the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] (0, 1). Different radixes give rise to different injections; the one for the binary numbers is called the [[Z-order curve]] or Morton code.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Spatial Data Management|volume=21|series=Synthesis lectures on data management|first=Nikos|last=Mamoulis|publisher=Morgan &amp; Claypool Publishers|year=2012|isbn=9781608458325|pages=22–23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6z5grzUcPhoC&amp;pg=PA22}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Knicks–Nuggets brawl''' was an on-court altercation at a [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) game between the [[New York Knicks]] and [[Denver Nuggets]] at [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City]] on Saturday, December 16, 2006. This altercation became the most penalized on-court fight in the NBA since the [[Pacers–Pistons brawl]] from two years before.

The fight began with a [[flagrant foul]] by Knicks [[shooting guard|guard]] [[Mardy Collins]] on Nuggets guard [[J. R. Smith]] in the closing seconds of the game. Several players joined in the confrontation, and began to make physical contact. The fight briefly spilled into the stands, and also stretched to the other end of the court. All ten players on the floor at the time were ejected after the altercation was finished. When suspensions were announced, seven [[List of players banned or suspended by the NBA|players were suspended]] without pay for a combined total of 47 games.

Although they were not penalized, Nuggets coach [[George Karl]] and Knicks coach [[Isiah Thomas]] were both scrutinized for their part in the brawl. [[Carmelo Anthony]] was also criticized for harming his image as a star, and several writers said the league had penalized the players excessively because it wanted to keep its image free from violence.

==Game recap==
Entering the game, the New York Knicks had a record of 9–17 while the Denver Nuggets sported a 13–9 record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/teams/schedule?team=nyk&amp;year=2007 |title=New York Knicks Schedule - 2006-07 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2009-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/teams/schedule?team=den&amp;year=2007 |title=Denver Nuggets Schedule - 2006-07 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2009-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite trailing the entire game, the Knicks came as close as 2 points in the first half but the Nuggets regrouped and closed the half with a 13-point advantage and continued to lead in the second half by as much as 26 points in the third quarter. The Knicks briefly came within 10 points with ten minutes left in the game, but the Nuggets went on a 12–2 run and were never threatened again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/playbyplay?gameId=261216018 |title=Denver Nuggets vs. New York Knicks - Play By Play - December 16, 2006 |date=December 16, 2006 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2009-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carmelo Anthony scored 24 [[point (basketball)|points]] to lead the Nuggets, and [[Marcus Camby]] added 24 points and 9 [[rebound (basketball)|rebounds]]; [[Stephon Marbury]] scored a season-high 31 points for the Knicks.&lt;ref name="espnrecap" /&gt;

===Altercation===
The incident occurred with 1:15 remaining in the Knicks' home game at [[Madison Square Garden]], where the Nuggets were leading 119–100. The Knicks' [[Mardy Collins]] fouled the Nuggets' [[J. R. Smith]] on a [[fast break]] by slapping his arms around Smith's neck, knocking him to the floor. As Smith stood up to confront Collins, [[Nate Robinson]] pulled  Smith away, and then began pushing and shouting at him. [[David Lee (basketball)|David Lee]] tried to hold Smith back, but Smith broke free and charged into Robinson, causing both players to fall into the photographers and front row courtside seats, before they were quickly separated by teammates.&lt;ref name="espnrecap"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=261216018 |title=Nuggets, Knicks in wild free-for-all; 10 players tossed |date=December 16, 2006 |publisher=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=2009-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the fighting was seemingly coming to an end, [[Carmelo Anthony]] confronted Collins and punched him in the face, knocking him to the ground. [[Jared Jeffries]] immediately tried to attack Anthony but tripped over [[Marcus Camby]], before being restrained by coaches and teammates, while Anthony backed up towards the Nuggets' bench. Collins also ran down the court to get at Anthony but was blocked by [[Nenê]] and Smith. All ten players on the court at the time of the incident were ejected by the officiating crew that consisted of [[Dick Bavetta]], [[Violet Palmer]], and [[Robbie Robinson (referee)|Robbie Robinson]].&lt;ref name="espnrecap"/&gt; No fans came onto the court during the entire ordeal, which prevented any repetition of the [[Pacers–Pistons brawl]] from 2 years ago.

NBA commissioner [[David Stern]] reacted with strict penalties for the players involved, stating, "It is our obligation to take the strongest possible steps to avoid such failures in the future." Seven players were suspended for a total of 47 games, and the players lost in excess of $1.2 million in salary. Each team was also fined $500,000.&lt;ref name="suspensions"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nba.com/news/Nuggets_Knicks_Suspensions.html |title=Nuggets-Knicks Suspensions |date=December 18, 2006 |publisher=NBA.com |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2701228 |title=Suspensions total 47 games from Knicks-Nuggets fight |date=December 20, 2006 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Anthony's suspension was longer than 12 games, he was eligible to appeal to an arbitrator; however, Anthony eventually announced he would not attempt one, saying he did not "want to be a further distraction".&lt;ref name="wontappeal"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2704934 |title=Anthony doesn't want to be distraction, won't appeal |last=Stein |first=Marc |date=December 22, 2006 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2009-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public reaction===
Several sportswriters said the brawl was not as violent as the [[Pacers–Pistons brawl]] two years before,&lt;ref name="plentyblame" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/basketball/296541_miller20.html |title=Brawl fell far short of all the outrage |last=Miller |first=Ted |date=December 20, 2006 |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 81% of respondents in a [[SportsNation (Website)|SportsNation]] poll said the biggest difference between the two brawls was that it "didn't involve players going into the stands and fighting fans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://proxy.espn.go.com/chat/sportsnation/polling?event_id=2642&amp;action=1 |title=Vote: How long should 'Melo and Isiah be suspended? |date=December 17, 2006 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[MSNBC]]'s Michael Ventre said that the Knicks and Nuggets brawl was worse because "it was touched off by the actions of players, and it escalated because of them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/16254683/ |title=Two years later, a brawl that's worse |last=Ventre |first=Michael |date=December 18, 2006 |publisher=NBC Sports |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several writers said that the penalties were more severe because of the Pacers–Pistons brawl, because the league was on a "very serious image-cleanup campaign."&lt;ref name="hittinimage" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rockylow" /&gt;

[[Steve Francis]] claimed that the media reaction to the fight and the suspensions itself were "racially motivated." He argued that [[Major League Baseball]] and the [[National Hockey League]] had "incidents that are way worse than basketball," but did not face the scrutiny that the NBA received "because there are more black players in the NBA."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/12192006/sports/knicks/knicks_francis__race_a_factor_knicks_dan_martin_and_marc_berman.htm |title=Knicks' Francis: Race a Factor |last=Martin |first=Dan |author2=Berman, Marc |date=December 19, 2006 |work=New York Post |accessdate=2009-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430094141/http://www.nypost.com/seven/12192006/sports/knicks/knicks_francis__race_a_factor_knicks_dan_martin_and_marc_berman.htm |archivedate=April 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was echoed by several writers, and sportswriter-television personality [[Michael Wilbon]] said that "NBA players have endured more scrutiny, pertaining to image, than any other professional athletes in America."&lt;ref name="plentyblame"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/16245553/ |title=Plenty of blame to go around for this brawl |last=Celizic |first=Mike |date=December 18, 2006 |publisher=NBA Sports |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hittinimage" /&gt; [[Martin Luther King III]] called for a meeting to end the violence in the NBA, stating, "Individuals who play a game should be able to conduct themselves appropriately." However, the NBA said through a [[spokesman]] that they "don't think that meeting is necessary."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601079&amp;sid=aNleXFcZzNb0&amp;refer=home |title=NBA Referees Invite League, Players to Meet on Fight |last=DiTore |first=Larry |date=December 19, 2006 |publisher=Bloomberg |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coaches' role in the brawl===
[[Image:Isiah Thomas.jpg|thumb|upright|Thomas came under scrutiny for his actions before the brawl.]]
Minutes before the brawl started, Knicks coach [[Isiah Thomas]] asked Carmelo Anthony not to go into the painted area around the basket, despite the fact that they were not members of the same team. Thomas later said that because Denver head coach [[George Karl]] kept his team's [[starting lineup|starting players]] on the court for the closing minutes of the game, which Thomas thought showed a lack of [[sportsmanship]], his orders to Anthony were to "show some class."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2700761 |title=Melo apologizes; Isiah reportedly under investigation |date=December 20, 2006 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2009-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Karl responded by saying the brawl "was directed by Isiah".&lt;ref name="thomasescape"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/business/manufacturing/feeds/ap/2006/12/18/ap3265869.html  |title=Column: Thomas Escapes Hands of Stern |last=Dahlberg |first=Tim |date=December 18, 2006 |publisher=[[Forbes]] |accessdate=2009-04-06 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070108091047/http://www.forbes.com/business/manufacturing/feeds/ap/2006/12/18/ap3265869.html |archivedate = 2007-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas was not penalized after the brawl, as an NBA investigation ruled that they did not have "adequate evidence upon which to make a determination,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/19/sports/basketball/19isiah.html?fta=y |title=Lack of Evidence Lets Thomas Avoid Punishment |last=Beck |first=Howard |date=December 19, 2006 |work=New York Times |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; but several writers criticized the NBA for not including Thomas in the suspensions.&lt;ref name="hittinimage"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/18/AR2006121801403.html |first=Michael |last=Wilbon |title=A Hittin' Image |date=December 19, 2006 |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=2009-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thomasescape"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bigculprit"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16269796 |title=Stern let biggest culprit in brawl off easy: Isiah |last=Celizic |first=Mike |date=December 18, 2006 |publisher=MSNBC |accessdate=2009-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/481112p-404847c.html  |title=Blame Isiah for brawl |last=Lupica |first=Mike |date=December 18, 2006 |work=New York Daily News |accessdate=2009-04-04 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061222192642/http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/481112p-404847c.html |archivedate = 2006-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sheridan |first=Chris |url=http://insider.espn.go.com/nba/insider/columns/story?columnist=sheridan_chris&amp;id=2701751 |title=Not so Stern: Commish lets Isiah off the hook |date=December 19, 2006 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2009-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; ESPN analyst [[Marc Stein (reporter)|Marc Stein]] called Thomas' explanations of his comments "laughable,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/columns/story?columnist=stein_marc&amp;page=brawlquestions |title=Questions answered: Stern, Melo, Isiah and the brawl |last=Stein |first=Marc |date=December 19, 2006 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commentator [[Greg Anthony]], a former Knicks player, said he "never had a coach say that to an opponent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/12202006/sports/knicks/not_so_tough_knicks_marc_berman.htm |title=Not so Tough |last=Berman |first=Marc |date=December 20, 2006 |work=New York Post |accessdate=2009-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226171845/http://www.nypost.com/seven/12202006/sports/knicks/not_so_tough_knicks_marc_berman.htm |archivedate=December 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also suggested that Thomas was attempting to resurrect the physical tactics of his former team, the [[Detroit Pistons#1980s|"Bad Boy" Pistons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116654838756654633 |title=Thomas May Be Only Winner In Wake of NBA's Latest Fight |last=Bialik |first=Carl |author2=Fry, Jason  |date=December 19, 2006 |work=[[Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601039&amp;refer=columnist_soshnick&amp;sid=ap_76o7iBlVg |title=Thomas Has Knicks Fighting Phantoms |last=Soshnick |first=Scott |date=December 18, 2006 |publisher=[[Bloomberg News]] |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Thomas saying that keeping the Nuggets starters on the floor in the final minutes of the game was unsportsmanlike, Karl said that he "never thought about running up the score," and only wanted to "get a big win on the road."&lt;ref name="karlescapes" /&gt; However, several sportswriters criticized his decision, and some said that he should also have been penalized.&lt;ref name="karlescapes"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/19/sports/basketball/19araton.html?fta=y |title=As Thomas Takes Heat, Karl Escapes Scrutiny |last=Araton |first=Harvey |date=December 19, 2006 |work=New York Times |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="earnedban"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/12182006/sports/knicks/nuggets_karl_also_earned_ban_knicks_peter_vecsey.htm |title=Nuggets' Karl also earned ban |last=Vecsey |first=Peter |date=December 18, 2006 |work=New York Post |accessdate=2009-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929122038/http://www.nypost.com/seven/12182006/sports/knicks/nuggets_karl_also_earned_ban_knicks_peter_vecsey.htm |archivedate=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sternreality"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/sports/articles/2006/12/19/the_stern_reality____7_players_suspended/ |title=The Stern reality -- 7 players suspended |last=May |first=Peter |date=December 19, 2006 |work=Boston Globe |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also suggested that Karl was trying to humiliate Thomas due to the perception that Thomas had mistreated [[Larry Brown (basketball)|Larry Brown]], a friend of Karl's.&lt;ref name="bigculprit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="earnedban" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sternreality" /&gt; Karl was also blamed for putting his players in a position to start a fight.&lt;ref name="plentyblame" /&gt;&lt;ref name="earnedban" /&gt;

===Carmelo Anthony===
The day following the brawl, Anthony issued a statement and apology to his family, the league, and fans. He also specifically apologized to Mardy Collins, whom he directly struck during the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nba.com/nuggets/news/anthony_statement_061217.html |title=Statement from Carmelo Anthony |date=December 17, 2006 |publisher=NBA.com |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the brawl, Anthony was the league's leading scorer;&lt;ref name="rockylow" /&gt; his suspension was also the longest of the players suspended, and the sixth-longest in NBA history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/nba/2006-12-18-brawl-suspensions_x.htm |title=NBA hands out penalties — Anthony suspended 15 games |last=Nance |first=Roscoe |date=December 19, 2006 |work=USA Today |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to former NBA player [[Steve Kerr]], Anthony had "tarnished" his image,&lt;ref name="rockylow"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/news?slug=sk-carmelo121806&amp;prov=yhoo&amp;type=lgns |title=Rocky Mountain low |last=Kerr |first=Steve |date=December 18, 2006 |publisher=Yahoo Sports |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and basketball analyst [[Ric Bucher]] said that Anthony had "torched his own career".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/columns/story?columnist=stein_marc&amp;page=bucherfightview |title=Melo's walking a dangerous line again |last=Bucher |first=Ric |date=December 19, 2006 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sports Illustrated]] writer Marty Burns said that Anthony faced becoming known by sports fans across America as the player who punched Collins in the face and then ran away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/writers/marty_burns/12/17/brawl.knicks.nuggets/ |title='Melo drama |last=Burns |first=Marty |date=December 17, 2006 |publisher=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of the backlash was [[Northwest Airlines]] pulling Anthony from its in-flight magazine cover, as it said it did not want "to condone the behavior of Anthony".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2703887 |title=Airline doesn't want to condone brawl, pulls feature |date=December 20, 2006 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events after the brawl==
A day after Anthony was suspended, Denver acquired [[Allen Iverson]], who was then second in the league in scoring behind Anthony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2702501 |title=Miller, Smith go to Sixers in deal for Iverson |date=December 20, 2006 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Anthony and Smith returned from their suspensions, the trio led the Nuggets to 45 wins and the sixth seed in the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] for the [[2007 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]].&lt;ref name="standings"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/standings?season=2007 |title=NBA Standings - 2006-2007 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2009-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they were eliminated in the first round by the [[San Antonio Spurs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/DEN/2007.html |title=2006-07 Denver Nuggets Roster and Statistics |publisher=Sports Reference LLC |accessdate=2009-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Knicks finished 33–49, 12th in the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]], and did not make the playoffs.&lt;ref name="standings"/&gt;

The two teams faced each other for the first time since the altercation on November 17, 2007, which the Nuggets won 115–83. Opposing players [[Renaldo Balkman]] and [[Linas Kleiza]] began arguing with each other after Balkman was called for a hard foul on Kleiza, but the incident was defused after Balkman was given a [[technical foul]]. Iverson, Anthony, and [[Marcus Camby]] were all removed early in the fourth quarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=271117007 |title=Melo scores 24, Iverson adds 23 as Nuggets roll Knicks in Randolph's return |date=November 17, 2007 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2009-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balkman and Kleiza later became teammates&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.basketballreference.com/teams/teamyear.htm?tm=DEN&amp;lg=n&amp;yr=2008 Denver Nuggets (1976 - ) 2008 Stats, History, Awards and More]&lt;/ref&gt; after Balkman was traded to the Nuggets in the 2008 off-season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3508429 Nuggets acquire Knicks' Balkman in trade package - NBA - ESPN]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the [[2010–11 NBA season|2010–11 season]], of the seven suspended players, three were still with their respective teams. [[Mardy Collins]] was traded to the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nba.com/clippers/news/zrandolph_collins_081121.html |title=Clippers Acquire Zach Randolph and Mardy Collins From Knicks |date=November 21, 2008 |publisher=NBA |accessdate=2009-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jerome James]] was traded to the [[Chicago Bulls]] a year later, but never played for the Bulls as he suffered a torn Achilles tendon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3919012 |title=Knicks trade for Bulls' Hughes |date=February 19, 2009 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2009-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeffries and Robinson were traded at the 2010 trade deadline to the [[Houston Rockets]] and [[Boston Celtics]], respectively. Robinson then signed a multi-year deal with the Denver Nuggets on July 26, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nba.com/nuggets/news/denver-nuggets-sign-free-agent-guard-nate-robinson |title= Denver Nuggets Sign Free-Agent Guard Nate Robinson |date=July 26, 2013 |publisher=NBA |accessdate=2013-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carmelo Anthony]] was traded to the Knicks before the 2011 trade deadline. Meanwhile, Jeffries' contract was bought out by the Rockets and he rejoined the Knicks. In addition, [[J.R. Smith]] was signed by the Knicks in February of the 2012 season, which will make him the second former Nugget involved in the brawl to join the Knicks. Though not directly involved in the brawl, 2006 Nuggets C/PF [[Marcus Camby]] also joined the Knicks during the 2012 off-season, making him the third 2006 Nugget to join the Knicks for the 2012-2013 season.  Also not directly involved in the brawl, PF [[Kenyon Martin]] joined the Knicks on February 21, 2013 (initially on a 10-day contract), making him the 4th member of the 2012-2013 Knicks to have been on the '06 Nuggets team.

A launch period refers to the days that the rocket can launch to reach its intended orbit. A mission could have a period of 365 days in a year, a few weeks each month,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) Launch Press Kit|url=https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/582116main_GRAIL_launch_press_kit.pdf|publisher=NASA JPL|accessdate=3 May 2018|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a few weeks every 26 months (e.g. Mars launch periods),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA Targets May 2018 Launch of Mars InSight Mission|url=https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-targets-may-2018-launch-of-mars-insight-mission|publisher=NASA|accessdate=3 May 2018|date=March 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a short period time that won't be repeated.

A launch window indicates the time frame on a given day in the launch period that the rocket can launch to reach its intended orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Launch Schedule 101|url=https://www.nasa.gov/missions/highlights/schedule101.html|website=Missions|publisher=NASA|accessdate=3 May 2018|date=March 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aiming for an Open Window|url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/launchingrockets/launchwindows.html|website=Kennedy Space Center|publisher=NASA|accessdate=3 May 2018|date=February 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be as short as a second (referred to as an instantaneous window) or even the entire day. For operational reasons, the window almost always is limited to no more than a few hours. The launch window can stretch over two calendar days (ex: start at 11:46 p.m. and end at 12:14 a.m.). Launch windows are rarely the exact same times each day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dawn Launch Mission to Vesta and Ceres Press Kit|url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/press_kits/dawn-launch.pdf|publisher=NASA JPL|accessdate=3 May 2018|date=September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Launch windows and launch periods are often used interchangeably in the public sphere, even within the same organization. However, these definitions are the ones used by NASA (and other space agency) launch directors and trajectory analysts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Launch Vehicle Facts|url=https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/mission/launch-vehicle/|website=Mars InSight Press Kit|publisher=NASA JPL|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Launch Time and Window, H-IIA F37 (with upgraded function) Encapsulating SHIKISAI and TSUBAME|url=http://global.jaxa.jp/press/2017/12/20171221_h2af37.html|website=JAXA Press Releases|publisher=Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA)|accessdate=3 May 2018|date=December 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Launch Period==

To go to another planet using the simple low-energy [[Hohmann transfer orbit]], if [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of orbits is not a factor, launch periods are periodic according to the [[synodic period]]; for example, in the case of Mars, the period is 2.135 years, (780 days). In more complex cases, including the use of [[gravitational slingshot]]s, launch windows are irregular. Sometimes rare opportunities arise, such as when ''[[Voyager 2]]'' took advantage of a 175-year planetary alignment (launch window) to visit [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], and [[Neptune]].  When such an opportunity is missed, another target may be selected. For example, the [[European Space Agency|ESA]]'s ''[[Rosetta (spacecraft)|Rosetta]]'' mission was originally intended for comet [[46P/Wirtanen]], but a launcher problem delayed it and a new target had to be selected (comet [[67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko]]).

Launch periods are often calculated from [[porkchop plot]]s, which  show the [[delta-v]] needed to achieve the mission plotted against the launch time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Porkchop" is the First Menu Item on a Trip to Mars|url=https://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/spotlight/porkchopAll.html|website=NASA's Mars Exploration Program|publisher=NASA JPL|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Launch Window==
The launch window is defined by the first launch point and ending launch point. It may be continuous (i.e. able to launch every second in the launch window) or may be a collection of discrete instantaneous points between the open and close&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Detailed Launch Window|url=https://marsmobile.jpl.nasa.gov/mer/mission/timeline/launch/launch-window/|website=Mars Exploration Rovers Press Kit|publisher=NASA JPL|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Launch windows and days are usually calculated in UTC and then converted to the local time of where the rocket and spacecraft operators are located (frequently multiple time zones for USA launches).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Launch Windows|url=https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/mission/timeline/launch/launch-windows/|website=Mars InSight Press Kit|publisher=NASA JPL|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For trips into largely arbitrary [[Earth orbit]]s, no specific launch time is required. But if the spacecraft intends to [[space rendezvous|rendezvous]] with an object already in orbit, the launch must be carefully timed to occur around the times that the target vehicle's [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]] intersects the launch site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GETTING READY FOR LAUNCH|url=https://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Getting_ready_for_launch/(print)|publisher=European Space Agency|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Earth observation satellite]]s are often launched into [[sun-synchronous orbit]]s which are [[Polar orbit|near-polar]]. For these orbits, the launch window occurs at the time of day when the launch site location is aligned with the plane of the required orbit. To launch at another time would require an orbital plane change [[Orbital maneuver|maneuver]] which would require a large amount of propellant.

For launches above [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO), the actual launch time can be somewhat flexible if a [[parking orbit]] is used, because the inclination and time the spacecraft initially spends in the parking orbit can be varied. See the launch window used by the ''[[Mars Global Surveyor]]'' spacecraft to the planet [[Mars]] at [http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mgs/overvu/delta/window/window.html].

==Specific issues==
[[Space Shuttle]] missions to the [[International Space Station]] were restricted by [[beta angle]] cutout. Beta angle (&lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;) is defined as the angle between the orbit plane and the vector from the Sun.&lt;ref name="knk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tak2000.com/data/planets/earth.htm|title=  Earth's Thermal Environment|last=K&amp;K Associates|year=2008|work=Thermal Environments JPL D-8160|publisher=K&amp;K Associates|accessdate=June 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the relationship between an orbiting object's beta angle (in this case, the ISS) and the percent of its orbit that is spent in sunlight, solar power generation and thermal control are affected by that beta angle.&lt;ref name="mcc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/feedback/expert/answer/mcc/sts-113/11_23_20_01_179.html|title=MCC Answers|author=Derek Hassman, NASA Flight Director|date=December 1, 2002|publisher=NASA|accessdate=June 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shuttle launches to the ISS were normally attempted only when the ISS was in an orbit with a beta angle of less than 60 degrees.&lt;ref name="mcc"/&gt;

'''''Le Beurre et l'argent du beurre ''''' is a 2007 documentary film directed by [[Alidou Badini]] and [[Philippe Baqué]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fipa.tm.fr/en/programs/2008/le-beurre-et-l-argent-du-beurre-16779.htm|title=Le Beurre et l'argent du beurre|publisher=FIPA|accessdate=9 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120816231020/http://www.fipa.tm.fr/en/programs/2008/le-beurre-et-l-argent-du-beurre-16779.htm|archivedate=16 August 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title, which translates to "Butter and the money from butter", derives from a [[French language|French]] idiom equivalent to the English phrase "[[Have one's cake and eat it too]]".

== Synopsis ==
Fair trading is very much in fashion today. The concept is to help the most underprivileged populations on our planet to emerge from this state thanks to a fairer distribution of revenues. The [[Shea nut and butter production in Burkina Faso|Shea butter]] is produced by the poorest women of [[Burkina Faso]], and is more and more appreciated in Europe. It is used in the cosmetic industry and as a cocoa substitute.  Various fair trading experiences claim to help them but, who really profits from the money of the butter?&lt;ref name=voir&gt;{{cite web|title=BEURRE ET L’ARGENT DU BEURRE (LE)|url=http://voiretagir.org/BEURRE-ET-L-ARGENT-DU-BEURRE-LE.html|work=Voir et agir|accessdate=11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Utopia&gt;{{cite web|title=Le Beurre et l'argent du beurre|url=http://www.atelierideal.lautre.net/IMG/pdf/chronique-utopia-LeBeurre.pdf|publisher=Cinema Utopia|accessdate=11 March 2012|location=Bordeaux, France}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IntNews&gt;{{cite news|title=Commerce "équitable": le beurre et l'argent du beurre (docu)|url=http://internationalnews.over-blog.com/article-31826072.html|accessdate=11 March 2012|newspaper=International News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="112723">This section of the [[list of rampage killers]] contains those cases that either occurred mostly within a single household, or where most of the victims were members of a single family not related to the perpetrator. Cases where the primary motive for the murders was to facilitate or cover up another felony, like robbery, are not included.

A rampage killer has been defined as follows:
{{quote|A rampage involves the (attempted) killing of multiple persons least partly in public space by a single physically present perpetrator using (potentially) deadly weapons in a single event without any cooling-off period.&lt;ref&gt;Seeger, Thorsten (ed.) School Shootings: International Research, Case Studies, and Concepts for Prevention; Springer, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This list should contain every case with at least one of the following features:
* Rampage killings with 6 or more dead 
* In all cases the perpetrator is not counted among those killed or injured.

All abbreviations used in the table are explained [[#Abbreviations and footnotes|below]]. &lt;!--Additions should be made 1) in order of # of fatalities, and 2) # injured--&gt;

A '''love–hate relationship''' is an [[interpersonal relationship]] involving simultaneous or alternating [[emotion]]s of [[love]] and [[hate]]—something particularly common when [[emotion]]s are intense.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis'' (1976) p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is used frequently in [[psychology]], popular writing, and [[journalism]]. It can be applied to [[Object sexuality|relationships with inanimate objects]], or even [[concept]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10553024 | work=The Economist | title=A love-hate relationship | date=19 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-19882_3-10281561-250.html|title=Skyhook's love/hate relationship with GPS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as those of a [[Romantic love|romantic]] nature or between [[Sibling relationship|siblings]] and parents/children.&lt;ref&gt;M. A. Skura, ''Shakespeare the Actor'' (1993) pp. 286–7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological roots==
A love–hate relationship has been linked to the occurrence of emotional [[ambivalence]] in early childhood;&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; to conflicting responses by different [[Transactional analysis|ego states]] within the same person;&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''Sex in Human Loving'' (1970) p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; or to the inevitable co-existence of [[Psychological egoism|egoistic]] conflicts with the object of love.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Narcissism|Narcissists]] have been seen as particularly prone to aggressive reactions towards love objects,&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Écrits'' (1997) pp. 24–5&lt;/ref&gt; not least when issues of self-identity are involved:&lt;ref&gt;R. D. Laing, ''Self and Others'' (1969) p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; in extreme instances, hate at the very existence of the [[Other (philosophy)|other]] may be the only emotion felt, until love breaks through behind it.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Symington, ''Narcissism'' (2003) pp. 85–6&lt;/ref&gt;

Research from [[Yale University]] suggests love–hate relationships may be the result of poor [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scienceblog.com/cms/the-mystery-behind-love-hate-relationships-10767.html|title=The mystery behind love-hate relationships - ScienceBlog.com|date=8 June 2006|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celebrities==

The term is sometimes employed by writers to refer to relationships between celebrity couples who have been divorced, then who reunite (notably [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and [[Richard Burton]], or [[Eminem]] and Kimberly Scott), as well as to their relationship with fame itself.&lt;ref&gt;Skura, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

A love–hate relationship may develop when people have completely lost the [[intimacy]] within a loving relationship, yet still retain some [[passion (emotion)|passion]] for, or perhaps some [[promise|commitment]] to, each other, before degenerating into a hate–love relationship leading to divorce.&lt;ref&gt;A. Pam and J. Pearson, ''Splitting Up'' (1998) p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Friendship==

[[Tony Blair#Gordon Brown|Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]]'s political friendship took on at times all the characteristics of a love–hate relationship, if one between friends and allies.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Seldon, ''Blair Unbound'' (2007) p. 546 and 574&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sigmund Freud]] said of himself that “an intimate friend and a hated enemy have always been indispensable to my emotional life...not infrequently…friend and enemy have coincided in the same person”.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Ernest Jones, ''The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud'' (1964) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] warned of the conflicts that can arise from conflicting claims within friendships.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Ethics'' (1976) p. 281-8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==

*The Japanese word "[[tsundere]]" comes from two words—tsuntsun (aloof, irritable, cold) and deredere (lovestruck). A tsundere character is one who frequently switches between insulting their love interest and acting lovestruck or kind toward them. Tsundere characters usually belittle their love interest at first but eventually become kinder to them over time.
*[[Catullus]] introduced the love–hate theme into Western culture with his famous lines: "I hate and yet love. You may wonder how I manage it. I don't know, but feel it happen, and am in torment".&lt;ref&gt;J. Boardman et al eds, ''The Oxford History of the Classical World'' (1991) p. 489&lt;/ref&gt;
*The concept of a love–hate relationship is frequently used in teen [[romance novels]] where two characters are shown to "hate" each other, but show some sort of affection or attraction towards each other at certain points of the story.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3817">The '''Massachusetts Body of Liberties''' was the first legal code established by European colonists in [[New England]]. Compiled by the [[Puritan]] minister [[Nathaniel Ward]], the laws were established by the [[Massachusetts General Court]] in 1641. The Body of Liberties begins by establishing the exclusive right of the General Court to legislate and dictate the "Countenance of Authority".

In 1684 [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] revoked the Body of Liberties and reinstated English law over the Commonwealth. When [[James II of England|King James II]] established the [[Massachusetts Colony]] the Body of Liberties took effect{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} and remained so until it was replaced by the 1691 [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Provincial Charter]].&lt;ref name="EACL"&gt;Encyclopedia of American civil liberties, Volume 1, Ed. Paul Finkelman, entry written by Sherrow Pinder, CRC Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-415-94342-6}}, page 979.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rights acknowledged by the Body of Liberties==
The Body of Liberties was one of the earliest protections of [[individual rights]] in America.&lt;ref name="Bernard"&gt;Bernard Schwartz, ''The great rights of mankind: a history of the American Bill of Rights'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1992, 0945612281, page 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike many of the English sources of the time, the Body of Liberties were express in many of their grants and far more supportive of individual rights.&lt;ref name="Bernard" /&gt; Despite these grants, the rights were modifiable by the General Court.

To varying degrees, the document contained rights that would later be included in the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]. Many of the other rights are now considered fundamental components of [[procedural due process]], such as rights to notice and hearing before the court. The rights also contained in the Bill of Rights included [[freedom of speech]], a right against [[Takings clause|uncompensated takings]], a [[Bail#United States|right to bail]], a [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|right to jury trial]], a [[Eighth Amendment's Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause|right against cruel and unusual punishment]], and a right against [[double jeopardy]].&lt;ref name="Bernard" /&gt;

In addition to those, the Body of Liberties also contained other individual rights, including: a prohibition of a compulsory [[conscription|draft]] except for territorial defense; a prohibition of [[monopolies]], "No monopolies shall be granted or allowed amongst us, but of such new Inventions that are profitable to the Countrie, and that for a short time."; &lt;!-- The quote is from the original, do not change the spelling to modern spelling --&gt;prohibition of an [[estate tax]]; the freedom of all "house holders" to fishing and fowling on public land.

Some of the liberties legislated are explicitly cited as originating from biblical sources. While many of the liberties established still exist in both and law and practice in the Commonwealth today, some do not. The justification for slavery of Africans in Passage 91 of the Body of Liberties was likely based on an interpretation of scriptural passages of the [[New Testament]], such as Ephesians 6:5 and Titus 2:9. Liberties were only extended to Caucasian Northern Europeans, particularly [[protestant Christian]] men.

'''Meena Keshwar Kamal''' ([[Pashto language|Pashto]]/{{lang-fa|مینا کشور کمال}}; February 27, 1956 – February 4, 1987), commonly known as '''Meena''', was an [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] [[revolutionary]] [[political activist]], [[feminism|feminist]], [[women's rights]] [[activist]] and founder of [[Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan]] (RAWA), who was [[Assassination|assassinated]] in 1987.

==Biography==
[[File:RAWA logo.png|thumb|Logo of the [[Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan]] (RAWA)]]
In 1977, when she was a student at [[Kabul University]],&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/30/afghanistan-women-feminists-burqa|title=Afghan feminists fighting from under the burqa|author=Jon Boone|work=the Guardian|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; she founded [[Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan]] ([[RAWA]]), an organization formed to promote equality and education for women and continues to "give voice to the deprived and silenced women of Afghanistan". Even after the [[Saur Revolution]] there was no vast changes of women's deprivation in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Afgan Narimukti Andoloner Agnishika (Bengali)|last=Seisab Shahidera|first=Biswas, P|publisher=Atirikto Publication|year=2014|isbn=978-81-928741-0-4|location=Kolkata|pages=44, 45}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 she campaigned against [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|DRA]], and organized meetings in schools to mobilize support against it, and in 1981, she launched a [[Multilingualism|bilingual]] feminist [[magazine]], ''Payam-e-Zan'' (Women's Message).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pz.rawa.org|title=پیام زن، نشریه جمعیت انقلابی زنان افغانستان - راوا|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chavis2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Melody Ermachild Chavis|title=Meena: Heroine Of Afghanistan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RyJEynFyznkC&amp;pg=PT1|date=30 September 2011|publisher=Transworld|isbn=978-1-4464-8846-1|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gioseffi2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gioseffi|first=Daniela|authorlink=Daniela Gioseffi|title=Women on War: An International Anthology of Women's Writings from Antiquity to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZH2FtB14fcEC&amp;pg=PA283|year=2003|publisher=Feminist Press at CUNY|isbn=978-1-55861-409-3|page=283}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also founded Watan Schools to aid [[Afghan refugees|refugee]] children and their mothers, offering both [[hospital]]ization and the teaching of practical skills.&lt;ref name="Gioseffi2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://laconneau.com/NewsletterNovember2009.html Brave Women in a War-Torn World: RAWA and Afghanistan]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 1981, by invitation of the French Government Meena represented the Afghan resistance movement at the [[French Socialist Party]] Congress.

== Personal life ==
Kamal was married to [[Afghanistan Liberation Organization]] leader [[Faiz Ahmad]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Brodsky, Anne E.]] ''With all our strength : the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan''. [[New York City]]: [[Routledge]], 2003. p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; who was murdered by agents of [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]] on November 12, 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110710160918/http://web.e-ariana.com/ariana/eariana.nsf/allDocs/AC9DD311C800E73C87256CCF005E323F?OpenDocument Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, CIA Op and Homicidal Thug]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.womeninwar.org/CMann_afghanwomanhood.pdf Models and Realities of Afghan Womanhood: A Retrospective and Prospects] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313114943/http://www.womeninwar.org/CMann_afghanwomanhood.pdf |date=2012-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They had three children, whose whereabouts are unknown.

==Assassination==
Kamal was [[Assassination|assassinated]] in [[Quetta]], [[Pakistan]] on February 4, 1987. Reports vary as to who the assassins were, but are believed to have been agents of the Afghan Intelligence Service [[KHAD]], the Afghan [[secret police]], or of fundamentalist [[Mujahideen]] leader [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]].&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1973184.stm|title=BBC News - SOUTH ASIA - Afghan activist's killers hanged|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
In a special issue of the [[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]] on November 13, 2006, included Meena among "60 Asian Heroes" and wrote that "Although she was only 30 when she died, Meena had already planted the seeds of an Afghan women's rights movement based on the power of knowledge." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/asia/2006/heroes/in_meena.html TIME Magazine | 60 Years of Asian Heroes: Meena] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070112202432/http://www.time.com/time/asia/2006/heroes/in_meena.html |date=January 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

RAWA says of her "Meena gave 12 years of her short but brilliant life to struggle for her homeland and her people. She had a strong belief that despite the darkness of illiteracy, ignorance of fundamentalism, and corruption and decadence of sell outs imposed on our women under the name of freedom and equality, finally that half of population will be awaken and cross the path towards freedom, democracy and women's rights. The enemy was rightly shivering with fear by the love and respect that Meena was creating within the hearts of our people. They knew that within the fire of her fights all the enemies of freedom, democracy and women would be turned to ashes."&lt;ref name="rawa.org"/&gt;{{Primary inline|date=November 2015}}

An enduring quote from Meena states:&lt;ref name="Gioseffi2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Orr2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tamra Orr|title=We Visit Afghanistan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bLyXBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA36|date=15 September 2011|publisher=Mitchell Lane Publishers, Incorporated|isbn=978-1-61228-102-5|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Memetics''' (also referred to colloquially as '''memeology''') is the study of information and culture based on an analogy with [[Darwinian evolution]]. Proponents describe memetics as an approach to [[evolutionary model]]s of cultural [[information transfer]]. Critics regard memetics as a [[pseudoscience]].{{cn|date=June 2018}} Memetics describes how an idea can propagate successfully, but doesn't necessarily imply a concept is factual.&lt;ref name="Science, Imitation and Memetics"&gt;Kantorovich, Aharon (2013) [http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/9912/ An Evolutionary View of Science: Imitation and Memetics.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[meme]] was coined in [[Richard Dawkins]]' 1976 book ''[[The Selfish Gene]],'' but Dawkins later distanced himself from the resulting field of study.&lt;ref name="misunderstanding"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burman | first1 = J. T. | year = 2012 | title = The misunderstanding of memes: Biography of an unscientific object, 1976–1999 | url = | journal = [[Perspectives on Science]] | volume = 20 | issue = 1| pages = 75–104 | doi = 10.1162/POSC_a_00057 }}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analogous to a [[gene]], the meme was conceived as a "unit of culture" (an idea, belief, pattern of behaviour, etc.) which is "hosted" in the minds of one or more individuals, and which can reproduce itself in the sense of jumping from the mind of one person to the mind of another. Thus what would otherwise be regarded as one individual influencing another to adopt a belief is seen as an idea-replicator reproducing itself in a new host. As with genetics, particularly under a [[Gene-centered view of evolution|Dawkinsian]] interpretation, a meme's success may be due to its contribution to the effectiveness of its host.

The [[Usenet newsgroup]] alt.memetics started in 1993 with peak posting years in the mid to late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://groups.google.com/group/alt.memetics/about?hl=en&amp;pli=1 |title=Google groups, About alt.memetics |first= |last= |work=groups.google.com |date=2012 |accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Journal of Memetics'' was published electronically from 1997 to 2005.&lt;ref name="MemeticsIssues"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cfpm.org/jom-emit/issues.html|title=Index to all JoM-EMIT Issues|accessdate=2009-10-27|work=Journal of Memetics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In his book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' (1976), the evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] used the term ''[[meme]]'' to describe a unit of human [[Cultural learning|cultural transmission]] analogous to the [[gene]], arguing that replication also happens in [[culture]], albeit in a different sense. Bella Hiscock outlined a similar hypothesis in 1975,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cloak | first1 = F.T. | year = 1975 | title = Is a cultural ethology possible? | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/x724552557812338 | journal = Human Ecology | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 161–182 | doi=10.1007/bf01531639}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Dawkins referenced. [[Cultural evolution]] itself is a much older topic, with a history that dates back at least as far as [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s era.

Dawkins (1976) proposed that the meme is a unit of information residing in the brain and is the mutating [[self-replication|replicator]] in human [[Sociocultural evolution|cultural evolution]]. It is a pattern that can influence its surroundings – that is, it has causal agency – and can propagate. This proposal resulted in debate among sociologists, biologists, and scientists of other disciplines. Dawkins himself did not provide a sufficient explanation of how the replication of units of information in the brain controls human behaviour and ultimately culture, and the principal topic of the book was genetics. Dawkins apparently did not intend to present a comprehensive theory of ''memetics'' in ''The Selfish Gene'', but rather coined the term ''meme'' in a speculative spirit. Accordingly, different researchers came to define the term "unit of information" in different ways.

The modern memetics movement dates from the mid-1980s. A January 1983 "[[Metamagical Themas]]" column&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=o8jzWF7rD6oC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=On+viral+sentences+and+self-replicating+structures|title= Metamagical themas: questing for the ... - Google Books|publisher= Books.google.com|date= 1996-04-04| accessdate= 2010-02-18|isbn = 978-0-465-04566-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Douglas Hofstadter]], in ''Scientific American'', was influential – as was his 1985 book of the same name. "Memeticist" was coined as analogous to "geneticist" – originally in ''The Selfish Gene.'' Later Arel Lucas suggested that the discipline that studies memes and their connections to human and other carriers of them be known as "memetics" by analogy with "genetics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/?id=o8jzWF7rD6oC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;dq=%22arel+lucas%22+memetics+themas|title= Metamagical themas: questing for the ... - Google Books|publisher = Books.google.com|date=1996-04-04|accessdate= 2010-02-18|isbn= 978-0-465-04566-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins' ''The Selfish Gene'' has been a factor in attracting the attention of people of disparate intellectual backgrounds. Another stimulus was the publication in 1991 of ''[[Consciousness Explained]]'' by Tufts University philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]], which incorporated the meme concept into a [[theory of mind|theory of the mind]]. In his 1991 essay "[[Viruses of the Mind]]", Richard Dawkins used memetics to explain the phenomenon of religious belief and the various characteristics of organised religions. By then, memetics had also become a theme appearing in fiction (e.g. Neal Stephenson's ''[[Snow Crash]]'').

The idea of ''language as a virus'' had already been introduced by [[William S. Burroughs]] as early as 1962 in his book ''[[The Ticket That Exploded]]'', and later in ''[[The Electronic Revolution]]'', published in 1970 in ''[[The Job: Interviews with William S. Burroughs|The Job]]''. [[Douglas Rushkoff]] explored the same concept in [http://www.rushkoff.com/media-virus/ ''Media Virus: Hidden Agendas in Popular Culture''] in 1995.

However, the foundation of memetics in its full modern incarnation originated in the publication in 1996 of two books by authors outside the academic mainstream: ''Virus of the Mind: The New Science of the Meme'' by former [[Microsoft]] executive turned motivational speaker and professional poker-player, [[Richard Brodie (programmer)|Richard Brodie]], and ''Thought Contagion: How Belief Spreads Through Society'' by [[Aaron Lynch (writer)|Aaron Lynch]], a mathematician and philosopher who worked for many years as an engineer at [[Fermilab]]. Lynch claimed to have conceived his theory totally independently of any contact with academics in the cultural evolutionary sphere, and apparently was not even aware of Dawkins' ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' until his book was very close to publication.

Around the same time as the publication of the books by Lynch and Brodie the e-journal [http://cfpm.org/jom-emit/ Journal of Memetics – ''Evolutionary Models of Information Transmission''] appeared on the web. It was first hosted by the Centre for Policy Modelling at [[Manchester Metropolitan University]] but later taken over by [[Francis Heylighen]] of the [[CLEA]] research institute at the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]]. The e-journal soon became the central point for publication and debate within the nascent memeticist community. (There had been a short-lived paper-based memetics publication starting in 1990, the ''Journal of Ideas'' edited by Elan Moritz.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1991"&gt;[http://archsix.com/omega23.com/Journal_of_Ideas/ The Journal of Ideas, {{ISSN|1049-6335}}, Contents Online]&lt;/ref&gt;) In 1999, [[Susan Blackmore]], a psychologist at the [[University of the West of England]], published ''[[The Meme Machine]]'', which more fully worked out the ideas of Dennett, Lynch, and Brodie and attempted to compare and contrast them with various approaches from the cultural evolutionary mainstream, as well as providing novel, and controversial, memetics-based theories for the evolution of language and the human sense of individual selfhood.

=== The term "meme" ===
The term "meme" derives from the [[Greek language|Ancient Greek]] μιμητής (''mimētḗs''), meaning "imitator, pretender". The similar term "mneme" was used in 1904, by the German evolutionary biologist [[Richard Semon]], best known for his development of the [[engram (neuropsychology)|engram]] theory of [[memory]], in his work ''Die mnemischen Empfindungen in ihren Beziehungen zu den Originalempfindungen'', translated into English in 1921 as ''The Mneme'' {{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}. Until [[Daniel Schacter]] published ''Forgotten Ideas, Neglected Pioneers: Richard Semon and the Story of Memory'' in 2000, Semon's work had little influence, though it was quoted extensively in [[Erwin Schrödinger]]’s prescient 1956 [[Tarner Lecture]] “[[What is Life? (Schrödinger)|Mind and Matter]]”. Richard Dawkins (1976) apparently coined the word "meme" independently of Semon, writing this:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"'Mimeme' comes from a suitable Greek root, but I want a monosyllable that sounds a bit like 'gene'. I hope my classicist friends will forgive me if I abbreviate mimeme to meme. If it is any consolation, it could alternatively be thought of as being related to 'memory', or to the French word même." {{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Maturity===
In 2005, the ''Journal of Memetics – Evolutionary Models of Information Transmission'' ceased publication and published a set of articles on the future of memetics. The website states that although "there was to be a relaunch...after several years nothing has happened".&lt;ref name="JoMFrontpage"&gt;{{cite web|title= Journal of Memetics - Evolutionary Models of Information Transmission|url= http://cfpm.org/jom-emit/|work= Journal of Memetics|accessdate= 17 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susan Blackmore]] has left the University of the West of England to become a freelance science-writer and now concentrates more on the field of consciousness and cognitive science. Derek Gatherer moved to work as a computer programmer in the pharmaceutical industry, although he still occasionally publishes on memetics-related matters. [[Richard Brodie (programmer)|Richard Brodie]] is now climbing the world professional poker rankings. [[Aaron Lynch (writer)|Aaron Lynch]] disowned the memetics community and the words "meme" and "memetics" (without disowning the ideas in his book), adopting the self-description "thought contagionist". He died in 2005.

[[Susan Blackmore]] (2002) re-stated the definition of meme as: whatever is copied from one person to another person, whether habits, skills, songs, stories, or any other kind of information. Further she said that memes, like genes, are replicators in the sense as defined by Dawkins.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Richard Dawkins|Dawkins, R.]] (1982) [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/dawkins_replicators.html "Replicators and Vehicles"] King's College Sociobiology Group, eds., ''Current Problems in Sociobiology'', Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, pp.&amp;nbsp;45–64. "A replicator may be defined as any entity in the universe of which copies are made."
&lt;/ref&gt;
That is, they are information that is copied. Memes are copied by [[imitation]], teaching and other methods. The copies are not perfect: memes are copied with variation; moreover, they compete for space in our memories and for the chance to be copied again. Only some of the variants can survive. The combination of these three elements (copies; variation; competition for survival) forms precisely the condition for [[Darwinian evolution]], and so memes (and hence human cultures) evolve. Large groups of memes that are copied and passed on together are called [[co-adapted]] meme complexes, or ''[[memeplexes]]''. In Blackmore's definition, the way that a meme replicates is through imitation. This requires [[Human brain|brain]] capacity to generally imitate a model or selectively imitate the model. Since the process of social learning varies from one person to another, the imitation process cannot be said to be completely imitated. The sameness of an idea may be expressed with different memes supporting it. This is to say that the [[mutation]] rate in memetic evolution is extremely high, and mutations are even possible within each and every iteration of the imitation process. It becomes very interesting when we see that a social system composed of a complex network of microinteractions exists, but at the macro level an order emerges to create culture.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Internalists and externalists==
The memetics movement split almost immediately into two. The first group were those who wanted to stick to Dawkins' definition of a meme as "a unit of [[cultural transmission]]". Gibron Burchett, another memeticist responsible for helping to research and co-coin the term [[memetic engineering]], along with Leveious Rolando and Larry Lottman, has stated that a meme can be defined, more precisely, as "a unit of [[cultural]] [[information]] that can be copied, located in the brain". This thinking is more in line with Dawkins' second definition of the meme in his book ''[[The Extended Phenotype]]''. The second group wants to redefine memes as observable [[cultural artifact]]s and behaviors. However, in contrast to those two positions, Blackmore does not reject either concept of external or internal memes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blackmore|first=Susan|authorlink=Susan Blackmore |date=2003|title=Consciousness in meme machines|journal = Journal of Consciousness Studies|publisher=Imprint Academic|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These two schools became known as the "internalists" and the "externalists." Prominent internalists included both Lynch and Brodie; the most vocal externalists included Derek Gatherer, a geneticist from [[Liverpool John Moores University]], and William Benzon, a writer on cultural evolution and music. The main rationale for externalism was that internal brain entities are not observable, and memetics cannot advance as a science, especially a [[quantitative research|quantitative]] science, unless it moves its emphasis onto the directly quantifiable aspects of culture. Internalists countered with various arguments: that brain states will eventually be directly observable with advanced technology, that most cultural anthropologists agree that culture is about [[belief]]s and not artifacts, or that artifacts cannot be replicators in the same sense as mental entities (or DNA) are replicators. The debate became so heated that a 1998 Symposium on Memetics, organised as part of the 15th International Conference on [[Cybernetics]], passed a motion calling for an end to definitional debates. McNamara demonstrated in 2011 that functional connectivity profiling using neuroimaging tools enables the observation of the processing of internal memes, "i-memes", in response to external "e-memes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McNamara|first1=Adam|title=Can we Measure Memes?|journal=Frontiers in Evolutionary Neuroscience|date=2011|doi=10.3389/fnevo.2011.00001|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnevo.2011.00001/full|pmc=3118481|pmid=21720531|volume=3|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An advanced statement of the internalist school came in 2002 with the publication of ''The Electric Meme'', by Robert Aunger, an anthropologist from the [[University of Cambridge]]. Aunger also organised a conference in Cambridge in 1999, at which prominent sociologists and anthropologists were able to give their assessment of the progress made in memetics to that date. This resulted in the publication of ''Darwinizing Culture: The Status of Memetics as a Science'', edited by Aunger and with a foreword by Dennett, in 2001&lt;ref&gt;Aunger, Robert. "Darwinizing culture: The status of memetics as a science." (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Criticism==
{{POV check|section|date=July 2018}}

This evolutionary model of cultural information transfer is based on the concept that units of information, or "memes", have an independent existence, are self-replicating, and are subject to selective evolution through environmental forces.&lt;ref name=Polichak/&gt; Starting from a proposition put forward in the writings of [[Richard Dawkins]], this model has formed the basis of a new area of study, one that looks at the self-replicating units of culture. It has been proposed that just as memes are analogous to genes, memetics is analogous to genetics.

Critics contend that some proponents' assertions are "untested, unsupported or incorrect."&lt;ref name="Polichak"&gt;James W. Polichak, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Gr4snwg7iaEC&amp;pg=PA664 "Memes as Pseudoscience"], in Michael Shermer, ''Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience''. P. 664f.&lt;/ref&gt; Luis Benitez-Bribiesca, a critic of memetics, calls it "a [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] [[dogma]]" and "a dangerous idea that poses a threat to the serious study of [[consciousness]] and cultural evolution" among other things. As factual criticism, he refers to the lack of a ''code script'' for memes, as the DNA is for genes, and to the fact that the meme mutation mechanism (i.e., an idea going from one brain to another) is too unstable (low replication accuracy and high mutation rate), which would render the evolutionary process chaotic.&lt;ref&gt;Benitez-Bribiesca, Luis (2001): ''[http://redalyc.uaemex.mx/redalyc/pdf/339/33905206.pdf Memetics: A dangerous idea] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704104711/http://redalyc.uaemex.mx/redalyc/pdf/339/33905206.pdf |date=2009-07-04 }}''. Interciecia 26: 29–31, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; This, however, has been demonstrated (e.g. by Daniel C. Dennett, in ''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]'') to not be the case, in fact, due to the existence of self-regulating correction mechanisms (vaguely resembling those of gene transcription) enabled by the redundancy and other properties of most meme expression languages, which do stabilize information transfer. (E.g. spiritual narratives—including music and dance forms—can survive in full detail across any number of generations even in cultures with oral tradition only.) Memes for which stable copying methods are available will inevitably get selected for survival more often than those which can only have unstable mutations, therefore going extinct. (Notably, Benitez-Bribiesca's claim of "no code script" is also irrelevant, considering the fact that there is nothing preventing the information contents of memes from being coded, encoded, expressed, preserved or copied in all sorts of different ways throughout their life-cycles.)

Another criticism comes from [[semiotics]], (e.g., Deacon,&lt;ref&gt;[[Terrence Deacon]], The trouble with memes (and what to do about it). ''The Semiotic Review of Books'' 10(3).&lt;/ref&gt; Kull&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kull | first1 = Kalevi | authorlink = Kalevi Kull | year = 2000 | title = Copy versus translate, meme versus sign: development of biological textuality | url = | journal = European Journal for Semiotic Studies | volume = 12 | issue = 1| pages = 101–120 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) stating that the concept of meme is a primitivized concept of [[Sign (semiotics)|Sign]]. Meme is thus described in memetics as a sign without its triadic nature. In other words, meme is a degenerate sign, which includes only its ability of being copied. Accordingly, in the broadest sense, the objects of copying are memes, whereas the objects of translation and interpretation are signs.
&lt;!-- This last paragraph could be better explained. I'm fimiliar with the subject but was confused. "Tdiadic nature" "degenerate sign" the article would benefit from clarification of these terms. This may not be the proper place to put this but I don't know if there is a discussion page for this article. --&gt;

[[Mary Midgley]] criticises memetics for at least two reasons:&lt;ref&gt;Midgley, Mary. The Solitary Self: Darwin and the Selfish Gene. Acumen, 2010. {{ISBN|978-1-84465-253-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; "One, culture is not best understood by examining its smallest parts, as culture is pattern-like, comparable to an ocean current. Many more factors, historical and others, should be taken into account than only whatever particle culture is built from. Two, if memes are not thoughts (and thus not cognitive phenomena), as Daniel C. Dennett insists in "[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]", then their [[Ontology|ontological]] status is open to question, and memeticists (who are also [[reductionism|reductionists]]) may be challenged whether memes even exist. Questions can extend to whether the idea of "meme" is itself a meme, or is a true concept. Fundamentally, memetics is an attempt to produce knowledge through organic metaphors, which as such is a questionable research approach, as the application of metaphors has the effect of hiding that which does not fit within the realm of the metaphor. Rather than study actual reality, without preconceptions, memetics, as so many of the socio-biological explanations of society, believe that saying that the apple is like an orange is a valid analysis of the apple."&lt;ref&gt;Stepan, Nancy L. Race and Gender: The Role of Analogy in Science. In Goldberg, David Theo (ed.) The Anatomy of Racism. University of Minnesota Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry Jenkins]], Joshua Green, and Sam Ford, in their book ''Spreadable Media'' (2013), criticize Dawkins' idea of the meme, writing that "while the idea of the meme is a compelling one, it may not adequately account for how content circulates through participatory culture." The three authors also criticize other interpretations of memetics, especially those which describe memes as "self-replicating", because they ignore the fact that "culture is a human product and replicates through human agency."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = New York University Press| isbn = 978-0-8147-4350-8 | last1 = Jenkins| first1 = Henry| last2 = Ford| first2 = Sam| last3 = Green| first3 = Joshua| title = Spreadable Media| location = New York ; London| series = Postmillennial pop| date = 2013|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other critics, Maria Kronfeldner has criticized memetics for being based on an allegedly inaccurate analogy with the gene; alternately, she claims it is "heuristically trivial", being a mere redescription of what is already known without offering any useful novelty.&lt;ref&gt;Kronfeldner, Maria. [https://books.google.com/books/about/Darwinian_Creativity_and_Memetics.html?id=VxZOYgEACAAJ] Darwinian Creativity and Memetics. Acumen, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==New developments==
{{synthesis|date=June 2015}}
Dawkins  in ''[[A Devil's Chaplain]]'' responded that there are actually two different types of memetic processes (controversial and informative). The first is a type of cultural idea, action, or expression, which does have high variance; for instance, a student of his who had inherited some of the mannerisms of [[Wittgenstein]]. However, he also describes a self-correcting meme, highly resistant to mutation. As an example of this, he gives [[origami]] patterns in elementary schools – except in rare cases, the meme is either passed on in the exact sequence of instructions, or (in the case of a forgetful child) terminates. This type of meme tends not to evolve, and to experience profound mutations in the rare event that it does.

Another definition, given by [[Hokky Situngkir]], tried to offer a more rigorous formalism for the meme, ''memeplexes'', and the ''[[deme (biology)|deme]]'', seeing the meme as a cultural unit in a cultural [[complex system]]. It is based on the Darwinian [[genetic algorithm]] with some modifications to account for the different patterns of evolution seen in genes and memes. In the method of memetics as the way to see culture as a [[complex adaptive system]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cogprints.org/4772/|title=On Selfish Memes: culture as complex adaptive system|author=Situngkir, Hokky|date=16 Mar 2006|accessdate= 2010-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; he describes a way to see memetics as an alternative methodology of cultural [[evolution]]. However, there are as many possible definitions that are credited to the word "meme". For example, in the sense of [[computer simulation]] the term ''[[memetic algorithm]]'' is used to define a particular computational viewpoint.

The possibility of quantitative analysis of memes using [[functional neuroimaging|neuroimaging]] tools and the suggestion that such studies have already been done was given by McNamara (2011).&lt;ref name="mcnamara"&gt;{{harvnb|McNamara|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This author proposes hyperscanning (concurrent scanning of two communicating individuals in two separate MRI machines) as a key tool in the future for investigating memetics.

Velikovsky (2013) proposed the "holon" as the structure of the meme,&lt;ref name="StoryAlity"&gt;{{cite web|title=Holonic Structure of the Meme - The Unit of Culture|url=http://storyality.wordpress.com/2013/12/12/storyality-100-the-holonic-structure-of-the-meme-the-unit-of-culture/|work=StoryAlity academic weblog, JT Velikovsky|accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; synthesizing the major theories on memes of [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]], [[E.

Proponents of memetics as described in the Journal of Memetics (out of print since 2005&lt;ref name=JOM&gt;{{cite web|title=Journal of Memetics|url=http://cfpm.org/jom-emit/|accessdate=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ) – ''Evolutionary Models of Information Transmission'' believe that 'memetics' has the potential to be an important and promising analysis of culture using the framework of evolutionary concepts. 
[[Keith Henson]] in ''Memetics and the Modular-Mind'' (Analog Aug. 1987)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Keith Henson  View profile More options|url = http://groups.google.ca/group/alt.mindcontrol/msg/103e03bce6100cac?hl=en&amp;|title=Promise Keepers: Is it a Cult? - alt.mindcontrol &amp;#124; Google Groups|publisher=Groups.google.ca|date=1997-10-05|accessdate=2010-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; makes the case that memetics needs to incorporate [[evolutionary psychology]] to understand the psychological traits of a meme's host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.li/tgyg|title=Sex, Drugs, and Cults by H.

DiCarlo ({{year needed|date=June 2015}}) has developed the idea of 'memetic equilibrium' to describe a cultural compatible state with [[Homeostasis|biological equilibrium]]. In "Problem Solving and Neurotransmission in the Upper Paleolithic" (in press{{clarify|date=June 2015}}), diCarlo argues that as human consciousness evolved and developed, so too did our ancestors' capacity to consider and attempt to solve environmental problems in more conceptually sophisticated ways. Understood in this way, problem solving amongst a particular group, when considered satisfactory, often produces a feeling of environmental control, stability, in short—memetic equilibrium. 
But the pay-off is not merely practical, providing purely functional utility—it is biochemical and it comes in the form of neurotransmitters. The relationship between a gradually emerging conscious awareness and sophisticated languages in which to formulate representations combined with the desire to maintain biological equilibrium, generated the necessity for equilibrium to fill in conceptual gaps in terms of understanding three very important aspects in the Upper Paleolithic: causality, morality, and mortality. The desire to explain phenomena in relation to maintaining survival and reproductive stasis, generated a normative stance in the minds of our ancestors—Survival/Reproductive Value (or S-R Value).

Houben (2014) has argued on several occasions that the  exceptional resilience of [[Shrauta|Vedic ritual]] and its interaction with a changing ecological and economic environment over several millennia can be profitably dealt with in a ‘cultural evolution’ perspective in which the Vedic mantra is the ‘meme’ or unit of cultural replication.&lt;ref&gt;Jan E.M.

==Applications==
Research methodologies that apply memetics go by many names: Viral marketing, cultural evolution, the history of ideas, social analytics, and more.  Many of these applications do not make reference to the literature on memes directly but are built upon the evolutionary lens of idea propagation that treats semantic units of culture as self-replicating and mutating patterns of information that are assumed to be relevant for scientific study.  For example, the field of public relations is filled with attempts to introduce new ideas and alter social discourse.  One means of doing this is to design a meme and deploy it through various media channels.  One historic example of applied memetics is the PR campaign conducted in 1991 as part of the build-up to the first Gulf War in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prwatch.org/books/tsigfy10.html PR Watch]&lt;/ref&gt;

The application of memetics to a difficult complex social system problem, environmental [[sustainability]], has recently been attempted at thwink.org&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thwink.org/sustain/general/Memetics.htm thwink.org].&lt;/ref&gt; Using meme types and memetic infection in several stock and flow simulation models, Jack Harich has demonstrated several interesting phenomena that are best, and perhaps only, explained by memes. One model, The Dueling Loops of the Political Powerplace,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thwink.org/sustain/articles/005/DuelingLoops_Paper.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the fundamental reason corruption is the norm in politics is due to an inherent structural advantage of one feedback loop pitted against another. Another model, The Memetic Evolution of Solutions to Difficult Problems,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thwink.org/sustain/articles/007/MemeticEvolutionOfSolutions.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; uses memes, the [[evolutionary algorithm]], and the [[scientific method]] to show how complex solutions evolve over time and how that process can be improved. The insights gained from these models are being used to engineer memetic solution elements to the sustainability problem.

Another application of memetics in the sustainability space is the crowdfunded Climate Meme Project&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121208023214/http://www.climatememe.org/]&lt;/ref&gt; conducted by Joe Brewer and Balazs Laszlo Karafiath in the spring of 2013. This study was based on a collection of 1000 unique text-based expressions gathered from Twitter, Facebook, and structured interviews with climate activists. The major finding was that the global warming meme is not effective at spreading because it causes emotional duress in the minds of people who learn about it.  Five central tensions were revealed in the discourse about [climate change], each of which represents a resonance point through which dialogue can be engaged.  The tensions were Harmony/Disharmony (whether or not humans are part of the natural world), Survival/Extinction (envisioning the future as either apocalyptic collapse of civilization or total extinction of the human race), Cooperation/Conflict (regarding whether or not humanity can come together to solve global problems), Momentum/Hesitation (about whether or not we are making progress at the collective scale to address climate change), and Elitism/Heretic (a general sentiment that each side of the debate considers the experts of its opposition to be untrustworthy).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fastcoexist.com/1681526/using-memes-to-improve-climate-change-communication Using Memes to Improve Climate Change Communication]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ben Cullen, in his book ''Contagious Ideas'',&lt;ref name="Contagious Ideas"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Cullen | first1 = Ben | title = Contagious Ideas: On evolution, culture, archaeology, and Cultural Virus Theory | publisher = [[Oxbow Books]] | date = 2000 | location =Oxford and Oakville | isbn = 1-84217-014-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; brought the idea of the meme into the discipline of archaeology. He coined the term "Cultural Virus Theory", and used it to try to anchor archaeological theory in a neo-Darwinian paradigm. Archaeological memetics could assist the application of the meme concept to material culture in particular.

[[Francis Heylighen]] of the [[Center Leo Apostel for Interdisciplinary Studies]] has postulated what he calls "memetic selection criteria". These criteria opened the way to a specialized field of ''applied memetics'' to find out if these selection criteria could stand the test of [[quantitative research|quantitative analyses]]. In 2003 Klaas Chielens carried out these tests in a Masters thesis project on the testability of the selection criteria.

It is argued that a generalised Darwinian framework for handling cultural change can provide explanations where established, speaker centred approaches fail to do so. The book makes comparatively concrete suggestions about the possible material structure of memes, and provides two empirically rich case studies.

Australian academic S.J. Whitty has argued that [[project management]] is a memeplex with the language and stories of its practitioners at its core.&lt;ref&gt;[http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/eserv.php?pid=UQ:8801&amp;dsID=sjw_ijpm_05.pdf A Memetic Paradigm of Project Management] (International Journal of Project Management, 23 (8) 575-583)&lt;/ref&gt; This radical approach sees a project and its management as an illusion; a human construct about a collection of feelings, expectations, and sensations, which are created, fashioned, and labeled by the human brain. Whitty's approach requires project managers to consider that the reasons for using project management are not consciously driven to maximize profit, and are encouraged to consider project management as naturally occurring, self-serving, evolving process which shapes organizations for its own purpose.

Swedish political scientist Mikael Sandberg argues against "[[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]]" interpretations of institutional and technological evolution and studies creative innovation of [[information technologies]] in governmental and private organizations in Sweden in the 1990s from a memetic perspective.&lt;ref&gt;"The Evolution of IT Innovations in Swedish Organizations: A Darwinian Critique of ‘Lamarckian’ Institutional Economics", '''Journal of Evolutionary Economics''', vol. 17, No. 1 (Feb 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Comparing the effects of active ("Lamarckian") IT strategy versus user–producer interactivity (Darwinian co-evolution), evidence from Swedish organizations shows that co-evolutionary interactivity is almost four times as strong a factor behind IT creativity as the "Lamarckian" IT strategy.

==Terminology==
*'''[[Memeplex]]''' – (an abbreviation of meme-complex) is a collection or grouping of memes that have evolved into a mutually supportive or [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Blackmore, Susan, 1999, The Meme Machine, Oxford University Press, Oxford, {{ISBN|0-19-850365-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simply put, a meme-complex is a set of ideas that reinforce each other. Meme-complexes are roughly analogous to the symbiotic collection of individual [[gene]]s that make up the genetic codes of biological organisms. An example of a memeplex would be a [[religion]].
*'''[[Meme pool]]''' – a population of interbreeding memes.
*'''[[Memetic engineering]]''' – The process of deliberately creating memes, using engineering principles.
*'''[[Memetic algorithms]]''' – an approach to [[evolutionary computation]] that attempts to emulate cultural evolution in order to solve [[optimization problem]]s.
*'''Memotype''' – is the actual information-content of a meme.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Grant. ''A Memetic Lexicon''. Montreal. 1990&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Memeoid''' – is a [[neologism]] for people who have been taken over by a meme to the extent that their own survival becomes inconsequential. Examples include [[kamikaze]]s, [[suicide bomber]]s and [[cult]] members who commit mass suicide. The term was apparently coined by H. [[Keith Henson]] in "Memes, L5 and the Religion of the Space Colonies," ''L5 News'', September 1985 pp.&amp;nbsp;5–8,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cfpm.org/~majordom/memetics/2000/16177.html Two early meme papers of historical interest (1a)]&lt;/ref&gt; and referenced in the expanded second edition of [[Richard Dawkins]]' book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' (p.&amp;nbsp;330). But in the strict sense all people are essentially ''memeoid'', since no distinction can be made if one uses language, or memes use their host. In ''[[The Electronic Revolution]]'' [[William S. Burroughs]] writes: "the word has not been recognised as a virus because it has achieved a state of stable symbiosis with the host."
*'''Memetic equilibrium''' – refers to the cultural equivalent of species biological equilibrium. It is that which humans strive for in terms of personal value with respect to cultural artefacts and ideas. The term was coined by Christopher diCarlo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Christopher W. diCarlo |title=How Problem Solving and Neurotransmission in the Upper Paleolithic led to The Emergence and Maintenance of Memetic Equilibrium in Contemporary World Religions |url=http://www.politicsandculture.org/2010/04/27/how-problem-solving-and-neurotransmission-in-the-upper-paleolithic-led-to-the-emergence-and-maintenance-of-memetic-equilibrium-in-contemporary-world-religions/ |journal=Politics and Culture |issue=Special Evolutionary Issue |date=April 27, 2010 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The general concept or principle of moral universalizability is that moral principles, maxims, norms, facts, predicates, rules, etc., are universally true; that is, the basis of their being true in any particular case can in some sense be applied to all cases (to all other persons, actions, etc.) Some philosophers, like Immanuel Kant, Richard Hare, and Alan Gewirth, have argued that moral universalizability is the foundation of all moral facts. Others have argued that moral universalizability is a necessary, but not a sufficient, test of morality. A few philosophers have also argued that morality is not constrained by universalizability at all.

== Two Moral Universalization Conditions ==

The general concept can be distinguished into two main versions, which can be called ''universal applicability'' and ''universal practice''.&lt;ref&gt;Forschler, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Any particular universalizability test requires that some criterion be satisfied within this universalizability condition. A universalization condition combined with a specific satisfaction criterion constitutes a universalizability test. The two versions can be modelled in formal logic as:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
  | Universal Applicability (UA):
  | □(x)'''C'''Mx
|-
  | Universal Practice (UP):
  | □'''C'''(x)Mx
|}

where '''C''' is a modal operating meaning "criterion C is satisfied by..." and Mx means "an agent/action follows principle (or maxim) M". For a strong universalizability test, satisfying this formula makes M permissible; for a weak universalizability test (or universalizability principle), satisfying this formula is necessary for M to be permissible, but may not be sufficient. Both are universalization conditions in virtue of having a universal quantifier, (x), but the role of each is different.

In a UA test, M is only permissible if the criterion C is satisfied for each possible individual, in any possible situation or world if she follows (or were to follow) the principle M. In particular, C must be satisfied anytime an individual does M even if other agents do not do M. That is, the requirement that M must satisfy C is universally applicable to each possible person's behavior, considered individually.

For a UP test, however, whether C is satisfied when not all persons are doing M is irrelevant; it is only required that C be satisfied whenever it is the case that everyone does M: that is, when M is universally practiced.

== Satisfaction Criteria within the Universalization Conditions ==

In addition to using different universalization conditions, universalizability tests use a variety of different satisfaction criteria. For example, [[Consequentialism|consequentialists]] typically use criteria like "produces at least as much good as any alternative would" or "has at least as much expected value as any alternative." These tend to be aggregative, allowing the addition of value across different agents. Deontologists tend to use non-aggregative criteria like "is not impossible" (Kant's contradiction in conception test), "would make the satisfaction of your ends impossible" (Kant's contradiction in will test), "would disrespect humanity in yourself or another" (Kant's formula of humanity), or "would be reasonable to reject" (Scanlon's contractualist test).

== Universal Applicability ==

In this condition, a moral predicate (like obligatory, permissible, forbidden, etc.) always applies to a given behavior in virtue of some reason, and whenever the same reason is present, the same predicate applies.

=== Moral Supervenience ===

According to the principle of [[moral supervenience]], moral properties of actions (obligatory, permissible, forbidden, etc.) supervene on--that is, depend upon or are functions of--non-moral properties. The principle itself does not specify which moral properties these are, so it does not constitute a universalizability test. However it is often considered a necessary feature of any moral truth, and hence is often thought to rule out certain general theories of morality (see [[meta-ethics]]), even if it cannot forbid many particular actions.

=== In Act Consequentialism ===

In a series of books, R.M. Hare (who introduced the term into philosophical literature&lt;ref&gt;Hare 1981, pp.80-81&lt;/ref&gt;) made moral supervenience the basis of his derivation of a version of [[utilitarianism]], but this was actually a universal applicability condition combined with the criterion that the universalized behavior would not produce a greater balance of satisfied over frustrated preferences of all affected agents (including animal agents as well as persons) than any alternative behavior would.&lt;ref&gt;Hare, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hare, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[Consequentialism|act consequentialists]] also use versions of this argument, often expressing this in terms of the golden rule or the universality of reasons, where this is described as a universal applicability condition.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, 1903, pp.97-98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, 1928, pp.110, 140, 334-339&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Singer, 1981, pp.229-30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Singer, 1993, pp.11-14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cummiskey, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pettit, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; [[J.S. Mill]] was also an act consequentialist, using the universal applicability condition and rejecting the universal practice condition as part of any fundamental moral principle, although he thought that the results of everyone's acting the same way was a useful guide for determining when an individual act was likely to produce good consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Mill, 1972, p.1881&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Colloquial Moral Thought ===

The universal applicability condition is also embodied in the colloquial question, "How would you like it if somebody else did that to you?" Here, the presumption is that the behavior in question causes some harm or offense to other people, even though it may benefit or please the person performing it. When the person reflects upon how someone else's performance of the same behavior might harm herself, she finds she cannot approve of this, which suggests that if she is consistent she should also disapprove of herself doing it, judging it morally wrong. The question is imprecise in that it does not specify exactly what effects of the behavior would be grounds for considering it impermissible, and therefore, like the principle of moral supervenience, does not specify a complete universalizability test. Likewise, the phrase "What's good (or: is sauce) for the goose is good (sauce) for the gander," suggesting that minor, irrelevant differences do not affect the permissibility of some behavior, so if it is permissible for one person (the "goose") then it is also permissible for any very similar person (a "gander")-with the implication that if someone rejects the second judgment, they must either explain why the different between the two cases is morally relevant, or retract their judgment of the first case.

=== In Alan Gewirth ===

Alan Gewirth uses a universal applicability condition in his "principle of generic consistency,"&lt;ref&gt;Gewirth, 1978, p.135&lt;/ref&gt;, who added to it the criterion that the effects of anyone's actions may not deny to any other person the necessary conditions of their successful agency, most notably including "freedom and well-being."&lt;ref&gt;Gewirth, 1978, pp.63-64&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Kantian Ethics ===

The 18th-century [[Germany|German]] philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]]'s second formulation of a [[categorical imperative]] or fundamental moral principle, the formula of humanity as an end in itself, uses a UA condition. It requires all persons to always respect humanity in oneself or another as an end in itself. ''Always'' presumably means: in any possible situation, and hence implicitly invokes a UA condition: even if some instance of a behavior is not disrespectful, if some possible instance of it would be disrespectful, then we must follow a principle of avoiding it in the latter type of case.

== Universal Practice ==

In this condition, a behavior if permissible if and only if its universal practice by all persons necessarily satisfies some criterion. An imagined world in which everyone in it conform to the same kind of behavior is often called an "ideal world," and so moral or political theories appealing to it are sometimes called "ideal theories" as opposed to "non-ideal theories." This should not be taken to mean that the former theories are themselves more ideal or better than the latter by definition; the ideality in question refers to the worlds the theories describe, are based on, or intended to apply to, not necessarily to how well they describe moral facts and obligations in the actual world, which is much disputed.

=== General Problems of Universal Practice Tests ===

For many behaviors, universalizability tests using the same satisfaction criteria but different universalization conditions will reach the same conclusion. For instance, if every person's M-ing causes the same amount of harm and good as anyone else's, no matter what anyone else does, then the total effect of everyone's M-ing will be the effect of one person's M-ing multiplied by the number of persons; if the criterion is that the effect cause no more harm than good, then the same behaviors will satisfy or fail this criterion under either universalization condition we use. However some behaviors cause different amounts of harm depending upon how many other people are performing them. For these behaviors, universal practice tests generally give counter-intuitive, and often quite harmful recommendations, for cases in which not everyone else is doing the same thing we are doing. This occurs in two general kinds of cases: responding to evil-doers, and solving coordination problems. Together they are typically called "partial compliance" problems, because they deal with the question of what would be a morally-correct response to a situation where other persons are not doing the same thing you are doing (or considering doing).

The first is illustrated by a disposition to complete pacifism. In any world where everyone is pacifistic, little harm is done, so it passes most universal practice tests. But in a realistic world containing many non-pacifists, an individual's commitment to complete pacifism is likely to not only make him a victim of evil-doers, but unable to defend innocent third parties from the latter, resulting in much greater harm than a more complex conditional disposition, like "be pacifist only if all others are pacifistic, but defend yourself and others from aggression if necessary."&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, 1965, pp.38-39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rees, 1970-71, p.250&lt;/ref&gt;

The second is exemplified by the need to choose which side of the road to drive on. A rule of always driving on the left passes most universal practice tests. It follows that such tests permit such behavior--even if not everyone else has chosen this option. Of course, the rule of always driving on the right, as well as the more intuitively plausible rule of driving on whatever side conforms to local custom or law, also passes such tests. So while such tests permit such intuitively plausible rules, they also permit some which will lead to catastrophe in a world where not everyone has picked the same permissible rule.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbard, 1965, p.217&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, 1985, pp.253-54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hardin, 1988, p.67&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, like the rule of absolute pacifism, such a rule will typically pass a universal practice test, but fails a universal applicability test, because while everyone's following the rule is not harmful, its practice by some persons ''while some other people are not doing so'' does produce significant harm. Any behavior condemned by a universal practice test will also be condemned by a universal approval test using the same satisfaction criteria, so the latter is always at least as strong as the former.

A variety of proposals have been made to try to rescue universal practice tests from these implications, but none have been universally considered successful.

=== In Colloquial Moral Thought ===

The UP condition is expressed by the colloquial question "What if everybody did that?" Like the colloquial "somebody" question above, it leaves unstated precisely what result of everyone's performance of the behavior would make this result unacceptable and hence make the behavior wrong. 

=== In Kantian Ethics ===

Immanuel Kant's first formulation of the categorical imperative, the "Formula of Universal Law," as well as his third "Kingdom of Ends" formulation, also use a universal practice condition.&lt;ref&gt;Kant, 1785&lt;/ref&gt; The first formula states that the only morally acceptable [[Maxim (philosophy)|maxims]] of our actions are those that could rationally be willed to practiced as a universal law, or in a variant "Law of Nature" formulation, one whose practice by all persons we could will to have been a law of nature (and hence necessarily governing the behavior of all persons throughout all time and space).&lt;ref&gt;Kant, 1785, 4:421&lt;/ref&gt; Kant appealed to two criteria which must be satisfied under such a condition: first, the universalization must be conceivable, and second that this universalization will not necessarily frustrate the ends of any agent practicing the maxim (and hence such an agent can both will his own practice of the maxim, and its practice by all other agents).&lt;ref&gt;Kant, 1784, 4:424&lt;/ref&gt; The first is violated by maxims, e.g., of always lying or making false promises, for if (''per impossibile'') everyone did the same thing, no one would even consider any form of words given by another to count as a statement or promise, so it would be impossible to even try to make such statements with the intent to deceive.&lt;ref&gt;Kant, 1785, 4:422&lt;/ref&gt; The second is violated by maxims, e.g, of never helping another person in need, for while we could imagine a world in which no one gave such help to anyone else, no agent could possibly want others to treat him that way, for there are bound to be occasions which the lack of such help will inevitably result in the frustration of the first person's ends-which, by hypothesis, he wills to satisfy.&lt;ref&gt;Kant, 1785, 4:423&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant called the first kind of violation a contradiction in conception, the second a contradiction in will. Like Gewirth's idea of frustrating the necessary conditions of agency, they involve a [[performative contradiction]], because the practice of the maxim by others would undermine one's own attempt to practice it, and willing the former (even when this does not cause others to practice it) is tantamount to willing the frustration of one's own agency. However Kant's Formula of Universal Law only identifies these contradictions in cases where the maxim is universally practiced; for Gewirth they can also occur in cases where some (but not all) persons' performing the behavior would deprive you of the necessary condition of agency.

Defenders of Kant's ethics have often appealed to his second version of the categorical imperative, the formula of humanity, in order to successfully deal with problems involving evil-doers and coordination problems. As noted above, this formula can successfully do so because it involves a universal applicability condition, and hence is sensitive to the harm done by various maxims in non-ideal conditions even if their universal practice is harmless.

=== In Rule Consequentialism ===

Another moral theory using a universal practice test is [[rule consequentialism]], or more precisely that version of it sometimes called ''ideal rule consequentialism'', where a moral rule is permissible if and only if its practice by all persons would produce at least as much of a balance of good over bad results than the universal practice of any other rule would. This theory was first expounded by Jurist John Austin &lt;ref&gt;Austin, 1885, book I, p.107&lt;/ref&gt;, and defended at greater length by R.F. Harrod in 1936, on the grounds that some behaviors cause ''more'' harm when everyone (or almost everyone) else is doing the same thing than in the more common case where not everyone else is doing so; since the harm can get so very bad in such cases, he argued that we should use its effects in this universal practice case to condemn the same behavior even when almost no one else is doing it, and even when it actually causes little or no harm in such cases.&lt;ref&gt;Harrod, 1936, p.148&lt;/ref&gt; He illustrated this with Kant's example of telling a lie, arguing that the practice of lying by many individual people may actually only be modestly harmful, and in some cases may produce more good than the truth, as long as enough truth-tellers are still around to provide a moral example and give us some confidence that we will usually be told the truth (and be believed when we speak); but if everyone lies, then communication becomes impossible, a devastating effect which Harrod thought justified our condemnation of lying even in the normal case where it may cause little or no harm.

This view has been much criticized, however, on the grounds that it involves "rule-worship" which forbids us from performing such behaviors precisely when they are harmless or even beneficial, just because they would be less beneficial in circumstances which we know we are not in, and that an adequate response (justified by a UA test) is to follow the slightly more but not unmanageable complex rule of usually telling the truth, but lying just when doing so will definitely produce more good than telling the truth.&lt;ref&gt;Smart, 1973, p.10&lt;/ref&gt; Considerations of the aforementioned need to handle evil-doers has also motivated some defenders of ideal rule consequentialism to suggest modified versions which permit only rules which produce at least as great a balance of good over bad results when 90% (or some other fraction) of any given population practice it, which requires us to follow rules which contain provisions for how to respond to the 10% (criminals, etc.) who may be violating the rules in question.&lt;ref&gt;Brandt, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hooker, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Such proposals have in turn been criticized as a 90% practice level is just as arbitrary as a 100% practice level for the test condition, which can be avoided by appealing to a "variable-rate" test condition where the rule must be optimal regardless of the fraction of the population following it.&lt;ref&gt;Ridge, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tobia, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; These proposals in effect abandon the universal practice condition for the universal applicability condition.

=== In Other Moral Theories ===

Other versions of a universal practice test are found in M.G. Singer's "generalization argument,"&lt;ref&gt;Singer, M.G., 1961, p.66&lt;/ref&gt;, J. Habermas's "principle U,"&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, 1990, p.65&lt;/ref&gt; and T.M. Scanlon's "contractualism."&lt;ref&gt;Scanlon, 1998, p.158&lt;/ref&gt; These have each in turn been occasionally criticized for their inability to handle non-ideal cases

The '''Movement for Justice''' was set up in 1995 by people around the Kingsway College Student Union in the [[London Borough of Camden]] to tackle racism in institutional and established forms. The group confronted organised [[fascism]] as well as [[death in custody]] and wider racism to black people as well as [[tourism|travellers]], [[refugees]] and [[asylum seekers]]. It is also the sister group to the American organization The Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, Integration &amp; Immigrant Rights, and Fight for Equality By Any Means Necessary ([[BAMN]]). Movement for Justice is headed up by members of the [[Workers' Internationalist League|Revolutionary Internationalist League]] (RIL), a [[Trotskyist]] group.&lt;ref name="Mendick"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mendick|first1=Robert|title=Veteran revolutionary with conviction for attacking Tory chairman behind the Grenfell Tower 'day of rage' protest|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/20/veteran-revolutionary-conviction-attacking-tory-chairman-behind/|accessdate=20 June 2017|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The group first grew following the murder of [[Stephen Lawrence]] and the campaign that followed. The group went on to campaign for justice for the murders by racists and in police custody of many others including [[Rolan Adams]], Michael Tachie-Menson,

The group took part in the demonstrations to close down the [[British National Party]] headquarters in the area and helped the [[Youth against Racism in Europe]] to build an anti-racist campaign through this. They also campaigned with the YRE and local community to fight drove the BNP off [[Brick Lane]].

In 1993 a Kingsway student [[Shah Alam]] was nearly killed in a racist attack in Poplar, East London and they organised the Justice for Shah Alam Campaign which organised a march, public meetings, press conferences and court pickets to get the racists convicted and jailed.

After the death of [[Brian Douglas]] they helped get Lambeth [[Unison]] (public service workers union) and Kingsway College Student Union with the campaign.

The organisation also concentrated on mass non-co-operation with the [[Asylum Bill]] and in September 1995, published a pamphlet "Howard's Racist Immigration and Asylum Bill - What it is and how to fight it". In 1995 the group orchestrated a paint attack on [[Brian Mawhinney]], Tory MP outside Parliament at the state opening and Queen's speech, because of what they saw as his deliberate use of emotive and misrepresentative language about 'British people fearing immigrants flooding the country' which were seen by many as an [[incitement to ethnic or racial hatred|incitement to racial hatred]]. The group continued to oppose immigration, asylum legislation after Labour took power.

After the death of Oscar Okoye the group came under attack from [[Lee Jasper]] and [[Brian Paddick]]. The group's chairman [[Alex Olowade]] was sacked from his job with Lambeth Council.

In 2001 after the police shot dead a man with a replica gun cigarette lighter in Brixton, the group organised a demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/jul/17/ukguns ‘Demonstration planned after police shooting’], ''The Guardian'', 17 July 2001 (accessed 11 April 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; The demonstration was covered by the BBC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1450042.stm ‘Brixton violence 'against racist police'’], ''BBC News'', 21 July 2001 (accessed 13 April 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible infiltration by undercover police==
Former [[Metropolitan Police]] [[Special Branch]] undercover officer Peter Francis, who as part of the secretive [[Special Demonstration Squad]] infiltrated the [[Youth against Racism in Europe|YRE]] and associated groups between 1993 and 1997, claimed in a 2014 statement issued through his solicitor that he had been a founding member of Movement for Justice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leighday.co.uk/News/2014/July-2014/Statement-on-behalf-of-Peter-Francis-following-pub ‘Statement on behalf of Peter Francis following publication of the Creedon Report’], Leigh Day website, 29 July 2014 (accessed 30 July 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent activities==
The group organised the first London student civil rights conference on 13 July 2006{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} and according to ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' was the key organiser behind the "Day of Rage" protests following the [[Grenfell Tower fire]].&lt;ref name="Mendick" /&gt;

[[Image:PAR-1to1.svg|thumb|Pixel aspect ratio 1:1]]
[[Image:PAR-2to1.svg|thumb|Pixel aspect ratio 2:1]]
'''Pixel aspect ratio''' (often abbreviated '''PAR''') is a mathematical [[ratio]] that describes how the width of a [[pixel]] in a [[digital image]] compares to the height of that pixel.

Most [[digital imaging]] systems display an image as a grid of tiny, square pixels. However, some imaging systems, especially those that must be compatible with [[standard-definition television]] motion pictures, display an image as a grid of rectangular pixels, in which the pixel width and height are different. Pixel aspect ratio describes this difference.

Use of pixel aspect ratio mostly involves pictures pertaining to standard-definition television and some other exceptional cases. Most other imaging systems, including those that comply with [[SMPTE]] standards and practices, use square pixels.

== Introduction ==
The ratio of the width to the height of an image is known as the [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]], or more precisely the '''display aspect ratio''' (DAR) – the aspect ratio of the image ''as displayed;'' for TV, DAR was traditionally 4:3 (a.k.a. fullscreen), with 16:9 (a.k.a. widescreen) now the standard for HDTV. In [[digital image]]s, there is a distinction with the '''[[storage aspect ratio]]''' (SAR), which is the ratio of [[pixel dimensions]]. If an image is displayed with square pixels, then these ratios agree; if not, then non-square, "rectangular" pixels are used, and these ratios disagree. The aspect ratio of the pixels themselves is known as the ''pixel aspect ratio'' (PAR) – for square pixels this is 1:1 – and these are related by the identity:
:SAR&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;PAR&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;DAR.

Rearranging (solving for PAR) yields:
:PAR&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;DAR/SAR.

For example, a 640&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;480 [[VGA]] image has a SAR of 640/480 = 4:3, and if displayed on a 4:3 display (DAR = 4:3) has square pixels, hence a PAR of 1:1. By contrast, a 720&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;576 [[D-1 (Sony)|D-1]] PAL image has a SAR of 720/576 = 5:4, but is displayed on a 4:3 display (DAR = 4:3).

In analog images such as film there is no notion of pixel, nor notion of SAR or PAR, but in the ''digitization'' of analog images the resulting digital image has pixels, hence SAR (and accordingly PAR, if displayed at the same aspect ratio as the original).

Non-square pixels arise often in early digital TV standards, related to digitalization of analog TV signals – whose vertical and "effective" horizontal resolutions differ and are thus best described by non-square pixels – and also in some digital video cameras and computer [[display mode]]s, such as [[Color Graphics Adapter]] (CGA). Today they arise also in [[transcoding]] between resolutions with different SARs.

Actual displays do not generally have non-square pixels, though digital sensors might; they are rather a mathematical abstraction used in resampling images to convert between resolutions.

There are several complicating factors in understanding PAR, particularly as it pertains to digitization of analog video:
* First, analog video does not have pixels, but rather a [[raster scan]], and thus has a well-defined vertical resolution (the lines of the raster), but not a well-defined ''horizontal'' resolution, since each line is an analog signal. However, by a standardized sampling rate, the effective horizontal resolution can be determined by the [[sampling theorem]], as is done below.
* Second, due to [[overscan]], some of the lines at the top and bottom of the raster are not visible, as are some of the possible image on the left and right – see [[Overscan#Analog to digital resolution issues|Overscan: Analog to digital resolution issues]]. Also, the resolution may be rounded (DV NTSC uses 480 lines, rather than the 486 that are possible).
* Third, analog video signals are ''interlaced'' – each image (frame) is sent as two "fields", each with ''half'' the lines. Thus pixels are either twice as tall as they would be without interlacing, or the image is deinterlaced.

==Background==
{{see also|Aspect ratio (image)#Distinctions}}
[[Video]] is presented as a sequential series of images called video frames. Historically, video frames were created and recorded in analog form. As digital display technology, digital broadcast technology, and digital [[video compression]] evolved separately, it resulted in video frame differences that must be addressed using pixel aspect ratio. Digital video frames are generally defined as a grid of pixels used to present each sequential image. The horizontal component is defined by pixels (or samples), and is known as a video line. The vertical component is defined by the number of lines, as in 480 lines.

[[Standard-definition television]] standards and practices were developed as broadcast technologies and intended for terrestrial broadcasting, and were therefore not designed for digital video presentation. Such standards define an image as an array of well-defined horizontal "'''[[Line (video)|Line]]s'''", well-defined vertical "'''Line Duration'''" and a well-defined picture center. However, there is not a standard-definition television standard that properly defines image edges or explicitly demands a certain number of picture elements per line. Furthermore, analog video systems such as [[NTSC]] [[480i]] and [[PAL]] [[576i]], instead of employing progressively displayed frames, employ [[Field (video)|fields]] or interlaced half-frames displayed in an interwoven manner to reduce flicker and double the image rate for smoother motion.

===Analog-to-digital conversion {{anchor|parrec601}} ===
As a result of computers becoming powerful enough to serve as [[video editing]] tools, video [[digital-to-analog converter]]s and [[analog-to-digital converter]]s were made to overcome this incompatibility. To convert analog video lines into a series of square pixels, the industry adopted a default sampling rate at which [[Luma (video)|luma]] values were extracted into pixels. The luma sampling rate for [[480i]] pictures was '''{{frac|12|3|11}}&amp;nbsp;MHz''' and for 576i pictures was '''{{frac|14|3|4}}&amp;nbsp;MHz'''.

The term ''pixel aspect ratio'' was first coined when [[Rec. 601|ITU-R BT.601]] (commonly known as "[[Rec. 601]]") specified that standard-definition television pictures are made of lines of exactly 720 non-square pixels. ITU-R BT.601 did not define the exact pixel aspect ratio but did provide enough information to calculate the exact pixel aspect ratio based on industry practices: The standard luma sampling rate of precisely {{frac|13|1|2}}&amp;nbsp;MHz. Based on this information:
*The pixel aspect ratio for [[480i]] would be 10:11 as:
*: &lt;math&gt;12\tfrac{3}{11} \div 13\tfrac{1}{2} = \tfrac{10}{11}&lt;/math&gt;
*The pixel aspect ratio for [[576i]] would be 59:54 as:
*: &lt;math&gt;14\tfrac{3}{4}  \div 13\tfrac{1}{2} = \tfrac{59}{54}&lt;/math&gt;

SMPTE RP 187 further attempted to standardize the pixel aspect ratio values for [[480i]] and [[576i]]. It designated 177:160 for [[480i]] or 1035:1132 for [[576i]]. However, due to significant difference with practices in effect by industry and the computational load that they imposed upon the involved hardware, SMPTE RP 187 was simply ignored. SMPTE RP 187 information annex A.4 further suggested the use of 10:11 for [[480i]].

As of this writing, ITU-R BT.601-6, which is the latest edition of ITU-R BT.601, still implies that the pixel aspect ratios mentioned above are correct.

===Digital video processing {{anchor|pardigital}}===
As stated above, ITU-R BT.601 specified that standard-definition television pictures are made of lines of 720 non-square pixels, sampled with a precisely specified sampling rate. A simple mathematical calculation reveals that a 704 pixel width would be enough to contain a [[480i]] or [[576i]] standard 4:3 picture:

* A 4:3 480-line picture, digitized with the Rec. 601-recommended sampling rate, would be 704 non-square pixels wide.
*: &lt;math&gt;\frac{x}{480}\times \frac{10}{11} = \frac{4}{3}\Rightarrow x = \frac{480\times 11\times 4}{10\times 3} = 704&lt;/math&gt;
* A 4:3 576-line picture, digitized with the Rec. 601-recommended sampling rate, would be 702.915254 non-square pixels wide.
*: &lt;math&gt;\frac{x}{576}\times \frac{59}{54} = \frac{4}{3}\Rightarrow x = \frac{576\times 54\times 4}{59\times 3} \approx 702.915254&lt;/math&gt;

Unfortunately, not all standard TV pictures are exactly 4:3: As mentioned earlier, in analog video, the center of a picture is well-defined but the edges of the picture are not standardized. As a result, some analog devices (mostly PAL devices but also some NTSC devices) generated motion pictures that were horizontally (slightly) wider. This also proportionately applies to [[anamorphic widescreen]] (16:9) pictures. Therefore, to maintain a safe margin of error, ITU-R BT.601 required sampling 16 more non-square pixels per line (8 more at each edge) to ensure saving all video data near the margins.

This requirement, however, had implications for PAL motion pictures. PAL pixel aspect ratios for standard (4:3) and anamorphic wide screen (16:9), respectively 59:54 and 118:81, were awkward for digital image processing, especially for mixing PAL and NTSC video clips. Therefore, video editing products chose the almost equivalent values, respectively 12:11 and 16:11, which were more elegant and could create PAL digital images at exactly 704 pixels wide, as illustrated:
* For PAL 4:3:
*: &lt;math&gt;\frac{4}{3}\div \frac{704}{576} = \color{blue}{\frac{12}{11}}&lt;/math&gt;
* For PAL 16:9:
*: &lt;math&gt;\frac{16}{9}\div \frac{704}{576} = \color{blue}{\frac{16}{11}}&lt;/math&gt;

==Inconsistency in defined pixel aspect ratio values==
Commonly found on the Internet and in various other published media are numerous sources that introduce different and highly incompatible values as the pixel aspect ratios of various video pictures and video systems. (See the [[#Supplementary sources|Supplementary sources]] section.)

To neutrally judge the accuracy and/or feasibility of these sources, please note that as the digital motion picture was invented years after the traditional motion picture, all video pictures targeted for standard definition television and compatible media, digital or otherwise, have (and must have) specifications compatible with standard definition television. Therefore, the pixel aspect ratio of digital video must be calculated from the specification of common traditional equipment rather than the specifications of digital video. Otherwise, any pixel aspect ratio that is calculated from a digital video source is only usable in certain cases for the same kind of video sources and cannot be considered/used as a general pixel aspect ratio of any standard definition television system.

In addition, unlike digital video that has well-defined picture edges, traditional video systems have never standardized a well-defined edge for the picture. Therefore, the pixel aspect ratio of common standard television systems cannot be calculated based on edges of pictures. Such a calculated aspect ratio value would not be entirely wrong, but also cannot be considered as the general pixel aspect ratio of any specific video system. The use of such values would be restricted only to certain cases.

==Modern standards and practices==
In modern digital imaging systems and [[high-definition television]]s, especially those that comply with SMPTE standards and practices, only square pixels are used for broadcast and display. However, some formats (ex., [[HDV]], [[DVCPRO HD]]) use non-square pixels internally for image storage, as a way to reduce the amount of data that must be processed, thus limiting the necessary transfer rates and maintaining compatibility with existing interfaces.

==Issues of non-square pixels==
Directly mapping an image with a certain pixel aspect ratio on a device whose pixel aspect ratio is different makes the image look unnaturally stretched or squashed in either the horizontal or vertical direction. For example, a circle generated for a computer display with square pixels looks like a vertical ellipse on a standard-definition NTSC television that uses vertically rectangular pixels. This issue is more evident on wide-screen TVs.

Pixel aspect ratio must be taken into consideration by video editing software products that edit video files with non-square pixels, especially when mixing video clips with different pixel aspect ratios. This would be the case when creating a video montage from various cameras employing different video standards (a relatively rare situation). Special effects software products must also take the pixel aspect ratio into consideration, since some special effects require calculation of the distances from a certain point so that they look visually correct. An example of such effects would be radial blur, motion blur, or even a simple image rotation.

==Use of pixel aspect ratio==
Pixel aspect ratio value is used mainly in digital video software, where motion pictures must be converted or reconditioned to use video systems other than the original. The [[Media player (application software)|video player]] software may use pixel aspect ratio to properly render digital video on screen. Video editing software uses pixel aspect ratio to properly [[Image scaling|scale]] and render a video into a new format.

The pixel aspect ratio support is also required to display, without distortion, legacy digital images from computer standards and video-games what existed in the 80s. In that generation, square pixels were too expensive to produce, so machines and video cards like the SNES, CGA, EGA, Hercules, C64, MSX, PC-88, X68000 etc had non-square pixels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pineight.com/mw/index.php?title=Dot_clock_rates|title=Dot clock rates|publisher=pineight.com|date=|accessdate=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Confusion with display aspect ratio==
{{main|Aspect ratio (image)}}
[[File:Screenshot of DVD Flick 1.3.0.7 build 738.png|thumb|300px|DVD Flick 1.3.0.7: Example of a computer program that has mislabeled ''picture aspect ratio'' as ''pixel aspect ratio'']]
Pixel aspect ratio is often confused with different types of image aspect ratios; the ratio of the image width and height. Due to non-squareness of pixels in Standard-definition TV, there are two types of such aspect ratios: ''storage aspect ratio'' (''SAR'') and ''[[display aspect ratio]]'' (abbreviated ''DAR'', also known as ''[[image aspect ratio]]'' and ''[[picture aspect ratio]]''). Note the reuse of the abbreviation ''PAR''. This article uses only the terms pixel aspect ratio and display aspect ratio to avoid ambiguity.

Storage aspect ratio is the ratio of the image width to height in pixels, and can be easily calculated from the video file. Display aspect ratio is the ratio of image width to height (in a unit of length such as centimeters or inches) when displayed on screen, and is calculated from the combination of pixel aspect ratio and storage aspect ratio.

However, users who know the definition of these concepts may get confused as well. Poorly crafted user-interfaces or poorly written documentations can easily cause such confusion: Some video-editing software applications often ask users to specify an "aspect ratio" for their video file, presenting him or her with the choices of "4:3" and "16:9". Sometimes, these choices may be "PAL 4:3", "NTSC 4:3", "PAL 16:9" and "NTSC 16:9". In such situations, the video editing program is implicitly asking for the pixel aspect ratio of the video file by asking for information about the video system from which the video file originated. The program then uses a table (similar to the one below) to determine the correct pixel aspect ratio value.

Generally speaking, to avoid confusion, it can be assumed that video editing products never ask for the storage aspect ratio as they can directly retrieve or calculate it. Non-square-pixel–aware applications also need only to ask for either pixel aspect ratio or display aspect ratio, from either of which they can calculate the other.

==Pixel aspect ratios of common video formats&lt;!-- For PAL you included both the MPEG-4 and MPEG-2 options, but for NTSC you gave only the MPEG-4 option. I would appreciate it if the MPEG-2 PAR values for NTSC (32:27 for 16:9 and 8:9 for 4:3 were included)  Thnx --&gt;==
Pixel aspect ratio values for common standard-definition video formats are listed below. Note that for PAL video formats, two different types of pixel aspect ratio values are listed:
#''[[#parrec601|Rec.601]]'', a Rec.601-compliant value, which is considered the real pixel aspect ratio of standard-definition video of that type.
#''[[#pardigital|Digital]]'', which is roughly equivalent to Rec.601 and is more suitable to use in Digital Video Editing software.

Note that sources differ on PARs for common formats – for example, 576 lines (PAL) displayed at 4:3 (DAR) corresponds to either PAR of 12:11 (if 704×576, SAR = 11:9), or a PAR of 16:15 (if 720×576, SAR = 5:4). See [[#References|references]] for sources giving both, and [[Standard-definition television#Resolution|SDTV: Resolution]] for a table of storage, display and pixel aspect ratios.

== Life and work ==
Kambalu was born in Malawi, where he attended [[Kamuzu Academy]], the "Eton of Africa".&lt;ref&gt;[[Kamuzu Academy]]&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from the [[University of Malawi]]'s Chancellor College, [[Zomba, Malawi|Zomba]] in 1999.  Kambalu completed his MA in Fine Art at [[Nottingham Trent University]] in 2003 and wrote his PhD at [[Chelsea College of Art and Design]], looking at how the problematic of the gift and the general economy animates various aspects of his art practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.arts.ac.uk/chelsea/2015/04/01/phd-student-samson-kambalu-to-exhibit-at-venice-2015/|title=PhD student Samson Kambalu to exhibit at Venice 2015 – Chelsea College of Arts Blog|website=blogs.arts.ac.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sieve of Eratosthenes animation.gif|right|frame|Sieve of Eratosthenes: algorithm steps for primes below 121 (including optimization of starting from prime's square).]]

In [[mathematics]], the '''[[Sieve theory|sieve]] of Eratosthenes''' is a simple, ancient [[algorithm]] for finding all [[prime number]]s up to any given limit.

It does so by iteratively marking as [[composite number|composite]] (i.e., not prime) the multiples of each prime, starting with the first prime number, {{math|2}}. The multiples of a given prime are generated as a sequence of numbers starting from that prime, with [[arithmetic progression|constant difference between them]] that is equal to that prime.&lt;ref name="horsley"&gt;Horsley, Rev. Samuel, F. R. S., "''{{lang|el|Κόσκινον Ερατοσθένους}}'' or, The Sieve of Eratosthenes. Being an account of his method of finding all the Prime Numbers," [https://www.jstor.org/stable/106053 ''Philosophical Transactions'' (1683–1775), Vol. 62. (1772), pp. 327–347].&lt;/ref&gt; This is the sieve's key distinction from using [[trial division]] to sequentially test each candidate number for divisibility by each prime.&lt;ref name="ONeill" /&gt;

The earliest known reference to the sieve ({{lang-grc|κόσκινον Ἐρατοσθένους}}, ''kóskinon Eratosthénous'') is in [[Nicomachus|Nicomachus of Gerasa]]'s ''[[Introduction to Arithmetic]]'',&lt;ref name=nicomachus&gt;{{citation|editor-first=Richard|editor-last=Hoche|editor-link=Richard Hoche|title=Nicomachi Geraseni Pythagorei Introductionis arithmeticae libri II|year=1866|location= Leipzig|publisher= B.G. Teubner|page=31|url=https://archive.org/stream/nicomachigerasen00nicouoft#page/30/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; which describes it and attributes it to [[Eratosthenes|Eratosthenes of Cyrene]], a [[Greek mathematics|Greek mathematician]].

One of a number of [[Generating primes#Prime sieves|prime number sieve]]s, it is one of the most efficient ways to find all of the smaller primes. It may be used to find primes in [[arithmetic progression]]s.&lt;ref&gt;J. C. Morehead, "Extension of the Sieve of Eratosthenes to arithmetical progressions and applications", [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1967477 Annals of Mathematics, Second Series '''10''':2 (1909), pp. 88–104].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
{{quote box|fontsize = 105%|''Sift the Two's and Sift the Three's,''&lt;br /&gt;''The Sieve of Eratosthenes.''&lt;br /&gt;''When the multiples sublime,''&lt;br /&gt;''The numbers that remain are Prime.''|quoted=1|salign=center|source=Anonymous&lt;ref&gt;Clocksin, William F., Christopher S. Mellish, Programming in Prolog, 1984, p.&amp;nbsp;170. {{isbn|3-540-11046-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A [[prime number]] is a [[natural number]] that has exactly two distinct natural number [[divisor]]s: [[1 (number)|1]] and itself.

To find all the prime numbers less than or equal to a given integer {{mvar|n}} by Eratosthenes' method:

# Create a list of consecutive integers from 2 through {{mvar|n}}: {{math|(2, 3, 4, ..., ''n'')}}.
# Initially, let {{mvar|p}} equal 2, the smallest prime number.
# Enumerate the multiples of {{mvar|p}} by counting in increments of {{mvar|p}} from {{math|2''p''}} to {{mvar|n}}, and mark them in the list (these will be {{math|2''p'', 3''p'', 4''p'', ...}}; the {{mvar|p}} itself should not be marked). 
# Find the first number greater than {{mvar|p}} in the list that is not marked. If there was no such number, stop. Otherwise, let {{mvar|p}} now equal this new number (which is the next prime), and repeat from step 3.
# When the algorithm terminates, the numbers remaining not marked in the list are all the primes below {{mvar|n}}.

The main idea here is that every value given to {{mvar|p}} will be prime, because if it were composite it would be marked as a multiple of some other, smaller prime. Note that some of the numbers may be marked more than once (e.g., 15 will be marked both for 3 and 5).

As a refinement, it is sufficient to mark the numbers in step 3 starting from {{math|''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, as all the smaller multiples of {{mvar|p}} will have already been marked at that point. This means that the algorithm is allowed to terminate in step 4 when {{math|''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is greater than {{mvar|n}}.&lt;ref name="horsley" /&gt; &lt;!-- This does not appear in the algorithm as described by Nicomachus.&lt;ref&gt;Nicomachus, ibid., p.&amp;nbsp;31, where, e.g., 93 is marked as a multiple of 31.&lt;/ref&gt; ---- The above is based on wrong reading of the table in Nicomachus p.&amp;nbsp;31: main factors actually appear in upper row in cells, and their corresponding coefficients in the bottom row; 5 first appears in bottom row for 15 but in top row for 25, and 7 for 49. For 93, 31 is marked in bottom row, below 3. (He also marks 81 as 9*9 and 3*27, so wasn't working with only prime factors, but that's besides the point here.) What the text is saying in Latin or Greek, I have no idea. --&gt;

Another refinement is to initially list odd numbers only, {{math|(3, 5, ..., ''n'')}}, and count in increments of {{math|2''p''}} from {{math|''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} in step 3, thus marking only odd multiples of {{mvar|p}}. This actually appears in the original algorithm.&lt;ref name="horsley" /&gt; &lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;Nicomachus, ibid., p.&amp;nbsp;31, where only odd numbers appear in the table.&lt;/ref&gt; Again, the table is not by Nicomachus; it is in the margins, and in Latin. --&gt; This can be generalized with [[wheel factorization]], forming the initial list only from numbers [[coprime]] with the first few primes and not just from odds (i.e., numbers coprime with 2), and counting in the correspondingly adjusted increments so that only such multiples of {{mvar|p}} are generated that are coprime with those small primes, in the first place.&lt;ref name="Runciman"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0956796897002670| title = Functional Pearl: Lazy wheel sieves and spirals of primes| journal = J.

===Example===
To find all the prime numbers less than or equal to 30, proceed as follows.

First, generate a list of integers from 2 to 30:

 &amp;nbsp;2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30

The first number in the list is 2; cross out every 2nd number in the list after 2 by counting up from 2 in increments of 2 (these will be all the multiples of 2 in the list):

 &amp;nbsp;2  3 {{gray|&lt;s&gt; 4 &lt;/s&gt;}} 5 {{gray|&lt;s&gt; 6 &lt;/s&gt;}} 7 {{gray|&lt;s&gt; 8 &lt;/s&gt;}} 9  {{gray|&lt;s&gt;10&lt;/s&gt;}} 11 {{gray|&lt;s&gt;12&lt;/s&gt;}} 13 {{gray|&lt;s&gt;14&lt;/s&gt;}} 15 {{gray|&lt;s&gt;16&lt;/s&gt;}} 17 {{gray|&lt;s&gt;18&lt;/s&gt;}} 19 {{gray|&lt;s&gt;20&lt;/s&gt;}} 21 {{gray|&lt;s&gt;22&lt;/s&gt;}} 23 {{gray|&lt;s&gt;24&lt;/s&gt;}} 25 {{gray|&lt;s&gt;26&lt;/s&gt;}} 27 {{gray|&lt;s&gt;28&lt;/s&gt;}} 29 {{gray|&lt;s&gt;30&lt;/s&gt;}}

The next number in the list after 2 is 3; cross out every 3rd number in the list after 3 by counting up from 3 in increments of 3 (these will be all the multiples of 3 in the list):

 &amp;nbsp;2  3 {{gray|&lt;s&gt; 4 &lt;/s&gt;}} 5 {{gray|&lt;s&gt; 6 &lt;/s&gt;}} 7 {{gray|&lt;s&gt; 8 &lt;/s&gt;}}{{gray|&lt;s&gt; 9 &lt;/s&gt;}}{{gray|&lt;s&gt; 10&lt;/s&gt;}} 11 {{gray|&lt;s&gt;12&lt;/s&gt;}} 13 {{gray|&lt;s&gt;14 &lt;/s&gt;}}{{gray|&lt;s&gt;15 &lt;/s&gt;}}{{gray|&lt;s&gt;16&lt;/s&gt;}} 17 {{gray|&lt;s&gt;18&lt;/s&gt;}} 19 {{gray|&lt;s&gt;20 &lt;/s&gt;}}{{gray|&lt;s&gt;21 &lt;/s&gt;}}{{gray|&lt;s&gt;22&lt;/s&gt;}} 23 {{gray|&lt;s&gt;24&lt;/s&gt;}} 25 {{gray|&lt;s&gt;26 &lt;/s&gt;}}{{gray|&lt;s&gt;27 &lt;/s&gt;}}{{gray|&lt;s&gt;28&lt;/s&gt;}} 29 {{gray|&lt;s&gt;30&lt;/s&gt;}}

The next number not yet crossed out in the list after 3 is 5; cross out every 5th number in the list after 5 by counting up from 5 in increments of 5 (i.e. all the multiples of 5):

 &amp;nbsp;2  3 {{gray|&lt;s&gt; 4 &lt;/s&gt;}} 5 {{gray|&lt;s&gt; 6 &lt;/s&gt;}} 7 {{gray|&lt;s&gt; 8 &lt;/s&gt;}}{{gray|&lt;s&gt; 9 &lt;/s&gt;}}{{gray|&lt;s&gt; 10&lt;/s&gt;}} 11 {{gray|&lt;s&gt;12&lt;/s&gt;}} 13 {{gray|&lt;s&gt;14 &lt;/s&gt;}}{{gray|&lt;s&gt;15 &lt;/s&gt;}}{{gray|&lt;s&gt;16&lt;/s&gt;}} 17 {{gray|&lt;s&gt;18&lt;/s&gt;}} 19 {{gray|&lt;s&gt;20 &lt;/s&gt;}}{{gray|&lt;s&gt;21 &lt;/s&gt;}}{{gray|&lt;s&gt;22&lt;/s&gt;}} 23 {{gray|&lt;s&gt;24 &lt;/s&gt;}}{{gray|&lt;s&gt;25 &lt;/s&gt;}}{{gray|&lt;s&gt;26 &lt;/s&gt;}}{{gray|&lt;s&gt;27 &lt;/s&gt;}}{{gray|&lt;s&gt;28&lt;/s&gt;}} 29 {{gray|&lt;s&gt;30&lt;/s&gt;}}

The next number not yet crossed out in the list after 5 is 7; the next step would be to cross out every 7th number in the list after 7, but they are all already crossed out at this point, as these numbers (14, 21, 28) are also multiples of smaller primes because 7 × 7 is greater than 30. The numbers not crossed out at this point in the list are all the prime numbers below 30:

 &amp;nbsp;2  3     5     7           11    13          17    19          23                29

==Algorithm and variants==
===Pseudocode===
The sieve of Eratosthenes can be expressed in [[pseudocode]], as follows:&lt;ref name="sedgewick"&gt;{{cite book
|last1=Sedgewick |first1=Robert |title=Algorithms in C++
|publisher=Addison-Wesley |year=1992 |isbn=0-201-51059-6 
}}, p.&amp;nbsp;16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="intro"&gt;[http://research.cs.wisc.edu/techreports/1990/TR909.pdf Jonathan Sorenson, An Introduction to Prime Number Sieves], Computer Sciences Technical Report #909, Department of Computer Sciences University of Wisconsin-Madison, January 2, 1990 (the use of optimization of starting from squares, and thus using only the numbers whose square is below the upper limit, is shown).&lt;/ref&gt;

 &amp;nbsp;'''Input''': an integer ''n'' &gt; 1.
 &amp;nbsp;&lt;!-- these &amp;nbsp;s prevent bots messing it up --&gt;
 &amp;nbsp;'''Let''' ''A'' be an '''array of [[Boolean data type|Boolean]]''' values, indexed by '''integer'''s 2 to ''n'',
 &amp;nbsp;initially all '''set''' to '''true'''.
 &amp;nbsp;
 &amp;nbsp;'''for''' ''i'' = 2, 3, 4, ..., not exceeding {{math|''{{sqrt|n}}''}}:
 &amp;nbsp;  '''if''' ''A''[''i''] '''is''' '''true''':
 &amp;nbsp;    '''for''' ''j'' = ''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+''i'', ''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+2''i'', ''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+3''i'', ..., not exceeding ''n'':
 &amp;nbsp;      ''A''[''j''] := '''false'''.
 &amp;nbsp;
 &amp;nbsp;'''Output''': all ''i'' such that ''A''[''i''] '''is''' '''true'''.

This algorithm produces all primes not greater than {{mvar|n}}. It includes a common optimization, which is to start enumerating the multiples of each prime {{mvar|i}} from {{math|''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The [[time complexity]] of this algorithm is {{math|''O''(''n'' log log ''n'')}},{{r|intro}} provided the array update is an {{math|''O''(1)}} operation, as is usually the case.

===Segmented sieve===
As Sorenson notes, the problem with the sieve of Eratosthenes is not the number of operations it performs but rather its memory requirements.{{r|intro}} For large {{mvar|n}}, the range of primes may not fit in memory; worse, even for moderate {{mvar|n}}, its [[CPU cache|cache]] use is highly suboptimal. The algorithm walks through the entire array {{mvar|A}}, exhibiting almost no [[locality of reference]].

A solution to these problems is offered by ''segmented'' sieves, where only portions of the range are sieved at a time.&lt;ref&gt;Crandall &amp; Pomerance, ''Prime Numbers: A Computational Perspective'', second edition, Springer: 2005, pp. 121–24.&lt;/ref&gt; These have been known since the 1970s, and work as follows:{{r|intro}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bays | first1 = Carter | last2 = Hudson | first2 = Richard H. | year = 1977 | title = The segmented sieve of Eratosthenes and primes in arithmetic progressions to 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; | journal = BIT | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 121–127 | publisher = | jstor = | doi = 10.1007/BF01932283 | url = | format = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Divide the range 2 through {{mvar|n}} into segments of some size {{math|Δ ≤ {{sqrt|''n''}}}}.
# Find the primes in the first (i.e. the lowest) segment, using the regular sieve.
# For each of the following segments, in increasing order, with {{mvar|m}} being the segment's topmost value, find the primes in it as follows:
## Set up a Boolean array of size {{math|Δ}}, and
## Eliminate from it the multiples of each prime {{math|''p'' ≤ {{sqrt|''m''}}}} found so far, by calculating the lowest multiple of {{math|''p''}} between {{math|{{mvar|m}} - Δ}} and {{mvar|m}}, and enumerating its multiples in steps of {{math|''p''}} as usual, marking the corresponding positions in the array as non-prime.

If {{math|Δ}} is chosen to be {{math|{{sqrt|''n''}}}}, the space complexity of the algorithm is {{math|''O''({{sqrt|''n''}})}}, while the time complexity is the same as that of the regular sieve.{{r|intro}}

For ranges with upper limit {{math|''n''}} so large that the sieving primes below {{math|{{sqrt|''n''}}}} as required by the page segmented sieve of Eratosthenes cannot fit in memory, a slower but much more space-efficient sieve like the [[sieve of Sorenson]] can be used instead.&lt;ref&gt;J. Sorenson, [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.94.1737 The pseudosquares prime sieve], Proceedings of the 7th International Symposium on Algorithmic Number Theory. (ANTS-VII, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incremental sieve===
An incremental formulation of the sieve&lt;ref name="ONeill"&gt;O'Neill, Melissa E., [http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~oneill/papers/Sieve-JFP.pdf "The Genuine Sieve of Eratosthenes"], Journal of Functional Programming, Published online by Cambridge University Press 9 October 2008 {{doi|10.1017/S0956796808007004}}, pp. 10, 11 (contains two incremental sieves in Haskell: a priority-queue–based one by O'Neill and a list–based, by Richard Bird).&lt;/ref&gt; generates primes indefinitely (i.e., without an upper bound) by interleaving the generation of primes with the generation of their multiples (so that primes can be found in gaps between the multiples), where the multiples of each prime {{mvar|p}} are generated directly by counting up from the square of the prime in increments of {{mvar|p}} (or {{math|2''p''}} for odd primes). The generation must be initiated only when the prime's square is reached, to avoid adverse effects on efficiency. It can be expressed symbolically under the [[Dataflow programming|dataflow]] paradigm as

   ''primes'' = [''2'', ''3'', ...] \ [[''p''², ''p''²+''p'', ...] for ''p'' in ''primes''],

using [[list comprehension]] notation with &lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt; denoting [[Complement (set theory)#Relative complement|set subtraction]] of [[arithmetic progressions]] of numbers.

Primes can also be produced by iteratively sieving out the composites through [[Trial division|divisibility testing]] by sequential primes, one prime at a time. It is not the sieve of Eratosthenes but is often confused with it, even though the sieve of Eratosthenes directly generates the composites instead of testing for them. Trial division has worse theoretical [[Analysis of algorithms|complexity]] than that of the sieve of Eratosthenes in generating ranges of primes.&lt;ref name="ONeill"/&gt;

When testing each prime, the ''optimal'' trial division algorithm uses all prime numbers not exceeding its square root, whereas the sieve of Eratosthenes produces each composite from its prime factors only, and gets the primes "for free", between the composites.

==Computational analysis==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2015}}
The work performed by this algorithm is almost entirely the operations to cull the composite number representations which for the basic non-optimized version is the sum of the range divided by each of the primes up to that range or
:&lt;math&gt;n\sum_{p\le n}\frac1p,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|n}} is the sieving range in this and all further analysis.

By rearranging [[Mertens' theorems|Mertens' second theorem]], this is equal to {{math|''n'' ( log log ''n'' + ''M'' )}} as {{mvar|n}} approaches infinity, where M is the [[Meissel–Mertens constant]] of about {{val|0.2614972128476427837554268386086958590516}}...

The optimization of starting at the square of each prime and only culling for primes less than the square root changes the "{{math|''n''}}" in the above expression to {{math|{{sqrt|''n''}}}} (or {{math|''n''&lt;sup&gt;{{sfrac|1|2}}&lt;/sup&gt;}}) and not culling until the square means that the sum of the base primes each minus two is subtracted from the operations. As the sum of the first {{math|''x''}} primes is {{math|{{sfrac|1|2}}''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; log ''x''}}&lt;ref&gt;E. Bach and J. Shallit, §2.7 in Algorithmic Number Theory, Vol. 1: Efficient Algorithms, MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[prime number theorem]] says that {{math|''x''}} is approximately {{math|{{sfrac|''x''|log ''x''}}}}, then the sum of primes to {{math|''n''}} is {{math|{{sfrac|''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|2 log ''n''}}}}, and therefore the sum of base primes to {{math|{{sqrt|''n''}}}} is {{math|{{sfrac|1|log ''n''}}}} expressed as a factor of {{math|''n''}}. The extra offset of two per base prime is {{math|2''π''({{sqrt|''n''}})}}, where {{mvar|π}} is the [[prime-counting function]] in this case, or {{math|{{sfrac|4{{sqrt|''n''}}|log ''n''}}}}; expressing this as a factor of {{math|''n''}} as are the other terms, this is {{math|{{sfrac|4|{{sqrt|''n''}} log ''n''}}}}. Combining all of this, the expression for the number of optimized operations without wheel factorization is
:&lt;math&gt;\log\log n-\frac1{\log n}\left(1-\frac{4}{\sqrt{n}}\right)+M-\log 2.&lt;/math&gt;

For the wheel factorization cases, there is a further offset of the operations not done of
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{p\le x}\frac1p&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''x''}} is the highest wheel prime and a constant factor of the whole expression is applied which is the fraction of remaining prime candidates as compared to the repeating wheel circumference. The wheel circumference is
:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{p\le x}p&lt;/math&gt;
and it can easily be determined that this wheel factor is
:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{p\le x}\frac{p-1}{p}&lt;/math&gt;
as {{math|{{sfrac|''p'' − 1|''p''}}}} is the fraction of remaining candidates for the highest wheel prime, {{math|''x''}}, and each succeeding smaller prime leaves its corresponding fraction of the previous combined fraction.

Combining all of the above analysis, the total number of operations for a sieving range up to {{math|''n''}} including wheel factorization for primes up to {{math|''x''}} is approximately

:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{p\le x}\frac{p-1}{p}\left(\log\log n-\frac1{\log n}\left(1-\frac{4}{\sqrt{n}}\right)+M-\log 2-\sum_{p\le x}\frac1p\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

To show that the above expression is a good approximation to the number of composite number cull operations performed by the algorithm, following is a table showing the actually measured number of operations for a practical implementation of the sieve of Eratosthenes as compared to the number of operations predicted from the above expression with both expressed as a fraction of the range (rounded to four decimal places) for different sieve ranges and wheel factorizations (Note that the last column is a maximum practical wheel as to the size of the wheel gaps Look Up Table - almost 10 million values):

The above table shows that the above expression is a very good approximation to the total number of culling operations for sieve ranges of about a hundred thousand (10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;) and above.

==Algorithmic complexity==
The sieve of Eratosthenes is a popular way to benchmark computer performance.&lt;ref name="peng1985fall"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1985-11/1985_11_BYTE_10-11_Inside_the_IBM_PCs#page/n245/mode/2up | title=One Million Primes Through the Sieve | work=BYTE | date=Fall 1985 | accessdate=19 March 2016 | author=Peng, T. A. | pages=243–244}}&lt;/ref&gt; As can be seen from the above by removing all constant offsets and constant factors and ignoring terms that tend to zero as n approaches infinity, the [[time complexity]] of calculating all primes below {{mvar|n}} in the [[random access machine]] model is {{math|''O''(''n'' log log ''n'')}} operations, a direct consequence of the fact that the [[prime harmonic series]] asymptotically approaches {{math|log log ''n''}}. It has an exponential time complexity with regard to input size, though, which makes it a [[Pseudo-polynomial time|pseudo-polynomial]] algorithm. The basic algorithm requires {{math|''O''(''n'')}} of memory.

The [[bit complexity]] of the algorithm is {{math|''O''&lt;big&gt;(&lt;/big&gt;''n'' (log ''n'') (log log ''n'')&lt;big&gt;)&lt;/big&gt;}} bit operations with a memory requirement of {{math|''O''(''n'')}}.&lt;ref&gt;Pritchard, Paul, "Linear prime-number sieves: a family tree," ''Sci. Comput. Programming'' '''9''':1 (1987), pp. 17–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

The normally implemented page segmented version has the same operational complexity of {{math|''O''(''n'' log log ''n'')}} as the non-segmented version but reduces the space requirements to the very minimal size of the segment page plus the memory required to store the base primes less than the square root of the range used to cull composites from successive page segments of size {{math|''O''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;(&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;{{sfrac|{{sqrt|''n''}}|log ''n''}}&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;}}.

A special rarely if ever implemented segmented version of the sieve of Eratosthenes, with basic optimizations, uses {{math|''O''(''n'')}} operations and {{math|''O''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;(&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;{{sqrt|''n''}}{{sfrac|log log ''n''|log ''n''}}&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;}} bits of memory.&lt;ref name="Pritchard1"&gt;Paul Pritchard, A sublinear additive sieve for finding prime numbers, Communications of the ACM 24 (1981), 18–23. {{MR|600730}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pritchard2"&gt;Paul Pritchard, Explaining the wheel sieve, Acta Informatica 17 (1982), 477–485. {{MR|685983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pritchard3"&gt;Paul Pritchard, Fast compact prime number sieves (among others), Journal of Algorithms 4
(1983), 332–344. {{MR|729229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To show that the above approximation in complexity is not very accurate even for about as large as practical a range, the following is a table of the estimated number of operations as a fraction of the range rounded to four places, the calculated ratio for a factor of ten change in range based on this estimate, and the factor based on the {{math|log log ''n''}} estimate for various ranges and wheel factorizations (the combo column uses a frequently practically used pre-cull by the maximum wheel factorization but only the 2/3/5/7 wheel for the wheel factor as the full factorization is difficult to implement efficiently for page segmentation):

The above shows that the {{math|log log ''n''}} estimate is not very accurate even for maximum practical ranges of about 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;. One can see why it does not match by looking at the computational analysis above and seeing that within these practical sieving range limits, there are very significant constant offset terms such that the very slowly growing {{math|log log ''n''}} term does not get large enough so as to make these terms insignificant until the sieving range approaches infinity – well beyond any practical sieving range. Within these practical ranges, these significant constant offsets mean that the performance of the Sieve of Eratosthenes is much better than one would expect just using the asymptotic time complexity estimates by a significant amount, but that also means that the slope of the performance with increasing range is steeper than predicted as the benefit of the constant offsets becomes slightly less significant.

One should also note that in using the calculated operation ratios to the sieve range, it must be less than about 0.2587 in order to be faster than the often compared [[sieve of Atkin]] if the operations take approximately the same time each in CPU clock cycles, which is a reasonable assumption for the one huge bit array algorithm. Using that assumption, the sieve of Atkin is only faster than the maximally wheel factorized sieve of Eratosthenes for ranges of over 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; at which point the huge sieve buffer array would need about a quarter of a terabyte (about 250 gigabytes) of RAM memory even if bit packing were used. An analysis of the page segmented versions will show that the assumption that the time per operation stays the same between the two algorithms does not hold for page segmentation and that the sieve of Atkin operations get slower much faster than the sieve of Eratosthenes with increasing range. Thus for practical purposes, the maximally wheel factorized Sieve of Eratosthenes is faster than the Sieve of Atkin although the Sieve of Atkin is faster for lesser amounts of wheel factorization.

Using [[big O notation]] is also not the correct way to compare practical performance of even variations of the Sieve of Eratosthenes as it ignores constant factors and offsets that may be very significant for practical ranges: The sieve of Eratosthenes variation known as the Pritchard wheel sieve&lt;ref name="Pritchard1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pritchard2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pritchard3" /&gt; has an {{math|''O''(''n'')}} performance, but its basic implementation requires either a "one large array" algorithm which limits its usable range to the amount of available memory else it needs to be page segmented to reduce memory use. When implemented with page segmentation in order to save memory, the basic algorithm still requires about {{math|''O''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;(&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;{{sfrac|''n''|log ''n''}}&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;}} bits of memory (much more than the requirement of the basic page segmented sieve of Eratosthenes using {{math|''O''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;(&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;{{sfrac|{{sqrt|''n''}}|log ''n''}}&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;}} bits of memory). Pritchard's work reduced the memory requirement to the limit as described above the table, but the cost is a fairly large constant factor of about three in execution time to about three quarters the sieve range due to the complex computations required to do so. As can be seen from the above table for the basic sieve of Eratosthenes, even though the resulting wheel sieve has {{math|''O''(''n'')}} performance and an acceptable memory requirement, it will never be faster than a reasonably Wheel Factorized basic sieve of Eratosthenes for any practical sieving range by a factor of about two. Other than that it is quite complex to implement, it is rarely practically implemented because it still uses more memory than the basic Sieve of Eratosthenes implementations described here as well as being slower for practical ranges. It is thus more of an intellectual curiosity than something practical.

==Euler's Sieve==
Euler's [[Proof of the Euler product formula for the Riemann zeta function#Proof of the Euler product formula|proof of the zeta product formula]] contains a version of the sieve of Eratosthenes in which each composite number is eliminated exactly once.&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt; The same sieve was rediscovered and observed to take [[linear time]] by {{harvtxt|Gries|Misra|1978}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

On each step the first element is identified as the next prime and the results of multiplying this prime with each element of the list are marked in the list for subsequent deletion. The initial element and the marked elements are then removed from the working sequence, and the process is repeated:
&lt;small&gt;  &lt;!-- these &amp;nbsp;s are put here hoping to prevent bots messing it up --&gt;
 &amp;nbsp;[2] (3) 5  7  &lt;u&gt;9&lt;/u&gt;  11  13 &lt;u&gt;15&lt;/u&gt; 17 19 &lt;u&gt;21&lt;/u&gt; 23 25 &lt;u&gt;27&lt;/u&gt; 29 31 &lt;u&gt;33&lt;/u&gt; 35 37 &lt;u&gt;39&lt;/u&gt; 41 43 &lt;u&gt;45&lt;/u&gt; 47 49 &lt;u&gt;51&lt;/u&gt; 53 55 &lt;u&gt;57&lt;/u&gt; 59 61 &lt;u&gt;63&lt;/u&gt; 65 67 &lt;u&gt;69&lt;/u&gt; 71 73 &lt;u&gt;75&lt;/u&gt; 77 79  ...
 &amp;nbsp;[3]    (5) 7     11  13    17 19    23 &lt;u&gt;25&lt;/u&gt;    29 31    &lt;u&gt;35&lt;/u&gt; 37    41 43    47 49    53 &lt;u&gt;55&lt;/u&gt;    59 61    &lt;u&gt;65&lt;/u&gt; 67    71 73    77 79  ...
 &amp;nbsp;[4]       (7)    11  13    17 19    23       29 31       37    41 43    47 &lt;u&gt;49&lt;/u&gt;    53       59 61       67    71 73    &lt;u&gt;77&lt;/u&gt; 79  ...
 &amp;nbsp;[5]             (11) 13    17 19    23       29 31       37    41 43    47       53       59 61       67    71 73       79  ...
 &amp;nbsp;[...]&lt;/small&gt;

Here the example is shown starting from odds, after the first step of the algorithm. Thus, on the {{mvar|k}}th step all the remaining multiples of the {{mvar|k}}th prime are removed from the list, which will thereafter contain only numbers coprime with the first {{mvar|k}} primes (cf. [[wheel factorization]]), so that the list will start with the next prime, and all the numbers in it below the square of its first element will be prime too.

Thus, when generating a bounded sequence of primes, when the next identified prime exceeds the square root of the upper limit, all the remaining numbers in the list are prime.&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt; In the example given above that is achieved on identifying 11 as next prime, giving a list of all primes less than or equal to 80.

Note that numbers that will be discarded by a step are still used while marking the multiples in that step, e.g., for the multiples of 3 it is {{nowrap|1=3 × 3 = 9}}, {{nowrap|1=3 × 5 = 15}}, {{nowrap|1=3 × 7 = 21}}, {{nowrap|1=3 × '''''9''''' = 27}}, ..., {{nowrap|1=3 × '''''15''''' = 45}}, ..., so care must be taken dealing with this.&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt;

The '''six-hour clock''' is a traditional timekeeping system used in the [[Thai language|Thai]] and formerly the [[Lao language]] and the [[Khmer language]], alongside the official [[24-hour clock]]. Like other common systems, it counts twenty-four [[hour]]s in a day, but divides the day into four quarters, counting six hours in each. The hours in each quarter (with the exception of the sixth hour in each quarter) are told with period-designating words or phrases, which are:

*... ''mong chao'' ({{lang-th|...โมงเช้า}}, {{IPA-th|mōːŋ tɕʰáːw|}}) for the first half of daytime (07:00 to 11:59)
*''Thiang'' ... (เที่ยง) for 12:00 to 12:59
*''Bai'' ... ''mong'' ({{lang|th|บ่าย...โมง}}, {{IPA|[bàːj mōːŋ]}}) for the latter half of daytime (13:00 to 18:59)
*... ''thum'' ({{lang|th|...ทุ่ม}}, {{IPA|[tʰûm]}}) for the first half of nighttime (19:00 to 23:59)
*''Thiang Khuen'' (เที่ยงคืน) 24:00
*''Ti'' ... ({{lang|th|ตี...}}, {{IPA|[tīː]}}) for the latter half of nighttime (01:00 to 06:59)

These terms are thought to have originated from the sounds of traditional timekeeping devices. The [[gong]] was used to announce the hours in daytime, and the drum at night. Hence the terms ''mong'', an [[onomatopoeia]] of the sound of the gong, and ''thum'', that of the sound of the drum. ''Ti'' is a verb meaning ''to hit or strike'', and is presumed to have originated from the act of striking the timekeeping device itself.&lt;ref name="Unlocked"&gt;{{citation|last=Thongprasert|first=Chamnong|chapter=ทุ่ม-โมง-นาฬิกา (Thum-Mong-Nalika)|title=ภาษาไทยไขขาน (Thai Unlocked)|publisher=Prae Pitaya Press|place=Bangkok|year=1985|pages=229–237|url=http://www.royin.go.th/th/knowledge/detail.php?ID=1273|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090726014744/http://www.royin.go.th/th/knowledge/detail.php?ID=1273|archivedate=2009-07-26|df=}}. {{th icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Chao'' and ''bai'' translate as ''morning'' and ''afternoon'' respectively, and help to differentiate the two daytime quarters.

The sixth hours of each quarter are told by a different set of terms. The sixth hour at dawn is called ''yam rung'' ({{lang|th|ย่ำรุ่ง}}, {{IPA|[jâm rûŋ]}}), and the sixth hour at dusk is called ''yam kham'' ({{lang|th|ย่ำค่ำ}}, {{IPA|[jâm kʰâm]}}), both references to the act of striking the gong or drum in succession to announce the turning of day (''yam''), where ''rung'' and ''kham'', meaning ''dawn'' and ''dusk'', denote the time of these occurrences. The midday and midnight hours are respectively known as ''thiang'' ({{lang|th|เที่ยง}}, {{IPA|[tʰîaːŋ]}}, or ''thiang wan'', {{lang|th|เที่ยงวัน}}, {{IPA|[tʰîaːŋ wān]}}) and ''thiang khuen'' ({{lang|th|เที่ยงคืน}}, {{IPA|[tʰîaːŋ kʰɯ̄ːn]}}), both of which literally translate as ''midday'' and ''midnight''.

Midnight is also called ''song yam'' ({{lang|th|สองยาม}}, {{IPA|[sɔ̌ːŋ jāːm]}}; note that ''yam'' is a different word), a reference to the end of the second three-hour period of the night watch (''song'' translates as the number ''two''). In addition, ''hok (6) thum'' and ''ti hok'' may also be used to refer to the hours of midnight and dawn, following general usage for the other hours, although more rarely; and the fourth to sixth hours of the second daytime half may also be told as ...''mong yen'' ({{lang|th|...โมงเย็น}}, {{IPA|[mōːŋ jēn]}}), ''yen'' meaning ''evening''.

The system has been used in some form since the days of the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]],{{citation needed|date=February 2009}} but was codified similarly to its present form only in 1901 by King [[Chulalongkorn]] in ''Royal Gazette'' 17:206.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=ประกาศใช้ทุ่มโมงยาม|periodical=Royal Gazette|date=29 July 1901|issue=17|page=206|url=http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2443/018/206.PDF|accessdate=2008-10-18}}. {{th icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, it is used only in [[colloquial speech]]. However, a corrupted form of the six-hour clock is more frequently encountered,&lt;ref name="Unlocked" /&gt; where usually the first half of daytime (including the sixth hour of the preceding quarter) is counted as in the [[twelve-hour clock]], i.e. ''hok (6) mong chao'', ''chet (7) mong'', etc., up to ''sip et (11) mong''.

The six-hour clock system was abolished in [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]] during the [[French protectorate of Cambodia|French protectorate]], and the French 24-hour clock system (for example, 3h00) has been used.

A comparison of the systems is as follows:

In mathematics, the '''structure [[tensor]]''', also referred to as the '''second-moment matrix''', is a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] derived from the  [[gradient]] of a [[function (mathematics)|function]].  It summarizes the predominant directions of the gradient in a specified neighborhood of a point, and the degree to which those directions are coherent.  The structure tensor is often used in [[image processing]] and [[computer vision]].&lt;ref name=bigun86&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 2D structure tensor==

===Continuous version===
For a function &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; of two variables {{nowrap|1=''p'' = (''x'', ''y'')}}, the structure tensor is the 2×2 matrix

:&lt;math&gt;
S_w(p) =
\begin{bmatrix}
\int w(r) (I_x(p-r))^2\,d r &amp; \int w(r) I_x(p-r)I_y(p-r)\,d r \\[10pt]
\int w(r) I_x(p-r)I_y(p-r)\,d r  &amp; \int w(r) (I_y(p-r))^2\,d r
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;I_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I_y&lt;/math&gt; are the [[partial derivative]]s of &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; with respect to ''x'' and ''y''; the integrals range over the plane &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;; and ''w'' is some fixed "window function", a [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] on two variables.   Note that the matrix &lt;math&gt;S_w&lt;/math&gt; is itself a function of {{nowrap|1=''p'' = (''x'', ''y'')}}.

The formula above can be written also as &lt;math&gt;S_w(p)=\int w(r) S_0(p-r)\,d r&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;S_0&lt;/math&gt; is the matrix-valued function defined by
:&lt;math&gt;
S_0(p)=
\begin{bmatrix}
(I_x(p))^2 &amp; I_x(p)I_y(p) \\[10pt]
I_x(p)I_y(p) &amp; (I_y(p))^2
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

If the [[gradient]] &lt;math&gt;\nabla I = (I_x,I_y)^\text{T}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is viewed as a 2×1 (single-column) matrix, where &lt;math&gt;(.)^\text{T}&lt;/math&gt; denotes [[transpose]] operation, turning a row vector to a column vector,  the matrix &lt;math&gt;S_0&lt;/math&gt; can be written as the [[matrix product]] &lt;math&gt;(\nabla I)(\nabla I)^\text{T}&lt;/math&gt;, also known as an outer product, or tensor product.  Note however that the structure tensor &lt;math&gt;S_w(p)&lt;/math&gt; cannot be factored in this way in general except if  &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Dirac delta function]]. 

===Discrete version===
In image processing and other similar applications, the function &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is usually given as a discrete [[array data structure|array]] of samples &lt;math&gt;I[p]&lt;/math&gt;, where ''p'' is a pair of integer indices.  The 2D structure tensor at a given [[pixel]] is usually taken to be the discrete sum

:&lt;math&gt;
S_w[p] =
\begin{bmatrix}
\sum_r w[r] (I_x[p-r])^2 &amp; \sum_r w[r]  I_x[p-r]I_y[p-r] \\[10pt]
\sum_r w[r] I_x[p-r]I_y[p-r]  &amp; \sum_r w[r] (I_y[p-r])^2
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Here the summation index ''r'' ranges over a finite set of index pairs (the "window", typically &lt;math&gt;\{-m..+m\}\times\{-m..+m\}&lt;/math&gt; for some ''m''), and ''w''[''r''] is a fixed "window weight" that depends on ''r'', such that the sum of all weights is 1.  The values &lt;math&gt;I_x[p],I_y[p]&lt;/math&gt; are the partial derivatives sampled at pixel ''p''; which, for instance, may be estimated from by &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; by [[finite difference]] formulas.

The formula of the structure tensor can be written also as &lt;math&gt;S_w[p]=\sum_r w[r] S_0[p-r]&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;S_0&lt;/math&gt; is the matrix-valued array such that
:&lt;math&gt;
S_0[p] =
\begin{bmatrix}
(I_x[p])^2 &amp; I_x[p]I_y[p] \\[10pt]
I_x[p]I_y[p]  &amp; (I_y[p])^2
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Interpretation===
The importance of the 2D structure tensor &lt;math&gt;S_w&lt;/math&gt; stems from the fact [[eigenvalue]]s &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1,\lambda_2&lt;/math&gt; (which can be ordered so that &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 \geq \lambda_2\geq 0&lt;/math&gt;) and the corresponding [[eigenvector]]s &lt;math&gt;e_1,e_2&lt;/math&gt; summarize the distribution of the [[gradient]] &lt;math&gt;\nabla I = (I_x,I_y)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; within the window defined by &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; centered at &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=bigun86/&gt;&lt;ref name=bigun87/&gt;&lt;ref name=knutsson89/&gt;

Namely, if &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 &gt; \lambda_2&lt;/math&gt;, then  &lt;math&gt;e_1&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;-e_1&lt;/math&gt;) is the direction that is maximally aligned with the gradient within the window.  

In particular, if &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 &gt; 0, \lambda_2 = 0&lt;/math&gt; then the gradient is always a multiple of &lt;math&gt;e_1&lt;/math&gt; (positive, negative or zero); this is the case if and only if &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; within the window varies along the direction &lt;math&gt;e_1&lt;/math&gt; but is constant along &lt;math&gt;e_2&lt;/math&gt;. This condition of eigenvalues is also called linear symmetry condition because then the iso-curves of &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; consist in parallel lines, i.e there exists a one dimensional function function &lt;math&gt;g  &lt;/math&gt; which can generate the two dimensional function &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;I(x,y)=g(d^\text{T} p)&lt;/math&gt; for some constant vector &lt;math&gt;d=(d_x,d_y)^T &lt;/math&gt; and the coordinates &lt;math&gt;p=(x,y)^T &lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 = \lambda_2&lt;/math&gt;, on the other hand, the gradient in the window has no predominant direction; which happens, for instance, when the image has [[rotational symmetry]] within that window. This condition of eigenvalues  is also called balanced body, or directional equilibrium condition because it holds when  all gradient directions in the window are equally frequent/probable.  

Furthermore, the condition &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = 0&lt;/math&gt; happens if and only if the function &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is constant (&lt;math&gt;\nabla I = (0,0)&lt;/math&gt;) within &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;.

More generally, the value of &lt;math&gt;\lambda_k &lt;/math&gt;, for ''k''=1 or ''k''=2, is the &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;-weighted average, in the neighborhood of ''p'', of the square of the [[directional derivative]] of &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; along &lt;math&gt;e_k&lt;/math&gt;.  The relative discrepancy between the two eigenvalues of &lt;math&gt;S_w&lt;/math&gt; is an indicator of the degree of [[isotropy|anisotropy]] of the gradient in the window, namely how strongly is it biased towards a particular direction (and its opposite).&lt;ref name="Jahne1993"&gt;
  {{cite book|author=B. Jahne|title=Spatio-Temporal Image Processing: Theory and Scientific Applications|location=Berlin|publisher=Springer-Verlag|volume=751|year=1993}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MedioniEA&gt;
  {{cite book|author1=G. Medioni, M. Lee  |author2=C. Tang |lastauthoramp=yes |title=A Computational Framework for Feature Extraction and Segmentation|publisher=Elsevier Science|date=March 2000}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  This attribute can be quantified by the '''coherence''', defined as

:&lt;math&gt;c_w=\left(\frac{\lambda_1-\lambda_2}{\lambda_1+\lambda_2}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

if &lt;math&gt;\lambda_2&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.  This quantity is 1 when the gradient is totally aligned, and 0 when it has no preferred direction. The formula is undefined, even in the [[limit of a function|limit]], when the image is constant in the window (&lt;math&gt;\lambda_1=\lambda_2=0&lt;/math&gt;). Some authors define it as 0 in that case.

Note that the average of the gradient &lt;math&gt;\nabla I&lt;/math&gt; inside the window is '''not''' a good indicator of anisotropy. Aligned but oppositely oriented gradient vectors would cancel out in this average, whereas in the structure tensor they are properly added together.&lt;ref&gt;
  {{cite journal|author=T. Brox, J. Weickert, B. Burgeth and P. Mrazek|title=Nonlinear Structure Tensors|booktitle=Universität des Saarlandes, Tech. Report|issue=113|pages=1–32|year=2004}}
&lt;/ref&gt; This is a reason for why &lt;math&gt;(\nabla I)(\nabla I)^\text{T}&lt;/math&gt; is used in the averaging of the structure tensor to optimize the direction instead of &lt;math&gt;\nabla I&lt;/math&gt;.

By expanding the effective radius of the window function &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; (that is, increasing its variance), one can make the structure tensor more robust in the face of noise, at the cost of diminished spatial resolution.&lt;ref name=MedioniEA /&gt;&lt;ref name=lin94book&gt;T. Lindeberg (1994), ''[http://www.nada.kth.se/~tony/book.html Scale-Space Theory in Computer Vision]''. Kluwer Academic Publishers, (see sections 14.4.1 and 14.2.3 on pages 359–360 and 355–356 for detailed statements about how the multi-scale second-moment matrix/structure tensor defines a true and uniquely determined multi-scale representation of directional data).
&lt;/ref&gt;  The formal basis for this property is described in more detail below, where it is shown that a multi-scale formulation of the structure tensor, referred to as the [[Structure tensor#The multi-scale structure tensor|multi-scale structure tensor]], constitutes a ''true multi-scale representation of directional data under variations of the spatial extent of the window function''.

===Complex version===
The interpretation  and implementation of the 2D structure tensor  becomes particularly accessible using complex numbers.&lt;ref name="bigun87" /&gt; The structure tensor consists in  3 real numbers

:&lt;math&gt;
S_w(p) =
\begin{bmatrix}
\mu_{20} &amp; \mu_{11} \\[10pt]
\mu_{11}  &amp; \mu_{02}
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;
\mu_{20} =\int (w(r) (I_x(p-r))^2\,d r  
&lt;/math&gt; ,    &lt;math display="inline"&gt;
\mu_{02} =\int (w(r) (I_y(p-r))^2\,d r  
&lt;/math&gt;   and  &lt;math display="inline"&gt;
\mu_{11} =\int w(r) I_x(p-r)I_y(p-r)\,d r  
&lt;/math&gt; in which integrals can be replaced by summations for discrete representation. Using Parseval relationship it is clear that the three real numbers are the second order moments of the power spectrum of &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;. The following second order complex moment of the power spectrum of  &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; can then be written as 

&lt;math display="inline"&gt;
\kappa_{20} =\mu_{20}-\mu_{02}+i2\mu_{11}=\int (w(r) (I_x(p-r)+i I_y(p-r))^2\,d r  =(\lambda_1-\lambda_2)\exp(i2\phi)
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;i=\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the direction angle of the most significant eigenvector of the structure tensor &lt;math&gt;\phi=\angle{e_1}&lt;/math&gt; whereas &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_2&lt;/math&gt; are the most and the least significant eigenvalues. From, this it follows that  &lt;math&gt;\kappa_{20} &lt;/math&gt; contains both a certainty &lt;math&gt;|\kappa_{20}|=\lambda_1-\lambda_2&lt;/math&gt; and the optimal direction in double angle representation since it is a complex number consisting of two real numbers. It follows also that if the gradient is represented as a complex number, and is remapped by squaring  (i.e. the argument angle of the complex gradient is doubled),  then averaging acts as an optimizer in the mapped domain, since it directly delivers both the optimal direction (in double angle representation) and the associated certainty. The complex number represents thus how much linear structure (linear symmetry) there is in image  &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, and the complex number is obtained directly by averaging the gradient in its (complex) double angle representation  without computing the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors explicitly.

Likewise the following second order complex moment of the power spectrum of &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, which happens to be always real because &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is real,

&lt;math display="inline"&gt;
\kappa_{11} =\mu_{20}+\mu_{02}=\int (w(r) |I_x(p-r)+i I_y(p-r)|^2\,d r  =\lambda_1+\lambda_2
&lt;/math&gt;

can be obtained, with  &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_2&lt;/math&gt; being the eigenvalues as before. Notice that this time the magnitude of the complex gradient is squared (which is always real). 

However, decomposing the structure tensor in its eigenvectors yields its tensor components as

:&lt;math&gt;
S_w(p) =
\lambda_1 e_1e_1^\text{T}+
\lambda_2 e_2e_2^\text{T} =(\lambda_1 -\lambda_2)e_1e_1^\text{T}+
\lambda_2(  e_1e_1^\text{T}+e_2e_2^\text{T})= (\lambda_1 -\lambda_2)e_1e_1^\text{T}+
\lambda_2 E
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;   is the identity matrix in 2D because the two eigenvectors are always orthogonal (and sum to unity). The first term in the last expression of the  decomposition, &lt;math&gt;(\lambda_1 -\lambda_2)e_1e_1^\text{T}&lt;/math&gt;, represents the linear symmetry component of the structure tensor containing all directional information (as a rank-1 matrix),  whereas the second term represents the balanced body component of the tensor,  which  lacks any directional information (containing an identity matrix &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;).  To know how much directional information there is in  &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;  is then the same as checking how large &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1-\lambda_2 &lt;/math&gt;is compared to   &lt;math&gt;\lambda_2&lt;/math&gt;. 

Evidently, &lt;math&gt;\kappa_{20}&lt;/math&gt; is the complex equivalent of the first term in the tensor decomposition, whereas &lt;math display="block"&gt;(|\kappa_{20}|-\kappa_{11})/2=\lambda_2&lt;/math&gt;is the equivalent of the second term. Thus the two scalars, comprising three real numbers, 

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{c}
\kappa_{20} =(\lambda_1-\lambda_2)\exp(i2\phi)&amp;=&amp;w*(h*I)^2\\
\kappa_{11} =\lambda_1+\lambda_2&amp;=&amp;w*|h*I|^2\\
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;       
where &lt;math&gt;h(x,y)=(x+iy)\exp(-(x^2+y^2)/(2\sigma^2)) &lt;/math&gt; is the (complex) gradient filter, and &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; is convolution, constitute a complex representation of the 2D Structure Tensor. As discussed here and elsewhere &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; defines the local image which is usually a Gaussian (with a certain variance defining the outer scale), and &lt;math&gt;\sigma &lt;/math&gt; is the (inner scale) parameter determining the effective frequency  range in which the orientation &lt;math&gt;2\phi&lt;/math&gt; is to be estimated.

The elegance of the complex representation stems from that the two components of the structure tensor can be obtained as averages and  independently. In turn, this means that  &lt;math&gt;\kappa_{20}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\kappa_{11}&lt;/math&gt; can be used in a scale space representation to describe the evidence for presence of unique orientation and the evidence for the alternative hypothesis,  the presence of multiple balanced orientations, without computing the eigenvectors and eigenvalues. A functional, such as squaring the complex numbers have to this date not been shown to exist for structure tensors with dimensions higher than two. In Bigun 91,  it has been put forward with due argument that this is because complex numbers are commutative algebras whereas quaternions, the possible candidate to construct such a functional by,  constitute a non-commutative algebra.&lt;ref name=bigun91&gt;
  {{cite journal|author1=J. Bigun  |author2=G. Granlund |author3=J. Wiklund |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Multidimensional Orientation Estimation with              Applications to Texture Analysis and Optical Flow| journal=IEEE-PAMI|volume=13|number=8|pages=775--790|year=1991 |doi=10.1109/34.85668}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The complex representation of the structure tensor is frequently used in fingerprint analysis to obtain direction maps containing certainties which in turn are used to enhance them, to find the locations of the global (cores and deltas) and local  (minutia) singularities, as well as automatically evaluate the quality of the fingerprints.

==The 3D structure tensor==

===Definition===
The structure tensor can be defined also for a function &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; of three variables ''p''=(''x'',''y'',''z'') in an entirely analogous way.  Namely, in the continuous version we have &lt;math&gt;S_w(p) = \int w(r) S_0(p-r)\,d r&lt;/math&gt;, where
:&lt;math&gt;
S_0(p) = 
\begin{bmatrix}
(I_x(p))^2 &amp; I_x(p)I_y(p) &amp; I_x(p)I_z(p) \\[10pt]
I_x(p)I_y(p) &amp; (I_y(p))^2 &amp; I_y(p)I_z(p) \\[10pt]
I_x(p)I_z(p) &amp; I_y(p)I_z(p) &amp; (I_z(p))^2
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;I_x,I_y,I_z&lt;/math&gt; are the three partial derivatives of &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, and the integral ranges over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;.

In the discrete version,&lt;math&gt;S_w[p]=\sum_r w[r] S_0[p-r]&lt;/math&gt;, where 
:&lt;math&gt;
S_0[p] =
\begin{bmatrix}
(I_x[p])^2 &amp; I_x[p]I_y[p] &amp; I_x[p]I_z[p] \\[10pt]
I_x[p]I_y[p]  &amp; (I_y[p])^2 &amp; I_y[p]I_z[p]\\[10pt]
I_x[p]I_z[p] &amp; I_y[p]I_z[p] &amp; (I_z[p])^2
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
and the sum ranges over a finite set of 3D indices, usually &lt;math&gt;\{-m..+m\}\times\{-m..+m\}\times\{-m..+m\}&lt;/math&gt; for some ''m''.

===Interpretation===
As in the three-dimensional case, the eigenvalues &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\lambda_3&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;S_w[p]&lt;/math&gt;, and the corresponding eigenvectors &lt;math&gt;e_1,e_2,e_3&lt;/math&gt;, summarize the distribution of gradient directions within the neighborhood of ''p'' defined by the window &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;.  This information can be visualized as an [[ellipsoid]] whose semi-axes are equal to the eigenvalues and directed along their corresponding eigenvectors.&lt;ref name="Medioni"/&gt;

In particular, if the ellipsoid is stretched along one axis only, like a cigar (that is, if &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1&lt;/math&gt; is much larger than both &lt;math&gt;\lambda_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_3&lt;/math&gt;), it means that the gradient in the window is predominantly aligned with the direction &lt;math&gt;e_1&lt;/math&gt;, so that the [[isosurface]]s of &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; tend to be flat and perpendicular to that vector.  This situation occurs, for instance, when ''p'' lies on a thin plate-like feature, or on the smooth boundary between two regions with contrasting values.

|}
&lt;/center&gt;

If the ellipsoid is flattened in one direction only, like a pancake (that is, if &lt;math&gt;\lambda_3&lt;/math&gt; is much smaller than both &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_2&lt;/math&gt;), it means that the gradient directions are spread out but perpendicular to &lt;math&gt;e_3&lt;/math&gt;; so that the isosurfaces tend to be like tubes parallel to that vector.  This situation occurs, for instance, when ''p'' lies on a thin line-like feature, or on a sharp corner of the boundary between two regions with contrasting values.

|}
&lt;/center&gt;

Finally, if the ellipsoid is roughly spherical (that is, if &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1\approx\lambda_2\approx\lambda_3&lt;/math&gt;), it means that the gradient directions in the window are more or less evenly distributed, with no marked preference; so that the function &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is mostly isotropic in that neighborhood.  This happens, for instance, when the function has [[spherical symmetry]] in the neighborhood of ''p''. In particular, if the ellipsoid degenerates to a point (that is, if the three eigenvalues are zero), it means that &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is constant (has zero gradient) within the window.

==The multi-scale structure tensor==
The structure tensor is an important tool in [[scale space]] analysis.  The '''multi-scale structure tensor''' (or '''multi-scale second moment matrix''') of a function &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is in contrast to other one-parameter scale-space features an image descriptor that is defined over ''two'' scale parameters.
One scale parameter, referred to as ''local scale'' &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, is needed for determining the amount of pre-smoothing when computing the image gradient &lt;math&gt;(\nabla I)(x; t)&lt;/math&gt;. Another scale parameter, referred to as ''integration scale'' &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, is needed for specifying the spatial extent of the window function &lt;math&gt;w(\xi; s)&lt;/math&gt; that determines the weights for the region in space over which the components of the outer product of the gradient by itself &lt;math&gt;(\nabla I)(\nabla I)^\text{T}&lt;/math&gt; are accumulated.

More precisely, suppose that &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is a real-valued signal defined over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^k&lt;/math&gt;. For any local scale &lt;math&gt;t &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, let a multi-scale representation &lt;math&gt;I(x; t)&lt;/math&gt; of this signal be given by &lt;math&gt;I(x; t) = h(x; t)*I(x)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;h(x; t)&lt;/math&gt; represents a pre-smoothing kernel. Furthermore, let &lt;math&gt;(\nabla I)(x; t)&lt;/math&gt; denote the gradient of the [[scale space representation]].
Then, the ''multi-scale structure tensor/second-moment matrix'' is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
\mu(x; t, s) =
\int_{\xi \in \mathbb{R}^k} 
(\nabla I)(x-\xi; t) \, (\nabla I)^\text{T}(x-\xi; t) \, 
w(\xi; s) \, d\xi 
&lt;/math&gt;
Conceptually, one may ask if it would be sufficient to use any self-similar families of smoothing functions &lt;math&gt;h(x; t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w(\xi; s)&lt;/math&gt;. If one naively would apply, for example, a box filter, however, then non-desirable artifacts could easily occur. If one wants the multi-scale structure tensor to be well-behaved over both increasing local scales &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and increasing integration scales &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, then it can be shown that both the smoothing function and the window function ''have to'' be Gaussian.&lt;ref name=lin94book/&gt; The conditions that specify this uniqueness are similar to the [[scale-space axioms]] that are used for deriving the uniqueness of the Gaussian kernel for a regular Gaussian [[scale space]] of image intensities.

There are different ways of handling the two-parameter scale variations in this family of image descriptors. If we keep the local scale parameter &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; fixed and apply increasingly broadened versions of the window function by increasing the integration scale parameter &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; only, then we obtain a ''true formal [[scale space representation]] of the directional data computed at the given local scale'' &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=lin94book/&gt; If we couple the local scale and integration scale by a ''relative integration scale'' &lt;math&gt;r \geq 1&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;s = r t&lt;/math&gt; then for any fixed value of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain a reduced self-similar one-parameter variation, which is frequently used to simplify computational algorithms, for example in [[corner detection]], [[interest point detection]], [[texture analysis]] and [[image registration|image matching]].
By varying the relative integration scale &lt;math&gt;r \geq 1&lt;/math&gt; in such a self-similar scale variation, we obtain another alternative way of parameterizing the multi-scale nature of directional data obtained by increasing the integration scale.

A conceptually similar construction can be performed for discrete signals, with the convolution integral replaced by a convolution sum and with the continuous Gaussian kernel &lt;math&gt; g(x; t)&lt;/math&gt; replaced by the [[discrete Gaussian kernel]] &lt;math&gt;T(n; t)&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
\mu(x; t, s) =
\sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}^k} 
(\nabla I)(x-n; t) \, (\nabla I)^\text{T}(x-n; t) \, 
w(n; s) 
&lt;/math&gt;
When quantizing the scale parameters &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; in an actual implementation, a finite geometric progression &lt;math&gt;\alpha^i&lt;/math&gt; is usually used, with ''i'' ranging from 0 to some maximum scale index ''m''.  Thus, the discrete scale levels  will bear certain similarities to [[pyramid (image processing)|image pyramid]], although spatial subsampling may not necessarily be used in order to preserve more accurate data for subsequent processing stages.

===Processing spatio-temporal video data with the structure tensor===

The three-dimensional structure tensor has been used to analyze three-dimensional video data (viewed as a function of ''x'', ''y'', and time ''t'').&lt;ref name="Jahne1993" /&gt;
If one in this context aims at image descriptors that are ''invariant'' under Galilean transformations, to make it possible to compare image measurements that have been obtained under variations of a priori unknown image velocities &lt;math&gt;v = (v_x, v_y)^\text{T}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} x' \\ y' \\ t' \end{bmatrix} = G \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ t \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} x - v_x \, t \\ y - v_y \, t \\ t \end{bmatrix}  &lt;/math&gt;,
it is, however, from a computational viewpoint more preferable to parameterize the components in the structure tensor/second-moment matrix &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; using the notion of ''Galilean diagonalization''&lt;ref name=lin04icpr&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; S' = R_\text{space}^{-\text{T}} \, G^{-\text{T}} \, S \, G^{-1} \, R_\text{space}^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix} \nu_1 &amp; \, &amp; \, \\ \, &amp; \nu_2 &amp; \, \\ \, &amp; \, &amp; \nu_3 \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; denotes a Galilean transformation of spacetime and &lt;math&gt;R_\text{space}&lt;/math&gt; a two-dimensional rotation over the spatial domain,
compared to the abovementioned use of eigenvalues of a 3-D structure tensor, which corresponds to an eigenvalue decomposition and a (non-physical) three-dimensional rotation of spacetime
:&lt;math&gt; S'' = R_\text{spacetime}^{-\text{T}} \, S \, R_\text{spacetime}^{-1}  = \begin{bmatrix} \lambda_1 &amp; &amp;  \\ &amp; \lambda_2 &amp; \\ &amp; &amp; \lambda_3 \end{bmatrix}  &lt;/math&gt;.
To obtain true Galilean invariance, however, also the shape of the spatio-temporal window function needs to be adapted,&lt;ref name=lin04icpr/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; corresponding to the transfer of [[affine shape adaptation]]&lt;ref name=lingar97/&gt; from spatial to spatio-temporal image data.
In combination with local spatio-temporal histogram descriptors,&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1537">In [[type theory]], a type system has the property of '''subject reduction''' (also '''subject evaluation''', '''type preservation''' or simply '''preservation''') if [[evaluation (computer science)|evaluation]] of [[expression (computer science)|expression]]s does not cause their [[type (computer science)|type]] to change. Formally, if Γ ⊢ ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; : ''&amp;tau;'' and ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; → ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  then Γ ⊢ ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; : ''&amp;tau;''.

Together with [[progress (type theory)|progress]], it is an important meta-theoretical property for establishing [[type soundness]] of a type system.

The opposite property, if Γ ⊢ ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; : ''&amp;tau;'' and ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; → ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  then Γ ⊢ ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; : ''&amp;tau;'', is called '''subject expansion'''. It often does not hold as evaluation can erase ill-typed sub-terms of an expression, resulting in a well-typed one.

'''The Real Estate Show''' was a [[Colab]] sponsored illegal occupation exhibition on the subject of landlord speculation in [[real estate]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abcnorio.org/about/history/res_manifesto.html] ''The Real Estate Show Manifesto'' or ''Statement of Intent Committee for the Real Estate Show'', 1980&lt;/ref&gt; held on New Year's Eve in January 1980 in a vacant city-owned building at 123 [[Delancey Street]] in the [[Lower East Side]] of [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;Max Schumann (ed.) ''A Book about Colab (and Related Activities)'' [[Printed Matter, Inc]], 2016. pp. 100-119&lt;/ref&gt; The squatter action followed a year of long and frustrating campaigning to rent the property for an exhibition space from officials of the NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD).&lt;ref&gt;Julie Ault. ''Alternative Art, New York, 1965-1985'' [[University of Minnesota Press]], 2002: p.217.&lt;/ref&gt;

On New Year's Day the show was officially opened to the public. It was to be a two-week occupation/exhibit but was closed down by the police. On the morning of January 2, the Colab artists discovered the storefront padlocked from the inside, their work locked within. Phone calls revealed it to be the doing of HPD. ''The Real Estate Show'' had been open exactly one day.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carlo McCormick]], ''The Downtown Book: The New York Art Scene, 1974–1984'', [[Princeton University]] Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 8, the artists, accompanied by art dealer Ronald Feldman and German [[conceptual art]]ist [[Joseph Beuys]] assembled at the site to protest its closing in the company of reporters from the [[New York Times]], Soho News, and the [[East Village Eye]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://98bowery.com/returntothebowery/abcnorio-the-real-estate-show.php]  ''The Real Estate Show'' By Lehmann Weichselbaum, [[East Village Eye]], 1980&lt;/ref&gt; There was a photograph taken of Beuys at the front door of ''The Real Estate Show'' standing with Feldman, [[Alan W. Moore]], [[Joseph Nechvatal]], Cid Collins and others taken that day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://98bowery.com/return-to-the-bowery/abcnorio-the-real-estate-show.php ''The Real Estate Show'']&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 11 city workers swept into 123 Delancey, cleared out the exhibited work and trucked it to an uptown warehouse. It was not until a few days later that artists were granted entry into the warehouse to take their art back home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://98bowery.com/returntothebowery/abcnorio-the-real-estate-show.php] ''The Real Estate Show'' by Lehmann Weichselbaum, ''East Village Eye'', 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 16 a deal was reached with the city that gave birth to [[ABC No Rio]] when, as a compromise, a city agency gave the artists control of nearby 156 [[Rivington Street]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://1981.nyc/formation-abc-no-rio/ The Formation of ABC NO RIO]&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2014, there were four concurrent art exhibitions in New York City around ''The Real Estate Show'': at James Fuentes Gallery, [[ABC No Rio]], the Lodge Gallery, and Cuchifritos Gallery/Essex Street Market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelodownny.com/leslog/2014/03/the-real-estate-show-revisted-at-the-james-fuentes-gallery.html] ''The Real Estate Show Revisited''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bedfordandbowery.com/2014/04/a-legendary-exhibition-the-real-estate-show-has-been-revived-on-the-les/] Article on James Fuentes Gallery show "Real Estate Show, Then...And Now"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://artfcity.com/2014/04/08/the-real-estate-show-slideshow-and-commentary/] ''The Real Estate Show'' Slideshow and Commentary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hyperallergic.com/122204/putting-the-no-in-nostalgia/] Putting the ‘No’ in ‘Nostalgia’ by [[Robert C. Morgan]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studiointernational.com/index.php/lower-east-side-the-real-estate-show-redux]''"Lower East Side: The Real Estate Show Redux'' by Natasha Kurchanova at Studio International&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, Becky Howland &amp; Matthias Mayer curated ''The Real Estate Show'' at Spor Klubu in Berlin, drawing from documentation of the original ''Real Estate Show'' (1980) from the Archive Collection of the extant project space [[ABC No Rio]]. Included in the show were Robert Cooney, Mitch Corber, Peter Fend, Coleen Fitzgibbon, Bobby G (Robert Goldman), Ilona Granet, Becky Howland, Christof Kohlhofer, Gregory Lehmann, Ann Messner, Peter Mönnig, Alan Moore, Joseph Nechvatal, Cara Perlman, Scott Pfaffman, Christy Rupp and Robin Winters. In conjunction with this show, another exhibition called ''The Real Estate Show Extended/Berlin: Group exhibition on the subject of [[Gentrification]], Real Estate Speculation and Selling out the City'' was presented at Kunstpunkt Berlin. This show included many Berlin artists along with four original members of the ''Real Estate Show'' (1980): Becky Howland, Peter Mönnig, Alan Moore, and Joseph Nechvatal. Howland, Mönnig, Moore and Nechvatal also participated in a panel discussion on Real Estate and Art on June 3rd, 2017 that was moderated by Howard McCalebb of Dada Post, Berlin. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kunstpunkt.com/pages/ausstell_fr.htm] ''The Real Estate Show'' at Kunstpunkt Berlin&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2258">A '''traffic model''' is a [[mathematical model]] of real-world [[traffic]], usually, but not restricted to, [[road traffic]]. Traffic modeling draws heavily on theoretical foundations like [[network theory]] and certain theories from physics like the [[kinematic wave]] model. The interesting quantity being modeled and measured is the [[traffic flow]], i.e. the throughput of mobile units (e.g. [[vehicle]]s) per time and transportation medium capacity (e.g. road or lane width). Models can teach researchers and engineers how to ensure an optimal flow with a minimum number of [[traffic jam]]s.

Traffic models often are the basis of a [[traffic simulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mahmud|first1=Khizir|last2=Town|first2=Graham E.|title=A review of computer tools for modeling electric vehicle energy requirements and their impact on power distribution networks|journal=Applied Energy|date=June 2016|volume=172|pages=337–359|doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.03.100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
;[[Microscopic traffic flow model]]: Traffic flow is assumed to depend on individual mobile units, i.e. cars, which are explicitly modeled
;[[Macroscopic traffic flow model]]: Only the [[mass action (sociology)|mass action]] or the [[statistical]] properties of a large number of units is analyzed

'''Yan Huang Zisun''' ({{zh|c=炎黃子孫|l='''Descendants of Yan and Huang'''}}) is a term that represents the Chinese people and refers to an ethnocultural identity based on a common ancestry associated with a mythological origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Yeo |first1=K.K. |title=Musing with Confucius and Paul: Toward a Chinese Christian theology |date=2008 |publisher=Cascade Books |isbn=9781556354885| page=407 | quote=Zhonghua (Chinese) or huaren (Chinese people) can be inclusive terms that refer to a common ancestry, traceable according to legend to the Yellow Emperor. Sometimes the Chinese are called the Yan-Huang zisun—descendants of the legendary Emperor Yan (a.k.a. Shen Nong, god of husbandry and first pharmacist) and Emperor Huang (whose burial place is in Huangling). [...] The legend of Emperors Yan-Huang can provide only an "imagined" identity for those who wish their genealogy to be traced to the royal gene of the emperors.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Yuan |first1=Haiwang |title=The magic lotus lantern and other tales from the Han Chinese |date=2006 |publisher=Libraries Unlimited |isbn=9781591582946 |page=10 | quote=The Chinese believe that they all came from the common ancestors Sanhuang Wudi [...] referring to themselves as Yanhuang zisun (descendants of Yandi and Huangdi).)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is noted that the term specifically refers to the [[Han Chinese|Han ethnic group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Liang |first1=Yongjia |editor1-last=Zhao |editor1-first=Litao |title=China's social development and policy: Into the next stage? |date=2013 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=9780415642835 |page=195 |chapter=Developmentalism, secularism, nationalism and essentialism: current situation and challenges of the ethnic issue in China |quote=One problem with current Chinese nationalism is the discursive confusion with the terms Zhonghua Minzu (Chinese Nation), Yanhuang Zisun [...] However, a closer examination indicates that only the first justifies such a definition, while the other three can only be designated as the Han as most of the ethnic minorities do not share the legendary ancestors of the Yellow Emperor or the dragon.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This term is connected to [[Yan Emperor|Yandi]] (炎帝) and [[Yellow Emperor|Huangdi]] (黃帝), in which both figures are considered the legendary ancestors of the [[Huaxia]] people who themselves are ancestral to the Han people.&lt;ref name=wie02&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wienen |first1=Ingmar |title=Developing international business in the context of culture and ethics in transformation: The example of China |date=2002 |publisher=Peter Lang |isbn=9780820459851 |page=19-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern usage==
To this day, the Chinese still refer to themselves with this term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Law|first=Eugene|title=Intercontinental's best of China|year=2004|publisher=China Intercontinental Press|location=Beijing|isbn=978-7-5085-0429-2|page=10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hUb_BQNkXdQC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The derivation of the term is mentioned as ''Yan Huang Shizhou'' (炎黃世胄) in the [[National Flag Anthem of the Republic of China]].

[[Ma Ying-jeou]], President of the [[Republic of China]], has used this term to refer to all Chinese people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ko|first=Shu-ling|title=‘1992 consensus’ is basis of ties: Ma|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2010/10/29/2003487182|accessdate=25 October 2011|newspaper=Taipei Times|date=Oct 29, 2010|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
