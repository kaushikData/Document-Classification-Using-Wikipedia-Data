'''167''' ('''one hundred [and] sixty-seven''') is the [[natural number]] following [[166 (number)|166]] and preceding [[168 (number)|168]].

==In mathematics==
167 is a [[Chen prime]], a [[Gaussian prime]], a [[safe prime]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A005385|title=Sloane's A005385 : Safe primes|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[Eisenstein prime]] with no imaginary part and a real part of the form &lt;math&gt;3n - 1&lt;/math&gt;.

167 is the only prime which can not be expressed as a sum of seven or fewer [[Cube (algebra)|cubes]].
It is also the smallest number which requires six terms when expressed using the greedy algorithm as a sum of squares, 167 = 144 + 16 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|A006892|name=Representation as a sum of squares requires n squares with greedy algorithm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
although by [[Lagrange's four-square theorem]] its non-greedy expression as a sum of squares can be shorter, e.g. 167 = 121 + 36 + 1 + 1.

167 is a [[full reptend prime]] in base 10, since the decimal expansion of 1/167 repeats the following 166 digits: 0.00598802395209580838323353293413173652694610778443113772455089820359281437125748502994 0119760479041916167664670658682634730538922155688622754491017964071856287425149700...

167 is a [[highly cototient number]], as it is the smallest number ''k'' with exactly 15 solutions to the equation ''x'' - φ(''x'') = ''k''. It is also a [[strictly non-palindromic number]].

167 is the smallest multi-digit prime such that the product of digits is equal to the number of digits times the sum of the digits, i. e., 1&amp;times;6&amp;times;7 = 3&amp;times;(1+6+7)

167 is the smallest positive integer ''d'' such that the imaginary [[quadratic field]] '''Q'''({{sqrt|–''d''}}) has [[Class number (number theory)|class number]] = 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tables of imaginary quadratic fields with small class number|website=numbertheory.org|url=http://www.numbertheory.org/classnos/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alexander Holevo'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Timeline of quantum computing|url=http://wikipedia.org/wiki/timeline_of_quantum_computing}}&lt;/ref&gt;({{lang-ru|Алекса́ндр Семéнович Хóлево}}, also spelled as Kholevo and Cholewo) is a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[Russia]]n  [[mathematician]], one of the pioneers of [[quantum information science]].

== Biography ==
Alexander Holevo has been a member of [[Steklov Mathematical Institute]], Moscow, since 1969. He graduated from [[Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology]] in 1966, defended a PhD Thesis in 1969 and a Doctor of Science Thesis in 1975. Since 1986 A.S. Holevo is a Professor ([[Moscow State University]] and [[Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology]]).&lt;ref name="mathnet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Holevo Alexander Semenovich on Russian informational portal Math-Net|url=http://www.mathnet.ru/php/person.phtml?option_lang=eng&amp;personid=8777|accessdate=13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
A.S. Holevo made substantial contributions in the mathematical foundations of [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]], [[quantum statistics]] and [[quantum information]] theory. In 1973 he obtained an upper bound for the amount of classical information that can be extracted from an ensemble of quantum states by quantum measurements (this result is known as ''[[Holevo's theorem]]''). A.S. Holevo developed the mathematical theory of [[quantum_channel|quantum communication channels]], the noncommutative theory of statistical decisions, he proved [[classical_capacity|coding theorems]] in quantum information theory and revealed the structure of quantum Markov semigroups and measurement processes. A.S. Holevo is the author of about one-hundred and seventy published works, including five monographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Homepage of Alexander S. Holevo|url=http://www.mi.ras.ru/~holevo/eindex.html|accessdate=13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[geometry]], an '''axis-aligned object''' ('''axis-parallel''', '''axis-oriented''') is an object in ''n''-dimensional space whose shape is aligned with the [[coordinate axes]] of the space. 

Examples are [[axis-aligned rectangle]]s (or [[hyperrectangle]]s), the ones with edges parallel to the coordinate axes. [[Minimum bounding box]]es are often implicitly assumed to be axis-aligned. A more general case is [[rectilinear polygon]]s, the ones with all sides parallel to coordinate axes or rectilinear polyhedra. 

Many problems in [[computational geometry]] allow for faster algorithms when restricted to (collections of) axis-oriented objects, such as axis-aligned rectangles or axis-aligned line segments.

A different kind of example are axis-aligned ellipsoids, i.e., the [[ellipsoid]]s with principal axes parallel to the coordinate axes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7820">In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[differential geometry]], a '''calibrated manifold''' is a [[Riemannian manifold]] (''M'',''g'') of dimension ''n'' equipped with a [[differential form|differential ''p''-form]] ''&amp;phi;'' (for some 0 ≤ ''p'' ≤ ''n'') which is a '''calibration,''' meaning that:
* ''&amp;phi;'' is closed: d''&amp;phi;'' = 0, where d is the [[exterior derivative]]
* for any ''x'' ∈ ''M'' and any oriented ''p''-dimensional subspace ''&amp;xi;'' of T&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'', ''&amp;phi;''|&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;xi;''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''&amp;lambda;'' vol&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;xi;''&lt;/sub&gt; with ''&amp;lambda;'' ≤ 1. Here vol&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;xi;''&lt;/sub&gt; is the volume form of ''&amp;xi;'' with respect to ''g''.
Set ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;(''&amp;phi;'') = { ''&amp;xi;'' as above : ''&amp;phi;''|&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;xi;''&lt;/sub&gt; = vol&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;xi;''&lt;/sub&gt; }. (In order for the theory to be nontrivial, we need  ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;(''&amp;phi;'') to be nonempty.) Let ''G''(''&amp;phi;'') be the union of ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;(''&amp;phi;'') for ''x'' in ''M''.

The theory of calibrations is due to R. Harvey and B. Lawson and others. Much earlier (in 1966) [[Edmond Bonan]] introduced [[G2 manifold|G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-manifold]] and  [[Spin(7)-manifold]], constructed all the parallel forms and showed that those manifolds were Ricci-flat. [[Quaternion-Kähler manifold]] were simultaneously studied  in 1967 by [[Edmond Bonan]] and Vivian Yoh Kraines and they constructed the parallel 4-form.

==Calibrated submanifolds==

A ''p''-dimensional submanifold ''&amp;Sigma;'' of ''M'' is said to be a '''calibrated submanifold''' with respect to ''&amp;phi;'' (or simply ''&amp;phi;''-calibrated) if T''&amp;Sigma;'' lies in ''G''(''&amp;phi;'').

A famous one line argument shows that calibrated ''p''-submanifolds minimize volume within their homology class. Indeed, suppose that ''&amp;Sigma;'' is calibrated, and ''&amp;Sigma;''&amp;thinsp;&amp;prime; is a ''p'' submanifold in the same homology class. Then

:&lt;math&gt;\int_\Sigma \mathrm{vol}_\Sigma = \int_\Sigma \varphi = \int_{\Sigma'} \varphi \leq \int_{\Sigma'} \mathrm{vol}_{\Sigma'}&lt;/math&gt;

where the first equality holds because ''&amp;Sigma;'' is calibrated, the second equality is [[Stokes' theorem]] (as ''&amp;phi;'' is closed), and the third inequality holds because ''&amp;phi;'' is a calibration.

==Examples==

* On a [[Kähler manifold]], suitably normalized powers of the [[Kähler form]] are calibrations, and the calibrated submanifolds are the [[complex submanifold]]s.  This follows from the [[Wirtinger inequality (2-forms)|Wirtinger inequality]].
* On a [[Calabi–Yau manifold]], the real part of a holomorphic volume form (suitably normalized) is a calibration, and the calibrated submanifolds are [[special Lagrangian submanifold]]s.
* On a [[G2 manifold|G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-manifold]], both the 3-form and the Hodge dual 4-form define calibrations. The corresponding calibrated submanifolds are called associative and coassociative submanifolds.
* On a [[Spin(7)-manifold]], the defining 4-form, known as the Cayley form, is a calibration. The corresponding calibrated submanifolds are called Cayley submanifolds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2935">The '''Cebeci–Smith model''' is a 0-equation [[eddy viscosity]] model used in [[computational fluid dynamics]] analysis of [[turbulence|turbulent]] [[boundary layer]] flows. The model gives eddy viscosity, &lt;math&gt;\mu_t&lt;/math&gt;, as a function of the local boundary layer velocity profile. The model is suitable for high-speed flows with thin attached boundary-layers, typically present in aerospace applications.  Like the [[Baldwin-Lomax model]], this model is not suitable for cases with large [[flow separation|separated]] regions and significant curvature/rotation effects.  Unlike the [[Baldwin-Lomax model]], this model requires the determination of a boundary layer edge.

The model was developed by [[Tuncer Cebeci]] and [[Apollo M. O. Smith]], in 1967.

== Equations ==

In a two-layer model, the boundary layer is considered to comprise two layers: inner (close to the surface) and outer. The eddy viscosity is calculated separately for each layer and combined using:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mu_t =
\begin{cases}
{\mu_t}_\text{inner} &amp; \mbox{if } y \le y_\text{crossover} \\ 
{\mu_t}_\text{outer} &amp; \mbox{if } y &gt; y_\text{crossover}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;y_\text{crossover}&lt;/math&gt; is the smallest distance from the surface where &lt;math&gt;{\mu_t}_\text{inner}&lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt;{\mu_t}_\text{outer}&lt;/math&gt;.

The inner-region eddy viscosity is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;
{\mu_t}_\text{inner} = \rho \ell^2 \left[\left(
 \frac{\partial U}{\partial y}\right)^2 +
 \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial x}\right)^2
\right]^{1/2}
&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;
\ell = \kappa y \left( 1 - e^{-y^+/A^+} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

with the von Karman constant &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; usually being taken as 0.4, and with

:&lt;math&gt;
A^+ = 26\left[1+y\frac{dP/dx}{\rho u_\tau^2}\right]^{-1/2}
&lt;/math&gt;

The eddy viscosity in the outer region is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;
{\mu_t}_\text{outer} = \alpha \rho U_e \delta_v^* F_K
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha=0.0168&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\delta_v^*&lt;/math&gt; is the [[displacement thickness]], given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\delta_v^* = \int_0^\delta \left(1 - \frac{U}{U_e}\right)\,dy
&lt;/math&gt;

and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt; is the Klebanoff intermittency function given by

:&lt;math&gt;
F_K = \left[1 + 5.5 \left( \frac{y}{\delta} \right)^6
  \right]^{-1}
&lt;/math&gt;

The '''Chandy-Misra-Haas algorithm resource model''' checks for [[deadlock]] in a [[distributed system]]. It was developed by K. Mani Chandy, Jayadev Misra and Laura M Haas.

== Locally dependent ==
Consider the n processes ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''4''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''5,''&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ,''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; which are performed in a single system(controller). ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt; is locally dependent on ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, if ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt; depends on ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt; on ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''3,''&lt;/sub&gt; so on and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n-1''&lt;/sub&gt; on ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. That is, if &lt;math&gt;P_1 \rightarrow P_2 \rightarrow P_3 \rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow P_n &lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; is locally dependent on &lt;math&gt;P_n&lt;/math&gt;. If ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt; is said to be locally dependent to itself if it is locally dependent on ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; depends on ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;: i.e. if &lt;math&gt;P_1 \rightarrow P_2 \rightarrow P_3 \rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow P_n \rightarrow P_1&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; is locally dependent on itself.

== Description ==

The [[algorithm]] uses a message called probe(i,j,k) to transfer a message from controller of process ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; to controller of process ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;. It specifies a message started by process ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; to find whether a deadlock has occurred or not.  Every process ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; maintains a boolean array ''dependent'' which contains the information about the processes that depend on it. Initially the values of each array are all "false".

=== Controller sending a probe ===

Before sending, the probe checks whether ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is locally dependent on itself.  If so, a deadlock occurs. Otherwise it checks whether ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; are in different controllers, are locally dependent and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is waiting for the resource that is locked by ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;. Once all the conditions are satisfied it sends the probe.

=== Controller receiving a probe ===

On the receiving side, the controller checks whether ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is performing a task. If so, it neglects the probe. Otherwise, it checks the responses given ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; to ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''dependent''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(i) is false. Once it is verified, it assigns true to ''dependent''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(i). Then it checks whether k is equal to i. If both are equal, a deadlock occurs, otherwise it sends the probe to next dependent process.

== Algorithm ==
In [[pseudocode]], the algorithm works as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Misra|first2=J.|last3=Haas|first3=L.

      '''send probe(i, a, b).''' to home site of ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; 
 '''end'''

== Example ==

[[File:Distributed Deadlock.jpg|thumb|occurrence of deadlock in distributed system]]

''P''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt; initiates deadlock detection. ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt; sends the probe saying ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt; depends on ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt;. Once the message is received by ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;, it checks whether ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt; is idle. ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt; is idle because it is locally dependent on ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''4''&lt;/sub&gt; and updates ''dependent''&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt;(2) to True.

As above, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;  sends probe to ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt; sends probe to ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;. At ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt; is idle so it update ''dependent''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;(1) to True. Therefore, deadlock can be declared.

== Complexity ==

Consider that there are "m" controllers and "p" process to perform, to declare whether a deadlock has occurred or not, the worst case for controllers and processes must be visited. Therefore, the solution is O(m+p). The time [[Computational complexity theory|complexity]] is [[Linear time|O(n)]].

In [[graph theory]], the '''clique-width''' of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a parameter that describes the structural complexity of the graph; it is closely related to [[treewidth]], but unlike treewidth it can be bounded even for [[dense graph]]s.
It is defined as the minimum number of labels needed to construct &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; by means of the following 4 operations :

#Creation of a new vertex ''v'' with label ''i'' ( noted ''i(v)'' )
#Disjoint union of two labeled graphs ''G'' and ''H'' ( denoted &lt;math&gt;G \oplus H&lt;/math&gt; )
#Joining by an edge every vertex labeled ''i'' to every vertex labeled ''j'' (denoted ''η(i,j)''), where &lt;math&gt;i \neq j&lt;/math&gt;
#Renaming label ''i'' to label ''j'' ( denoted ''ρ''(''i'',''j'') )

Graphs of bounded clique-width include the [[cograph]]s and [[distance-hereditary graph]]s. Although it is [[NP-hard]] to compute the clique-width when it is unbounded, and unknown whether it can be computed in polynomial time when it is bounded, efficient [[approximation algorithm]]s for the clique-width are known.
Based on these algorithms and on [[Courcelle's theorem]], many graph optimization problems that are NP-hard for arbitrary graphs can be solved or approximated quickly on the graphs of bounded clique-width.

The construction sequences underlying the concept of clique-width were formulated by [[Bruno Courcelle|Courcelle]], Engelfriet, and Rozenberg in 1990{{sfnp|Courcelle|Engelfriet|Rozenberg|1993}} and by {{harvtxt|Wanke|1994}}. The name "clique-width" was used for a different concept by {{harvtxt|Chlebíková|1992}}. By 1993, the term already had its present meaning.{{sfnp|Courcelle|1993}}

==Special classes of graphs==
[[Cograph]]s are exactly the graphs with clique-width at most 2.{{sfnp|Courcelle|Olariu|2000}} Every [[distance-hereditary graph]] has clique-width at most 3. However, the clique-width of unit interval graphs is unbounded (based on their grid structure).{{sfnp|Golumbic|Rotics|2000}} 
Similarly, the clique-width of bipartite permutation graphs is unbounded (based on similar grid structure).{{sfnp|Brandstädt|Lozin|2003}}   
Based on the characterization of cographs as the graphs without induced subgraph isomorphic to a chordless path with four vertices, the clique-width of many graph classes defined by forbidden induced subgraphs has been classified.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Brandstädt|Dragan|Le|Mosca|2005}}; {{harvtxt|Brandstädt|Engelfriet|Le|Lozin|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other graphs with bounded clique-width include the [[Leaf power|{{mvar|k}}-leaf powers]] for bounded values of {{mvar|k}}; these are the [[induced subgraph]]s of the leaves of a tree {{mvar|T}} in the [[graph power]] {{math|''T''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. However, leaf powers with unbounded exponents do not have bounded clique-width.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Brandstädt|Hundt|2008}}; {{harvtxt|Gurski|Wanke|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bounds==
{{harvtxt|Courcelle|Olariu|2000}} and {{harvtxt|Corneil|Rotics|2005}} proved the following bounds on the clique-width of certain graphs:
*If a graph has clique-width at most {{mvar|k}}, then so does every [[induced subgraph]] of the graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Courcelle|Olariu|2000}}, Corollary&amp;nbsp;3.3.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[complement graph]] of a graph of clique-width {{mvar|k}} has clique-width at most {{math|2''k''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Courcelle|Olariu|2000}}, Theorem&amp;nbsp;4.1.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The graphs of [[treewidth]] {{mvar|w}} have clique-width at most {{math|3 &amp;middot; 2&lt;sup&gt;''w'' &amp;minus; 1&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The exponential dependence in this bound is necessary: there exist graphs whose clique-width is exponentially larger than their treewidth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Corneil|Rotics|2005}}, strengthening {{harvtxt|Courcelle|Olariu|2000}}, Theorem&amp;nbsp;5.5.&lt;/ref&gt; In the other direction, graphs of bounded clique-width can have unbounded treewidth; for instance, {{mvar|n}}-vertex [[complete graph]]s have clique-width 2 but treewidth {{math|''n'' &amp;minus; 1}}. However, graphs of clique-width {{mvar|k}} that have no [[complete bipartite graph]] {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;''t'',''t''&lt;/sub&gt;}} as a subgraph have treewidth at most {{math|3''k''(''t'' &amp;minus; 1) &amp;minus; 1}}. Therefore, for every family of [[sparse graph]]s, having bounded treewidth is equivalent to having bounded clique-width.{{sfnp|Gurski|Wanke|2000}}
*Another graph parameter, the [[rank-width]], is bounded in both directions by the clique-width: rank-width ≤ clique-width ≤ 2&lt;sup&gt;rank-width + 1&lt;/sup&gt;.{{sfnp|Oum|Seymour|2006}}

Additionally, if a graph {{mvar|G}} has clique-width {{mvar|k}}, then the [[graph power]] {{math|''G''&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;}} has clique-width at most {{math|2''kc''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.{{sfnp|Todinca|2003}} Although there is an exponential gap in both the bound for clique-width from treewidth and the bound for clique-width of graph powers, these bounds do not compound each other:
if a graph {{mvar|G}} has treewidth {{mvar|w}}, then {{math|''G''&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;}} has clique-width at most {{math|2(''c'' + 1)&lt;sup&gt;''w'' + 1&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; 2}}, only singly exponential in the treewidth.{{sfnp|Gurski|Wanke|2009}}

==Computational complexity==
{{unsolved|mathematics|Can graphs of bounded clique-width be recognized in polynomial time?}}
Many optimization problems that are [[NP-hard]] for more general classes of graphs may be solved efficiently by [[dynamic programming]] on graphs of bounded clique-width, when a construction sequence for these graphs is known.{{sfnp|Cogis|Thierry|2005}}{{sfnp|Courcelle|Makowsky|Rotics|2000}} In particular, every [[graph property]] that can be expressed in MSO&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; [[monadic second-order logic]] (a form of logic allowing quantification over sets of vertices) has a linear-time algorithm for graphs of bounded clique-width, by a form of [[Courcelle's theorem]].{{sfnp|Courcelle|Makowsky|Rotics|2000}}

It is also possible to find optimal [[graph coloring]]s or [[Hamiltonian cycle]]s for graphs of bounded clique-width in polynomial time, when a construction sequence is known, but the exponent of the polynomial increases with the clique-width, and evidence from computational complexity theory shows that this dependence is likely to be necessary.{{sfnp|Fomin|Golovach|Lokshtanov|Saurabh|2010}}
The graphs of bounded clique-width are [[χ-bounded|{{mvar|χ}}-bounded]], meaning that their chromatic number is at most a function of the size of their largest clique.{{sfnp|Dvořák|Král'|2012}}

The graphs of clique-width three can be recognized, and a construction sequence found for them, in polynomial time using an algorithm based on [[split decomposition]].{{sfnp|Corneil|Habib|Lanlignel|Reed|2012}}
For graphs of unbounded clique-width, it is [[NP-hard]] to compute the clique-width exactly, and also NP-hard to obtain an approximation with sublinear additive error.{{sfnp|Fellows|Rosamond|Rotics|Szeider|2009}} However, when the clique-width is bounded, it is possible to obtain a construction sequence of bounded width (exponentially larger than the actual clique-width) in polynomial time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Oum|Seymour|2006}}; {{harvtxt|Hliněný|Oum|2008}}; {{harvtxt|Oum|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It remains open whether the exact clique-width, or a tighter approximation to it, can be calculated in [[parameterized complexity|fixed-parameter tractable time]], whether it can be calculated in polynomial time for every fixed bound on the clique-width, or even whether the graphs of clique-width four can be recognized in polynomial time.{{sfnp|Fellows|Rosamond|Rotics|Szeider|2009}}

==Relation to treewidth==
The theory of graphs of bounded clique-width resembles that for graphs of bounded [[treewidth]], but unlike treewidth allows for [[dense graph]]s. If a family of graphs has bounded clique-width, then either it has bounded treewidth or every [[complete bipartite graph]] is a subgraph of a graph in the family.{{sfnp|Gurski|Wanke|2000}} Treewidth and clique-width are also connected through the theory of [[line graph]]s: a family of graphs has bounded treewidth if and only if their line graphs have bounded clique-width.{{sfnp|Gurski|Wanke|2007}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1534">{{About|conjugation by changing the sign of a square root|other uses|Conjugate (disambiguation)}}
In [[mathematics]], the '''conjugate''' of an expression of the form &lt;math&gt;a+b\sqrt d&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;a-b\sqrt d,&lt;/math&gt; provided that &lt;math&gt;\sqrt d&lt;/math&gt; does not appear in {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}. One says also that the two expressions are conjugate. In particular, the conjugate of a root of a [[quadratic polynomial]] is the other root, obtained by changing the sign of the [[square root]] appearing in the [[quadratic formula]].

[[Complex conjugation]] is the special case where the square root is &lt;math&gt;i=\sqrt{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

As
:&lt;math&gt;(a+b\sqrt d)(a-b\sqrt d)= a^2-db^2,&lt;/math&gt;
and
::&lt;math&gt;(a+b\sqrt d) + (a-b\sqrt d)= 2a,&lt;/math&gt;
the sum and the product of conjugate expressions do not involve the square root anymore.

This property is used for removing a square root from a [[denominator]], by multiplying the [[numerator]] and the denominator of a [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] by the conjugate of the denominator (see [[rationalisation (mathematics)|rationalisation]]). Typically, one has
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a_1+b_1\sqrt d}{a_2+b_2\sqrt d} = \frac{(a_1+b_1\sqrt d)(a_2-b_2\sqrt d)}{(a_2+b_2\sqrt d)(a_2-b_2\sqrt d)} 
= \frac{a_1a_2-db_1b_2+(a_2b_1-a_1b_2)\sqrt d}{a_2^2-db_2^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
In particular
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{a+b\sqrt d} = \frac{a-b\sqrt d}{a^2-db^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

A first-order language of the [[real numbers]] is the set of all well-formed sentences of [[first-order logic]] that involve [[universal quantifier|universal]] and [[existential quantifier]]s and logical combinations of equalities and inequalities of expressions over real variables. The corresponding first-order [[Theory (mathematical logic)|theory]] is the set of sentences that are actually true of the real numbers. There are several different such theories, with different expressive power, depending on the primitive operations that are allowed to be used in the expression. A fundamental question in the study of these theories is whether they are [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]]: that is, is there an [[algorithm]] that can take a sentence as input and produce as output an answer "yes" or "no" to the question of whether the sentence is true in the theory.

The theory of [[real closed fields]] is the theory in which the primitives operations are multiplication and addition; this implies that, in this theory, the only numbers that can be defined are the real [[algebraic number]]s. As proven by [[Alfred Tarski|Tarski]], it is decidable; see [[Tarski–Seidenberg theorem]] and [[Quantifier elimination]]. Current implementations of decision procedures for the theory of real closed fields are often based on quantifier elimination by [[cylindrical algebraic decomposition]].

[[Tarski's exponential function problem]] concerns the extension of this theory to another primitive operation, the [[exponential function]]. It is an open problem whether it is decidable, but if [[Schanuel's conjecture]] holds then the decidability of this theory would follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=A.J. |last=Macintyre|first2=   A.J. |last2=Wilkie|chapter=On the decidability of the real exponential field|editor-first= P.G.|editor-last= Odifreddi |title= Kreisel 70th Birthday Volume |publisher= CLSI  |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{springer|id=M/m110160|first=S.|last= Kuhlmann|title=Model theory of the real exponential function}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the extension of the theory of real closed fields with the [[sine function]] is undecidable since this allows encoding of the undecidable theory of integers (see [[Richardson's theorem]]).

Still, one can handle the undecidable case with functions such as sine by using algorithms that do not necessarily terminate always. Especially, one can design algorithms that are only required to terminate for input formulas that are [[Robustness|robust]], that is, formulas, whose satisfiability does not change if the formula is slightly perturbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Stefan|last=Ratschan|title=Efficient Solving of Quantified Inequality Constraints over the Real Numbers|journal=ACM Transactions on Computational Logic|volume=7|number=4|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, it is also possible to use purely heuristic approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Behzad|last=Akbarpour|first2=Lawrence Charles|last2=Paulson|title=MetiTarski: An Automatic Theorem Prover for Real-Valued Special Functions|journal=Journal of Automated Reasoning|year=2010|volume=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1339">In [[cryptography]], a '''distribution ensemble''' or '''probability ensemble''' is a family of distributions or [[random variable]]s &lt;math&gt;X = \{X_i\}_{i \in I}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is a ([[countable]]) index set, and each &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; is a random variable, or probability distribution. Often &lt;math&gt;I=\N&lt;/math&gt; and it is required that each &lt;math&gt;X_n&lt;/math&gt; have a certain property for ''n'' sufficiently large.

For example, a '''uniform ensemble''' &lt;math&gt;U = \{U_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt; is a distribution ensemble where each &lt;math&gt;U_n&lt;/math&gt; is [[Uniform distribution (discrete)|uniformly distributed]] over strings of length&amp;nbsp;''n''. In fact, many applications of probability ensembles implicitly assume that the probability spaces for the random variables all coincide in this way, so every probability ensemble is also a [[Stochastic_process#Definitions|stochastic process]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5250">In [[extremal graph theory]], the '''Erdős–Stone theorem''' is an [[asymptotic]] result generalising [[Turán's theorem]] to bound the number of edges in an ''H''-free graph for a non-complete graph ''H''. It is named after [[Paul Erdős]] and [[Arthur Stone (mathematician)|Arthur Stone]], who proved it in 1946,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Erdős |first=P. |authorlink=Paul Erdős |author2=Stone, A. H. |authorlink2=Arthur Stone (mathematician)  |year=1946 |title=On the structure of linear graphs |journal=[[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]] |volume=52  |pages=1087–1091 |doi=10.1090/S0002-9904-1946-08715-7 |issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;   and it has been described as the “fundamental theorem of extremal graph theory”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bollobás |first=Béla |authorlink=Béla Bollobás |title=Modern Graph Theory |year=1998 |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] |location=New York |isbn=0-387-98491-7 |pages=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extremal functions of Turán graphs==
The extremal function ex(''n'';&amp;nbsp;''H'') is defined to be the maximum number of edges in a graph of order ''n'' not containing a subgraph isomorphic to ''H''.  Turán's theorem says that ex(''n'';&amp;nbsp;''K''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''n''), the order of the [[Turán graph]], and that the Turán graph is the unique extremal graph.  The Erdős–Stone theorem extends this to graphs not containing ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''), the complete ''r''-partite graph with ''t'' vertices in each class (equivalently the [[Turán graph]] ''T''(''rt'',''r'')):

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{ex}(n; K_r(t)) = \left( \frac{r-2}{r-1} + o(1) \right){n\choose2}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Extremal functions of arbitrary non-bipartite graphs==
If ''H'' is an arbitrary graph whose [[chromatic number]] is ''r''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;2, then ''H'' is contained in ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') whenever ''t'' is at least as large as the largest color class in an ''r''-coloring of ''H'', but it is not contained in the Turán graph ''T''(''n'',''r''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1) (because every subgraph of this Turán graph may be colored with ''r''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 colors).
It follows that the extremal function for ''H'' is at least as large as the number of edges in ''T''(''n'',''r''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1), and at most equal to the extremal function for ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''); that is,
:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{ex}(n; H) = \left( \frac{r-2}{r-1} + o(1) \right){n\choose2}.&lt;/math&gt;

For [[bipartite graph]]s ''H'', however, the theorem does not give a tight bound on the extremal function. It is known that, when ''H'' is bipartite, ex(''n'';&amp;nbsp;''H'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''o''(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and for general bipartite graphs little more is known. See [[Zarankiewicz problem]] for more on the extremal functions of bipartite graphs.

==Quantitative results==

Several versions of the theorem have been proved that more precisely characterise the relation of ''n'', ''r'', ''t'' and the [[Little-o notation|''o''(1)]] term.  Define the notation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bollobás |first=Béla |authorlink=Béla Bollobás |editor= [[Ronald Graham|R. L. Graham]], [[Martin Grötschel|M. Grötschel]] and [[László Lovász|L.

contains a ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'').

Erdős and Stone proved that
:&lt;math&gt;s_{r,\varepsilon}(n) \geq \left(\underbrace{\log\cdots\log}_{r-1} n\right)^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;

The correct order of ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''r'',&amp;epsilon;&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') in terms of ''n'' was found by Bollobás and Erdős:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bollobás |first=B. |authorlink=Béla Bollobás |author2=Erdős, P. |authorlink2=Paul Erdős  |year=1973 |title=On the structure of edge graphs |journal=[[Bulletin of the London Mathematical Society]] |volume=5 |pages=317–321 |doi=10.1112/blms/5.3.317 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; for any given ''r'' and &amp;epsilon; there are constants ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''r'',&amp;nbsp;&amp;epsilon;) and ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''r'',&amp;nbsp;&amp;epsilon;) such that ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''r'',&amp;nbsp;&amp;epsilon;)&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''s''&lt;sub&gt;''r'',&amp;epsilon;&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''r'',&amp;nbsp;&amp;epsilon;)&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n''.

[[Image:Extreme points.svg|thumb|right|A convex set in light blue, and its extreme points in red.]]

In [[mathematics]], an '''extreme point''' of a [[convex set]] ''S'' in a real [[vector space]] is a point in S which does not lie in any open [[line segment]] joining two points of ''S''. Intuitively, an extreme point is a "vertex" of ''S''.

* The [[Krein–Milman theorem]] states that if ''S'' is convex and [[compact space|compact]] in a [[locally convex space]], then ''S'' is the closed [[convex hull]] of its extreme points: In particular, such a set has extreme points.

The Krein–Milman theorem is stated for locally convex topological vector spaces. The next theorems are stated for [[Banach space]]s with the [[Radon–Nikodym property]]:
* A theorem of [[Joram Lindenstrauss]] states that, in a Banach space with the Radon–Nikodym property, a nonempty [[closed set|closed]] and [[bounded set]] has an extreme point. (In infinite-dimensional spaces, the property of [[compact space|compactness]] is stronger than the joint properties of being closed and being bounded).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Artstein|1980|p=173}}: {{cite journal|last=Artstein|first=Zvi|title=Discrete&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;continuous bang-bang and facial&amp;nbsp;spaces, or: Look for the extreme points|journal=SIAM Review|volume=22|year=1980|number=2|pages=172–185|doi=10.1137/1022026|mr=564562|jstor=2029960|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A theorem of [[Gerald Edgar]] states that,  in a Banach space with the Radon–Nikodym property, a closed and bounded set is the closed convex hull of its extreme points: {{quote |text=Let ''E'' be a Banach space with the Radon-Nikodym property, let ''C'' be a separable, closed, bounded, convex subset of ''E'', and let ''a'' be a point in ''C''.

== ''k''-extreme points ==

More generally, a point in a convex set ''S'' is '''''k''-extreme''' if it lies in the interior of a ''k''-dimensional convex set within ''S'', but not a ''k+1''-dimensional convex set within ''S''.  Thus, an extreme point is also a 0-extreme point.  If ''S'' is a polytope, then the ''k''-extreme points are exactly the interior points of the ''k''-dimensional faces of ''S''.  More generally, for any convex set ''S'', the ''k''-extreme points are partitioned into ''k''-dimensional open faces.

The finite-dimensional Krein-Milman theorem, which is due to Minkowski, can be quickly proved using the concept of ''k''-extreme points.  If ''S'' is closed, bounded, and ''n''-dimensional, and if ''p'' is a point in ''S'', then ''p'' is ''k''-extreme for some ''k'' &lt; ''n''.  The theorem asserts that ''p'' is a convex combination of extreme points.  If ''k'' = 0, then it's trivially true.  Otherwise ''p'' lies on a line segment in ''S'' which can be maximally extended (because ''S'' is closed and bounded).  If the endpoints of the segment are ''q'' and ''r'', then their extreme rank must be less than that of ''p'', and the theorem follows by induction.

'''FORK-256''' is a [[hash algorithm]] designed in response to security issues discovered in the earlier  [[SHA-1]] and [[MD5]] algorithms.  After substantial [[cryptanalysis]], the algorithm is considered broken.

==Background==
In 2005, [[Wang Xiaoyun|Xiaoyun Wang]] announced an order-&lt;math&gt;2^{63}&lt;/math&gt; [[collision attack]] on the government's hash standard [[SHA-1]].&lt;ref name=Wang2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schneier2005/&gt;  The [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST), the body responsible for setting cryptographic standards in the United States, concluded this was a practical attack (as previous estimates were order-&lt;math&gt;2^{80}&lt;/math&gt;) and began encouraging additional research into hash functions and their weaknesses.&lt;ref name=Chen2006/&gt;  As part of this effort, NIST hosted two workshops where potential new algorithms, including FORK-256, were introduced and discussed.&lt;ref name=Chang2005/&gt;  Rather than immediately select any of these algorithms, NIST conducted a public competition from 2007&amp;ndash;2012 which ultimately resulted in the Keccak algorithm being selected for use as the [[SHA-3]] standard.&lt;ref name=NIST1/&gt;

==Algorithm and Analysis==
FORK-256 was introduced at the 2005 NIST Hash workshop and published the following year.&lt;ref name=Hong2006/&gt; FORK-256 uses 512-bit [[Block (telecommunications)|blocks]] and implements preset constants that change after each repetition.  Each block is hashed into a 256-bit block through four branches that divides each 512 block into sixteen 32-bit words that are further encrypted and rearranged.

The initial algorithm garnered significant [[cryptanalysis]], summarized in (Saarinen 2007).&lt;ref name=Saarinen2007/&gt;  Matusiewicz ''et al.'' (2006) discovered a [[collision attack]] with [[Computational complexity theory|complexity]] of &lt;math&gt;2^{126.6}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Matusiewicz2006/&gt; Mendel ''et al.'' (2006) independently derived a similar attack.&lt;ref name=Mendel2006/&gt;  The following year Matusiewicz's team improved their attack to no worse than &lt;math&gt;2^{108},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=Matusiewicz2007/&gt; and (Contini 2007) demonstrated a practical implementation of the attack.&lt;ref name=Contini2007/&gt;

In response to these attacks, Hong and his team proposed an improved version of FORK-256.&lt;ref name=Hong2007/&gt;  Markku-Juhani Saarinen derived a &lt;math&gt;2^{112.9}&lt;/math&gt;-complexity attack again the improved algorithm.&lt;ref name=Saarinen2007/&gt;  By was of comparison, the eventual SHA-3 standard withstands up to an order-&lt;math&gt;2^{128}&lt;/math&gt; attack.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

==Deployment==
FORK-256 was added to the [[Botan (programming library)|Botan]] cryptographic library after its introduction.  Botan developer Jack Lloyd removed the algorithm in 2010 after concluding the hash suffered from several weaknesses and had never become widely used.&lt;ref name=Botan/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17756">In [[mathematics]], '''Faulhaber's formula''', named after [[Johann Faulhaber]], expresses the sum of the ''p''-th powers of the first ''n'' positive integers

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^n k^p = 1^p + 2^p + 3^p + \cdots + n^p&lt;/math&gt;
 	
as a (''p''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)th-degree [[polynomial]] function of&amp;nbsp;''n'', the coefficients involving [[Bernoulli number]]s ''B&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'', in the form submitted by [[Jacob Bernoulli]] and published in 1713:
 	
: &lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=1}^n k^{p} = \frac{n^{p+1}}{p+1}+\frac{1}{2}n^p+\sum_{k=2}^p \frac{B_{k}}{k!}p^\underline{k-1}n^{p-k+1},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;p^\underline{k-1}=(p)_{k-1}=\dfrac{p!}{(p-k+1)!}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[falling factorial]].

== History ==
Faulhaber's formula is also called '''Bernoulli's formula'''. Faulhaber did not know the properties of the coefficients discovered by Bernoulli. Rather, he knew at least the first 17 cases, as well as the existence of the Faulhaber polynomials for odd powers described below.&lt;ref name="Knuth1993"&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Donald E. Knuth]] |title=Johann Faulhaber and sums of powers |journal=Mathematics of Computation |year=1993 |volume=61 |pages=277&amp;ndash;294 |arxiv=math.CA/9207222|doi=10.2307/2152953|issue=203|ref=harv|postscript=.|jstor=2152953}} The arxiv.org paper has a misprint in the formula for the sum of 11th powers, which was corrected in the printed version. [http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/papers/jfsp.tex.gz Correct version.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A rigorous proof of these formulas and his assertion that such formulas would exist for all odd powers took until {{harvs|authorlink=Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi|first=Carl|last=Jacobi|year=1834|txt}}.

==Faulhaber polynomials==
The term ''Faulhaber polynomials'' is used by some authors to refer to something other than the polynomial sequence given above.  Faulhaber observed that '''if ''p'' is odd''', then

:&lt;math&gt;1^p + 2^p + 3^p + \cdots + n^p &lt;/math&gt;

is a polynomial function of

:&lt;math&gt;a=1+2+3+\cdots+n= \frac{n(n+1)}{2}. &lt;/math&gt;

In particular:

:&lt;math&gt;1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + \cdots + n^3 = a^2;&lt;/math&gt; {{OEIS2C|A000537}}

&lt;!-- spacing for easier legibility --&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;1^5 + 2^5 + 3^5 + \cdots + n^5 = {4a^3 - a^2 \over 3};&lt;/math&gt; {{OEIS2C|A000539}}

&lt;!-- spacing for easier legibility --&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;1^7 + 2^7 + 3^7 + \cdots + n^7 = {6a^4 -4a^3 + a^2 \over 3};&lt;/math&gt; {{OEIS2C|A000541}}

&lt;!-- spacing for easier legibility --&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;1^9 + 2^9 + 3^9 + \cdots + n^9 = {16a^5 - 20a^4 +12a^3 - 3a^2 \over 5};&lt;/math&gt; {{OEIS2C|A007487}}

&lt;!-- spacing for easier legibility --&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;1^{11} + 2^{11} + 3^{11} + \cdots + n^{11} = {16a^6 - 32a^5 + 34a^4 - 20a^3 + 5a^2 \over 3}.&lt;/math&gt; {{OEIS2C|A123095}}

The first of these [[Identity (mathematics)|identities]] (the case ''p'' = 3) is known as [[Squared triangular number|Nicomachus's theorem]].

More generally, {{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 1^{2m+1} + 2^{2m+1} &amp;+ 3^{2m+1} + \cdots + n^{2m+1}\\ &amp;= \frac{1}{2^{2m+2}(2m+2)} \sum_{q=0}^m \binom{2m+2}{2q}
(2-2^{2q})~ B_{2q} ~\left[(8a+1)^{m+1-q}-1\right].
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Some authors call the polynomials in ''a'' on the right-hand sides of these identities '''Faulhaber polynomials'''.  These polynomials are divisible by {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} because the [[Bernoulli number]] {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is 0 for {{math|''j'' &gt; 1}} odd.

Faulhaber also knew that if a sum for an odd power is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^n k^{2m+1} = c_1 a^2 + c_2 a^3 + \cdots + c_m a^{m+1}&lt;/math&gt;

then the sum for the even power just below is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^n k^{2m} = \frac{n+1/2}{2m+1}(2 c_1 a + 3 c_2 a^2+\cdots + (m+1) c_m a^m).&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the polynomial in parentheses is the derivative of the polynomial above with respect to ''a''.

Since ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)/2, these formulae show that for an odd power (greater than&amp;nbsp;1), the sum is a polynomial in ''n'' having factors ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, while for an even power the polynomial has factors ''n'', ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;½ and ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1.

==''Summae Potestatum''==
[[File:JakobBernoulliSummaePotestatum.png|thumb|right|480px|Jakob Bernoulli's ''Summae Potestatum'', [[Ars Conjectandi]], 1713]]

In 1713, [[Jacob Bernoulli]] published under the title ''Summae Potestatum'' an expression of the sum of the {{mvar|p}} powers of the {{math|''n''}} first integers as a ({{math|''p'' + 1}})th-degree [[polynomial function]] of&amp;nbsp;{{math|''n''}}, with coefficients involving numbers {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, now called [[Bernoulli number]]s:
: &lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=1}^n k^{p} = \frac{n^{p+1}}{p+1}+\frac{1}{2}n^p+\sum_{k=2}^p \frac{B_{k}}{k!}p^{\underline{k-1}}n^{p-k+1}.&lt;/math&gt;
Introducing also the first two Bernoulli numbers (which Bernoulli did not), the previous formula becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^n k^p = {1 \over p+1} \sum_{j=0}^p {p+1 \choose j} B_j n^{p+1-j},&lt;/math&gt;
using the Bernoulli number of the second kind for which &lt;math&gt;B_1=\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, or
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^n k^p = {1 \over p+1} \sum_{j=0}^p (-1)^j{p+1 \choose j} B_j n^{p+1-j},&lt;/math&gt;
using the Bernoulli number of the first kind for which &lt;math&gt;B_1=-\frac{1}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

For example, as
&lt;math&gt;B_0=1,~B_1=1/2,~B_2=1/6,~B_3=0,~B_4=-1/30,&lt;/math&gt; one has for {{math|1=''p'' = 4}},
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}1^4 + 2^4 + 3^4 + \cdots + n^4 &amp;= {1 \over 5} \sum_{j=0}^4 {5 \choose j} B_j n^{5-j}\\
&amp;= {1 \over 5} \left(B_0 n^5+5B_1n^4+10B_2n^3+10B_3n^2+5B_4n\right)\\
&amp;= \frac{1}{5}n^5 + \frac{1}{2}n^4+ \frac{1}{3}n^3- \frac{1}{30}n.\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Faulhaber himself did not know the formula in this form, but only computed the first seventeen polynomials; the general form was established with the discovery of the [[Bernoulli numbers]] (see [[#History|History section]]).  The derivation of Faulhaber's formula is available in ''The Book of Numbers'' by [[John Horton Conway]] and [[Richard K. Guy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[John H. Conway]], [[Richard K. Guy|Richard Guy]] |title=The Book of Numbers |publisher=Springer |year=1996 |isbn=0-387-97993-X |page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a similar (but somehow simpler) expression: using the idea of [[Telescoping series|telescoping]] and the [[binomial theorem]], one gets ''[[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]]'s identity'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kieren MacMillan, Jonathan Sondow|title=Proofs of power sum and binomial coefficient congruences via Pascal's identity |journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly]] |year=2011 |volume=118 |pages=549&amp;ndash;551 |doi=10.4169/amer.math.monthly.118.06.549|arxiv=1011.0076}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}(n+1)^{k+1} - 1 &amp;= \sum_{m = 1}^n \left((m+1)^{k+1} - m^{k+1}\right)\\
&amp;= \sum_{p = 0}^k \binom{k+1}{p} (1^p+2^p+ \dots + n^p).\end{align}&lt;/math&gt; 
This&lt;!-- due to Pascal--&gt; in particular yields the examples below – e.g., take {{math|1=''k'' = 1}} to get the first example.

==Examples==

:&lt;math&gt;1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{n^2 + n}{2}&lt;/math&gt; (the [[triangular number]]s)

:&lt;math&gt;1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + \cdots + n^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} = \frac{2n^3 + 3n^2 + n}{6}&lt;/math&gt; (the [[square pyramidal number]]s)

:&lt;math&gt;1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + \cdots + n^3 = \left[\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right]^2 = \frac{n^4 + 2n^3 + n^2}{4}&lt;/math&gt; (the [[squared triangular number]]s)

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
1^4 + 2^4 + 3^4 + \cdots + n^4 &amp; = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)(3n^2+3n-1)}{30} \\
&amp; = \frac{6n^5 + 15n^4 + 10n^3 - n}{30}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
1^5 + 2^5 + 3^5 + \cdots + n^5 &amp; = \frac{[n(n+1)]^2(2n^2+2n-1)}{12} \\
&amp; = \frac{2n^6 + 6n^5 + 5n^4 - n^2}{12}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
1^6 + 2^6 + 3^6 + \cdots + n^6 &amp; = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)(3n^4+6n^3-3n+1)}{42} \\
&amp; = \frac{6n^7 + 21n^6 + 21n^5 -7n^3 + n}{42}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

==From examples to matrix theorem==
From the previous examples we get:
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n i^0 = n  &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n i^1 = {1\over 2}n+{1\over 2}n^2 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n i^2 = {1\over 6}n+{1\over 2}n^2+{1\over 3}n^3 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n i^3 = {1\over 4}n^2+{1\over 2}n^3+{1\over 4}n^4 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n i^4 = -{1\over 30}n+{1\over 3}n^3+{1\over 2}n^4+{1\over 5}n^5 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n i^5 = -{1\over 12}n^2+{5\over 12}n^4+{1\over 2}n^5+{1\over 6}n^6 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n i^6 = {1\over 42}n-{1\over 6}n^3+{1\over 2}n^5+{1\over 2}n^6+{1\over 7}n^7 &lt;/math&gt;
:Writing these polynomials as a product between matrices gives
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^0 \\
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^1 \\
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 \\
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^3 \\
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^4 \\
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^5 \\
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^6 \\

\end{pmatrix}=G_7\cdot\begin{pmatrix}
n \\
n^2 \\
n^3 \\
n^4\\
n^5 \\
n^6 \\
n^7 \\

\end{pmatrix}
\qquad \text{where}\qquad

G_7=\begin{pmatrix}
1&amp; 0&amp; 0&amp; 0&amp; 0&amp;0&amp; 0\\
{1\over 2}&amp; {1\over 2}&amp; 0&amp; 0&amp; 0&amp; 0&amp; 0\\
{1\over 6}&amp; {1\over 2}&amp;{1\over 3}&amp; 0&amp; 0&amp; 0&amp; 0\\
0&amp; {1\over 4}&amp; {1\over 2}&amp; {1\over 4}&amp; 0&amp;0&amp; 0\\
-{1\over 30}&amp; 0&amp; {1\over 3}&amp; {1\over 2}&amp; {1\over 5}&amp;0&amp; 0\\
0&amp; -{1\over 12}&amp; 0&amp; {5\over 12}&amp; {1\over 2}&amp; {1\over 6}&amp; 0\\
{1\over 42}&amp; 0&amp; -{1\over 6}&amp; 0&amp; {1\over 2}&amp;{1\over 2}&amp; {1\over 7}\\

\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

:
Surprisingly, [[invertible matrix|inverting the matrix]] of polynomial coefficients yields something more familiar:
:&lt;math&gt;
G_7^{-1}=\begin{pmatrix}
 1&amp;  0&amp;   0&amp;   0&amp;   0&amp;   0&amp; 0\\
-1&amp;  2&amp;   0&amp;   0&amp;   0&amp;   0&amp; 0\\
 1&amp; -3&amp;   3&amp;   0&amp;   0&amp;   0&amp; 0\\
-1&amp;  4&amp;  -6&amp;   4&amp;   0&amp;   0&amp; 0\\
 1&amp; -5&amp;  10&amp; -10&amp;   5&amp;   0&amp; 0\\
-1&amp;  6&amp; -15&amp;  20&amp; -15&amp;   6&amp; 0\\
 1&amp; -7&amp;  21&amp; -35&amp;  35&amp; -21&amp; 7\\

\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

In the inverted matrix, the [[Pascal triangle]] is recognized but without the last element of each line and with alternate signs.

We define &lt;math&gt;A_7&lt;/math&gt; to be the Pascal triangle without the last element of each line: 
:&lt;math&gt;
A_7=\begin{pmatrix}
1&amp; 0&amp;  0&amp;  0&amp;  0&amp;  0&amp; 0\\
1&amp; 2&amp;  0&amp;  0&amp;  0&amp;  0&amp; 0\\
1&amp; 3&amp;  3&amp;  0&amp;  0&amp;  0&amp; 0\\
1&amp; 4&amp;  6&amp;  4&amp;  0&amp;  0&amp; 0\\
1&amp; 5&amp; 10&amp; 10&amp;  5&amp;  0&amp; 0\\
1&amp; 6&amp; 15&amp; 20&amp; 15&amp;  6&amp; 0\\
1&amp; 7&amp; 21&amp; 35&amp; 35&amp; 21&amp; 7\\
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
Further, we define &lt;math&gt;\overline{A}_7&lt;/math&gt; to be &lt;math&gt;A_7&lt;/math&gt; with alternate signs, which is &lt;math&gt;A_7&lt;/math&gt; with the following operation performed on each element: &lt;math&gt;\textstyle a_{i,j} \to (-1)^{i+j}a_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt;.

And we can conclude that &lt;math&gt;G_7&lt;/math&gt; has the property that &lt;math&gt;G_7^{-1}=\overline{A}_7&lt;/math&gt;.

As it has been discovered and proved,&lt;ref&gt;*{{citation |first=Giorgio|last=Pietrocola|title=On polynomials for the calculation of sums of powers of successive integers and Bernoulli numbers deduced from the Pascal’s triangle|year=2017 |url=http://www.pietrocola.eu/EN/Theoremsonthesumofpowersofsuccessiveintegersbygiorgiopietrocola%20.pdf}}.
&lt;/ref&gt; this case is generalizable. For each positive integer m &lt;math&gt;G_m^{-1}=\overline{A}_m&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus, it is possible to obtain the coefficients of the polynomials of the sums of powers of successive integers without resorting to the numbers of Bernoulli but by reversing the matrix easily obtained from the triangle of Pascal.

Similarly Nigel Derby in his paper&lt;ref&gt;*{{citation |first=Nigel|last=Derby|title=A search for sums of powers |journal=The Mathematical Gazette| year=2015 |url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/f8786728002514b2de4eaa379d175640/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=2035960}}.
&lt;/ref&gt; shows that the vector of the coefficients of Faulhaber polynomials is obtained by multiplying a complete line vector of the Pascal triangle for a triangular matrix extracted. For example in the case already considered:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}

1&amp; 6&amp; 15&amp; 20&amp; 15&amp; 6&amp; 1\\
\end{pmatrix}\cdot A_7^{-1}=\begin{pmatrix}

{1\over 42}&amp; 0&amp; -{1\over 6}&amp; 0&amp; {1\over 2}&amp;{1\over 2}&amp; {1\over 7}

\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A_7&lt;/math&gt; is like &lt;math&gt;\overline A_7&lt;/math&gt; but with all positive elements and
:&lt;math&gt;A_7^{-1}=\overline G_7=\begin{pmatrix}
1&amp; 0&amp; 0&amp; 0&amp; 0&amp;0&amp; 0\\
-{1\over 2}&amp; {1\over 2}&amp; 0&amp; 0&amp; 0&amp; 0&amp; 0\\
{1\over 6}&amp; -{1\over 2}&amp;{1\over 3}&amp; 0&amp; 0&amp; 0&amp; 0\\
0&amp; {1\over 4}&amp; -{1\over 2}&amp; {1\over 4}&amp; 0&amp;0&amp; 0\\
-{1\over 30}&amp; 0&amp; {1\over 3}&amp; -{1\over 2}&amp; {1\over 5}&amp;0&amp; 0\\
0&amp; -{1\over 12}&amp; 0&amp; {5\over 12}&amp; -{1\over 2}&amp; {1\over 6}&amp; 0\\
{1\over 42}&amp; 0&amp; -{1\over 6}&amp; 0&amp; {1\over 2}&amp;-{1\over 2}&amp; {1\over 7}\\

\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

==Proof with complex numbers==
Let 
:&lt;math&gt;
S_{p}(n)=\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^p,
&lt;/math&gt;
denote the sum under consideration for integer &lt;math&gt;p\ge 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Define the following exponential [[generating function]] with (initially) indeterminate &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
G(z,n)=\sum_{p=0}^{\infty} S_{p}(n) \frac{1}{p!}z^p.
&lt;/math&gt;
We find 
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
G(z,n) =&amp; \sum_{p=0}^{\infty} \sum_{k=1}^{n}  \frac{1}{p!}(kz)^p
=\sum_{k=1}^{n}e^{kz}=e^{z}.\frac{1-e^{nz}}{1-e^{z}},\\
=&amp; \frac{1-e^{nz}}{e^{-z}-1}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
This is an entire function in &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; can be taken to be any complex number.

We next recall the exponential generating function for the [[Bernoulli polynomials]] &lt;math&gt;B_j(x)&lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{ze^{zx}}{e^{z}-1}=\sum_{j=0}^{\infty} B_j(x) \frac{z^j}{j!},
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;B_j=B_j(0)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the Bernoulli number (with the convention &lt;math&gt;B_{1}=-\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;).
We obtain the Faulhaber formula by expanding the generating function as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
G(z,n) =&amp; \sum_{j=0}^{\infty} B_j \frac{(-z)^{j-1}}{j!}
\left(-\sum_{l=1}^{\infty} \frac{(nz)^{l}}{l!}\right)\\
=&amp; \sum_{p=0}^{\infty}z^p 
\sum_{j=0}^p (-1)^j \frac{1}{j!(p+1-j)!}B_j n^{p+1-j}\\
=&amp; \sum_{p=0}^{\infty}\frac{z^p}{p!}  {1 \over p+1} \sum_{j=0}^p (-1)^j{p+1 \choose j} B_j n^{p+1-j},\\
\mbox{i.e.}\quad \sum_{k=1}^nk^p=&amp;{1 \over p+1} \sum_{j=0}^p (-1)^j{p+1 \choose j} B_j n^{p+1-j}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Note that &lt;math&gt;B_j =0&lt;/math&gt; for all odd &lt;math&gt;j&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;. Hence some authors define &lt;math&gt;B_{1}=\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; so that the alternating factor &lt;math&gt;(-1)^j&lt;/math&gt; is absent.

==Alternate expressions==
By relabelling we find the alternative expression

: &lt;math&gt;
\sum_{k=1}^nk^p= \sum_{k=0}^p {(-1)^{p-k} \over k+1}{p \choose k} B_{p-k} n^{k+1}.
&lt;/math&gt;

We may also expand  &lt;math&gt;G(z,n)&lt;/math&gt; in terms of the Bernoulli polynomials to find
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
G(z,n) =&amp; \frac{e^{(n+1)z}}{e^{z}-1}-\frac{e^z}{e^{z}-1}\\
=&amp; \sum_{j=0}^{\infty} \left(B_j(n+1)-B_j(1)\right) \frac{z^{j-1}}{j!},
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
which implies
:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{k=1}^nk^p=\frac{1}{p+1}\left(B_{p+1}(n+1)-B_{p+1}(1)\right).
&lt;/math&gt;

==Relationship to Riemann zeta function==

Using &lt;math&gt;B_k=-k\zeta(1-k)&lt;/math&gt;, one can write
:&lt;math&gt;
\sum\limits_{k=1}^n k^p = \frac{n^{p+1}}{p+1} - \sum\limits_{j=0}^{p-1}{p \choose j}\zeta(-j)n^{p-j}.
&lt;/math&gt;

If we consider the generating function &lt;math&gt;G(z,n)&lt;/math&gt; in the large &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;  limit for &lt;math&gt;\Re (z)&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;, then we find
:&lt;math&gt;
\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}G(z,n) = \frac{1}{e^{-z}-1}=\sum_{j=0}^{\infty} (-1)^{j-1}B_j \frac{z^{j-1}}{j!}
&lt;/math&gt;
Heuristically, this suggests that 
:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} k^p=\frac{(-1)^{p} B_{p+1}}{p+1}.
&lt;/math&gt;
This result agrees with the value of the [[Riemann zeta function]] &lt;math&gt;\zeta(s)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^s}&lt;/math&gt; for negative integers &lt;math&gt;s=-p&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; on appropriately analytically continuing &lt;math&gt;\zeta(s)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Umbral form==

In the classical [[umbral calculus]] one formally treats the indices ''j'' in a sequence ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; as if they were exponents, so that, in this case we can apply the [[binomial theorem]] and say

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^n k^p = {1 \over p+1} \sum_{j=0}^p {p+1 \choose j} B_j n^{p+1-j}
= {1 \over p+1} \sum_{j=0}^p {p+1 \choose j} B^j n^{p+1-j} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!-- extra blank line for easier legibility --&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt;= {(B+n)^{p+1} - B^{p+1} \over p+1}. &lt;/math&gt;

In the ''modern'' umbral calculus, one considers the [[linear functional]] ''T'' on the [[vector space]] of polynomials in a variable ''b'' given by

:&lt;math&gt;T(b^j) = B_j.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Then one can say

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^n k^p = {1 \over p+1} \sum_{j=0}^p {p+1 \choose j} B_j n^{p+1-j}
= {1 \over p+1} \sum_{j=0}^p {p+1 \choose j} T(b^j) n^{p+1-j} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!-- extra blank line for easier legibility --&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt; = {1 \over p+1} T\left(\sum_{j=0}^p {p+1 \choose j} b^j n^{p+1-j} \right)
= T\left({(b+n)^{p+1} - b^{p+1} \over p+1}\right). &lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Teorema de desargues.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.05|An illustration of [[Desargues' theorem]], an important result in [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean]] and [[projective geometry]]]]

'''Geometry''' (from the {{lang-grc|γεωμετρία}}; ''[[wikt:γῆ|geo-]]'' "earth", ''[[wikt:μέτρον|-metron]]'' "measurement") is a branch of [[mathematics]] concerned with questions of shape, size, relative position of figures, and the properties of space. A mathematician who works in the field of geometry is called a [[geometer]].

Geometry arose independently in a number of early cultures as a practical way for dealing with [[length]]s, [[area]]s, and [[volume]]s. Geometry began to see elements of formal [[mathematical science]] emerging in the West as early as the 6th century BC.&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=Ionia and the Pythagoreans p. 43"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Ionia and the Pythagoreans" p. 43}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 3rd century BC, geometry was put into an [[axiomatic system|axiomatic form]] by [[Euclid]], whose treatment, [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']], set a standard for many centuries to follow.&lt;ref&gt;Martin J. Turner,Jonathan M. Blackledge,Patrick R. Andrews (1998). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=oLXgFdfKp78C&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Fractal geometry in digital imaging]''. [[Academic Press]]. p. 1. {{ISBN|0-12-703970-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geometry arose independently in India, with texts providing rules for geometric constructions appearing as early as the 3rd century BC.&lt;ref name="Staal 1999"/&gt; Islamic scientists preserved Greek ideas and expanded on them during the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Thabit|title=Al-Sabi Thabit ibn Qurra al-Harrani}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 17th century, geometry had been put on a solid analytic footing by mathematicians such as [[René Descartes]] and [[Pierre de Fermat]]. Since then, and into modern times, geometry has expanded into [[non-Euclidean geometry]] and [[topological manifold|manifolds]], describing spaces that lie beyond the normal range of human experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last= Lamb |first= Evelyn |date= 2015-11-08|title=By Solving the Mysteries of Shape-Shifting Spaces, Mathematician Wins $3-Million Prize |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/by-solving-the-mysteries-of-shape-shifting-spaces-mathematician-wins-3-million-prize/ |magazine=Scientific American |location= |publisher= |access-date=2016-08-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While geometry has evolved significantly throughout the years, there are some general concepts that are more or less fundamental to geometry. These include the concepts of points, lines, planes, surfaces, angles, and curves, as well as the more advanced notions of manifolds and topology or metric.&lt;ref name="Tabak 2014 xiv"&gt;{{cite book |last= Tabak|first= John|date= 2014|title= Geometry: the language of space and form|url= |location= |publisher= Infobase Publishing|page=xiv |isbn=978-0816049530}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geometry has applications to many fields, including art, architecture, physics, as well as to other branches of mathematics.

==Overview==

Contemporary geometry has many subfields:
* [[Euclidean geometry]] is geometry in its classical sense. The mandatory educational curriculum of the majority of nations includes the study of [[point (geometry)|points]], [[Line (geometry)|lines]], [[plane (mathematics)|planes]], [[angle]]s, [[triangle]]s, [[congruence (geometry)|congruence]], [[similarity (geometry)|similarity]], [[solid figure]]s, [[circle]]s, and [[analytic geometry]].&lt;ref name="Schmidt, W. 2002"&gt;Schmidt, W., Houang, R., &amp; Cogan, L. (2002). "A coherent curriculum". ''American Educator'', 26(2), 1–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Euclidean geometry also has applications in [[computer science]], [[crystallography]], and various branches of modern mathematics.
* [[Differential geometry]] uses techniques of [[calculus]] and [[linear algebra]] to study problems in geometry. It has applications in [[physics]], including in [[general relativity]].
* [[Topology]] is the field concerned with the properties of geometric objects that are unchanged by [[continuous mapping]]s. In practice, this often means dealing with large-scale properties of spaces, such as [[connectedness]] and [[compact (topology)|compactness]].
* [[Convex geometry]] investigates convex shapes in the Euclidean space and its more abstract analogues, often using techniques of [[real analysis]]. It has close connections to [[convex analysis]], [[optimization]] and [[functional analysis]] and important applications in [[number theory]].
* [[Algebraic geometry]] studies geometry through the use of [[multivariate polynomial]]s and other algebraic techniques. It has applications in many areas, including [[cryptography]] and [[string theory]].
* [[Discrete geometry]] is concerned mainly with questions of relative position of simple geometric objects, such as points, lines and circles. It shares many methods and principles with [[combinatorics]].
* [[Computational geometry]] deals with [[algorithm]]s and their [[implementation (computer science)|implementations]] for manipulating geometrical objects. Although being a young area of geometry, it has many applications in [[computer vision]], [[image processing]], [[computer-aided design]], [[medical imaging]], etc.

In the 7th century BC, the [[Greek mathematics|Greek]] mathematician [[Thales of Miletus]] used geometry to solve problems such as calculating the height of pyramids and the distance of ships from the shore.  He is credited with the first use of deductive reasoning applied to geometry, by deriving four corollaries to [[Thales' Theorem]].&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=Ionia and the Pythagoreans p. 43"/&gt;  Pythagoras established the [[Pythagoreans|Pythagorean School]], which is credited with the first proof of the [[Pythagorean theorem]],&lt;ref&gt;Eves, Howard, An Introduction to the History of Mathematics, Saunders, 1990, {{ISBN|0-03-029558-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  though the statement of the theorem has a long history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Discovery of Incommensurability by Hippasus of Metapontum|author=Kurt Von Fritz|journal=The Annals of Mathematics|year=1945|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Pentagram and the Discovery of an Irrational Number|journal=The Two-Year College Mathematics Journal|author=James R. Choike|year=1980|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]] (408–c.&amp;nbsp;355 BC) developed the [[method of exhaustion]], which allowed the calculation of areas and volumes of curvilinear figures,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Age of Plato and Aristotle" p. 92}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a theory of ratios that avoided the problem of [[incommensurable magnitudes]], which enabled subsequent geometers to make significant advances. Around 300 BC, geometry was revolutionized by Euclid, whose ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', widely considered the most successful and influential textbook of all time,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Euclid of Alexandria" p. 119}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced [[mathematical rigor]] through the [[axiomatic method]] and is the earliest example of the format still used in mathematics today, that of definition, axiom, theorem, and proof. Although most of the contents of the ''Elements'' were already known, Euclid arranged them into a single, coherent logical framework.&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=Euclid of Alexandria p. 104"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Euclid of Alexandria" p. 104}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Elements'' was known to all educated people in the West until the middle of the 20th century and its contents are still taught in geometry classes today.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Eves, ''An Introduction to the History of Mathematics'', Saunders, 1990, {{ISBN|0-03-029558-0}} p. 141: "No work, except [[The Bible]], has been more widely used...."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Archimedes]] (c.&amp;nbsp;287–212 BC) of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]] used the [[method of exhaustion]] to calculate the [[area]] under the arc of a [[parabola]] with the [[Series (mathematics)|summation of an infinite series]], and gave remarkably accurate approximations of [[Pi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = A history of calculus |author1=O'Connor, J.J.  |author2=Robertson, E.F. | publisher = [[University of St Andrews]]| url = http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/The_rise_of_calculus.html |date= February 1996|accessdate= 2007-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also studied the [[Archimedes spiral|spiral]] bearing his name and obtained formulas for the [[volume]]s of [[surface of revolution|surfaces of revolution]].

[[Indian mathematics|Indian]] mathematicians also made many important contributions in geometry. The ''[[Satapatha Brahmana]]'' (3rd century BC) contains rules for ritual geometric constructions that are similar to the ''[[Shulba Sutras|Sulba Sutras]]''.&lt;ref name="Staal 1999"&gt;{{Citation  | last=Staal  | first=Frits  | author-link=Frits Staal  | title=Greek and Vedic Geometry  | journal=Journal of Indian Philosophy  | volume=27  | issue=1–2  | year=1999  | pages=105–127  | doi=10.1023/A:1004364417713  }}
&lt;/ref&gt; According to {{Harv|Hayashi|2005|p=363}}, the ''Śulba Sūtras'' contain "the earliest extant verbal expression of the Pythagorean Theorem in the world, although it had already been known to the Old Babylonians. They contain lists of [[Pythagorean triples]],&lt;ref&gt;Pythagorean triples are triples of integers &lt;math&gt; (a,b,c) &lt;/math&gt; with the property: &lt;math&gt;a^2+b^2=c^2&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;3^2+4^2=5^2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;8^2+15^2=17^2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;12^2+35^2=37^2&lt;/math&gt; etc.&lt;/ref&gt; which are particular cases of [[Diophantine equations]].&lt;ref name=cooke198&gt;{{Harv|Cooke|2005|p=198}}: "The arithmetic content of the ''Śulva Sūtras'' consists of rules for finding Pythagorean triples such as (3, 4, 5), (5, 12, 13), (8, 15, 17), and (12, 35, 37). It is not certain what practical use these arithmetic rules had. The best conjecture is that they were part of religious ritual. A Hindu home was required to have three fires burning at three different altars. The three altars were to be of different shapes, but all three were to have the same area. These conditions led to certain "Diophantine" problems, a particular case of which is the generation of Pythagorean triples, so as to make one square integer equal to the sum of two others."&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[Bakhshali manuscript]], there is a handful of geometric problems (including problems about volumes of irregular solids). The Bakhshali manuscript also "employs a decimal place value system with a dot for zero."&lt;ref name="hayashi2005-371"&gt;{{Harv|Hayashi|2005|p=371}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aryabhata]]'s ''[[Aryabhatiya]]'' (499) includes the computation of areas and volumes.
[[Brahmagupta]] wrote his astronomical work ''[[Brahmasphutasiddhanta|{{IAST|Brāhma Sphuṭa Siddhānta}}]]'' in 628. Chapter 12, containing 66 [[Sanskrit]] verses, was divided into two sections: "basic operations" (including cube roots, fractions, ratio and proportion, and barter) and "practical mathematics" (including mixture, mathematical series, plane figures, stacking bricks, sawing of timber, and piling of grain).&lt;ref name="hayashi2003-p121-122"&gt;{{Harv|Hayashi|2003|pp=121–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter section, he stated his famous theorem on the diagonals of a [[cyclic quadrilateral]]. Chapter 12 also included a formula for the area of a cyclic quadrilateral (a generalization of [[Heron's formula]]), as well as a complete description of [[rational triangle]]s (''i.e.'' triangles with rational sides and rational areas).&lt;ref name="hayashi2003-p121-122"/&gt;

In the [[Middle Ages]], [[mathematics in medieval Islam]] contributed to the development of geometry, especially [[algebraic geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Rashed (1994), ''The development of Arabic mathematics: between arithmetic and algebra'', p. 35 [[London]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyer Omar Khayyam positive roots"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Boyer|authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer|title=A History of Mathematics|year=1991|chapter=The Arabic Hegemony|pages=241–242|quote=Omar Khayyam (c. 1050–1123), the "tent-maker," wrote an ''Algebra'' that went beyond that of al-Khwarizmi to include equations of third degree. Like his Arab predecessors, Omar Khayyam provided for quadratic equations both arithmetic and geometric solutions; for general cubic equations, he believed (mistakenly, as the 16th century later showed), arithmetic solutions were impossible; hence he gave only geometric solutions. The scheme of using intersecting conics to solve cubics had been used earlier by Menaechmus, Archimedes, and Alhazan, but Omar Khayyam took the praiseworthy step of generalizing the method to cover all third-degree equations (having positive roots). .. For equations of higher degree than three, Omar Khayyam evidently did not envision similar geometric methods, for space does not contain more than three dimensions, ... One of the most fruitful contributions of Arabic eclecticism was the tendency to close the gap between numerical and geometric algebra. The decisive step in this direction came much later with Descartes, but Omar Khayyam was moving in this direction when he wrote, "Whoever thinks algebra is a trick in obtaining unknowns has thought it in vain. No attention should be paid to the fact that algebra and geometry are different in appearance. Algebras are geometric facts which are proved."}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Mahani]] (b. 853) conceived the idea of reducing geometrical problems such as duplicating the cube to problems in algebra.&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Al-Mahani|title=Al-Mahani}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thābit ibn Qurra]] (known as Thebit in [[Latin]]) (836–901) dealt with [[arithmetic]] operations applied to [[ratio]]s of geometrical quantities, and contributed to the development of [[analytic geometry]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; [[Omar Khayyám]] (1048–1131) found geometric solutions to [[cubic equation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Khayyam|title=Omar Khayyam}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The theorems of [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen), Omar Khayyam and [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]] on [[quadrilateral]]s, including the [[Lambert quadrilateral]] and [[Saccheri quadrilateral]], were early results in [[hyperbolic geometry]], and along with their alternative postulates, such as [[Playfair's axiom]], these works had a considerable influence on the development of non-Euclidean geometry among later European geometers, including [[Witelo]] (c.&amp;nbsp;1230–c.&amp;nbsp;1314), [[Gersonides]] (1288–1344), [[Alfonso]], [[John Wallis]], and [[Giovanni Girolamo Saccheri]].&lt;ref&gt;Boris A. Rosenfeld and Adolf P. Youschkevitch (1996), "Geometry", in Roshdi Rashed, ed., ''[[Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science]]'', Vol. 2, pp. 447–494 [470], [[Routledge]], London and New York: {{quote|"Three scientists, Ibn al-Haytham, Khayyam, and al-Tusi, had made the most considerable contribution to this branch of geometry whose importance came to be completely recognized only in the 19th century. In essence, their propositions concerning the properties of quadrangles which they considered, assuming that some of the angles of these figures were acute of obtuse, embodied the first few theorems of the hyperbolic and the elliptic geometries. Their other proposals showed that various geometric statements were equivalent to the Euclidean postulate V. It is extremely important that these scholars established the mutual connection between this postulate and the sum of the angles of a triangle and a quadrangle. By their works on the theory of parallel lines Arab mathematicians directly influenced the relevant investigations of their European counterparts. The first European attempt to prove the postulate on parallel lines – made by Witelo, the Polish scientists of the 13th century, while revising Ibn al-Haytham's ''[[Book of Optics]]'' (''Kitab al-Manazir'') – was undoubtedly prompted by Arabic sources. The proofs put forward in the 14th century by the Jewish scholar Levi ben Gerson, who lived in southern France, and by the above-mentioned Alfonso from Spain directly border on Ibn al-Haytham's demonstration. Above, we have demonstrated that ''Pseudo-Tusi's Exposition of Euclid'' had stimulated both J. Wallis's and G. Saccheri's studies of the theory of parallel lines."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 17th century, there were two important developments in geometry. The first was the creation of analytic geometry, or geometry with [[Coordinate system|coordinates]] and [[equation]]s, by [[René Descartes]] (1596–1650) and [[Pierre de Fermat]] (1601–1665). This was a necessary precursor to the development of [[calculus]] and a precise quantitative science of [[physics]]. The second geometric development of this period was the systematic study of [[projective geometry]] by [[Girard Desargues]] (1591–1661). Projective geometry is a geometry without measurement or parallel lines, just the study of how points are related to each other.

Two developments in geometry in the 19th century changed the way it had been studied previously. These were the discovery of [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean geometries]] by Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky, János Bolyai and Carl Friedrich Gauss and of the formulation of [[symmetry]] as the central consideration in the [[Erlangen Programme]] of [[Felix Klein]] (which generalized the Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometries). Two of the master geometers of the time were [[Bernhard Riemann]] (1826–1866), working primarily with tools from [[mathematical analysis]], and introducing the [[Riemann surface]], and [[Henri Poincaré]], the founder of [[algebraic topology]] and the geometric theory of [[dynamical system]]s. As a consequence of these major changes in the conception of geometry, the concept of "space" became something rich and varied, and the natural background for theories as different as [[complex analysis]] and [[classical mechanics]].

==Important concepts in geometry==

The following are some of the most important concepts in geometry.&lt;ref name="Tabak 2014 xiv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schmidt, W. 2002"/&gt;

===Axioms===
[[File:Parallel postulate en.svg|thumb|right|An illustration of Euclid's [[parallel postulate]]]]
{{See also|Euclidean geometry}}
[[Euclid]] took an abstract approach to geometry in his [[Euclid's Elements|Elements]], one of the most influential books ever written. Euclid introduced certain [[axiom]]s, or [[postulate]]s, expressing primary or self-evident properties of points, lines, and planes. He proceeded to rigorously deduce other properties by mathematical reasoning. The characteristic feature of Euclid's approach to geometry was its rigor, and it has come to be known as ''axiomatic'' or ''[[synthetic geometry|synthetic]]'' geometry. At the start of the 19th century, the discovery of [[non-Euclidean geometries]] by [[Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky]] (1792–1856), [[János Bolyai]] (1802–1860), [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] (1777–1855) and others led to a revival of interest in this discipline, and in the 20th century, [[David Hilbert]] (1862–1943) employed axiomatic reasoning in an attempt to provide a modern foundation of geometry.

===Points===
{{Main|Point (geometry)}}

Points are considered fundamental objects in Euclidean geometry. They have been defined in a variety of ways, including Euclid's definition as 'that which has no part'&lt;ref name=EuclidAll&gt;''Euclid's Elements – All thirteen books in one volume'', Based on Heath's translation, Green Lion Press {{ISBN|1-888009-18-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and through the use of algebra or nested sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Clark|first=Bowman L. |last2= |first2= |date= Jan 1985|title= Individuals and Points|url= http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ndjfl/1093870761|journal= Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic|volume= 26|issue=1 |pages= 61–75|doi= 10.1305/ndjfl/1093870761|access-date=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many areas of geometry, such as analytic geometry, differential geometry, and topology, all objects are considered to be built up from points. However, there has been some study of geometry without reference to points.&lt;ref&gt;Gerla, G., 1995, "[http://www.dmi.unisa.it/people/gerla/www/Down/point-free.pdf Pointless Geometries]" in Buekenhout, F., Kantor, W. eds., ''Handbook of incidence geometry: buildings and foundations''. North-Holland: 1015–1031.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lines===
{{main|Line (geometry)}}

[[Euclid]] described a line as "breadthless length" which "lies equally with respect to the points on itself".&lt;ref name=EuclidAll /&gt; In modern mathematics, given the multitude of geometries, the concept of a line is closely tied to the way the geometry is described. For instance, in [[analytic geometry]], a line in the plane is often defined as the set of points whose coordinates satisfy a given [[linear equation]],&lt;ref&gt;[[John Casey (mathematician)|John Casey]] (1885) [https://archive.org/details/cu31924001520455 Analytic Geometry of the Point, Line, Circle, and Conic Sections], link from [[Internet Archive]].&lt;/ref&gt; but in a more abstract setting, such as [[incidence geometry]], a line may be an independent object, distinct from the set of points which lie on it.&lt;ref&gt;Buekenhout, Francis (1995), ''Handbook of Incidence Geometry: Buildings and Foundations'', Elsevier B.V.&lt;/ref&gt; In differential geometry, a  [[geodesic]] is a generalization of the notion of a line  to [[manifold|curved spaces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/geodesic |title=geodesic – definition of geodesic in English from the Oxford dictionary |publisher=[[OxfordDictionaries.com]] |access-date=2016-01-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Planes===
{{main|Plane (geometry)}}

A [[plane (geometry)|plane]] is a flat, two-dimensional surface that extends infinitely far.&lt;ref name= EuclidAll /&gt; Planes are used in every area of geometry. For instance, planes can be studied as a [[surface (topology)|topological surface]] without reference to distances or angles;&lt;ref name=Munkres&gt;Munkres, James R. Topology. Vol. 2. Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; it can be studied as an [[affine space]], where collinearity and ratios can be studied but not distances;&lt;ref&gt;Szmielew, Wanda. 'From affine to Euclidean geometry: An axiomatic approach.' Springer, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; it can be studied as the [[complex plane]] using techniques of [[complex analysis]];&lt;ref&gt;Ahlfors, Lars V. ''Complex analysis: an introduction to the theory of analytic functions of one complex variable.'' New York, London (1953).&lt;/ref&gt; and so on.

===Angles===
{{main|Angle}}

[[Euclid]] defines a plane [[angle]] as the inclination to each other, in a plane, of two lines which meet each other, and do not lie straight with respect to each other.&lt;ref name= EuclidAll /&gt; In modern terms, an angle is the figure formed by two [[Ray (geometry)|rays]], called the ''sides'' of the angle, sharing a common endpoint, called the ''[[vertex (geometry)|vertex]]'' of the angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{SpringerEOM|id=Angle&amp;oldid=13323|title=Angle|year=2001|last=Sidorov|first=L.A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Angle obtuse acute straight.svg|thumb|Acute (a), obtuse (b), and straight (c) angles. The acute and obtuse angles are also known as oblique angles.]]

In [[Euclidean geometry]], angles are used to study [[polygon]]s and [[triangle]]s, as well as forming an object of study in their own right.&lt;ref name= EuclidAll /&gt; The study of the angles of a triangle or of angles in a [[unit circle]] forms the basis of [[trigonometry]].&lt;ref&gt;Gelʹfand, Izrailʹ Moiseevič, and Mark Saul. "Trigonometry." 'Trigonometry'. Birkhäuser Boston, 2001. 1–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[differential geometry]] and [[calculus]], the angles between [[plane curve]]s or [[space curve]]s or [[surface (geometry)|surfaces]] can be calculated using the [[derivative (calculus)|derivative]].&lt;ref name=Stewart&gt;[[James Stewart (mathematician)|Stewart, James]] (2012). ''Calculus: Early Transcendentals'', 7th ed., Brooks Cole Cengage Learning. {{ISBN|978-0-538-49790-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Jost |first=Jürgen |title=Riemannian Geometry and Geometric Analysis |year=2002 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |publication-place=Berlin |isbn=978-3-540-42627-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Curves===
{{main|Curve (geometry)}}

A [[curve (geometry)|curve]] is a 1-dimensional object that may be straight (like a line) or not; curves in 2-dimensional space are called [[plane curve]]s and those in 3-dimensional space are called [[space curve]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Henry Frederick. Principles of geometry. Vol. 2. CUP Archive, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;

In topology, a curve is defined by a function from an interval of the real numbers to another space.&lt;ref name = Munkres /&gt; In differential geometry, the same definition is used, but the defining function is required to be differentiable &lt;ref name = Carmo /&gt; Algebraic geometry studies [[algebraic curve]]s, which are defined as [[algebraic varieties]] of [[dimension of an algebraic variety|dimension]] one.&lt;ref name = mumford /&gt;

===Surfaces===
{{main| Surface (mathematics)}}
[[File:Sphere wireframe.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|A sphere is a surface that can be defined parametrically (by ''x'' = ''r'' sin ''θ'' cos ''φ'',
''y'' = ''r'' sin ''θ'' sin ''φ'', ''z'' = ''r'' cos ''θ'') or implicitly (by {{nowrap|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 0}}.)]]

"Early Transcendentals." {{ISBN|978-0321570567}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[differential geometry]]&lt;ref name=Carmo&gt;Do Carmo, Manfredo Perdigao, and Manfredo Perdigao Do Carmo. Differential geometry of curves and surfaces. Vol. 2. Englewood Cliffs: Prentice-hall, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[topology]],&lt;ref name=Munkres /&gt; surfaces are described by two-dimensional 'patches' (or [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhoods]]) that are assembled by [[diffeomorphism]]s or [[homeomorphism]]s, respectively. In algebraic geometry, surfaces are described by [[polynomial equation]]s.&lt;ref name=mumford&gt;{{cite book |last=Mumford |first=David |authorlink=David Mumford |title=The Red Book of Varieties and Schemes Includes the Michigan Lectures on Curves and Their Jacobians |edition=2nd |year=1999 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer-Verlag]] |isbn=978-3-540-63293-1 |zbl=0945.14001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manifolds===
{{main | Manifold}}

A [[manifold]] is a generalization of the concepts of curve and surface. In [[topology]], a manifold is a [[topological space]] where every point has a [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]] that is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to Euclidean space.&lt;ref name = Munkres /&gt; In [[differential geometry]], a [[differentiable manifold]] is a space where each neighborhood is [[diffeomorphism|diffeomorphic]] to Euclidean space.&lt;ref name=Carmo/&gt;

Manifolds are used extensively in physics, including in [[general relativity]] and [[string theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Yau, Shing-Tung; Nadis, Steve (2010). The Shape of Inner Space: String Theory and the Geometry of the Universe's Hidden Dimensions. Basic Books. {{ISBN|978-0-465-02023-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Topologies and metrics===
{{main|Topology}}
[[File:Chinese pythagoras.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|Visual checking of the [[Pythagorean theorem]] for the (3, 4, 5) [[triangle]] as in the [[Zhoubi Suanjing]] 500–200&amp;nbsp;BC. The Pythagorean theorem is a consequence of the [[Euclidean metric]].]]

A [[topology]] is a mathematical structure on a set that tells how elements of the set relate spatially to each other.&lt;ref name = Munkres /&gt; The best-known examples of topologies come from [[metric space|metrics]], which are ways of measuring distances between points.&lt;ref&gt;Dmitri Burago, [[Yuri Dmitrievich Burago|Yu D Burago]], Sergei Ivanov, ''A Course in Metric Geometry'', American Mathematical Society, 2001, {{ISBN|0-8218-2129-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the [[Euclidean metric]] measures the distance between points in the [[Euclidean plane]], while the [[hyperbolic metric]] measures the distance in the [[hyperbolic plane]]. Other important examples of metrics include the [[Lorentz metric]] of [[special relativity]] and the semi-[[Riemannian metric]]s of [[general relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Wald|first=Robert M.|authorlink=Robert Wald|title=General Relativity|publisher=University of Chicago Press|date=1984|isbn=978-0-226-87033-5|title-link=General Relativity (book)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compass and straightedge constructions===
{{Main|Compass and straightedge constructions}}

Classical geometers paid special attention to constructing geometric objects that had been described in some other way. Classically, the only instruments allowed in geometric constructions are the [[Compass (drafting)|compass]] and [[ruler|straightedge]]. Also, every construction had to be complete in a finite number of steps. However, some problems turned out to be difficult or impossible to solve by these means alone, and ingenious constructions using parabolas and other curves, as well as mechanical devices, were found.

===Dimension===
{{main|Dimension}}

[[File:Von Koch curve.gif|thumb| The [[Koch snowflake]], with [[fractal dimension]]=log4/log3 and [[topological dimension]]=1]]
Where the traditional geometry allowed dimensions 1 (a [[line (geometry)|line]]), 2 (a [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]]) and 3 (our ambient world conceived of as [[three-dimensional space]]), mathematicians have used [[higher dimension]]s for nearly two centuries. The concept of dimension has gone through stages of being any [[natural number]] ''n'', to being possibly infinite with the introduction of [[Hilbert space]], to being any positive real number in [[fractal geometry]]. [[Dimension theory]] is a technical area, initially within [[general topology]], that discusses ''definitions''; in common with most mathematical ideas, dimension is now defined rather than an intuition. Connected [[topological manifold]]s have a well-defined dimension; this is a theorem ([[invariance of domain]]) rather than anything ''a priori''.

The issue of dimension still matters to geometry as many classic questions still lack complete answers. For instance, many open problems in topology depend on the dimension of an object for the result. In physics, dimensions 3 of space and 4 of [[space-time]] are special cases in [[geometric topology]], and dimensions 10 and 11 are key ideas in [[string theory]]. Currently, the existence of the theoretical dimensions is purely defined by technical reasons; it is likely that further research may result in a ''geometric'' reason for the significance of 10 or 11 dimensions in the theory, lending credibility or possibly disproving string theory.

===Symmetry===
{{main |Symmetry}}

[[File:Order-3 heptakis heptagonal tiling.png|right|thumb|A [[Order-3 bisected heptagonal tiling|tiling]] of the [[Hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane]]]]
The theme of [[symmetry]] in geometry is nearly as old as the science of geometry itself. Symmetric shapes such as the [[circle]], [[regular polygon]]s and [[platonic solid]]s held deep significance for many ancient philosophers and were investigated in detail before the time of Euclid. Symmetric patterns occur in nature and were artistically rendered in a multitude of forms, including the graphics of [[M.C. Escher]]. Nonetheless, it was not until the second half of 19th century that the unifying role of symmetry in foundations of geometry was recognized. [[Felix Klein]]'s [[Erlangen program]] proclaimed that, in a very precise sense, symmetry, expressed via the notion of a transformation [[group (mathematics)|group]], determines what geometry ''is''. Symmetry in classical [[Euclidean geometry]] is represented by [[Congruence (geometry)|congruences]] and rigid motions, whereas in [[projective geometry]] an analogous role is played by [[collineation]]s, [[geometric transformation]]s that take straight lines into straight lines. However it was in the new geometries of Bolyai and Lobachevsky, Riemann, [[William Kingdon Clifford|Clifford]] and Klein, and [[Sophus Lie]] that Klein's idea to 'define a geometry via its [[symmetry group]]' proved most influential. Both discrete and continuous symmetries play prominent roles in geometry, the former in [[topology]] and [[geometric group theory]], the latter in [[Lie theory]] and [[Riemannian geometry]].

A different type of symmetry is the principle of duality in [[projective geometry]] (see [[Duality (projective geometry)]]) among other fields. This meta-phenomenon can roughly be described as follows: in any [[theorem]], exchange ''point'' with ''plane'', ''join'' with ''meet'', ''lies in'' with ''contains'', and you will get an equally true theorem. A similar and closely related form of duality exists between a [[vector space]] and its dual space.

===Non-Euclidean geometry===
[[File:Hyperbolic triangle.svg|thumb|right|[[Differential geometry]] uses tools from [[calculus]] to study problems involving curvature.]]
In the nearly two thousand years since Euclid, while the range of geometrical questions asked and answered inevitably expanded, the basic understanding of [[space]] remained essentially the same. [[Immanuel Kant]] argued that there is only one, ''absolute'', geometry, which is known to be true ''a priori'' by an inner faculty of mind: Euclidean geometry was [[synthetic a priori]].&lt;ref&gt;Kline (1972) "Mathematical thought from ancient to modern times", Oxford University Press, p. 1032.  Kant did not reject the logical (analytic a priori) ''possibility'' of non-Euclidean geometry, see [[Jeremy Gray]], "Ideas of Space Euclidean, Non-Euclidean, and Relativistic", Oxford, 1989; p. 85.  Some have implied that, in light of this, Kant had in fact ''predicted'' the development of non-Euclidean geometry, cf. Leonard Nelson, "Philosophy and Axiomatics," Socratic Method and Critical Philosophy, Dover, 1965, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;  This dominant view was overturned by the revolutionary discovery of [[non-Euclidean geometry]] in the works of Bolyai, Lobachevsky, and Gauss (who never published his theory). They demonstrated that ordinary [[Euclidean space]] is only one possibility for development of geometry. A broad vision of the subject of geometry was then expressed  by [[Riemann]] in his 1867 inauguration lecture ''Über die Hypothesen, welche der Geometrie zu Grunde liegen'' (''On the hypotheses on which geometry is based''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Riemann/Geom/ |title=Ueber die Hypothesen, welche der Geometrie zu Grunde liegen |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318034045/http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Riemann/Geom/ |archivedate=18 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; published only after his death. Riemann's new idea of space proved crucial in [[Einstein]]'s [[general relativity theory]], and [[Riemannian geometry]], that considers very general spaces in which the notion of length is defined, is a mainstay of modern geometry.

==Contemporary geometry==

===Euclidean geometry===
[[File:Geometry Lessons.jpg|thumb|Geometry lessons in the 20th century]]

[[Euclidean geometry]] has become closely connected with [[computational geometry]], [[computer graphics]], [[convex geometry]], [[incidence geometry]], [[finite geometry]], [[discrete geometry]], and some areas of [[combinatorics]]. Attention was given to further work on Euclidean geometry and the Euclidean groups by [[crystallography]] and the work of [[H. S. M. Coxeter]], and can be seen in theories of [[Coxeter group]]s and polytopes. [[Geometric group theory]] is an expanding area of the theory of more general [[discrete group]]s, drawing on geometric models and algebraic techniques.

===Differential geometry===
[[Differential geometry]] has been of increasing importance to [[mathematical physics]] due to [[Einstein]]'s [[general relativity]] postulation that the [[universe]] is [[curvature|curved]]. Contemporary differential geometry is ''intrinsic'', meaning that the spaces it considers are [[smooth manifold]]s whose geometric structure is governed by a [[Riemannian metric]], which determines how distances are measured near each point, and not ''a priori'' parts of some ambient flat Euclidean space.

===Topology and geometry===
[[File:Trefoil knot arb.png|thumb|right|upright=0.55|A thickening of the [[trefoil knot]]]]
The field of [[topology]], which saw massive development in the 20th century, is in a technical sense a type of [[transformation geometry]], in which transformations are [[homeomorphism]]s. This has often been expressed in the form of the dictum 'topology is rubber-sheet geometry'. Contemporary [[geometric topology]] and [[differential topology]], and particular subfields such as [[Morse theory]], would be counted by most mathematicians as part of geometry. [[Algebraic topology]] and [[general topology]] have gone their own ways.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} {{dubious|reason=This is an opinion, as far as I know, these two fields are generally considered as parts of geometry|date=April 2016}}

===Algebraic geometry===
[[File:Calabi yau.jpg|thumb|upright=0.55|Quintic [[Calabi–Yau manifold|Calabi–Yau threefold]]]]
The field of [[algebraic geometry]] is the modern incarnation of the [[Cartesian geometry]] of [[co-ordinates]]. From late 1950s through mid-1970s it had undergone major foundational development, largely due to work of [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] and [[Alexander Grothendieck]]. This led to the introduction of [[scheme (algebraic geometry)|schemes]] and greater emphasis on [[algebraic topology|topological]] methods, including various [[cohomology theory|cohomology theories]]. One of seven [[Millennium Prize problems]], the [[Hodge conjecture]], is a question in algebraic geometry.

The study of low-dimensional algebraic varieties, [[algebraic curve]]s, [[algebraic surface]]s and algebraic varieties of dimension 3 ("algebraic threefolds"), has been far advanced. [[Gröbner basis]] theory and [[real algebraic geometry]] are among more applied subfields of modern algebraic geometry. [[Arithmetic geometry]] is an active field combining algebraic geometry and [[number theory]]. Other directions of research involve [[moduli space]]s and [[complex geometry]]. Algebro-geometric methods are commonly applied in [[string theory|string]] and [[brane theory|brane]] &lt;!--This comment might stop AWB messing up the formatting here--&gt; theory.

==Applications==
Geometry has found applications in many fields, some of which are described below.

===Art===
{{main |Mathematics and art}}

Mathematics and art are related in a variety of ways. For instance, the theory of [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] showed that there is more to geometry than just the metric properties of figures: perspective is the origin of [[projective geometry]].

===Architecture===
{{main|Mathematics and architecture|Architectural geometry}}

Mathematics and [[architecture]] are related, since, as with other arts, architects use mathematics for several reasons. Apart from the mathematics needed when engineering buildings, architects use geometry: to define the spatial form of a building; from the Pythagoreans of the sixth century BC onwards, to create forms considered harmonious, and thus to lay out buildings and their surroundings according to mathematical, aesthetic and sometimes religious principles; to decorate buildings with mathematical objects such as tessellations; and to meet environmental goals, such as to minimise wind speeds around the bases of tall buildings.

===Physics===
{{main|Mathematical physics}}
[[File:E8Petrie.svg|right|thumb|upright=0.55|The [[4 21 polytope|4&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;polytope]], orthogonally projected into the [[E8 (mathematics)|E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]] [[Lie group]] [[Coxeter plane]]. Lie groups have several applications in physics.]]

The field of [[astronomy]], especially as it relates to mapping the positions of [[star]]s and [[planet]]s on the [[celestial sphere]] and describing the relationship between movements of celestial bodies, have served as an important source of geometric problems throughout history.

Modern geometry has many ties to [[physics]] as is exemplified by the links between [[pseudo-Riemannian]] geometry and [[general relativity]]. One of the youngest physical theories, [[string theory]], is also very geometric in flavour.

===Other fields of mathematics===

Geometry has also had a large effect on other areas of mathematics. For instance, the introduction of [[coordinates]] by [[René Descartes]] and the concurrent developments of [[algebra]] marked a new stage for geometry, since geometric figures such as [[plane curve]]s could now be represented [[analytic geometry|analytically]] in the form of functions and equations. This played a key role in the emergence of [[infinitesimal calculus]] in the 17th century.  The subject of geometry was further enriched by the study of the intrinsic structure of geometric objects that originated with [[Euler]] and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] and led to the creation of [[topology]] and [[differential geometry]].

[[File:Square root of 2 triangle.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The Pythagoreans discovered that the sides of a  triangle could have [[Commensurability (mathematics)|incommensurable]] lengths.]]
An important area of application is [[number theory]]. In [[ancient Greece]] the [[Pythagoreans]] considered the role of numbers in geometry. However, the discovery of incommensurable lengths, which contradicted their philosophical views, made them abandon abstract numbers in favor of concrete geometric quantities, such as length and area of figures. Since the 19th century, geometry has been used for solving problems in number theory, for example through the [[geometry of numbers]] or, more recently, [[scheme theory]], which is used in [[Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem]].

While the visual nature of geometry makes it initially more accessible than other mathematical areas such as algebra or [[number theory]], geometric language is also used in contexts far removed from its traditional, Euclidean provenance (for example, in [[fractal geometry]] and [[algebraic geometry]]).&lt;ref&gt;It is quite common in algebraic geometry to speak about ''geometry of [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]] over [[finite field]]s'', possibly [[singularity theory|singular]]. From a naïve perspective, these objects are just finite sets of points, but by invoking powerful geometric imagery and using well developed geometric techniques, it is possible to find structure and establish properties that make them somewhat analogous to the ordinary [[sphere]]s or [[Cone (geometry)|cones]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Analytic geometry]] applies methods of algebra to geometric questions, typically by relating geometric [[curve]]s to algebraic [[equation]]s. These ideas played a key role in the development of [[calculus]] in the 17th century and led to the discovery of many new properties of plane curves. Modern [[algebraic geometry]] considers similar questions on a vastly more abstract level.

[[Leonhard Euler]], in studying problems like the [[Seven Bridges of Königsberg]], considered the most fundamental properties of geometric figures based solely on shape, independent of their metric properties. Euler called this new branch of geometry ''geometria situs'' (geometry of place), but it is now known as [[topology]]. Topology grew out of geometry, but turned into a large independent discipline. It does not differentiate between objects that can be continuously deformed into each other. The objects may nevertheless retain some geometry, as in the case of [[hyperbolic knot]]s.

Heckman received the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Economics Nobel Prize]] in 2000 for this achievement.

== Method ==
Statistical analyses based on non-randomly selected samples can lead to erroneous conclusions. The Heckman correction, a two-step statistical approach, offers a means of correcting for non-randomly selected samples.

Heckman discussed bias from using nonrandom selected samples to estimate behavioral relationships as a specification error. He suggests a two-stage estimation method to correct the bias. The correction uses a [[control function (econometrics)|control function]] idea and is easy to implement. Heckman’s correction involves a [[normal distribution|normality]] assumption, provides a test for sample selection bias and formula for bias corrected model.

Suppose that a researcher wants to estimate the determinants of wage offers, but has access to wage observations for only those who work.  Since people who work are selected non-randomly from the population, estimating the determinants of wages from the subpopulation who work may introduce bias.  The Heckman correction takes place in two stages.

In the first stage, the researcher formulates a model, based on [[economic theory]], for the probability of working.  The canonical specification for this relationship is a [[probit]] regression of the form

: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Prob}( D = 1 | Z ) = \Phi(Z\gamma),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''D'' indicates employment (''D''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 if the respondent is employed and ''D''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 otherwise), ''Z'' is a vector of explanatory variables, &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a vector of unknown parameters, and Φ is the [[cumulative distribution function]] of the standard [[normal distribution]].  Estimation of the model yields results that can be used to predict this employment probability for each individual.

In the second stage, the researcher corrects for self-selection by incorporating a transformation of these predicted individual probabilities as an additional explanatory variable.  The wage equation may be specified,

: &lt;math&gt; w^* = X\beta + u&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;w^*&lt;/math&gt; denotes an underlying wage offer, which is not observed if the respondent does not work.  The conditional expectation of wages given the person works is then

: &lt;math&gt; E [ w | X, D=1 ] = X\beta + E [ u | X, D=1 ].&lt;/math&gt;

Under the assumption that the [[errors and residuals in statistics|error terms]] are [[multivariate normal distribution|jointly normal]], we have

: &lt;math&gt; E [ w | X, D=1 ] = X\beta + \rho\sigma_u \lambda(Z\gamma),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ρ'' is the correlation between unobserved determinants of propensity to work &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; and unobserved determinants of wage offers ''u'', ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''u''&lt;/sub&gt; is the standard deviation of &lt;math&gt; u &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the [[inverse Mills ratio]] evaluated at &lt;math&gt; Z\gamma &lt;/math&gt;. This equation demonstrates Heckman's insight that sample selection can be viewed as a form of [[omitted-variables bias]], as conditional on both ''X'' and on &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; it is as if the sample is randomly selected.  The wage equation can be estimated by replacing &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; with Probit estimates from the first stage, constructing the &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; term, and including it as an additional explanatory variable in [[Ordinary least squares|linear regression]] estimation of the wage equation.  Since &lt;math&gt;\sigma_u &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, the coefficient on &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; can only be zero if &lt;math&gt;\rho=0&lt;/math&gt;, so testing the null that the coefficient on &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is zero is equivalent to testing for sample selectivity.

Heckman's achievements have generated a large number of empirical applications in economics as well as in other social sciences. The original method has subsequently been generalized, by Heckman and by others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lee |first=Lung-Fei |year=2001 |chapter=Self-selection |editor-first=B. |editor1-last=Baltagi |title=A Companion to Theoretical Econometrics |location=Oxford |publisher=Blackwell |isbn= |doi=10.1002/9780470996249.ch19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disadvantages ==
* The two-step estimator discussed above is a limited information maximum likelihood (LIML) estimator.  In asymptotic theory and in finite samples as demonstrated by Monte Carlo simulations, the full information (FIML) estimator exhibits better statistical properties.  However, the FIML estimator is more computationally difficult to implement.&lt;ref name=puhani&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/1467-6419.00104 | last1 = Puhani | first1 = P. | year = 2000 | title = The Heckman Correction for sample selection and its critique | url = | journal = Journal of Economic Surveys | volume = 14 | issue = 1| pages = 53–68 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The covariance matrix generated by OLS estimation of the second stage is inconsistent. Correct standard errors and other statistics can be generated from an asymptotic approximation or by resampling, such as through a [[bootstrap (statistics)|bootstrap]].
* The canonical model assumes the errors are jointly normal.  If that assumption fails, the estimator is generally inconsistent and can provide misleading inference in small samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goldberger |first=A. |authorlink=Arthur Goldberger |year=1983 |chapter=Abnormal Selection Bias |pages=67–84 |editor-last=Karlin |editor-first=Samuel |editor1-link=Samuel Karlin |editor2-first=Takeshi |editor2-last=Amemiya |editor2-link=Takeshi Amemiya |editor3-link=Leo Goodman |editor3-first=Leo |editor3-last=Goodman |title=Studies in Econometrics, Time Series, and Multivariate Statistics |location=New York |publisher=Academic Press |edition= |isbn=0-12-398750-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Semiparametric and other robust alternatives can be used in such cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Newey | first1 = Whitney | last2 = Powell | first2 = J. | last3 = Walker | first3 = James R. | year = 1990 | title = Semiparametric Estimation of Selection Models: Some Empirical Results | journal = [[American Economic Review]] | volume = 80 | issue = 2| pages = 324–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The model obtains formal identification from the normality assumption when the same covariates appear in the selection equation and the equation of interest, but identification will be tenuous unless there are many observations in the tails where there is substantial nonlinearity in the inverse Mills ratio.  Generally, an exclusion restriction is required to generate credible estimates: there must be at least one variable which appears with a non-zero coefficient in the selection equation but does not appear in the equation of interest, essentially an [[instrumental variable|instrument]].  If no such variable is available, it may be difficult to correct for sampling selectivity.&lt;ref name=puhani/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4256">In [[mathematics]], '''Helly's selection theorem''' states that a [[sequence]] of functions that is locally of [[Bounded variation|bounded total variation]] and [[uniformly bounded]] at a point has a [[Convergent sequence|convergent]] [[subsequence]]. In other words, it is a [[compactness theorem]] for the space BV&lt;sub&gt;loc&lt;/sub&gt;. It is named for the [[Austria]]n [[mathematician]] [[Eduard Helly]].

The theorem has applications throughout [[mathematical analysis]]. In [[probability theory]], the result implies compactness of a [[tightness of measures|tight family of measures]].

==Statement of the theorem==

Let ''U'' be an [[open subset]] of the [[real line]] and let ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''U''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R''', ''n''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''N''', be a sequence of functions. Suppose that
* (''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) has uniformly [[Bounded variation|bounded]] [[total variation]] on any ''W'' that is [[compactly embedded]] in ''U''. That is, for all sets ''W''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''U'' with [[compact space|compact]] [[closure (topology)|closure]] ''W̄''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''U'',
::&lt;math&gt;\sup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \left( \left\| f_{n} \right\|_{L^{1} (W)} + \left\| \frac{\mathrm{d} f_{n}}{\mathrm{d} t} \right\|_{L^{1} (W)} \right) &lt; + \infty,&lt;/math&gt;
:where the derivative is taken in the sense of [[Distribution (mathematics)|tempered distributions]];
* and (''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is uniformly bounded at a point. That is, for some ''t''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''U'', {&amp;nbsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''N'''&amp;nbsp;}&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;'''R''' is a [[bounded set]].

Then there exists a [[subsequence]] ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;, ''k''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''N''', of ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and a function ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''U''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R''', locally of [[bounded variation]], such that
* ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; converges to ''f'' pointwise;
* and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; converges to ''f'' locally in ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; (see [[locally integrable function]]), i.e., for all ''W'' compactly embedded in ''U'',
::&lt;math&gt;\lim_{k \to \infty} \int_{W} \big| f_{n_{k}} (x) - f(x) \big| \, \mathrm{d} x = 0;&lt;/math&gt;
* and, for ''W'' compactly embedded in ''U'',
::&lt;math&gt;\left\| \frac{\mathrm{d} f}{\mathrm{d} t} \right\|_{L^{1} (W)} \leq \liminf_{k \to \infty} \left\| \frac{\mathrm{d} f_{n_{k}}}{\mathrm{d} t} \right\|_{L^{1} (W)}. &lt;/math&gt;

==Generalizations==
There are many generalizations and refinements of Helly's theorem.  The following theorem, for BV functions taking values in [[Banach space]]s, is due to Barbu and Precupanu:

Let ''X'' be a [[reflexive space|reflexive]], [[separable space|separable]] Hilbert space and let ''E'' be a closed, [[convex set|convex]] subset of ''X''.  Let Δ&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;+∞) be [[positive-definite]] and [[homogeneous function|homogeneous of degree one]].  Suppose that ''z''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is a uniformly bounded sequence in BV([0,&amp;nbsp;''T''];&amp;nbsp;''X'') with ''z''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''E'' for all ''n''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''N''' and ''t''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;''T''].  Then there exists a subsequence ''z''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; and functions ''δ'',&amp;nbsp;''z''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;BV([0,&amp;nbsp;''T''];&amp;nbsp;''X'') such that
* for all ''t''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;''T''],
::&lt;math&gt;\int_{[0, t)} \Delta (\mathrm{d} z_{n_{k}}) \to \delta(t);&lt;/math&gt;
* and, for all ''t''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;''T''],
::&lt;math&gt;z_{n_{k}} (t) \rightharpoonup z(t) \in E;&lt;/math&gt;
* and, for all 0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''s''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''t''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''T'',
::&lt;math&gt;\int_{[s, t)} \Delta(\mathrm{d} z) \leq \delta(t) - \delta(s).&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2816">In mathematical [[set theory]], an '''ω-Jónsson function''' for a set ''x'' of [[Ordinal number|ordinals]] is a function &lt;math&gt;f:[x]^\omega\to x&lt;/math&gt; with the property that, for any subset ''y'' of ''x'' with the same [[cardinality]] as ''x'', the restriction of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;[y]^\omega&lt;/math&gt; is [[Surjective function|surjective]] on &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. Here &lt;math&gt;[x]^\omega&lt;/math&gt; denotes the set of strictly increasing sequences of members of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, or equivalently the family of subsets of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; with [[order type]] &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;, using a standard notation for the family of subsets with a given order type. Jónsson functions are named for [[Bjarni Jónsson]].

{{harvs|txt|last=Erdős|last2=Hajnal|year=1966}} showed that for every ordinal λ there is an ω-Jónsson function for λ.

Kunen's proof of [[Kunen's inconsistency theorem]] uses a Jónsson function for [[cardinal number|cardinals]] λ such that 2&lt;sup&gt;λ&lt;/sup&gt; = λ&lt;sup&gt;ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and Kunen observed that for this special case there is a simpler proof of the existence of Jónsson functions. {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Fred Galvin|last=Galvin|last2= Prikry|year=1976}} gave a simple proof for the general case. 

The existence of Jónsson functions shows that for any cardinal there is an algebra with an infinitary operation that has no proper subalgebras of the same cardinality. In particular if infinitary operations are allowed then an analogue of [[Jónsson algebra]]s exists in any cardinality, so there are no infinitary analogues of [[Jónsson cardinal]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4553">In mathematics, '''Laguerre transform''' is an [[integral transform]] named after the mathematician [[Edmond Laguerre]], which uses generalized [[Laguerre polynomials]] &lt;math&gt;L_n^\alpha(x)&lt;/math&gt; as kernels of the transform.&lt;ref&gt;Debnath, Lokenath, and Dambaru Bhatta.

The Laguerre transform of a function &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;L\{g(x)\} = \tilde f_\alpha(n) = \int_{0}^\infty e^{-x} x^\alpha \ L_n^\alpha(x)\  f(x) \ dx&lt;/math&gt;

The inverse Laguerre transform is given by

:&lt;math&gt;L^{-1}\{\tilde f_\alpha(n)\} = f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \binom{n+\alpha}{n}^{-1} \frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha+1)} \tilde f_\alpha(n) L_n^\alpha(x)&lt;/math&gt;

In [[mathematics]], the '''law''' of a [[stochastic process]] is the [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] that the process induces on the collection of [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] from the [[index set]] into the state space.  The law encodes a lot of information about the process; in the case of a [[random walk]], for example, the law is the [[probability measure|probability distribution]] of the possible trajectories of the walk.

==Definition==
Let (Ω,&amp;nbsp;''F'',&amp;nbsp;'''P''') be a [[probability space]], ''T'' some index set, and (''S'',&amp;nbsp;Σ) a [[measurable space]]. Let ''X''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''T''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;Ω&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''S'' be a stochastic process (so the map

:&lt;math&gt;X_{t} : \Omega \to S : \omega \mapsto X (t, \omega)&lt;/math&gt;

is a (''F'',&amp;nbsp;Σ)-[[measurable function]] for each ''t''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''T''). Let ''S''&lt;sup&gt;''T''&lt;/sup&gt; denote the collection of all functions from ''T'' into ''S''. The process ''X'' (by way of [[currying]]) induces a function Φ&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;Ω&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''S''&lt;sup&gt;''T''&lt;/sup&gt;, where

:&lt;math&gt;\left( \Phi_{X} (\omega) \right) (t) := X_{t} (\omega).&lt;/math&gt;

The '''law''' of the process ''X'' is then defined to be the [[pushforward measure]]

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_{X} := \left( \Phi_{X} \right)_{*} ( \mathbf{P} ) = \mathbf P \circ \Phi_X^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

on ''S''&lt;sup&gt;''T''&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Example==
* The law of standard [[Brownian motion]] is [[classical Wiener measure]]. (Indeed, many authors define Brownian motion to be a [[sample continuous process]] starting at the origin whose law is Wiener measure, and then proceed to derive the independence of increments and other properties from this definition; other authors prefer to work in the opposite direction.)

'''Linear logic''' is a [[substructural logic]] proposed by [[Jean-Yves Girard]] as a refinement of [[classical logic|classical]] and [[intuitionistic logic]], joining the [[Duality (mathematics)|dualities]] of the former with many of the [[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructive]] properties of the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Jean-Yves|last1=Girard|author1-link=Jean-Yves Girard|year=1987|title=Linear logic|journal=Theoretical Computer Science|volume=50|issue=1|pages=1–102|url=http://iml.univ-mrs.fr/~girard/linear.pdf|doi=10.1016/0304-3975(87)90045-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the logic has also been studied for its own sake, more broadly, ideas from linear logic have been influential in fields such as [[programming languages]], [[game semantics]], and [[quantum physics]] (because linear logic can be seen as the logic of [[quantum information theory]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=John|last1=Baez|author1-link=John Baez|first2=Mike|last2=Stay|year=2008|title=Physics, Topology, Logic and Computation: A Rosetta Stone|editor=[[Bob Coecke]]|journal=New Structures of Physics|url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/rosetta.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[linguistics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dagstuhl Seminar 99341 on Linear Logic and Applications|first1=V.|last1=de Paiva|author1-link= Valeria de Paiva |first2=J.|last2=van Genabith|first3=E.|last3=Ritter|year=1999|url=http://www.dagstuhl.de/Reports/99/99341.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly because of its emphasis on resource-boundedness, duality, and interaction.

Linear logic lends itself to many different presentations, explanations and intuitions.
[[Proof theory|Proof-theoretically]], it derives from an analysis of classical [[sequent calculus]] in which uses of (the [[structural rule]]s) [[Idempotency of entailment|contraction]] and [[Monotonicity of entailment|weakening]] are carefully controlled.  Operationally, this means that logical deduction is no longer merely about an ever-expanding collection of persistent "truths", but also a way of manipulating ''resources'' that cannot always be duplicated or thrown away at will.  In terms of simple denotational models, linear logic may be seen as refining the interpretation of intuitionistic logic by replacing [[cartesian closed categories | cartesian (closed) categories]] by [[symmetric monoidal categories | symmetric monoidal (closed) categories]], or the interpretation of classical logic by replacing [[boolean algebras]] by [[C*-algebras]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

==Connectives, duality, and polarity==

===Syntax===
The language of ''classical linear logic'' (CLL) is defined inductively by the [[Backus–Naur form|BNF notation]]

{| style="margin:auto"
|-
| {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
| ::=
| {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;p&lt;/VAR&gt; ∣ &lt;VAR&gt;p&lt;/VAR&gt;&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt;}}
|-
|
| {{math|∣}}
| {{math| &lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt; ⊗ &lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt; ∣ &lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt; ⊕ &lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
|-
|
| {{math|∣}}
| {{math| &lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt; &amp; &lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt; ∣ &lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt; ⅋ &lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
|-
|
| {{math|∣}}
| {{math| 1 ∣ 0 ∣ ⊤ ∣ ⊥}}
|-
|
| {{math|∣}}
| {{math| !&lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt; ∣ ?&lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
|}

Here {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;p&lt;/VAR&gt;}} and {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;p&lt;/VAR&gt;&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt;}} range
over [[Atomic formula|logical atoms]].  For reasons to be explained
below, the [[Logical connective|connectives]] ⊗, ⅋, 1, and
⊥ are called ''multiplicatives'', the connectives &amp;,
⊕, ⊤, and 0 are called ''additives'', and the
connectives ! and ? are called ''exponentials''.  We can further
employ the following terminology:

* ⊗ is called "multiplicative conjunction" or "times" (or sometimes "tensor")
* ⊕ is called "additive disjunction" or "plus"
* &amp; is called "additive conjunction" or "with"
* ⅋ is called "multiplicative disjunction" or "par"
* ! is pronounced "of course" (or sometimes "bang")
* ? is pronounced "why not"

Binary connectives ⊗, ⊕, &amp; and ⅋ are associative and commutative; 1 is the unit for ⊗, 0 is the unit for ⊕, ⊥ is the unit for ⅋ and ⊤ is the unit for &amp;.
 
Every proposition {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt;}} in CLL has a '''dual''' {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt;&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt;}}, defined as follows:

| colspan=3 align="center"| {{math|(&lt;VAR&gt;p&lt;/VAR&gt;&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt;  {{=}} &lt;VAR&gt;p&lt;/VAR&gt;}}

Observe that {{math|(-)&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt;}} is an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]], i.e., {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt;&lt;sup&gt;⊥⊥&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} &lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt;}} for all propositions.  {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt;&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt;}} is also called the ''linear negation'' of {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt;}}.

The columns of the table suggest another way of classifying the connectives of linear logic, termed '''polarity''': the connectives negated in the left column (⊗, ⊕, 1, 0, !) are called ''positive'', while their duals on the right (⅋, &amp;, ⊥, ⊤, ?) are called ''negative''; cf. table on the right.

''Linear implication'' is not included in the grammar of connectives, but is definable in CLL using linear negation and multiplicative disjunction, by {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt; ⊸ &lt;VAR&gt;B&lt;/VAR&gt; :{{=}} &lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt;&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt; ⅋ &lt;VAR&gt;B&lt;/VAR&gt;}}.  The connective ⊸ is sometimes pronounced "[[lollipop]]", owing to its shape.

==Sequent calculus presentation==

One way of defining linear logic is as a [[sequent calculus]].  We use the letters {{math| &amp;Gamma;}} and {{math| &amp;Delta;}} to range over list of propositions {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., &lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}}, also called ''contexts''. A ''sequent'' places a context to the left and the right of the [[turnstile (symbol)|turnstile]], written {{math|&amp;Gamma; {{tee}} &amp;Delta;}}. Intuitively, the sequent asserts that the conjunction of {{math| &amp;Gamma;}} [[Logical consequence|entails]] the disjunction of {{math| &amp;Delta;}} (though we mean the "multiplicative" conjunction and disjunction, as explained below).  Girard describes classical linear logic using only ''one-sided'' sequents (where the left-hand context is empty), and we follow here that more economical presentation. This is possible because any premises to the left of a turnstile can always be moved to the other side and dualised.

We now give [[Sequent calculus#Inference rules|inference rules]] describing how to build proofs of sequents.&lt;ref&gt;Girard (1987), p.22, Def.1.15&lt;/ref&gt;

First, to formalize the fact that we do not care about the order of propositions inside a context, we add the structural rule of
[[exchange rule|exchange]]:

{| style="margin:auto" border="0"
|-
| {{math|{{tee}} &amp;Gamma;, A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;Delta;}}
|-
| style="border-top:2px solid black;" |
|-
| {{math|{{tee}} &amp;Gamma;, A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;Delta;}}
|}

Note that we do '''not''' add the structural rules of weakening and contraction, because we do care about the
absence of propositions in a sequent, and the number of copies present.

Next we add ''initial sequents'' and ''cuts'':
{| style="margin:auto"
|-
| style="text-align: center;" |
{| border="0"
|-
| &amp;nbsp;
|-
| style="border-top:2px solid black;" |
|-
| {{math|{{tee}} &lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt;, &lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt;&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt;}}
|}
| width="50" |
| style="text-align: center;" |
{| border="0"
|-
| {{math|{{tee}} &amp;Gamma;, &lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt;}} || &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; || {{math|{{tee}} &lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt;&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt;, &amp;Delta;}}
|-
| colspan=4 style="border-top:2px solid black;" |
|-
| colspan=4 align="center" | {{math|{{tee}} &amp;Gamma;, &amp;Delta;}}
|}
|}

The cut rule can be seen as a way of composing proofs, and initial sequents serve as the [[identity element|units]]
for composition.  In a certain sense these rules are redundant: as we introduce additional rules for building proofs below, we will maintain the property that arbitrary initial sequents can be derived from atomic initial sequents, and that whenever a sequent is provable it can be given a cut-free proof.  Ultimately, this [[canonical form]] property (which can be divided into the [[completeness of atomic initial sequents]] and the [[cut-elimination theorem]], inducing a notion of [[analytic proof]]) lies behind the applications of linear logic in computer science, since it allows the logic to be used in proof search and as a resource-aware lambda-calculus.

Now, we explain the connectives by giving ''logical rules''.  Typically in sequent calculus
one gives both "right-rules" and "left-rules" for each connective, essentially describing two modes of reasoning
about propositions involving that connective (e.g., verification and falsification).  In a one-sided presentation, one instead makes use of negation: the right-rules for a connective
(say ⅋) effectively play the role of left-rules for its dual (⊗).  So, we should expect a certain [[Logical harmony|"harmony"]]
between the rule(s) for a connective and the rule(s) for its dual.

===Multiplicatives===

The rules for multiplicative conjunction (⊗) and disjunction (⅋):
{| style="margin:auto"
|-
| style="text-align: center;" |
{| border="0"
|-
| {{math|{{tee}} &amp;Gamma;, &lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt;}} || &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; || {{math|{{tee}} &amp;Delta;, &lt;VAR&gt;B&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
|-
| colspan=4 style="border-top:2px solid black;" |
|-
| colspan=4 align="center" | {{math|{{tee}} &amp;Gamma;, &amp;Delta;, &lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt; ⊗ &lt;VAR&gt;B&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
|}
| width="50" |
| style="text-align: center;" |
{| border="0"
|-
| {{math|{{tee}} &amp;Gamma;, &lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt;, &lt;VAR&gt;B&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
|-
| style="border-top:2px solid black;" |
|-
| {{math|{{tee}} &amp;Gamma;, &lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt; ⅋ &lt;VAR&gt;B&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
|}
|}

and for their units:
{| style="margin:auto"
|-
| style="text-align: center;" |
{| border="0"
|-
| &amp;nbsp;
|-
| colspan=4 style="border-top:2px solid black;" |
|-
| colspan=4 align="center" | {{math|{{tee}} 1}}
|}
| width="50" |
| style="text-align: center;" |
{| border="0"
|-
| {{math|{{tee}} &amp;Gamma;}}
|-
| style="border-top:2px solid black;" |
|-
| {{math|{{tee}} &amp;Gamma;, ⊥}}
|}
|}

Observe that the rules for multiplicative conjunction and disjunction are [[Admissible rule|admissible]] for
plain ''conjunction'' and ''disjunction'' under a classical interpretation
(i.e., they are admissible rules in [[Sequent calculus#The system LK|LK]]).

===Additives===

The rules for additive conjunction (&amp;) and disjunction (⊕) :
{| style="margin:auto"
|-
| style="text-align: center;" |
{| border="0"
|-
| {{math|{{tee}} &amp;Gamma;, &lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt;}} || &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; || {{math|{{tee}} &amp;Gamma;, &lt;VAR&gt;B&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
|-
| colspan=4 style="border-top:2px solid black;" |
|-
| colspan=4 align="center" | {{math|{{tee}} &amp;Gamma;, &lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt; &amp; &lt;VAR&gt;B&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
|}
| width="50" |
| style="text-align: center;" |
{| border="0"
|-
| {{math|{{tee}} &amp;Gamma;, &lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
|-
| style="border-top:2px solid black;" |
|-
| {{math|{{tee}} &amp;Gamma;, &lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt; ⊕ &lt;VAR&gt;B&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
|}
| width="25" |
| style="text-align: center;" |
{| border="0"
|-
| {{math|{{tee}} &amp;Gamma;, &lt;VAR&gt;B&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
|-
| style="border-top:2px solid black;" |
|-
| {{math|{{tee}} &amp;Gamma;, &lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt; ⊕ &lt;VAR&gt;B&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
|}
|}
and for their units:
{| style="margin:auto"
|-
| style="text-align: center;" |
{| border="0"
|-
| &amp;nbsp;
|-
| colspan=4 style="border-top:2px solid black;" |
|-
| colspan=4 align="center" | {{math|{{tee}} &amp;Gamma;, ⊤}}
|}
| width="50" |
| style="text-align: center;" | (no rule for {{math|0}})
|}

Observe that the rules for additive conjunction and disjunction are again admissible
under a classical interpretation.  But now we can explain the basis for the multiplicative/additive distinction
in the rules for the two different versions of conjunction: for the multiplicative connective (⊗),
the context of the conclusion ({{math|&amp;Gamma;, &amp;Delta;}}) is split up between the premises, whereas
for the additive case connective (&amp;) the context of the conclusion ({{math|&amp;Gamma;}}) is carried whole into both
premises.

===Exponentials===

The exponentials are used to give controlled access to weakening and contraction.  Specifically, we add
structural rules of weakening and contraction for  ?'d propositions:&lt;ref&gt;Girard (1987), p.25-26, Def.1.21&lt;/ref&gt;
{| style="margin:auto"
|-
| style="text-align: center;" |
{| border="0"
|-
| {{math|{{tee}} &amp;Gamma;}}
|-
| style="border-top:2px solid black;" |
|-
| {{math|{{tee}} &amp;Gamma;, ?&lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
|}
| width="50" |
| style="text-align: center;" |
{| border="0"
|-
| {{math|{{tee}} &amp;Gamma;, ?&lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt;, ?&lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
|-
| style="border-top:2px solid black;" |
|-
| {{math|{{tee}} &amp;Gamma;, ?&lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
|}
|}
and use the following logical rules:
{| style="margin:auto"
|-
| style="text-align: center;" |
{| border="0"
|-
| {{math|{{tee}} ?&amp;Gamma;, &lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
|-
| style="border-top:2px solid black;" |
|-
| {{math|{{tee}} ?&amp;Gamma;, !&lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
|}
| width="50" |
| style="text-align: center;" |
{| border="0"
|-
| {{math|{{tee}} &amp;Gamma;, &lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
|-
| style="border-top:2px solid black;" |
|-
| {{math|{{tee}} &amp;Gamma;, ?&lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
|}
|}
One might observe that the rules for the exponentials follow a different pattern from the rules for the other connectives,
resembling the inference rules governing modalities in sequent calculus formalisations of the [[normal modal logic]] S4, and that there is no longer such a clear symmetry between the duals ! and ?.  This situation is remedied in alternative
presentations of CLL (e.g., the [[Logic of unity|LU]] presentation).

==Remarkable formulae==

In addition to the [[De Morgan's laws|De Morgan dualities]] described above, some important equivalences in linear logic include:

; Distributivity : &lt;math&gt;A\otimes(B\oplus C)\equiv(A\otimes B)\oplus(A\otimes C)&lt;/math&gt;
; Exponential isomorphism : &lt;math&gt;\,!(A \&amp; B)\equiv \,!A \otimes \,!B&lt;/math&gt;

(Here &lt;math&gt;A\equiv B\quad=\quad(A\multimap B)\&amp;(B\multimap A)&lt;/math&gt;.)

Assume that ⅋ is any of the binary operators times, plus, with or par (but not linear implication). The following is not in general an equivalence, only an implication:

; Linear-distributions : 

A map which is not an isomorphism yet plays a crucial role in linear logic is:

{{math|(&lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt; ⊗ (&lt;VAR&gt;B&lt;/VAR&gt; ⅋ &lt;VAR&gt;C&lt;/VAR&gt;)) ⊸ ((&lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt; ⊗ &lt;VAR&gt;B&lt;/VAR&gt;) ⅋ &lt;VAR&gt;C&lt;/VAR&gt;)}}

Linear distributions are fundamental in the proof theory of linear logic.  The consequence of this map were first investigated in &lt;ref&gt; Cockett and Seely "Weakly distributive categories"  JPAA 114(2) 133-173, 1997 &lt;/ref&gt; and called a "weak distribution".  In subsequent work it was renamed to "linear distribution" to reflect the fundamental connection to linear logic.

==Encoding classical/intuitionistic logic in linear logic==

Both intuitionistic and classical implication can be recovered from linear implication by inserting exponentials: intuitionistic implication is encoded as {{math|!&lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt; ⊸ &lt;VAR&gt;B&lt;/VAR&gt;}}, while classical implication can be encoded as {{math|!?&lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt; ⊸ ?&lt;VAR&gt;B&lt;/VAR&gt;}} or {{math|!&lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt; ⊸ ?!&lt;VAR&gt;B&lt;/VAR&gt;}} (or a variety of alternative possible translations).&lt;ref&gt;Di Cosmo, Roberto. ''[http://www.dicosmo.org/CourseNotes/LinLog/ The Linear Logic Primer]''. Course notes; chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is that exponentials allow us to use a formula as many times as we need, which is always possible in classical and intuitionistic logic.

Formally, there exists a translation of formulae of intuitionistic logic to formulae of linear logic in a way which guarantees that the original formula is provable in intuitionistic logic if and only if the translated formula is provable in linear logic. Using the [[Gödel–Gentzen negative translation]], we can thus embed classical first-order logic into linear first-order logic.

==The resource interpretation==

Lafont (1993) first showed how intuitionistic linear logic can be explained as a logic of resources, so providing the logical language with access to formalisms that can be used for reasoning about resources within the logic itself, rather than, as in classical logic, by means of non-logical predicates and relations.  [[Antony Hoare]] (1985)'s classical example of the vending machine can be used to illustrate this idea.

Suppose we represent having a candy bar by the atomic proposition {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;candy&lt;/VAR&gt;}}, and having a dollar by {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;$1&lt;/VAR&gt;}}. To state the fact that a dollar will buy you one candy bar, we might write the implication {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;$1&lt;/VAR&gt; &amp;rArr; &lt;VAR&gt;candy&lt;/VAR&gt;}}.  But in ordinary (classical or intuitionistic) logic, from {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt;}} and {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt; &amp;rArr; &lt;VAR&gt;B&lt;/VAR&gt;}} one can conclude {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt; &amp;and; &lt;VAR&gt;B&lt;/VAR&gt;}}.  So, ordinary logic leads us to believe that we can buy the candy bar and keep our dollar!  Of course,
we can avoid this problem by using more sophisticated encodings,{{what|reason=It is difficult to guess what this might mean without a link|date=May 2015}} although typically such encodings suffer from the [[frame problem]].  However, the rejection of weakening and contraction allows linear logic to avoid this kind of spurious reasoning even with the "naive" rule.  Rather than {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;$1&lt;/VAR&gt; &amp;rArr; &lt;VAR&gt;candy&lt;/VAR&gt;}}, we express the property of the vending machine as a ''linear'' implication {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;$1&lt;/VAR&gt;  ⊸ &lt;VAR&gt;candy&lt;/VAR&gt;}}.  From {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;$1&lt;/VAR&gt;}} and this fact, we can conclude {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;candy&lt;/VAR&gt;}}, but ''not'' {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;$1&lt;/VAR&gt; ⊗ &lt;VAR&gt;candy&lt;/VAR&gt;}}.  In general, we can use the linear logic proposition {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt; ⊸ &lt;VAR&gt;B&lt;/VAR&gt;}} to express the validity of transforming resource {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt;}} into resource {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;B&lt;/VAR&gt;}}.

Running with the example of the vending machine, let us consider the "resource interpretations" of the other multiplicative and additive connectives.  (The exponentials provide the means to combine this resource interpretation with the usual notion of persistent [[logical truth]].)

Multiplicative conjunction {{math|(&lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt; ⊗ &lt;VAR&gt;B&lt;/VAR&gt;)}} denotes simultaneous occurrence of resources, to be used as the consumer directs. For example, if you buy a stick of gum and a bottle of soft drink, then you are requesting {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;gum&lt;/VAR&gt; ⊗ &lt;VAR&gt;drink&lt;/VAR&gt;}}. The constant 1 denotes the absence of any resource, and so functions as the unit of ⊗.

Additive conjunction {{math|(&lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt; &amp; &lt;VAR&gt;B&lt;/VAR&gt;)}} represents alternative occurrence of resources, the choice of which the consumer controls. If in the vending machine there is a packet of chips, a candy bar, and a can of soft drink, each costing one dollar, then for that price you can buy exactly one of these products.  Thus we write {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;$1&lt;/VAR&gt; ⊸ (&lt;VAR&gt;candy&lt;/VAR&gt; &amp; &lt;VAR&gt;chips&lt;/VAR&gt; &amp; &lt;VAR&gt;drink&lt;/VAR&gt;)}}.  We do ''not'' write {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;$1&lt;/VAR&gt; ⊸ (&lt;VAR&gt;candy&lt;/VAR&gt; ⊗ &lt;VAR&gt;chips&lt;/VAR&gt; ⊗ &lt;VAR&gt;drink&lt;/VAR&gt;)}}, which would imply that one dollar suffices for buying all three products together.  However, from  {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;$1&lt;/VAR&gt; ⊸ (&lt;VAR&gt;candy&lt;/VAR&gt; &amp; &lt;VAR&gt;chips&lt;/VAR&gt; &amp; &lt;VAR&gt;drink&lt;/VAR&gt;)}}, we can correctly deduce {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;$3&lt;/VAR&gt; ⊸ (&lt;VAR&gt;candy&lt;/VAR&gt; ⊗ &lt;VAR&gt;chips&lt;/VAR&gt; ⊗ &lt;VAR&gt;drink&lt;/VAR&gt;)}}, where {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;$3&lt;/VAR&gt; :{{=}} &lt;VAR&gt;$1&lt;/VAR&gt; ⊗ &lt;VAR&gt;$1&lt;/VAR&gt; ⊗ &lt;VAR&gt;$1&lt;/VAR&gt;}}.  The unit ⊤ of additive conjunction can be seen as a wastebasket &lt;!--or [[Garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collector]]--&gt; for unneeded resources. For example, we can write {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;$3&lt;/VAR&gt; ⊸ (&lt;VAR&gt;candy&lt;/VAR&gt; ⊗ ⊤)}} to express that with three dollars you can get a candy bar and some other stuff, without being more specific (for example, chips and a drink, or $2, or $1 and chips, etc.).

Additive disjunction {{math|(&lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt; ⊕ &lt;VAR&gt;B&lt;/VAR&gt;)}} represents alternative occurrence of resources, the choice of which the machine controls.  For example, suppose the vending machine permits gambling: insert a dollar and the machine may dispense a candy bar, a packet of chips, or a soft drink.  We can express this situation as {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;$1&lt;/VAR&gt; ⊸ (&lt;VAR&gt;candy&lt;/VAR&gt; ⊕ &lt;VAR&gt;chips&lt;/VAR&gt; ⊕ &lt;VAR&gt;drink&lt;/VAR&gt;)}}.  The constant 0 represents a product that cannot be made, and thus serves as the unit of ⊕ (a machine that might produce {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt;}} or {{math|0}} is as good as a machine that always produces {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt;}} because it will never succeed in producing a 0).

Multiplicative disjunction {{math|(&lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt; ⅋ &lt;VAR&gt;B&lt;/VAR&gt;)}} is more difficult to gloss in terms of the resource interpretation, although we can encode back into linear implication, either as {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt;&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt; ⊸ &lt;VAR&gt;B&lt;/VAR&gt;}} or {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;B&lt;/VAR&gt;&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt; ⊸ &lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt;}}.

== Other proof systems ==

=== Proof nets ===
{{main|Proof net}}
Introduced by [[Jean-Yves Girard]], proof nets have been created to avoid the ''bureaucracy'', that is all the things that make two derivations different in the logical point of view, but not in a "moral" point of view.

For instance, these two proofs are "morally" identical:
{| style="margin:auto"
|-
| style="text-align: center;" |
{| border="0"
|-
| {{math|{{tee}} &lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt;, &lt;VAR&gt;B&lt;/VAR&gt;, &lt;VAR&gt;C&lt;/VAR&gt;, &lt;VAR&gt;D&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
|-
| style="border-top:2px solid black;" |
|-
| {{math|{{tee}} &lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt; ⅋ &lt;VAR&gt;B&lt;/VAR&gt;, &lt;VAR&gt;C&lt;/VAR&gt;, &lt;VAR&gt;D&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
|-
| style="border-top:2px solid black;" |
|-
| {{math|{{tee}} &lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt; ⅋ &lt;VAR&gt;B&lt;/VAR&gt;, &lt;VAR&gt;C&lt;/VAR&gt; ⅋ &lt;VAR&gt;D&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
|}
| style="text-align: center;" |
{| border="0"
|-
| {{math|{{tee}} &lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt;, &lt;VAR&gt;B&lt;/VAR&gt;, &lt;VAR&gt;C&lt;/VAR&gt;, &lt;VAR&gt;D&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
|-
| style="border-top:2px solid black;" |
|-
| {{math|{{tee}} &lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt;, &lt;VAR&gt;B&lt;/VAR&gt;, &lt;VAR&gt;C&lt;/VAR&gt; ⅋ &lt;VAR&gt;D&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
|-
| style="border-top:2px solid black;" |
|-
| {{math|{{tee}} &lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt; ⅋ &lt;VAR&gt;B&lt;/VAR&gt;, &lt;VAR&gt;C&lt;/VAR&gt; ⅋ &lt;VAR&gt;D&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
|}
|}

The goal of proof nets is to make them identical by creating a graphical representation of them.

==Decidability/complexity of entailment==

The [[entailment]] relation in full CLL is [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]].&lt;ref name="Lincoln+92"&gt;For this result and discussion of some of the fragments below, see: {{cite journal|first1=Patrick|last1=Lincoln|first2=John|last2=Mitchell|first3=Andre|last3=Scedrov|first4=Natarajan|last4=Shankar|year=1992|title=Decision Problems for Propositional Linear Logic|journal=Annals of Pure and Applied Logic|volume=56|pages=239–311|doi=10.1016/0168-0072(92)90075-B}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When considering fragments of
CLL, the decision problem has varying complexity:

* Multiplicative linear logic (MLL): only the multiplicative connectives.  MLL entailment is [[NP-complete]], even restricting to [[Horn clauses]] in the purely implicative fragment,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference| doi = 10.1109/LICS.1992.185533| conference = Seventh Annual IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science, 1992. LICS '92. Proceedings| pages = 200–210| last = Kanovich| first = Max I.| title = Horn programming in linear logic is NP-complete| booktitle = Seventh Annual IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science, 1992. LICS '92. Proceedings| date = 1992-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to atom-free formulas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Patrick|last1=Lincoln|first2=Timothy|last2=Winkler|year=1994|title=Constant-only multiplicative linear logic is NP-complete|journal=Theoretical Computer Science|volume=135|pages=155–169|doi=10.1016/0304-3975(94)00108-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Multiplicative-additive linear logic (MALL): only multiplicatives and additives (i.e., exponential-free).  MALL entailment is [[PSPACE-complete]].&lt;ref name="Lincoln+92" /&gt;
* Multiplicative-exponential linear logic (MELL): only multiplicatives and exponentials. By reduction from the reachability problem for [[Petri nets]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference| conference = Tenth International Conference on Application and Theory of Petri Nets. Proceedings| pages = 174-191| last1 = Gunter| first1 = C. A.| last2 = Gehlot| first2 = V.| year = 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; MELL entailment must be at least [[EXPSPACE|EXPSPACE-hard]], although decidability itself has had the status of a longstanding open problem. In 2015, a proof of decidability was published in the journal [[Theoretical Computer Science (journal)|TCS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.tcs.2015.06.019| issn = 0304-3975| volume = 597| pages = 1–17| last = Bimbó| first = Katalin| title = The decidability of the intensional fragment of classical linear logic| journal = Theoretical Computer Science| date = 2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Affine linear logic (that is linear logic with weakening, an extension rather than a fragment) was shown to be decidable, in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference| doi = 10.1109/LICS.1995.523283|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.23.9226| conference = Tenth Annual IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science, 1995. LICS '95. Proceedings| pages = 496–504| last = Kopylov| first = A. P.| title = Decidability of linear affine logic| booktitle = , Tenth Annual IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science, 1995. LICS '95. Proceedings| date = 1995-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==

Many variations of linear logic arise by further tinkering with the structural rules:

* [[Affine logic]], which forbids contraction but allows global weakening (a decidable extension).
* [[Strict logic]] or [[relevant logic]], which forbids weakening but allows global contraction.
* [[Noncommutative logic|Non-commutative logic]] or ordered logic, which removes the rule of exchange, in addition to barring weakening and contraction.  In ordered logic, linear implication divides further into left-implication and right-implication.

Different intuitionistic variants of linear logic have been considered. When based on a single-conclusion sequent calculus presentation, like in ILL (Intuitionistic Linear Logic), the connectives ⅋, ⊥, and ? are absent, and linear implication is treated as a primitive connective. In FILL (Full Intuitionistic Linear Logic) the connectives ⅋, ⊥, and ? are present, linear implication is a primitive connective and, similarly to what happens in intuitionistic logic, all connectives (except linear negation) are independent.
There are also first- and higher-order extensions of linear logic, whose formal development is somewhat standard (see [[first-order logic]] and [[higher-order logic]]).

'''Neil Immerman''' (24 November 1953, [[Manhasset, New York]]) is an American [[theoretical computer science|theoretical computer scientist]], a professor of computer science at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]].&lt;ref name="um-dir"&gt;[http://www.cs.umass.edu/faculty/directory/immerman_neil Faculty directory: Neil Immerman], Computer Science Department, [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], retrieved 2010-01-23.&lt;/ref&gt; He is one of the key developers of [[descriptive complexity]], an approach he is currently applying to research in model checking, database theory, and computational complexity theory.

Professor Immerman is an editor of the ''[[SIAM Journal on Computing]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siam.org/journals/sicomp/board.php Editorial board], ''[[SIAM Journal on Computing]]'', retrieved 2010-01-23.&lt;/ref&gt; and of ''[[Logical Methods in Computer Science]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lmcs-online.org/ojs/edBoard.php Editorial board], ''[[Logical Methods in Computer Science]]'', retrieved 2010-01-23.&lt;/ref&gt; He received B.S. and M.S. degrees from [[Yale University]] in 1974 and his Ph.D. from [[Cornell University]] in 1980 under the supervision of [[Juris Hartmanis]], a [[Turing award]] winner at Cornell.&lt;ref name="um-dir"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{mathgenealogy|name=Neil  Immerman |id=30442}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His book "Descriptive Complexity" appeared in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Graduate Texts in Computer Science, Springer-Verlag, {{ISBN|978-0-387-98600-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Immerman is the winner, jointly with [[Róbert Szelepcsényi]], of the 1995 [[Gödel Prize]] in theoretical computer science for proof of what is known as  the [[Immerman–Szelepcsényi theorem]], the result that [[NSPACE|nondeterministic space]] [[complexity class]]es are [[Closure (mathematics)|closed]] under [[Complement (set theory)|complementation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sigact.acm.org/prizes/godel/1995.html 1995 Gödel Prize], [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] [[SIGACT]], retrieved 2010-01-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Immerman is an [[List of Fellows of the Association for Computing Machinery|ACM Fellow]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://fellows.acm.org/fellow_citation.cfm?id=1758739&amp;srt=all ACM Fellows Award / Neil Immerman], [[Association for Computing Machinery]], retrieved 2010-01-23.&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Guggenheim Fellow]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gf.org/fellows/7088-neil-immerman Neil Immerman] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604012149/http://www.gf.org/fellows/7088-neil-immerman |date=2011-06-04 }}, John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, retrieved 2010-01-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
'''Neil James Alexander Sloane''' (born October 10, 1939) is a British-American mathematician.&lt;ref&gt;Sloane's home page {{cite web | title= ''Neil J. A. Sloane: Home Page'' | url=http://NeilSloane.com |accessdate= June 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His major contributions are in the fields of [[combinatorics]], [[error-correcting code]]s, and [[sphere packing]]. Sloane is best known for being the creator and maintainer of the [[On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences]] (OEIS).&lt;ref&gt;Contains information on over two hundred thousand [[integer sequence]]s {{cite web |title=''The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences'' |url= http://oeis.org |accessdate=6 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Sloane was born in [[Wales]] and brought up in [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[The Guardian]], [https://www.theguardian.com/science/alexs-adventures-in-numberland/2014/oct/07/neil-sloane-the-man-who-loved-only-integer-sequences Neil Sloane: the man who loved only integer sequences], October 7, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied at [[Cornell University]] under Nick DeClaris, [[Frank Rosenblatt]], [[Frederick Jelinek]] and [[Wolfgang Heinrich Johannes Fuchs]], receiving his Ph.D. in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=80980}}&lt;/ref&gt; His doctoral dissertation was titled ''Lengths of Cycle Times in Random [[Artificial neural network|Neural Network]]s''.  Sloane joined [[AT&amp;T Bell Labs]] in 1968 and retired from [[AT&amp;T Labs]] in 2012. He became an [[Fellow|AT&amp;T Fellow]] in 1998. He is also a Fellow of the Learned Society of Wales,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.learnedsociety.wales/fellow/neil-sloane/ |title=Dr Neil Sloane |publisher=[[Learned Society of Wales]] |work=Fellows |year=2015 |accessdate=2017-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; an [[IEEE Fellow]], a Fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved 2013-07-20.&lt;/ref&gt; and a member of the [[National Academy of Engineering]].

He is a winner of a [[Lester R. Ford Award]] in 1978&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sloane, Neil J. A.|title=Error correcting codes and invariant theory: new applications of a 19th century technique|journal=Amer. Math.

In 2005 Sloane received the [[IEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ieee.org/documents/hamming_rl.pdf |title=IEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal Recipients |publisher=[[IEEE]] |accessdate=May 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2008 he received the Mathematical Association of America David P. Robbins award, and in 2013 the [[George Pólya Award]].

In 2014, to celebrate his 75th birthday, Sloane shared some of his favorite integer sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bellos|first1=Alex|title=Neil Sloane: the man who loved only integer sequences|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/alexs-adventures-in-numberland/2014/oct/07/neil-sloane-the-man-who-loved-only-integer-sequences|website=The Guardian|accessdate=10 December 2016|date=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides mathematics, he loves [[rock climbing]] and has authored two rock-climbing guides to [[New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;Sloane's webpage for the book {{cite web | title=''Rock Climbing New Jersey''|url=http://neilsloane.com/doc/GUIDE00/|accessdate=6 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nicolas Chuquet''' ({{IPA-fr|ʃykɛ|lang}}; 1445, but some sources say {{circa}} 1455, [[Paris]], [[France]] &amp;ndash; 1488, some sources say {{circa}} 1500, [[Lyon]], France) was a [[France|French]] [[mathematics|mathematician]]. He invented his own notation for algebraic concepts and [[exponentiation]]. He may have been the first mathematician to recognize zero and negative numbers as exponents.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In 1475, [[Jehan Adam]] recorded the words "bymillion" and "trimillion" (for 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;) and it is believed that these words or similar ones were in general use at that time.

In 1484, Chuquet wrote an article ''Triparty en la science des nombres'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.miakinen.net/vrac/nombres#lettres_zillions&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://hexadecimal.florencetime.net/chuquet/triparty.htm&lt;/ref&gt; which was unpublished in his lifetime. Most of it, however, was copied without attribution by [[Estienne de La Roche]] in his 1520 textbook, ''l'Arismetique.'' In the 1870s, scholar [[Aristide Marre]] discovered Chuquet's manuscript and published it in 1880. The manuscript contained notes in de la Roche's handwriting. His article shows a huge number divided into groups of six digits, and in a short passage he states that the groups can be called:
:&lt;cite&gt;"million, the second mark byllion, the third mark tryllion, the fourth quadrillion, the fifth quyillion, the sixth sixlion, the seventh septyllion, the eighth ottyllion, the ninth nonyllion and so on with others as far as you wish to go.&lt;/cite&gt;

In a second passage, he wrote:

[[Image:Chuquet.gif|thumb|right|500px|&lt;center&gt;''Le Triparty en la Science des Nombres par Maistre Nicolas Chuquet Parisien''&lt;br&gt;- an extract from Chuquet's original 1484 manuscript&lt;/center&gt;]]

:... Item lon doit savoir que ung million vault mille milliers de unitez, et ung byllion vault mille milliers de millions, et [ung] tryllion vault mille milliers de byllions, et ung quadrillion vault mille milliers de tryllions et ainsi des aultres : Et de ce en est pose ung exemple nombre divise et punctoye ainsi que devant est dit, tout lequel nombre monte 745324 tryllions 804300 byllions 700023 millions 654321. Exemple : 745324'8043000'700023'654321 ...

:Item: one should know that a million is worth a thousand thousand units, and a byllion is worth a thousand thousand millions, and tryillion is worth a thousand thousand byllions, and a quadrillion is worth a thousand thousand tryllions, and so on for the others. And an example of this follows, a number divided up and punctuated as previously described, the whole number being seven hundred forty-five thousand three hundred and twenty-four tryllions, 804300 byllions 700023 millions 654321 ...

The extract from Chuquet's manuscript, the transcription and translation provided here all contain an original mistake: one too many zeros in the 804300 portion of the fully written out example: 745324'8043000 '700023'654321 ...

Chuquet was, however, the original author of the earliest work using of a systematic, extended ''series'' of names ending in -illion or -yllion. The system in which the names million, billion, trillion, etc. refer to powers of one million is sometimes referred to as the Chuquet system.

In 1514, [[Budaeus]] introduced the term ''Milliard'' or ''Milliart'' for 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;, which was widely publicised around 1550 by the influential [[Jacques Peletier du Mans]]. Milliard was reduced to 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; around the end of the 17th century, leaving the modern Long scale system. This system is sometimes referred to as the Chuquet-Peletier system.

Much later, in France and in the US, a different system, the [[long and short scales|short scale]], became established where the term billion signifies 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;.

Last century, England and other English-speaking countries joined the US and some countries in using the short scale system; whereas, France rejoined Germany, much of Europe, and some other countries in the Chuquet-Peletier, or [[long and short scales|long scale]], system.

The concept of noise-based logic and its name was created by [[Laszlo B. Kish]]. In its foundation paper&lt;ref name =first/&gt;  it is noted that the idea was inspired by the stochasticity of [[brain]] signals and by the unconventional noise-based communication schemes, such as the [[Laszlo_B._Kish|Kish]] cypher.

==The noise-based logic space and hyperspace==
The logic values are represented by [[multi-dimensional]] "[[vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]]s" ([[orthogonal functions]]) and their [[Superposition principle|superposition]], where the [[orthogonality|orthogonal]] [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis vectors]] are independent noises. By the proper combination (products or [[Intersection (set theory)|set-theoretical products]]) of basis-noises, which are called ''noise-bit'', a logic hyperspace can be constructed with  {{nowrap|''D''(''N'') {{=}} 2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;}} number of [[dimension]]s, where ''N'' is the number of noise-bits. Thus ''N'' noise-bits in a single wire correspond to a system of {{nowrap| 2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;}} classical bits that can express {{nowrap| 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;}} different logic values. Independent realizations of a stochastic process of zero mean have zero [[cross-correlation]] with each other and with other stochastic processes of zero mean. Thus the basis noise vectors are orthogonal not only to each other but they and all the noise-based logic states (superpositions) are orthogonal also to any background noises in the hardware. Therefore, the noise-based logic concept is robust against background noises, which is a property that can potentially offer a high energy-efficiency.

==The types of signals used in noise-based logic==
In the paper,&lt;ref name =first/&gt; where noise-based logic was first introduced, generic stochastic-processes with zero mean were proposed and a system of orthogonal sinusoidal signals were also proposed as a deterministic-signal version of the logic system. The mathematical analysis about statistical errors and signal energy was limited to the cases of [[Gaussian process|Gaussian noises]] and superpositions as logic signals in the basic logic space and their products and superpositions of their products in the logic hyperspace (see also.&lt;ref name =second/&gt; In the subsequent brain logic scheme,&lt;ref name =third/&gt; the logic signals were (similarly to neural signals) unipolar spike sequences generated by a [[Poisson process]], and set-theoretical unifications (superpositions) and intersections (products) of different spike sequences. Later, in the instantaneous noise-based logic schemes&lt;ref name =fourth/&gt;&lt;ref name =fifth/&gt;  and computation works,&lt;ref name =sixth/&gt; random telegraph waves (periodic time, bipolar, with fixed absolute value of amplitude) were also utilized as one of the simplest stochastic processes available for NBL. With choosing unit amplitude and symmetric probabilities, the resulting random-telegraph wave has 0.5 probability to be in the +1 or in the -1 state which is held over the whole clock period.

==The noise-based logic gates==
Noise-based logic [[Logic gate|gates]] can be classified according to the method the input identifies the logic value at the input. The first gates&lt;ref name =first/&gt;&lt;ref name =second/&gt; analyzed the statistical correlations between the input signal and the reference noises. The advantage of these is the robustness against background noise. The disadvantage is the slow speed and higher hardware complexity. The instantaneous logic gates&lt;ref name =third/&gt;&lt;ref name =fourth/&gt;&lt;ref name =fifth/&gt; are fast, they have low complexity but they are not robust against background noises. With either neural spike type signals or with [[Bipolar signal|bipolar]] random-telegraph waves of unity absolute amplitude, and randomness only in the sign of the amplitude offer very simple instantaneous logic gates. Then linear or analog devices unnecessary and the scheme can operate in the digital domain. However, whenever instantaneous logic must be interfaced with classical logic schemes, the interface must use [[Correlation function|correlator]]-based logic gates for an error-free signal.&lt;ref name =fourth/&gt;

==Universality of noise-based logic==
All the noise-based logic schemes listed above have been proven universal.&lt;ref name =first/&gt;&lt;ref name =fourth/&gt;&lt;ref name =fifth/&gt; The papers typically produce the [[Inverter (logic gate)|NOT]] and the [[AND gate|AND]] gates to prove universality, because having both of them is a satisfactory condition for the universality of a [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean logic]].

==Computation by noise-based logic==
The string verification work&lt;ref name =sixth/&gt; over a slow communication channel shows a powerful computing application where the methods is inherently based on calculating the [[hash function]]. The scheme is based on random telegraph waves and it is mentioned in the paper&lt;ref name =sixth/&gt; that the authors intuitively conclude that the ''[[intelligence]]'' of the brain is using similar operations to make a reasonably good decision based on a limited amount of information. The superposition of the first {{nowrap|''D''(''N'') {{=}} 2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;}} integer numbers can be produced with only 2''N'' operations, which the authors call "Achilles ankle operation" in the paper.&lt;ref name =second/&gt;

==Computer chip realization of noise-based logic==
Preliminary schemes have already been published&lt;ref name="sixth"/&gt; to utilize noise-based logic in practical computers. However, it is obvious from these papers that this young field has yet a long way to go before it will be seen in everyday applications.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2645">'''Non-separable wavelets''' are multi-dimensional [[wavelet]]s that are not directly implemented as [[tensor product]]s of wavelets on some lower-dimensional space.
They have been studied since 1992.&lt;ref&gt;J. Kovacevic and M. Vetterli, "Nonseparable multidimensional perfect reconstruction filter banks and wavelet bases for Rn," IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, vol. 38, no. 2, pp. 533–555, Mar. 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;
They offer a few important advantage.
Notably, using non-separable filters leads to more parameters in design, and consequently better filters.&lt;ref&gt;J. Kovacevic and M. Vetterli, "Nonseparable two- and three-dimensional wavelets," IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, vol. 43, no. 5, pp. 1269–1273, May 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;
The main difference, when compared to the one-dimensional wavelets, is that [[multidimensional sampling|multi-dimensional sampling]] requires the use of [[lattice (group)|lattices]] (e.g., the quincunx lattice).
The wavelet filters themselves can be separable or non-separable regardless of the sampling lattice.
Thus, in some cases, the non-separable wavelets can be implemented in a separable fashion.
Unlike separable wavelet, the non-separable wavelets are capable of detecting structures that are not only horizontal, vertical or diagonal (show less [[anisotropy]]).

For any [[complex number]] written in polar form (such as ''r''[[e (mathematical constant)|e]]&lt;sup&gt;[[imaginary unit|i]]''θ''&lt;/sup&gt;), the '''phase factor''' is the [[complex exponential]] factor (e&lt;sup&gt;i''θ''&lt;/sup&gt;).  As such, the term "phase factor" is related to the more general term [[phasor]], which may have any magnitude (i.e., not necessarily part of the [[circle group]]).  The phase factor is a [[unit complex number]], i.e., of [[absolute value]] [[1 (number)|1]].  It is commonly used in quantum mechanics.  

The variable ''θ'' appearing in such an expression is generally referred to as the [[phase (waves)|phase]].  Multiplying the equation of a [[plane wave]] ''A''e&lt;sup&gt;i('''k·r'''−''ωt'')&lt;/sup&gt; by a phase factor [[phase shift|shifts the phase]] of the wave by ''θ'':
:&lt;math&gt;\text{e}^{i\theta}A\text{e}^{i\left({\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}-\omega t}\right)} = A\text{e}^{i\left({\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}-\omega t + \theta}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;.

In [[quantum mechanics]], a phase factor is a complex coefficient e&lt;sup&gt;i''θ''&lt;/sup&gt; that multiplies a [[Bra-ket notation|ket]] &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; or [[bra–ket notation|bra]] &lt;math&gt;\langle\phi|&lt;/math&gt;. It does not, in itself, have any physical meaning, since the introduction of a phase factor does not change the expectation values of a [[Hermitian operator]].  That is, the values of &lt;math&gt;\langle\phi|A|\phi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\langle\phi|e^{-i\theta} A e^{i\theta}|\phi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; are the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Messiah|1999|p=296}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, ''differences'' in phase factors between two interacting [[quantum state]]s can sometimes be measurable (such as in the [[Berry phase]]) and this can have important consequences.

In [[optics]], the phase factor is an important quantity in the treatment of [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]].

'''MAA Project NExT''' ('''N'''ew '''Ex'''periences in '''T'''eaching) is a program sponsored by the [[Mathematical Association of America]] (MAA) to aid in the professional development of [[mathematician]]s, [[statistician]]s, and [[mathematics education|mathematics educator]]s after they receive their [[PhD]]s. It involves workshops and lectures on [[teaching]], [[academic research]], [[academic scholarship]], and professional activities. The participants in the program are called '''Project NExT Fellows''' or sometimes '''Dots''', and the program also provides ample [[Computer networking|networking]] opportunities for them. Each fellow is also provided with a consultant, who serves as a mentor for them.

== History ==
Project NExT was founded by James (Jim) Leitzel ([[Ohio State University]]) and [[T. Christine Stevens|Chris Stevens]] ([[Saint Louis University]]). The first fellows were selected in 1994. Jim Leitzel died in 1998, and [[Aparna Higgins]] ([[University of Dayton]]) and Joe Gallian ([[University of Minnesota Duluth]]) became co-directors of Project NExT. Chris Stevens stepped down as director in 2010, and was succeeded by Aparna Higgins. Judith Covington ([[Louisiana State University]], Shreveport) and Gavin LaRose ([[University of Michigan]]) first served as Associate Co-Directors and later became Co-Directors. In 2007, the total number of fellows surpassed 1000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.math.utk.edu/projnext/views.html Views of Project NExT] Mathematical Association of America (accessed Sep 13, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; David Kung ([[St. Mary's College of Maryland]]) currently serves as Director of the program, with Associate Directors Julie Barnes ([[Western Carolina University]]), [[Alissa Crans]] ([[Loyola Marymount University]]), and Matt DeLong ([[Marian University (Indiana)|Marian University]]). &lt;ref name="Index"&gt;[https://www.maa.org/programs/faculty-and-departments/project-next Project NExT] Mathematical Association of America (accessed Dec. 6, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2017 the total number of fellows reached 1700.

== Selection of fellows ==
The program is aimed at faculty who are in the early stages of their higher ed teaching career, in a mathematics (or closely related) department, after receiving their doctorate. Fellows are selected based on an application, including a short [[curriculum vitae]], a [[research statement]], and a [[teaching statement]] expressing interest in the program. The application also requires a letter from the applicant's department chair guaranteeing funding to attend several conferences. The number of selected fellows depends on funding. Currently, just under 100 are selected each year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.maa.org/programs/faculty-and-departments/project-next MAA Project NExT] Mathematical Association of America (accessed Dec 6, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

== The program ==
Project NExT is a professional development program for college-level faculty interested in teaching. The program provides workshops and an electronic mailing list for its members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sections.maa.org/pnw/history/newsletters/2003-1/next.htm Matters Mathematical]: The Newsletter of the Pacific Northwest Section, Mathematical Association of America. Spring 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Fellows participate in [[MathFest]] during the year of their selection and the year after, and in the [[Joint Mathematics Meeting]] in the January after their selection as fellows. Each fellow is also assigned a consultant outside of their own institution. NExT fellows organize several sessions at the Joint Meeting and MathFest, on topics of their choosing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.math.utk.edu/projnext/background.html Project NExT: New Jobs, New Responsibilities, New Ideas] Mathematical Association of America (accessed Sep 13, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2016, all MAA Project NExT events at the [[Joint Mathematics Meetings]] have been open to all conference attendees.

== Affiliation with other professional development organizations ==
The national Project NExT program is strongly affiliated with ''Section NExT'' programs, which are run by local sections of the [[Mathematical Association of America|MAA]], and involve many of the same activities. Section NExT fellows can also participate in the national workshops.&lt;ref name="Index"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~glarose/pnext/sections/ Project NExT in the MAA Sections] Mathematical Association of America (accessed Sep 13, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Project NExT is also strongly associated with the [[Young Mathematicians Network]].

== Dot colors ==
Every year a group of fellows is selected, the cohort is assigned a color, and thereafter wears a sticker (or ''dot'') of that color to national mathematics meetings of the MAA. There are seven colors for the stickers, so cohort seven years apart have the same color sticker, although they are assigned a different name. Colors are frequently chosen according to the location of [[MathFest]] in the year of selection (for example, the [[peach]] dots first meeting was in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and the [[Brown]] dots first meeting was at [[Brown University]]). The colors since inception of the program are listed in the following table:

Porph. ''V.P.'' 9) that he left Samos to escape the tyranny of Polycrates at the age of forty, we may put his birth round about 570 BC, or a few years earlier. The length of his life was variously estimated in antiquity, but it is agreed that he lived to a fairly ripe old age, and most probably he died at about seventy-five or eighty." [[William Keith Chambers Guthrie]], (1978), ''A history of Greek philosophy, Volume 1: The earlier Presocratics and the Pythagoreans'', p. 173. Cambridge University Press}} was an [[Ionians|Ionian]] [[Ancient Greeks|Greek]] [[Greek philosophy|philosopher]] and the eponymous founder of the [[Pythagoreanism]] movement.&lt;!-- Please do NOT add "mathematician". Despite the famous theorem that now bears his name, scholars dispute whether the historical Pythagoras was involved in mathematics at all. Please read the rest of the lead and the "Attributed discoveries" section for further information. Thank you. --&gt; His political and religious teachings were well known in [[Magna Graecia]] and influenced the philosophies of [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and, through them, [[Western philosophy]]. Knowledge of his life is clouded by legend, but he appears to have been the son of Mnesarchus, a [[Seal carving|seal engraver]] on the island of [[Samos]]. Modern scholars disagree regarding Pythagoras's education and influences, but they do agree that, around 530 BC, he travelled to [[Crotone|Croton]], where he founded a school in which initiates were sworn to secrecy and lived a [[Communalism|communal]], [[asceticism|ascetic]] lifestyle. This lifestyle entailed a number of dietary prohibitions, traditionally said to have included [[vegetarianism]], although modern scholars doubt that he ever advocated for complete vegetarianism.

The teaching most securely identified with Pythagoras is ''[[metempsychosis]]'', or the "transmigration of souls", which holds that every [[soul]] is [[immortality|immortal]] and, upon death, [[reincarnation|enters into a new body]]. He may have also devised the doctrine of ''[[musica universalis]]'', which holds that the [[Classical planet|planets]] move according to [[mathematics|mathematical]] [[equation]]s and thus resonate to produce an inaudible [[symphony]] of music. Scholars debate whether Pythagoras developed the [[Numerology|numerological]] and musical teachings attributed to him, or if those teachings were developed by his later followers, particularly [[Philolaus|Philolaus of Croton]]. Following Croton's decisive victory over [[Sybaris]] in around 510 BC, Pythagoras's followers came into conflict with supporters of [[Greek democracy|democracy]] and Pythagorean meeting houses were burned. Pythagoras may have been killed during this persecution, or escaped to [[Metapontum]], where he eventually died.

In antiquity, Pythagoras was credited with many mathematical and scientific discoveries, including the [[Pythagorean theorem]], [[Pythagorean tuning]], the [[Platonic solids|five regular solids]], the [[Proportionality (mathematics)|Theory of Proportions]], the [[Spherical Earth|sphericity of the Earth]], and the identity of the [[Phosphorus (morning star)|morning]] and [[Hesperus|evening stars]] as the planet [[Venus]]. It was said that he was the first man to call himself a philosopher ("lover of wisdom"){{efn|[[Cicero]], ''[[Tusculan Disputations]]'', 5.3.8–9 (citing [[Heraclides Ponticus]] fr. 88 Wehrli), [[Diogenes Laërtius]] 1.12, 8.8, [[Iamblichus]] ''VP'' 58. Burkert attempted to discredit this ancient tradition, but it has been defended by C.J. De Vogel, ''Pythagoras and Early Pythagoreanism'' (1966), pp. 97–102, and C. Riedweg, ''Pythagoras: His Life, Teaching, And Influence'' (2005), p. 92.}} and that he was the first to divide the globe into [[Geographical zone|five climatic zones]]. Classical historians debate whether Pythagoras made these discoveries, and many of the accomplishments credited to him likely originated earlier or were made by his colleagues or successors. Some accounts mention that the philosophy associated with Pythagoras was related to mathematics and that numbers were important, but it is debated to what extent, if at all, he actually contributed to mathematics or [[natural philosophy]].

Pythagoras influenced Plato, whose [[Socratic dialogue|dialogues]], especially his ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', exhibit Pythagorean teachings. Pythagorean ideas on mathematical perfection also impacted [[ancient Greek art]]. His teachings underwent a major revival in the first century BC among [[Middle Platonism|Middle Platonists]], coinciding with the rise of [[Neopythagoreanism]]. Pythagoras continued to be regarded as a great philosopher throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and his philosophy had a major impact on scientists such as [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], [[Johannes Kepler]], and [[Isaac Newton]]. Pythagorean symbolism was used throughout early modern [[Western esotericism|European esotericism]] and his teachings as portrayed in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' influenced the modern vegetarian movement.

The Greek poets [[Ion of Chios]] ({{circa|480|421&amp;nbsp;BC|lk=on}}) and [[Empedocles of Acragas]] ({{circa|493|432&amp;nbsp;BC}}) both express admiration for Pythagoras in their poems.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=14–15}} The first concise description of Pythagoras comes from the historian [[Herodotus of Halicarnassus]] ({{circa|484|420&amp;nbsp;BC|lk=no}}),{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=16}} who describes him as "not the most insignificant" of Greek sages&lt;ref&gt;4. 95. &lt;/ref&gt; and states that Pythagoras taught his followers how to attain [[immortality]].{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=16}} The writings attributed to the Pythagorean philosopher [[Philolaus|Philolaus of Croton]], who lived in the late fifth century BC, are the earliest texts to describe the numerological and musical theories that were later ascribed to Pythagoras.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=88}} The [[Ancient Athens|Athenian]] [[rhetoric]]ian [[Isocrates]] (436–338 BC) was the first to describe Pythagoras as having visited Egypt.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=16}} [[Aristotle]] wrote a treatise ''On the Pythagoreans'', which is no longer extant.&lt;ref&gt;He alludes to it himself, ''Met.'' i. 5. p. 986. 12, ed. Bekker.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of it may be preserved in the ''[[Protrepticus (Aristotle)|Protrepticus]]''. Aristotle's disciples [[Dicaearchus]], [[Aristoxenus]], and [[Heraclides Ponticus]] also wrote on the same subject.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=109}}

Most of the major sources on Pythagoras's life are from the [[Ancient Greece#Roman Greece|Roman period]],{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}} by which point, according to the German classicist [[Walter Burkert]], "the history of Pythagoreanism was already... the laborious reconstruction of something lost and gone."{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=109}} Three [[Biography#Historical biography|lives]] of Pythagoras have survived from late antiquity,{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}}{{sfn|Copleston|2003|page=29}} all of which are filled primarily with myths and legends.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}}{{sfn|Zhmud|2012|page=9}}{{sfn|Copleston|2003|page=29}} The earliest and most respectable of these is the one from [[Diogenes Laërtius]]'s ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]''.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}}{{sfn|Zhmud|2012|page=9}} The two later lives were written by the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonist]] philosophers [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] and [[Iamblichus]]{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}}{{sfn|Zhmud|2012|page=9}} and were partially intended as polemics against the [[rise of Christianity]].{{sfn|Zhmud|2012|page=9}} The later sources are much lengthier than the earlier ones,{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}} and even more fantastic in their descriptions of Pythagoras's achievements.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}}{{sfn|Zhmud|2012|page=9}} Porphyry and Iamblichus used material from the lost writings of Aristotle's disciples{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=109}} and material taken from these sources is generally considered to be the most reliable.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=109}}

During Pythagoras's formative years, Samos was a thriving cultural hub known for its feats of advanced architectural engineering, including the building of the [[Tunnel of Eupalinos]], and for its riotous festival culture.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=45–47}} It was a major center of trade in the Aegean where traders brought goods from the [[Near East]].{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=11}} According to Christiane L.

===Alleged travels===

Pythagoras is traditionally thought to have received most of his education in the Near East.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=7}} Modern scholarship has shown that the culture of [[Archaic Greece]] was heavily influenced by those of Near Eastern cultures.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=7}} Like many other important Greek thinkers, Pythagoras was said to have studied in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=7–8}}{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=16}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=22–23}} By the time of Isocrates in the fourth century BC, Pythagoras's alleged studies in Egypt were already taken as fact.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=59}}{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=16}} The writer [[Antiphon (writer)|Antiphon]], who may have lived during the Hellenistic Era, claimed in his lost work ''On Men of Outstanding Merit'', used as a source by Porphyry, that Pythagoras learned to speak [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] from the [[Pharaoh]] [[Amasis II]] himself, that he studied with the Egyptian priests at [[Thebes, Egypt|Diospolis]] (Thebes), and that he was the only foreigner ever to be granted the privilege of taking part in their worship.&lt;ref name="Porphyry6"&gt;Porphyry, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 6.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=7}} The [[Middle Platonist]] biographer [[Plutarch]] ({{circa|46|120&amp;nbsp;AD|lk=on}}) writes in his treatise ''[[Moralia|On Isis and Osiris]]'' that, during his visit to Egypt, Pythagoras received instruction from the Egyptian priest Oenuphis of [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] (meanwhile [[Solon]] received lectures from a [[Sonchis of Sais]]).&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Isis_and_Osiris*/A.html On Isis And Osiris]'', ch. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Christian theologian]] [[Clement of Alexandria]] ({{circa|150|215&amp;nbsp;AD|lk=no}}), "Pythagoras was a disciple of Soches, an Egyptian archprophet, as well as [[Plato]] of Sechnuphis of [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]]."{{sfn|Press|2003|page=83}} Some ancient writers claimed, that Pythagoras learned geometry and the doctrine of metempsychosis from the Egyptians.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=7–8}}&lt;ref&gt;cf. Antiphon. ap. Porphyry, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 7; Isocrates, ''Busiris'', 28–9; Cicero, ''de Finibus'', v. 27; Strabo, xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other ancient writers, however, claimed that Pythagoras had learned these teachings from the [[Magi]] in [[Persia]] or even from [[Zoroaster]] himself.&lt;ref name="DiogenesLaërtiusviii.1,3"&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 1, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} Diogenes Laërtius asserts that Pythagoras later visited [[Crete]], where he went to the [[Mount Ida|Cave of Ida]] with [[Epimenides]].&lt;ref name="DiogenesLaërtiusviii.1,3"/&gt; The [[Phoenicia]]ns are reputed to have taught Pythagoras [[arithmetic]] and the [[Chaldea]]ns to have taught him astronomy.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} By the third century BC, Pythagoras was already reported to have studied under the [[Jews]] as well.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} Contradicting all these reports, the novelist [[Antonius Diogenes]], writing in the second century BC, reports that Pythagoras discovered all his doctrines himself by [[Dream interpretation|interpreting dreams]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} The third-century AD [[Sophist]] [[Philostratus]] claims that, in addition to the Egyptians, Pythagoras also studied under [[Hinduism|Hindu]] sages in [[India]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} Iamblichus expands this list even further by claiming that Pythagoras also studied with the [[Celts]] and [[Iberians]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}}

Ancient sources also record Pythagoras having studied under a variety of native Greek thinkers.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} Some identify [[:fr:Hermodamas|Hermodamas of Samos]] as a possible tutor.&lt;ref&gt;Porphyry, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 2, Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} Hermodamas represented the indigenous Samian rhapsodic tradition and his father Creophylos was said to have been the host of rival of the poet [[Homer]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} Others credit [[Bias of Priene]], Thales,&lt;ref name="Iamblichus, Vit.

Pyth.'' 2.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} Other traditions claim the mythic bard [[Orpheus]] as Pythagoras's teacher, thus representing the [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic Mysteries]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} The Neoplatonists wrote of a "sacred discourse" Pythagoras had written on the gods in the [[Doric Greek]] dialect, which they believed had been dictated to Pythagoras by the Orphic priest Aglaophamus upon his initiation to the orphic Mysteries at [[Leibethra]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} Iamblichus credited Orpheus with having been the model for Pythagoras's manner of speech, his spiritual attitude, and his manner of worship.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=8–9}} Iamblichus describes Pythagoreanism as a synthesis of everything Pythagoras had learned from Orpheus, from the Egyptian priests, from the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]], and from other religious and philosophical traditions.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=8–9}} Riedweg states that, although these stories are fanciful, Pythagoras's teachings were definitely influenced by Orphism to a noteworthy extent.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=9}}

Of the various Greek sages claimed to have taught Pythagoras, [[Pherecydes of Syros]] is mentioned most often.&lt;ref&gt;Aristoxenus and others in Diogenes Laërtius, i. 118, 119; Cicero, ''de Div.'' i. 49&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=9}} Similar miracle stories were told about both Pythagoras and Pherecydes, including one in which the hero predicts a shipwreck, one in which he predicts the conquest of a city, and one in which he drinks from a well and predicts a shipwreck.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=9}} [[Apollonius Paradoxographus]], a paradoxographer who may have lived in the second century BC, identified Pythagoras's [[Thaumaturgy|thaumaturgic]] ideas as a result of Pherecydes's influence.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=9}} Another story, which may be traced to the Neopythagorean philosopher [[Nicomachus]], tells that, when Pherecydes was old and dying on the island of [[Delos]], Pythagoras returned to care for him and pay his respects.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=9}} [[Duris of Samos|Duris]], the historian and tyrant of Samos, is reported to have patriotically boasted of an epitaph supposedly penned by Pherecydes which declared that Pythagoras's wisdom exceeded his own.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=9}} On the grounds of all these references connecting Pythagoras with Pherecydes, Riedweg concludes that there may well be some historical foundation to the tradition that Pherecydes was Pythagoras's teacher.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=9}} Pythagoras and Pherecydes also appear to have shared similar views on the soul and the teaching of metempsychosis.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=9}}

Before 520 BC, on one of his visits to Egypt or Greece, Pythagoras might have met [[Thales of Miletus]], who would have been around fifty-four years older than him.

Pythagoras's birthplace, the island of [[Samos]], is situated in the Northeast [[Aegean Sea]] not far from [[Miletus]].{{sfn|Zhmud|2012|pages=2, 16}} Diogenes Laërtius cites a statement from [[Aristoxenus]] (fourth century BC) stating that Pythagoras learned most of his [[moral]] doctrines from the [[Pythia|Delphic priestess]] [[Themistoclea]].&lt;ref name="Laertiusviii18"&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0258:book=8:chapter=1&amp;highlight=themistoclea ''Lives of Eminent Philosophers''], viii. 1, 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=""Ellen Waithe"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=x7ngECDpxmMC&amp;printsec=frontcover Mary Ellen Waithe, ''Ancient women philosophers, 600 B.C.–500 A.D.'', p. 11]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Malone2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=Malone |first=John C. |title=Psychology: Pythagoras to present |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e6Qa6cMQj8AC&amp;pg=PA22 |accessdate=25 October 2010 |date=30 June 2009 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-01296-6 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Porphyry agrees with this assertion,&lt;ref&gt;Porphyry, [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/porphyry_life_of_pythagoras_02_text.htm ''Life of Pythagoras''], 41.&lt;/ref&gt; but calls the priestess Aristoclea (''Aristokleia'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Gilles Ménage]]: ''The history of women philosophers''.

Porphyry repeats an account from [[Antiphon]], who reported that, while he was still on Samos, Pythagoras founded a school known as the "semicircle".{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=10}}{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=64}} Here, Samians debated matters of public concern.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=10}}{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=64}} Supposedly, the school became so renowned that the brightest minds in all of Greece came to Samos to hear Pythagoras teach.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=10}} Pythagoras himself dwelled in a secret cave, where he studied in private and occasionally held discourses with a few of his close friends.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=10}}{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=64}} Christoph Riedweg, a German scholar of early Pythagoreanism, states that it is entirely possible Pythagoras may have taught on Samos,{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=10}} but cautions that Antiphon's account, which makes reference to a specific building that was still in use during his own time, appears to be motivated by Samian patriotic interest.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=10}}

Around 530 BC, when Pythagoras was around forty years old, he left Samos.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=6}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=11}}{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=11}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=5}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=22}} His later admirers claimed that he left because he disagreed with the [[Tyrant#Historical forms|tyranny]] of [[Polycrates]] in Samos,&lt;ref name=Boyer /&gt;{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=11}} Riedweg notes that this explanation closely aligns with Nicomachus's emphasis on Pythagoras's purported love of freedom, but that Pythagoras's enemies portrayed him as having a proclivity towards tyranny.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=11}} Other accounts claim that Pythagoras left Samos because he was so overburdened with public duties in Samos, because of the high estimation in which he was held by his fellow-citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Iamblichus, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 28; Porphyry, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 9&lt;/ref&gt; He arrived in the Greek colony of Croton (today's [[Crotone]], in [[Calabria]]) in what was then [[Magna Graecia]].&lt;ref&gt;Cornelia J. de Vogel: ''Pythagoras and Early Pythagoreanism.''

Diogenes Laërtius states that Pythagoras "did not indulge in the pleasures of love"{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=58}} and that he cautioned others to only have sex "whenever you are willing to be weaker than yourself".{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} According to Porphyry, Pythagoras married [[Theano (philosopher)|Theano]], a lady of [[Crete]] and the daughter of Pythenax{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} and had several children with her.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} Porphyry writes that Pythagoras had two sons named [[Telauges]] and [[Arignote]],{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} and a daughter named Myia,{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} who "took precedence among the maidens in Croton and, when a wife, among married women."{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} Iamblichus mentions none of these children{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} and instead only mentions a son named Mnesarchus after his grandfather.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} This son was raised by Pythagoras's appointed successor Aristaeus and eventually took over the school when Aristaeus was too old to continue running it.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}}

The wrestler [[Milo of Croton]] was said to have been a close associate of Pythagoras{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=5–6, 59, 73}} and was credited with having saved the philosopher's life when a roof was about to collapse.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=5–6, 59, 73}} This association may been the result of confusion with a different man named Pythagoras, who was an athletics trainer.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=10}} Diogenes Laërtius records Milo's wife's name as Myia.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} Iamblichus mentions Theano as the wife of Brontinus of Croton.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} Diogenes Laërtius states that the same Theano was Pythagoras's pupil{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} and that Pythagoras's wife Theano was her daughter.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} Diogenes Laërtius also records that works supposedly written by Theano were still extant during his own lifetime{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} and quotes several opinions attributed to her.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} These writings are now known to be [[pseudepigraphica]]l.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}}

===Death===
Pythagoras's emphasis on dedication and asceticism are credited with aiding in Croton's decisive victory over the neighboring colony of [[Sybaris]] in 510 BC.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=6–7}} After the victory, some prominent citizens of Croton proposed a [[Greek democracy|democratic constitution]], which the Pythagoreans rejected.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=6–7}} The supporters of democracy, headed by [[Cylon of Croton|Cylon]] and [[Ninon of Croton|Ninon]], the former of whom is said to have been irritated by his exclusion from Pythagoras's brotherhood, roused the populace against them.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=19}} Followers of Cylon and Ninon attacked the Pythagoreans during one of their meetings, either in the house of Milo or in some other meeting-place.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=7}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=19–20}} Accounts of the attack are often contradictory and many probably confused it with later anti-Pythagorean rebellions.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=19}} The building was apparently set on fire,{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=7}} and many of the assembled members perished;{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=7}} only the younger and more active members managed to escape.&lt;ref&gt;Iamblichus, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 255–259; Porphyry, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 54–57; Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 39; comp. Plutarch, ''de Gen. Socr.'' p. 583&lt;/ref&gt;

Sources disagree regarding whether Pythagoras was present when the attack occurred and, if he was, whether or not he managed to escape.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=106}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=19–20}} In some accounts, Pythagoras was not at the meeting when the Pythagoreans were attacked because he was on Delos tending to the dying Pherecydes.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=19–20}} According to another account from Dicaearchus, Pythagoras was at the meeting and managed to escape,{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=20}} leading a small group of followers to the nearby city of [[Locris]], where they pleaded for sanctuary, but were denied.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=20}} They reached the city of [[Metapontum]], where they took shelter in the temple of the [[Muses]] and died there of starvation after forty days without food.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=20}}{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=106}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=7}}{{sfn|Grant|1989|page=278}} Another tale recorded by Porphyry claims that, as Pythagoras's enemies were burning the house, his devoted students laid down on the ground to make a path for him to escape by walking over their bodies across the flames like a bridge.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=20}} Pythagoras managed to escape, but was so despondent at the deaths of his beloved students that he committed suicide.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=20}} A different legend reported by both Diogenes Laërtius and Iamblichus states that Pythagoras almost managed to escape, but that he came to a bean field and refused to run through it, since doing so would violate his teachings, so he stopped instead and was killed.{{sfn|Simoons|1998|pages=225–228}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=20}} This story seems to have originated from the writer Neanthes, who told it about later Pythagoreans, not about Pythagoras himself.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=20}}

==Teachings==
===Metempsychosis===
[[File:Cropped image of Pythagoras from Raphael's School of Athens.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|alt=Scene from Raphael's School of Athens showing Pythagoras as a balding, bearded man writing in a book with a quill. He is dressed in a long-sleeved tunic with a cloak spread across his legs as he kneels to write, using his left thigh to support the book. In front of him, a boy with long hair presents him with a chalk board showing a diagrammatic representation of a lyre above the symbol of the tetractys. Averroes, shown as a stereotypical Middle Easterner with a mustache and wearing a turban, peers over his left shoulder while another bearded, balding philosopher in classical garb, probably Anaxagoras, peers over his right shoulder, taking notes into a much smaller notepad.

Although the exact details of Pythagoras's teachings are uncertain,{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=106–109}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=5–6}} it is possible to reconstruct a general outline of his main ideas.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=106–109}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=9–11}} Aristotle writes at length about the teachings of the Pythagoreans,{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=29–30}}{{sfn|Copleston|2003|page=31}} but without mentioning Pythagoras directly.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=29–30}}{{sfn|Copleston|2003|page=31}} One of Pythagoras's main doctrines appears to have been ''[[metempsychosis]]'',{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=11}}{{sfn|Zhmud|2012|page=232}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=5}}{{sfn|Burkert|1985|pages=300–301}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=24–25}}{{sfn|Copleston|2003|pages=30–31}} the belief that all [[soul]]s are immortal and that, after death, a soul is transferred into a new body.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=11}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=24–25}} This teaching is referenced by Xenophanes, Ion of Chios, and Herodotus.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 36, comp. Aristotle, ''de Anima'', i. 3; Herodotus, ii. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=11}} Nothing whatsoever, however, is known about the nature or mechanism by which Pythagoras believed metempsychosis to occur.{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=25}}

[[Empedocles]] alludes in one of his poems that Pythagoras may have claimed to possess the ability to recall his former incarnations.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=12}} Diogenes Laërtius reports an account from [[Heraclides Ponticus]] that Pythagoras told people that he had lived four previous lives that he could remember in detail.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|pages=164–167}}&lt;ref&gt;Porphyry, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 26; Pausanias, ii. 17; Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 5; Horace, ''Od.'' i. 28,1. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these lives was as [[Aethalides]] the son of [[Hermes]], who granted him the ability to remember all his past incarnations.{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|pages=164–165}} Next, he was incarnated as [[Euphorbus]], a minor hero from the [[Trojan War]] briefly mentioned in the ''[[Iliad]]''.{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|pages=165–166}} He then became the philosopher [[Hermotimus of Clazomenae|Hermotimus]],{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=167}} who recognized the shield of Euphorbus in the temple of Apollo.{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=167}} His final incarnation was as Pyrrhus, a fisherman from [[Delos]].{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=167}} One of his past lives, as reported by [[Dicaearchus]], was as a beautiful courtesan.&lt;ref&gt;Aulus Gellius, iv. 11&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Zhmud|2012|page=232}}

===Mysticism===
Another belief attributed to Pythagoras was that of the "[[Musica universalis|harmony of the spheres]]",{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=29–30}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=38–39}} which maintained that the planets and stars move according to mathematical equations, which correspond to musical notes and thus produce an inaudible symphony.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=29–30}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=38–39}} According to Porphyry, Pythagoras taught that the seven [[Muse]]s were actually the [[Classical planet|seven planets]] singing together.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=30}} In his philosophical dialogue [[Protrepticus (Aristotle)|''Protrepticus'']], [[Aristotle]] has his literary double say:

{{quote|When Pythagoras was asked [why humans exist], he said, "to observe the heavens," and he used to claim that he himself was an observer of nature, and it was for the sake of this that he had passed over into life.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonJohnson&gt;{{cite web|author1=D.

Pythagoras was said to have practiced [[divination]] and [[prophecy]].&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''de Divin.'' i. 3, 46; Porphyry, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 29.&lt;/ref&gt; In the visits to various places in Greece—[[Delos]], [[Sparta]], [[Phlius]], [[Crete]], etc.—which are ascribed to him, he usually appears either in his religious or priestly guise, or else as a lawgiver.&lt;ref&gt;Iamblichus, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 25; Porphyry, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 17; Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 3, 13; Cicero, ''Tusc. Qu.'' v. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Aristotle, the Pythagoreans used mathematics for solely mystical reasons, devoid of practical application.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=467–468}} They believed that all things were made of numbers.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=265}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=27}} The number one (the [[Monad (philosophy)|monad]]) represented the origin of all things{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=23}} and the number two (the [[Dyad (Greek philosophy)|dyad]]) represented matter.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=23}} The number three was an "ideal number" because it had a beginning, middle, and end{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=170–172}} and was the smallest number of points that could be used to define a plane triangle, which they revered as a symbol of the god [[Apollo]].{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=170–172}} The number four signified the [[Seasons|four seasons]] and the [[Classical element|four elements]].{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=172}} The number seven was also sacred because it was the number of planets and the number of strings on a lyre,{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=172}} and because Apollo's birthday was celebrated on the seventh day of each month.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=172}} They believed that [[Parity (mathematics)|odd numbers]] were [[masculine]],{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=433}} that even numbers were [[feminine]],{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=433}} and that the number five represented marriage, because it was the sum of two and three.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=467}}{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=170}}

Ten was regarded as the "perfect number"{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=467–468}} and the Pythagoreans honored it by never gathering in groups larger than ten.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=161}} Pythagoras was credited with devising the [[tetractys]], the triangular figure of four rows which add up to the perfect number, ten.{{sfn|Bruhn|2005|pages=65–66}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=28–29}} The Pythagoreans regarded the tetractys as a symbol of utmost mystical importance.{{sfn|Bruhn|2005|pages=65–66}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=29}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=28–29}} Iamblichus, in his ''Life of Pythagoras'', states that the tetractys was "so admirable, and so divinised by those who understood [it]," that Pythagoras's students would swear oaths by it.&lt;ref&gt;Iamblichus, ''Vit. Pyth.'', 29&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Bruhn|2005|page=66}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=29}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=28–29}} Andrew Gregory concludes that the tradition linking Pythagoras to the tetractys is probably genuine.{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=28}}

Modern scholars debate whether these numerological teachings were developed by Pythagoras himself or by the later Pythagorean philosopher [[Philolaus of Croton]].{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=87–88}} In his landmark study ''Lore and Science in Ancient Pythagoreanism'', Walter Burkert argues that Pythagoras was a charismatic political and religious teacher,{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=2–3}} but that the number philosophy attributed to him was really an innovation by Philolaus.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=3}} According to Burkert, Pythagoras never dealt with numbers at all, let alone made any noteworthy contribution to mathematics.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=2–3}} Burkert argues that the only mathematics the Pythagoreans ever actually engaged in was simple, [[Mathematical proof|proofless]] [[arithmetic]],{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=428–433}} but that these arithmetic discoveries did contribute significantly to the beginnings of mathematics.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=465}}

Both [[Plato]] and [[Isocrates]] state that, above all else, Pythagoras was known as the founder of a new way of life.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Republic'', 600a, Isocrates, ''Busiris'', 28&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=168}}{{sfn|Grant|1989|page=277}} The organization Pythagoras founded at Croton was called a "school",&lt;ref&gt;Porphyry, ''Vit.

Two groups existed within early Pythagoreanism: the ''mathematikoi'' ("learners") and the ''akousmatikoi'' ("listeners").{{sfn|Zhmud|2012|pages=2, 16}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=31}} The ''akousmatikoi'' are traditionally identified by scholars as "old believers" in mysticism, numerology, and religious teachings;{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=31}} whereas the ''mathematikoi'' are traditionally identified as a more intellectual, modernist faction who were more rationalist and scientific.{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=31}} Gregory cautions that there was probably not a sharp distinction between them and that many Pythagoreans probably believed the two approaches were compatible.{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=31}} The study of mathematics and music may have been connected to the worship of Apollo.&lt;ref&gt;Aelian, ''Varia Historia'', ii. 26; Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 13; Iamblichus, ''Vit.

Pythagorean teachings were known as "symbols" (''symbolon''){{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=8}} and members took a vow of silence that they would not reveal these symbols to non-members.&lt;ref&gt;Scholion ad Aristophanes, ''Nub.'' 611; Iamblichus, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 237, 238&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=8}}{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=168}} Those who did not obey the laws of the community were expelled{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=69}} and the remaining members would erect [[tombstone]]s for them as though they had died.{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=69}} A number of "oral sayings" (''akoúsmata'') attributed to Pythagoras have survived,{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=64–67}}{{sfn|Copleston|2003|page=31}} dealing with how members of the Pythagorean community should perform sacrifices, how they should honor the gods, how they should "move from here", and how they should be buried.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=64}} Many of these sayings emphasize the importance of ritual purity and avoiding defilement.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=65}}{{sfn|Copleston|2003|pages=30–31}} For instance, a saying which Leonid Zhmud concludes can probably be genuinely traced back to Pythagoras himself forbids his followers from wearing woolen garments.{{sfn|Zhmud|2012|page=200}} Other extant oral sayings forbid Pythagoreans from breaking bread, poking fires with swords, or picking up crumbs{{sfn|Kenny|2004|page=10}} and teach that a person should always put the right sandal on before the left.{{sfn|Kenny|2004|page=10}} The exact meanings of these sayings, however, are frequently obscure.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=65–67}} Iamblichus preserves Aristotle's descriptions of the original, ritualistic intentions behind a few of these sayings,{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=65–66}} but these apparently later fell out of fashion, because Porphyry provides markedly different ethical-philosophical interpretations of them:{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=66–67}}

New initiates were allegedly not permitted to meet Pythagoras until after they had completed a five-year initiation period,{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=64}} during which they were required to remain silent.{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=64}} Sources indicate that Pythagoras himself was unusually progressive in his attitudes towards women{{sfn|Pomeroy|2013|page=xvi}} and female members of Pythagoras's school appear to have played an active role in its operations.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=8}}{{sfn|Pomeroy|2013|page=xvi}} Iamblichus provides a list of 235 famous Pythagoreans,{{sfn|Pomeroy|2013|page=1}} seventeen of whom are women.{{sfn|Pomeroy|2013|page=1}} In later times, many prominent female philosophers contributed to the development of [[Neopythagoreanism]].{{sfn|Pomeroy|2013|pages=xvi–xvii}}

Pythagoreanism also entailed a number of dietary prohibitions.{{sfn|Copleston|2003|pages=30–31}}{{sfn|Kenny|2004|page=10}}&lt;ref&gt;comp. Porphyry, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 32; Iamblichus, ''Vit.

==Legends==
[[File:'Pythagoras Emerging from the Underworld', oil on canvas painting by Salvator Rosa.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|alt=Oil painting showing, at the far left, a cloaked and hooded Pythagoras emerging from a cave in the woods as a large crowd of adoring followers wait outside to greet him.|''Pythagoras Emerging from the Underworld'' (1662) by [[Salvator Rosa]]]]

Within his own lifetime, Pythagoras was already the subject of elaborate [[hagiography|hagiographic]] legends.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=1}} Aristotle described Pythagoras as a wonder-worker and somewhat of a supernatural figure.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=2}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=30–31}} In a fragment, Aristotle writes that Pythagoras had a golden thigh,{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=2}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=30}}{{sfn|Kenny|2004|page=11}} which he publicly exhibited at the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]]{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=2}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=60}} and showed to [[Abaris the Hyperborean]] as proof of his identity as the "Hyperborean Apollo".{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=2}}&lt;ref&gt;Porphyry, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 20; Iamblichus, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 31, 140; Aelian, ''Varia Historia'', ii. 26; Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Supposedly, the priest of Apollo gave Pythagoras a magic arrow, which he used to fly over long distances and perform ritual purifications.{{sfn|McKeown|2013|page=155}} He was supposedly once seen at both Metapontum and Croton [[bilocation|at the same time]].&lt;ref&gt;Comp. Herodian, iv. 94, etc.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=60}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=30}}{{sfn|Kenny|2004|page=11}} When Pythagoras crossed the river Kosas (the modern-day [[Basento]]), "several witnesses" reported that they heard it greet him by name.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=144}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=60}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=30}} In Roman times, a legend claimed that Pythagoras was the son of Apollo.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=10}}{{sfn|Kenny|2004|page=11}} According to [[Hermes Trismegistus#In Islamic tradition|Muslim tradition]], Pythagoras was said to have been initiated by [[Hermes Trismegistus|Hermes]] (Egyptian [[Thoth]]).&lt;ref&gt;See Antoine Faivre, in ''The Eternal Hermes'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

Pythagoras was said to have dressed all in white.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=2}}{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=47}} He is also said to have borne a golden [[wreath]] atop his head{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=2}} and to have worn [[trousers]] after the fashion of the [[Thrace|Thracians]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=2}} Diogenes Laërtius presents Pythagoras as having exercised remarkable [[self-control]];{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=58–59}} he was always cheerful,{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=58–59}} but "abstained wholly from laughter, and from all such indulgences as jests and idle stories".{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} Pythagoras was said to have had extraordinary success in dealing with animals.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}}{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=160}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=60}} A fragment from Aristotle records that, when a deadly snake bit Pythagoras, he bit it back and killed it.{{sfn|McKeown|2013|page=155}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=60}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=30}} Both Porphyry and Iamblichus report that Pythagoras once persuaded a bull not to eat beans{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}}{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=160}} and that he once convinced a notoriously destructive bear to swear that it would never harm a living thing again, and that the bear kept its word.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}}{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=160}}

Riedweg suggests that Pythagoras may have personally encouraged these legends,{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=1}} but Gregory states that there is no direct evidence of this.{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=31}} Anti-Pythagorean legends were also circulated.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=60–61}} Diogenes Laërtes retells a story told by Hermippus of Samos, which states that Pythagoras had once gone into an underground room, telling everyone that he was descending to the underworld.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=61}} He stayed in this room for months, while his mother secretly recorded everything that happened during his absence.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=61}} After he returned from this room, Pythagoras recounted everything that had happened while he was gone,{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=61}} convincing everyone that he had really been in the underworld{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=61}} and leading them to trust him with their wives.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=61}}

===In mathematics===
[[File:Pythagorean.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|alt=Diagram illustrating the Pythagorean theorem|'''The Pythagorean theorem''': The sum of the areas of the two squares on the legs (''a'' and ''b'') equals the area of the square on the hypotenuse (''c'').]]

Although Pythagoras is most famous today for his alleged mathematical discoveries,{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=1–2}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=21–22}} classical historians dispute whether he himself ever actually made any significant contributions to the field.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=428–433}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=2–3}} Many mathematical and scientific discoveries were attributed to Pythagoras, including [[Pythagorean theorem|his famous theorem]],&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 12; Plutarch, ''Non posse suav. vivi sec. Ep.'' p. 1094&lt;/ref&gt; as well as discoveries in the fields of [[Music of ancient Greece|music]],&lt;ref&gt;Porphyry, in ''Ptol. Harm.'' p. 213; Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greek astronomy|astronomy]],&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 14 ; Pliny, ''Hist. Nat.'' ii. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ancient Greek medicine|medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 12, 14, 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Since at least the first century BC, Pythagoras has commonly been given credit for discovering the [[Pythagorean theorem]],{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=32–33}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=26–27}} a theorem in geometry that states that "in a right-angled triangle the square of the hypotenuse is equal [to the sum of] the squares of the two other sides"{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=27}}—that is, &lt;math&gt;a^2 + b^2 = c^2&lt;/math&gt;. According to a popular legend, after he discovered this theorem, Pythagoras sacrificed an ox, or possibly even a whole ''[[hecatomb]]'', to the gods.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=27}}{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=428}} Cicero rejected this story as spurious{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=27}} because of the much more widely held belief that Pythagoras forbade blood sacrifices.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=27}} Porphyry attempted to explain the story by asserting that the ox was actually made of [[dough]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=27}}

The Pythagorean theorem was known and used by the [[Babylonian mathematics|Babylonians]] and [[Indian mathematics|Indians]] centuries before Pythagoras,{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=429, 462}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=27}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=32}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=6–7}} but it is possible that he may have been the first one to introduce it to the Greeks.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=429}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=32}} Some historians of mathematics have even suggested that he&amp;mdash;or his students&amp;mdash;may have constructed the first [[Mathematical proof|proof]].{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=33}} Burkert rejects this suggestion as implausible,{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=429}} noting that Pythagoras was never credited with having proved any theorem in antiquity.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=429}} Furthermore, the manner in which the Babylonians employed Pythagorean numbers implies that they knew that the principle was generally applicable, and knew some kind of proof, which has not yet been found in the (still largely unpublished) [[cuneiform]] sources.{{efn|There are about 100,000 unpublished cuneiform sources in the [[British Museum]] alone. Babylonian knowledge of proof of the Pythagorean Theorem is discussed by J. Høyrup, 'The Pythagorean "Rule" and "Theorem" – Mirror of the Relation between Babylonian and Greek Mathematics,' in: J. Renger (red.): ''Babylon. Focus mesopotamischer Geschichte, Wiege früher Gelehrsamkeit, Mythos in der Moderne'' (1999).}} Pythagoras's biographers state that he also was the first to identify the [[Platonic solid|five regular solids]]{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=1–2}} and that he was the first to discover the [[Proportionality (mathematics)|Theory of Proportions]].{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=1–2}}

{{See also|Pythagorean tuning |Pythagorean hammers}} 
According to legend, Pythagoras discovered that musical notes could be translated into mathematical equations when he passed blacksmiths at work one day and heard the sound of their [[Pythagorean hammers|hammers]] clanging against the anvils.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=27–28}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=27}} Thinking that the sounds of the hammers were beautiful and harmonious, except for one,{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=28}} he rushed into the [[blacksmith]] shop and began testing the hammers.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=28}} He then realized that the tune played when the hammer struck was directly proportional to the size of the hammer and therefore concluded that music was mathematical.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=28}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=27}} However, this legend is demonstrably false,{{sfn|Christensen|2002|page=143}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=29}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=27}} as these ratios are only relevant to string length (such as the string of a [[monochord]]), and not to hammer weight.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|page=143}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=27}}

===In astronomy===
In ancient times, Pythagoras and his contemporary [[Parmenides|Parmenides of Elea]] were both credited with having been the first to teach that the [[Spherical Earth|Earth was spherical]],{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=306}} the first to divide the globe into [[Geographical zone|five climactic zones]],{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=306}} and the first to identify the [[Phosphorus (morning star)|morning star]] and the [[Hesperus|evening star]] as the [[Venus|same celestial object]].{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=307–308}} Of the two philosophers, Parmenides has a much stronger claim to having been the first{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=306–308}} and the attribution of these discoveries to Pythagoras seems to have possibly originated from a [[pseudepigrapha]]l poem.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=307–308}} Empedocles, who lived in Magna Graecia shortly after Pythagoras and Parmenides, knew that the earth was spherical.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=53}} By the end of the fifth century BC, this fact was universally accepted among Greek intellectuals.{{sfn|Dicks|1970|page=68}}

==Later influence in antiquity==
===On Greek philosophy===
[[File:Timaeus trans calcidius med manuscript.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|alt=Old manuscript with writing in a thin, fancy script with colored geometric diagrams illustrating the text.|Medieval manuscript of [[Calcidius]]'s Latin translation of Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', which is one of the Platonic dialogues with the most overt Pythagorean influences{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=55–62}}]]
{{See also|Timaeus (dialogue)}}

Sizeable Pythagorean communities existed in Magna Graecia, [[Phlius]], and [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] during the early fourth century BC.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=48–49}} Around the same time, the Pythagorean philosopher [[Archytas]] was highly influential on the politics of the city of [[Taranto|Tarentum]] in Magna Graecia.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=39}} According to later tradition, Archytas was elected as ''[[strategos]]'' ("general") seven times, even though others were prohibited from serving more than a year.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=39}} Archytas was also a renowned mathematician and musician.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=39–43}} He was a close friend of Plato{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=39–40}} and he is quoted in Plato's ''Republic''.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=40, 44–45}}&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Republic'' VII, 530d&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle states that the philosophy of Plato was heavily dependent on the teachings of the Pythagoreans.&lt;ref&gt;Metaphysics, 1.6.1 (987a)&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=1}} Cicero repeats this statement, remarking that ''Platonem ferunt didicisse Pythagorea omnia'' ("They say Plato learned all things Pythagorean").&lt;ref&gt;Tusc. Disput. 1.17.39.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Charles H. Kahn, Plato's middle dialogues, including ''[[Meno]]'', ''[[Phaedo]]'', and ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', have a strong "Pythagorean coloring",{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=55}} and his last few dialogues (particularly ''[[Philebus]]'' and ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]''){{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=55–62}} are extremely Pythagorean in character.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=55–62}}

According to [[R. M. Hare]], Plato's ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' may be partially based on the "tightly organised community of like-minded thinkers" established by Pythagoras at Croton.{{sfn|Hare|1999|pages=117–119}} Additionally, Plato may have borrowed from Pythagoras the idea that mathematics and abstract thought are a secure basis for philosophy, science, and morality.{{sfn|Hare|1999|pages=117–119}} Plato and Pythagoras shared a "mystical approach to the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] and its place in the material world"{{sfn|Hare|1999|pages=117–119}} and it is probable that both were influenced by [[Orphicism|Orphism]].{{sfn|Hare|1999|pages=117–119}} The historian of philosophy [[Frederick Copleston]] states that Plato probably borrowed [[Plato's tripartite theory of soul|his tripartite theory of the soul]] from the Pythagoreans.{{sfn|Copleston|2003|page=37}} [[Bertrand Russell]], in his ''[[A History of Western Philosophy]]'', contends that the influence of Pythagoras on Plato and others was so great that he should be considered the most influential philosopher of all time.{{sfn|Russell|2008|pages=33–37}} He concludes that "I do not know of any other man who has been as influential as he was in the school of thought."{{sfn|Russell|2008|page=37}}

A revival of Pythagorean teachings occurred in the first century BC{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=123–124}} when [[Middle Platonism|Middle Platonist]] philosophers such as [[Eudorus of Alexandria|Eudorus]] and [[Philo of Alexandria]] hailed the rise of a "new" Pythagoreanism in [[Alexandria]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=124}} At around the same time, [[Neopythagoreanism]] became prominent.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=125–126}} The first-century AD philosopher [[Apollonius of Tyana]] sought to emulate Pythagoras and live by Pythagorean teachings.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=125}} The later first-century Neopythagorean philosopher [[Moderatus of Gades]] expanded on Pythagorean number philosophy{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=125}} and probably understood the soul as a "kind of mathematical harmony."{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=125}} The Neopythagorean mathematician and musicologist [[Nicomachus]] likewise expanded on Pythagorean numerology and music theory.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=125–126}} [[Numenius of Apamea]] interpreted Plato's teachings in light of Pythagorean doctrines.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=126–127}}

Greek sculpture sought to represent the permanent reality behind superficial appearances.{{sfn|Homann-Wedeking|1968|page=63}} Early [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] sculpture represents life in simple forms, and may have been influenced by the earliest Greek natural philosophies.{{efn|"For [[Thales]], the origin was water, and for [[Anaximander]] the infinite ([[apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]]), which must be considered a material form"{{sfn|Homann-Wedeking|1968|page=63}}}} The Greeks generally believed that nature expressed itself in ideal forms and was represented by a type ({{lang|grc|εἶδος}}), which was mathematically calculated.{{sfn|Homann-Wedeking|1968|page=62}}{{sfn|Carpenter|1921|pages=107, 122, 128}} When dimensions changed, architects sought to relay permanence through mathematics.{{sfn|Homann-Wedeking|1968|pages=62–63}}{{sfn|Bowra|1994|page=166}} [[Maurice Bowra]] believes that these ideas influenced the theory of Pythagoras and his students, who believed that "all things are numbers".{{sfn|Bowra|1994|page=166}}

During the sixth century BC, the number philosophy of the Pythagoreans triggered a revolution in Greek sculpture.{{sfn|Homann-Wedeking|1968|pages=62–65}} Greek sculptors and architects attempted to find the mathematical relation ([[aesthetic canon|canon]]) behind aesthetic perfection.{{sfn|Carpenter|1921|pages=107, 122, 128}} Possibly drawing on the ideas of Pythagoras,{{sfn|Carpenter|1921|pages=107, 122, 128}} the sculptor [[Polykleitos]] writes in his ''Canon'' that beauty consists in the proportion, not of the elements (materials), but of the interrelation of parts with one another and with the whole.{{sfn|Carpenter|1921|pages=107, 122, 128}}{{efn|"Each part (finger, palm, arm, etc) transmitted its individual existence to the next, and then to the whole": ''Canon of Polykleitos'', also [[Plotinus]], ''Ennead'' I.vi.i: Nigel Spivey, pp. 290–294.}} In the Greek architectural orders, every element was calculated and constructed by mathematical relations. [[Rhys Carpenter]] states that the ratio 2:1 was "the generative ratio of the [[Doric order]], and in Hellenistic times an ordinary Doric colonnade, beats out a rhythm of notes."{{sfn|Carpenter|1921|pages=107, 122, 128}}

The oldest known building designed according to Pythagorean teachings is the [[Porta Maggiore Basilica]],{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=154}} a subterranean basilica which was built during the reign of the Roman emperor [[Nero]] as a secret place of worship for Pythagoreans.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=154–156}} The basilica was built underground because of the Pythagorean emphasis on secrecy{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=157–158}} and also because of the legend that Pythagoras had sequestered himself in a cave on Samos.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=158}} The basilica's apse is in the east and its atrium in the west out of respect for the rising sun.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=158–159}} It has a narrow entrance leading to a small pool where the initiates could purify themselves.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=159}} The building is also designed according to Pythagorean numerology,{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=159–161}} with each table in the sanctuary providing seats for seven people.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=161}} Three aisles lead to a single altar, symbolizing the three parts of the soul approaching the unity of Apollo.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=161}} The apse depicts a scene of the poetess [[Sappho]] leaping off the [[Lefkada|Leucadian cliffs]], clutching her lyre to her breast, while Apollo stands beneath her, extending his right hand in a gesture of protection,{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=162}} symbolizing Pythagorean teachings about the immortality of the soul.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=162}} The interior of the sanctuary is almost entirely white because the color white was regarded by Pythagoreans as sacred.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=162–164}}

The emperor [[Hadrian]]'s [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in [[Rome]] was also built based on Pythagorean numerology.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=166–181}} The temple's circular plan, central axis, hemispherical [[dome]], and alignment with the four cardinal directions symbolize Pythagorean views on the order of the universe.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=167–168}} The single [[oculus]] at the top of the dome symbolizes the monad and the sun-god Apollo.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=168}} The twenty-eight ribs extending from the oculus symbolize the moon, because twenty-eight was the same number of months on the Pythagorean lunar calendar.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=169–170}} The five coffered rings beneath the ribs represent the marriage of the sun and moon.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=170–172}}

===In early Christianity===
Many early Christians had a deep respect for Pythagoras.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=57–65}} [[Eusebius]] ({{circa}} 260 – {{circa}} 340 AD), bishop of [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]], praises Pythagoras in his ''Against Hierokles'' for his rule of silence, his frugality, his "extraordinary" morality, and his wise teachings.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=57}} In another work, Eusebius compares Pythagoras to [[Moses]].{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=57}} In one of his letter, the [[Church Fathers|Church Father]] [[Jerome]] ({{circa}} 347 – 420 AD) praises Pythagoras for his wisdom{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=57}} and, in another letter, he credits Pythagoras for his belief in the immortality of the soul, which he suggests Christians inherited from him.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=57–58}} [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354 – 430 AD) rejected Pythagoras's teaching of metempsychosis without explicitly naming him, but otherwise expressed admiration for him.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=58–59}} In ''[[On the Trinity]]'', Augustine lauds the fact that Pythagoras was humble enough to call himself a ''philosophos'' or "lover of wisdom" rather than a "sage".{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=59}} In another passage, Augustine defends Pythagoras's reputation, arguing that Pythagoras certainly never taught the doctrine of metempsychosis.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=59}}

==After antiquity==
===In the Middle Ages===
[[File:Pythagore-chartres.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Medieval carving of a man with long hair and a long beard hunched over a musical instrument he is working on|Pythagoras appears in a relief sculpture on one of the [[archivolts]] over the right door of the west portal at [[Chartres Cathedral]].{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}}]]

During the [[Middle Ages]], Pythagoras was revered as the founder of mathematics and music, two of the [[Seven Liberal Arts]].{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} He appears in numerous medieval depictions, in illuminated manuscripts and in the relief sculptures on the portal of the [[Cathedral of Chartres]].{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} The ''Timaeus'' was the only dialogue of Plato to survive in Latin translation in western Europe,{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} which led [[William of Conches]] (c. 1080-1160) to declare that Plato was Pythagorean.{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} In the 1430s, the Camaldolese friar [[Ambrose Traversari]] translated Diogenes Laërtius's ''Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers'' from Greek into Latin{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} and, in the 1460s, the philosopher [[Marsilio Ficino]] translated Porphyry and Iamblichus's ''Lives of Pythagoras'' into Latin as well,{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} thereby allowing them to be read and studied by western scholars.{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} In 1494, the Greek Neopythagorean scholar [[Constantine Lascaris]] published ''[[The Golden Verses of Pythagoras]]'', translated into Latin, with a printed edition of his ''Grammatica'',{{sfn|Russo|2004|pages=5–87, especially 51–53}} thereby bringing them to a widespread audience.{{sfn|Russo|2004|pages=5–87, especially 51–53}} In 1499, he published the first Renaissance biography of Pythagoras in his work ''Vitae illustrium philosophorum siculorum et calabrorum'', issued in [[Messina]].{{sfn|Russo|2004|pages=5–87, especially 51–53}}

===On modern science===
In his preface to his book ''[[On the Revolution of the Heavenly Spheres]]'' (1543), [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] cites various Pythagoreans as the most important influences on the development of his [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric model]] of the universe,{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=160}} deliberately omitting mention of [[Aristarchus of Samos]], a non-Pythagorean astronomer who had developed a fully heliocentric model in the fourth century BC, in effort to portray his model as fundamentally Pythagorean.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=160}} [[Johannes Kepler]] considered himself to be a Pythagorean.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=161–171}}{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=265}} He believed in the Pythagorean doctrine of ''musica universalis''{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=264–274}} and it was his search for the mathematical equations behind this doctrine that led to his discovery of the [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|laws of planetary motion]].{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=264–274}} Kepler titled his book on the subject ''[[Harmonices Mundi]]'' (''Harmonics of the World''), after the Pythagorean teaching that had inspired him.{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=162}} Near the conclusion of the book, Kepler describes himself falling asleep to the sound of the heavenly music, "warmed by having drunk a generous draught... from the cup of Pythagoras."{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=274}}

[[Isaac Newton]] firmly believed in the Pythagorean teaching of the mathematical harmony and order of the universe.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=279}} Though Newton was notorious for rarely giving others credit for their discoveries,{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=279–280}} he attributed the discovery of the [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Law of Universal Gravitation]] to Pythagoras.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=279–280}} [[Albert Einstein]] believed that a scientist may also be "a Platonist or a Pythagorean insofar as he considers the viewpoint of logical simplicity as an indispensable and effective tool of his research."{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=172}} The English philosopher [[Alfred North Whitehead]] argued that "In a sense, Plato and Pythagoras stand nearer to modern physical science than does Aristotle. The two former were mathematicians, whereas Aristotle was the son of a doctor".{{sfn|Whitehead|1953|pages=36–37}} By this measure, Whitehead declared that Einstein and other modern scientists like him are "following the pure Pythagorean tradition."{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=172}}{{sfn|Whitehead|1953|page=36}}

===On vegetarianism===
[[File:Pythagoras advocating vegetarianism (1618-20); Peter Paul Rubens.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|alt=Painting showing Pythagoras on the far left quizzically stroking his beard as he gazes upon a massive pile of fruits and vegetables. Two followers stand behind him, fully clothed. A man with a greying beard sits at the base of a tree gesturing to the pile of produce. Next to him, a fleshy, nude woman with blonde hair plucks fruits from it. Slightly behind her, two other women, one partially clothed and the other nude but obscured by the tree branch, are also plucking fruits. At the far right end of the painting, two nude, faun-like men with beards and pointed ears hurl more fruits upon the pile.|''Pythagoras Advocating Vegetarianism'' (1618-1630) by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] was inspired by Pythagoras's speech in Ovid's ''Metamorphoses''.{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=192}} The painting portrays the Pythagoreans with corpulent bodies, indicating a belief that vegetarianism was healthful and nutritious.{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=192}}]]

A fictionalized portrayal of Pythagoras appears in Book XV of [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'',{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=189}} in which he delivers a speech imploring his followers to adhere to a strictly vegetarian diet.{{sfn|Borlik|2011|pages=189–190}} It was through [[Arthur Golding]]'s 1567 English translation of Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'' that Pythagoras was best known to English-speakers throughout the early modern period.{{sfn|Borlik|2011|pages=189–190}} [[John Donne]]'s ''Progress of the Soul'' discusses the implications of the doctrines expounded in the speech{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=190}} and [[Michel de Montaigne]] quoted the speech no less than three times in his treatise "Of Cruelty" to voice his moral objections against the mistreatment of animals.{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=190}} [[William Shakespeare]] references the speech in his play ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=282}} [[John Dryden]] included a translation of the scene with Pythagoras in his 1700 work ''[[Fables, Ancient and Modern]]''{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=190}} and [[John Gay]]'s 1726 fable "Pythagoras and the Countryman" reiterates its major themes, linking carnivorism with tyranny.{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=190}} [[Lord Chesterfield]] records that his conversion to vegetarianism had been motivated by reading Pythagoras's speech in Ovid's ''Metamorphoses''.{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=190}} Until the word ''vegetarianism'' was coined in the 1840s, vegetarians were referred to in English as "Pythagoreans".{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=190}} [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] wrote an ode entitled "To the Pythagorean Diet"{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=294}} and [[Leo Tolstoy]] adopted the Pythagorean diet himself.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=294}}

===On Western esotericism===
Early modern [[Western esotericism|European esotericism]] drew heavily on the teachings of Pythagoras.{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} The German [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] scholar [[Johannes Reuchlin]] (1455–1522) synthesized Pythagoreanism with [[Christian theology]] and Jewish [[Kabbalah]],{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=127–128}} arguing that Kabbalah and Pythagoreanism were both inspired by [[Moses|Mosaic]] tradition{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=128}} and that Pythagoras was therefore a kabbalist.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=128}} In his dialogue ''De verbo mirifico'' (1494), Reuchlin compared the Pythagorean tetractys to the [[Ineffability|ineffable]] divine name [[Tetragrammaton|YHWH]],{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=127–128}} ascribing each of the four letters of the tetragrammaton a symbolic meaning according to Pythagorean mystical teachings.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=128}}

[[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]]'s popular and influential three-volume treatise ''[[Three Books of Occult Philosophy|De Occulta Philosophia]]'' cites Pythagoras as a "religious magi"{{sfn|French|2002|page=30}} and indicates that Pythagoras's mystical numerology operates on a [[Allegory in Renaissance literature#Three world theory|supercelestial]] level.{{sfn|French|2002|page=30}} The [[Freemasonry|freemasons]] deliberately modeled their society on the community founded by Pythagoras at Croton.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=133}} [[Rosicrucianism]] used Pythagorean symbolism,{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} as did [[Robert Fludd]] (1574–1637),{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} who believed his own musical writings to have been inspired by Pythagoras.{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} [[John Dee]] was heavily influenced by Pythagorean ideology,{{sfn|Sherman|1995|page=15}}{{sfn|French|2002|page=30}} particularly the teaching that all things are made of numbers.{{sfn|Sherman|1995|page=15}}{{sfn|French|2002|page=30}} [[Adam Weishaupt]], the founder of the [[Illuminati]], was a strong admirer of Pythagoras{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=284–288}} and, in his book ''Pythagoras'' (1787), he advocated that society should be reformed to be more like Pythagoras's commune at Croton.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=287–288}} [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] incorporated Masonic and Pythagorean symbolism into his opera ''[[The Magic Flute]]''.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=286–287}} [[Sylvain Maréchal]], in his six-volume 1799 biography ''The Voyages of Pythagoras'', declared that all revolutionaries in all time periods are the "heirs of Pythagoras".{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=288}}

===On literature===
[[File:Paradiso Canto 31.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|alt=Engraving showing two small silhouettes standing before a tunnel of innumerably manifold circling angels leading to a bright, beautiful light at the end.|[[Dante Alighieri]]'s description of Heaven in his ''[[Paradiso (Dante)|Paradiso]]'' incorporates Pythagorean numerology.{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=89}}]]

[[Dante Alighieri]] was fascinated by Pythagorean numerology{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=89}} and based his descriptions of [[Hell]], [[Purgatory]], and [[Heaven]] on Pythagorean numbers.{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=89}} Dante wrote that Pythagoras saw Unity as Good and Plurality as Evil{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=90}} and, in ''[[Paradiso (Dante)|Paradiso]]'' XV, 56–57, he declares: "five and six, if understood, ray forth from unity."{{sfn|Haag|2013|pages=90–91}} The number eleven and its multiples are found throughout the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', each book of which has thirty-three [[canto]]s, except for the ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', which has thirty-four, the first of which serves as a general introduction.{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=91}} Dante describes the ninth and tenth bolgias in the Eighth Circle of Hell as being twenty-two miles and eleven miles respectively,{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=91}} which correspond to the fraction {{sfrac|22|7}}, which was the Pythagorean approximation of [[pi]].{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=91}} Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven are all described as circular{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=91}} and Dante compares the wonder of [[God in Christianity|God]]'s majesty to the mathematical puzzle of [[squaring the circle]].{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=91}} The number three also features prominently:{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=91}} the ''Divine Comedy'' has three parts{{sfn|Haag|2013|pages=91–92}} and [[Beatrice Portinari|Beatrice]] is associated with the number nine, which is equal to three times three.{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=92}}

The [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalists]] read the ancient ''Lives of Pythagoras'' as guides on how to live a model life.{{sfn|Bregman|2002|page=186}} [[Henry David Thoreau]] was impacted by [[Thomas Taylor (neoplatonist)|Thomas Taylor]]'s translations of Iamblichus's ''Life of Pythagoras'' and [[Stobaeus]]'s ''Pythagoric Sayings''{{sfn|Bregman|2002|page=186}} and his views on nature may have been influenced by the Pythagorean idea of images corresponding to archetypes.{{sfn|Bregman|2002|page=186}} The Pythagorean teaching of ''musica universalis'' is a recurring theme throughout Thoreau's ''[[magnum opus]]'', ''[[Walden]]''.{{sfn|Bregman|2002|page=186}}

Refinement types can express [[precondition]]s when used as [[function argument]]s or [[postcondition]]s when used as [[return type]]s:  for instance, the type of a function which accepts natural numbers and returns natural numbers greater than 5 may be written as &lt;math&gt;f: \mathbb{N} \rarr \{n: \mathbb{N} \, | \, n &gt; 5\}&lt;/math&gt;.  Refinement types are thus related to [[behavioral subtyping]].

      <comment>implicitly talking about Poincare dodecahedral space, is obtained by gluing opposite faces of a regular dodecahedron together; the result is clearly not a polytope. No citation to any other plausible hypothesis. Uses informal language and brings up string theory for no apparent reason. According to https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01593 there is no observed non-trivial topology of the universe. This appears to be pure speculation meant to enthrall the reader rather than inform them.</comment>

In [[mathematics]], a '''regular polytope''' is a [[polytope]] whose [[symmetry group]] acts [[transitive group action|transitively]] on its [[flag (geometry)|flags]], thus giving it the highest degree of symmetry. All its elements or ''j''-faces (for all 0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''j''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''n'', where ''n'' is the dimension of the polytope) &amp;mdash; cells, faces and so on &amp;mdash; are also transitive on the symmetries of the polytope, and are regular polytopes of dimension ≤&amp;nbsp;''n''.

Regular polytopes are the generalized analog in any number of dimensions of [[regular polygon]]s (for example, the [[square (geometry)|square]] or the regular pentagon) and [[regular polyhedra]] (for example, the [[cube]]). The strong symmetry of the regular polytopes gives them an [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] quality that interests both non-mathematicians and mathematicians.

Classically, a regular polytope in ''n'' dimensions may be defined as having regular [[Facet (geometry)|facets]] [(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)-faces] and regular [[vertex figure]]s. These two conditions are sufficient to ensure that all faces are alike and all vertices are alike. Note, however, that this definition does not work for [[abstract polytope]]s.

A regular polytope can be represented by a [[Schläfli symbol]] of the form {a,&amp;nbsp;b,&amp;nbsp;c,&amp;nbsp;....,&amp;nbsp;y,&amp;nbsp;z}, with regular facets as {a,&amp;nbsp;b,&amp;nbsp;c,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;y}, and regular vertex figures as {b,&amp;nbsp;c,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;y,&amp;nbsp;z}.

==Classification and description==
Regular polytopes are classified primarily according to their dimensionality.

They can be further classified according to [[symmetry]]. For example, the [[cube]] and the regular [[octahedron]] share the same symmetry, as do the regular [[dodecahedron]] and [[icosahedron]]. Indeed, symmetry groups are sometimes named after regular polytopes, for example the tetrahedral and icosahedral symmetries.

Three special classes of regular polytope exist in every dimensionality:
*[[Simplex|Regular simplex]]
*[[Measure polytope]] (Hypercube)
*[[Cross polytope]] (Orthoplex)

In two dimensions there are infinitely many [[regular polygon]]s. In three and four dimensions there are several more [[regular polyhedron|regular polyhedra]] and [[4-polytope]]s besides these three. In five dimensions and above, these are the only ones. See also the [[list of regular polytopes]].

The idea of a polytope is sometimes generalised to include related kinds of geometrical object. Some of these have regular examples, as discussed in the section on historical discovery below.

===Schläfli symbols===
{{main article|Schläfli symbol}}

A concise symbolic representation for regular polytopes was developed by Ludwig [[Schläfli]] in the 19th Century, and a slightly modified form has become standard. The notation is best explained by adding one dimension at a time.

*A [[convex polygon|convex]] [[regular polygon]] having ''n'' sides is denoted by {''n''}. So an equilateral triangle is {3}, a square {4}, and so on indefinitely. A regular [[star polygon]] which winds ''m'' times around its centre is denoted by the fractional value {''n''/''m''}, where ''n'' and ''m'' are [[co-prime]], so a regular [[pentagram]] is {5/2}.
*A [[regular polyhedron]] having faces {''n''} with ''p'' faces joining around a vertex is denoted by {''n'', ''p''}. The nine [[regular polyhedron|regular polyhedra]] are {3, 3} {3, 4} {4, 3} {3, 5} {5, 3} {3, 5/2} {5/2, 3} {5, 5/2} and {5/2, 5}. {''p''} is the ''[[vertex figure]]'' of the polyhedron.
*A regular 4-polytope having cells {''n'', ''p''} with ''q'' cells joining around an edge is denoted by {''n'', ''p'', ''q''}. The vertex figure of the 4-polytope is a {''p'', ''q''}.
*A regular 5-polytope is an {''n'', ''p'', ''q'', ''r''}. And so on.

===Duality of the regular polytopes===

The [[Dual polytope|dual]] of a regular polytope is also a regular polytope. The Schläfli symbol for the dual polytope is just the original symbol written backwards: {3, 3} is self-dual, {3, 4} is dual to {4, 3}, {4, 3, 3} to {3, 3, 4} and so on.

The [[vertex figure]] of a regular polytope is the dual of the dual polytope's facet. For example, the vertex figure of {3, 3, 4} is {3, 4}, the dual of which is {4, 3} &amp;mdash; a [[Cell (geometry)|cell]] of {4, 3, 3}.

The [[hypercube|measure]] and [[cross polytope]]s in any dimension are dual to each other.

If the Schläfli symbol is [[palindrome|palindromic]], i.e. reads the same forwards and backwards, then the polyhedron is self-dual. The self-dual regular polytopes are:
* All [[regular polygon]]s, {a}.
* All regular ''n''-[[simplex]]es, {3,3,...,3}
* The regular [[24-cell]] in 4&amp;nbsp;dimensions, {3,4,3}.
* The [[great 120-cell]] ({5,5/2,5}) and [[grand stellated 120-cell]] ({5/2,5,5/2}) in 4&amp;nbsp;dimensions.
* All regular ''n''-dimensional cubic [[Honeycomb (geometry)|honeycombs]], {4,3,...,3,4}. These may be treated as [[#Apeirotopes — infinite polytopes|infinite polytope]]s.
* Hyperbolic tilings and honeycombs (tilings {p,p} with p&gt;4 in 2 dimensions, [[Order-4 square tiling honeycomb|{4,4,4}]], [[order-5 dodecahedral honeycomb|{5,3,5}]]. [[Icosahedral honeycomb|{3,5,3}]], [[order-6 hexagonal tiling honeycomb|{6,3,6}]], and [[Hexagonal tiling honeycomb|{3,6,3}]] in 3 dimensions, [[order-5 120-cell honeycomb|{5,3,3,5}]] in 4 dimensions, and [[16-cell honeycomb honeycomb|{3,3,4,3,3}]] in 5 dimensions).

{{main article|Simplex}}
Begin with a point ''A''. Mark point ''B'' at a distance ''r'' from it, and join to form a [[line segment]]. Mark point ''C'' in a second, [[orthogonal]], dimension at a distance ''r'' from both, and join to ''A'' and ''B'' to form an [[equilateral triangle]]. Mark point ''D'' in a third, orthogonal, dimension a distance ''r'' from all three, and join to form a regular [[tetrahedron]]. And so on for higher dimensions.

These are the '''regular simplices''' or '''simplexes'''. Their names are, in order of dimensionality:

:0. [[Point (geometry)|Point]]
:1. [[Line segment]]
:2. [[Equilateral triangle]] (regular trigon)

Begin with a point ''A''. Extend a line to point ''B'' at distance ''r'', and join to form a line segment. Extend a second line of length ''r'', orthogonal to ''AB'', from ''B'' to ''C'', and likewise from ''A'' to ''D'', to form a [[Square (geometry)|square]] ''ABCD''. Extend lines of length ''r'' respectively from each corner, orthogonal to both ''AB'' and ''BC'' (i.e. upwards). Mark new points ''E'',''F'',''G'',''H'' to form the [[cube]] ''ABCDEFGH''. And so on for higher dimensions.

These are the '''measure polytopes''' or '''hypercubes'''. Their names are, in order of dimensionality:

:0. Point

===Convex polygons and polyhedra===

The earliest surviving mathematical treatment of regular polygons and polyhedra comes to us from [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] mathematicians. The five [[Platonic solid]]s were known to them. [[Pythagoras]] knew of at least three of them and [[Theaetetus (mathematician)|Theaetetus]] (c. 417 BC – 369 BC) described all five. Later, [[Euclid]] wrote a systematic study of mathematics, publishing it under the title ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', which built up a logical theory of geometry and [[number theory]]. His work concluded with mathematical descriptions of the five [[Platonic solid]]s.

===Star polygons and polyhedra===

Our understanding remained static for many centuries after Euclid. The subsequent history of the regular polytopes can be characterised by a gradual broadening of the basic concept, allowing more and more objects to be considered among their number. [[Thomas Bradwardine]] (Bradwardinus) was the first to record a serious study of star polygons. Various star polyhedra appear in Renaissance art, but it was not until [[Johannes Kepler]] studied the [[small stellated dodecahedron]] and the [[great stellated dodecahedron]] in 1619 that he realised these two were regular. [[Louis Poinsot]] discovered the [[great dodecahedron]] and [[great icosahedron]] in 1809, and [[Augustin Cauchy]] proved the list complete in 1812. These polyhedra are known as collectively as  the [[Kepler-Poinsot polyhedron|Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra]].

===Higher-dimensional polytopes===

[[Image:8-cell-simple.gif|right|thumb|A 3D projection of a rotating tesseract. This tesseract is initially oriented so that all edges are parallel to one of the four coordinate space axes. The rotation takes place in the xw plane.]]
It was not until the 19th century that a Swiss mathematician, [[Ludwig Schläfli]], examined and characterised the regular polytopes in higher dimensions. His efforts were first published in full in (Schläfli, 1901), six years posthumously, although parts of it were published in (Schläfli, 1855), (Schläfli, 1858). Between 1880 and 1900,
Schläfli's results were rediscovered independently by at least nine
other mathematicians &amp;mdash; see (Coxeter, 1948, pp143&amp;ndash;144) for more details.  Schläfli called such a figure a "polyschem" (in English, "polyscheme" or "polyschema"). The term "polytope" was introduced by [[Reinhold Hoppe]], one of Schläfli's rediscoverers, in 1882, and first used in English by [[Alicia Boole Stott]] some twenty years later. The term "polyhedroids" was also used in earlier literature (Hilbert, 1952).

Coxeter (1948) is probably the most comprehensive printed treatment of Schläfli's and similar results to date. Schläfli showed that there are six [[convex regular 4-polytope|regular convex polytopes in 4 dimensions]].  Five of them can be seen as analogous to the Platonic solids: the [[4-simplex]] (or pentachoron) to the [[tetrahedron]], the [[hypercube]] (or [[tesseract]]) to the [[cube]], the [[4-orthoplex]] (or hexadecachoron or [[16-cell]]) to the [[octahedron]], the [[120-cell]] to the [[dodecahedron]], and the [[600-cell]] to the [[icosahedron]].  The sixth, the [[24-cell]], can be seen as a transitional form between the hypercube and 16-cell, analogous to the way that the [[cuboctahedron]] and the [[rhombic dodecahedron]] are transitional forms between the cube and the octahedron.

In five and more dimensions, there are exactly three regular polytopes, which correspond to the tetrahedron, cube and octahedron: these are the [[Regular polytope#Regular simplices|regular simplices]], [[Regular polytope#Measure polytopes|measure polytopes]] and [[Regular polytope#Cross polytopes|cross polytopes]]. Descriptions of these may be found in the [[List of regular polytopes]]. Also of interest are the star [[regular 4-polytope]]s, partially discovered by Schläfli.

By the end of the 19th century, mathematicians such as [[Arthur Cayley]] and [[Ludwig Schläfli]] had developed the theory of regular polytopes in four and higher dimensions, such as the [[tesseract]] and the [[24-cell]].

The latter are difficult (though not impossible) to visualise, but still retain the aesthetically pleasing symmetry of their lower-dimensional cousins. The [[tesseract]] contains 8 cubical cells. It consists of two cubes in parallel hyperplanes with corresponding vertices cross-connected in such a way that the 8 cross-edges are equal in length and orthogonal to the 12+12 edges situated on each cube. The corresponding faces of the two cubes are connected to form the remaining 6 cubical faces of the [[tesseract]]. The [[24-cell]] can be derived from the [[tesseract]] by joining the 8 vertices of each of its cubical faces to an additional vertex to form the four-dimensional analogue of a pyramid. Both figures, as well as other 4-dimensional figures, can be directly visualised and depicted using 4-dimensional stereographs.&lt;ref name="Brisson"&gt;{{Citation | last = Brisson | first = David W. | contribution = Visual Comprehension in n-Dimensions | editor-last = Brisson | editor-first = David W.  | title = Hypergraphics: Visualizing Complex Relationships in Art, Science and Technology | series = AAAS Selected Symposium | volume = 24 | pages = 109–145 | publisher = AAAS | place = Washington, D.C.  | year = 1978 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harder still to imagine are the more modern [[abstract polytope|abstract regular polytopes]] such as the [[57-cell]] or the [[11-cell]]. From the mathematical point of view, however, these objects have the same aesthetic qualities as their more familiar two and three-dimensional relatives.

At the start of the 20th century, the definition of a regular polytope was as follows.
*A regular polygon is a polygon whose edges are all equal and whose angles are all equal.
*A regular polyhedron is a polyhedron whose faces are all congruent regular polygons, and whose [[vertex figure]]s are all congruent and regular.
*And so on, a regular ''n''-polytope is an ''n''-dimensional polytope whose (''n'' &amp;minus; 1)-dimensional faces are all regular and congruent, and whose vertex figures are all regular and congruent.

This is a "recursive" definition. It defines regularity of higher dimensional figures in terms of regular figures of a lower dimension. There is an equivalent (non-recursive) definition, which states that a polytope is regular if it has a sufficient degree of symmetry.

* An ''n''-polytope is regular if any set consisting of a vertex, an edge containing it, a 2-dimensional face containing the edge, and so on up to ''n''&amp;minus;1 dimensions, can be mapped to any other such set by a symmetry of the polytope.

So for example, the cube is regular because if we choose a vertex of the cube, and one of the three edges it is on, and one of the two faces containing the edge, then this triplet, or '''[[Flag (geometry)|flag]]''', (vertex, edge, face) can be mapped to any other such flag by a suitable symmetry of the cube. Thus we can define a regular polytope very succinctly:
*A regular polytope is one whose symmetry group is transitive on its flags.

In the 20th century, some important developments were made. The [[symmetry]] [[group (mathematics)|group]]s of the classical regular polytopes were generalised into what are now called [[Coxeter group]]s. Coxeter groups also include the symmetry groups of regular [[tessellation]]s of space or of the plane. For example, the symmetry group of an infinite [[chessboard]] would be the Coxeter group [4,4].

===Apeirotopes &amp;mdash; infinite polytopes===

{{main article|Regular skew polyhedron}}

In the first part of the 20th century, Coxeter and Petrie discovered three infinite structures {4, 6}, {6, 4} and {6, 6}. They called them regular skew polyhedra, because they seemed to satisfy the definition of a regular polyhedron &amp;mdash; all the vertices, edges and faces are alike, all the angles are the same, and the figure has no free edges. Nowadays, they are called infinite polyhedra or apeirohedra. The regular tilings of the plane {4, 4}, {3, 6} and {6, 3} can also be regarded as infinite polyhedra.

In the 1960s [[Branko Grünbaum]] issued a call to the geometric community to consider more abstract types of regular polytopes that he called ''polystromata''. He developed the theory of polystromata, showing examples of new objects he called [[apeirotope|regular apeirotopes]], that is, regular polytopes with [[infinity|infinitely]] many faces. A simple example of an [[skew apeirogon]] would be a zig-zag. It seems to satisfy the definition of a regular polygon &amp;mdash; all the edges are the same length, all the angles are the same, and the figure has no loose ends (because they can never be reached). More importantly, perhaps, there are symmetries of the zig-zag that can map any pair of a vertex and attached edge to any other. Since then, other regular apeirogons and higher apeirotopes have continued to be discovered.

===Regular complex polytopes===

{{main article|Complex polytope}}

A [[complex number]] has a real part, which is the bit we are all familiar with, and an imaginary part, which is a multiple of the square root of minus one. A complex [[Hilbert space]] has its x, y, z, etc. coordinates as complex numbers. This effectively doubles the number of dimensions. A polytope constructed in such a unitary space is called a '''[[complex polytope]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;Coxeter (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abstract polytopes===

{{main article|Abstract polytope}}

[[Image:Hemicube.svg|right|frame|The [[Hemi-cube (geometry)|Hemicube]] is derived from a cube by equating opposite vertices, edges, and faces. It has 4 vertices, 6 edges, and 3 faces.]]

Grünbaum also discovered the [[11-cell]], a four-dimensional [[Dual polyhedron|self-dual]] object whose facets are not icosahedra, but are "hemi-icosahedra" &amp;mdash; that is, they are the shape one gets if one considers opposite faces of the icosahedra to be actually the ''same'' face (Grünbaum, 1977). The hemi-icosahedron has only 10 triangular faces, and 6 vertices, unlike the icosahedron, which has 20 and 12.

This concept may be easier for the reader to grasp if one considers the relationship of the cube and the hemicube. An ordinary cube has 8 corners, they could be labeled A to H, with A opposite H, B opposite G, and so on. In a hemicube, A and H would be treated as the same corner. So would B and G, and so on. The edge AB would become the same edge as GH, and the face ABEF would become the same face as CDGH. The new shape has only three faces, 6 edges and 4 corners.

The 11-cell cannot be formed with regular geometry in flat (Euclidean) hyperspace, but only in positively curved (elliptic) hyperspace.

A few years after Grünbaum's discovery of the [[11-cell]], [[H. S. M. Coxeter]] independently discovered the same shape. He had earlier discovered a similar polytope, the [[57-cell]] (Coxeter 1982, 1984).

By 1994 Grünbaum was considering polytopes abstractly as combinatorial sets of points or vertices, and was unconcerned whether faces were planar. As he and others refined these ideas, such sets came to be called '''[[abstract polytope]]s'''. An abstract polytope is defined as a partially ordered set (poset), whose elements are the polytope's faces (vertices, edges, faces etc.) ordered by ''containment''. Certain restrictions are imposed on the set that are similar to properties satisfied by the classical regular polytopes (including the Platonic solids). The restrictions, however, are loose enough that regular tessellations, hemicubes, and even objects as strange as the 11-cell or stranger, are all examples of regular polytopes.

A geometric polytope is understood to be a ''realization'' of the abstract polytope, such that there is a one-to-one mapping from the abstract elements to the geometric. Thus, any geometric polytope may be described by the appropriate abstract poset, though not all abstract polytopes have proper geometric realizations.

The theory has since been further developed, largely by Egon Schulte and [[Peter McMullen]] (McMullen, 2002), but other researchers have also made contributions.

====Regularity of abstract polytopes====
Regularity has a related, though different meaning for [[abstract polytope]]s, since angles and lengths of edges have no meaning.

The definition of regularity in terms of the transitivity of flags as given in the introduction applies to abstract polytopes.

Any classical regular polytope has an abstract equivalent which is regular, obtained by taking the set of faces. But non-regular classical polytopes can have regular abstract equivalents, since abstract polytopes don't care about angles and edge lengths, for example. And a regular abstract polytope may not be realisable as a classical polytope.

''All polygons'' are regular in the abstract world, for example, whereas only those having equal angles and edges of equal length are regular in the  classical world.

====Vertex figure of abstract polytopes====

The concept of ''vertex figure'' is also defined differently for an [[abstract polytope]]. The vertex figure of a given abstract ''n''-polytope at a given vertex ''V'' is the set of all abstract faces which contain ''V'', including ''V'' itself.  More formally, it is the abstract section

: ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; / ''V'' = {''F'' | ''V'' ≤ ''F'' ≤ ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}

where ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the maximal face, i.e. the notional ''n''-face which contains all other faces. Note that each ''i''-face, ''i''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0 of the original polytope becomes an (''i''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)-face of the vertex figure.

Unlike the case for Euclidean polytopes, an abstract polytope with regular facets and vertex figures ''may or may not'' be regular itself &amp;ndash; for example, the square pyramid, all of whose facets and vertex figures are regular abstract polygons.

The classical vertex figure will, however, be a realisation of the abstract one.

== Constructions ==

=== Polygons ===

The traditional way to construct a regular polygon, or indeed any other figure on the plane, is by [[compass and straightedge]]. Constructing some regular polygons in this way is very simple (the easiest is perhaps the equilateral triangle), some are more complex, and some are impossible ("not constructible"). The simplest few regular polygons that are impossible to construct are the ''n''-sided polygons with ''n'' equal to 7, 9, 11, 13, 14, 18, 19, 21,...

[[Constructible polygon|Constructibility]] in this sense refers only to ideal constructions with ideal tools. Of course reasonably accurate approximations can be constructed by a range of methods; while theoretically possible constructions may be impractical.

=== Polyhedra ===

Euclid's ''Elements'' gave what amount to ruler-and-compass constructions for the five Platonic solids. (See, for example, [http://www.dform.com/projects/euclid/home.html Euclid's Elements].) However, the merely practical question of how one might draw a straight line in space, even with a ruler, might lead one to question what exactly it means to "construct" a regular polyhedron. (One could ask the same question about the polygons, of course.)
[[Image:icosahedron flat.svg|thumb|[[Net (polyhedron)|Net]] for [[icosahedron]]]] 
The English word "construct" has the connotation of systematically building the thing constructed. The most common way presented to construct a regular polyhedron is via a [[Net (polyhedron)|fold-out net]]. To obtain a fold-out net of a polyhedron, one takes the surface of the polyhedron and cuts it along just enough edges so that the surface may be laid out flat. This gives a plan for the net of the unfolded polyhedron. Since the Platonic solids have only triangles, squares and pentagons for faces, and these are all constructible with a ruler and compass, there exist ruler-and-compass methods for drawing these fold-out nets. The same applies to star polyhedra, although here we must be careful to make the net for only the visible outer surface.

If this net is drawn on cardboard, or similar foldable material (for example, sheet metal), the net may be cut out, folded along the uncut edges, joined along the appropriate cut edges, and so forming the polyhedron for which the net was designed. For a given polyhedron there may be many fold-out nets. For example, there are 11 for the cube, and over 900000 for the dodecahedron. Some interesting fold-out nets of the cube, octahedron, dodecahedron and icosahedron are available [http://www.progonos.com/furuti/MapProj/Normal/ProjPoly/projPoly.html here].

Numerous children's toys, generally aimed at the teen or pre-teen age bracket, allow experimentation with regular polygons and polyhedra. For example, [[klikko]] provides sets of plastic triangles, squares, pentagons and hexagons that can be joined edge-to-edge in a large number of different ways. A child playing with such a toy could re-discover the Platonic solids (or the [[Archimedean solid]]s), especially if given a little guidance from a knowledgeable adult.

In theory, almost any material may be used to construct regular polyhedra. Instructions for building [[origami]] models may be found  [https://web.archive.org/web/20041011191240/http://www1.zetosa.com.pl/~burczyk/origami/galery1-en.htm here], for example. They may be carved out of wood, modeled out of wire, formed from stained glass. The imagination is the limit.

=== Higher dimensions ===
[[Image:Tesseract2.svg|thumb|[[Net (polytope)|Net]] for [[tesseract]]]]
[[Image:Hypercube.svg|thumb|A perspective projection ([[Schlegel diagram]]) for tesseract]]
[[Image:24cell section anim.gif|right|frame|An animated cut-away cross-section of the [[24-cell]].]]
In higher dimensions, it becomes harder to say what one means by "constructing" the objects. Clearly, in a 3-dimensional universe, it is impossible to build a physical model of an object having 4 or more dimensions. There are several approaches normally taken to overcome this matter.

The first approach, suitable for four dimensions, uses four-dimensional stereography.&lt;ref name="Brisson"/&gt; Depth in a third dimension is represented with horizontal relative displacement, depth in a fourth dimension with vertical relative displacement between the left and right images of the stereograph.

The second approach is to embed the higher-dimensional objects in three-dimensional space, using methods analogous to the ways in which three-dimensional objects are drawn on the plane. For example, the fold out nets mentioned in the previous section have higher-dimensional equivalents. Some of these may be viewed at [http://www.weimholt.com/andrew/polytope.shtml]. One might even imagine building a model of this fold-out net, as one draws a polyhedron's fold-out net on a piece of paper. Sadly, we could never do the necessary folding of the 3-dimensional structure to obtain the 4-dimensional polytope because of the constraints of the physical universe. Another way to "draw" the higher-dimensional shapes in 3 dimensions is via some kind of projection, for example, the analogue of either [[Orthographic projection|orthographic]] or [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] projection. Coxeter's famous book on polytopes (Coxeter, 1948) has some examples of such orthographic projections. Other examples may be found on the web (see for example [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/600-Cell.html]). Note that immersing even 4-dimensional polychora directly into two dimensions is quite confusing. Easier to understand are 3-d models of the projections. Such models are occasionally found in science museums or mathematics departments of universities (such as that of the [[Université Libre de Bruxelles]]).

The intersection of a four (or higher) dimensional regular polytope with a three-dimensional hyperplane will be a polytope (not necessarily regular). If the hyperplane is moved through the shape, the three-dimensional slices can be combined, [[animation|animated]] into a kind of four dimensional object, where the fourth dimension is taken to be time. In this way, we can see (if not fully grasp) the full four-dimensional structure of the four-dimensional regular polytopes, via such cutaway cross sections. This is analogous to the way a [[CAT scan]] reassembles two-dimensional images to form a 3-dimensional representation of the organs being scanned. The ideal would be an animated [[hologram]] of some sort, however, even a simple animation such as the one shown can already give some limited insight into the structure of the polytope.

Another way a three-dimensional viewer can comprehend the structure of a four-dimensional polytope is through being "immersed" in the object, perhaps via some form of [[virtual reality]] technology. To understand how this might work, imagine what one would see if space were filled with cubes. The viewer would be inside one of the cubes, and would be able to see cubes in front of, behind, above, below, to the left and right of himself. If one could travel in these directions, one could explore the array of cubes, and gain an understanding of its geometrical structure. An [[Cubic honeycomb|infinite array of cubes]] is not a polytope in the traditional sense. In fact, it is a tessellation of 3-dimensional ([[Euclidean space|Euclidean]]) space. However, a 4-polytope can be considered a tessellation of a 3-dimensional [[non-Euclidean]] space, namely, a tessellation of the surface of a four-dimensional [[sphere]] (a 4-dimensional [[spherical tiling]]).

[[Image:Hyperbolic orthogonal dodecahedral honeycomb.png|thumb|left|[[Order-4 dodecahedral honeycomb|A regular dodecahedral honeycomb]], {5,3,4}, of hyperbolic space projected into 3-space.]]
Locally, this space seems like the one we are familiar with, and therefore, a virtual-reality system could, in principle, be programmed to allow exploration of these "tessellations", that is, of the 4-dimensional regular polytopes. The mathematics department at [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|UIUC]] has a number of pictures of what one would see if embedded in a [[tessellation]] of [[hyperbolic space]] with dodecahedra. Such a tessellation forms an example of an infinite abstract regular polytope.

Normally, for abstract regular polytopes, a mathematician considers that the object is "constructed" if the structure of its [[symmetry group]] is known. This is because of an important theorem in the study of abstract regular polytopes, providing a technique that allows the abstract regular polytope to be constructed from its symmetry group in a standard and straightforward manner.

In [[cryptography]], a [[key exchange|public key exchange]] algorithm is a [[cryptographic algorithm]] which allows two parties to create and share a secret key, which they can use to encrypt messages between themselves. The '''[[ring learning with errors]] key exchange''' ('''RLWE-KEX''') is one of a new class of public key exchange algorithms that are designed to be secure against an adversary that possesses a [[quantum computer]].  This is important because the vast majority of [[public key algorithm]]s in use today are easily broken by a quantum computer and scientists are making steady progress toward creating such a computer. [[Ring learning with errors|RLWE]]-KEX is one of a set of [[post-quantum cryptography|post-quantum cryptographic]] algorithms which are based on the difficulty of solving certain mathematical problems involving [[lattice-based cryptography|lattices]].  Unlike older lattice based cryptographic algorithms, the [[ring learning with errors|RLWE]]-KEX is provably reducible to a known hard problem in lattices.

== Background ==
Since the 1980s the security of cryptographic [[key exchange]]s and [[digital signature]]s over the Internet has been primarily based on a small number of [[public key]] algorithms.  The security of these algorithms is based on a similarly small number of computationally hard problems in classical computing.  These problems are the difficulty of [[Integer factorization|factoring the product of two carefully chosen prime numbers]], the difficulty to compute [[discrete logarithms]] in a carefully chosen finite field, and the difficulty of computing discrete logarithms in a carefully chosen [[elliptic curve]] group.  These problems are very difficult to solve on a classical computer (the type of computer the world has known since the 1940s through today) but are rather easily solved by a relatively small [[Quantum computing|quantum computer]] using only 5 to 10 thousand of bits of memory.  There is optimism in the computer industry that larger scale quantum computers will be available around 2030.  If a [[quantum computer]] of sufficient size were built, all of the public key algorithms based on these three classically hard problems would be insecure.  This public key cryptography is used today to secure Internet websites, protect computer login information, and prevent our computers from accepting malicious software.

Cryptography that is not susceptible to attack by a quantum computer is referred to as [[post-quantum cryptography|quantum safe]], or [[post-quantum cryptography]].  One class of quantum resistant cryptographic algorithms is based on a concept called "[[learning with errors]]" introduced by [[Oded Regev]] in 2005.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = On Lattices, Learning with Errors, Random Linear Codes, and Cryptography|url = http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1060590.1060603|publisher = ACM|journal = Proceedings of the Thirty-seventh Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing|date = 2005|location = New York, NY, USA|isbn = 1-58113-960-8|pages = 84–93|series = STOC '05|doi = 10.1145/1060590.1060603|first = Oded|last = Regev}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A specialized form of Learning with errors operates within the [[polynomial ring|ring of polynomials]] over a [[finite field]].  This specialized form is called [[ring learning with errors]] or [[ideal lattice cryptography|RLWE]].

There are a variety of cryptographic algorithms which work using the RLWE paradigm.  There are [[Public-key cryptography|public-key encryption]] algorithms, [[homomorphic encryption]] algorithms, and [[Ring learning with errors signature|RLWE digital signature]] algorithms in addition to the public key, key exchange algorithm presented in this article

A [[key exchange algorithm]] is a type of public key algorithm which establishes a shared secret key between two communicants on a communications link.  The classic example of a key exchange is the [[Diffie–Hellman key exchange]].  The exchange consists of one transmission from one end of the line and one transmission from the other end of the link.  [[Diffie–Hellman key exchange|Diffie–Hellman]] and [[elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman|Elliptic Curve Diffie–Hellman]] are the two most popular key exchange algorithms.

The RLWE Key Exchange is designed to be a "[[Quantum Safe Cryptography|quantum safe]]" replacement for the widely used [[Diffie–Hellman]] and [[elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman]] key exchanges that are used to secure the establishment of secret keys over untrusted communications channels.  Like Diffie–Hellman and Elliptic Curve Diffie–Hellman, the Ring-LWE key exchange provides a cryptographic property called "[[forward secrecy]]"; the aim of which is to reduce the effectiveness of [[mass surveillance]] programs and ensure that there are no long term secret keys that can be compromised that would enable bulk decryption.

== Introduction ==
Starting with a [[Prime number|prime]] integer q, the [[fing learning with errors|Ring-LWE]] key exchange works in the [[ring of polynomials]] modulo a polynomial &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; with coefficients in the field of integers mod q (i.e. the ring &lt;math&gt;R_q := Z_q[x] / \Phi(x)&lt;/math&gt;). Multiplication and addition of polynomials will work in the usual fashion with results of a multiplication reduced mod &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

In 2014, Peikert&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peikert|first=Chris|date=2014-01-01|title=Lattice  Cryptography  for  the  Internet|url=http://eprint.iacr.org/2014/070|journal=|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; presented a key transport scheme based on Ring-LWE. For somewhat greater than 128 [[bits of security]], Singh presents a set of parameters which have 6956-bit public keys for the Peikert's scheme.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singh|first=Vikram|date=2015|title=A  Practical  Key  Exchange  for  the  Internet  using  Lattice  Cryptography|url=http://eprint.iacr.org/2015/138}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corresponding private key would be roughly 14,000 bits. An RLWE version of the classic MQV variant of a Diffie–Hellman key exchange was later published by Zhang et al. in 2014. The security of both key exchanges is directly related to the problem of finding approximate short vectors in an ideal lattice. This article will closely follow the RLWE work of Ding in "A Simple Provably Secure Key Exchange Scheme Based on the Learning with Errors Problem".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/688.pdf|title=A Simple Provably Secure Key Exchange Scheme Based on the Learning with Errors Problem|last=Ding|first=Jintai|last2=Xie|first2=Xiang|last3=Lin|first3=Xiaodong|publisher=|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For this presentation a typical polynomial is expressed as:

: &lt;math&gt; a(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \cdots + a_{n-3} x^{n-3} + a_{n-2} x^{n-2} + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} &lt;/math&gt;

The coefficients of this polynomial, the ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;s, are integers&amp;nbsp;mod&amp;nbsp;''q''.  The polynomial &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; will be the [[cyclotomic polynomial]]. When ''n'' is a power of 2 then &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x) = x^n +1.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cryptology ePrint Archive: Report 2015/1120|url = https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1120|website = eprint.iacr.org|accessdate = 2015-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RLWE-KEX uses polynomials which are considered "small" with respect to a measure called the "[[infinity norm]]."  The infinity norm for a polynomial is simply the value of the largest coefficient of the polynomial when the coefficients are considered as integers in '''Z''' rather than &lt;math&gt;Zq&lt;/math&gt; (i.e.from the set {−(''q''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)/2,..., 0, ... (''q''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)/2} ).  The algorithm's security depends on an ability to generate random polynomials which are small with respect to the infinity norm.  This is done simply by randomly generating the coefficients for a polynomial (s&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., s&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) which are guaranteed or very likely to be small. There are two common ways to do this:
# Using [[Uniform distribution (discrete)|Uniform Sampling]] – The coefficients of the small polynomial are uniformly sampled from a set of small coefficients.  Let ''b'' be an integer that is much less than ''q''.  If we randomly choose coefficients from the set: { −''b'', −b&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1, −b&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2. ... −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, ... , ''b''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2, ''b''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, ''b''} the polynomial will be small with respect to the bound (b).  Singh suggest using b = 5.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Thus coefficients would be chosen from the set {''q''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;5, ''q''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;4, ''q''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;3, ''q''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2, ''q''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }.
# Using [[Gaussian distribution|Discrete Gaussian]] Sampling – For an odd value for q, the coefficients are randomly chosen by sampling from the set { −(q&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)/2 to (''q''&amp;nsbp;−&amp;nbsp;1)/2 } according to a discrete Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and distribution parameter&amp;nbsp;''σ''.  The references describe in full detail how this can be accomplished.  It is more complicated than uniform sampling but it allows for a proof of security of the algorithm.  An overview of Gaussian sampling is found in a presentation by Peikert.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = An Efficient and Parallel Gaussian Sampler for Lattices|url = https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~cpeikert/pubs/slides-pargauss.pdf|website = www.cc.gatech.edu|accessdate = 2015-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For the rest of this article, the random small polynomials will be sampled according to a distribution which is simply specified as '''D'''.  Further q will be an odd prime such that q is congruent to 1 mod 4 and 1 mod 2n. Other cases for q and n are thoroughly discussed in "A Toolkit for Ring-LWE Cryptography" and in Singh's "Even More Practical Key Exchange for the Internet using Lattice Cryptography."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lyubashevsky|first=Vadim|last2=Peikert|first2=Chris|last3=Regev|first3=Oded|date=2013|title=A  Toolkit  for  Ring-LWE  Cryptography|url=http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/293}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cryptology ePrint Archive: Report 2015/1120|url = http://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1120|website = eprint.iacr.org|access-date = 2016-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another paper by Singh.   A fixed public polynomial, a(x), shared by all users of the network.  It is deterministically generated from a cryptographically secure source.

Given ''a''(''x'') as stated, we can randomly choose small polynomials ''s''(''x'') and ''e''(''x'') to be the "private key" in a public key exchange. The corresponding public key will be the polynomial ''p''(''x'') = ''a''(''x'')''s''(''x'') + 2''e''(''x'').

== The key exchange ==
The key exchange will take place between two devices.  There will be an initiator for the key exchange designated as (I) and a respondent designated as (R).  Both I and R know ''q'', ''n'', ''a''(''x''), and have the ability to generate small polynomials according to the distribution &lt;math&gt;\chi_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; with parameter &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.  The distribution &lt;math&gt;\chi_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is usually the discrete Gaussian distribution on the ring &lt;math&gt; R_q = Zq[x]/\Phi(x)&lt;/math&gt;. The description which follows does not contain any explanation of why the key exchange results in the same key at both ends of a link.  Rather, it succinctly specifies the steps to be taken.  For a thorough understanding of why the key exchange results in the initiator and responder having the same key, the reader should look at the referenced work by Ding et al.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The key exchange begins with the initiator (I) doing the following:

'''Initiation:'''
# Generate two polynomials &lt;math&gt;s_I&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e_I&lt;/math&gt; with small coefficients by sampling from the distribution &lt;math&gt;\chi_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.
# Compute &lt;math&gt;p_I = as_I + 2e_I.&lt;/math&gt;
# The initiator sends the polynomial &lt;math&gt;p_I&lt;/math&gt; to the Responder.
'''Response:'''
# Generate two polynomials &lt;math&gt;s_R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e_R&lt;/math&gt; with small coefficients by sampling from the distribution &lt;math&gt;\chi_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.
# Compute &lt;math&gt;p_R = as_R + 2e_R&lt;/math&gt;.
# Generate a small &lt;math&gt;e'_R&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;\chi_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. Compute &lt;math&gt;k_R = p_Is_R+ 2e'_R&lt;/math&gt; . Then &lt;math&gt;k_R = as_Is_R + 2e_Is_R + 2e'_R&lt;/math&gt;''.''   
# Use the signal function &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Sig}&lt;/math&gt; to find  &lt;math&gt;w = \operatorname{Sig}(k_R) &lt;/math&gt;. This is computed by applying &lt;math&gt;Sig&lt;/math&gt; function on each coefficient of &lt;math&gt;k_R&lt;/math&gt;
# Respondent side's key stream &lt;math&gt;sk_R = \operatorname{Mod}_2(k_R,w)&lt;/math&gt; is calculated, based on the reconciliation information &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; and the polynomial &lt;math&gt;k_R&lt;/math&gt;.
# The Respondent sends &lt;math&gt;p_R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; to the Initiator.
'''Finish:'''
# Receive &lt;math&gt;p_R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; from the Responder.
# Sample &lt;math&gt;e'_I&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;\chi_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and Compute &lt;math&gt;k_I = p_Rs_I + 2e'_I = as_Is_R + 2e_Rs_I + 2e'_I&lt;/math&gt;.

# Initiator side's key stream is produced as &lt;math&gt;sk_I = \operatorname{Mod}_2(k_I,w)&lt;/math&gt; from the reconciliation information &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; and polynomial &lt;math&gt;k_I&lt;/math&gt;.

In the above key exchange, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Sig}&lt;/math&gt; is the signal function defined as below:

Define subset &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{E}:=\{-\lfloor \frac{q}{4} \rfloor,\ldots,\lfloor \frac{q}{4}\rceil\}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;Zq = \{-\frac{q-1}{2},\ldots,\frac{q-1}{2}\}&lt;/math&gt;. Here, &lt;math&gt;\lfloor.\rfloor&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lfloor.\rceil&lt;/math&gt;denotes the floor and the rounding to the nearest integer respectively.

Function &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Sig}&lt;/math&gt; is the characteristic function of the complement of '''E'''.

&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Sig}: Zq  \rightarrow \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Sig}(v) = \begin{cases} 0, &amp; \text{if } v \in E  \\ 1, &amp; \text{if } v \notin E. \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Mod}_2&lt;/math&gt; is the mod 2 operation to eliminate the error terms defined as follows: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Mod}_2 (v,w) = \biggl(v + w.\frac{q-1}{2}\Biggr)\bmod q\bmod 2&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the values of &lt;math&gt;k_I&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_R&lt;/math&gt;  are only approximately equal. In order to extract a shared key using this approximate equal values, a reconciliation function, also known as a signal function is used. This function indicates the region in which each coefficient of a polynomial &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;R_q&lt;/math&gt; lies and helps to make sure that the error terms in &lt;math&gt;k_R&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;k_I&lt;/math&gt; do not result in different mod q operations.

The methods of reconciliation and key string generation depends on the specific RLWE-KEX scheme in question. Some method is based on modular arithmetic, while others may be based on high-dimension geometry.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

If the key exchange worked properly, the initiator's string and the respondent's string will be the same.

Depending on the specifics of the parameters chosen, there is an extremely small probability that this key exchange will fail to produce the same key.  Parameters for the key exchange can be chosen to make the probability of failure in the key exchange very small; much less than the probability of undetectable garbles or device failures.

== Parameter choices ==
The RWLE-KEX exchange presented above worked in the Ring of Polynomials of degree ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 or less mod a polynomial &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x)&lt;/math&gt;.  The presentation assumed that n was a power of 2 and that q was a prime which was congruent to 1 (mod 2n).  Following the guidance given in Peikert's paper, Singh suggested two sets of parameters for the RLWE-KEX.

For 128 bits of security, ''n'' = 512, ''q'' = 25601, and &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x) = x^{512} + 1&lt;/math&gt;

For 256 bits of security, ''n'' = 1024, ''q'' = 40961, and &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x) = x^{1024} + 1&lt;/math&gt;

Because the key exchange uses random sampling and fixed bounds there is a small probability that the key exchange will fail to produce the same key for the initiator and responder. If we assume that the Gaussian parameter ''σ'' is 8/&amp;radic;(2{{pi}}) and the uniform sampling bound (''b'') = 5 (see Singh),&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  then the probability of key agreement failure is &lt;u&gt;less than&lt;/u&gt; 2&lt;sup&gt;−71&lt;/sup&gt; for the 128-bit secure parameters and &lt;u&gt;less than&lt;/u&gt; 2&lt;sup&gt;−91&lt;/sup&gt; for the 256-bit secure parameters.

In their November 2015 paper, Alkim, Ducas, Popplemann, and Schwabe recommend the following parameters n = 1024, q =12289, and &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; = x&lt;sup&gt;1024&lt;/sup&gt; + 1.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This represents a 70% reduction in public key size over the n = 1024 parameters of Singh.  A listing of a number of different parameter choices for key exchanges using the Ring Learning with Errors problem are given at this link ([http://www.ringlwe.info/parameters-for-rlwe.html click here]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in their November 2015 paper, Alkim, Ducas, Popplemann and Schwabe recommend that the choice of the base polynomial for the key exchange ( a(x) above ) be either generated randomly from a secure random number generator for each exchange or created in a verifiable fashion using a "nothing up my sleeve" or NUMS technique.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; An example of parameters generated in this way are the prime numbers for the Internet Key Exchange (&lt;nowiki&gt;RFC 2409&lt;/nowiki&gt;) which embed the digits of the mathematical constant pi in the digital representation of the prime number.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2409|title=The Internet Key Exchange (IKE)|last=D.|first=Carrel,|last2=D.|first2=Harkins,|website=tools.ietf.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their first method prevents amortization of attack costs across many key exchanges at the risk of leaving open the possibility of a hidden attack like that described by Dan Bernstein against the NIST elliptic curves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/35488/is-the-new-hope-lattice-key-exchange-vulnerable-to-a-lattice-analog-of-the-ber|title=Is the "New Hope" Lattice Key Exchange vulnerable to a lattice analog of the Bernstein BADA55 Attack?|website=crypto.stackexchange.com|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The NUMS approach is open to amortization but generally avoids the Bernstein attack if only common mathematical constants such as pi and e are used.

== Key exchange security ==
The security of this key exchange is based on the underlying hardness of [[ring learning with errors]] problem that has been proven to be as hard as the worst case solution to the [[shortest vector problem]] (SVP) in an [[ideal lattice cryptography|ideal lattice]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The best method to gauge the practical security of a given set of lattice parameters is the BKZ 2.0 lattice reduction algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = BKZ 2.0: Better Lattice Security Estimates|url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-25385-0_1|publisher = Springer Berlin Heidelberg|date = 2011|isbn = 978-3-642-25384-3|pages = 1–20|series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science|first = Yuanmi|last = Chen|first2 = Phong Q.|last2 = Nguyen|editor-first = Dong Hoon|editor-last = Lee|editor-first2 = Xiaoyun|editor-last2 = Wang}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the BKZ 2.0 algorithm the key exchange parameters listed above will provide greater than 128 or 256 bits of security, respectively.

==Implementations==
In 2014 Douglas Stebila made [http://www.douglas.stebila.ca/research/papers/bcns15 a patch] for OpenSSL 1.0.1f. based on his work and others published in "Post-quantum key exchange for the TLS protocol from the ring learning with errors problem."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Post-quantum  key  exchange  for  the  TLS  protocol  from  the  ring  learning  with  errors  problem|url = http://eprint.iacr.org/2014/599|date = 2014-01-01|first = Joppe W.|last = Bos|first2 = Craig|last2 = Costello|first3 = Michael|last3 = Naehrig|first4 = Douglas|last4 = Stebila}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Software implementing the work of Singh is found on GitHub at [https://github.com/vscrypto/ringlwe https://github.com/vscrypto/ringlwe.]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Other approaches ==
A variant of the approach described above is an authenticated version in the work of Zhang, Zhang, Ding, Snook and Dagdelen in their paper, "Post Quantum Authenticated Key Exchange from Ideal Lattices."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Workshop on Cybersecurity in a Post-Quantum World|url = https://www.nist.gov/itl/csd/ct/post-quantum-crypto-workshop-2015.cfm|website = www.nist.gov|accessdate = 2015-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept of creating what has been called a Diffie–Hellman-like Key Exchange using lattices with a reconciliation function appears to have first been presented by French researchers Aguilar, Gaborit, Lacharme, Schrek, and Zemor at PQCrypto 2010 in their talk, "Noisy Diffie–Hellman Protocols."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Noisy Diffie–Hellman protocols|url = https://pqc2010.cased.de/rr/03.pdf|website = pqc2010.cased.de|accessdate = 2015-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, Alkim, Ducas, Popplemann, and Schwabe built on the prior work of Peikert and used what they believe is a more conservative costing of lattice attacks to recommend parameters.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cryptology ePrint Archive: Report 2015/1092|url = https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1092|website = eprint.iacr.org|accessdate = 2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Software based on the work of Alkim, Ducas, Popplemann, and Schwabe is found on GitHub at https://github.com/tpoeppelmann/newhope&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8060">In [[behavioural sciences]], '''social rationality''' is a type of [[decision strategy]] used in social contexts, in which a set of simple rules is applied in complex and uncertain situations. 

== Definition ==

Social rationality is a form of [[bounded rationality]] applied to social contexts, where individuals make choices and predictions under uncertainty.&lt;ref name=Hertwig1&gt;Hertwig, Hoffrage, &amp; the ABC Research Group, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; While [[game theory]] deals with well-defined situations, social rationality explicitly deals with situations in which not all alternatives, consequences, and  event probabilities can be foreseen. The idea is that, similar to non-social environments, individuals rely, and should rely, on ''fast and frugal heuristics'' in order to deal with complex and  genuinely uncertain social environments.&lt;ref name=Hertwig1 /&gt; This emphasis on simple rules in an uncertain world contrasts with the view that the complexity of social situations requires highly sophisticated mental strategies, as has been assumed in primate research&lt;ref name=Humphrey&gt;Humphrey, 1988 [full citation needed]&lt;/ref&gt; and neuroscience,&lt;ref name=SeymourDolan&gt;Seymour &amp; Dolan, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; among others.

== A descriptive and normative program ==

Social rationality is both a descriptive program and a normative program. The ''descriptive'' program studies the repertoire of heuristics an individual or organization uses, that is, their ''adaptive toolbox''. The ''normative'' program studies the environmental conditions to which a heuristic is adapted, that is, where it performs better than other decision strategies. This approach is called the study of the [[ecological rationality]] of social heuristics. It assumes that social heuristics are ''domain- and problem-specific''.&lt;ref name=Hertwig2&gt;Hertwig &amp; Herzog, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gigerenzer1&gt;Gigerenzer, Todd, &amp; the ABC Research Group, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

Heuristics can be applied to social and non-social decision tasks (also called social games and games against nature), judgments, or categorizations. They can use social or non-social input. Social rationality is thus about three of the four possible combinations, excluding the case of heuristics using non-social input for non-social tasks. 'Games against nature' comprise situations where individuals face environmental uncertainty, and need to predict or outwit nature, e.g., harvest food or master hard-to-predict or unpredictable hazards.&lt;ref name=Hertwig3&gt;Hertwig &amp; Hoffrage, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; 'Social games' include situations, where the decision outcome depends on the choices of others, e.g., in cooperation, competition, mate search and even in morally significant situations.&lt;ref name=Gigerenzer2&gt;Gigerenzer, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Social rationality has been studied in a number of other fields than human decision-making, e.g. in evolutionary social learning,&lt;ref name=Morgan&gt;Morgan, Rendell, Ehn, Hoppitt, &amp; Laland 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and social learning in animals.&lt;ref name=Rieucau&gt;Rieucau &amp; Giraldeau, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples ===

==== Imitate-the-majority heuristic ====
An example for a heuristic that is not necessarily social but that requires social input is the ''imitate-the-majority heuristic'', where in a situation of uncertainty, individuals follow the actions or choices of the majority of their peers regardless of their social status. The domain of pro-environmental behavior provides numerous illustrations for this strategy, such as [[litter]]ing behavior in public places,&lt;ref name=Cialdini&gt;Cialdini, Reno, &amp; Kallgren 1991&lt;/ref&gt; the reuse of towels in hotel rooms,&lt;ref name=Goldstein&gt;Goldstein, Cialdini, &amp; Griskevicius 2008 [full citation needed]&lt;/ref&gt; and changes in private energy consumption in response to information about the consumption of the majority of neighbors.&lt;ref name=Schultz&gt;Schultz, Nolan, Cialdini, Goldstein, &amp; Griskevicius 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1/N (Equality heuristic) ====
Following the ''[[equality heuristic]]'' (sometimes called ''1/N rule'') people divide and invest their resources equally in a number of N different options. These options can be both social (e.g., time spent with children) and nonsocial entities (e.g., financial investments or natural resources). For example, many parents invest their limited resources, such as affection, time, and money (e.g., for education) equally into their offspring.&lt;ref name=Hertwig4&gt;Hertwig et al., 2002 [full citation needed]&lt;/ref&gt; In highly uncertain environments with large numbers of assets and only few possibilities to learn, the equality heuristic can outperform optimizing strategies and yield better performance on various measures of success than optimal asset allocation strategies.&lt;ref name=DeMiguel&gt;DeMiguel, Garlappi, and Uppal (2009) [full citation needed]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], [[physics]], and [[engineering]], '''spatial frequency''' is a characteristic of any structure that is [[periodic function|periodic]] across position in [[space]]. The spatial frequency is a measure of how often  [[Sine wave|sinusoidal components]] (as determined by the [[Fourier transform]]) of the structure repeat per unit of distance. The [[SI]] unit of spatial frequency is [[rotation|cycles]] per [[meter]]. In [[image processing|image-processing]] applications, spatial frequency is often expressed in units of cycles per millimeter or equivalently line pairs per millimeter.

In wave mechanics, the spatial frequency is commonly denoted by &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SPIE Optipedia article: [http://spie.org/x34301.xml "Spatial Frequency"]&lt;/ref&gt;
or sometimes &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;, although the latter is also used&lt;ref&gt;As in e.g. [[Planck constant|Planck's formula]].&lt;/ref&gt;
to represent temporal [[frequency]]. It is related to the [[wavelength]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;\xi = \frac{1}{\lambda}.&lt;/math&gt;

Likewise, the [[wavenumber|angular wave number]] &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, measured in radians per meter, is related to spatial frequency and wavelength by

:&lt;math&gt;k = 2 \pi \xi = \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Visual perception==
In the study of [[visual perception]], [[sine wave|sinusoidal]] [[grating]]s are frequently used to probe the capabilities of the [[visual system]]. In these [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]], spatial frequency is expressed as the number of cycles per [[degree (angle)|degree]] of [[visual angle]]. Sine-wave gratings also differ from one another in amplitude (the magnitude of difference in intensity between light and dark stripes), and angle.

=== Spatial-frequency theory ===

The spatial-frequency theory refers to  the theory that the [[visual cortex]] operates on a code of spatial frequency, not on the code of straight edges and lines hypothesised by Hubel and Wiesel on the basis of early experiments on V1 neurons in the cat.&lt;ref name="pmc2556291"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Martinez LM, Alonso JM |title=Complex receptive fields in primary visual cortex |journal=Neuroscientist |year=2003 |volume=9 |issue=5 |pages=317–31 |pmid=14580117 |pmc=2556291 |doi=10.1177/1073858403252732}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=De Valois |first1=R. L. |last2=De Valois |first2=K. K. |year=1988 |title=Spatial vision |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In support of this theory is the experimental observation that the visual cortex neurons respond even more robustly to sine-wave gratings that are placed at specific angles in their [[Receptive field#Visual system|receptive fields]] than they do to edges or bars. Most neurons in the primary visual cortex respond best when a sine-wave grating of a particular frequency is presented at a particular angle in a particular location in the visual field.&lt;ref name="pmc2412904"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Issa N=P, Trepel C, Stryker MP |year=2000 |title=Spatial frequency maps in cat visual cortex |journal=The Journal of Neuroscience |volume=20 |issue=22 |pages=8504–8514 |pmc=2412904 |pmid=11069958}}&lt;/ref&gt; (However, as noted by Teller (1984),&lt;ref&gt;[http://cognitrn.psych.indiana.edu/busey/q551/PDFs/Teller-%20Linking%20Propositions.pdf Teller, D. "Linking Propositions"]&lt;/ref&gt; it is probably not wise to treat the highest firing rate of a particular neuron as having a special significance with respect to its role in the perception of a particular stimulus, given that the neural code is known to be linked to relative firing rates. For example, in color coding by the three cones in the human retina, there is no special significance to the cone that is firing most strongly – what matters is the relative rate of firing of all three simultaneously. Teller (1984) similarly noted that a strong firing rate in response to a particular stimulus should not be interpreted as indicating that the neuron is somehow specialized for that stimulus, since there is an unlimited equivalence class of stimuli capable of producing similar firing rates.)

The spatial-frequency theory of vision is based on two physical principles:

# Any visual stimulus can be represented by plotting the intensity of the light along lines running through it.
# Any curve can be broken down into constituent sine waves by [[Fourier analysis]].

The theory (for which empirical support has yet to be developed) states that in each functional module of the visual cortex, Fourier analysis is performed on the receptive field and the neurons in each module are thought to respond selectively to various orientations and frequencies of sine wave gratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barghout|first1=Lauren|title=Vision: How Global Perceptual Context Changes Local Contrast Processing (Ph.D. Dissertation 2003). Updated for Computer Vision Techniques|date=2014|publisher=Scholars' Press|isbn=978-3-639-70962-9|url=https://www.morebooks.de/store/gb/book/vision/isbn/978-3-639-70962-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; When all of the visual cortex neurons that are influenced by a specific scene respond together, the perception of the scene is created by the summation of the various sine-wave gratings. (This procedure, however, does not address the problem of the organization of the products of the summation into figures, grounds, and so on. It effectively recovers the original (pre-Fourier analysis) distribution of photon intensity and wavelengths across the retinal projection, but does not add information to this original distribution. So the functional value of such a hypothesized procedure is unclear. Some other objections to the "Fourier theory" are discussed by Westheimer (2001) &lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1068/p3193?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed Westheimer, G. "The Fourier Theory of Vision"]&lt;/ref&gt;).  One is generally not aware of the individual spatial frequency components since all of the elements are essentially blended together into one smooth representation. However, computer-based filtering procedures can be used to deconstruct an image into its individual spatial frequency components.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, R. and Sekuler, R., ''Perception'', 3rd ed. Chapter 3. {{ISBN|978-0-072-88760-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research on spatial frequency detection by visual neurons complements and extends previous research using straight edges rather than refuting it.&lt;ref&gt;Pinel, J. P. J., ''Biopsychology'', 6th ed. 293–294. {{ISBN|0-205-42651-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further research shows that different spatial frequencies convey different information about the appearance of a stimulus. High spatial frequencies represent abrupt spatial changes in the image, such as edges, and generally correspond to featural information and fine detail. M. Bar (2004) has proposed that low spatial frequencies represent global information about the shape, such as general orientation and proportions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bar M |title=Visual objects in context |journal=Nat.

Neurosci. |volume=5 |issue=8 |pages=617–29 |date=Aug 2004 |pmid=15263892 |doi=10.1038/nrn1476 |quote=&lt;br/&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v5/n8/box/nrn1476_BX2.html Box 2: Spatial frequencies and the information they convey] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rapid and specialised perception of faces is known to rely more on low spatial frequency information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Awasthi B, Friedman J, Williams MA |title=Faster, stronger, lateralized: Low spatial frequency information supports face processing |journal=Neuropsychologia |volume=49 |issue=13 |pages=3583–3590 |year=2011 |doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2011.08.027 |pmid=21939676}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the general population of adults, the threshold for spatial frequency discrimination is about 7%. It is often poorer in dyslexic individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ben-Yehudah G, Ahissar M |title=Sequential spatial frequency discrimination is consistently impaired among adult dyslexics |journal=Vision Res. |volume=44 |issue=10 |pages=1047–63 |date=May 2004 |pmid=15031099 |doi=10.1016/j.visres.2003.12.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sinusoidal gratings and Michelson equation===
There is an important quantitative concept related to spatial frequency, known as the [[Albert A. Michelson|Michelson]] equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{I_\mathrm{max}-I_\mathrm{min}}{I_\mathrm{max}+I_\mathrm{min}}.&lt;/math&gt;

In layman's terms, this is the ratio of the crest–trough distance to the maximum thereof, which is twice the average.  One degree on the visual field represents four cycles on the wave pattern.&lt;ref&gt;"Vision" McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science &amp; Technology, vol. 19, p.292 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4306">{{about|spite in the context of [[fair division]], a branch of theoretical economics. The word is also used in [[psychology]] and in the study of [[social evolution]]||Spite (disambiguation)}}

In [[fair division]] problems, '''spite''' is a phenomenon that occurs when a player's value of an allocation decreases when one or more other players' valuation increases.  Thus, other things being equal, a player exhibiting spite will prefer an allocation in which other players receive less than more (if more of the good is desirable).

In this language, spite is difficult to analyze because one has to assess two sets of preferences.  For example, in the [[divide and choose]] method, a spiteful player would have to make a trade-off between depriving his opponent of cake, and getting more himself.

Within the field of [[social evolution]], spite is used to describe those social behaviors that have a negative impact on both the actor and recipient(s). Spite can be favored by [[kin selection]] when: (a) it leads to an indirect benefit to some third party that is sufficiently related to the actor (Wilsonian spite); or (b) when it is directed primarily at negatively related individuals ([[Hamiltonian spite]]). Negative relatedness occurs when two individuals are less related than average.

==In game theory==
The [[iterated prisoner's dilemma]] provides an example where players may "punish" each other for failing to cooperate in previous rounds, even if doing so would cause negative consequences for both players. For example, the simple "[[tit for tat]]" strategy has been shown to be effective in round-robin tournaments of iterated prisoner's dilemma.

==In industrial relations==
There is always difficulty in fairly dividing the proceeds of a business between the business owners and the employees.

When a [[trade union]] decides to call a [[strike action|strike]], both employer and the union members lose money (and may damage the national [[economy]]). The unionists hope that the employer will give in to their demands before such losses have destroyed the business.

In the reverse direction, an employer may [[Termination of employment|terminate the employment]] of certain productive workers who are agitating for higher wages or [[Union organizer|organising]] a trade union. Losing productive workers is a setback to both the business and the employees but this can serve as an example to others and thus maximise employer power.

==In behavioral ecology==
Polyembryonic wasps, including C. floridanum, exhibit spite through instances of precocious larval development.&lt;ref name="Gardner 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gardner|first=Andy|author2=Ian C.W. Hardy |author3=Peter D. Taylor |author4=Stuart A.

Two criteria demonstrate that spite is truly occurring: (i) the behavior is truly costly to the actor and does not provide a long-term direct benefit; and (ii) harming behaviors are directed toward relatively unrelated individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davies|first=Nicholas B. |author2=John R.

An &lt;math&gt; (\alpha,d,\beta)&lt;/math&gt;-'''superprocess''', &lt;math&gt;X(t,dx)&lt;/math&gt;, is a [[stochastic process]] on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt; that is usually constructed as a special limit of branching diffusion where the branching mechanism is given by its [[factorial moment generating function]]:
:&lt;math&gt; \Phi(s) = \frac{1}{1+\beta}(1-s)^{1+\beta}+s&lt;/math&gt;
and the spatial motion of individual particles is given by the &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-symmetric [[Lévy process|stable process]] with [[Generator (mathematics)|infinitesimal generator]]
&lt;math&gt;\Delta_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;.

The &lt;math&gt;\alpha = 2&lt;/math&gt; case corresponds to standard [[Brownian motion]] and the &lt;math&gt;(2,d,1)&lt;/math&gt;-superprocess is called the [[Dawson-Watanabe]] superprocess or super-Brownian motion.

One of the most important properties of superprocesses is that they are intimately connected with certain nonlinear [[partial differential equation]]s.
The simplest such equation is
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta u-u^2=0\ on\  \mathbb{R}^d.&lt;/math&gt;

This is the theory [[Theory (mathematical logic)#Theories associated with a structure|associated]] with the [[Peano axioms#Models|standard model]] of the [[Peano axioms]] in the [[Signature (logic)|language]] of the first-order Peano axioms.
True arithmetic is occasionally called Skolem arithmetic, though this term usually refers to the different theory of natural numbers with multiplication.

== Definition ==

The [[Signature (logic)|signature]] of [[Peano arithmetic]] includes the addition, multiplication, and successor function symbols, the equality and less-than relation symbols, and a constant symbol for 0. The (well-formed) formulas of the '''language of first-order arithmetic''' are built up from these symbols together with the logical symbols in the usual manner of [[first-order logic]].

The [[structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be a model of Peano arithmetic as follows.
* The [[domain of discourse]] is the set &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; of natural numbers.
* The symbol 0 is interpreted as the number 0.
* The function symbols are interpreted as the usual arithmetical operations on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;
* The equality and less-than relation symbols are interpreted as the usual equality and order relation on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;
This structure is known as the [[nonstandard arithmetic|'''standard model''']] or [[intended interpretation]] of first-order arithmetic.

A [[sentence (mathematical logic)|sentence]] in the language of first-order arithmetic is said to be true in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt; if it is true in the structure just defined. The notation &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N} \models \varphi&lt;/math&gt; is used to indicate that the sentence φ is true in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}.&lt;/math&gt;

'''True arithmetic''' is defined to be the set of all sentences in the language of first-order arithmetic that are true in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt;, written {{nowrap|1=Th(&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt;)}}. This set is, equivalently, the (complete) theory of the structure &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt; (see [[Theory (mathematical logic)#Theories associated with a structure|theories associated with a structure]]).

== Arithmetic undefinability ==

The central result on true arithmetic is the [[Tarski's undefinability theorem|undefinability theorem]] of [[Alfred Tarski]] (1936). It states that 
the set {{nowrap|1=Th(&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt;)}} is not arithmetically definable. This means that there is no formula &lt;math&gt; \varphi(x)&lt;/math&gt; in the language of first-order arithmetic such that, for every sentence θ in this language, 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N} \models \theta \qquad&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N} \models \varphi(\underline{\#(\theta)}).&lt;/math&gt;
Here &lt;math&gt;\underline{\#(\theta)}&lt;/math&gt; is the numeral of the canonical [[Gödel number]] of the sentence ''θ''.

[[Post's theorem]] is a sharper version of the undefinability theorem that shows a relationship between the definability of {{nowrap|1=Th(&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt;)}} and the [[Turing degree]]s, using the [[arithmetical hierarchy]]. For each natural number ''n'', let {{nowrap|1=Th&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt;)}}  be the subset of {{nowrap|1=Th(&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt;)}} consisting of only sentences that are &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_n&lt;/math&gt; or lower in the arithmetical hierarchy. Post's theorem shows that, for each ''n'', {{nowrap|1=Th&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt;)}} is arithmetically definable, but only by a formula of complexity higher than &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_n&lt;/math&gt;. Thus no single formula can define {{nowrap|1=Th(&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt;)}}, because 
:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Th}(\mathcal{N}) = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \mbox{Th}_n(\mathcal{N})&lt;/math&gt;
but no single formula can define {{nowrap|1=Th&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt;)}} for arbitrarily large ''n''.

== Computability properties ==

As discussed above, {{nowrap|1=Th(&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt;)}} is not arithmetically definable, by Tarski's theorem. A corollary of Post's theorem establishes that the [[Turing degree]] of {{nowrap|1=Th(&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt;)}} is '''0'''&lt;sup&gt;(ω)&lt;/sup&gt;, and so {{nowrap|1=Th(&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt;)}}  is not [[decidable set|decidable]] nor [[recursively enumerable set|recursively enumerable]].

{{nowrap|1=Th(&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt;)}} is closely related to the theory {{nowrap|1=Th(&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt;)}} of the [[recursively enumerable Turing degree]]s, in the signature of [[partial order]]s (Shore 1999:184). In particular, there are computable functions ''S'' and ''T'' such that:
* For each sentence φ in the signature of first order arithmetic, φ is in  {{nowrap|1=Th(&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt;)}} if and only if S(φ) is in {{nowrap|1=Th(&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt;)}}
* For each sentence ψ in the signature of partial orders, ψ is in  {{nowrap|1=Th(&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt;)}} if and only if T(ψ) is in  {{nowrap|1=Th(&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt;)}}.

== Model-theoretic properties ==

True arithmetic is an [[stable theory|unstable theory]], and so has &lt;math&gt;2^\kappa&lt;/math&gt; models for each uncountable cardinal &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;.  As there are continuum many [[type (model theory)|type]]s over the empty set, true arithmetic also has &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;  countable models.  Since the theory is [[complete theory|complete]], all of its models are [[elementarily equivalent]].

== True theory of second-order arithmetic ==

The true theory of second-order arithmetic consists of all the sentences in the language of [[second-order arithmetic]] that are satisfied by the standard model of second-order arithmetic, whose first-order part is the structure &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt; and whose second-order part consists of every subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;.

The true theory of first-order arithmetic, {{nowrap|1=Th(&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt;)}}, is a subset of the true theory of second order arithmetic, and {{nowrap|1=Th(&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt;)}} is definable in second-order arithmetic.  However, the generalization of Post's theorem to the [[analytical hierarchy]] shows that the true theory of second-order arithmetic is not definable by any single formula in second-order arithmetic.

Simpson (1977) has shown that the true theory of second-order arithmetic is computably interpretable with the theory of the partial order of all [[Turing degree]]s, in the signature of partial orders, and ''vice versa''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12817">In [[mathematics]], the '''Veblen functions''' are a hierarchy of [[normal function]]s ([[continuous function (set theory)|continuous]] [[strictly increasing function|strictly increasing]] [[function (mathematics)|function]]s from [[ordinal number|ordinal]]s to ordinals), introduced by [[Oswald Veblen]] in {{harvtxt|Veblen|1908}}. If φ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is any normal function, then for any non-zero ordinal α, φ&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; is the function enumerating the common [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]]s of φ&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt; for β&lt;α. These functions are all normal.

== The Veblen hierarchy ==
In the special case when  φ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(α)=ω&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;
this family of functions is known as the '''Veblen hierarchy'''. 
The function φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the same as the ε function: φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(α)= ε&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt; \beta \,,&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\varphi_{\alpha}(\varphi_{\beta}(\gamma)) = \varphi_{\beta}(\gamma) \,.&lt;/math&gt; From this and the fact that φ&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt; is strictly increasing we get the ordering: &lt;math&gt;\varphi_\alpha(\beta) &lt; \varphi_\gamma(\delta) &lt;/math&gt; if and only if either (&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \gamma &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta &lt; \delta &lt;/math&gt;) or (&lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt; \gamma &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta &lt; \varphi_\gamma(\delta) &lt;/math&gt;) or (&lt;math&gt;\alpha &gt; \gamma &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varphi_\alpha(\beta) &lt; \delta &lt;/math&gt;).

=== Fundamental sequences for the Veblen hierarchy ===
The fundamental sequence for an ordinal with [[cofinality]] ω is a distinguished strictly increasing ω-sequence which has the ordinal as its limit. If one has fundamental sequences for α and all smaller limit ordinals, then one can create an explicit constructive bijection between ω and α, (i.e. one not using the axiom of choice). Here we will describe fundamental sequences for the Veblen hierarchy of ordinals. The image of ''n'' under the fundamental sequence for α will be indicated by α[''n''].

A variation of [[Ordinal arithmetic#Cantor normal form|Cantor normal form]] used in connection with the Veblen hierarchy is &amp;mdash; every nonzero ordinal number α can be uniquely written as &lt;math&gt;\alpha = \varphi_{\beta_1}(\gamma_1) + \varphi_{\beta_2}(\gamma_2) + \cdots + \varphi_{\beta_k}(\gamma_k)&lt;/math&gt;, where ''k''&gt;0 is a natural number and each term after the first is less than or equal to the previous term, &lt;math&gt;\varphi_{\beta_m}(\gamma_m) \geq \varphi_{\beta_{m+1}}(\gamma_{m+1}) \,,&lt;/math&gt; and each &lt;math&gt;\gamma_m &lt; \varphi_{\beta_m}(\gamma_m) \,.&lt;/math&gt; If a fundamental sequence can be provided for the last term, then that term can be replaced by such a sequence to get &lt;math&gt;\alpha [n] = \varphi_{\beta_1}(\gamma_1) + \cdots + \varphi_{\beta_{k-1}}(\gamma_{k-1}) + (\varphi_{\beta_k}(\gamma_k) [n]) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

For any β, if γ is a limit with &lt;math&gt;\gamma &lt; \varphi_{\beta} (\gamma) \,,&lt;/math&gt; then let &lt;math&gt;\varphi_{\beta}(\gamma) [n] = \varphi_{\beta}(\gamma [n]) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

No such sequence can be provided for &lt;math&gt;\varphi_0(0)&lt;/math&gt; = ω&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 because it does not have cofinality ω.

For &lt;math&gt;\varphi_0(\gamma+1) = \omega ^{\gamma+1} = \omega^ \gamma \cdot \omega \,,&lt;/math&gt; we choose &lt;math&gt;\varphi_0(\gamma+1) [n] = \varphi_0(\gamma) \cdot n  = \omega^{\gamma} \cdot n \,.&lt;/math&gt;

For &lt;math&gt;\varphi_{\beta+1}(0) \,,&lt;/math&gt; we use &lt;math&gt;\varphi_{\beta+1}(0) [0] = 0 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varphi_{\beta+1}(0) [n+1] = \varphi_{\beta}(\varphi_{\beta+1}(0) [n]) \,,&lt;/math&gt; i.e. 0, &lt;math&gt;\varphi_{\beta}(0)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\varphi_{\beta}(\varphi_{\beta}(0))&lt;/math&gt;, etc..

For &lt;math&gt;\varphi_{\beta+1}(\gamma+1)&lt;/math&gt;, we use &lt;math&gt;\varphi_{\beta+1}(\gamma+1) [0] = \varphi_{\beta+1}(\gamma)+1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varphi_{\beta+1}(\gamma+1) [n+1] = \varphi_{\beta} (\varphi_{\beta+1}(\gamma+1) [n]) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Now suppose that β is a limit:

If &lt;math&gt;\beta &lt; \varphi_{\beta}(0)&lt;/math&gt;, then let &lt;math&gt;\varphi_{\beta}(0) [n] = \varphi_{\beta [n]}(0) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

For &lt;math&gt;\varphi_{\beta}(\gamma+1)&lt;/math&gt;, use &lt;math&gt;\varphi_{\beta}(\gamma+1) [n] = \varphi_{\beta [n]}(\varphi_{\beta}(\gamma)+1) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Otherwise, the ordinal cannot be described in terms of smaller ordinals using &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; and this scheme does not apply to it.

===The &amp;Gamma; function===
The function Γ enumerates the ordinals α such that φ&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;(0) = α. 
Γ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Feferman–Schütte ordinal]], i.e. it is the smallest α such that φ&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;(0) = α.

For Γ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, a fundamental sequence could be chosen to be &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_0 [0] = 0 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_0 [n+1] = \varphi_{\Gamma_0 [n]} (0) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

For Γ&lt;sub&gt;β+1&lt;/sub&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{\beta+1} [0] = \Gamma_{\beta} + 1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{\beta+1} [n+1] = \varphi_{\Gamma_{\beta+1} [n]} (0) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

For Γ&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\beta &lt; \Gamma_{\beta} &lt;/math&gt; is a limit, let &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{\beta} [n] = \Gamma_{\beta [n]} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

==Generalizations==

===Finitely many variables===
To build the Veblen function of a finite number of arguments (finitary Veblen function), let the binary function &lt;math&gt;\varphi(\alpha, \gamma)&lt;/math&gt; be &lt;math&gt;\varphi_\alpha(\gamma)&lt;/math&gt; as defined above.

Let &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; be an empty string or a string consisting of one or more comma-separated zeros &lt;math&gt;0,0,...,0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; be an empty string or a string consisting of one or more comma-separated ordinals &lt;math&gt;\alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},...,\alpha _{n}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\alpha _{1}&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. The binary function &lt;math&gt;\varphi (\beta ,\gamma )&lt;/math&gt; can be written as &lt;math&gt;\varphi (s,\beta ,z,\gamma )&lt;/math&gt; where both &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; are empty strings.
The finitary Veblen functions are defined as follows:
* &lt;math&gt;\varphi (\gamma )=\omega ^{\gamma }&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\varphi (z,s,\gamma )=\varphi (s,\gamma )&lt;/math&gt;
* if &lt;math&gt;\beta &gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\varphi (s,\beta ,z,\gamma )&lt;/math&gt; denotes the &lt;math&gt;(1+\gamma )&lt;/math&gt;-th common fixed point of the functions &lt;math&gt;\xi \mapsto \varphi (s,\delta ,\xi ,z)&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;\delta &lt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;

For example, &lt;math&gt;\varphi(1,0,\gamma)&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;(1+\gamma)&lt;/math&gt;-th fixed point of the functions &lt;math&gt;\xi\mapsto\varphi(\xi,0)&lt;/math&gt;, namely &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_\gamma&lt;/math&gt;; then &lt;math&gt;\varphi(1,1,\gamma)&lt;/math&gt; enumerates the fixed points of that function, i.e., of the &lt;math&gt;\xi\mapsto\Gamma_\xi&lt;/math&gt; function; and &lt;math&gt;\varphi(2,0,\gamma)&lt;/math&gt; enumerates the fixed points of all the &lt;math&gt;\xi\mapsto\varphi(1,\xi,0)&lt;/math&gt;.  Each instance of the generalized Veblen functions is continuous in the ''last nonzero'' variable (i.e., if one variable is made to vary and all later variables are kept constantly equal to zero).

The ordinal &lt;math&gt;\varphi(1,0,0,0)&lt;/math&gt; is sometimes known as the [[Ackermann ordinal]].  The limit of the &lt;math&gt;\varphi(1,0,...,0)&lt;/math&gt; where the number of zeroes ranges over ω, is sometimes known as the [[Small Veblen ordinal|“small” Veblen ordinal]].

Every non-zero ordinal &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; less than the small Veblen ordinal (SVO) can be uniquely written in normal form for the finitary Veblen function:

&lt;math&gt;\alpha =\varphi (s_{1})+\varphi (s_{2})+\cdots +\varphi (s_{k})&lt;/math&gt;

where
* &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a positive integer
* &lt;math&gt;\varphi (s_{1})\geq \varphi (s_{2})\geq \cdots \geq \varphi (s_{k})&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;s_{m}&lt;/math&gt; is a string consisting of one or more comma-separated ordinals &lt;math&gt;\alpha _{m,1},\alpha _{m,2},...,\alpha _{m,n_{m}}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\alpha _{m,1}&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and each &lt;math&gt;\alpha _{m,i}&lt;\varphi (s_{m})&lt;/math&gt;

=== Fundamental sequences for limit ordinals of finitary Veblen function ===

For limit ordinals &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;SVO&lt;/math&gt;, written in normal form for the finitary Veblen function:
* &lt;math&gt;(\varphi(s_1)+\varphi(s_2)+\cdots+\varphi(s_k))[n]=\varphi(s_1)+\varphi(s_2)+\cdots+\varphi(s_k)[n]&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;\varphi(\gamma)[n]=\left\{\begin{array}{lcr}
n \quad \text{if} \quad \gamma=1\\
\varphi(\gamma-1)\cdot n \quad \text{if} \quad \gamma \quad \text{is a successor ordinal}\\
\varphi(\gamma[n]) \quad \text{if} \quad \gamma \quad \text{is a limit ordinal}\\
\end{array}\right.
&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;\varphi(s,\beta,z,\gamma)[0]=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varphi(s,\beta,z,\gamma)[n+1]=\varphi(s,\beta-1,\varphi(s,\beta,z,\gamma)[n],z)&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\gamma=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is a successor ordinal,
* &lt;math&gt;\varphi(s,\beta,z,\gamma)[0]=\varphi(s,\beta,z,\gamma-1)+1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varphi(s,\beta,z,\gamma)[n+1]=\varphi(s,\beta-1,\varphi(s,\beta,z,\gamma)[n],z)&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; are successor ordinals,
* &lt;math&gt;\varphi(s,\beta,z,\gamma)[n]=\varphi(s,\beta,z,\gamma[n])&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a limit ordinal,
* &lt;math&gt;\varphi(s,\beta,z,\gamma)[n]=\varphi(s,\beta[n],z,\gamma)&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\gamma=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is a limit ordinal,
* &lt;math&gt;\varphi(s,\beta,z,\gamma)[n]=\varphi(s,\beta[n],\varphi(s,\beta,z,\gamma-1)+1,z)&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a successor ordinal and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is a limit ordinal.

===Transfinitely many variables===
More generally, Veblen showed that φ can be defined even for a transfinite sequence of ordinals α&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt;, provided that all but a finite number of them are zero. Notice that if such a sequence of ordinals is chosen from those less than an uncountable [[regular cardinal]] κ, then the sequence may be encoded as a single ordinal less than κ&lt;sup&gt;κ&lt;/sup&gt;. So one is defining a function φ from κ&lt;sup&gt;κ&lt;/sup&gt; into κ.

The definition can be given as follows: let &lt;u&gt;α&lt;/u&gt; be a transfinite sequence of ordinals (i.e., an ordinal function with finite support) ''which ends in zero'' (i.e., such that α₀=0), and let &lt;u&gt;α&lt;/u&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;0↦γ&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; denote the same function where the final 0 has been replaced by γ.  Then γ↦φ(&lt;u&gt;α&lt;/u&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;0↦γ&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;) is defined as the function enumerating the common fixed points of all functions ξ↦φ(&lt;u&gt;β&lt;/u&gt;) where &lt;u&gt;β&lt;/u&gt; ranges over all sequences which are obtained by decreasing the smallest-indexed nonzero value of &lt;u&gt;α&lt;/u&gt; and replacing some smaller-indexed value with the indeterminate ξ (i.e., &lt;u&gt;β&lt;/u&gt;=&lt;u&gt;α&lt;/u&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;ι₀↦ζ,ι↦ξ&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; meaning that for the smallest index ι₀ such that α&lt;sub&gt;ι₀&lt;/sub&gt; is nonzero the latter has been replaced by some value ζ&amp;lt;α&lt;sub&gt;ι₀&lt;/sub&gt; and that for some smaller index ι&amp;lt;ι₀, the value α&lt;sub&gt;ι&lt;/sub&gt;=0 has been replaced with ξ).

For example, if &lt;u&gt;α&lt;/u&gt;=(ω↦1) denotes the transfinite sequence with value 1 at ω and 0 everywhere else, then φ(ω↦1) is the smallest fixed point of all the functions ξ↦φ(ξ,0,…,0) with finitely many final zeroes (it is also the limit of the φ(1,0,…,0) with finitely many zeroes, the small Veblen ordinal).

The smallest ordinal α such that α is greater than φ applied to any function with support in α (i.e., which cannot be reached “from below” using the Veblen function of transfinitely many variables) is sometimes known as the [[Large Veblen ordinal|“large” Veblen ordinal]].
