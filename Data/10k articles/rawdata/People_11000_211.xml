'''Agnes Bowker''' (born 1540) was a [[UK|British]]  domestic servant and the alleged mother of a cat.

==Life==
[[File:Agnes Bowkers cat Figure-5.57-1569.jpg|thumb|left|The original picture was sent by Anthony Anderson and the cat was red]]
Bowker was born in [[Leicestershire]] (probably [[Market Harborough]]) to a local family in about 1541. She came to prominence when her midwife, Elizabeth Harrison, reported that she had given birth to a cat on 16 January 1569. The story caused interest as it was feared that some may see this as a portent. The idea was not dismissed even after the cat that was said to have been born was found to have food in its stomach.&lt;ref name=scot/&gt; A pamphlet was circulated. Bowker was not married and she had tried to drown and hanging herself during her pregnancy. The rest of her life is unclear but she came from a local family and she worked in the Leicestershire area. She had visited London and seen [[Elizabeth I]] in 1566.&lt;ref name=dcodnb/&gt;

The report was made to the church authorities and [[Anthony Anderson (theologian)|Anthony Anderson]] who worked for the Archdeacon of Leicester. He created a life-size drawing of a cat which he annotated and sent it to nobleman [[Henry Hastings, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon]].&lt;ref name=scot&gt;[http://www.scotsman.com/news/agnes-bowker-1-733525 Agnes Bowker], 9 December 2006, The Scotsman, Retrieved 11 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Hastings had local connections but he was also close to the Queen during the [[Rising of the North]].&lt;ref name=hhodnb&gt;Claire Cross, ‘Hastings, Henry, third earl of Huntingdon (1536?–1595)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/12574, accessed 11 May 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; He sent the report to Queen Elizabeth's advisor Sir [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]]. Cecil sent it on to [[Edmund Grindal]] who was then the Bishop of London but who would in time be the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. Grindal concluded the affair in August of that year when ruled that it was a hoax, but he conceded that there was no evidence to prove that Bowker was not telling the truth.&lt;ref name=dcodnb&gt;David Cressy, ‘Bowker, Agnes (b. 1541/2)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Oct 2006 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/93851, accessed 11 May 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
It isn't known what happened to Agnes Bowker but the picture of the cat is now in the [[British Library]]. Bowker's alleged birth of a cat was also dismissed by the London physician [[William Bullein]] in 1573.&lt;ref name=dcodnb/&gt;

'''Aleksandr Leonidovich Zaitsev''' ({{lang-ru|Александр Леонидович Зайцев}}; born May 19, 1945) is a [[Russia]]n and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] radio engineer and astronomer from [[Fryazino]].&lt;ref&gt;Picture of Alexander Zaitsev during the [[The European Radio Astronomy Club|ERAC]] Conference at the [[Starkenburg Observatory]] in [[Heppenheim]], [[Germany]], in 2004; http://www.setileague.org/photos/eurose04/euro0407.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Official picture of Alexander Zaitsev&amp;nbsp;– http://www.spacedaily.com/images/seti-alexander-zaitsev-bg.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Summary&amp;nbsp;– http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/Z/Zaitsev.html&lt;/ref&gt;  He works on [[radar astronomy]] devices, [[near-Earth asteroid]] [[radar]] research, and [[SETI]].

Zaitsev is the chief scientist at the [[Russian Academy of Science]]'s Institute of [[Radio]] Engineering and [[Electronics]].  He heads the group transmitting Team Encounter's [[interstellar messages]] &lt;ref&gt;Interstellar radio messages&amp;nbsp;– http://www.cplire.ru/html/ra&amp;sr/irm/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; using the [[Yevpatoria]] (Evpatoria) Deep Space Center (EDSC).&lt;ref&gt;Yevpatoria Deep Space Communication Center&amp;nbsp;– {{cite web |url=http://evpatoria.asteroids.ru/DSCC.ENG/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226125706/http://evpatoria.asteroids.ru/DSCC.ENG/index.htm |archivedate=2007-12-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Zaitsev is also serving as the [[SETI#The SETI League and Project Argus|SETI League's]] Regional Coordinator for [[Russia]].&lt;ref name=SETILeague&gt;SETI League: http://www.setileague.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Zaitsev's career has focused on three main topics: the theory, the design and implementation of [[radar]] devices used in the study of [[Venus]], [[Mars]], and [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]; [[near-Earth asteroid]] [[radar]] research;&lt;ref&gt;EuroRadar&amp;nbsp;– Origin and Concepts of Design&amp;nbsp;– {{cite web |url=http://spaceguard.esa.int/tumblingstone/issues/num10/euroradar.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050419031223/http://spaceguard.esa.int/tumblingstone/issues/num10/euroradar.htm |archivedate=2005-04-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence|interstellar radio messaging]],&lt;ref&gt;Sending and Searching for Interstellar Messages&amp;nbsp;– http://fire.relarn.ru/126/docs/iac_07_a4_2.02.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; his current field of research. He retired in 2013.

Zaitsev observed the [[asteroid]] [[4179 Toutatis]] &lt;ref&gt;Article "One-dimensional Radio Message for 'Blind' Aliens"&amp;nbsp;– http://www.orbit.zkm.de/?q=node/187&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[MPC No 25445, 1995]&amp;nbsp;– excerpt of Lutz D. Schmadel, Dictionary of Minor Planet Names, Springer, 5th Edition, page 508, article "(6075) Zaitsev"&lt;/ref&gt; in December 1992 using the 70-m [[Yevpatoria RT-70 radio telescope|Yevpatorian Planetary Radar]] in [[Crimea]] ([[Ukraine]]), as a sounding [[Signal (electrical engineering)|signal]] [[transmitter]], and the 100-m [[radio telescope]] in [[Effelsberg]], [[Germany]], as a receiver of the [[asteroid]]'s [[radar astronomy|radar echo]].

In June 1995, Zaitsev was responsible for initiating the world's first intercontinental [[radar astronomy]] experiment; the radar groups participating in this experiment were led by [[Steven Ostro]] at [[JPL]], Zaitsev in Yevpatoria, and [[Yasuhiro Koyama]] in Kashima, [[Japan]].  Ostro's group transmitted and received using the [[Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex|Goldstone]] site of the [[Deep Space Network]], while Zaitsev received using the Yevpatoria site and Koyama's group received at [[Kashima, Ibaraki|Kashima]].  The target asteroid, [[6489 Golevka]], was later named for the participating observatories ('''GOL-EV-KA''' or '''GOL'''dstone-'''EV'''patoria-'''KA'''shima).  Zaitsev has also conducted work on using [[radar]] to determine the composition of [[asteroids]] and planetary bodies.

Zaitsev supervised the [[data transmission|transmission]] of the 1999 and 2003 [[Cosmic Call]]s &lt;ref&gt;Cosmic Call 2003&amp;nbsp;– http://lnfm1.sai.msu.ru/SETI/koi/bulletin/23/1.1.html&lt;/ref&gt; from Yevpatoria Planetary [[Radar]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://echo.jpl.nasa.gov/publications/review_abs.html Planetary radar astronomy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (EPR).&lt;ref&gt;Article "Design and Implementation of the 1st Theremin Concert for Aliens"&amp;nbsp;– http://www.cplire.ru/html/ra&amp;sr/irm/Theremin-concert.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Article SETI-METI "Past&amp;nbsp;– Present&amp;nbsp;– Future"&amp;nbsp;– http://www.setileague.org/editor/motion.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;One-dimensional Radio Message for 'Blind' Aliens&amp;nbsp;– http://www.orbit.zkm.de/?q=node/187&lt;/ref&gt;  Under his leadership, a youth group in [[Moscow]] composed and broadcast a '[[Teen Age Message]] to ETI'.  Zaitsev proposed three-section structure of interstellar radio messages, coined the acronym [[Active SETI|METI]] (Messaging to Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) &lt;ref&gt;METI&amp;nbsp;– http://www.cplire.ru/html/ra&amp;sr/irm/METI_Art.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0610031 Messaging to Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and the phrase 'SETI paradox',&lt;ref&gt;The SETI Paradox&amp;nbsp;– https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0611283&lt;/ref&gt; which refers to an apparent "paradox" where two distant civilizations capable of interstellar communication will always remain silent unless one of them contacts the other first, resulting in a deadlock of silence. In 2005, in article "[http://www.setileague.org/editor/metifact.htm The Drake Equation: Adding a METI Factor]" he suggested that a high technological is not enough for establishing contact with Aliens because appropriate behavior directed to practical realization of sending signals is necessary too.

In 2006-2011, Zaitsev was one of the contributors to the

'''Allie Novak''' is a fictional character from the Australian drama series ''[[Wentworth (TV series)|Wentworth]]'', played by [[Kate Jenkinson]]. She made her first appearance during the [[Wentworth (season 4)|fourth season]] episode titled, "[[First Blood (Wentworth)|First Blood]]", broadcast on 10 May 2016. The character was introduced as a new prison inmate and friend of [[Kaz Proctor]] ([[Tammy Macintosh]]), participating in their vigilante group, which has a vested interest in protecting women. One story writers developed for Allie was a romance with then-central character [[Bea Smith (Wentworth)|Bea Smith]] ([[Danielle Cormack]]), a pairing that television critic Elaine Atwell of [[After Ellen]] has praised.

==Casting==
Kate Jenkinson had wanted a role in Wentworth since she had started watching the show while sick with the flu.&lt;ref name=flu&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/wentworth-has-a-new-inmate-in-season-four-actress-kate-jenkinson/news-story/fc919c5669cb2d86d24f4fb708056ddf|title=Wentworth has a new inmate in season four, actress Kate Jenkinson|work=[[News.com.au]]|publisher=[[News Corp Australia]]|accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jenkinson recalled that when her agent contacted her informing her of the role in ''Wentworth'', she replied "well it's mine".&lt;ref name=flu/&gt; The actress has stated that "playing a character so “damaged and broken and colourful” is a responsibility she takes seriously."&lt;ref name=flu/&gt; Jenkinson decided to research her role by seeking out women similar to her character. Her search led her to women's outreach centers, where residents shared their own experiences and advice.&lt;ref name=flu/&gt;

==Development==
&lt;!--===Characterization===--&gt;
{{cquote|Allie was once a drug addicted street prostitute who suffered abuse by her clients and her pimp failed to protect her. Kaz found her and insisted on taking her under her wing. Fiercely independent, Allie had no interest in being saved by anyone but she was interested in the violent retribution the Red Right Hand was enacting. As a gay woman, Allie found solace being with women and emotional respite from a lifestyle she couldn’t escape. Kaz let Allie live with her and together they attacked the various Johns who had assaulted Allie over the years. Having somewhere to sleep every night and a purpose during the day, helped ease Allie’s drug dependency.

The sentence is Allie's second prison term. She had previously been incarcerated for assault. Despite this charge, the character is not "flustered" and actually brings "a warm and disarming wit" to the show.&lt;ref name=profile/&gt; Jenkinson told David Knox of [[TV Tonight]] that "what really attracted me to her as a person and character was this endless positivity and optimistic outlook on life. Perhaps that comes from having experienced the worst that life has to offer. She has the attitude that things can only get better."&lt;ref name=call&gt;{{cite web|first=David|last=Knox|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2016/05/kate-jenkinson-got-the-wentworth-call.html|title=Kate Jenkinson got the Wentworth call|work=[[TV Tonight]]|accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Allie was billed as "an ice-addicted prostitute with a warm and engaging wit."&lt;ref name=call/&gt;

==Reception==
Elaine Atwell for [[AfterEllen]] branded the character "Kaz’s second-in-command, a rather comely blonde I have taken to calling 'Opposite-of-Vinegar-Tits'". Reflecting on Allie and Bea's show fight scenes Atwell pondered "so it is wrong, very wrong, how much I enjoyed this scene, right?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afterellen.com/tv/487773-wentworth-recap-4-10-whats-new-pussycat/3|title="Wentworth" recap (4.1): What’s new, Pussycat? - Page 3|work=[[AfterEllen]]|date=12 May 2016|accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atwell later observed more scenes between Allie and Bea and drew comparisons to the German-British film ''[[Imagine Me &amp; You]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afterellen.com/tv/491219-wentworth-recap-4-6-kween-bea-allie-cat/4|title="Wentworth" recap (4.6): Kween Bea and Allie Cat - Page 4|work=[[AfterEllen]]|date=9 June 2016|accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atwell added "Oh, it’s everything. I never hoped for this, never expected it, and it is all the sweeter for being a surprise. Not just sweet, it is a balm.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1866">'''Andrew Picken''' (1815–1845) was a British draughtsman and [[lithographer]].

==Life==
He was the second of the four sons of [[Andrew Picken]] the novelist. He became a pupil of [[Louis Haghe]], and in 1835 received from the [[Society of Arts]] their silver Isis medal for a lithographic drawing of the ruins of the [[Houses of Parliament]] after the [[Burning of Parliament|fire of 1834]]. In the same year he exhibited, at the [[Royal Academy]], a view of a tomb in [[Narbonne Cathedral]]. 
&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Picken, Andrew (1815-1845)|volume=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Picken then established himself as a lithographer, and had earned a reputation by the excellent quality of his work when in 1837 his health broke down. His lungs were affected, and he was sent to [[Madeira]]. During a residence of two years he drew a series of views of the island, which, on his return to England, were published under the title ''Madeira Illustrated'', 1840, with interesting letterpress edited from his notes by [[James Macaulay (editor)|James Macaulay]].&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;
[[File:Andrew Picken - Madeira Canyon of Sao Jorge.jpg|thumb|''Madeira, Canyon of Sao Jorge'', by Andrew Picken]]

After a short break Picken found it necessary to revisit Madeira; but his disease was terminal, he came back to London, and he died there on 24 June 1845. During his brief career he executed on stone a large number of landscapes, mainly illustrations to books of travel and private commissions.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

'''Andrew Stanislaus (Andrzej Stanisław) Ciechanowiecki''' (28 September 1924 – 2 November 2015), [[Dąbrowa Coat of Arms]], was a Polish-British nobleman, diplomat, prisoner and agent of [[Communist Poland]], economist, academic, art historian, philanthropist, art collector, antique dealer, antiquarian and exhibition curator. He was considered an authority on [[French Baroque and Classicism|French baroque]] sculpture in the second half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Warren. (2016). "Andrew Ciechanowiecki (1924-2015)" in ''The Sculpture Journal'' https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-4092015091/andrew-ciechanowiecki-1924-2015  available as a free preview only. [retrieved 2018.11.30.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

He was founder of the Ciechanowiecki Foundation at the [[Royal Castle in Warsaw]] (1986), Honorary Professor of the [[Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw]], member of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]], Honorary Member or Life Member of many learned societies both British and Polish, [[Society of Antiquaries of London|FSA]], member of the board of trustees of the [[Royal Castle in Warsaw]], and member of the board of the [[Lanckoroński Foundation]]. He was also a council member of the [[Princes Czartoryski Foundation]] from its establishment until July 2011, the Raczyński Foundation, and the Polish [[Historical and Literary Society]] in Paris (SHLP), chairman of the Polish-Belarusian Bilateral Commission for the Conservation of National Patrimony. 

He was a prominent member of the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]] and the [[Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George]]. His distinctions included the [[Order of the White Eagle (Poland)|Order of the White Eagle]] (1998), Grand Cross of [[Polonia Restituta]] and war medals, the [[Gloria Artis]] Gold Medal, among other awards.

While there is no doubt about his considerable academic and business achievements and his subsequent generosity in restoring some of Poland's pillaged cultural heritage, his wartime and immediate post-war activities remain unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Jerzy Pelc.

He was too young to fight in 1939. Surprisingly, there is no mention of the Warsaw Uprising. [Retrieved 2018.11.30]&lt;/ref&gt; A lack of clarity also applies to the origins of Ciechanowiecki's restored title of "[[Count]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Andrzej Rachuba, "Panowie z Ciechanowa"|title= Kronika Zamkowa 1-2/59-60|page=33|date = 2010|url = http://mazowsze.hist.pl/16/Kronika_Zamkowa/356/2010/12307/}} In Polish with an English summary. The author believes in the absence of historical evidence, it is likely one or other of the Ciechanowiecki ancestors could simply have "conferred a foreign title upon himself" to hark back to the family's former grander status.

==Biography==
===Early life to 1945===
Andrew Ciechanowiecki was born in [[Warsaw]] in 1924, the only child of Jerzy Stanisław Ciechanowiecki, a Polish diplomat, and Matilda,"Tilly", née Countess Osiecimska-Hutten-Czapska, a prominent figure in the élite social circles of pre-war [[Warsaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.sejm-wielki.pl/b/sw.13358|author = Marek Jerzy Minakowski|title = Potomkowie Sejmu Wielkiego: Andrzej, hr. Ciechanowiecki z Ciechanowca, h. Dąbrowa (ID: sw. 13358)}} Ciechanowiecki's noble Lineage. &lt;/ref&gt; On his father's side, he came from an impoverished [[Masovia]]n noble and senatorial family, established in [[Belarus]], and who had recently lost their landed estates as a result of the [[Treaty of Riga]] (1921), when they fell to Soviet control. He had spent his early childhood in [[Budapest]], where his father died at the early age of 37 while working at the Polish embassy, obliging the family to return to Warsaw. There he attended the ''[[Mikołaj Rey]]'' Primary School followed by the ''[[Gimnazjum i Liceum im. Stefana Batorego (Warsaw, Poland)|Stefan Batory Gimnazjum &amp; Liceum]]''. The household came to be dominated by his widowed mother and maternal grandmother and their social connections. Ciechanowiecki later attributed his multilingual skills and lifelong academic discipline to their influence.&lt;ref name=Kossowska&gt;{{cite journal|title= Kultura|author = Stefania Kossowska "Rozmowa z Dr. Andrzejem Ciechanowieckim"|url = http://static.kulturaparyska.com/attachments/66/1a/0ea10586245147d67e952cacad5d85a70a86ccdd.pdf#page=40|pages = 78-90|date = 1993|volume = 555/12|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ciechanowiecki's war===
[[File:Moładaŭ, Skirmunt. Моладаў, Скірмунт (N. Orda, 11.06.1864) .jpg|thumb|left|Skirmunt Palace in [[Moładava|Mołodów]], watercolour by [[Napoleon Orda]] 1864]]
The [[German invasion of Poland]] began on 1st September 1939. On the advice - seriously flawed, as it turned out - of British general, Sir [[Adrian Carton de Wiart]], resident in Poland, on 5th September, the family fled East. They went to stay in [[Moładava|Mołodów]], [[Polesie Voivodeship]] on the estate of Henryk Skirmunt and his sister, Maria, the younger siblings of [[Konstanty Skirmunt]], Polish ambassador in [[London]] (1919-1934). The plan had been to overwinter there and that Ciechanowiecki should attend school in nearby [[Pinsk]].{{r|Kossowska}} On 17th September invading [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Soviet units]] laid siege to the small town. Elements of local [[Belarus#Belarusyan Soviet Socialist Republic|Belarusian]] activists presented an [[ultimatum]] to the Skirmunts: that the 150 Polish military police stationed on their estate should lay down their arms or all the buildings would be set alight. The unworldly Skirmunts fell for the trap; the police were all shot with their own weapons, the elderly Skirmunts were slaughtered in the woods and all the premises looted.&lt;ref&gt;Michał Aniszewski (2007) "Jak zgineli Skirmunttowie i Polscy Policjanci". ''Echa Polesia'' [http://polesie.org/2655/jak-zgineli-w-molodowie-skirmunttowie-i-polscy-policjanci/] [retrieved 2018.12.01.]&lt;/ref&gt; Ciechanowiecki and his family managed to flee the horror with the retreating Polish columns of general [[Franciszek Kleeberg]]. Ciechanowiecki later stated laconically: ''"...coś tam pomagałem, mam nawet krzyż za kampanię wrześniową jako ochotnik."'' - ''I helped out a bit, I even have a cross for the [[September campaign]], as a volunteer.''{{r|Kossowska}} They travelled via [[Kamien Koszyrski]] to [[Kowel]], then  by train, strafed by Soviet planes, on to [[Lwów]]. There they suffered a harsh winter and a failed attempt in December to cross the ''Green frontier'' into [[Romania]]. They left the city in March 1940, just two days ahead of the [[KGB]]'s arrival to start mass [[Soviet deportations|deportations]]. Recrossing the new ''frontier'', they finally returned to Warsaw in early May 1940.{{r|Kossowska}}

Back at his old school, he obtained his [[baccalauréat]] in 1942 through "clandestine classes", ''Komplety'', together with classmates later to become "luminaries" of Polish higher education such as, Professors: [[Jerzy Kroh]], J.A. Miłobędzki, J. Pelc and K. Szaniawski. The class was later dubbed the "professorial cohort"; of the group, only Ciechanowiecki did not become a professor, he later quipped.{{r|Kossowska}} After leaving school he had to look for paid employment, did some charity work and enrolled on a degree course at the school of Professor [[Edward Lipiński]], an underground version of the earlier [[Warsaw School of Economics|SGH]]. To "distract" himself from difficult wartime conditions he decided to join an Art History course at the ''Uniwersytet Ziem Zachodnich'' (Western University) unaware of how portentous it would become. It enabled him to attend the lectures of professor [[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]] "on themes like, happiness, in the light of a [[Carbide lamp]] in a chilly suburban room."{{r|Kossowska}} In between these many courses, he attended [[Home Army]] training classes for cadets. 

At some stage he became secretary to the politician, [[Adam Ronikier]], an interlocutor with the German high command in occupied Warsaw. Presumably he remained in that position for the 63 day duration of the [[Warsaw Uprising]] that erupted on 1st August 1944. After the collapse of the Warsaw Uprising and conclusion of hostilities on 5th October, he did not leave the battered capital with the columns of captive Home Army fighters nor with the destitute civilian population. He left ten days later with the [[Red cross]]. By his own account, he visited [[Pruszków]], the vast German holding camp for [[POW]]s and "went on Home Army missions in the provinces".{{r|Kossowska}} He went to Kraków, where he was briefly arrested by the Germans, then released. Such circumstances were extraordinary for a young intelligent man of his age at that time, who was likely to have been a resistance member and therefore a suspect, unless he had "special protection". His bid to travel with Ronikier was refused and by the end of January 1945 he was back in Warsaw. His claim to have worked for a short spell with the anti-communist ''[[Freedom and Independence]]'' organisation, (Wolność i Niezawisłość), until the spring of 1945 does not stand up since it was not founded till September of that year.&lt;ref&gt;Dunin.

===Polish People’s Republic===
Having decided not to escape to the West, in June 1945 he applied to the newly installed government of the [[People’s Republic of Poland]] to join the [[MSZ| Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]. Because of his knowledge of several languages, aged just 21, he was employed in the rank of Counsellor. He was assigned as Chief of Protocol to the Ministry of Shipping &amp; Foreign Trade. In that capacity he participated in numerous negotiations with foreign delegations in Warsaw.{{r|Kossowska}} In August 1945 he was a member of the Polish Delegation, as its interpreter, to the [[UNRRA]] Conference held in [[London]]. In the autumn of that year he was appointed counsellor to the embassy in [[the Hague]], but that appointment was cancelled for political reasons, due to his origins and his alleged Home Army past. He returned to [[Kraków]] to complete his studies – firstly at the Academy of Economics, obtaining his degree in 1947 and then in the Faculty of History of Art of the [[Jagiellonian University]], gaining his Master of Arts degree in March 1950. At the same time, he was involved in student activities and was the founder of the ''Club of the Logophagoi'', (Klub Logofagów), a debating society which comprised many prominent students and young scholars - some eminent politicians and scholars were to emerge from its ranks. The club was also the prototype for later clubs of the [[Catholic Intellectuals Club|Catholic intelligentsia]], which was preparing for the fall of Communism.

====Imprisonment====
Having completed his studies, he was almost immediately appointed lecturer at the Institute of History of Art. Work on his doctoral thesis was interrupted by his arrest on 22 October 1950. Transported immediately to Warsaw in connection with the staged "British Embassy" [[Show trial]] and after lengthy interrogations, he was sentenced to ten years in prison in February 1952 for allegedly helping British and Vatican spies, as well as for extending his underground activities beyond the official date for disclosure, which, in any case, would probably have led to an earlier arrest. He spent five years and four months in prison in difficult conditions – firstly on remand in the cellars of the [[Ministry of Public Security (Poland)|Ministry of Public Security]] in Koszykowa Street, and later in the infamous [[Mokotów Prison]], both in Warsaw, and finally – after sentencing – in the prisons of [[Rawicz]] and [[Wronki]].&lt;ref&gt;Władysław Bartoszewski &amp; Andrzej Friszke. ''Życie trudne. lecz nie nudne. Ze wspomnień Polaka w XX wieku''. Publisher Otwarte. 2012.
{{ISBN|978-8324019359}}. p.191&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter two he actively organised spiritual help for his fellow prisoners. Having got himself work in the prison hospital, he was instrumental in forging documents enabling the early release of a very large number of political prisoners. He himself was released on 6 March 1956 less than midway through his sentence. He was later cleared of all charges, probably in exchange for becoming an informer, especially on foreign trips.&lt;ref&gt; ''Andrzej Ciechanowiecki i Strażnicy Pamięci'' (2015) extracts from Ciechanowiecki's "Security File" (1956-8), where his pseudonym was "Stanisław" and interviews with him are reported by his communist handlers. As for the Warsaw Uprising, there was only the vaguest mention of some contact with the NSZ. https://lustratorpolski.wordpress.com/2015/10/28/andrzej-ciechanowiecki-i-straznicy-pamieci/ [retrieved 2018.11.30]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic pursuits===
Returning to Kraków, he took up his doctoral thesis and also worked on other research projects. He was a consultant at the [[Wawel Castle]] Museum and also a curator at the Castle Museum in [[Łańcut]]. His academic interests concentrated on the history of furniture and later on Kraków [[Baroque]] silver, as well as on the culture of the former [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Commonwealth of Poland]]. In 1958 he won a travel scholarship from the [[Ford Foundation]] and the [[British Council]], leaving the country on 22 July of that year, presumably, not thinking that it would mean a 19 year break with his homeland. He did, however, take the precaution of bringing with him all his materials relating to his research, the subject of his doctoral thesis. Later he completed another thesis at [[Tübingen University]], Germany.

==Activities in the West==
After a 3-month stay in Great Britain, he spent another six months in the United States, visiting museums and lecturing on Polish culture.  He had offers of work and further scholarships, but he decided to return to Europe, where in the autumn of 1959 he enrolled at the University of Tübingen to prepare a further doctoral thesis, on a new topic, and for which he had fortunately taken most of the materials with him from Kraków. At the same time, he taught Polish Culture for two [[semester]]s and was a lecturer in Polish Language. A Doctorate in Philosophy ([[magna cum laude]]) was conferred on him at the [[Eberhard Karls University]] in Tübingen in July 1960. His dissertation ''Michał Kazimierz Ogiński und sein Musenhof zu Słonim'' was published in German in 1961. As a recognised work of reference, it was also translated into Belarusian in two editions (1993 and 2006).  He later spent a few months in Portugal on a [[Gulbenkian Foundation]] scholarship, the results of which were articles on [[Portuguese art|Portuguese furniture]].

===Art dealership===
In 1961, after much soul-searching, he decided to settle permanently in [[London]], where he had been offered a directorship in the newly founded firm ''Mallett at Bourdon House'', a subsidiary of Mallet &amp; Son&lt;ref&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20090709231048/http://www.mallettantiques.com/ Mallett &amp; Son]''&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Bond Street]]. That same year, with the help of Polish friends already permanently resident in the United Kingdom, he arranged for his mother, Matylda, to whom he was devoted to come and join him in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Władysław Bartoszewski, &amp; Michał Komar. ''Bóg, honor, obczyzna''. Warsaw: Dom Wydawniczy PWN, 2017. {{ISBN|978-8377055694}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a British subject in 1967.  

During his time at Mallett's, he organised four innovative exhibitions on sculpture, mainly of the forgotten French 19th century, which were received with much critical acclaim. In 1965 he was invited to be co-organiser and co-owner of the newly opened London branch in [[Jermyn Street]] of the French ''Heim Gallery''. Gradually he bought out his partners and finally became the gallery's sole owner.&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Barnes. "Other Lives" Guardian Obituary'' 2016.01.07., https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jan/07/andrew-ciechanowiecki-obituary'' [retrieved 2018.11.30]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Izabella Zuralski. Ed. Online Archive California. "Finding Aid for the Heim gallery archive." http://pdf.oac.cdlib.org/pdf/getty/spcoll/910004.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 he sold the Heim Gallery and opened a smaller specialist business named, ''The Old Masters Gallery'', located opposite his previous gallery in Jermyn Street. He dealt from there until 1995, when as a result of a serious stroke he had to close the gallery and retire from business.

The innovative catalogues of the Heim Gallery became well known throughout the world and are to this day considered source material. They were copied by the main London auction houses and later by private galleries. He was also the first dealer in London for decades to present paintings, mainly Italian and French, from the 16th to the 19th centuries, together with sculpture which had been neglected for a long time. Sculpture became his main interest and the main element of the Heim Gallery's activities. The gallery specialised in Baroque and Neoclassical, as well as 19th-century art. The openings of exhibitions at the Heim Gallery were also innovative and became social and academic events in London. They were often opened in the presence of senior members of the Royal Family, twice by [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]], members of the Government, ambassadors, and attended by scholars, society and museum directors.{{Fact|date=November 2018}}

In the professional field, Ciechanowiecki achieved major successes. He was the owner of one of the leading galleries of classical art in London, the organiser of over 40 significant exhibitions, which are still relevant today, was the initiator of interest in Baroque and Neoclassical art, especially  French baroque sculpture. His enthusiasm for this period led to exports to major American and Continental museums. He was also the initiator and co-organiser of many important international exhibitions, including ''Giovanni Bologna'' (Edinburgh, London and Vienna), ''The Twilight of the Medici'' (Detroit, Florence), or ''The Golden Age of Naples'' (Naples and Detroit). He served on the Committees of other international exhibitions, which was unusual for a dealer in those days.

In his commercial activities, Ciechanowiecki always gave preference to British museums, in their pick of items at keen prices. This was his way of repaying a debt, in his own words, ''to the country of [his] happy adoption''.{{Fact|date=December 2018}}

===Art curator and collector===
Finally, having established a good income stream, he began collecting works of Polish art and art connected with Poland, in the hope that they would ultimately reach his homeland. He was also the co-organiser of three major exhibitions including: ''Treasures of a Polish King'' at the [[Dulwich Gallery]] in London in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=A. Rottermund|title = Treasures of a Polish King: Stanislaus August as Patron and Collector||publisher = Dulwich Picture Gallery|date=	31 May 1992|pages = 97 |ISBN=	9780950156460}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next was the exhibition on ''Polish Expressionism and The Land of the Winged Horsemen'' in museums in the USA. Travelling to the United States several times a year, he lectured extensively on the history of Polish Culture, particularly in [[Detroit]], where he contributed to the creation of a Polish Section at the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]]. He also lectured in Britain and had articles published in various scholarly magazines.&lt;ref&gt;A.Ciechanowiecki/B.O. Jeżewski, ''Polonika na Wyspach Brytyjskich'', Londyn  1965.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, when his collections had grown considerably in quantity (and from which he had already donated a number of items to Polish museums), he set up the ''Ciechanowiecki Foundation at the Royal Castle'' in Warsaw. The foundation distributes its holdings to other Polish museums on long-term loan, but predominantly it has been furnishing the rebuilt ''Royal Castle''. He also gave the foundation a large library, his archives and a not inconsiderable sum for the upkeep of the collections. Since 1986 he had been enriching the foundation with numerous donations of significant importance, as well as books and archival material.

==Knight of Malta==
Ciechanowiecki had petitioned from Poland, as the first Pole from behind the [[Iron Curtain]], and was probably among the first petitioners from Eastern Europe, to seek membership of the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta|Sovereign &amp; Military Order of Malta]], [[SMOM]], in 1957, although usually it is by invitation only. He was accepted into its ranks a year later by the Polish Association of the Order, then in exile. He later became its deputy chancellor, to [[Emeryk August Hutten-Czapski]] for 10 years, and vice-president until 1997.&lt;ref&gt;''Association of Polish Knights of Malta - United Kingdom'' http://www.apkmuk.co.uk/index.php?searchword=Andrzej+Ciechanowiec&amp;ordering=&amp;searchphrase=all&amp;Itemid=1&amp;option=com_search&lt;/ref&gt; He initiated under its aegis the creation of a care home, ''Kolbe House'', for Polish elderly in the outskirts of London, which later transferred to Warsaw, where it became far more significant. He rose through the ranks of the Order, finally becoming [[Bailiff Grand Cross of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem]].

He was also very active in various dynastic orders, especially those of the [[Bourbon-Two Sicilies]] dynasty, creating delegations to Poland, Great Britain and Ireland of the [[Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George]], serving under Grand Master, The [[Duke of Castro]] on the Order's Council in [[Rome]].  He rose through the ranks and held uniquely the honours of Knight of the [[Order of St Januarius]], Bailiff Grand Cross of Justice of the [[Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George]] with Collar and Grand Cross of the [[Royal Order of Francis I]].

He later formed the Delegation of the [[Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus|Order of St Maurice &amp; St Lazarus]] of the Royal [[House of Savoy]] in the UK and in recent years helped to establish the Tuscan Dynastic [[Order of Saint Stephen|Orders of St Stephen]] and that of St Joseph in Britain. He was also very close to the former Russian Imperial House and was decorated with the highest Orders of [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]].

His position in the Order of Malta and his personal relationships with the heads of former ruling houses as well as his quasi diplomatic activities in the fields of culture and ecclesiastical affairs were the grounds on which the last [[King of Italy]], [[Umberto II]], who although in exile, had kept  his royal prerogatives in the field of [[Heraldry]] and confirmed Ciechanowiecki's "hereditary right" to use a [[Count|comital title]] in 1975 - a foreign title bestowed on a family member more than 200 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Andrzej Rachuba, "Panowie z Ciechanowa"|title= Kronika Zamkowa 1-2/59-60|page=33|date = 2010|url = http://mazowsze.hist.pl/16/Kronika_Zamkowa/356/2010/12307/}} In Polish with an English summary. The author shows it is likely a Ciechanowiecki ancestor either received a fashionable noble title, in exchange for money, while travelling  on ''the Grand Tour'' in Western Europe or, simply "conferred it upon himself" to hark back to a former higher status. [retrieved 2018.11.30.]&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later the Order of Malta confirmed this usage in all pertinent acts of the order internationally, as it maintains diplomatic relations with more than 100 sovereign states.

[[File:KościółŚwMaksymilianaKolbego-Mistrzejowice-POL, Kraków (Cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Church of St. [[Maksymilian Kolbe]], Kraków]]
On behalf of the Polish Association of ''SMOM'' in the UK, he did much to support Polish charities during [[Martial law in Poland]] (1991-2), funded many scholarships and, on behalf of the Polish Association of the Knights of Malta contributed to the costs for the construction of the Church of St [[Maximilian Kolbe]] in the industrial suburb of [[Mistrzejowice]] on the outskirts of Kraków.&lt;ref&gt;History of the Parish church of St. Maksymilian Kolbe http://www.mistrzejowice.net/Historia,ke/Budynek-Kosciola,aca.html (in Polish) [retrieved 2018.11.30.]&lt;/ref&gt; It was the second church to be built in a secular Communist city (1975-1983). Its interior décor is mainly sculptural. He worked closely with Prof. Gustaw Ziemła, a noted Polish sculptor, to produce the décor of the [[Lady chapel]], which has entered the canon of Polish post-war sculpture.

==Recognition of the Jewish contribution==
As co-founder of the Page of History Foundation, (Fundacja Karta z Dziejów), which commemorates the centuries of Jewish participation in the culture and life of Poland, he contributed financially and as its artistic advisor to the erection of the monument "The Ten Commandments" in Łódź and the statue of "David the Psalmist" in Zamość, both the work of Gustaw Zemła. Other works, sponsored by the foundation, are in the pipeline. He also deposited works of art from his own collections to decorate several Polish Embassies.

==Philanthropy in Poland==
[[File:Royal Castle Warsaw 1945.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Ruins of the [[Warsaw Castle|Royal Castle Warsaw]], 1945]]
[[File:Crown Prince's Apartment RCW.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Restored royal apartment, [[Warsaw Castle|Royal Castle Warsaw]]]]
Ciechanowiecki began to travel to Poland again in 1977, 19 years after his intended nine-month foreign trip on a scholarship. He had remained in close touch with his professors and colleagues in Poland and was particularly involved – even from London – in the rebuilding of the Royal Castle in Warsaw.  The foundation he created in 1986, now consisting of some 3000 items including paintings, drawings, furniture, silverware, textiles, miniatures, medals and jewels, is the single greatest donation that the Royal Castle in Warsaw has ever received. The foundation does not aim to have a building or rooms named after itself. It distributes works of art to other museums in Poland, depending on the needs of those institutions, but with priority given to the Royal Castle in Warsaw, which he has helped considerably in furnishing and decorating. The foundation has also financed various important publications, including the magisterial work on the history of Polish [[Stately home|stately homes]] in the [[Kresy]] region of the [[Polish Second Republic]], pre-war Poland, by Roman Aftanazy, 1st edition 1986, 2nd edition 1993, among other works.

===Activities in Belarus===
Andrew Ciechanowiecki, ever aware of the land of his Polish ancestors – namely, the territory of the former [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] and [[Belarus]] - was involved with the Belarusian émigré community in London and their cultural establishment. He also met scholars visiting London from Belarus, corresponded with them, and in 1987 was invited by its government to visit Belarus. As it was already autumn of that year, the visit was postponed till 1988. The visit was officially defined as "in the footsteps of the family": landing in [[St Petersburg]], travelling to [[Minsk]], via the family's former estates near [[Vitebsk]] and [[Polatsk]], [[Mstsislau]] and [[Mahiliou]]. The return journey took him back to Minsk with a departure from [[Moscow]]. The fortnight's trip was during the short-lived period of political [[Détente]]. Many contacts were made and other trips to Belarus ensued, in collaboration with the appropriate Polish and British authorities advised. This all led to Ciechanowiecki's involvement in the preservation and conservation of historical monuments in Belarus, primarily the princely [[Radzivil]] residence in [[Niasvizh]] and its [[Collegiate Church]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Ciechanowiecki, ''Nieśwież – międzynarodowy ośrodek kultury na Białorusi od XVI do XX wieku'', Warszawa 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further to the decision of both Governments, Ciechanowiecki was appointed chairman of the Polish-Belarusian Bilateral Commission for the Conservation of the National Patrimony in 1993, and he continued as honorary chairman of this body, even latterly chairing meetings on several occasions. He was elected honorary chairman of the Belarusian Nobility Association, (which he founded), and honorary member of the International Association of Belarusian Studies, which he had also founded and chaired some of their meetings in Niasvizh, Minsk, Warsaw and Venice.&lt;ref&gt;Tadeusz Bernatowicz. "Dziedzictwo Kulturowe na Białorusi w Inicjatywach i Działalności Profesora Andrzeja Ciechanowieckiego." ''Kronika Zamkowa''. 1-2/59-60, 37-46. 2010.
&lt;/ref&gt;

He was appointed an honorary member of the Institute of History of the [[Belarusian Academy of Sciences]], and finally received an Honorary Doctorate from the [[Belarusian State University]] in Minsk.  He is quite active in Belarusian-British relations, being ''inter alia'' vice-president of the [[Anglo-Belarusian Society]] in London. He also made some significant gifts to Belarusian museums and, above all, he donated some reliquaries of Belarusian Catholic saints to churches in Belarus, and acted as a contact between the [[Belarusian Orthodox Church]] and the [[Holy See|Vatican]].

==Old age and death==
In 1995 Ciechanowiecki suffered a severe stroke, which deprived him of the use of his legs. He became confined to a wheelchair for the last twenty years of his life. However, he remained intellectually very active in the pursuit of his many interests. Above all, he continued with his numerous connections with Poland, where he still travelled several times a year to attend academic meetings, including those of his own Foundation, as well as to deal with the publication of various books, and also to pursue his para-diplomatic and political activities. 

Ciechanowiecki never married and was the last of his line. He died in London on 2 November 2015, aged 91. After a funeral service at the [[Brompton Oratory]], London, his remains were taken to their final resting place in the ''crypt of the Knights of Malta'' in the parish church of Mistrzejowice, Kraków.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/12066787/Count-Andrew-Ciechanowiecki-obituary.html|title=Count Andrew Ciechanowiecki,Telegraph Obituary|date=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.pl/1/11/Artykul/227324,Patron-of-the-arts-and-WWII-resistance-veteran-Ciechanowiecki-dies|title=Patron of the arts and WWII resistance veteran Ciechanowiecki dies|work=Polskie Radio dla Zagranicy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Barrie Weaver''' is an [[industrial designer]] living in London.

==Early life==
Born in Kent, Weaver spent his early years in the Middle East where his father was posted as a director of [[ICAO]]. Returning to London to complete his education, he gained a BA in Industrial Design Engineering at the [[Central School of Art]].

==Work==
Weaver's professional career began with [[Terence Conran]] creating products for [[Habitat]] shops before moving to [[Pentagram (design studio)|Pentagram Design]]'s London office, mentored by [[Kenneth Grange]] and [[Alan Fletcher (graphic designer)|Alan Fletcher]], both of whom he cites as powerful influences.

His independent career started by joining forces with Jos Roberts, a fellow Central student, to form Roberts Weaver Design. Early commissions included the UK's first mass-produced computer terminal for Newbury Labs (part of the [[Grundy NewBrain]] project) and the Implanter 9000 for [[Applied Materials]].

Integrating computers into the workplace became a key focus with dealing rooms for Banks worldwide, the [[Goonhilly Satellite Earth Station]], and with [[Nixdorf Computer AG|Nixdorf]], New York City's first touch-screen voting booth.

Notably, Weaver spotted the potential of [[Jonathan Ive]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/MR+MAC%3B+MEET+THE+MAN+WHO+IS+THE+DAVID+BECKHAM+OF+DESIGN.-a0102785514 Jonathan Ive's first job]&lt;/ref&gt; and gave him his first job. Ive became the Senior Vice President of Industrial Design at [[Apple Inc]] and is internationally renowned as the principal designer of the iMac, iPod and the iPhone.

In the UK Weaver obtained commissions from [[BT Group]], [[Amstrad]], [[Marks &amp; Spencer]], [[Marconi Company|Marconi]], [[Boots]], [[Ransomes, Sims &amp; Jefferies|Ransomes]] and [[KEF]] before venturing East to land projects with [[Hitachi]], [[Panasonic]], [[Samsung]], [[Nissan]], [[Subaru]], [[LG]], [[Zebra]].
 
Under Weaver's guidance the team has won numerous [[Design Council]], [[iF product design award]], [[Red Dot]], and [[Norwegian Design Council]] awards.
 
In 1990, Weaver received the [[Prince Philip Designers Prize]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designcouncil.org.uk/about-us/Prince-Philip-Designers-Prize/19891998/ Prince Philip Designer Prize] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411183308/http://www.designcouncil.org.uk/about-us/Prince-Philip-Designers-Prize/19891998/ |date=April 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in recognition of his work. Weaver is a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Arts]] and a Fellow of the [[Chartered Society of Designers]]. He served on the [[Design Council]] from 1989 to 1995.

They are best known for their extensive series of photographic images, or [[Typology (urban planning and architecture)|typologies]], of industrial buildings and structures, often organised in grids. As the founders of what has come to be known as the ‘Becher school’ or the ‘Düsseldorf School’ they influenced generations of documentary photographers and artists.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.artsy.net/gene/dusseldorf-school-of-photography&lt;/ref&gt; They have been awarded the [[Erasmus Prize]] and the [[Hasselblad Award]].

== Biography ==
Bernd Becher was born in [[Siegen]].  He studied painting at the Staatliche Akademie der Bildenden Künste Stuttgart from 1953 to 1956, then [[typography]] under Karl Rössing at the [[Kunstakademie Düsseldorf]] from 1959 to 1961. Hilla Becher was born in [[Potsdam]]. Prior to Hilla's time studying [[photography]] at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf from 1958 to 1961, she had completed an apprenticeship as a photographer in her native Potsdam. Both began working as freelance photographers for the Troost Advertising Agency in Düsseldorf, concentrating on product photography.

The couple married in 1961.

== Work ==
Meeting as students at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf in 1957, Bernd and Hilla Becher first collaborated on photographing and documenting the disappearing German [[industrial architecture]] in 1959. The [[Ruhr|Ruhr Valley]], where Becher’s family had worked in the steel and mining industries, was their initial focus. They were fascinated by the similar shapes in which certain buildings were designed. After collating thousands of pictures of individual structures, they noticed that the various edifices – of cooling towers, gas tanks and coal bunkers, for instance – shared many distinctive formal qualities. In addition, they were intrigued by the fact that so many of these industrial buildings seemed to have been built with a great deal of attention toward design.

Together, the Bechers went out with a large 8 x 10-inch view camera and photographed these buildings from a number of different angles, but always with a straightforward "objective" point of view. They shot only on overcast days, so as to avoid shadows, and early in the morning during the seasons of spring and fall. Objects included barns, water towers, coal tipples, cooling towers, grain elevators, coal bunkers, coke ovens, oil refineries, blast furnaces, gas tanks, storage silos, and warehouses. At each site the Bechers also created overall landscape views of the entire plant, which set the structures in their context and show how they relate to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moma.org/d/c/press_releases/W1siZiIsIjM4NzE0OCJdXQ.pdf?sha=3e278f8f09733b6e|title=BERND AND HILLA BECHER’S PHOTOGRAPHS OF INDUSTRIAL SITES SHOWN IN MoMA EXHIBITION|last=|first=|date=21 May 2008|website=Museum of Modern Art|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170326193352/https://www.moma.org/d/c/press_releases/W1siZiIsIjM4NzE0OCJdXQ.pdf?sha=3e278f8f09733b6e|archive-date=26 March 2017|dead-url=|access-date=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/95 Bernd and Hilla Becher: Landscape/Typology, May 21 – August 25, 2008] Museum of Modern Art, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; They excluded any details that would detract from the central theme and instead set up comparisons of viewpoint and lighting through which the eye is led to the basic structural pattern of the images being compared.&lt;ref name="Bernd and Hilla Becher"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=8095 Bernd and Hilla Becher] [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York.&lt;/ref&gt; This principle, which is allied to the philosophy underlying the [[New Topographics]] movement, is most obvious in the two published series, 
''Anonyme Skulpturen: Eine Typologie technischer Bauten'' and ''Typologien, Industrieller Bau, 1963–1975'', in which the images are contrasted in groups of three.&lt;ref name="Bernd and Hilla Becher"/&gt; Another early project, which they pursued for nearly two decades, was published as ''Framework Houses'' (Schirmer/Mosel) in 1977, a visual catalog of types of structures, an approach that characterized much of their work.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Gefter (June 26, 2007), [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/26/arts/26becher.html Bernd Becher, 75, Photographer of German Industrial Landscape, Dies] ''[[The New York Times]]''. [https://web.archive.org/web/20170326193623/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/26/arts/26becher.html Archived.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In drawing attention to the cultural dimension of industrial architecture, their work also highlighted the need for preservation of these buildings. On the couple's initiative the [[Zollern II/IV Colliery]] at [[Dortmund|Dortmund-Bovinghausen]] in the Ruhr, for the most part an [[art-deco]] structure, was designated a protected landmark.

The Bechers also photographed outside Germany, including from 1965 buildings in Great Britain, France, Belgium and later in the United States. In 1966, they undertook a six-month journey through England and south Wales, taking hundreds of photographs of the coal industry around Liverpool, Manchester, Sheffield, Nottingham and the Rhondda Valley.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Gabriele Conrath-Scholl and Susanne Lange (20 July 2007), [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/jul/20/guardianobituaries.germany Obituary: Bernd Becher] ''The Guardian''. [https://web.archive.org/web/20170326194116/https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/jul/20/guardianobituaries.germany Archived.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, they traveled to North America for the first time, touring sites in New Jersey, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and southern Ontario, depicting a range of industrial structures, from coal breakers to wooden winding towers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lacma.org/art/nt-becher.aspx New Topographics: Photographs of a Man-Altered Landscape, October 25, 2009 – January 3, 2010] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205051745/http://www.lacma.org/art/nt-becher.aspx |date=December 5, 2010 }} [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bechers exhibited and published their single-image [[gelatin silver print]]s, grouped by subject, in a grid of six, nine, or fifteen. By the mid-1960s the Bechers had settled on a preferred presentational mode: the images of structures with similar functions are then displayed side by side to invite viewers to compare their forms and designs based on function, regional idiosyncrasies, or the age of the structures. The Bechers used the term “typology” to describe these ordered sets of photographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bernd Becher |work=The Times |date=July 3, 2007 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article2015817.ece}} Subscription required for online access.&lt;/ref&gt; The works’ titles are pithy and captions note only time and location.&lt;ref&gt;[Bernd &amp; Hilla Becher: ''Six Spherical Gasholders'', 1972–1996] Christie’s, 5 May 2006, New York, Rockefeller Plaza.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989–91, for an exhibition at the [[Dia Art Foundation]] in New York, the Bechers introduced a second format into their oeuvre: single images that are larger in size — twenty-four by twenty inches — and presented individually, rather than as gridded tableaux.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.diaart.org/program/exhibitions-projects/bernd-and-hilla-becher-collection-display|title=Bernd and Hilla Becher|last=|first=|date=|website=Dia Art Foundation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170326195443/http://www.diaart.org/program/exhibitions-projects/bernd-and-hilla-becher-collection-display|archive-date=26 March 2017|dead-url=|access-date=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, Bernd Becher started teaching photography at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf (policy matters prevented Hilla's simultaneous appointment), where he remained on the faculty until 1996. Before him, photography had been excluded from what was largely a school for painters. He influenced students that later made a name for themselves in the photography world. Former students of Bernd's included [[Andreas Gursky]], [[Thomas Ruff]], [[Thomas Struth]], [[Candida Höfer]], [[Axel Hütte]] and [[Elger Esser]]. Bernd died in [[Rostock]].

After Bernd Becher's death, his widow Hilla continued to reassemble their works, mostly using existing photographs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Influence===
The Becher school has influenced a number of (mainly) German photographers including [[Laurenz Berges]], [[Andreas Gursky]], [[Candida Höfer]], [[Axel Hütte]], Simone Nieweg, [[Thomas Ruff]], [[Thomas Struth]] and Petra Wunderlich.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriele Conrath-Scholl and Susanne Lange, [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/jul/20/guardianobituaries.germany "Obituary: Bernd Becher, Photographer who documented industrial architecture with style and precision"], ''The Guardian''&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian [[Edward Burtynsky]] also works in a similar mode. Aside from its vital documentary and analytical qualities, the Becher's long-term project has also had a considerable impact on [[Minimalism]] and [[Conceptual Art]] since the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hamburgerbahnhof.de/exhibition.php?id=8011&amp;lang=en Bernd and Hilla Becher: Typologies of Industrial Buildings, 26 August 2005 – 8 January 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721073531/http://www.hamburgerbahnhof.de/exhibition.php?id=8011&amp;lang=en |date=July 21, 2011 }} Hamburger Bahnhof – Museum für Gegenwart, Berlin&lt;/ref&gt;

===Famous photographs===
* ''Industrial Facade #23'', c1980.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}
* ''Cooling towers, Wood n B'', 1976. (Having sold for $150,000 at auction in 2004, it is one of the couple's highest selling works.)

== Exhibitions ==
The Bechers had their first gallery exhibition in 1963 at the Galerie Ruth Nohl in Siegen. Their work became better known in the United States with the publication of their book ''Anonyme Skulpturen'' (Anonymous Sculptures) in 1970. The Bechers were shown at the [[George Eastman House]] and in solo exhibitions at [[Sonnabend Gallery]], New York, in 1972. In 1974, the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]], London, organized an exhibition of their work, which toured the United Kingdom. The couple was invited to participate in [[Documenta]] 5, 6, 7, and 11 in Kassel in 1972, 1977, 1982 and 2002, and at the [[Bienal de São Paulo]] in 1977. The [[Van Abbemuseum|Stedelijk Van Abbemuseum]], Eindhoven, organized a retrospective of the artists’ work in 1981. In 1985 the artists had a major museum exhibition, which traveled to the [[Museum Folkwang]], Essen, [[Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]], and Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Liège, Belgium. In 1991 the artists won the Leone d’Oro award for sculpture at the [[Venice Biennale]]. The Venice installation was reworked later in 1991, in a retrospective exhibition at the [[Kölnischer Kunstverein]], Cologne. The Typologies installation was exhibited in 1994 at the [[Ydessa Hendeles Art Foundation]], Toronto, and at the [[Westphalian State Museum of Art and Cultural History|Westfälisches Landesmuseum für Kunst und Kulturgeschichte]] in Münster. Other retrospectives of the couple’s work have been organized by the Photographische Sammlung/SK Stiftung Kulture in Cologne (1999 and 2003), [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in Paris (2005) and [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York (2008).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/show-full/bio/?artist_name=Bernd%20and%20Hilla%20Becher Bernd and Hilla Becher] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402054516/http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/show-full/bio/?artist_name=Bernd%20and%20Hilla%20Becher |date=April 2, 2012 }} Guggenheim Collection.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Hilla Becher curated "August Sander/Bernd and Hilla Becher: ‘A Dialogue’" at Bruce Silverstein Gallery in New York. Unlike previous displays, the Bechers’ architectural images were displayed as singular “portraits” while Sander’s photographs of people were represented as typological grids.&lt;ref&gt;Vicki Goldberg (May 22, 2014), [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/23/arts/design/august-sander-bernd-and-hilla-becher-a-dialogue.html August Sander/Bernd and Hilla Becher: ‘A Dialogue’] ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

|footnotes = {{smallsup|1}}According to estimates commissioned in 2008 by the [[National Security Council (Turkey)|National Security Council of Turkey]] (''Milli Güvenlik Kurulu'') some 2,000,000 Turkish citizens are of Bosniak ancestry as mainly descended from Bosniak emigrants in the 19th and early 20th century.

{{Bosniaks}}

The '''Bosniaks''' ({{lang-bs|Bošnjaci}}, {{IPA-sh|boʃɲǎːtsi|pron}}; singular masculine: ''Bošnjak'', feminine: ''Bošnjakinja'') are a [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] [[nation]] and [[ethnic group]] inhabiting mainly the area of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. A native minority of Bosniaks live in other countries  in the [[Balkans]]; especially in the [[Sandžak]] region of [[Bosniaks of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Bosniaks of Montenegro|Montenegro]] (where Bosniaks form a regional majority), and in [[Bosniaks of Croatia|Croatia]] and [[Bosniaks in Kosovo|Kosovo]].{{efn|name=status}} Bosniaks are typically characterized by their historic tie to the [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnian historical region]], traditional majority adherence to [[Islam in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Islam]] since the 15th and 16th centuries, common [[Culture of Bosnia and Herzegovina|culture]] and [[Bosnian language]]. As of 2017 Bosniaks are also recognised as a national minority in [[Albania]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/albania-to-adopt-the-first-law-on-minorities-09-27-2017&lt;/ref&gt;
[[English speakers]] frequently refer to Bosniaks as '''Bosnian Muslims'''&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This term is considered inaccurate since not all Bosniaks profess [[Islam]] or practice the religion. Partly because of this, since the dissolution of Yugoslavia, ''Bosniak'' has replaced ''Muslim'' as an official ethnic term in part to avoid confusion with the religious term "Muslim" as an adherent of Islam. Additionally, Bosniaks are native to [[Montenegro]], [[Serbia]] including [[Kosovo]], and [[Croatia]], whilst Islam in Bosnia and Herzegovina may be practised by non-Bosniaks, such as the [[Turks of Bosnia and Herzegovina]].{{citation |date= 2016 |origyear= 2007 |url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bk.html#People |chapter= Bosnia and Herzegovina: People |title= The World Factbook |publisher= American [[American Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] |issn= 1553-8133 |accessdate= 2016-04-13 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110223164406/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bk.html#People |archivedate= 2011-02-23 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; or simply as [[Bosnians]], though the latter term can also  denote all inhabitants of Bosnia and Herzegovina (regardless of ethnic identity) or apply to [[citizenship]] in the country.

Over two million Bosniaks live in the Balkans, with an estimated additional million settled and living around the world. [[Bosnian genocide|Ethnic cleansing and genocide]] during the [[Bosnian War]] (1991–95) have had an effect on the territorial distribution of the population. Partly due to this,&lt;ref&gt;
Committee on Foreign Relations, US Senate, The Ethnic Cleansing of Bosnia-Hercegovina, (US Government Printing Office, 1992)
&lt;/ref&gt; a significant [[Bosniaks#Communities|Bosniak diaspora]] exists in a number of countries, including [[Bosnian Austrians|Austria]], Germany, [[Bosniaks in Turkey|Turkey]], [[Bosnian Australians|Australia]], Sweden,  [[Bosnian Canadians|Canada]] and the [[Bosnian Americans|United States]].

==Ethnology==
===Ethnonym===
 {{main|Name of Bosnia}}
According to the ''Bosniak'' entry in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], the first preserved use of "Bosniak" in English was by British diplomat and historian [[Paul Rycaut]] in 1680 as ''Bosnack'', cognate with post-classical Latin ''Bosniacus'' (1682 or earlier), French ''Bosniaque'' (1695 or earlier) or German ''Bosniak'' (1737 or earlier).&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl= http://oed.com/search?searchType=dictionary&amp;q={{urlencode:Bosniak}} |chapter= Bosniak |title= [[Oxford English Dictionary]] |publisher= Oxford University Press |edition=3rd |date=September 2005 |isbn=&lt;!-- 0198611862 --&gt; |ref=Reference-OED-Bosniak}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern spelling is contained in the 1836 ''[[Penny Cyclopaedia]]'' V. 231/1: "''The inhabitants of Bosnia are composed of Bosniaks, a race of Sclavonian origin''".&lt;ref name="Charles Knight 1836 231"&gt;{{cite book |author= Charles Knight |year= 1836 |title= The Penny Cyclopaedia |publisher=The Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge |volume=V |page=231 |location= London |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=C6YrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA231 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Slavic languages, ''-ak'' is a common [[suffix]] appended to words to create a masculine noun, for instance also found in the ethnonym of [[Poles]] (''Polak'') and [[Slovaks]] (''Slovák''). As such, "Bosniak" is etymologically equivalent to its non-ethnic counterpart "Bosnian" (which entered English around the same time via the Middle French, ''Bosnien''): a native of Bosnia.&lt;ref name=OED2&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl= http://oed.com/search?searchType=dictionary&amp;q=Bosnian |chapter= Bosnian |title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |publisher=Oxford University Press |edition= 3rd |date=September 2005 |isbn=&lt;!-- 0198611862 --&gt; |ref=Reference-OED-Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the perspective of Bosniaks, ''bosanstvo'' (Bosnianhood) and ''bošnjaštvo'' (Bosniakhood) are closely and mutually interconnected, as Bosniaks connect their identity with Bosnia and Herzegovina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AP7QCteb0o0C&amp;pg=PA229|title=Immigrants in American History: Arrival, Adaptation, and Integration:  Bosniaks (Muslims) and Bosniak Americans, 1870–1940|author=ed.

The earliest attestation to a Bosnian [[ethnonym]] emerged with the historical term ''"[[Bošnjani]]n"'' (Latin: ''Bosniensis'') which denoted the people of the [[History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (958–1463)|medieval Bosnian kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KQkXAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=called+the+bosnjani&amp;dq=called+the+bosnjani&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tkCIUdTXJunj4QTz9oCIAg&amp;redir_esc=y|title=''Myths and boundaries in south-eastern Europe''|author=Pål Kolstø |year=2005|work= |publisher=Hurst &amp; Co. |accessdate=}}, p. 120; ''..medieval Bosnia was a country of one people, of the single Bosnian people called the Bošnjani, who belonged to three confessions''.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 15th century,&lt;ref name=OED/&gt; the suffix ''-(n)in'' had been replaced by ''-ak'' to create the current form ''Bošnjak'' (Bosniak), first attested in the diplomacy of Bosnian king [[Tvrtko II of Bosnia|Tvrtko II]] who in 1440 dispatched a delegation (''Apparatu virisque insignis'') to the Polish king of Hungary, [[Władysław Warneńczyk]] (1440–1444), asserting a common Slavic ancestry and language between the ''Bosniak'' and Pole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Poviest Bosne do propasti kraljevstva|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1qdnAAAAMAAJ&amp;q|author=[[Vjekoslav Klaić]]|publisher=Troškom piščevim|page=278|year=1882}}; ''Bošnjakom isti pradjedovi bili, koji i Poljakom (the ancestors of the Bosniak, same as those of the Pole)''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jędrzej Moraczewski|title=Dzieje Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej|publisher=Nakładem i drukiem N.

Bosniak, as well as the older term ''Bošnjanin'' (in Lat. ''Bosnensis''), is originally a name defining the inhabitants of the medieval Bosnian state".&lt;ref&gt;Hrvatska enciklopedija (LZMK) – [http://www.enciklopedija.hr/Natuknica.aspx?ID=8952 Bošnjaci] {{quote|Bošnjaci, naziv za podanike bosanskih vladara u predosmansko doba, podanike sultana u osmansko doba, odnosno današnji naziv za najbrojniji od triju konstitutivnih naroda u BiH.

For the duration of Ottoman rule, the word Bosniak came to refer to all inhabitants of Bosnia; Turkish terms such as ''"Boşnak milleti"'', ''"Boşnak kavmi"'', and ''"Boşnak taifesi"'' (all meaning, roughly, "the Bosnian people"), were used in the Empire to describe Bosnians in an ethnic or "tribal" sense; and indeed, 17th-century Ottoman traveler and writer [[Evliya Çelebi]] reports in his work ''[[Seyahatname]]'' of the people in Bosnia as natively known as Bosniaks (Bošnjaci).&lt;ref&gt;Evlija Čelebi, Putopis: odlomci o jugoslavenskim zemljama, (Sarajevo: Svjetlost, 1967), p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the concept of [[nation]]hood was foreign to the Ottomans at that time – not to mention the idea that Muslims and Christians of some military province could foster any common supra-confessional sense of identity. The inhabitants of Bosnia called themselves various names: from Bosniak, in the full spectrum of the word's meaning with a foundation as a territorial designation, through a series of regional and confessional names, all the way to modern-day national ones. In this regard, Christian Bosnians had not described themselves as either Serbs or Croats prior to the 19th century, and in particular before the Austrian occupation in 1878, when the current tri-ethnic reality of Bosnia and Herzegovina was configured based on religious affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donia|Fine|1994|p=73}}: "Moreover, the translation of one's religious denomination to Serb or Croat nationality also had no relevance to the area's population, since Bosnians before the nineteenth century had not described themselves as either Serbs or Croats"&lt;/ref&gt; Social anthropologist Tone Bringa develops that "Neither Bosniak, nor Croat, nor Serb identities can be fully understood with reference only to [[Islam]] or [[Christianity]] respectively, but have to be considered in a specific Bosnian context that has resulted in a shared history and locality among Bosnians of Islamic as well as Christian backgrounds."&lt;ref name=shatzmiller&gt;{{cite book|last=Shatzmiller|first=Maya|title=Islam and Bosnia: Conflict Resolution and Foreign Policy in Multi-Ethnic States|year=2002|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|isbn=978-0-7735-2413-2|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identity===
Bosniaks are generally defined as the [[South Slavic peoples|South Slavic]] nation on the territory of the former [[Yugoslavia]] whose members identify themselves with Bosnia and Herzegovina as their ethnic state and are part of such a common nation, and of whom a majority are [[Islam in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Muslim]] by religion. Nevertheless, leaders and intellectuals of the Bosniak community may have various perceptions of what it means to be Bosniak. Some may point to an Islamic heritage, while others stress the purely secular and national character of the Bosniak identity and its connection with Bosnian territory and history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Religion and the Cold War: A Global Perspective|editor=Philip Emil Muehlenbeck|page=183|publisher=Vanderbilt University Press|year=2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ytEC2bOstFUC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, individuals outside Bosnia and Herzegovina may hold their own personal interpretations as well. Some people, such as Montenegrin Abdul Kurpejović, recognize an Islamic component in the Bosniak identity but see it as referring exclusively to the [[Slavic Muslims]] in Bosnia.&lt;ref name=Dimitrovova&gt;Dimitrovova, Bohdana.

Prior to this, the great majority of Bosnian Muslims had declared either ''Ethnically Undecided Muslim'' or – to a lesser extent – ''Undecided Yugoslav'' in censuses pertaining to Yugoslavia as the other available options were ''Serb-Muslim'' and ''[[Croat Muslims|Croat-Muslim]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Religion and the Cold War: A Global Perspective|editor=Philip Emil Muehlenbeck|page=184|publisher=Vanderbilt University Press|year=2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ytEC2bOstFUC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it achieved recognition as a distinct nation by an alternative name, the use of ''Muslim'' as an ethnic designation was opposed early on as it sought to label Bosniaks a religious group instead of an ethnic one.

Upon [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]'s declaration of independence from Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, the great majority of Bosnian Muslims aligned themselves with the Bosniak identity. In September 1993, at the height of the [[Bosnian War]], the Second Bosniak Congress formed a basis for the official re-establishment of the historical ethnic name ''Bosniak'' and deprecation of the former ''Muslim'' in use during [[SFR Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref name="Imamović, Mustafa 1996"&gt;Imamović, Mustafa (1996). Historija Bošnjaka. Sarajevo: BZK Preporod. {{ISBN|9958-815-00-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the election law of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the [[Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], recognizes the results from the 1991 population census as results referring to Bosniaks which are, alongside [[Bosnian Serbs]] and [[Bosnian Croats]], one of the three ''[[Ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina|constituent nations]]'' in post-war Bosnia and Herzegovina and the single largest ethnic group in the country.

In other ex-Yugoslav countries with significant Slavic Muslim populations, adoption of the Bosniak name has been less consistent. The effects of this phenomenon can best be seen in the censuses. For instance, the 2003 Montenegrin census recorded 48,184 people who registered as Bosniaks and 28,714 who registered as Muslim by nationality. Although Montenegro's Slavic Muslims form one ethnic community with a shared culture and history, this community is divided on whether to register as Bosniaks (''i.e.'' adopt Bosniak national identity) or as Muslims by nationality.&lt;ref name=Dimitrovova/&gt; Similarly, the 2002 Slovenian census recorded 8,062 people who registered as Bosnians, presumably highlighting (in large part) the decision of many secular Bosniaks to primarily identify themselves in that way (a situation somewhat comparable to the ''[[Yugoslavs|Yugoslav]]'' option during the [[History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1945–1992)|socialist period]]). However, such people comprise a minority (even in countries such as [[Montenegro]] where it is a significant political issue) while the great majority of Slavic Muslims in the [[former Yugoslavia]] have adopted the Bosniak national name.

===Relation to Serb and Croat nationalism===
As a melting ground for confrontations between different religions, national mythologies, and concepts of statehood, much of the [[historiography]] of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] has since the 19th century been the subject of competing Serb and Croat nationalist claims part of wider Serbian and Croatian hegemonic aspirations in Bosnia and Herzegovina, inherently interwoven into the complex nature of the [[Bosnian War]] at the end of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iqtVESaJUgkC&amp;pg=PA13|title=Being Muslim the Bosnian Way|first=Tone|last=Bringa|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1995|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As Andras Riedlmayers's meticulous research for the Hague Tribunal demonstrates: ''What happened in Bosnia is not just genocide, the willful destruction of the essential foundations of one particular community or group of people within a society'' ''[....]'' ''What happened in Bosnia is also described as sociocide, the murdering of a progressive, complex, and enlightened society in order that a regressive, simple, and bigoted society could replace it.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vm_0jGbX72EC&amp;pg=PA129|title= Understanding Evil: Lessons from Bosnia|first=Keith|last=Doubt|publisher=Fordham University Press|year=2006|pages=129–30.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is noted that writers on nationalism in Yugoslavia or the Bosnian War tend to ignore or overlook the Bosnian Muslim ideology and activity and see them as victims of other nationalisms and not nationalistic themselves.{{sfn|Hamourtziadou|2002}}

===Origin===
{{see also|Early history of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Genetic studies on Bosniaks}}
The [[Early Slavs]], a people from northeastern Europe, settled the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina (and neighboring regions) in the sixth and early seventh century (amid the [[Migration Period]]), and were composed of small tribal units drawn from a single Slavic confederation known to the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] as the ''[[Sclaveni]]'' (whilst the related ''[[Antes people|Antes]]'', roughly speaking, colonized the eastern portions of the Balkans).{{sfn|Donia|Fine|1994|p=?}}&lt;ref&gt;Hupchick, Dennis P. ''The Balkans from Constantinople to Communism'', pp. 28–30. Palgrave Macmillan (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Upon their arrival, the Slavs assimilated the Paleo-Balkan, mostly [[Romance languages|romanized]] tribes, generically known as the [[Illyrians]] on the territory of present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina, but also the romanized [[Gallic invasion of the Balkans|Celtic population]] which had intermingled with these since the 4th century BC, and to a lesser extent the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]]-speaking [[Ostrogoths]] which had entered the area in the late 4th century AD. Timothy Gregory writes that "It is now generally agreed that the people who lived in the Balkans after the Slavic "invasions" were probably for the most part the same as those who had lived there earlier, although the creation of new political groups and arrival of small numbers of immigrants caused people to look at themselves as distinct from their neighbours, including the Byzantines"&lt;ref&gt;T. E. Gregory, ''A History of Byzantium''. Wiley- Blackwell, 2010. p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;

Being a remote and mountainous region, Bosnia appears to have been settled by a smaller number of Slavic colonizers than the region in general and perhaps served as an area of refuge for the [[indigenous peoples]].{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=37-38}} Tribes recorded under the ethnonyms of "Serb" and "Croat" are described as a second, latter, migration of different people during the second quarter of the 7th century who do not seem to have been particularly numerous;{{sfn|Donia|Fine|1994|p=?}}{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=?}} these early "Serb" and "Croat" tribes, whose exact identity is subject to scholarly debate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gbUlnaHlHS0C&amp;pg=PA404|title=Empires and Barbarians: The Fall of Rome and the Birth of Europe|author=Heather, Peter |year=2010 |work= |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |accessdate=}}, pp. 404–406&lt;/ref&gt; came to predominate over the Slavs in the neighboring regions. Bosnia proper, however, appears to have been a territory outside Serb and Croat rule not being enumerated as one of the regions settled by those tribes.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=53; ''Thus Constantine describes the Serbs settling in southern Serbia, Zahumlje, Trebinje, Pagania, and Konavli. This situates some of them in the southern part of the Dalmatian coast. The Croats were settled in Croatia, Dalmatia, and western Bosnia''}} In time, Bosnia would come to form an independent unit under a ruler, [[Ban Kulin]], calling himself Bosnian.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=53}} In the 14th century a Bosnian kingdom centered on the river Bosna emerged. Its people, when not using local (county, regional) names, called themselves Bosnians.&lt;ref name="lrb.co.uk"/&gt;{{sfn|Pinson|1994|p=19}}

Following its conquest by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the mid-15th century, Bosnia experienced a rapid and extensive conversion of the local population to Islam, and by the early 1600s roughly two thirds of Bosnians were Muslim.{{sfn|Malcolm|1995|p=71}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire |author1=Gábor Ágoston |author2=Alan Masters |year=2009 |page=146 |publisher= Infobase Publishing |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=QjzYdCxumFcC&amp;pg=PA146 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a smaller number of converts from outside Bosnia were in time assimilated into the common Bosniak unit, such as [[Croats]] (mainly in [[Turkish Croatia]], and the Muslims of [[Slavonia]] that fled to Bosnia following the [[Austro-Turkish War (1683-1699)|Austro-Turkish war]]), Serbian and Montenegrin [[Muhacir]]s (in [[Sandžak]] particularly Islamicized descendants of the [[Old Herzegovina|Old Herzegovinian]] and highlander tribes from [[Brda, Montenegro|Brda region]], such as [[Rovčani]], [[Moračani]], [[Drobnjaci]] and [[Kuči]]), and slavicized [[Vlachs]],&lt;ref name="Imamović, Mustafa 1997"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://www.scribd.com/doc/138592157/Historija-Bosnjaka-Mustafa-Imamovic#scribd |title= ''Historija Bošnjaka: Osmanska država i islamska civilizacija'' |author= Imamović, Mustafa |year= 1997 |publisher= Bošnjačka zajednica kulture Preporod, Matični odbor |accessdate=  |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170224125702/https://www.scribd.com/doc/138592157/Historija-Bosnjaka-Mustafa-Imamovic#scribd |archivedate= 2017-02-24 |df=  }}, pp. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albanians]]&lt;ref name="Imamović, Mustafa 1997"/&gt; and German [[Saxons]].&lt;ref name="Imamović, Mustafa 1997"/&gt;

In addition, [[mtDNA]] studies shows that the Bosnian population partly share similiarities with other Southern European populations (especially with mtDNA haplogroups such as pre-HV (today known as [[Haplogroup R0 (mtDNA)|mtDNA haplogroup R0]]), HV2 and U1), but are for the mostly featured by a huge combination of mtDNA subclusters that indicades a consanguinity with Central and Eastern Europeans, such as modern [[Germans|German]], [[West Slavs|West Slavic]], [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] and [[Finno-Ugric peoples|Finno-Ugric]] populations. There is especially the observed similarity between Bosnian, [[Russians|Russian]] and [[Finns|Finnish]] samples (with mtDNA subclusters such as U5b1, Z, H-16354, H-16263, U5b-16192-16311 and U5a-16114A). The huge differentiation between Bosnian and Slovene samples of mtDNA subclusters that are also observed in Central and Eastern Europe, may suggests a broader genetic heterogeneity among the Slavs that settled the Western Balkans during the early Middle ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Malyarchuk | first1 = B.A. | last2 = Grzybowski | first2 = T. | last3 = Derenko | first3 = M.

==History==

===Middle Ages===
 {{Main|Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Middle Ages}}
The western Balkans had been reconquered from "[[Barbarians in the Byzantine Empire|barbarians]]" by Byzantine Emperor [[Justinian]] (r. 527–565). [[Sclaveni]] (Slavs) raided the western Balkans, including Bosnia, in the 6th century.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=32}} The ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' (DAI; ca. 960) mentions Bosnia ({{lang|el|Βοσωνα}}/Bosona) as a "small/little land" (or "small country",{{sfn|Kaimakamova|Salamon|2007|p=244}} {{lang|el|χοριον Βοσωνα}}/horion Bosona) part of Serbia,{{sfn|Kaimakamova|Salamon|2007|p=244}} having been settled by Serbs along with [[Zahumlje]] and [[Travunija]] (both with territory in modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina);{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=53}} it was referred to only once, at the end of the 32nd chapter on the Serbs (a chapter overall drawn from older writings).{{sfn|Kaimakamova|Salamon|2007|p=244}} This is the first mention of a Bosnian entity; it was not a national entity, but a geographical one, mentioned strictly as an integral part of Serbia.{{sfn|Kaimakamova|Salamon|2007|p=244}} Some scholars assert that the inclusion of Bosnia in Serbia merely reflect the status in DAI's time.{{sfn|Basic|2009|p=123}} In the Early Middle Ages, Fine, Jr. believes that what is today western Bosnia and Herzegovina was part of [[Duchy of Croatia|Croatia]], while the rest was divided between Croatia and [[Principality of Serbia (medieval)|Serbia]].{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=53}}

After the death of Serbian ruler [[Časlav]] (r. ca. 927–960), Bosnia seems to have broken away from the Serbian state and became politically independent.{{sfn|Bulić|2013|p=157}} Bulgaria briefly subjugated Bosnia at the turn of the 10th century, after which it became part of the Byzantine Empire.{{sfn|Bulić|2013|p=157}} In the 11th century, Bosnia was part of the Serbian state of [[Duklja]].{{sfn|Bulić|2013|p=157}}{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=202}}

In 1137, the Kingdom of Hungary annexed most of the [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia region]], then briefly lost it in 1167 to Byzantum before regaining her in the 1180s. Prior to 1180 (the reign of [[Ban Kulin]]) parts of Bosnia were briefly found in Serb or Croat units.{{sfn|Donia|Fine|1994|pp=14–16}} Anto Babić notes that "Bosnia is mentioned on several occasions as a land of equal importance and on the same footing as all other [South Slavic] lands of this area."&lt;ref&gt;Anto Babić, Iz istorije srednjovjekovne Bosne, (Sarajevo:Svjetlost,1972), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

After frequent change of rule over the area between regional powers, a ''de facto'' independent Bosnian state known as the [[Banate of Bosnia]] arose in the 12th century, though nominally under Hungarian sway.

====Banate of Bosnia and the Bosnian Church====
{{main|Banate of Bosnia|Bosnian Church}}
[[File:BiH, Radimlja necropolis 2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|[[Stećci|Medieval monumental tombstones (''Stećci'')]] that lie scattered across Bosnia and Herzegovina are historically associated with the Bosnian Church movement]]
[[File:Hvalov zbornik1.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.55|[[Hval Manuscript|Hval's Miscellany]] is a 15th-century Bosnian Church [[codex]] and one of the best known medieval manuscripts written in ''[[Bosnian Cyrillic|bosančica]]''.]]
Christian missions emanating from Rome and Constantinople had since the ninth century pushed into the Balkans and firmly established Catholicism in Croatia, while Orthodoxy came to prevail in Bulgaria, Macedonia, and eventually most of Serbia. Bosnia, lying in between, remained a no-man's land due to its mountainous terrain and poor communications. By the twelfth century most Bosnians were probably influenced by a nominal form of Catholicism characterized by a widespread illiteracy and, not least, lack of knowledge in Latin amongst Bosnian clergymen. Around this period, Bosnian independence from [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian overlordship]] was effected during the reign (1180–1204) of [[Kulin Ban]] whose rule marked the start of a religiopolitical controversy involving the native [[Bosnian Church]]. The Hungarians, frustrated by Bosnia's assertion of independence, successfully denigrated its patchy Christianity as [[heresy]]; in turn rendering a pretext to reassert their authority in Bosnia. Hungarian efforts to gain the loyalty and cooperation of the Bosnians by attempting to establish religious jurisdiction over Bosnia failed however, inciting the Hungarians to persuade the papacy to declare a crusade: finally invading Bosnia and warring there between 1235 and 1241. Experiencing various gradual success against stubborn Bosnian resistance, the Hungarians eventually withdrew weakened by a [[Mongols|Mongol]] attack on Hungary. On the request of the Hungarians, Bosnia was subordinated to a Hungarian archbishop by the pope, though rejected by the Bosnians, the Hungarian-appointed bishop was driven out of Bosnia. The Bosnians, rejecting ties with international Catholicism came to consolidate their own independent church, known as the [[Bosnian Church]], condemned as heretical by both the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] churches. Though scholars have traditionally claimed the church to be of a [[Dualistic cosmology|dualist]], or neo-[[Manichaean]] or [[Bogomil]] nature (characterized by the rejection of an omnipotent God, the Trinity, church buildings, the cross, the cult of saints, and religious art), some, such as John Fine, have stressed domestic evidence indicating the retention of basic Catholic theology throughout the Middle Ages.{{sfn|Pinson|1994|pp=4–8}} Most scholars agree that adherents of the church referred to themselves by a number of names; ''dobri Bošnjani'' or ''Bošnjani'' ("good Bosnians" or simply "Bosnians"), ''Krstjani'' (Christians), ''dobri mužje'' (good men), ''dobri ljudi'' (good people) and ''boni homines'' (following the example of a dualist group in Italy). Catholic sources refer to them as ''patarini'' ([[Cathars|patarenes]]), while the Serbs called them ''Babuni'' (after Babuna Mountain), the Serb term for Bogomils. The Ottomans referred to them as ''kristianlar'' while the Orthodox and Catholics were called ''gebir'' or ''kafir'', meaning "unbeliever".{{sfn|Velikonja|2003|pp=39-30}} The majority of the knowledge about the church is retrieved from outside sources.

====Expansion and the Bosnian Kingdom====

Her daughter Catherine was erected the [[Kral Kızı Monument]] after her death, while Sigismund, or later ''Ishak-beg Kraljević'', was designated as Sanjak-bey of [[Bolu]] by [[Mehmed the Conqueror]].]]

The Bosnian state was significantly strengthened under the rule (ca. 1318–1353) of ban [[Stephen II, Ban of Bosnia|Stephen II of Bosnia]] who patched up Bosnia's relations with the Hungarian kingdom and expanded the Bosnian state, in turn incorporating Catholic and Orthodox domains to the west and south; the latter following the conquer of [[Zahumlje]] (roughly modern-day Herzegovina) from the Serbian [[Nemanjić dynasty]]. In the 1340s, [[Franciscan]] missions were launched against alleged "heresy" in Bosnia; prior to this, there had been no Catholics – or at least no Catholic clergy or organization – in Bosnia proper for nearly a century. By the year 1347, Stephen II was the first Bosnian ruler to accept Catholicism, which from then on came to be – at least nominally – the religion of all of Bosnia's medieval rulers, except for possibly [[Stephen Ostoja of Bosnia]] (1398–1404, 1409–18) who continued to maintain close relations with the Bosnian Church. The Bosnian nobility would subsequently often undertake nominal oaths to quell "heretical movements" – in reality, however, the Bosnian state was characterized by a religious plurality and tolerance up until the Ottoman invasion of Bosnia in 1463.{{sfn|Pinson|1994|pp=6–8}}

By the 1370s, the Banate of Bosnia had evolved into the powerful [[Kingdom of Bosnia]] following the coronation of [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia]] as the first Bosnian king in 1377, further expanding into neighboring Serb and Croat dominions. However, even with the emergence of a kingdom, no concrete Bosnian identity emerged; religious plurality, independent-minded nobility, and a rugged, mountainous terrain precluded cultural and political unity. As Noel Malcolm stated: "All that one can sensibly say about the ethnic identity of the Bosnians is this: they were the Slavs who lived in Bosnia."{{sfn|Malcolm|1996|p=12}}

===Islamization and Ottoman era===
{{see also|History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1463–1878)|Ottoman conquest of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Islamization of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian uprising}}

Upon his father's death in 1461, [[Stephen Tomašević of Bosnia|Stephen Tomašević]] succeeded to the throne of Bosnia, a kingdom whose existence was being increasingly threatened by the Ottomans. In same year, Stephen Tomašević made an alliance with the Hungarians and asked [[Pope Pius II]] for help in the face of an impending Ottoman invasion. In 1463, after a dispute over the tribute paid annually by the Bosnian Kingdom to the Ottomans, he sent for help from the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]]. However, no help ever arrived to Bosnia from Christendom;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Timothy S.; Nesbitt, John W. (1995), Peace and war in Byzantium: essays in honor of George T. Dennis, S.J, Catholic University of America Press, pp. 189–191&lt;/ref&gt; King [[Matthias Corvinus|Matthias Corvinus of Hungary]], [[Skenderbeg]] of Albania and the [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusans]] all failed to carry out their promises,&lt;ref&gt;Ljubez, Bruno (2009), Jajce Grad: prilog povijesti posljednje bosanske prijestolnice (in Croatian), HKD Napredak, pp. 148–150&lt;/ref&gt; while the Venetians flatly refused the king's pleas.&lt;ref&gt;Babinger, Franz (1992). Mehmed the Conqueror and His Time. USA: Princeton University Press. pp. 163, 222–224.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1463, Sultan [[Mehmed the Conqueror]] led an army into the country. The royal city of [[Bobovac]] soon fell, leaving Stephen Tomašević to retreat to [[Jajce]] and later to [[Ključ, Una-Sana Canton|Ključ]]. Mehmed invaded Bosnia and conquered it very quickly, executing the last Bosnian king Stephen Tomašević and his uncle Radivoj. Bosnia officially fell in 1463 and became the westernmost province of the Ottoman Empire.

The rise of Ottoman rule in the Balkans modified the religious picture of Bosnia and Herzegovina as the Ottomans brought with them a new religion, [[Islam]]. Throughout the entire Balkans people were sporadically converting in small numbers; Bosnia, by contrast, experienced a rapid and extensive conversion of the local population to Islam, and by the early 1600s approximately two thirds of the population of Bosnia were Muslim.{{sfn|Malcolm|1995|p=71}} Slovenian observer [[Benedikt Kuripečič]] compiled the first reports of the religious communities in the 1530s. According to the records for 1528 and 1529, there were a total of 42,319 Christian and 26,666 Muslim households in the ''[[sanjak]]s'' (Ottoman administrative units) of [[Sanjak of Bosnia|Bosnia]], [[Sanjak of Zvornik|Zvornik]] and [[Sanjak of Herzegovina|Herzegovina]]. In a 1624 report on Bosnia (excluding Herzegovina) by [[Pjetër Mazreku|Peter Masarechi]], an early-seventeenth-century [[apostolic visitor]] of the Roman Catholic Church to Bosnia, the population figures are given as 450,000 Muslims, 150,000 Catholics and 75,000 Orthodox Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rqjLgtYDKQ0C&amp;pg=PA56|title=Religious Separation and Political Intolerance in Bosnia-Herzegovina|author=Velikonja, Mitja|year=2003|work= |publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press |accessdate=}}, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, historians agree that the Islamization of the Bosnian population was not the result of violent methods of conversions but was, for the most part, peaceful and voluntary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rqjLgtYDKQ0C&amp;pg=PA66|title=Religious Separation and Political Intolerance in Bosnia-Herzegovina|author=Velikonja, Mitja|year=2003|work= |publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press |accessdate=}}, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have long debated the reasons that made this collective acceptance of Islam possible among the Bosniaks, although the religious dynamic of medieval Bosnia is frequently cited.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Mustafa Imamović – ''Historija Bošnjaka''&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Masarechi, saw four basic reasons to explain the more intensive Islamization in Bosnia: the 'heretical past' of the Bosnians, which had left them confessionally weak and capable of transferring their allegiance to Islam; the example of many Bosnians who had attained high office through the [[devşirme]], and as powerful men were in a position to encourage their relatives and associates to convert; a desire to escape from the burdens of taxation and other services levied on non-Muslim citizens; and finally, an equally strong desire to escape the [[Proselytism|proselytizing]] importunities of Franciscan monks among the Orthodox population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ltRWy32dG7oC&amp;pg=PA580 |title= The Poetics of Slavdom: The Mythopoeic Foundations of Yugoslavia, Vol. 2 |author=Zlatar, Zdenko |year=2007 |work= |publisher= [[Peter Lang (publisher)|Peter Lang]] |accessdate=}}, p. 580&lt;/ref&gt;
Always on a purely religious ground, it is also said, by the orientalist [[Thomas Walker Arnold]] for instance, that because of the  major heresy in the region at the time, oppressed by the Catholics and against whom [[Pope John XXII]] even launched a [[crusade]] in 1325, the people were more receptive to the Ottoman Turks. In fact, in the tradition of Bosnian Christians, there were several practices that resembled Islam; like for instance; praying five times a day (reciting the [[Lord's Prayer]]).&lt;ref&gt;Arnold (1913) p. 198—200&lt;/ref&gt;
In time, hesitant steps were made towards acceptance of Islam. At first, this Islamisation was more or less nominal. In reality, it was an attempt at reconciling the two faiths. It was a lengthy and halting progress towards their final abandoning of their beliefs. For centuries, they were not considered full-fledged Muslims, and they even paid taxes like Christians.&lt;ref&gt;Miloš Mladenović, ''The Osmanli Conquest and the Islamization of Bosnia'', in Slavic and East-European Studies, III/4, Winter 1958-1959, pp. 219-226.&lt;/ref&gt; This process of Islamisation was not yet finished in the 17th century, as is witnessed by a keen English observer, [[Paul Rycaut]], who states in ''The Present State of the Ottoman Empire'' in 1670: "But those of this Sect who strangely mix Christianity and Mahometanism together, are many of the Souldiers who live on the confines of Serbia and Bosnia; reading the gospel in the Sclavonian tongue…; besides which, they are curious to learn the mysteries of the Alchoran [Quran], and the Law of Arabick tongue. [...] The Potures [Muslims] of Bosna are of this Sect, but pay taxes as Christians do; they abhor Images and the sign of the Cross; they circumcise, bringing the Authority of Christ's example for it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=sv&amp;id=KKMuTmW98DEC&amp;q=bosnia#v=snippet&amp;q=Sclavonian&amp;f=false|title=''The history of the present state of the Ottoman Empire''|author=[[Paul Rycaut]]|year=1686|work= |publisher= |accessdate=}}, pp. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many children of Christian parents were separated from their families and raised to be members of the [[Janissary]] Corps (this practice was known as the [[devsirme|devşirme]] system, 'devşirmek' meaning 'to gather' or 'to recruit'). Owing to their education (for they were taught arts, science, maths, poetry, literature and many of the languages spoken in the Ottoman Empire), Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian became one of the diplomatic languages at the porte. The Ottoman period that followed was characterized by a change in the landscape through a gradual modification of the settlements with the introduction of bazaars, military garrisons and mosques. Converting to Islam brought considerable advantages, including access to Ottoman trade networks, bureaucratic positions and the army. As a result, many Bosnians were appointed to serve as [[beylerbey]]s, [[sanjak-bey]]s, [[mullah]]s, [[qadi]]s, [[pasha]]s, [[mufti]]s, janissary commanders, writers, and so forth in [[Istanbul]], [[Jerusalem]] and [[Medina]]. Among these were important historical figures were: prince [[Ishak Bey Kraloğlu|Sigismund of Bosnia]] (later Ishak Bey Kraloğlu), [[Hersekzade Ahmed Pasha]], [[Isa-Beg Isaković|Isa-beg Ishaković]], [[Gazi Husrev-beg]], [[Damat Ibrahim Pasha]], [[Ferhad Pasha Sokolović]], [[Lala Mustafa Pasha]] and [[Sarı Süleyman Pasha]]. At least seven viziers were of Bosnian origin, of which the most renowned was [[Sokollu Mehmed Pasha]] (who served as [[Grand Vizier]] under three sultans: [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], [[Selim II]], and [[Murad III]]&lt;ref name="Imamović, Mustafa 1996"/&gt;). The Ottoman rule also saw many architectural investments in Bosnia and the creation and development of many new cities including [[Sarajevo]] and [[Mostar]]. This is mostly because of the high esteem the Bosniaks held in the eyes of the Sultans and the Turks. Bosnia became also a strategic base from which the Ottomans launched their armies northward and westward on campaigns of conquest and pillage. The Turks regarded Bosnia as a "bastion of Islam" and its inhabitants served as frontier guards (''serhatlije'').&lt;ref&gt;Velikonja, Mitija, ''Religious Separation and Political Intolerance in Bosnia-Herzegovina'', Pp. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of Bosnians in the Ottoman Empire had an important social and political effect on the country: it created a class of powerful state officials and their descendants which came into conflict with the feudal-military [[Sipahi|spahis]] and gradually encroached upon their land, hastening the movement away from the feudal tenure towards private estates and tax-farmers, creating a unique situation in Bosnia where the rulers were native inhabitants converted to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Prof. Giacobelli, Francesco, ''Arthur J.

Ottoman rule affected the ethnic and religious make-up of Bosnia and Herzegovina in additional ways. A large number of Bosnian Catholics retreated to the still unconquered Catholic regions of Croatia, [[Dalmatia]], and [[Slovenia]], at the time controlled by [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and the [[Republic of Venice]], respectively. To fill up depopulated areas of northern and western [[Eyalet of Bosnia]], the [[Ottomans]] encouraged the migration of large numbers of hardy settlers with military skills from [[Serbia]] and [[Herzegovina]]. Many of these settlers were [[Vlachs]], members of a nomadic pre-Slav [[Balkan]] population that had acquired a Latinate language and specialized in stock breeding, horse raising, long-distance trade, and fighting. Most were members of the [[Serbian Orthodox church]]. Before the [[Ottoman conquest of Bosnia|Ottoman conquest]], that church had very few members in the Bosnian lands outside Herzegovina and the eastern strip of the [[Drina]] valley; there is no definite evidence of any [[Orthodox church]] buildings in central, northern, or western Bosnia before 1463. With time most of the Vlach population adopted a Serb identity.{{sfn|Donia|Fine|1994|p=38}}{{sfn|Malcolm|1996}}{{sfn|Velikonja|2003|p=74}}

The 17th century brought major defeats and military setbacks on the Ottoman Empire's western frontier. With major wars occurring every few decades, Bosnia was economically and militarily exhausted. For Bosnia and Bosniaks, the most critical conflict of all was the [[Great Turkish War]]. At its very start in the mid-1680s, the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburgs]] retook nearly all of Ottoman [[Hungary]], sending tens of thousands of Muslim refugees flooding into the Bosnian region. A similar process occurred with the Habsburg conquest of [[Lika]] and [[Slavonia]]. Thousands of Muslims from these parts fled eastward into the Bosnian pashaluk, while those who remained were forcibly converted to Catholicism. In total, it is estimated that more than 100,000 Muslims were expelled from the frontier regions and settled in Bosnia during this time. Many brought with them a new sense of hostility towards Christianity.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Ottoman military disasters continued into the next decade. In 1697, Habsburg [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]] conducted an extremely successful border raid which culminated in Sarajevo being put to the torch. The Great Turkish War was finally ended by the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] in 1699. However, in the late 1710s yet another war between the Ottomans and the Habsburg-Venetian alliance ensued. It was ended by the [[Treaty of Passarowitz]] in 1718, but not before sending another wave of Muslim refugees fleeing to Bosnia proper.
These events created great unrest among Bosniaks. The sentiment of discontent was further magnified by war and an increased tax burden. As a result, Bosniak revolts sprang up in Herzegovina in 1727, 1728, 1729, and 1732. A great plague that resulted in the death of thousands during the early 1730s contributed to the general chaos. In 1736, seeking to exploit these conditions, The Habsburgs broke the Treaty of Passarowitz and crossed the [[Sava]] river boundary. In one of the most significant events in Bosniak history, local Bosniak nobility organized a defense and counterattack completely independent of the ineffective imperial authorities. On 4 August 1737, at the [[Battle of Banja Luka]], the outnumbered Bosniak forces routed the Habsburg army and sent them fleeing back to Slavonia.

The [[Ottoman military reform efforts]], that called for further expansion of the centrally controlled army (''nizam''), new taxes and more Ottoman bureaucracy would have important consequences in Bosnia and Herzegovina. These reforms weakened the special status and privileges for the Bosniak aristocracy and the formation of a modern army endangered the privileges of the Bosnian Muslim military men and of local lords, both were demanding greater independence from the Constantinople.&lt;ref&gt;Prof. Giacobelli, Francesco, Arthur J. Evans in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the 1875 revolt, Pp. 68-69, Anno Accademico 2011 / 2012, Università degli Studi di Padova&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barbara Jelavich]] states: "The Muslims of Bosnia and Herzegovina [...] were becoming increasingly disillusioned with the Ottoman government. The centralizing reforms cut directly into their privileges and seemed to offer no compensating benefits. [...]"&lt;ref&gt;B. Jelavich, op. cit., p. 350&lt;/ref&gt; The turning point came with the end of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829)|Russo-Ottoman War of 1828–1829]] and the [[Treaty of Adrianople (1829)|Treaty of Adrianople]] in 1829. According to the provisions of the treaty, the Ottoman Empire granted suzerainty to Serbia as a result of the [[Serbian revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;English translation: Leopold Ranke, A History of Serbia and the Serbian Revolution. Translated from the German by Mrs Alexander Kerr (London: John Murray, 1847)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. S. Stavrianos, The Balkans since 1453 (London: Hurst and Co., 2000), p. 248–250.&lt;/ref&gt; In a move that outraged Bosniaks and launched numerous protests, newly autonomous Serbia was also given six districts (Bosnian: ''nahijas'') that had traditionally belonged to Bosnia. Following this move, seen as the confiscation of historically Bosnian lands, the Bosnian autonomy movement was born. In 1831 they joined together under the leader [[Husein Gradaščević|Husein-kapetan Gradaščević]] and formally demanded the autonomy of Bosnia and Herzegovina with an elected native ruler. Gradaščević made a call in May 1831, demanding that all Bosniak aristocrats immediately join his army, along with all from the general populace who wished to do so. Thousands rushed to join him, among them being numerous Bosnian Christians, who were said to comprise up to a third of his total forces. But the Ottoman government crushed the revolt, led by the local Herzegovinian [[Ali-paša Rizvanbegović]] of [[Stolac]], who was later given [[Pashaluk of Herzegovina]] as a reward by the sultan [[Mahmud II]]. Husein Gradaščević died in Constantinople, under controversial circumstances in 1834, and became a living legend in his own time. Upon his death, he also became something of a martyr for Bosnian pride. This positive sentiment was not exclusive to the Muslim population, as Christians from [[Posavina]] are thought to have shared a similar view for decades. Husein Gradaščević is still today considered a Bosniak national hero and one of the most revered figures in the history of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

====The rise of the Bosnian national movement====
{{see also|Bosnian nationalism}}

National consciousness developed in Bosnia and Herzegovina among the three ethnic groups in the 19th century, with national identities having had a major impact from the [[Millet system]] in place in Ottoman society (where 'religion and nationality were closely intertwined and often synonyms'). During Ottoman rule, there was a clear distinction between Muslims and non-Muslims. There were different tax categories and clothes, but only in the late 18th- and early 19th century "the differentiations develop into ethnic and national forms of identification", according to Soeren Keil. The bordering countries of Serbia and Croatia consequently laid claim to Bosnia and Herzegovina; a combination of religion, ethnic identity and territorial claim was the basis for the three distinct nations.&lt;ref name="Keil2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Soeren Keil|title=Multinational Federalism in Bosnia and Herzegovina|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6igHDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA58|date=15 April 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-09343-5|pages=58–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, members of the 19th century [[Illyrian movement]], most notably franciscan [[Ivan Franjo Jukić]], whose Bosnianhood is apparent from his very ''[[nom de plume]]'' "Slavophile Bosniak" (''Slavoljub Bošnjak''),&lt;ref&gt;Kruševac, Todor, "Ivan Frano Jukić," in Godišnjak ''Istoriskog društva'', (Sarajevo, 1956), p. 171-184&lt;/ref&gt; emphasized Bosniaks (Bosnians) alongside Serbs and Croats as one of the "tribes" that constitute the "Illyrian nation".&lt;ref name=okey&gt;{{Cite book|last=Okey | first=Robin | title=Taming Balkan Nationalism: The Habsburg 'Civilizing Mission' in Bosnia 1878–1914 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2007 |page=14 |chapter= |isbn=0-19-921391-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 [[File:Ivan franjo jukic.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|right|Although a Catholic, [[Ivan Franjo Jukić|Fra Ivan Franjo Jukić]] considered himself Bosniak and advocated the preservation of a unified Bosniak nation across all three denominations in Bosnia and Herzegovina.]]
Influenced by the ideas of the [[French Revolution]] and [[Illyrian Movement]], the majority of Bosnian Franciscans supported the freedom, brotherhood, and unity of all South Slavs, while at the same time stressing a unique Bosniak identity as separate from the Serb and Croat identities. However, as pointed out by Denis Bašić, being a Bosniak in the 19th century was very much a social status granted only to the Muslim Bosnian aristocracy. Accordingly, Ivan Franjo Jukić writes in 1851 that "the begs and other Muslim lords call [Slavic-speaking Muslim peasants] ''Poturice'' [the Turkified ones] or ''Ćose'' [the beardless ones], while Christians call them ''Balije'' [a vulgar term that derives from the Ottoman period, and which applied to occasional Bosnian Muslim nomads who lived in mountainous areas. Today it is considered the most derogatory term for Bosniaks]."&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Franjo Jukić, ''Zemljopis i povjestnica Bosne'', pp. 142–143, fn. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the term [[Turks (term for Muslims)|''Turčin'' (Turk)]] was commonly used to describe the Bosnian and other Slavic Muslims, designating religious, and not ethnic belonging. The Italian diplomat M. A. Pigafetta, wrote in 1585 that Bosnian Christian converts to Islam refused to be identified as "Turks", but as "Muslims".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Muhamed Hadžijahić|title=Od tradicije do identiteta – geneza nacionalnog pitanja bosanskih muslimana|publisher=Muslimanska nadklada, Putokaz|page=43|location=Sarajevo|url=http://bs.scribd.com/doc/77645161/Dr-Muhamed-Hadžijahić-Od-Tradicije-Do-Identiteta#scribd|year=1974|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305140708/https://bs.scribd.com/doc/77645161/Dr-Muhamed-Had%C5%BEijahi%C4%87-Od-Tradicije-Do-Identiteta#scribd|archivedate=2016-03-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klement Božić, an interpreter at the [[Prussia]]n consulate in Bosnia during the 19th century stated that the "Bosnian Christians are calling their Muslim compatriots as 'Turks' and Muslim foreigners as 'Ottomans'; nor will ever a Muslim Bosniak say to an Ottoman, that he is a Turk or call him his brother.

Massieu de Clerval, "Rapport adresse a Son Excellence Monsieur le Ministre de I'instruction publique sur une mission en Bosnie, accomplie en 1855", ''in Archives des mission scientifique and litteraires'', vol. 5, (Paris, 1855, p. 35); the original inaccessible.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jukić's pupil and fellow friar [[Antun Knežević]], was one of the main protagonists of the multireligious ''Bošnjak'' (Bosniak) identity as well, and even more vocal then friar Jukić. He fiercely advocated against imminent ''[[Croatization]]'' of Catholics on one side, as well as imminent ''[[Serbianization]]'' of Orthodox people on the other, as he called it in his work. His position and doctrine was that all Bosnians are one people of three faiths, and that up to the late 19th century, no Croats and Serbs lived in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Although Knežević was not a unique phenomenon in this sense, he certainly had strongest impact, next to Jukić.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ivan Frano Jukić as Slavoljub Bošnjak|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t9xBAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Zemljopis i poviestnica Bosne|publisher=|location=Zagreb|year=1851|accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanak.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=194:antun-kneevi-bonjak-iz-varcara-kratka-povjest-kralja-bosanskih-dobra-knjiga-sarajevo-2009-319-str&amp;catid=37:radovi-prikazi-i-osvrti&amp;Itemid=99|title=Kratka povjest kralja bosanskih|publisher=Dobra knjiga|accessdate=13 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021181552/http://www.stanak.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=194:antun-kneevi-bonjak-iz-varcara-kratka-povjest-kralja-bosanskih-dobra-knjiga-sarajevo-2009-319-str&amp;catid=37:radovi-prikazi-i-osvrti&amp;Itemid=99|archivedate=21 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that it was Franciscan [[Filip Lastrić]] (1700–1783) who first wrote on the commonality of the citizens in the Bosnian ''eyalet'', regardless of their religion.

===Austro-Hungarian rule===
{{see also|History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1878–1918)|Austro-Hungarian campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878|Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian crisis}}

The conflict rapidly spread and came to involve several Balkan states and Great Powers, which eventually forced the Ottomans to cede administration of the country to [[Austria-Hungary]] through the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)]].{{sfn|Malcolm|1994|p=?}}
After the [[Herzegovina Uprising (1875-1878)|uprising in Herzegovina]] (1875–78) the population of Bosnian Muslims and Orthodox Christians in Bosnia decreased. The Orthodox Christian population (534,000 in 1870) decreased by 7 percent while Muslims decreased by a third.{{sfn|Pinson|1994|p=81}} The Austrian census in 1879 recorded altogether 449,000 Muslims, 496,485 Orthodox Christians and 209,391 Catholics in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The losses were 245,000 Muslims and 37,500 Orthodox Christians.{{sfn|Pinson|1994|p=81}}
 [[File:Muhajir.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.95|The loss of almost all Ottoman territories during the late 19th and early 20th century, especially after the Austro-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Balkan Wars, resulted in a large number of Muslim emigrants to [[Turkey]], known as "[[Muhacir]]s".]]
A large number of Muslims left Bosnia and Herzegovina following the Austrian occupation; official Austro-Hungarian records show that 56,000 people, mostly Muslims, emigrated between 1883 and 1920, but the number of Muslim [[emigrant]]s is probably much greater, as the official record does not reflect emigration before 1883, nor include those who left without permits. Those who stayed were concentrated in towns and particularly proud of their urban culture, especially in the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, which soon became one of the most multi-cultural cities in the former [[Yugoslavia]].

During the 20th century Bosnian Muslims founded several cultural and welfare associations in order to promote and preserve their cultural identity. The most prominent associations were ''[[Gajret]]'', ''Merhamet'', ''Narodna Uzdanica'' and later ''Preporod''. The Bosnian Muslim intelligentsia also gathered around the magazine ''Bosnia'' in the 1860s to promote the idea of a unified ''Bosniak nation''. This Bosniak group would remain active for several decades, with the continuity of ideas and the use of the ''Bosniak name''. From 1891 until 1910, they published a Latin-script magazine titled ''Bošnjak'' (Bosniak), which promoted the concept of ''Bosniakism'' (Bošnjaštvo) and openness toward European culture. Since that time the Bosniaks adopted European culture under the broader influence of Habsburg Monarchy. At the same time they kept the peculiar characteristics of their Bosnian Islamic lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;Karčić 1999:148-9)&lt;/ref&gt; These initial, but important initiatives were followed by a new magazine named ''Behar'' whose founders were [[Safvet-beg Bašagić]] (1870–1934), [[Edhem Mulabdić]] (1862–1954) and [[Osman Nuri Hadžić]] (1869–1937).&lt;ref&gt;Džavid Haverić, ''History of the Bosnian Muslim Community in Australia: Settlement Experience in Victoria'', Institute for Community, Ethnicity and Policy Alternatives, ICEPA, Victoria University, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

After the occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878, the Austrian administration of [[Benjamin Kallay]], the Austro-Hungarian governor of Bosnia and Herzegovina, officially endorsed "Bosniakhood" as the basis of a multi-confessional Bosnian nation that would include Christians as well as Muslims. The policy attempted to isolate Bosnia and Herzegovina from its irredentist neighbors (Orthodox Serbia and Catholic Croatia, but also the Muslims of the Ottoman Empire) and to negate the concepts of Serbian and Croatian nationhood which had already begun to take ground among the country's Orthodox and Catholic communities, respectively.{{sfn|Velikonja|2003|pp=130-135}}{{sfn|Donia|Fine|1994|p=73}}&lt;ref name=europa&gt;{{Cite book| title=Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States |publisher= [[Routledge]] |year=1999 |page=214 |isbn=1-85743-058-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of Bosnian nationhood was, however, firmly established only among the Bosnian Muslims, while fiercely opposed by Serb and Croat nationalists who were instead seeking to claim Bosnian Muslims as their own, a move that was rejected by most of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5J_gAU8c9NIC&amp;pg=PA110|title=Central and South-Eastern Europe 2004, Volume 4, p 110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Kallay's death in 1903, the official policy slowly drifted towards accepting the three-ethnic reality of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Ultimately, the failure of Austro-Hungarian ambitions to nurture a Bosniak identity amongst the Catholic and Orthodox led to almost exclusively Bosnian Muslims adhering to it, with 'Bosniakhood' consequently adopted as a Bosnian Muslim ethnic ideology by nationalist figures.&lt;ref&gt;Jack David Eller.

Pp. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; The journal "Bošnjak" ("Bosniak") founded in 1891 by [[Mehmed-beg Kapetanović Ljubušak]] declared that Bosniaks (in the sense of all Bosnians) were neither Croats nor Serbs but a distinct, though related people. It remarked that: "whereas the Croats argue that the Orthodox are our greatest enemies and that [[Serbdom]] is the same as Orthodoxy, the Serbs wear themselves out calling our attention to some bogus history, by which they have Serbianized the whole world. We shall never deny that we belong to the [[South Slavs|South Slav]] family; but we shall remain Bosniaks, like our forefathers, and nothing else."&lt;ref name="Jack David Eller 1999.

In November 1881, upon introducing the [[Bosnian-Herzegovinian Infantry]], the Austro-Hungarian government passed a Military Law (''Wehrgesetz'') imposing an obligation upon all Bosnian Muslims to serve in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army|Imperial Army]], which led to widespread riots in December 1881 and throughout 1882; the Austrians appealed to the [[Mufti]] of [[Sarajevo]], [[Mustafa Hilmi Hadžiomerović]] (born 1816) and he soon issued a [[Fatwa]] "calling on the Bosniaks to obey military Law."{{sfn|Karčić|1995|pp=118–119}} Other important Muslim community leaders such as Mehmed-beg Kapetanović Ljubušak, later Mayor of [[Sarajevo]], also appealed to young Muslim men to serve in the Habsburg military.

In 1903, the [[Gajret]] cultural society was established; it promoted [[Serbs|Serb identity]] among the [[Slavic Muslims]] of [[Austria-Hungary]] (today's [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]){{sfn|Allworth|1994|p=125}} and viewed that the [[Serb Muslims|Muslims were Serbs]] lacking ethnic consciousness.{{sfn|Allworth|1994|p=126}} The view that Muslims were Serbs is probably the oldest of three ethnic theories among the [[Bosnian Muslims]] themselves.{{sfn|Allworth|1994|p=116}}

After World War I, the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (later known as the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]) was formed. In it, Bosniaks alongside Macedonians and Montenegrins were not acknowledged as a distinct ethnic group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Klemenčič|first=Matjaž|title=The Former Yugoslavia's Diverse Peoples: A Reference Sourcebook|year=2004|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=1-57607-294-0|page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; However; the first provisional cabinet included a Muslim.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[#refRamet2006|Ramet 2006]], p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Given that the old landowning was predominantly Bosniak, the land reforms were resisted. Violence against Muslims and the enforced seizure of their lands shortly ensued. Bosniaks were offered compensation but it was never fully materialized. The regime sought to pay 255,000,000 dinars in compensation per a period of 40 years with an interest rate of 6%.  Payments began in 1936 and were expected to be completed in 1975; however in 1941 World War Two erupted and only 10% of the projected remittances were made.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

During World War II, Bosniak elite and notables issued resolutions or memorandums in various cities that publicly denounced Croat-Nazi collaborationist measures, laws and violence against Serbs: [[Prijedor]] (23 September), Sarajevo (the [[Resolution of Sarajevo Muslims]] of 12 October), [[Mostar]] (21 October), [[Banja Luka]] (12 November), [[Bijeljina]] (2 December) and [[Tuzla]] (11 December). The resolutions condemned the [[Ustaše]] in Bosnia and Herzegovina, both for their mistreatment of Muslims and for their attempts at turning Muslims and Serbs against one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hoare|first=Marko Attila|title=The History of Bosnia: From the Middle Ages to the Present Day|year=2007|publisher=SAQI|isbn=0-86356-953-6|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One memorandum declared that since the beginning of the Ustaše regime, that Muslims dreaded the lawless activities that some Ustaše, some Croatian government authorities, and various illegal groups perpetrated against the Serbs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refTomasevich2001|Tomasevich 2001]], p. 492.&lt;/ref&gt; At this time [[Chetniks#Against Muslims|several massacres]] against Bosniaks were carried out by Serb and Montenegrin [[Chetniks]].{{sfn|Malcolm|1996|p=188}}&lt;ref name=lampe&gt;{{Cite book |last=Lampe |first=John R. |title= Yugoslavia as History |publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2000 |pages=206, 209, 210 |isbn=0-521-77401-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=glenny&gt;{{Cite book |last=Glenny |first=Misha |title= The Balkans: Nationalism, War &amp; the Great Powers, 1804–1999 |publisher= [[Penguin Books]] |year=2001 |pages=494–495 |isbn=0-14-023377-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that 75,000 Muslims died in the war,{{sfn|Malcolm|1994|p=192}} although the number may have been as high as 86,000 or 6.8 percent of their pre-war population.{{sfn|Pinson|1994|p=143}} A number of Muslims joined the [[Yugoslav Partisan]] forces, "making it a truly multi-ethnic force".&lt;ref name=andjelic /&gt; In the entirety of the war the Yugoslav Partisans of Bosnia and Herzegovina were 23 percent Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hoare |first=Marko Attila |title=Genocide and Resistance in Hitler's Bosnia: The Partisans and the Chetniks |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-726380-1 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, Serb-dominated Yugoslav Partisans would often enter Bosniak villages killing Bosniak intellectuals and other potential opponents.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002|p=157}} In February 1943 the Germans approved the [[13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian)]] and began recruitment.

During the socialist Yugoslav period, the Muslims continued to be treated as a religious group instead of an ethnic group.&lt;ref name=Banac287&gt;{{cite book |last=Banac |first=Ivo |title=The National Question in Yugoslavia: Origins, History, Politics |year=1988 |pages=287–288 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1948 census, Bosnia and Herzegovina's Muslims had three options in the census: "Serb-Muslim", "Croat-Muslim", and "ethnically undeclared Muslim".&lt;ref name=Banac287/&gt; In the 1953 census the category "Yugoslav, ethnically undeclared" was introduced and the overwhelming majority of those who declared themselves as such were Muslims.&lt;ref name=Banac287/&gt; The Bosniaks were recognized as an ethnic group in 1961 but not as a nationality and in 1964 the Fourth Congress of the Bosnian Party assured the Bosniaks the right to [[self-determination]].&lt;ref name=Banac287/&gt; On that occasion, one of the leading communist leaders, [[Rodoljub Čolaković]], stated that "our Muslim brothers" were equal with Serbs and Croats and that they would not be "forced to declare themselves as Serbs and Croats."

Around 8,000 Bosniak men and boys were killed by the units of the [[Army of the Republika Srpska|Bosnian Serb Army]] during the [[Srebrenica massacre]] in July 1995.]]
During the war, the Bosniaks were subject to [[Ethnic cleansing in the Bosnian War|ethnic cleansing]] and  [[Bosnian Genocide|genocide]]. The war caused hundreds of thousands of Bosniaks to flee the nation. The war also caused many drastic demographic changes in Bosnia. Bosniaks were prevalent throughout almost all of Bosnia in 1991, a year before the war officially broke out. As a result of the war, Bosniaks in Bosnia were concentrated mostly in areas that were held by the Bosnian government during the war for independence. Today Bosniaks make up the absolute majority in [[Sarajevo]] and its [[Sarajevo Canton|canton]], most of northwestern Bosnia around [[Bihać]], as well as central Bosnia, [[Brčko District]], [[Goražde]], [[Podrinje]] and parts of Herzegovina.

At the outset of the Bosnian war, forces of the [[Bosnian Serb Army]] attacked the Bosnian Muslim civilian population in eastern Bosnia. Once towns and villages were securely in their hands, the Serb nationalist forces – military, police, the paramilitaries and, sometimes, even Serb villagers – applied the same pattern: houses and apartments were systematically ransacked or burnt down, civilians were rounded up or captured, and sometimes beaten or killed in the process. Men and women were separated, with many of the men massacred or detained in the camps. The women were kept in various detention centers where they had to live in intolerably unhygienic conditions, where they were mistreated in many ways including being raped repeatedly. Serb nationalist soldiers or policemen would come to these detention centres, select one or more women, take them out and rape them.&lt;ref name="ICTY: Stanković and Janković judgement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/stankovic/cis/en/cis_jankovic_stankovic_en.pdf|title=ICTY: Blagojevic and Jokic judgement|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330081559/http://www.icty.org/x/cases/stankovic/cis/en/cis_jankovic_stankovic_en.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ICTY: Kunarac, Kovač and Vuković judgement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/kunarac/acjug/en/kun-aj020612e.pdf|title=ICTY: Kunarac, Kovač and Vuković judgement|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61DTBLTC3?url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/kunarac/acjug/en/kun-aj020612e.pdf|archivedate=2011-08-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Serbs had the upper hand due to heavier weaponry (despite less manpower) that was given to them by the Yugoslav People's Army and established control over most areas where Serbs had relative majority but also in areas where they were a significant minority in both rural and urban regions excluding the larger towns of Sarajevo and [[Mostar]]. The Serb nationalist military and political leadership received the most accusations of [[war crimes]] by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY) many of which have been confirmed after the war in ICTY trials.
Most of the capital [[Sarajevo]] was predominantly held by the Bosniaks. In the 44 months of the siege, terror against Sarajevo residents varied in intensity, but the purpose remained the same: inflict suffering on civilians to force the Bosnian authorities to accept Serb demands.&lt;ref name="ICTY: Greatest suffering at least risk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sense-agency.com/en/stream.php?sta=3&amp;pid=9043&amp;kat=3 |title=ICTY: Greatest suffering at least risk |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013175021/http://sense-agency.com/en/stream.php?sta=3&amp;pid=9043&amp;kat=3 |archivedate=2007-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The VRS surrounded it (alternatively, the Serb forces situated themselves in the areas surrounding Sarajevo the so-called Ring around Sarajevo), deploying troops and artillery in the surrounding hills in what would become the longest siege in the history of modern warfare lasting nearly 4 years.

Throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina, mosques were systematically destroyed by Serb and Croat armed forces. Among the most important losses were two mosques in [[Banja Luka]]; Arnaudija and [[Ferhat Pasha Mosque|Ferhadija]] mosques.

At the vernacular level, Bosniaks are more linguistically homogeneous than Serbs or Croats who also speak non-standard dialects beside Shtokavian. With respect to lexicon, Bosnian is characterized by its larger number of Ottoman Turkish (as well as Arabic and Persian) loanwords (called ''Orientalisms'') in relation to the other Serbo-Croatian varieties.

The first official dictionary in the Bosnian language was published in 1992.&lt;ref name="Jordan1989"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Jordan|title=Atlas Ost- und Südosteuropa: Bevölkerung aktuelle Karten zu Ökologie, Bevölkerung und Wirtschaft|volume=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JtZKAAAAYAAJ|year=1989|publisher=Österreichisches Ost- und Südosteuropa-Institut|isbn=978-3-443-28526-5|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]] is attested since at least the [[Kingdom of Bosnia]]; the [[Charter of Ban Kulin]], written in Cyrillic, remains one of the oldest written South Slavic state documents.

The modern Bosnian language principally uses the [[Gaj's Latin Alphabet|Latin alphabet]]. However, Cyrillic (popularly termed [[Bosnian Cyrillic]] or ''Bosančica'') was employed much earlier, as evident in medieval charters and on monumental tombstones (''[[stećci]]'') found scattered throughout the landscape. One of the most important documents is the Charter of Ban Kulin, which is regarded by Bosnian authors as one of the oldest official recorded documents to be written in Bosnian Cyrillic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sarajevo essays: politics, ideology, and tradition |last= Mahmutćehajić |first= Rusmir |year= 2003 |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=Albany, NY  |isbn=9780791456378 |page=252 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Die Kultur der Bosniaken, Supplement I: Inventar des bosnischen literarischen Erbes in orientalischen Sprachen |last=Balić |first=Smail |year=1978 |publisher=Adolf Holzhausens, Vienna |location=Vienna |isbn= |page=111|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of Cyrillic was largely replaced by [[Arebica]] (''Matufovica''), a Bosnian variant of the [[Perso-Arabic script]], upon the introduction of Islam in the 15th century, first among the elite, then amongst the public, and was commonly used up until the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Katalog Arapskih, Turskih i Perzijskih Rukopisa (Catalogue of the Arabic, Turkish and Persian Manuscripts in the Gazihusrevbegova Library, Sarajevo) |last=Dobraća |first=Kasim |year=1963 |publisher= |location= Sarajevo |isbn= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many other elements of Bosniak culture, Bosniak folklore is derived from [[Culture of Europe|European]], [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] influences, typically taking place prior to the 19th century. Generally, folklore also varies from region to region and city to city. Cities like [[Sarajevo]] and [[Mostar]] have a rich tradition all by themselves. Many man-made structures such as bridges and fountains, as well as natural sites, also play a significant role. At the very roots of the Bosniak folk soul are the national music genres called [[Sevdalinka]] and [[Music of Bosnia and Herzegovina#Ilahije i Kaside (Religious Songs)|Ilahije]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

There are many signs of [[pagan]] practices being carried over first into Christianity and later into Islam in Bosnia and Herzegovina – for example, the use of the mountain tops as a place of worship, and the name of pagan gods, such as [[Perun]] and [[Thor]], that survived in oral tradition until the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Muhamed Hadžijahić, "Sinkretistički elementi", p. 304-305 (mountain tops), p. 309-313 (God's names).&lt;/ref&gt; Slavic traditions such as dragons, fairies and ''[[Slavic fairies|Vila]]'', are also present. Fairies are often mentioned in Bosniak epics, poetry and folk songs. Well known are "gorske vile", or fairies from the mountains which dance on very green meadows. The cult of post-pagan Perun survived as the day of [[Elijah|Elijah the Thunderer]] which was another important event for Bosnian Muslims. Muhamed Hadžijahić mentions: "In Muslim celebration of this holiday, we see traces of ancient pagan traditions related to cult of sun and rain." This tradition is among Bosnian Muslims known as Aliđun and among the Serbs as Ilijevdan. Pre-Slavic influences are far less common but nonetheless present. Certain elements of paleo-Balkan beliefs have also been found.&lt;ref&gt;Glasnik zemaljskog muzeja, 01/07/1894 – ''Vjerske starine iz Bosne i Hercegovine'' Scridb: {{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/75692611/Glasnik-Zemaljskog-Muzeja-1894-god-6-knj-1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224144413/https://www.scribd.com/doc/75692611/Glasnik-Zemaljskog-Muzeja-1894-god-6-knj-1 |archivedate=2017-02-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these traditions which could originate from the pre-Slavic era, is a Bosniak tradition of placing a horse's scull tied with a rope into river Bosna, to fight off drought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ibrahim Pašić|title=Predslavenski korijeni Bošnjaka: Tračko ime Bosna i Tračani u Bosni|publisher=BZK "PREPOROD"|page=405|location=Sarajevo|url=http://www.interliber.com/catlistdetail.asp?SID=INTERLIBER^71366947-2014-12-29-9-52&amp;ISBN=9789958820632&amp;ml=b|year=2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307220852/http://interliber.com/catlistdetail.asp?isbn=9789958820632&amp;ml=b&amp;sid=interliber%5E71366947-2014-12-29-9-52|archivedate=2016-03-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Djevojačka pećina'', or the ''Maiden's Cave'', is a traditional place of the 'Rain Prayer' near [[Kladanj]] in north-eastern Bosnia, where Bosnian Muslims gather to pray for the soul of the maiden whose grave is said to be at the entrance to the cave. This tradition is of pre-Islamic origin and is a place where the followers of the medieval [[Bosnian Church]] held their [[pilgrimage]]. Another Bosnian Muslim place of pilgrimage is [[Ajvatovica]] near [[Prusac]] in central Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is the largest Islamic traditional, religious and cultural event in Europe, and is a place where devout Bosnian Muslims remember and give thanks to the founder of the holy site, Ajvaz-dedo, whose forty day prayers were heard by [[Allah]] and much needed water came out of a rock that had split open in a miraculous act. Even though the pilgrimage at Ajvatovica is a marking of the sixteenth-century conversion to Islam in Bosnia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Vjekoslav Perica|title=Balkan Idols: Religion and Nationalism in Yugoslav States|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=86|location=New York|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=sv&amp;id=jIoKMGRHxn4C&amp;q=ajvatovica#v=snippet&amp;q=ajvatovica&amp;f=false|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; the tradition of this event is also linked to the pre-Islamic cult of [[St George's Day]], and not to any of [[Islamic calendar|Hijri calendars]]. The green banners of Islam, [[Takbir|takbir's]] and [[Nasheed|nasheed's]] are an integral part of the Ajvatovica's spirit. The procession is approaching [[Shahid|shahid's]] cemetery from the time of [[Mehmed the Conqueror]] and prays with [[Al-Fatiha|Sūrat al-Fātiḥah]] to [[martyrs]] of Bosnia. Other important Islamic holy sites are the [[khanqah|khanqah's]], [[dervish]] houses of prayer, where members of the Sufi mystical order gather around their leaders to engage in religious contemplation and rituals. One of the oldest is the 15th century [[Isa-Beg Isaković|Isa-beg's]] [[khanqah|tekke]] (Isa-begova tekija) in Sarajevo.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

National heroes are typically historical figures, whose lives and skills in battle are emphasized. These include figures such as [[Ban Kulin]], the founder of medieval Bosnia who has come to acquire a legendary status.

[[File:Ivana Kobilca - Bošnjak z goslimi.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.6|A Bosniak playing [[gusle]], painting by [[Ivana Kobilica]], ca. 1900.]]
The nation takes pride in the native melancholic folk songs ''[[sevdalinka]]'', the precious medieval [[filigree]] manufactured by old [[Sarajevo]] craftsmen, and a wide array of [[tradition]]al [[wisdom]] transmitted to newer generations by word of mouth, but in recent years written down in numerous books. Another prevalent tradition is "''Muštuluk''", whereby a gift is owed to any bringer of good news.

Rural folk traditions in Bosnia include the shouted, [[polyphony|polyphonic]] [[ganga (music)|ganga]] and ravne pjesme (''flat song'') styles, as well as instruments like a wooden [[flute]] and [[šargija]]. The [[gusle]], an instrument found throughout the [[Balkans]], is also used to accompany ancient South Slavic [[epic poetry|epic]] [[poems]]. The most versatile and skillful gusle-performer of Bosniak ethnicity was the [[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] Bosniak [[Avdo Međedović]] (1875–1953).
Bosniaks have also at an international level left behind a musical legacy to the rest of Europe, and some examples of this is the 16th century lutenist-composer from [[Venice]], [[Franciscus Bossinensis]], and the Austrian-Jewish opera composer [[Alexander von Zemlinsky]] who was partly of Bosnian Muslim origin.

Probably the most distinctive and identifiably Bosniak of music, ''Sevdalinka'' is a kind of emotional, melancholic folk song that often describes sad subjects such as love and loss, the death of a dear person or heartbreak. Sevdalinkas were traditionally performed with a [[Bağlama|saz]], a Turkish [[string instrument]], which was later replaced by the accordion.  However the more modern arrangement, to the derision of some purists, is typically a vocalist accompanied by the [[accordion]] along with [[snare drum]]s, [[upright bass]], [[guitar]]s, [[clarinet]]s and [[violin]]s. Sevdalinkas are unique to Bosnia and Herzegovina. They arose in Ottoman Bosnia as urban Bosnian music with often oriental influences. In the early 19th century, Bosniak poet [[Umihana Čuvidina]] contributed greatly to sevdalinka with her poems about her lost love, which she sang. The poets which in large has contributed to the rich heritage of Bosniak  people, include among others Derviš-paša Bajezidagić, [[Abdullah Bosnevi]], [[Hasan Kafi Pruščak]], Abdurrahman Sirri, [[Abdulvehab Ilhamija]], [[Mula Mustafa Bašeskija]], Hasan Kaimija, [[Ivan Franjo Jukić]], [[Safvet-beg Bašagić]], [[Musa Ćazim Ćatić]], [[Mak Dizdar]], as many prominent prose writers, such as [[Enver Čolaković]], [[Skender Kulenović]], [[Meša Selimović]] (although he declared himself as a Serb&lt;ref&gt;Večernje Novosti: Pronašao mir u Beogradu, Dragan BOGUTOVIĆ, 9 July 2010 (Serbian)&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Abdulah Sidran]], [[Nedžad Ibrišimović]], [[Zaim Topčić]] and [[Zlatko Topčić]]. Historical journals as ''Gajret'', ''Behar'' and ''Bošnjak'' are some of the most prominent publications, which in a big way contributed to the preservation of the Bosniak identity in late 19th and early 20th century. The Bosnian literature, are generally known for their ballads; ''The Mourning Song of the Noble Wife of the Hasan Aga''&lt;ref&gt;Naimark, Norman M.; Case, Holly (2003). Yugoslavia and Its Historians: Understanding the Balkan Wars of the 1990s. Stanford University Press. pp. 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt; (or better known as [[Hasanaginica]]), ''Smrt Omera i Merime'' (Omer and Merimas death) and ''Smrt braće Morića'' (The death of brothers Morić). Hasanaginica were told from generation to generation in oral form, until it was finally written and published in 1774 by an Italian anthropologist, [[Alberto Fortis]], in his book ''Viaggio in Dalmazia'' ('A travel across Dalmatia').&lt;ref&gt;Wolff, Larry (2003). Venice and the Slavs: The Discovery of Dalmatia in the Age of Enlightenment. Stanford University Press. pp. 191–192. {{ISBN|0-8047-3946-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Hasanaginica is considered as the one of the most beautiful ballads ever written, and were subsequently translated to German ([[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]], 1775), English ([[Walter Scott]], 1798), Russian ([[Aleksandr Pushkin]], 1835), French ([[Prosper Mérimée]], 1827, and [[Adam Mickiewicz]], 1841) and other world's languages, becoming an integral part of the world literary heritage already in the 18th century.

There are also Bosniaks who can be categorized as [[Nondenominational Muslims]] and [[Cultural Muslims]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeffries, Ian (2007).

Volume 45., p. 38. Department of History and Anthropology of Religions, Lund University, Lund, Sweden&lt;/ref&gt; The position of Sufism in Bosnia during the Ottoman era was legally the same as in other parts of the empire. Bosnian Sufis produced literature, often in oriental languages (Arabic and Turkish), although a few also wrote in Serbo-Croatian,&lt;ref&gt;Šabanović 1973&lt;/ref&gt; such as Abdurrahman Sirri (1785-1846/47) and [[Abdulvehab Ilhamija|Abdulwahāb Žepčewī]] (1773–1821). Another Sufi from Bosnia was Sheikh Hali Hamza, whose doctrines were considered to contradict the official interpretation of Islam. His supporters ''hamzevije'' formed a religious movement that is often described as a sect closely related to the [[tariqa]] of ''bajrami-melami''.&lt;ref&gt;Ćehajić 1986:69ff; Hadžijahić 1977:91ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Another prominent Bosniak Sufi was [[Hasan Kafi Pruščak]], a Sufi thinker and the most prominent figure of the scientific literature and intellectual life of the 16th century Bosniaks.

In a 1998 public opinion poll, 78.3% of Bosniaks in the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] declared themselves to be religious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Religious separation and political intolerance in Bosnia-Herzegovina|last1=Velikonja|first1=Mitja|authorlink=|year=2003|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press|location=|isbn=1-58544-226-7|page=261|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rf8P-7ExoKYC&amp;pg=PA261|accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bosnian Muslims tend to often be described as moderate, secular and European-oriented compared to other Muslim groups.&lt;ref&gt;Bringa 2002:24; Bringa 1995:7.&lt;/ref&gt; Bosniaks have been described as "[[Cultural Muslims]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jeffries|first1=Ian|title=Balkans: A Post-Communist History|date=2007|page=330}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "[[Progressive Muslims]]".{{sfn|Hoare|2014|p=3}}

Kjell Magnusson points out that religion played a major role in the processes that shaped the national movements and the formation of the new states in the Balkans after the Ottoman retreat, since the Ottomans distinguished peoples after their religious affiliations.&lt;ref&gt;Magnusson 1994:336; Olsson 1994:24.&lt;/ref&gt; Although religion only plays a minor role in the daily lives of the ethnic groups of Bosnia and Herzegovina today, the following stereotypes are still rather current, namely, that the Serbs are Orthodox, the Croats Catholic and the Bosniaks Muslim; those native Bosnians who remained Christian and did not convert to Islam over time came to identify as ethnic [[Serbs|Serb]] or [[Croats|Croat]], helping to explain the apparent ethnic mix in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Still, however, there are a few individuals who violate the aforementioned pattern and practice other religions actively, often due to intermarriage.&lt;ref&gt;Gaši, Ašk, Melamisufism i Bosnien, ''En dold gemenskap'', Lund Studies in History of Religions. Volume 27., p. 38. Department of History and Anthropology of Religions, Lund University, Lund, Sweden&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surnames and given names===
{{refimprove section|date=January 2015}}
Bosniak surnames, as is typical among the South Slavs from former Yugoslavia, often end with "ić" or "ović". This is a [[patronymic]] which basically translates to "son of" in English and plays the same role as "son" in English surnames such as [[Johnson]] or [[Wilson (surname)|Wilson]]. What comes prior to this can often tell a lot about the history of a certain family.

Most Bosniak surnames follow a familiar pattern dating from the period of time that surnames in Bosnia and Herzegovina were standardized. Some Bosniak Muslim surnames have the name of the founder of the family first, followed by an [[Islamic]] profession or title, and ending with ić. Examples of this include Izetbegović (Son of Izet [[bey]]), and Hadžiosmanović ("son of Osman [[Hajji]]"). Other variations of this pattern can include surnames that only mention the name, such as Osmanović ("son of Osman"), and surnames that only mention profession, such as Imamović ("son of the [[Imam]]"). Some even mention religion as well such as "Muslimović" ("meaning son of a Muslim").

Quite a few Bosniak surnames do not necessarily have Islamic roots to them, but end in -ović and -ić; common amongst Slavic surnames. These surnames have probably stayed the same since medieval times, and typically come from old Bosnian nobility, or come from the last wave of converts to Islam. Examples of such surnames include Tvrtković and Kulenović.

There are also other surnames that do not end in ić at all. These surnames are typically derived from place of origin, occupations, or various others such factors in the family's history. Examples of such surnames include Zlatar ("goldsmith") Kovač ("blacksmith") or Kolar ("wheelwright").

There are some Bosniak surnames of foreign origin, indicating that the founder of the family came from a place outside Bosnia and Herzegovina. Many such Bosniak surnames have [[Albanians|Albanian]], [[Vlachs|Vlach]], [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] or [[Arabs|Arab]] origins. Examples of such surnames include Arnautović (from Arnaut - Turkish ethnonym used to denote Albanians), Vlasić (from Vlach people), Tatarević (from Tatar people) and Arapović (from Arap - Turkish ethnonym used to denote Arabs). There are also some surnames which are presumed to be of pre-Slavic origin. Some examples of such surnames may be of Illyrian or Celtic origin, such as the surname Mataruga and Motoruga.&lt;ref&gt;E. Çabej, Ilirishtja dhe Shqipja, Studime gjuhesore IV, Prishtine 1987., p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Bosniak surnames are also common as Croatian and Serbian surnames: Puškar, [[Jašić]], Sučić, [[Subašić]], [[Begić]], [[Hadžić]].

Given names or first names among Bosniaks have mostly [[Arabic language|Arabic]], or [[Turkish language|Turkish]], roots such as Osman, Mehmed, Muhamed, Alija, Ismet, Kemal, Hasan, Ibrahim, Mustafa, Ahmed, Husein, Hamza, Haris, Halid, Refik, Tarik, Faruk, Abdulah, Amer, Sulejman, Mahir, Enver, and many others. South Slavic given names such as "Zlatan" or "Zlatko" are also present primarily among non-religious Bosniaks. What is notable however is that due to the structure of the Bosnian language, many of the Muslim given names have been altered to create uniquely Bosniak given names. Some of the Oriental given names have been shortened. For example: Huso short for Husein, Ahmo short for Ahmed, Meho short for Mehmed. One example of this is that of the Bosniak humorous characters Mujo and Suljo, whose given names are actually Bosniak short forms of Mustafa and Sulejman. More present still is the transformation of given names that in Arabic or Turkish are confined to one gender to apply to the other sex. In Bosnian, simply taking away the letter "a" changes the traditionally feminine "Jasmina" into the popular male name "Jasmin". Similarly, adding an "a" to the typically male "Mahir" results in the feminine "Mahira".&lt;ref&gt;Muslimanska licna imena: sa etimologijom, etimoloskom grafijom i sematikom Trece izdanje.

[[File:Bosniak national flag.svg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|The Bosniak religious flag, used together with the national medieval coat of arms with the [[Fleur-de-lis]] during the 1990s.]]
The traditional symbol of the Bosniak people is a [[fleur-de-lis]] coat of arms, decorated with six golden lilies, also referred to [[Lilium bosniacum]], a native lily of the region.&lt;ref&gt;"Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, 1992–1998". Flagspot.net. Retrieved 3 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This Bosniak national symbol is derived from the coat of arms of the medieval Kingdom of Bosnia, and was particularly used in the context of the rule of Bosnian King [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia]]. According to some sources, the Bosnian coat of arms, with six golden lilies, originated from the French descended [[Capetian House of Anjou]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/sfor/indexinf/articles/030512a/t030512a.htm|title=SFOR – Bosnia and Herzegovina in ten flags|publisher=|accessdate=1 May 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304063315/http://www.nato.int/sfor/indexinf/articles/030512a/t030512a.htm|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The member of this dynasty, [[Louis I of Hungary]], was married to [[Elizabeth of Bosnia]], daughter of the ban [[Stephen II of Bosnia]], with [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia|Tvrtko I]] consequently embracing the heraldic lily as a symbol of the Bosnian royalty in token of the familial relations between the Angevins and the Bosnian royal family. It is also likely that the Bosnians adopted, or were granted, the fleur-de-lis on their coat of arms as a reward for taking the Angevin side.

This emblem was revived in 1992 as a symbol of Bosnian nationhood and represented the flag of the [[Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] between 1992 and 1998. Although the state insignia was replaced in 1999 on request of the other two ethnic groups, the [[flag of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] still features a fleur-de-lis alongside the [[Variations of the field|Croatian chequy]]. The Bosnian fleur-de-lis also appears on the flags and arms of many cantons, municipalities, cities and towns. It is still used as official insignia of the Bosniak regiment of the [[Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mpr.gov.ba/userfiles/file/Biblioteka/zakoni/hr/ZAKON%20O%20ZASTAVI%20BiH/Zakon%20o%20zastavi%20BiH%20-%2019%20-%2001.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119223607/http://www.mpr.gov.ba/userfiles/file/Biblioteka/zakoni/hr/ZAKON%20O%20ZASTAVI%20BiH/Zakon%20o%20zastavi%20BiH%20-%2019%20-%2001.pdf |archivedate=2008-11-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fleur-de-lis can also be commonly found as ornament in mosques and on Muslim tombstones. Swedish historian Senimir Resić states that the emblem of the fleur-de-lis (symbolizing the Christian Middle Ages) which become a national symbol of Bosniaks in 1992, was, in that time of war and [[Islamophobia]], intended to draw attention to the [[Western world]] of the Christian and medieval European past of the Bosnian Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Senimir Resić|title=En historia om Balkan – Jugoslaviens uppgång och fall|publisher=Historiska Media|page=294|location=Lund|url=http://www.adlibris.com/se/bok/en-historia-om-balkan---jugoslaviens-uppgang-och-fall-9789185507870|year=2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141229183931/http://www.adlibris.com/se/bok/en-historia-om-balkan---jugoslaviens-uppgang-och-fall-9789185507870|archivedate=2014-12-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Bosniak flag dates from the Ottoman era, and is a white crescent moon and star on a green background. The flag was also the symbol of the short-lived independent Bosnia in the 19th century and of the [[Bosnian uprising]] against the Turks led by [[Husein Gradaščević]].

==Communities==

[[File:Coat of arms of Bosniaks in Serbia and Montenegro.png|upright=0.45|left|thumb|National emblem of the [[Bosniaks of Serbia]] and [[Bosniaks of Montenegro]].]]
National consciousness has also spread to most Bosniaks in the neighboring countries and increasingly around the world after the [[Bosnian war]]. The largest number of Bosniaks outside Bosnia and Herzegovina are found in Serbia and Montenegro (specifically in the [[Sandžak]] region). The city of [[Novi Pazar]] is home to the largest Bosniak population outside Bosnia. Another 40,000 Bosniaks are found in [[Croatia]] and 38,000 in [[Slovenia]]. However, some of them still identify themselves as "Muslims" or "Bosnians", according to latest estimates. In [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] there are estimated to be about 17,000 Bosniaks.

Due to warfare and [[ethnic cleansing]] during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a large part of the world's estimated 3–4 million  Bosniaks are found in countries outside [[the Balkans]]. The highest Bosniak populations outside the ex-[[Yugoslavia]]n states are found in the [[Bosnian American|United States]], [[Sweden]], [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]], and [[Turkey]]. Prior generations of Bosniak immigrants to some of these countries have by now been mostly integrated.

In [[Western countries]], a large majority of the Bosniaks are war [[refugee]]s who only arrived in these countries beginning in the 1990s. They still speak Bosnian, and maintain cultural and religious communities, visit their mother country regularly and send remittances to families back home.

===Diaspora===
{{See also|Bosnian diaspora}}

There is a significant Bosniak diaspora in the rest of Europe, Turkey, United States and Canada.

*Turkey: The community in Turkey has its origins predominantly in the exodus of Muslims from the [[Bosnia Eyalet]] taking place in the 19th and early 20th century as result of the collapse of Ottoman rule in the Balkans. According to estimates commissioned in 2008 by the [[National Security Council (Turkey)|National Security Council of Turkey]] as many as 2 million Turkish citizens are of Bosniak ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= [[Milliyet]] |url= http://www.milliyet.com.tr/default.aspx?aType=SonDakika&amp;Kategori=yasam&amp;ArticleID=873452&amp;Date=07.06.2008&amp;ver=16 |title= Türkiye'deki Kürtlerin sayısı! |publisher= www.milliyet.com.tr |date= 2008-06-06 |accessdate= 2013-05-05 |language= tr |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/5uDKEe6C3?url=http://www.milliyet.com.tr/default.aspx?aType=SonDakika&amp;Kategori=yasam&amp;ArticleID=873452&amp;Date=07.06.2008&amp;ver=16 |archivedate= 2010-11-13 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bosniaks mostly live in the [[Marmara Region]], in the north-west.

*United States: The first Bosnian arrivals came around the 1860s. According to a 2000 estimate, there are some 350,000 [[Bosnian Americans|Americans of Bosnian ancestry]].&lt;ref name="The 2000 USA census"/&gt; Bosniaks were early leaders in the establishment of Chicago's Muslim community. In 1906, they established Džemijetul Hajrije (The Benevolent Society) of [[Illinois]] to preserve the community's religious and national traditions as well as to provide mutual assistance for funerals and illness. The organization established chapters in Gary, [[Indiana]], in 1913, and Butte, [[Montana]], in 1916, and is the oldest existing Muslim organization in the United States. There are numerous Bosniak cultural, sport and religious associations. Bosnian-language newspapers and other periodicals are published in many states; the largest in the United States is the St. Louis based newspaper [http://sabahusa.com/ "Sabah"].
*Canada: According to the [[Canada 2001 Census|2001 census]], there are 25,665 people who claimed [[Bosnians|Bosnian]] ancestry.&lt;ref name="immigration-online.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://immigration-online.org/41-bosnian-immigration.html|title=immigration-online.org|publisher=|accessdate=1 May 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603064525/http://immigration-online.org/41-bosnian-immigration.html|archivedate=3 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large majority of [[Bosnian Canadian]]s emigrated to [[Canada]] during and after the Bosnian War, although Bosnian migration dates back to the 19th century.&lt;ref name="immigration-online.org"/&gt; Traditional centers of residence and culture for people from Bosnia and Herzegovina are in [[Toronto]], [[Montreal]] and [[Vancouver]].

The '''British Band''' was a mixed-nation group of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] commanded by the [[Sauk people|Sauk]] leader [[Black Hawk (Sauk leader)|Black Hawk]], which fought against [[Illinois]] and [[Michigan Territory]] [[Militia (United States)|militias]] during the 1832 [[Black Hawk War]]. The band was composed of about 1,500 men, women, and children from the Sauk, [[Meskwaki]], [[Fox (tribe)|Fox]], [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]], [[Potawatomi]], [[Ho-Chunk]], and [[Ottawa (tribe)|Ottawa]] nations; about 500 of that number were warriors. Black Hawk had an alliance with the British that dated from the [[War of 1812]], giving them their colloquial name. The band crossed the [[Mississippi River]] from Iowa into [[Illinois]] in an attempt to reclaim their homeland and in violation of several treaties. Subsequently, both the Illinois and Michigan Territory militia were called up and the Black Hawk War ensued.

The British Band was victorious at the [[Battle of Stillman's Run]] and the military engagements that followed were insignificant until the final two encounters: the [[Battle of Wisconsin Heights|Wisconsin Heights]] and the [[Battle of Bad Axe|Bad Axe River]]. Band members who survived the war were either imprisoned or returned home. All the prisoners taken following the conflict were released by [[Winfield Scott]] at the end of August 1832, except Black Hawk who was taken east. In 1833 he dictated his [[autobiography]], the first Native American autobiography published in the United States.

==Background==
[[Sauk people|Sauk]] warrior [[Black Hawk (Sauk leader)|Black Hawk]], the leader of a band of Sauks near [[Rock Island, Illinois|Rock Island]] at [[Saukenuk]], was always in opposition to ceding [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] lands to white settlers and their governments. Black Hawk supported the invalidity of the [[Treaty of St. Louis (1804)]] of both the Sauk and [[Fox (tribe)|Fox]] nations negotiated with the then [[Indiana Territory]] Governor [[William Henry Harrison]]. The treaty ceded territory, including Black Hawk's birthplace Saukenuk, to the United States.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; The Sauk are a consensus decision making society. Their representatives exceeded the authorization of merely taking under consideration what terms the United States government might put forth, bring them back to reach a consensus and then return with their treaty terms. The lack of the tribe discussing the treaty prior to being made official made it invalid by Black Hawk and other members of the tribe. The representatives never had the tribal authorization to unilaterally cede its lands.&lt;ref name=lewis2/&gt;

During the [[War of 1812]] between the United Kingdom and the United States, Colonel Robert Dickson, an English [[fur trader]], amassed a sizable force of Native Americans at [[Green Bay (Lake Michigan)|Green Bay]] to assist the British in operations around the [[Great Lakes]]. Most of the warriors Dickson assembled were from the [[Potawatomi]], [[Ho-Chunk]], [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]] and [[Ottawa (tribe)|Ottawa]] tribes. Dickson bestowed the rank of [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] [[Brigadier General]] on Black Hawk.&lt;ref name=smith&gt;Smith, William Rudolph. ''The History of Wisconsin: In Three Parts, Historical, Documentary, and Descriptive'', ([https://books.google.com/books?id=YGPggXpQnGEC&amp;pg=PA221&amp;lpg=PA221&amp;dq=black+hawk's+band&amp;source=web&amp;ots=AFV9mPs3ub&amp;sig=83ojd-ZdXsl4sANrD78h_sk9QR4 Google Books]), B. Brown: 1854, pp. 221–406. Retrieved 20 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He was given command of all Native Americans gathered at Green Bay, including the 200 Sauk warriors under Black Hawk's control. Black Hawk was then presented with a silk flag, a medal, and a written certificate of good behavior and alliance with the British. The certificate would be found 20 years later, after the [[Battle of Bad Axe]], carefully preserved along with a flag similar to the one Dickson gave to Black Hawk.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;

During the 1812 war, Black Hawk and his warriors fought in several engagements with [[Henry Procter (British Army officer)|Henry Procter]] on the borders of [[Lake Erie]]. He returned home to Saukenuk to find his rival [[Keokuk (Sauk leader)|Keokuk]] had become the tribe's war chief.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; After the war ended, Black Hawk signed a peace treaty in May 1816 that re-affirmed the treaty of 1804, a provision Black Hawk later protested ignorance of.&lt;ref name=lewis2&gt;Lewis, James.

Retrieved 20 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prelude to war==
Despite opposition by Keokuk and the US authorities, Black Hawk's band returned to Saukenuk in 1830 following their winter hunt.&lt;ref name=lewis2/&gt; A year later they returned again, and [[Governor of Illinois|Illinois Governor]] [[John Reynolds (U.S. politician)|John Reynolds]] proclaimed it an "invasion of the state."&lt;ref name=lewis2/&gt;

Responding to Illinois Governor John Reynolds' call, General [[Edmund Pendleton Gaines]] brought his federal troops from [[St. Louis, Missouri]] to Saukenuk to insist on Black Hawk's immediate departure.&lt;ref name=lewis2/&gt;  Black Hawk left but soon returned to the west side of the Mississippi, threatened by Gaines' troops and an additional 1,400 militia called up by Reynolds on 25 June 1831.&lt;ref name=lewis2/&gt; On 30 June, Black Hawk and the chiefs of the British Band were forced to sign a surrender agreement in which they promised to remain west of the Mississippi.&lt;ref name=lewis2/&gt;

At the end of 1831, stories spread throughout the settlements of the Upper [[Mississippi River]] Valley that the British planned to aid Black Hawk in the event of a war with the white settlers. According to [[U.S. Indian Agent]] [[Felix St. Vrain]], a known ne'er-do-well named [[Billy Caldwell]] had delivered a message to the Sauk which reported the alleged British intentions.&lt;ref name=trask1/&gt; The ''New Galenian'' of [[Galena, Illinois|Galena]] reported that Black Hawk's band would receive aid and ammunition from the British, and the tale was widely believed. The militia commander at [[Fort Armstrong, Illinois|Fort Armstrong]], Major John Bliss, informed General [[Henry Atkinson (soldier)|Henry Atkinson]] of the rumor, and said a follower of Keokuk had reported to him that Black Hawk and [[Neapope]] were holding talks with bands of Potawatomi, Kickapoo, and Ho-Chunk. The talks mentioned the promises of the British, as well as word that the [[French Canadians]] intended to assist them.&lt;ref name=trask1&gt;Trask, ''Black Hawk: The Battle for the Hear of America, pp.139–140.&lt;/ref&gt; These events, combined with Black Hawk's 1812 alliance with the British, and occasional visits to Canada, attributed to his 1832 band becoming known by the moniker British Band.&lt;ref name=abe&gt;"[http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/bio/blackhawk.html Black Hawk], Primary Source Materials, Abraham Lincoln Digitization Project, ''Northern Illinois University''. Retrieved 20 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The term British Band was used frequently by American, Sauk, and Fox observers alike and served to distinguish Black Hawk's group from the rest of the tribes.&lt;ref name=lewis2/&gt;

==Black Hawk War==

===Forces===
The British Band had three key leaders, [[Black Hawk (Sauk leader)|Black Hawk]], the Ho-Chunk prophet [[Wabokieshiek]] (White Cloud), and Neapope. There were seven civil chiefs besides Neapope and Wabokieshiek, and five war captains including Black Hawk. The other civil chiefs in the band were: Pamisseau, Weesheet, Chakeepashipabo, Checokalako, Ioway, Pamaho, and Towaunonne; the four other war captains were: Menacou, Makatauaupuat, Pashetowat, and Kinnekonnesaut.&lt;ref name=matileband&gt;Matile, Roger.

Along the way they passed the ruins of Saukenuk and headed for the village of Ho-Chunk prophet [[White Cloud (prophet)|White Cloud]].&lt;ref name=lewis3/&gt;

===Incursion===
[[Image:Chief Black Hawk3.jpg|thumb|right|Black Hawk led the British Band across the Mississippi River on 5 April 1832. Illustration from [[History of the Indian Tribes of North America]].]]
When Black Hawk's Band crossed the Mississippi River from [[Iowa]] in April 1832 to return to their homeland in the Rock River Valley, it was under a [[British flag]]. Potawatomi Chief [[Shabbona]] stated it was the same flag that had been given on a visit to the British in [[Malden, Ontario]], Canada.&lt;ref name=trask1/&gt; Observers at the time, from [[George Davenport]], to St. Vrain, were certain that Black Hawk's intentions were to wage war against the United States.&lt;ref name=trask2&gt;Trask, ''Black Hawk: The Battle for the Heart of America'', pp. 152–156.&lt;/ref&gt; Historians generally believe that a more decisive action by General Atkinson, charged with prosecuting the war, in stopping Black Hawk's Band from moving up the Rock River may have prevented the war. [[Zachary Taylor]] made similar observations shortly after the war ended.&lt;ref name=trask2/&gt;
[[Image:Pecatonica Battleground1.jpg|thumb|left|The British Band suffered a defeat at [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1832)|Horseshoe Bend]], shown here in an 1857 painting.]]
In response to Black Hawk and his band's movements, Governor Reynolds issued a proclamation on 16 April, mustering five [[brigade]]s of volunteers to form at [[Beardstown, Illinois|Beardstown]] and to head north to force Black Hawk out of Illinois. Although one-third of all federal troops from the [[United States Army]] were eventually involved in the conflict, the 9,000 soldiers from the [[Illinois Militia]] provided the majority of U.S. combatants.&lt;ref name=lewis2a&gt;Lewis, James.

===Battles===
Black Hawk himself led warriors in several battles, including Stillman's Run, the [[Battle of Apple River Fort]] on 24 June, the [[Second Battle of Kellogg's Grove]] on 25 June, and the final two battles at Wisconsin Heights and Bad Axe. Besides the major victory at Stillman's Run Black Hawk's Band was involved in several other battles and skirmishes during the Black Hawk War. Several of the small skirmishes and massacres that occurred following Stillman's Run were attributed to bands of Native Americans unaffiliated with Black Hawk's Band, though many were likely sympathetic or intent on joining him.&lt;ref name=wisc/&gt; The events at [[Spafford Farm massacre|Spafford Farm]] were attributed to a band of Kickapoo loosely affiliated with the British Band.&lt;ref name=lewis2b/&gt;

After the massacre, General [[Henry Atkinson (soldier)|Henry Atkinson]] was informed that Henry Dodge was to take over General [[Alexander Posey (general)|Alexander Posey's]] brigade at Fort Hamilton. While Dodge was on his way to visit the brigade, he heard a [[rifle]] shot from a group of Native Americans. Dodge quickly returned to his command post and gathered as many men as he could to pursue the enemy. With Dodge in quick pursuit, a group of approximately 11 Native warriors criss-crossed the [[Pecatonica River]] until, finding flight hopeless, they prepared to make a stand at the [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1832)|Battle of Horseshoe Bend]].&lt;ref name=lewis2b&gt;Lewis, James.

[[Image:Wisconsin Heights Battlefield painting.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Wisconsin Heights Battlefield]] in a 19th-century painting. It was the site of the British Band's penultimate battle.]]
On 21 July 1832, Illinois and Wisconsin militia men under the command of Generals [[Henry Dodge]] and [[James D. Henry]] caught up with Black Hawk's British Band near present-day [[Sauk City, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name=lewis/&gt;&lt;ref name=cole&gt;Cole, Harry Ellsworth, ed.
''[http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/WI.ColeStandardv1 A Standard History of Sauk County, Wisconsin: Volume I]'', Chicago: Lewis Publishing Co., 1918, pp. 170–171. Available online via [http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/WI/ The State of Wisconsin Collection], University of Wisconsin.&lt;/ref&gt;  The clash became known as the Battle of Wisconsin Heights. Militarily, the battle was devastating for Black Hawk's band of warriors; including those who drowned during the melee, casualty estimates climbed as high as 70.&lt;ref name=lewis&gt;Lewis, James. "[http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/blackhawk/page2c.html The Black Hawk War of 1832:] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815021319/http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/blackhawk/page2c.html |date=15 August 2009 }}," Abraham Lincoln Digitization Project, ''Northern Illinois University'', p. 2C Retrieved 1 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the relatively high casualties the battle did allow much of the Band, including many women and children, to escape across the [[Wisconsin River]].&lt;ref name=lewis/&gt;

The militia regrouped at [[Blue Mounds Fort|Fort Blue Mounds]] and picked up Black Hawk's trail again on 28 July near [[Spring Green, Wisconsin]]. When they finally caught up with the British Band, it would lead to the decisive clash of the war at Bad Axe. At the mouth of the [[Bad Axe River]], hundreds of men, women and children would be killed by pursuing soldiers, their Indian allies, and a U.S. [[gunboat]].&lt;ref name=mil&gt;McCann, Dennis. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20070502200209/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=597233 Black Hawk's name, country's shame lives on]," ''Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel'', 28 April 2007. Retrieved 20 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The members of the British Band, and the Fox, Kickapoo, Sauk and Ho-Chunk and Potawatomi that later joined them, suffered unknown numbers of dead during the war.&lt;ref name=lewis2d/&gt; While some died fighting, others were tracked down and killed by [[Sioux]], [[Menominee]], Ho-Chunk, and other native tribes. Still others died of starvation or drowned during the Band's long trek up the Rock River toward the mouth of the Bad Axe.&lt;ref name=lewis2d/&gt; The entire British Band was not wiped out at Bad Axe; some survivors drifted back home to their villages. This was relatively simple for the Potawatomi and Ho-Chunk of the band.&lt;ref name=lewis2d/&gt; Many Sauk and Fox found return to their homes more difficult, and while some returned safely others were held in custody by the army. Prisoners, some taken at the Battle of Bad Axe, and others taken by U.S.-aligned Native American tribes in the following weeks, were taken to [[Fort Armstrong, Illinois|Fort Armstrong]].&lt;ref name=lewis2d/&gt; About 120 prisoners — men, women, and children, waited until the end of August to be released by General [[Winfield Scott]].&lt;ref name=lewis2d&gt;Lewis, James. "[http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/blackhawk/page2d.html The Black Hawk War of 1832] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619071514/http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/blackhawk/page2d.html |date=19 June 2009 }}," Abraham Lincoln Digitization Project, ''Northern Illinois University'', p. 2D. Retrieved 20 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

With most of the British Band dead and the rest captured or disbanded, the defeated Black Hawk was held in captivity at [[Jefferson Barracks]] with Neapope, White Cloud, and eight other leaders of the British Band.&lt;ref name=lewis2d/&gt; After 8 months, in April 1833 they were taken east, as ordered by then U.S. President [[Andrew Jackson]]. The men traveled by [[steamboat]], [[carriage]], and [[railroad]], and met with large crowds wherever they went. Once in Washington, D.C., they met with Jackson and [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Lewis Cass]], though their final destination was prison at [[Fortress Monroe]] in [[Virginia]].&lt;ref name=lewis2d/&gt; They stayed only a few weeks at the prison, during which they mostly posed for multiple portraits by different artists. On 5 June 1833, the men were sent west by steamboat on a circuitous route that took them through many large cities. Again, the men were a spectacle everywhere they went, and met with huge crowds of people in cities such as New York, [[Baltimore]] and [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name=lewis2d/&gt; Reaction in the west, however, was much different. For instance, in Detroit, a crowd burned and hanged [[effigies]] of the prisoners.&lt;ref name=lewis2d/&gt;

Near the end of his captivity in 1833, Black Hawk told his [[autobiography|life story]] to a government interpreter, which was edited by a local reporter and became the first Native American autobiography published in the United States.&lt;ref name=gmu&gt;"[http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5817/ Black Hawk Remembers Village Life Along the Mississippi]," History Matters: The U.S. Survey Course on the Web, ''George Mason University''.

'''Richard Louis Donato''' (born June 24, 1963) is a bar manager from [[Los Angeles, California]]. He was the winner of the [[reality game show]] ''[[Big Brother 8 (U.S.)|Big Brother 8]]''. He and his daughter, [[Daniele Donato]], are the only family member pair to win the American ''Big Brother'' program's top two prizes in the same competition. Dick holds the record as the show's oldest winner (age 44 at the time), and Daniele is the youngest person (having turned 21 during the competition) ever to win one of the American program's top two prizes.  Dick returned for [[Big Brother 13 (U.S.)|Season 13]] of Big Brother as a team with his daughter Daniele, but departed the show citing "personal reasons" during the first week. In 2014, Donato announced that the reason he departed the show was due to a positive [[HIV]] diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hollywoodtake.com/evel-dick-donato-hiv-diagnosis-shocking-big-brother-winner-reveals-why-he-left-season-13-57728&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Donato was a stand-in for [[Keith Richards]] in the motion picture ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://communities.canada.com/globaltv/blogs/bigbrotherrewind/pages/exec-grodner-looks-forward-to-interactive-season.aspx Grodner Looks Forward to Getting 'Interactive'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070709000555/http://communities.canada.com/globaltv/blogs/bigbrotherrewind/pages/exec-grodner-looks-forward-to-interactive-season.aspx |date=2007-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of Donato's claims to have met, known, or even dated various celebrities, he has been accused of lying just to drop names. However, [[Dizzy Reed]] of the rock band [[Guns N' Roses]] says that Donato is not a name dropper, that people drop his name.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.realitywanted.net/2007/08/10/big-brother-8-recap-thursday-august-9th-big-brother-live-eviction-show/ Big Brother 8 Recap - Thursday August 9th Big Brother Live Eviction Show&lt;/ref&gt; The nickname "Evel Dick" originated with an email address Donato once made up.&lt;ref&gt;[http://television.aol.com/tv-celebrity-interviews/big-brother-dick-daniele The 'Big Brother 8' Winning Father-Daughter Team Sounds Off]&lt;/ref&gt; Donato is the father of Vincent and [[Daniele Donato]].

'''Donald W. Gant''' (October 24, 1942 – March 15, 1987) was an [[United States|American]] [[singing|singer]], [[songwriter]] and [[record producer]].

With [[Tupper Saussy]], in the late 1960s he formed "[[The Neon Philharmonic]]."  Singing vocals, with Saussy on the keyboards, they recorded five [[single (music)|singles]] and two albums for [[Warner Bros. Records]] between 1969 and 1971.  The albums were ''[[The Moth Confesses]]'' (1969), containing the duo's biggest hit "Morning Girl" (peaked at #17 on 7–14 June 1969), and the eponymous ''[[The Neon Philharmonic (album)|The Neon Philharmonic]]'' (1969).

In [[Nashville, Tennessee]] he worked at [[Acuff-Rose Music]] as a songwriter and as an executive. He wrote a number of songs himself and co-wrote with [[Joe Melson]]. Songwriter [[Mickey Newbury]] said of Gant that there are "A lot of songwriters you'd never have heard of if it wasn't for Don Gant." Gant also produced records for singers [[Jimmy Buffett]], [[Lefty Frizzell]], [[Eddy Raven]], [[Roy Orbison]] when he was with [[MGM Records]] and others and eventually joined [[ABC Records]].

Don Gant died unexpectedly at the age of 44 in Nashville of complications following a serious boating accident in Florida.

A '''drummer''' was responsible for the drums in the army for use on the battlefield. Drums were part of the field music for hundreds of years, being introduced by the Ottomans to Europe. Chinese armies however had used drums even before that. With the professionalization of armies, military music was developed as well. Drums were not only used for the men to march in step, but were an important part of the [[battle]]field communications system, with various [[drum roll]]s used to signal different commands from officers to troops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genealogyforum.com/gfaol/resource/Military/Drummer.htm U.S. Civil War History &amp; Genealogy – The Drummer Boys], genealogyforum.com&lt;/ref&gt; By the second half of the 18th century, most, -if not all western armies had a standardized set of marches and signals to be played, often accompanied by fifers.

==The idea of the "Drummer Boy"==
The romantic idea about drummers is that they were young boys (for instance the Christmas carol "The Little Drummer Boy", or the painting "Steady the Drums"). The fact, though, is that drummers were more often adult men, recruited like the common soldiers. Fifers, on the other hand, being not an official part of the regiments early on, were usually recruited from young boys. During the second half of the 19th century, it was accepted in many western armies that under aged boys served as drummers. 

Although there were usually official age limits, these were often ignored; the youngest boys were sometimes treated as [[mascot]]s by the adult soldiers. The life of a drummer boy appeared rather glamorous and as a result, boys would sometimes run away from home to enlist.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ArxMQHZlEOsC&amp;pg=PA107 Albert A. Nofi, ''A Civil War Treasury: Being a Miscellany of Arms and Artillery, Facts and Figures, Legends and Lore'' Da Capo Press 1992 (p.107)]&lt;/ref&gt; Other boys may have been the sons or orphans of soldiers serving in the same unit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_NcDBlj7htsC&amp;pg=PA274 Richard Holmes, ''Soldiers: Army Lives and Loyalties from Redcoats to Dusty Warriors'', Harper Press 2011 (p.275)]&lt;/ref&gt; The image of a small child in the midst of battle was seen as deeply poignant by 19th-century artists, and idealised boy drummers were frequently depicted in paintings, sculpture and poetry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=h_C8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA101 J. W. M. Hichberger, ''Images of the Army: The Military in British Art, 1815–1914''], Manchester University Press 1988, {{ISBN|0-7190-2575-3}} (p.101)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Child soldier in the US Civil War.jpg|thumb|left|Drummer boy [[John Clem]] during the [[American Civil War]].]]
[[Nathan Futrell]] (1773–1829) was said to have been the youngest drummer boy in the [[American War of Independence]]; he joined the North Carolina Continental Militia at the age of 7.

In 1793, [[Joseph Bara]], a 14-year-old [[French Revolutionary Army|French Republican]] drummer at the time of the [[War in the Vendée]], was killed by royalist counter-revolutionaries, supposedly while he was shouting "Long live the Republic!". His body was interred at the [[Panthéon]] along with other national heroes.&lt;ref&gt;Dupuy, Pascal, [http://www.histoire-image.org/site/oeuvre/analyse.php?i=344 ''La Mort de Bara''] http://www.histoire-image.org ''L’Histoire par l’image'' (in French). Retrieved: 19 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

[[André Estienne]] was a drummer with [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s army at the [[Battle of the Bridge of Arcole]] in 1796, where he led his [[battalion]] across a river while holding his drum over his head, and on reaching the far bank, beat the "charge". This led to the capture of the bridge and the rout of the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] army. Despite being 19 years old, he became famous as ''Le Petit Tambour d'Arcole'' ({{lang-fr|The Little Drummer of Arcole}}), and is depicted in the [[Panthéon, Paris|Panthéon in Paris]] and on the [[Arc de Triomphe]], also in paintings by [[Charles Thévenin]] and [[Horace Vernet]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.napoleon.org/en%5Ccollectors_corner%5Cobject%5Cfiles%5C480511.asp Fondation Napoléon – Honorary drumsticks presented to the drummer of Arcole] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528033336/http://www.napoleon.org/en%5Ccollectors_corner%5Cobject%5Cfiles%5C480511.asp |date=May 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 April 1855, at the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854–1855)|Siege of Sevastopol]] during the [[Crimean War]], there was a bayonet attack by the British [[77th (East Middlesex) Regiment of Foot|77th Regiment of Foot]] on some rifle pits which the Russians were using to [[Sniper|snipe]] at British positions. Accompanying the attack was an unnamed drummer boy of the 77th, who seeing a Russian boy trumpeter trying to escape, caught hold of him and beat him with his fists "in truly British fashion" until he surrendered. The boy presented the Russian trumpet to Sir [[George Brown (British Army officer)|George Brown]] and he was later rewarded by General [[FitzRoy Somerset, 1st Baron Raglan|Lord Raglan]], the British commander.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Carter (writer)|Thomas Carter]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=5QoLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA77 ''Medals of the British Army: and How They Were Won: Volume 1'', Groombridge and Son, London 1861 (p.77)]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Siege of Lucknow]] during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], 12-year-old Drummer Ross of the [[93rd Highlanders]] signalled the arrival of his regiment to the besieged garrison, by climbing the spire of the [[Shah Najaf Mosque]] and playing the regimental march on his bugle, while under heavy fire from the rebel forces.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_NcDBlj7htsC&amp;pg=PA274 Holmes, (p.275)]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 November at the [[Second Battle of Cawnpore]], 15-year-old [[Thomas Flynn (VC)|Thomas Flynn]], a drummer with the [[64th Regiment of Foot]], was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]]. "During a charge on the enemy's guns, Drummer Flynn, although wounded himself, engaged in a hand-to-hand encounter with two of the rebel artillerymen". He remains the youngest recipient of the medal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.athloneheritage.com/famo/tflinn.html Athlone Heritage – Drummer Thomas Flynn VC]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bank of England (14167257336).jpg|thumb|right|The night guard (including, in the foreground, a young drummer wearing a [[Corps of drums|laced tunic]] and carrying a bugle) arriving at the [[Bank of England]], 1906.]]

Thirteen-year-old [[Charles E. King (soldier)|Charles King]] was the youngest soldier killed in the entire [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865). Charles enlisted in the [[49th Pennsylvania Infantry|49th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry]] with the reluctant permission of his father at the age of 12 years, 5 months and 9 days. On September 17, 1862 at the [[Battle of Antietam]] he was mortally wounded near or in the area of the [[East Woods]], carried from the field and died three days later. Twelve-year-old drummer boy [[William Black (soldier)|William Black]] was the youngest recorded person wounded in battle during the [[American Civil War]]. [[John Clem]], who had unofficially joined a Union Army regiment at the age of 9 as a drummer and mascot, became famous as "The Drummer Boy of [[Battle of Chickamauga|Chickamauga]]" where he played a "long roll" and shot a Confederate officer who had demanded his surrender. An 11-year-old drummer in the Confederate [[Orphan Brigade]], known only as "Little Oirish", was credited with rallying troops at the [[Battle of Shiloh]] by taking up the [[Colours, standards and guidons|regimental colors]] at a critical moment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ArxMQHZlEOsC&amp;pg=PA107 Nofi, (p.108)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Costa Rica]], the Drummer boy [[Juan Santamaría]] died in an act of self-sacrifice in the war against the US Filibuster [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]] and is commemorated as his country's [[Folk hero|National Hero]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==Decline==
[[File:Isandhlwana.jpg|thumb|right|''The Last Stand at Isandlwana'' by C E Fripp shows a small drummer boy in the ranks, despite the youngest soldier present being over 16 years old]]
The use of drums beyond the parade ground declined rapidly as the 19th century progressed, being replaced by the [[bugle]] in the signalling role, although it was often the drummers who were required to play them. A widely reported incident at the [[Battle of Isandlwana]] during the [[Anglo-Zulu War]] of 1879, spelled the end of boys being sent on active service by the [[British Army]]. Part of the British force returned to their camp at night to find that it had been overrun by the [[Zulu Kingdom|Zulu]] army a few hours previously. An eyewitness reported that "Even the little drummer boys that we had in the band, they were hung up on hooks, and opened like sheep. It was a pitiful sight". Doubt has since been cast on this account, since the youngest drummer to be killed was 18, and the youngest boy present was 16.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=s2mbl5xPOcUC&amp;pg=PP150 Ian Knight, ''Zulu Rising: The Epic Story of iSandlwana and Rorke's Drift'', Pan Books 2011] {{ISBN|978-0330445931}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, [[Charles Edwin Fripp]]'s famous painting, ''The Last Stand at Isandlwana'', shows a small blond-haired boy amongst the adult soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Brwn2jz-mMMC&amp;pg=PA64 Ian Knight, ''Isandlwana 1879: The Great Zulu Victory''], Osprey Publishing Limited 2002, {{ISBN|1-84176-511-2}} (p.64)&lt;/ref&gt;
The US Army kept drummers and fifers with the infantry, until they were finally abolished in the field in 1917. Drums, like other instruments, were now only used for parades and ceremonies.

'''Edward Joseph Costello''' was the only person from the geographical area now known as [[Northern Ireland]] to be killed in the 1916 [[Easter Rising]] in [[Ireland]].

==Biography==
Costello was born in [[Lurgan]], [[County Armagh]] to Edward (snr) and Rose Costello. His parents came to Lurgan from [[Kilcock]], County Kildare to work in a family business which was in the town centre.

Edward Joseph worked as a clerk in Johnston and Allen’s Linen Manufacturers in Victoria Street, Lurgan.  He married Annie and lived in number 3 Castle Lane Lurgan. In 1914 he left Lurgan to seek employment in [[Dublin]]. His death certificate lists his final occupation as a [[pawn broker]]'s assistant.

He joined the [[Irish Citizen Army]] in 1915. His wife Annie remained in Lurgan. He made frequent visits back to the town to see his wife and children.

He took part in the Easter Rising in April 1916, and received a fatal bullet wound to the head on 25 April, dying later in Jervis Street Hospital. He was aged 27 years. His brother James registered the death. He was buried in [[Glasnevin Cemetery]]  on 1 May 1916. His grave is in the St, Paul’s section, DC 30. At present there is no headstone on his grave.

His widow remained in Lurgan and raised his children in the town. They moved from Castle Lane in the 1950s, moving to number 1 Antrim Road Lurgan. His widow Annie Costello died in Lurgan on 22 March 1959.

==Early life==

Janes' father was Captain [[Leroy Lansing Janes]] (1837-1909)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancestry.com 1880 United States Federal Census, Maryland]&lt;/ref&gt;. His mother was Harriet Waterbury Scudder Janes (1847-1885)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancestry.com California Death Index, 1940-1997]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Professional life==

E.P. Janes, as he was known professionally, built many English and Spanish style "homes of distinction in scenic Altadena" between 1924 and 1926. Born in New York, Janes and his wife Harriet moved to Altadena in 1924. His homes have been called "Janes Cottages&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.janesvillage.org Janes Village, Altadena, California]&lt;/ref&gt;." The area where his homes were built is now called Historic Janes Village because of his distinctive homes.

==Board of Public Works==
Kuhn's first job out of college was as the private secretary to Mayor [[Claiborne Hooper Phillips]]. His brother Casper was city auditor.&lt;ref&gt;http://archives.nd.edu/Scholastic/VOL_0017/VOL_0017_ISSUE_0009.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Ferdinand Kuhn was then a secretary and city recorder for the Board of Public Works and Affairs from 1884 until 1903.&lt;ref&gt;e. g.

==Knights of Columbus==
===Initiation===
Kuhn was initiated into the [[Knights of Columbus]], a Catholic fraternal service organization, in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], on July 1, 1899. He was one of the first five from south of Louisville to be initiated on that day.&lt;ref name=ark&gt;{{cite news|url=http://arc.stparchive.com/Archive/ARC/ARC10091915p22.php|title=A Knight With A Rare Record|work=The Guardian|date=October 9, 1915|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other four were: Messrs. H. J. Grimes, Will J. Varley, William Smith, and Michael M.

===Southern expansion===
&lt;blockquote&gt;Ferdinand Kuhn was one of the Nashville Catholics who had advocated expansion into Tennessee. The 1900 compromise allowed for the formation of Nashville Council No. 544.  Kuhn, who became Tennessee's first State Deputy, succeeded Daniel J. Callahan as the master ceremonialist, presiding at the institution ceremonies of councils in Florida (1900), Alabama (1902), Louisiana (1902), and Georgia (1902).  His degree work at the opening of New Orleans Council No. 714 in November 1902 was long remembered as 'something out of this world'.&lt;ref&gt;Faith and Fraternalism: The History of the Knights of Columbus 1882-1982 by Christopher J Kauffman; p. 106-107.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===State deputy===
Kuhn was the first state deputy of Tennessee from 1902 to 1908. In 1920 he was Grand Knight of Nashville Council 544.&lt;ref name=sixty/&gt;

==Shoe merchant==

Kuhn was president and treasurer of the Kuhn, Cooper, Geary &amp; Company shoe store, founded in 1903 with Ed P. Cooper and P. J.

It was once the largest retail shoe store in the South,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|volume=1|title=The American Catholic Who's Who|page=342|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J6wNAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Kuhn+Cooper+Geary&amp;dq=Kuhn+Cooper+Geary&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IfylT4WwDo7rtgfg_sjHBA&amp;ved=0CGYQ6AEwCQ#}}&lt;/ref&gt; and earned a reputation as the premiere [[footwear]] store in downtown Nashville.&lt;ref name=:5/&gt; The most up-to-date electric lighting and [[Parabolic loudspeaker|holophone]] reflectors provided lighting for the store. Its front window displayed shoes on revolving pedestals.

Kuhn was the president of the Retail Shoe Dealers' Association in 1906,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Shoe Retailer and Boots and Shoes Weekly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7tw-AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA3-PA39&amp;lpg=RA3-PA39#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=39|date=July 28, 1906|title=No Shoes On Approval}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of the Retail Credit Men's Association in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=29|title=The Notre Dame Scholastic|url=http://www.archives.nd.edu/Scholastic/VOL_0054/VOL_0054_ISSUE_0002.pdf|volume=54|number=2|date=October 2, 1920}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nashville Vols==
[[File:1908NashvilleVols2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The 1908 Nashville Vols. Kuhn is top left.]]
Kuhn was the president of the [[Nashville Vols]] [[baseball]] club from 1908 to 1910,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Spalding's Official Base Ball Guide|pages=164; 308|year=1907|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E6gpAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the 1908 [[Southern Association]] championship team.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Greatest-Game-Ever-Played-Dixie/dp/0786430508|title=The Greatest Game Ever Played In Dixie|author= John A. Simpson|publisher=McFarland|date=2007|pages = 32, 180}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was preceded in that capacity by [[Bradley Walker]]. Kuhn was head of a group of men who purchased the team after a last place finish in 1907. Along with Kuhn the group consisted of: James B. Carr (president of B. H. Stief Jewelry Co.); Thomas James Tyne (lawyer and state legislator); J. T. Connor (real estate); James A. Bowling (contractor); Robert L. Bolling (lawyer); Rufus E. Fort (physician); and William G. Hirsig (automobile and tire dealer). Well known attorney S. A. Champion supplied legal services. The group envisioned an ambitious project of stadium renovations at [[Sulphur Dell]], and managed to cull $50,000. Kuhn was selected to head the Board of Directors.&lt;ref name=:5/&gt; He went on a trip to [[Ponce de Leon Park]] in Atlanta to observe a modern park and plan renovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3956517/the_tennessean/|work=The Tennessean|date=January 22, 1908|page=8|accessdate=January 9, 2016|title=In Sulphur Dell|author=[[Grantland Rice]]|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1908&amp;ndash;1910===
Kuhn hired [[Bill Bernhard]] as manager. In 1908 the team won the Southern pennant by beating the [[New Orleans Pelicans (baseball)|New Orleans Pelicans]] in the last game, described by [[Grantland Rice]] as the "greatest game ever played in [[Southern United States|Dixie]]".&lt;ref name=:5/&gt;

Nashville entered the final day of that season on September 19 with an opportunity to win the league pennant. The championship would be decided by the [[1908 Nashville vs. New Orleans baseball game|last game of the season]] at [[Sulphur Dell]]. Both teams had the same number of losses (56), but the Pelicans were in first place with 76 wins to the Vols' second-place 74. A crowd of 11,000&amp;nbsp;spectators, including Kuhn, who sat next to Mayor [[James Stephens Brown]], saw [[Carl Sitton]] hurl a three-hit, 1–0 shutout, giving Nashville their third Southern Association pennant by 0.1&amp;nbsp;percentage points (57.25% to 57.14%). [[Ted Breitenstein]] was New Orleans's pitcher.
[[File:SouthernBaseballGuys.jpg|thumb|250px|Kuhn ''(middle)'' with Southern Association president [[William Marmaduke Kavanaugh]] ''(left)'']]
One account reads: "By one run, by one point, Nashville has won the Southern League pennant, nosing New Orleans out literally by an eyelash. Saturday's game, which was the deciding one, between Nashville and New Orleans was the greatest exhibition of the national game ever seen in the south and the finish in the league race probably sets a record in baseball history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=South Sayings|journal=Sporting Life|page=16|date=October 10, 1908|author=[[Hamilton Love]]|url=http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/SportingLife/1908/VOL_52_NO_05/SL5205016.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The championship banner was presented to Kuhn by league president [[William Marmaduke Kavanaugh]], and it hung over the window of Kuhn's shoe store until the banner raising ceremony on Opening Day, 1909.&lt;ref name=:5/&gt;

Kuhn also invented a kind of electric scoreboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/15213250/the_montgomery_times/|date=March 9, 1909|page=8|work=The Montgomery Times|title=Kuhn Score Board Stunt Being Adopted; Will Be Used Here|accessdate=November 19, 2017|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1909 season, New Orleans, Mobile, Montgomery, Memphis, and Atlanta used his design. [[John Heisman]] was president of the Atlanta team.

Following the 1910 season, Kuhn resigned as the team's president. He was succeeded by Hirsig.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3331730/the_tennessean/|work=The Tennessean|title=W. G. Hirsig President Nashville B. B.

'''Franz Sigel''' (November 18, 1824 – August 21, 1902) was a [[German Americans|German American]] military officer, revolutionist and immigrant to the [[United States]] who was a teacher, newspaperman, politician, and served as a [[Union Army|Union]] [[Major general (United States)|major general]] in the [[American Civil War]]. His ability to recruit German-speaking immigrants to the Union armies received the approval of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]], but he was strongly disliked by General-in-Chief [[Henry W. Halleck|Henry Halleck]].

==Early life==
Sigel was born in [[Sinsheim]], [[Grand Duchy of Baden|Baden]] (Germany), and attended the [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in [[Bruchsal]].{{sfn|Wittke|1952|p=237}} He graduated from [[Karlsruhe]] Military Academy in 1843, and was commissioned as a [[lieutenant]] in the [[Baden]] Army. He met the revolutionaries [[Friedrich Hecker]] and [[Gustav von Struve]] and became associated with the revolutionary movement. He was wounded in a duel in 1847. The same year, he retired from the army to begin [[law school]] studies in [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]]. After organizing a revolutionary free corps in [[Mannheim]] and later in the Seekreis county, he soon became a leader of the [[Baden Revolution|Baden revolutionary]] forces (with the rank of [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]]) in the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|1848 Revolution]], being one of the few revolutionaries with military command experience. In April 1848, he led the "Sigel-Zug", recruiting a militia of more than 4,000 volunteers to lead a siege against the city of [[Freiburg]]. His militia was defeated on April 23, 1848 by the numerically inferior but better led troops of the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]]. In 1849, he became Secretary of War and commander-in-chief of the revolutionary republican government of Baden. Wounded in a skirmish, Sigel had to resign his command but continued to support the revolutionary war effort as [[adjutant general]] to his successor [[Ludwik Mieroslawski]]. In July, after the defeat of the revolutionaries by Prussian troops and Mieroslawski's departure, Sigel led the retreat of the remaining troops in their flight to [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="NIE"&gt;{{harvnb|Gilman|Thurston|Colby|1905}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sigel later went on to [[England]]. Sigel emigrated to the [[United States]] in 1852, as did many other German ''[[Forty-Eighters]]''.

Sigel taught in the [[New York City]] public schools and served in the state militia. He married a daughter of [[Rudolf Dulon]] and taught in Dulon's school.{{sfn|Wilson|Fiske|1900}} In 1857, he became a professor at the German-American Institute in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]]. He was elected director of the St. Louis public schools in 1860. He was influential in the Missouri immigrant community. He attracted Germans to the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and antislavery causes when he openly supported them in 1861.

==Civil War==
Shortly after the start of the war, Sigel was commissioned [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] of the 3rd Missouri Infantry, a commission dating from May 4, 1861. He recruited and organized an expedition to southwest Missouri, and subsequently fought the [[Battle of Carthage (1861)|Battle of Carthage]], where a force of pro-[[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] Missouri militia handed him a setback in a strategically insignificant fight. However, Sigel's defeat did help spark recruitment for the [[Missouri State Guard]] and local Confederate forces. Sigel later took part in a skirmish at [[Dug Springs]].&lt;ref name="NIE"/&gt;

Throughout the summer, President Lincoln actively sought the support of antislavery, pro-Unionist immigrants. Sigel, always popular with the German immigrants, was a good candidate to advance this plan. He was promoted to [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] on August 7, 1861, to rank from May 17, one of a number of early [[political general]]s endorsed by Lincoln.

Sigel served under Brig. Gen [[Nathaniel Lyon]] in the capture of the Confederate [[Camp Jackson Affair|Camp Jackson]] in St. Louis and at the [[Battle of Wilson's Creek]], where his command was routed after making a march around the Confederate camp and attacking from the rear. Sigel conducted the retreat of the army after the death of General Lyon.&lt;ref name="NIE"/&gt;

[[File:Franz Sigel 106 RSD jeh.JPG|thumb|left|Riverside Drive, New York City]]
His finest performance came on March 8, 1862, at the [[Battle of Pea Ridge]], where he commanded two [[division (military)|divisions]] and personally directed the Union artillery in the defeat of [[Major General (CSA)|Maj. Gen.]] [[Earl Van Dorn]] on the second day of the battle.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Sigel was promoted to major general on March 21, 1862. He served as a division commander in the [[Shenandoah Valley]] and fought unsuccessfully against Maj. Gen. [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson]], who managed to outwit and defeat the larger Union force in a number of small engagements. He commanded the [[I Corps (Union Army)|I Corps]] in Maj. Gen. [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]]'s [[Army of Virginia]] at the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]], another Union defeat, where he was wounded in the hand.

Over the winter of 1862–63, Sigel commanded the [[XI Corps (Union Army)|XI Corps]], consisting primarily of German immigrant soldiers, in the [[Army of the Potomac]]. During this period, the corps saw no action; it stayed in reserve during the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]]. Sigel had developed a reputation as an inept general, but his ability to recruit and motivate German immigrants kept him employed in a politically sensitive position. Many of these soldiers could speak little English beyond "I'm going to fight mit Sigel",{{sfn|Poole|2014}} which was their proud slogan and which became one of the favorite songs of the war.
 
They were quite disgruntled when Sigel left the corps in February 1863, and was replaced by Major-General [[Oliver O. Howard]], who had no immigrant affinities. Fortunately for Sigel, the two black marks in the XI Corps' reputation—[[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville]] and [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]]—would occur after he was relieved.

The reason for Sigel's relief is unclear. Some accounts cite failing health; others that he expressed his displeasure at the small size of his corps and asked to be relieved. General-in-chief [[Henry W. Halleck]] detested Sigel, and managed to keep him relegated to light duty in eastern [[Pennsylvania]] until March 1864. President Lincoln, for political reasons, directed [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Edwin M. Stanton]] to place Sigel in command of the new Department of [[West Virginia]].

In his new command, Sigel opened the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864]], launching an invasion of the [[Shenandoah Valley]]. He was soundly defeated by Maj. Gen. [[John C. Breckinridge]] at the [[Battle of New Market]], on May 15, 1864, which was particularly embarrassing due to the prominent role young cadets from the [[Virginia Military Institute]] played in his defeat. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} After the battle, Sigel was replaced by Maj. Gen. [[David Hunter]]. In July, Sigel fought [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|Lt. Gen.]] [[Jubal A. Early]] at [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry]],{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} but soon afterward was replaced by [[Albion P. Howe]].

Sigel spent the rest of the war without an active command.

==Postbellum career==
[[File:Appleton's Sigel Franz.jpg|thumb|Portrait from [[Appleton's Cyclopedia of American Biography|Appleton's Cyclopedia]]]]
Sigel resigned his commission on May 4, 1865. He worked as editor of the ''[[Baltimore Wecker]]'' for a short time,&lt;ref name="NIE"/&gt; and then as a newspaper editor in [[New York City]]. He filled a variety of political positions there, both as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] and a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]. In [[New York state election, 1869|1869]], he ran on the Republican ticket for [[Secretary of State of New York]], losing to the incumbent Democrat [[Homer Augustus Nelson]]. In May 1871 he became collector of internal revenue, and then in October 1871 register of the city.{{sfn|Reynolds|1921}} In 1887, President [[Grover Cleveland]] appointed him pension agent for the city of New York. He also lectured, worked in advertising and published the ''New York Monthly'', a German-American periodical, for some years.&lt;ref name="NIE"/&gt;

Franz Sigel died in New York in 1902 and is buried in [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx, New York)|Woodlawn Cemetery]] in [[The Bronx]], [[New York City]]. [[Elsie Sigel]], the victim of a famous murder, was his granddaughter.

==Honors==
Statues of him stand in [[Riverside Park (Manhattan)|Riverside Park]], corner 106th Street in [[Manhattan]] and in [[Forest Park (St. Louis)|Forest Park]] in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]]. There is also a park named for him in [[the Bronx]], just south of the Courthouse near [[Yankee Stadium]].{{sfn|''New York City Department of Parks &amp; Recreation''}} Siegel Street in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]] was named after him,{{sfn|Benardo|Weiss|2006|pp=28–29}} Sigel Street in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] was also named after him, as well as the village of [[Sigel, Pennsylvania]], founded in 1865, in addition to Sigel, Illinois, which was settled in 1863. [[Sigel Township, Minnesota]], settled in 1856 and organized in April 1862, was also named for Sigel.  In about 1873 Sigel himself visited Sigel Township and [[New Ulm, Minnesota|New Ulm]], [[Minnesota]].{{sfn|Upham|2001|p=75}}

'''Georgiann Davis''' is an assistant professor of sociology at [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unlv.edu/people/georgiann-davis-phd |title=University of Nevada, Las Vegas: Georgiann Davis, Ph.D.|accessdate=2014-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and author of the book ''Contesting Intersex: The Dubious Diagnosis''.&lt;ref name="nyu" /&gt; Davis formerly held a similar position at [[Southern Illinois University Edwardsville]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.siue.edu/sociology/Sociology_faculty.html | title = Department of Sociology &amp; Criminal Justice Studies | last = [[Southern Illinois University Edwardsville]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Born with [[Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome]], she writes widely on [[intersex]] issues and the sociology of diagnosis.

== Early life ==

In a video for [[Advocates for Informed Choice#The Interface Project|The Interface Project]], Davis states how she was born with [[complete androgen insensitivity syndrome]] and diagnosed as an adolescent after experiencing abdominal pain. Her [[Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome#Gonadectomy|testes were removed]], but she wasn't told her diagnosis: she was told she had cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.interfaceproject.org/georgiann-davis/ | title = Georgiann Davis | work = [[Advocates for Informed Choice#The Interface Project|The Interface Project]] | date = November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article for ''[[Ms. Magazine]]'', she says:
{{quotation|"cancer rhetoric is used to justify surgical interventions ... A body that challenges binary understandings of sex is scary to those who refuse to embrace natural biological diversity found across species. For years, many medical doctors reached for their scalpels to ease their fears and assert their authority over the body."&lt;ref name="susie" &gt;{{Cite news| last = Davis| first = Georgiann| title = Standing with Susie the Dachshund| work = Ms. Magazine| date = 2013-05-09| url = http://msmagazine.com/blog/2013/05/09/standing-with-susie-the-dachshund/}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Works ==

===Book===

''Contesting Intersex: The Dubious Diagnosis'' by Georgiann Davis examines the history of the U.S. intersex movement, with a focus on the medicalization of intersex bodies and a contested shift in clinical language from intersex to "disorders of sex development".&lt;ref name="nyu"&gt;{{cite book | author1-last= Davis | author1-first= Georgiann |author1-link= Georgiann Davis |date= 2015 |title=  Contesting Intersex: The Dubious Diagnosis |url=http://nyupress.org/books/9781479887040/ |location= New York |publisher= [[NYU Press]] |isbn=9781479887040 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Published by [[NYU Press]], the book has been positively reviewed. Elizabeth Reis comments that Davis's work contains "piercing interviews and astute analysis", while Choice describes he book as a "compelling account of how activists, parents, assorted medical specialists and institutions, and people with intersex traits respond to the diversity of human reproductive development".&lt;ref name = "nyu" /&gt;

===Scholarly and other works===
Georgiann Davis has written both scholarly articles, and opinion articles for broader audiences. Her scholarly work includes articles on the issues of [[Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis]] (PGD), Olympic sex-testing, and both medical terminology and the medical profession.

In the 2011 article, "'DSD is a Perfectly Fine Term': Reasserting Medical Authority through a Shift in Intersex Terminology", Davis examines the state of medical treatment for intersex traits, following a 2006 ''Consensus Statement on the Management of Intersex Disorders.''&lt;ref name="lee"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = P.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|Medical professionals needed to maintain their authority in the face of intersex activism, and they did so linguistically through a reinvention of the intersex diagnosis. The new DSD terminology constructs "sex" as a scientific phenomenon, and a binary one at that...This places intersexuality neatly into medical turf and safely away from critics of its medicalisation.}}

Davis's analysis was referenced by a committee of the [[Senate of Australia]] in 2013.&lt;ref name="SenateOnSterilisation"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Community_Affairs/Involuntary_Sterilisation/Sec_Report/index | title = Involuntary or coerced sterilisation of intersex people in Australia | last1 = Community Affairs Committee | last2 = [[Senate of Australia]] | date = October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Out of Bounds? A Critique of the New Policies on Hyperandrogenism in Elite Female Athletes", a collaborative article with [[Katrina Karkazis]], [[Rebecca Jordan-Young]], and Silvia Camporesi, published in 2012 in the ''[[American Journal of Bioethics]]'', they argue that a new sex testing policy by the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] will not protect against breaches of privacy, will require athletes to undergo unnecessary treatment in order to compete, and will intensify "gender policing". They recommend that athletes be able to compete in accordance with their legal gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In 2013, her article "The Social Costs of Preempting Intersex Traits" was published in the ''[[American Journal of Bioethics]]''. She questions the use of [[Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis]] to select against intersex traits, arguing that intersex traits reflect necessary natural diversity; deselection of intersex embyros essentially protects "binary ideologies about sex and its presumed correlation with gender". She describes this as a form of sex eugenics that would "obliterate" an intersex community of individuals leading full and happy lives, a community that forces "society to disentangle sex and gender, and in the process, open up new possibilities for embracing all sorts of human diversity." Further, if de-selection of intersex traits is “morally permissible” due to stigma and poor social outcomes, then "we need to recognize that a major source of the shame and stigma individuals with intersex traits face originates in the medical profession"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5363">[[Image:Freeman-will-excerpt.standard.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Excerpt of Henry G. Freeman Jr.'s will establishing the Henry G. Freeman Jr. Pin Money Fund.]]

The '''Henry G. Freeman Jr. Pin Money Fund''' was the operating name of an annuity fund of the Henry G. Freeman Jr. Trust, benefiting the [[First lady of the United States|First Ladies]] of the United States. The fund was established as part of the will (written in 1912) of Henry G. Freeman Jr., a prominent [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] real estate developer.

Freeman believed that the [[president of the United States]] was paid a "miserable pittance", and that a way of increasing his income while avoiding the appearance of political gifts was to institute an annuity to be paid "to the lady termed the first lady in the land; that is, the President of the United States [sic] wife, or anyone representing the president as such, should he not be married or should she die during his administration." Freeman's will specified that the money be for the first lady's "own and absolute use" and the payments "shall continue in force as long as this glorious government exists."

Freeman died in 1917, but the fund did not take effect immediately.&lt;ref name="tribune"&gt;{{cite news |title=$12,000 Annuity Left by a Will to 'First Lady' |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |agency=[[Associated Press|AP]] |date=1931-03-06 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fund came to public knowledge in 1931, when Freeman's son died.&lt;ref name="tribune"/&gt; A contemporary newspaper report stated that "legal experts" were divided as to whether the First Ladies' [[annuity]] would begin at that time, whether it would have to wait for Freeman's other annuity beneficiaries to die out, or whether it would be altogether invalid under the [[rule against perpetuities]].&lt;ref name="tribune"/&gt; In the event, no First Ladies actually received any funds until Freeman's descendants died out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Marcus |first1=Ruth |title=Barbara's 'Pin Money': A Thimble Explanation |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1994/04/20/barbaras-pin-money-a-thimble-explanation/73a874ba-1ac8-4029-b560-40c2eea3dd20/ |accessdate=2018-01-28 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=1994-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fund became active in November 1989 during the administration of [[George H.W. Bush]], but due to a court dispute the first payments were not made until December 1992. [[Barbara Bush]] received $36,000 retroactively and donated a portion to her charity work, and spent an unspecified amount doing "something nice for my grandchildren." First Lady [[Hillary Clinton]] and First Lady [[Laura Bush]] donated the payments to charity. The income was taxable, and the fund was overseen by [[Wells Fargo Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/potus-278-2009.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

When [[Michelle Obama]] was First Lady, she received payments under the fund in 2009 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Werner|first1=Erica|title=Obama's financial disclosure forms released. Bo Obama only worth $1,600!|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/From-the-news-wires/2010/0518/Obama-s-financial-disclosure-forms-released.-Bo-Obama-only-worth-1-600|accessdate=2018-01-28|work=[[Christian Science Monitor]]|agency=[[Associated Press|AP]]|date=2010-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rubin"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rubin |first1=Richard |last2=Weiss |first2=Michael |title=First Lady Is an Unpaid Gig, and in 1912, a Man Named Henry G.

where Hyman and his future Ramones bandmates attended [[Forest Hills High School (New York)|Forest Hills High School]]. Though happy, Hyman was something of an outcast, diagnosed at 18 with [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]]. He grew up with his brother [[Mickey Leigh]]. His mother, Charlotte Lesher, divorced her first husband, Noel Hyman. She married a second time but was widowed by a car accident while she was on vacation. At birth, Joey was born with a parasitic twin, which was a malformed Siamese twin growing out of his back. The twin was incomplete and thus it was surgically removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ramone|first1=Marky|last2=Herschlag|first2=Rich|title=Punk Rock Blitzkrieg: My Life As A Ramone|date=2015|publisher=Music Press Books|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyman was a fan of [[the Beatles]],&lt;ref&gt;

His idol was [[Pete Townshend]] of the Who, with whom he shared a birthday. Hyman took up the drums at 13, and played them throughout his teen years before picking up an acoustic guitar at age 17.

==Sniper==

In 1972 Hyman joined the [[glam punk]] band [[Sniper (American band)|Sniper]]. Sniper played at the [[Mercer Arts Center]], [[Max's Kansas City]] and the Coventry, alongside the [[New York Dolls]], [[Suicide (band)|Suicide]], and [[Jayne County|Queen Elizabeth III]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mickey Leigh: "I was shocked when the band came out. Joey was the lead singer and I couldn't believe how good he was. Because he'd been sitting in my house with my acoustic guitar, writing these songs like 'I Don't Care', fucking up my guitar, and suddenly he's this guy on stage who you can't take your eyes off of."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"/&gt; Hyman continued playing with Sniper until early 1974, when he was replaced by Alan Turner.

==Ramones==
In 1974, Jeffrey Hyman co-founded the [[punk rock]] band the [[Ramones]] with friends [[Johnny Ramone|John Cummings]] and [[Dee Dee Ramone|Douglas Colvin]]. Colvin was already using the pseudonym "Dee Dee Ramone" and the others also adopted stage names using "Ramone" as their surname: Cummings became Johnny Ramone and Hyman became Joey Ramone. The name "Ramone" stems from [[Paul McCartney]]: he briefly used the stage name "Paul Ramon" during 1960/1961, when [[the Beatles]], still an unknown five-piece band called the Silver Beetles, did a tour of Scotland and all took up pseudonyms; and again on a 1969 Steve Miller album where he played the drums on one song using that name.

Joey initially served as the group's drummer while Dee Dee Ramone was the original vocalist.  However, when Dee Dee's vocal cords proved unable to sustain the demands of consistent live performances, Ramones manager [[Tommy Ramone|Thomas Erdelyi]] suggested Joey switch to vocals.  After a series of unsuccessful auditions in search of a new drummer, Erdelyi took over on drums, assuming the name Tommy Ramone.&lt;ref name="allmusic"/&gt;

The Ramones were a major influence on the punk rock movement in the United States, though they achieved only minor commercial success. Their only record with enough U.S. sales to be certified gold was the compilation album ''Ramones Mania''. Recognition of the band's importance built over the years, and they are now regularly represented in many assessments of all-time great rock music, such as the ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' lists of the 50 Greatest Artists of All Time and 25 Greatest Live Albums of All Time, [[VH1]]'s 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock, and Mojo's 100 Greatest Albums. In 2002, the Ramones were voted the second greatest rock and roll band ever in ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'', trailing only [[the Beatles]].

In 1996, after a tour with the [[Lollapalooza]] music festival, the band played their final show and then disbanded.

==Vocal style==

Ramone's voice was within a [[tenor]] range. His signature cracks, hiccups, snarls, crooning and youthful voice made his one of punk rock's most recognizable voices. [[Allmusic.com]] claims that "Joey Ramone's signature bleat was the voice of punk rock in America."&lt;ref name="allmusic" /&gt; As his vocals matured and deepened through his career, so did the Ramones' songwriting, leaving a notable difference from his initial melodic and callow style—two notable tracks serving as examples are "[[Somebody Put Something in My Drink]]" and "Mama's Boy". [[Dee Dee Ramone]] was quoted as saying "All the other singers [in New York] were copying [[David Johansen]] (of [[the New York Dolls]]), who was copying [[Mick Jagger]]... But Joey was unique, totally unique."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Strongman (2008), p.&amp;nbsp;61.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other projects==
[[Image:JoeyRamonePlaceBowery.jpg|thumb|Joey Ramone was honored with the creation of "Joey Ramone Place" outside the address of [[CBGB]] in New York City.]]

In 1985, Ramone joined [[Steven Van Zandt]]'s music industry activist group [[Artists United Against Apartheid]], which campaigned against the [[Sun City, North West|Sun City]] resort in South Africa. Ramone and 49 other recording artists – including [[Bob Dylan]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Keith Richards]], [[Lou Reed]] and [[Run DMC]] — collaborated on the song "[[Sun City (song)|Sun City]]", in which they pledged they would never perform at the resort.

In 1994, Ramone appeared on the [[Helen Love]] album ''Love and Glitter, Hot Days and Music'', singing the track "Punk Boy". Helen Love returned the favor, singing on Ramone's song "[[Mr. Punchy]]".

In October 1996, Ramone headlined the "Rock the Reservation"  alternative rock festival in Tuba City, Arizona.&lt;ref name="VH1 News"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaufman |first=Gil |url=http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/508440/19961022/story.jhtml |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130209003637/http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/508440/19961022/story.jhtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-09 |title=Joey Ramone Rocks The Reservation |publisher=Vh1.com |accessdate=2015-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Joey Ramone &amp; the Resistance' (Daniel Rey on guitar, John Connor on bass guitar and Roger Murdock on drums) debuted Ramone's interpretation of Louis Armstrong's "Wonderful World' live, as well as Ramone's choice of Ramones classics and some of his other favorite songs; The Dave Clark Five's "Any Way You Want It", The Who's "The Kids are Alright" and The Stooges' "No Fun."

Ramone co-wrote and recorded the song "Meatball Sandwich" with [[Youth Gone Mad]]. For a short time before his death, he took the role of manager and producer for the punk rock band [[The Independents (band)|the Independents]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theindependents.net/bandbio.htm |title=Band Biography |publisher=The Independents |date=April 15, 2001 |accessdate=July 27, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724100441/http://www.theindependents.net/bandbio.htm |archivedate=July 24, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His last recording as a vocalist was backup vocals on the CD ''One Nation Under'' by the Dine Navajo rock group [[Blackfire (band)|Blackfire]]. He appeared on two tracks, "What Do You See" and "Lying to Myself". The 2002 CD won "Best Pop/Rock Album of the Year" at the 2002 Native American Music Awards.&lt;ref name="Blackfire"&gt;[http://www.blackfire.net/index2.shtml Blackfire.net] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090921005846/http://www.blackfire.net/index2.shtml |date=September 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramone produced the [[Ronnie Spector]] album ''[[She Talks to Rainbows]]'' in 1999. It was critically acclaimed but was not very commercially successful. The title track was previously on the [[Ramones]]' final studio album, ''[[¡Adios Amigos!]]''.

==Death and influence==

His solo album ''[[Don't Worry About Me]]'' was released posthumously in 2002, and features the single "[[What a Wonderful World]]", a cover of the [[Louis Armstrong]] standard. [[MTV|MTV News]] claimed: "With his trademark rose-colored shades, black leather jacket, shoulder-length hair, ripped jeans and alternately snarling and crooning vocals, Joey was the iconic godfather of punk."&lt;ref name="MTV News"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaufman |first=Gil |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1442817/20010415/story.jhtml |title=Punk Pioneer Joey Ramone Dead at 49 |publisher=MTV |date=April 15, 2001 |accessdate=July 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 30, 2003, a block of East 2nd Street in New York City was officially renamed Joey Ramone Place.&lt;ref name="JoeyRamonePlace"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ramones.kauhajoki.fi/members/joeyramoneplace.html |title=Joey Ramone Place – Street Sign in New York |publisher=Ramones.kauhajoki.fi/ramones.html |date= |accessdate=July 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the block where Hyman once lived with bandmate [[Dee Dee Ramone]] and is near the former site of the music club [[CBGB]], where the Ramones got their start. Hyman's birthday is celebrated annually by rock 'n' roll nightclubs, hosted in New York City by his brother and, until 2007, his mother, Charlotte. Joey Ramone is interred at [[Hillside Cemetery, Lyndhurst|Hillside Cemetery]] in [[Lyndhurst, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=nyt1&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|authorlink=|title=Sometimes the Grave Is a Fine and Public Place|quote=But there is a slew of other places around New Jersey with their own pantheons.

In 2001, the Ramones were named as inductees to the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], prior to the ceremony held early the following year.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

Several songs have been written in tribute to Joey Ramone. Tommy, [[C. J. Ramone|CJ]] and [[Marky Ramone]] and Daniel Rey came together in 2002 to record [[Jed Davis]]' Joey Ramone tribute album, ''The Bowery Electric''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bowery Electric Crew|url=http://ramonesworld.com/bowery/index.html|publisher=RamonesWorld|accessdate=April 22, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128221558/http://ramonesworld.com/bowery/index.html|archive-date=November 28, 2010|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other tributes include "Hello Joe" by [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] from the album ''[[The Curse of Blondie]]'', "Don't Take Me For Granted" by [[Social Distortion]], "Here's To You" by Minus3, "You Can't Kill Joey Ramone" by [[Sloppy Seconds]], ''Joey'' by [[Raimundos]], "I Wanna Be Your Joey Ramone" by [[Sleater-Kinney]], "Red and White Stripes" by [[Moler]] and "Joey" by the [[Corin Tucker|Corin Tucker Band]], "I Heard Ramona Sing" by [[Frank Black]], and Amy Rigby's "Dancin' With Joey Ramone".  [[Rammstein]] ended several shows of their Mutter tour in 2001 with a cover of "[[Pet Sematary (song)|Pet Sematary]]" in honor of the passing of Joey Ramone.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

In September 2010, the [[Associated Press]] reported that "Joey Ramone Place," a sign at the corner of Bowery and East Second Street, was New York City's most stolen sign. Later, the sign was moved to 20 feet above ground level. Drummer Marky Ramone thought Joey would appreciate the fact that his sign would be the most stolen, adding "Now you have to be an [[NBA]] player to see it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/39383380/ns/today-entertainment/?gt1=43001 |title=What's New York's most-stolen street sign? |publisher=TODAY |date=September 27, 2010 |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=July 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After several years in development, Ramone's second posthumous album was released on May 22, 2012. Titled ''[[...Ya Know?]]'', it was preceded on [[Record Store Day]] by a 7" single re-release of "Blitzkrieg Bop"/"Havana Affair".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ramones.kauhajoki.fi/gigs/joeyramoneyaknow.html |title=Ramones: Joey Ramone'S Second Solo Album Titled ...Ya Know? |publisher=ramones.kauhajoki.fi/ramones.html |date= |accessdate=April 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opening track of U2's 2014 album ''[[Songs of Innocence (U2 album)|Songs of Innocence]]'' is called "[[The Miracle (of Joey Ramone)]]", paying tribute to the Ramones' influence on U2 from a show which the band members had attended in the late 1970s. Lead singer [[Bono]] claimed that Joey Ramone showed him how to sing.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

In the [[HBO]] television series ''[[Vinyl (TV series)|Vinyl]]'', James Vincent Boland appears as Joey Ramone - then using the pseudonym ''Jeff Starship'' - during his stint as lead singer of the pre-Ramones band [[Sniper (American band)|Sniper]].{{cn|date=August 2018}}

'''Kathleen Goligher''' (born 1898) was an Irish [[Spiritualism|spiritualist]] [[Mediumship|medium]]. Goligher was endorsed by engineer William Jackson Crawford who wrote three books about her mediumship but was exposed as a fraud by physicist [[Edmund Edward Fournier d'Albe]] in 1921.

==Investigations==

Goligher was born in [[Belfast]]. She held [[séance]]s in her own home with seven of her family members. The psychical researcher and engineer William Jackson Crawford (1881–1920) investigated the mediumship of Goligher and claimed she had [[levitate]]d the table and produced [[Ectoplasm (paranormal)|ectoplasm]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond Buckland|Buckland, Raymond]]. (2005). ''The Spirit Book: The Encyclopedia of Clairvoyance, Channeling, and Spirit Communication''. Visible Ink Press. p. 164. {{ISBN|978-1578592135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crawford in his books developed the "Cantilever Theory of Levitation" due to his experiments with Goligher. According to his theory the table was levitated by "[[psychic]] rods" of ectoplasm which came out of the body of the medium to operate as an invisible [[cantilever]]. Crawford took flashlight photographs of the ectoplasm, and described the substance as "plasma".

''Conan Doyle and the Spirits: The Spiritualist Career of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle''. Aquarian Press. p. 151. {{ISBN|978-0850308372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were no [[scientific control]]s in the Crawford's séances with Goligher as she and her family members had their hands and legs free at all times.&lt;ref&gt;Franklyn, Julian. (1935). ''A Survey of the Occult''. Kessinger Publishing. p. 233. {{ISBN|978-0766130074}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Crawford's death the physicist [[Edmund Edward Fournier d'Albe]] investigated the medium Goligher at twenty sittings and arrived at the opposite conclusion to Crawford. According to d'Albe no [[Ectoplasm (paranormal)|ectoplasm]] or levitation had occurred with Goligher and stated he had found evidence of fraud. On 22 July 1921 he observed Goligher holding the table with her foot.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. E. Bechhofer Roberts]]. (1932). ''The Truth About Spiritualism''. Kessinger Publishing. p. 128. {{ISBN|978-1417981281}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also discovered that the "ectoplasm" substance in the photographs of Crawford was [[muslin]]. During a séance d'Albe had observed white muslin between Goligher's feet.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edmund Edward Fournier d'Albe]]. (1922). ''The Goligher Circle''. J. M. Watkins. p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter to [[Harry Houdini]], d'Albe wrote "I must say I was greatly surprised at Crawford's blindness."&lt;ref name="Houdini"&gt;[[Harry Houdini|Houdini, Harry]]. (2011 edition, originally published 1924). ''A Magician Among the Spirits''. Cambridge University Press. p. 176. {{ISBN|978-1108027489}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conclusion from d'Albe was that the Goligher family were involved in the mediumship trickery and had duped Crawford. D'Albe published ''The Goligher Circle'' in 1922 which exposed the fraudulent mediumship of Goligher and because of the exposure she retired from mediumship in the same year.&lt;ref name="Roach 2010"/&gt;

==Critical evaluation==
[[File:Kathleen Goligher fake ectoplasm.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Goligher with [[muslin]]]]
Crawford's experiments were criticized by scientists for their inadequate controls and lack of precaution against fraud.&lt;ref name="Prince 1919"&gt;[[Morton Prince|Prince, Morton]]. (1919). ''Review of Experiments in Psychical Science, by W. J. Crawford.'' ''[[Journal of Abnormal Psychology]]'' 14: 355-361.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Jastrow|Jastrow, Joseph]]. (1920). ''A Psychic Tragedy: The Case of Professor Crawford.'' ''The Weekly Review'' 3: 412-415.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Physician [[Morton Prince]] in the ''[[Journal of Abnormal Psychology]]'' noted that Crawford's psychic rod hypothesis "fails to account for much and cannot be reconciled with what is scientifically known as matter, or force, or electricity, or energy."&lt;ref name="Prince 1919"/&gt; 

A review in the ''[[Journal of Applied Psychology]]'' suggested that Crawford does "not seem to have been able to avoid self-deception, and his experiments are not convincing."&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous. (1920). ''Experiments in Psychical Science''. ''[[Journal of Applied Psychology]]'' 4 (2-3): 280.&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychical researcher [[Hereward Carrington]] noted that the photographs taken by Crawford look "dubious in appearance" and that "with rare exceptions, no other investigators had an opportunity to check-up his results, since outsiders were rarely admitted to the sittings."&lt;ref&gt;[[Hereward Carrington|Carrington, Hereward]]. (2003). ''The Story of Psychic Science''. Kessinger Publishing. p. 197-200. {{ISBN|978-1161351118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The surgeon [[Charles Marsh Beadnell]] published a booklet in 1920 that debunked the experiments. He also offered a cash prize to any medium who could produce a single levitation under controlled conditions.&lt;ref name="Houdini"/&gt;

Bryan Donkin, M.D., studied the Crawford experiments called attention to "the superabundant exposure of the massive credulity and total defect of logical power displayed by Dr. Crawford," who gives "the most pathetic picture of a willing victim of pernicious deception".&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Jastrow|Jastrow, Joseph]]. (1935). ''Wish and Wisdom: Episodes in the Vagaries of Belief''. D. Appleton-Century Company. p. 377&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist [[Joseph Jastrow]] criticized the Crawford experiments as unscientific and wrote that "the minute detail of apparatus and all the paraphernalia of an engineering experiment which fills the Crawford books must ever remain an amazing document in the story of the metapsychic. As proof of what prepossession can do to a trained mind the case is invaluable."&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Murchison|Murchison, Cark]]. (1927).              [https://archive.org/stream/caseforandagains032328mbp#page/n333/mode/2up ''The Case For And Against Psychical Belief'']. Clark University p. 307&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph McCabe]] suggested that Goligher had used her feet and toes to levitate the table and move objects in the séance room and compared her fraudulent mediumship to [[Eusapia Palladino]] who performed similar tricks.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph McCabe|McCabe, Joseph]]. (1920). ''Is Spiritualism Based on Fraud? The Evidence Given By Sir A. C. Doyle and Others Drastically Examined''. London Watts &amp; Co. pp. 58–61&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Clodd]] also dismissed the experiments as fraudulent and noted that Goligher refused invitation to be examined by a group of magicians and scientists.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Clodd|Clodd, Edward]]. (1922). [https://archive.org/stream/occultismtwolect00cloduoft#page/28/mode/2up ''Occultism: Two Lectures Delivered in the Royal Institution on May 17 and 24, 1921'']. London: Watts &amp; Co. pp. 28–34&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers such as [[Ruth Brandon]] and [[Mary Roach]] have heavily criticized Crawford's investigation, describing him as credulous and having a sexual interest in Goligher, such as an obsession with her [[underwear]].&lt;ref name="Roach 2010"&gt;[[Mary Roach|Roach, Mary]]. (2010). ''[[Six Feet Over: Adventures in the Afterlife]]''. Canongate Books Ltd. pp. 110-116. {{ISBN|978-1847670809}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruth Brandon]]. (1983). ''The Spiritualists: The Passion for the Occult in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries''. Weidenfeld and Nicolson. pp. 150-151. {{ISBN|0-297-78249-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crawford held a deep fixation on underwear, for example psychical researcher [[Theodore Besterman]] noted that before his suicide he "spent all his money (consequently leaving nothing) on a stack of woollen underwear for his family, sufficient to last for several years."&lt;ref name= "Roach 2010"/&gt;

In 1988, [[Susan Blackmore]] claimed that she had communicated with Dingwall about the case. Blackmore stated that Crawford had confessed to Dingwall that all the Goligher phenomena was fraudulent. Blackmore quotes Crawford as saying "Ding, I have to tell you something. It was all faked, all of it."&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Blackmore|Blackmore, Susan]]. (1988). ''The Adventures of a Parapsychologist''. Prometheus Books. p. 211. {{ISBN|1-57392-061-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter he gave to his lawyers for public release, Adnan explained why he was on hunger strike:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Israeli occupation has gone to extremes against our people, especially prisoners. I have been humiliated, beaten, and harassed by interrogators for no reason, and thus I swore to God I would fight the policy of administrative detention to which I and hundreds of my fellow prisoners fell prey … The only thing I can do is offer my soul to God, as I believe righteousness and justice will eventually triumph over tyranny and oppression. I hereby assert that I am confronting the occupiers not for my own sake as an individual, but for the sake of thousands of prisoners who are being deprived of their simplest human rights while the world and international community look on.

In spite of the agreement to end his first hunger strike (see above), Adnan was arrested again on July 8, 2014, at the beginning of the [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict]], and has been held in detention ever since, beginning his second hunger strike on May 5, 2015.&lt;ref name="MEE1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TOI1" /&gt; The government of Israel is seemingly determined to break Adnan's hunger strike using force feeding techniques similar to those used by the USA in its Guantanamo Bay prison camp.&lt;ref name="TOI1" /&gt; Israeli Minister of Public Security Gilad Erdan was quoted as saying "Security prisoners are interested in turning hunger strikes into a new kind of suicide attack that would threaten the State of Israel. We cannot allow anyone to threaten us and we will not allow prisoners to die in our prisons."&lt;ref name="TOI1" /&gt; However, the Israeli Medical Society and various human rights groups are deploring this planned course of action by Israel, with the Medical Society issuing orders to Israeli doctors to not participate in any planned forced feedings except under certain limited circumstances not applicable to Adnan at this point in time.&lt;ref name="TOI1" /&gt;

== Reactions ==

Adnan's hunger strike has drawn critical scrutiny of Israel's practice of administrative detention by a number of human rights groups, international bodies and Palestinian leaders and protesters.

After establishing a career as a writer of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] stories, in 1950 he published a "branch of self-help psychology" called [[Dianetics]]. Hubbard subsequently developed his ideas into a [[new religious movement]] that he called [[Scientology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/new-religious-movement|title=new religious movement (NRM)|publisher=|accessdate=July 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/l-ron-hubbard-publishes-dianetics&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard was cited by ''[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]'' magazine as one of the 100 most significant Americans of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonianmag/meet-100-most-significant-americans-all-time-180953341/?no-ist |title=Meet the 100 Most Significant Americans of All Time |last=Frail |first=T.A. |accessdate=November 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Tilden, Nebraska]] in 1911, Hubbard spent much of his childhood in [[Helena, Montana]]. After his father was posted to the U.S. naval base on [[Guam]], Hubbard traveled to Asia and the South Pacific in the late 1920s. In 1930, Hubbard enrolled at [[George Washington University]] to study civil engineering, but dropped out in his second year. He began his career as a prolific writer of pulp fiction stories and married [[Margaret Grubb|Margaret "Polly" Grubb]], who shared his interest in aviation.

Hubbard served briefly in the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] [[Military reserve|Reserve]] and was an officer in the Navy during World War II. He briefly commanded two ships, but was removed from command both times.&lt;ref name="LATimes-1990-06-24"&gt;{{cite news|author=Sappel, Joel |author2=Welkos, Robert W. |title=The Mind Behind the Religion, Chapter 2: Creating the Mystique: Hubbard's Image Was Crafted of Truth, Distorted by Myth |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-scientology062490,0,2050131,full.story |work=Los Angeles Times |date=June 24, 1990 |accessdate=July 14, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612145705/http://www.latimes.com/business/la-scientology062490%2C0%2C2050131%2Cfull.story |archivedate=June 12, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The last few months of his active service were spent in a hospital, being treated for a [[Peptic ulcer|duodenal ulcer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-scientology062490%2C0%2C2050131%2Cfull.story |title=The Mind Behind the Religon(sic) - Los Angeles Times |date=June 12, 2008 |publisher= |accessdate=July 25, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612145705/http://www.latimes.com/business/la-scientology062490%2C0%2C2050131%2Cfull.story |archivedate=June 12, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Hubbard moved into the [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] mansion of occultist and engineer [[Jack Parsons (rocket engineer)|Jack Parsons]].&lt;ref name="Miller-113"&gt;Miller, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1946, Hubbard and Parsons collaborated on [[Babalon Working]], a series of magic ceremonies or rituals. Hubbard became sexually involved with Parsons's 21-year-old girlfriend, [[Sara Northrup Hollister|Sara "Betty" Northrup]], ultimately marrying her despite Hubbard still being married to first wife Polly.&lt;ref name="Miller-117"&gt;Miller, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, Hubbard authored [[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]] and established a series of organizations to promote Dianetics.  In 1952, Hubbard lost the rights to Dianetics in bankruptcy proceedings, and he subsequently founded Scientology. Thereafter Hubbard oversaw the growth of the Church of Scientology into a worldwide organization.

During the late 1960s and early 1970s, he spent much of his time at sea on his personal fleet of ships as "[[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]]" of the [[Sea Organization]], an elite, paramilitary group of Scientologists.&lt;ref name="Cooper, 2 December 2005"&gt;Stark and Bainbridge 1996, p. 213.

Hubbard returned to the United States in 1975 and went into seclusion in the [[California]] desert.  In 1978, a trial court in France convicted Hubbard of fraud [[trial in absentia|''in absentia'']].

The Church of Scientology describes Hubbard in [[hagiography|hagiographic]] terms,&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; and he portrayed himself as a pioneering [[explorer]], world traveler, and [[nuclear physicist]] with expertise in a wide range of disciplines, including photography, art, poetry, and [[philosophy]]. Though many of Hubbard's autobiographical statements have been found to be fictitious,&lt;ref name="urban2006"&gt;Urban, Hugh B. "Fair Game: Secrecy, Security, and the Church of Scientology in Cold War America." ''[[Journal of the American Academy of Religion]]'' '''74''':2 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; the Church rejects any suggestion that its account of Hubbard's life is not historical fact.&lt;ref name="Rothstein-21"&gt;Rothstein, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wright" /&gt; In Scientology publications, he is referred to as "Founder" and "Source" of Scientology and Dianetics.

His critics, including son [[Ronald DeWolf]], have characterized Hubbard as a mentally-unstable chronic liar.

After Hubbard's father Harry rejoined the Navy, his posting aboard the [[USS Oklahoma (BB-37)|USS ''Oklahoma'']] in 1921 required the family to relocate to the ship's home ports, first [[San Diego]], then [[Seattle]].&lt;ref name="Miller-23"&gt;Miller, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard was active in the [[Boy Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Boy Scouts]] in Washington, D.C. and earned the rank of [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] in 1924, two weeks after his 13th birthday.

The following year, Harry Ross Hubbard was posted to [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility|Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]] at [[Bremerton, Washington]].&lt;ref name="Miller-27"&gt;Miller, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; His son was enrolled at Union High School, Bremerton,&lt;ref name="Miller-27" /&gt; and later studied at [[Queen Anne High School (Seattle, Washington)|Queen Anne High School]] in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]].&lt;ref name="Miller-28"&gt;Miller, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927 Hubbard's father was sent to the U.S. Naval Station on [[Guam]]. Although Hubbard's mother accompanied her husband, while their child was placed in his grandparents' care in Helena, Montana to complete his schooling.&lt;ref name="Miller-28" /&gt;

In 1927, Hubbard and his mother traveled to Guam. It consisted of a brief stop-over in a couple of Chinese ports before traveling on to Guam, where he stayed for six weeks before returning home. He recorded his impressions of the places he visited and disdained the poverty of the inhabitants of Japan and China, whom he described as "[[gook]]s" and "lazy [and] ignorant".&lt;ref name="Atack-54"&gt;Atack, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller-31"&gt;Miller, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first1=James R.|title=Scientology |location=USA |publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his return to the United States in September 1927, Hubbard enrolled at [[Helena High School]], where he contributed to the school paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of New Religious Movements|last=Clarke|first=Peter, Ed.|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=9781134499700|location=|pages=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; but earned only poor grades.&lt;ref name="Miller-34"&gt;Miller, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; He abandoned school the following May and went back west to stay with his aunt and uncle in Seattle. He joined his parents in Guam in June 1928. His mother took over his education in the hope of putting him forward for the entrance examination to the [[United States Naval Academy]] at [[Annapolis, Maryland]].

Between October and December 1928 a number of naval families, including Hubbard's, traveled from Guam to China aboard the [[cargo ship]] {{USS|Gold Star|AK-12|6}}. The ship stopped at [[Manila]] in the Philippines before traveling on to [[Qingdao]] (Tsingtao) in China. Hubbard and his parents made a side trip to [[Beijing]] before sailing on to [[Shanghai]] and [[Hong Kong]], from where they returned to Guam.&lt;ref name="Miller-41"&gt;Miller, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Back on Guam, Hubbard spent much of his time writing dozens of short stories and essays&lt;ref name="Miller-44"&gt;Miller, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; and failed the Naval Academy entrance examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religio.de/books/wakefield/us-02.html|title=Understanding Scientology / Chapter 2: L. Ron Hubbard -- Messiah? Or Madman?|publisher=|accessdate=July 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1929 Hubbard was enrolled at the Swavely Preparatory School in [[Manassas, Virginia]], to prepare him for a second attempt at the examination.&lt;ref name="Miller-45"&gt;Miller, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was ruled out of consideration due to his near-sightedness.&lt;ref name="Miller-46"&gt;Miller, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; He was instead sent to Woodward School for Boys in Washington, D.C. to qualify for admission to [[George Washington University]]. He successfully graduated from the school in June 1930 and entered the university the following September.&lt;ref name="Miller-47"&gt;Miller, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

==University and explorations==
[[File:Professor's Gate - GWU.JPG|right|thumb|alt=Open gateway with the letters G and W and the phrase "Professors Gate" visible on the arch|Professor's Gate at George Washington University]]
Hubbard studied [[civil engineering]] during his two years at George Washington University at the behest of his father, who "decreed that I should study engineering and mathematics".&lt;ref name="Atack-59"&gt;Atack, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

During Hubbard's final semester he organized an expedition to the Caribbean for "fifty young gentleman rovers" aboard the [[schooner]] ''Doris Hamlin'' commencing in June 1932. The aims of the "Caribbean Motion Picture Expedition" were stated as being to explore and film the pirate "strongholds and bivouacs of the [[Spanish Main]]" and to "collect whatever one collects for exhibits in museums".&lt;ref name="Miller=52"&gt;Miller, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; It ran into trouble even before it left the port of Baltimore: Ten participants quit and storms blew the ship far off course to [[Bermuda]]. Eleven more members of the expedition quit there and more left when the ship arrived at [[Martinique]].&lt;ref name="Miller=54"&gt;Miller, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; With the expedition running critically short of money, the ship's owners ordered it to return to Baltimore.&lt;ref name="Miller=55"&gt;Miller, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard blamed the expedition's problems on the captain: "the ship's dour Captain Garfield proved himself far less than a Captain Courageous, requiring Ron Hubbard's hand at both the helm and the charts."&lt;ref name="CMPE"&gt;[http://www.lronhubbard.org/biography/adventures-explorations/carribean-motion-picture-expedition.html L. Ron Hubbard Biographical Profile&amp;nbsp;— Caribbean Motion Picture Expedition]." Church of Scientology International, 2010, retrieved February 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Specimens and photographs collected by the expedition are said by Scientology accounts to have been acquired by the [[University of Michigan]], the [[Naval Oceanographic Office|U.S. Hydrographic Office]], an unspecified national museum and ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref name="CMPE" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mission"&gt;Hubbard, L.

Ron, "The Camp-Fire," ''Adventure'' magazine, vol. 93 no. 5, October 1, 1935.

''Look'' magazine, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted in some of its participants making legal claims against him for refunds.&lt;ref name="Atack-63"&gt;Atack, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard traveled to Puerto Rico in November 1932 after his father volunteered him for the [[American Red Cross|Red Cross]] relief effort following the devastating [[1932 San Ciprian hurricane]].&lt;ref name="Miller=56" /&gt; In a 1957 lecture Hubbard said that he had been "a field executive with the [[American Red Cross]] in the Puerto Rico hurricane disaster".&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, L. Ron. "Creating a Third Dynamic / United Survival Action Clubs," lecture of December 30, 1957. Ability Congress, 5th lecture.&lt;/ref&gt; According to his own account, Hubbard spent much of his time [[gold prospecting|prospecting]] unsuccessfully for gold. Towards the end of his stay on Puerto Rico he appears to have done some work for a Washington, D.C. firm called West Indies Minerals Incorporated, accompanying a surveyor in an investigation of a small property near the town of [[Luquillo, Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref name="Atack-63"/&gt; The survey was unsuccessful. A few years later, Hubbard wrote:

{{quote|Harboring the thought that the Conquistadores might have left some gold behind, I determined to find it&amp;nbsp;... Gold prospecting in the wake of the Conquistadores, on the hunting grounds of the pirates in the islands which still reek of Columbus is romantic, and I do not begrudge the sweat which splashed in muddy rivers, and the bits of khaki which have probably blown away from the thorn bushes long ago&amp;nbsp;...

After a half year or more of intensive search, after wearing my palms thin wielding a sample pack, after assaying a few hundred sacks of ore, I came back, a failure.&lt;ref name="Adventure" /&gt;}}

Hubbard became a well-known and prolific writer for [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction magazines]] during the 1930s. Scientology texts describe him as becoming "well established as an essayist" even before he had concluded college. Scientology claims he "solved his finances, and his desire to travel by writing anything that came to hand"&lt;ref name="Brief Biography" /&gt; and to have earned an "astronomical" rate of pay for the times.&lt;ref&gt;''L. Ron Hubbard, the writer''. Los Angeles, CA : Bridge Publications, 1989. (No page number in original.)&lt;/ref&gt;

His literary career began with contributions to the George Washington University student newspaper, ''The University Hatchet'', as a reporter for a few months in 1931.&lt;ref name="Miller-47" /&gt; Six of his pieces were published commercially during 1932 to 1933.&lt;ref name="Atack-64" /&gt; The going rate for freelance writers at the time was only a cent a word, so Hubbard's total earnings from these articles would have been less than $100 ({{Inflation|US|100|1933|fmt=eq|cursign=[[$]]}}).&lt;ref name="Miller-63"&gt;Miller, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; The pulp magazine ''Thrilling Adventure'' became the first to publish one of his short stories, in February 1934.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.galaxypress.com/l-ron-hubbard About L.

Although he was best known for his [[fantasy]] and [[science fiction]] stories, Hubbard wrote in a wide variety of genres, including adventure fiction, aviation, travel, mysteries, westerns and even romance.&lt;ref name="Frenschkowski"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frenschkowski|first1=Marco|title=L.

Hubbard's literary earnings helped him to support his new wife, [[Margaret Grubb|Margaret "Polly" Grubb]]. She was already pregnant when they married on April 13, 1933, but had a [[miscarriage]] shortly afterwards; a few months later, she became pregnant again.&lt;ref name="Miller-61"&gt;Miller, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; On May 7, 1934, she gave birth prematurely to a son who was named [[Ronald DeWolf|Lafayette Ronald Hubbard, Jr.]] and the nickname "His Nibs", invariably shortened to "Nibs".&lt;ref name="Miller-64"&gt;Miller, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; Their second child, Katherine May, was born on January 15, 1936.&lt;ref name="Miller-70"&gt;Miller, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; The Hubbards lived for a while in [[Laytonsville, Maryland]], but were chronically short of money.&lt;ref name="Miller-62"&gt;Miller, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1936 they moved to [[Bremerton, Washington]]. They lived there for a time with Hubbard's aunts and grandmother before finding a place of their own at nearby [[South Colby, Washington|South Colby]]. According to one of his friends at the time, [[Robert MacDonald Ford]], the Hubbards were "in fairly dire straits for money" but sustained themselves on the income from Hubbard's writing.&lt;ref name="Miller-74"&gt;Miller, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard spent an increasing amount of time in [[New York City]],&lt;ref name="Miller-71"&gt;Miller, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; working out of a hotel room where his wife suspected him of carrying on affairs with other women.&lt;ref name="Miller-75"&gt;Miller, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller-84"&gt;Miller, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

===Near-death experience and ''Excalibur''===
{{main|Excalibur (L. Ron Hubbard)}}
Hubbard's authorship in mid-1938 of a still-unpublished manuscript called ''[[Excalibur (L. Ron Hubbard)|Excalibur]]'' is highlighted by the Church of Scientology as a key step in developing the principles of Scientology and Dianetics. The manuscript is said by Scientologists to have outlined "the basic principles of human existence"&lt;ref name="Brief Biography" /&gt; and to have been the culmination of twenty years of research into "twenty-one races and cultures including Pacific Northwest Indian tribes, Philippine Tagalogs and, as he was wont to joke, the people of the Bronx".&lt;ref name="Founder"&gt;"[http://www.lronhubbard.org/biography/founder.html L. Ron Hubbard Biographical Profile&amp;nbsp;— Founder]." Church of Scientology International, 2010, retrieved February 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Arthur J. Cox, a contributor to John W. Campbell's ''Astounding Science Fiction'' magazine, Hubbard told a 1948 convention of science fiction fans that ''Excalibur''{{'s}} inspiration came during an operation in which he "died" for eight minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; (Gerry Armstrong, Hubbard's archivist, explains this as a [[dental extraction]] performed under [[nitrous oxide]], a chemical known for its hallucinogenic effects&lt;ref name="Atack-66"&gt;Atack, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;):

{{quote|Hubbard realized that, while he was dead, he had received a tremendous inspiration, a great Message which he must impart to others. He sat at his typewriter for six days and nights and nothing came out. Then, ''Excalibur'' emerged.&lt;ref name="Malko=40"&gt;Malko, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Arthur J. Burks]], the President of the American Fiction Guild, wrote that an excited Hubbard called him and said: "I want to see you right away. I have written THE book." Hubbard believed that ''Excalibur'' would "revolutionize everything" and that "it was somewhat more important, and would have a greater impact upon people, than the [[Bible]]."&lt;ref name="Burks"&gt;Burks, Arthur J (December 1961). "Excalibur." ''The Aberree''.&lt;/ref&gt; It proposed that all human behavior could be explained in terms of survival and that to understand survival was to understand life.&lt;ref name="Miller-80"&gt;Miller, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; As Hubbard biographer Jon Atack notes, "the notion that everything that exists is trying to survive became the basis of Dianetics and Scientology."&lt;ref name="Atack-66" /&gt;

According to Burks, Hubbard "was so sure he had something 'away out and beyond' anything else that he had sent telegrams to several book publishers, telling them that he had written 'THE book' and that they were to meet him at [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]], and he would discuss it with them and go with whomever gave him the best offer." However, nobody bought the manuscript.&lt;ref name="Burks" /&gt; [[Forrest J Ackerman]]&lt;!-- N.B. NO PERIOD AFTER THE J --&gt;, later Hubbard's [[literary agent]], recalled that Hubbard told him "whoever read it either went insane or committed suicide. And he said that the last time he had shown it to a publisher in New York, he walked into the office to find out what the reaction was, the publisher called for the reader, the reader came in with the manuscript, threw it on the table and threw himself out of the skyscraper window."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhl2bE-1LiA&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=8m29s Ackerman, Forrest J (November 19, 1997) ''Secret Lives: L. Ron Hubbard''], Channel 4 Television.&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard's failure to sell ''Excalibur'' depressed him; he told his wife in an October 1938 letter: "Writing action pulp doesn't have much agreement with what I want to do because it retards my progress by demanding incessant attention and, further, actually weakens my name. So you see I've got to do something about it and at the same time strengthen the old financial position."&lt;ref name="Letter-1938"&gt;Letter from L. Ron Hubbard, October 1938, quoted in Miller, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; He went on:

{{quote|Sooner or later ''Excalibur'' will be published and I may have a chance to get some name recognition out of it so as to pave the way to articles and comments which are my ideas of writing heaven&amp;nbsp;... Foolishly perhaps, but determined none the less, I have high hopes of smashing my name into history so violently that it will take a legendary form even if all books are destroyed. That goal is the real goal as far as I am concerned.&lt;ref name="Letter-1938" /&gt;}}

The manuscript later became part of Scientology mythology.&lt;ref name="Atack-66" /&gt; An early 1950s Scientology publication offered signed "gold-bound and locked" copies for the sum of $1,500 apiece ({{Inflation|US|1500|1950|fmt=eq|cursign=[[$]]}}). It warned that "four of the first fifteen people who read it went insane" and that it would be "[r]eleased only on sworn statement not to permit other readers to read it. Contains data not to be released during Mr. Hubbard's stay on earth."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Malko, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alaska expedition===
[[File:Ketchikan AK.jpg|thumb|alt=Buildings visible at a shoreline with forest above|Ketchikan, Alaska, where Hubbard and his wife were stranded during the "Alaskan Radio-Experimental Expedition"]]
Hubbard joined [[The Explorers Club]] in February 1940 on the strength of his claimed explorations in the Caribbean and survey flights in the United States.&lt;ref name="Miller-85"&gt;Miller, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; He persuaded the club to let him carry its flag on an "Alaskan Radio-Experimental Expedition" to update the U.S. Coast Pilot guide to the coastlines of [[Alaska]] and [[British Columbia]] and investigate new methods of radio position-finding.&lt;ref name="Miller-88"&gt;Miller, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition consisted of Hubbard and his wife—the children were left at South Colby—aboard his [[ketch]] ''Magician''.&lt;ref name="Miller-89"&gt;Miller, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard told ''[[The Seattle Star]]'' in a November 1940 letter that the expedition was plagued by problems and did not get any further than [[Ketchikan, Alaska|Ketchikan]] near the southern end of the [[Alaska Panhandle]], far from the Aleutian Islands.&lt;ref name="Atack-68"&gt;Atack, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; ''Magician's'' engine broke down only two days after setting off in July 1940. The Hubbards reached Ketchikan on August 30, 1940, after many delays following repeated engine breakdowns. The ''Ketchikan Chronicle'' reported—making no mention of the expedition—that Hubbard's purpose in coming to Alaska "was two-fold, one to win a bet and another to gather material for a novel of Alaskan salmon fishing".&lt;ref name="Miller-89" /&gt; Having underestimated the cost of the trip, he did not have enough money to repair the broken engine. He raised money by writing stories and contributing to the local radio station&lt;ref name="Miller-91"&gt;Miller, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually earned enough to fix the engine,&lt;ref name="Miller-85" /&gt; making it back to Puget Sound on December 27, 1940.&lt;ref name="Miller-91" /&gt;

==Military career==
{{Main|Military career of L. Ron Hubbard}}
[[File:Hubbard and moulton.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Two men in naval uniform|{{abbr|Lts|Lieutenants}} ({{abbr|jg|junior grade}}) L. Ron Hubbard and Thomas S. Moulton in Portland, Oregon in 1943]]
After returning from Alaska, Hubbard applied to join the United States Navy. His Congressman, [[Warren G. Magnuson]], wrote to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] to recommend Hubbard as "a gentleman of reputation" who was "a respected explorer" and had "marine masters papers for more types of vessels than any other man in the United States". Hubbard was described as "a key figure" in writing organizations, "making him politically potent nationally". The Congressman concluded: "Anything you can do for Mr Hubbard will be appreciated." His friend Robert MacDonald Ford, by now a State Representative for Washington, sent a letter of recommendation describing Hubbard as "one of the most brilliant men I have ever known". It called Hubbard "a powerful influence" in the Northwest and said that he was "well known in many parts of the world and has considerable influence in the Caribbean and Alaska". The letter declared that "for courage and ability I cannot too strongly recommend him." Ford later said that Hubbard had written the letter himself: "I don't know why Ron wanted a letter. I just gave him a letter-head and said, 'Hell, you're the writer, you write it!'"&lt;ref name="Miller-93"&gt;Miller, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard was commissioned as a [[Lieutenant (junior grade)]] in the [[U.S. Naval Reserve]] on July 19, 1941.

Most of his military service was spent ashore in the [[continental United States]] on administrative or training duties. He served for a short time in Australia but was sent home after quarreling with his superiors. He briefly commanded two [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine vessels]], the [[USS YP-422|USS ''YP-422'']] and [[USS PC-815|USS ''PC-815'']], in coastal waters off [[Massachusetts]], [[Oregon]] and [[California]] in 1942 and 1943 respectively.&lt;ref name="SW-Creating" /&gt;

After Hubbard reported that the ''PC-815'' had attacked and crippled or sunk two [[Imperial Japanese Navy submarines|Japanese submarines]] off Oregon in May 1943, his claim was rejected by the commander of the [[Northwest Sea Frontier]].&lt;ref name="SW-Creating" /&gt; Hubbard and Thomas Moulton, his second in command on the ''PC-815'', later said the Navy wanted to avoid panic on the mainland.&lt;ref&gt;Streeter, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; A month later Hubbard unwittingly sailed the ''PC-815'' into Mexican territorial waters and conducted gunnery practice off the [[Coronado Islands]], in the belief that they were uninhabited and belonged to the United States. The Mexican government complained and Hubbard was relieved of command. A fitness report written after the incident rated Hubbard as unsuitable for independent duties and "lacking in the essential qualities of judgment, leadership and cooperation".&lt;ref name="Miller-107"&gt;Miller, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; He served for a while as the Navigation and Training Officer for the [[USS Algol (AKA-54)|USS ''Algol'']] while it was based at Portland. A fitness report from this period recommended promotion, describing him as "a capable and energetic officer, [but] very temperamental", and an "above average navigator".&lt;ref&gt;Atack, p. 81; Streeter, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; However, he never held another such position and did not serve aboard another ship after the ''Algol''.

[[File:Uss pc-815 1.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Naval ship moving forward in water|The USS ''PC-815'', Hubbard's second and final command]]

His medical records state that he was hospitalized with an acute [[duodenal ulcer]] rather than a war injury.&lt;ref name="SW-Creating" /&gt; He told his doctors that he was suffering from lameness caused by a hip infection&lt;ref name="SW-Creating" /&gt; and he told ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' magazine in December 1950 that he had suffered from "ulcers, conjunctivitis, deteriorating eyesight, bursitis and something wrong with my feet".&lt;ref name="Maisel" /&gt; He was still complaining in 1951 of eye problems and stomach pains, which had given him "continuous trouble" for eight years, especially when "under nervous stress". This came well after Hubbard had promised that Dianetics would provide "a cure for the very ailments that plagued the author himself then and throughout his life, including allergies, arthritis, ulcers and heart problems".&lt;ref name="SW-Creating" /&gt;

An October 1945 Naval Board found that Hubbard was "considered physically qualified to perform duty ashore, preferably within the continental United States".&lt;ref name="Atack-84"&gt;Atack, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; He was discharged from hospital on December 4, 1945, and transferred to inactive duty on February 17, 1946. He resigned his commission with effect from October 30, 1950.&lt;ref name="sppulitzer" /&gt;

Hubbard's life underwent a turbulent period immediately after the war. According to his own account, he "was abandoned by family and friends as a supposedly hopeless cripple and a probable burden upon them for the rest of my days".&lt;ref name="My Philosophy"&gt;Hubbard, L. Ron. "[http://www.ronthephilosopher.org/phlspher/page84.htm My Philosophy]," Church of Scientology International, 1965, retrieved February 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter Katherine presented a rather different version: his wife had refused to uproot their children from their home in Bremerton, Washington, to join him in California. Their marriage was by now in terminal difficulties and he chose to stay in California.&lt;ref name="Miller-116"&gt;Miller, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1945 Hubbard moved into the [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] mansion of [[Jack Parsons (rocket engineer)|John "Jack" Whiteside Parsons]]. A leading [[rocket propulsion]] researcher at the [[California Institute of Technology]] and a founder of the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], Parsons led a double life as an avid [[occultism|occultist]] and [[Thelema|Thelemite]], follower of the English ceremonial magician [[Aleister Crowley]] and leader of a lodge of Crowley's [[magical order]], [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] (OTO).&lt;ref name="Wright" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller-113"&gt;Miller, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; He let rooms in the house only to tenants who he specified should be "atheists and those of a Bohemian disposition".&lt;ref name="Miller-114"&gt;Miller, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard befriended Parsons and soon became sexually involved with Parsons's 21-year-old girlfriend, [[Sara Northrup Hollister|Sara "Betty" Northrup]].&lt;ref name="Miller-117"&gt;Miller, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this Parsons was very impressed with Hubbard and reported to Crowley:

{{quote|[Hubbard] is a gentleman; he has red hair, green eyes, is honest and intelligent, and we have become great friends. He moved in with me about two months ago, and although Betty and I are still friendly, she has transferred her sexual affection to Ron. Although he has no formal training in Magick, he has an extraordinary amount of experience and understanding in the field. From some of his experiences I deduced that he is in direct touch with some higher intelligence, possibly his [[Holy Guardian Angel|Guardian Angel]]. He describes his Angel as a beautiful winged woman with red hair whom he calls the Empress and who has guided him through his life and saved him many times. He is the most [[Thelema|Thelemic]] person I have ever met and is in complete accord with our own principles.&lt;ref name="Symonds"&gt;Quoted in Symonds, John. ''The Great Beast: the life and magick of Aleister Crowley'', p. 392. London: Macdonald and Co., 1971. {{ISBN|0-356-03631-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hubbard, whom Parsons referred to in writing as "Frater H",&lt;ref name="Martin1989"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stoddard Martin|title=Orthodox Heresy: The Rise of 'magic' As Religion and Its Relation to Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SPcbAAAAMAAJ|year=1989|publisher=Macmillan Press|isbn=978-0-333-43540-3|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; became an enthusiastic collaborator in the Pasadena OTO. The two men collaborated on the "[[Babalon Working]]", a [[sex magic]] ritual intended to summon an incarnation of [[Babalon]], the supreme Thelemite Goddess. It was undertaken over several nights in February and March 1946 in order to summon an "elemental" who would participate in further sex magic.&lt;ref name="Urban"&gt;Urban, Hugh B. ''Magia sexualis: sex, magic, and liberation in modern Western esotericism'', p. 137. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-520-24776-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Richard Metzger]] describes it,

{{quote|Parsons used his "magical wand" to whip up a vortex of energy so the elemental would be summoned. Translated into plain English, Parsons [[masturbation|jerked off]] in the name of spiritual advancement whilst Hubbard (referred to as "The Scribe" in the diary of the event) scanned the astral plane for signs and visions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Metzger|Metzger, Richard]]. ''Book of Lies: The Disinformation Guide to Magick and the Occult'', p. 200. New York: [[The Disinformation Company]], 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-9713942-7-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The "elemental" arrived a few days later in the form of [[Marjorie Cameron]], who agreed to participate in Parsons' rites.&lt;ref name="Urban" /&gt; Soon afterwards, Parsons, Hubbard and Sara agreed to set up a business partnership, "Allied Enterprises", in which they invested nearly their entire savings—the vast majority contributed by Parsons. The plan was for Hubbard and Sara to buy yachts in [[Miami]] and sail them to the West Coast to sell for a profit. Hubbard had a different idea; he wrote to the U.S. Navy requesting permission to leave the country "to visit Central &amp; South America &amp; China" for the purposes of "collecting writing material"—in other words, undertaking a world cruise.&lt;ref name="Pendle-268"&gt;Pendle, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; Aleister Crowley strongly criticized Parsons's actions, writing: "Suspect Ron playing confidence trick—Jack Parsons weak fool—obvious victim prowling swindlers." Parsons attempted to recover his money by obtaining an injunction to prevent Hubbard and Sara leaving the country or disposing of the remnants of his assets.&lt;ref name="Pendle-269"&gt;Pendle, p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; They attempted to sail anyway but were forced back to port by a storm. A week later, Allied Enterprises was dissolved. Parsons received only a $2,900 promissory note from Hubbard and returned home "shattered". He had to sell his mansion to developers soon afterwards to recoup his losses.&lt;ref name="Pendle-270"&gt;Pendle, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:L Ron and Sara Hubbard June 1946.jpg|right|thumb|Hubbard and second wife Sara]]
Hubbard's fellow writers were well aware of what had happened between him and Parsons. [[L. Sprague de Camp]] wrote to [[Isaac Asimov]] on August 27, 1946, to tell him:

{{quote|The more complete story of Hubbard is that he is now in Fla. living on his yacht with a man-eating tigress named Betty-alias-Sarah, another of the same kind&amp;nbsp;... He will probably soon thereafter arrive in these parts with Betty-Sarah, broke, working the poor-wounded-veteran racket for all its worth, and looking for another easy mark. Don't say you haven't been warned. Bob &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Robert Heinlein]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; thinks Ron went to pieces morally as a result of the war. I think that's fertilizer, that he always was that way, but when he wanted to conciliate or get something from somebody he could put on a good charm act. What the war did was to wear him down to where he no longer bothers with the act.&lt;ref name="Pendle-271"&gt;De Camp, L. Sprague, letter of August 26, 1946. Quoted by Pendle, p. 271&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On August 10, 1946, Hubbard [[bigamy|bigamously]] married Sara, while still married to Polly. It was not until 1947 that his first wife learned that he had remarried. Hubbard agreed to divorce Polly in June that year and the marriage was dissolved shortly afterwards, with Polly given custody of the children.&lt;ref name="Miller-134"&gt;Miller, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, Hubbard authored a document called The "[[Affirmations (L. Ron Hubbard)|Affirmations]]" (also referred to as the "Admissions"). They consist of a series of statements by and addressed to Hubbard, relating to various physical, sexual, psychological and social issues that he was encountering in his life. The Affirmations appear to have been intended to be used as a form of self-hypnosis with the intention of resolving the author's psychological problems and instilling a positive mental attitude. In  [[Inside Scientology: The Story of America's Most Secretive Religion|her book]], Reitman called the Affirmations "the most revealing psychological self-assessment, complete with exhortations to himself, that [Hubbard] had ever made."&lt;ref name="Reitman20"&gt;Reitman, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;
Among the Affirmations:
* "Your eyes are getting progressively better. They became bad when you used them as an excuse to escape the naval academy. You have no reason to keep them bad."
* "Your stomach trouble you used as an excuse to keep the Navy from punishing you. You are free of the Navy."
* "Your hip is a pose. You have a sound hip. It never hurts. Your shoulder never hurts."
* "Your foot was an alibi. The injury is no longer needed."&lt;ref name="Wright53"&gt;Wright, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;
* "You can tell all the romantic tales you wish. ... But you know which ones were lies ... You have enough real experience to make anecdotes forever. Stick to your true adventures."
* "Masturbation does not injure or make insane. Your parents were in error. Everyone masturbates."&lt;ref name="Wright53-4"&gt;Wright, p. 53-4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of ''Dianetics''==
[[File:MastersOfSleep.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Illustrated cover of Fantastic Adventures magazine, depicting two figures hiding behind an enormous crystal as a giant leers over them|''Masters of Sleep'', one of Hubbard's last works of pulp fiction, on the cover of the October 1950 issue of ''[[Fantastic Adventures]]'']]
After Hubbard's wedding to Sara, the couple settled at [[Laguna Beach, California]], where Hubbard took a short-term job looking after a friend's yacht&lt;ref name="Miller-132"&gt;Miller, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; before resuming his fiction writing to supplement the small disability allowance that he was receiving as a war veteran.&lt;ref name="Streeter-210"&gt;Streeter, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; Working from a trailer in a run-down area of [[North Hollywood]],&lt;ref name="Miller-134" /&gt; Hubbard sold a number of science fiction stories that included his ''[[Ole Doc Methuselah]]'' series and the serialized novels ''The End Is Not Yet'' and ''[[To the Stars (novel)|To the Stars]]''.&lt;ref name="Stableford" /&gt; However, he remained short of money and his son, L. Ron Hubbard Jr, testified later that Hubbard was dependent on his own father and Margaret's parents for money and his writings, which he was paid at a penny per word, never garnered him any more than $10,000 prior to the founding of Scientology.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|elFdBCldOz4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He repeatedly wrote to the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] (VA) asking for an increase in his war pension. In October 1947 he wrote:

{{quote|After trying and failing for two years to regain my equilibrium in civil life, I am utterly unable to approach anything like my own competence. My last physician informed me that it might be very helpful if I were to be examined and perhaps treated psychiatrically or even by a psychoanalyst. Toward the end of my service I avoided out of pride any mental examinations, hoping that time would balance a mind which I had every reason to suppose was seriously affected. I cannot account for nor rise above long periods of moroseness and suicidal inclinations, and have newly come to realize that I must first triumph above this before I can hope to rehabilitate myself at all.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, L. Ron, letter to Veterans Administration, October 15, 1947; quoted in Miller, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The VA eventually did increase his pension,&lt;ref name="Miller-139"&gt;Miller, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; but his money problems continued. On August 31, 1948, he was arrested in [[San Luis Obispo, California]], and subsequently pleaded guilty to a charge of petty theft, for which he was ordered to pay a $25 fine ({{Inflation|US|25|1948|fmt=eq}}).&lt;ref name="Miller-142"&gt;Miller, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Church of Scientology, around this time he "accept[ed] an appointment as a Special Police Officer with the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] and us[ed] the position to study society's criminal elements"&lt;ref name="Chronicle1930-1940" /&gt; and also "worked with neurotics from the Hollywood film community".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://dianetics.lronhubbard.org/page12.htm Letters from the Birth of Dianetics]." Church of Scientology International, 2004, retrieved February 8, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1948 Hubbard and Sara moved to [[Savannah, Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; Here, Scientology sources say, he "volunteer[ed] his time in hospitals and mental wards, saving the lives of patients with his counseling techniques".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://mediaresources.lronhubbard.org/chronicle/page03.htm L. Ron Hubbard: A Chronicle, 1941–1949]" Church of Scientology International, 2007, retrieved February 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard began to make the first public mentions of what was to become Dianetics. His first thoughts on the subject were compiled in a short book called ''The Original Thesis'', which contained basic conclusions about human aberrations and handling them with auditing. His first published articles in Dianetics were "Terra Incognita: The Mind" in the Explorer Club Journal and another one that impacted people more heavily in Astounding Science Fiction. The positive public response to these articles led Hubbard to expand it to Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health. Scientologists consider the publication of the volume in May 9, 1950 as "a seminal event of the century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Melton |first1=J. Gordon |title=The Church of Scientology |publisher=Signature Books |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote in January 1949 that he was working on a "book of psychology" about "the cause and cure of nervous tension", which he was going to call ''The Dark Sword'', ''Excalibur'' or ''Science of the Mind''.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1949, Hubbard wrote to several professional organizations to offer his research.&lt;ref&gt;One such letter can be found on the Church of Scientology's official L. Ron Hubbard website. See "[http://dianetics.lronhubbard.org/page14.htm Letters from the Birth of Dianetics]," Church of Scientology International, 2004, retrieved February 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; None were interested, so he turned to his editor John W. Campbell, who was more receptive due to a long-standing fascination with fringe psychologies and psychic powers ("[[psionics]]") that "permeated both his fiction and non-fiction".&lt;ref&gt;Luckhurst, Roger. ''Science Fiction'', p. 74. Malden, MA: Polity, 2005. {{ISBN|978-0-7456-2893-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Campbell invited Hubbard and Sara to move into a cottage at [[Bay Head, New Jersey]], not far from his own home at [[Plainfield, New Jersey|Plainfield]]. In July 1949, Campbell recruited an acquaintance, Dr. Joseph Winter, to help develop Hubbard's new therapy of "Dianetics". Campbell told Winter:

{{quote|With cooperation from some institutions, some psychiatrists, [Hubbard] has worked on all types of cases. Institutionalized schizophrenics, apathies, manics, depressives, perverts, stuttering, neuroses—in all, nearly 1000 cases. But just a brief sampling of each type; he doesn't have proper statistics in the usual sense. But he has one statistic. He has cured every patient he worked with. He has cured ulcers, arthritis, asthma.&lt;ref name="Miller-149"&gt;Miller, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- verbatim quote: do not alter --&gt;}}

Hubbard collaborated with Campbell and Winter to refine his techniques,&lt;ref name="Atack-106"&gt;Atack, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; testing them on science fiction fans recruited by Campbell.&lt;ref name="Miller-150"&gt;Miller, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; The basic principle of Dianetics was that the brain recorded every experience and event in a person's life, even when unconscious. Bad or painful experiences were stored as what he called [[Engram (Dianetics)|"engrams"]] in a "[[reactive mind]]". These could be triggered later in life, causing emotional and physical problems. By carrying out a process he called [[Auditing (Scientology)|"auditing"]], a person could be regressed through his engrams to re-experiencing past experiences. This enabled engrams to be "cleared". The subject, who would now be in a state of [[Clear (Scientology)|"Clear"]], would have a perfectly functioning mind with an improved IQ and photographic memory.&lt;ref&gt;Streeter, pp. 210–211&lt;/ref&gt; The "Clear" would be cured of physical ailments ranging from poor eyesight to the common cold,&lt;ref name="Atack-108"&gt;Atack, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; which Hubbard asserted were purely [[psychosomatic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Timothy|title=America's Alternative Religions|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|year=1995|pages=385–386|isbn=978-0-7914-2398-1|oclc=30476551}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Winter submitted a paper on Dianetics to the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' and the ''[[American Journal of Psychiatry]]'' but both journals rejected it.&lt;ref name="Winter-18"&gt;Winter, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard and his collaborators decided to announce Dianetics in Campbell's ''Astounding Science Fiction'' instead. In an editorial, Campbell said: "Its power is almost unbelievable; it proves the mind not only can but does rule the body completely; following the sharply defined basic laws set forth, physical ills such as ulcers, asthma and arthritis can be cured, as can all other psychosomatic ills."&lt;ref name="Miller-145"&gt;Quoted in Miller, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; The birth of Hubbard's second daughter Alexis Valerie, delivered by Winter on March 8, 1950, came in the middle of the preparations to launch Dianetics.&lt;ref name="Miller-152"&gt;Miller, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; A "Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation" was established in April 1950 in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]], with Hubbard, Sara, Winter and Campbell on the board of directors.

Hubbard described Dianetics as "the hidden source of all psychosomatic ills and human aberration" when he introduced Dianetics to the world in the 1950s. He further claimed that "skills have been developed for their invariable cure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/vault/issue/1952-12-22/page/36/|title=The TIME Vault: December 22, 1952|publisher=|accessdate=July 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dianetics was duly launched in ''Astounding's'' May 1950 issue and on May 9, Hubbard's companion book ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]]'' was published&lt;ref name="Atack-107"&gt;Atack, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; by Hermitage House. Hubbard abandoned freelance writing in order to promote Dianetics, writing several books about it in the next decade, delivering an estimated 4,000 lectures while founding Dianetics research organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/L._Ron_Hubbard.aspx |title=L. Ron Hubbard |accessdate=December 18, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The etymological origin of the word Dianetics are the words ''dia'', meaning "through" and ''nous'', meaning "soul." Hubbard defined it as "a spiritual healing technology" and "an organized science of thought."&lt;ref name="Mccall 2007 437–47"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Psychiatry and Psychology in the Writings of L.

==From Dianetics to Scientology==
{{Main|History of Dianetics}}
[[File:L. Ron Hubbard conducting Dianetics seminar in Los Angeles in 1950.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A mostly seated crowd watches as Hubbard, seated on a chair, speaks to a woman lying prone in front of him.|Hubbard conducting a Dianetics seminar in Los Angeles, 1950]]
Hubbard called Dianetics "a milestone for man comparable to his discovery of fire and superior to his invention of the wheel and the arch". It was an immediate commercial success and sparked what [[Martin Gardner]] calls "a nationwide cult of incredible proportions".&lt;ref name="Gardner-265"&gt;Gardner, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; By August 1950, Hubbard's book had sold 55,000 copies, was selling at the rate of 4,000 a week and was being translated into French, German and Japanese. Five hundred Dianetic auditing groups had been set up across the United States.&lt;ref name="Newsweek-Dianetics"&gt;Staff (August 21, 1950). "Dianetics book review; Best Seller." ''Newsweek''&lt;/ref&gt;

Dianetics was poorly received by the press and the scientific and medical professions.&lt;ref name="Newsweek-Dianetics" /&gt; The [[American Psychological Association]] criticized Hubbard's claims as "not supported by empirical evidence".&lt;ref name="Maisel" /&gt; ''[[Scientific American]]'' said that Hubbard's book contained "more promises and less evidence per page than any publication since the invention of printing",&lt;ref&gt;Rabi, Isaac Isador. "Book Review." ''Scientific American'', January 1951&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[The New Republic]]'' called it a "bold and immodest mixture of complete nonsense and perfectly reasonable common sense, taken from long acknowledged findings and disguised and distorted by a crazy, newly invented terminology".&lt;ref&gt;Gumpert, Martin. (August 14, 1950) "''Dianetics'': book review by Martin Gumpert." ''The New Republic''&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Hubbard's fellow science fiction writers also criticized it; [[Isaac Asimov]] considered it "gibberish"&lt;ref name="Asimov" /&gt; while [[Jack Williamson]] called it "a lunatic revision of Freudian psychology".&lt;ref name="Miller-153"&gt;Miller, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;

Several famous individuals became involved with Dianetics. [[Aldous Huxley]] received auditing from Hubbard himself;&lt;ref name="Atack-115"&gt;Atack, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; the poet [[Jean Toomer]]&lt;ref&gt;Kerman, Cynthia Earl; Eldridge, Richard. ''The lives of Jean Toomer: a hunger for wholeness'', pp. 317–318. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1989. {{ISBN|978-0-8071-1548-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the science fiction writers [[Theodore Sturgeon]]&lt;ref&gt;Sturgeon, Theodore; Williams, Paul. ''Baby is three'', p. 414. Berkeley, CA: North Atlantic Books, 1999. {{ISBN|978-1-55643-319-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[A. E. van Vogt]] became trained Dianetics auditors. Van Vogt temporarily abandoned writing and became the head of the newly established Los Angeles branch of the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation. Other branches were established in New York, Washington, D.C., Chicago, and Honolulu.&lt;ref name="Miller-166" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melton, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Dianetics was not cheap, a great many people were nonetheless willing to pay; van Vogt later recalled "doing little but tear open envelopes and pull out $500 checks from people who wanted to take an auditor's course".&lt;ref name="Miller-166"&gt;Miller, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; Financial controls were lax. Hubbard himself withdrew large sums with no explanation of what he was doing with it. On one occasion, van Vogt saw Hubbard taking a lump sum of $56,000 (equivalent to $0.5 million at 2010 prices) out of the Los Angeles Foundation's proceeds.&lt;ref name="Miller-166" /&gt; One of Hubbard's employees, Helen O'Brien, commented that at the Elizabeth, N.J. branch of the Foundation, the books showed that "a month's income of $90,000 is listed, with only $20,000 accounted for".&lt;ref name="OBrien-27"&gt;O'Brien, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard played a very active role in the Dianetics boom, writing, lecturing and training auditors. Many of those who knew him spoke of being impressed by his personal [[charisma]]. Jack Horner, who became a Dianetics auditor in 1950, later said, "He was very impressive, dedicated and amusing. The man had tremendous charisma; you just wanted to hear every word he had to say and listen for any pearl of wisdom."&lt;ref&gt;Miller, pp. 159–160&lt;/ref&gt; Isaac Asimov recalled in his autobiography how, at a dinner party, he, Robert Heinlein, L. Sprague de Camp and their wives "all sat as quietly as pussycats and listened to Hubbard. He told tales with perfect aplomb and in complete paragraphs."&lt;ref name="Asimov" /&gt; As Atack comments, he was "a charismatic figure who compelled the devotion of those around him".&lt;ref&gt;Atack, p. 377&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher Evans (computer scientist)|Christopher Evans]] described the personal qualities that Hubbard brought to Dianetics and Scientology:

{{quote|He undoubtedly has charisma, a magnetic lure of an indefinable kind which makes him the centre of attraction in any kind of gathering. He is also a compulsive talker and pontificator&amp;nbsp;... His restless energy keeps him on the go throughout a long day—he is a poor sleeper and rises very early—and provides part of the drive which has allowed him to found and propagate a major international organization.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hubbard's supporters soon began to have doubts about Dianetics. Winter became disillusioned and wrote that he had never seen a single convincing Clear: "I have seen some individuals who are supposed to have been 'clear,' but their behavior does not conform to the definition of the state. Moreover, an individual supposed to have been 'clear' has undergone a relapse into conduct which suggests an incipient psychosis."&lt;ref name="Winter-34"&gt;Winter, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; He also deplored the Foundation's omission of any serious scientific research.&lt;ref name="Miller-169"&gt;Miller, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; Dianetics lost public credibility in August 1950 when a presentation by Hubbard before an audience of 6,000 at the [[Shrine Auditorium]] in Los Angeles failed disastrously.&lt;ref name="Whitehead-67"&gt;Whitehead, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced a Clear named Sonya Bianca and told the audience that as a result of undergoing Dianetic therapy she now possessed perfect recall. However, Gardner writes, "in the demonstration that followed, she failed to remember a single formula in physics (the subject in which she was majoring) or the color of Hubbard's tie when his back was turned. At this point, a large part of the audience got up and left."&lt;ref name="Gardner-270"&gt;Gardner, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard also faced other practitioners moving into leadership positions within the Dianetics community. It was structured as an open, public practice in which others were free to pursue their own lines of research and claim that their approaches to auditing produced better results than Hubbard's.&lt;ref&gt;Stark, Rodney; Bainbridge, William Sims. ''The future of religion: secularization, revival, and cult formation'', pp. 268–269. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1986. {{ISBN|978-0-520-05731-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The community rapidly splintered and its members mingled Hubbard's ideas with a wide variety of [[Esotericism|esoteric]] and even occult practices.&lt;ref name="Marshall-186"&gt;Marshall, Gordon. ''In praise of sociology'', p. 186. London: Routledge, 1990. {{ISBN|978-0-04-445688-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; By late 1950, the Elizabeth, N.J. Foundation was in financial crisis and the Los Angeles Foundation was more than $200,000 in debt ({{Inflation|US|200000|1959|fmt=eq|cursign=[[$]]}}).&lt;ref name="Miller-173"&gt;Miller, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; Winter and Art Ceppos, the publisher of Hubbard's book, resigned under acrimonious circumstances.&lt;ref name="Atack-115" /&gt; Campbell also resigned, criticizing Hubbard for being impossible to work with, and blamed him for the disorganization and financial ruin of the Foundations.&lt;ref name="Miller-181"/&gt; By the summer of 1951, the Elizabeth, N.J. Foundation and all of its branches had closed.&lt;ref name="OBrien-27" /&gt;

The collapse of Hubbard's marriage to Sara created yet more problems. He had begun an affair with his 20-year-old public relations assistant in late 1950, while Sara started a relationship with Dianetics auditor Miles Hollister.&lt;ref name="Miller-199"&gt;Miller, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard secretly denounced the couple to the [[FBI]] in March 1951, portraying them in a letter as [[communism|communist]] infiltrators. According to Hubbard, Sara was "currently intimate with [communists] but evidently under coercion. Drug addiction set in fall 1950. Nothing of this known to me until a few weeks ago." Hollister was described as having a "sharp chin, broad forehead, rather Slavic". He was said to be the "center of most turbulence in our organization" and "active and dangerous".&lt;ref name="Miller-180"&gt;Miller, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI did not take Hubbard seriously: an agent annotated his correspondence with the comment, "Appears mental."&lt;ref name="Methvin" /&gt;

Three weeks later, Hubbard and two Foundation staff seized Sara and his year-old daughter Alexis and forcibly took them to [[San Bernardino, California]], where he attempted unsuccessfully to find a doctor to examine Sara and declare her insane.&lt;ref name="Atack-117"&gt;Atack, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; He let Sara go but took Alexis to [[Havana]], [[Cuba]]. Sara filed a divorce suit on April 23, 1951, that accused him of marrying her [[bigamy|bigamously]] and subjecting her to [[sleep deprivation]], beatings, [[strangulation]], kidnapping and exhortations to commit suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Walter Ralston; Zacharias, Ravi K. (ed.). ''The Kingdom of the Cults'', p. 338. Minneapolis: Bethany House, 2003. {{ISBN|978-0-7642-2821-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case led to newspaper headlines such as "Ron Hubbard Insane, Says His Wife."&lt;ref&gt;Staff (April 24, 1951). "Ron Hubbard Insane, Says His Wife." ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Sara finally secured the return of her daughter in June 1951 by agreeing to a settlement with her husband in which she signed a statement, written by him, declaring:

{{quote|The things I have said about L. Ron Hubbard in courts and the public prints have been grossly exaggerated or entirely false. I have not at any time believed otherwise than that L. Ron Hubbard is a fine and brilliant man.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Miller, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Dianetics appeared to be on the edge of total collapse. However, it was saved by Don Purcell, a millionaire businessman and Dianeticist who agreed to support a new Foundation in [[Wichita, Kansas]]. Their collaboration ended after less than a year when they fell out over the future direction of Dianetics.&lt;ref name="Streissguth-71"&gt;Streissguth, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; The Wichita Foundation became financially nonviable after a court ruled that it was liable for the unpaid debts of its defunct predecessor in Elizabeth, N.J. The ruling prompted Purcell and the other directors of the Wichita Foundation to file for voluntary bankruptcy in February 1952.&lt;ref name="Miller-199" /&gt; Hubbard resigned immediately and accused Purcell of having been bribed by the [[American Medical Association]] to destroy Dianetics.&lt;ref name="Streissguth-71" /&gt; Hubbard established a "Hubbard College" on the other side of town where he continued to promote Dianetics while fighting Purcell in the courts over the Foundation's intellectual property.&lt;ref name="Miller-200"&gt;Miller, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

Only six weeks after setting up the Hubbard College and marrying a staff member, 18-year-old Mary Sue Whipp, Hubbard closed it down and moved with his new bride to [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. He established a [[Hubbard Association of Scientologists|Hubbard Association of Scientologists International]] to promote his new "Science of Certainty"—Scientology.&lt;ref name="Atack-129"&gt;Atack, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Scientology and Dianetics have been differentiated as follows: Dianetics is all about releasing the mind from the "distorting influence of engrams", and Scientology "is the study and handling of the spirit in relation to itself, universes and other life".&lt;ref name="Mccall 2007 437–47"/&gt;

The Church of Scientology attributes its genesis to Hubbard's discovery of "a new line of research"—"that man is most fundamentally a spiritual being (a [[thetan]])".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://mediaresources.lronhubbard.org/chronicle/page04.htm L. Ron Hubbard: A Chronicle, 1950–1959]. Church of Scientology International, 2007, retrieved February 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-Scientologist writers have suggested alternative motives: that he aimed "to reassert control over his creation",&lt;ref name="Marshall-186" /&gt; that he believed "he was about to lose control of Dianetics",&lt;ref name="Streissguth-71" /&gt; or that he wanted to ensure "he would be able to stay in business even if the courts eventually awarded control of Dianetics and its valuable copyrights to&amp;nbsp;... the hated Don Purcell."&lt;ref name="Miller-203"&gt;Miller, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harlan Ellison]] has told a story of seeing Hubbard at a gathering of the [[Hydra Club]] in 1953 or 1954. Hubbard was complaining of not being able to make a living on what he was being paid as a science fiction writer. Ellison says that [[Lester del Rey]] told Hubbard that what he needed to do to get rich was start a religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Underdown |first1=James |authorlink1=James Underdown |title='I Was There...': Harlan Ellison Witnesses the Birth of Scientology |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=6 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard expanded upon the basics of Dianetics to construct a spiritually oriented (though at this stage not religious) [[doctrine]] based on the concept that the true self of a person was a thetan — an immortal, omniscient and potentially omnipotent entity.&lt;ref name=dechant&gt;DeChant, Dell; Danny L. Jorgensen. "The Church of Scientology: A Very New American Religion" in Neusner, Jacob. ''World Religions in America: An Introduction'', p. 226. Westminster John Knox Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-664-22475-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard taught that thetans, having created the material universe, had forgotten their god-like powers and become trapped in physical bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Bromley, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Scientology aimed to "rehabilitate" each person's self (the thetan) to restore its original capacities and become once again an "[[Operating Thetan]]".&lt;ref name="Miller-203" /&gt;&lt;ref name=dechant /&gt; Hubbard insisted humanity was imperiled by the forces of "aberration", which were the result of engrams carried by immortal thetans for billions of years.&lt;ref name="Streissguth-71" /&gt;

In 2012, [[Ohio State University]] professor [[Hugh Urban]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ortega |first=Tony |date=September 15, 2011 |title=Hugh Urban: An Interview With the Professor Who Took on Scientology |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/hugh-urban-an-interview-with-the-professor-who-took-on-scientology-6692498 |newspaper=[[The Village Voice]] |location=villagevoice.com |access-date=April 19, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; asserted that Hubbard had adopted many of his theories from the early to mid 20th century [[astral projection]] pioneer [[Sylvan Muldoon]] stating that Hubbard's description of exteriorizing the thetan is extremely similar if not identical to the descriptions of astral projection in occult literature popularized by Muldoon's widely read  Phenomena of Astral Projection (1951) (co-written with [[Hereward Carrington]]) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Muldoon |first=Sylvan |date=1951 |title=The Phenomena of Astral Projection |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/phenomena-astral-projection-Sylvan-Muldoon/dp/B0000CHX60/279-8602485-4362939?ie=UTF8&amp;*Version*=1&amp;*entries*=0 |location=[[Amazon.com|Amazon]] |publisher=[[Rider (imprint)|Rider]] |page= |asin=B0000CHX60}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that Muldoon's description of the astral body as being connected to the physical body by a long thin, elastic cord is virtually identical to the one described in Hubbard's [[Excalibur (L.

Hubbard introduced a device called an [[E-meter]] that he presented as having, as Miller puts it, "an almost mystical power to reveal an individual's innermost thoughts".&lt;ref name="Miller-204"&gt;Miller, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; He promulgated Scientology through a series of lectures, bulletins and books such as ''[[Scientology: A History of Man|A History of Man]]'' ("a cold-blooded and factual account of your last sixty trillion years")&lt;ref name="Miller-204" /&gt; and ''Scientology: 8-8008'' ("With this book, the ability to make one's body old or young at will, the ability to heal the ill without physical contact, the ability to cure the insane and the incapacitated, is set forth for the physician, the layman, the mathematician and the physicist.")&lt;ref name="Miller-206"&gt;Miller, p. 206&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientology was organized in a very different way from the decentralized Dianetics movement. The Hubbard Association of Scientologists (HAS) was the only official Scientology organization. Training procedures and doctrines were standardized and promoted through HAS publications, and administrators and auditors were not permitted to deviate from Hubbard's approach.&lt;ref name="Marshall-186" /&gt; Branches or "orgs" were organized as franchises, rather like a [[fast food restaurant]] chain. Each franchise holder was required to pay ten percent of income to Hubbard's central organization. They were expected to find new recruits, known as "raw meat", but were restricted to providing only basic services. Costlier higher-level auditing was only provided by Hubbard's central organization.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, p. 304&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this model would eventually be extremely successful, Scientology was a very small-scale movement at first. Hubbard started off with only a few dozen followers, generally dedicated Dianeticists; a seventy-hour series of lectures in [[Philadelphia]] in December 1952 was attended by just 38 people.&lt;ref name="Miller-210"&gt;Miller, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard was joined in Phoenix by his 18-year-old son Nibs, who had been unable to settle down in high school.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; Nibs had decided to become a Scientologist, moved into his father's home and went on to become a Scientology staff member and "professor".&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard also traveled to the United Kingdom to establish his control over a Dianetics group in [[London]]. It was very much a shoestring operation; as Helen O'Brien later recalled, "there was an atmosphere of extreme poverty and undertones of a grim conspiracy over all. At 163 [[Holland Park Avenue]] was an ill-lit lecture room and a bare-boarded and poky office some eight by ten feet—mainly infested by long haired men and short haired and tatty women."&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; On September 24, 1952, only a few weeks after arriving in London, Hubbard's wife Mary Sue gave birth to her first child, a daughter whom they named Diana Meredith de Wolfe Hubbard.&lt;ref name="Miller-208"&gt;Miller, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1953, Hubbard acquired a doctorate from the [[educational accreditation|unaccredited]] [[Sequoia University]]. According to a Scientology biography, this was "given in recognition of his outstanding work on Dianetics" and "as an inspiration to the many people&amp;nbsp;... who had been inspired by him to take up advanced studies in this field&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name="FIL67" /&gt; The British government concluded in the 1970s that Sequoia University was a "[[degree mill]]" operated by Joseph Hough, a Los Angeles [[chiropractor]].&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt; Miller cites a telegram sent by Hubbard on February 27, 1953, in which he instructed Scientologist Richard de Mille to procure him a [[Ph.D.]] from Hough urgently—"FOR GOSH SAKES EXPEDITE. WORK HERE UTTERLY DEPENDANT ON IT."&lt;ref name="Miller-212"&gt;Miller, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; Hough's "university" was closed down by the Californian authorities in 1971. British government officials noted in a report written in 1977: "It has not and never had any authority whatsoever to issue diplomas or degrees and the dean is sought by the authorities 'for questioning'."&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Smith, Graham (August 7, 2009).

A few weeks after becoming "Dr." Hubbard, he wrote to Helen O'Brien—who had taken over the day-to-day management of Scientology in the United States—proposing that Scientology should be transformed into a religion.&lt;ref&gt;Streeter, p. 215; Miller, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; As membership declined and finances grew tighter, Hubbard had reversed the hostility to religion he voiced in ''Dianetics''.&lt;ref name=creation&gt;Kent, Stephen A.

O'Brien was not enthusiastic and resigned the following September, worn out by work.&lt;ref name="Miller-214"&gt;Miller, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; She criticized Hubbard for creating "a temperate zone voodoo, in its inelasticity, unexplainable procedures, and mindless group euphoria".&lt;ref name="OBrien-vii"&gt;O'Brien, p. vii&lt;/ref&gt; He nonetheless pressed ahead and on December 18, 1953, he incorporated the Church of Scientology, Church of American Science and Church of Spiritual Engineering in [[Camden, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;Williams, Ian.

"Three Churches Are Given Charters in New Jersey." ''The Aberree'', volume 1, issue 1, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Scientology franchises became Churches of Scientology and some auditors began dressing as clergymen, complete with [[clerical collar]]s. If they were arrested in the course of their activities, Hubbard advised, they should sue for massive damages for molesting "a Man of God going about his business".&lt;ref name="Williams" /&gt; A few years later he told Scientologists: "If attacked on some vulnerable point by anyone or anything or any organization, always find or manufacture enough threat against them to cause them to sue for peace&amp;nbsp;... Don't ever defend, always attack."&lt;ref name="Miller-239"&gt;Miller, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; Any individual breaking away from Scientology and setting up his own group was to be shut down:

{{quote|The purpose of the suit is to harass and discourage rather than to win.

If possible, of course, ruin him utterly.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, L. Ron. "The Scientologist: A Manual on the Dissemination of Material," 1955. Quoted in Atack, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The 1950s saw Scientology growing steadily. Hubbard finally achieved victory over Don Purcell in 1954 when the latter, worn out by constant litigation, handed the copyrights of Dianetics back to Hubbard.&lt;ref name="Atack-138"&gt;Atack, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the formerly independent Scientology and Dianetics groups were either driven out of business or were absorbed into Hubbard's organizations.&lt;ref name="Atack-139"&gt;Atack, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard marketed Scientology through [[Medical claims in Scientology doctrine|medical claims]], such as attracting [[polio]] sufferers by presenting the Church of Scientology as a scientific research foundation investigating polio cases.&lt;ref name="Streissguth-74"&gt;Streissguth, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; One advertisement during this period stated:

Scientology became a highly profitable enterprise for Hubbard.&lt;ref name="Atack-142"&gt;Atack, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; He implemented a scheme under which he was paid a percentage of the Church of Scientology's gross income and by 1957 he was being paid about $250,000 ({{Inflation|US|250000|1957|fmt=eq|cursign=[[US$]] }}).&lt;ref name="Miller-227"&gt;Miller, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; His family grew, too, with Mary Sue giving birth to three more children—[[Quentin Hubbard|Geoffrey Quentin McCaully]] on January 6, 1954;&lt;ref name="Miller-214" /&gt; Mary Suzette Rochelle on February 13, 1955;&lt;ref name="Miller-221"&gt;Miller, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; and Arthur Ronald Conway on June 6, 1958.&lt;ref name="Miller-230"&gt;Miller, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 1959, he used his new-found wealth to purchase [[Saint Hill Manor]], an 18th-century [[English country houses|country house]] in [[Sussex]], formerly owned by [[Sawai Man Singh II]], the [[Maharaja of Jaipur]]. The house became Hubbard's permanent residence and an international training center for Scientologists.&lt;ref name="Streissguth-74" /&gt;

==Controversies and crises==
[[File:Phoenix-L. Ron Hubbart House-1945.JPG|250px|thumb|The L. Ron Hubbard House at Camelback in Phoenix, Arizona. The house is listed in the National Register of Historic Places]] [[File:Phoenix-L. Ron Hubbart House-Buick Super 8.JPG|250px|thumb|L. Ron Hubbard's car, a 1947 Buick Super 8. The car is parked behind the house]]
By the start of the 1960s, Hubbard was the leader of a worldwide movement with thousands of followers. A decade later, however, he had left Saint Hill Manor and moved aboard his own private fleet of ships as the Church of Scientology faced worldwide controversy.

The Church of Scientology says that the problems of this period were due to "vicious, covert international attacks" by the United States government, "all of which were proven false and baseless, which were to last 27 years and finally culminated in the Government being sued for 750&amp;nbsp;million dollars for conspiracy."&lt;ref name="FIL67" /&gt; Behind the attacks, stated Hubbard, lay a vast conspiracy of "psychiatric front groups" secretly controlling governments: "Every single lie, false charge and attack on Scientology has been traced directly to this group's members. They have sought at great expense for nineteen years to crush and eradicate any new development in the field of the mind. They are actively preventing any effectiveness in this field."&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, L. Ron. "[http://freedom.lronhubbard.org/page020.htm Constitutional Destruction]." June 9, 1969, retrieved February 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard believed that Scientology was being infiltrated by saboteurs and spies and introduced "[[List of Scientology Security Checks|security checking]]"&lt;ref name="Miller-239" /&gt; to identify those he termed "potential trouble sources" and "[[suppressive person]]s". Members of the Church of Scientology were interrogated with the aid of E-meters and were asked questions such as "Have you ever practiced homosexuality?" and "Have you ever had unkind thoughts about L. Ron Hubbard?"&lt;ref name="Atack-150"&gt;Atack, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; For a time, Scientologists were even interrogated about crimes committed in past lives: "Have you ever destroyed a culture?" "Did you come to Earth for evil purposes?" "Have you ever zapped anyone?"&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, L. Ron. "Sec Check Whole Track," HCO Bulletin of June 19, 1961; quoted in Atack, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;

He also sought to exert political influence, advising Scientologists to vote against [[Richard Nixon]] in the [[1960 United States presidential election|1960 presidential election]] and establishing a Department of Government Affairs "to bring government and hostile philosophies or societies into a state of complete compliance with the goals of Scientology". This, he said, "is done by high-level ability to control and in its absence by a low-level ability to overwhelm. Introvert such agencies. Control such agencies."&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, L. Ron. "Department of Government Affairs," HCO Policy Letter of August 15, 1960; quoted in Miller, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Government was already well aware of Hubbard's activities. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] had a lengthy file on him, including a 1951 interview with an agent who considered him a "mental case".&lt;ref name="Miller-181"&gt;Miller, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; Police forces in a number of jurisdictions began exchanging information about Scientology through the auspices of [[Interpol]], which eventually led to prosecutions.&lt;ref&gt;Fooner, Michael. ''Interpol: issues in world crime and international criminal justice'', p. 13. New York: Plenum Press, 1989. {{ISBN|978-0-306-43135-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, the U.S. [[Internal Revenue Service]] withdrew the Washington, D.C. Church of Scientology's [[tax exemption]] after it found that Hubbard and his family were profiting unreasonably from Scientology's ostensibly non-profit income.&lt;ref name="Atack-142" /&gt; The [[Food and Drug Administration]] took action against Scientology's medical claims, seizing thousands of pills being marketed as "radiation cures"&lt;ref name="Miller-228"&gt;Miller, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; as well as publications and E-meters. The Church of Scientology was required to label them as being "ineffective in the diagnosis or treatment of disease".&lt;ref name="Atack-154"&gt;Atack, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the FDA's actions, Scientology attracted increasingly unfavorable publicity across the English-speaking world.&lt;ref name="Wallis-192"&gt;Wallis, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; It faced particularly hostile scrutiny in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria, Australia]], where it was accused of [[brainwashing]], blackmail, extortion and damaging the mental health of its members.&lt;ref name="Wallis-215"&gt;Wallis, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; The Victorian state government established a Board of Inquiry into Scientology in November 1963.&lt;ref name="Miller-250"&gt;Miller, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anderson Report|Its report]], published in October 1965, condemned every aspect of Scientology and Hubbard himself. He was described as being of doubtful sanity, having a [[persecution complex]] and displaying strong indications of [[paranoid schizophrenia]] with [[delusions of grandeur]]. His writings were characterized as nonsensical, abounding in "self-glorification and grandiosity, replete with histrionics and hysterical, incontinent outbursts".&lt;ref&gt;Miller, pp. 252–253&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist [[Roy Wallis]] comments that the report drastically changed public perceptions of Scientology:

{{quote|The former conception of the movement as a relatively harmless, if cranky, health and self-improvement cult, was transformed into one which portrayed it as evil, dangerous, a form of hypnosis (with all the overtones of [[Svengali]] in the layman's mind), and brainwashing.&lt;ref name="Wallis-215" /&gt;}}

The report led to Scientology being banned in Victoria,&lt;ref name="Wallis-193"&gt;Wallis, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; [[Western Australia]] and [[South Australia]],&lt;ref name="Wallis-196"&gt;Wallis, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; and led to more negative publicity around the world. Newspapers and politicians in the UK pressed the British government for action against Scientology. In April 1966, hoping to form a remote "safe haven" for Scientology, Hubbard traveled to the southern African country [[Rhodesia]] (today Zimbabwe) and looked into setting up a base there at a hotel on [[Lake Kariba]]. Despite his attempts to curry favour with the local government—he personally delivered champagne to Prime Minister [[Ian Smith]]'s house, but Smith refused to see him—Rhodesia promptly refused to renew Hubbard's visa, compelling him to leave the country.&lt;ref&gt;Reitman (2011), pp. 80–81&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1968, the British [[Secretary of State for Health|Minister of Health]], [[Kenneth Robinson]], announced that foreign Scientologists would no longer be permitted to enter the UK and Hubbard himself was excluded from the country as an "[[undesirable alien]]".&lt;ref name="Atack-183"&gt;Atack, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; Further inquiries were launched in Canada, New Zealand and [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name="Wallis-196" /&gt;

Hubbard took three major new initiatives in the face of these challenges. "Ethics Technology" was introduced to tighten internal discipline within Scientology. It required Scientologists to "[[Disconnection|disconnect]]" from any organization or individual—including family members—deemed to be disruptive or "suppressive".&lt;ref name="Atack-155"&gt;Atack, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; According to church-operated websites, "A person who disconnects is simply exercising his right to communicate or not to communicate with a particular person." Hubbard stated: "Communication, however, is a two-way flow. If one has the right to communicate, then one must also have the right to not receive communication from another. It is this latter corollary of the right to communicate that gives us our right to privacy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whatisscientology.org/html/Part12/Chp36/pg0649.html |title=What is disconnection? |accessdate=December 17, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientologists were also required to write "Knowledge Reports" on each other, reporting transgressions or misapplications of Scientology methods. Hubbard promulgated a long list of punishable "Misdemeanors", "Crimes", and "High Crimes".&lt;ref name="Atack-156"&gt;Atack, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; The "[[Fair Game (Scientology)|Fair Game]]" policy was introduced, which was applicable to anyone deemed an "enemy" of Scientology: "May be deprived of property or injured by any means by any Scientologist without any discipline of the Scientologist. May be tricked, sued or lied to or destroyed."&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, L. Ron. "Penalties for Lower Conditions." HCO Policy Letter of October 18, 1967, Issue IV. Quoted in Atack, pp. 175–176&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wallis, pp. 144–145&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of March 1966, Hubbard created the [[Guardian's Office]] (GO), a new agency within the Church of Scientology that was headed by his wife Mary Sue.&lt;ref name="Atack-161"&gt;Atack, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; It dealt with Scientology's external affairs, including public relations, legal actions and the gathering of intelligence on perceived threats.&lt;ref name="Atack-165"&gt;Atack, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; As Scientology faced increasingly negative media attention, the GO retaliated with hundreds of writs for libel and slander; it issued more than forty on a single day.&lt;ref name="Atack-189"&gt;Atack, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard ordered his staff to find "lurid, blood sex crime actual evidence {{sic}} on [Scientology's] attackers".&lt;ref name="Atack-160"&gt;Atack, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, at the end of 1966, Hubbard acquired his own fleet of ships.&lt;ref name="Wright" /&gt; He established the "Hubbard Explorational Company Ltd" which purchased three ships—the ''Enchanter'', a forty-ton schooner,&lt;ref name="Miller-264"&gt;Miller, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Avon River'', an old trawler,&lt;ref name="Miller-265"&gt;Miller, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Royal Scotman'' {{sic}}, a former [[Irish Sea]] cattle ferry that he made his home and flagship.&lt;ref name="Miller-269"&gt;Miller, p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; The ships were crewed by the Sea Organization or [[Sea Org]], a group of Scientologist volunteers, with the support of a couple of professional seamen.&lt;ref name="Wright" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller-272"&gt;Miller, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commodore of the Sea Org==
{{Main|Sea Org}}
[[File:CityofCorfu.jpg|right|thumb|alt=View of a coastal town with a bay visible behind foreground buildings|Corfu town, where the Sea Org moored in 1968–1969]]
After Hubbard created the Sea Org "fleet" in early 1967 it began an eight-year voyage, sailing from port to port in the Mediterranean Sea and eastern [[North Atlantic]]. The fleet traveled as far as [[Corfu]] in the eastern Mediterranean and [[Dakar]] and the [[Azores]] in the Atlantic, but rarely stayed anywhere for longer than six weeks. Ken Urquhart, Hubbard's personal assistant at the time, later recalled:

{{quote|[Hubbard] said we had to keep moving because there were so many people after him. If they caught up with him they would cause him so much trouble that he would be unable to continue his work, Scientology would not get into the world and there would be social and economic chaos, if not a nuclear holocaust.&lt;ref name="Miller-297"&gt;Quoted in Miller, p. 297&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When Hubbard established the Sea Org he publicly declared that he had relinquished his management responsibilities. According to Miller, this was not true. He received daily [[telex]] messages from Scientology organizations around the world reporting their statistics and income. The Church of Scientology sent him $15,000 ({{Inflation|US|15000|1967|fmt=eq}}) a week and millions of dollars were transferred to his bank accounts in [[Switzerland]] and [[Liechtenstein]].&lt;ref name="Miller-299"&gt;Miller, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; Couriers arrived regularly, conveying luxury food for Hubbard and his family&lt;ref name="Miller-300"&gt;Miller, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt; or cash that had been smuggled from England to avoid currency export restrictions.&lt;ref name="Miller-290"&gt;Miller, p. 290&lt;/ref&gt;

Along the way, Hubbard sought to establish a safe haven in "a friendly little country where Scientology would be allowed to prosper", as Miller puts it.&lt;ref name="Miller-310"&gt;Miller, p. 310&lt;/ref&gt; The fleet stayed at Corfu for several months in 1968–1969. Hubbard renamed the ships after Greek gods—the ''Royal Scotman'' was rechristened ''Apollo''—and he praised the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974|recently established military dictatorship]].&lt;ref name="Miller-290"/&gt; The Sea Org was represented as "Professor Hubbard's Philosophy School" in a telegram to the Greek government.&lt;ref name="Miller-295"&gt;Miller, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1969, however, Hubbard and his ships were ordered to leave.&lt;ref name="Miller-2965"&gt;Miller, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-1972, Hubbard tried again in [[Morocco]], establishing contacts with the country's [[secret police]] and training senior policemen and intelligence agents in techniques for detecting subversives.&lt;ref name="Miller-311"&gt;Miller, p. 311&lt;/ref&gt; The program ended in failure when it became caught up in internal Moroccan politics, and Hubbard left the country hastily in December 1972.&lt;ref name="Miller-312"&gt;Miller, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, Hubbard was still developing Scientology's doctrines. A Scientology biography states that "free of organizational duties and aided by the first Sea Org members, L. Ron Hubbard now had the time and facilities to confirm in the [[physical universe]] some of the events and places he had encountered in his journeys down the track of time."&lt;ref name="Mission" /&gt; In 1965, he designated several existing Scientology courses as confidential, repackaging them as the first of the esoteric "[[Operating Thetan|OT levels]]".&lt;ref name="Atack-159"&gt;Atack, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later he announced the release of OT3, the "Wall of Fire", revealing the secrets of an immense disaster that had occurred "on this planet, and on the other seventy-five planets which form this Confederacy, seventy-five million years ago".&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, L. Ron. "Ron's Journal '67," quoted in Atack, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; Scientologists were required to undertake the first two OT levels before learning how [[Xenu]], the leader of the Galactic Confederacy, had shipped billions of people to Earth and blown them up with [[hydrogen bomb]]s, following which their traumatized spirits were stuck together at "implant stations", brainwashed with false memories and eventually became contained within human beings.&lt;ref name="Atack-32"&gt;Atack, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of OT3 was said to have taken a major physical toll on Hubbard, who announced that he had broken a knee, an arm, and his back during the course of his research.&lt;ref name="Atack-173"&gt;Atack, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, in 1968, he unveiled OT levels 4 to 6 and began delivering OT training courses to Scientologists aboard the ''Royal Scotman''.&lt;ref name="Atack-177"&gt;Atack, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientologists around the world were presented with a glamorous picture of life in the Sea Org and many applied to join Hubbard aboard the fleet.&lt;ref name="Atack-177" /&gt; What they found was rather different from the image. Most of those joining had no nautical experience at all.&lt;ref name="Atack-177" /&gt; Mechanical difficulties and blunders by the crews led to a series of embarrassing incidents and near-disasters. Following one incident in which the rudder of the ''Royal Scotman'' was damaged during a storm, Hubbard ordered the ship's entire crew to be reduced to a "condition of liability" and wear gray rags tied to their arms.&lt;ref name="Miller-285"&gt;Miller, p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; The ship itself was treated the same way, with dirty tarpaulins tied around its funnel to symbolize its lower status. According to those aboard, conditions were appalling; the crew was worked to the point of exhaustion, given meagre rations and forbidden to wash or change their clothes for several weeks.&lt;ref name="Miller-286"&gt;Miller, p. 286&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard maintained a harsh disciplinary regime aboard the fleet, punishing mistakes by confining people in the ''Royal Scotman''{{'s}} bilge tanks without toilet facilities and with food provided in buckets.&lt;ref name="Atack-180"&gt;Atack, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; At other times erring crew members were thrown overboard with Hubbard looking on and, occasionally, filming.&lt;ref name="Atack-186"&gt;Atack, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Mayo (Scientology)|David Mayo]], a Sea Org member at the time, later recalled:

{{quote|We tried not to think too hard about his behavior. It was not rational much of the time, but to even consider such a thing was a discreditable thought and you couldn't allow yourself to have a discreditable thought. One of the questions in a sec[urity] check was, "Have you ever had any unkind thoughts about LRH?" and you could get into very serious trouble if you had. So you tried hard not to.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From about 1970, Hubbard was attended aboard ship by the children of Sea Org members, organized as the [[Commodore's Messenger Organization]] (CMO). They were mainly young girls dressed in [[hot pants]] and [[halter top]]s, who were responsible for running errands for Hubbard such as lighting his cigarettes, dressing him or relaying his verbal commands to other members of the crew.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 301&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sw-life"&gt;Sappell, Joel; Welkos, Robert (June 24, 1990).

''Los Angeles Times'', retrieved February 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his wife Mary Sue, he was accompanied by all four of his children by her, though not his first son Nibs, who had defected from Scientology in late 1959.&lt;ref name="Miller-236"&gt;Miller, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; The younger Hubbards were all members of the Sea Org and shared its rigors, though Quentin Hubbard reportedly found it difficult to adjust and attempted suicide in mid-1974.&lt;ref name="Miller-325"&gt;Miller, p. 325&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life in hiding==
[[File:IRS building on constitution avenue in DC.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Exterior view of a large building, partly obscured by trees|The Internal Revenue Service building in Washington D.C., one of the targets of Hubbard's [[Operation Snow White|"Snow White Program"]]]]
During the 1970s, Hubbard faced an increasing number of legal threats. French prosecutors charged him and the French Church of Scientology with fraud and customs violations in 1972. He was advised that he was at risk of being extradited to France.&lt;ref name="Corydon-94"&gt;Corydon, Bent. ''L. Ron Hubbard: Messiah or Madman?'', p. 94. Fort Lee, N.J.: Barricade Books, 1992. {{ISBN|978-0-942637-57-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard left the Sea Org fleet temporarily at the end of 1972, living incognito in [[Queens]], New York,&lt;ref name="Miller-314"&gt;Miller, p. 314&lt;/ref&gt; until he returned to his flagship in September 1973 when the threat of extradition had abated.&lt;ref name="Miller-318"&gt;Miller, p. 318&lt;/ref&gt; Scientology sources say that he carried out "a sociological study in and around New York City".&lt;ref name="Chronicle1970-1979"&gt;"[http://mediaresources.lronhubbard.org/chronicle/page06.htm L. Ron Hubbard: A Chronicle, 1970–1979]." Church of Scientology International, 2007, retrieved February 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard's health deteriorated significantly during this period. A [[chain smoking|chain-smoker]], he also suffered from [[bursitis]] and excessive weight, and had a prominent growth on his forehead.&lt;ref name="Miller-316"&gt;Miller, p. 316&lt;/ref&gt; He suffered serious injuries in a motorcycle accident in 1973 and had a heart attack in 1975 that required him to take [[anticoagulant]] drugs for the next year.&lt;ref name="Atack-255"&gt;Atack, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1978, Hubbard had a [[pulmonary embolism]], falling into a coma, but recovered.&lt;ref name="Atack-256"&gt;Atack, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;

He remained active in managing and developing Scientology, establishing the controversial [[Rehabilitation Project Force]] in 1974&lt;ref name="Atack-206"&gt;Atack, p. 206&lt;/ref&gt; and issuing policy and doctrinal bulletins.&lt;ref name="Atack-204"&gt;Atack, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Sea Org's voyages were coming to an end. The ''Apollo'' was banned from several Spanish ports&lt;ref name="Atack-204" /&gt; and was expelled from [[Curaçao]] in October 1975.&lt;ref name="Atack-209"&gt;Atack, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; The Sea Org came to be suspected of being a [[CIA]] operation, leading to a riot in [[Funchal]], [[Madeira]], when the ''Apollo'' docked there. At the time, ''The Apollo Stars'', a musical group founded by Hubbard and made up entirely of shipbound members of the Sea Org, was offering free on-pier concerts in an attempt to promote Scientology, and the riot occurred at one of these events. Hubbard decided to relocate back to the United States to establish a "land base" for the Sea Org in [[Florida]].&lt;ref name="Miller-334"&gt;Miller, p. 334&lt;/ref&gt; The Church of Scientology attributes this decision to the activities on the ''Apollo'' having "outgrow[n] the ship's capacity".&lt;ref name="Chronicle1970-1979" /&gt;

In October 1975, Hubbard moved into a hotel suite in [[Daytona Beach, Florida|Daytona Beach]]. The [[Fort Harrison Hotel]] in [[Clearwater, Florida]], was secretly acquired as the location for the "land base".&lt;ref name="Miller-334" /&gt; On December 5, 1975, Hubbard and his wife Mary Sue moved into a condominium complex in nearby [[Dunedin, Florida|Dunedin]].&lt;ref name="Miller-336"&gt;Miller, p. 336&lt;/ref&gt; Their presence was meant to be a closely guarded secret but was accidentally compromised the following month.&lt;ref name="Miller-338"&gt;Miller, p. 338&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard immediately left Dunedin and moved to Georgetown, Washington, D.C., accompanied by a handful of aides and messengers, but not his wife.&lt;ref name="Miller-340"&gt;Miller, p. 340&lt;/ref&gt; Six months later, following another security alert in July 1976, Hubbard moved to another safe house in [[Culver City, California]]. He lived there for only about three months, relocating in October to the more private confines of the Olive Tree Ranch near [[La Quinta, California|La Quinta]].&lt;ref name="Miller-343"&gt;Miller, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; His second son Quentin committed suicide a few weeks later in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]].&lt;ref name="Miller-344"&gt;Miller, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sappell|first=Joel|title=The Mind Behind the Religion : Life With L.

Welkos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout this period, Hubbard was heavily involved in directing the activities of the Guardian's Office (GO), the legal bureau/intelligence agency that he had established in 1966. He believed that Scientology was being attacked by an international [[Nazi]] conspiracy, which he termed the "Tenyaka Memorial", through a network of drug companies, banks and psychiatrists in a bid to take over the world.&lt;ref&gt;Beresford, David (February 7, 1980). "Snow White's dirty tricks." London: ''The Guardian''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, he instigated the "[[Operation Snow White|Snow White Program]]" and directed the GO to remove negative reports about Scientology from government files and track down their sources.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, pp. 317–318&lt;/ref&gt; The GO was ordered to "get all false and secret files on Scientology, LRH &amp;nbsp;... that cannot be obtained legally, by all possible lines of approach&amp;nbsp;... i.e., job penetration, janitor penetration, suitable guises utilizing covers." His involvement in the GO's operations was concealed through the use of codenames. The GO carried out covert campaigns on his behalf such as [[List of Guardian's Office operations#Operation Bulldozer Leak|Operation Bulldozer Leak]], intended "to effectively spread the rumor that will lead Government, media, and individual &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Suppressive Person]]s&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; to conclude that LRH has no control of the C of S and no legal liability for Church activity". He was kept informed of GO operations, such as the theft of medical records from a hospital, harassment of psychiatrists and infiltrations of organizations that had been critical of Scientology at various times, such as the [[Better Business Bureau]], the [[American Medical Association]], and [[American Psychiatric Association]].&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, John (January 24, 1980). "The Scientology Papers: Hubbard still gave orders, records show." Toronto: ''Globe and Mail''&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the GO infiltrated and burglarized numerous government organizations, including the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] and the Internal Revenue Service.&lt;ref&gt;Streissguth, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; After two GO agents were caught in the Washington, D.C. headquarters of the IRS, the FBI carried out simultaneous raids on GO offices in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. on July 7, 1977. They retrieved [[wiretap]] equipment, burglary tools and some 90,000 pages of incriminating documents. Hubbard was not prosecuted, though he was labeled an "[[unindicted co-conspirator]]" by government prosecutors. His wife Mary Sue was indicted and subsequently convicted of [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]]. She was sent to a [[Federal Bureau of Prisons|federal prison]] along with ten other Scientologists.&lt;ref name="Reitman"&gt;Reitman (2007), p. 323&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard's troubles increased in February 1978 when a French court convicted him in absentia for obtaining money under false pretenses. He was sentenced to four years in prison and a 35,000[[French franc|FF]] ($7,000) fine, {{Inflation|US|7000|1978|fmt=eq}}.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, John (January 26, 1980). "The Scientology Papers: The hidden Hubbard." Toronto: ''Globe and Mail''&lt;/ref&gt; He went into hiding in April 1979, moving to an apartment in [[Hemet, California]], where his only contact with the outside world was via ten trusted Messengers. He cut contact with everyone else, even his wife, whom he saw for the last time in August 1979.&lt;ref name="Atack-258"&gt;Atack, p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard faced a possible indictment for his role in [[Operation Freakout]], the GO's campaign against New York journalist [[Paulette Cooper]], and in February 1980 he disappeared into deep cover in the company of two trusted Messengers, Pat and Anne Broeker.&lt;ref name="Atack-259"&gt;Atack, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller-364"&gt;Miller, p. 364&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first few years of the 1980s, Hubbard and the Broekers lived on the move, touring the Pacific Northwest in a [[recreational vehicle]] and living for a while in apartments in [[Newport Beach]] and Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="SW-Deep"&gt;Sappell, Joel; Welkos, Robert W. (June 24, 1990).

In Hubbard's absence, members of the Sea Org staged a takeover of the Church of Scientology and purged many veteran Scientologists. A young Messenger, [[David Miscavige]], became Scientology's ''de facto'' leader. Mary Sue Hubbard was forced to resign her position and her daughter Suzette became Miscavige's personal maid.&lt;ref name="Miller-366"&gt;Miller, p. 366&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
[[File:Church of Spiritual Technology ranch Creston.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Aerial photograph of an estate with a racetrack visible in the background|The ranch in San Luis Obispo County, California where Hubbard spent his final years]]
For the last two years of his life, Hubbard lived in a luxury [[Blue Bird Corporation|Blue Bird]] motorhome on Whispering Winds, a 160-acre ranch near [[Creston, California]]. He remained in deep hiding while controversy raged in the outside world about whether he was still alive and if so, where. He spent his time "writing and researching", according to a spokesperson, and pursued photography and music, overseeing construction work and checking on his animals.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Mark (January 30, 1986). "Creston provided quiet retreat for controversial church leader." ''The County Telegram-Tribune'', San Luis Obispo, pp. 1A/5A.&lt;/ref&gt; He repeatedly redesigned the property, spending millions of dollars remodeling the ranch house—which went virtually uninhabited—and building a quarter-mile [[horse-racing track]] with an [[observation tower]], which reportedly was never used.&lt;ref name="SW-Deep" /&gt;

He was still closely involved in managing the Church of Scientology via secretly delivered orders&lt;ref name="SW-Deep" /&gt; and continued to receive large amounts of money, of which ''Forbes'' magazine estimated "at least $200 million [was] gathered in Hubbard's name through 1982." In September 1985, the IRS notified the Church that it was considering indicting Hubbard for tax fraud.&lt;ref name="Behar"&gt;Behar, Richard (October 27, 1986). "The prophet and profits of Scientology." Forbes 400 (Forbes)&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard suffered further ill-health, including chronic [[pancreatitis]], during his residence at Whispering Winds. He suffered a  [[stroke]] on January 17, 1986, and died a week later.&lt;ref name="Reitman" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Church of Scientology.

Hubbard was survived by his wife Mary Sue and all of his children except his second son Quentin.

Every Church of Scientology maintains an office reserved for Hubbard, with a desk, chair and writing equipment, ready to be used.&lt;ref name="Reitman-324"&gt;Reitman (2007), p. 324&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lonnie D. Kliever]] notes that Hubbard was "the only source of the religion, and he has no successor". Hubbard is referred to simply as "Source" within Scientology and the theological acceptability of any Scientology-related activity is determined by how closely it adheres to Hubbard's doctrines.&lt;ref name="Rothstein-24"&gt;Rothstein, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard's name and signature are official trademarks of the [[Religious Technology Center]], established in 1982 to control and oversee the use of Hubbard's works and Scientology's trademarks and copyrights. The RTC is the central organization within Scientology's complex corporate hierarchy and has put much effort into re-checking the accuracy of all Scientology publications to "ensur[e] the availability of the pure unadulterated writings of Mr. Hubbard to the coming generations".&lt;ref name="Rothstein-24" /&gt;

The Danish historian of religions [[Mikael Rothstein]] describes Scientology as "a movement focused on the figure of Hubbard". He comments: "The fact that [Hubbard's] life is mythologized is as obvious as in the cases of [[Jesus]], [[Muhammad]] or [[Gautama Buddha|Siddartha Gotama]]. This is how religion works. Scientology, however, rejects this analysis altogether, and goes to great lengths to defend every detail of Hubbard's amazing and fantastic life as plain historical fact." Hubbard is presented as "the master of a multitude of disciplines" who performed extraordinary feats as a photographer, composer, scientist, therapist, explorer, navigator, philosopher, poet, artist, humanitarian, adventurer, soldier, scout, musician and many other fields of endeavor.&lt;ref name="Rothstein-21" /&gt; The Church of Scientology portrays Hubbard's life and work as having proceeded seamlessly, "as if they were a continuous set of predetermined events and discoveries that unfolded through his lifelong research" even up to and beyond his death.&lt;ref name="Bromley"&gt;Bromley, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Rothstein's assessment of Hubbard's legacy, Scientology consciously aims to transfer the [[charismatic authority]] of Hubbard to institutionalize his authority over the organization, even after his death. Hubbard is presented as a virtually superhuman religious ideal just as Scientology itself is presented as the most important development in human history.&lt;ref name="Rothstein-20"&gt;Rothstein, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; As Rothstein puts it, "reverence for Scientology's scripture is reverence for Hubbard, the man who in the Scientological perspective single-handedly brought salvation to all human beings."&lt;ref name="Rothstein-21" /&gt; [[David G. Bromley]] of the [[University of Virginia]] comments that the real Hubbard has been transformed into a "prophetic persona", "LRH", which acts as the basis for his prophetic authority within Scientology and transcends his biographical history.&lt;ref name="Bromley" /&gt; According to Dorthe Refslund Christensen, Hubbard's [[hagiography]] directly compares him with Buddha. Hubbard is viewed as having made Eastern traditions more accessible by approaching them with a scientific attitude. "Hubbard is seen as the ultimate-cross-cultural savior; he is thought to be able to release man from his miserable condition because he had the necessary background, and especially the right attitude."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Lewis |editor1-first=James R. |editor2-last=Petersen |editor2-first=Jasper Aagaard |last=Christensen |first= Dorthe Refslund| title=Controversial New Religions |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard, although increasingly deified after his death, is the model [[Operating Thetan]] to Scientologists and their founder, and not God. Hubbard then is the "Source", "inviting others to follow his path in ways comparable to a Bodhisattva figure" according to religious scholar Donald A. Westbrook. Scientologists refer to L. Ron Hubbard as "Ron", referring to him as a personal friend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Westbrook |first=Donald A. |title=Handbook of Scientology |chapter=Researching Scientology and Scientologists in the United States: Methods and Conclusions |series=Brill Handbooks on Contemporary Religion |editor1-last=Lewis |editor1-first=James R. |editor2-last=Hellesoy |editor2-first=Kjersti |publisher=Brill |year=2017 |isbn=9789004330542}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1970s two men began to assemble a picture of Hubbard's life. Michael Linn Shannon, a resident of Portland, Oregon, became interested in Hubbard's life story after an encounter with a Scientology recruiter. Over the next four years he collected previously undisclosed records and documents. He intended to write an exposé of Hubbard and sent a copy of his findings and key records to a number of contacts but was unable to find a publisher.&lt;ref name="Atack-46"&gt;Atack, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

Shannon's findings were acquired by [[Gerry Armstrong (activist)|Gerry Armstrong]], a Scientologist who had been appointed Hubbard's official archivist.&lt;ref name="Atack-46" /&gt; He had been given the job of assembling documents relating to Hubbard's life for the purpose of helping Omar V. Garrison, a non-Scientologist who had written two books sympathetic to Scientology, to write an official biography. However, the documents that he uncovered convinced both Armstrong and Garrison that Hubbard had systematically misrepresented his life. Garrison refused to write a "puff piece" and declared that he would not "repeat all the falsehoods they [the Church of Scientology] had perpetuated over the years". He wrote a "warts and all" biography while Armstrong quit Scientology, taking five boxes of papers with him. The Church of Scientology and Mary Sue Hubbard sued for the return of the documents while settling out of court with Garrison, requiring him to turn over the nearly completed manuscript of the biography.&lt;ref&gt;Shelor, George-Wayne. "Writer tells of Hubbard's 'faked past'." ''Clearwater Sun'', May 10, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1984 Judge Paul G. Breckenridge ruled in Armstrong's favor, saying:

{{quote|The evidence portrays a man who has been virtually a [[pathological liar]] when it comes to his history, background and achievements. The writings and documents in evidence additionally reflect his egoism, greed, avarice, lust for power, and vindictiveness and aggressiveness against persons perceived by him to be disloyal or hostile. At the same time it appears that he is charismatic and highly capable of motivating, organizing, controlling, manipulating and inspiring his adherents. He has been referred to during the trial as a "genius," a "revered person," a man who was "viewed by his followers in awe." Obviously, he is and has been a very complex person and that complexity is further reflected in his alter ego, the Church of Scientology.&lt;ref&gt;Breckenridge Jr., Paul G. (October 24, 1984). ''Memorandum of Intended Decision'', Church of Scientology of California vs. Gerald Armstrong. Quoted by Miller, pp. 370–71&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In November 1987, the British journalist and writer Russell Miller published ''[[Bare-faced Messiah]]'', the first full-length biography of L. Ron Hubbard. He drew on Armstrong's papers, official records and interviews with those who had known Hubbard including ex-Scientologists and family members. The book was well-received by reviewers but the Church of Scientology sought unsuccessfully to prohibit its publication on the grounds of copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;Murtagh, Peter (October 10, 1987). "Scientologists fail to suppress book about church's founder." ''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt; Other critical biographical accounts are found in Bent Corydon's ''[[L.

However, contemporary records show that his grandfather, Lafayette Waterbury, was a [[veterinarian]], not a rancher, and was not wealthy. Hubbard was actually raised in a townhouse in the center of Helena.&lt;ref name="Atack-48"&gt;Atack, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; According to his aunt, his family did not own a ranch but did own one cow and four or five horses on a few acres of land outside the city.&lt;ref name="SW-Creating"&gt;Sappell, Joel; Welkos, Robert (June 24, 1990).

According to Scientology biographies, during a journey to [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1923 Hubbard learned of [[Freudian psychology]] from [[Joseph Thompson (psychiatrist)|Commander Joseph "Snake" Thompson]], a U.S. Navy psychoanalyst and medic.&lt;ref name="Miller-23" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whitehead-46"&gt;Whitehead, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Scientology biographies describe this encounter as giving Hubbard training in a particular scientific approach to the mind, which he found unsatisfying.&lt;ref name="Christensen238"&gt;Christensen, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;  In his diary, Hubbard claimed he was the youngest Eagle Scout in the U.S.&lt;ref name="Miller-25"&gt;Miller, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientology texts present Hubbard's travels in Asia as a time when he was intensely curious for answers to human suffering and explored ancient Eastern philosophies for answers, but found them lacking.&lt;ref name="Christensen239"&gt;Christensen, pp. 239–240&lt;/ref&gt; He is described as traveling to China "at a time when few Westerners could enter"&lt;ref name="Battlefield"&gt;"About the Author," in Hubbard, L. Ron: ''Battlefield Earth''. (No page number given.) Los Angeles: Galaxy Press, 2005. {{ISBN|978-1-59212-007-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and according to Scientology, spent his time questioning Buddhist [[lama]]s and meeting old Chinese magicians.&lt;ref name=Christensen239 /&gt; According to church materials, his travels were funded by his "wealthy grandfather".&lt;ref&gt;"Appendix" in Hubbard, L. Ron: ''Hymn of Asia''. (No page number given.) Los Angeles : Church of Scientology of California, Publications Organization, 1974. {{ISBN|0-88404-035-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientology accounts say that Hubbard "made his way deep into Manchuria's Western Hills and beyond&amp;nbsp;— to break bread with Mongolian bandits, share campfires with Siberian shamans and befriend the last in the line of magicians from the court of [[Kublai Khan]]".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.lronhubbard.org/biography/early-years/asia-and-the-south-pacific.html L. Ron Hubbard Biographical Profile: Asia and the South Pacific]." Church of Scientology International, 2010, retrieved February 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hubbard did not record these events in his diary.&lt;ref name="Atack-57"&gt;Atack, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; He remained unimpressed with China and the Chinese, writing: "A Chinaman can not live up to a thing, he always drags it down." He characterized the sights of Beijing as "rubberneck stations" for tourists and described the palaces of the [[Forbidden City]] as "very trashy-looking" and "not worth mentioning". He was impressed by the [[Great Wall of China]] near Beijing,&lt;ref name="Miller-42"&gt;Miller, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; but concluded of the Chinese: "They smell of all the baths they didn't take. The trouble with China is, there are too many [[chink]]s here."&lt;ref name="Miller-43"&gt;Miller, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite not graduating from George Washington, Hubbard claimed  "to be not only a graduate engineer, but 'a member of the first United States course in formal education in what is called today nuclear physics.'"&lt;ref name="Malko-31" /&gt; However, a Church of Scientology biography describes him as "never noted for being in class" and says that he "thoroughly detest[ed] his subjects".&lt;ref name="Brief Biography"&gt;"A Brief Biography of L. Ron Hubbard," ''Ability'', Church of Scientology Washington, D.C.

Ron: ''Scientology: The Fundamentals of Thought'', p. vii. Los Angeles: Bridge Publications, 2007. {{ISBN|978-1-4031-4420-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hubbard himself stated that he "set out to find out from nuclear physics a knowledge of the physical universe, something entirely lacking in [[Asian philosophy]]".&lt;ref name="Brief Biography" /&gt; His university records indicate that his exposure to "nuclear physics" consisted of one class in "atomic and molecular phenomena" for which he earned an "F" grade.&lt;ref name="Streeter-206"&gt;Streeter, p. 206&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientologists claim he was more interested in extracurricular activities, particularly writing and flying. According to church materials, "he earned his wings as a pioneering [[barnstorming|barnstormer]] at the dawn of American aviation"&lt;ref name="Great Secret" /&gt; and was "recognized as one of the country's most outstanding pilots. With virtually no training time, he takes up powered flight and barnstorms throughout the Midwest."&lt;ref name="Chronicle1930-1940"&gt;[http://mediaresources.lronhubbard.org/chronicle/page02.htm L.

According to the Church of Scientology, Hubbard was "called to Hollywood" to work on film scripts in the mid-1930s, although Scientology accounts differ as to exactly when this was (whether 1935,&lt;ref name="Dianetics Today"&gt;"About the Author" in Hubbard, L. Ron: ''Dianetics Today'', p. 989. Los Angeles: Church of Scientology of California, 1975. {{ISBN|0-88404-036-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1936&lt;ref name="Brief Biography" /&gt; or 1937&lt;ref name="Chronicle1930-1940" /&gt;).  The Church of Scientology claims he also worked on the Columbia serials ''[[The Mysterious Pilot]]'' (1937), ''[[The Great Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok]]'' (1938) and ''[[The Spider Returns]]'' (1941),&lt;ref name="Chronicle1930-1940" /&gt; though his name does not appear on the credits. Hubbard also claimed to have written ''[[Dive Bomber (film)|Dive Bomber]]'' (1941),&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, L. Ron. "The Story of Dianetics and Scientology," lecture of October 18, 1958&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Atack-65"&gt;Atack, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cecil B.

Scientology accounts of the expedition to Alaska describe "Hubbard's recharting of an especially treacherous [[Inside Passage]], and his ethnological study of indigenous Aleuts and Haidas" and tell of how "along the way, he not only roped a [[Kodiak Bear]], but braved seventy-mile-an-hour winds and commensurate seas off the [[Aleutian Islands]]."&lt;ref name="Alaskan"&gt;"[http://www.lronhubbard.org/biography/adventures-explorations/alaskan-radio-experimental-expedition.html L. Ron Hubbard Biographical Profile&amp;nbsp;— Alaskan Radio-Experimental Expedition]" Church of Scientology International, 2010, retrieved February 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; They are divided about how far Hubbard's expedition actually traveled, whether {{convert|700|mi}}&lt;ref name="Chronicle1930-1940" /&gt; or {{convert|2000|mi}}.&lt;ref name="Alaskan" /&gt;

The Church disputes the official record of Hubbard's naval career. It asserts that the records are incomplete and perhaps falsified "to conceal Hubbard's secret activities as an intelligence officer".&lt;ref name="SW-Creating" /&gt; In 1990 the Church provided the ''Los Angeles Times'' with a document that was said to be a copy of Hubbard's official record of service. The U.S. Navy told the ''Times'' that "its contents are not supported by Hubbard's personnel record."&lt;ref name="SW-Creating" /&gt; ''[[The New Yorker]]'' reported in February 2011 that the Scientology document was considered by federal archivists to be a forgery.&lt;ref name="Wright" /&gt;

The Church of Scientology presents him as a "much-decorated war hero who commanded a [[corvette]] and during hostilities was crippled and wounded".&lt;ref name="Lamont-19"&gt;Lamont, pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt; Scientology publications say he served as a "[[Commodore (United States)|Commodore]] of Corvette squadrons" in "[[List of theaters and campaigns of World War II|all five theaters of World War II]]" and was awarded "twenty-one medals and palms" for his service.&lt;ref name="Rolph-16"&gt;Rolph, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; He was "severely wounded and was taken crippled and blinded" to a military hospital, where he "worked his way back to fitness, strength and full perception in less than two years, using only what he knew and could determine about Man and his relationship to the universe".&lt;ref name="Dianetics Today" /&gt; He said that he had seen combat repeatedly, telling [[A. E. van Vogt]] that he had once sailed his ship "right into the harbor of a Japanese occupied island in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. His attitude was that if you took your flag down the Japanese would not know one boat from another, so he tied up at the dock, went ashore and wandered around by himself for three days."&lt;ref name="Miller-141"&gt;Miller, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard's war service has great significance in the history and mythology of the Church of Scientology, as he is said to have cured himself through techniques that would later underpin Scientology and Dianetics. According to Moulton, Hubbard told him that he had been machine-gunned in the back near the Dutch East Indies. Hubbard asserted that his eyes had been damaged as well, either "by the flash of a large-caliber gun" or when he had "a bomb go off in my face".&lt;ref name="SW-Creating" /&gt; Scientology texts say that he returned from the war "[b]linded with injured optic nerves, and lame with physical injuries to hip and back" and was twice pronounced dead.&lt;ref name="Wright" /&gt; Hubbard's official Navy service records indicate that "his military performance was, at times, substandard" and he received only four campaign medals rather than the claimed twenty-one. He was never recorded as being injured or wounded in combat and never received a [[Purple Heart]].&lt;ref name="SW-Creating" /&gt;

The Church of Scientology says that Hubbard's key breakthrough in the development of Dianetics was made at [[Oak Knoll Naval Hospital]] in [[Oakland, California]]. According to the Church,

{{quote|In early 1945, while recovering from war injuries at [[Oak Knoll Naval Hospital]], Mr. Hubbard conducts a series of tests and experiments dealing with the endocrine system. He discovers that, contrary to long-standing beliefs, function monitors structure. With this revolutionary advance, he begins to apply his theories to the field of the mind and thereby to improve the conditions of others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediaresources.lronhubbard.org/chronicle/page03.htm L. Ron Hubbard: A Chronicle, 1941–1949]. Church of Scientology International, 2007, retrieved February 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Scientology accounts do not mention Hubbard's involvement in occultism. He is instead described as "continu[ing] to write to help support his research" during this period into "the development of a means to better the condition of man".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.lronhubbardprofile.org/profile/chron5.htm L. Ron Hubbard: A Chronicle, 1941–1949]." Church of Scientology International, retrieved February 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The Church of Scientology has nonetheless acknowledged Hubbard's involvement with the OTO; a 1969 statement, written by Hubbard himself,&lt;ref name="Atack-90"&gt;Atack, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; said:

{{quote|Hubbard broke up black magic in America&amp;nbsp;... L. Ron Hubbard was still an officer of the U.S. Navy, because he was well known as a writer and a philosopher and had friends amongst the physicists, he was sent in to handle the situation. He went to live at the house and investigated the black magic rites and the general situation and found them very bad&amp;nbsp;...

Hubbard's mission was successful far beyond anyone's expectations. The house was torn down. Hubbard rescued a girl they were using. The black magic group was dispersed and destroyed and has never recovered.&lt;ref&gt;"Scientology: New Light on Crowley." ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', December 28, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Church of Scientology says Hubbard was "sent in" by his fellow science fiction author [[Robert Heinlein]], "who was running off-book intelligence operations for naval intelligence at the time". However, Heinlein's authorized biographer has said that he looked into the matter at the suggestion of Scientologists but found nothing to corroborate claims that Heinlein had been involved, and his biography of Heinlein makes no mention of the matter.&lt;ref name="Wright"&gt;Wright, Lawrence (February 14, 2011)."[http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/02/14/110214fa_fact_wright?currentPage=all The Apostate: Paul Haggis vs. the Church of Scientology]." ''The New Yorker'', retrieved February 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church of Scientology says Hubbard quit the Navy because it "attempted to monopolize all his researches and force him to work on a project 'to make man more suggestible' and when he was unwilling, tried to blackmail him by ordering him back to active duty to perform this function. Having many friends he was able to instantly resign from the Navy and escape this trap."&lt;ref name="FIL67" /&gt; The Navy said in a statement in 1980: "There is no evidence on record of an attempt to recall him to active duty."&lt;ref name="sppulitzer"&gt;{{cite news | first1 = Charles L. |last1=Stafford | first2 = Bette |last2=Orsini | title = Church moves to defend itself against 'attackers | work = St. Petersburg Times | date = January 9, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Hubbard's death, [[Bridge Publications (Scientology)|Bridge Publications]] has published several stand-alone biographical accounts of his life. Marco Frenschkowski notes that "non-Scientologist readers immediately recognize some parts of Hubbard's life are here systematically left out: no information whatsoever is given about his private life (his marriages, divorces, children), his legal affairs and so on."&lt;ref name="Frenschkowski-2"&gt;Frenschkowski, Marco.

''Cults and new religions: a brief history'', p. 30. Oxford: Blackwell, 2008. {{ISBN|978-1-4051-6128-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[L. Ron Hubbard House]] in Washington, D.C.

In late 2012, Bridge published a comprehensive official biography of Hubbard, titled ''The L. Ron Hubbard Series: A Biographical Encyclopedia'', written primarily by Dan Sherman, the official Hubbard biographer at the time. This most recent official [[Church of Scientology]] biography of Hubbard is a 17 volume series, with each volume focusing on a different aspect of Hubbard's life, including his music, photography, geographic exploration, humanitarian work, and nautical career. It is advertised as a "Biographic Encyclopedia" and is primarily authored by the official biographer, Dan Sherman.&lt;ref name="lronhubbard.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lronhubbard.org/books/ron-series/biographical-encyclopedia.html|title=The L.

Greenwood Publishing Group, 2004. {{ISBN|978-0-313-32807-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his lifetime, a number of brief biographical sketches were also published in his Scientology books. The Church of Scientology issued "the only authorized LRH Biography" in October 1977 (it has since been followed by the Sherman "Biographic Encyclopedia").&lt;ref name="FIL67"&gt;Flag Information Letter 67, "L.R.H.

During his residence in [[London]], [[Isaac Newton]] had made the acquaintance of [[John Locke]]. Locke had taken a very great interest in the new theories of the ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]''. He was one of a number of Newton's friends who began to be uneasy and dissatisfied at seeing the most eminent scientific man of his age left to depend upon the meagre remuneration of a college fellowship and a professorship.

== Running the Royal Mint ==
For the last half of Newton's adult life, 30 years, he was [[Warden of the Mint|warden]] of the [[Royal Mint]] as well as Master of the Mint.

=== Appointment to the Mint ===
Newton got his appointment because of his renown as a scientist and because he supported the winning side in the [[Glorious Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Mint"&gt;{{cite episode |series=Science Friday |title=Isaac Newton: Physicist And ... Crime Fighter? |airdate=5 June 2009 |transcript=NPR Science Friday program transcript  |transcripturl=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=105012144 | url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=105012144 |network=NPR|quote=he...picked the right side in the Glorious Revolution}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Levenson| first = Thomas| title = Newton and the counterfeiter : the unknown detective career of the world's greatest scientist| date = 2009| publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt| isbn = 978-0-15-101278-7| oclc = 276340857 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At some time Locke  nearly succeeded in procuring Newton  an appointment as provost of [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]], [[Cambridge]], but the college had offered a successful resistance on the grounds that the appointment would be illegal; its statutes required that the [[provost (education)|provost]] should be in priest's orders. [[Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax|Charles Montagu]], afterwards [[Earl of Halifax]], was a fellow of Trinity and an intimate friend of Newton, and it was on his influence that Newton relied for promotion to some honourable and lucrative post. However, his hopes were spoiled by long delay. In one of his letters to Locke at the beginning of 1692, when Montagu, Lord Monmouth and Locke were exerting themselves to obtain some appointment for Newton, Newton wrote that he was "fully convinced that Montagu, upon an old grudge which he thought had been worn out, was false to him."

Newton was now 55 years old, and whilst those of his own standing at the university had been appointed to high posts in church or state, he still remained without any mark of national gratitude. Montagu, after being appointed [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in 1694 finally put this right; he had previously consulted Newton upon the subject of the recoinage, and took the opportunity to appoint Newton to the post of warden of the Royal Mint in 1696. In a letter to Newton announcing the news, Montagu writes: "I am very glad that at last I can give you a good proof of my friendship, and the esteem the king has of your merits. Mr Overton, the warden of the mint, is made one of the Commissioners of Customs, and the king has promised me to make Mr Newton warden of the mint. The office is the most proper for you. 'Tis the chief office in the mint: 'tis worth five or six hundred pounds per annum, and has not too much business to require more attendance than you can spare."

The letter  must have convinced Newton of the sincerity of Montagu's good intentions towards him; we find them living as friends on the most intimate terms until Halifax's death in 1715.

===Achievements and influence===
Although the post was intended to be a [[sinecure]], Newton took it seriously. By the time of his appointment the currency had been seriously weakened by an increase in [[Coin clipping|clipping]] and [[counterfeiting]] during the [[Nine Years' War]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.litencyc.com/php/stopics.php?rec=true&amp;UID=1304 The 1696 Recoinage (1696-1699)], Richard Kleer, University of Regina, The Literary Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; to the extent that it had been decided to recall and replace all [[Hammered coinage|hammered silver coinage]] in circulation.&lt;ref name="nandthec"&gt;{{cite book| last = Levenson| first = Thomas| title = Newton and the Counterfeiter| date = 2009| publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt| isbn = 978-0-15-101278-7| oclc = 276340857 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The exercise came close to disaster due to fraud and mismanagement,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/PSAS_2002/pdf/vol_129/129_861_886.pdf The Scottish Mint after the recoinage, 1709-1836], Athol L Murray, Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; but was salvaged by Newton's personal intervention.&lt;ref name=nandthec /&gt; Newton's chemical and mathematical knowledge proved of great use in carrying out this [[Great Recoinage of 1696]], a process that was completed in about two years. Newton was subsequently given the post of [[Master of the Mint]] in 1699, a post worth between £1,200 and £1,500 per annum.

Despite counterfeiting being considered [[High treason in the United Kingdom|high treason]], punishable by [[Hanged, drawn and quartered|hanging, drawing and quartering]], convicting even the most flagrant criminals could be extremely difficult. Undaunted, Newton conducted more than 100 cross-examinations of witnesses, informers, and suspects between June 1698 and Christmas 1699. He himself gathered much of the evidence he needed to successfully prosecute 28 coiners.

One of Newton's cases as the King's attorney was against [[William Chaloner]].&lt;ref name="White 1997, p 269"&gt;{{harvnb|White|1997|p=269}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chaloner's schemes included setting up phony conspiracies of Catholics and then turning in the hapless conspirators whom he had entrapped. Chaloner made himself rich enough to posture as a gentleman. Petitioning Parliament, Chaloner accused the Mint of providing tools to counterfeiters (a charge also made by others). He proposed that he be allowed to inspect the Mint's processes in order to improve them. He petitioned Parliament to adopt his plans for a coinage that could not be counterfeited, while at the same time striking false coins.{{sfn|Westfall|1994|p=229}} Newton put Chaloner on trial for counterfeiting and had him sent to Newgate Prison in September 1697. But Chaloner had friends in high places, who helped him secure an acquittal and his release.&lt;ref name="White 1997, p 269"/&gt; Newton put him on trial a second time with conclusive evidence. Chaloner was convicted of high treason and hanged, drawn and quartered on 23 March 1699 at [[Tyburn, London|Tyburn gallows]].{{sfn|Westfall| 1980|pp=571–5}}

Following the 1707 [[Acts of Union 1707|union]] between the [[Kingdom of England]] and the [[Kingdom of Scotland]], Newton used his experience from the English recoinage to direct the [[Scottish coinage|1707-1710 Scottish recoinage]], resulting in a [[Economic and monetary union|common currency]] for the new [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/PSAS_2002/pdf/vol_127/127_921_944.pdf Sir Isaac Newton and the Scottish recoinage, 1707-10], Athol L Murray, Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton also drew up a very extensive table of assays of foreign coins.

As a result of a report written by Newton on 21 September 1717 to the [[HM Treasury|Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pierre-marteau.com/editions/1701-25-mint-reports/report-1717-09-25.html On the Value of Gold and Silver in European Currencies and the Consequences on the World-wide Gold- and Silver-Trade], Sir Isaac Newton, 21 September 1717.&lt;/ref&gt; the bimetallic relationship between gold coins and silver coins was changed by
[[Royal proclamation]] on 22 December 1717, forbidding the exchange of gold guineas for more than 21 silver shillings.&lt;ref&gt;By The King, A Proclamation Declaring the Rates at which Gold shall be current in Payments [https://archive.org/details/numismaticser1v05royauoft reproduced in the numismatic chronicle and journal of the Royal Numismatic Society, Vol V., April 1842 - January 1843]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to differing valuations in other European countries this inadvertently resulted in a silver shortage as silver coins were used to pay for imports, while exports were paid for in gold, effectively moving Britain from the [[silver standard]] to its first [[gold standard]], rather than the [[Bimetallism|bimetallic standard]] implied by the proclamation.

Due to his income from the Mint Newton became very wealthy, although he lost a substantial sum in the collapse of the [[South Sea Company|South Sea Bubble]]. Newton's niece [[Catherine Conduitt]] reported that he "lost twenty thousand pounds. Of this, however, he never much liked to hear…"&lt;ref&gt;[[William Seward (anecdotist)|William Seward]], ''Anecdotes of Distinguished Men'', 1804&lt;/ref&gt; This was a fortune at the time (equivalent to about £{{formatprice|{{inflation|UK|20000|1720|r=-6}}}} in present-day terms{{inflation-fn|UK}}), but it is not clear whether it was a monetary loss or an [[opportunity cost]] loss.

Newton continued in his position at the Royal Mint until his death in 1727.

==Fluxions==
{{Main article|Fluxions}}
Up to the time of the publication of the ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' in 1687 the [[method of fluxions]] which had been invented by Newton, and had been of great assistance to him in his mathematical investigations, was still, except to Newton and his friends, a secret. One of the most important rules of the method forms the second lemma of the second book of the ''Principia''. Though this new and powerful method was of great help to Newton in his work, he did not exhibit it in the results. He was aware that the well known geometrical methods of the ancients would make his new creations seem less strange and uncouth to those not familiar with the new method. The Principia gives no information on the subject of the notation adopted in the new calculus, and it was not until 1693 that it was communicated to the scientific world in the second volume of [[John Wallis]]'s works.

Newton's admirers in the [[Netherlands]] informed Wallis that Newton's method of [[fluxion]]s passed there under the name of [[Gottfried Leibniz]]'s ''Calculus Differentials''. It was therefore thought necessary that an early opportunity should be taken of asserting Newton's claim to be the inventor of the method of fluxions, and this was why this method first appeared in Wallis's works. A further account was given in the first edition of Newton's ''Optics'' (1704).

To this work were added two treatises, entitled ''Accedunt tractatus duo ejusdem authoris de speciebus &amp; magnitudine figurarum curvilinearum'', the one bearing the title ''Introductio ad Quadratura Curvarum'', and the other ''Enumeratio linearum tertii ordinis''. The first contains an explanation of the doctrine of fluxions, and of its application to the quadrature of curves; the second, a classification of 72 curves of the third order, with an account of their properties.

The reason for publishing these two tracts in his ''Optics'', from the subsequent editions of which they were omitted, is thus stated in the advertisement: "In a letter written to Leibniz in the year 1679, and published by Dr Wallis, I mentioned a method by which I had found some general theorems about squaring curvilinear figures on comparing them with the conic sections, or other the simplest figures with which they might be compared. And some years ago I lent out a manuscript containing such theorems; and having since met with some things copied out of it, I have on this occasion made it public, prefixing to it an introduction, and joining a Scholium concerning that method. And I have joined with it another small tract concerning the curvilinear figures of the second kind, which was also written many years ago, and made known to some friends, who have solicited the, making it public."

In 1707 [[William Whiston]] published the algebra lectures which Newton had delivered at Cambridge, under the title of ''Arithmetica Universalis, sive de Compositione et Resolutione Arithmetica Liber''. We are not accurately informed how Whiston obtained possession of this work, but it is stated by one of the editors of the English edition "that Mr Whiston, thinking it a pity that so noble and useful a work should be doomed to a college confinement, obtained leave to make it public." It was soon afterwards translated into English by Raphson; and a second edition of it, with improvements by the author, was published at London in 1712, by Dr Machin, secretary to the Royal Society. With the view of stimulating mathematicians to write annotations on this admirable work, [[Willem Jacob 's Gravesande|'s Gravesande]] published a tract, entitled ''Specimen Commentarii in Arithmetican Universalem''; and [[Colin Maclaurin|Maclaurin]]'s ''Algebra'' seems to have been drawn up in consequence of this appeal.

==Bernoulli's mathematical challenge==
Newton's solution of the celebrated problems proposed by [[Johann Bernoulli]] and Leibniz deserves mention among his mathematical works. In June 1696 Bernoulli addressed a letter to the mathematicians of Europe challenging them to solve two problems:
# to determine the [[brachistochrone curve]] between two given points not in the same vertical line
# to determine a curve such that, if a straight line drawn through a fixed point A meet it in two points P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, then m&lt;sub&gt;'''AP&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;/sub&gt; + m&lt;sub&gt;'''AP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;/sub&gt;  will be constant. 
This challenge was first made in the ''Ada Lipsiensia'' for June 1696.

Six months were allowed by Bernoulli for the solution of the problem, and in the event of none being sent to him he promised to publish his own. The six months elapsed without any solution being produced; but he received a letter from Leibniz, stating that he had "cut the knot of the most beautiful of these problems", and requesting that the period for their solution should be extended to Christmas next; that the French and Italian mathematicians might have no reason to complain of the shortness of the period. Bernoulli adopted the suggestion, and publicly announced the postponement for the information of those who might not see the ''Ada Lipsiensia''.

On 29 January 1697 Newton returned at 4pm from working at the [[Royal Mint]] and found in his post the problems that Bernoulli had sent to him directly; two copies of the printed paper containing the problems.  Newton stayed up to 4am before arriving at the solutions; on the following day he sent a solution of them to Montague, then president of the Royal Society for anonymous publication. He announced that the curve required in the first problem must be a [[cycloid]], and he gave a method of determining it. He also solved the second problem, and in so doing showed that by the same method other curves might be found which cut off three or more segments having similar properties. Solutions were also obtained from Leibniz and the [[Guillaume de l'Hôpital|Marquis de l'Hôpital]]; and, although Newton's solution was anonymous, he was recognized by Bernoulli as its author; "''tanquam ex ungue leonem''" (we recognize the lion by his claw).

In 1699 Newton's position as a mathematician and natural philosopher was recognized by the [[French Academy of Sciences]]. In that year the Academy was remodelled, and eight foreign associates were created. Leibniz, [[Domenico Guglielmini]] (1655—1710), [[Nicolaas Hartsoeker|Hartsoeker]], and  [[Ehrenfried Walter von Tschirnhaus|E. W. Tschirnhaus]] were appointed on 4 February, [[James Bernoulli]] and [[John Bernoulli]] on 14 February, and Newton and [[Ole Rømer]] on 21 February.

==End of professorship and presidency of the Royal Society==

While Newton held the office of warden of the mint, he retained his chair of mathematics at Cambridge and discharged the duties of the post, but shortly after he was promoted to be master of the mint he appointed Whiston his deputy with "the full profits of the place." Whiston began his [[astronomy|astronomical]] lectures as Newton's deputy in January 1701. On 10 December 1701 Newton resigned his professorship, thereby at the same time resigning his fellowship at Trinity, which he had held with the Lucasian professorship since 1675 by virtue of the royal mandate. Whiston's claims to succeed Newton in the Lucasian chair were successfully supported by Newton himself.

On 11 November 1701 Newton was again elected one of the representatives of the University of parliament, but he retained his seat only until the dissolution in the following July. Newton does not seem to have been a candidate at this election, but at the next dissolution in 1705 he stood for the university. He was warmly supported by the residents, but being a [[British Whig Party|Whig]], he was opposed by the non-residents, and beaten by a large majority.

In the autumn of 1703 Lord Somers retired from the presidency of the Royal Society, and on 30 November 1703 Newton was elected to succeed him. Newton was annually re-elected to this honourable post for the remainder of his life. He held the office for 25 years, the longest term of office for any Royal Society president since except Sir [[Joseph Banks]] (at the time of writing, 2002). As president Newton was brought into close association with [[Prince George of Denmark]], the queen's husband, who had been elected a fellow of the Royal Society. The prince had offered, on Newton's recommendation, to cover the expense of printing [[Flamsteed]]'s ''Observations''—especially his catalogue of the stars. It was natural that the queen should form a high opinion of one whose merits had made such a deep impression on her husband. In April 1705, when the queen, the prince and the court were staying at the royal residence at [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]], they paid a visit to Cambridge, where they were guests of [[Richard Bentley]], Master of [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]]. Her Majesty went in state to the Regent House, where a congregation of the Senate was held, and a number of honorary degrees conferred. Afterwards, the queen held a court at Trinity Lodge, where (16 April 1705) she conferred the order of knighthood upon Sir Isaac Newton.

==Second edition of the ''Principia''==

As soon as the first edition of the ''Principia'' was published Newton began to prepare for a second. He was anxious to improve the work by additions to the theory of the motion of the moon and the planets. Dr Edleston, in his preface to Newton's correspondence with Cotes, justly remarks: "If Flamsteed the Astronomer-Royal had cordially co-operated with him in the humble capacity of an observer in the way that Newton pointed out and requested Of him... the lunar theory would, if its creator did not overrate his own powers, have been completely investigated, so far as he could do it, in the first few months of 1695, and a second edition of the ''Principia'' would probably have followed the execution of the task at no long interval."

Newton, however, could not get the information he wanted from Flamsteed, and after the spring of 1696 his time was occupied by his duties at the mint. Rumours, however, of his work, and of a new edition, were heard from time to time. In February 1700 Leibniz writes of Newton, "J'ai appris aussi (je ne sais où) qu'il donnera encore quelque chose sur le mouvement de la Lune: et on m'a dit aussi qu'il y aura une nouvelle édition de ses principes de la nature." (I have learnt - I forget from where - that he will give further details on the movements of the Moon: and I've also been told that there will be a new edition of his ''Principia'').

Dr Bentley, the master of Trinity College, had for a long time urged Newton to give his consent to the republication of the ''Principia''. In 1708 Newton's consent was obtained, but it was not till the spring of 1709 that he was prevailed upon to entrust the superintendence of it to a young mathematician of great promise, [[Roger Cotes]], fellow of Trinity College, who had been recently appointed the first [[Plumian Professor of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy]]. On 21 May 1709, after speaking to Newton, Bentley announced this arrangement to Cotes: "Sir Isaac Newton," he said, "will be glad to see you in June, and then put into your hands one part of his book corrected for the press." About the middle of July Cotes went to London, no doubt expecting to bring down with him to Cambridge the corrected portion of the ''Principia''. Although Cotes was impatient to begin his work, it was nearly the end of September before the corrected copy was given to him.

During the printing of this edition a correspondence went on continuously between Newton and Cotes. On 31 March 1713, when the edition was nearly ready for publication, Newton wrote to Cotes: "I hear that Mr Bernoulli has sent a paper of 40 pages to be published in the ''Ada Leipsica'' relating to what I have written upon the curve lines described by projectiles in resisting media. And therein he partly makes observations upon what I have written &amp; partly improves it. To prevent being blamed by him or others for any disingenuity in not acknowledging my oversights or slips in the first edition, I believe it will not be amiss to print next after the old ''Praefatio ad Lectorem'', the following account of this new Edition.
"In hac secunda Principiorum Editione, multa sparsim emendantur &amp; nonnulla adjiciuntur. In Libri primi Sect. ii Inventio viriuni quibus corpora in Orbibus datis revolvi possint, facilior redditur et amplior. In Libri secundi Sect. vii. Theoria resistentiac fluidorum accuratius investigatur &amp; novis experimentis confirmatur. In Libro tertio Theoria Lunae &amp; Praecessio Aequinoctiorum ex Principiis suis plenius deducuntur, et Theoria Cometarum pluribus et accuratius computatis Orbium exemplis confirmatur.
"28 Mar 1713. I. N.
"If you write any further preface, I must not see it, for I find that I shall be examined about it. The cuts for ye Comet of 1680 &amp; 1681 are printed off and will be sent to Dr Bently this week by the Carrier."

Newton's desire to avoid writing the preface seems to have come from a knowledge that Cotes was considering alluding to the dispute about the invention of fluxions. At last, about midsummer 1713, was published the long and impatiently expected second edition of the ''Principia'', and; on 27 July, Newton waited on [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], to present her with a copy of the new edition.

==The longitude problem==

In 1714 the question of finding the [[longitude]] at sea, which had been looked upon as an important one for several years, was brought into prominence by a petition presented to the House of Commons by a number of captains of Her Majesty's ships and merchant ships and of London merchants. The petition was referred to a committee of the House, who called witnesses. Newton appeared before them and gave evidence. He stated that for determining the longitude at sea there had been several projects, true in theory but difficult to execute. He mentioned four:

# by a watch to keep time exactly
# by the eclipses of Jupiter's moons
# by the place of the moon
# by a new method proposed by Mr [[Humphry Ditton|Ditton]].

Newton criticized all the methods, pointing out their weak points, and it is due mainly to his evidence that the Committee brought in the report which was accepted by the House, and shortly afterwards was converted into a Bill, passed both Houses, and received the royal assent. The report ran "that it is the opinion of this committee that a reward be settled by Parliament upon such person or persons as shall discover a more certain and practicable method of ascertaining the longitude than any yet in practice; and the said reward be proportioned to the degree of exactness to which the said method shall reach." Newton was in charge of the [[Board of Longitude]], and it never gave a prize, but it did give some advance funds to the mathematician [[Leonhard Euler]] and some others for work on accurate lunar tables, and these did more or less solve the longitude problem. Some argue that [[John Harrison]], a developer of clocks, should have received the main prize, but in defense of Newton's decision not to award it, Harrison's work had no effect on maritime navigation. He made a total of four clocks, and at most one of these ever went to sea.

Newton was a very popular visitor at the Court of [[George I of Great Britain|George I]]. The Princess of Wales, [[Caroline of Ansbach]], wife of [[George II of Great Britain|George II]], took every opportunity of conversing with him. Having one day been told by Sir Isaac that he had composed a new system of chronology while he was still resident at Cambridge, she requested him to give her a copy. He accordingly drew up an abstract of the system from his papers, and sent it to the Princess for her own private use; but he afterwards allowed a copy to be made for the Abbé Conti on the express understanding that it should not be communicated to any other person. The abbé, however, lent his copy to M Fréret, an antiquary at Paris, who translated it, and endeavoured to refute it. The translation was printed under the title ''Abrege de chronologie de M le Chevallier Newton, fait par lui-même et traduit sur le manuscrit anglais''.

Upon receiving a copy of this work, Newton printed, in the ''Philosophical Transactions'' for 1725, a paper entitled "Remarks on the observations made on a Chronological Index of Sir Isaac Newton, translated into French by the observator, and published at Paris." Newton charged the Abbé with a breach of promise, and answered the objections which Fréret had urged against his system. Father [[Étienne Souciet]] entered the field in defence of Fréret; and in consequence of this controversy Newton was induced to prepare his larger work, which was published in 1728, after his death, and entitled ''[[The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended]]''.

==Theological studies==

From an early period in life Newton paid great attention to [[theology|theological]] studies, beginning his studies before 1690. That Newton was even then a powerful thinker was proved by his ability to attack the most difficult mathematical problems with success. For example, in 1716 [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], in a letter to the [[Abbe Conti]], proposed a problem for solution "for the purpose of feeling the pulse of the English analysts". The problem was to find the [[orthogonal]] [[trajectory|trajectories]] of a series of curves represented by a single equation. Newton received the problem at about 17:00 as he was returning from the mint, and though he was fatigued from work, he solved it later the same evening.

One of the most remarkable of Newton's theological works is his ''[[Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of the Scriptures]]'', included in a letter to [[John Locke]] in November 1690. Sir Isaac was anxious for its publication but because his argument deprived the [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarians]] of two passages in favour of the [[Trinity]], he became alarmed at the possible consequences. He therefore asked Locke, who was on the way to the continent, to have it translated into French and have it published there. Locke copied the manuscript and sent it to [[Jean Leclerc (theologian)|Jean Leclerc]] on 11 April 1691. On 20 January 1692 Leclerc announced his intention of publishing it in Latin. Upon hearing this Newton responded "to stop the translation and publication as soon as he could.. to suppress it". This was done, but Leclerc sent the manuscript to the library of the [[Remonstrant]]s, and it was later published in London in 1754 under the title ''Two Letters from Isaac Newton to M le Clerc''. This edition had many errors. Dr Horsley therefore published a genuine one, which is in the form of a single letter to a friend, and was taken from a manuscript in Sir Isaac's own hand.

Sir Isaac Newton also wrote ''Observation on the Prophecies of Daniel and the Apocalypse of St. John'' which was published in London in 1733. Another work ''Lexicon Propheticum'' published in 1737 was a dissertation on the sacred [[cubit]] of the Jews. He wrote four letters to Bentley containing arguments for existence of a deity which were published by Cumberland, a nephew of Bentley, in 1756. Newton also wrote a ''Church History'' and a ''History of Creation, Paradoxical Questions regarding Athanasius''.

==Alchemy==

Newton devoted much of his time to the study of chemistry, a great number of his experiments still remain in manuscript. His ''Tabula Quantilatum et Graduum Caloris'' contains a comparative scale of temperature from that of melting ice to that of a small kitchen fire. He wrote another chemical paper ''De Natura Acidorum''. Sir Isaac spent much time in the study of the alchemists including [[Jacob Boehme]]. In an earlier part of his life, Newton and a relation Dr Newton of Grantham had put up furnaces and had wrought for several months in quest of the philosophers tincture. Sir Isaac also studied the manuscripts of Flamsteed's ''Explication of Hieroglyphic Figures'' and [[William Yworth]]'s ''Processus Mysterii Magnii Magni Philosophicus''. Scientists have discovered that before Isaac died he burned important papers in his fireplace and they think it might have been an important discovery he made while doing alchemy.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

In January 1725 he was seized with violent cough and inflammation of the lungs which induced him to move to [[Kensington]]. In the next month he had a case of [[gout]] and then had an improvement of health. His duties from the mint were terminated and thus he seldom left home. On 28 February 1727 he went to London to preside at a meeting of the [[Royal Society]] but his health condition forced him to return to Kensington on 4 March when it was determined he had a [[gallstone]]. He endured great suffering. On 18 March he became delirious around 6pm and stayed in that state until Monday 20 March 1727 when he died between one and two in the morning. His body was taken to London and on Tuesday, 28 March it lay in state in the [[Westminster Abbey (Jerusalem Chamber)|Jerusalem Chamber]] in [[Westminster Abbey]], and then was moved to his burial location in the Abbey. ''(Note: the date of Newton's death is 20 March 1726/27 in the "Old Style" Julian calendar and 31 March 1727 in the "[[New Style]]" Gregorian calendar).'' [[Voltaire]] was present at his funeral and praised the British for honoring a scientist of [[heretical]] religious beliefs with burial there.

His considerable liquid estate was divided equally between his eight half-nieces and half-nephews — three Pilkingtons, three Smiths and two Bartons (including Catherine Barton Conduitt).&lt;ref name="Westfall 1980, p. 870"&gt;Westfall 1980, p. 870&lt;/ref&gt; Woolsthorpe Manor passed to his heir-in-law, a John Newton ("God knows a poor representative of so great a man"), who, after six years of "cock[fight]ing, horse racing, drinking and folly" was forced to mortgage and then sell the manor before dying in a drunken accident.&lt;ref name="Westfall 1980, p. 870"/&gt;

'''Laura D. Fair''' (1837–1919) was an American murderer whose death sentence was overturned.

== Early life ==
Laura Fair was born in [[Holly Springs, Mississippi|Holly Springs]], [[Mississippi]] in 1837. She married her first husband, an alcohol dealer from [[New Orleans]], in 1853 at 16 years old. He died in 1854 and she started school at the Convent of Visitation to become a teacher. Fair left school in a year to re-marry but shortly abandoned him to join her mother operating a boarding house in [[San Francisco]]. Fair met her third husband, Attorney William D. Fair after moving to [[Shasta, California|Shasta]], [[California]]. Three years later, the couple separated and Fair committed suicide leaving Laura to support herself, young daughter, and mother.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QrNvJpE0Q3YC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22laura+fair%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi9-PjM5OzPAhUJ0IMKHb4YBVw4ChDoAQgbMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22laura%20fair%22&amp;f=false|title=Gold Diggers &amp; Silver Miners: Prostitution and Social Life on the Comstock Lode|last=Goldman|first=Marion S.|date=1981-01-01|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=0472063324|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Murder and trial ==
In September 1862, Fair opened the Tahoe House in [[Virginia City, Nevada|Virginia City]], [[Nevada]] on South C Street.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1863, Fair started a relationship with married lawyer [[Alexander P. Crittenden|Alexander Parker Crittenden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://origins.osu.edu/review/woman-scorned|title=A Woman Scorned? {{!}} Origins: Current Events in Historical Perspective|website=origins.osu.edu|access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, he said he was single. Fair eventually learned the truth, and Crittenden promised her he would divorce his wife, Clara Churchill Jones.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/clementsmss/umich-wcl-M-2113cri?view=text|title=Crittenden family papers  1837-1907|website=quod.lib.umich.edu|access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1870, Clara took a transcontinental train to the East Coast and back with her two youngest children. Fair learned that Crittenden was to meet his wife in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] and aboard a ferry back to San Francisco. On November 3, 1870, Fair caught the same ferry and shot Crittenden in the heart.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/crime/article/The-case-of-Laura-Fair-San-Francisco-1870-5585715.php|title=The case of Laura Fair, San Francisco 1870|newspaper=SFGate|access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/clementsmss/umich-wcl-M-2113cri?view=text|title=Crittenden family papers  1837-1907|website=quod.lib.umich.edu|access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1871, Fair faced her first murder trial where she claimed that the shooting was the result of temporary insanity caused by a severely painful menstrual cycle. The prosecution painted her as a fallen woman who lured Crittenden into bed and warned the jury that they had a moral obligation. While in jail, [[Susan B. Anthony]] and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] visited Fair to support her. The jury found Fair guilty of murder, and she was sentenced to hang on July 28, 1871.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uncpress.unc.edu/browse/book_detail?title_id=3433|title=UNC Press - The Trials of Laura Fair|last=Hill|first=Copyright 2016 The University of North Carolina at Chapel|website=www.uncpress.unc.edu|access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fair’s case was appealed with the support of suffragettes, including [[Emily Pitts Stevens]], founder of the California Woman Suffrage Association.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The conviction was overturned on the grounds of prejudice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The press, having supported the initial conviction, were decidedly upset, calling the acquittal a "shameful miscarriage of justice."{{sfn|Public Opinion|1872|p=522}}

== Death ==
Fair died in 1919, at the age of 82, in San Francisco. Her body was buried in an unmarked grave.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Leonida Georgievna Romanova, Grand Duchess of Russia''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Леонида Георгиевна Романова; ''née'' '''Princess Leonida Georgievna Bagration-Mukhraneli''' ([[Georgian language|Georgian]]: ლეონიდა გიორგის ასული ბაგრატიონი-მუხრანელი); {{OldStyleDate|6 October|1914|23 September}} – 23 May 2010) was the consort of [[Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich of Russia|Vladimir Kirillovich, Grand Duke of Russia]], a [[Line of succession to the former Russian throne|pretender to the Russian throne]]. She was an active and outspoken advocate of the claims advanced by Vladimir and their daughter, [[Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna of Russia|Maria Vladimirovna]], to be accepted as the legitimate Heads of the [[Romanov]] dynasty and ''[[de jure]]'' sovereigns of the [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/last-romanov-born-in-russian-empire-dead-at-95/406706.html] "Last Romanov Born In Russian Empire Dead At 95," The Moscow Times, 25 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Born on 6 October 1914, in [[Tiflis]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Russian Empire]] as Princess Leonida [[House of Mukhrani|Bagration of Mukhrani]], she was a daughter of Prince [[George Bagration of Mukhrani]] and his [[Poles|Polish]] wife Helena Sigismundovna, ''née'' Nowina Złotnicka (1886–1979).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalark.net/Georgia/mukhran4.htm Royal Ark]&lt;/ref&gt; She descended [[patrilineality|patrilineally]] from former Kings of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}.

"[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article7149792.ece Leonida Georgievna Romanov]", 15 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; although one of Leonida's two lines of descent from Georgia's penultimate king [[Erekle II]] (Heraclius II) is through her mother, a descendant of the king's daughter, Princess Anastasia, who married an [[Eristavi#Eristavi families|Eristavi]] prince{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}. The other ancestral line derives through the marriage of another of the king's daughters, Princess Tamara, to [[House of Mukhrani#Princes of Mukhrani (1512-1801)|Ioane Bagrationi, 18th Prince of Mukhrani]]{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}.

The [[Bagrationi dynasty|Bagration]] family's genealogy traces back at least to the [[medieval era]] in [[David Soslan#Consort of Georgia|its male line]] and hundreds of years further back as rulers in the [[Tamar of Georgia#Genealogy|female line]].&lt;ref&gt;Eastmond, Antony (1998), ''Royal Imagery in Medieval Georgia'', pp. 135-7. Penn State Press, {{ISBN|0271016280}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Leonida's grandfather, Prince [[Alexander Bagration of Mukhrani]], was born in 1853 in Georgia's historical capital [[Tbilisi]], then part of the [[Russian Empire]], and was killed by [[Bolshevik]]s at [[Pyatigorsk]] in 1918 during the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian revolution]].&lt;ref name="times" /&gt; Fearing for their lives, the family took refuge in [[Constantinople]], then spent eight months in Germany before returning to Tbilisi, now capital of the [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic]], to re-claim a portion of property which, as ''[[émigré]]s'' they risked losing to total [[confiscation]].&lt;ref name="times" /&gt; Although the family made repairs to their home and Leonida would recall her grandfather's insistence that they continue to dine formally on silver plate to retain their sense of propriety, they were eventually deprived of all but two rooms of their old palace and subjected to harassment.&lt;ref name="times" /&gt;&lt;ref name="teleg"&gt;''The [[The Daily Telegraph#Website|Telegraph.co.uk]]'', London.

==First marriage==
In France, Princess Leonida met Sumner Moore Kirby (1895–1945), a wealthy "[[Pennsylvania Dutch Country|Pennsylvanian Protestant]]".&lt;ref name="times" /&gt; They were married in [[Nice]], France, on 6 November 1934. Sumner Moore Kirby had been born in [[Wilkes Barre]], Pennsylvania, the younger of two sons of Fred Morgan Kirby, a millionaire and business partner of one of the [[F. W. Woolworth Company]] heirs ([[Charles Sumner Woolworth]]) and his wife Jessie Amelie Owen. Leonida was his third wife, he having been married from 1925 to 1931 to Doris Landy Wayland, with whom he had a daughter, Gloria Price Kirby (born 1928). Kirby's second marriage, to Valentine Wagner, lasted from 20 January 1932 to 19 July 1934. Valentine Wagner's mother was born Princess Elisabeth Bagration, a member of the same family as Princess Leonida. Her father was Conrad Wagner. Kirby had no children of this marriage which, like his first and third marriages, was contracted civilly in Nice and dissolved there. Leonida and Sumner Kirby had one daughter, Helen Louise Kirby, born in [[Geneva]], Switzerland, on 26 January 1935. Their marriage was short-lived, they divorced after three years on 18 November 1937. Kirby died in a hospital at Leau, near the [[Buchenwald Concentration Camp]] to which he had been deported from France after being arrested along with other U.S. and British civilians by the [[Vichy regime]] in 1944.

As war intensified, Leonida and her daughter relocated to officially neutral [[Spain]]. In 1944, Leonida's brother, [[Irakli Bagration of Mukhrani|Prince Irakli]], also moved to Spain.

==Second marriage==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Leonida and Maria in 1960's.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Leonida with her daughter Maria in the 1960s.]] --&gt;
According to her published memoirs, Leonida first met Vladimir Kirillovich at a restaurant in France during World War II. But they did not see each other again for a few years, when both were making extended visits to [[Sanlúcar de Barrameda]], Spain, where their hosts happened to be neighbors. Vladimir was staying with his aunt, the [[Princess Beatrice of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Infanta Beatrice de Orleans]], first cousin of the murdered [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Tsarina Alexandra]].

On 13 August 1948 Princess Leonida wed for the second time, marrying Vladimir Kirillovich Romanov, who used the pre-revolutionary Russian title [[Grand Duke]], the style ''[[Imperial Highness]]'' and claimed to be, from 1938 to his death, Head of the Russian Imperial House&lt;ref name=webpage1&gt;[http://www.imperialhouse.ru/eng/dynastyhistory/dinzak3/1115.htmlAn Announcement by the Office of the Head of the Russian Imperial House] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725135945/http://www.imperialhouse.ru/eng/dynastyhistory/dinzak3/1115.htmlAn |date=25 July 2011 }}.

In 1783, the [[Treaty of Georgievsk]] was signed through which the Kingdom of Georgia, while retaining its autonomy and its ancient monarchy was placed under the protection of the Russian Empire. In 1801 after the death of [[George XII of Georgia|George XII]], the last King of Georgia, Tsar [[Alexander I of Russia]] in violation of the treaty, annexed the kingdom of Georgia and the Bagration dynasty lost its throne. The Bagrations became a leading family of the Russian nobility, serving in the Tsar's army and at court in [[Saint Petersburg]]. The former ruling branch became extinct in the late 19th century {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}, when it passed its succession rights to the branch to which Grand Duchess Leonida belonged{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}, but this too is disputed. [[Joseph Stalin]]'s mother had been a laundress in the house of the Bagrations.

As his [[queen consort|consort]] she used the title Grand Duchess Leonida Georgievna. By him, she had another daughter, [[Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna of Russia|Maria Vladimirovna]], who claims to have succeeded her father upon his death in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imperialhouse.ru/eng/imperialhouse/chipdom/maria.html Website of Grand Duchess Maria] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004200455/http://www.imperialhouse.ru/eng/imperialhouse/chipdom/maria.html |date=4 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, Leonida's brother, [[Irakli Bagration of Mukhrani|Prince Irakly]], married King [[Alfonso XIII]]'s niece, [[Prince Ferdinand of Bavaria|Princess Doña María de las Mercedes de Baviera y Borbon]] (1911–1953), obtaining Vladimir's recommendation that the Spanish pretender, [[Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona|Don Juan, Count of Barcelona]], accept the marriage as [[dynasty#Dynasts|dynastic]], which he did not. The Count of Barcelona, then Head of the Royal House of Spain, considered the issue of this marriage to be disqualified from the Spanish succession. The only son of this marriage was sponsored at his baptism by the Count of Barcelona but the latter's refusal to recognize his god-son as a Spanish dynast led to the Bagrations' alienation from the Spanish Royal Family according to [[Guy Stair Sainty]]. In 1948 Vladimir, relying on his own earlier advice on the Bagrations' historically royal status,&lt;ref name=webpage3&gt;[http://www.imperialhouse.ru/eng/dynastyhistory/dinzak3/1117.html 1946 Decree of the Head of the Russian Imperial House] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419142442/http://www.imperialhouse.ru/eng/dynastyhistory/dinzak3/1117.html |date=19 April 2014 }}. Retrieved 19 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; chose to wed Leonida ''dynastically'' in [[Lausanne]], Switzerland.

==Controversy==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Leonida and Grand Duke Vladimir.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Princess Leonida with her husband, Grand Duke Vladimir of Russia.]] --&gt;
The Grand Duke's marriage to Leonida Bagration remained controversial; some considered it to be [[morganatic marriage|morganatic]]. Although the princess descended from the [[Bagrationi dynasty]] which had ruled as kings of Georgia since the early Middle Ages, it had been [[deposition (law)|deposed]] and reduced to the status of Russian nobility for more than a century prior to the Russian Revolution in 1917. Leonida belonged to the senior surviving branch of that family {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}, but the last Georgian king from whom she descended in the male line was [[Constantine II of Georgia|Constantine II]] who died in 1505,&lt;ref&gt;[[Cyril Toumanoff]], "The Fifteenth-Century Bagratides and the Institution of Collegial Sovereignty in Georgia". Traditio. Volume VII, Fordham University Press, New York 1949–1951, pp. 169–221.&lt;/ref&gt; although other branches of the family continued to reign in the [[Caucasus]] as late as 1810. Besides, according to the Almanach de Gotha, as per the decision of Emperor Nicholas II made in 1911, the Princess Tatiana Constantinovna of Russia had morganatically wed Prince Konstantin Alexandrovich Bagration-Mukhransky, a member of the [[House of Mukhrani|same branch]] of the House of Bagration into which Princess Leonida would later be born. Because the [[Russian Empire]] did not accord royal rank to the Bagrations at the time of the Russian Revolution, most Romanov [[dynasty#Dynasts|dynasts]] in exile maintained that Leonida's daughter, Maria Vladimirovna, could not succeed to her father's claim to the Russian throne.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Claimant's consort==
Leonida accompanied her husband when he made his only visit to Russia in November 1991, following the implosion of the [[Soviet Union]]. She was also at Vladimir's side the following year when he collapsed and died following delivery of a speech in [[Florida]].

She visited her own ancestral land with her nephew [[Jorge de Bagration|Prince George Bagration of Mukhrani]] in 1995 when he first visited Georgia as a royal pretender to that country's [[abolished monarchy]]. But she did not attend the much-publicized 2009 wedding of her grand-nephew, Prince [[David Bagration of Mukhrani]] to Princess [[Ana Bagration-Gruzinsky]], the heiress of King [[George XII of Georgia]], celebrated at the restored [[Holy Trinity Cathedral of Tbilisi]]. Nor did she re-locate her home from western Europe to Russia, although she visited the country repeatedly following her husband's funeral and burial in [[Saint Petersburg]].

Wealth inherited by her elder, unmarried daughter Helen Kirby (styled by Vladimir's declaration as "Countess Dvinskaya"), helped Leonida, her second husband and younger daughter maintain homes in the north of France and in Madrid. There, both Maria Vladimirovna, who remains active as the claimant to the throne of the Romanovs in exile, and Maria's only son, [[Grand Duke George Mikhailovich of Russia|Grand Duke George Mikhailovich]] (born in 1981, his father is Maria's ex-husband and distant cousin, [[Prince Franz Wilhelm of Prussia]]), were reared.

==Death==
Leonida Georgievna died on 23 May 2010, after her health had rapidly deteriorated. She requested to be buried next to her husband Vladimir Kirillovich in the [[Grand Ducal Mausoleum]], Saint Petersburg. She was the last member of the Romanov family born on the territory of the [[Russian Empire]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/7759313/Last-Romanov-born-in-Russian-empire-dies-aged-95.html Last Romanov born in Russian empire dies aged 95]&lt;/ref&gt; during the monarchy.

==Career==
Saleri worked for [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] (1974–1992) and served as Manager of Reservoir Engineering in [[Houston, Texas]]. He is author and principal instructor for Chevron’s Reservoir Management training (1998–2002). He has been involved in world-wide projects ([[Gulf of Mexico]], [[West Texas]], [[Elk Hills]], [[West Africa]], [[Indonesia]], and [[Papua New Guinea]]).

He joined Saudi Aramco as a Petroleum Engineer specialist in 1992. Saleri was chief architect of Saudi Aramco's successful reservoir management and water optimization programs, most notably for [[Ghawar]], the world’s largest field. Saleri oversaw the company’s Maximum Sustained Capability (MSC) commitments at 10.8 million barrels per day and strategic planning for its oil and gas assets. He has assumed leadership role in numerous functions, including lead the Best-in-Class Strategic Imperative in Well Optimization, and established the Company’s Reservoir Management Metrics and Chaired the corporate Gas Development Strategy Task Force. He directed reservoir development plans for several major projects, including Hawiyah and Haradh Gas Plants, Shaybah AXL, Haradh Increments II and III, Qatif/Abu-Safah, Nuayyim, AFK, Khurais, among others.

Saleri started his own company called Quantum Reservoir Impact (QRI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author =The Big E| title =This week in peak oil| quote =| newspaper =[[Daily Kos]]| date = March 7, 2008| url =http://www.dailykos.com/story/2008/03/08/471871/-This-week-in-peak-oil#| accessdate =February 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company describes itself as a value creation agency designed to help oil companies maximize efficiencies in extracting oil from their reservoirs. They claim to do this through the use of cutting-edge technology and novel practices.

'''Nola Therese Fraser''' ([[married and maiden names|née]] '''Chalhoub''')  is an Australian small business owner, former nurse and former [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] candidate on two occasions for the seat of [[Electoral district of Macquarie Fields|Macquarie Fields]]. Fraser became a [[whistleblower]] at two Sydney hospitals.

== Whistleblower ==

Fraser rose to prominence when she publicly criticised the administration of [[Camden, New South Wales|Camden]] and [[Campbelltown, New South Wales|Campbelltown]] hospitals in south-western [[Sydney]]. Her claims were backed by fellow nurses Valerie Owen, Vanessa Brag, Sheree Martin and Yvonne Quinn. On 5 November 2002, Fraser took her concerns to the health minister, and her local member of parliament, [[Craig Knowles]]. Fraser claimed that upon cataloguing the dangers patients faced at the hospitals, the minister threatened her.

Knowles demanded evidence, which the nurses provided, but after three weeks there had been no word on any investigation. It was reported that [[New South Wales Department of Health]] officials had been destroying incriminating documents. Meanwhile, an internal review concluded that the nurses' claims merited investigation by the [[Health Care Complaints Commission]].

On 25 February 2003, the HCCC recommended that no action be taken, having made "no findings that support any loss of confidence by the community in the Macarthur Health Service." The findings came three weeks before [[New South Wales state election, 2003|2003 state election]], which Labor won.

Fraser and her colleagues brought public attention to this matter with the help of [[talkback radio]] host [[Alan Jones (radio broadcaster)|Alan Jones]]. As HCCC investigations continued, according to a 2003 ''Sydney Morning Herald'' report, "those staff who were considering reporting their concerns about the failures watched helplessly as the whistleblower nurses were sidelined and victimised, their jobs placed in limbo." The department ordered a second investigation, led by the head of the [[Australian Council for Safety and Quality in Health Care]]. A copy of the HCCC's interim report was leaked to the ''Sun-Herald''. The HCCC had concluded that of 47 complaints, at least 17 patients "had died after receiving unsafe, inadequate or questionable care" at Camden and Campbelltown. But the report did not lay blame with any individual. In response, the opposition [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] led by [[John Brogden (politician)|John Brogden]] took up the nurses' concerns, decrying what they described as a "cover-up".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/12/12/1071125658578.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Exposing a tragic mess | date=13 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[Independent Commission Against Corruption (New South Wales)|Independent Commission Against Corruption]] inquiry into Knowles' behaviour cleared the minister in September 2005.&lt;ref name=icac-findings&gt;{{cite press release | title =ICAC makes no findings of corrupt conduct in relation to the Hon.

== Political campaigns ==

After Knowles resigned from Parliament in 2005, Fraser contested his seat of [[Electoral district of Macquarie Fields|Macquarie Fields]] for the [[Liberal Party of Australia]]. Fraser achieved a swing of 12% for her party, not enough to defeat Labor's [[Steven Chaytor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.nsw.gov.au/state_government_elections/election_results/district_index/macquarie_fields/results/2005_byelection|title=2005 Macquarie Fields By-Election Results |date=22 September 2005|publisher=[[New South Wales Electoral Commission]]|accessdate=2008-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fraser was again endorsed by the Liberals for the [[New South Wales state election, 2007|March 2007 election]]. However, Fraser was unable to improve on her by-election result and was defeated by Labor's candidate, Dr [[Andrew McDonald (Australian politician)|Andrew McDonald]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elections.nsw.gov.au/state_government_elections/electoral_districts/all_districts_/macquarie_fields/results_2007/perferential_count |title=2007 State Election Results|date=3 January 2008|publisher=[[New South Wales Electoral Commission]]|accessdate=2008-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fraser again stood for Macquarie Fields at the [[New South Wales state election, 2011]] but this time as an independent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://macarthur-chronicle-camden.whereilive.com.au/news/story/nsw-election-2011-macquarie-fields-candidates/|title=NSW Election 2011: Macquarie Fields candidates|date=19 March 2011|work=Macarthur Chronicle|accessdate=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She gained approximately 11% of the primary votes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/elections/nsw/2011/guide/macq.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Liberal candidate Sam Eskaros won 37% of the primary vote but despite a heavy swing against him the sitting ALP member Andrew McDonald retained the seat with 51.5% of the two party preferred vote.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

'''Peter Friederich''' (born 1942 in [[St Gallen]]) is a former [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[ambassador]] to [[Luxembourg]].

He was a career diplomat, working in the Swiss Foreign Ministry since 1971 and had served as ambassador to [[Vietnam]] and [[Cuba]]. He was made ambassador to Luxembourg in December 1999.

In July 2002 was arrested for assisting [[Illegal drugs trade|drug smugglers]], [[embezzlement]] and [[fraud]].  During his time as ambassador, Friederich invested money on behalf of friends in the [[stock market]]. He would promise a higher than average return on the investments. After the stock market crash in 2000 he lost [[Swiss franc|CHF]]5 million. He was arrested after CHF2.37 million was deposited into his private bank account by [[Antonio Florido Sosa]], a [[Spain|Spanish]] citizen who is thought to be involved in drugs trade and [[money laundering]]. The money was then transferred to various bank accounts that Swiss prosecutors claim were the accounts of people involved with drugs or laundering.

His trial began on May 8, 2005 in [[Federal Criminal Court]] in [[Bellinzona]]. He was convicted and sentenced to three and a half years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://factiva.com/pfa/newsletter/june.htm PFA Newsletter&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024145637/http://www.factiva.com/pfa/newsletter/june.htm |date=2007-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5925">'''Semih Terzi''' (?-15 July 2016) was an officer in the [[Turkish Army]], who was shot dead while trying to capture the headquarters of the Special Forces Command during the 2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt together with other plotters.

==Military career==
Terzi graduated from the [[Turkish Military Academy|Turkish Army Academy]] in 1989. In 2009, he was promoted to the rank of a [[Colonel commandant|Staff Colonel]] of the Engineer Corps ({{lang-tr|İstihkam Kurmay Albay}}). His promotion to the rank of a [[Brigadier general#Turkey|Brigadier general]] (''Tuğgeneral'') by the [[Supreme Military Council (Turkey)|Supreme Military Council]] took place in August 2014.&lt;ref name="akit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bg1"/&gt;

His last duty was commander of the 1st Special Forces Brigade and Special Forces Operations Base stationed in [[Silopi]], [[Şırnak]], southeastern Turkey.&lt;ref name="bg1"/&gt;

==On the night of the 2016 coup d'état attempt==
On 15 July 2016, a group of military attempted a [[2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt|coup d'état]]. Within the frame of the military actions, a group of coup plotters tried to capture the commander of the [[Special Forces Command (Turkey)|Special Forces]] [[Major general#Turkey|Maj. Gen.]] [[Zekai Aksakallı]]. He learned the coup plotters' intention, and was able to escape his followers. As he became aware of the plans of Brig. Gen. Semih Terzi to go [[Ankara]] in order to capture the headquarters of the Special Forces Command in [[Gölbaşı, Ankara|Gölbaşı]], he ordered Terzi around 00:30 hours local time by radio not to join the coup plotters. As Terzi showed signs of disobey, Aksakallı ordered the commander of the 3rd Special Forces commander Brig. Gen. Halil Soysal, who was stationed at Saladin town in Northern Iraq, to go to Silopi and to take over command there in order to neutralize the insurgent personnel by eventually interning the duty officer Col. Celal Koca.&lt;ref name="bg1"/&gt;

In the meantime, Terzi was underway from [[Diyarbakır Air Base]] to [[Akınci Air Base]] in Ankara by an aircraft. From there, he and twenty officers of diverse ranks flew by helicopter to Gölbaşı. The capture of the headquarters of Special Forces Command was very important for the coup plotters because they would be able to counteract any attempt of the government to prevent the coup, to commit suicides or rescue operations by controlling all the special units. After neutralizing the guards at the main entrance, they entered the headquarters front yard around 02:30 hours. Terzi notified the duty officer of the headquarters that he takes control of the Special Forces. At that moment, Terzi was shot dead by [[Sergeant major|Sgt. Maj.]] [[Ömer Halisdemir]], who was instructed by Gen. Maj. Zekai Aksakallı and was loyal to him. The putschist soldiers accompanying Terzi immediately killed Halisdemir in response.&lt;ref name="HT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="scf"/&gt; Terzi's body  was wrapped in a cloth, and was rushed by helicopter to GATA Gülhane Military Medical Academy Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.&lt;ref name="Yenicag"/&gt; Halisdemir's body remained in the front yard of the headquarters. The death of Terzi prevented a change in the chain of command.&lt;ref name="akit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="scf"/&gt;

==Burial==
The body of Terzi was transferred to [[Erzincan]] for burial. However, the Erzincan Municipality, responsible for burial service, called him a "traitor", and rejected his burial in the city cemetery. His family, therefore, buried him in the back yard of their home.&lt;ref name="akit"/&gt;

==Family==
He was survived by his wife Nazire Terzi.&lt;ref name="Aydinlik"/&gt; The widow was accused of "aiding the crime of violation of the constitution,", and was  sentenced to 18 years in prison in February 2018 after having been detained 559 days in jail.&lt;ref name="scf"/&gt;

'''Stephen W. Doran''' is an American politician who was a member of the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] from 1981 to 1995. He later worked as a bank executive and math tutor. In 2014 he pleaded guilty to drug trafficking and is serving 3 years in prison; he is scheduled to finish his sentence in 2017. 

==Early life==
Doran was born on March 26, 1956, in [[Boston]]. He attended [[Lexington High School (Massachusetts)|Lexington High School]], the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], and the [[London School of Economics]].&lt;ref name=PublicOfficers&gt;{{cite book|title=Public Officers of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts 1992&amp;ndash;1993|page=120|url=https://archive.org/stream/publicofficersof19931994bost#page/120/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
Doran began his political career as a [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]] Town Meeting Member in 1975.&lt;ref name=PublicOfficers /&gt; In 1978 he unsuccessfully challenged incumbent state representative [[Lincoln P. Cole]]. In 1980 he defeated Cole to become the representative for the 15th Middlesex District.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Collins|first=Laurence|title=No coattails for Mass. GOP|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=November 5, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his freshman term, Doran was an active participant in the House budget debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Black|first=Chris|title=The House's independent freshmen|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=June 11, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of his second term, Doran was a leader of a bipartisan coalition of more than fifty representatives who sought to reform the House rules. Their proposed changes included limiting sessions to the hours between 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., requiring that agendas be published for all formal sessions, that all conference reports be distributed 24 hours before floor action, and allowing television and radio journalists to broadcast formal House sessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=House Group Hopes to Win Rules Changes|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=January 5, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Collins|first=Laurence|title=House Moves to Lift TV Ban|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=January 11, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also was a leading supporter of overhauling the prevailing-wage law, which required the Commonwealth and municipal governments to pay union wages on contractual jobs, such as construction or snow removal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Collins|first=Laurence|title=9 Union Leaders Back McGee Over Keverian|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=July 19, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While serving in the House, Doran had a parking lot concession in [[Cape Cod]] and spent most of the summer running it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Short Circuit|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=July 1, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics Committee===
In 1989, Speaker [[George Keverian]] chose Doran to chair the House Ethics Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Loth|first=Renee|title=House Leadership Team Includes No Minorities|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=January 18, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, the committee chose to take no action against Keverian after he admitted to hiring subordinates to do remodeling work on his house and accepting free rugs from a legislative vendor. The committee concluded that the conflict of interest law Keverian admitted to violating does not exist in the House ethics code and therefore took no disciplinary action against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Phillips|first=Frank|title=House Ethics Panel Urges No Action Against Keverian|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=May 9, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, the committee voted 6 to 5 to remove [[Kevin Fitzgerald (American politician)|Kevin Fitzgerald]] from his position as majority whip for having accepted a $200,000 inheritance from a troubled homeless woman. Doran sided with two other Democrats and three Republicans in favor of sanctioning Fitzgerald.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McGrory|first=Brian|title=For Fitzgerald, a fast rise, a long fall|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=December 22, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the committee was on the verge of recommending the expulsion of representative [[John McNeil (American politician)|John McNeil]] due to charges that he solicited sex from one of his former interns. However, [[Massachusetts Attorney General]] [[Scott Harshbarger]] and US Attorney [[John Pappalardo]] requested that the committee suspend its work due to fears that taking testimony from witnesses during a quasijudicial hearing could jeopardize their cases (which included extortion, bribery, money laundering, and mail fraud) against McNeil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Phillips|first=Frank|title=`Reluctantly,' panel halts McNeil probe|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=October 1, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-political career==
In 1994, Doran chose not to run for reelection and instead entered the banking industry as a vice president at Fleet Mortgage, a subsidiary of [[FleetBoston Financial|Fleet Financial Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Iudica|first=Doreen|title=Hopkinton woman launches bid to bump Magnani from Senate|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=March 13, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cassidy|first=Tina|title=Government shutdown backs up mortgages|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=January 13, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Fleet, Doran oversaw the company's New England mortgage operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Collins|first=James|title=Mortgage Rates Rise to 1-Year High, Adjustable Loans Drawing Attention|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=August 8, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, Doran began working as a math tutor at MATCH Public Charter Middle School in [[Jamaica Plain]]. He was later diagnosed with stage three melanoma and began chemotherapy.&lt;ref name="Tutor received package containing meth at charter school" /&gt;

===Methamphetamine trafficking===
On May 21, 2013, Doran received a package at the school. State Police, acting on a tip, detained Doran on the street and obtained the package from the school front desk. The package contained two heat-sealed baggies containing 480 grams of [[Methamphetamine|crystal meth]]. Authorities then obtained a warrant to search Doran's home. There they found an additional 38 grams of meth, about $10,000 in cash, and a digital scale and other items consistent with drug distribution. He was arrested on charges of trafficking methamphetamine and violating the state's law against drug in a school zone. The drugs had a street value of about $50,000&lt;ref name="Tutor received package containing meth at charter school"&gt;{{cite news|title=Police: Tutor received package containing meth at charter school|url=http://www.myfoxboston.com/story/22393659/2013/05/22/police-tutor-received-package-containing-meth-at-charter-school|accessdate=April 3, 2014|newspaper=myfoxboston.com|date=May 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DailyMail&gt;{{cite news|title=The real-life Breaking Bad?

On March 31, 2014, Doran pleaded guilty to trafficking in methamphetamine and money laundering. He was sentenced to three years in prison followed by two years of probation. According to one of his defense attorneys, Doran was a "terrible addict" who had sought treatment and been substance-free since his arrest.&lt;ref name="Ex-pol cops plea in case evoking ‘Breaking Bad’"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-pol cops plea in case evoking ''Breaking Bad''|url=http://bostonherald.com/news_opinion/local_coverage/2014/03/ex_pol_cops_plea_in_case_evoking_breaking_bad|accessdate=April 3, 2014|newspaper=Boston Herald|date=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the similarities, Doran's case has been compared to the television show ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' and Doran has been compared to its protagonist, [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]].&lt;ref name=DailyMail /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ex-pol cops plea in case evoking ‘Breaking Bad’" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Real-Life Walter White?

Both men also underwent chemotherapy and are bald as a result.&lt;ref name=DailyMail /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15529">'''Thai names''' are comparable to the Western European pattern in which the [[family name]] follows a first or [[given name]]. In this, they differ from the family-name-first pattern of the general [[East Asia]]n tradition.

Thai names (given and family) are often long, and there are a great many of them. The diversity of family names is because they are required to be unique to a family, and they are a recent introduction. Also, a number of Thai people change their given names relatively frequently (and their family names less frequently, as it requires permission of the head of a family or, in the case of children, father and mother). This practice is virtually unknown in most other countries outside of marriage and [[fortune-telling]] traditions. Besides standard reasons of separation and divorce, many name changes are done to get rid of bad luck (which, if caused by a ghost or spirit, would confuse the malignant entity, allowing the victim to get free from them).

Last names became legally required of Thai citizens in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baker|first1=Christopher J.|last2=Phongpaichit|first2=Pasuk|title=A History of Thailand|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Melbourne|isbn=978-0-521-767-682 |page=97|pages=|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before then, most Thais used only a first or individual name. The names generally convey positive attributes. Under Thai law, only one family can use any given surname: Thus, any two people of the same surname must be related.{{cn|date=May 2014}}

Thai surnames are often long, particularly among [[Thai Chinese|Thais of Chinese descent]]. For example, the family of former Prime Minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]], who is of Chinese descent, adopted the name Shinawatra ("does good routinely") in 1938. According to the current law, Person Name Act, [[Thai solar calendar|BE]] 2505 (1962), to create a new Thai surname, it must not be longer than ten [[Thai alphabet|Thai letter]]s, excluding vowel symbols and diacritics.&lt;ref name="Nittaya-Royin-1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royin.go.th/th/knowledge/detail.php?ID=1929|date=|accessdate=2014-12-28|script-title=th:เรื่องของนามสกุล (๑)|author=รศ. ดร.นิตยา กาญจนะวรรณ|publisher=[[Royal Institute of Thailand]]|language=th|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141228112902/http://www.royin.go.th/th/knowledge/detail.php?ID=1929|archivedate=2014-12-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same law also forbids the creation of a surname that duplicated any existing surnames, There are some duplicates dating to the time before computer databases were available to prevent this.&lt;ref name="Nittaya-Royin-2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royin.go.th/th/knowledge/detail.php?ID=1928|date=|accessdate=2014-12-28|script-title=th:เรื่องของนามสกุล (๒)|author=รศ. ดร.นิตยา กาญจนะวรรณ|publisher=[[Royal Institute of Thailand]]|language=th|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141228112833/http://www.royin.go.th/th/knowledge/detail.php?ID=1928|archivedate=2014-12-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some creations added the name of their location ([[muban]], [[tambon]] or [[amphoe]]) into surnames, similar to [[Family name affixes|family name suffixes]].&lt;ref name="Korat-surnamesuffixes1"&gt;{{cite web | url=

As a measure of the diversity of Thai names, in a sample of 45,665 names, 81% of family names were unique, and 35% of given names were unique: The people with shared family names are related, and the diversity of given names is conventional.{{Dead link|date=April 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://seasrc.th.net/pdf/xthname.pdf 45,665 Thai names: Examining passlist.96] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226203617/http://seasrc.th.net/pdf/xthname.pdf |date=2008-02-26 }}, by Doug Cooper&lt;/ref&gt;

==Royal and feudal names==
{{see also|Rama (Kings of Thailand)|List of Thai Monarchs|Thai royal and noble titles}}
East Asian monarchs often adopted [[Regnal name#East_Asia|regnal names]] upon ascending the throne, as was done in [[Thailand]] until the present day. In addition, subjects of a monarch may be awarded both a title and a name, such as in the case of Sing (or [[Singh]]) Sinhaseni ({{lang|th|สิงห์ สิงหเสนี}}) who was awarded the title of [[Thai_royal_and_noble_titles#Chao_Phraya|Chao Phraya]] and the name of [[Bodindecha]] ({{lang-th|เจ้าพระยาบดินทรเดชา}}.) 

Kings [[Rama I]] and [[Rama II of Siam|Rama II]] were awarded noble titles and names before they assumed regnal names, which were then changed by subsequent kings. As neither noble titles nor names are necessarily unique, it is customary to list the highest title and awarded named first, followed by former names and titles (and personal and family names in parentheses) as needed.

==Noble names==
Descendants of the nobility, both hereditary and non-hereditary positions, generally take the [[Thai royal and noble titles#Descendants of a Sovereign|noble name]] of their ancestor for a surname. For instance, [[Hugo (musician)|Hugo Chakrabongse]] is a descendant of Prince [[Chakrabongse Bhuvanath]]. Some (far removed) descendants of royalty add the preposition and [[nobility particle]] "na" ([[wikt:ณ|ณ]]) to geographical names to create surnames, in the same way that members of German noble families use ''[[von]]''. 

Thus [[Mongkol Na Songkhla]], a minister in the Surayud government, has a name indicating that he is a distant descendant of royalty or nobility in that geographical region (for instance, the surname "Na Chiangmai", belonging to descendants of the rulers of Chiang Mai, which was a vassal state of Siam). The name of [[Kasem Sanitwong Na Ayutthaya]], another minister, indicates that he is related to the royal family, as it is also tradition for far-removed descendants to add "[[Thai royal and noble titles#Na Ayutthaya|Na Ayutthaya]]" after their surnames. In this case, Sanitwong is the family name of Kasem. Sanitwong itself being a name of a royal consort of Rama V and the subsequent family name for her descendants.

==Formal names==
Formal surnames were a 20th-century innovation of [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst|Sandhurst-educated]] King [[Vajiravudh#Education|Vajiravudh]] (Rama VI, r.1910 – 25).

The Council of Royal [[Pandit]]s, predecessor to the [[Royal Institute of Thailand#History|Royal Institute of Thailand]], was available to assist in deriving palace names, as they were called. For an example, see the [[Abhisit Vejjajiva#Background|background of the Vejjajiva]] palace name. The latter-day [[Royal Thai General System of Transcription]] would transcribe it as "Wetchachiwa". Formal personal names follow from traditional practice to include individual awards of palace-given names.

== Polite names ==
In [[manners|polite speech]], Thais address each or refer to each other by a given name, preceded by the [[Thai royal and noble titles#Khun (courtesy title)|courtesy title ''khun'']], particularly with persons of higher status or public distinction. Thus, the ministers mentioned above would be addressed and referred to as "Khun Mongkol" and "Khun Kasem". "Khun" pronounced with an even tone should not be confused with rising-tone [[Thai royal and noble titles#Khun|khun]], an obsolete feudal title, or ever replaced with "[[Thai_royal_and_noble_titles#Khunying|Khunying]]", comparable to formal [[Lady]] in Western culture, still sometimes awarded.

==Informal names==
Informal names are awarded at birth and may continue in use to the extent one may have to check the formal registration to find a person's given formal name. Thais may address each other by [[nicknames]] ({{lang-th|ชื่อเล่น|translit=chue-len}}). Bestowed by relatives or playmates in early childhood, these are commonly one syllable (or worn down from two to one). These may often be nonsense words or humorous and seldom relate to the registered name except in cases where it is a [[diminutive]], such as "Nok" for "Noknoi," or ''bird'' from ''little bird''. All Thais have such names; they are freely used in everyday life. Some may have additional nicknames bestowed by friends or colleagues, especially during school or adolescence. Nicknames may link with a notable physical feature or behavior. In everyday life, a Thai is introduced by nickname and others may not know the person's formal name. When so introduced, one usually continues to use the nickname.

The evolution of Thai nicknames dates back to the [[Sukhothai Kingdom|Sukhothai era]], when names were used to mark the order of children. Nicknames such as "Ai", "Yee", and "Sam" designated children as "one", "two", and "three". Later, in the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] and [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Rattanakosin]] periods, children began to be named for physical attributes, such as "Daeng" (red) or "Uan" (fat) or for desirable items such as "Thong" (gold).  Conversely, unflattering nicknames such as "Mah (dog)", "Moo (pig)", or "Kob (frog)" were employed to keep malign spirits from coveting the child. [[King Mongkut]] (Rama IV) (1804-1868) stimulated interest in naming babies in accordance with astrological principles as outlined in the ancient scripture, ''Namtaksapakorn''.&lt;ref name="KU-2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wongsantativanich|first1=Mingkwan|title=What’s in a Name?: An Analysis of English Nicknames of Thai People|journal=Humanities Journal|date=2013|volume=20|issue=Special Issue|pages=133-166|url=http://158.108.54.4/humanjournal/files/journalonline/journal56/2556-special.pdf|accessdate=2 November 2016|publisher=Kasetsart University|issn=0859-3485}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the time of Field Marshal [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram]] (1897-1964), gender-based naming was introduced. Names ending in "-sak", "-chai", and "-yot" were for male babies, "-porn" or "-sri" for females. In the 21st century, assigning nicknames still relies heavily on astrological beliefs but in keeping up with current naming fashions. Observers have noted such modern nicknames as "Porsche", "Mercedes", "Benz", "Man U", "Big Mac", "Internet", and "Google", among others.&lt;ref name="BP-20161102"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pongpipat|first1=Kaona|title=What's in a Name?|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/special-reports/1125065/whats-in-a-name-|accessdate=2 November 2016|work=Bangkok Post|date=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[King Bhumibol Adulyadej]]'s nickname, for example, was Ong Lek ({{lang-th| องค์เล็ก}}; ''Ong'' is a numerative noun for kings, princes, princesses, priests, images of Buddha, gods, angels, palaces, pagodas; "lek" means "little (one)", a common name for younger siblings).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/1100369/introducing-fatty-piggy-and-mrs-frog|title=Introducing Fatty, Piggy and Mrs Frog|date=2 October 2016|work=Bangkok Post|format=Opinion|last1=Crutchley|first1=Roger|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Prime Minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]]'s nickname is {{lang-th|แม้ว|translit=Maew}}, Thai for the [[Miao people]]. By way of example preceding formal naming, [[Plaek Pibulsongkram#Early years|Plaek Pibulsongkram]]'s childhood name meant "strange". He later adopted as a surname what was originally an award for academic excellence and generally known in public life by the shortened form "Pibun." Thailand's first female Prime Minister, [[Yingluck Shinawatra]], is nicknamed ''Pu'' "crab" ({{lang|th|ปู}}; {{IPA-th|pūː }}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |script-title=th:'ปู'ปัดบินฮ่องกงพบพี่ชาย ไม่รู้'สมศักดิ์'อยากร่วมรบ. |date=8 July 2011 |language=Thai |newspaper=Thairath |location=Bangkok |trans-title="'Pu' denied flying to Hong Kong to see her brother, not knowing Somsak's joining coalition"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indexing==
According to the [[Chicago Manual of Style]], Thai names may be [[Subject indexing|indexed]] depending upon the individual practice. Often they may be alphabetized under the given name with no comma and no inversion, but they may also be alphabetized under the surname with a comma and with an inversion.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/CHIIndexingComplete.pdf Indexes: A Chapter from The Chicago Manual of Style]" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6WQIXWdqH?url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/CHIIndexingComplete.pdf Archive]).

'''Thomas Edward Ketchum''' (October 31, 1863 &amp;ndash; April 26, 1901), known as '''Black Jack''', was a [[cowboy]] who later turned to a life of crime. He was executed in 1901 for attempted [[train robbery]].

==First train robberies and murders==
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/we-blackjackketchum.html|title=NEW MEXICO LEGENDS Train Robber - Black Jack Ketchum|publisher=Legends of America|accessdate=December 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Tom Ketchum was born in [[San Saba County, Texas]].  He left Texas in 1890, possibly after committing a crime. He worked as a cowboy in the [[Pecos River]] Valley of [[New Mexico]], where by 1894, his older brother, Sam Ketchum, had joined him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fke38 Texas State Historical Association (TSHA)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Black Jack and a group of others were named as the robbers of an [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]] train that was en route to [[Deming, New Mexico|Deming]], [[New Mexico Territory]], in 1892 with a large payroll aboard. The gang supposedly robbed the train just outside [[Nutt, New Mexico|Nutt]], New Mexico Territory, a water station twenty miles north of Deming. Black Jack and his gang would often visit the ranch of Herb Bassett, near Brown's Park, Colorado, who was known to have done business with several outlaws of the day, having supplied them with beef and fresh horses. Herb Bassett was the father of female outlaws [[Josie Bassett]] and [[Ann Bassett]], who were girlfriends to several members of [[Butch Cassidy]]'s [[Butch Cassidy's Wild Bunch|Wild Bunch]] gang. One of Ann Bassett's boyfriends and future Wild Bunch gang member, [[Ben Kilpatrick]], began riding with Black Jack's gang about that time. Outlaw [[William Walters (outlaw)|"Bronco Bill" Walters]], later noted for the legend of his "hidden loot" near [[Solomonville, Arizona|Solomonville]], [[Arizona]], is also believed to have begun riding with the gang at this time.

The second major crime attributed to Tom was the murder of a neighbor, John N. "Jap" Powers, in [[Tom Green County, Texas]], on December 12, 1895. However, information at the Sutton Historical Society in Texas, says that [[William Carver (Wild Bunch)|Will Carver]] and Sam Ketchum were the ones actually accused of killing Powers in [[Knickerbocker, Texas|Knickerbocker]].  Fearing the law, they closed their joint saloon and gambling venture in [[San Angelo, Texas|San Angelo]], and hit the outlaw trail. Within six months, Mrs. Powers and her lover, J. E. Wright, were arrested for the murder, but it was too late for Carver and the Ketchums.
[[File:Blackjackketchum.gif|thumb|Tom Ketchum]]

By late 1895, outlaw [[Harvey Logan|Harvey "Kid Curry" Logan]] and his brother Lonnie Curry were members of Black Jack's gang. However, in early 1896, a dispute concerning their share of robbery loot prompted the Currys to leave the gang.

It is alleged that Ketchum was involved with the February 1, 1896, disappearance and presumed murders of [[Albert Jennings Fountain]] and his son Henry Fountain of [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]], New Mexico. In early June 1896, after working for the famed [[Bell Ranch]] in New Mexico, Tom and Sam Ketchum, and  possibly others, robbed a combined store and post office at Liberty, New Mexico, northwest of present-day [[Tucumcari, New Mexico|Tucumcari]]. According to contemporary accounts, the Ketchums rode into Liberty on June 12 and purchased supplies. That evening, a thunderstorm began, and they returned to the store, owned by Morris and Levi Herzstein, who invited them to take shelter.

Returning the next morning to open his store, Levi Herzstein found that both the store and post office had been burglarized. After gathering a [[Posse comitatus (common law)|posse]], Herzstein set out on the outlaws' trail. The posse, composed of just four men, took the two outlaws by surprise in the Plaza Largo [[Arroyo (creek)|arroyo]], where a shootout immediately began. Seconds later both Levi Herzstein and Hermenejildo Gallegos lay dead. Seeing his comrades fall, Anastacio Borgue turned his horse and rode out of the arroyo. Placido Gurulé, the fourth member of the posse, also survived to give an account. Gurulé said he had been struck by a .30-30 bullet that knocked him off his horse. He landed on the ground with a blow that knocked the wind out of him. He lay in a [[semiconscious]] state as Black Jack Ketchum emptied his rifle into the bodies of Levi Herzstein and Hermenejildo Gallegos. Tom and Sam Ketchum were never tried for the killings at the Plaza Largo arroyo, but Morris Herzstein reportedly was present in Clayton, New Mexico Territory to witness the hanging of Black Jack Ketchum in 1901.

Morris Herzstein moved to Clayton shortly after the killing in Liberty, and finally into the [[Texas Panhandle]] area. This is memorialized by the inscription on a shoe brush: ''Herzstein's Clayton, New Mexico -- Dalhart, Texas. If it's from Herzstein's it's correct.'' Morris was the father of Albert Herzstein, who became one of the founders of Big 3 Industries in [[Houston]], and is the man who helped the museum in Clayton to become a reality years later.

==Joining the Hole-In-The-Wall gang==
Following this event, Thomas Ketchum joined other outlaws of the [[Hole in the Wall Gang]] and continued a life of crime, focusing on train robberies, although when not robbing trains they worked for several ranches in New Mexico and Texas. Several other notable outlaws operated out of Hole In The Wall, which was a hideout for numerous outlaw gangs which operated separately. The famous [[Butch Cassidy's Wild Bunch|Wild Bunch]] gang, led by [[Butch Cassidy]] and [[Elzy Lay]], operated out of there. One Wild Bunch gang member, [[Kid Curry]], along with his brother Lonny Curry, had previously ridden with Black Jack Ketchum and his gang. He and Ketchum did not like each other, and Ketchum avoided Curry as much as possible. Kid Curry would kill nine lawmen over the course of the next eight years.

During this time, Tom Ketchum was once identified mistakenly as "Black Jack" Christian, another outlaw, and that became his nickname as well. Three of the train robberies that the gang committed were near the same location, between Folsom and Des Moines, New Mexico Territory. This was at the point where the old Fort Union wagon road crossed the Colorado and Southern Rail Road tracks near Twin Mountain.

On September 3, 1897, they committed their first robbery at Twin Mountain. Then, on July 11, 1899, the gang, without Black Jack, robbed the train again at Twin Mountain. After the robbery, Sam and several unknown gang members, in addition to Wild Bunch gang members Will Carver and William Ellsworth "Elza" Lay, headed for the mountains southwest of [[Raton, New Mexico]] Territory.  The next day, a [[Posse comitatus (common law)|posse]] consisting of Sheriff Ed Farr of [[Huerfano County, Colorado]], Special Agent W.H. Reno of the Colorado &amp; Southern Railroad, and five deputies found their trail and tracked them into Turkey Creek Canyon near [[Cimarron, New Mexico|Cimarron]], New Mexico. There, the posse engaged them in a gun battle. Sam Ketchum and two deputies were wounded seriously, and the gang escaped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.historynet.com/tom-ketchum-and-his-gang.htm|title=Tom Ketchum and His Gang|publisher=History Net|date=June 12, 2006|accessdate=December 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sam Ketchum's wounds slowed the intended escape, and they made it only a short distance from the initial shootout. Several members of the posse cornered the Ketchum gang a few days later, still in the same area of the Territory. Deputy W. H. Love &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.odmp.org/officer.php?oid=15714|title=W.H.

Sam Ketchum escaped, but was found a few days later by Special Agent Reno at the home of a rancher, where he was arrested.

Sam Ketchum was taken to the Santa Fe Territorial Prison, where he died from his gunshot wounds.  He was buried in the Odd Fellows rest Cemetery, now the Fairview Cemetery on Cerrillos Rd. in Santa Fe.

"Elzy" or "Elza" (William Ellsworth) Lay was born November 25, 1868, Mt Pleasant, Ohio. Lay had come out west to Denver, and became an outlaw after mistakenly believing he had killed a man. Jailed for life after the killing of Sheriff Farr after the Folsom robbery, he was released in 1906. He returned to [[Alma, New Mexico]] Territory and lived there for two years. He stayed with Louis and Walter Jones, who in 1904 had built a large merchandise store at Alma. Elzy died aged 65 in [[Los Angeles]], on November 10, 1934.

==Capture and death==
[[File:KetchumHanging.JPG|thumb|Ketchum on the scaffold before hanging, April 26, 1901, Clayton, New Mexico]][[File:KetchumDecapitated.jpg|thumb|Sepia-tone photo from a contemporary postcard showing Tom Ketchum's decapitated body. Caption reads "Body of Black Jack after the hanging showing head snapped off."]]
On August 16, 1899, Tom Ketchum, supposedly knowing nothing of the July 11 hold-up which ended in the death of his brother Sam, single-handedly attempted to rob the same train again at the same place and in the same way that he and Sam and others had robbed it just a few weeks earlier. The train conductor, Frank Harrington, saw Tom approaching the moving train. He recognized him, grabbed a shotgun, and shot Tom in the arm, knocking him off his horse. The train continued, and the next day a posse came out and found Tom beside the tracks, badly wounded. He was transported to medical facilities at [[Trinidad, Colorado]], and his right arm had to be amputated. He was nursed back to health and then sent to [[Clayton, New Mexico|Clayton]], New Mexico Territory, for trial.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

At the trial, Ketchum was convicted and sentenced to death. He was the only person ever hanged in Union County, New Mexico Territory (now [[Union County, New Mexico]]). He was also the only person who suffered capital punishment for the offense of "felonious assault upon a railway train" in New Mexico Territory (which did not become a state until 1912). Later, the law was found to be [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Ketchum was executed by hanging in Clayton. Nobody in Clayton had any experience in conducting hangings; the rope was too long, and since Ketchum had gained a significant amount of weight during his time in jail, he was [[Decapitation|decapitated]] when he dropped through the trap door.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.footnote.com/spotlight/9403/4271901_his_head_severed_by_the_rope/ San Francisco Chronicle, 27 April 1901] - Digital Copy.&lt;/ref&gt;

His last words were reported by the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' as: "Good-bye. Please dig my grave very deep. All right; hurry up."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

A popular postcard was made showing the body. Afterwards his head was sewn back onto the body for viewing, and he was interred at the Clayton Cemetery.

==Media portrayals==

Western [[actor]] [[Jack Elam]] portrayed Ketchum in an episode of the 1954–55 [[Television syndication|syndicated]] [[television series]] ''[[Stories of the Century]]'', tales of the [[American West]] starring and [[narration|narrated]] by [[Jim Davis (actor)|Jim Davis]].

[[Howard Duff]] played Ketchum in the 1957 American Western film, ''[[Blackjack Ketchum, Desperado]]''.

[[Rhodes Reason]] played Ketchum in a 1959 episode of the [[United States|American]] [[Western (genre)|Western]] [[television series]] ''[[Frontier Doctor]].

'''Victor Wulf''' is a Canadian [[keyboard player]] and composer. He is recognized for his solo [[ambient music]] project [[Dilate (musical project)|Dilate]] and as a founding member of [[sound collage]] band [[Vampire Rodents]].

==Biography==
Victor Wulf was involved in composing music for television since 1977.&lt;ref name="maven"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://soundmaven.com/artist/Dilate/ | title=Artist Page:Dilate | publisher=Sound Maven | accessdate=October 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1989, Wulf and Vahnke founded [[Vampire Rodents]], a project that incorporated elements of [[industrial rock]] and [[sound collage]].&lt;ref name="rodentint07"&gt;{{cite web |first=Gabe |last=Wilkinson |url=http://themindofmicrowaved.blogspot.com/2007/06/vampire-rodentsether-bunny-interview.html |title=Vampire Rodents/Ether Bunny Interview 2007 |publisher=themindofmicrowaved.blogspot.com |date=June 2007 |accessdate=October 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The duo released three albums: ''[[War Music (Vampire Rodents album)|War Music]]'' (1990), ''[[Premonition (Vampire Rodents album)|Premonition]]'' (1992) and ''[[Lullaby Land (album)|Lullaby Land]]'' (1993). During this time, Wulf was primary influenced by [[Can (band)|Can]], [[Bernard Herrmann]], [[John Zorn]] and [[Big band|big band music]].&lt;ref name="technologyworks91"&gt;{{cite journal|first= |last=Chase |url=http://www.msu.edu/~tarjason/TechWorks.htm |title=Interview with Victor Wulf and Anton Rathausen of the Vampire Rodents |journal=Technology Works |date=1991 |issue=12 |accessdate=September 15, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000518193302/http://www.msu.edu/~tarjason/TechWorks.htm |archivedate=May 18, 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wulf became less involved in the writing process with each album and he decided to leave Vampire Rodents after the release of ''Lullaby Land''. Wulf founded his own [[ambient music]] project [[Dilate (musical project)|Dilate]] in 1995. After being picked up by [[Cleopatra Records]], he released ''[[Cyclos (album)|Cyclos]]'' in early 1996.&lt;ref name="discog"&gt;{{cite web | url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p204768|pure_url=yes}} | title=Dilate Discography | work=[[Allmusic]] | accessdate=October 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Octagon (Dilate album)|Octagon]]'' was released in 1997.

'''W. &amp; D. Downey''' were [[Victorian era|Victorian]] studio photographers operating in London from the 1860s to the 1910s. 

William Downey (14 July 1829 in [[South Shields]] – 7 July 1915 in [[Kensington]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.photolondon.org.uk/pages/details.asp?pid=2307 photoLondon]&lt;/ref&gt; who came to be known as the Queen's Photographer, was born in King Street in South Shields, a decade before commercial photography had become a reality. William, initially, was a carpenter and boatbuilder,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seaham.i12.com/myers/downey.htm Downey&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; but in about 1855 he set up a studio in South Shields with his brother Daniel and later established branches in [[Blyth, Northumberland|Blyth]], [[Morpeth, Northumberland|Morpeth]] and [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]. Their first Royal commission was to provide photographs for [[Queen Victoria]] of the [[Hartley Colliery Disaster]] in January 1862. Daniel Downey is his brother (1831 – 15 July 1881).

In 1863 they opened a studio on [[Old Eldon Square|Eldon Square]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]. The same year William set up a studio in the [[Houses of Parliament]] and produced portraits of every parliamentarian of the day. The resulting images' location is unknown to this day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/whats-on-newcastle/theatre-arts/2005/02/03/victorian-age-seen-in-focus-72703-15147674/ ChronicleLive]&lt;/ref&gt;

William moved to 57 &amp; 61 [[Ebury Street]] in London in 1872 and opened another studio, his brother managing the Newcastle branch. The London studio enjoyed the patronage of [[Queen Victoria]] and the [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]], taking photos at [[Balmoral Castle|Balmoral]] and [[Frogmore]] during the 1860s. Its first Royal image was of the [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess of Wales]] at the York Agricultural Show in about 1865. The studio also produced the iconic carte-de-visite portrait of the Princess of Wales piggybacking [[Louise, Princess Royal and Duchess of Fife|Princess Louise]]. The studio received a [[Royal Warrant of Appointment (United Kingdom)|Royal Warrant]] in 1879.

Downey used [[Joseph Swan]]'s carbon process for their best work. In the 1880s Mawson, Swan &amp; Morgan of Newcastle, was the world's largest manufacturer of photographic dry plates, the convenience of which made photography a commercial reality. [[George Eastman]] spent some time there during the eighties and afterwards invented the [[Brownie (camera)|Box Brownie]] and [[roll film]], ending the monopoly of studios on permanent images.

William Downey's son, William Edward Downey (1855–1908), managed most of the royal sittings during the [[Edwardian]] era.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/person.asp?LinkID=mp06902&amp;role=art National Portrait Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gladys Cooper]], a child photographic model of the time, reminisces about the Downeys in her autobiography:&lt;ref&gt;[http://footlightnotes.tripod.com/20050212home.html "Gladys Cooper"'', Hutchinson &amp; Co Ltd, London, 1931]&lt;/ref&gt;     
{{quote|''I can remember the Downeys quite well – they were father and son. "Old" Downey was a very tall old man with a long white beard, and very red-rimmed eyes. He always wore a long frock-coat with a red ribbon in his buttonhole, and looked a dignified old gentleman, who was quite capable of receiving and greeting Royals with just the right manner of respectful homage. It was considered a great honour to be photographed by "Old" Downey himself. He never "took" anyone lower than one of the Princesses, or perhaps a duchess now and then, if he felt in the mood. His staff treated him rather like Royalty itself, and, when he rode abroad in his carriage, they would stand round with rugs, cushions, etc., until he waved them aside in lordly fashion.''

''"Young" Downey (he was always known as "Young" Downey to distinguish him from his father) was a big man – or so he seemed to me then – with a bald head. He was an artist in his work, and used to say that he always knew the best side of anybody's face after one good look at them. He certainly made some fine photographs of the famous beauties of his time, and possessed the art of retaining character in the face of his sitter. 'I used to enjoy my visits to the Downey père et fils. "Young" Downey was very fond of children, and my sisters Doris and Grace and I had plenty of fun playing about in the great studio, or dressing ourselves up in the wonderful assortment of garments that he kept there.''}}

William senior was married to Lucy, who had been born in [[Speenhamland, Berkshire]] in 1843, and they had one son and one daughter. He joined the Photographic Society (later The [[Royal Photographic Society]]) in December 1870. The 1891 and 1901 census records show that he was living at 10 Nevern Square, Warwick Road, [[Earl's Court]], Kensington. Downey's prized silver collection was stolen from his Earl's Court home in November 1914 – the burglary is said to have brought on his death.

William Downey senior was William Fowler Downey and he married Caroline Griffiths of Cheshire. They had two sons, William Edward and Robert Ingham (who died an infant). Caroline died in 1874 and William remarried Lucy Lyon in 1877.  Their children were Arthur James Hope and Laura Evelyn.

Arthur, as A.J.H. Downey, continued the family business: his work included a portrait of King George V's children in 1910, the year of their fathers accesson. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PHOTOGRAPHIC PORTRAIT, SIGNED, OF THE CHILDREN OF GEORGE V|url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2014/english-literature-history-childrens-books-illustrations-l14404/lot.421.html|publisher=Sothebys}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Daniel Downey married Elizabeth Smith Beloe and had three children, another Robert Ingham Downey, Elizabeth and Victoria Christine.
Daniel died in Bethnal House, Bethnal Green on 15 July 1881.

After making several comedic appearances along with other correspondents, Cenac filed his first field report on July 21, 2008; titled "Baruch Obama," the report discussed Jewish voters' opinions of Democratic Presidential nominee Barack Obama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Wyatt Cenac; Jeremy Ring |title=Baruch Obama |url=http://www.comedycentral.com/videos/index.jhtml?videoId=177061 |medium=.swf |format=video |publisher=Comedy Central ''The Daily Show'' |date=July 21, 2008|accessdate=June 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He continued to integrate satirical Black-oriented material in his ''Daily Show'' segments, including "Rapper or Republican"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Wyatt Cenac; Jon Stewart; Jason Jones |title=Rapper or Republican |url=http://www.comedycentral.com/videos/index.jhtml?videoId=178008 |medium=.swf |format=video |location= |publisher=Comedy Central ''The Daily Show''|date=July 29, 2008 |accessdate=June 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; until his final ''[[The Daily Show|Daily Show]]'' appearance on December 13, 2012. In a July 2015 appearance on ''[[WTF with Marc Maron]]'', Cenac revealed that his departure from ''The Daily Show'' stemmed in part from a heated argument he had with [[Jon Stewart]] over a June 2011 ''Daily Show'' bit about Republican Presidential candidate [[Herman Cain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Vulture.com]]|url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/07/jon-stewart-told-wyatt-cenac-to-fck-off.html|title=Jon Stewart Told Wyatt Cenac to ‘F*ck Off’ When He Was Challenged About Race|first=E.

{{Chinese name|[[Zeng (surname)|Zeng]]}}
'''Zeng Xuelin''' (Chinese: 曾雪麟;  2 December 1929&amp;nbsp;– 11 February 2016) was a Thailand-born Chinese football manager and former player. 

As a player he represented Guangzhou, Southwest Military Region, [[Bayi Football Team]] and [[Tianjin Teda F.C.|Tianjin]] while internationally he played for what is now known as the [[China national under-23 football team|Chinese PR under-23 football team]]. After retiring as a player he moved into coaching where he had successful reigns at [[Tianjin Teda F.C.|Tianjin]] and [[Beijing Guoan F.C.|Beijing]] where he won several league titles before managing the [[Chinese national football team]]. After leaving the Chinese national team he would mainly move away from management except for a brief spell when he joined [[Shenzhen Pingan|Shenzhen Ping'an]] on a caretaker bases.

==Playing career==
While Zeng Xuelin was born in [[Siam]] (now Thailand), he moved back with his family to China and settled in [[Mei County, Guangdong|Meixian]] in the [[Guangdong Province]] at the age of seven. After finishing high school, he joined the [[Chinese People's Liberation Army]] and played for the Guangzhou Army team where he played amateur football in the regional leagues before going to university where he played for the Southwest Military Region football team while he was studying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gpcfootball.163.com/08/0422/09/4A4HG9C100052JBN.html |title=国字号广东教练四虎 苏永舜曾雪麟留下惨痛回忆|publisher=sports.163.com |date=2008-04-22 |accessdate=2012-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the Liberation Army he was selected for their top football club [[Bayi Football Team]] and studied football in [[Hungary]]. When his time ended with Bayi, he was selected to be a part of the [[China national under-23 football team|China national white team]] (as Chinese B national team), which was allowed to participate in the league game during that time. In 1957, the White Team had moved to [[Tianjin]], and eventually became [[Tianjin Teda F.C.|Tianjin F.C.]]; he was the team captain for two seasons, and helped the team to win second place of the first [[National Games of China|Chinese National Games]] in 1959 before he officially retired.

==Management career==
Before he retired from Tianjin he became the player-coach in February 1959, and officially became the team manager in 1960, where he achieved considerable success early within his reign when he won the 1960 [[Chinese Jia-A League]] league title and  [[Chinese FA Cup]] in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesc/chinahist.html#60 |title=China 1960|publisher=rsssf.com |date=2009-10-22 |accessdate=2012-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club were constant title contenders throughout his reign despite seeing the [[Cultural Revolution]] severely stunting the team's development. Nevertheless, despite there not being any major tournaments held within China the club held on to Zeng when they also made him a consultant within the club. This lasted until 1972 when [[Beijing Guoan F.C.|Beijing]] football club offered him the youth coach position before he would soon take over the senior side. Once again Zeng was quick to achieve success when he won the 1973 league title in his first season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesc/chinahist.html#73 |title=China 1973|publisher=rsssf.com |date=2009-10-22 |accessdate=2012-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to make Beijing constant title contenders throughout his reign, which lasted close to ten years and despite not adding more silverware towards the club he would make sure his reign at the club would end on a high when the club won the 1982 league title before taking the [[Chinese national football team]] management position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesc/chinahist.html#82  |title=China 1982|publisher=rsssf.com |date=2009-10-22 |accessdate=2012-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the national team the team easily qualified for the [[1984 AFC Asian Cup]] where he led the team to a runner-up position within the tournament. After a successful campaign the Chinese public were expecting more from the national team and after a good start in [[1986 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)|qualification for the 1986 FIFA World Cup]] the Chinese team were unexpected knocked out from qualification when they lost to [[Hong Kong national football team|Hong Kong]] who beat them [[19 May incident|2-1 on March 19, 1985]] in a game that would see Zeng fired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2008.sohu.com/20080702/n257886414.shtml |title=中国队主教练曾雪麟:当年球迷寄绳子叫我自杀|publisher=sohu.com |date=2008-07-02 |accessdate=2012-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On 11 February 2016, Zeng died at his home in [[Shenzhen]], aged 86.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.163.com/16/0211/11/BFHR3B8M00051C8M.html|title=前中国男足主教练曾雪麟逝世 足坛元老享年86岁|publisher=Netease|date=2016-02-11|accessdate=2016-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
