      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7835">'''Academy at Dundee Ranch''' was a [[behavior modification]] facility for United States teenagers, located on La Ceiba Cascajal, {{convert|10|km}} west of [[Orotina]], [[Alajuela Province|province of Alajuela]], [[Costa Rica]]. It was promoted as a [[boarding school|residential school]], offering a program of behavior modification, motivational "emotional growth seminars," a progressive academic curriculum, and a structured daily schedule, for teenagers struggling in their homes, schools, or communities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071223131318/http://www.dundeeranch.org/ Academy at Dundee Ranch website], accessed January 31, 2007, archived December 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/09/world/parents-shopping-for-discipline-turn-to-harsh-programs-abroad.html|title=Parents, Shopping for Discipline, Turn to Harsh Programs Abroad|last=Weiner|first=Tim|date=May 9, 2003|work=The New York Times|access-date=July 18, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The facility was associated with [[World Wide Association of Specialty Programs and Schools]] (WWASP).&lt;ref name=riots/&gt;

In May 2003, authorities in Costa Rica shut down due to claims of child abuse, and investigated the school and its managers.  A new WWASP facility called [[Pillars of Hope]] was opened at the site of Academy at Dundee Ranch in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080629083624/http://www.pillarsofhope.com/program.amp Program Overview], Pillars of Hope website. "The setting of Pillars of Hope was first established in 1991 as Dundee Ranch Hotel Adventure Resort."&lt;/ref&gt; It is also marketed as [[Seneca Ranch Second Chance Youth Ranch]].[https://wiki.fornits.com/index.php?title=Pillars_of_Hope#Possible_closure_and_Rebranding]

==Controversy==
During its operation, Dundee Ranch was the subject of multiple allegations of abuse.

A judgment in Louisiana caused Costa Rican authorities to investigate the facilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ticotimes.net/archive/01_17_03_2.htm Officials to Investigate 'Tough Love' Facility Here (The Tico Times)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060219181432/http://www.ticotimes.net/archive/01_17_03_2.htm |date=February 19, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A riot occurred at the facility in May 2003 leading to its closure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/27/world/us-youths-rebel-at-harsh-school-in-costa-rica-and-many-head-for-home.html|title=U.S. Youths Rebel at Harsh School in Costa Rica and Many Head for Home|last=Weiner|first=Tim|date=May 27, 2003|work=The New York Times|access-date=July 18, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Costa Rican immigration authorities found that 100 of the 193 children enrolled in the program did not have appropriate migration papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/23/world/costa-rica-intervenes-at-troubled-us-owned-academy.html|title=Costa Rica Intervenes at Troubled U.S.-Owned Academy|last=Weiner|first=Tim|date=May 23, 2003|work=The New York Times|access-date=July 18, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the closure [[U.S. House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[George Miller (California politician)|George Miller]] asked [[U.S. Attorney General]] [[John Ashcroft]] to investigate WWASP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ticotimes.net/dailyarchive/2003_11/week1/11_05_03.htm U.S. Federal Probe of WWASP Requested] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060109092215/http://www.ticotimes.net/dailyarchive/2003_11/week1/11_05_03.htm |date=January 9, 2006 }}, The Tico Times, November 5, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nospank.net/ashcroft.htm|title=Correspondence between Congressman Miller and Attorney General John Ashcroft|last=|first=|date=May 11, 2004|website=nospank.net|access-date=July 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Narvin Lichfield, who was the director at the time of the facility's closure, was jailed in Costa Rica for a brief period at the time of the closure. He was later tried in Costa Rica on charges of coercion, holding minors against their will, and "crimes of an international character" (violating a law based on international treaties, specifically referring to torture).

On February 21, 2007 a three-judge panel found Narvin Lichfield innocent of the charges of abuse. During the trial the prosecutor told the court that there was insufficient evidence and testimony to link Lichfield to the crimes for which he was accused. ''The Tico Times'' reported that the judges said they believed the students at Dundee had been abused, but there was no proof that Lichfield ordered the abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Lealand Baxter Neal, [http://www.ticotimes.net/dailyarchive/2007_02/022207.htm#story1 Lichfield Declared Innocent] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915034852/http://www.ticotimes.net/dailyarchive/2007_02/022207.htm#story1 |date=September 15, 2007 }}, Tico Times - Daily News&lt;/ref&gt; Three other Academy employees, all [[Jamaica]]ns, had been wanted in connection with the same case, but they fled Costa Rica following the closure of the Academy.&lt;ref&gt;Leland Baxter-Neal, [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120915072615/http://caica.org/Tough-Love%20article%2007-06.pdf Tough-Love’ Camp Owner Faces Trial], ''The Tico Times'', July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the acquittal, Lichfield claimed in an e-mail to ''A.M. Costa Rica'' that when the school was raided, police stood by and watched youths sexually assault each other, that police held parents and staff at gunpoint and that one parent was ordered at gunpoint to hang up the phone when she attempted to phone the U.S. Embassy for help, and that police left the school in a shambles.&lt;ref name="amcostarica.com"&gt;[http://www.amcostarica.com/022307.htm Dundee Ranch owner rips police after his acquittal], ''A.M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5984">An '''adult learner''' (North America) or '''mature student''' (UK) (sometimes also called '''adult student''', '''returning adult''', and '''adult returner)''' is a person who is 25 years and up who is involved in forms of learning. Adult learners fall in a specific criteria of being experienced, and do not have the high school diploma. Many of the adult learners go back to school to finish a degree, or earn a new one.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/2002/analyses/nontraditional/sa01.asp Special Analysis 2002 - Nontraditional Undergraduates&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070416180603/http://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/2002/analyses/nontraditional/sa01.asp |date=April 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Malcolm Knowles]]'s work distinguished adult learners as distinct from adolescent and child learners in his principle of [[andragogy]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He established 5 assumptions about the adult learner. This included self-concept, adult learner experience, readiness to learn, orientation to learning, and motivation to learning.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Criteria==
In the US, adult learners fall into the category of [[nontraditional student]]s, whom the [[National Center for Education Statistics]] defines as meeting at least one of the following seven criteria:
* Delays enrollment (does not enter post secondary education in the same calendar year that he or she finished high school).
* Attends part time for at least part of the academic year.
* Works full time (35 hours or more per week) while enrolled.
* Is considered financially independent for purposes of determining eligibility for financial aid.
* Has dependents other than a spouse (usually children, but sometimes others).
* Is a single parent (either not married or married but separated and has dependents).
* Does not have a high school diploma (completed high school with a GED or other high school completion certificate or did not finish high school).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Not all nontraditional students are adult learners, as the term refers to the brain development of the person, but adult learners are considered nontraditional students. This can be due to the wide range of cultural, job, and educational backgrounds.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sreb.org/general-information/who-adult-learner|title=Who is the Adult Learner? - Southern Regional Education Board|website=www.sreb.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, a student is normally classified as a mature student if he or she is an (undergraduate) student who is at least 25+ years old at the start of his or her course, or in the Irish case on the first of January of the year of entry, and usually having been away from school for at least two years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The normal entry requirements for school-leavers wishing to start an undergraduate degree are often not applied to mature students.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; {{citation needed|date = March 2011}}

==In higher education==

Adult students are frequently referred to as [[Non-traditional student|nontraditional students]] in higher education. Adult students are contrasted with [[traditional students]], who are typically aged 18–22, attend full-time, live on campus, do not work, and have few, if any, family responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pascarella|first1=Ernest T.|last2=Terenzini|first2=Patrick T|title=Studying College Students in the 21st Century: Meeting New Challenges|journal=The Review of Higher Education|date=Winter 1998|volume=21|issue=2|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, 36 percent of postsecondary students were age 25 or older and 47 percent were independent students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate =2010-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special characteristics==
As opposed to a child or adolescent, adult learners typically have more life experience and their brains are more fully developed. When confronted with new knowledge or an experience, adult learners construe new meaning based on their life experiences and their more developed brains process these experiences differently than someone with a less developed brain (children and adolescents).&lt;ref name="Merriam"&gt;[[Sharan Merriam|Merriam, S.

The '''Arts &amp; Business Council of New York (ABC/NY),'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artsandbusiness-ny.org Arts &amp; Business Council of New York official website]&lt;/ref&gt; also known as Arts &amp; Business Council, Inc., is a [[Non-profit organization|nonprofit organization]] whose mission is to develop more creative partnerships between the arts and business communities in New York, enhancing the business skills of the arts sector and the creative engagement of the business sector.  ABC/NY accomplishes this mission through programming in volunteer development, professional development, and leadership development.  ABC/NY, now a division of the national service organization [[Americans for the Arts]], was formed in 1965 to join the resources of [[New York City]]’s arts and business communities in order to strengthen both sectors.

ABC/NY serves arts organizations of all disciplines ([[Arts integration|arts education]], [[dance]], [[design]], [[film]], [[literature]], media, [[museum]]s, [[music]], [[theatre|theater]], [[visual arts]], etc.) and sizes (annual operating budgets of less than $100,000 to greater than $100 million), as well as businesses of all sizes across industry sectors, throughout the five [[borough (New York City)|boroughs]] of New York City and, when possible, throughout [[New York (state)|New York State]].

ABC/NY’s programs and services draw on business-based skills, knowledge, and relationships to strengthen the management capacity and infrastructure of arts organizations.  Activities include programs in volunteer development, professional development, and leadership development.

== Programs ==

=== Volunteer development ===

Business Volunteers for the Arts (BVA)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artsandbusiness-ny.org/volunteerism/bva/default.asp ABC/NY Business Volunteers for the Arts web page]&lt;/ref&gt; places businessmen and women with expertise in areas such as strategic planning, marketing, finance, IT, and human resources, as pro bono management consultants with nonprofit arts groups.  ABC/NY staff recruit, interview, train, and match BVAs with organizations where each volunteer’s skills and interests will be of greatest use.  The scope of each assignment is co-determined by the volunteer and the organization. Projects may be simple, such as editing marketing materials or reviewing a contract or lease, or more complex, such as creating a financial reporting system, helping develop a debt recovery package, or assisting with strategic planning.

Arts Board Recruitment/Training&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artsandbusiness-ny.org/volunteerism/001.asp ABC/NY Board Services ]&lt;/ref&gt; strengthens the leadership capacity of nonprofit arts organizations.  Potential board members are trained in governance, fiscal management, fundraising, and advocacy.   This program also provides board development workshops for arts organizations, and ABC/NY staff interview and work with each arts organization to ensure it is prepared to effectively utilize its board members.  As with the project-based BVA placements, ABC/NY is a matchmaker, introducing business people to arts organizations—for the benefit of both.

=== Leadership development ===

The Multicultural Arts Management Internship program&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artsandbusiness-ny.org/leadership_development/arts_management/default.asp ABC/NY Multicultual Arts Management Internship program]&lt;/ref&gt; promotes diversity in administrative staffing, introducing undergraduates to career options with a business focus in the arts.  Each year, a select group of students—with an emphasis on people of African-American, Asian-American, and Latino/a backgrounds—is matched with New York City arts organizations to complete summer-long, project-based internships in a variety of disciplines.  Each intern is also paired with a mentor from the business community who has a passion for and involvement in the arts and who can provide additional career guidance and perspective.

Emerging Leaders of New York Arts (ELNYA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elnya.org |title=Emerging Leaders of New York Arts official website |publisher=Elnya.org |date=2012-03-17 |accessdate=2012-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced in fall 2007, is the New York branch of a nationwide program&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artsusa.org/networks/emerging_leaders/default.asp Emerging Leaders Network]&lt;/ref&gt; that targets arts professionals under 35 or with less than five years’ experience in the field.  ELNYA provides these young professionals with opportunities to develop the contacts, skills, and knowledge they need to advance to senior leadership positions. This program offers social, professional development, and networking events, such as group discussions, panel Q&amp;A, and an arts management book club, each planned and implemented by members.  ELNYA’s emphasis on hands-on leadership leads to empowered arts administrators who will engage and advance the field with creative problem solving and sustainable management practices.

The Arts Leadership Institute (ALI)&lt;ref&gt;[http://artsandbusiness-ny.org/leadership_development/ali/default.asp Arts Leadership Institute official website]&lt;/ref&gt; offers executive education for mid-career arts managers who seek to succeed to and succeed in nonprofit arts executive director positions. ALI provides both technical management skill building(e.g. budgeting, planning, fundraising, and board development) and personal leadership development (self-assessment, communications, delegation, decision-making, and time management).

=== Professional development ===

ABC/NY helps arts organizations and individual artists to develop new audiences and earned income through a series of arts-specific marketing workshops on topics including [[brand management|branding]], [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]]ship, electronic communications, [[market research]], and audience development and retention.  These are complemented with a comprehensive marketing website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artsmarketing.org |title=ArtsMarketing.org, the Official Website of the National Arts Marketing Project |publisher=Artsmarketing.org |date=2012-03-05 |accessdate=2012-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; created by national staff, and an annual national conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artsmarketing.org/conference |title=National Arts Marketing Project Conference |publisher=Artsmarketing.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ABC/NY also offers practical training for arts managers, business volunteers, and nonprofit arts board members in areas such as budgeting and financial analysis, fundraising, and human resources.

'''Athena Fund''' is a non-profit organization established in 2006. Its mission is to empower teachers in [[Israel]] by providing them with tools for self-fulfillment and professional advancement.&lt;ref name="Economist"&gt;[http://www.eiuperspectives.economist.com/sites/default/files/EIU_Yidan%20prize%20forecast_Education%20to%202030.pdf  Yidan Prize Forecast - Education to 2030 (page 18)], The Economist Intelligence Unit, May, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Fund was founded by business leaders under the direction of Uri Ben-Ari (CEO of UBA Ventures and former Executive VP of [[Ness Technologies]]).&lt;ref name="mission"&gt;[http://www.calcalist.co.il/local/articles/0,7340,L-3603577,00.html  The Internet Revolution Caused Teachers to Lose Their Role as a Knowledge Source], Calcalist, May 28, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Introduced in 2007, Athena Fund's flagship initiative is the "Laptop Computer for Every Teacher in Israel" program. Launched with the support of [[Prime Minister's Office (Israel)|Israel's Prime Minister's Office]], the program has been implemented in collaboration with the [[Israeli Ministry of Education]], the Israel Teachers Union, and Bank Massad, an Israeli bank that specializes in providing banking services to teachers.

Since 2012, Athena Fund has launched three additional programs in Israel: “Laptop Computer for Every Kindergarten Teacher” (2012); “Tablet for Every Science Teacher” (2014); and “iPad for Every Special-Education Teacher” (2015).&amp;nbsp;

== Laptop computer for every teacher in Israel ==
The mission of the Laptop Computer for Every Teacher in Israel program (launched in 2007) is to empower teachers, enhance their access to the digital world, and raise their social status. The goal of the program is to provide a laptop computer and 120 hours of professional training to each and every elementary, middle and high school teacher in Israel by year-end 2018.

=== Center for Advanced Study (CAS) ===
In addition to the Beckman Fellowships administered through the [[Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology]],  the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation supports additional programs through the '''Center for Advanced Study (CAS)''' at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]].&lt;ref name=CASFellows&gt;{{cite web|title=CAS Fellows Archive|url=http://cas.illinois.edu/archive/cas-fellows-archive/|website=Center for Advanced Study|publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The CAS awards a series of '''Beckman Fellowships''' and '''Beckman Research Awards''' which support faculty at Urbana-Champaign in their research activities.  These awards were funded through an endowment from Arnold and Mabel Beckman, given in the late 1970's, prior to the establishment of the Beckman Institute.  They are administered separately and are awarded in departments throughout the university, not just within the sciences.&lt;ref name=Brown2009&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Theodore L.|title=Bridging divides : the origins of the Beckman Institute at Illinois|date=2009|publisher=University of Illinois|location=Urbana|isbn=978-0252034848|url=http://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/catalog/38tnd6hm9780252034848.html|accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3–4}}

"'''Bombshells'''" is the fifteenth episode of the [[House (season 7)|seventh season]] of the American medical drama series ''[[House (TV series)|House]]''. It aired on March 7, 2011.

==Plot==
A teenager is admitted to the hospital after spitting up blood. [[Chris Taub|Taub]] also discovers that the boy has been depressed and appears to have been cutting himself.  More concern arises when the team breaks into the boy's house and finds his school yearbook with his classmates' faces crossed out and threatening words written about the school, and when Taub checks the contents of the boy's flash drive, he finds disturbing videos of him blowing up homemade [[pipe bomb]]s and appearing to show misanthropic and sociopathic tendencies.

It is discovered that a piece of one of the bombs ended up lodged in his system, and the foreign material is what has caused his various medical maladies.  Taub, however, is torn between sending the videos to the authorities throughout the case, but in the end, decides to mail the flash drive to the police.

Meanwhile, [[Lisa Cuddy|Cuddy]] finds blood in her urine and undergoes tests for possible kidney cancer, while [[Gregory House|House]] grapples with emotionally supporting her, avoiding her, and denying that she is actually sick. Cuddy goes through several dreams while hospitalized before her kidney problems were found to be a benign tumor.

After speaking with her sister, Cuddy realizes that when House came to see her during her illness, he was under the influence of [[Vicodin]]. Realizing that he is unable to open up completely and share the pain that she considers to be part of any meaningful relationship, she ends their relationship.

The episode is concluded with a scene that echoes the last scene of the previous season's finale ("[[Help Me (House)|Help Me]]"): House is sitting on his bathroom floor with a bottle of Vicodin in his hand.  He expectantly looks at the doorway. Resigned, and with no Cuddy to save him, he takes the pills.

==Popular culture references==
Cuddy's dream sequences includes a parody of the CBS sitcom ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'',&lt;ref name="dailymail"&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1364102/Charlie-Sheen-Hugh-Lauries-Two-And-A-Half-Men-dream-sequence-House.html "Charlie Sheen: Hugh Laurie's Two And A Half Men dream sequence in House"][[Daily Mail]]&lt;/ref&gt; while another recreates the final scene in ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'' with House and Cuddy in the roles of Butch and Sundance. The final dream is a stylized version of "[[Get Happy (song)|Get Happy]]" starring House in a large musical production.

===Critical response {{anchor|Critics}}===
Zack Handlen of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave this episode a B+ rating, praising "Bombshells" despite the campy dream sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Handlen|first1=Zack|title=House: "Bombshells"|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/bombshells,52760/|accessdate=October 18, 2016|work=[[The A.V.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41798">'''Conformity''' is the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group [[Norm (social)|norms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cialdini | first1 = R. B. | last2 = Goldstein | first2 = N. J. | year = 2004 | title = Social influence: Compliance and conformity | url = http://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~schaller/Psyc591Readings/CialdiniGoldstein2004.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 55 | issue = | pages = 591–621 | doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.55.090902.142015| pmid = 14744228 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Norms are implicit, specific rules, shared by a group of individuals, that guide their interactions with others. People often choose to conform to society rather than to pursue personal desires because it is often easier to follow the path others have made already, rather than creating a new one. This tendency to conform occurs in small groups and/or society as a whole, and may result from subtle unconscious influences, or direct and overt [[social pressure]]. Conformity can occur in the presence of others, or when an individual is alone. For example, people tend to follow social norms when eating or watching television, even when alone.

People often conform from a desire for security within a group—typically a group of a similar age, culture, religion, or educational status. This is often referred to as [[groupthink]]: a pattern of thought characterized by self-deception, forced manufacture of consent, and conformity to group values and ethics, which ignores realistic appraisal of other courses of action. Unwillingness to conform carries the risk of [[social rejection]]. Conformity is often associated with adolescence and [[youth culture]], but strongly affects humans of all ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McLeod|first=S|title=Conformity|journal=Simply Psychology|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[peer pressure]] may manifest negatively, conformity can be regarded as either good or bad. Driving on the correct side of the road could be seen as beneficial conformity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aronson|first=E|title=Social Psychology (6th ed.)|year=2007|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|isbn=978-0-13-233487-7|author2=Wilson, T. D. |author3=Akert, R. M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the right environmental influence, conforming, in early childhood years, allows one to learn and thus, adopt the appropriate behaviours necessary to interact and develop correctly within one's society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=L|first=G|title=Conformity|journal=Peabody Journal of Education|date=March 1931|volume=8|issue=5|page=312|jstor=1488401|doi=10.1080/01619563109535026}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Conformity influences formation and maintenance of [[social norm]]s, and helps societies function smoothly and predictably via the self-elimination of behaviors seen as contrary to unwritten rules. In this sense it can be perceived as a positive force that prevents acts that are perceptually disruptive or dangerous.

As conformity is a [[group dynamics|group]] phenomenon, factors such as group size, unanimity, cohesion, [[Social status|status]], prior commitment and [[public opinion]] help determine the level of conformity an individual displays.

== Peer ==
Some adolescents gain acceptance and recognition from their peers by conformity.
This peer moderated conformity increases from the transition of childhood to adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Bradford|title=Perceptions of peer pressure, peer conformity dispositions, and self-reported behavior among adolescents|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=1986|volume=22|issue=4|pages=521–530|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.22.4.521}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social responses ==
According to Donelson Forsyth, after submitting to group pressures, individuals may find themselves facing one of several responses to conformity. These types of responses to conformity vary in their degree of public agreement versus private agreement.

When an individual finds themselves in a position where they publicly agree with the group's decision yet privately disagrees with the group's consensus, they are experiencing ''compliance'' or ''acquiescence''.  In turn, ''conversion'', otherwise known as ''private acceptance'', involves both publicly and privately agreeing with the group's decision. Thus, this represents a true change of opinion to match the majority.

Another type of social response, which does not involve conformity with the majority of the group, is called ''convergence''. In this type of social response, the group member agrees with the group's decision from the outset and thus does not need to shift their opinion on the matter at hand.&lt;ref name="Forsyth, D. R. 2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Forsyth|first=D. R.|title=Group dynamics|year=2013|publisher=Wadsworth|location=New York|isbn=978-1-133-95653-2}} [Chapter 7]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Forsyth shows that nonconformity can also fall into one of two response categories. Firstly, an individual who does not conform to the majority can display ''independence''. ''Independence'', or ''dissent'', can be defined as the unwillingness to bend to group pressures. Thus, this individual stays true to his or her personal standards instead of the swaying toward group standards. Secondly, a nonconformist could be displaying ''anticonformity'' or ''counterconformity'' which involves the taking of opinions that are opposite to what the group believes. This type of nonconformity can be motivated by a need to rebel against the status quo instead of the need to be accurate in one's opinion.

To conclude, social responses to conformity can be seen to vary along a continuum from conversion to anticonformity. For example, a popular experiment in conformity research, known as the ''Asch situation'' or [[Asch conformity experiments]], primarily includes ''compliance'' and ''independence''. Also, other responses to conformity can be identified in groups such as juries, sports teams and work teams.&lt;ref name="Forsyth, D. R. 2009" /&gt;

== Main experiments ==

=== Sherif's experiment (1936) ===
Muzafer Sherif was interested in knowing how many people would change their opinions to bring them in line with the opinion of a group. In his experiment, participants were placed in a dark room and asked to stare at a small dot of light 15 feet away. They were then asked to estimate the amount it moved. The trick was there was no movement, it was caused by a visual illusion known as the [[autokinetic effect]]. On the first day, each person perceived different amounts of movement, but from the second to the fourth day, the same estimate was agreed on and others conformed to it.&lt;ref name="Hogg 2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hogg|first=M. A.|title=Social psychology|year=2005|publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall|location=Harlow|author2=Vaughan, G. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sherif suggested this was a simulation for how social norms develop in a society, providing a common frame of reference for people.

Subsequent experiments were based on more realistic situations. In an eyewitness identification task, participants were shown a suspect individually and then in a lineup of other suspects. They were given one second to identify him, making it a difficult task. One group was told that their input was very important and would be used by the legal community. To the other it was simply a trial. Being more motivated to get the right answer increased the tendency to conform. Those who wanted to be more accurate conformed 51% of the time as opposed to 35% in the other group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baron|first=R. S. |author2=Vandello, J. A. |author3=Brunsman, B.|title=The forgotten variable in conformity research: Impact of task importance on social influence|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1996|volume=71|issue=5|pages=915–927|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.71.5.915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asch's experiment (1951) ===
{{Main|Asch conformity experiments}}

[[File:Asch experiment.png|thumb|250px|Which line matches the first line, A, B, or C? In the [[Asch conformity experiments]], people frequently followed the majority judgment, even when the majority was wrong.]]
Solomon E. Asch conducted a modification of Sherif’s study, assuming that when the situation was very clear, conformity would be drastically reduced. He exposed people in a group to a series of lines, and the participants were asked to match one line with a standard line. All participants except one were accomplices and gave the wrong answer in 12 of the 18 trials.&lt;ref name="Asch 1955 31–35" /&gt;

The results showed a surprisingly high degree of conformity: 74% of the participants conformed on at least one trial. On average people conformed one third of the time.&lt;ref name="Asch 1955 31–35"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Asch|first=S. E.|title=Opinions and Social Pressure|journal=Scientific American|year=1955|volume=193|issue=5|pages=31–35|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1155-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; A question is how the group would affect individuals in a situation where the correct answer is less obvious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guimond|first=S|title=Psychologie Sociale : Perspective Multiculturelle|year=2010|publisher=Mardaga|location=Warve:|pages=19–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his first test, Asch wanted to investigate whether the size or unanimity of the majority had greater influence on test subjects.
"Which aspect of the influence of a majority is more important – the size of the majority or its unanimity? The experiment was modified to examine this question. In one series the size of the opposition was varied from one to 15 persons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Asch|first=S. E.|title=Social Psychology|year=1952|publisher=Prentice Hal|location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ:}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results clearly showed that as more people opposed the subject, the subject became more likely to conform. However, the increasing majority was only influential up to a point: from three or more opponents, there is more than 30% of conformity.&lt;ref name="Asch 1955 31–35" /&gt;

== Varieties ==
Harvard psychologist [[Herbert Kelman]] identified three major types of conformity.&lt;ref name="Kelman 1958 51–60"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kelman|first=H. C|title=Compliance, Identification, and Internalization: Three Processes of Attitude Change|journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution|year=1958|volume=2|issue=1|pages=51–60|doi=10.1177/002200275800200106}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Compliance (psychology)|Compliance]]'' is public conformity, while possibly keeping one's own original beliefs for yourself. Compliance is motivated by the need for approval and the fear of being rejected.
* ''[[Identification (psychology)|Identification]]'' is conforming to someone who is liked and respected, such as a celebrity or a favorite uncle. This can be motivated by the attractiveness of the source,&lt;ref name="Kelman 1958 51–60" /&gt; and this is a deeper type of conformism than compliance.
* ''[[Internalization]]'' is accepting the belief or behavior and conforming both publicly and privately, if the source is credible. It is the deepest influence on people and it will affect them for a long time.

Although Kelman's distinction has been influential, research in [[Social psychology (psychology)|social psychology]] has focused primarily on two varieties of conformity. These are ''informational'' conformity, or [[informational social influence]], and ''normative'' conformity, also called [[normative social influence]]. In Kelman's terminology, these correspond to internalization and compliance, respectively. There are naturally more than two or three variables in society influential on human [[psychology]] and conformity; the notion of "varieties" of conformity based upon "social influence" is ambiguous and indefinable in this context.

For Deutsch and Gérard (1955), conformity results from a motivational conflict  (between the fear of being socially rejected and the wish to say what we think is correct) that leads to the normative influence, and a cognitive conflict (others create doubts in what we think) which leads to the informational influence.&lt;ref name="Deutsch 1955 629–636"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deutsch|first=M|author2=Gérard, H. B|title=A study of normative and informational social influences upon individual judgement|journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology|year=1955|volume=51|issue=3|pages=629–636|doi=10.1037/h0046408|pmid=13286010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Informational influence ===
{{Main|Informational social influence}}
Informational social influence occurs when one turns to the members of one's group to obtain and accept accurate information about reality. A person is most likely to use informational social influence in certain situations: when a situation is ambiguous, people become uncertain about what to do and they are more likely to depend on others for the answer; and during a crisis when immediate action is necessary, in spite of panic. Looking to other people can help ease fears, but unfortunately they are not always right. The more knowledgeable a person is, the more valuable they are as a resource. Thus people often turn to [[expert]]s for help. But once again people must be careful, as experts can make mistakes too. Informational social influence often results in ''internalization'' or ''private acceptance'', where a person genuinely believes that the information is right.&lt;ref name="Hogg 2005" /&gt;

=== Normative influence ===
{{Main|Normative social influence}}
Normative social influence occurs when one conforms to be liked or accepted by the members of the group. This need of social approval and acceptance is part of our state of humans.&lt;ref name="Hogg 2005" /&gt; In addition to this, we know that when people do not conform with their group and therefore are deviants, they are less liked and even punished by the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schachter,|first=S|title=Deviation, Rejection, and communication|journal=Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|year=1951|volume=46|issue=2|pages=190–208|doi=10.1037/h0062326}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normative influence usually results in ''public compliance'', doing or saying something without believing in it. The experiment of Asch in 1951 is one example of normative influence.

In a reinterpretation of the original data from these [[Asch conformity experiments|experiments]] Hodges and Geyer (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hodges,|first=B. H.|author2=Geyer, A. L.|title=A Nonconformist Account of the Asch Experiments: Values, Pragmatics, and Moral Dilemmas|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|year=2006|volume=10|issue=1|pages=2–19|doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr1001_1|pmid=16430326}}&lt;/ref&gt;  found that Asch's subjects were not so conformist after all: The experiments provide powerful evidence for people's tendency to tell the truth even when others do not. They also provide compelling evidence of people's concern for others and their views.
By closely examining the situation in which Asch's subjects find themselves they find that the situation places multiple demands on participants: They include truth (i.e., expressing one's own view accurately), trust (i.e., taking seriously the value of others' claims), and social solidarity (i.e., a commitment to integrate the views of self and others without deprecating either). In addition to these epistemic values, there are multiple moral claims as well: These include the need for participants to care for the integrity and well-being of other participants, the experimenter, themselves, and the worth of scientific research.

Deutsch &amp; Gérard (1955) designed different situations that variated from Asch' experiment and found that when participants were writing their answer privately, they were giving the correct one&lt;ref name="Deutsch 1955 629–636" /&gt;

Normative influence, a function of [[social impact theory]], has three components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Latané,|first=B|title=The psychology of social impact|journal=American Psychologist|year=1981|volume=36|issue=4|pages=343–356|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.36.4.343}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''number of people'' in the group has a surprising effect. As the number increases, each person has less of an impact. A group's ''strength'' is how important the group is to a person. Groups we value generally have more social influence. ''Immediacy'' is how close the group is in time and space when the influence is taking place. Psychologists have constructed a mathematical model using these three factors and are able to predict the amount of conformity that occurs with some degree of accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forgas|first=J. P.|title=Social influence: Direct and indirect processes. The Sydney symposium of social psychology|year=2001|publisher=Psychology Press.|location=New York:|pages=61–76|author2=Williams, K. D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baron and his colleagues conducted a second ''eyewitness study'' that focused on normative influence. In this version, the task was easier. Each participant had five seconds to look at a slide instead of just one second. Once again, there were both high and low motives to be accurate, but the results were the reverse of the first study. The low motivation group conformed 33% of the time (similar to Asch's findings). The high motivation group conformed less at 16%. These results show that when accuracy is not very important, it is better to get the wrong answer than to risk social disapproval.

An experiment using procedures similar to Asch's found that there was significantly less conformity in six-person groups of [[friend]]s as compared to six-person groups of strangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McKelvey|first=W.|author2=Kerr, N. H.|title=Differences in conformity among friends and strangers|journal=Psychological Reports|year=1988|volume=62|issue=3|pages=759–762|doi=10.2466/pr0.1988.62.3.759}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because friends already know and accept each other, there may be less normative pressure to conform in some situations. Field studies on cigarette and alcohol abuse, however, generally demonstrate evidence of friends exerting normative social influence on each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Urberg,|first=K. A.|author2=Degirmencioglu, S. M. |author3=Pilgrim, C. |title=Close friend and group influence on adolescent cigarette smoking and alcohol use|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=1997|volume=33|issue=5|pages=834–844|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.33.5.834}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Minority influence ==
{{Main|Minority influence}}
Although conformity generally leads individuals to think and act more like groups, individuals are occasionally able to reverse this tendency and change the people around them. This is known as ''minority influence'', a special case of informational influence. Minority influence is most likely when people can make a clear and consistent case for their point of view. If the minority fluctuates and shows uncertainty, the chance of influence is small. However, a minority that makes a strong, convincing case increases the probability of changing  the majority's beliefs and behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moscovici,|first=S. N.|title="Minority influence". Social psychology: Classic and contemporary integrations|year=1974|publisher=Rand McNally|location=Chicago:|pages=217–249}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minority members who are perceived as experts, are high in status, or have benefited the group in the past are also more likely to succeed.

Another form of minority influence can sometimes override conformity effects and lead to unhealthy group dynamics. A 2007 review of two dozen studies by the University of Washington found that a single "bad apple" (an inconsiderate or negligent group member) can substantially increase conflicts and reduce performance in work groups. Bad apples often create a negative emotional climate that interferes with healthy group functioning. They can be avoided by careful selection procedures and managed by reassigning them to positions that require less social interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Felps|first=W|author2=Mitchell, T R. |author3=Byington, E |title=How, When, and Why Bad Apples Spoil the Barrel: Negative Group Members and Dysfunctional|journal=GroupsResearch in Organizational Behavior|year=2006|volume=27|pages=175–222|doi=10.1016/s0191-3085(06)27005-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specific predictors ==

=== Culture ===
[[Stanley Milgram]] found that individuals in Norway (from a collectivistic culture) exhibited a higher degree of conformity than individuals in France (from an individualistic culture).&lt;ref name="Milgram"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Milgram | first1 = S | year = 1961 | title = Nationality and conformity | url = https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=milgram-nationality-conformity | journal = Scientific American | volume = 205 | issue =  | page = 6 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121004201132/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=milgram-nationality-conformity | archivedate = 2012-10-04 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Berry studied two different populations: the Temne (collectivists) and the Inuit (individualists) and found that the Temne conformed more than the Inuit when exposed to a conformity task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berry,|first=J W.|title=Independence and conformity in subsistence-level societies|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1967|volume=7|issue=4, Pt.1|pages=415–418|doi=10.1037/h0025231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bond and Smith compared 134 studies in a meta-analysis and found that there is a positive correlation between a country's level of collectivistic values and conformity rates in the Asch paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bond,|first=M. H|author2=Smith, P. B.|title=Culture and Conformity: A meta-analysis of studies using the Asch's (1952b, 1956) line judgement task|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1996|volume=119|pages=111–137|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.119.1.111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bond and Smith also reported that conformity has declined in the United States over time.

Influenced by the writings of late-19th- and early-20th-century Western travelers, scholars or diplomats who visited Japan, such as [[Basil Hall Chamberlain]], [[George Trumbull Ladd]] and [[Percival Lowell]], as well as by [[Ruth Benedict]]'s influential book ''[[The Chrysanthemum and the Sword]]'', many scholars of Japanese studies speculated that there would be a higher propensity to conform in Japanese culture than in American culture. However, this view was not formed on the basis of [[Scientific method|empirical evidence collected in a systematic way]], but rather on the basis of anecdotes and casual observations, which are subject to a variety of [[cognitive bias]]es. Modern scientific studies comparing conformity in Japan and the United States show that Americans conform in general as much than the Japanese and, in some situations, even more. Psychology professor [[:ja:高野陽太郎|Yohtaro Takano]] from the [[University of Tokyo]], along with Eiko Osaka reviewed four behavioral studies and found that the rate of conformity errors that the Japanese subjects manifested in the Asch paradigm was similar with that manifested by Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Takano, Y., &amp; Osaka, E. (1999). An unsupported common view: Comparing Japan and the US on individualism/collectivism. ''Asian Journal of Social Psychology'', ''2''(3), 311-341.&lt;/ref&gt; The study published in 1970 by [[Robert Frager]] from the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] found that the percentage of conformity errors within Asch paradigm was significantly lower in Japan than in the United States, especially in the prize condition. Another study published in 2008, which compared the level of conformity among Japanese in-groups (peers from the same college clubs) with that found among Americans found no substantial difference in the level of conformity manifested by the two nations, even in the case of in-groups.&lt;ref&gt;Takano, Y., &amp; Sogon, S. (2008).

=== Gender ===

Societal norms often establish gender differences and researchers have reported differences in the way men and women conform to social influence.&lt;ref name="BondSmith"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bond | first1 = R. | last2 = Smith | first2 = P.B. | year = 1996 | title = Culture and conformity: A meta-analysis of studies using Asch's (1952b, 1956) line judgement task | url = http://www.radford.edu/~jaspelme/_private/gradsoc_articles/individualism_collectivism/conformity%20and%20culture.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 119 | issue = 1| pages = 111–137 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.119.1.111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reitan, 1964 45–51"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reitan,|first=H|author2=Shaw, M|title=Group Membership, Sex-Composition of the Group, and Conformity Behavior|journal=The Journal of Social Psychology|year=1964|volume=64|pages=45–51|doi=10.1080/00224545.1964.9919541|pmid=14217456}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Applezweig|first=M H|title=Conforming behavior and personality variables|year=1958|publisher=Connecticut College|location=New London|author2=Moeller, G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beloff,|first=H|title=Two forms of social conformity: Acquiescence and conventionality|journal=The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|year=1958|volume=56|issue=1|pages=99–104|doi=10.1037/h0046604}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coleman,|first=J |author2=Blake, R R |author3=Mouton, J S|title=Task difficulty and conformity pressures|journal=The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|year=1958|volume=57|issue=1|pages=120–122|doi=10.1037/h0041274}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CooperHM"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cooper | first1 = H.M. | year = 1979 | title = Statistically combining independent studies: A meta-analysis of sex differences in conformity research | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 37 | issue = | pages = 131–146 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.37.1.131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eagly78"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eagly | first1 = A.H. | year = 1978 | title = Sex differences in influenceability | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 85 | issue = | pages = 86–116 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.85.1.86}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Alice Eagly and Linda Carli performed a meta-analysis of 148 studies of influenceability. They found that women are more persuadable and more conforming than men in group pressure situations that involve surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eagly,|first=A. H|author2=Carli, L. L|title=Sex of researchers and sex-typed communications as determinants of sex differences in influenceability: A meta-analysis of social influence studies|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1981|volume=90|issue=1|pages=1–20|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.90.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eagly has proposed that this sex difference may be due to different sex roles in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eagly,|first=A. H.|title=Sex differences in social behavior: A social role interpretation|year=1987|publisher=Erlbaum|location=Hillsdale, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women are generally taught to be more agreeable whereas men are taught to be more independent.

The composition of the group plays a role in conformity as well. In a study by Reitan and Shaw, it was found that men and women conformed more when there were participants of both sexes involved versus participants of the same sex. Subjects in the groups with both sexes were more apprehensive when there was a discrepancy amongst group members, and thus the subjects reported that they doubted their own judgments.&lt;ref name="Reitan, 1964 45–51" /&gt;
Sistrunk and McDavid made the argument that women conformed more because of a methodological bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sistrunk,|first=F|author2=McDavid, J. W|title=Sex variable in conforming behavior|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1971|volume=17|issue=2|pages=200–207|doi=10.1037/h0030382}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that because stereotypes used in studies are generally male ones (sports, cars..) more than female ones (cooking, fashion..), women are feeling uncertain and conformed more, which was confirmed by their results.

=== Age ===
Research has noted age differences in conformity. For example, research with Australian children and adolescents ages 3 to 17 discovered that conformity decreases with age.&lt;ref name="WalkerMB"&gt;{{Cite journal
| last1 = Walker | first1 = M.
| last2 = Andrade | first2 = M.

| year = 1996
| pmid = 8758616
| pmc =
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study examined individuals that were ranged from ages 18 to 91.&lt;ref name="Pasupathi"&gt;{{Cite journal

| year = 1999
| pmid = 10224640
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results revealed a similar trend&amp;nbsp;– older participants displayed less conformity when compared to younger participants.

In the same way that gender has been viewed as corresponding to status, age has also been argued to have status implications. Berger, Rosenholtz and Zelditch suggest that age as a status role can be observed among college students. Younger students, such as those in their first year in college, are treated as lower-status individuals and older college students are treated as higher-status individuals.&lt;ref name="Berger1980"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Berger | first1 = J. | last2 = Rosenholtz | first2 = S.J. | last3 = Zelditch | first3 = M. | year = 1980 | title = Status organizing processes | journal = Annual Review of Sociology | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 479–508 | doi=10.1146/annurev.so.06.080180.002403}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, given these status roles, it would be expected that younger individuals (low status) conform to the majority whereas older individuals (high status) would be expected not to conform &lt;ref name="Eagly1982" /&gt;

Researchers have also reported an interaction of gender and age on conformity.&lt;ref name="Eagly1980"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eagly | first1 = A.H. | last2 = Chrvala | first2 = C. | year = 1980 | title = Sex differences in conformity: Status and gender role interpretations | url = http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ344964&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ344964 | journal = Psychology of Women Quarterly | volume = 10 | issue = 3| pages = 203–220 | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-6402.1986.tb00747.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eagly and Chrvala examined the role of age (under 19 years vs. 19 years and older), gender and surveillance (anticipating responses to be shared with group members vs. not anticipating responses being shared) on conformity to group opinions. They discovered that among participants that were 19 years or older, females conformed to group opinions more so than males when under surveillance (i.e., anticipated that their responses would be shared with group members). However, there were no gender differences in conformity among participants who were under 19 years of age and in surveillance conditions. There were also no gender differences when participants were not under surveillance. In a subsequent research article, Eagly suggests that women are more likely to conform than men because of lower status roles of women in society. She suggests that more submissive roles (i.e., conforming) are expected of individuals that hold low status roles.&lt;ref name="Eagly1982"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eagly | first1 = A.H. | last2 = Wood | first2 = W. | year = 1982 | title = Inferred sex differences in status as a determinant of gender stereotypes about social influence | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/43/5/915/ | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 43 | issue = 5| pages = 915–928 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.43.5.915}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Still, Eagly and Chrvala's results do conflict with previous research which have found higher conformity levels among younger rather than older individuals.

=== Size of the group ===
Although conformity pressures generally increase as the size of the majority increases, a meta-analysis suggests that conformity pressures in Asch's experiment peak once the majority reaches about four or five in number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bond | first1 = R. | last2 = Smith | first2 = P. B. | year = 1996 | title = Culture and conformity: A meta-analysis of studies using Asch's (1952b, 1956) Line Judgement task | url = http://www.radford.edu/~jaspelme/_private/gradsoc_articles/individualism_collectivism/conformity%20and%20culture.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 119 | issue = | pages = 111–137 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.119.1.111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, a study suggests that the effects of group size depend on the type of social influence operating.&lt;ref name = Campbell1989&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Campbell | first1 = J. D. | last2 = Fairey | first2 = P. J. | year = 1989 | title = Informational and normative routes to conformity: The effect of faction size as a function of norm extremity and attention to the stimulus | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 57 | issue = 3| pages = 457–468 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.57.3.457}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that in situations where the group is clearly wrong, conformity will be motivated by normative influence; the participants will conform in order to be accepted by the group. A participant may not feel much pressure to conform when the first person gives an incorrect response. However, conformity pressure will increase as each additional group member also gives the same incorrect response.&lt;ref name = Campbell1989 /&gt;

=== Different stimuli ===
In 1961 Stanley Milgram published a study in which he utilized Asch's conformity paradigm using audio tones instead of lines; he conducted his study in Norway and France.&lt;ref name="Milgram" /&gt; He found substantially higher levels of conformity than Asch, with participants conforming 50% of the time in France and 62% of the time in Norway during critical trials. Milgram also conducted the same experiment once more, but told participants that the results of the study would be applied to the design of aircraft safety signals. His conformity estimates were 56% in Norway and 46% in France, suggesting that individuals conformed slightly less when the task was linked to an important issue. Stanley Milgram's study demonstrated that Asch's study could be replicated with other stimuli, and that in the case of tones, there was a high degree of conformity.

=== Neural correlates ===
Evidence has been found for the involvement of the posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC) in conformity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Izuma | first1 = K | year = 2013 | title = The neural basis of social influence and attitude change | url = | journal = Current Opinion in Neurobiology | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 456–462 | doi = 10.1016/j.conb.2013.03.009 | pmid = 23608704 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an area associated with memory and decision-making. For example, Klucharev et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Klucharev | first1 = V. | last2 = Munneke | first2 = M. A. | last3 = Smidts | first3 = A. | last4 = Fernández | first4 = G. | year = 2011 | title = Downregulation of the posterior medial frontal cortex prevents social conformity | url = | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 31 | issue = 33| pages = 11934–11940 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1869-11.2011 | pmid = 21849554 }}&lt;/ref&gt; revealed in their study that by using repetitive [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] on the pMFC, participants reduced their tendency to conform to the group, suggesting a causal role for the brain region in social conformity. In another study, the mPFC was linked to [[normative social influence]], whilst the activity in the [[caudate nucleus|caudate]] was regarded as an index of [[social proof|informational influence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mason | first1 = M.

The [[amygdala]] and [[hippocampus]] have also been found to be recruited when individuals participated in a social manipulation experiment involving long-term memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Edelson | first1 = M. | last2 = Sharot | first2 = T. | last3 = Dolan | first3 = R.

In particular, Charpentier et al. found that the OFC mirrors the exposure to social influence at a subsequent time point, when a decision is being made without the social influence being present. The tendency to conform has also been observed in the structure of the OFC, with a greater [[grey matter]] volume in high conformers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Campbell-Meiklejohn | first1 = D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12719">The '''Cappies''' ('''Critics and Awards Program''') is an international program for recognizing, celebrating, and providing learning experiences for [[high school]] [[theater]] and [[journalism]] students and [[teenage]] [[playwrights]].

There are currently 13 Cappies programs in the U.S. and Canada, which range in size from five to 55 participating high schools. Within each program, every participating high school selects three to nine [[student]]s for a critic team. After receiving extensive training in theater criticism and review [[writing]], they attend plays and musicals at other high schools in their area. They write reviews (of roughly 400 words) on deadline. Volunteer teacher-mentors lead discussions and select the critic-written reviews that are later published by area newspapers, with student bylines.

The programs operate in and around [[Baltimore, Maryland]]; [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]; [[Dallas, Texas]]; [[El Paso, Texas]]; [[Ft. Lauderdale]] – Palm Beach, Florida; [[Houston, Texas]]; [[Kansas City, Missouri]]; [[Melbourne, Florida]]; [[Northern New Jersey]]; [[Orange County, California]]; [[Orlando, Florida]]; [[Philadelphia, PA]]; [[St. Louis, Missouri]]; [[Salt Lake City, Utah]]; [[Springfield, Missouri]]; [[Washington, DC]]; [[Edmonton]], Alberta; and [[Ottawa]], Ontario.

== History ==
The Cappies began in 1999, in response to the [[Columbine tragedy]], as an effort to bring more positive attention to teenagers engaged in creative pursuits. [[Capitol Steps]] founder Bill Strauss approached [[Fairfax County, Virginia]] public school administrator Judy Bowns, and together they developed the plan for the program. The program began in Fairfax and immediately became popular among high school drama departments in the area, growing from 14 schools in the fall of 1999 to 23 schools by that spring. The Cappies quickly spread to encompass the entire metro Washington, D.C., area. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and several other local papers published student-written reviews, often with photographs (They have since ceased this activity, but instead now post these reviews online in a section entitled "Tomorrow's Critics".). As a result, the Cappies became a showcase for local theater and journalism talent, with over 50 schools around Washington, the largest Cappies region. Since 2002, it has operated nationwide, with new regional groups appearing yearly.

== Organization and process ==
To start a Cappies program, one must organize a small local meeting with students, parents, and teachers. Four schools must participate for the application to be approved. A steering committee (including a Program director, chair, treasurer, and two other members) is formed, and a charter application must be applied for. While waiting for approval, one should find local newspapers/media outlets that are willing to publish 1-2 reviews on a weekly basis. Once approved, an $300 annual application fee must be paid to Cappies, plus a $5–10 per-critic fee that is assessed in November based on critic training sessions and enrollments in the online information services. Each regional steering committee determines the per-school fee requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cappies.com/JoinUs/RegionalCharter.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011015201/http://www.cappies.com/JoinUs/RegionalCharter.aspx |archivedate=2014-10-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each regional program has a steering committee, with a charter from The Cappies. These are [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s who oversee the work done by critics and teacher-mentors (who are also volunteers), and who then produce the Cappies Gala.

Participating schools select one show (a [[Play (theatre)|play]] or a [[Musical theatre|musical]]) as their Cappies show. Some smaller Cappies programs allow schools to select two shows. The schools also select teachers to be mentors, who supervise the student critics and help maintain the integrity of the review-writing process. Before the season begins, the mentors and critics receive training from Cappies officials and are often aided by local journalists.

On the night of a Cappies show, the critics arrive early, attend the [[performance]], and hold private discussions beforehand, during [[intermission]], and after the show. Afterward, they do a preliminary [[awards]] evaluation, selecting who will be on the Cappie awards ballot at the end of the year. After returning home, each [[critic]] writes a 200- to 600-word review. The mentors select the reviews they consider the most honest, objective, and best-written, which are then forwarded to local newspapers, many of whom publish these reviews with student bylines.

Critics are encouraged to write real reviews, differentiating between shows that are outstanding and those that fall short in various ways. Cappies reviews can and usually do include criticisms, but these should be objective and fair. Also, individuals responsible for a problem should not be named. For example, if a [[vocalist]] sings [[off-key]], a critic may state that as an issue in the show, but may not identify the vocalist. With these rules, the Cappies program reflects a consensus among theater teachers that at the high school level, criticisms are appropriate if they are constructive, but not if they are harsh, sarcastic, or personal.

After awards voting, each program then holds a Cappies [[wiktionary:gala|Gala]] to present Cappie awards and to celebrate the year's shows. Sometimes these galas are held at schools, and other times at major theater venues. The Cappies of the National Capital Area holds its gala in the Concert Hall of the [[Kennedy Center]], the center's largest performance space. These galas are formal and generally include local VIP award presenters, along with performances of songs or scenes from nominated shows. They usually run from two-and-a-half to three hours, and some are televised.

=== Awards rules ===
At the end of the school year, within each program, critics who review the required minimum number of shows (usually five) become [[adjudicator|judges]] for Cappie nominations and awards. Except for critic awards (determined by a digital formula), all Cappie nominations and awards are decided by student critics.

The student critics gather at a central computer site to vote. This process is carefully supervised by adult proctors, and reviewed for accuracy by a trustee and auditor. Depending on the program, there can be anywhere from three to five nominees per award category. The nominees are announced shortly after the voting.

The outcome of all awards is determined by unique software developed in 2002 by two high school students from [[Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology]] in [[Alexandria, Virginia]].

Awards are only given to high school students in grades 9-12. The amount of adult involvement in offstage work (building [[Set construction|sets]], sewing [[costumes]], playing in [[orchestras]], etc.) is strictly established in the rules. A Cappies show that has adults exceeding the allowed level of involvement is not eligible for that category, but is eligible for all other awards.

A steering committee of a regional Cappies program can, if it chooses, give a Special Award for Service to a high school student who gave exceptional help, either to the Cappies or to high school theater throughout his or her region.

== Cappies International Theater ==
Every summer, winners of Lead Actor and Actress awards from all programs are invited to attend the Cappies International Theater.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070723182304/http://www.cappies.com/cit/main.html Cappies International Theater]&lt;/ref&gt; This CIT company presents three shows, all written entirely by high school students: ''Starz!'' (monologues, songs, and minimusicals), ''Playz!'' (short plays), and a full-length student-written musical. The latter two are performed at the Kennedy Center Theater Lab.

The Cappies International Theater is a summer program focused on the development of dramatic and musical skills. They produce several shows in different categories, and often perform the work of their peers. Students interested in the technical elements of theater also have opportunities to practice and demonstrate their skills.

Cappies International Theater began in the summer of 2002 at a small theater in [[Hollywood]]. In 2003, in partnership with the Kennedy Center, it moved to Washington, D.C., under the name Cappies National Theater. When the first Canadian program (in Ottawa) joined the Cappies in 2005, the name was changed to Cappies International Theater. Starting in 2006, CIT began featuring works by high school student playwrights, including the two full-length musicals ''[[Edit:undo|&lt;u&gt;E&lt;/u&gt;dit:&lt;u&gt;U&lt;/u&gt;ndo]]'' and ''[[Senioritis musical|Senioritis]]''. Both were written by nine-person creative teams of student book writers, [[lyricist]]s, [[composer]]s, and a [[digital artist]].

=== Student-written musicals ===
In 2006, CIT presented the student-written musical ''&lt;u&gt;E&lt;/u&gt;dit:&lt;u&gt;U&lt;/u&gt;ndo'', which is about teenage life and relationships in the [[digital era]]. A [[CD]] and [[DVD]] of ''&lt;u&gt;E&lt;/u&gt;dit:&lt;u&gt;U&lt;/u&gt;ndo'' are available for sale on the website.

In 2007, the CIT company presented the student-written musical ''Senioritis'', which is about the anxieties of senior year. A CD and [[feature-length film]] was to be made of ''Senioritis'', following the Kennedy Center performances.

In 2008, the Cappies entered into a licensing agreement with the school's musical publisher Next Gen Publications, to represent ''Edit:Undo'', ''Senioritis'', Free-the-Music.com and founder Strauss' Makiddo worldwide.

The Cappies International Theater has not taken place since 2009, but may resume in the future.

A '''food fight''' is a form of chaotic [[collective behavior]], in which [[food]] is thrown at others in the manner of [[projectile]]s. These projectiles are not made nor meant to harm others, but to simply ignite a fight filled with spontaneous food throwing. Food fights may be impromptu examples of [[rebellion]] or [[violence]]; however, they can also be planned events. In organized food fights, the food "weapons" are usually all of one kind, or of a limited variety. An impromptu food fight will use whatever food is on hand.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/11/us/11foodfight.html New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

Though usually associated with juvenile settings such as [[school]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Food fight leads to suspensions at Dixon school |url=http://www.saukvalley.com/articles/2010/04/30/r_uwweei0ftacdl2sut2g4sa/index.xml |newspaper=Sauk Valley Newspapers |date=2010-04-30 |accessdate=2010-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; food fights have a long history throughout the world as a form of festive public entertainment or [[pastime]]. They have traditionally been popular since the [[early Middle Ages]] in [[Europe]] during seasonal festivals, especially in the summertime. For example, Spanish "''[[La Tomatina]]''" is still regularly held every August in [[Valencia]]n town of [[Buñol]], in which participants pelt each other with tomatoes, as is [[Battle of the Oranges]] held in the Italian town of [[Ivrea]] where, as the name would suggest, the oranges are used instead. Food fights occur at the meetings of the [[Legislative Yuan]] of [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Taiwanese MPs hold a food fight |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3954847.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |date= 2004-10-26 |accessdate=2006-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Food fights have also become a common element in [[slapstick]] comedy, with the [[pieing|pie in the face]] gag being especially well-known. Food fights are frequently featured in [[children's television]] and [[children's books|books]], usually as an example of childish, destructive or reckless behavior.

'''Fuzzbuzz''' is a series of educational books designed for small children who may have problems with reading, published by [[Oxford University Press]].  It is based on [[Phonics|phonic]] and high frequency words and is a good scheme to use with any child that needs a boost of the basics.  It reinforces spelling patterns and uses interesting language that children can use in their own creative writing.  Suitable for children from age 6 upwards, depending on their existing level of ability.

== Story ==
The Fuzzbuzzes are creatures with a blue, circular fuzzy body, two antennas and thin legs. They live near the Slinx, an interesting creature who makes life a challenge for the Fuzzbuzzes. There are three levels of difficulty in these books, with the stories also getting more complex as the series goes on.

Level one, the stories use only 100 words, limiting the range of the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]. The books are one story from book one to six, followed by platform readers for the strugglers in two parts, 6.1–6.6, then 6.7–6.12.  These introduce new characters, Eggin, the good guy and The Buzzit, the bad guy.  Other creatures also enter the storyline.

Level two contains a Scottish [[clan]] of Fuzzbuzzes living in a [[glen]] and the Slinx going into space. Books 7–12 follows a simple introduction of the clan in the glen, living in crofts. Stories are entertaining and amusing.  Books 12.1–12.12 follow the progress of the Slinx versus the Fuzzbuzzes in a territorial battle over the dump. The use of materials recycled from the dump and some of the scientific processes are used, especially to appeal to boys who aren't keen on reading.

Level three is also based in [[Scotland]], and the clan venture into the Glen of Gloom, which is inhabited by a monster, The Snagron. [[Vocabulary]] in these books remains largely phonic, but ventures into words using familiar spelling patterns, so still easier to sound out than normal text. Rich in [[adjectives]] and bloodthirsty in places, these stories appeal to the older reader and boost confidence by using text that is dramatic yet logical. Plenty of wonderful illustrations to keep the more reluctant readers gripped, by the sequential books numbered 13 to 20.

All of the books have additional tasks at the bottom of some pages, which can be written or completed orally, including close text, i.e. 'find the missing word'.  Many books have comprehension questions at the end of the book giving page numbers where the answer can be found. The story books also come with workbooks, for the children to practice writing and comprehension in.

The '''Higher Education Evaluation and Accreditation Council of Taiwan (HEEACT)''' ({{zh|t=財團法人高等教育評鑑中心基金會}}) was founded in May 2005. HEEACT applied for ISO certification in July 2008 and received certification on 4 February 2009.

Until 2012, HEEACT published the annual [[Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities]], a [[bibliometrics]] based ranking of research universities. The performance measures were composed of eight indicators (11 years articles, Current articles, 11 years citations, Current citations, Average citations, [[H-index]], Highly cited papers, and High Impact journal articles) representing three different criteria of [[scientific paper]] performance: research productivity, research impact, and research excellence. The objective indicators used in this ranking system were designed measure both long-term and short-term research performance of each university. The ranking started in 2007.

'''Higher education''' (also called post-secondary education, third-level or [[tertiary education]]) is an optional final stage of [[formal learning]] that occurs after completion of [[secondary education]]. Often delivered at [[University|universities]], [[Academy|academies]], [[college]]s, [[seminary|seminaries]], [[school of music|conservatories]], and [[institute of technology|institutes of technology]], higher education is also available through certain college-level institutions, including [[vocational school]]s, trade schools, and other career colleges that award [[academic degree]]s or [[professional certification]]s. [[Tertiary education]] at non-degree level is sometimes referred to as [[further education]] or [[continuing education]] as distinct from higher education. The right of access to higher education is mentioned in a number of [[international human rights instruments]]. The [[United Nations|UN]] [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] of 1966 declares, in Article 13, that "higher education shall be made equally accessible to all, on the basis of capacity, by every appropriate means, and in particular by the progressive introduction of free education". In [[Europe]], Article 2 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights|First Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights]], adopted in 1950, obliges all signatory parties to guarantee the [[right to education]].

In the days when few pupils progressed beyond [[primary education]] or [[basic education]], the term "higher education" was often used to refer to secondary education, which can create some confusion.&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''Higher Education: General and Technical'', a 1933 [[National Union of Teachers]] pamphlet by [[Lord Eustace Percy]], which is actually about secondary education and uses the two terms interchangeably.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the origin of the term ''[[High school (North America)|high school]]'' for various schools for children between the ages of 14 and 18 (United States) or 11 and 18 (UK and Australia).&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/high-school?a=british ]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RupertI.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|[[Rupert I, Elector Palatine|Rupert I]] founded the [[University of Heidelberg]] in 1386]]
Higher education includes teaching, research, exacting applied work (e.g. in [[medical school]]s and [[dental school]]s), and social services activities of universities.&lt;ref&gt;Pucciarelli F., Kaplan Andreas M. (2016) Competition and Strategy in Higher Education: Managing Complexity and Uncertainty, Business Horizons, Volume 59&lt;/ref&gt; Within the realm of teaching, it includes both the ''[[undergraduate education|undergraduate]]'' level, and beyond that, ''[[Postgraduate education|graduate-level]]'' (or ''postgraduate'' level). The latter level of education is often referred to as [[graduate school]], especially in North America. In addition to the skills that are specific to any particular degree, potential employers in any profession are looking for evidence of [[critical thinking]] and [[analytical reasoning]] skills, [[teamwork]]ing skills, [[information literacy]], [[Ethics|ethical]] judgment, [[decision-making]] skills, fluency in speaking and writing, [[problem solving]] skills, and a wide knowledge of liberal arts and sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

Since [[World War II]], developed and many developing countries have increased the participation of the age group who mostly studies higher education from the elite rate, of up to 15 per cent, to the mass rate of 16 to 50 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;Trow, Martin (1973) Problems in the transition from elite to mass higher education.

== History ==
{{main|History of higher education in the United States}}
The U.S. system of higher education was heavily influenced by the [[Humboldtian model of higher education]]. [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]]'s educational model goes beyond vocational training. In a letter to the Prussian king, he wrote:

{{quote|There are undeniably certain kinds of knowledge that must be of a general nature and, more importantly, a certain cultivation of the mind and character that nobody can afford to be without. People obviously cannot be good craftworkers, merchants, soldiers or businessmen unless, regardless of their occupation, they are good, upstanding and – according to their condition – well-informed human beings and citizens. If this basis is laid through schooling, vocational skills are easily acquired later on, and a person is always free to move from one occupation to another, as so often happens in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF02192965|title=Profiles of educators: Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767–1835)|journal=Prospects|volume=18|pages=127–136|year=1988|last1=Günther|first1=Karl-Heinz}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The philosopher [[Julian Nida-Rümelin]] criticized discrepancies between Humboldt's ideals and the contemporary European education policy, which narrowly understands education as a preparation for the labor market, and argued that we need to decide between [[McKinsey &amp; Company|McKinsey]] and Humboldt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.zeit.de/2009/45/Bachelor-Kritik|title=Bologna-Prozess: Die Chance zum Kompromiss ist da|last=Nida-Rümelin|first=Julian|date=29 October 2009|work=[[Die Zeit]]|language=German|access-date=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entrance standards: reading, mathematics, and writing==

Demonstrated ability in reading, mathematics, and writing, as typically measured in the United States by the [[SAT]] or similar tests such as the [[ACT (test)|ACT]], have often replaced colleges' individual entrance exams, and is often required for admission to higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/26/education/edlife/26guidance-t.html|title=The Other Side of 'Test Optional'|last=O'Shaughnessy|first=Lynn|date=26 July 2009|work=The New York Times|page=6|accessdate=22 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some question as to whether advanced mathematical skills or talent are in fact necessary for fields such as history, English, philosophy, or art.&lt;ref name=NYT72812&gt;{{cite news|title=Is Algebra Necessary?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/29/opinion/sunday/is-algebra-necessary.html|accessdate=July 29, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 28, 2012|author=Andrew Hacker|authorlink=Andrew Hacker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===General===
The general higher education and training that takes place in a [[university]], [[college]], or [[Institute of technology]] usually includes significant [[theory|theoretical]] and abstract elements, as well as applied aspects (although limited offerings of [[internship]]s or [[Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF)|SURF]] programs attempt to provide practical applications). In contrast, the vocational higher education and training that takes place at [[vocational university|vocational universities and schools]] usually concentrates on [[practice (learning method)|practical applications]], with very little theory.

In addition, [[professional]]-level education is always included within Higher Education, and usually in [[graduate school]]s since many [[postgraduate education|postgraduate]] [[List of academic disciplines|academic disciplines]] are both vocationally, professionally, and theoretically/research oriented, such as in the [[law]], [[medicine]], [[pharmacy]], [[dentistry]], and [[veterinary medicine]]. A basic requirement for entry into these graduate-level programs is almost always a bachelor's degree, although [[alternative pathways in education|alternative means]] of obtaining entry into such programs may be available at some universities. Requirements for admission to such high-level graduate programs is extremely competitive, and admitted students are expected to perform well.

When employers in any profession consider hiring a college graduate, they are looking for evidence of [[critical thinking]], [[analytical reasoning]] skills, [[teamwork]]ing skills, [[information literacy]], [[Ethics|ethical]] judgment, [[decision-making]] skills, [[Communication studies|communication skills]] (using both text and speech), [[problem solving]] skills, and a wide knowledge of liberal arts and sciences. However, most employers consider the average graduate to be more or less deficient in all of these areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

In the United States, there are large differences in wages and employment associated with different degrees. Medical doctors and lawyers are generally the highest paid workers, and have among the lowest unemployment rates. Among undergraduate fields of study, science, technology, engineering, math, and business generally offer the highest wages and best chances of employment, while education, communication, and liberal arts degrees generally offer lower wages and a lower likelihood of employment.&lt;ref name="Simkovic" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| title =The Economic Value of College Majors| publisher =Georgetown University| date =May 2015| url =https://cew.georgetown.edu/cew-reports/valueofcollegemajors/| accessdate =17 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Liberal arts ====
{{Main|Liberal arts college}}

Academic areas that are included within the [[liberal arts]] include [[environmental science]], [[great books]], [[history]], [[language]]s including English, [[linguistics]], [[literature]], [[mathematics]], [[Music education|music]], [[philosophy]], [[political science]], [[psychology]], [[religious studies]], [[science]], [[sociology]] and [[Drama school|theater]].

==== Engineering ====
{{Main|Engineering college}}

Teaching engineering is teaching the application of scientific, economic, social, and practical knowledge in order to design, build, maintain, and improve structures, machines, devices, systems, materials and processes. It may encompass using insights to conceive, model and scale an appropriate solution to a problem or objective. The discipline of engineering is extremely broad, and encompasses a range of more specialized fields of engineering, each with a more specific emphasis on particular areas of technology and types of application. Engineering disciplines include [[aerospace]], [[biological]], [[Civil engineering|civil]], [[chemical]], [[Computer engineering|computer]], [[electrical]], [[Industrial engineering|industrial]], and [[Mechanical engineering|mechanical]].

====Performing arts====
{{Main|Performing arts education}}

The [[performing arts]] differ from the [[plastic arts]] or [[visual arts]], insofar as the former uses the artist's own body, face and presence as a medium; the latter uses materials such as clay, metal or paint, which can be molded or transformed to create a [[work of art]].

Performing arts institutions include [[:Category:Circus schools|circus schools]], [[Dance studio|dance schools]], [[drama school]]s and [[music school]]s.

====Plastic or visual arts====
{{Main|Art education|Art school}}

The [[plastic arts]] or [[visual arts]] are a class of [[Art#Art forms|art forms]], that involve the use of materials, that can be moulded or modulated in some way, often in three dimensions. Examples are [[painting]], [[sculpture]], and [[drawing]].

Higher educational institutions in these arts include [[film school]]s and [[List of art schools|art schools]].

===Vocational===
{{Main|Vocational university|Vocational school|Technical school}}

Higher vocational education and training takes place at the non-university tertiary level. Such education combines teaching of both practical skills and theoretical expertise. Higher education differs from other forms of post-secondary education such as that offered by institutions of [[vocational education]], which are more colloquially known as [[vocational school|trade schools]]. Higher vocational education might be contrasted with education in a usually broader [[science|scientific]] field, which might concentrate on [[theory]] and abstract [[concept]]ual knowledge.

===Professional higher education===
This describes a distinct form of higher education that offers a particularly intense integration with the world of work in all its aspects (including teaching, learning, research and governance) and at all levels of the overarching Qualifications Framework of the European Higher Education Area. Its function is to diversify learning opportunities, enhance employability, offer qualifications and stimulate innovation, for the benefit of learners and society.

The intensity of integration with the world of work (which includes enterprise, civil society and the public sector) is manifested by a strong focus on application of learning. This approach involves combining phases of work and study, a concern for employability, cooperation with employers, the use of practice-relevant knowledge and use-inspired research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://haphe.eurashe.eu|title = Harmonising Approaches to Professional Higher Education in Europe|date = 2013|accessdate = 2014-10-17|website = Harmonising Approaches to Professional Higher Education in Europe|publisher = EURASHE|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of providers of professional higher education may include graduate colleges of [[architecture]], [[Business school|business]], [[Journalism school|journalism]], [[Law school|law]], [[Library school|library science]], [[optometry]], [[Pharmacy school|pharmacy]], [[Public policy school|public policy]], [[Medical school|human medicine]], [[Engineering education|professional engineering]], [[Podiatric medical school|podiatric medicine]], [[Dental school|scientific dentistry]], [[K-12 education]], and [[Veterinary school|veterinary medicine]].

===Statistics===
A report titled 'Education at a Glance 2014' published by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] on 9 September 2014, revealed that by 2014, 84 percent of young people were completing upper secondary education over their lifetimes, in high-income countries. Tertiary-educated individuals were earning twice as much as median workers. In contrast to historical trends in education, young women were more likely to complete upper secondary education than young men.  Additionally, access to education was expanding and growth in the number of people receiving university education was rising sharply. By 2014, close to 40 percent of people aged 25–34 (and around 25 percent of those aged 55–64), were being educated at university.&lt;ref name="ReportOECD"&gt;{{cite news|title=Higher levels of education paying off for young, says OECD|url=http://www.oecd.org/edu/eag.htm |date=September 2014 |accessdate=September 11, 2014|author=[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition of studies==
The [[Lisbon Recognition Convention]] stipulates that degrees and periods of study must be recognised in all of the Signatory Parties of the Convention.

==As employers==
[[File:2015-04-23 Kirylo Cope DSC0072.jpg|upright=1.1|right|thumb|University governance generally involves input from the Faculty. Here [[James D.

Cope, president of the [[LSU]] Faculty Senate and president of the Association of Louisiana Faculty Senates, during a 2015 panel presentation in [[Hammond, Louisiana|Hammond]] on university funding issues for [[Fiscal Year]] 2016.]]
Universities may employ a number of people. Depending on the funding, a university typically hires one teacher per 3–25 students. According to the ideal of research-university, the university teaching staff is actively involved in the research of the institution. In addition, the university usually also has dedicated research staff and a considerable support staff. Typically to work in higher education as a member of the academic [[Faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]], a candidate must first obtain a doctorate in an academic field, although some lower teaching positions require only a master's degree.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Most of the administrative staff works in different administrative sections, such as [[Student Affairs]].{{citation needed|reason=This appears 'top of the head'. Really needs citation and more university 'sections'.|date=November 2011}} In addition, there may be central support units, such as a university [[library]] which have a dedicated staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cornell University Library Staff Web|url=http://staffweb.library.cornell.edu/|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The professional field involving the collection, analysis, and reporting of higher education data is called [[institutional research]]. Professionals in this field can be found at locations in addition to universities, e.g. state educational departments.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Post-secondary institutions also employ graduate students in various assistantship roles.  In the US, close to 50% of graduate students are employed as graduate assistants at some point.  These apprenticeship-like positions provide opportunities for students to gain experience in, and exposure to, professional roles in exchange for funding of their academic programs.&lt;ref&gt;Haley, K., Hephner LaBanc, B., &amp; Koutas, P. (2011). New school, new job, new life: Transitions of graduate assistants in student affairs. Journal of College Orientation and Transition, 18(2), 5 - 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent controversy ==
From the early 1950s to the present, more and more people in the United States have gone on to pursue degrees or certificates of higher education. However this has sparked some debate in recent years as some advocates say that a degree is not what it was once worth to employers. To clarify some advocates say that the financial costs that universities require from their students  has gone up so dramatically that it is leaving many students in debt of loans of an average of $37,172&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://studentloanhero.com/student-loan-debt-statistics/|title=U.S. Student Loan Debt Statistics for 2017 {{!}} Student Loan Hero|work=Student Loan Hero|access-date=2017-12-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared to 2000, where the average debt students graduated with was $16,928.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2002/03/08/college/q_studentdebt/|title=Student debt increasingly unmanagable - Mar. 8, 2002|website=money.cnn.com|access-date=2017-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States there is an estimated 44 million Americans with a combined $1.3 trillion student loan debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2017/02/21/student-loan-debt-statistics-2017/#50c1f4f05dab|title=Student Loan Debt In 2017: A $1.3 Trillion Crisis|last=Friedman|first=Zack|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-12-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates advise parents to not send their children to college unless these children are committed to pursuing their future education. An increasing number of freshman every year drop out of their perspective programs or do not possess the maturity to have a balanced life away from home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Some Career Pathways Require a Four-Year Degree, Many Don't - US News|url = https://www.usnews.com/debate-club/is-a-college-degree-still-worth-it/some-career-pathways-require-a-four-year-degree-many-dont|website = US News &amp; World Report|accessdate = 2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However statistics from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics indicate that the college educated are employed at a rate nearly twice that of the national average when compared to high school graduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|url = http://www.bls.gov/|website = www.bls.gov|accessdate = 2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The type of degree one pursues will determine how safe and prosperous his/her career path is. A study published by the Pew Charitable Trusts, shows that among Americans ages 21 to 24, the drop in employment and income was much steeper among people who lacked a college degree. "Among those whose highest degree was a high school diploma, only 55% had jobs even before the downturn, and that fell to 47% after it. For young people with an associates degree, the employment rate fell from 64 to 57. Bachelor's degree slipped from 69 to 65."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Study Shows College Degree's Value During Economic Downturn|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/10/education/study-shows-college-degrees-value-during-economic-downturn.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2013-01-09|access-date = 2015-10-11|issn = 0362-4331|first = Richard|last = Pérez-peña}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Lisa Kahn of Yale stated that people who graduated from college in the most recent recession were in a position to gain better security than others.

Ultimately a survey, the Great Jobs and Great Lives Gallup-Purdue Index report &lt;!-- (what year?) released in May --&gt; found the type of college that students attend and in some cases even majors they choose have very little to do with their overall success and well-being later in life. What matters more, the index found, is feeling supported and making emotional connections during school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = College Grads Question How Much a Degree Is Worth|url = https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/02/10/college-grads-question-the-return-on-investment-of-todays-degrees|website = US News &amp; World Report|date = 2015-02-10|accessdate = 2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2857">The '''Interdisciplinary Telecommunications Program''' (its acronym is '''ITP''') is a part of the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]] and offers graduate degrees in [[telecommunications]]: a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] and [[Master of Science]] in Telecommunications and a [[Master of Engineering]] in Telecommunications.  It is the oldest telecommunications program in the United States and was founded in 1971 by Frank S. Barnes (Engineering) and George Codding (deceased, International Relations).  Since its inception, ITP has taken an [[interdisciplinary]] approach to telecommunications, involving the study of [[engineering]], [[law]], [[politics]], [[economics]] and [[business]].  Over the course of the past 35 years, ITP has graduated approximately 2,000 [[alumni]] who are in various positions around the world as [[CEO]]s, government officials, and management.

In 2004, ITP founder Frank S. Barnes was awarded the prestigious [[Gordon Prize]] for having founded ITP due to its innovative character and the influence that it has had within academia and industry.  As the first program of its kind in the United States, it broke ground for the many academic programs that followed. When [[Peterson's]] first started listing telecommunications programs in 1996, the director of ITP was asked to write the introduction on the topic for Peterson's publisher.  There is no question that many other prominent university programs have been directly influenced by ITP.  For further information, there is now a consortium of universities that teach the telecommunications discipline, known as [[ITERA]].

Students may participate in the program through either full-time academic study on campus or by participating in a distance-education platform.

==Early life==
Austin "Jack" Warner was born in [[Rio Claro, Trinidad and Tobago|Rio Claro]], south Trinidad, on 26 January 1943. He is one of three brothers and three sisters who were brought up almost single-handedly by their mother Stella.&lt;ref name=WarnerBio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jackwarnertt.com/bio.htm|title=Biography|publisher=Jack Warner|accessdate=5 December 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203021945/http://jackwarnertt.com/bio.htm|archivedate=3 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After gaining a [[scholarship]] from Trinidad Clay Products, he attended the College of St Phillip's and St James, which in 1958 became [[Presentation College, Chaguanas]]. After attending Teachers Training College, he then graduated with a BA degree from the [[University of the West Indies]] at St Augustine, and subsequently earned a Diploma in International Relations from the same institution.&lt;ref name=WarnerFIFA&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/federation/bodies/members/people=23102.html|title=Jack Warner|publisher=FIFA|date=5 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=December 2010}}

In 1971, Warner became a teacher at North Eastern College, and was also at this time until 1973 a part-time [[sociology]] lecturer at UWI. From 1972 until 1993, he was a lecturer in history at the Polytechnic Institute.&lt;ref name=WarnerProfile&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jackwarnertt.com/profile.htm|title=Profile|publisher=Jack Warner|accessdate=5 December 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328173717/http://jackwarnertt.com/profile.htm|archivedate=28 March 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Football administrator==
In 1966, Warner became General Secretary of the Central Football Association, and from 1971–1973 was General Secretary of the Central St. George Football Association.&lt;ref name=WarnerProfile/&gt;

Warner became the secretary of the [[Trinidad and Tobago Football Federation]] (TTFF) in 1973. In 1990, he was elected President of the [[Caribbean Football Union]], resigning his post at TTFF but was immediately appointed a special advisor, a position that he still holds.&lt;ref name=WarnerBio/&gt;

In 1983, Warner became a [[CONCACAF]] Vice-President and also joined the [[FIFA]] [[Executive committee#Executive committee|Executive Committee]].&lt;ref name=WarnerProfile/&gt; Warner was elected CONCACAF President in 1990, unseating [[Joaquín Soria Terrazas]] who had held the seat for twenty years.&lt;ref name="90elec"&gt;[http://www.ttfootballhistory.com/node/42 James Elected 2nd VP] ''Jamaica Gleaner'', 2 May 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Warner and the new CONCACAF General Secretary, [[Chuck Blazer]], took over an organization with US$140,000 in annual revenue.&lt;ref name="glazer"&gt;"Trail Blazer" ''Street and Smith's SportsBusiness Journal'', 7 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Warner was appointed as a FIFA Vice-President in 1997.&lt;ref name=WarnerProfile/&gt; In 2010, Warner stated his intent to stand for re-election in 2011.&lt;ref name="elect2011"&gt;[http://www.concacaf.com/page/ConfederationDetail/0,,12813~2163531,00.html "CONCACAF President Warner to stand for re-election"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101003044547/http://www.concacaf.com/page/ConfederationDetail/0%2C%2C12813~2163531%2C00.html |date= 3 October 2010 }} ''concacaf.com'', 24 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jack Warner is the chairman of the [[Joe Public F.C.|Joe Public Football Club]] which he founded in 1996, in the aftermath of Trinidad and Tobago's failed World Cup qualifying campaign. Warner also helped to found Trinidad and Tobago's Professional Football League (PFL), then the first professional football league in the Caribbean, which has since been superseded by the [[TT Pro League]].

In 1998, Warner purchased the Scarlet Ibis Hotel in St Augustine for TT$6 million,&lt;ref name="godfather"&gt;Moreno, Camille (13 January 2000) [https://web.archive.org/web/20070713065731/http://www.nalis.gov.tt/Biography/bio_JackWarner_FIFAvp.htm THE HOUSE THAT JACK BUILT].

CONCACAF pays Warner "nearly a third of a million dollars a year" rent.&lt;ref name="Beautiful Bung"&gt;{{cite news |last=Jennings|first=Andrew |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/panorama/5076282.stm |title=The Beautiful Bung: Corruption and the World Cup |publisher=BBC |date=11 June 2006|accessdate=10 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warner also claims business interests in Costa Rica and the United States. Warner states that his investments were funded from "the salary and allowances I received from FIFA".&lt;ref name="godfather" /&gt;

===Controversies===

====Trinidad and Tobago 2006 World Cup bonuses====
Before the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], Warner, as special advisor to TTFF, brokered a deal between the Federation and the players on Trinidad and Tobago's 2006 World Cup team to share the proceeds from their participation in the World Cup. After the tournament, the Federation declared revenue of [[Trinidad and Tobago dollar|TT$]]18.25 million, costs of TT$17.9 million and offered the players a split of TT$5,644.08 per player. The players rejected this figure, disputing the Federation's numbers. Warner criticized the players for refusing to accept the TTFF's unaudited statement, saying "What Trinidad is suffering from is from a situation whereby 16 or 18 players are holding a country and a federation to ransom because of greed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Herborn|first=Michael|url=http://playthegame.org/News/Up_To_Date/Trinidad_and_Tobago_Football_Federation_said_to_understate_World_Cup_earnings_by_USD25_million_21092.aspx |title=Trinidad and Tobago Football Federation said to understate World Cup earnings by USD 25 million|publisher=Play the Game |date=24 September 2007|accessdate=22 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Liburd |first=Lasana |url=http://www.trinidadexpress.com/index.pl/article_news?id=161203191 |title=T&amp;TFF got more than $173m |work=The Trinidad Express |date=15 September 2007 |accessdate=30 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209171643/http://www.trinidadexpress.com/index.pl/article_news?id=161203191 |archivedate=9 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shaka Hislop]], the interim president of the Football Players Association of Trinidad and Tobago, responded with a letter to Warner writing "You have continually proven yourself heavily biased and opinionated in this matter." In 2010, Hislop added that "Jack Warner, though not on the TTFA officially, makes every single decision: how much bonus should be paid, who is the right coach."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/nov/29/jack-warner-england-world-cup-2018|title=How Fifa vice-president Jack Warner failed to deliver on promises

The Trinidad and Tobago government revealed that the Federation received in excess of TT$173 million for their part in the tournament in Germany. TTFF proposed that the bonus dispute be heard before the UK Sports Dispute Resolution Panel, which the players agreed to. Arbitrator Ian Mill [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] heard the case and ruled that Warner had "the authority of the TTFA to commit it to financial transactions" and that the players were entitled to 50 per cent of the FIFA World Cup participation money and the commercial revenues gained from Trinidad and Tobago's qualification, as well as half the net income from World Cup warm-up matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Liburd |first=Lasana |url=http://www.trinidadexpress.com/index.pl/article_sports?id=161326115 |title=Hislop relieved over SDRP judgment |work=The Trinidad Express |date=21 May 2008 |accessdate=15 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205182513/http://www.trinidadexpress.com/index.pl/article_sports?id=161326115 |archivedate=5 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The players' lawyer, Michael Townley, said, "At the moment, the players have not received a single cent" and alleged that the TTFF defaulted on its payment to the arbitration body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Liburd |first=Lasana |url=http://www.trinidadexpress.com/index.pl/article_sports?id=161326117 |title='let's start with $44m' |work=The Trinidad Express |date=21 May 2008 |accessdate=15 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091228144711/http://www.trinidadexpress.com/index.pl/article_sports?id=161326117 |archivedate=28 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====England World Cup bid====
Warner once again caused controversy in 2007 in an interview with the [[BBC]] about England's chances of holding the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]]. He asserted that ''"England invented the sport but has never made any impact on world football"'' despite being one of only (then) seven nations to ever lift the world cup, ''"For Europe, England is an irritant"'', and that ''"Nobody in Europe likes England"''. Furthermore, Warner proposed that, if the World Cup were to be held in Europe, it should be held in Italy, Spain or France (countries that last hosted the competition in 1990, 1982 and 1998 respectively). He said that he would "battle to bring...the tournament to his region"&lt;ref name="bbceng"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/6939170.stm|title=BBC SPORT – Football – Internationals – Caborn hits back at Warner attack|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=411466&amp;cc=5739|title=Blatter: 2018 World Cup should be in N.

However, on 14 February 2008, Warner retracted this stance. [[The Football Association|England's Football Association]] agreed to visit Trinidad and Tobago to play a friendly against the [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team]] on the condition that Warner apologize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://legacy.guardian.co.tt/archives/2008-02-14/sports2.html|title=England FA wants apology from Warner...or no friendly against Warriors
|work=The Trinidad Guardian| publisher=Trinidad Publishing Company Limited |date=14 February 2008|accessdate=15 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warner argued that, "The time has come. The fact is they invented this sport [...] They last held the World Cup 42 years ago. That is almost two to three generations. There are guys in England who have never seen a World Cup on English soil." Warner maintained that the choice of England would not be popular among mainland [[Europe]] though.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/7245623.stm|title = Warner backs England 2018 Cup bid|publisher = [[BBC SPORT]]|date = 14 February 2008}} Retrieved 14 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the bidding process to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup's Warner continually supported the English bid, promising to vote in England's favour at the draw in December 2010. Warner approached the England bid team through [[David Beckham]], offering to hold off on bringing out the vote for Russia in exchange for promises in relation to [[CONCACAF]].&lt;ref name="Jack Warner blasted over failed England bid - Alleged to have switched support"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Jack-Warner-blasted-over-failed-England-bid|title=Jack Warner blasted over failed England bid – Alleged to have switched support|publisher=Jamaica Observer|date=3 December 2010|accessdate=3 December 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206085043/http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Jack-Warner-blasted-over-failed-England-bid|archive-date=6 December 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=December 2010}} Russia won the vote to hold the FIFA World Cup in 2018, with Warner widely reported to have voted for the Russian bid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/dec/04/world-cup-2018-how-england-bid-failed |title=World Cup 2018: The men who betrayed England and why they did it |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media |first=Owen |last=Gibson|date=4 December 2010 |accessdate=5 December 2010 |at=Sports, p. 2 |location=London, United Kingdom |quote=Jack Warner, the Concacaf president who has revelled in his status as kingmaker of the English bid, shook hands with Cameron, had his picture taken with Prince William, then promptly took his three votes to Russia. Warner later got his just rewards by being arrested.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dwight Yorke====
In September 2008, after [[Sunderland FC|Sunderland]] player [[Dwight Yorke]] had withdrawn from the [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team]], Warner attacked the club and the manager, [[Roy Keane]]. In a letter leaked to the press, Warner accused Keane of disrespecting "small countries" and having a "mean streak".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.trinidadexpress.com/index.pl/article_sports?id=161373899|title=Warner slams Keane for 'disrespect' |work=The Trinidad Express |date=10 September 2008|accessdate=12 September 2008}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/2008-09-12-1861272354_x.htm|work=USA Today|title=Keane calls FIFA VP Jack Warner a 'clown'|date=12 September 2008|accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keane responded by denying the allegation, accusing Warner of being a "clown" and a "disgrace", and insisted that Yorke was retired from [[FIFA|international football]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Louise|last=Taylor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/13/sunderland.premierleague|title=Keane attacks 'clowns' Warner and Yorke over Trinidad saga |work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|date=13 September 2008|accessdate=14 April 2009|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mayagüez 2010====
{{Main| Football at the 2010 Central American and Caribbean Games}}
Warner unilaterally withdrew CONCACAFS support of the football events at the [[Mayagüez 2010]] games at the last moment stating that the tournament facilities allegedly do not meet the "minimum standards required to conduct an international tournament."  He threatened to sanction countries that participated.  Some of the possible sanctions were the teams accreditation by Concacaf and ending economic helps.

===Corruption allegations===
Warner has been accused of corruption for repeatedly taking advantage of his position for financial gain.&lt;ref name="Beautiful Bung"/&gt;

====Black market ticket sales====
Via a private family company, Warner owned shares in Simpaul, a travel and holiday company. In late 2002, various global media publications alleged that Warner had made a profit of $350,000 selling [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] tickets.&lt;ref name=DMail404756/&gt; In a series of exposés during December 2005, the ''[[Trinidad and Tobago Express]]'' revealed that Simpaul was offering $30,000 packages to the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] in [[Germany]], which effectively marked up match tickets at a high rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ttgapers.com/News/2006/1/19/simpauls-travel-under-fifa-scrutiny/|title=Simpaul's Travel under FIFA scrutiny|publisher=TTGapers.com|date=1 January 2006|accessdate=5 December 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717110906/http://www.ttgapers.com/News/2006/1/19/simpauls-travel-under-fifa-scrutiny/|archivedate=17 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; FIFA's ethics committee criticised the ticket deals, concluding Warner had abused his position to obtain personal benefits and failed to declare his business interests. Warner agreed to sever all family links with Simpaul immediately. However, his son Daryan remained a director of Simpaul throughout World Cup 2006, while his personal assistant remained the company secretary of Simpaul.&lt;ref name="DMail404756"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-404756/FIFA-chiefs-World-Cup-ticket-scam.html#ixzz17ExVjJou|title=FIFA chief's World Cup ticket scam|author=Andrew Jennings|publisher=Daily Mail|date=12 September 2006|accessdate=5 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FIFA started an investigation and asked their auditors [[Ernst &amp; Young]], to investigate. In a report submitted to FIFA in March 2006, E&amp;Y estimated that Warner's family had made a profit of at least $1 million from reselling 2006 World Cup tickets, that Warner had directly ordered or sold on behalf of the TTFA.&lt;ref name="Beautiful Bung" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Norman-Culp.|first=Sheila |url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?click_id=19&amp;art_id=nw20070323192724719C190400&amp;set_id= |title=Blatter denies involvement in graft probe |agency=Associated Press|date=23 March 2007|accessdate=28 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minutes of FIFA’s executive committee indicate that in consequence of being found guilty of breaking FIFA's Article 5, a fine of almost $1 million, equal to the expected profiteering, was imposed on the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Jennings|first=Andrew |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/sport/football.html?in_article_id=441852&amp;in_page_id=1779&amp;ct=5 |title=FIFA chief's son in $1m scam fine |publisher=Daily Mail |date=13 March 2007|accessdate=13 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hughes|first=Rob |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/19/sports/19iht-soccer.2865931.html |title=The stench of corruption |newspaper=International Herald Tribune|publisher=The New York Times Company |date=19 September 2006|accessdate=8 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite numerous reminders from FIFA, only $250,000 has been paid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Jennings|first=Andrew |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/sport/football.html?in_article_id=404756&amp;in_page_id=1779|title=FIFA chief's World Cup ticket scam|publisher=Daily Mail|date=12 September 2006|accessdate=12 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Jennings]], the presenter of [[FIFA's Dirty Secrets]], an edition of [[BBC]]'s ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]],'' repeated the allegations in a November 2010 programme during the week Warner and his fellow FIFA Executive Committee members voted to decide the hosts for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]] and [[2022 FIFA World Cup|2022]] [[FIFA World Cup|World Cups]].

====Request for personal payments====
[[Scottish Football Association]] President John McBeth said Warner asked that monies owed to the [[Trinidad and Tobago Football Federation|TTFF]] be sent to Warner's personal account. According to McBeth, after [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]] visited Scotland for a friendly match at [[Easter Road]], Edinburgh, on 30 May 2004, Warner asked that the cheque for the game be made out to him. McBeth told Warner, "we don't do that" and noted that Warner also approached other members of the Scottish FA following the game in an attempt to collect money due to the TTFF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jennings |first=Andrew |url=http://www.sundayherald.com/sport/shfootball/display.var.1775342.0.warner_asked_me_to_make_a_cheque_out_to_his_personal_account_i_said_we_dont_do_that.php |title='Warner asked me to make a cheque out to his personal account.

====2018 World Cup bid====
On 10 May 2011, former chairman of the English [[The Football Association|Football Association]], [[David Triesman, Baron Triesman|Lord Triesman]], accused Warner and several others of asking for compensation in return for votes for [[England 2018 FIFA World Cup bid|England]]'s [[2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids#2018 bids|2018 World Cup bid]]. Warner reportedly asked for £2.5 million that would go toward building an education centre in Trinidad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/917869/lord-triesman-accuses-four-fifa-officials-of-impropriety |title=Triesman accuses four FIFA members |date=10 May 2011 |work=ESPN Soccernet |accessdate=10 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On 26 May 2011 the BBC published an email from Warner to the English FA requesting funds to purchase Haiti's World Cup television rights. The above article also quotes FIFA as denying that Haiti had ever been granted television rights for this competition. This email appears to substantiate a separate charge by Lord Triesman (formally heading the England 2018 World Cup bid) whereby Warner had requested funds from the English to (again) be sent into his personal account so that he could purchase the rights as a humanitarian gesture for the Haitian people. In return, the English bid team could expect his support during the bid process. The total sum that Warner had requested in this instance was in the region of $1.6 million.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

====FIFA World Cup television rights====
In December 2011 Warner claimed to have purchased the television rights for the 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010 and 2014 editions of the FIFA World Cup for Trinidad &amp; Tobago, via a Mexican company.&lt;ref name='GuardianDec29'&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/dec/29/jack-warner-sepp-blatter| title=Jack Warner claims he bought World Cup rights for $1 | publisher=The Guardian | accessdate=19 February 2012 | date=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warner claimed to have purchased the rights for the 1998 FIFA World Cup for $1.&lt;ref name='GuardianDec29'/&gt; Warner also claimed that he refused to endorse [[Sepp Blatter]] in the 2011 [[61st FIFA Congress|FIFA Presidential election]] despite being offered the rights to the 2018 and 2022 World Cup, again for a nominal fee. Warner further alleged that he was offered other "inducements" to develop football in the Caribbean. Warner claims he used the revenue from selling on the rights to develop football in the Caribbean.&lt;ref name='GuardianDec29'/&gt;

====Haiti earthquake funds====
In February 2012 the TTFF claimed that funds for Haiti donated following the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|2010 earthquake]] were paid into a bank account controlled by Warner. FIFA subsequently froze funding to the TTFF until it received an explanation.&lt;ref name='GuardianFeb16'&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/feb/16/ttff-jack-warner-haiti-funds| title=TTFF claims Jack Warner controlled account holding missing Haiti funds | publisher=The Guardian | accessdate=19 February 2012 | date=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; FIFA is also withholding Warner's pension. Warner later suggested that the allegations were a conspiracy, saying that "I have nothing to answer to anybody. Who wants to make allegations, make allegations. Ask yourselves, as objective members of the media: 'Why now...?' And after you get why now, just join the dots and see."&lt;ref name='GuardianFeb16'/&gt;

====Fraud, mismanagement allegations====

On 19 April 2013, the CONCACAF Integrity Committee, headed by David Simmons, former Chief Justice of [[Barbados]], issued a report accusing Warner and his former cohort [[Chuck Blazer]] of mismanagement and massive fraud. Warner is alleged to have concealed his ownership of the land on which CONCACAF's $25 million Joao Havelange Center of Excellence was built, which made him the effective owner of the building. Warner's initial public reaction was defiant: "As far as I am aware it is baseless and malicious. I left CONCACAF and turned my back on football two years ago. Since then I have had no interest in any football-related matter."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insideworldfootball.com/world-football/central-north-america/12369-audit-slays-concacafs-one-time-dynamic-duo 'Audit Slays Dynamic Duo..'], Andrew Warshaw, "Inside World Football," 19 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Indicted for corruption in 2015====
{{main|2015 FIFA corruption case}}
In May 2015, Warner was indicted by the [[United States Department of Justice]] and an arrest warrant issued for him and other FIFA officials. Warner and the others were accused of "wire fraud, racketeering and money laundering".&lt;ref name="nyti.ms"/&gt;

Warner handed himself into Trinidad police in May and was bailed pending extradition to the United States.
The following week, he said publicly that he had documents linking the outcome of the [[2010 Trinidad and Tobago general election]] with FIFA finances and himself.
Warner made the claims in a paid national television political broadcast, saying that his life was in danger, that he had given the documents to lawyers, and, "I will no longer keep secrets for them who actively seek to destroy the country."&lt;ref name=bbc-gloves&gt;{{cite news|title=Fifa crisis: Jack Warner 'to reveal all despite fears'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-33002674|accessdate=4 June 2015|publisher=[[BBC Online]]|date=4 June 2015|quote=Jack Warner, a key figure in the deepening scandal, said he had given lawyers documents outlining the links between Fifa, its funding, himself and the 2010 election in Trinidad and Tobago.

==Political career==
In October 2007, Warner was elected [[United National Congress]] Alliance chairman and co-leader, to lead the party into [[Trinidad and Tobago general election, 2007|Trinidad and Tobago's 2007 General Election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chan Tack|first=Clint |url=http://www.newsday.co.tt/news/0,65391.html |title=Panday, Warner lead UNC Alliance|date=5 October 2007|publisher=Daily News Limited|accessdate = 19 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; They won 15 of 41 seats, and Warner was elected as the Member of Parliament for Chaguanas West. [[Patrick Manning]]'s PNM government, which had comfortably won the 2007 election, called an election less than three years into its mandate. Warner's UNC party formed a coalition with four other parties and won 24 May 2010 elections by a landslide margin of 29 of 41 seats in parliament. Warner was re-elected in Chaguanas West with the highest national vote total. He has described the previous Trinidadian administration as the "most corrupt ever" and has pledged to enforce hanging as a method of execution. Warner has said, "It is inconceivable to have 295 on death row awaiting the hangman...when no one is trying to apply the law."&lt;ref name="Trinidad Express Newspapers"&gt;{{Cite news|last = Julien|first = Joel|title = Jack: Hangings will curb crime|magazine = Trinidad Express Newspapers|date = 7 July 2010|url = http://www.trinidadexpress.com/news/97995414.html|accessdate = 13 July 2010|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100711144844/http://www.trinidadexpress.com/news/97995414.html|archivedate = 11 July 2010|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 2010 election, Warner was appointed the Works and Transport Minister in Prime Minister [[Kamla Persad-Bissessar]]'s government. Opposition leader [[Keith Rowley]] wrote to the Integrity Commission questioning Warner's ability to be a FIFA Vice President, while also the Trinidad and Tobago Works and Transport Minister.&lt;ref name="nosalary"&gt;[http://www.newsday.co.tt/news/print,0,122629.html "Kamla: Jack stays put"], ''[Newsday]'', Port of Spain, 18 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Government counsel concluded that Warner was not breaking any laws, Attorney General [[Anand Ramlogan]] said that Warner did not receive a salary from FIFA, Trinidad benefited from Warner's appointment, and his two positions were unlikely to conflict.

Although Warner was allowed to withdraw from football-related activities by [[FIFA]] with a presumption of innocence in the [[Caribbean Football Union|CFU]] scandal of 2011, a videotape played during FIFA's disciplinary process was consequently made public. Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar referred the videotape to the Attorney General of [[Trinidad and Tobago]] without endorsing or condemning Warner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insideworldfootball.biz/worldfootball/centralandnorthamerica/9758-warner-video-to-be-investigated-by-trinidad-attorney-general T&amp;T Atty Genl to investigate Warner] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111023171353/http://www.insideworldfootball.biz/worldfootball/centralandnorthamerica/9758-warner-video-to-be-investigated-by-trinidad-attorney-general |date=23 October 2011 }}, Inside World Football 15 October 2011, by Andrew Warshaw.&lt;/ref&gt; Warner resigned as Minister of National Security on 21 April 2013 and was replaced by [[Emmanuel George]]. Warner resigned as Chairman of the United National Congress on 22 April 2013, and resigned as Member of Parliament for Chaguanas West four days later, triggering a by-election in his constituency.&lt;ref name="TrinEx"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.trinidadexpress.com/news/Media-reports-Jack-has-also-quit-as-UNC-chairman-204079481.html|title=Warner quits as UNC Chairman |date=22 April 2013 |work=Trinidad Express |accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TrinEx2"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.trinidadexpress.com/news/Jacks-Resignation-Letter-204892201.html|title=Jack's Resignation Letter...quits as Minister, Chairman, and MP|date=26 April 2013 |work=Trinidad Express |accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warner subsequently formed a new political party, the Independent Liberal Party (ILP), and won the by-election for Chaguanas West on 29 July.&lt;ref name="TrinEx3"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.trinidadexpress.com/news/JACK--ON-FIRE-217532131.html|title=Jack on Fire |date=30 July 2013 |work=Trinidad Express |accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warner contested [[Trinidad and Tobago general election, 2015|Trinidad and Tobago's 2015 General Election]] held on 7 September 2015 in the Chaguanas East seat. Warner received 771 votes (4.30%) and failed to win the seat in the election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebctt.com/wp-content/uploads/Results-of-the-Parliamentary-Election-Held-on-Monday-7th-September-2015.xlsx Results of the Parliamentary Election Held on Monday 7 September 2015]. ebctt.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/10/jack-warner-concedes-loss-of-seat-in-trinidad-and-tobago-parliament Jack Warner concedes loss of seat in Trinidad and Tobago parliament | Football].

After a long-running political feud, [[Surujrattan Rambachan]] sued Warner for defamation. In July 2016, Warner agreed to pay TT$375,000 as final settlement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ttwhistleblower.com/warner-to-pay-rambachan-375000/ "Warner to pay Rambachan $375,000," TTWhistleBlower, 22 July 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Janove Ottesen''' (born '''Jan Ove Ottesen''', 1975) is a Norwegian musician, born in [[Stord]], [[Hordaland]], [[Norway]]. He specializes in [[Singing|vocals]], [[guitar]] and [[barrels]], and is a leading member of the Norwegian band [[Kaizers Orchestra]].

==History==
=== Youth and first contact with music ===
[[Bryne]], where Ottesen grew up, had few activities available at the time other than [[football (soccer)|football]], so he was given a guitar by his grandmother when he was a child. Ottesen and his friend [[Geir Zahl]] began writing music in his cellar, recording their music on a cheap tape recorder.

The partnership between Ottesen and Zahl eventually evolved into the band [[Blod, Snått og Juling]]. In 1994 they produced their first studio album ''En glad tunnel'', which only sold 50 copies. They made a more serious attempt with better studio equipment for their second album, but this still only managed to sell around 100 copies.

=== gnom and Kaizers Orchestra ===
Ottesen moved to [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]] in 1995 to study. In 1996 he joined the [[Norwegian Armed Forces|army]], but soon after moved back to Bergen and became a music teacher. Upon his return Ottesen and Geir formed a new band [[gnom]]. They released the album ''Mys'' in 1998, but it sold poorly. After gnom's dissolution, the pair finally found critical success in forming the band [[Kaizers Orchestra]].

=== Solo career ===
After two albums had been released by Kaizers Orchestra, Janove decided to launch a parallel solo career while working on a third album ''Maestro'' (released in 2005). His 2004 solo album, ''Francis' Lonely Nights'' is entirely in English and contains 12 songs, two of which had their music videos filmed in [[Scandinavia]].

In September 2015 Ottesen announced he was returning to the mainstream music industry under the artist name Janove. His first single "Regnbuen Treffer Oss Ikkje Lenger" ("The Rainbow Doesn't Hit Us Anymore") premiered on [[Spellemannprisen]] on 30 January 2016 as he performed it live for the first time. He says his music will have influences of [[R'n'B]], [[hiphop]] and [[rap]] music". The lyrics will also be more modern than the fans might have gotten used to with Kaizers Orchestra.

=== Career as a producer and other music ===
In 2007, Kaizers decided to take a break for the majority of the year, only writing up demos for their fourth album and playing three concerts (including opening the German art expo [[Documenta]] festival). Janove took this opportunity to write music for ''Det Tusende Hjertet'', a family musical which opened in November 2007. In August 2007 he revealed that his next side project will not be a solo album, and that he has assembled another band (like fellow Kaizer bandmate [[Terje Winterstø Røthing]] and his band [[Skambankt]]).  Nothing is known about the status of this project.

Aside from his work with Kaizers and as an independent artist, he has also acted as producer for multiple albums, working with various artists with various styles, including Micke From Sweden (Folk), [[Britt-Synnøve Johansen]] (Tango), and The Brigade (Americana). He also participated in [[Geir Zahl|Geir "Uncle Deadly" Zahl's]] album [[:no:Monkey Do|Monkey Do]], that was released on 1 February 2010.

Ottesen is married and has two children. They live in [[Stavanger]].

[[File:Jayatu Sanskritam.jpg|thumb|One of the leader of jayatu Sanskitam Student Movement Pandit Ram Prasad Neupane receiving felicitation for his great work to bring democracy in Nepal]]

The '''Jayatu Sanskritam movement''' was begun in July 1947 by [[student]]s of the Tindhara School in [[Nepal]]. They demanded [[democracy]] and the inclusion of modern subjects in their [[curriculum]]. It was the first student [[uprising]] in Nepal's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gautama |first=Rājeśa |title=Nepali Congress |publisher=Adroit Publishers |date=January 5, 2005 |pages=138–140 |isbn=978-8-187-39261-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;


The students of tindhara pakshala (hostel) was also not unaffected by the anti-rana movements in Nepal. The hostel was so called because it had three taps. There were the students of Rajkiya Sanskrit Vidyalaya situated nearby the Ranipokhari. On 1 Asar, 2004 the students summited a demand paper to P.M Padma Shumsher requesting to introduce courses in geography, history,economics and political science too.  But the P.M paid no attention to their demand as a result they went on a strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/jayatu-sanskritam-marked/ |title=Jayatu Sanskritam marked |publisher=myRepublica |accessdate=1 Dec 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4610">'''Louise Doris Adams''' (died 1966) was a British [[mathematics education|mathematics educator]] and [[Ofsted#Inspectors|school inspector]] (HMI) who wrote the 1953 book ''A Background to Primary School Mathematics'' (Oxford University Press){{r|cook|edres}} and became president of the [[Mathematical Association]] for 1959.{{r|pres}}

==Life==
Adams earned a degree from [[Bedford College, London]], with second-class honours in mathematics in 1911.{{r|obit|ulhr}}
Her work as an inspector was centred on the [[West Country]] and particularly [[Bristol]].{{r|obit}}

She joined the [[Mathematical Association]] in approximately 1915,{{r|obit}} and became a member of the Teaching Sub-Committee of the Mathematical Association in 1946.{{r|melrose}}
When she became president of the Mathematical Association in 1959, she became only the second woman to hold that office since the association's founding in 1871, after [[Mary Cartwright]] in 1951,{{r|pres|obit}} and the second HMI, after W. C. Fletcher in 1939.{{r|pres|rollett}}

She died in 1966.{{r|obit}}

==Contributions==
Adams had "considerable experience as a teacher and inspector" and wrote her book, ''A Background to Primary School Mathematics'' (1953), on the basis of that experience.{{r|edres}} It was aimed at teachers of primary-school mathematics, and used case studies from approximately 80 students to advocate linking the teaching of mathematics to the individual experiences of the students.{{r|cook}} Her book "inspired many teachers" and prefigured a greater emphasis on play with mathematical tools over rote learning.{{r|breakell}}

As a member of the Teaching Sub-Committee of the Mathematical Association, Adams helped shift the association's focus "from teaching to learning"{{r|breakell}} and from what should be taught to how it should be taught.{{r|obit}}  Both her book and her presidential address to the Mathematical Association were a major impetus to the reform of mathematical education in the UK.{{r|breakell}}

'''Maria Dyer''' (née '''Tarn''') (c. 1803 &amp;ndash; 21 October 1846), was a British [[Protestant]] Christian [[missionary]] to the Chinese in the [[Congregational church|Congregationalist tradition]], who worked among the Chinese in [[British Malaya|Malaya]]. She arrived in [[Penang]] in 1827 with her husband, [[Samuel Dyer]]. She was the eldest daughter of Joseph Tarn, Director of [[London Missionary Society]]. The Dyers lived in [[Malacca]] and then finally in [[Singapore]]. Maria was known for founding the oldest girls' school in Singapore and East Asia that still exists called [[Saint Margaret's Primary School]]. Her husband died in [[Macau]] in 1843 before being able to bring his family to live in China itself at [[Fuzhou]]. Maria Tarn was later remarried, to [[Johann Georg Bausum]] in 1845, but she died the following year at Penang, at age 43, and was buried in the [[Old Protestant Cemetery, George Town|Protestant Cemetery]] there. Dyer's orphaned daughter, [[Maria Jane Dyer]], married [[James Hudson Taylor]], the founder of the [[China Inland Mission]].

Samuel and Maria had five children: Maria Dyer (1829-1831), Samuel Dyer Jr. (1833-1898), Burella Hunter Dyer (1835-1858), [[Maria Jane Dyer]] (1837-1870), and Ebenezer Dyer (1842-aft. Oct. 1843).

'''Maria L. Zhorella Fedorova''' (known as '''Maria Zhorella'''), November 8, 1915 – April 21, 2017,&lt;ref&gt;Death records, New York, New York; obit published in the National Edition of the New York Times on June 25, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; was a leading [[lyric soprano]] at the [[Vienna State Opera]], in the 1940s; also a political activist, vigorously opposing [[Nazism]] in [[Europe]] during [[World War II]]; and then, for three decades, a singing teacher in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, November 15, 2013, "Vocal Instructor Commands, 'Enough Nonsense, Sing!'"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United States Holocaust Memorial Collection, Washington, D.C., Record Type: Oral History; RG Number: RG- 50- 030*0625; Accession Number 2011. 117. Date 2011 June 05 (interview); Extent: 2 videocassettes (MiniDV)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Childhood==

In 1915, she was born into the aristocracy of [[Vienna, Austria]] to Luise Hubicki-Sas and Frank Brandstetter;&lt;ref&gt;Birth and Death Records, Vienna, Austria&lt;/ref&gt; and later grew up in [[Bratislava, Slovakia]]. When she was five, her strong-willed mother divorced her father despite society and the [[Catholic Church]] she attended forbidding it. And Maria was raised by Emil Prat, a step-father whom she loved.&lt;ref&gt;United States Holocaust Memorial Collection, Washington, D.C., Record Type: Oral History; RG Number: RG- 50- 030*0625; Accession Number 2011. 117. Date 2011 June 05 (interview); Extent: 2 videocassettes (MiniDV)&lt;/ref&gt;

Vienna, "City of Music" resounded with waltzes and symphonies; but as a child there was another music that also enchanted her, the trilling of birds. Their melodies would prompt her to get up, "when everybody was sleeping" and walk out onto her bedroom balcony where she would stand in the moonlight mesmerized by "the ideal, the singing of nightingales and other winged creatures...I was thinking about singing all the time...also [[Galli-Curci]]'s voice was always on my mind- the sweetness, the lightness, the emotion..." &lt;ref&gt;Contact: Bridge Stage of the Arts (Attn: Fedorova Archive, Writings) P.O.B. 1060, New York, New York 10024&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional beginnings==

Although unusual for a young woman of the upper class, with her parents' consent she began training in Vienna, as a singer.&lt;ref&gt;United States Holocaust Memorial Collection, Washington, D.C., Record Type: Oral History; RG Number: RG-50-030*0625; Accession Number: 2011.117; Date: 2011, June 05 (interview); Extent: 2 videocassettes (Mini/DV)&lt;/ref&gt; Her teacher, Wolfgang Steinbruch, "had the upper tones- I loved the sound. He taught me to sing with proper vocal technique- but with emotion! And he focused on the resonance, the vibration, and to always find the support. I loved this. He allowed me to fly!" A few years later, she was appearing on the radio performing Lieder and a cosmopolitan repertoire including folk songs in Slovakian, German, Hungarian, and Czech.&lt;ref&gt;Contact: Bridge Stage of the Arts (Attn: Fedorova Archive, Vocal Training and Career) P.O.B. 1060, New York, New York 10024&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and the political climate==

While studying voice, she married Eugen Fodor, who encouraged her to pursue her musical career. It was becoming dangerous to be a Jew and although her husband had a high position in the Slovakian commerce and tourist bureau, his father was Jewish, therefore he soon had to flee their home in Bratislava for [[Sweden]]. And at the end of the war, while making his way back to Bratislava, by train, he was shot in the back and killed.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, November 15, 2013, "Vocal Instructor Commands, 'Enough Nonsense, Sing!'"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Collection, Washington, D.C., Record Type: Oral History; RG Number: RG-50-030*0625; Accession Number: 2011.117; Date: 2011, June 05 (interview); Extent: 2 videocassettes (Mini/DV)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vienna State Opera==

In 1944, at the age of twenty-nine, Fedorova (wife of Fodor) was invited to join the [[Vienna State Opera]], one of the premier opera houses in the world. At first she played small roles. Among those she most enjoyed was Lola in Mascagni's [[Cavalleria Rusticana]], and particularly the fat, ugly cook with big bosoms and false teeth in [[Eugen d'Albert]]'s Tiefland (The Lowlands).&lt;ref&gt;United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Collection, Washington, D.C., Record Type: Oral History; RG Number: RG-50-030*0625; Accession Number: 2011.117; Date: 2011, June 05 (interview); Extent: 2 videocassettes (Mini/DV)&lt;/ref&gt;

She was a favorite soprano of the Austro- Hungarian composer, [[Franz Lehar]] who soon cast her in the title role of his [[The Merry Widow]] (a role she did not originate); and when she played Angele in Lehar's Count of Luxembourg the critics declared it her great breakthrough, praising her tremendous success in the role.&lt;ref&gt;Contact: Bridge Stage of The Arts (Attn: Fedorova Archive Career) POB 1060 New York, New York 10024&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Archives of the Vienna State Opera, Vienna, Austria&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political activism==

From the onset of World War II, Fedorova had also been part of the underground, hiding Jewish people in her cellar, escorting them to safety and providing them with forged papers. During this time she was able to save her Jewish teacher, Wolfgang Steinbruch, from internment in a concentration camp. But as a result of these activities, she was becoming a target for the [[Gestapo]] who eventually imprisoned and tortured her.&lt;ref&gt;United States Holocaust Memorial Collection, Washington, D.C., Record Type: Oral History; RG Number: RG-50-030*0625; Accession Number: 2011.117; Date: 2011, June 05 (interview); Extent: 2 videocassettes (Mini/DV)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, November 15, 2013, "Vocal Instructor Commands, 'Enough Nonsense, Sing!'"
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2015 Television interview by ORF Broadcaster: Österreichischer Rundfunk, the Austrian national public service broadcaster; Alexander Rauscher Producer/Director&lt;/ref&gt;

==The United States and close of her singing career==

A few years after the armistice, during the 1950s, she and her second husband, George Zhorella, emigrated to the [[United States]] and settled in New York City. The traumas of war had made it difficult for her to think about her past, including her life as a singer. And since she had come to associate the horrors of World War II with the sounds of the music she had made during those years, with a few exceptions, (such as her appearance on The Lipton Hour, where she sang the aria Vilja from The Merry Widow),&lt;ref&gt;NATIONAL Hollywood Recording Disc..."golden moments FOREVER RECORDED" (see Fedorova Archive, Recordings)&lt;/ref&gt; she chose not to perform, and her career as a singer came to a close.&lt;ref&gt;Contact: Bridge Stage of the Arts (Attn: Fedorova Archive, United States) P.O.B. 1060, New York, New York 10024&lt;/ref&gt;

==Singing teacher==

It was only through the urging of friends that finally, in the 1980s, she was able to consider re-entering the musical realm. And that is how The Zhorella Method of singing came into use, at [[Yale University]] and [[SUNY Purchase]] and then in her [[Upper West Side]] studio in [[Manhattan]], where she received trainees from all over the world and the bouquets they brought her;&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, November 15, 2013, "Vocal Instructor Commands, 'Enough Nonsense, Sing!'"&lt;/ref&gt; and where she specialized in "repairing damaged voices" &lt;ref&gt;Contact: Bridge Stage of the Arts (Attn: Fedorova Archive, Writings) P.O.B. 1060, New York, New York 10024&lt;/ref&gt; until a few weeks before her death on April 21, 2017 at the age of 101.&lt;ref&gt;Death Records, New York City&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Zhorella Method==

"Teaching is my life." (Maria Zhorella Fedorova, New York City, 2015)

The Zhorella Method is known for enabling singers even in their 1970s and older to sing with the voices they had when they were in their prime:

"Her style of teaching is one of infinite patience. And she is relentless and time and again would say, "Do it again, do it again- sing deep, sing back, sing deep, sing back". Once when we met at the Metropolitan Opera, she began giving me a lesson in the aisle. She asked, "Are you singing deep? Are you singing back?" And made me show her right there! She has changed my voice. Since I have established this technique with Maria I can sing and talk the night before and not be hoarse the next morning. And after five decades of performing, under Maria's tutelage I recently achieved my first high C, and did so with ease. Her method enables a singer's voice to stay young decades beyond what is considered its 'normal' life-span." (Cabaret and Concert Performer, Steve Ross, New York City, 2015)&lt;ref&gt;Contact: Bridge Stage of the Arts (Attn: Fedorova Archive, The Zhorella Method of singing) P.O.B. 1060, New York, New York 10024&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2015 Television interview by ORF Broadcaster: Österreichischer Rundfunk, the Austrian national public service broadcaster; Alexander Rauscher Producer/Director&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''marine mammal park''' (also known as '''marine animal park''' and sometimes '''[[oceanarium]]''') is a [[Commercialism|commercial]] [[amusement park|theme park]] or [[aquarium]] where [[marine mammal]]s such as [[dolphin]]s, [[beluga whale]]s and [[sea lion]]s are kept within water tanks and displayed to the public in special shows. A marine mammal park is more elaborate than a [[dolphinarium]], because it also features other marine mammals and offers additional [[entertainment]] attractions. It is thus seen as a combination of a public [[aquarium]] and an [[amusement park]]. Marine mammal parks are different from [[marine park]]s, which include natural reserves and marine wildlife sanctuaries such as coral reefs, particularly in Australia.

==History==
[[Sea Lion Park]] opened in 1895 at [[Coney Island]] in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]] with an aquatic show featuring 40 [[sea lion]]s. It closed in 1903.

The second marine mammal park, then called an [[oceanarium]], was established in [[St. Augustine, Florida]] in 1938.  It was initially a large water tank used to exhibit marine mammals for filming underwater movies, and only became later a public attraction. Today [[Marineland of Florida]] claims to be "the world’s first oceanarium".

In November 1961, [[Marineland of the Pacific]] on the [[Palos Verdes Peninsula]], near [[Los Angeles]] in [[California]] was the first [[park]] to display an [[orca]] in [[captivity (animal)|captivity]], although the orca died after two days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marinelandofthepacific.org/animalcollection/killerwhales.html |title=Eye to Eye with Orky and Corky |publisher=Marinelandofthepacific.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407200527/http://www.marinelandofthepacific.org/animalcollection/killerwhales.html |archivedate=2014-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Vancouver Aquarium]] was responsible for the first [[orca]] ever held alive in [[captivity (animal)|captivity]], [[Moby Doll]], for 3 months in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inkokomo.com/dolphin/orca.html The Capture of Orcas.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013021540/http://www.inkokomo.com/dolphin/orca.html |date=October 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the 1970s and the 1990s, technical advances and the public's increasing interest in aquatic environments prompted a shift to large marine mammal parks with cetaceans (mostly orcas and other species of dolphin) as attractions. Within this time [[SeaWorld|SeaWorld USA]] evolved as the most prominent chain of marine mammal parks, with operations in [[Orlando, Florida]], [[San Diego, California]], [[San Antonio, Texas]], and [[Aurora, Ohio]] (which has since closed down).

==Criticism and animal welfare==
Many [[animal welfare]] groups, such as the [[World Society for the Protection of Animals|WSPA]], consider keeping whales and dolphins in [[captivity (animal)|captivity]] a form of abuse. The main argument is that whales and dolphins do not have enough [[freedom of movement]] within their artificial environments. The existence of marine mammal parks is thus very controversially discussed.

Although sizable pools for whales and dolphins require an extraordinarily technical and financial expenditure and are usually nearly impossible to provide and maintain, many marine mammal parks endeavour to improve the conditions of captivity and attempt to engage in public education as well as scientific studies. For that purpose many marine mammal parks joined together in the "Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums", an international association dedicated to high standard of care of marine mammals. It was founded in 1987 and established offices near [[Washington, DC]], in 1992.

In 2010, the practice of keeping animals in captivity as trained show performers was heavily criticized when a trainer was killed by an [[Orca Whale]] at [[SeaWorld Orlando]] in [[Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Talk of the Nation |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=124205447 |title=Limited Understanding Of Animals In Theme Parks |publisher=NPR |date=2010-03-01 |accessdate=2014-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orcas attacks have been documented in the film ''[[Blackfish (film)|Blackfish]]'', released in 2013. In 2015, the [[California Coastal Commission]] banned the breeding of captive killer whales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=California bans captive breeding of SeaWorld killer whales|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/09/california-bans-captive-breeding-of-seaworld-killer-whales|accessdate=19 February 2016|work=The Guardian|date=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maths &amp; Computering College.png|thumb|Logo used to show Mathematics and Computing special status.]]'''Mathematics and Computing Colleges''' were introduced in [[England]] in 2002 as part of the Government's [[Specialist school|Specialist Schools Programme]] which was designed to raise standards in 8-[[secondary education]]. Specialist schools focus specifically on their chosen specialism but must also meet the requirements of the [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]] and deliver a broad and balanced education to all their pupils. Mathematics and Computing Colleges must focus on mathematics and either computing or [[ICT (education)|ICT]].

Colleges are expected to disseminate good practice and share resources with other schools and the wider community. They often develop active partnerships with local organisations and their feeder [[primary school]]s. They also work with local businesses to promote the use of mathematics and computing outside of school.

In 2007 there were 222 schools in England which were designated as specialist Mathematics and Computing Colleges. A further 21 schools have been designated in combined specialisms which include mathematics and computing, and 15 schools have a second specialism in Mathematics and Computing.

'''''McDonald's Video Game''''' is a [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] [[Online game|online game]] published and developed by [[Italy|Italian]]-based La [[Molleindustria]].&lt;ref name="bluestein" /&gt; It is described as an "anti-[[advergame]]", meaning a satire of various companies and its business practices.&lt;ref name="tiwari"&gt;Tiwari, Neha. "[https://archive.is/20130121042604/http://news.com.com/8301-10784_3-6090885-7.html Cow slaughtering with Ronald McDonald]", [[CNET]] News, published July 5, 2006, accessed April 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

''McDonald's Video Game'' is a [[parody]] of the business practices of the corporate giant [[McDonald's]], taking the guise of a tycoon style business simulation game. The game presents the player with four views: The farmland, the slaughterhouse, the restaurant and the corporate HQ.&lt;ref name="tiwari" /&gt; Through each of these views, decisions can be made which will affect the fate of the player's company. In the game, the player plays the role of a McDonald's CEO, choosing whether or not to feed the player's cows genetically altered grain,&lt;ref name="gerson"&gt;Gerson, Jeff. "[https://www.thestar.com/Special/article/119120 Bully beats back game critics]", The [[Toronto Star]], published November 15, 2006, accessed April 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; plow over rainforests or feed the player's cattle to other cattle (a practice known to spread [[mad cow disease]]). The player can also choose advertising strategies and public official corruption to counteract opponents of the player's actions.

Some choices within the game such as the opportunity to demolish villages or bribe public officials paint the corporation in a negative light. These aspects of the game are unflattering to McDonald's who issued a statement saying that the game "has no association with McDonald's and is therefore a complete misrepresentation of our people and our values."&lt;ref name="bluestein"&gt;Bluestien, Greg. "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/20/AR2007012000729.html?nav=hcmodule Creators Put Politics Into Video Games]", The [[Associated Press]], published January 21, 2007, accessed April 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On some websites, La Molleindustria released a version of the game called ''Burger Tycoon'' which is exactly the same except that it eliminates all mention of McDonald's such as the franchise logo and a bear replacing the [[Ronald McDonald]] mascot. This was done in order to avoid copyright sanctions.

The game has been translated into nine languages; English, Spanish, Italian, Finnish, Danish, Turkish, Portuguese, French and German.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcvideogame.com/ McDonald's Videogame splash page], accessed April 7, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Metropolitan University of Educational Sciences''' ({{lang-es|link=no|Universidad Metropolitana de Ciencias de la Educación}} (UMCE), is a public and traditional [[university]] located in the commune of [[Ñuñoa]], [[Chile]]. It is the fourth oldest university in the country, founded in [[1889]] as [[college]] of the University of Chile.

== History ==
===Origins===
[[File:TumbaDomeyko.JPG|thumb|left|Ignacio Domeyko, a Chilean-Polish scientist and professor at the National Institute of Chile, was the first intellectual to point out the need for an institution dedicated to the science of pedagogy.]]
[[Ignacio Domeyko]], scientist and professor of the [[Instituto Nacional General José Miguel Carrera| National Institute José Miguel Carrera]], manifests for the first time -during one year of 1842- the need to change the education system in [[Chile]], inspired by the models that are being implemented in [[Europe]] where it was starting to develop a new science: pedagogy. At that time, Domeyko was a young immigrant in the university lessons around his homeland, particularly in [[Paris]], [[France]], he gave a lot of knowledge that was not limited to the natural sciences, if it was not an innovation in ideas for the organization that did not find education in this country, and that motivated him to start a slow but significant intellectual work.

The proposal of the Polish-nationalized Chilean teacher was that a [[normal school]] was created similar to the one he had known by the hand of the French philosopher Victor Cousin. In this project, use a dozen of the laws that were granted from the liberal government of Francisco Antonio Pinto and Diaz de la Puente to the National Institute in 1829, students from all over the country, settle in a special department of the prominent lyceum for two years, reviewing the studies that have already been taught in their schools, and then specialize in the area they are most interested in for another two years at the university.

[[Diego Barros Arana]], philosopher and historian, assumes the rector of the [[Instituto Nacional General José Miguel Carrera|National Institute]] between 1863 and 1872. Noticing from the outset the lack of preparation of Chilean teaching staff, he also realized that even under the direction of this institution, which had the best national teachers (among them the professors Amunátegui, Vendel-Heyl, Lobeck, Pizarro) 14, the teaching was rough and did not have the didactics that he considered necessary. In this period, he would create a failed Teachers' Association.

Many intellectuals were educated by this eminent historian (who before becoming rector, was professor since 1838 in which he is also his alma mater) among which Valentín Letelier, the main intellectual manager of the Pedagogical Institute, who would be strongly moved with the way of educating Arana, who never stopped visiting the classrooms or the students, concerned at all times not to be a simple minister of faith in charge of certifying a certain event, but to excite, interest and guide the intelligences educated.

Its creation was firmly defended by numerous statesmen and teachers, among whom Don Valentín Letelier distinguished himself, who defended the Pedagogical with so much integrity that he even affirmed that suppressing it is making it impossible to train Chilean professors; is to make us perpetual tributaries of foreign pedagogy. Especially influenced by the aforementioned experience he had with Barros Arana during his basic studies:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In Chile it is generally believed that any engineer can be a good teacher of mathematics, that every doctor is competent in the natural sciences, and that the teaching of the humanities is put in good hands when entrusted to lawyers. This is a very serious error because the most proper thing to assess the suitability of a teacher is not his knowledge, it is his didactics."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:BibliotecaIN.JPG|thumb|The Pedagogical Institute of Chile (now UMCE) was initially thought of as an independent department attached to the prestigious [[Instituto Nacional General José Miguel Carrera|National Institute of Chile]].]]
Manuel Montt would try to take up Domeyko's original idea of annexing the hypothetical Pedagogical Institute to the National Institute, which would award 20 scholarships for aspiring professors, but in doing so it would be inevitable to absorb the old establishment for the new one, as had happened before when the [[Instituto Nacional General José Miguel Carrera]] disarmed the entire building and academic body of the [[Royal University of San Felipe]] in 1813, so the idea was discarded.

===The Pedagogical Institute===
In 1888, during the government of the liberal president [[José Manuel Balmaceda]], the Minister of Justice, Worship and Public Instruction (equivalent to the current Ministry of Education) Federico Puga Borne - as well as Letelier, a former institute and former student of Professor Arana - builds the formation decree of the Pedagogical Institute of the University of Chile, which safeguarded the budget that allowed to give life to the project after 40 years of waiting. The sum was forty thousand Chilean pesos, and was signed the following year by the new minister Julio Bañados Espinosa on April 29, 1889.

Minister Bañados contacted [[Valentín Letelier]] and Claudio Matte, who were members of the Chilean delegation in Germany between 1883 and 1885 where they studied the German education system (Matte served as a translator for Letelier, since he was the only one who handled the German language) to implement it in the institution. Later, the future teachers would be precisely Germans.

The pedagogical was born as a boarding school, free of charge and with the obligation to provide housing, food and board to the fellows. Education was divided into two axes: humanities and sciences. Humanities was separated into four courses: Castilian / Latin, French / Greek, English / German and History / Geography. While science would be divided into mathematics and natural sciences.

Letelier knew how to channel and cement the aspirations in an establishment of international renown that took the name of Institute, since it was created under the auspices of the prestigious University of Chile, but with a modern constitution that favored research and teaching in topics related to the pedagogy, as it was used in European universities and institutes such as the Institute for Political Studies in Paris or the Colleges of Cambridge University. This model served as an example not only in Chile, where the University of Concepción highlighted with a department of teacher training created in 1919 with the same guidelines of El peda, but also in Latin America. They would be pioneers in pedagogical training in the continent. The work of the Pedagogical Institute was so important that about 80% of Chilean teachers were trained in these classrooms, coming to be considered one of the most prestigious teacher training centers in America. Numerous Pedagogical Missions were destined to form new Pedagogical Centers in other countries like Venezuela and Costa Rica.
===First Academic Group===
[[File:Pedagógico.png|thumb|left|The Pedagogical Institute]]
Minister Puga commissioned for the first time in 1888 the ambassador of [[Chile]] in [[Berlin]], Domingo Gana Cruz, six professors of higher education: one of philosophy, one of history and geography, one third of philology, one quarter of mathematics, one fifth of physical sciences and a last of natural sciences. Thus, the ambassador understood that his future depended on the pedagogical, which for the founders of the institution, was ideal.

A select group of German teachers with extensive experience was hired who with exclusive dedication could create their chairs and dedicate themselves to research, the first academic body of the Pedagogical Institute was constituted by a Chilean, Enrique Nercasseau and Morán, and by the German professors:

*Augusto Tafelmacher, professor of mathematics, graduated from the well-known [[University of Göttingen]], published more than twenty studies in the Annals of Mathematical and Natural Sciences of Leipzig and the Annals of the [[University of Chile]] on mathematics, educational methods and Fermat's theorem, fact particularly remarkable since in these years nobody had written about mathematics in Chile.

*Jorge Enrique Schneider (pedagogy, philosophy, logic, methodology, moral and philosophy of science). German that since adolescence that manifested his vocation. He studied Philosophy and Zoology at the [[University of Jena]] and then Pedagogy at the [[University of Leipzig]]. Known also for founding the Liceo de Aplicacion as a small academy for young people of middle and upper class and that was dependent on the Pedagogical Institute.

*Federico Albert Botanist, paleontologist and ornithologist, professor of natural sciences. Son of a merchant from Lübeck. He received his doctorate at the University of Strasbourg with a dissertation called The Commodity Metric Art. In 1883 he received the title to teach and already in Chile was a collaborator of the Annals of the [[University of Chile]].

*Hans Steffen (history and geography). The youngest academic in the Germanic group, and that however, according to Baron Richthroten, professor at the [[Berlin University]] of Young Steffen, "in the art of teaching, was superior to his peers who had long years of experience "

*Federico Hanssen (philology, general grammar, linguistics, Latin, Greek, French, English, German, rhetoric and literary history).

*Reinaldo Von Lilienthal (arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry and mechanics, who spent a few months in Chile and returned to Germany, where he stood out as one of the greatest mathematicians of his time and was replaced by Augusto Tafelmacher, who practiced until 1907) .

*Federico Johow, notable botanist, who was appointed as the first director of the Pedagogical Institute (natural sciences, biology, zoology, botany and hygiene); nephew of a jurisconsult of the same name who was minister in the Supreme Court of Prussia. In 1880 he received the title of [[PhD]] in Philosophy and in 1882 the faculty of docenti, that is, the certification to practice university teaching. He was also assistant at the Botanical Institute of the [[University of Bonn]], in 1883 he was commissioned by the Academy of Sciences of Berlin to study the Antilles and sectors of Venezuela. Professor Johow had published and continued to publish in the Gazette of Botany of Leipzig, in the Annals of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Berlin and others, including later the Annals of the University of Chile.

*Rodolfo Lenz (grammar). He taught the "living languages", studied almost all the Neo-Latin dialects, Old French, Modern, Provencal, Italian, Spanish, Gothic, Old and Modern German, Old Saxon, English, Arabic, Greek, Russian and Latin. Today in the current UMCE there is bibliographic material from the 19th century and early twentieth century of original authors in a library that bears his name (Historical Library of the Pedagogical Institute "Rodolfo Lenz).

*Alfredo Beutell (chemistry and mineralogy). doctor of philosophy in 1879 and facultas docenti in 1885, assistant of the Laboratory of Chemistry of the [[University of Breslau]] and of the [[University of Greifswald]]. Important public studies on the chemical composition and optical properties of feldspars, on the precision pipette, on the water torch, on the spontaneous vial valve, etc.

Most of the teachers who came to the old Pedagogical Institute did so, in part, due to the large number of European war conflicts and the exhaustive anti-Semitic persecution. On this, the famous Chilean philosopher [[Carla Cordua]] remembers her first year at the Ricardo Cumming Street house in the following way:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We had, due to the [[National Socialist]] racial persecution in Europe, many very prominent and famous Jewish professors, who came to Spanish-America, many to [[Argentina]], others arrived to [[Chile]], and in that sense, their misfortune was our luck, because We had fabulous teachers, completely exceptional for the general level of Chilean university studies. (...) these people were completely exceptional, and had been scammed from Europe, particularly in Germany, but also in other countries that are anti-Semitic to this day.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Early 20th century ===
Despite the insistence of Letelier in leaving the Pedagogical to the wing of the Faculty of Philosophy and Humanities of the University of Chile, only at the end of 1890 the house of studies accepted this request by order of the Council of Public Instruction. This fact is extremely important for the consolidation of the university status that still preserves the pedagogical profession. Until the end of the 19th century teachers had been trained very precariously in the Normal Schools of Chile. The management of the Institute was handed over to the German Fr Friedrich Richard Adelbart Johow18 and his first generation of professors graduated in 1896.

[[File:Fachada_Cumming_29_en_1920.jpg|thumb|right|Facade of the Lyceum of Application in Cumming Street in the year 1920, located next to the house that was the first headquarters of the Pedagogical Institute until 1949.|244x244px]]
==== Liceo de Aplicación ====
The minister of public instruction of Jorge Montt's government, Joaquín Rodríguez Rosas, issued the supreme decree No. 1554 creating the Application Lyceum, attached to the Pedagogical Institute, which began operating on March 28, 1892, with the objective of giving a space for new teachers to practice their skills with a select group of middle and upper class students from Santiago:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"(...) whose vacancies are disputed every year by hundreds of parents"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first rector of this annexed establishment was the German professor of philology, philosophy and pedagogy (graduated from the University of Jena and Leipzig), Mr. Jorge Enrique Schneider, who had installed the idea of the [[Liceo de Aplicación]] in a report delivered on October 10. 1890 to the Council of Professors of Chile with the support of the director of the Pedagogical Institute, the also German, [[Friedrich Richard Adelbart Johow]].

The first classes of the lyceum were made in a small room located in Manuel Rodriguez street, and had the particularity that they taught subjects not taught in the pedagogical such as gymnastics, singing and drawing until the success of the project increased the initial enrollment of a couple of dozens to more than 100 students per year forced to buy an installation attached to the mansion of the Cumming house. Being so close to the central house of the Pedagogical Institute further improved its educational quality and prestige, positioning it at the level of such prestigious schools as the General National Institute José Miguel Carrera or the School of the Sacred Hearts of Santiago.

====Growth and social movements of the early twentieth century====
The creation of the Institute increased the enrollment of the University of Chile considerably. 15% of the enrolled (of a total 1056 for the year 1901) were future teachers, in 1900 there were 210 enrolled and in 1917 the number increased to almost 600. It should be noted that of the 1098 students housed the pedagogical in 1921 , more than half were women, becoming the first instance of massive female entry to the university in the country. This increase also meant difficulties, since the old mansion of Cumming with Alameda, which also housed a small number of students from the Lyceum of Application, could not cope and the rooms soon became insufficient. The lack of was such that even the Peda, being saturated, sporadically received students from the School of Pharmacy and the Dental School, belonging to the Faculty of Medicine.

At the beginning of the 1920s, the politics of Chile - and the world - would be confronted with new ideologies and movements that would surpass the traditional political parties completely. In this sense, the university student movement took a greater maturity to understand and deal with the issues that stressed the Chilean conflict, and that the possibility of [[socialism]] came to power for the first time in national history. The students at that time showed their disagreement with the prevailing political and social system and strongly supported the workers' movement. The [[Student Federation of the University of Chile]], which was relatively new, was composed mainly of students of the Pedagogical Institute among which Rudecindo Ortega, José Domingo Gómez Rojas, Pedro León Loyola, [[Pablo de Rokha]], [[Juan Gómez Millas]] (who would end disappointed) of the left and socialism, years later would form the Nationalist Union Party of Chile, a fascist movement) and above all, [[Eugenio González Rojas]], philosophy student who came to preside over the FECH between 1922 and 1923 and was Minister of Education of the Republic Socialist of Chile (this former student also founded the Federation of Secondary Students of Santiago during his stay at the National General Institute José Miguel Carrera). Years later, González travels to Venezuela to create the Pedagogical Institute of Caracas. Upon returning he is appointed Director of the Pedagogical and later Rector of the University of Chile
===Pioneers in Psychological Research===
[[File:BibliothecaAlbertina_Leipzig.jpg|left|thumb|The [[University of Leipzig]] was the first to create an experimental laboratory of psychology and inspired professors Mann and Schneider to create the first university simile in Chile under the tutelage of [[Wilhelm Wundt]] himself.]]
With the twentieth century, [[Experimental Psychology]] began in Chile. This had a magnificent boom thanks to professors Guillermo Mann and J.E. Schnider who created the Laboratory of Experimental Psychology, which inaugurated the experimental movement in the country. Although, since 1889 both professors were teaching psychology, it was not until 1908 that Mann was appointed to buy modern instruments and bibliographical material in [[Europe]], establishing in a solid manner the laboratory that aimed to have the characteristics that [[Wilhelm Wundt]] used in his [[University of Leipzig]]. This would be the first psychology laboratory in a Chilean university institution21 and Wundt himself would have oriented the two teachers to the selection of instruments. While most of the instruments came from Leipzig, there was also a considerable amount of material purchased in Berlin, Paris and Milan.

Despite the good performance of this initiative, the lack of state funding (it stopped being subsidized in 1917) meant its early closure. Today, part of the laboratory survives in the Department of Psychology of the current Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Chile. About these Guillermo Mann declared in a report to the Rector Valentín Letelier:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The office of the instruments destined for psychological research can not be other than that of fixing of an exact and measurable physical conditions relations with the psychological processes that are being studied (...) We can distinguish between the methods of the psychological experiment the categories : first, methods of stimulation. Second, methods of measuring the time of psychic processes. Third, methods of determining the expressions or manifestations of these processes. And fourth, methods of measuring physical phenomena, related to psychic facts indirectly&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mann's laboratory was reopened by Luis A. Tirapegui, a psychologist at Columbia University, who wanted to promote the advances of experimental psychology along the lines of his predecessor, the field of education and pedagogical initiatives such as the adaptation of the Binet-Terman scale to the Chilean context.20

This reopening encouraged other universities to create their own versions of the Pedagogical Laboratory, such as the Psychotechnology Laboratory of the University of Concepción, whose material was similar to the original. A laboratory was also born in the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile and the Normal School of Copiapó with which there were several intellectual clashes in which the liberal and conservative positions of each other clashed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6597">The Museum of Light (Spanish Museo de la Luz) is a [[science museum]] dedicated to the phenomena of light, located in the former [[San Ildefonso College]] in the [[historic center of Mexico City]]. It was opened in 1996 originally in the former church of the [[San Pedro y San Pablo College, Mexico City|San Pedro y San Pablo College]]. However, this building was closed in 2010 in order to convert it into the Museum of the Constitutions. The Museum of Light was moved to its current and larger location, but it remains an extension of the [[Universum (UNAM)|Universum museum]], the general science museum of the [[Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México]].

==Museum==
The Museum of Light is located in the “Colegio Chico” portion of the former San Ildefonso College.&lt;ref name=conocenos&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museodelaluz.unam.mx/conocenos |title=Conócenos |publisher=Museum of Light|location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=Get to know us |accessdate=June 25, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It operates as an extension of the Universum museum, the general science museum of the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México.&lt;ref name=guiacentro&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guiadelcentrohistorico.mx/content/museo-de-la-luz|title= Museo de la Luz |work=Guia del Centro Historico |publisher=Government of Mexico City |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=Museum of Light |accessdate=June 25, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum occupies two floors of the building, with most of the rooms dedicated to permanent exhibits and two others for temporary exhibits and shows.&lt;ref name=cierre&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aunamnoticias.blogspot.mx/2011/08/cierre-y-reubicacion-del-museo-de-la.html|title= Cierre y reubicación del Museo de la Luz  |publisher=UNAM noticias |location=Mexico City |date=August 11, 2011|language=Spanish |trans-title=Close and relocation of the Museum of Light |accessdate=June 25, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum explores the different facets of light phenomenon and its relationships to various sciences.&lt;ref name=conocenos/&gt; There are six major permanent exhibits along with an area to hold workshops. The Nature of Light exhibition explores the basic principles of light with exhibits that demonstrate its physics, the working of mirrors, the electromagnetic spectrum and a darkroom.&lt;ref name=naturaleza&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museodelaluz.unam.mx/exposiciones/naturaleza |title=Naturaleza de la luz |publisher=Museum of Light|location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=Nature of light |accessdate=June 25, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Light of the Stars exhibit focuses on the chemistry and other aspects of these celestial bodies and how they are discovered through the light they emit.&lt;ref name=estrellas&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.museodelaluz.unam.mx/exposiciones/estrellas|title= La luz de las estrellas |publisher=Museum of Light|location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=Light of the stars |accessdate=June 25, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A World of Colors focuses how colors are generated and perceived as well as how they are taken advantage of in nature.&lt;ref name=mundo&gt;{{cite web |url=  http://www.museodelaluz.unam.mx/exposiciones/colores|title= Un mundo de colores |publisher=Museum of Light|location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=A world of colors |accessdate=June 25, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Light in the Arts reflects on how light, the illusion of light and color are used in this field.&lt;ref name=lasartes&gt;{{cite web |url=   http://www.museodelaluz.unam.mx/exposiciones/artes|title= La luz en las artes |publisher=Museum of Light|location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=Light in the arts |accessdate=June 25, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Light and the Biosphere focuses on how light is important to life, with photosynthesis as the basis for the food chain.&lt;ref name=biosfera&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.museodelaluz.unam.mx/exposiciones/biosfera|title= La luz en la biosfera |publisher=Museum of Light|location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=Light in the biosphere |accessdate=June 25, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The last section is called Vision, which focuses on how eyes work.&lt;ref name=lavision&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.museodelaluz.unam.mx/exposiciones/vision|title= La visión |publisher=Museum of Light|location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=Vision |accessdate=June 25, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The museum was opened in 1996, originally in the former church of the San Pedro y San Pablo College, one block from the current location. This church building was renovated in the mid 1990s for the purpose of the museum after being abandoned for twenty years prior. The idea for the museum was the brainchild of Jorge Flores along with [[Ana María Cetto]] and [[Luis de la Peña]], initiated the idea of creating a museum dedicated to electromagnetic radiation, commonly known as light.&lt;ref name=cierre/&gt;&lt;ref name="fierro"&gt;{{cite book |title= Templo del Colegio Máximo de San Pedro y San Pablo: Museo de la Luz : 400 años de historia |last=Fierro Gossman |first=Rafael R. |year=2003 |publisher=UNAM |location=Mexico City |isbn=970-32-1105-4 |language=Spanish |pages=10–15  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the decision was made to close the Museum of Light in that location and replace it with a museum dedicated to the various constitutions that Mexico has had since its independence as part of [[Celebration of Mexican political anniversaries in 2010|Mexico’s Bicentennial of Independence and Centennial of the Revolution]]. The building was closed in February of that year, and the Museo de las Constitutiones was opened in 2011. After closure, the future of the museum of light was in doubt. One proposal was to merge it into the Universum facility, but this was rejected due to fears that the museum would disappear completely. Instead, in late 2010, the decision was made to move the museum to another building in the historic center of Mexico City also owned by UNAM, the San Ildefonso College. The new space is larger than the old and the museum reopened in 2011.&lt;ref name=cierre/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2760">The '''National Apprenticeship Act''' (also known as the '''Fitzgerald Act'''), is a federal law in the [[United States]] which regulates [[apprenticeship]] and on-the-job training programs.

Apprentice programs in the U.S. were largely unregulated until 1934. After passage of the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]] (NIRA), industry, [[trade unions]] and the [[National Recovery Administration]] cooperated to fashion various "industry codes" to govern competition, wages, working conditions and quality of products and services. One aspect of the general construction industry code was a set of rules regulating apprenticeship programs in the construction industry.

The NIRA was declared unconstitutional by the [[United States Supreme Court]] in May 1935.

To continue the work for the construction industry code authority in regard to apprenticeship programs, [[United States Secretary of Labor]] [[Frances Perkins]] established the [[Federal Committee on Apprenticeship]]. Composed of representatives from federal government agencies, Perkins tasked the committee to recommend federal policies regarding apprenticeships.

In 1937, the Congress passed the National Apprenticeship Act (29 U.S.C. 50), also known as "the Fitzgerald Act." The Act established a national advisory committee whose task was to research and draft regulations to establish minimum standards for apprenticeship programs. The Act was later amended to permit the [[United States Department of Labor]] to issue regulations protecting the health, safety and general welfare of apprentices, and to encourage the use of contracts in the hiring and employment of them.

The Fitzgerald Act is administered by the Employment and Training Administration in the Department of Labor. The standards governing apprenticeship programs are located in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations at Title 29, CFR Part 29.  Regulations banning racial, ethnic, religious, age and gender discrimination in apprenticeship programs are located at Title 29, CFR Part 30.

'''Niels Kaj Jerne''', [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]]&lt;ref name="frs"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Askonas | first1 = B. A. | authorlink1 = Brigitte Askonas| last2 = Howard | first2 = J. G. | doi = 10.1098/rsbm.1997.0013 | title = Niels Kaj Jerne. 23 December 1911—7 October 1994| journal = [[Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society]] | volume = 43 | page = 237 | year = 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (23 December 1911 – 7 October 1994) was a Danish [[immunologist]]. He shared the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1984 with [[Georges J. F. Köhler]] and [[César Milstein]] "for theories concerning the specificity in development and control of the immune system and the discovery of the principle for production of [[monoclonal antibodies]]".

Jerne is known for three significant ideas. Firstly, instead of the body producing antibodies in response to an antigen, Jerne postulated that the immune system already has the specific antibodies it needs to fight antigens. Secondly, it was known that the immune system learns to be tolerant to the individual's own self. Jerne postulated that this learning takes place in the thymus. Thirdly, it was known that T cells and B cells communicate with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ivan Lefkovits|title=Portrait of the Immune System: Scientific Publications of Niels Kaj Jerne|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g7-N9je0b-oC&amp;pg=PA748|year=1996|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-02-2614-5|pages=745-748}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jerne's network theory proposed that the active sites of antibodies are attracted to both specific antigens (idiotypes) and to other antibodies that bind to the same site. The antibodies are in balance, until an antigen disturbs the balance, stimulating an immune reaction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1984/jerne-facts.html Niels K. Jerne – Facts]. nobelprize.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
His ancestors had lived on the small Danish island of [[Fanø]] for centuries, but, in 1910, his parents moved to London where Jerne was born in 1911.&lt;ref name=nobelbio&gt;{{citation|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1984: Niels K. Jerne – autobiography|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1984/jerne-autobio.html|publisher=Nobelprize.org|accessdate=20 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the [[First World War]] his parents moved to the [[Netherlands]] and Jerne spent his youth in [[Rotterdam]]. After studying physics for two years at the [[Leiden University]], Jerne moved to Copenhagen and changed his studies to the field of medicine. He graduated from the [[University of Copenhagen]] with a degree in medicine in 1947. Four years later, he was awarded the doctorate for his thesis, ''A Study of Avidity Based on Rabbit Skin Responses to Diphtheria Toxin-Antitoxin Mixtures''.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

==Research positions==
From 1943 to 1956 Jerne was a research worker at the [[Statens Serum Institut|Danish National Serum Institute]] and during this time he formulated a theory on [[antibody]] formation. It is said that Jerne got his revolutionary scientific idea while bicycling across the [[Langebro]] bridge in [[Copenhagen]] on his way home from work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dubiski|first=S.|date=10 March 2004|title=Science as Autobiography: The Troubled Life of Niels Jerne|journal=JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association|volume=291|issue=10|pages=1267–1268|doi=10.1001/jama.291.10.1267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[antibody]] formation theory gave Jerne international recognition and in 1956 Jerne went to work for the [[World Health Organization]] in Geneva, where he served as the Head of the Sections of Biological Standards and of [[Immunology]]. He held this post for six years until moving to the United States and the [[University of Pittsburgh]] in 1962 to work as Professor of [[Microbiology]] and Chairman of the [[University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine|Department of Microbiology]] for four years. Jerne continued to do work for the [[World Health Organization]] as a member of the Expert Advisory Panel of [[Immunology]] from 1962 and onwards.

In 1966 Jerne moved back to Europe and took up the position of Professor of Experimental Therapy at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University]] in Frankfurt. From 1966 to 1969 he was the Director of the [[Paul-Ehrlich-Institut (Germany)|Paul-Ehrlich-Institut]], also in [[Frankfurt]]. In 1969 Jerne again switched jobs, this time to [[Basel]] in Switzerland, where he was the Director of the [[Basel Institute for Immunology]] until his retirement in 1980. During the 1970s and 1980s, Jerne was a pioneer in the development of [[immune network theory]].

According to Jerne's biographer Thomas Söderqvist, Jerne was not a bench scientist, could not pipette accurately, and did not enjoy experimental work. His Nobel Prize was awarded for theories, rather than discoveries. Jerne developed the "natural selection theory of immunology", proposed by [[Paul Ehrlich]] 50 years earlier, although he was missing the clonal selection element proposed by [[David Talmage]] and then by [[Frank Macfarlane Burnet]]. It was met by skepticism among his colleagues at first, [[James Watson]] for example told Jerne bluntly that his theory "stinks".&lt;ref name="Yewdell"&gt;{{cite journal|title=He put the Id in Idiotype; book review of Science As Autobiography The Troubled Life of Niels Jerne by Thomas Söderqvist|journal=EMBO Rep.|date=October 2003|first=Jonathan W.|last=Yewdell|volume=4|issue=10|page=931|pmc=1326409|doi=10.1038/sj.embor.embor951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family life==
Jerne was married three times. He had two sons, Ivar Jerne (born 1936) and Donald Jerne (born 1941), with Tjek Jerne, a painter. Jerne had a third son, Andreas Wettstein, with Gertrud Wettstein, in 1971.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

According to Söderqvist, Tjek, 35, was distraught when she found out that Niels was having an affair with her best friend, Adda Sundsig-Hansen. Tjek had confided in Adda about her own affairs, and Adda had told Neils about them too. Niels demanded a divorce. Tjek begged him to stay. After he refused, she killed herself. Ivar woke up in the morning, smelled gas, and found his mother dead by the oven.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite book|author=Soderqvist, Thomas |title=Science as Autobiography: The Troubled Life of Niels Jern|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iccf-NxXoHoC&amp;pg=PA101|date= 2008|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-12871-0|chapter=Ch. 9, "Letters are a Spiritual Spiderweb in Which you Snare the Dreaming Soul of a Woman"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jerne reportedly treated his second wife like a servant and nanny. He was serially unfaithful to his wives.&lt;ref name="Yewdell"/&gt;

The [[Colorado]]-[[Wyoming]] '''Optimist Brain Bowl''' is a [[quizbowl]] type competition. It is presented by the Colorado-Wyoming [[Optimist International|Optimist Clubs]],  [[Denver Public Schools]], and [[Boulder Valley School District|Boulder Valley Schools]]. It has two separate competitions, the North Region and Central Region competitions. It quizzes [[middle school]] children (6th, 7th, and 8th grades) on a variety of academic topics.  As of 2008, the [[University of Denver]] no longer is a sponsor.

==Competition Structure==

There are three regional competitions: the North, Central, and South Region Tournaments.  They all have the same competition structure, described below.  The top 6 teams from each grade level in each regional competition qualify for the Championship Tournament.  The Championship Tournament has the same structure as the regional competitions.

Teams of 6 students (maximum, though only 5 can compete in any given round) compete. The competition has 4 oral rounds of 30 questions each and a written round in the morning of the competition day. The written round has 50 questions.  The top 8 scoring teams of each grade level move into the elimination rounds in the afternoon. The quarter-final and semi-final rounds are oral rounds, and they are head-to-head single elimination rounds.  Eventually, two teams are escorted onto a stage for the championship round.  The winner of this part of the two-team competition wins the contest for that grade level.

The '''Pennsylvania Department of Education''' is the [[Executive branch|executive department]] of the state charged with publicly funded preschool, [[K-12]] and [[adult education]]al budgeting, management and guidelines. As the [[state education agency]], its activities are directed by the governor appointed [[Pennsylvania]]'s Secretary of Education. The agency is headquartered at 333 Market Street in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.education.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/department_information/7203 Department Information]", ''Pennsylvania Department of Education''. Retrieved on April 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The Pennsylvania Department of Education oversees 500 public school districts [[List of school districts in Pennsylvania|public school districts of Pennsylvania]], over 170ublic charter schools (2014), 14 public cyber charter schools, Career and Technology Centers/Vocational Technical schools, 29 public [[Intermediate Unit]]s, the education of youth in State Juvenile Correctional Institutions, Head Starts and publicly funded preschools in the Commonwealth (PreK Counts Keystone Stars) and 22 community colleges. In 2014, the Pennsylvania Department of Education employs approximately 600 persons.&lt;ref&gt;Pennsylvania Department of Education, Employment Opportunities, March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The agency maintains a database of all education institutions in the Commonwealth with associated data. EdNA [http://www.education.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/find_an_institution/7205/education_names_and_addresses__(edna_v_2)/509789] These entities include school districts and their schools, intermediate units, area vocational technical schools, charter schools, nonpublic and private schools, higher education institutions and more.

== History ==
Following passage and signing of the Free School Law on April 1, 1834, the Secretary of the Commonwealth acted as head of the Common School System until 1837.  In that year a separate Department of Schools was created with a Superintendent of Common Schools as its chief officer. In 1873, the title was changed to Superintendent of Public Instruction, and greater responsibilities were assigned to that official and to the Department. In 1969, the name of the Department of Public Instruction was changed to the Department of Education, with the title of Superintendent of Public Instruction changed to the Secretary of Education.  It previously ran the [[Pennsylvania State Board of Censors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/about_pde/7203 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |title=About PDE |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current Secretary of Education ==
* [[Pedro Rivera (educator)|Pedro Rivera]], Confirmed June, 2015

== Purpose ==
The mission statement of the Pennsylvania Department of Education is "to assist the [[Pennsylvania General Assembly|General Assembly]], the [[Governor]], the Secretary of Education and Pennsylvania educators in providing for the maintenance and support of a thorough and efficient system of education."  The Department has broad discretionary powers in both the development and administration of educational policies which enhance the educational experience and quality in Pennsylvania.  The Department also works as an ongoing study of the educational process within the state, conducting studies and programs designed to evaluate specific needs or qualities of the system.  In doing so, the Pennsylvania Department of Education will recommend changes and improvements to the Governor, the Board of Education, and the General Assembly.

The Pennsylvania Department of Education also oversees policies of public libraries, academic libraries, and the [[State Library of Pennsylvania]] located in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]].  It provides policy of equal opportunity in the educational system, with special regard to nonpublic education and state policy of education.  It is within the Pennsylvania Department of Education's mission to collaborate with other state educational departments in an effort to create a cohesive and dynamic learning environment.

'''''The Periodic Table of Videos''''' (usually shortened to '''''Periodic Videos''''') is a series of videos about [[chemical elements]] and the [[periodic table]]. They are published on [[YouTube]] and produced by [[Brady Haran]], a former [[BBC]] video journalist, featuring Sir [[Martyn Poliakoff]] ("The Professor"), Peter Licence, [[Stephen Liddle]], Debbie Kays, Neil Barnes, Sam Tang and others at the [[University of Nottingham]].&lt;ref name="arstechnica"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/science/news/2008/07/periodic-table-brought-to-life.ars |title=Periodic Table brought to life |author=Jonathan M. Gitlin |date=July 16, 2008|publisher=[[Ars Technica]] |accessdate=17 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The project began recording on 9 June 2008 and the initial videos were completed on 17 July 2008.&lt;ref name="professor1" /&gt; The collection includes videos, each just a few minutes long, for all 118 known elements with a video for each element, as well as many additional supplemental chemistry videos. The 118 element videos and introduction videos were all shot unscripted in June and July 2008.&lt;ref name="acs08" /&gt;

Since the initial videos were completed in 2008 the team has been refining and uploading revised versions of the videos with new video and in higher resolutions.&lt;ref name="acs08" /&gt; A key example of this revising is with the [[xenon]] video that was redone in honour of professor [[Neil Bartlett (chemist)|Neil Bartlett]] who died on 5 August 2008;&lt;ref name="acs08" /&gt; Bartlett prepared one of the first xenon compounds, [[xenon hexafluoroplatinate]].&lt;ref name="acs08" /&gt;

==Content==
Poliakoff is the most visible presenter on the videos and his hair, reminiscent of [[Einstein]] or a [[mad scientist]], is frequently commented upon in the videos.&lt;ref name="acs08"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=[http://pubs.acs.org/cen/staff/biosr.html Ritter, Stephen]|title = Elements Achieve Internet Stardom|journal = [[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]]|volume = 86|issue = 37|pages = 42–43|publisher = [[American Chemical Society]]|date = September 15, 2008|url = http://pubs.acs.org/cen/education/86/8637education.html|accessdate = July 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of the professor's hair and amusing experiments has made these videos quite popular.&lt;ref name="acs08"/&gt; Although uncertain what to think about the attention given to his hair, Professor Poliakoff is excited with the success of the videos, stating "With a few hours of work, I have lectured to more students than I have reached in my entire career."&lt;ref name="acs08"/&gt; The YouTube channel as of December 2017, has over 1 million subscribers and the videos have surpassed 170 million views.&lt;ref name="professor1"&gt;{{Cite video|people = Brady Haran (producer)|title = The Professor talks about The Periodic Table of Videos|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yT8kvHlgeg|publisher = The Periodic Table of Videos|location = Nottingham, UK|date = 31 May 2010|accessdate  = 17 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="YouTube"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/periodicvideos |title=Periodic Table of Videos Channel |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=17 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The YouTube channel is now one of the most popular chemistry related channels on all of YouTube.&lt;ref name="EPSRCvideo"/&gt; The producers of the videos have received praise from Nobel Laureates, chemistry professors, and the general public, says Professor Poliakoff.&lt;ref name="acs08"/&gt; Chemistry Nobel Laureate [[Roald Hoffmann]] has even offered his praise of the videos, stating they "are like the best reality show I've ever seen – the universe revealing itself, element by element."&lt;ref name="acs08"/&gt;

The videos feature various experiments and demonstrations of the elements, some too dangerous to be performed in a classroom.&lt;ref name="acs08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sci/tech/7507986.stm |title=Elements brought to life online |author=Staff |date=15 July 2008 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=17 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the presenters take appropriate precautions when doing such experiments and provide adequate warnings, some scientists have criticized the dangerous experiments fearing people might try them at home and get hurt.&lt;ref name="acs08"/&gt; The intent of the videos is to bring chemistry to a new generation of students and to get them enthused about science and understand how chemists think and what chemists are trying to do.&lt;ref name="cbs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/3347317/YouTube-periodic-table-Explosive-video-guides.html |title=YouTube periodic table: Explosive video guides |author=Matthew Moore |date=15 Jul 2008 |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=17 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many school teachers now incorporate these videos into their classes,&lt;ref name="professor1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cbs"&gt;{{cite video|date = 20 December 2009|title = Web Wizard|url = http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=6002511n|publisher = [[CBS News]]|accessdate = 17 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the professor has even recorded video responses to some of the students' questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video|people = Brady Haran (producer)|title = Questions for The Professor – ''Periodic Table of Videos''|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F_ztEv_v1Y|publisher = The Periodic Table of Videos|location = Nottingham, UK|date = 3 August 2009|accessdate = 7 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most popular videos are those of [[sodium]],&lt;ref name="telegraph1"/&gt; [[potassium]], and [[uranium]].

''The Periodic Table of Videos'' team has had two live performances to date, the first in May 2009 at the [[Broadway Media Centre]] in [[Nottingham]], and most recently in July 2010 at the [[EuroScience]] Open Forum (ESOF) in [[Turin]], Italy.&lt;ref name="professor1"/&gt;

==Financing==
A grant from the [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]] of £25,249 was awarded on 19 January, 2010 to extend the video library to include topical videos on molecules of general interest.&lt;ref name="EPSRCvideo"&gt;{{cite video|date = June 4, 2010|title = It's elementary, my dear Poliakoff!|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EmN6XpbIBI|publisher = [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]]|accessdate = 17 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grant"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/ViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/H027424/1 |title=''The Periodic Table of Videos'': MolVids Grant |publisher=[[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]] |accessdate=July 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these new videos were on [[carbon dioxide]] and [[methane]].&lt;ref name="EPSRCvideo"/&gt;

==Videos==
''The Periodic Table of Videos'' has filmed at least one video for each of the 118 elements (from [[hydrogen]] to [[oganesson]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.periodicvideos.com/ Read below the periodic table] "Tables charting the chemical elements have been around since the 19th century – but this modern version has a short video about each one.
We've done all 118 – but our job's not finished. Now we're updating all the videos with new stories, better samples and bigger experiments.

Plus we're making films about other areas of chemistry, latest news and occasional adventures away from the lab.

We've also started a new series – The Molecular Videos – featuring our favourite molecules and compounds.

All these videos are created by video journalist Brady Haran, featuring real working chemists from the University of Nottingham."&lt;/ref&gt; They have also filmed several videos that discuss molecules such as D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ([[heavy water]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.periodicvideos.com/videos/mv_heavywater.htm Heavy water video]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sulfuric acid]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.periodicvideos.com/videos/mv_sulfuric_acid.htm Sulfuric acid video]&lt;/ref&gt; Also filmed are "Chem definitions" that provide an explanation to words that are used in chemistry. Lastly, the team has filmed "Roadtrips" where they travel to different places in the world that have an importance in chemistry (such as the mine outside [[Ytterby]], [[Sweden]], which had four elements&amp;nbsp;– [[yttrium]], [[terbium]], [[erbium]], and [[ytterbium]]&amp;nbsp;– named after it.)

'''Ruth Isabel Seabury''', was born  on June 2, 1892, in [[Bangor, Maine|Bangor]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Maine]].  She is the eldest of five siblings born to George Edwin Seabury, an executive with Boston Edison Power, and Emma Agusta Hodgdon.

==Biography==
Seabury graduated from [[Smith College]] in 1914 and after two years teaching she was elected Young People's Secretary of the Congregational Woman's Board of Missions.  Ten years later she became Educational Secretary of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, a position she held for many years. She was a delegate to the meeting of the [[International Missionary Council]] in Madras, India, in 1938. In 1940 she received an honorary Litt.D. degree from Elon College, North Carolina. She was involved in many [[missionary]] efforts and by the time she wrote ''[[Daughter of Africa]]'' her account of the work of South Africa's [[Mina Soga]] in 1945, she had visited twenty-three different countries.

In 1947 Seabury became the educational advisor for [[Doshisha University]] in Kyoto, Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doshisha.ac.jp/english/information/overview/chronology.php Doshisha University Chronology] Doshisha University Website. Retrieved April 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; She served for many years as an adviser to the [[Danforth Foundation]] which designed and implemented programs for the enhancement of religion on college campuses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://record.wustl.edu/news/page/normal/7659.html ''Danforth Foundation has funded countless education opportunities''.] The WUISL ''Record''. September 8, 2006.  Retrieved April 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959 construction of the Seabury Memorial Chapel was completed at [[International Christian University]] in Tokyo, Japan. The chapel was named in honor of her contributions to the founding of the university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icu.ac.jp/abouticu_e/facilities.html Facilities and Campus Map] International Christian University website. Retrieved April 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; She was called "an internationalist by instinct" and was widely known within America and overseas as a speaker on interracial brotherhood and international fellowship, causes to which she dedicated her life. She never married and died at the age of 63 in [[Muskegon, Michigan]].

In addition to authoring or co-authoring various pamphlets and speeches, Seabury wrote Our ''Japanese Friends'' (1927), ''Dinabandhu: A Background Book on India'' (1938), and ''What Kind of a World Do You Want?'' which were published by the Friendship Press, ''Flight to Destiny!'' (1945) published by the Association Press, and ''Daughter of Africa'' (1945) published by the Pilgrim Press.

The '''Secondary Education Examination''', abbreviated  '''SEE''', is the final examination in the secondary school system of Nepal. [[National Examination Board]] upgraded from what was previously known as [[School Leaving Certificate (Nepal)|School Leaving Certificate (Nepal) or SLC]].&lt;ref&gt;https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/secondary-education-exams-begin-today/&lt;/ref&gt; Every student must take this examination for completing the 10th grade of their study (According to new Education Act) before they join higher secondary or intermediate level education (12th grade). The SEE examination is said to be scheduled in March of every year. The government has a great determination that the new grading system that has been recently implemented in the SLC examination will help the country to increase the literacy rate. As the new Education Act, 2016 (2073) has been implemented, the SLC examination will be taken place in Grade 10 as national level examination whereas the examination of Grade 10 will be known as Secondary Education Examination (S.E.E)..&lt;ref&gt;http://seeresultnepal.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.doe.gov.np/assets/uploads/files/0328fd46cc0b600d6f66609439fd0f09.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This new Education Act was implemented from 2017 March with 538,000 students taking it.&lt;ref&gt;https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/538000-students-take-secondary-education-examinations/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14151">The '''Soka School System''' (Japanese: 創価学園 Hepburn: Sōka Gakuen) is a Japanese corporate body that oversees a series of kindergartens, elementary schools, junior high schools, and high schools in Japan and several other countries as well as an educational support and research facility.  It is part of a wider network of "Soka" schools which includes [[Sōka University|Soka University of Japan]], [[Soka University of America]], and Soka Women’s College.&lt;ref&gt;Storch, Tanya (2015). Buddhist-Based Universities in the United States: Searching for a New Model in Higher Education. pages 63-80. Lexington Books. {{ISBN|9780739184097}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, it has a supportive relationship with several non-affiliated schools and research associations in countries outside of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Inukai, Nozomi (2016). ''Ikeda Research in China and Taiwan: Critical Analysis of The Chinese Language Literature'' (2016), pp. 60-79. In Goulah, Jason. ''Daisaku Ikeda, Language and Education''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dobbelaere, Karen. Soka Gakkai: From Lay Movement to Religion. Torino, pp. 60-65. Italy: Signature Books (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

In order of their openings, the network includes Soka Junior and Senior High Schools (1968; Tokyo), Soka University (1971; Tokyo), Kansai Soka Junior and Senior High Schools (1973; Osaka), Sapporo Soka Kindergarten (1976), Tokyo Soka Elementary School (1978), Kansai Soka Elementary School (1982; Osaka), Soka Women’s College (1985; Tokyo), Soka University of America (1987, 2001), Hong Kong Soka Kindergarten (1992), Singapore Soka Kindergarten (1993), Malaysia Soka Kindergarten (1995), Brazil Soka (elementary and middle) School (2001), Brazil Soka Kindergarten (2001), and Soka Happiness Kindergarten of South Korea (2008).  Also, one of Japan’s largest correspondence education programs is administered by Soka University in Tokyo.&lt;ref&gt;Goulah, Jason (2016). ''Daisaku Ikeda, Language and Education'', pp. 14, 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

The underlying educational philosophy and curriculum perspectives of the Soka School System has influenced the work of many educators in Japan and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Gebert, Andrew &amp; Joffee, Monte (2007). ''Value creation as the aim of education: Tsunesaburo Makiguchi and Soka education'', pp. 65-88. In David T. Hansen (Ed.), ''Ethical visions of education: Philosophies in practice'' Teachers College Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, George D. (2002).

Daisaku Ikeda, ''Language and Education'', p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

The founder of the Soka School System is [[Daisaku Ikeda]]. The Soka School System receives financial support from the [[Soka Gakkai|Soka Gakkai Buddhist society]]. The majority of students enrolled are members of the Soka Gakkai although no priority is given to members in admissions decisions. Its educational program is non-sectarian despite the Soka Gakkai’s relationship to [[Nichiren Buddhism]]. Its buildings and campuses have been noted as architecturally supportive of the schools’ stated philosophy, designed to be bright and expansive with scenic views.&lt;ref&gt;White, James William (1970). ''The Sokagakkai and Mass Society'', pp. 103-104. Stanford University Press. {{ISBN|9780804707282}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gross, Carl H. (1970). ''Soka Gakkai and Education''.

In Cherry, Stephen M. &amp; Ebaugh, Helen R. (eds). ''Global Religious Movements Across Borders: Sacred Service''. Routledge. {{ISBN|9781317127338}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Educational philosophy, curriculum, and methodology ==
The Soka School System’s educational philosophy, labeled “Soka education” or “value-creative education,” sets the goal of education as the realization of students' happiness.  Realizing this vision on a broader scale, according to Ikeda, requires a paradigmatic shift from education being seen as supporting society to a vision of society serving the essential needs of education.&lt;ref&gt;Nieto, Sonia (2016). ''Media Review of Daisaku Ikeda’s.'' Soka Education: For the Happiness of the Individual ''(Rev. ed.). Middleway Press: Santa Monica, CA {{ISBN|978-0-9779245-5-4}}, in Goulah, Jason (2016).'' Daisaku Ikeda, Language and Education'', pp. 152-153. Routledge.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission of schools, according to Soka education, should be to protect the dignity of human life and human rights. Its methodology is based on “human education” rather than the more popularly used term “humanistic education.”  Here, the teacher serves as a role model of pacifism, assuming the Buddhist function of a [[bodhisattva]].  The teacher’s role is to help students realize the inner dignity of their lives, nurture the will to live more strongly, and empathize with the pain of others.  The curriculum has a strong focus on peace, human rights, sustainable development, and environmental education.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Goulah (2011). ''Environmental Displacement, English Learners, and Value Creation: Considering Daisaku Ikeda in the East-West Ecology of Education” in Jing Lin and Rebecca L. Oxford (eds).'' Transformative Eco-Education for Human and Planetary Survival:Transforming Education for the Future'', p. 54. IAP. {{ISBN|9781617355042}}.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joffee, Monte (2006).

== History ==
The roots of the Soka School System is traced to the pedagogical work of [[Tsunesaburo Makiguchi]], a Japanese educator and geographer in the early 20th century whose first published works were books about geography and community studies education.  He further developed his theories in praxis as a principal of five elementary schools in Tokyo.  Makiguchi’s final book, ‘’The System of Value-Creating Pedagogy’’ (Jpn: Soka kyoikugaku taikei), was published in 1930. Here Makiguchi wrote about happiness, defined as the ability to create personal and social value, as the goal of both life and education.  [[Josei Toda]], Makiguchi’s colleague and disciple, experimented with Makiguchi's theories in an afterschool tutoring center he operated and also edited Makiguchi’s comments and notes into publishable form.&lt;ref&gt;Heffron, John M.

== Research ==
One of the first western scholars to research Soka education and its applications was Dayle M. Bethel who wrote a biography of Makiguchi and who edited and translated his “Geography of Human Life” and “Value-Creating Education.”&lt;ref&gt;Bethel, Dayle M. ''Makiguchi, the value creator: Revolutionary Japanese educator and founder of Soka Gakkai'' (1973). Weatherhill. {{ISBN|9780834800779}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bethel, Dayle M. (ed) ''A Geography of Human Life'' (2002). Caddo Gap Press. {{ISBN|9781880192429}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bethel, Dayle M. (Ed.), ''Education for creative living: Ideas and proposals of Tsunesaburo Makiguchi'' (1989). Ames, Iowa: State University Press: Ames, Iowa. {{ISBN|0813803918}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by Carl H. Gross’ anecdotal report on his visit to the newly formed Soka High School in Tokyo.&lt;ref&gt;Gross, Carl H.  Soka Gakkai and Education. East Lansing, MI: Michigan State University Press, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

Qualitative research has emerged in the form of books, articles, and dissertations.  Considerable textual analysis of the Ikeda corpus is taking place at the Institute for Daisaku Ikeda Studies at [[DePaul University|DePaul University’s]] College of Education.  The Soka Education Research Initiative on Global Citizenship (SERI-GC) is a five-year research project launching at the University of Guelph-Humber in Canada the promotes study of the philosophy and practices of Soka education and its connection to global citizenship which is funded by the Japan-based Makiguchi Foundation for Education.  An annual student-led conference about applications of Soka education takes place annually at Soka University of America.&lt;ref&gt;Ikeda Center for Peace, Dialogue, and Learning,http://ikedacenter.org/about/education-fellows/bibliography.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;University of Guelph-Humber Soka Education Research Initiative launches at UofGH,https://www.guelphhumber.ca/news/soka-education-research-initiative-launches-uofgh&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Soka University of America, Soka Education Student Research Project,http://www.soka.edu/student_life/student-activities/soka-education-student-research-project/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, Namrata ''Value-Creating Global Citizenship Education: Engaging Gandhi, Makiguchi, and Ikeda as Examples'' (2018).

==Establishment==
Stuart Robinson School was established in 1913 by Rev. Dr. Edward O. Guerrant. A physician and evangelist, Guerrant was the founder of several schools and churches in [[eastern Kentucky]].&lt;ref name=UNCA/&gt; Guerrant is said to have been inspired to start a [[Christian mission|mission]] in Blackey after he encountered some boys swimming in the nearby river on a Sunday morning in 1910 and discovered that most of the boys had never heard of [[Sunday school]], much less attended one.&lt;ref name=UNCA/&gt; The school was named for Rev. [[Stuart Robinson (pastor)|Stuart Robinson]], who had been a pastor of [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]]{{'s}} Second Presbyterian Church. Robinson was known for both his leadership role among [[Border states (American Civil War)|border state]] Presbyterians during and after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and his interest in mission work in the mountains of eastern Kentucky.&lt;ref name=UNCA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/A_kingdom_not_of_this_world.html?id=wbhVxLWpySMC |title=A kingdom not of this world: Stuart Robinson's struggle to distinguish the sacred from the secular during the Civil War |author=Preston D. Graham |isbn=978-0-86554-757-5 |date=2002 |publisher=Mercer University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; The school had 140 students when it opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://appalshop.org/cbcaudill/blackey.htm|title=Blackey|publisher=Appalshop|accessdate=January 8, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223235423/http://appalshop.org/cbcaudill/blackey.htm|archivedate=February 23, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus and facilities==
The school was located on a {{convert|16|acre|adj=on}} campus served by the Rockhouse Branch of the [[Louisville and Nashville Railroad|L&amp;N Railroad]] and by [[Kentucky Route 15]].&lt;ref name=UNCA/&gt;  It also maintained a large [[farm]] to produce food for the school. School and farm buildings included dormitories and a dining hall, educational buildings, a library, a [[gym]]nasium, houses for teachers, and a dairy barn, [[silo]], and milk house with equipment for [[pasteurization]] and refrigeration.&lt;ref name=UNCA/&gt;  By its final years, the campus expanded from 16 to {{convert|66|acre}}.&lt;ref name=Midd1961&gt;{{citation |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wIJDAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NqsMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4442,1515270&amp;dq=stuart-robinson-school&amp;hl=en |title=Site Offered for School |date=February 7, 1961 |newspaper=Middlesboro Daily News |location=Middlesboro, Kentucky}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==School program==
Stuart Robinson School was [[coeducation]]al and operated as a [[day school|day]] and [[boarding school]] with twelve grades. Most students were enrolled in a work-study program, which the school called its "Work Scholarship plan", through which students could earn all or part of the cost of their education and board. Boys typically did farm and gardening work, installed fencing, fired the school's furnaces, worked at carpentry, or maintained plumbing and electrical wiring. Girls did cooking and housekeeping work in the school's kitchen, dining room and dormitories.&lt;ref name=UNCA/&gt;

The school fielded interscholastic teams in [[American football|football]] and [[basketball]]. Extracurricular activities included a [[glee club]], a [[home economics]] club, and literary societies.&lt;ref name=UNCA/&gt;

Throughout its history, the school operated as a Presbyterian mission. In 1935 it was described as the Presbyterian church's largest school.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=x7ceAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=T2QEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3785,4248194&amp;dq=stuart-robinson-school&amp;hl=en |title=Presbyterians to Hear Two Noted Speakers Sunday |newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |date=February 22, 1935 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Closure==
The school closed after Letcher County built [[state school|public school]]s in the nearby community of [[Letcher, Kentucky|Letcher]].&lt;ref name=Midd1961/&gt; It graduated its last class in 1956 and closed in 1957, after which time the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States|Southern Presbyterian Church]] sold the property.&lt;ref name=UNCA/&gt;&lt;ref name=CalvaryHistory&gt;{{citation |url=http://calvarycampus.org/aboutus/history |title=History |publisher=Calvary Campus |accessdate=January 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school property is now used as Calvary Campus, a Christian camp, education facility, and retreat center.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://calvarycampus.org/aboutus |title=About Us |publisher=Calvary Campus |accessdate=January 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alumni==
A [[school fundraising]] pamphlet stated that more than half of Stuart Robinson's graduates went on to college, and that many later returned to mountain communities in eastern Kentucky "to teach school to their lesser-enlightened neighbors" and sometimes "organized Sunday Schools where they have never before existed."&lt;ref name=UNCA/&gt;  Notable alumni of the Stuart Robinson School include  [[Juanita Kreps]], [[U.S. Secretary of Commerce]] under President Jimmy Carter, and [[Gurney Norman]], author and university professor whose novel ''[[Divine Right's Trip]]'' was published in serial form in the ''[[Whole Earth Catalog]]''.&lt;ref name=UNCA/&gt;

The '''Swanwick Writers' Summer School''' is an annual writers' conference held at The [[Hayes Conference Centre]], near Swanwick, Derbyshire. Founded in 1948, and first held in the summer of 1949, it is believed to be the oldest independent writers' school in the world. Established as a charity and run on a not for profit basis, it was inspired by the London Writers Circle. Early celebrities that featured at the School  included, [[Vera Brittain]], [[L.P. Hartley]], [[Hammond Innes]] and [[Arthur C. Clarke]]&lt;ref name="Hilliard"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hilliard|first=Christopher|title=To Exercise Our Talents: The Democratization of Writing in Britain|date=30 June 2009|publisher=Harvard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allan|first=Victor|title=The Fellowship of Swanwick|date=October 1949|publisher=Writer Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first chairman was [[Cecil Hunt]], a chairman of the London Writers' Circle. Early delegates included the booker prize nominee, [[Barbara Pym]], one of whose novels, ''No Fond Return of Love'', is inspired, in part, by Swanwick itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pym|first=Barbara|title=No Fond Return of Love|date=2002|publisher=Moyer Bell|location=Wickford}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cocking|first=Yvonne|title=A Thankless Task?|journal=Paper to The Barbara Pym North American Conference|date=19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Associated with the school for over fifteen years as member, host and lecturer was Booker Prize Winner [[Paul Scott (novelist)|Paul Scott]]. He refers to the role Swanwick plays  in creative writing in his published essays.&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Paul|title=My appointment with the muse|date=1986|publisher=Heinemann|isbn=0434626007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Paul|title=On writing and the novel - essays|date=1987|publisher=Morrow|isbn=0688069096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years Swanwick has played an important role in the social development of creative writing.&lt;ref name="Wandor"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wandor|first=Micheline|title=The Author Is Not Dead, Merely Somewhere Else: Creative Writing After Theory,|date=2008|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Basingstoke}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Nancy|title=Venture of Faith - A History of Swanwick|date=1983|publisher=H.E. Walter Ltd|location=Worthing|isbn=0 85479 066 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The School ==

Established postwar, it formed part of the continuing process of democratization of writing begun by many amateur groups in the 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref name="Hilliard"/&gt; From its founding in 1948, the aim of the school has been to provide a social and educational framework for the development of creative writing skills.&lt;ref name="Wandor"/&gt; Its role in the establishment of creative writing in the UK has meant that it has been a platform for eminent speakers, from [[Hammond Innes]] in 1952 to Sir [[Terry Pratchett]].&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt; It has also been closely associated with the development of women's writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kent|first=Sylvia|title=The Woman Writer: The History of the Society of Women Writers and Journalists|date=2009|publisher=The History Press|location=Stroud}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members range from seasoned authors with numerous published books to those new to writing. The inclusive community is designed to enable the sharing of experiences, best practice and support for individual writers' creative writing.

[[Derbyshire Record Office]] houses the school's historical records, reflecting its importance in the development of creative writing in the UK. These archives (ref: D5886) include the school minutes; comment books and correspondence.

== Authors ==

Noted authors who have been members of the school over the years include [[Eleanor Hibbert|Eleanor Burford]], [[John Boland (author)|John Boland]], [[Barbara Pym]], [[Vivian Stuart]], [[Paul Scott (novelist)|Paul Scott]], [[Nina Bawden]], [[Carla Lane]] and [[Margaret Drabble]].&lt;ref name="Scott"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt;

== Topwrite ==

In 2005, the School obtained a grant from [[Big Lottery Fund|Awards for All]] to launch the TopWrite project to support young writers and help close the gaps between the commercial, literary and academic writing worlds.

'''Synchronous conferencing''' is the formal term used in [[computing]], in particular in [[computer-mediated communication]], [[Computer-supported collaboration|collaboration]] and [[Web-based training|learning]], to describe technologies informally known as [[online chat]]. It is sometimes extended to include [[video conferencing|audio/video conferencing]] or [[instant messaging]] systems that provide a [[text-based]] [[multi-user]] chat function. The word ''synchronous'' is used to qualify the conferencing as [[Real-time communications|real-time]], as distinct from a system such as [[e-mail]], where messages are left and answered later.

Synchronous conferencing protocols include:

* [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] (Internet Relay Chat)
* [[Protocol for Synchronous Conferencing|PSYC]] (Protocol for Synchronous Conferencing)
* [[SILC (protocol)|SILC]] (Secure Internet Live Conferencing protocol)
* [[Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol|XMPP]] (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol)
* [[SIMPLE (instant messaging protocol)]] (Session Initiation Protocol for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions)

== Types ==
According to the type of media used, synchronous conferencing can be divided into&lt;ref name="ref 01"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grant|first1=Michael M|last2=Cheon|first2=Jongpil|title=The Value of Using Synchronous Conferencing for Instruction and Students|journal=Journal of Interactive Online Learning|url=http://anitacrawley.net/Articles/Grant%202007%20value%20and%20effectiveness%20of%20wc.pdf|accessdate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''audio conferencing:''' only audio is used 
* '''video conferencing:''' Both audio (voice) and video and picture are used. 

According to the number of access point used, synchronous conferencing can be divided into 
* '''point-to-point:''' Only two computers are connected end to end.
* '''multi-point:''' Two or more than two computers are connected together.

== Synchronous vs asynchronous conferencing ==
Both synchronous and [[asynchronous conferencing]] are [[online conferencing]] where the participants can interact while being physically located at different places in the world. Asynchronous conferencing allows the students to access the learning material at their convenience while synchronous conferencing requires that all participants including the instructor and the students be online at the time of conference. &lt;ref name="ref 01"/&gt;

While synchronous conferencing enables real time interaction of the participants, asynchronous conferencing allows participants to post messages and others can respond to it at any convenient time. Sometimes a combination of both synchronous and asynchronous conferencing is used. Both the methods give a permanent record of the conference. &lt;ref name="Ref 02"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is online conferencing?|url=http://www.online-conference.net/what.htm|website=Online Conferencing|accessdate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==
Some of the methods used in synchronous conferencing are:
* '''Chat (text only)''': Multiple participants can be logged into the conference and can interactively share resources and ideas. There is also option to save the chat and archive it for later review. 
* '''Voice (telephone or voice-over IP)''': This is a conference call between the instructor and the participating students where they can speak through built-in microphone or a headset. 
* '''[[Video conferencing]]''': This may or may not require the participants to have their webcams running. Usually, a video conference involves a live feed from a classroom or elsewhere or a content.
* '''[[Web conferencing]]''': This includes Webinar (Web-based seminar) as well. Unlike in video conferencing, participants of a web conferencing can access a wider variety of media elements. Web conferences are comparatively more interactive and usually incorporate chat sessions as well.
* '''[[Internet radio]]/[[podcasts]]''': The instructors makes the audio file available in the Internet which is archived and the students subscribed to the podcast can download it.
* '''[[Virtual worlds]]''': In this set up, students can meet in virtual world and speak with each other through headsets and VoIP. 	This can make the learning more productive and engaging when the students are able to navigate the worlds and operate in their avatar.

== Critical factors for effective implementation ==

There are four critical factors identified for implementing synchronous conferencing for effective instruction to the students&lt;ref name="ref 01"/&gt;
* Video and audio quality which depends on technical factors like higher bandwidth and processing capabilities of the system.
* Training time which depends on the familiarity and proficiency of the instructors and the students with the technology.
* Teaching strategies which depends on the adaptability of the instructors with the new methods, preparing appropriate and effective training materials and motivating students.
* Direct meeting of the instructor and the students.

== Synchronous conferencing in higher education ==
Synchronous conferencing in education helps in the delivery of content through digital media. Since this is a real-time teaching, it also brings the benefits of face-to-face teaching in distance learning. Many higher education institutions offer well-designed quality e-learning opportunities. 
Some of the advantages of synchronous conferencing in education are: &lt;ref name="Ref 04"/&gt; &lt;ref name="Ref 07"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ferriter|first1=Bill|title=Using videoconferencing to connect your class to the world|url=http://www.learnnc.org/lp/pages/6559|website=Learn NC|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Helps the students to connect with not only their own teachers and peers but also with recognized experts in the field regardless of the geographical distance and different time zones. 
* Provides opportunities to both the teachers and the students to expand their knowledge outside the classrooms. 
* Helps students who are home-bound or limited mobility to connect with their classrooms and participate in learning.
* Helps the faculties to conduct classes when they are not able to come to classes due to an emergency.
* Supports real-time collaboration, interaction and immediate feedback
* Encourage students to learn together and in turn develop cultural understanding
* Personalized learning experience for the students
* Real-time discussion opportunities for students promoting student engagement
* Active interaction can lead to an associated community of like-minded students
* Saves travel expenses and time

== Implementation of educational technology ==
The tools for implementing synchronous conferencing depends on the type of educational problem addressed. This is in turn decides the method of synchronous conferencing to be used and the tool to be used in the learning context. The tool selected addresses the problem of improving the learning outcomes which cannot be solved with an asynchronous environment. There are many tools and platforms available for synchronous conferencing.&lt;ref name="Ref 04"/&gt;
* Smartphone applications
* Web conferencing tools
* Video conferencing tools
* Video and hangout platforms
* Shared whiteboards
The selection of tools and platforms also depend on the group size which depends on the activity for the course design.

== Effective teaching strategies ==
To make synchronous conferencing effective and engaging, appropriate teaching strategies are important and plays a very important role in making the learning successful. Some of these are &lt;ref name="Ref 06"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crews|first1=Tena B.|last2=Wilkinson|first2=Kelly|last3=Neill|first3=Jason K.|title=Principles for Good Practice in Undergraduate Education: Effective Online Course Design to Assist Students’ Success|journal=MERLOT Journal of Online Learning and Teaching|date=March 2015|volume=11|issue=1|url=http://jolt.merlot.org/vol11no1/Crews_0315.pdf|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Design and development of appropriate online learning environment
* Constructing effective instructional strategies
* Ensure student engagement during learning
* Effective communication with the students.
* Encouraging active learning among the students by relating learning with past experiences
* Flexibility in teaching methods
* Provide continuous and prompt feedback for assessing and improvement
* Develop a sense of community and cooperation among the learners
* Include planned open-ended and critical thought provoking questions to the students to support knowledge construction.
* Provide very rich learning experience by optimising the conferencing software resources.
* Provide clear guidelines for the participating students.
* Moderate the conference through advance planning and preparation. 
* Emphasizing and adhering to time allotted

== Limitations ==
Some limitations for synchronous conferencing in learning are:&lt;ref name="Ref 04"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ozden|first1=Sule|title=Student Perceptions of Web-conferencing in Hybrid Classes|url=http://udel.edu/~shule/new/ActionResearchPaper.pdf|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Ref 05"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=Lynn|last2=Fyvie|first2=Barb|last3=Koritko|first3=Brenda|title=Best practices in synchronous conferencing moderation|journal=The International Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning|date=June 2006|volume=7|issue=1|url=http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/308/483|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Disjointed discussions, not connected in time

'''''The Woodwright's Shop''''' is a traditional [[woodworking]] show hosted by master carpenter [[Roy Underhill]] on [[PBS]] in the United States. It is one of the longest running "how to" shows on PBS, with thirty-five 13-episode seasons filmed. Since its debut in 1979, the show has aired over 400 episodes. The first two seasons were broadcast only on public [[TV]] in [[North Carolina]]; the season numbering was restarted when the show went national in 1981. It is still filmed at the [[UNC-TV]] (University of North Carolina Center for Public Television) studios in [[Research Triangle Park, NC|Research Triangle Park, North Carolina]].

==Overview==
''The Woodwright's Shop'' teaches the art of traditional woodworking, using hand tools and human-powered machines. Viewers learn how to make furniture, toys, and other useful objects out of wood. Viewers also learn how to lay out wood projects and which tools to use for specific purposes. The show also teaches how to use tools properly.

The host, Roy Underhill, instructs viewers on creating wooden joints using hand tools and machine tools.

===Wood joints===
Underhill often shows the viewers how to create several useful and strong [[Woodworking joints|wooden joints]], which are commonly used in carpentry.
* [[Mortise and tenon]]: This joint is often used for two pieces of wood that attach at right angles to each other in a "T" shape.
* [[Tongue and groove]]: Tongue and groove joints are typically used for large surfaces such as a series of wooden panels on a wall or a table top.
* [[Dovetail joint]]: This joint is typically used for the corners of boxes.
* [[Rabbet]]: A rabbet joint is one of the simplest joints used on the show.
[[Timber framing]] techniques are often used in conjunction with the wood joints described on the show.

===Hand tools===
[[Image:Carving tools 2.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=Various hand tools for carving wood|Various hand tools for carving wood]]
[[Hand tools]] are a major focus of the show. All of the hand tools used on the show are manually operated (i.e. non-electric).
* [[Chisel]]: The chisel is one of the most commonly used tools on the show and is typically used to shave down material and to square up holes. 
* [[Mallet|Wooden mallet]]: The mallet is often used to drive the chisel into the work piece.
* [[Bow saw]]: The bow saw is often used by Underhill to cut large pieces of wood and to make curved cuts.
* [[Brace and bit]]: Most of the drilling on the show is done with a brace and bit which is a hand powered drill.
* [[Plane (tool)|Plane]]: Underhill uses the plane to level out surfaces and to square up joints.
* [[Hatchet]]: Large pieces of wood are cut down to manageable size with a hatchet.
* [[Drawknife]]: This tool is often used to quickly remove excess material.
* [[Adze]]: The adze is used to hollow out surfaces like a chair seat.
Proper handling and maintenance of tools is also part of the show. This includes sharpening tools and sometimes making tools, such as a [[Card scraper|scraper]] made from an old saw blade.

===Machine tools===
The most commonly used machine tool on the show is the [[lathe]]. Underhill typically uses a treadle lathe, but has also shown the viewers how to build and operate a [[pole lathe|spring pole lathe]]. He also often uses a [[Chisel#Gouge|gouge]], in conjunction with his lathe, to remove material and smooth out a work piece.

One of the simplest types of machines used on the show is a [[miter box]]. This is used to create square and perpendicular saw cuts, or saw cuts at a specific angle.

==Early history==
The show started as an idea that Roy Underhill had in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Phillips |first= Pamela |date= November–December 1985 |title= Have Broadax-Will Time Travel |page= 3 |journal= [[Mother Earth News]] |issn= |oclc=468787279 |url= http://www.motherearthnews.com/Nature-Community/1985-11-01/The-Plowboy-Interview.aspx?page=3 |accessdate= August 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He built a workshop and historic museum in Durham, North Carolina, in the mid-1970s. He called it "The Woodwright's Shop" and started teaching classes on how to build things out of wood.&lt;ref name="subversive-woodworking"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Dresdner |first= Michael |year= 2006 |title= Roy Underhill: A Quarter Century of Subversive Woodworking |journal= Woodworker's Journal |issn= 0199-1892 |oclc= 5699485 |url= http://www.woodworkersjournal.com/roy-underhill-a-quarter-century-of-subversive-woodworking/ |accessdate= August 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Underhill pitched the show idea to the PBS affiliate in Chapel Hill in 1978 but was rejected. He tried again in 1979 and filmed a pilot.&lt;ref name="subversive-woodworking" /&gt; Only in the fall of 1979 was the show accepted. 1979 was the same year that ''[[This Old House]]'' started airing on PBS.&lt;ref name="subversive-woodworking" /&gt; Underhill admits that he made up the term "woodwright" and that it is not an actual term.&lt;ref name="broadax-travel-6"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Phillips |first= Pamela |date=November–December 1985 |title= Have Broadax-Will Time Travel |page= 6 |journal=Mother Earth News |issn= |oclc= 468787279 |url= http://www.motherearthnews.com/Nature-Community/1985-11-01/The-Plowboy-Interview.aspx?page=6 |accessdate= November 15, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, he was concerned about using the made-up term in the show's title, but decided to use it anyway.&lt;ref name="broadax-travel-6" /&gt;

==Production==
The show has a tight filming schedule.&lt;ref name="broadax-travel-4"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Phillips |first= Pamela |date= November–December 1985
 |title=Have Broadax-Will Time Travel |page= 4 |journal= Mother Earth News |issn= |oclc= 468787279 |url= http://www.motherearthnews.com/Nature-Community/1985-11-01/The-Plowboy-Interview.aspx?page=4  |accessdate=August 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The show does not have a real script; instead, Underhill works out the story he is going to present and how to do it. He decides where camera shots are needed and sets work pieces and tools in those locations.&lt;ref name="broadax-travel-4" /&gt; The filming of different shots is limited to three takes because of the limit of work pieces used on the show{{clarify|date=December 2011}}.&lt;ref name="broadax-travel-4" /&gt;

In recent years, the show is filmed in one take with no editing and as a result, the host is often out of breath by the end of the 24 minute program.&lt;ref name="subversive-woodworking" /&gt;

===Injuries===
The show also does not hide the nicks and cuts that come from wood-working with hand tools. The first such incident occurred in the third episode of the series, "Dumbheads in Action".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ket.org/tvschedules/episode.php?nola=WOWS++002013 |title= The Woodwright's Shop #2013: 'Twentieth Anniversary Show' |publisher= [[Kentucky Educational Television]] |date= July 18, 2002 |quote= Roy looks back at 20 years of subversive woodworking, including memorable guests, travel to foreign lands, hundreds of projects, and some of the most amazing hand-tool injuries ever captured on tape. |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120306045750/http://www.ket.org/tvschedules/episode.php?nola=WOWS++002013 |archivedate= March 6, 2012 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''dumbhead'' is a clamping fixture on a foot operated [[shaving horse]] used to hold unseasoned ("green") wood.

On one occasion, Roy seriously injured his hand with a hatchet.&lt;ref name="broadax-travel-4" /&gt; The scene was kept in the show because it was the last take of this particular scene. Underhill reviewed the take and felt it gave the show some realism.&lt;ref name="broadax-travel-5"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Phillips |first= Pamela |date=November–December 1985 |title= Have Broadax-Will Time Travel |page= 5 |journal= Mother Earth News  |issn= |oclc= 468787279  |url=http://www.motherearthnews.com/Nature-Community/1985-11-01/The-Plowboy-Interview.aspx?page=5 |accessdate= August 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Host==
{{main article|Roy Underhill}}
[[Image:Roy Underhill.jpg|thumb|alt=Roy Underhill in his shop|left|Roy Underhill in his shop]]
Roy Underhill is the host and creator of ''The Woodwright's Shop''. He graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a B.F.A. in theater direction.&lt;ref name="subversive-woodworking" /&gt;&lt;ref name="broadax-travel-1"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Phillips |first= Pamela |date= November–December 1985 |title= Have Broadax-Will Time Travel |page= 1 |journal= Mother Earth News  |issn= |oclc= 468787279 |url= http://www.motherearthnews.com/Nature-Community/1985-11-01/The-Plowboy-Interview.aspx |accessdate= August 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Roy went to Duke University for environmental studies in the mid-1970s. For his thesis, he did a live presentation titled "How to start with a tree and an axe and build your house and everything in it."&lt;ref name="subversive-woodworking" /&gt; Somebody told him "You ought to do that on TV", when he was finished with his presentation.&lt;ref name="subversive-woodworking" /&gt;

He went on to work at [[Colonial Williamsburg]] as a carpenter, building houses the way they were built in the 18th century.&lt;ref name="subversive-woodworking" /&gt; During this same time, he also started producing ''The Woodwright's Shop'' television show for PBS.&lt;ref name="broadax-travel-4" /&gt; For 10 years, Underhill was a master housewright for Colonial Williamsburg.&lt;ref name="broadax-travel-1" /&gt; He helped with program development for another five years before he left over a disagreement about the authenticity of slave quarters on the project.&lt;ref name="subversive-woodworking" /&gt;

Roy has written several books on woodworking, most of which have been published by the [[University of North Carolina Press]]. Some of the books include, ''The Woodwright’s Shop: A Practical Guide to Traditional Woodcraft'' ({{ISBN|0-8078-4082-3}}) and ''The Woodwright’s Guide: Working Wood with Wedge and Edge'' ({{ISBN|0-8078-5914-1}}).

Roy lent his woodworking expertise to the 2005 movie, ''[[The New World (2005 film)|The New World]]'', about the founding of the settlement in Jamestown, Virginia, in the 17th century. He also taught actor [[Colin Farrell]] about woodworking for the film and acted as an extra in the movie.&lt;ref name="subversive-woodworking" /&gt;

==Guests==
Roy has had a wide range of woodworking professionals as guests on his show from many different fields of woodworking, Frank Klausz, Nora Hall, Steve Latta, David Calvo, Michael Dunbar, Dan Mack, Don Weber, Wayne Barton and Curtis Buchanan as well as many less well known specialists in the fields of [[tinsmith]]ing, spoon carving, [[cooper (profession)|cooper]]age (barrels, buckets, canteens), [[lutherie]] (stringed instruments), whirligigs, archery, puppetry, basket making, spinning wheels and [[blacksmithing]]. Guests have also included famous people with a woodworking hobby such as Governor [[Mike Easley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.charlotteobserver.com/breaking/story/619499.html |title= Easley's Handmade Table Goes for $3,400 |first= Ryan Teague |last= Beckwith |date= March 24, 2009 |department= Under the Dome |work= [[The News &amp; Observer]] |location= Raleigh, NC  |quote= The two-term Democrat &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Mike Easley]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, who left office earlier this year, had made the simple walnut table on a special episode of 'The Woodwright's Shop' in 2007.}}{{dead link|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roy's wife and children have appeared on various episodes over the show’s over thirty-year span of production.

'''Robert Todd Duncan''' (February 12, 1903 – February 28, 1998) was an [[United States|American]] [[baritone]] opera singer and actor. One of the first African-Americans to sing with a major opera company, Duncan is also noted for appearing as Porgy in the premier production of ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' (1935).

==Biography==
As Robert Todd Duncan, he was born 12 February 1903 in [[Danville, Kentucky]] to John and Lettie (Cooper) Duncan.  They were married in Danville 1901, he being born in Danville, and she born in Frankfort.&lt;ref&gt;James Ross Moore, [http://www.anb.org/articles/18/18-03550.html "Duncan, Todd"], ''American National Biography Online'', January 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; John was a garage owner and Lettie was a music teacher.  He obtained his musical training at [[Butler University]] in [[Indianapolis]] with a B.A. in music followed by an M.A. from [[Columbia University Teachers College]].

===Career===
In 1933, Duncan debuted in [[Pietro Mascagni]]'s ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'' at the Mecca Temple in New York with the Aeolian Opera, a black opera company.

Duncan was [[George Gershwin]]'s personal choice as the first performer of the role of Porgy in ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' in 1935 and played the role more than 1,800 times.  He led the cast during the Washington run of ''Porgy and Bess'' at the [[National Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|National Theatre]] in 1936, to protest the theatre's policy of [[Racial segregation|segregation]]. Duncan stated that he "would never play in a theater which barred him from purchasing tickets to certain seats because of his race." Eventually management would give into the demands and allow for the first integrated performance at National Theatre.&lt;ref name=libcong1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/today/sep02.html |title=Porgy and Bess: Today in History, September 2 |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |accessdate=2007-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Duncan was also the first performer for the role of Stephen Kumalo in [[Kurt Weill]]'s ''[[Lost in the Stars]].''

In 1938, Duncan appeared on the London stage at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] in C.B.Cochran's musical production ''The Sun Never Sets''. The cast included fellow American [[Adelaide Hall]], [[Leslie Banks]], [[Edna Best]] and [[Stewart Granger]]. The musical was adapted by Pat Wallace and Guy Bolton from various stories written by [[Edgar Wallace]]&lt;ref&gt;Spectator review 16 June 1938 (retrieved 19 December 2014): http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/17th-june-1938/16/stage-and-screen&lt;/ref&gt; and the show included original music by [[Cole Porter]]. Costumes were designed by [[Elizabeth Haffenden]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Sun Never Sets'' costume designs are in the Drury Lane Design Collection archive: (retrieved 19 December 2014): by http://archiveshub.ac.uk/data/gb71-thm/86&lt;/ref&gt; One of the numbers Duncan sang was 'River God'. After the London run closed, Duncan and [[Adelaide Hall]] from the original cast toured Britain with the production.&lt;ref&gt;Newspaper article about [[Adelaide Hall]]'s imminent tour of Britain in ''The Sun Never Sets'' (retrieved 19 December 2014: https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2238&amp;dat=19380827&amp;id=DRAmAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ov0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5109,781553&lt;/ref&gt;

Duncan taught voice at [[Howard University]] in Washington, D.C. for more than fifty years.  While teaching at Howard, he continued touring as a soloist with pianists William Duncan Allen and [[George Malloy]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E0D6123AF933A15750C0A96E9C8B63&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=George%20Malloy&amp;st=cse Deaths: Malloy, George,]  ''The New York Times'', March 20, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  He had a very successful career as a concert singer with over 2,000 performances in 56 countries. He retired from Howard and opened his own voice studio teaching privately and giving periodic recitals.

In 1945, he became the first [[African American]] to sing with a major opera company, and the first black person to sing in an opera with an otherwise white cast, when he performed the role of Tonio in [[Ruggero Leoncavallo|Leoncavallo]]'s ''[[Pagliacci]]'' with the [[New York City Opera]].  In the same year he sang the role of Escamillo, the bullfighter, in [[Georges Bizet|Bizet]]'s ''[[Carmen]]''.  In 1955, Duncan was the first to record "[[Unchained Melody]]", a popular song with music by [[Alex North]] and lyrics by [[Hy Zaret]].  The recording was made for the soundtrack of the obscure [[prison]] film ''[[Unchained (film)|Unchained]]'', in which Duncan also played a minor character.  Following Duncan's version, the song went on to become one of the most recorded songs of the 20th century.

In his final interview, Todd Duncan spoke of his love for [[Spiritual (music)|spirituals]]: "... spirituals are so deep inside of me, it's difficult for me to find words that are meaningful.  Spirituals are a part of whatever I am.  When I sing them my being sings them, not my throat.... It is very difficult for me to put into words something that is at the bottom of my very being."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Nash, Elizabeth, ''Autobiographical Reminiscences of African-American Classical Singers, 1853–Present'', Edwin Mellen Press, 2007, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to singing, Duncan was also a [[voice teacher]]. Among his notable pupils was operatic bass [[Philip Booth (bass)|Philip Booth]] who was a mainstay at the Metropolitan Opera for two decades.&lt;ref name="oper"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hosting.operissimo.com/triboni/exec?method=com.operissimo.artist.webDisplay&amp;id=ffcyoieagxaaaaabjkho&amp;xsl=webDisplay&amp;searchStr=|title=Philip Booth|work=[[operissimo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Honors and death===
In 1978, the Washington Performing Arts Society presented his 75th birthday gala.  Duncan was awarded the George Peabody Medal of Music from the [[Peabody Institute|Peabody Conservatory of Music]] of [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1984.  Other awards he received include a medal of honor from [[Haiti]], an [[NAACP]] award, the Donaldson Award, the New York Drama Critics' Award for ''[[Lost in the Stars]]'', and honorary doctorates from [[Valparaiso University]] and Butler University.

Duncan was a member of [[Alpha Phi Alpha]] fraternity.&lt;ref name=soa&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mulambda.org/page.php?parent_id=&amp;page_id=15979 |title=Notable Men of Alpha Phi Alpha |publisher=Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Mu Lambda chapter |accessdate=2007-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023221113/http://www.mulambda.org/page.php?parent_id=&amp;page_id=15979 |archivedate=2007-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
