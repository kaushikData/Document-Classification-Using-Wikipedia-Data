The “Registration of Overseas Supplier of Imported Scrap Materials“ is required for Non-Chinese companies for [[import]]ing [[industrial waste]] and [[Recycling|recycling parts]] into China. The application has to be submitted at the AQSIQ ([[General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine of the People's Republic of China]]; [[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 中华人民共和国国家质量监督检验检疫总局). The registration is mandatory for all Non-Chinese exporters. Aim of this registration is to monitor the import of potential environmental harmful material and ensure that no material is imported into China that are not in compliance with the Chinese environment standards. 
If companies are not registered, parts will be detained in [[customs]] and no import process is possible. In addition to the registration of the [[exporting]] companies, the parts have to be registered with the CCIC (China Certification &amp; Inspection Group; Chinese 中国检验认证集团), and, furthermore, these parts will be accordingly inspected.

'''Alan Priddy''' (born 7 April 1953) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[power boat]] sailor and adventurer who has set several boating world records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-15155271|title=World record bid boat being built in Dudley|date=3 October 2011|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=13 September 2013|location=Birmingham}}&lt;/ref&gt; Priddy attempted to circumnavigate the world in a [[rigid-hulled inflatable boat]] (RIB) in 2002, and in 2008 successfully completed a circumnavigation by yacht. He has also navigated a RIB around Scotland, Ireland, Britain and across the Bay of Biscay. He set a world RIB record in 2003 for crossing the [[Atlantic]] in 103 hours.

As of 2012, Priddy had recorded 37 world records,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.veemoto.ee/veemotost/uim_records_2008_1.htm|title= UIM maailmarekordid veemotos seisuga 1/2008 (Union Internationale Motonautique)|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 12 British national records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rya.org.uk/sitecollectiondocuments/powerboatracing/Web%20Documents/LONG%20DISTANCE%20RECORDS%20BOOK.pdf |title=Royal Yacht Association : Procedure For Long Distance Offshore Endurance World And National Records |accessdate=13 Oct 2013 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Boats he has sailed and raced include Fireballs, Finns, Shearwater Cats, [[Enterprise (dinghy)|Enterprises]], [[Wayfarer (dinghy)|Wayfarer]]s, [[Topper (dinghy)|Topper]]s and yachts.

==Early life==
Priddy was born on a council estate in [[Portsmouth]]. He started sailing at eight-years-old and owned a motorised dinghy at the age of eleven.

==Career==

=== 1990 to 1996 ===
Alan Priddy took part in several record-breaking journeys around Scotland (1990), Britain (1992), Ireland (1993) and in the Bay of Biscay (1996).

=== Atlantic Challenge 1997 ===
[[File:Alan Priddy on "Spirit of Portsmouth" 1997.jpg|thumb|Alan Priddy on ''Spirit of Portsmouth'', 1997]]
On Sunday 22 June 1997, Alan Priddy, Vic Palmer, Jan Falkowski and Steve Lloyd set out to cross the Atlantic in ''Spirit of Portsmouth''—a four-year-old 7.4&amp;nbsp;m (24&amp;nbsp;ft) Ribtec rigid inflatable with a single 165&amp;nbsp;hp Yamaha inboard diesel engine.
The journey took them from Portsmouth, New Hampshire, USA to Portsmouth, Hampshire, UK, stopping on the way in Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, Greenland, Iceland and Northern Ireland. The average leg was more than 500 nautical miles with the longest one planned to be nearly 700 nautical miles and scheduled to take 35 hours non-stop. However, the trip from Iceland to Weymouth took 100 hours with stops for fuel in Barra and Bangor.

=== London-Monaco 1998 ===
In 1998, Priddy and a crew travelled in the RIB ''Spirit of Portsmouth'' from London to Monaco. The 2,100-mile route went down the [[Thames Estuary]], along the length of the Channel to [[Guernsey]], across the [[Bay of Biscay]] to [[Spain]], into the [[Mediterranean]] and past [[Gibraltar]] to [[Monaco]]. The team was backed up by two road crews. They completed the voyage in 99 hours  19 minutes 15seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rib.net/london-monaco/story.htm|title=London to Monaco - the full story!|accessdate=13 Oct 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Royal Yachting Association]] did not ratify the record as they had not been invited to start the race.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

=== Britain 2000 ===
In June 2000, Priddy and his crew circumnavigated the British Isles in five days, six hours and five minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/785531.stm|title=Spirit of Cardiff breaks UK record (BBC News/UK/Wales, 10 June 2000)|accessdate=13 Oct 2013 | date=10 June 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a trial-run of the RIB ''Spirit of Cardiff'' in preparation for a planned circumnavigation of the world.

=== Around the world 2002 ===
Priddy, Clive Tully, Alan Carter and Steve Lloyd attempted to circumnavigate the world in the custom-built RIB ''Spirit of Cardiff'' which was specifically designed for endurance. The route encompassed 21 countries and nearly 25,000 miles and was scheduled for 75 days. At that time, ''Spirit of Cardiff'' was one of the largest RIBs in the world with an overall length of 10&amp;nbsp;metres (33&amp;nbsp;feet). This large size allowed a fully enclosed cabin on board to provide the team with shelter.
They left Cardiff on 31 March 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/1902605.stm Powerboat crew begin record attempt] BBC News web-site, 31 March 2002; extracted 13 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The voyage ran into difficulties &lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/2009361.stm Powerboat record hopes in balance] BBC News web-site, 26 May 2002; extracted 13 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and was prematurely concluded &lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/2059412.stm Spirit boat record aim sinks] BBC News web-site, 22 June 2002; extracted 13 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; when Lloyd suffered heart problems 350 miles from [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] and required a helicopter airlift to Canada.

In September 2002, Priddy planned to return ''Spirit of Cardiff'' across the [[Atlantic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/2258065.stm Powerboat bids for historic record] BBC News web-site, 15 September 2002; extracted 14 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; However, the boat's engine compartment had become flooded and the bilge pumps were ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/2263394.stm Powerboat record sinks on final leg] BBC News web-site, 17 September 2002; extracted 14 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Priddy abandoned the boat in [[Canada]].

=== Soltron Atlantic Challenge ===
In 2003, Priddy attempted to cross from St. John's, Newfoundland to Cape Wrath in Scotland in less than 100 hours. The ''Spirit of '' was refurbished and became ''The Jolly Sailor''. 
At 1342 local, 1512 GMT on 27 July 2003 Priddy, Jan Falkowski, Clive Tully and Canadian Egbert Walters embarked. With a brief fuel stop in [[Nanortalik]] harbour (Greenland) after being battered by 50 knot winds, they headed across the Denmark Strait towards Iceland onto a further fuel stop at the island of [[Heimaey]], past [[Cape Wrath]] (Scotland) on to [[Bangor, County Down|Bangor]] (Northern Ireland). Priddy beat his previous time but did not set a world record, but it was the fastest transatlantic crossing by a RIB. After an overnight stop, they continued down the Irish Sea and returned to Portsmouth on 9 September.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rib.net/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=23 The Soltron Atlantic Challenge - Clive Tully's journal]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Priddy attempted to return the ''Jolly Sailor'' to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] (Canada) to be used by charitable organisations but the boat was hit by a large wave and sank. The crew was rescued.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3529766.stm Powerboat crew's Atlantic rescue] BBC News web-site, 3 August 2004; extracted 25 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3531866.stm Skipper 'thought it was all over'] BBC News web-site, 3 August 2004; extracted 25 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Lively Lady'' Project ===
[[File:LL leaving.jpg|thumb|''Lively Lady'' leaving Portsmouth in 2006]]
From 2006 to 2008, Priddy circumnavigated the world aboard [[Alec Rose|Sir Alec Rose's]] yacht ''Lively Lady''. The 36-foot, 60-year-old, sailing vessel was crewed by a group of 38 disadvantaged young adults. The voyage began in Portsmouth and finished there on 5 July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hampshire/7491256.stm Lively Lady returns 40 years on] BBC News web-site, 5 July 2008; extracted 13 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Priddy continued the project as the charity "Around and Around" with graduates serving as mentors for new crew participants on future world circumnavigations. In 2009 Priddy was leased ''Lively Lady'' by Portsmouth City Council for 25 years for her to be maintained and used by the charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Yachting Monthly|date=12 October 2009|author=Durham, Dick|title=Lively Lady returns to Alan Priddy|url=http://www.yachtingmonthly.com/news/lively-lady-returns-to-alan-priddy-8547|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Powerboat circumnavigation record attempt===
In 2015 Priddy confirmed that an attempt to break the powerboat circumnavigation record would be made after trials of the purpose-built £2.9m, {{convert|80|ft|m}} powerboat in the summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The News (Portsmouth)|date=12 January 2015|title=Ocean racer Alan Priddy unveils round-the-world powerboat|url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/news/business/local-business/ocean-racer-alan-priddy-unveils-round-the-world-powerboat-1-6516287|accessdate=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was begun in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Daily Mail|date=28 September 2014|title=British sailor hopes to smash world record by circumnavigating the globe on 'floating fuel tank'|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2772618/British-sailor-hopes-smash-world-record-circumnavigating-globe-floating-fuel-tank.html|accessdate=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2015 Priddy announced plans to offer places on the project to ''Blesma'', a group of wounded service personnel who have formed a powerboat racing team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The News, Portsmouth|date=3 April 2015|title=Sailing legend Alan Priddy meets wounded servicemen|url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/news/sailing-legend-alan-priddy-meets-wounded-servicemen-1-6671662|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was placed in jeopardy in 2015 when one of the sponsors withdrew, but replacement funding was subsequently secured to put the project, named ''Team Britannia'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=''Wales online''|date=21 June 2016|author=Rachel Misstear|title=Pembrokeshire adrenaline junkie will join crew for new round the world record attempt|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/pembrokeshire-adrenaline-junkie-join-crew-11479511|accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; back on track for the record attempt to be made in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC|title=Alan Priddy round-the-world powerboat record bid back on|date=17 April 2016|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-36053098|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=ITV|title=Hampshire powerboat legend's record attempt 'back on'|date=17 April 2016|url=http://www.itv.com/news/meridian/update/2016-04-17/hampshire-powerboat-legends-record-attempt-back-on/|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 2002, Priddy was given a Special Achievement Award by the British Inflatable Boat Owners' Association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boatingbusiness.com/news101/industry-news/priddy_gets_achievement_award Priddy gets achievement award, 1 Jan 2002] Boating Business&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Priddy received a  [[We Can Do It (award)|We Can Do It]] Special Achievement Award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/people/Picture-special-We-Can-Do.4774096.jp We Can Do It Special Achievement Award] We Can Do It Awards 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and was made a Paul Harris Fellow for his work with disadvantaged young adults. In July 2017 he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by the University of Portsmouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=''Boating Business''|url=http://www.boatingbusiness.com/news101/industry-news/honorary-doctorate-for-alan-priddy|title=Honorary doctorate for Alan Priddy|date=20 July 2017|accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ExxonMobil]]'s '''Baton Rouge Refinery''' in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]] is the fourth-largest [[oil refinery]] in the [[United States]] and twelfth-largest in the world,&lt;ref&gt;[[List of oil refineries#World.27s largest refineries]]&lt;/ref&gt; with an input capacity of {{convert|502500|oilbbl|m3}} per day as of January 1, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://cdn.exxonmobil.com/~/media/global/files/us-refineries/2016_brrf_fact_sheet.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The refinery is the site of the first commercial [[Fluid catalytic cracking|fluid catalytic cracking plant]] that began processing at the refinery on May 25, 1942.

[[Standard Oil]] first erected the refinery in 1909.  Today's facility is part of a complex made of nine individual plants across the region.  The main plant is located on the east bank of the [[Mississippi River]].  There are about 6,300 workers spread across these sites, including 4,000 direct [[employee]]s (the rest are [[general contractor|contractors]]).

Genesis Energy LP recently invested $125 million to improve ExxonMobil's existing assets in the Baton Rouge area. The investment includes plans to build an 18-mile, 20-inch diameter crude oil pipeline that connects Genesis Energy's Port Hudson terminal, to ExxonMobil's Baton Rouge refinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Perilloux|first=Gary|title=Genesis Energy To Invest $125 Million In Baton Rouge Area Infrastructure Project |url=http://www.louisianaeconomicdevelopment.com/led-news/news-releases/genesis-energy-to-invest-$125-million-in-baton-rouge-area-infrastructure-project.aspx?c=News%20Releases&amp;id=39|accessdate=2013-03-05|newspaper=Louisiana Economic Development|date=2013-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Baton Rouge refinery's tank farm has a capacity of 502,500 barrel-per-day (bpd).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hays|first=Kristen|title=Genesis Energy expanding crude delivery to Exxon Baton Rouge|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/04/update-1-genesis-batonrouge-crude-idUSL1N0B45V520130204|accessdate=2013-03-05|newspaper=Reuters|date=2012-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''cabriolet''' is a light [[horse-drawn vehicle|horse-drawn vehicle]], with two wheels and a single [[horse]]. The [[carriage]] has a [[Hood (soft top)|folding hood]] that can cover its two occupants, one of whom is the driver. It has a large rigid apron, upward-curving shafts, and usually a rear platform between the C springs for a [[Groom (horse)|groom]]. The design was developed in [[France]] in the eighteenth century and quickly replaced the heavier [[hackney carriage]] as the [[vehicle for hire]] of choice in [[Paris]] and [[London]].

The ''cab'' of [[taxicab|taxi]]-[[taxicab|cab]] or "[[hansom cab]]" is a shortening of ''cabriolet''.&lt;ref&gt;"At about ten o'clock in the evening I drove with [[Charles Eastlake|Mr Eastlake]], in a cab (the usual name given here to a cabriolet), to the [[British Institution]]..." ([[Gustav Waagen]], ''Works of Art and Artists in England'' vol. I [1838], extract in Frank Herrmann, ''The English as Collectors'' 1972, p. 227).&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Other horse-drawn cabs include:

*''[[Araba (carriage)|Araba]]'' or ''aroba'': used in [[Turkey]] and neighboring countries
*''Araña'': Mexican, two-wheeled
*''Bounder'': four-wheeled
*''[[Gharry]]'' or ''gharri'': used especially in [[India]]
*''[[Kalesa]]'' or ''calesa'' (sometimes called a ''karitela''): used in the [[Philippines]]
*''[[Dorożka]] in eastern Europe  
*''Minibus'': light carriage, usually with a rear door and seats for four passengers; formerly used as a cab
*''Two-wheeler'': two-wheeled cab or hansom

One who drives a horse-drawn cab for hire is a ''cabdriver''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/32/C0003200.html Cabdriver. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition. 2000.]&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

'''''Chlamydomonas reinhardtii''''' is a [[Unicellular organism|single-cell]] [[green alga]] about 10 [[micrometre]]s in diameter that swims with two [[flagella]]. It has a [[cell wall]] made of [[hydroxyproline]]-rich [[glycoprotein]]s, a large cup-shaped [[chloroplast]], a large [[pyrenoid]], and an "eyespot" that senses light.

''[[Chlamydomonas]]'' species are widely distributed worldwide in soil and fresh water. ''Chlamydomonas reinhardtii'' is an especially well studied biological [[model organism]], partly due to its ease of culturing and the ability to manipulate its genetics. When illuminated, ''C. reinhardtii'' can grow photoautotrophically, but it can also grow in the dark if supplied with organic carbon. Commercially, ''C. reinhardtii'' is of interest for producing biopharmaceuticals and biofuel, as well being a valuable research tool in making [[Biohydrogen|hydrogen]].

==History==
The ''C. reinhardtii'' wild-type laboratory strain c137 (mt+) originates from an isolate made near [[Amherst, Massachusetts]], in 1945 by Gilbert M. Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.chlamy.org/strains/101_200/0125.html | title = CC-125 wild type mt+ 137c | work = Chlamydomonas Center core collection list }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook, {{ISBN|978-0-12-370873-1}})&lt;/ref&gt;

The species' name has been spelled several different ways because of different transliterations of the name from Russian:  ''reinhardi'', ''reinhardii'', and ''reinhardtii'' all refer to the same species, ''C. reinhardtii'' Dangeard.&lt;ref&gt;http://megasun.bch.umontreal.ca/protists/chlamy/taxonomy.html Chlamydomonas Taxonomy.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model organism==
[[File:Cross section of a Chlamydomonas reinhardtii algae cell, a 3D representation.jpg|thumb|300px|Cross section of a Chlamydomonas reinhardtii algae cell, a 3D representation]]
''Chlamydomonas'' is used as a [[model organism]] for research on fundamental questions in [[cell (biology)|cell]] and [[molecular biology]] such as:

* How do cells move?
* How do cells respond to light?
* How do cells recognize one another?
* How do cells generate regular, repeatable [[flagellum|flagellar]] waveforms?
* How do cells regulate their proteome to control [[flagellum|flagellar]] length?
* How do cells respond to changes in mineral nutrition? (nitrogen, sulfur, etc.)

There are many known mutants of ''C. reinhardtii''. These mutants are useful tools for studying a variety of biological processes, including flagellar motility, [[photosynthesis]], and [[protein synthesis]]. Since ''Chlamydomonas'' species are normally haploid, the effects of mutations are seen immediately without further crosses.

In 2007, the complete nuclear genome sequence of ''C. reinhardtii'' was published.&lt;ref name="Merchant"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Merchant| title = The Chlamydomonas Genome Reveals the Evolution of Key Animal and Plant Functions | journal = Science | year = 2007 | volume = 318 | pages = 245–250 | pmid = 17932292|doi= 10.1126/science.1143609|last2= Prochnik|first2= SE|last3= Vallon|first3= O|last4= Harris|first4= EH|last5= Karpowicz|first5= SJ|last6= Witman|first6= GB|last7= Terry|first7= A|last8= Salamov|first8= A|last9= Fritz-Laylin|first9= LK| last10 = Marechal-Drouard | first10 = L. | last11 = Marshall | first11 = W.

[[Channelrhodopsin]]-1 and [[Channelrhodopsin]]-2, [[protein]]s that function as [[Light-gated ion channel|light-gated cation channels]], were originally isolated from ''C. reinhardtii''.&lt;ref name="Nagel2002"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nagel G, Ollig D, Fuhrmann M |title=Channelrhodopsin-1: a light-gated proton channel in green algae |journal=Science |volume=296 |issue=5577 |pages=2395–8 |date=June 28, 2002 |pmid=12089443 |doi=10.1126/science.1072068|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lagali"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Lagali PS, Balya D, Awatramani GB, Münch TA, Kim DS, Busskamp V, Cepko CL, Roska B | title = Light-activated channels targeted to ON bipolar cells restore visual function in retinal degeneration | journal = Nature Neuroscience | date = June 2008 | volume = 11 | issue = 6 | pages = 667–75 | pmid = 18432197|doi= 10.1038/nn.2117}}&lt;/ref&gt; These proteins and others like them are increasingly widely used in the field of [[optogenetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boyden ES |title=A history of optogenetics: the development of tools for controlling brain circuits with light |journal=F1000 Biology Reports |volume=3 |issue=11 |pages=online |date=May 3, 2011 |pmid=21876722 |doi=10.3410/B3-11|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mitochondrial Significance==

The genome of C. Reinhardtii is significant for mitochondrial study as it is one species where the genes for 6 of the 13 proteins encoded for the mitochondria are found in the nucleus of the cell, leaving 7 in the mitochondria. In all other species these genes are present only in the mitochondria and are unable to be allotopically expressed. This is significant for the testing and development of therapies for genetic mitochondrial diseases.

==Reproduction==
Vegetative cells of the ''reinhardtii'' species are [[haploid]] with 17 small [[chromosomes]]. Under [[nitrogen]] starvation, vegetative cells differentiate into haploid gametes.&lt;ref name="pmid13174779"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=SAGER R, GRANICK S |title=Nutritional control of sexuality in Chlamydomonas reinhardi |journal=J. Gen. Physiol. |volume=37 |issue=6 |pages=729–42 |date=July 1954  |pmid=13174779 |pmc=2147466 |doi= 10.1085/jgp.37.6.729|url=http://jgp.rupress.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=13174779}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two [[mating type]]s, identical in appearance, thus [[isogamy|isogamous]], and known as '''mt(+)''' and '''mt(-)''', which can fuse to form a [[diploid]] [[zygote]]. The zygote is not flagellated, and it serves as a dormant form of the species in the soil. In the light, the zygote undergoes [[meiosis]] and releases four flagellated haploid cells that resume the vegetative lifecycle.

Under ideal growth conditions, cells may sometimes undergo two or three rounds of [[mitosis]] before the daughter cells are released from the old cell wall into the medium. Thus, a single growth step may result in 4 or 8 daughter cells per mother cell.

The [[cell cycle]] of this unicellular green algae can be synchronized by alternating periods of light and dark. The growth phase is dependent on light, whereas, after a point designated as the transition or commitment point, processes are light-independent.&lt;ref name="Oldenhof 06"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Oldenhof H. |author2=Zachleder V. |author3=den Ende H. | year = 2006 | title = Blue- and red-light regulation of the cell cycle in ''Chlamydomonas reinhardtii'' (Chlorophyta) | url = | journal = Eur. J. Phycol. | volume = 41 | issue = 3| pages = 313–320 | doi=10.1080/09670260600699920}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetics==
The attractiveness of the algae as a model organism has recently increased with the release of several genomic resources to the public domain. The Chlre3 draft of the ''Chlamydomonas'' nuclear genome sequence prepared by Joint Genome Institute of the U.S. Dept of Energy comprises 1557 scaffolds totaling 120 Mb. Roughly half of the genome is contained in 24 scaffolds all at least 1.6 Mb in length. The current assembly of the nuclear genome is available online.&lt;ref&gt;http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Chlre3/Chlre3.home.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The ~15.8 Kb mitochondrial genome (database accession: NC_001638) is available online at the NCBI database.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/11467088&lt;/ref&gt; The complete ~203.8 Kb chloroplast genome (database accession: NC_005353) is available online.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_005353.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chlamy.org/chloro/default.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to genomic sequence data, there is a large supply of expression sequence data available as cDNA libraries and expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Seven cDNA libraries are available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chlamy.org/libraries.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041019180914/http://www.chlamy.org/libraries.html |archivedate=2004-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A BAC library can be purchased from the Clemson University Genomics Institute.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.genome.clemson.edu/&lt;/ref&gt; There are also two databases of &gt;50 000&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kazusa.or.jp/en/plant/chlamy/EST/&lt;/ref&gt; and &gt;160 000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chlamy.org/search.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050204171809/http://www.chlamy.org/search.html |archivedate=2005-02-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ESTs available online.

The genome of ''C. reinhardtii'' has been shown to contain N6-Methyldeoxyadenosine (6mA), a mark common in prokaryotes but much rarer in eukaryotes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hattman|first1=S|last2=Kenny|first2=C|last3=Berger|first3=L|last4=Pratt|first4=K|title=Comparative study of DNA methylation in three unicellular eucaryotes.|journal=Journal of Bacteriology|date=September 1978|volume=135|issue=3|pages=1156–7|pmid=99431|pmc=222496}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research has indicated that 6mA in ''Chlamydomonas'' may be involved in nucleosome positioning, as it is present in the linker regions between nucleosomes as well as near the transcription start sites of actively transcribed genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fu|first1=Ye|last2=Luo|first2=Guan-Zheng|last3=Chen|first3=Kai|last4=Deng|first4=Xin|last5=Yu|first5=Miao|last6=Han|first6=Dali|last7=Hao|first7=Ziyang|last8=Liu|first8=Jianzhao|last9=Lu|first9=Xingyu|last10=Doré|first10=Louis C.|last11=Weng|first11=Xiaocheng|last12=Ji|first12=Quanjiang|last13=Mets|first13=Laurens|last14=He|first14=Chuan|title=N6-Methyldeoxyadenosine Marks Active Transcription Start Sites in Chlamydomonas|journal=Cell|date=May 2015|volume=161|issue=4|pages=879–892|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2015.04.010|pmid=25936837|pmc=4427561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==

''Chlamydomonas'' has been used to study different aspects of evolutionary biology and ecology. It is an organism of choice for many selection experiments because (1) it has a short generation time, (2) it is both a [[heterotroph]] and a facultative [[autotroph]], (3) it can reproduce both sexually and asexually, and (4) there is a wealth of genetic information already available.

Some examples (nonexhaustive) of evolutionary work done with ''Chlamydomonas'' include the evolution of sexual reproduction,&lt;ref name="Colegrave"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Colegrave N | year = 2002 | title = Sex releases the speed limit on evolution | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 420 | issue = 6916| pages = 664–666 | doi=10.1038/nature01191 | pmid=12478292}}&lt;/ref&gt; the fitness effect of mutations,&lt;ref name="de Visser"&gt;De Visser et al. 1996 The effect of sex and deleterious mutations on fitness in ''Chlamydomonas''. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B 263-193-200.&lt;/ref&gt; and the effect of adaptation to different levels of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Collins"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Collins , Bell  | year = 2004 | title = Phenotypic consequences of 1,000 generations of selection at elevated CO2 in a green alga | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 431 | issue = 7008| pages = 566–569 | doi=10.1038/nature02945 | pmid=15457260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one frequently cited theoretical hypothesis,&lt;ref name="pmid6510714"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kondrashov AS |title=Deleterious mutations as an evolutionary factor. 1. The advantage of recombination |journal=Genet. Res. |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=199–217 |date=October 1984  |pmid=6510714 |doi= 10.1017/s0016672300026392|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; sexual reproduction (in contrast to asexual reproduction) is adaptively maintained in benign environments because it reduces mutational load by combining deleterious mutations from different lines of descent and increases mean fitness.  However, in a long-term experimental study of ''C. reinhardtii'', evidence was obtained that contradicted this hypothesis. In sexual populations, mutation clearance was not found to occur and fitness was not found to increase.&lt;ref name="pmid17236420"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Renaut S, Replansky T, Heppleston A, Bell G |title=The ecology and genetics of fitness in Chlamydomonas. XIII. Fitness of long-term sexual and asexual populations in benign environments |journal=Evolution |volume=60 |issue=11 |pages=2272–9 |date=November 2006  |pmid=17236420 |doi= 10.1554/06-084.1|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==DNA transformation techniques==
Gene transformation occurs mainly by homologous recombination in the chloroplast and heterologous recombination in the nucleus. The ''C. reinhardtii'' chloroplast genome can be transformed using microprojectile particle bombardment or glass bead agitation, however this last method is far less efficient. The nuclear genome has been transformed with both glass bead agitation and electroporation. The biolistic procedure appears to be the most efficient way of introducing DNA into the chloroplast genome. This is probably because the chloroplast occupies over half of the volume of the cell providing the microprojectile with a large target.

==Clean source of hydrogen production==
{{Main|Biological hydrogen production (Algae)}}
In 1939, the German researcher [[Hans Gaffron]] (1902–1979), who was at that time attached to the University of Chicago, discovered the hydrogen metabolism of unicellular green algae. ''Chlamydomonas reinhardtii'' and some other green algae can, under specified circumstances, stop producing oxygen and convert instead to the production of hydrogen. This reaction by [[hydrogenase]], an [[enzyme]] active only in the absence of oxygen, is short-lived. Over the next thirty years, Gaffron and his team worked out the basic mechanics of this photosynthetic hydrogen production by algae.&lt;ref name="Hydrogen production"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Anastasios Melis |author2=Thomas Happe | title=Trails of green alga hydrogen research&amp;nbsp;— from Hans Gaffron to new frontiers| journal=Photosynthesis Research| year=2004| volume=80| url=http://www.life.uiuc.edu/govindjee/Part3/33_Melis.pdf| pages=401–409| doi=10.1023/B:PRES.0000030421.31730.cb | pmid=16328836 | issue=1–3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To increase the production of hydrogen, several tracks are being followed by the researchers.
* The first track is decoupling hydrogenase from photosynthesis. This way, oxygen accumulation can no longer inhibit the production of hydrogen. And, if one goes one step further by changing the structure of the enzyme hydrogenase, it becomes possible to render hydrogenase insensitive to oxygen. This makes a continuous production of hydrogen possible. In this case, the flux of electrons needed for this production no longer comes from the production of sugars but is drawn from the breakdown of its own stock of [[starch]].&lt;ref name="algae"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Laurent Cournac |author2=Florence Musa |author3=Laetitia Bernarda |author4=Geneviève Guedeneya |author5=Paulette Vignaisb |author6=Gilles Peltie | title=Limiting steps of hydrogen production in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Synechocystis PCC 6803 as analysed by light-induced gas exchange transients| journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy  | year=2002| volume=27| issue=11/12| doi= 10.1016/S0360-3199(02)00105-2| pages=1229–1237}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A second track is to interrupt temporarily, through [[genetic manipulation]] of hydrogenase, the photosynthesis process. This inhibits oxygen's reaching a level where it is able to stop the production of hydrogen.&lt;ref name="Anastasios Melis"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://epmb.berkeley.edu/facPage/dispFP.php?I=25|title=Hydrogen and hydrocarbon biofuels production via microalgal photosynthesis|accessdate=2008-04-07|author=Anastasios Melis}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The third track, mainly investigated by researchers in the 1950s, is chemical or mechanical methods of removal of O2 produced by the photosynthetic activity of the algal cells. These have included the addition of O2 scavengers, the use of added reductants, and purging the cultures with inert gases.&lt;ref name="Kosourov, S. Tsyganov, A.

Bioeng.|pages=731–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these methods are not inherently scalable, and may not be applicable to applied systems. New research has appeared on the subject of removing oxygen from algae cultures, and may eliminate scaling problems.
*The fourth track has been investigated, namely using copper salts to decouple hydrogenase action from oxygen production.&lt;ref name="Fernandez VM, Rua ML, Reyes P, Cammack R, Hatchikian EC."&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=2555191|title=Inhibition of Desulfovibrio gigas hydrogenase with copper salts and other metal ions|vauthors=Fernandez VM, Rua ML, Reyes P, Cammack R, Hatchikian EC | volume=185|issue=2|date=November 1989|journal=Eur.

The '''Coastal forests of eastern Africa''' is a [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist forest]] region along the east coast of Africa. The region was designated a [[biodiversity hotspot]] by [[Conservation International]].

The forests extend in al narrow band along the coast of the [[Indian Ocean]], from southern [[Somalia]] in the north, through coastal [[Kenya]] and [[Tanzania]] to the mouth of the [[Limpopo River]] in southern [[Mozambique]].

The [[World Wildlife Fund]] divides the coastal forests into two ecoregions: the [[Northern Zanzibar-Inhambane coastal forest mosaic]], which extends from southern Somalia through coastal Kenya to southern Tanzania, and includes the islands of [[Zanzibar]] and [[Pemba Island|Pemba]], and the [[Southern Zanzibar-Inhambane coastal forest mosaic]], which extends from southern Tanzania along the Mozambique coast to the mouth of the Limpopo.

[[Image:Catvertroquette.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Tata OneCAT|Tata/MDI OneCAT]]]]
A '''compressed air car''' is a [[compressed air vehicle]] that uses a motor powered by [[compressed air]]. The car can be powered solely by air, or combined (as in a hybrid electric vehicle) with [[gasoline]], [[Diesel fuel|diesel]], [[ethanol]], or an electric plant with [[regenerative braking]].

==Tech==

===Engines===
{{Main|Compressed air engine}}
Compressed air cars are powered by motors driven by [[compressed air]], which is stored in a [[Diving cylinder|tank]] at high pressure such as 31 M[[Pascal (unit)|Pa]] (4500 psi or 310 bar).  Rather than driving engine pistons with an ignited fuel-air mixture, ''compressed air cars'' use the [[Thermal expansion|expansion]] of compressed air, in a similar manner to the expansion of steam in a [[steam engine]].

There have been prototype cars since the 1920s, with compressed air used in [[torpedo]] [[Marine propulsion|propulsion]].

===Storage tanks===
{{Main|Compressed air tank}}
In contrast to hydrogen's issues of damage and danger involved in high-impact crashes, air, on its own, is non-flammable, it was reported on [[Seven Network|Seven Network's]] ''[[Beyond Tomorrow (TV series)|Beyond Tomorrow]]'' that on its own carbon-fiber is [[wikt:brittle|brittle]] and can split under sufficient stress, but creates no [[fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]] when it does so. Carbon-fiber tanks safely hold air at a pressure somewhere around 4500 psi, making them comparable to steel tanks. The cars are designed to be filled up at a high-pressure pump.

In compressed air vehicles tank designs tend to be isothermal; a heat exchanger of some kind is used to maintain the temperature (and pressure) of the tank as the air is extracted.

====Energy density====
[[Compressed air]] has relatively low [[energy density]].  Air at 30 [[Pascal (unit)|MPa]] (4,500&amp;nbsp;psi) contains about 50&amp;nbsp;Wh of energy per liter (and normally weighs 372g per liter).{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}  For comparison, a [[lead–acid battery]] contains 60-75 Wh/l.  A [[lithium-ion battery]] contains about 250-620 Wh/l.  The EPA estimates the energy density of [[gasoline]] at 8,890 Wh/l;&lt;ref&gt;Bowlin, Ben. [http://www.carstuffshow.com/blog/how-to-convert-gasoline-energy-to-kilowatt-hours-kwh/ "How to Convert Gasoline Energy to Kilowatt-hours (kWh) "] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108010330/http://www.carstuffshow.com/blog/how-to-convert-gasoline-energy-to-kilowatt-hours-kwh/ |date=2015-01-08 }}, Retrieved on 7 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; however, a typical gasoline engine with 18% efficiency can only recover the equivalent of 1694 Wh/l.  The energy density of a compressed air system can be more than doubled if the air is heated prior to expansion.

In order to increase energy density, some systems may use gases that can be liquified or solidified. "CO2 offers far greater compressibility than air when it transitions from gaseous to supercritical form."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/ef020162b |laysummary=http://www.lbl.gov/tt/techs/lbnl2570.html |laysource=[[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] |title=Carbon Dioxide as Cushion Gas for Natural Gas Storage |year=2003 |last1=Oldenburg |first1=Curtis M. |journal=Energy &amp; Fuels |volume=17 |pages=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emissions==
Compressed air cars could be [[emission standard|emission]]-free at the exhaust. Since a compressed air car's source of energy is usually electricity, its total environmental impact depends on how clean the source of this electricity is. However, most air cars have petrol engines for different tasks. The emission can be compared to half of the amount of carbon dioxide produced by a Toyota Prius (being around 0.34 pounds per mile). Some engines can be fueled otherwise considering different regions can have very different sources of power, ranging from high-emission power sources such as [[fossil fuel power plant|coal]] to zero-emission power sources. A given region can also change its electrical power sources over time, thereby improving or worsening total emissions.

However, a 2009 study showed that even with very optimistic assumptions, air storage of energy is less efficient than chemical (battery) storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Creutzig|first=Felix|last2=Papson|first2=Andrew|last3=Schipper|first3=Lee|last4=Kammen|first4=Daniel M.|date=2009-01-01|title=Economic and environmental evaluation of compressed-air cars|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/4/4/044011/pdf|journal=Environmental Research Letters|language=en|volume=4|issue=4|pages=044011|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/4/4/044011|issn=1748-9326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
The principal advantages of an air powered engine is
*It uses no gasoline or other bio-carbon based fuel.
*Refueling may be done at home,&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite news |date=October 4, 2004 |title=Car runs on compressed air, but will it sell? |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6138972/ |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=2008-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; but filling the tanks to full pressure would require compressors for 250-300 bars, which are not normally available for home standard utilization, considering the danger inherent at these pressure levels. As with gasoline, service stations would have to install the necessary air facilities if such cars became sufficiently popular to warrant it.
*Compressed air engines reduce the cost of vehicle production, because there is no need to build a cooling system, spark plugs, starter motor, or mufflers.
*The rate of [[self-discharge]] is very low opposed to batteries that deplete their charge slowly over time. Therefore, the vehicle may be left unused for longer periods of time than electric cars.
*Expansion of the compressed air lowers its temperature; this may be exploited for use as [[air conditioning]].
*Reduction or elimination of hazardous chemicals such as gasoline or battery acids/metals
*Some mechanical configurations may allow [[energy recovery]] during braking by compressing and storing air.
*Sweden's Lund University reports that buses could see an improvement in fuel efficiency of up to 60 percent using an air-hybrid system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bioscholar.com/2011/02/air-hybrid-vehicles-could-halve-fuel-consumption-in-future.html |title=Air hybrid vehicles could halve fuel consumption in future |agency=[[Asian News International]] |date=March 20, 2011 |accessdate=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; But this only refers to hybrid air concepts (due to recuperation of energy during braking), not compressed air-only vehicles.

==Disadvantages==
The principal disadvantages are the  steps of energy conversion and transmission, because each inherently has loss. For combustion engine cars, the energy is lost when chemical energy in fossil fuels is converted by the engine to mechanical energy. For electric cars, a power plant's electricity (from whatever source) is transmitted to the car's batteries, which then transmits the electricity to the car's motor, which converts it to mechanical energy. For compressed-air cars, the power plant's electricity is transmitted to a compressor, which mechanically compresses the air into the car's tank. The car's engine then converts the compressed air to mechanical energy.

Additional concerns:
* When air expands in the engine it cools dramatically and must be heated to ambient temperature using a heat exchanger. The heating is necessary in order to obtain a significant fraction of the theoretical energy output. The heat exchanger can be problematic: while it performs a similar task to an [[intercooler]] for an internal combustion engine, the temperature difference between the incoming air and the working gas is smaller. In heating the stored air, the device gets very cold and may ice up in cool, moist climates.
*This also leads to the necessity of completely dehydrating the compressed air. If any humidity subsists in the compressed air, the engine will stop due to inner icing. Removing the humidity completely requires additional energy that cannot be reused and is lost. (At 10g of water per m3 air -typical value in the summer- you have to take out 900 g of water in 90 m3; with a vaporization enthalpy of 2.26MJ/kg you will need theoretically minimally 0.6 kWh; technically, with cold drying this figure must be multiplied by 3 - 4. Moreover, dehydrating can only be done with professional compressors, so that a home charging will completely be impossible, or at least not at any reasonable cost.)
* Conversely, when air is compressed to fill the tank, its temperature increases.  If the stored air is not cooled while the tank is being filled, then when the air cools off later, its pressure decreases and the available energy decreases.&lt;br/&gt; To mitigate this, the tank may be equipped with an internal heat-exchanger in order to cool the air quickly and efficiently while charging.&lt;br/&gt; Alternatively, a spring may be used to store work from the air as it is inserted in the tank, thus maintaining a low pressure difference between the tank and recharger, which results in a lower temperature raise for the transferred air.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}
* Refueling the compressed air container using a home or low-end conventional air compressor may take as long as 4 hours, though specialized equipment at service stations may fill the tanks in only 3 minutes.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt; To store 2.5 kWh @300 bar in 300 liter reservoirs (90 m3 of air @ 1 bar), requires about 30 kWh of compressor energy (with a single-stage [[adiabatic]] compressor), or approx. 21 kWh with an industrial standard multistage unit. That means a compressor power of 360&amp;nbsp;kW is needed to fill the reservoirs in 5 minutes from a single stage unit, or 250&amp;nbsp;kW for a multistage one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seacomair.com/sca600sl.html |title=SCA650E43/HDF-SILENT SeaComAir Silent 23 cfm 11 kW Electric Motor 400V/50Hz or 60Hz Three phase |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311212017/http://www.seacomair.com/sca600sl.html |archivedate=2012-03-11 |df= }}{{unreliable source?|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, intercooling and isothermal compression is far more efficient and more practical than adiabatic compression, if sufficiently large heat exchangers are fitted. Efficiencies of up to 65% might perhaps be achieved,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Ulf |last1=Bossel |date=April 2, 2009 |title=Thermodynamic Analysis of Compressed Air Vehicle Propulsion |url=http://www.efcf.com/reports/E14.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717085501/http://www.efcf.com/reports/E14.pdf |archivedate=2012-07-17 |df= }}{{unreliable source?|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (whereas current efficiency for large industrial compressors is max. 50% ) however this is lower than the Coulomb's efficiency with lead acid batteries. 
* The overall efficiency of a vehicle using [[compressed air energy storage]], using the above refueling figures, is around 5-7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australianscience.com.au/technology/the-fuel-of-the-future/|title=The Fuel of the Future|work=Australian Science|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For comparison, [[well to wheel]] efficiency of a conventional internal-combustion drivetrain is about 14%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.transportation.anl.gov/pdfs/HV/300.pdf |title=Comparing Apples to Apples: Well-to-Wheel Analysis of Current ICE and Fuel Cell Vehicle Technologies, p.15 |publisher=Argonne National laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Early tests have demonstrated the limited storage capacity of the tanks; the only published test of a vehicle running on compressed air alone was limited to a range of 7.22&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sebastian Braud sebb@motordeaire.com |url=http://www.theaircar.com/tests.html  |title=MDI refilling stations |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2007-03-21 |accessdate=2010-12-12 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070321053002/http://www.theaircar.com/tests.html |archivedate = 2007-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 2005 study demonstrated that cars running on [[lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion batteries]] out-perform both compressed air and [[fuel cell vehicle]]s more than threefold at the same speeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wind-to-Wheel Energy Assessment |url=http://www.efcf.com/reports/E18.pdf |format=PDF |author=Patrick Mazza |author2=Roel Hammerschlag |publisher=Institute for Lifecycle Environmental Assessment |accessdate=2008-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911042043/http://www.efcf.com/reports/E18.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Motor Development International|MDI]] claimed in 2007 that an air car will be able to travel 140&amp;nbsp;km in urban driving, and have a range of 80&amp;nbsp;km with a top speed of {{convert|110|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} on highways,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdi.lu/eng/affiche_eng.php?page=minicats |title=MDI Enterprises S.A |publisher=Mdi.lu |accessdate=2010-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; when operating on compressed air alone but as of August 2017 have yet to produce a vehicle that matches this performance.
* A 2009 University of Berkeley Research Letter found that "Even under highly optimistic assumptions the compressed-air car is significantly less efficient than a battery electric vehicle and produces more greenhouse gas emissions than a conventional gas-powered car with a coal intensive power mix." However, they also suggested, "a pneumatic–combustion hybrid is technologically feasible, inexpensive and could eventually compete with hybrid electric vehicles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1088/1748-9326/4/4/044011 |title=Economic and environmental evaluation of compressed-air cars |year=2009 |last1=Creutzig |first1=Felix |last2=Papson |first2=Andrew |last3=Schipper |first3=Lee |last4=Kammen |first4=Daniel M |journal=Environmental Research Letters |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=044011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is often{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} accompanied by a small petrol powered engine that helps it with various tasks such as starting and maintaining working speeds. This engine emits carbon dioxide.

==Crash safety==
Safety claims for light weight vehicle air tanks in severe collisions have not been verified.
North American crash testing has not yet been conducted, and skeptics question the ability of an ultralight vehicle assembled with adhesives to produce acceptable crash safety results. Shiva Vencat, vice president of MDI and CEO of Zero Pollution Motors, claims the vehicle would pass crash testing and meet U.S. safety standards. He insists that the millions of dollars invested in the AirCar would not be in vain. To date, there has never been a lightweight, 100-plus mpg car which passed North American crash testing. Technological advances may soon make this possible, but the AirCar has yet to prove itself, and collision safety questions remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=A. |last=Pawlowski |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/TECH/08/08/air.car/index.html |title=106 mpg 'air car' creates buzz, questions |publisher=CNN |date=August 8, 2008 |accessdate=2009-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The key to achieving an acceptable range with an air car is reducing the power required to drive the car, so far as is practical. This pushes the design towards minimizing weight.

According to a report by the U.S. Government's [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]], among 10 different classes of passenger vehicles, "very small cars" have the highest fatality rate per mile driven.  For instance, a person driving 12,000 miles per year for 55 years would have a 1% chance of being involved in a fatal accident.  This is twice the fatality rate of the safest vehicle class, a "large car".  According to the data in this report, the number of fatal crashes per mile is only weakly correlated with the vehicle weight, having a [[correlation]] coefficient of just (-0.45).  A stronger correlation is seen with the vehicle ''size'' within its class; for example, "large" cars, pickups and SUVs, have lower fatality rates than "small" cars, pickups and SUVs.  This is the case in 7 of the 10 classes, with the exception of mid-size vehicles, where minivans and mid-size cars are among the safest classes, while mid-size SUVs are the second most fatal after very small cars.  Even though heavier vehicles sometimes are statistically safer, it is not necessarily the extra ''weight'' that ''causes'' them to be safer.  The NHTSA report states: "Heavier vehicles have historically done a better job cushioning their occupants in crashes.  Their longer hoods and extra space in the occupant compartment provide an opportunity for a more gradual deceleration of the vehicle, and of the occupant within the vehicle... While it is conceivable that light vehicles could be built with similarly long hoods and mild deceleration pulses, it would probably require major changes in materials and design and/or taking weight out of their engines, accessories, etc."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Vehicle Weight, Fatality Risk and Crash Compatibility of Model Year 1991-99 Passenger Cars and Light Trucks Report |date=October 2003|url=http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/rules/regrev/evaluate/pdf/809662.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=[[United States Department of Transportation]] |first=Charles J. |last=Kahane |accessdate=2008-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Air cars may use [[low rolling resistance tires]], which typically offer less grip than normal tires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Low-rolling-resistance tires|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/cars/tires-auto-parts/tires/low-rolling-resistance-tires-8-06/overview/0608_low-rolling-resistance-tires_ov.htm|publisher=[[Consumer Reports]]|accessdate=2008-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Planned EU Requirements for Tires Would Reduce Road Traffic Safety |url=http://www.conti-online.com/generator/www/com/en/continental/portal/themes/press_services/press_releases/safety/pr_2007_11_12_eu_vorgaben_en.html|publisher=[[Continental AG]]|accessdate=2008-09-12}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the weight (and price) of safety systems such as airbags, ABS and ESC may discourage manufacturers from including them.

==Developers and manufacturers==
Various companies are investing in the [[R&amp;D|research, development and deployment]] of ''Compressed air cars''. Overoptimistic reports of impending production date back to at least May 1999. For instance, the MDI Air Car made its public debut in [[South Africa]] in 2002,&lt;ref name="HowStuffWorks"&gt;{{cite web| title=How Air-Powered Cars Will Work | author=Kevin Bonsor | publisher=[[HowStuffWorks]] |date=2005-10-25 | accessdate=2006-05-25 | url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/air-car.htm/printable}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was predicted to be in production "within six months" in January 2004.&lt;ref name="SundayTimes"&gt;{{cite news | title=Gone with the wind | author=Robyn Curnow | publisher=[[The Sunday Times (UK)]] |date=2004-01-11 | accessdate=2006-05-25 | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/printFriendly/0,,1-120-957436-120,00.html | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2009, the air car never went into production in South Africa.
Most of the cars under development also rely on using similar technology to low-energy vehicles in order to increase the range and performance of their cars.{{clarify|date=April 2014|reason=After [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Low-energy vehicle]] there is no way to tell what low-energy vehicle technology is.}}

===MDI===
{{Main|Motor Development International}}
[[Motor Development International|MDI]] has proposed a range of vehicles made up of [[AIRPod]], OneFlowAir, CityFlowAir, MiniFlowAir and MultiFlowAir.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;[http://www.aircars.tk/ Learn everything about the compressed air cars!] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520152900/http://aircars.tk/ |date=2013-05-20 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main innovations of this company is its implementation of its "active chamber", which is a compartment which heats the air (through the use of a fuel) in order to double the energy output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefuture.net.nz/mdi_tech.htm |title=MDI's active chamber |publisher=Thefuture.net.nz |accessdate=2010-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507151344/http://www.thefuture.net.nz/mdi_tech.htm |archivedate=2011-05-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This 'innovation' was first used in [[torpedo]]es in 1904.

===Peugeot/Citroën===
Peugeot and Citroën announced that they intended to build a car that uses compressed air as an energy source. However, the car they are designing uses a hybrid system which also uses a gasoline engine (which is used for propelling the car over 70&amp;nbsp;km/h, or when the compressed air tank has been depleted).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gas2.org/2013/02/18/compressed-air-hybrid-car-developed/ |title=Compressed-Air Hybrid Car Developed |publisher=Gas2.org |date=2013-02-18 |accessdate=2013-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inhabitat.com/peugeot-announces-plans-to-release-a-hybrid-car-that-runs-on-compressed-air-by-2016/|title=Peugeot Announces Plans to Release a Hybrid Car That Runs on Compressed Air by 2016|author=Marc Carter|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In January 2015, there was "Disappointing news from France: PSA Peugeot Citroen has put an indefinite hold on the development of its promising-sounding Hybrid Air powertrain, apparently because the company has been unable to find a development partner willing to split the huge costs of engineering the system." Development costs are estimated to 500 million Euro for the system, which would apparently have need to be fitted to around 500,000 cars a year to make sense.

A '''cornucopian''' is a [[futurist]] who believes that continued progress and provision of material items for mankind can be met by similarly continued advances in technology. Fundamentally they believe that there is enough matter and energy on the Earth to provide for the population of the world.

Looking further into the future, they posit that the abundance of matter and energy in space would appear to give humanity almost unlimited room for growth.

The term comes from the [[cornucopia]], the "horn of plenty" of [[Greek mythology]], which magically supplied its owners with endless food and drink.  The cornucopians are sometimes known as "boomsters", and their philosophic opponents&amp;mdash;[[Malthus]] and his school&amp;mdash;are called "doomsters" or "[[doomer]]s."&lt;ref name="Tierney"&gt;{{cite journal |magazine=The New York Times Magazine |author=John Tierney |date=December 2, 1990 |title=Betting on the Planet |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE1DA163CF931A35751C1A966958260&amp;pagewanted=all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
{{Quotation|"When civilization [population] increases, the available labor again increases. In turn, luxury again increases in correspondence with the increasing profit, and the customs and needs of luxury increase. Crafts are created to obtain luxury products. The value realized from them increases, and, as a result, profits are again multiplied in the town. Production there is thriving even more than before. And so it goes with the second and third increase. All the additional labor serves luxury and wealth, in contrast to the original labor that served the necessity of life."-[[Ibn Khaldun]](1332–1406), from [[Muqaddimah]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Khaldun]], ''[[Muqaddimah]]'', 2:272-73, quoted in Dieter Weiss (1995), "Ibn Khaldun on Economic Transformation", ''International Journal of Middle East Studies'' '''27''' (1), p. 29-37 [30].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As a society becomes more wealthy, it also creates a well-developed set of legal rules to produce the conditions of freedom and security that progress requires.

In ''[[Progress and Poverty]]'' written in 1879, after describing the powerful reproductive forces of nature, the political economist [[Henry George]] wrote, "That the earth could maintain a thousand billions of people as easily as a thousand millions is a necessary deduction from the manifest truths that, at least so far as our agency is concerned, matter is eternal and force must forever continue to act." &lt;ref&gt;George, Henry. ''Progress and Poverty, Volumes I and II: An Inquiry into the Cause of Industrial Depressions and of Increase of Want with Increase of Wealth''.

==Description by an opposing view==

Stereotypically, a cornucopian is someone who posits that there are few intractable natural limits to growth and believes the world can provide a practically limitless abundance of natural resources.  The label 'cornucopian' is rarely self-applied, and is most commonly used derogatorily by those who believe that the target is overly optimistic about the resources that will be available in the future.

One common example of this labeling is by those who are skeptical of the view that technology can solve, or overcome, the problem of an [[Human overpopulation|exponentially-increasing human population]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalchange.umich.edu/globalchange2/current/lectures/human_pop/human_pop.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724101452/http://www.globalchange.umich.edu/globalchange2/current/lectures/human_pop/human_pop.html |archivedate=July 24, 2011 |title=Population Growth over Human History |publisher=University of Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt; living off a finite base of natural resources.

'''Cyclopropane''' is a [[cycloalkane]] [[molecule]] with the molecular formula C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, consisting of three [[carbon]] [[atoms]] linked to each other to form a ring, with each carbon atom bearing two [[hydrogen atom]]s resulting in D&lt;sub&gt;3h&lt;/sub&gt; [[molecular symmetry]]. The small size of the ring creates substantial [[ring strain]] in the structure.

Cyclopropane is an [[anaesthetic]] when inhaled.  In modern anaesthetic practice, it has been superseded by other agents. Due to its extreme reactivity, cyclopropane-oxygen mixtures may explode.

Cyclopropane was discovered in 1881 by [[August Freund]], who also proposed the correct structure for the new substance in his first paper.&lt;ref name=Freund81&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Über Trimethylen | trans-title = On trimethylene | author = August Freund | volume = 26 | issue = 1 | year = 1881 | doi = 10.1002/prac.18820260125 | journal = Journal für Praktische Chemie | pages = 367–377 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WSzzAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA367#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freund treated [[1,3-Dibromopropane|1,3-dibromopropane]] with [[sodium]], causing an intramolecular [[Wurtz reaction]] leading directly to cyclopropane.&lt;ref name=Freund82&gt;{{cite journal | title = Über Trimethylen | trans-title = On trimethylene | author = August Freund | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | year = 1882 | doi = 10.1007/BF01516828 | journal = Monatshefte für Chemie … | pages = 625–635 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=b448AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA625#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The yield of the reaction was improved by Gustavson in 1887 with the use of [[zinc]] instead of sodium.&lt;ref name=Gustavson&gt;{{cite journal

==Anaesthesia==
Cyclopropane was introduced into clinical use by the American anaesthetist [[Ralph M. Waters|Ralph Waters]] who used a closed system with carbon dioxide absorption to conserve this then-costly agent.
Cyclopropane is a relatively potent, non-irritating and sweet smelling agent with a [[minimum alveolar concentration]] of 17.5%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eger|first=Edmond I.|author2=Brandstater, Bernard |author3=Saidman, Lawrence J. |author4=Regan, Michael J. |author5=Severinghaus, John W. |author6= Munson, Edwin S. |title=Equipotent Alveolar Concentrations of Methoxyflurane, Halothane, Diethyl Ether, Fluroxene, Cyclopropane, Xenon and Nitrous Oxide in the Dog|journal=Anesthesiology|year=1965|volume=26|issue=6|pages=771–777|doi=10.1097/00000542-196511000-00012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Blood:gas partition coefficient|blood/gas partition coefficient]] of 0.55. This meant induction of anaesthesia by inhalation of cyclopropane and oxygen was rapid and not unpleasant. However at the conclusion of prolonged anaesthesia patients could suffer a sudden decrease in blood pressure, potentially leading to [[cardiac dysrhythmia]]; a reaction known as "cyclopropane shock".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=JOHNSTONE|first=M|author2=Alberts, JR|title=Cyclopropane anesthesia and ventricular arrhythmias.|journal=British Heart Journal|date=July 1950|volume=12|issue=3|pages=239–44|pmid=15426685|doi=10.1136/hrt.12.3.239|pmc=479392}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, as well as its high cost and its explosive nature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacDonald|first=AG|title=A short history of fires and explosions caused by anaesthetic agents.|journal=British Journal of Anaesthesia|date=June 1994|volume=72|issue=6|pages=710–22|pmid=8024925|doi=10.1093/bja/72.6.710}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was latterly used only for the induction of anaesthesia, and has not been available for clinical use since the mid 1980s.

===Pharmacology===
Cyclopropane is inactive at the [[GABAA receptor|GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[glycine receptor]]s, and instead acts as an [[NMDA receptor antagonist]].&lt;ref name="HemmingsHopkins2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hugh C.

==Structure and bonding==
{{further|Bent bond}}
[[File:Coulson Moffit Model.png|150px|thumb|left|Orbital overlap in the bent bonding model of cyclopropane]]
The triangular structure of cyclopropane requires the [[bond angle]]s  between carbon-carbon covalent bonds to be 60°. This is far less than the thermodynamically most stable angle of 109.5° (for bonds between atoms with sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; [[Orbital hybridisation|hybridised orbitals]]) and leads to significant ring strain. The molecule also has torsional strain due to the [[eclipsed conformation]] of its hydrogen atoms. As such, the bonds between the carbon atoms are considerably weaker than in a typical [[alkane]], resulting in much higher reactivity.

Bonding between the carbon centres is generally described in terms of [[bent bond]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Eric V. Anslyn and Dennis A. Dougherty. ''Modern Physical Organic Chemistry.'' 2006. pages 850-852&lt;/ref&gt; In this model the carbon-carbon bonds are bent outwards so that the inter-orbital angle is 104°.  This reduces the level of bond strain and is achieved by distorting the sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; hybridisation of carbon atoms to technically sp&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; hybridisation&lt;ref&gt;http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic93502.files/Lectures_and_Handouts/06-Handouts/deMeijere.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic1032290.files/lecture%203.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e. {{frac|1|6}} s density and {{frac|5|6}} p density) so that the C-C bonds have more π character than normal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Knipe|first=edited by A.C.|title=March's advanced organic chemistry reactions, mechanisms, and structure.|year=2007|publisher=Wiley-Interscience|location=Hoboken, N.J.|isbn=0470084944|page=219|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; (at the same time the carbon-to-hydrogen bonds gain more s-character). One unusual consequence of bent bonding is that while the C-C bonds in cyclopropane are weaker than normal, the carbon atoms are also closer together than in a regular alkane bond: 151 [[picometer|pm]] versus 153 pm (average [[alkene]] bond: 146 pm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Allen|first=Frank H.|author2=Kennard, Olga |author3=Watson, David G. |author4=Brammer, Lee |author5=Orpen, A. Guy |author6= Taylor, Robin |title=Tables of bond lengths determined by X-ray and neutron diffraction. Part 1.

Stability due to cyclic delocalization of the six electrons of cyclopropane's three CC σ bonds was given by [[Michael J. S. Dewar]] as an explanation of the only slightly greater strain of cyclopropane ("only" 27.6&amp;nbsp;kcal/mol) as compared to cyclobutane (26.2&amp;nbsp;kcal/mol) with cyclohexane as reference with E&lt;sub&gt;str&lt;/sub&gt;=0&amp;nbsp;kcal/mol.&lt;ref&gt;S. W. Benson, Thermochemical Kinetics, S. 273, J. Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, London, Sydney, Toronto 1976&lt;/ref&gt; This stabilization is referred to as σ aromaticity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dewar | first1 = M. J. | year = 1984 | title = Chemical Implications of σ Conjugation | url = | journal = J. Am. Chem. Soc. | volume = 106 | issue = | pages = 669–682 | doi=10.1021/ja00315a036}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cremer | first1 = D. | year = 1988 | title = Pros and Cons of σ-Aromaticity | doi = 10.1016/s0040-4020(01)86238-4 | journal = Tetrahedron | volume = 44 | issue = 2| pages = 7427–7454 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to the usual π aromaticity, that, for example, is a highly stabilizing effect in [[benzene]]. Other studies do not support the role of σ-aromaticity in cyclopropane and the existence of an induced ring current; such studies provide an alternative explanation for the energetic stabilization and abnormal magnetic behaviour of cyclopropane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wu | first1 = Wei | last2 = Ma | first2 = Ben | last3 = Wu | first3 = Judy I-Chia | last4 = von Ragué | first4 = Schleyer |last5 = Mo | first5 = Yirong | year = 2009 | title = Is Cyclopropane Really the σ-Aromatic Paradigm? | url = | journal = Chemistry: A European Journal | volume = 15 | issue = 38| pages = 9730–9736 | doi = 10.1002/chem.200900586 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synthesis==
Cyclopropane was first produced via a [[Wurtz coupling]], in which  [[1,3-dibromopropane]] was [[cyclisation|cyclised]] using sodium.&lt;ref name=Freund81/&gt; The yield of this reaction can be improved by exchanging the metal for [[zinc]].&lt;ref name=Gustavson/&gt;

:BrCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br  +  2 Na  →  (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 NaBr

===Cyclopropanation===
{{main|Cyclopropanation}}
Cyclopropane rings are found in numerous [[biomolecule]]s (e.g., [[pyrethrin]]s, a group of natural insecticides) and [[pharmaceutical drug]]s. As such the formation of cyclopropane rings, generally referred to as [[cyclopropanation]], is an active area of chemical research.

==Reactions==
Owing to the increased π-character of its C-C bonds, cyclopropane can react like an alkene in certain cases. For instance it undergoes [[hydrohalogenation]] with [[mineral acid]]s to give linear alkyl halides. Substituted cyclopropanes also react, following [[Markovnikov's rule]].&lt;ref&gt;Advanced organic Chemistry, Reactions, mechanisms and structure 3ed. Jerry March {{ISBN|0-471-85472-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Substituted cyclopropanes can [[Oxidative Addition|oxidatively add]] to [[transition metals]], in a process referred to as [[Cyclopropane carbon-carbon bond activation|C–C activation]].

==Safety==
Cyclopropane is highly flammable. However, despite its strain energy it is not substantially more explosive than [[Flammability limit#Examples|other alkanes]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9182">The '''Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool''' (EPEAT) is a method for purchasers (governments, institutions, consumers, etc.) to evaluate the effect of a product on the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. It assesses various lifecycle environmental aspects of a device and ranks products as Gold, Silver or Bronze based on a set of environmental performance criteria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegreenitreview.com/2010/12/epeat-announces-collaboration-with.html EPEAT announces collaboration with international standards and testing organizations | The Green IT Review&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
EPEAT is managed by the [[Green Electronics Council]], a non-profit organization founded in 2005 to inspire and catalyze environmental leadership throughout the lifecycle of electronic technologies.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = About - Green Electronics Council|url = http://greenelectronicscouncil.org/about/|website = Green Electronics Council|access-date = 2016-02-11|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the system, device manufacturers self-declare which environmental criteria their products meet, with those declarations overseen by a network of Conformity Assurance Bodies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CAB Network - Green Electronics Council|url = http://greenelectronicscouncil.org/programs/cab-network/|website = Green Electronics Council|access-date = 2016-02-11|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; that help manufacturers demonstrate that their products meet the [[IEEE 1680]] family of ‘green electronics’ standards. Products are rated Bronze, Silver or Gold depending upon the number of criteria the devices meet. Bronze-rated products meet all the required criteria in each EPEAT product category. Silver-rated products meet all the required criteria plus at least 50% of the optional criteria. Gold-rated products meet all the required criteria plus at least 75% of the optional criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = FAQs - EPEAT|url = http://www.epeat.net/about-epeat/faqs/|website = EPEAT|access-date = 2016-02-11|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The system launched in 2006 with 60 products from three different PC and Display (monitor) manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = History - EPEAT|url = http://www.epeat.net/about-epeat/history/|website = EPEAT|access-date = 2016-02-11|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PC category includes 52 different environmental criteria - 23 required and 28 optional&amp;nbsp;— that measure a product's efficiency and environmental attributes. In 2013, two additional categories made their EPEAT debut: Imaging Equipment in February&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = EPEAT Worldwide Green Rating System Now Available for Printers, Copiers, Scanners - Green Electronics Council|url = http://greenelectronicscouncil.org/epeat-worldwide-green-rating-system-now-available-for-printers-copiers-scanners/|website = Green Electronics Council|access-date = 2016-02-11|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Televisions in April.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = HDTVs Meet Environmental Standards, Make EPEAT Debut - Green Electronics Council|url = http://greenelectronicscouncil.org/hdtvs-meet-environmental-standards-make-epeat-debut/|website = Green Electronics Council|access-date = 2016-02-11|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 24, 2007, President [[George W. Bush]] issued Executive Order 13423, which required all United States Federal agencies to use EPEAT when purchasing computer systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.epeat.net/Docs/Bush%20Requires%20EPEAT%20(1-24-07).pdf |title=President Bush Requires Federal Agencies to Buy EPEAT Registered Green Electronic Products |publisher=Green Electronics Council |date=2007-01-24 |accessdate=2007-09-20 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qCuJd6am?url=http://www.epeat.net/Docs/Bush%20Requires%20EPEAT%20%281-24-07%29.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/01/20070124-2.html |title=Executive Order: Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy, and Transportation Management |publisher=The White House: Office of the Press Secretary |date=2007-01-24 |accessdate=2007-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This commitment was renewed on October 5, 2009 by President Obama's Executive Order 13514.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-08/documents/epeatproducts.pdf |archive-url=https://swap.stanford.edu/20151014163903/http%3A//www2.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015%2D08/documents/epeatproducts.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-10-14 |title=Guidance on Purchasing EPEAT Registered Products (PDF) |date= |access-date= |website= |publisher= |last= |first= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) were subsequently adjusted to require all federal agencies to purchase 'at least 95 percent' of their electronics based on EPEAT status if an appropriate EPEAT category exists for those devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.acquisition.gov/far/html/Subpart%2023_7.html|title = Subpart 23.7—Contracting for Environmentally Preferable Products and Services|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The FAR was updated in 2015 to reflect EPEAT's addition of the Imaging Equipment and Television categories.

In January 2010, [[Amazon.com]] began using EPEAT to identify greener electronic products on its website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegreenitreview.com/2010/01/amazoncom-is-using-epeat-labelling.html Amazon.com is using EPEAT labelling | The Green IT Review&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple international organizations provide EPEAT-registration services for manufacturers in North America, Europe, Asia, South America and Australia. These organizations, called Conformity Assurance Bodies, include [[Green Electronics Council's Conformity Assurance Body]], [[Dekra]], [[UL (safety organization)|UL Environment]], [[Intertek]], [[TÜV Rheinland|TuV Rheinland]], [[China Quality Certification Center|CQC]], [[China Electronics Standardization Institute|CESI]] and [[Verband der Elektrotechnik, Elektronik und Informationstechnik|VDE]]. Each company has Auditors qualified to evaluate the conformance claims of electronics manufacturers and suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epeat.net/participants/conformity-assurance-bodies/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[&lt;!-- http://www.dekra.com/epeat --&gt;http://www.dekra.de/en/green-electronics Sustainable Products&amp;nbsp;– Green Electronics], Dekra, [http://epeat.net/documents/newsdocs/2011/DEKRA_FINAL.pdf DEKRA and EPEAT: Working together for green electronic products]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, the EPEAT system expanded to support product registrations in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = EPEAT® Environmental Rating System Debuts in India - Green Electronics Council|url = http://greenelectronicscouncil.org/epeat-environmental-rating-system-debuts-india/|website = Green Electronics Council|access-date = 2016-02-11|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the addition of India, EPEAT was available in 43 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Global Reach - EPEAT|url = http://www.epeat.net/about-epeat/global-reach/|website = EPEAT|access-date = 2016-02-11|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Apple's Retina MacBook Pro controversy ==

In 2012, Apple's Retina MacBook Pro debuted on EPEAT with a Gold rating after briefly deciding to remove all of its products from EPEAT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://9to5mac.com/2012/07/07/apples-new-designs-force-it-to-abandon-epeat-green-standard-potentially-cutting-off-big-customers/ | title=Apple's new designs force it to abandon EPEAT Green standard, potentially cutting off big customers | publisher=9to5mac.com | date=July 7, 2012 | accessdate=October 21, 2012 | author=Seth Weintraub}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The laptop was accepted following a number of "clarifications" of the standard, for example specifying that the presence of USB ports was now considered sufficient to meet the upgradability requirement, and that tools to disassemble the laptop need only be available for purchase by the public.&lt;ref  name="EPEAT_Clarification14-5"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.epeat.net/documents/clarifications/clarification14-5.pdf | author=EPEAT | title=Clarification 14-5 Regarding 4.4.2.1 – upgradeable with common tools | accessdate=November 27, 2016}} [http://www.epeat.net/resources/clarifications-and-interpretations/ EPEAT&gt;Resources&gt;Clarifications and Interpretations]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Oil production ==
{{See also|Oil reserves in Iraq}}
[[File:OilProduction.Iraq1990-2015.png|thumb|300px|Iraqi oil production has surged after years of disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.gov/beta/international/analysis.cfm?iso=IRQ |title=Country Analysis Brief: Iraq |work=US Energy Information Administration |date=28 April 2016 |accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In 2008, Iraq was the 9th highest crude oil exporter with 88 Mt.&lt;ref&gt;IEA Key statistics 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Oil provided 85% of government income. Iraq's oil reserves were the third biggest in the world, after Saudi Arabia and Iran. In 2009 the Iraq government set a target to increase oil production from {{convert|2.5|Moilbbl|m3|adj=on}} to {{convert|7|Moilbbl/d|m3/d|adj=on}} in six years. In June 2009 oil production rights in the [[Rumaila oil field]] were sold to [[BP]] and [[China National Petroleum]]&lt;ref name=yle122009&gt;[http://www.yle.fi/uutiset/Irak%20huutokauppasi%20seitsemän%20öljykenttää%20%20Ulkomaat%20%20YLE%20Uutiset%20%20yle_fi.htm Irak huutokauppasi seitsemän öljykenttää] yle 12.12.2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yleb2009&gt;[http://www.yle.fi/uutiset//ulkomaat/2009/12/irak_huutokauppaa_oljykenttia_1264652.html Irak huutokauppaa öljykenttiä] yle 11.12.2009&lt;/ref&gt; for 20 years contracts. Investments are estimated as $10–20 billion. Field reserves are {{convert|16.998|Goilbbl|m3}}. In October 2009 Rumaila’s capacity was {{convert|1.1|Moilbbl/d|m3/d}}. Iraq's total oil production was {{convert|2.4|Moilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/iraq-oil-idUSL820863520091008 |title=Iraq signs deal with BP, CNPC for Rumaila field |agency=[[Reuters]] |first=Ahmed |last=Rasheed |date=8 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second auction took place in December 2009, and Iraq sold rights to seven oil fields for 20 years, increasing oil production {{convert|4.7|Moilbbl/d|m3/d}} in future. The production companies will receive between $1 and $5.5 per barrel produced:&lt;ref name="yle122009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yleb2009"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6704">In [[fluid mechanics]], '''fluid flow through porous media''' is the manner in which fluids behave when flowing through a [[porous medium]], for example sponge or wood, or when [[filtration|filtering]] water using sand or another porous material. As commonly observed, some fluid flows through the media while some mass of the fluid is stored in the pores present in the media.

The basic law governing the flow of fluids through porous media is [[Darcy's Law]], which was formulated by the French civil engineer [[Henry Darcy]] in 1856 on the basis of his experiments on vertical water [[filtration]] through sand beds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01036523 | doi=10.1007/BF01036523 | volume=1 | title=Flow in porous media I: A theoretical derivation of Darcy''s law | journal=Transport in Porous Media | pages=3–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

For transient processes in which the flux varies from point to-point, the following differential form of [[Darcy’s law]] is used.

{{Equation box 1

|equation=:&lt;math&gt;Q= \frac {-k A}{\mu} \left( \frac{d p}{d x} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding

|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA
}}

Darcy's law is valid for situation where the porous material is already saturated with the fluid. For the calculation of capillary imbibition speed of a liquid to an initially dry medium, [[Washburn's equation|Washburn's]] or [[Bosanquet equation|Bosanquet's]] equations are used.

==Mass conservation==

[[Mass conservation]] of fluid across the porous medium involves the basic principle that mass flux in minus mass flux out equals the increase in amount stored by a medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bear|first1=Jacob|title=Dynamics of fluids in Porous Media|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=fBMeVSZ_3u8C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Mass+conservation+in+porous+media&amp;ots=mfbAuoVLHB&amp;sig=zgPalxreE4Z6Wi-EZTfmPjAy7IY#v=onepage&amp;q=Mass%20conservation%20in%20porous%20media&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that total mass of the fluid is always conserved. In mathematical form, considering a time period from &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; \Delta t &lt;/math&gt;, length of porous medium from &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; \Delta x &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; being the mass stored by the medium, we have

:&lt;math&gt; [A\rho (x)q(x) - A\rho (x + \Delta x)q(x + \Delta x )]\Delta t  = m(t + \Delta t) - m(t) . &lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, we have that &lt;math&gt;m = \rho V_p&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;V_p&lt;/math&gt; is the pore volume of the medium between &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x+\Delta x &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt; is the density. So &lt;math&gt; m = \rho V_p = \rho \phi V = \rho \phi A\Delta x,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; \phi &lt;/math&gt; is the [[porosity]]. Dividing both sides by &lt;math&gt;A\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;, while &lt;math&gt;\Delta x \rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;, we have for 1 dimensional linear flow in a porous medium the relation

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{-d(\rho q)}{d x} = \frac{d(\rho \phi)}{d t} ~~~~ (i) &lt;/math&gt;

In three dimensions, the equation can be written as

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d(\rho q)}{d x} + \frac{d(\rho q)}{d y} + \frac{d(\rho q)}{d z} = \frac{-d(\rho \phi)}{d t} &lt;/math&gt;

The mathematical operation on the left-hand side of this equation is known as the divergence of &lt;math&gt;\rho q&lt;/math&gt;, and represents the rate at which fluid diverges from a given region, per unit volume.

Using product rule(and chain rule) on right hand side of the above mass conservation equation (i),

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d(\rho \phi)}{d t} = \rho \frac{d \phi}{d t} + \phi \frac{d \rho}{d t} = \rho \frac{d \phi}{d P} \frac{d P}{d t} + \phi \frac{d \rho}{d P} \frac{d P}{d t} = \rho \phi \left [\frac{1}{\phi} \frac{d \phi}{d P} + \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{d \rho}{d P} \right] \quad \frac{d P}{d t} = \rho \phi [c_\phi + c_f]\frac{d P}{d t} ~~~~ (ii)&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;c_f&lt;/math&gt; = [[compressibility]] of the fluid and &lt;math&gt; c_\phi &lt;/math&gt; = compressibility of porous medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ohirhian|first1=Peter|title=Steady State Compressible Fluid  Flow in Porous Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now considering the left hand side of the mass conservation equation, which is given by [[Darcy's Law]] as

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{-d(\rho q)}{d x} = \frac{-d}{dx} \left [\frac{- \rho k}{\mu} \frac{d P}{d x} \right] \quad = \frac{k}{\mu} \left [\rho \frac{d^2 P}{d x^2} + \frac{d \rho}{d P} \frac{d P}{d x} \frac{d P}{d x} \right] \quad = \frac{\rho k}{\mu} \left[\frac{d^2 P}{d x^2} + \left (\frac{1}{\rho} \frac{d \rho}{d P}\right)\left(\frac{d P}{d x} \right)^2 \right ] \quad = \frac{\rho k}{\mu} \left [\frac{d^2 P}{d x^2} + c_f \left(\frac{d P}{d x}\right)^2 \right] \quad ~~~~ (iii)&lt;/math&gt;

Equating the results obtained in &lt;math&gt;(ii)&lt;/math&gt; &amp; &lt;math&gt;(iii)&lt;/math&gt;, we get

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d^2 P}{d x^2} + c_f\left(\frac{d P}{d x}\right)^2 = \frac{\phi \mu (c_f + c_\phi)}{k} \frac{d P}{d t} &lt;/math&gt;

The second term on the left side is usually negligible, and we obtain the diffusion equation in 1 dimension as

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d P}{d t} = \frac{k}{\phi \mu c_t} \frac{d^2 P}{d x^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; c_t = c_f + c_\phi &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zimmerman|first1=Dr. R.W.|title=Flow in porous media|website=imperial.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Forward Wind Energy Center''' is a [[wind farm]] in [[Dodge County, Wisconsin|Dodge]] and [[Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin]] near [[Brownsville, Wisconsin]]. The farm is planned to consist of 86 [[General Electric]] 1.5sle [[Wind turbine]]s. There was significant controversy in selection of the location and delays in construction due to its proximity to [[Horicon National Wildlife Refuge]] just to the west of the site and an [[Air Route Surveillance Radar]] to the south as well as other issues.&lt;ref&gt;Fond du Lac Reporter.  [http://www.fdlreporter.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080114/FON0101/801140358/1289/FONnews Wind Energy: Flagship of renewable resources or a pipe dream]. January 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; "Forward" is also the motto of the State of [[Wisconsin]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1271">A '''frasilah''' is a historical [[Units of measurement|weight unit]] that was used in the 19th century on the island of [[Zanzibar]] and in [[eastern Africa]]. A frasilah is equivalent to about {{convert|35|lb}}. This weight unit was used mainly by the Arabs involved in the [[ivory trade]] to weigh the mass of elephant tusks and other goods used in the trade, such as beads, cloth and brass wire. In 1871, a frasilah of ivory could be purchased inland for 20 US$ (around 500 US$ in 2011) in goods and sold in Zanzibar for about 60 US$ (around 1 500 US$ in 2011).

In the case of the conical intersection, the [[adiabatic]] parameters are the [[molecular geometry|molecular coordinates]]. Apart from quantum mechanics, it arises in a variety of other [[wave]] systems, such as classical [[optics]]. As a rule of thumb, it can occur whenever there are at least two parameters characterizing a wave in the vicinity of some sort of singularity or hole in the topology; two parameters are required because either the set of nonsingular states will not be [[simply connected]], or there will be nonzero [[holonomy]].

Waves are characterized by [[amplitude]] and [[Phase (waves)|phase]], and may vary as a function of those parameters. The geometric phase occurs when both parameters are changed simultaneously but very slowly (adiabatically), and eventually brought back to the initial configuration. In quantum mechanics, this could involve rotations but also translations of particles, which are apparently undone at the end. One might expect that the waves in the system return to the initial state, as characterized by the amplitudes and phases (and accounting for the passage of time). However, if the parameter excursions correspond to a loop instead of a self-retracing back-and-forth variation, then it is possible that the initial and final states differ in their phases. This phase difference is the geometric phase, and its occurrence typically indicates that the system's parameter dependence is [[Mathematical singularity|singular]] (its state is undefined) for some combination of parameters.

To [[Measurement|measure]] the geometric phase in a wave system, an [[interference (wave propagation)|interference]] [[experiment]] is required. The [[Foucault pendulum]] is an example from [[classical mechanics]] that is sometimes used to illustrate the geometric phase. This mechanics analogue of the geometric phase is known as the [[Hannay angle]].

==Berry phase in quantum mechanics ==
In a quantum system at the n-th [[eigenstate]], an [[adiabatic]] evolution of the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] sees the system remain in the n-th eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, while also obtaining a phase factor.  The phase obtained has a contribution from the state's time evolution and another from the variation of the eigenstate with the changing Hamiltonian.  The second term corresponds to the Berry phase and for non-cyclical variations of the Hamiltonian it can be made to vanish by a different choice of the phase associated with the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian at each point in the evolution.

However, if the variation is cyclical, the Berry phase cannot be cancelled; it is [[invariant (physics)|invariant]] and becomes an observable property of the system.  By reviewing the proof of the [[adiabatic theorem]] given by [[Max Born]] and [[Vladimir Fock]], in [[European Physical Journal|Zeitschrift für Physik]] '''51''', 165 (1928), we could characterize the whole change of the adiabatic process into a phase term. Under the adiabatic approximation, the coefficient of the nth eigenstate under adiabatic process is given by

&lt;math&gt;C_n(t)=C_n(0) \exp\left[-\int_0^t\langle\psi_n(t')|\dot \psi_n(t')\rangle dt'\right]=C_n(0) e^{i\gamma_m(t)}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\gamma_m(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the Berry phase with respect of parameter t. Changing the variable t into generalized parameters, we could rewrite the Berry phase into 

: &lt;math&gt;\gamma[C] = i\oint_C \! \langle n,t| \left( \nabla_R |n,t\rangle \right)\,dR \, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; parametrizes the cyclic adiabatic process.  It follows a closed path &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; in the appropriate parameter space.  Geometric phase along the closed path &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; can also be calculated by integrating the [[Berry connection and curvature|Berry curvature]] over surface enclosed by &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;.

== Examples of geometric phases ==

=== The Foucault pendulum ===

One of the easiest examples is the [[Foucault pendulum]]. An easy explanation in terms of geometric phases is given by von Bergmann and von Bergmann:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Foucault pendulum through basic geometry|author1=Jens von Bergmann |author2=HsingChi von Bergmann |journal=Am. J. Phys.|volume=75|year=2007|issue=10|pages=888–892|doi=10.1119/1.2757623|bibcode = 2007AmJPh..75..888V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

: How does the pendulum precess when it is taken around a general path C? For transport along the [[equator]], the pendulum will not precess. [...] Now if C is made up of [[Earth's geodesic|geodesic]] segments, the [[precession]] will all come from the angles where the segments of the geodesics meet; the total precession is equal to the net [[spherical excess|deficit angle]] which in turn equals the [[solid angle]] enclosed by C modulo 2π. Finally, we can approximate any loop by a sequence of geodesic segments, so the most general result (on or off the surface of the sphere) is that the net precession is equal to the enclosed solid angle.

To put it in different words, there are no inertial forces that could make the pendulum precess, so the precession (relative to the direction of motion of the path along which the pendulum is carried) is entirely due to the turning of this path. Thus the orientation of the pendulum undergoes [[parallel transport]]. For the original Foucault pendulum, the path is a circle of latitude, and by the [[Gauss–Bonnet theorem]], the phase shift is given by the enclosed solid angle.

=== Polarized light in an optical fiber ===

A second example is linearly polarized light entering a [[single-mode optical fiber]]. Suppose the fiber traces out some path in space and the light exits the fiber in the same direction as it entered. Then compare the initial and final polarizations. In semiclassical approximation the fiber functions as a [[waveguide]] and the momentum of the light is at all times tangent to the fiber. The polarization can be thought of as an orientation perpendicular to the momentum. As the fiber traces out its path, the momentum vector of the light traces out a path on the sphere in [[momentum space]]. The path is closed since initial and final directions of the light coincide, and the polarization is a vector tangent to the sphere. Going to momentum space is equivalent to taking the [[Gauss map]]. There are no forces that could make the polarization turn, just the constraint to remain tangent to the sphere. Thus the polarization undergoes [[parallel transport]] and the phase shift is given by the enclosed solid angle (times the spin, which in case of light is 1).

=== Stochastic pump effect ===

A stochastic pump is a classical stochastic system that responds with nonzero, on average, currents to periodic changes of parameters.
The stochastic pump effect can be interpreted in terms of a geometric phase in evolution of the moment generating function of stochastic currents.&lt;ref name="sinitsyn-07epl"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Berry phase and the pump flux in stochastic chemical kinetics|author1=N. A. Sinitsyn |author2=I. Nemenman |journal=Europhysics Letters|volume=77|issue=5|year=2007|pages=58001|arxiv=q-bio/0612018|doi=10.1209/0295-5075/77/58001|bibcode = 2007EL.....7758001S }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- N.A. Sinitsyn 2007 EPL ''77''' 58001 --&gt;

=== Spin ½ ===

The geometric phase can be evaluated exactly for a spin-½ particle in a magnetic field.&lt;ref name=Solem1993/&gt;

=== Geometric phase defined on attractors ===

While Berry's formulation was originally defined for linear Hamiltonian systems, it was soon realized by Ning and Haken
&lt;ref name="Ning-Haken92"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Geometrical phase and amplitude accumulations in dissipative systems with cyclic attractors|author=C.Z.Ning and H. Haken|journal=Phys. Rev. Lett.|volume=68|year=1992|issue=14|pages=2109–2122|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.68.2109|bibcode = 1992PhRvL..68.2109N|pmid=10045311}}&lt;/ref&gt; that similar geometric phase can be defined for entirely different systems such as nonlinear dissipative systems that possess certain cyclic attractors. They showed that such cyclic attractors exist in a class of nonlinear dissipative systems with certain symmetries.&lt;ref name="Ning-HakenMPL"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The geometric phase in nonlinear dissipative systems|author=C.Z.Ning and H. Haken|journal=Mod. Phys. Lett.B|volume=6|year=1992|issue=25|pages=1541–1568|doi=10.1142/S0217984992001265|bibcode = 1992MPLB....6.1541N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exposure in molecular adiabatic potential surface intersections ===

There are several ways to compute the geometric phase in molecules within the Born Oppenheimer framework. One way is through the "non-adiabatic coupling &lt;math&gt;M\times M&lt;/math&gt; matrix" defined by

&lt;math&gt;\tau _{ij}^{\mu }=\left\langle  \psi _{i} | \partial ^{\mu }\psi _{j} \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\psi _{i}&lt;/math&gt; is the adiabatic electronic wave function, depending on the nuclear parameters &lt;math&gt;R_{\mu }&lt;/math&gt;. The nonadiabatic coupling can be used to define a loop integral, analogous to a [[Wilson loop]] (1974) in field theory, developed independently for molecular framework by M. Baer (1975, 1980, 2000). Given a closed loop &lt;math&gt;\Gamma &lt;/math&gt;, parameterized by  &lt;math&gt;R_{\mu }\left( t \right)&lt;/math&gt; where  &lt;math&gt;t\in \left[0,1 \right]&lt;/math&gt; is a parameter and &lt;math&gt;R_{\mu }\left( t+1 \right)=R_{\mu }\left( t \right)&lt;/math&gt;. The D-matrix is given by:

&lt;math&gt;D\left[\Gamma  \right]=\hat{P}e^{\oint_{\Gamma }{\tau ^{\mu }dR_{\mu }}}&lt;/math&gt;

(here, &lt;math&gt;{\hat{P}}&lt;/math&gt; is a path ordering symbol). It can be shown that once &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is large enough (i.e. a sufficient number of electronic states is considered) this matrix is diagonal with the diagonal elements equal to  &lt;math&gt;e^{i\beta _{j}}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\beta _{j}&lt;/math&gt; are the geometric phases associated with the loop for the &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; adiabatic electronic state.

For time-reversal symmetrical electronic Hamiltonians the geometric phase reflects the number of conical intersections encircled by the loop. More accurately:

&lt;math&gt;e^{i\beta _{j}}=\left( -1 \right)^{N_{j}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;N_{j}&lt;/math&gt; is the number of conical intersections involving the adiabatic state &lt;math&gt;\psi _{j}&lt;/math&gt; encircled by the loop &lt;math&gt;\Gamma &lt;/math&gt;.

An alternative to the D-matrix approach would be a direct calculation of the Pancharatnam phase. This is especially useful if one is interested only in the geometric phases of a single adiabatic state. In this approach, one takes a  number &lt;math&gt;N+1&lt;/math&gt; of points &lt;math&gt;\left( n=0,...,N \right)&lt;/math&gt; along the loop &lt;math&gt;R\left( t_{n} \right)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;t_{0}=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t_{N}=1&lt;/math&gt; then using only the jth adiabatic states &lt;math&gt;\psi _{j}\left[R\left( t_{n} \right) \right]&lt;/math&gt; computes the Pancharatnam product of overlaps:

&lt;math&gt;I_{j}\left( \Gamma ,N \right)=\prod\limits_{n=0}^{N-1}{\left\langle  \psi _{j}\left[R\left( t_{n} \right) \right] | \psi _{j}\left[R\left( t_{n+1} \right) \right] \right\rangle }&lt;/math&gt;

In the limit &lt;math&gt;N\to \infty &lt;/math&gt; one has (See Ryb &amp; Baer 2004 for explanation and some applications):

&lt;math&gt;I_{j}\left( \Gamma ,N \right)\to e^{i\beta _{j}}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Geometric phase and quantization of cyclotron motion ===

Electron subjected to magnetic field &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; moves on a circular (cyclotron) orbit.{{ref|plan}} Classically, any cyclotron radius &lt;math&gt;R_c&lt;/math&gt; is acceptable. Quantum-mechanically, only discrete energy levels ([[Landau quantization|Landau levels]]) are allowed and since &lt;math&gt;R_c&lt;/math&gt; is related to electron's energy, this corresponds to quantized values of &lt;math&gt;R_c&lt;/math&gt;. The energy quantization condition obtained by solving Schrödinger's equation reads, for example, &lt;math&gt;E=(n+\alpha)\hbar\omega_c, \alpha=1/2&lt;/math&gt; for free electrons (in vacuum) or &lt;math&gt;E=v\sqrt{2(n+\alpha)eB\hbar}, \alpha=0&lt;/math&gt; for electrons in graphene where &lt;math&gt;n=0,1,2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt;.{{ref|cyclo}}  Although the derivation of these results is not difficult, there is an alternative way of deriving them which offers in some respect better physical insight into the Landau level quantization. This alternative way is based on the semiclassical [[Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization|Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition]]

&lt;math&gt;
  \hbar\oint d\mathbf{r}\cdot \mathbf{k} - e\oint d\mathbf{r}\cdot\mathbf{A} + \hbar\gamma = 2\pi\hbar(n+1/2)
&lt;/math&gt;

which includes the geometric phase &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; picked up by the electron while it executes its (real-space) motion along the closed loop of the cyclotron orbit.&lt;ref&gt;For a tutorial, see Jiamin Xue: "[https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.6714 Berry phase and the unconventional quantum Hall effect in graphene]" (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; For free electrons, &lt;math&gt;\gamma=0&lt;/math&gt; while &lt;math&gt;\gamma=\pi&lt;/math&gt; for electrons in graphene. It turns out that the geometric phase is directly linked to &lt;math&gt;\alpha=1/2&lt;/math&gt; of free electrons and &lt;math&gt;\alpha=0&lt;/math&gt; of electrons in graphene.

'''Güssing''' ({{lang-hu|Németújvár, Német-Újvár}}, {{lang-hr|Novi Grad}}) is a town in [[Burgenland]], [[Austria]]. It is located at {{coord|47|4|N|16|19|E|region:AT_type:city(3,902)}}, with a population of 3,811 (2011), and is the administrative center of the [[Güssing (district)|Güssing]] district.

==History==

===Overview===
The [[Burg Güssing|Güssing Castle]], built in 1157, is the oldest castle in Burgenland and a regional landmark.

The lords of Güssing (in Hungarian: ''Kőszeg'', in Slovak: ''Kysak'') were a noble family in the frontier region of [[Austria]] and the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. Note that [[Kőszeg]] is the name of a nearby [[Hungary|Hungarian]] town (known as ''Güns'' in [[German language|German]]) to which that family moved its residence from Güssing in 1274.
In 1522, it became the residence of the [[Batthyány]] family, one of the most distinguished [[Magnate]] families in Hungary.

Güssing, a major town in south Burgenland, a district comprising around 27,000 inhabitants, is the first community in the European Union to produce its whole energy demand – electricity, heating/cooling, fuels – out of renewable resources, all resources from within the region.
However, to appreciate the enormity of this achievement, you need to rewind and go back to 1988 when Güssing was one of the poorest regions in Austria. 
Then, the community relied on agriculture, with farmers selling corn, sunflower oil and timber to make a living. While in terms of tourism, the main attraction was a 12th-century castle built by Hungarian nobles.
On account of the geographically unfavourable location near the border, major trade or industrial businesses did not exist at that time and the whole district did not have any transportation infrastructure at all (neither railroad nor highway). This resulted in a scarcity of jobs, 70% weekly commuters to Vienna and a high rate of migration to other regions. At the time, the town was said to be hardly able to afford its annual €6 million (£4.7million) fuel bill.
To change this situation the “reformers” realised that substantial capital outflow from the region is due to the town's energy being bought from outside sources. This included oil, power and fuels, while existing resources e.g. 45% forest land, remained largely unused.
Thus the “reformers” proposed to abandon fossile energy and start producing and subsequently selling energy to the citizens (customers) themselves. So they wanted to keep that € 6 Million (value for 1992, based on conventional energy prices of that year) in the city.

In the early 1990s, a policy was proposed which called for a complete abandonment of fossil-fuel-based energy. The objective was to supply, in a first step, the town of Güssing and subsequently the whole district with regionally available renewable energy sources.
The election of the town's current mayor, Peter Vadasz, in 1992 accelerated the process, particularly when he appointed Reinhard Koch, an electrical engineer and native of Güssing, to assess how the town could benefit from its natural resources, i.e. forest land. Koch was "fresh" out of university and was not willing to share the destiny of many local commuters to Vienna.
The first step taken was to order that all public buildings in the town should stop using fossil fuels.

As result of the energetic optimisation of buildings in the town, expenditure on energy was reduced by almost 50%. Then a wood burning plant that provided heating for 27 houses was built. Then, a facility was constructed which turned rapeseed into car fuel.
In 1998, Koch and Vadasz saw a presentation by a Viennese scientist, Hermann Hofbauer, about a technology he had developed to make an alternative fuel from wood.
They asked Hofbauer and Vienna's Technical University to build a pilot project in Güssing applying the technology, where wood chips are gasified under high temperature conditions. Gas fuels a Jenbacher engine that produces electricity and the “by-product” heat is used to produce warm water for the district heating system. Plant efficiency about 82-85%. Research and development went further on, so Güssing hosts today a number of innovative technologies, solutions, and patents. Today there is a team of highly trained technicians and scientists working in Güssing.

The renewable-energy project expanded to the region and there are 27 decentralized power plants within the Güssing county. Güssing today has an “energy” turnover of about € 14 Million p.a. Part of the profit is invested back into renewable energy projects.

What effect has this had on the region? A special scheme (very easy – stable energy prices, not linked to oil &amp; gas, guaranteed long-term, 10–15 years) promoting the establishment of enterprises in the area has brought 50 new enterprises with more than 1,000 direct and indirect jobs in the city. (these 1000 jobs are in the City, region not calculated). Güssing has since developed into an important location for industries with high energy consumption, such as parquetry production or hardwood drying. The real highlight is the Blue Chip Energy, first high-efficiency solar cell production in Austria, a joint venture with Solon AG, who came to Güssing only because they can power the plant with clean energy from the renewable resources.

The town is conscious about the resources and is keen to take care and look after the surrounding forest to ensure they have a good supply of renewable energy for the future. Added to which, the town is currently using less than half of its yearly wood growth supply to feed its power plants. Thus, no cutting the substance.

Within the process of becoming energy autonomous city, a number of proprietary technologies and patents developed, to be applied in different fields, such as photovoltaic, biomass, etc. Also, extensive experience in analysis, preparation and implementation of such projects was accumulated, that experience to be given to other cities and communities willing to go the same renewable way.

Güssing today enjoys truly international popularity. Thus, ECRE Güssing International AG was established as the central company to expose Güssing internationally (www.ecreag.com).

Significant power plants include a 2 MW electric power 4.5 MW thermic [[wood gas generator]] power plant in Güssing and, in nearby [[Strem]], a 0.5 MW electric power 0.5 MW thermic [[biomass gasification]] power plant using green silage re-growing raw materials like grass, clover, mains, sunflower.

As side effect, extra income is being brought into the town through eco-tourism. Visitors flock from around the world to gain inspiration from the town and keen to stay true to their eco-friendly roots, guests can stay in hotels that are heated and electrically powered all by renewables. Some 30,000 visitors were recorded during 2007.

'''Headphones''' (or '''head-phones''' in the early days of telephony and radio) are a pair of small loudspeaker drivers worn on or around the head over a user's ears. They are [[electroacoustics (acoustical engineering)|electroacoustic]] [[transducer]]s, which convert an [[electrical signal]] to a corresponding [[sound]]. Headphones let a single user listen to an audio source privately, in contrast to a [[loudspeaker]], which emits sound into the open air for anyone nearby to hear.   Headphones are also known as '''earspeakers, earphones'''&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/earphone |title=earphone |accessdate=4 January 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140119123425/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/earphone |archivedate=19 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or, [[colloquially]], '''cans'''.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley R. Alten ''Audio Basics'' Cengage 2011 {{ISBN|0-495-91356-1}} page&amp;nbsp;63&lt;/ref&gt; Circumaural ('around the ear') and supra-aural ('over the ear') headphones use a band over the top of the head to hold the speakers in place.  The other type, known as '''earbuds''' or '''earpieces'''&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; consist of individual units that plug into the user's ear canal.  In the context of [[telecommunication]], a [[Headset (audio)|headset]] is a combination of headphone and [[microphone]]. Headphones connect to a signal source such as an audio [[amplifier]], [[radio]], [[CD player]], [[portable media player]], [[mobile phone]], [[video game console]], or [[electronic musical instrument]], either directly using a cord, or using [[wireless]] technology such as [[Bluetooth]], [[DECT]] or [[FM radio]].  The first headphones were developed in the late 19th century for use by [[Switchboard operator|telephone operators]], to keep their hands free. Initially the audio quality was mediocre and a step forward was the invention of [[Hi fi|high fidelity]] headphones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stereocompare.com/headphones-buying-guide/#Hi%2520fidelity%2520headphones|title=Headphones : The Ultimate buying guide - Hi-fidelity headphones|website=StereoCompare|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-03|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307135117/http://www.stereocompare.com/headphones-buying-guide/#Hi%2520fidelity%2520headphones|archivedate=2016-03-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Headphones are made in a range of different audio reproduction quality capabilities.  Headsets designed for telephone use typically cannot reproduce sound with the [[high fidelity]] of expensive units designed for music listening by [[audiophile]]s.   Headphones that use cables typically have either a 1/4 inch (6.35mm) or 1/8 inch (3.5mm) [[phone connector (audio)|phone jack]] for plugging the headphones into the audio source. Some stereo earbuds are wireless, using [[Bluetooth]] connectivity to transmit the audio signal by radio waves from source devices like cellphones and digital players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3055208/its-true-apple-will-drop-the-headphone-jack-to-make-the-iphone-7-slimmer-and-simpler |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160829052849/http://www.fastcompany.com/3055208/its-true-apple-will-drop-the-headphone-jack-to-make-the-iphone-7-slimmer-and-simpler |archivedate=2016-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Due to the spread of wireless devices in recent years headphones are increasingly used by people in public places such as sidewalks, grocery stores, and public transit.  Headphones are also used by people in various professional contexts, such as [[audio engineer]]s mixing sound for live concerts or [[sound recording]]s and [[DJ]]s, who use headphones to [[cue (audio)|cue]] up the next song without the audience hearing, aircraft pilots and [[call center]] employees. The latter two types of employees use headphones with an integrated microphone.

=={{anchor|history}}History==
[[Image:Brandes Superior Matched Tone c. 1919-21.jpg|thumb|right|Brandes radio headphones, circa 1920]]
Headphones originated from the telephone receiver earpiece, and were the only way to listen to electrical [[audio signal]]s before amplifiers were developed. The first truly successful set was developed in 1910 by [[Nathaniel Baldwin]], who made them by hand in his kitchen and sold them to the [[United States Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112064674325;view=1up;seq=181|title=Howeth: Chapter XI|date=1963|work=|accessdate=5 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://historytogo.utah.gov/salt_lake_tribune/history_matters/070801.html Utah History To Go. ''Ruin Followed Riches for a Utah Genius'' (Will Bagley for the Salt Lake Tribune, July 8, 2001)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911070726/http://www.historytogo.utah.gov/salt_lake_tribune/history_matters/070801.html |date=September 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These early headphones used [[Moving iron speaker|moving iron drivers]],&lt;ref name="hearthis"/&gt; with either single-ended or balanced armatures.  The common single-ended type used voice coils wound around the poles of a permanent magnet, which were positioned close to a flexible steel diaphragm.  The audio current through the coils varied the magnetic field of the magnet, exerting a varying force on the diaphragm, causing it to vibrate, creating sound waves.  The requirement for high sensitivity meant that no damping was used, so the frequency response of the diaphragm had large peaks due to resonance, resulting in poor [[sound quality]]. These early models lacked padding, and were often uncomfortable to wear for long periods. Their [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] varied; headphones used in [[telegraph]] and telephone work had an impedance of 75&amp;nbsp;[[ohm]]s. Those used with early wireless radio had more turns of finer wire to increase sensitivity. Impedance of 1000 to 2000&amp;nbsp;ohms was common, which suited both crystal sets and [[triode]] receivers.  Some very sensitive headphones, such as those manufactured by Brandes around 1919, were commonly used for early radio work.

In early powered radios, the headphone was part of the [[vacuum tube]]'s [[Plate electrode|plate]] circuit and carried dangerous voltages. It was normally connected directly to the positive high voltage battery terminal, and the other battery terminal was securely grounded. The use of bare electrical connections meant that users could be shocked if they touched the bare headphone connections while adjusting an uncomfortable headset.

In 1958, [[John C. Koss]], an [[audiophile]] and [[jazz musician]] from [[Milwaukee]], produced the first stereo headphones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Founded 1958 - World's First SP/3 Stereophone|url=https://www.koss.com/history/|website=koss.com|accessdate=13 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913183148/https://www.koss.com/history/|archivedate=13 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hearthis"&gt;{{cite web|title=Now hear this: the history of headphones|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/oct/30/history-of-headphones|last=Smith|first=Caspar|publisher=The Guardian|date=30 October 2011|accessdate=13 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913182953/https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/oct/30/history-of-headphones|archivedate=13 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, headphones were used only by the US navy, telephone and radio operators, and individuals in similar industries.&lt;ref name="hearthis"/&gt;

Smaller earbud type earpieces, which plugged into the user's ear canal, were first developed for [[hearing aids]]. They became widely used with [[transistor radio]]s, which commercially appeared in 1954 with the introduction of the [[Regency TR-1]]. The most popular audio device in history, the transistor radio changed listening habits, allowing people to listen to radio anywhere.  The earbud uses either a moving iron driver or a [[crystal earpiece|piezoelectric crystal]] to produce sound.  The 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm radio and [[Phone connector (audio)|phone connector]], which is the most commonly used in portable application today, has been used at least since the Sony EFM-117J transistor radio, which was released in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sony history 1960s|url=http://www.sony.net/Fun/design/history/1960.html|website=Sony official website|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205195855/http://www.sony.net/Fun/design/history/1960.html|archivedate=2016-02-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Description of 3.5mm earphone jack in described model: &lt;br&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/vintage-sony-1960-efm-117j-radio-47603127|title=Vintage Sony 1960’S EFM-117J Radio|website=[[WorthPoint]]|accessdate=2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its popularity was reinforced with its use on the [[Walkman]] portable tape player in 1979.

== Applications ==
Headphones may be used with stationary [[Compact disc player|CD]] and [[DVD player]]s, [[home cinema|home theater]], [[personal computer]]s, or portable devices (e.g., [[digital audio player]]/[[MP3 player]], [[mobile phone]]). [[Cordless]] headphones are not connected to their source by a cable. Instead, they receive a [[radio]] or [[infrared]] signal encoded using a radio or infrared transmission link, such as [[frequency modulation|FM]], [[Bluetooth]] or [[Wi-Fi]]. These are powered receiver systems, of which the headphone is only a component. Cordless headphones are used with events such as a [[Silent disco]] or [[Silent Gig]].
[[File:Headphones-Sennheiser-HD555.jpg|thumb|[[Sennheiser]] HD 555 headphones, used in [[Audio Production|audio production]] environments (2007)]]
In the [[professional audio]] sector, headphones are used in live situations by [[disc jockey]]s with a [[DJ mixer]], and [[sound engineer]]s for monitoring signal sources. In radio studios, [[DJ]]s use a pair of headphones when talking to the microphone while the speakers are turned off to eliminate [[acoustic feedback]] while monitoring their own voice. In studio recordings, musicians and singers use headphones to play or sing along to a backing track or band. In military applications, audio signals of many varieties are monitored using headphones.

Wired headphones are attached to an audio source by a cable. The most common connectors are 6.35&amp;nbsp;mm (¼″) and 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm [[Phone connector (audio)|phone connectors]]. The larger 6.35&amp;nbsp;mm connector is more common on fixed location home or professional equipment. The 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm connector remains the most widely used connector for portable application today. Adapters are available for converting between 6.35&amp;nbsp;mm and 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm devices.

== Electrical characteristics ==
[[Electrical characteristics of dynamic loudspeakers]] may be readily applied to headphones, because most headphones are small dynamic loudspeakers.

=== Impedance ===
Headphones are available with low or high [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] (typically measured at 1&amp;nbsp;kHz). Low-impedance headphones are in the range 16 to 32&amp;nbsp;ohms and high-impedance headphones are about 100-600&amp;nbsp;ohms. As the impedance of a pair of headphones increases, more voltage (at a given current) is required to drive it, and the loudness of the headphones for a given voltage decreases. In recent years, impedance of newer headphones has generally decreased to accommodate lower voltages available on battery powered [[CMOS]]-based portable electronics. This has resulted in headphones that can be more efficiently driven by battery-powered electronics. Consequently, newer amplifiers are based on designs with relatively low output impedance.

The impedance of headphones is of concern because of the output limitations of amplifiers. A modern pair of headphones is driven by an amplifier, with lower impedance headphones presenting a larger load. Amplifiers are not ideal; they also have some output impedance that limits the amount of power they can provide. To ensure an even frequency response, adequate [[damping factor]], and undistorted sound, an amplifier should have an output impedance less than 1/8 that of the headphones it is driving (and ideally, as low as possible). If output impedance is large compared to the impedance of the headphones, significantly higher distortion is present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Siau |first=John |title=The "0-Ohm" Headphone Amplifier |url=http://www.benchmarkmedia.com/discuss/sites/default/files/Headphone-Amplifier-Performance-Part-2.pdf |accessdate=26 June 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210012625/http://www.benchmarkmedia.com/discuss/sites/default/files/Headphone-Amplifier-Performance-Part-2.pdf |archivedate=10 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, lower impedance headphones tend to be louder and more efficient, but also demand a more capable amplifier. Higher impedance headphones are more tolerant of amplifier limitations, but produce less volume for a given output level.

Historically, many headphones had relatively high impedance, often over 500&amp;nbsp;ohms so they could operate well with high-impedance [[Valve amplifier#Operation|tube amplifiers]]. In contrast, modern transistor amplifiers can have very low output impedance, enabling lower-impedance headphones. Unfortunately, this means that older audio amplifiers or stereos often produce poor-quality output on some modern, low-impedance headphones. In this case, an external [[headphone amplifier]] may be beneficial.

=== Sensitivity ===
Sensitivity is a measure of how effectively an earpiece converts an incoming electrical signal into an audible sound. It thus indicates how loud the headphones are for a given electrical drive level. It can be measured in [[decibel]]s of [[sound pressure]] level per milli[[watt]] (dB (SPL)/mW) or decibels of sound pressure level per [[volt]] (dB (SPL) / V).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gilmore2.chem.northwestern.edu/tech/dbohn1_tech.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608015203/http://gilmore2.chem.northwestern.edu/tech/dbohn1_tech.htm |archivedate=2011-06-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unfortunately, both definitions are widely used, often interchangeably.  As the output voltage (but not power) of a headphone amplifier is essentially constant for most common headphones, dB/mW is often more useful if converted into dB/V using [[Ohm's law]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{dB (SPL)}/\mathrm{V} = \mathrm{dB (SPL)}/\mathrm{mW} - 10 \cdot \log_{10}{\frac{\mathrm{Impedance}}{1000}}&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, online calculators can be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Headphone Sensitivity &amp; Efficiency Calculator|url=http://www.jensign.com/S4/calc.html|accessdate=22 November 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141115085636/http://www.jensign.com/S4/calc.html|archivedate=15 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once the sensitivity per volt is known, the maximum volume for a pair of headphones can be easily calculated from the maximum amplifier output voltage.  For example, for a headphone with a sensitivity of 100&amp;nbsp;dB (SPL)/V, an amplifier with an output of 1 [[root mean square]] (RMS) [[voltage]] produces a maximum volume of 100&amp;nbsp;dB.

Pairing high sensitivity headphones with power amplifiers can produce dangerously high volumes and damage headphones.  The maximum [[sound pressure]] level is a matter of preference, with some sources recommending no higher than 110 to 120&amp;nbsp;dB.  In contrast, the American [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] recommends an average SPL of no more than 85&amp;nbsp;dB(A) to avoid long-term hearing loss, while the [[European Union]] standard EN 50332-1:2013 recommends that volumes above 85&amp;nbsp;dB(A) include a warning, with an absolute maximum volume (defined using 40–4000&amp;nbsp;Hz noise) of no more than 100&amp;nbsp;dB to avoid accidental hearing damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BS EN 50332 tests for headphones and earphones with portable music players|accessdate=22 November 2014|ref=http://www.isvr.co.uk/labtests/en50332.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using this standard, headphones with sensitivities of 90, 100 and 110&amp;nbsp;dB (SPL)/V should be driven by an amplifier capable of no more than 3.162, 1.0 and 0.3162 RMS volts at maximum volume setting, respectively to reduce the risk of hearing damage.

The sensitivity of headphones is usually between about 80 and 125&amp;nbsp;dB/mW and usually measured at 1&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Understanding Earphone/Headphone Specifications |url=http://shure.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2991/~/understanding-earphone-%2F-headphone-specifications |work=Shure Customer Help |publisher=Shure |accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
Headphone size can affect the balance between fidelity and portability. Generally, headphone form factors can be divided into four separate categories: ''circumaural (over-ear)'', ''supra-aural (on-ear)'', ''earbud'' and ''in-ear''.

=== Circumaural ===
[[Image:Headphones 1.jpg|thumb|Circumaural headphones have large pads that surround the outer ear.]]
'''Circumaural headphones''' (sometimes called '''full size headphones''' or over-ear headphones) have circular or ellipsoid earpads that encompass the ears. Because these headphones completely surround the ear, circumaural headphones can be designed to fully seal against the head to attenuate external noise. Because of their size, circumaural headphones can be heavy and there are some sets that weigh over {{convert|500|g|lb|0}}. Ergonomic headband and earpad design is required to reduce discomfort resulting from weight. These are commonly used by drummers in recording.

=== Supra-aural ===
[[Image:GradoPrestige-HeadphoneArticle.jpg|thumb|A pair of supra-aural (on-ear) headphones]]
'''Supra-aural headphones''' or on-ear headphones have pads that press against the ears, rather than around them. They were commonly bundled with [[personal stereo]]s during the 1980s. This type of headphone generally tends to be smaller and lighter than circumaural headphones, resulting in less attenuation of outside noise. Supra-aural headphones can also lead to discomfort due to the pressure on the ear as compared to circumaural headphones that sit around the ear. Comfort may vary due to the earcup material.

=== Open or closed back ===
Both circumaural and supra-aural headphones can be further differentiated by the type of earcups:

'''Open-back''' headphones have the back of the earcups open. This leaks more sound out of the headphone and also lets more ambient sounds into the headphone, but gives a more natural or speaker-like sound, due to including sounds from the environment.

'''Closed-back''' (or sealed) styles have the back of the earcups closed. They usually block some of the ambient noise. Closed-back headphones usually can produce stronger low frequencies than open-back headphones.

'''Semi-open''' headphones, have a design that can be considered as a compromise between open-back headphones and closed-back headphones. Some{{Who|date=July 2015}} believe the term "semi-open" is purely there for marketing purposes. There is no exact definition for the term semi-open headphone. Where the open-back approach has hardly any measure to block sound at the outer side of the diaphragm and the closed-back approach really has a closed chamber at the outer side of the diaphragm, a semi-open headphone can have a chamber to partially block sound while letting some sound through via openings or vents.

=== Ear-fitting headphones ===

Since the early days of the [[transistor radio]], earphones have commonly been bundled with personal music devices. They are sold at times with foam pads for comfort. (The use of the term ''earbuds'', which has been around since at least 1984, did not hit its peak until after 2001, with the success of Apple's MP3 player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/magazine/who-made-that-earbud.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202030114/https://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/magazine/who-made-that-earbud.html |archivedate=2017-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;)

==== In-ear headphones ====
{{Main article|In-ear monitor}}
[[Image:InEarMonitors.jpg|thumb|upright|In-ear monitors extend into the ear canal, providing isolation from outside noise.]]
In-ear headphones, also known as in-ear monitors (IEMs) or canalphones, are small headphones with similar portability to earbuds that are inserted in the [[ear canal]] itself. IEMs are higher-quality in-ear headphones and are used by [[audio engineer]]s and [[musician]]s as well as audiophiles.

The outer shells of in-ear headphones are made up of a variety of materials, such as plastic, [[aluminum]], ceramic and other metal alloys. Because in-ear headphones engage the ear canal, they can be prone to sliding out, and they block out much environmental noise. Lack of sound from the environment can be a problem when sound is a necessary cue for safety or other reasons, as when walking, driving, or riding near or in vehicular traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Headphones as a Driving Distraction|url=https://www.rospa.com/rospaweb/docs/advice-services/road-safety/drivers/headphones-as-a-driver-distraction.pdf|publisher=The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents|format=pdf|accessdate=14 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915023105/https://www.rospa.com/rospaweb/docs/advice-services/road-safety/drivers/headphones-as-a-driver-distraction.pdf|archivedate=15 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generic or custom-fitting ear canal plugs are made from [[silicone]] rubber, [[elastomer]], or foam. Custom in-ear headphones use castings of the ear canal to create custom-molded plugs that provide added comfort and noise isolation.&lt;ref name="timebuds" /&gt;

==== Mixed fitting pivoting earphones ====

This type combines advantages of earbuds and in-ear headphones – depending on the environment and requirements of the user, they provide passive noise reduction for quality mode (conversation or active music listening) or they give control over the sound environment around user in comfort mode (stand by or background voice/music listening).{{cn|date=August 2017}}

=== Headset ===
{{Main article|Headset (audio)}}
[[File:Plantronics headset.jpg|thumb|left|A typical example of a headset used for [[voice chat]]s]]

A headset is a headphone combined with a [[microphone]]. Headsets provide the equivalent functionality of a telephone handset with hands-free operation. Among applications for headsets, besides telephone use, are aviation, theatre or television studio intercom systems, and console or PC gaming. Headsets are made with either a single-earpiece (mono) or a double-earpiece (mono to both ears or stereo). The microphone arm of headsets is either an external microphone type where the microphone is held in front of the user's mouth, or a voicetube type where the microphone is housed in the earpiece and speech reaches it by means of a hollow tube.

==== Telephone headsets ====
[[File:Se bluetooth headset.jpg|thumb|[[Sony Ericsson]] Cordless bluetooth headset]]
Telephone headsets connect to a [[fixed-line]] telephone system. A telephone headset functions by replacing the [[handset]] of a telephone. Headsets for standard corded telephones are fitted with a standard [[4P4C]] commonly called an RJ-9 connector. Headsets are also available with 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm jack sockets for many DECT phones and other applications. Cordless [[bluetooth]] headsets are available, and often used with [[mobile telephone]]s. Headsets are widely used for telephone-intensive jobs, in particular by [[call centre]] workers. They are also used by anyone wishing to hold telephone conversations with both hands free.

For older models of telephones, the headset microphone [[electrical impedance|impedance]] is different from that of the original handset, requiring a telephone amplifier for the telephone headset. A telephone amplifier provides basic pin-alignment similar to a telephone headset adaptor, but it also offers sound [[amplifier|amplification]] for the microphone as well as the loudspeakers. Most models of telephone amplifiers offer volume control for loudspeaker as well as microphone, mute function and switching between headset and handset. Telephone amplifiers are powered by batteries or [[AC adaptor]]s.

== Ambient noise reduction ==
[[File:In-ears-earphones.png|thumb|left|In-ears are among those good for noise isolation]]

Unwanted sound from the environment can be reduced by excluding sound from the ear by passive noise isolation, or, often in conjunction with isolation, by active [[Noise-cancelling headphones|noise cancellation]].

Passive noise isolation is essentially using the body of the earphone, either over or in the ear, as a passive earplug that simply blocks out sound. The headphone types that provide most attenuation are in-ear canal headphones and closed-back headphones, both circumaural and supra aural. Open-back and earbud headphones provide some passive noise isolation, but much less than the others. Typical closed-back headphones block 8 to 12&amp;nbsp;dB, and in-ears anywhere from 10 to 15&amp;nbsp;dB. Some models have been specifically designed for drummers to facilitate the drummer monitoring the recorded sound while reducing sound directly from the drums as much as possible. Such headphones claim to reduce ambient noise by around 25&amp;nbsp;dB.

Active noise-cancelling headphones use a microphone, amplifier, and speaker to pick up, amplify, and play ambient noise in phase-reversed form; this to some extent cancels out unwanted noise from the environment without affecting the desired sound source, which is not picked up and reversed by the microphone. They require a power source, usually a battery, to drive their circuitry. Active noise cancelling headphones can attenuate ambient noise by 20&amp;nbsp;dB or more, but the active circuitry is mainly effective on constant sounds and at lower frequencies, rather than sharp sounds and voices. Some noise cancelling headphones are designed mainly to reduce low-frequency engine and travel noise in aircraft, trains, and automobiles, and are less effective in environments with other types of noise.

== Transducer technology ==
Headphones use various types of [[transducer]] to convert electrical signals to sound.

=== Moving-coil ===
[[Image:Headphone-transducer.jpg|thumb|right|A typical moving-coil headphone transducer]]
The [[Loudspeaker|moving coil driver]], more commonly referred to as a "dynamic" driver is the most common type used in headphones.  It consists of a stationary [[magnet]] element affixed to the frame of the headphone, which sets up a static magnetic field. The magnet in headphones is typically composed of [[Ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]] or [[Neodymium magnet|neodymium]].  A [[voice coil]], a light coil of wire, is suspended in the magnetic field of the magnet, attached to a diaphragm, typically fabricated from lightweight, high-stiffness-to-mass-ratio cellulose, polymer, carbon material, paper or the like.   When the varying current of an [[audio signal]] is passed through the coil, it creates a varying magnetic field that reacts against the static magnetic field, exerting a varying force on the coil causing it and the attached diaphragm to vibrate. The vibrating diaphragm pushes on the air to produce [[sound wave]]s.

=== Electrostatic ===
[[Image:Es spk.gif|thumb|right|Electrostatic loudspeaker diagram]]
Electrostatic drivers consist of a thin, electrically charged diaphragm, typically a coated [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|PET film]] membrane, suspended between two perforated metal plates (electrodes). The electrical sound signal is applied to the electrodes creating an electrical field; depending on the polarity of this field, the diaphragm is drawn towards one of the plates. Air is forced through the perforations; combined with a continuously changing electrical signal driving the membrane, a sound wave is generated. Electrostatic headphones are usually more expensive than moving-coil ones, and are comparatively uncommon. In addition, a special amplifier is required to amplify the signal to deflect the membrane, which often requires electrical potentials in the range of 100 to 1000&amp;nbsp;volts.

Due to the extremely thin and light diaphragm membrane, often only a few micrometers thick, and the complete absence of moving metalwork, the frequency response of electrostatic headphones usually extends well above the audible limit of approximately 20&amp;nbsp;kHz. The high frequency response means that the low midband distortion level is maintained to the top of the audible frequency band, which is generally not the case with moving coil drivers. Also, the frequency response peakiness regularly seen in the high frequency region with moving coil drivers is absent. Well-designed electrostatic headphones can produce significantly better sound quality than other types.{{citation needed|reason=Such broad claims need sources|date=May 2015}}

Electrostatic headphones require a voltage source generating 100&amp;nbsp;V to over 1&amp;nbsp;kV, and are on the user's head. Since the invention of insulators, there's no actual danger. They do not need to deliver significant [[electric current]], which further limits the electrical hazard to the wearer in case of fault.

=== Electret ===
An [[electret]] driver functions along the same electromechanical means as an electrostatic driver. However the electret driver has a permanent charge built into it, whereas electrostatics have the charge applied to the driver by an external generator. Electret and electrostatic headphones are relatively uncommon. Original electrets were also typically cheaper and lower in technical capability and fidelity than electrostatics. Patent applications from 2009-2013 have been approved that show by using different materials, i.e. a "Fluorinated cyclic olefin electret film", Frequency response chart readings can reach 50&amp;nbsp;kHz  at 100db. When these new improved electrets are combined with a traditional dome headphone driver, headphones can be produced that are recognised by the Japan Audio Society as worthy of joining the Hi Res Audio program. US patents 8,559,660 B2. 7,732,547 B2.7,879,446 B2.7,498,699 B2.

===Orthodynamic===

Orthodynamic (also known as Planar Magnetic) headphones use similar technology to electrostatic headphones, with some fundamental differences. They operate similarly to [[Loudspeaker#Ribbon and planar magnetic loudspeakers|Planar Magnetic Loudspeakers]].

An orthodynamic driver consists of a relatively large membrane that contains an embedded wire pattern. This membrane is suspended between two sets of permanent, oppositely aligned, magnets.
A current passed through the wires embedded in the membrane produces a magnetic field that reacts with the field of the permanent magnets to induce movement in the membrane, which produces sound.

=== Balanced armature ===
[[Image:Bal Arm.JPG|thumb|left|Balanced armature transducer with armature balanced and exerting no force on diaphragm]]

A balanced armature is a sound transducer design primarily intended to increase the electrical efficiency of the element by eliminating the stress on the diaphragm characteristic of many other magnetic transducer systems. As shown schematically in the first diagram, it consists of a moving magnetic armature that is pivoted so it can move in the field of the permanent magnet. When precisely centered in the magnetic field there is no net force on the armature, hence the term 'balanced.' As illustrated in the second diagram, when there is [[electric current]] through the coil, it [[Electromagnet|magnetizes]] the armature one way or the other, causing it to rotate slightly one way or the other about the pivot thus moving the [[Diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]] to make [[sound]].

[[Image:JH16 Balanced Armatures.jpg|upright|thumb|A custom in-ear monitor which uses 8 balanced armatures in a triple crossover configuration (4 low/2 mid/2 high). Headphone designs often use multiple balanced armatures to provide a higher fidelity sound.]]
The design is not mechanically stable; a slight imbalance makes the armature stick to one pole of the magnet. A fairly stiff restoring force is required to hold the armature in the 'balance' position. Although this reduces its efficiency, this design can still produce more sound from less power than any other{{Clarify|date=January 2014|reason=isn't more sound from less power the definition of high efficiency?}}. Popularized in the 1920s as Baldwin Mica Diaphragm radio headphones, balanced armature transducers were refined during [[World War II]] for use in military [[sound powered telephone]]s. Some of these achieved astonishing electro-acoustic conversion efficiencies, in the range of 20% to 40%, for narrow bandwidth voice signals.

Today they are typically used only in in-ear headphones and hearing aids, where their high efficiency and diminutive size is a major advantage.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
They generally are limited at the extremes of the hearing spectrum (e.g. below 20&amp;nbsp;Hz and above 16&amp;nbsp;kHz) and require a better seal than other types of drivers to deliver their full potential. Higher-end models may employ multiple armature drivers, dividing the frequency ranges between them using a passive crossover network. A few combine an armature driver with a small moving-coil driver for increased bass output.

The earliest loudspeakers for radio receivers used balanced armature drivers for their cones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5IMSAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=earliest+loudspeakers+used+balanced+armature+drivers+for+their+cones.&amp;dq=earliest+loudspeakers+used+balanced+armature+drivers+for+their+cones.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjmp-GsiOTXAhWhwFQKHV8fD80Q6AEILjAB|title=A History of Engineering and Science in the Bell System: The early years (1875-1925)|last=Joel|first=Amos E.|last2=Laboratories|first2=Bell Telephone|last3=Schindler|first3=G. E.|date=1975|publisher=The Laboratories|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thermoacoustic technology ===
The thermoacoustic effect generates sound from the audio frequency Joule heating of the conductor, an effect that is not magnetic and does not vibrate the speaker.
In 2013 a carbon nanotube thin-yarn earphone based on the thermoacoustic mechanism was demonstrated by a research group in Tsinghua University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Yang Wei |author2=Xiaoyang Lin |author3=Kaili Jiang |author4=Peng Liu |author5=Qunqing Li |author6=Shoushan Fan |title=Thermoacoustic Chips with Carbon Nanotube Thin Yarn Arrays. |journal=Nano Letters |year=2013 |doi=10.1021/nl402408j |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/nl402408j |pmid=24041369 |volume=13 |issue=10 |pages=4795–801}}&lt;/ref&gt; The as-produced CNT thin yarn earphone has a working element called CNT thin yarn thermoacoustic chip. Such a chip is composed of a layer of CNT thin yarn array supported by the silicon wafer, and periodic grooves with certain depth are made on the wafer by micro-fabrication methods to suppress the heat leakage from the CNT yarn to the substrate.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

=== Other transducer technologies ===
Transducer technologies employed much less commonly for headphones include the [[Oskar Heil|Heil]] [[Air Motion Transformer]] (AMT); Piezoelectric film; Ribbon planar magnetic; Magnetostriction and [[Plasma speaker|Plasma-ionisation]]. The first [[Air Motion Transformer|Heil AMT]] headphone was marketed by [[ESS Laboratories]] and was essentially an ESS AMT tweeter from one of the company's speakers being driven at full range. Since the turn of the century, only [[Precide]] of Switzerland have manufactured an AMT headphone. Piezoelectric film headphones were first developed by Pioneer, their two models used a flat sheet of film that limited the maximum volume of air movement. Currently, TakeT produces a piezoelectric film headphone shaped similarly to an AMT transducer but, which like the Precide driver, has a variation in the size of transducer folds over the diaphragm. It additionally incorporates a two way design by its inclusion of a dedicated tweeter/supertweeter panel. The folded shape of a diaphragm allows a transducer with a larger surface area to fit within smaller space constraints. This increases the total volume of air that can be moved on each excursion of the transducer given that radiating area.

[[Magnetostriction]] headphones, sometimes sold under the label ''Bonephones'', work by vibrating against the side of head, transmitting sound via [[bone conduction]]. This is particularly helpful in situations where the ears must be unobstructed, or for people who are [[deaf]] for reasons that don't affect the nervous apparatus of [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]]. Magnetostriction headphones though, are limited in their fidelity compared to conventional headphones that rely on the normal workings of the ear. Additionally, in the early 1990s, a French company called Plasmasonics tried to market a plasma-ionisation headphone. There are no known functioning examples left.

== Benefits and limitations ==
[[Image:Sony MDR-V6 headphones.jpg|thumb|Two [[Sony MDR-V6]] headphones, one folded for travel]]
Headphones can prevent other people from hearing the sound, either for [[privacy]] or to prevent disturbing others, as in listening in a public [[library]]. They can also provide a level of sound fidelity greater than loudspeakers of similar cost. Part of their ability to do so comes from the lack of any need to perform room correction treatments with headphones. High-quality headphones can have an extremely flat low-frequency response down to 20&amp;nbsp;Hz within 3&amp;nbsp;dB. While a loudspeaker must use a relatively large (often 15" or 18") [[speaker driver]] to reproduce low frequencies, headphones can accurately reproduce bass and sub-bass frequencies with speaker drivers only 40-50 millimeters wide (or much smaller, as is the case with [[in-ear monitor]] headphones). Headphones' impressive low-frequency performance is possible because they are so much closer to the ear that they only need to move relatively small volumes of air.

Marketed claims such as 'frequency response 4&amp;nbsp;Hz to 20&amp;nbsp;kHz' are usually overstatements; the product's response at frequencies lower than 20&amp;nbsp;Hz is typically very small.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-7612_7-6322607-4.html cnet reviews: Headphone Buying Guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820010315/http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-7612_7-6322607-4.html |date=2011-08-20 }} "Even the flimsiest, cheap headphones routinely boast extremely low bass-response performance—15 or 20Hz—but almost always sound lightweight and bright."&lt;/ref&gt; 
Headphones are also useful for [[video game]]s that use 3D positional audio processing algorithms, as they allow players to better judge the position of an off-screen sound source (such as the footsteps of an opponent or their gun fire).

Although modern headphones have been particularly widely sold and used for listening to [[Stereophonic sound|stereo recordings]] since the release of the [[Walkman]], there is subjective debate regarding the nature of their reproduction of stereo sound. Stereo recordings represent the position of horizontal depth cues (stereo separation) via volume and phase differences of the sound in question between the two channels. When the sounds from two speakers mix, they create the [[phase (waves)|phase]] difference the brain uses to locate direction. Through most headphones, because the right and left channels do not combine in this manner, the illusion of the phantom center can be perceived as lost. Hard [[Panning (audio)|panned]] sounds are also heard only in one ear rather than from one side.

[[Binaural recording]]s use a different microphone technique to encode direction directly as phase, with very little amplitude difference below 2&amp;nbsp;kHz, often using a [[dummy head recording|dummy head]]. They can produce a surprisingly lifelike spatial impression through headphones. Commercial recordings almost always use stereo recording, rather than binaural, because loudspeaker listening is more common than headphone listening.

It is possible to change the spatial effects of stereo sound on headphones, to better approximate the presentation of speaker reproduction, by using frequency-dependent cross-feed between the channels.

Headsets can have [[ergonomic]] benefits over traditional telephone handsets. They allow [[call centre|call center]] agents to maintain better [[human position|posture]] without needing to hand-hold a [[transceiver#Telephony|handset]] or tilt their head sideways to cradle it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/computerworkstations/checklist.html United States Department of Labor.

Using headphones at a sufficiently high [[volume]] level may cause temporary or permanent [[hearing impairment]] or [[deafness]]. The headphone volume often has to compete with the [[background noise]], especially in loud places such as subway stations, aircraft, and large crowds. Extended periods of exposure to high sound pressure levels created by headphones at high volume settings may be damaging;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asha.org/public/hearing/disorders/causes_adults.htm|title=Causes of Hearing Loss in Adults|work=asha.org|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/hearing/noise.asp|title=Noise-Induced Hearing Loss|work=nih.gov|accessdate=21 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509092930/https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/hearing/noise.asp|archivedate=9 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, one hearing expert found that "fewer than 5% of users select volume levels and listen frequently enough to risk hearing loss."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.audiologyonline.com/articles/article_detail.asp?article_id=221|title=Five Myths in Assessing the Effects of Noise on Hearing|author=William W.

[[Koss Corporation|Koss]] introduced the "Safelite" line of cassette players in 1983 with such a warning light. The line was discontinued two years later for lack of interest.

The government of [[France]] has imposed a limit on all music players sold in the country:&lt;ref name="imposed"&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/09/1364&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en Europa.eu. ''Consumers: EU acts to limit health risks from exposure to noise from personal music players '']&lt;/ref&gt; they must not be capable of producing more than 100dBA (the threshold of hearing damage during extended listening is 80&amp;nbsp;dB, and the threshold of pain, or theoretically of immediate hearing loss, is 130&amp;nbsp;dB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lookformedical.com/search.php?lang=1&amp;q=Cochlea&amp;src=faq&amp;from=8 |title=Medical Information Search (Cochlea • FAQ) |publisher=Lookformedical.com |accessdate=2013-09-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212112326/http://www.lookformedical.com/search.php?lang=1&amp;q=Cochlea&amp;src=faq&amp;from=8 |archivedate=2013-12-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Motorcycle and other power-sport riders benefit by wearing foam earplugs when legal to do so to avoid excessive road, engine, and wind noise, but their ability to hear music and [[intercom]] speech is actually enhanced when doing so. The ear can normally detect 1-billionth of an atmosphere of sound pressure level,&lt;ref&gt;A standard [[threshold of hearing]] at 1000&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]] for the human ear is 2 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|Pa]] ({{cite web |last=Marsh |first=Andrew |title=Human Ear and Hearing |url=http://www.kemt.fei.tuke.sk/Predmety/KEMT320_EA/_web/Online_Course_on_Acoustics/hearing.html |work=Online Course on Acoustics |publisher=The School of Architecture and Fine Arts, The University of Western Australia |accessdate=23 August 2010 |year=1999 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100721180215/http://www.kemt.fei.tuke.sk/Predmety/KEMT320_EA/_web/Online_Course_on_Acoustics/hearing.html |archivedate=21 July 2010 |df= }}); Standard [[atmospheric pressure]] is 101,325&amp;nbsp;Pa. 2 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; / 100,000 = 0.2 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;, a ratio of less than a billionth.&lt;/ref&gt; hence it is incredibly sensitive. At very high sound pressure levels, muscles in the ear tighten the tympanic membrane and this leads to a small change in the geometry of the ossicles and stirrup that results in lower transfer of force to the oval window of the inner ear (the [[acoustic reflex]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/Hbase/sound/protect.html#c1|title=The Ear's Protective Mechanisms|work=gsu.edu|accessdate=21 July 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503013758/http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/sound/protect.html#c1|archivedate=3 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The risk of hearing damage also depends on the exposure time. The higher the volume, the faster hearing loss occurs. According to [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] work safety guidelines, workers should be exposed to 90dBA noise for a maximum of 8 hours to avoid hearing loss. An increase to just 95dBA cuts the safe exposure to only 4 hours. But there is little specific consensus on the safe level of exposure. [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|NIOSH]] has an 8-hour recommended exposure limit set to 85dBA. Additionally, an increase to 93dBA instead of 95dBA halves the safe exposure time to 4 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/Publications/laboratory/OSHAfactsheet-laboratory-safety-noise.pdf|title=OSHA Fact Sheet Laboratory Safety Noise|last=|first=|date=|website=OSHA.gov|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829231722/https://www.osha.gov/Publications/laboratory/OSHAfactsheet-laboratory-safety-noise.pdf|archive-date=2017-08-29|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies have found that people are more likely to raise volumes to unsafe levels while performing strenuous exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Can Loud Noise during Exercise Damage my Hearing?|url=http://www.healthyhearing.com/content/faqs/Hearing-loss/Causes/31070-Loud-noise-during-exercise|website=Healthy Hearing|accessdate=8 November 2014|location=Item 4|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109002409/http://www.healthyhearing.com/content/faqs/Hearing-loss/Causes/31070-Loud-noise-during-exercise|archivedate=9 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Finnish study&lt;ref&gt;Airo, Erkko; J. Pekkarinen; P. Olkinuora. "Listening to music with earphones: an assessment of noise exposure," ''Acustica–Acta Acustica'', pp.&amp;nbsp;82, 885–894. (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; recommended that exercisers should set their headphone volumes to half of their normal loudness and only use them for half an hour.

Noise cancelling headphones can be considered dangerous because of a lack of awareness the listener may have with their environment. Noise cancelling headphones are so effective that a person may not be able to hear oncoming traffic or pay attention to people around them. There is also a general danger that music in headphones can distract the listener and lead to dangerous situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/w_DietAndFitnessNews/deaf-danger-perils-earbuds-exercising/story?id=13925714#.UcMJhufVDoI |title=Deaf to Danger: The Perils of Earbuds |last1=Greenfield |first1=Paige |date=25 June 2011 |website=ABC News |accessdate=20 June 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214122323/http://abcnews.go.com/Health/w_DietAndFitnessNews/deaf-danger-perils-earbuds-exercising/story?id=13925714#.UcMJhufVDoI |archivedate=14 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The usual way of limiting sound volume on devices driving headphones is by limiting output power. This has the additional undesirable effect of being dependent of the efficiency of the headphones; a device producing the maximum allowed power may not produce adequate volume when paired with low-efficiency, high-impedance equipment, while the same amount of power can reach dangerous levels with very efficient earphones.

&lt;!--Naming of the storm is mentioned later in the lead, and has its own section in the article--&gt; 
The '''January 2016 United States blizzard''' was a crippling and historic [[blizzard]] that produced up to 3 ft (91 cm) of snow in parts of the [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic]] and [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] United States from January 22 to January 24, 2016. Evolving from a [[shortwave trough]] that formed in the Pacific Northwest on January 19, the system consolidated into a defined [[low-pressure area]] on January&amp;nbsp;21 over [[Texas]]. Regarding it as a "potentially historic blizzard", [[meteorologist]]s indicated the storm could produce more than {{convert|2|ft|cm|abbr=on}} of snow across a wide swath of the Mid-Atlantic region and could "paralyze the eastern third of the nation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=January 21, 2016|accessdate=January 22, 2016|title= Potentially historic blizzard looms over D.C., more than 2 feet of snow projected |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-east-coast-snowstorm-20160121-story.html|location=Chicago, Illinois}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WAPo_2"&gt;{{cite news|author=Angela Fritz|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=January 22, 2016|accessdate=January 22, 2016|title=Eastern Seaboard braces for potentially historic winter storm|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2016/01/21/severe-winter-storm-will-be-multiple-threat-event-on-the-eastern-seaboard/|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winter weather expert [[Paul Kocin]] described the blizzard as "kind of a top-10 snowstorm".&lt;ref name="TWC_3"&gt;{{cite web|author=Sean Breslin|publisher=[[The Weather Channel]]|date=January 26, 2016|accessdate=January 26, 2016|title=Winter Storm Jonas: At Least 48 Dead; Roof Collapses Reported; D.C. Remains Shut Down|url=http://www.weather.com/storms/winter/news/winter-storm-jonas-impacts-news|location=Atlanta, Georgia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January&amp;nbsp;20–22, the governors of eleven states and the mayor of [[Washington, D.C.]] declared a state of emergency in anticipation of significant snowfall and [[blizzard]] conditions. Approximately 103&amp;nbsp;million people were affected by the storm, with 33&amp;nbsp;million people under [[blizzard warning]]s. More than 13,000&amp;nbsp;flights were cancelled in relation to the storm, with effects rippling internationally. Thousands of [[National Guard of the United States|National Guardsmen]] were placed on standby and states deployed millions of gallons of [[brine]] and thousands of tons of [[road salt]] to lessen the storm's effect on roadways. A travel ban was instituted for [[New York City]] and [[Newark, New Jersey]] for January&amp;nbsp;23–24. The storm was given various unofficial names, including ''Winter Storm Jonas'', ''Blizzard of 2016'' and ''Snowzilla''.

Seven states observed snowfall in excess of {{convert|30|in|cm|abbr=on}}, with accumulations peaking at {{convert|42|in|cm|abbr=on}} in [[Glengary, West Virginia|Glengary]], West Virginia.  Ice- and snow-covered roads led to hundreds of incidents across the affected region, several of which resulted in deaths and injuries. At least 55&amp;nbsp;people were killed in storm-related incidents: 12 in Virginia, 9 in Pennsylvania, 6 in New Jersey, 6 in New York, 6 in North Carolina, 4 in South Carolina, 3 in Maryland, 3 in Washington, D.C., 1 in Arkansas, 1 in Delaware, 1 in Georgia, 1 in Kentucky, 1 in Massachusetts, and 1 in Ohio. Total economic losses are estimated between $500&amp;nbsp;million and $3&amp;nbsp;billion. The storm ranked as a Category&amp;nbsp;5 "extreme" event for the Northeast on the [[Regional Snowfall Index]], and a Category&amp;nbsp;4 for the Southeast. It is the most recent winter storm to [[List of Regional Snowfall Index Category 5 winter storms|rank as a Category 5]], and the first to do so since the [[January 31 – February 2, 2011 North American blizzard|2011 Groundhog Day Blizzard]].

During the mid-afternoon hours of January&amp;nbsp;22, a new low-pressure area began to develop over the coast of the [[Carolinas]] as the former storm tracked into central [[Georgia (U. S. state)|Georgia]]. Owing to uncertainty in short-range guidance but a high confidence of a sharp northern edge of precipitation, many forecasts until just hours before snowfall began were predicting 12" of snow or less from Allentown, Pennsylvania, toward New York City and the southern coast of New England. As the storm moved further north and rapidly strengthened, it became apparent that snowfall would be much higher farther north and forecasters quickly began upgrading their totals.&lt;ref name=Adv4&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burke|first1=Patrick|last2=Orisson|first2=Andrew|title=Storm Summary Number 04 For Eastern U.S. Major Winter Storm|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/winter_storm_summaries/storm1/stormsum_4.html|website=Weather Prediction Center|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=January 22, 2016|location=College Park, Maryland|date=January 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early on January 24, as the storm was leaving New England, the system began to become elongated, as a secondary low developed to the southwest of the storm's central low.&lt;ref name="Jonas elongates"&gt;[http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/archives/web_pages/sfc/sfc_archive_maps.php?arcdate=01/24/2016&amp;selmap=2016012409&amp;maptype=satsfcnps WPC surface analysis valid for 01/24/2016 at 09 UTC]&lt;/ref&gt; On January 25, the blizzard left the East Coast of the United States; on the same day, the system was named ''Karin'' by the University of Berlin.&lt;ref name="Karin"&gt;http://www.met.fu-berlin.de/de/wetter/maps/Analyse_20160125.gif&lt;/ref&gt;

Accompanied by a strong jet stream in the Atlantic, the remnants of the storm crossed the [[British Isles]] on January 26.

===Snowfall measurement reviews===
Following the storm, the National Weather Service conducted a review of eight snowfall observations following concerns over their quality. Measurements from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, Dulles International Airport, Baltimore/Washington International Airport, John F. Kennedy International Airport, LaGuardia International Airport, and Philadelphia International Airport were verified as reliable.&lt;ref name="NOAA_April"/&gt; The total at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport was brought into question immediately following the blizzard as the snow observers lost their measuring board during the storm;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Angela Fritz |author2=Shawn Boburg |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=January 24, 2016|accessdate=April 28, 2016|title=Lower-than-expected D.C. snowfall total raises questions about its measurement|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2016/01/24/paltry-national-airport-snowfall-total-raises-questions-about-observing-standards/}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the assessment determined that proper procedure was continued even after the board was lost and the total was considered accurate. A review of measurements at Central Park, New York,  revealed the {{convert|26.8|in|cm|abbr=on}} observation was the result of a communication error and revised the storm-total to {{convert|27.5|in|cm|abbr=on}}—an all-time record for New York City. Furthermore, the {{convert|28.1|in|cm|abbr=on}} measurement at Newark International Airport, New Jersey, was invalidated due to measurements being taken every hour instead of every six hours thus inflating the total.&lt;ref name="NOAA_April"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|date=April 28, 2016|accessdate=April 28, 2016|title=Review of Jan. 2016 blizzard preliminary snow totals validates DC measurement|url=http://www.noaa.gov/review-jan-2016-blizzard-preliminary-snow-totals-validates-dc-measurement}}&lt;/ref&gt; The State Climate Extremes Committee also conducted a review of a potential 24-hour state snowfall record at Mount Mitchell in North Carolina. Their results showed the 24-hour observation of {{convert|41|in|cm|abbr=on}} to be in error, erroneously inflating the snowfall totals. Properly adjusting for liquid snow ratios, the total was revised to {{convert|21|in|cm|abbr=on}}. The storm-total accumulation was also revised from {{convert|66|in|cm|abbr=on}} to {{convert|33|in|cm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Mount_Mitchell"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4478">'''Lamé's stress ellipsoid''' is an alternative to [[Mohr's circle]] for the graphical representation of the [[Stress (mechanics)#Stress tensor|stress state at a point]]. The surface of the [[ellipsoid]] represents the locus of the endpoints of all stress vectors acting on all planes passing through a given point in the continuum body. In other words, the endpoints of all stress vectors at a given point in the continuum body lie on the stress ellipsoid surface, i.e., the radius-vector from the center of the ellipsoid, located at the material point in consideration, to a point on the surface of the ellipsoid is equal to the stress vector on some plane passing through the point. In two dimensions, the surface is represented by an [[ellipse]].

Once the equations of the ellipsoid is known, the magnitude of the stress vector can then be obtained for any plane passing through that point.

To determine the equation of the stress ellipsoid we consider the coordinate axes &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2, x_3\,\!&lt;/math&gt; taken in the directions of the principal axes, i.e., in a principal stress space. Thus, the coordinates of the stress vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf T^{(\mathbf n)}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; on a plane with normal unit vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf n\,\!&lt;/math&gt; passing through a given point &lt;math&gt;P\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is represented by

:&lt;math&gt;T_1^{(\mathbf n)}=\sigma_1n_1, \qquad T_2^{(\mathbf n)}=\sigma_2n_2, \qquad T_3^{(\mathbf n)}=\sigma_3n_3\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

And knowing that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf n\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a unit vector we have

:&lt;math&gt;n_1^2+n_2^2+n_3^2=\frac{T_1}{{\sigma_1}^2}^2+\frac{T_2}{{\sigma_2}^2}^2+\frac{T_3}{{\sigma_3}^2}^2=1\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

which is the equation of an ellipsoid centered at the origin of the coordinate system, with the lengths of the semiaxes of the ellipsoid equal to the magnitudes of the principal stresses, i.e. the intercepts of the ellipsoid with the principal axes are &lt;math&gt;\pm\sigma_1, \pm\sigma_2, \pm\sigma_3\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

* The first stress invariant &lt;math&gt;I_1\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is directly proportional to the sum of the principal radii of the ellipsoid.
* The second stress invariant &lt;math&gt;I_2\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is directly proportional to the sum of the three principal areas of the ellipsoid. The three principal areas are the ellipses on each principal plane.
* The third stress invariant &lt;math&gt;I_3\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is directly proportional to the volume of the ellipsoid.
* If two of the three principal stresses are numerically equal the stress ellipsoid becomes an [[spheroid|ellipsoid of revolution]].&lt;ref name="timoshenko2"&gt;Timoshenko&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, two principal areas are ellipses and the third is a [[circle]].
* If all of the principal stresses are equal and of the same sign, the stress ellipsoid becomes a [[sphere]] and any three perpendicular directions can be taken as principal axes.&lt;ref name="timoshenko2"/&gt;

The stress ellipsoid by itself, however, does not indicate the plane on which the given traction vector acts. Only for the case where the stress vector lies along one of the principal directions it is possible to know the direction of the plane, as the principal stresses act perpendicular to their planes. To find the orientation of any other plane we used the ''stress-director surface''&lt;ref name="timoshenko2"/&gt; or ''stress director quadric''&lt;ref name=timoshenko2&gt;Timoshenko&lt;/ref&gt; represented by the equation

:&lt;math&gt;n_1^2+n_2^2+n_3^2=\frac{T_1^2}{{\sigma_1}^2}+\frac{T_2^2}{{\sigma_2}^2}+\frac{T_3^2}{{\sigma_3}^2}=1\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The stress represented by a radius-vector of the stress ellipsoid acts on a plane oriented parallel to the tangent plane to the stress-director surface at the point of its intersection with the radius-vector.&lt;ref name="timoshenko2"/&gt;

The '''Land grant to Marduk-zākir-šumi kudurru''' is an ancient [[Mesopotamian]] ''narû'', or entitlement stele, recording the gift (''irīmšu'') of 18 ''bur'' 2 ''eše''&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Mathematics in Ancient Iraq: A Social History | author = Eleanor Robson | publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 2008 | page = 361 }} note 37&lt;/ref&gt; (about 120 hectares or 300 acres) of corn-land by [[Kassites|Kassite]] king of [[Babylon]] [[Marduk-apla-iddina I]] (ca. 1171–1159 BC) to his ''bēl pīḫati'' (inscribed &lt;sup&gt;lú&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;EN NAM&lt;/small&gt; and meaning "person responsible"), or a provincial official.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = A Political History of post-Kassite Babylonia, 1158-722 B.C.

It was originally given the collection reference D.T. 273 and later that of BM 90850. The face has three registers featuring eighteen symbolic representations of gods (listed below identifying the corresponding deity) and the back has three columns of text (line-art pictured right).

'''Leslie Lawrance Foldy''' (1919–2001) was a [[theoretical physicist]], who made contributions to [[condensed matter physics]] and [[quantum mechanics]].

==Early life==

Foldy was born in [[Sabinov|Sabinov, Czechoslovakia]], on October 26, 1919. His parents were of [[Hungary|Hungarian]] origin, and named their son László Földi. In 1920, the family moved to the USA due to the invasions of Czechoslovakia by Hungary around that time, and there he was known as Leslie Foldy.

==Education==

His high school education was in [[Cleveland|Cleveland, Ohio]], and at that time he called his middle name "Lawrance", upon noticing he hadn't a middle name while the other students had. While at [[high school]], he picked up an interest in [[physics]]. In 1941, Foldy graduated with a B.S. degree in physics from the [[Case School of Applied Science]] (now renamed to the ''Case School of Engineering''), his senior thesis was on [[crystal lattice]] vibrations.

==Research==

He started his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PHD]] in 1945 at the [[University of California]] in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], in [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]]'s group, and with [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]] and [[David Bohm]], until 1947. In 1948 he completed his doctoral degree at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton University|Princeton]], and later returned to the Case Institute of Technology as an assistant professor of physics.

In 1949 at the [[University of Rochester]], Foldy and [[Siegfried Adolf Wouthuysen]], working with [[Robert Marshak]], wrote a preprint on the nonrelativistic limit of the [[Dirac equation]]. In 1950 at [[Michigan]], their work was criticized as erroneous, motivating Foldy and Wouthuysen to make their calculations clear and efficient. A transformation forming part of their calculations is now called the [[Foldy–Wouthuysen transformation]].

Positions he held at the Institute for Advanced Study include:

*[[Fulbright Fellow]], 1953–54
*[[Guggenheim Fellow]], 1953–54
*NSF Sr Postdoc Fellow, 1963–64

{{Meals}}
[[File:Jean-Baptiste de Saive (circle) Kitchen interior with maid 1563.jpg|thumb|Meals have been traditionally prepared by women in a home kitchen (Painting from the circle of Jean-Baptiste de Saive, 1563)]]
A '''meal''' is an [[eating]] occasion that takes place at a certain time and includes prepared [[food]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/meal_1?q=meal meal noun (FOOD) - definition in the British English Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus - Cambridge Dictionaries Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/meal meal - Definition from Longman English Dictionary Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The names used for specific meals in [[English (language)|English]] vary greatly, depending on the speaker's [[culture]], the [[time]] of day, or the size of the meal.

Meals occur primarily at [[home]]s, [[restaurant]]s, and [[cafeteria]]s, but may occur anywhere. Regular meals occur on a daily basis, typically several times a day. Special meals are usually held in conjunction with such occasions as [[birthday]]s, [[wedding]]s, [[Wedding anniversary|anniversaries]], events and [[religious holiday|holidays]]. A meal is different from a [[snack]] in that meals are generally larger, more varied, and more filling than snacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wansink | first1 = B. | last2 = Payne | first2 = C. R. | last3 = Shimizu | first3 = M. | doi = 10.1016/j.appet.2009.09.016 | title = "Is this a meal or snack?" Situational cues that drive perceptions | journal = Appetite | volume = 54 | issue = 1 | pages = 214–216 | year = 2010 | pmid =  19808071| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The type of meal served or eaten at any given time varies by custom and location. In most modern cultures, three main meals are eaten: in the morning, early afternoon, and evening. Further, the names of meals are often interchangeable by custom as well. Some serve [[dinner]] as the main meal at midday, with [[supper]] as the late afternoon/early evening meal; while others may call their midday meal [[lunch]] and their early evening meal supper. Except for "breakfast", these names can vary from region to region or even from family to family.

A study in 2016 by Toluna found that 47% of parents in the United States share fewer meals with their families than when growing up, and 58% wished they could do it more frequently, including 66% of dads.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refrigeratedfrozenfood.com/articles/90952-study-shows-trends-in-family-mealtimes "Study shows trends in family mealtimes"], Refrigerated &amp; Frozen Foods magazine. May 26, 2016. Retrieved 7 feb 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

== Breakfast ==
{{Main article|Breakfast}}

[[Breakfast]] is the first meal of a day, most often eaten in the early morning before undertaking the day's work. Some believe it to be the most important meal of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/breakfast |title=breakfast – definition of breakfast by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |accessdate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''breakfast'' literally refers to breaking the [[fasting]] period of the prior night.&lt;ref name="Anderson-2013"&gt;Anderson, Heather Arndt (2013). [https://books.google.com/books?id=5LghYCqDJw8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Breakfast: A History'']. AltaMira Press. {{ISBN|0759121656}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breakfast foods vary widely from place to place, but often include a [[carbohydrate]] such as [[Food grain|grains]] or cereals, fruit, vegetables, a [[Protein (nutrient)|protein]] food such as [[egg (food)|eggs]], meat or fish, and a beverage such as [[tea]], [[coffee]], [[milk]], or [[fruit juice]]. Coffee, milk, tea, juice, [[breakfast cereal]]s, [[pancake]]s, [[waffle]]s, [[sausage]]s, [[French toast]], [[bacon]], [[:Category:Sweet breads|sweetened breads]], fresh fruits, vegetables, [[egg (food)|eggs]], [[baked beans]], [[muffin]]s, [[crumpet]]s and [[toast]] with [[butter]], [[margarine]], [[jam]] or [[marmalade]] are common examples of Western breakfast foods, though a large range of preparations and ingredients are associated with breakfast globally.&lt;ref name="hob"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breakfastpanel.org/history-of-breakfast/|title=History of breakfast|accessdate=21 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110123043206/http://breakfastpanel.org/history-of-breakfast|archive-date=23 January 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Variations of breakfast ===

==== Full breakfast ====
{{Main article|Full breakfast}}

A [[full breakfast]] is a [[breakfast]] meal, usually including [[bacon]], [[Sausage#United Kingdom|sausages]], [[egg (food)|eggs]], and a variety of other cooked foods, with a beverage such as coffee or tea. It is especially popular in the UK and Ireland, to the extent that many [[café]]s and [[pub]]s offer the meal at any time of day as an "all-day breakfast". It is also popular in other English-speaking countries.

In England it is usually referred to as a 'full English breakfast' (often shortened to 'full English') or 'fry-up'.&lt;ref name="full English"&gt;{{cite web|title=The full English|url=http://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/pork-recipes/the-full-english|publisher=Jamieoliver.com|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other regional names and variants include the 'full Scottish', 'full Welsh', 'full Irish' and the 'Ulster fry'.&lt;ref name="full Scottish"&gt;{{cite web|title=Traditional Scottish Food|url=http://www.visitscotland.com/about/food-drink/traditional|publisher=Visit Scotland|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="full Welsh"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rowland |first=Paul |title=So what is a 'full Welsh breakfast'? |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/what-full-welsh-breakfast-2374227 |accessdate=26 February 2014 |newspaper=Wales Online |date=25 October 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502004835/http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/what-full-welsh-breakfast-2374227 |archivedate=2 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bell|first=James|title=How to... Cook the perfect Ulster Fry|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/life/recipes/how-to-cook-the-perfect-ulster-fry-29962910.html|accessdate=26 February 2014|newspaper=Belfast Telegraph|date=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The full breakfast is among the most internationally recognised [[British cuisine|British dishes]], along with such staples as [[bangers &amp; mash]], [[shepherd's pie]], [[fish and chips]] and the [[Christmas dinner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=British Food: An Extraordinary Thousand Years of History |first=Colin|last= Spencer|year=2003|isbn=978-0-231-13110-0|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full breakfast became popular in the British Isles during the Victorian era, and appeared as one among many suggested breakfasts in the home economist [[Isabella Beeton]]'s ''[[Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management|The Book of Household Management]]'' (1861). A full breakfast is often contrasted (e.g. on hotel menus) with the lighter alternative of a [[Continental breakfast]], traditionally consisting of tea, milk or coffee and [[fruit juice]]s with bread, [[croissant]]s, or [[pastry|pastries]].

==== Instant breakfast ====
{{Main article|Instant breakfast}}

"[[Instant breakfast]]" typically refers to breakfast food products that are manufactured in a [[Drying (food)|powdered]] form, which are generally prepared with the addition of [[milk]] and then consumed as a [[beverage]].&lt;ref name=Sengupta&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KtVdGFjYuxsC&amp;pg=PA5 Brand Positioning: Strategies for Competitive Advantage - Subroto Sengupta&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]. pp. 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lantos/&gt; Some instant breakfasts are produced and marketed in liquid form, being pre-mixed. The target market for instant breakfast products includes consumers who tend to be busy, such as working adults.&lt;ref name=Lantos&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JemkYebV5NYC&amp;pg=PA45 Consumer Behavior in Action: Real-Life Applications for Marketing Managers - Geoffrey P. Lantos&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]. p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Champagne breakfast ====
{{Main article|Champagne breakfast}}

A [[champagne breakfast]] is a [[breakfast]] served with [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]] or [[sparkling wine]]. It is a new concept in some countries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1050103/asp/calcutta/story_3634736.asp |title=The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro |publisher=Telegraphindia.com |date=2005-01-03 |accessdate=2011-03-04 |location=Calcutta, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is not typical of the role of a breakfast.

It may be part of any day or outing considered particularly [[luxurious]] or [[indulgent]]. The accompanying breakfast is sometimes of a similarly high standard &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icseftonandwestlancs.icnetwork.co.uk/crosbyherald/news/tm_headline=grand-national-thrills-for-crosby-couple&amp;method=full&amp;objectid=20740586&amp;siteid=60252-name_page.html |title=icseftonandwestlancs - Grand National thrills for Crosby couple |publisher=Icseftonandwestlancs.icnetwork.co.uk |date=2009-08-11 |accessdate=2011-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and include rich foods such as [[salmon]], [[caviar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Press Association |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/oct/24/theairlineindustry.travelnews |title=Concorde makes final landing &amp;#124; Business |publisher=guardian.co.uk |date= 2003-10-24|accessdate=2011-03-04 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[chocolate]] or [[pastries]], which would not ordinarily be eaten at [[breakfast]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://mnweekly.ru/travel/20080410/55322252.html Moscow News - Travel - Swissц╢tel Krasnye Holmy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420060007/http://mnweekly.ru/travel/20080410/55322252.html |date=20 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or more courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/mag/2007/08/19/stories/2007081950200700.htm |title=Magazine / Travel : Weekend getaway |publisher=The Hindu |date=2007-08-19 |accessdate=2011-03-04 |location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Instead of as a formal meal the breakfast can be given to the recipient in a basket or hamper.

==Lunch==
{{Main article|Lunch}}

[[Lunch]], the abbreviation for ''luncheon'', is a light meal typically eaten at midday.&lt;ref name="Davidson2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Davidson|title=The Oxford Companion to Food|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bIIeBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA478|date=August 21, 2014|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-104072-6|page=478}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the words ''lunch'' and ''luncheon'' relate to a small snack originally eaten at any time of the day or night. During the 20th century the meaning gradually narrowed to a small or mid-sized meal eaten at midday. Lunch is commonly the second meal of the day after [[breakfast]]. The meal varies in size depending on the culture, and significant variations exist in different areas of the world.

=== Variations of lunch ===
{{Main article|Packed lunch}}

A [[packed lunch]] (also called '''pack lunch''', '''sack lunch''' or '''bag lunch''' in [[North America]], or '''packed lunch''' in the [[United Kingdom]], as well as the regional variations: '''bagging''' in [[Lancashire]], [[Merseyside]] and [[Yorkshire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/lancashire/voices2005/game.shtml |title = BBC: Lancashire &gt; Voices &gt; Wordly Wise? |publisher = BBC |date = 31 May 2005 |accessdate= 1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[lunch]] prepared at [[home]] and carried to be [[eat]]en somewhere else, such as [[school]], a [[wiktionary:Workplace|workplace]], or at an [[excursion|outing]]. The food is usually wrapped in [[plastic wrap|plastic]], [[aluminum foil]], or [[paper]] and can be carried ("[[wikt:packed|packed]]") in a [[lunch box]], [[paper bag]] (a "[[Bag|sack]]"), or [[plastic bag]]. While packed lunches are usually taken from home by the people who are going to eat them, in [[Mumbai, India]], [[tiffin]] boxes are most often picked up from the home and brought to workplaces later in the day by so-called [[dabbawalla]]s. It is also possible to buy packed lunches from stores in several countries. [[Lunch box]]es made out of [[metal]], [[plastic]] or [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] are now popular with today's youth. Lunch boxes provide a way to take heavier lunches in a sturdier box or bag. It is also [[environmentally friendly]].

== Dinner ==
{{Main article|Dinner}}

Dinner usually refers to the most significant and important meal of the day, which can be the [[noon]] or the [[evening]] meal. However, the term "dinner" can have many different meanings depending on the culture; it may mean a meal of any size eaten at any time of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Olver|first=Lynne|title=Meal times|url=http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodfaq7.html#mealtimes|publisher=Lynne Olver|accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|McMillan|2001}} Historically, it referred to the first meal of the day, eaten around noon, and is still sometimes used for a noon-time meal, particularly if it is a large or main meal. The meaning as the evening meal, generally the largest of the day, is becoming a standard in many parts of the [[English-speaking world]].

=== Variations of dinner===

==== Full course dinner====
{{Main article|Full course dinner}}

A full course dinner is a dinner consisting of multiple dishes, or courses. In its simplest form, it can consist of three to five courses, such as appetizers, fish course, entrée, main course and dessert.

== Meals at other times of the day ==
{{Main article|Outline of meals#Types of meals, in the order served throughout the day}}

== Meal preparation ==
{{Main article|Meal preparation}}

[[Meal preparation]], sometimes called "meal prep," is the process of planning and preparing meals. It generally involves food preparation, including cooking.

=== Food preparation ===
{{Main article|Food preparation}}

[[Food preparation|Preparing food]] for eating generally requires selection, measurement and combination of ingredients in an ordered procedure so as to achieve desired results. Food preparation includes but is not limited to cooking.

==== Cooking ====
{{Main article|Cooking}}

[[Cooking]] or ''cookery'' is the [[art]], [[technology]] and [[craft]] of preparing [[food]] for consumption with the use of heat. Cooking techniques and ingredients vary widely across the [[Earth|world]], from grilling food over an open fire to using electric stoves, to baking in various types of ovens, reflecting unique environmental, economic, and cultural traditions and trends. The ways or types of cooking also depend on the skill and type of training an individual cook has. Cooking is done both by people in their own dwellings and by professional cooks and chefs in restaurants and other food establishments. Cooking can also occur through chemical reactions without the presence of heat, most notably with [[ceviche]], a traditional [[South American]] dish where [[fish]] is cooked with the acids in [[lemon]] or lime juice.

The '''mica''' group of sheet [[silicate]] ([[Silicate minerals#Phyllosilicates|phyllosilicate]]) [[mineral]]s includes several closely related materials having nearly perfect [[basal cleavage]]. All are [[monoclinic]], with a tendency towards pseudohexagonal [[crystal]]s, and are similar in chemical composition. The nearly perfect cleavage, which is the most prominent characteristic of mica, is explained by the [[hexagon]]al sheet-like arrangement of its [[atom]]s.

The word ''mica'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''{{lang|la|[[wikt:mica#Latin|mica]]}}'', meaning ''a crumb'', and probably influenced by ''{{lang|la|[[wikt:mico#Latin|micare]]}}'', to glitter.&lt;ref name="Chambers"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Kirkpatrick, E.

Structurally, micas can be classed as dioctahedral (''Y'' = 4) and trioctahedral (''Y'' = 6). If the ''X'' ion is K or Na, the mica is a ''common'' mica, whereas if the ''X'' ion is Ca, the mica is classed as a ''brittle'' mica.

=== Interlayer-deficient micas ===

Very fine-grained micas, which typically show more variation in ion and water content, are informally termed "clay micas". They include:
* Hydro-muscovite with H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; along with K in the ''X'' site;
* [[Illite]] with a K deficiency in the ''X'' site and correspondingly more Si in the ''Z'' site;
* [[Phengite]] with Mg or Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; substituting for Al in the ''Y'' site and a corresponding increase in Si in the ''Z'' site.

== Occurrence and production ==
[[File:Mica.webm|thumb|Mica embedded in metamorphic rock]]

Mica is widely distributed and occurs in [[igneous]], [[metamorphic rocks|metamorphic]] and [[sedimentary]] regimes. Large crystals of mica used for various applications are typically mined from [[granitic]] [[pegmatite]]s.

Until the 19th century, large crystals of mica were quite rare and expensive as a result of the limited supply in Europe. However, their price dramatically dropped when large reserves were found and mined in Africa and South America during the early 19th century. The largest documented single crystal of mica ([[phlogopite]]) was found in Lacey Mine, [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]; it measured {{convert|10|×|4.3|×|4.3|m|ft|abbr=on}} and weighed about {{convert|330|tonne|ton}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url = http://www.minsocam.org/ammin/AM66/AM66_885.pdf| journal = American Mineralogist| volume = 66| pages = 885–907| year = 1981| title = The largest crystals| author = Rickwood, P.

The [[British Geological Survey]] reported that as of 2005, [[Koderma]] district in [[Jharkhand]] state in India had the largest deposits of mica in the world. China was the top producer of mica with almost a third of the global share, closely followed by the US, South Korea and Canada. Large deposits of sheet mica were mined in New England from the 19th century to the 1970s. Large mines existed in [[Connecticut]], [[New Hampshire]], and [[Maine]].

Scrap and flake mica is produced all over the world. In 2010, the major producers were Russia (100,000 tonnes), Finland (68,000 t), United States (53,000 t), South Korea (50,000 t), France (20,000 t) and Canada (15,000 t). The total global production was 350,000 t, although no reliable data were available for China. Most sheet mica was produced in India (3,500 t) and Russia (1,500 t).&lt;ref name=usgs2&gt;[http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/mica/mcs-2011-mica.pdf Mica] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111030231115/http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/mica/mcs-2011-mica.pdf |date=2011-10-30 }}, USGS Mineral Commodity Summaries 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Flake mica comes from several sources: the metamorphic rock called [[schist]] as a byproduct of processing feldspar and kaolin resources, from placer deposits, and from pegmatites. Sheet mica is considerably less abundant than flake and scrap mica, and is occasionally recovered from mining scrap and flake mica. The most important sources of sheet mica are pegmatite deposits. Sheet mica prices vary with grade and can range from less than $1 per kilogram for low-quality mica to more than $2,000 per kilogram for the highest quality.&lt;ref name=usgs&gt;Dolley, Thomas P. (2008) [http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/mica/myb1-2008-mica.pdf "Mica"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111030231138/http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/mica/myb1-2008-mica.pdf |date=2011-10-30 }} in ''USGS 2008 Minerals Yearbook''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties and uses ==

The mica group represents 37 [[Silicate minerals#Phyllosilicates|phyllosilicate minerals]] that have a layered or platy texture. The commercially important micas are muscovite and phlogopite, which are used in a variety of applications. Mica’s value is based on several of its unique physical properties. The crystalline structure of mica forms layers that can be split or delaminated into thin sheets usually causing [[Foliation (geology)|foliation]] in rocks. These sheets are chemically inert, [[dielectric]], elastic, flexible, hydrophilic, insulating, lightweight, platy, reflective, refractive, resilient, and range in opacity from transparent to opaque. Mica is stable when exposed to electricity, light, moisture, and extreme temperatures. It has superior electrical properties as an insulator and as a dielectric, and can support an electrostatic field while dissipating minimal energy in the form of heat; it can be split very thin (0.025 to 0.125 millimeters or thinner) while maintaining its electrical properties, has a high dielectric breakdown, is thermally stable to {{convert|500|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, and is resistant to [[corona discharge]]. Muscovite, the principal mica used by the electrical industry, is used in capacitors that are ideal for high frequency and radio frequency. Phlogopite mica remains stable at higher temperatures (to {{convert|900|°C|°F|abbr=on}}) and is used in applications in which a combination of high-heat stability and electrical properties is required. Muscovite and phlogopite are used in sheet and ground forms.&lt;ref name=usgs/&gt;

=== Ground mica ===

The leading use of dry-ground mica in the US is in the joint compound for filling and finishing seams and blemishes in [[gypsum]] wallboard ([[drywall]]). The mica acts as a filler and extender, provides a smooth consistency, improves the workability of the compound, and provides resistance to cracking. In 2008, joint compound accounted for 54% of dry-ground mica consumption. In the paint industry, ground mica is used as a [[pigment]] extender that also facilitates suspension, reduces chalking, prevents shrinking and shearing of the paint film increases the resistance of the paint film to water penetration and weathering and brightens the tone of colored pigments. Mica also promotes paint adhesion in aqueous and oleoresinous formulations. Consumption of dry-ground mica in paint, the second-ranked use, accounted for 22% of the dry-ground mica used in 2008.&lt;ref name=usgs/&gt;

Ground mica is used in the well-drilling industry as an additive to [[drilling fluid]]s. The coarsely ground mica flakes help prevent the loss of circulation by sealing porous sections of the drill hole. Well drilling muds accounted for 15% of dry-ground mica use in 2008. The [[plastics industry]] used dry-ground mica as an extender and filler, especially in parts for automobiles as lightweight insulation to suppress sound and vibration. Mica is used in plastic automobile [[Fascia (car)|fascia]] and [[Fender (vehicle)|fenders]] as a reinforcing material, providing improved mechanical properties and increased dimensional stability, stiffness, and strength. Mica-reinforced plastics also have high-heat dimensional stability, reduced warpage, and the best surface properties of any filled plastic composite. In 2008, consumption of dry-ground mica in plastic applications accounted for 2% of the market. The rubber industry used ground mica as an inert filler and mold release compound in the manufacture of molded rubber products such as tires and roofing. The platy texture acts as an anti-blocking, anti-sticking agent. Rubber mold lubricant accounted for 1.5% of the dry-ground mica used in 2008. As a rubber additive, mica reduces gas permeation and improves resiliency.&lt;ref name=usgs/&gt;

Dry-ground mica is used in the production of rolled roofing and [[asphalt]] [[Roof shingle|shingles]], where it serves as a surface coating to prevent sticking of adjacent surfaces. The coating is not absorbed by freshly manufactured roofing because mica’s platy structure is unaffected by the acid in asphalt or by weather conditions. Mica is used in decorative coatings on wallpaper, concrete, [[stucco]], and tile surfaces. It also is used as an ingredient in flux coatings on welding rods, in some special greases, and as coatings for core and mold release compounds, facing agents, and mold washes in foundry applications. Dry-ground phlogopite mica is used in automotive brake linings and clutch plates to reduce noise and vibration ([[asbestos]] substitute); as sound-absorbing insulation for coatings and [[polymer]] systems; in reinforcing additives for polymers to increase strength and stiffness and to improve stability to heat, chemicals, and ultraviolet (UV) radiation; in heat shields and temperature insulation; in industrial coating additive to decrease the permeability of moisture and hydrocarbons; and in polar polymer formulations to increase the strength of epoxies, nylons, and [[polyester]]s.&lt;ref name=usgs/&gt;

[[File:Mica-moniale.jpg|thumb|Mica flakes embedded in a [[fresco]] for glitter]]

Wet-ground mica, which retains the brilliance of its cleavage faces, is used primarily in pearlescent paints by the automotive industry. Many metallic-looking pigments are composed of a substrate of mica coated with another mineral, usually [[titanium dioxide]] (TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The resultant pigment produces a reflective color depending on the thickness of the coating. These products are used to produce automobile paint, shimmery plastic containers, high-quality inks used in advertising and security applications. In the cosmetics industry, its reflective and refractive properties make mica an important ingredient in [[rouge (cosmetics)|blushes]], [[eye liner]], [[eye shadow]], [[Foundation (cosmetics)|foundation]], hair and body glitter, [[lipstick]], [[lip gloss]], [[mascara]], moisturizing lotions, and nail polish. Some brands of toothpaste include powdered white mica. This acts as a mild abrasive to aid polishing of the tooth surface, and also adds a cosmetically pleasing, glittery shimmer to the paste. Mica is added to latex balloons to provide a colored shiny surface.&lt;ref name=usgs/&gt;

Mica is also used as an insulator in concrete block and home attics and can be poured into walls (usually in retrofitting uninsulated open top walls). Mica may also be used as a soil conditioner, especially in potting soil mixes and in gardening plots. Greases used for [[axle]]s are composed of a compound of fatty oils to which mica, [[tar]] or [[graphite]] is added to increase the durability of the grease and give it a better surface.

=== Built-up mica ===

Muscovite and phlogopite splittings can be fabricated into various built-up mica products. Produced by mechanized or hand setting of overlapping splittings and alternate layers of binders and splittings, built-up mica is used primarily as an electrical insulation material. Mica insulation is used in high-temperature and fire-resistant power cables in aluminium plants, [[blast furnace]]s, critical wiring circuits (for example, defense systems, fire and security alarm systems, and surveillance systems), heaters and boilers, lumber [[kiln]]s, metal smelters, and tanks and furnace wiring. Specific high-temperature mica-insulated wire and cable is rated to work for up to 15 minutes in molten aluminium, glass, and steel. Major products are bonding materials; flexible, heater, molding, and segment plates; mica paper; and tape.&lt;ref name=usgs/&gt;

Flexible plate is used in electric motor and generator armatures, field coil insulation, and magnet and [[commutator (electric)|commutator]] core insulation. Mica consumption in flexible plate was about 21 tonnes in 2008 in the US. Heater plate is used where high-temperature insulation is required. Molding plate is sheet mica from which V-rings are cut and stamped for use in insulating the copper segments from the steel shaft ends of a commutator. Molding plate is also fabricated into tubes and rings for insulation in armatures, [[Motor controller|motor starters]], and transformers. Segment plate acts as insulation between the copper commutator segments of direct-current universal motors and generators. Phlogopite built-up mica is preferred because it wears at the same rate as the copper segments. Although muscovite has a greater resistance to wear, it causes uneven ridges that may interfere with the operation of a motor or generator. Consumption of segment plate was about 149 t in 2008 in the US. Some types of built-up mica have the bonded splittings reinforced with cloth, glass, [[linen]], [[muslin]], plastic, silk, or special paper. These products are very flexible and are produced in wide, continuous sheets that are either shipped, rolled, or cut into ribbons or tapes, or trimmed to specified dimensions. Built-up mica products may also be corrugated or reinforced by multiple layering. In 2008, about 351 t of built-up mica was consumed in the US, mostly for molding plates (19%) and segment plates (42%).&lt;ref name=usgs/&gt;

=== Sheet mica ===
[[File:Mikanit.jpg|thumb|Mica insulator items]]
[[File:Silver mica capacitors.jpg|thumb|Silver mica capacitors]]
[[File:Muscovite window.jpg|thumb|Muscovite windows]]

Technical grade sheet mica is used in electrical components, electronics, in atomic force microscopy and as window sheets. Other uses include diaphragms for oxygen-breathing equipment, marker dials for navigation compasses, [[Filter (optics)|optical filters]], [[pyrometer]]s, thermal regulators, stove and kerosene heater windows, radiation aperture covers for microwave ovens, and [[micathermic heater]] elements. Mica is [[birefringence|birefringent]] and is therefore commonly used to make quarter and half [[wave plate]]s. Specialized applications for sheet mica are found in aerospace components in air-, ground-, and sea-launched missile systems, [[laser]] devices, medical electronics and radar systems. Mica is mechanically stable in micrometer-thin sheets which are relatively transparent to radiation (such as [[alpha particle]]s) while being impervious to most gases. It is therefore used as a window on radiation detectors such as [[Geiger-Müller tube]]s.

In 2008, mica splittings represented the largest part of the sheet mica industry in the United States. Consumption of muscovite and phlogopite splittings was about 308 t in 2008. Muscovite splittings from India accounted for essentially all US consumption. The remainder was primarily imported from Madagascar.&lt;ref name=usgs/&gt;

Small squared pieces of sheet mica are also used in the traditional Japanese [[Kōdō|Kodo]] ceremony to burn incense: A burning piece of coal is placed inside a cone made of white ash. The sheet of mica is placed on top, acting as a separator between the heat source and the incense, in order to spread the fragrance without burning it.

==== Electrical and electronic ====

Sheet mica is used principally in the electronic and electrical industries. Its usefulness in these applications is derived from its unique electrical and thermal properties and its mechanical properties, which allow it to be cut, punched, stamped, and machined to close tolerances. Specifically, mica is unusual in that it is a good electrical insulator at the same time as being a good thermal conductor. The leading use of block mica is as an electrical insulator in electronic equipment. High-quality block mica is processed to line the gauge glasses of high-pressure steam boilers because of its flexibility, transparency, and resistance to heat and chemical attack. Only high-quality muscovite film mica, which is variously called India ruby mica or ruby muscovite mica, is used as a dielectric in [[capacitor]]s. The highest quality mica film is used to manufacture capacitors for [[calibration standard]]s. The next lower grade is used in [[transmitting capacitor]]s. Receiving capacitors use a slightly lower grade of high-quality muscovite.&lt;ref name=usgs/&gt;

Mica sheets&lt;!--Mica heating boards? --&gt; are used to provide structure for heating wire (such as in [[Kanthal (alloy)|Kanthal]] or [[Nichrome]]) in [[heating element]]s and can withstand up to {{convert|900|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.

==== Peepholes ====

Thin transparent sheets of mica were used for peepholes in boilers, lanterns, [[stove]]s, and [[kerosene heater]]s because they were less likely to shatter than glass when exposed to extreme temperature gradients. Such peepholes were also used in "[[isinglass]] curtains" in horse-drawn [[carriage]]s&lt;ref&gt;Isinglass curtains are referred to in the 1943 musical Oklahoma's song ''[[The Surrey with the Fringe on Top]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and early 20th-century cars.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Atomic force microscopy ====

Another use of mica is as a substrate in the production of ultraflat, thin-film surfaces, e.g. gold surfaces. Although the deposited film surface is still rough due to deposition kinetics, the back side of the film at the mica-film interface is ultraflat once the film is removed from the substrate.  Freshly-cleaved mica surfaces have been used as clean imaging substrates in [[atomic force microscopy]],&lt;ref&gt;Eaton, P. and West, W.

=== Early history ===
[[File:Hand Hopewell mica.jpg|thumb|Hand carved from mica from the [[Hopewell tradition]]]]
Human use of mica dates back to [[prehistory|prehistoric]] times. Mica was known to ancient [[History of India|Indian]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]], [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[History of China|Chinese]] civilizations, as well as the [[Aztec]] civilization of the [[New World]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=Wy1xDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT114&amp;lpg=PT114&amp;dq=Mica+Indian+Egyptian+Greek+Roman+Aztec+chinese&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=euHUFEomkc&amp;sig=_3TWPM1azAGmyDFjifaRobhfPMU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjnzYbuxb7eAhUSdt4KHau3CIcQ6AEwGXoECAIQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Mica%20Indian%20Egyptian%20Greek%20Roman%20Aztec%20chinese&amp;f=false|title=Ancient Giants of the Americas: Suppressed Evidence and the Hidden History of a Lost Race|last=Haze|first=Xaviant|date=2016-11-21|publisher=Red Wheel/Weiser|isbn=9781632659323|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest use of mica has been found in [[cave painting]]s created during the Upper [[Paleolithic]] period (40,000 BC to 10,000 BC). The first hues were red ([[iron oxide]], [[hematite]], or red [[ochre]]) and black ([[manganese dioxide]], [[pyrolusite]]), though black from juniper or pine carbons has also been discovered. White from kaolin or mica was used occasionally.

A few kilometers northeast of [[Mexico City]] stands the ancient site of [[Teotihuacan]]. The most striking structure of Teotihuacan is the towering [[Pyramid of the Sun]]. The pyramid contained considerable amounts of mica in layers up to {{convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Archaeological Fantasies: How Pseudoarchaeology Misrepresents the Past and Misleads the Public|last=Fagan|first=Garrett G.|year=2006|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sIYpx9mzd4gC&amp;pg=PA102|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0415305934|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural mica was and still is used by the [[Taos Pueblo|Taos]] and [[Picuris Pueblo, New Mexico|Picuris Pueblos]] Indians in north-central New Mexico to make pottery. The pottery is made from weathered [[Precambrian]] mica [[schist]], and has flecks of mica throughout the vessels. [[Tewa people|Tewa Pueblo]] pottery is made by coating the clay with mica to provide a dense, glittery micaceous finish over the entire object.&lt;ref name=usgs/&gt;

Mica flakes (called ''abrak'' in Urdu and written as '''ابرک''') are also used in Pakistan to embellish women's summer clothes, especially ''dupattas'' (long light-weight scarves, often colorful and matching the dress).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dehlvi |first=Sadia |title=Tradition and modernity |url=http://archives.dawn.com/weekly/dmag/archive/071014/dmag1.htm |publisher=Dawn.com |date=October 14, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020051416/http://archives.dawn.com/weekly/dmag/archive/071014/dmag1.htm |archivedate=October 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ramzi |first=Shanaz |title=Fashion through the ages |url=http://archives.dawn.com/weekly/review/archive/050331/review1.htm |publisher=Dawn.com |date=March 31, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020051453/http://archives.dawn.com/weekly/review/archive/050331/review1.htm |archivedate=October 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thin mica flakes are added to a hot starch water solution, and the ''dupatta'' is dipped in this water mixture for 3–5 minutes. Then it is hung to air dry.

=== Mica powder ===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}

Throughout the ages, fine powders of mica have been used for various purposes, including decorations. Powdered mica glitter is used to decorate traditional water clay pots in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh; it is also used on traditional [[Pueblo]] pottery, though not restricted to use on water pots in this case. The ''gulal'' and ''[[abir]]'' (colored powders) used by North Indian [[Hindus]] during the festive season of [[Holi]] contain fine crystals of mica to create a sparkling effect. The majestic [[Padmanabhapuram Palace]], {{convert|65|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Trivandrum]] in India, has colored mica windows. Mica powder is also used as a decoration in traditional Japanese [[Woodblock printing in Japan|woodblock printmaking]], as when applied to wet ink and allowed to dry it sparkles and reflects light.

=== Medicine ===

[[Ayurveda]], the Hindu system of ancient medicine prevalent in India, includes the purification and processing of mica in preparing Abhraka [[bhasma]], which is employed in treating diseases of the respiratory and digestive tracts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ayurmedinfo.com/2012/07/02/abhraka-bhasma-benefits-dosage-ingredients-side-effects/ "Abhraka Bhasma Preparation, Indications and Properties"] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20151005045857/http://ayurmedinfo.com/2012/07/02/abhraka-bhasma-benefits-dosage-ingredients-side-effects/ |date=2015-10-05 }} "Ayurmedinfo.com".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ayurtimes.com/abhrak-bhasma/ "Abhraka Bhasma Properties and uses"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004033206/https://www.ayurtimes.com/abhrak-bhasma/ |date=2015-10-04 }} "ayurtimes.com"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health impact ==

Mica dust in the workplace is regarded as a hazardous substance for respiratory exposure above certain concentrations.

===United States===
The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) has set the legal limit ([[permissible exposure limit]]) for mica exposure in the workplace as 20 [[Parts-per notation|mppcf]] over an 8-hour workday. The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has set a [[recommended exposure limit]] (REL) of 3&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; respiratory exposure over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 1,500&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, mica is [[IDLH|immediately dangerous to life and health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = CDC&amp;nbsp;– NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards&amp;nbsp;– Mica (containing less than 1% quartz) | website = www.cdc.gov | url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0431.html | accessdate = 2015-11-27 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151208101341/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0431.html | archivedate = 2015-12-08 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Substitutes ==
Some lightweight [[Aggregate (geology)|aggregates]], such as [[diatomite]], [[perlite]], and [[vermiculite]], may be substituted for ground mica when used as filler. Ground synthetic [[fluorophlogopite]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.continentaltrade.com.pl/fluorphlogopite-synthetic-mica|title=Fluorphlogopite - synthetic mica - Borosilicate and quartz glass, mica, sealing, level gauges, armature - Continental Trade.|author=|date=|website=www.continentaltrade.com.pl|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180212083504/https://www.continentaltrade.com.pl/fluorphlogopite-synthetic-mica|archivedate=2018-02-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a fluorine-rich mica, may replace natural ground mica for uses that require thermal and electrical properties of mica. Many materials can be substituted for mica in numerous electrical, electronic, and insulation uses. Substitutes include [[acrylate polymer]]s, [[cellulose acetate]], [[fiberglass]], [[fishpaper]], [[nylon]], [[phenolic resin|phenolics]], [[polycarbonate]], [[polyester]], [[styrene]], [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl-PVC]], and [[vulcanized fiber]]. Mica paper made from scrap mica can be substituted for sheet mica in electrical and insulation applications.&lt;ref name=usgs2/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1912">'''NACA Report No. 1026 - NACA Investigation of Fuel Performance in Piston-type Engines''' was issued by the United States [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] in 1951. It is a review of databases on [[fuel consumption]] versus power output in aviation [[internal combustion engines]].

==Summary==
It is generally recognized that the [[piston]]-type engine will continue to play an important role in [[air transportation]] for an indefinite period in spite of the intensive effort now being devoted to [[gas turbine]] power plants. For this reason, past researches conducted in piston engines are still of interest in the solution of current problems relating to such engines. 

In order to simplify the task of using the data from previous investigations, an effort has been made to compile a portion of these data into a single reference source. This report is a compilation of several researches acquired by NACA on fuel performance in piston engines. The original researches for this compilation are contained in many separate NACA reports.

[[File:Curtiss AT-5a NACA Cowling - GPN-2000-001724.jpg|thumb|right|Close-up of the cowling on the NACA AT-5A.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= White, Graham |title= Allied Aircraft Piston Engines of World War II |ISBN=1-56091-655-9 |pages=Figures 2.2 &amp; 2.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''NACA cowling''' is a type of [[aerodynamic]] [[Aircraft fairing|fairing]] used to [[streamliner|streamline]] [[radial engine]]s for use on [[airplane]]s and developed by the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] in 1927. It was a major advance in [[ aerodynamic drag]] reduction, and paid for its development and installation costs many times over due to the gains in [[fuel efficiency]] that it enabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= White, Graham |title= Allied Aircraft Piston Engines of World War II |pages=7–8 |ISBN=1-56091-655-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and design==
The NACA [[cowling]] enhanced speed through drag reduction while delivering improved engine cooling. The idea that the NACA cowling produced thrust through the [[Meredith effect]]&lt;ref name="Meredith"&gt;Meredith, F. W: "Cooling of Aircraft Engines. With Special Reference To Ethylene Glycol Radiators Enclosed In Ducts", Aeronautical Research Council R&amp;M 1683, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; is fallacious—although in theory the expansion of the air as it was heated by the engine could create some thrust by exiting at high speed, in practice this required a cowling designed and shaped to achieve the high speed exit of air required (which the NACA cowling was not), and in any case, at 1930s airspeeds, the effect is negligible.&lt;ref name=becker&gt;Becker, J.; [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-445/ch5-5.htm ''The high-speed frontier: Case histories of four NACA programs, 1920- SP-445, NASA (1980), Chapter 5: High-speed Cowlings, Air Inlets and Outlets, and Internal-Flow Systems: The ramjet investigation]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The cowling constitutes a symmetric, circular airfoil, in contrast to the planar airfoil of wings. It directs cool air to flow through the engine where it is routed across the engine's hottest parts, that is, the [[cylinder (engine)|cylinders]] and [[cylinder heads|heads]]. Furthermore, turbulence after the air passes the free-standing cylinders is greatly reduced. The sum of all these effects reduces drag by as much as 60 percent. The test conclusions resulted in almost every radial-engined aircraft being equipped with this cowling, starting in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19930091667_1993091667.pdf ''Full-Scale Testing of N.A.C.A. Cowlings'' ([[Theodore Theodorsen]], M. J. Brevoort, and George W. Stickle, NACA Report # 592. Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory: 1937)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The test aircraft, a [[Curtiss P-1 Hawk|Curtiss AT-5A Hawk]] biplane, featuring a Wright [[Wright R-790|Whirlwind J-5]] radial engine, reached an airspeed of {{convert|137|mph}} equipped with the NACA cowling compared to {{convert|118|mph}} without it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4219/Chapter1.html |title=Engineering Science and the Development of the NACA Low-Drag Engine Cowling |publisher=History.nasa.gov | author=James R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9527">[[File:Opticks by Sir Isaac Newton.png|thumb|Title page of Isaac Newton's ''Opticks'']]

'''Newtonianism''' is a philosophical and scientific [[doctrine]] inspired by the beliefs and methods of natural philosopher [[Isaac Newton]]. While Newton's influential contributions were primarily in physics and mathematics, his broad conception of the universe as being governed by rational and understandable laws laid the foundation for many strands of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thought. Newtonianism became an  influential intellectual program that applied Newton's principles in many avenues of inquiry, laying the groundwork for modern science (both the natural and social sciences), in addition to influencing philosophy, political thought and theology.

== Background ==
Newton's ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'', published by the [[Royal Society]] in 1687&lt;ref name="Newton2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sir Isaac Newton|title=The Principia: The Authoritative Translation and Guide: Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EQLWCgAAQBAJ|date=5 February 2016|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|isbn=978-0-520-96481-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not available widely and in English until after his death, is the text generally cited as revolutionary or otherwise radical in the development of science.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The three books of ''Principia'', considered a seminal text in mathematics and physics, are notable for their rejection of hypotheses in favor of inductive and deductive reasoning based on a set of definitions and axioms. This method may be contrasted to the [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] method of deduction based on sequential logical reasoning, and showed the efficacy of applying mathematical analysis as a means of making discoveries about the natural world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Newton's other seminal work was ''[[Opticks]]'', printed in 1704 in ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]'', of which he became president in 1703. The treatise, which features his now famous work on the composition and dispersion of sunlight, is often cited as an example of how to analyze difficult questions via quantitative experimentation. Even so, the work was not considered revolutionary in Newton's time.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/265462302|title=The Newtonian revolution : with illustrations of the transformation of scientific ideas|last=Bernard.|first=Cohen, Ierome|date=2002-01-01|publisher=[[Cambridge Univ. Press]]|isbn=9780521273800|oclc=265462302}}&lt;/ref&gt; One hundred years later, however, [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] would describe Newton's observations in ''Opticks''  as "yet unrivalled... they only rise in our estimation as we compare them with later attempts to improve on them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=Thomas|date=1802-01-01|title=The Bakerian Lecture: On the Theory of Light and Colours|url=http://rstl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/92/12|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London|language=en|volume=92|pages=12–48|doi=10.1098/rstl.1802.0004|issn=0261-0523}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42968133|title=The foundations of Newtonian scholarship|last=1925-2006.|first=Dalitz, R.

== Mathematical philosophy ==
The first edition of ''Principia'' features proposals about the movements of celestial bodies which Newton initially calls "hypotheses"—however, by the second edition, the word "hypothesis" was replaced by the word "rule", and Newton had added to the footnotes the following statement:&lt;blockquote&gt;... I frame no hypotheses. For whatever is not deduced from the phenomena is to be called a hypothesis; and hypotheses, whether metaphysical or physical, whether of occult qualities or mechanical, have no place in experimental philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/941275050|title=Newtonian Studies|date=1965-01-01|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|isbn=0674181859|oclc=941275050}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Newton's work and the philosophy that enshrines it are based on mathematical [[empiricism]], which is the idea that mathematical and physical laws may be revealed in the real world via experimentation and observation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is important to note, however, that Newton's empiricism is balanced against an adherence to an exact mathematical system, and that in many cases the "observed phenomena" upon which Newton built his  theories were actually based on mathematical models, which were representative but not identical to the natural phenomena they described.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Newtonian doctrine can be contrasted with several alternative sets of principles and methods such as [[Cartesianism]], [[Leibnizianism]] and [[Wolffianism]].

== Newton's other beliefs ==
Despite his reputation for empiricism in historical and scientific circles, Newton was deeply religious and believed in the literal truth of [[Religious text|Scripture]], taking the story of [[Genesis creation narrative|Genesis]] to be Moses' eyewitness account of the creation of the solar system. Newton reconciled his beliefs by adopting the idea that the Christian God set in place at the beginning of time the "mechanical" laws of nature, but retained the power to enter and alter that mechanism at any time.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/827177278|title=Newton and Newtonianism : new studies|last=E.|first=Force, James|last2=1948-|first2=Hutton, Sarah,|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Kluwer Academic|isbn=9781402022388|oclc=827177278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton further believed that the preservation of nature was in itself an act of God, stating that "a continual miracle is needed to prevent the Sun and fixed stars from rushing together through Gravity".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://name.umdl.umich.edu/A65672.0001.001|title=A new theory of the earth, from its original to the consummation of all things wherein the creation of the world in six days, the universal deluge, and the general conflagration, as laid down in the Holy Scriptures, are shewn to be perfectly agreeable to reason and philosophy : with a large introductory discourse concerning the genuine nature, stile, and extent of the Mosaick history of the creation / by William Whiston ...|website=name.umdl.umich.edu|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Inconnu, portrait de madame Du Châtelet à sa table de travail, détail (château de Breteuil) -002.jpg|thumb|Portrait of French physicist and Newtonian Émilie du Châtelet]]

Between 1726 and 1729, French author, philosopher, and historian [[Voltaire]] was exiled in England, where he met several significant English scholars and devotees to the Newtonian system of thought. Voltaire would later bring these ideas back to France with his publication of ''Lettres Philosophiques'' and ''Philosophie de Newton'',  which popularized Newton's intellectual practices and general philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Newtonian Science|last=Bell|first=Arthur E.|publisher=Edward Arnold|year=1961|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, prominent natural philosopher and friend of Voltaire, [[Émilie du Châtelet]], would publish a French translation of ''Principia'', which met with great success in France.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

While Newton was opposed by some members of the religious community for his non-Trinitarian beliefs about God, others believed science itself to be a philosophical exercise, that if done correctly, would lead its practitioners to a greater knowledge and appreciation of God.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/469855126|title=Newtonianism for the ladies and other uneducated souls : the popularization of science in Leipzig, 1687-1750|last=R.|first=Rogers, Moira|date=2003-01-01|publisher=P. Lang|isbn=0820450294|oclc=469855126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1737, Italian scholar Count [[Francesco Algarotti|Frencesco Algarotti]] published a book entitled ''Newtonianismo per le dame overro dialoghi sopre la luce e i colori'', which aimed to introduce female audiences to the work of Newton. The text explained the principles of Newton's ''Opticks'' while avoiding much of the mathematical rigor of the work in favor of a more "agreeable" text. The book was later published with a title that made no reference to women, leading some to believe that the female branding of the book was a ploy to avoid censorship.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Influence on other scholars ==

Scottish philosopher [[David Hume]], likely inspired by the methods of analysis and synthesis which Newton developed in ''Opticks'', was a strong adherent of Newtonian empiricism in his studies of moral phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/960722703|title=David Hume and the culture of Scottish Newtonianism : methodology and ideology in Enlightenment inquiry|last=1975-|first=Demeter, Tamás,|publisher=Brill|isbn=9789004327313|oclc=960722703}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton and his philosophy of Newtonianism arguably led to the popularization of science in Europe—particularly in England, France,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and Germany&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;—catalyzing the [[Age of Enlightenment]].

&lt;!-- FAIR USE of NikeGrindLogo.png: low resolution copy of the grind program logo --&gt;

'''Nike Grind''' is part of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]'s Reuse-A-Shoe program that was started in 1993. The purpose of the program is to eliminate waste and close the loop on Nike's [[Product life-cycle management (marketing)#Product life cycle (PLC)|product lifecycle]] by collecting post-consumer, non-metal-containing athletic shoes of any brand. This includes Nike shoes that are returned due to material or workmanship defects.

==Recycling Process==
Once collected, the sneakers are ground up and separated into three distinct types of material: [[rubber]] from the outsole, foam from the midsole and fabric from the shoe's upper. Nike and its partners (Atlas Track &amp; Tennis, Playtop, Training Ground, Everlast and [[Rebound Ace]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Partners | work=Let Me Play | url= http://www.letmeplay.com/reuseashoe/grind/partners}}&lt;/ref&gt; take the granulated rubber and create [[soccer]], [[American football|football]], [[baseball]] fields, [[weight room]] flooring and running tracks. The first synthetic turf soccer field installed with Nike Grind rubber was Douglas Park in Chicago. That surface was donated by Nike and the U.S. Soccer Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csrwire.com/News/3151.html |title=Gold Medal Soccer Stars Mia Hamm &amp; Briana Scurry Help NikeGO and The U.S. Soccer Foundation Dedicate Chicago Soccer Field|work=Corporate Social Responsibility News|accessdate=2004-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nike uses the granulated foam from the shoes for synthetic [[basketball]] courts, [[tennis]] courts and playground surfacing tiles. The granulated fabric from the shoe uppers becomes the padding under hardwood basketball floors.

These programs are located in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Japan]], [[United Kingdom]], and [[United States]].

==Processing==

There are two Nike Grind processing plants, one located in the United States and the other in Belgium. The American facility uses a "slice and grind" technique, where each shoe is cut into three slices that contain the main materials. These slices are fed through grinders and purified to become the different types of material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Nike Partnership: A Perfect Fit For ECORE | work=ECORE International | url=http://www.ecoreintl.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Belgian facility grinds the shoes whole, and passes the resulting material through a series of separators for the same three groups of material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Nike Kicks Off Shoe Recycling Program | work=Sportswear International | url= http://www.sportswearnet.com/marketnews/pages/show.prl?params=&amp;id=530&amp;currPage=16&amp;ori=find }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Sulfur-hexafluoride-3D-vdW.png|thumb|left|200px|Structure of [[sulfur hexafluoride]], an example of a molecule with the octahedral coordination geometry.]]
In [[chemistry]], '''octahedral molecular geometry''' describes the shape of compounds with six atoms or groups of atoms or [[ligand]]s symmetrically arranged around a central atom, defining the vertices of an [[octahedron]]. The octahedron has eight faces, hence the [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] ''[[wiktionary:octa-|octa]]''. The octahedron is one of the [[Platonic solid]]s, although octahedral molecules typically have an atom in their centre and no bonds between the ligand atoms. A perfect octahedron belongs to the [[point group]] O&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;. Examples of octahedral compounds are [[sulfur hexafluoride]] SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and [[molybdenum hexacarbonyl]] Mo(CO)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. The term "octahedral" is used somewhat loosely by chemists, focusing on the geometry of the bonds to the central atom and not considering differences among the ligands themselves. For example, [[Cobalt(III) hexammine chloride|[Co(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;]], which is not octahedral in the mathematical sense due to the orientation of the N-H bonds, is referred to as octahedral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Von Zelewsky|first=A.|title=Stereochemistry of Coordination Compounds|publisher=John Wiley|location=Chichester|date=1995|ISBN=0-471-95599-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of octahedral coordination geometry was developed by [[Alfred Werner]] to explain the stoichiometries and isomerism in [[coordination compound]]s. His insight allowed chemists to rationalize the number of isomers of coordination compounds. Octahedral transition-metal complexes containing amines and simple anions are often referred to as [[Alfred Werner#Coordination chemistry|Werner-type complexes]].

== Isomerism in octahedral complexes ==
{{main|Stereochemistry}}

When two or more types of ligands (L&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;, L&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;, ...) are coordinated to an octahedral metal centre (M), the complex can exist as isomers. The naming system for these isomers depends upon the number and arrangement of different ligands.

=== ''cis'' and ''trans'' ===
For ML{{su|p=a|b=4}}L{{su|p=b|b=2}}, two isomers exist. These isomers of ML{{su|p=a|b=4}}L{{su|p=b|b=2}} are ''cis'', if the L&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; ligands are mutually adjacent, and ''trans'', if the L&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; groups are situated 180° to each other. It was the analysis of such complexes that led [[Alfred Werner]] to the 1913 Nobel Prize–winning postulation of octahedral complexes.

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Cis-dichlorotetraamminecobalt(III).png|&lt;center&gt;''cis''-[CoCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Trans-dichlorotetraamminecobalt(III).png|&lt;center&gt;''trans''-[CoCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

=== Facial and meridional isomers ===
For ML{{su|p=a|b=3}}L{{su|p=b|b=3}}, two isomers are possible - a '''facial''' isomer (''fac'') in which each set of three identical ligands occupies one face of the octahedron surrounding the metal atom, so that any two of these three ligands
are mutually cis, and a '''meridional''' isomer (''mer'') in which each set of three identical ligands occupies a plane passing through the metal atom.

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Fac-trichlorotriamminecobalt(III).png|&lt;center&gt;''fac''-[CoCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Mer-trichlorotriamminecobalt(III).png|&lt;center&gt;''mer''-[CoCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

=== Chirality ===
More complicated complexes, with several different kinds of ligands or with [[bidentate]] ligands can also be [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]], with pairs of isomers which are non-superimposable mirror images or [[enantiomer]]s of each other.

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Delta-tris(oxalato)ferrate(III)-3D-balls.png|&lt;center&gt;''Λ''-[Fe(ox)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Lambda-tris(oxalato)ferrate(III)-3D-balls.png|&lt;center&gt;''Δ''-[Fe(ox)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Delta-cis-dichlorobis(ethylenediamine)cobalt(III).png|&lt;center&gt;[[cis-Dichlorobis(ethylenediamine)cobalt(III) chloride|''Λ''-''cis''-[CoCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(en)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Lambda-cis-dichlorobis(ethylenediamine)cobalt(III).png|&lt;center&gt;''Δ''-''cis''-[CoCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(en)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

=== Other ===
For ML{{su|p=a|b=2}}L{{su|p=b|b=2}}L{{su|p=c|b=2}}, a total of six isomers are possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miessler|first1=G. L.|last2=Tarr|first2=D. A.|title=Inorganic Chemistry|edition=2nd|publisher=Prentice-Hall|date=1999|page=290|ISBN=0-13-841891-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# One isomer in which all three pairs of identical ligands are ''trans''
# Three distinct isomers in which one pair of identical ligands (L&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; ''or'' L&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; ''or'' L&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;) is ''trans'' while the other two are ''cis''. 
# Two enantiomeric chiral isomers in which all three pairs of identical ligands are ''cis''. 

The number of possible isomers can reach 30 for an octahedral complex with six different ligands (in contrast, only two stereoisomers are possible for a tetrahedral complex with four different ligands). The following table lists all possible combinations for monodentate ligands:

{| class="wikitable"
! Formula !! Number of isomers !! Number of [[enantiomer]]ic pairs
|-
| ML&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; || 1 || 0
|-
| ML{{su|p=a|b=5}}L&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; || 1 || 0
|-
| ML{{su|p=a|b=4}}L{{su|p=b|b=2}} || 2 || 0
|-
| ML{{su|p=a|b=4}}L&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt; || 2 || 0
|-
| ML{{su|p=a|b=3}}L{{su|p=b|b=3}} || 2 || 0
|-
| ML{{su|p=a|b=3}}L{{su|p=b|b=2}}L&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt; || 3 || 0
|-
| ML{{su|p=a|b=3}}L&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; || 5 || 1
|-
| ML{{su|p=a|b=2}}L{{su|p=b|b=2}}L{{su|p=c|b=2}} || 6 || 1
|-
| ML{{su|p=a|b=2}}L{{su|p=b|b=2}}L&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; || 8 || 2
|-
| ML{{su|p=a|b=2}}L&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; || 15 || 6
|-
| ML&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;f&lt;/sup&gt; || 30 || 15
|}

Thus, all 15 diastereomers of ML&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;f&lt;/sup&gt; are chiral, whereas for ML{{su|p=a|b=2}}L&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;, six diastereomers are chiral and three are not (the ones where L&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; are ''trans''). One can see that octahedral coordination allows much greater [[complexity]] than the tetrahedron that dominates [[organic chemistry]]. The tetrahedron ML&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; exists as a single enatiomeric pair. To generate two diastereomers in an organic compound, at least two carbon centers are required.

== Deviations from ideal symmetry ==
=== Jahn–Teller effect ===
{{main|Jahn–Teller effect}}
The term can also refer to octahedral influenced by the [[Jahn–Teller effect]], which is a common phenomenon encountered in [[coordination chemistry]]. This reduces the symmetry of the molecule from O&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; to D&lt;sub&gt;4h&lt;/sub&gt; and is known as a tetragonal distortion.

=== Distorted octahedral geometry ===
Some molecules, such as [[Xenon hexafluoride|XeF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] or {{chem|IF|6|−}}, have a lone pair that distorts the [[molecular symmetry|symmetry]] of the molecule from O&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; to C&lt;sub&gt;3v&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The specific geometry is known as a ''monocapped'' octahedron, since it is derived from the octahedron by placing the lone pair over the centre of one triangular face of the octahedron as a "cap".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://winter.group.shef.ac.uk/vsepr/high-cn.html |title=VSEPR and more than six electron pairs |last=Winter |first=Mark |date=2015 |website=University of Sheffield: Department of Chemistry |access-date=25 September 2018 |quote=the structure of XeF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is based upon a distorted octahedron, probably towards a monocapped octahedron}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bioctahedral structures==
Pairs of octahedra can be fused in a way that preserves the octahedral coordination geometry by replacing terminal ligands with [[bridging ligand]]s.  Two motifs for fusing octahedra are common: edge-sharing and face-sharing.  Edge- and face-shared '''bioctahedra''' have the formulas [M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;(μ-L)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(μ-L)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively. Polymeric versions of the same linking pattern give the stoichiometries [ML&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(μ-L)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; and [M(μ-L)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively.

The sharing of an edge or a face of an octahedron gives a structure called bioctahedral. Many metal penta[[halide]] and penta[[alkoxide]] compounds exist in solution and the solid with bioctahedral structures. One example is [[niobium pentachloride]]. Metal tetrahalides often exist as [[polymer]]s with edge-sharing octahedra. [[Zirconium tetrachloride]] is an example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wells|first=A.F.|date=1984|title=Structural Inorganic Chemistry|location=Oxford|publisher=Clarendon Press|ISBN=0-19-855370-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Compounds with face-sharing octahedral chains include MoBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, RuBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and TlBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

== Trigonal prismatic geometry ==
{{main|trigonal prismatic molecular geometry}}
For compounds with the formula MX&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, the chief alternative to octahedral geometry is a trigonal prismatic geometry, which has [[symmetry group|symmetry]] D&lt;sub&gt;3h&lt;/sub&gt;. In this geometry, the six ligands are also equivalent. There are also distorted trigonal prisms, with C&lt;sub&gt;3v&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry; a prominent example is [[Hexamethyl tungsten|W(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]]. The interconversion of ''Δ''- and ''Λ''-complexes, which is usually slow, is proposed to proceed via a trigonal prismatic intermediate, a process called the "[[Bailar twist]]". An alternative pathway for the [[racemization]] of these same complexes is the [[Ray–Dutt twist]].

== Splitting of the energy of the d-orbitals in octahedral complexes ==
{{main|Ligand field theory}}

For a free ion, e.g. gaseous Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; or Mo&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, the energy of the [[d-orbital]]s are equal in energy; that is, they are "degenerate". In an octahedral complex, this degeneracy is lifted. The energy of the d&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; and d&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;minus;''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;, the so-called e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; set, which are aimed directly at the ligands are destabilized. On the other hand, the energy of the d&lt;sub&gt;''xz''&lt;/sub&gt;, d&lt;sub&gt;''xy''&lt;/sub&gt;, and d&lt;sub&gt;''yz''&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals, the so-called t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt; set, are stabilized. The labels t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt; and e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; refer to [[irreducible representation]]s, which describe the symmetry properties of these orbitals. The energy gap separating these two sets is the basis of [[crystal field theory]] and the more comprehensive [[ligand field theory]]. The loss of degeneracy upon the formation of an octahedral complex from a free ion is called [[crystal field splitting]] or [[ligand field splitting]]. The energy gap is labeled ''Δ''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;, which varies according to the number and nature of the ligands. If the symmetry of the complex is lower than octahedral, the e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; and t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt; levels can split further. For example, the t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt; and e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; sets split further in ''trans''-ML{{su|p=a|b=4}}L{{su|p=b|b=2}}.

Ligand strength has the following order for these electron donors:
:'''weak:''' [[iodine]] &lt; [[bromine]] &lt; [[fluorine]] &lt; [[acetate]] &lt; [[oxalate]] &lt; [[water]] &lt; [[pyridine]] &lt; [[cyanide]] ''':strong'''

So called "weak field ligands" give rise to small ''Δ''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; and [[Absorbance|absorb]] light at longer [[wavelength]]s.

== Reactions ==

Given that a virtually uncountable variety of octahedral complexes exist, it is not surprising that a wide variety of reactions have been described. These reactions can be classified as follows:

* Ligand substitution reactions (via a variety of mechanisms)
* Ligand addition reactions, including among many, protonation
* [[Redox]] reactions (where electrons are gained or lost)
* Rearrangements where the relative stereochemistry of the ligand changes within the [[coordination sphere]].

Many reactions of octahedral transition metal complexes occur in water. When an [[anionic]] ligand replaces a coordinated water molecule the reaction is called an '''[[anation]]'''. The reverse reaction, water replacing an anionic ligand, is called [[aquation]]. For example, the [CoCl(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; slowly aquates to give [Co(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; in water, especially in the presence of acid or base. Addition of concentrated HCl converts the aquo complex back to the chloride, via an anation process.

'''Plumbosolvency''' is the ability of a [[solvent]], notably [[water]], to dissolve [[lead]]. In the public supply of water this is an undesirable property. In (usually older) consumers' premises plumbosolvent water can attack [[lead]] pipes and any lead in [[Solder#Lead_solder|solder]] used to join copper. 
Plumbosolvency of water can be countered by achieving a pH of 7.5 by increasing the [[pH]] with [[calcium hydroxide|lime]] or [[sodium hydroxide]] (lye), or by providing a protective coating to the inside of lead pipes by the addition of [[phosphate]] at the [[water treatment]] works.

While optimal pH for prevention of plumbosolvency is 7.5, performance remains very good in the range pH 7.2-7.6.
Achieving this pH has been shown to decrease population blood lead concentrations.(3, 4)

[[Water chlorination|Chlorinating]] water also reduces dissolved lead. It causes the interiors of lead pipes to become coated with [[Lead(II) chloride|lead chloride]], which is very insoluble in cold water. However, lead chloride is fairly soluble in hot water. For this reason, water that is to be used for drinking or the preparation of food should never be taken from a hot-water tap, if the water may have been in contact with lead. Water should be taken from a cold-water tap, and heated in a pan or kettle that does not contain lead or lead solder.

A '''ruby''' is a pink to blood-red colored [[gemstone]], a variety of the [[mineral]] [[corundum]] ([[aluminium oxide]]). Other varieties of gem-quality corundum are called [[sapphire]]s. Ruby is one of the traditional [[cardinal gem]]s, together with [[amethyst]], [[sapphire]], [[emerald]], and [[diamond]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=crc7ZtRHItgC&amp;pg=PA1 ''Precious Stones''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171218182752/https://books.google.com/books?id=crc7ZtRHItgC&amp;pg=PA1 |date=December 18, 2017 }}, Max Bauer, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''ruby'' comes from ''ruber'', [[Latin]] for red. The color of a ruby is due to the element [[chromium]]. 

The quality of a ruby is determined by its color, cut, and clarity, which, along with [[carat (mass)|carat]] weight, affect its value. The brightest and most valuable shade of red called blood-red or pigeon blood, commands a large premium over other rubies of similar quality. After color follows clarity: similar to diamonds, a clear stone will command a premium, but a ruby without any needle-like [[rutile]] [[Inclusion (mineral)|inclusions]] may indicate that the stone has been treated. Ruby is the traditional [[birthstone]] for July and is usually more [[pink]] than [[garnet]], although some [[rhodolite]] garnets have a similar pinkish hue to most rubies. The world's most valuable ruby is the [[Sunrise Ruby]].

==Physical properties==
[[Image:Corundum.png|thumb|left|Crystal structure of rubies]]
Rubies have a [[hardness]] of 9.0 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness]]. Among the natural gems only [[moissanite]] and [[diamond]] are harder, with diamond having a Mohs hardness of 10.0 and moissanite falling somewhere in between corundum (ruby) and diamond in hardness. Sapphire, ruby, and pure corundum are α-alumina, the most stable form of Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, in which 3 electrons leave each aluminum ion to join the regular octahedral group of six nearby O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; ions; in pure corundum this leaves all of the aluminum ions with a very stable configuration of no unpaired electrons or unfilled energy levels, and the crystal is perfectly colorless.

When a chromium atom replaces an occasional aluminum atom, it too loses 3 electrons to become a chromium&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ion to maintain the charge balance of the Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; crystal.  However, the Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions are larger and have [[Electron configuration#Ionization of the transition metals|electron orbitals]] in different directions than aluminum. The octahedral arrangement of the O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; ions is distorted, and the energy levels of the different orbitals of those Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions are slightly altered because of the directions to the O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; ions.&lt;ref name=causes&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/6AA.html | title= Ruby: causes of color | accessdate= 28 Mar 2016 | deadurl= no | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160321193313/http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/6AA.html | archivedate= March 21, 2016 | df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those energy differences correspond to absorption in the ultraviolet, violet, and yellow-green regions of the spectrum.

[[Image:Ruby transmittance.svg |thumb|Transmittance of ruby in optical and near-IR spectra. Note the two broad violet and yellow-green absorption bands and one narrow absorption band at the wavelength of 694 nm, which is the wavelength of the ruby laser.]]

If one percent of the aluminum ions are replaced by chromium in ruby, the yellow-green absorption results in a red color for the gem.&lt;ref name=causes/&gt;  Additionally, absorption at any of the above wavelengths stimulates [[fluorescence|fluorescent]] emission of 694-nanometer-wavelength red light, which adds to its red color and perceived [[Lustre (mineralogy)|luster]].

After absorbing short-wavelength light, there is a short interval of time when the crystal lattice of ruby is in an excited state before fluorescence occurs. If 694-nanometer photons pass through the crystal during that time, they can stimulate more fluorescent photons to be emitted in-phase with them, thus strengthening the intensity of that red light. By arranging mirrors or other means to pass  emitted light repeatedly through the crystal, a [[ruby laser]] in this way produces a very high intensity of [[Coherence (physics)|coherent]] red light.

All natural rubies have imperfections in them, including color impurities and inclusions of [[rutile]] needles known as "silk". Gemologists use these needle inclusions found in natural rubies to distinguish them from synthetics, simulants, or substitutes. Usually, the rough stone is heated before cutting. These days, almost all rubies are treated in some form, with heat treatment being the most common practice. Untreated rubies of high quality command a large premium.

Some rubies show a three-point or six-point [[asterism (gemmology)|asterism]] or "star". These rubies are cut into [[cabochons]] to display the effect properly. Asterisms are best visible with a single-light source and move across the stone as the light moves or the stone is rotated. Such effects occur when light is reflected off the "silk" (the structurally oriented [[rutile]] needle inclusions) in a certain way. This is one example where inclusions increase the value of a gemstone. Furthermore, rubies can show color changes—though this occurs very rarely—as well as [[chatoyancy]] or the "cat's eye" effect.

===Ruby vs. pink sapphire===
Generally, gemstone-quality corundum in all shades of red, including pink, are called rubies.&lt;ref name="matlins"&gt;{{cite book|last=Matlins|first=Antoinette Leonard|title=Colored Gemstones|year=2010|publisher=Gemstone Press|isbn=0-943763-72-X|page=203|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4UANp6MCTSQC|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502140108/https://books.google.com/books?id=4UANp6MCTSQC|archivedate=May 2, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reed|first=Peter|title=Gemmology|year=1991|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|isbn=0-7506-6449-5|page=337|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t-OQO3Wk-JsC|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102012607/https://books.google.com/books?id=t-OQO3Wk-JsC|archivedate=January 2, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in the United States, a minimum color saturation must be met to be called a ruby; otherwise, the stone will be called a [[sapphire|pink sapphire]].&lt;ref name="matlins" /&gt;  Drawing a distinction between rubies and pink sapphires is relatively new, having arisen sometime in the 20th century. Often, the distinction between ruby and pink sapphire is not clear and can be debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wise|first=Richard G|title=Gemstone Connoisseurship; The Finer Points, Part II|url=http://www.secretsofthegemtrade.com/articles_5_2.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426082627/http://www.secretsofthegemtrade.com/articles_5_2.htm|archivedate=April 26, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of the difficulty and subjectiveness of such distinctions, trade organizations such as the [[International Colored Gemstone Association]] (ICGA) have adopted the broader definition for ruby which encompasses its lighter shades, including pink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hughes|first=Richard W.|title=Walking the line in ruby &amp; sapphire|url=http://www.ruby-sapphire.com/ruby_sapphire_borders.htm|publisher=ruby-sapphire.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113084826/http://www.ruby-sapphire.com/ruby_sapphire_borders.htm|archivedate=January 13, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Federman|first=David|title=Pink Sapphire|url=http://www.modernjeweler.com/web/online/Colored-Gemstone-Gem-Profiles/Pink-Sapphire/1$530|publisher=Modern Jeweler|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131101220/http://www.modernjeweler.com/web/online/Colored-Gemstone-Gem-Profiles/Pink-Sapphire/1$530|archivedate=January 31, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural occurrence==
The [[Mogok]] Valley in Upper [[Myanmar]] (Burma) was for centuries the world's main source for rubies. That region has produced some exceptional rubies, however in recent years few good rubies have been found. In central Myanmar, the area of Mong Hsu began producing rubies during the 1990s and rapidly became the world's main ruby mining area. The most recently found ruby deposit in Myanmar is in Namya (Namyazeik) located in the northern state of [[Kachin State|Kachin]].

Historically, rubies have also been mined in Thailand, in the [[Pailin]] and [[Samlout District]] of Cambodia, as well as in Afghanistan, Australia, Brazil, Colombia, India,  Namibia, Japan, and Scotland; after the [[Second World War]] ruby deposits were found in Madagascar, Nepal, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Tanzania, and Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gemsociety.org/article/ruby-sapphire-identifying-origin-understanding-value-rarity-gem-corundum/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230213525/http://www.gemsociety.org/article/ruby-sapphire-identifying-origin-understanding-value-rarity-gem-corundum/ |archivedate=December 30, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Sri Lanka, lighter shades of rubies (often "pink sapphires") are more commonly found. The Republic of Macedonia is the only country in mainland Europe to have naturally occurring rubies. They can mainly be found around the city of [[Prilep]]. Macedonian rubies have a unique raspberry color. The ruby is also included on the Macedonian coat of arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=This is the New Coat of Arms of Republic of Macedonia - Independent.mk|url=http://www.independent.mk/articles/12107/This+is+the+New+Coat+of+Arms+of+Republic+of+Macedonia|accessdate=30 March 2017|work=Independent.mk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330175849/http://www.independent.mk/articles/12107/This+is+the+New+Coat+of+Arms+of+Republic+of+Macedonia|archivedate=March 30, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few rubies have been found in the U.S. states of [[Montana]], [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]] and [[Wyoming]].

[[Spinel]], another red gemstone, is sometimes found along with rubies in the same gem gravel or marble. Red spinels may be mistaken for rubies by those lacking experience with gems. However, the finest red spinels can have values approaching that of an average ruby.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Wenk, Hans-Rudolf |author2=Bulakh, A. G. |title=Minerals: their constitution and origin|year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, U.K. |isbn=0-521-52958-1 |pages=539–541 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=0GAvKQJ2JuwC&amp;pg=RA1-PA541}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors affecting value==
Rubies, as with other gemstones, are graded using criteria known as the four Cs, namely color, cut, clarity and carat weight. Rubies are also evaluated on the basis of their geographic origin.

'''Color:''' In the evaluation of colored gemstones, color is the most important factor. Color divides into three components: ''hue'', ''saturation'' and ''tone''. Hue refers to color as we normally use the term. Transparent gemstones occur in the ''pure spectral hues'' of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet.&lt;ref name=wise&gt;{{cite book|author=Wise, Richard W. |title=Secrets Of The Gem Trade, The Connoisseur's Guide To Precious Gemstones |pages=18–22 |isbn=0-9728223-8-0 |year=2006|publisher=Brunswick House Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In nature, there are rarely pure hues, so when speaking of the hue of a gemstone, we speak of primary and secondary and sometimes tertiary hues. Ruby is defined to be red. All other hues of the gem species corundum are called sapphire. Ruby may exhibit a range of secondary hues, including orange, purple, violet, and pink.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The finest ruby is described as being a vivid medium-dark toned red. Secondary hues add an additional complication. Pink, orange, and purple are the normal secondary hues in ruby. Of the three, purple is preferred because it reinforces the red, making it appear richer.&lt;ref name=wise/&gt; Purple also occupies a position on the color wheel halfway between red and blue. When a purplish-red ruby is set in yellow, the yellow neutralizes its complement blue, leaving the stone appearing to be pure red in the setting.{{Original research inline|date=September 2017}}

==Treatments and enhancements==
Improving the quality of gemstones by treating them is common practice. Some treatments are used in almost all cases and are therefore considered acceptable. During the late 1990s, a large supply of low-cost materials caused a sudden surge in supply of heat-treated rubies, leading to a downward pressure on ruby prices.

Improvements used include color alteration, improving transparency by dissolving rutile inclusions, healing of fractures (cracks) or even completely filling them.

The most common treatment is the application of heat. Most rubies at the lower end of the market are heat treated to improve color, remove ''purple tinge'', blue patches, and silk. These heat treatments typically occur around temperatures of 1800&amp;nbsp;°C (3300&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref name="ThemelisRubyHeat"&gt;{{cite book|isbn=0940965100|title=The Heat Treatment of Ruby and Sapphire|publisher=Gemlab Inc.|place=Bangkok, Thailand|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some rubies undergo a process of low tube heat, when the stone is heated over charcoal of a temperature of about 1300&amp;nbsp;°C (2400&amp;nbsp;°F) for 20 to 30 minutes. The silk is partially broken, and the color is improved.

Another treatment, which has become more frequent in recent years, is lead glass filling. Filling the fractures inside the ruby with [[lead glass]] (or a similar material) dramatically improves the transparency of the stone, making previously unsuitable rubies fit for applications in jewelry.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Pardieu [http://www.fieldgemology.org/Ruby_lead_glass_treatment.pdf Lead Glass Filled/Repaired Rubies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831062843/http://www.fieldgemology.org/Ruby_lead_glass_treatment.pdf |date=August 31, 2011 }}. Asian Institute of Gemological Sciences Gem Testing Laboratory. February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The process is done in four steps:

# The rough stones are pre-polished to eradicate all surface impurities that may affect the process
# The rough is cleaned with [[hydrogen fluoride]]
# The first heating process during which no fillers are added. The heating process eradicates impurities inside the fractures. Although this can be done at temperatures up to 1400&amp;nbsp;°C (2500&amp;nbsp;°F) it most likely occurs at a temperature of around 900&amp;nbsp;°C (1600&amp;nbsp;°F) since the rutile silk is still intact.
# The second heating process in an electrical oven with different chemical additives. Different solutions and mixes have shown to be successful, however mostly lead-containing glass-powder is used at present. The ruby is dipped into oils, then covered with powder, embedded on a tile and placed in the oven where it is heated at around 900&amp;nbsp;°C (1600&amp;nbsp;°F) for one hour in an oxidizing atmosphere. The orange colored powder transforms upon heating into a transparent to yellow-colored paste, which fills all fractures. After cooling the color of the paste is fully transparent and dramatically improves the overall transparency of the ruby.&lt;ref&gt;Richard W. Hughes (1997), ''Ruby &amp; Sapphire,'' Boulder, CO, RWH Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0-9645097-6-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a color needs to be added, the glass powder can be "enhanced" with copper or other metal oxides as well as elements such as sodium, calcium, potassium etc.

The second heating process can be repeated three to four times, even applying different mixtures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Milisenda| first=C C| title=Rubine mit bleihaltigen Glasern gefullt| journal=Zeitschrift der Deutschen Gemmologischen Gesellschaft| volume=54 |issue=1| pages=35–41|publisher=Deutschen Gemmologischen Gesellschaft|year=2005|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; When jewelry containing rubies is heated (for repairs) it should not be coated with boracic acid or any other substance, as this can etch the surface; it does not have to be "protected" like a diamond.

The treatment can identified by noting bubbles in cavities and fractures using a 10x loupe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= GIA Global Dispatch |publisher= Gemological Institute of America |year= 2012 |url= http://www.gia.edu/research-resources/news-from-research/gia-global-dispatch/index.html |title= Lead Glass-Filled Rubies |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120614070635/http://www.gia.edu/research-resources/news-from-research/gia-global-dispatch/index.html |archivedate= June 14, 2012 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synthetic and imitation rubies==

In 1837, Gaudin made the first synthetic rubies by fusing potash [[potassium alum|alum]] at a high temperature with a little chromium as a pigment. In 1847, [[Jacques-Joseph Ebelmen|Ebelmen]] made white sapphire by fusing [[alumina]] in boric acid. In 1877, Frenic and Freil made crystal [[corundum]] from which small stones could be cut. Frimy and [[Auguste Verneuil]] manufactured artificial ruby by fusing BaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with a little chromium at [[Incandescence|red heat]]. In 1903, Verneuil announced he could produce synthetic rubies on a commercial scale using this [[flame fusion]] process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/bahadur_handbook_of_precious_stones/page_067|title = Bahadur: a Handbook of Precious Stones|year = 1943|accessdate = 2007-08-19|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927020704/http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/bahadur_handbook_of_precious_stones/page_067|archivedate = September 27, 2007|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1910, Verneuil's laboratory had expanded into a 30 furnace production facility, with annual gemstone production having reached {{convert|1000|kg|lb|-3}} in 1907.

Other processes in which synthetic rubies can be produced are through Czochralski's [[Czochralski process|pulling process]], flux process, and the [[hydrothermal synthesis|hydrothermal process]]. Most synthetic rubies originate from flame fusion, due to the low costs involved. Synthetic rubies may have no imperfections visible to the naked eye but magnification may reveal curves, [[striae]] and gas bubbles. The fewer the number and the less obvious the imperfections, the more valuable the ruby is; unless there are no imperfections (i.e., a perfect ruby), in which case it will be suspected of being artificial. [[Dopant]]s are added to some manufactured rubies so they can be identified as synthetic, but most need [[gemology|gemological]] testing to determine their origin.

Synthetic rubies have technological uses as well as gemological ones. Rods of synthetic ruby are used to make [[ruby laser]]s and [[maser]]s. The first working laser was made by [[Theodore Maiman|Theodore H. Maiman]] in 1960.&lt;ref name="maiman"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Maiman |first=T.H. |authorlink=Theodore Harold Maiman |year=1960 |title=Stimulated optical radiation in ruby |journal=Nature|volume=187 |issue=4736 |pages=493–494 |doi=10.1038/187493a0 |bibcode=1960Natur.187..493M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maiman used a solid-state light-pumped synthetic ruby to produce red laser light at a wavelength of 694 nanometers (nm). Ruby lasers are still in use. Rubies are also used in applications where high hardness is required such as at wear exposed locations in modern mechanical clockworks, or as scanning probe tips in a [[coordinate measuring machine]].

[[Imitation]] rubies are also marketed. Red [[spinel]]s, red [[garnet]]s, and colored glass have been falsely claimed to be rubies. Imitations go back to Roman times and already in the 17th century techniques were developed to color foil red—by burning scarlet wool in the bottom part of the furnace—which was then placed under the imitation stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/nicols-history-gemstones/page_036|title = Thomas Nicols: A Lapidary or History of Gemstones|year = 1652|accessdate = 2007-08-19|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070819165714/http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/nicols-history-gemstones/page_036|archivedate = August 19, 2007|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trade terms such as [[balas ruby]] for red spinel and [[rubellite]] for red [[tourmaline]] can mislead unsuspecting buyers. Such terms are therefore discouraged from use by many gemological associations such as the Laboratory Manual Harmonisation Committee (LMHC).

==Records and famous rubies==

* The Smithsonian's [[National Museum of Natural History]] in Washington, D.C. has some of the world's largest and finest ruby gemstones. The {{convert|23.1|carat|g}} Burmese ruby, set in a platinum ring with diamonds, was donated by businessman and philanthropist [[Peter Buck (restaurateur)|Peter Buck]] in memory of his late wife Carmen Lúcia. This gemstone displays a richly saturated red color combined with an exceptional transparency. The finely proportioned cut provides vivid red reflections. The stone was mined from the [[Mogok]] region of [[Burma]] (now [[Myanmar]]) in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mnh.si.edu/exhibits/ruby/index.htm |title=The Carmen Lúcia Ruby |accessdate=2008-02-28 |work=Exhibitions |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309050010/http://www.mnh.si.edu/exhibits/ruby/index.htm |archivedate=March 9, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sinclair C5''' is a small one-person [[battery electric vehicle|battery electric]] [[velomobile]], technically an "electrically assisted pedal cycle".&lt;ref name="AK188"&gt;{{cite book | title=Sinclair and the 'Sunrise' Technology | last1=Adamson | first1=Ian | last2=Kennedy | first2=Richard | page=188 | publisher=Penguin Books | location=Harmondsworth, Middlesex | date=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the culmination of Sir [[Clive Sinclair]]'s long-running interest in electric vehicles. Although widely described as an "electric car", Sinclair characterised it as a "vehicle, not a car".&lt;ref name="Guardian-13-Jan-85" /&gt;

Sinclair had become one of the UK's best-known millionaires, and earned a [[knight]]hood, on the back of the highly successful [[Sinclair Research]] range of home computers in the early 1980s. He hoped to repeat his success in the electric vehicle market, which he saw as ripe for a new approach. The C5 emerged from an earlier project to produce a small electric car called the C1. After a change in the law, prompted by lobbying from bicycle manufacturers, Sinclair developed the C5 as an electrically powered tricycle with a [[polypropylene]] body and a chassis designed by [[Lotus Cars]]. It was intended to be the first in a series of increasingly ambitious electric vehicles, but in the event the planned development of the follow-up C10 and C15 electric cars never got further than the drawing board.

On 10 January 1985, the C5 was unveiled at a glitzy launch event but it received a less than enthusiastic reception from the British media. Its sales prospects were blighted by poor reviews and safety concerns expressed by consumer and motoring organisations. The vehicle's limitations – a short range, a maximum speed of only {{convert|15|mph}}, a battery that ran down quickly and a lack of weatherproofing – made it impractical for most people's needs. It was marketed as an alternative to cars and bicycles, but ended up appealing to neither group of owners, and it was not available in shops until several months after its launch. Within three months of the launch, production had been slashed by 90%. Sales never picked up despite Sinclair's optimistic forecasts and production ceased entirely by August 1985. Out of 14,000 C5s made, only 5,000 were sold before its manufacturer, [[Sinclair Vehicles]], went into receivership.

The C5 became known as "one of the great marketing bombs of postwar British industry"&lt;ref name="GandM"&gt;{{cite news|title=The rise and fall of a British electronics wizard|last=Fraser|first=John|work=The Globe and Mail|location=Toronto, Canada|date=9 April 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a "notorious&amp;nbsp;... example of failure".&lt;ref name="Cross"&gt;{{cite book|title=Engineering Design Methods: Strategies for Product Design|last=Cross|first=Nigel|authorlink=Nigel Cross|page=210|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|date=2008|isbn=978-0-470-51926-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its commercial failure, the C5 went on to become a cult item for collectors. Thousands of unsold C5s were purchased by investors and sold for hugely inflated prices – as much as £5,000, compared to the original retail value of £399. Enthusiasts have established owners' clubs and some have modified their vehicles substantially, adding monster wheels, jet engines, and high-powered electric motors to propel their C5s at speeds of up to {{convert|150|mph}}.

==Design==

[[File:Sinclair C5 rear view.jpg|right|thumb|C5 seen from the rear, showing the driver's cockpit and the open luggage compartment at the rear]]
The C5 is made predominately of polypropylene, measuring {{convert|174.4|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|74.4|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide, and {{convert|79.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} high. It weighs approximately {{convert|30|kg|abbr=on}} without a battery and {{convert|45|kg|abbr=on}} with one.&lt;ref name="Brochure" /&gt; The chassis consists of a single Y-shaped steel component with a cross-section of about {{convert|5.5|cm|abbr=on}} by {{convert|4|cm|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="NewScientist-17-Jan-85" /&gt; The vehicle has three wheels, one of {{convert|317|mm|in|abbr=on}} diameter at the front and two of {{convert|406|mm|in|abbr=on}} at the rear.&lt;ref name="Brochure" /&gt;

The driver sits in a recumbent position in an open cockpit, steering via a handlebar that is located under the knees. A power switch and front and rear brake levers are positioned on the handlebar. As a supplement to or replacement for electric power, the C5 can also be propelled via bicycle-style pedals located at the front of the cockpit. The maximum speed of an unmodified C5 is {{convert|15|mph}}. At the rear of the vehicle is a small luggage compartment with a capacity of 28 litres (1 cu ft).&lt;ref name="Brochure"&gt;''Sinclair C5. A new power in personal transport.'' Sinclair Vehicles promotional brochure (January 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; As the C5 does not have a reverse gear, reversing direction is done by getting out, picking up the front end and turning it around by hand.&lt;ref name="GM-11-Jan-1985"&gt;{{cite news|title=Electric tricycle stirs complaints in U.K.|work=The Globe and Mail|location=Toronto, Canada|date=11 January 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The C5 is powered by a 12-volt lead-acid electric battery driving a motor with a continuous rating of 250 watts and a maximum speed of 4,100 [[revolutions per minute]]. It is coupled with a two-stage gear-drive that increases [[torque]] by a factor of 13, without which the motor would not be able to move the vehicle when a person is on board. However, the motor is vulnerable to overheating. The torque increases as the load on the vehicle increases, for instance by going up too steep a gradient.&lt;ref name="NewScientist-17-Jan-85" /&gt; Sinclair's tests showed that it could cope under power with a maximum slope of 1 in 12 (8%) and could manage a 1 in 7 (14%) slope using the pedals.&lt;ref name="Times-9-Feb-1985"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sinclair C5 goes into top gear|work=The Times|date=9 February 1985|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the speed of the motor reduces, the current flow through its [[Electromagnetic coil|windings]] increases, drawing up to 140 [[Amperes|amp]]s at stall speed. This would very quickly burn the motor out if sustained, so the motor's load is constantly monitored by the C5's electronics. If it stalls under full load the electronics disable the motor after 4 seconds, while if it is under heavy load (around 80 or 90 amps) it trips after two or three minutes. A heat-sensitive [[resistor]] inside the motor warns the driver if the vehicle is beginning to overheat and disconnects the motor after a short time, and a third line of defence is provided by a metallic strip mounted on the motor. If an excessive temperature is reached the strip distorts and the power is disconnected.&lt;ref name="NewScientist-17-Jan-85"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o3lsjRekUrcC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=%22pedal+power+saves+sinclair%27s+motor%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JoQLVMfpOOyf7Aaeu4GYBQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22pedal%20power%20saves%20sinclair's%20motor%22&amp;f=false|title=Pedal power saves Sinclair's motor|last=Fox|first=Barry|work=New Scientist|page=23|date=17 January 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it was usually billed as an electric vehicle, the C5 also depends significantly on pedal power. The vehicle's battery is designed to provide 35 amps for an hour when fully charged or half that for two hours, giving the C5 a claimed range of {{convert|20|mi}}.&lt;ref name="NewScientist-17-Jan-85" /&gt; A display in the cockpit uses green, amber, and red [[LED]]s to display the state of the battery charge. The segments are extinguished one after the other to indicate how much driving time is left. The last light indicates that only ten minutes of power are left, after which the motor is switched off and the driver is left to rely on the pedals. Another display indicates via green, amber, and red LEDs how much current is being used. The C5 is in its most economical running mode when a low amount of current, indicated by the green LEDs, is being used. When the lights are red, the motor is under a high load and the driver needs to use pedal power to avoid overheating and shutdown.&lt;ref name="Dale159"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sinclair Story|last=Dale|first=Rodney|page=159|publisher=Duckworth|location=London|isbn=978-0-7156-1901-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The C5 was initially sold at a cost of £399, but to keep the cost under the £400 mark a number of components were sold as optional accessories.&lt;ref name="Dale170"&gt;Dale, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; These included indicator lights, mirrors, mud flaps, a horn, and a "High-Vis Mast" consisting of a reflective strip on a pole, designed to make the C5 more visible in traffic. Sinclair's C5 accessories brochure noted that "the British climate isn't always ideal for wind-in-the-hair driving" and offered a range of waterproofs to keep C5 drivers dry in the vehicle's open cockpit. Other accessories included seat cushions and spare batteries.&lt;ref&gt;"Sinclair C5 Accessories". Sinclair Vehicles promotional brochure (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
Sir Clive Sinclair's interest in the possibilities of electric vehicles originated in the late 1950s during a holiday job for the electronics company Solatron. Fifteen years later, in the early 1970s, he was the head of his own successful electronics company, [[Sinclair Radionics]], based in [[St Ives, Cambridgeshire|St Ives]] in [[Cambridgeshire]]. He tasked one of his employees, [[Chris Curry]] – later a co-founder of [[Acorn Computers]] – to carry out some preliminary research into electric vehicle design.&lt;ref name="Dale151" /&gt;

Sinclair took the view that an electric vehicle needed to be designed from the ground up, completely rethinking the principles of automotive design rather than simply dropping electric components into an established model. He believed that the motor was the key to the design. Sinclair and Curry developed a wafer-thin motor that was mounted on a child's scooter, with a button on the handlebars to activate it. The research got no further, however, as Sinclair's development of the first "slimline" pocket calculator – the [[Sinclair Executive]] and its successors – took precedence. No further work on electric vehicles took place for most of the rest of the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Dale151"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Sinclair Story | last=Dale | first=Rodney | page=151 | publisher=Gerard Duckworth | location=London | year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early development: the C1===
It was not until late 1979 that Sinclair returned to electric vehicle development. Around Christmas that year, he approached Tony Wood Rogers, an ex-Radionics employee, to carry out consultancy work on "a preliminary investigation into a personal electric vehicle".&lt;ref name="Dale152" /&gt; The brief was to assess the options for producing a one-person vehicle which would be a replacement for a moped and would have a maximum speed of {{convert|30|mph}}. Although Wood Rogers was initially reluctant, he was intrigued by the idea of an electric vehicle and agreed to help Sinclair.&lt;ref name="Burton100"&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Electric Cars|last=Burton|first=Nigel|publisher=Crowood|year=2013|page=100|isbn=978-1-84797-571-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vehicle was dubbed the C1 (the C standing for Clive). He built a number of prototypes to demonstrate various design principles and clarify the final specifications.&lt;ref name="Dale152"&gt;Dale, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;

A specification of the C1 emerged by the end of the year. It would address short-distance transportation needs, with a minimum range of {{convert|30|miles}} on a fully charged battery. This reflected official figures showing that the average daily car journey was only {{convert|13|mi}}, while the average [[moped]] or pedal cycle journey was just {{convert|6|mi}}. The users were envisaged as being housewives, urban commuters, and young people, who might otherwise use cycles or mopeds to travel. The electric vehicle would be safer, more weather-proof, and would offer space to carry items. It would be easy to drive and park and for the driver to enter or exit, and it would require minimum maintenance. The vehicle would be engineered for simplicity using [[Injection moulding|injection-moulded]] plastic components and a polypropylene body. It would also be much cheaper than a car, costing £500 (now £{{Inflation|UK|500|1985|r=-2}}) at the most.&lt;ref name="Dale152-3"&gt;Dale, p. 152–3&lt;/ref&gt;

One area of development that Sinclair purposely avoided was battery technology. Electric vehicles powered by lead-acid batteries had once actually outnumbered internal combustion engine vehicles; in 1912 nearly 34,000 electric cars were registered in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Advanced Components for Electric and Hybrid Electric Vehicles: Workshop Proceedings|publisher=DIANE Publishing|year=1995|p=26|isbn=978-0-7881-1621-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M-WSfM38jccC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=1912+34000+electric+vehicle&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IjR9mU704C&amp;sig=NHwsXxGxJXKm28oXHhAe3FgKov0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VBSUVOnkHMWbyATs1YLYCQ&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=1912%2034000%20electric%20vehicle&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the efficiency of internal combustion engines greatly improved while battery technology advanced much more slowly, leading to petrol and diesel-driven vehicles dominating the market.&lt;ref name="AK184"&gt;Adamson &amp; Kennedy, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; By 1978, out of 17.6 million registered vehicles on Britain's roads, only 45,000 were electric vehicles in day-to-day use and of those, 90% were [[milkfloat]]s.&lt;ref name="Burton101"&gt;Burton, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; Sinclair chose to rely on existing lead-acid battery technology, avoiding the great expense of developing a more efficient type. His rationale was that if the electric vehicle market took off, battery manufacturers would step up to develop better batteries.&lt;ref name="Dale154"&gt;Dale, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; Wood Rogers recalls:

{{quote|We were stuck with the standard technology of the time. A car battery was out of the question because it couldn't stand constant charge/discharge cycles, a [[traction battery]], similar to the kind used in milk floats, could be recharged from flat and a semi-traction battery, often used by caravanners, offered a good compromise. Sadly, though, we had very little freedom of choice.&lt;ref name="Burton101" /&gt;}}

The development programme moved to the [[University of Exeter]] in 1982, where the C1 chassis was fitted with fibreglass shells and tested in a wind tunnel. It was recognised at an early stage that the vehicle would have to be aerodynamic; although it was only ever intended to be small and relatively slow, reducing wind resistance was seen as essential for the vehicle's efficiency.&lt;ref name="Dale154" /&gt; By March 1982 the basic design of the C1 had been established.&lt;ref name="Marks1989" /&gt; Sinclair then turned to an established motor design company, Ogle Design of [[Letchworth]], to provide professional styling assistance and production engineering. However, Ogle's approach was not to Sinclair's liking; they tackled the project as one of car design and focused more (and expensively) on the aerodynamics rather than the cycle technology around which the C1 was based. The weight of the vehicle increased to over {{convert|150|kg}}, far more than Sinclair's desired specification. By March 1983, Sinclair and Wood Rogers had decided to stop the C1 programme.&lt;ref name="Dale155"&gt;Dale, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; Wood Rogers comments that Ogle were convinced that the C1 would be a flop, telling Sinclair that it would not be fast enough, that its drivers would get wet when it rained and that the battery was not good enough.&lt;ref name="Burton101" /&gt;

To meet the steadily escalating development costs of the vehicle, Sinclair decided to raise capital by selling some of his own shares in Sinclair Research to fund a separate company that would focus on electric vehicles. A £12 million deal was reached in March 1983, of which £8.3 million was used to fund the establishment of the new [[Sinclair Vehicles]] company.&lt;ref&gt;Adamson &amp; Kennedy, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; Sinclair recruited Barrie Wills, a veteran former employee of the [[DeLorean Motor Company]], to lead Sinclair Vehicles as its managing director. Although Wills initially expressed scepticism about the viability of an electric vehicle – his twenty-five years in the motor industry had convinced him that an electric car was never going to happen – Sinclair managed to convince him that the project would work.&lt;ref name="Dale155"/&gt; In 1984, Sinclair Vehicles' new head office was established in [[Coventry]] in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]], an area with a long-established link with the motor industry.&lt;ref name="Dale160"&gt;Dale, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

The project's prospects were boosted by changes in the British government's approach to electric vehicles. In March 1980, it had abolished [[Vehicle Excise Duty]] for electric vehicles and by the start of 1983, the [[Department for Transport|Department of Transport]] was working on legislation that would introduce a new category of vehicle – the "electrically assisted pedal cycle". This had a number of significant advantages from Sinclair's point of view. Such a vehicle would be exempt from insurance and vehicle tax, and the user would not need a driving licence or a helmet, all of which were required for mopeds.&lt;ref name="Dale155"/&gt; The legislation, which was passed in August 1983,&lt;ref name="Marks1989"&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Sinclair C5 – An Investigation into its Development, Launch, and Subsequent Failure | journal=European Journal of Marketing | last=Marks | first=Andrew P. | year=1989 | volume=23 | issue=1 | pages=61–71 | doi=10.1108/eum0000000000542}}&lt;/ref&gt; was prompted by a lobbying campaign by manufacturers such as [[Raleigh Bicycle Company|Raleigh]] who wanted to sell electric bicycles.&lt;ref name="Times-7-Jan-2005" /&gt;

Sinclair realised that his electric vehicle design could easily be adapted to meet the new legislation. As the "electrically assisted pedal cycle" category was so new, there were no existing vehicles on the market that would meet the standards prescribed by the new legislation. However, it imposed a number of restrictions that limited the performance of any vehicle that would qualify under the new standards. The maximum legal speed of the vehicle would be limited to only {{convert|15|mph}}; it could not weigh any more than {{convert|60|kg}}, including the battery; and its motor could not be rated at any more than 250 watts.&lt;ref name="Dale156"&gt;Dale, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these limitations, the vehicle was seen as only the first step in a series of increasingly ambitious electrical cars. Sinclair intended it to prove the viability of electric personal transport; the hope was that, just as Sinclair had found with home computers like the hugely successful [[ZX81]] and [[ZX Spectrum]], an affordable electric vehicle could unleash pent-up demand for a market that did not previously exist.&lt;ref name="Dale156" /&gt; However, Sinclair performed no [[market research]] to ascertain whether there was actually a market for his electric vehicle; as the director of the Primary Contact advertising agency commented in January 1985, the project continued all the way to the prototype stage "purely on the convictions of Sir Clive".&lt;ref name="Marks1989" /&gt;

===Development and design of the C5===

With Sinclair's new specifications in hand, Ogle worked on a three-wheeled design dubbed the C5, which bore similarities with the earlier three-wheeled [[Bond Bug]] – another Ogle design. The vehicle's handlebar steering was the brainchild of Wood Rogers, who decided at the outset that a steering wheel would not be practicable as it would make it impossible for a driver to get in and out easily – a serious safety disadvantage. He comments that "putting the bars at the driver's sides made it easy to steer and felt very natural".&lt;ref name="Burton103"&gt;Burton, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; A prototype was presented to 63 families in the [[NRS social grade|A, B, C1 and C2 demographic groups]] in suburban and town environments to determine that the controls were correctly positioned; this was the only external research carried out on the C5.&lt;ref name="Marks1989" /&gt; In the autumn of 1983,&lt;ref name="Marks1989" /&gt; Wills brought in Lotus Cars to finish the vehicle's detailing, build prototypes and test rigs, carry out testing and take forward the programme to production.&lt;ref name="Dale156" /&gt; The development of the C5 took place over 19 months in conditions of great secrecy, with testing carried out at the Motor Industry Research Association's proving ground in [[Leicestershire]].&lt;ref name="Burton102" /&gt;

Further aerodynamic refinements were carried out in Exeter with the development of new body shells which produced further reductions in the vehicle's drag. However, it was felt that something was lacking in the design and a 23-year-old industrial designer, Gus Desbarats, was brought in to refine the shell's appearance.&lt;ref name="Dale158"&gt;Dale, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; He had won a Sinclair-sponsored electric vehicle design competition at the [[Royal College of Art]] and was hired on his graduation to set up an in-house car design studio at Sinclair's Metalab in Cambridge, of which he became the first employee.&lt;ref name="Gray90"&gt;{{cite book|title=Great Brand Blunders|last=Gray|first=Rob|publisher=Crimson Publishing Ltd|date=2014|page=90|location=Bath|isbn=978-1-78059-229-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not only Desbarats' first project but, as he later said, "day one of my working life", when he turned up at Sinclair's premises. He was taken aback when he saw the C5 for the first time, as he had been expecting a "proper" electric car. He said later that he thought "the concept looked futuristic but was short on practicality. There were no instruments, nowhere to put anything and no security features." Desbarats told Sinclair that the design would have to be redone from scratch, "asking what we were doing about visibility, rear view mirrors, range indications&amp;nbsp;...".&lt;ref name="Gray91" /&gt; It was far too late for this, however; all the key design decisions had already been made. Desbarats told Sinclair that he would need four months to revisit the design and was given eight weeks instead.&lt;ref name="Times-7-Jan-2005"&gt;{{cite news|title=Vision that drove Sinclair to ruins (and nowhere fast)|last=Healey|first=Andrew|work=The Times|page=76|date=7 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He created the styling that was used for the final production model of the C5, with wheel trims and a small luggage compartment being added subsequently.&lt;ref name="Dale158"/&gt; Desbarats was also responsible for the creation of the High-Vis Mast accessory, as he felt uncomfortable being so close to the ground with other drivers potentially not being able to see him.&lt;ref name="Times-7-Jan-2005" /&gt; He later described his contribution as "convert[ing] an ugly pointless device into a prettier, safer, and more usable pointless device".&lt;ref name="Gray93"&gt;Gray, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sinclair C5 motor.jpg|right|thumb|The C5's electric motor, which drives the left-hand rear wheel]]
The chassis of the C5 consists of two identical metal pressings which are joined at top and bottom with a closing plate at the rear. It lacks a separate suspension system, instead relying on the chassis structure having enough torsional flex.&lt;ref name="Dale158"/&gt; Its motor was produced in Italy by Polymotor, a subsidiary of the Dutch company [[Philips]].&lt;ref name="AK188" /&gt; Although it was later famously said that the C5 was powered by a washing machine motor,&lt;ref&gt;Adamson &amp; Kennedy, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; the motor was in fact developed from a design produced to drive a truck cooling fan. Lotus provided the gearbox and a rear axle based on a design for car steering columns.&lt;ref name="Dale158"/&gt; The C5's electronics were produced by MetaLab, a Sinclair spin-off.&lt;ref name="Dale159" /&gt; The wheels were assembled from tyres made in [[Taiwan]] and wheels from Italy.&lt;ref name="Dale162" /&gt; Oldham Batteries provided a lead-acid battery developed for Sinclair that could manage more than the 300 charge-discharge cycles that had originally been specified.&lt;ref name="Dale158"/&gt;

The bodywork was made from two injection-moulded polypropylene shells supplied by three manufacturers; J.J. Harvey of Manchester made the moulds, [[Linpac]] provided the shells, and [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]] supplied the raw material. According to Rodney Dale, the upper shell mould was "one of the largest – if not the largest – injection mouldings of its type in the UK: possibly even in the world".&lt;ref name="Dale158"/&gt; The manufacturing process reflected Sinclair's ambition for the C5 production line. A single mould set was capable of producing up to 4,000 parts every week. The two parts of the shell were joined together by wrapping a tape around the joint, aligning them on a [[Jig (tool)|jig]], pressing them together and passing an electric current through the tape to heat and melt it.&lt;ref name="Dale158"/&gt; The same process was used to make the front and rear bumper assemblies of the [[Austin Maestro]] and only took about 70 seconds to complete.&lt;ref name="Burton103" /&gt; Although Sinclair had considered producing the C5 at the DeLorean plant at [[Dunmurry]] in Northern Ireland, which had one of Europe's most advanced automated plastic-body manufacturing facilities, this was not to be, as the DeLorean Motor Company failed in a controversial bankruptcy that resulted in the plant's closure.&lt;ref name="Dale159" /&gt;

Instead, the work of assembling the C5 was given to [[The Hoover Company]] in the spring of 1983. The [[Welsh Development Agency]] (WDA) approached Hoover to ask them if they would be interested becoming the principal subcontractor for Sinclair, "who are working on an electric car, and as a by-product of the research have designed an electrically assisted bicycle. They are looking for a subcontractor to whom they can entrust the assembly."&lt;ref name="Dale161" /&gt; The proposal suited all sides. The WDA was keen to support the Hoover washing machine factory at [[Merthyr Tydfil]], situated in the economically depressed [[South Wales Valleys]]. Hoover was enticed by Sinclair's projections of sales of 200,000 units a year, increasing to 500,000. Sinclair saw Hoover's plant and expertise as a good match for their fabrication techniques. A contract was signed within a few months.&lt;ref name="Dale161"&gt;Dale, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production, distribution and support===
The C5 was produced in great secrecy in a separate part of the Hoover factory with its own duplicate facilities. At first the work was carried out by a small team of people in a sealed room, but as production ramped up Hoover installed two production lines in building MP7, connected to the main factory by an underground tunnel. A rolling testing stand was located at the end of the production line to test each completed C5 for faults. A mechanical arm simulated the weight of a person weighing {{convert|12|stone}} and the vehicle's brakes were tested under load. At the end of the process the C5s which had passed testing were rolled into cardboard boxes and loaded straight onto distribution lorries in stacks. Around £100,000 was spent to set up the factory.&lt;ref name="Dale162"&gt;Dale, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

Distribution centres were set up in [[Hayes, Middlesex|Hayes]] in [[Middlesex]], [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] in [[Lancashire]] and [[Oxford]] to handle the C5s.&lt;ref name="Dale163"&gt;Dale, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; Hoover arranged for 19 of its service offices around the UK – responsible for maintaining customers' vacuum cleaners and washing machines – to also maintain C5s and provide spare parts.&lt;ref name="Dale167"&gt;Dale, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; The C5's major consumable item, the battery, was to be supported by 300 branches of [[Comet Group|Comet]] and [[Woolworths Group|Woolworths]].&lt;ref name="Dale170"/&gt;

Hoover trained its engineers to produce C5s and tested its manufacturing processes by assembling, dismantling and re-assembling 100 C5s.&lt;ref name="Dale163" /&gt; Full production began in November 1984 and by early January 1985 over 2,500 C5s had been manufactured.&lt;ref name="Dale166"&gt;Dale, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; Each production line could produce 50 vehicles an hour, and Hoover were capable of producing up to 8,000 C5s per week.&lt;ref name="Dale163" /&gt;

===Launch===
[[File:Alex palace1.jpg|right|thumb|Alexandra Palace, where the C5's launch was staged on 10 January 1985]]
The news of Sinclair's C5 project came as a surprise when it became public and attracted considerable interest, as well as scepticism. ''[[The Economist]]'' reported in June 1983 that carmakers were "startled" but cautious about Sinclair's prospects; as one competitor put it, "If it were anyone but Sinclair, we'd say he was bonkers". ''The Economist'' asked, "Can a man who has made a fortune out of calculators and computers, and could double it on flatscreen televisions, be that crazy?" and wondered whether he was "making a ghastly mistake", a prediction that industry insiders thought was likely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Will Sinclair give or get a shock?|work=The Economist|date=25 June 1983|pages=66–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The C5 was launched on 10 January 1985 at [[Alexandra Palace]] in North London. The event was staged in Sinclair's usual glitzy style, with women handing out press packs&lt;ref name="Dale163" /&gt; and a variety of promotional giveaways: magazines, hats, pullovers, T-shirts, key rings, sun visors, badges, mugs, bags, and even a C5 video game.&lt;ref name="Dale168"&gt;Dale, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; The vehicle was given a dramatic unveiling; six C5s driven by women dressed in grey and yellow burst out of six cardboard boxes, drove around the arena, and lined up side by side.&lt;ref name="Dale165"&gt;Dale, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; Sinclair announced the launch of a £3 million, three-month-long advertising print and television advertising campaign.&lt;ref name="Dale166" /&gt; The C5 would be available initially by mail order at a cost of £399 and would subsequently be sold via high-street stores.&lt;ref name="Dale167" /&gt;

Sinclair issued a glossy sales brochure characterising the vehicle as a part of an ongoing exercise in "cutting giants down to size, turning impersonal tyrants into personal servants". The brochure highlighted Sinclair's achievements in producing affordable pocket calculators, home computers, and pocket televisions and declared, "with the C5, Sinclair Vehicles puts personal, private transport back where it belongs&amp;nbsp;– in the hands of the individual."&lt;ref name="Brochure" /&gt; The photographs accompanying the text showed housewives and teenagers driving the C5 to shops, railway stations, and sports fields&amp;nbsp;– in the words of technology writers Ian Adamson and Richard Kennedy, "a blue-sky suburbia exclusively populated by electric trikes and their drivers".&lt;ref&gt;Adamson &amp; Kennedy, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

The press was given an opportunity to try out the C5 but this proved to be, as Adamson and Kennedy put it, "an unqualified disaster".&lt;ref name="AK193"&gt;Adamson &amp; Kennedy, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of the demonstration machines did not work, as the assembled journalists soon discovered.&lt;ref name="AK193" /&gt; ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' called the C5 a "Formula One bath-chair"; its reporter "had travelled five yards outdoors when everything went phut and this motorised, plastic, lozenge rolled to a halt with all the stationary decisiveness of a mule".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=It's not kid's stuff, this Formula One bath-chair|last=Pile|first=Stephen|work=The Sunday Times|date=13 January 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'''s reporter had a flat battery after only seven minutes,&lt;ref name="Guardian-11-Jan-85"&gt;{{cite news|title=Transports of doubtful delight|last1=Harry|first1=Roy|last2=Large|first2=Peter|work=The Guardian|date=11 January 1985|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''Your Computer'' found that the C5 could not cope with the slopes at Alexandra Palace: "The 250 watt electric motor which drives one of the back wheels proved incapable of powering the C5 up even the gentlest slopes without using pedal power. The tricycle was soon making a plaintive "peep, peep" noise signalling that the engine had overheated."&lt;ref name="YC-Feb-85"&gt;{{cite news|title=Knight on a white recharger saves British tricycle industry|url=https://archive.org/stream/your-computer-magazine-1985-02/YourComputer_1985_02#page/n23/mode/2up|work=Your Computer|date=February 1985|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the distinguished former racing driver [[Stirling Moss]] ran into problems when he tried out the C5 on the roads around Alexandra Palace. The Canadian newspaper ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' reported that while he had started out well, "a jaunty smile on [his] face as he braved some of the worst exhaust fumes in the world spluttering almost directly into his face from trucks he could almost drive underneath", he ran into problems when he reached a hill: "It was at this point that he realised the battery had gone dead. On a cold and foggy London day, the great man was visibly sweating."&lt;ref name="GM-11-Jan-1985" /&gt;

The timing and location of the launch event&amp;nbsp;– in the middle of winter, on the top of a snow- and ice-covered hill&amp;nbsp;– later prompted criticism even from Sinclair executives, who admitted off the record that spring conditions might have been better for a vehicle with so little protection from the British climate.&lt;ref name="FT=23-Apr-1985" /&gt; The ''Financial Times'' called it "the worst possible timing to launch what was proclaimed to be a serious, road-going vehicle".&lt;ref name="FT-15-Oct-1985"&gt;{{cite news|title=C5's Road to the Receiver|last=Griffiths|first=John|work=The Financial Times|date=15 October 1985|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sinclair's biographer Rodney Dale describes it as "a calculated (or miscalculated) risk", pointing out that production was already underway, details were beginning to leak out to the press and "the launch could hardly have been held up until the possibility of a bright spring day". He justified the choice of January as being necessitated by a need to release the C5 "as soon as possible lest the erroneous speculation should have done more harm than good".&lt;ref name="Dale168" /&gt; Rob Gray offers an alternative explanation, that the launch date had been brought forward because Sinclair's development funds were running low.&lt;ref name="Gray92"&gt;Gray, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reviews===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Sinclair C5 Gus Desbarats.jpg|right|thumb|Guy Desbarats, the C5's industrial designer, in a publicity photograph issued to Sinclair in an attempt to address the issue of the driver's height]] --&gt;
It soon became apparent that the C5 faced more serious problems with public perception than merely a botched launch event. Media reactions to the C5 were generally negative when the first reviews appeared over the following days. As the ''[[Financial Times]]'' observed, "the few hardy journalists who ventured out on the roads returned shivering and dubious about the C5's abilities in such harsh conditions."&lt;ref name="FT-15-Oct-1985" /&gt;

A common concern was that it was simply too vulnerable in traffic. ''[[Your Computer (British magazine)|Your Computer]]'' commented that "a periscope would be handy if you intended driving the C5 on busy roads since your head is only at bonnet level."&lt;ref name="YC-Feb-85" /&gt; ''The Guardian's'' motoring correspondent wrote of her "grave misgivings about its use in congested traffic&amp;nbsp;... On a sharp turn it too easily lifts a rear wheel, is hazardously silent, and low down. It disappears below a car driver's sight-line when pulling up alongside. The prospect of these vehicles merging into heavy traffic, dwarfed by heavy lorries, buses, and cars, is worrying. Their low speed risks turning them into mobile chicanes for other traffic."&lt;ref name="Guardian-13-Jan-85" /&gt; Another ''Guardian'' writer wrote that he "would not want to drive [the] C5 in any traffic at all. My head was on a level with the top of a juggernaut's tyres, the exhaust fumes blasted into my face. Even with the minuscule front and rear lights on, I could not feel confident that a lorry driver so high above the ground would see me."&lt;ref name="Guardian-11-Jan-85" /&gt; Sinclair issued a publicity photograph showing the C5's industrial designer, Gus Desbarats, in a C5 alongside a cardboard cutout of an [[Austin Mini]] to illustrate that the C5 driver's seated position was actually higher than that of a Mini driver.&lt;ref name="Dale164"&gt;Dale, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;

As teenagers were among the target audiences for the C5, some commentators also raised the prospect of (in Adamson and Kennedy's words) "packs of 14-year-olds terrorising the neighbourhood in their customised C5s".&lt;ref name="AK193" /&gt; The secretary of the [[Cyclists Touring Club]] raised the prospect of "kids us[ing] them in a pretty wild way. They may run them over paths and pavements and knock people down."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alarm over space-age trike|last=McKie|first=Robin|work=The Times|date=6 January 1985|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sinclair dismissed such concerns – "I have qualms about seven-year-olds riding bicycles on the open road, but I have far fewer qualms about a 14-year-old driving one of these".&lt;ref name="Guardian-13-Jan-85"&gt;{{cite news|title=Youth puts trike to the test|last=Baker|first=Sue|work=The Guardian|date=13 January 1985|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teenagers interviewed by ''The Guardian'' were doubtful about whether they would want a C5, commenting that while it was fun to drive they felt insecure in it and preferred their bicycles.&lt;ref name="Guardian-13-Jan-85" /&gt;

Sinclair's claims to have revolutionised the electric vehicle were dismissed by many reviewers; ''Your Computer'' called the C5 "more of a toy than the 'ideal solution for all types of local journey' which the brochure claims".&lt;ref name="YC-Feb-85" /&gt; ''The Guardian's'' motoring correspondent also characterised it as "a delightful toy"&lt;ref name="Guardian-13-Jan-85" /&gt; ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' described it as "a cleverly-designed 'fun' machine that can hardly be regarded as serious, everyday all-weather transport",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sinclair trike 'costs £1.87 for 1,000 miles'|last=Langley|first=John|work=The Daily Telegraph|page=2|date=11 January 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[The Engineer (magazine)|The Engineer]]'' viewed it as "a smashing big boy's toy, tough enough to take teenage thrashing and possibly a serious vehicle for fit adults to nip out in for the Sunday papers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Technology stands the test|last=Dunn|first=John|work=The Engineer|page=37|date=17 January 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the plus side, the C5's handling characteristics were praised by reviewers. ''The Guardian'' called it "very easy to master once you have become familiar with the under-thigh handlebar steering and the semi-recumbent driving position with feet on bicycle-type pedals."&lt;ref name="Guardian-13-Jan-85" /&gt; The ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' described the arrangement as "surprisingly easy" to master, although it cautioned that "on full speed and on full lock it's very easy to tip it onto two wheels."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Skinny Mini!|last=Rimmer|first=Bryan|work=Daily Mirror|date=11 January 1985|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Daily Express]]'' motoring correspondent wrote that he found the C5 "stable, comfortable and easy to handle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Give it a trike|last=Benson|first=David|work=Daily Express|date=11 January 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The verdict from motoring organisations, road safety groups, and consumer watchdogs was decidedly negative and probably sealed the C5's fate. The [[British Safety Council]] (BSC) tested the C5 at Sinclair Vehicles' headquarters in Warwick and issued a highly critical report to its 32,000 members. Sinclair was furious and announced that he would sue the BSC and its chairman, James Tye, for defamation (although nothing came of it)&lt;ref name="AK194-5"&gt;Adamson &amp; Kennedy, pp. 194–5&lt;/ref&gt; after Tye told the press: "I am shattered that within a few days 14-year-old children will be allowed to drive on the road in this Doodle Bug without a licence&amp;nbsp;... without insurance and without any form of training."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=And now – an electric car that is legally a bicycle|agency=United Press International|date=10 January 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several years later, Tye was happy to take responsibility for the C5's failure, describing himself as "the man entirely to blame for the failure of the Sinclair C5".&lt;ref name="Times-11-Aug-1989"&gt;{{cite news|title=Revival of the C5|date=11 August 1989|work=The Times|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the problems of the press launch day, a more positive response was expected from the 20,000 members of the public who attended the remaining two days of the launch event to try out the C5 on the Alexandra Palace test track. Sinclair reported the day after the event that its switchboard had been overwhelmed by enquirers, and it expected that all 2,700 units from the first production run would be sold by the following Monday.&lt;ref name="Times-12-Jan-85"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sinclair's pedal car sells out|last=Webb|first=Clifford|date=12 January 1985|work=The Times|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Setting a pattern that would be repeated throughout the C5's short commercial life, this prediction was wildly optimistic; less than 200 were sold during the Alexandra Palace event. However, sales picked up as mail order forms – which had been sent to all of Sinclair's computer customers – were returned with fresh orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Orders for Sinclair C5 Vehicle Pass 1,000 Mark|last=Griffiths|first=John|work=The Financial Times|page=6|date=21 January 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within four weeks, 5,000 C5s had been sold.&lt;ref name="Times-9-Feb-1985" /&gt;

Although the C5 reached retail stores at the start of March 1985, sales had tailed off. Sinclair resorted to hiring teams of teenagers to drive around London in C5s to promote the vehicle, at a cost to the company of £20 a day. Similar teams were established in Manchester, Birmingham, and Leeds. The company denied that it was a marketing campaign; a spokesman told ''The Times'' that "we haven't done&amp;nbsp;... tests on inner city roads. That is what the team is doing. Marketing is not the prime function but will undoubtedly be a spin-off."&lt;ref name="Times-28-3-1985"&gt;{{cite news|title=Teenagers show off Sinclair tricycle|last=Johnstone|first=Bill|date=28 March 1985|work=The Times|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sinclair was reported to be surprised at the lack of demand and blamed the press for "a lack of foresight and pessimistic reporting".&lt;ref name="Times-28-3-1985" /&gt; Matters did not improve. The retail chain Comet acquired 1,600 C5s but nine months later most were still unsold.&lt;ref name="AK199"&gt;Adamson &amp; Kennedy, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

Adding to Sinclair's problems, production of the C5 had to be halted for three weeks after numerous customers reported that the plastic moulding attached to the gearbox was impairing the performance of their vehicles. 100 Hoover workers were shifted from the C5 production line to work on replacing the faulty mouldings on returned vehicles.&lt;ref name="AK199" /&gt; Barrie Wills admitted that Sinclair was also taking the opportunity to "adjust stocks" in the light of the C5's poor sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fault halts production of C5 tricycle|last=Webb|first=Clifford|date=30 March 1985|work=The Times|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; When production resumed a month later it was at only 10% of the previous level, with 90 of the workers being transferred back to the washing machine production lines. Only 100 C5s were now being produced a week, down from the original 1,000. Over 3,000 unsold C5s were piled up in storage at the Hoover factory, with additional unsold stock in 500 retail outlets nationwide.&lt;ref name="Times-23-Apr-1985"&gt;{{cite news|title=Production of C5 tricycle cut by 90%|last=Young|first=Robin|work=The Times|page=3|date=23 April 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sinclair tried to put a brave face on it, admitting that "sales have not been entirely up to expectations" but claiming to be "confident of a high level of demand for the vehicle".&lt;ref name="FT=23-Apr-1985"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sinclair Cuts Production of C5 by 90%|date=23 April 1985|work=The Financial Times|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesman told the media that "we expect a rapid rise in sales now that the weather is improving".&lt;ref name="Times-23-Apr-1985" /&gt;  Possible sales opportunities were explored in mainland Europe, Asia, and the United States, with Sinclair claiming that he had found "very big" levels of interest.&lt;ref name="Times-13-Aug-1985"&gt;{{cite news|title=Debt halts production of C5|last=Johnston|first=Bill|date=13 August 1985|work=The Times|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoover were sufficiently persuaded to allow Sinclair to divert 10 of their employees to modify C5s for overseas export.&lt;ref name="AK200" /&gt; The bid to sell the C5 abroad failed; the Dutch National Transport Service told Sinclair that the C5 was not suitable for Dutch roads without improvements to its braking system, the addition of more reflectors, and the inclusion of the High-Vis Mast as part of the basic package. Most of the other ten countries that Sinclair inquired of demanded similar changes.&lt;ref name="AK199" /&gt;

The C5's reputation received a further battering when major consumer organisations published sceptical evaluations. [[The Automobile Association]] questioned many of Sinclair's claims in a report published at the start of May. It found that the range of the vehicle was typically only about 10 miles (16&amp;nbsp;km) rather than the {{convert|20|mi}} promised by Sinclair, and reported that the C5's battery ran flat after only {{convert|6.5|mi}} on a cold day. The C5's running speed was more usually around {{convert|12.5|mph}} than the claimed {{convert|15|mph}}, while its running costs compared unfavourably to that of a petrol-driven Honda PX50 moped. The stability, general roadworthiness, and especially the safety of the C5 were questioned, and the AA suggested that the High-Vis Mast should be included as part of the standard package.&lt;ref name="AK196"/&gt; It concluded:

{{quote|The C5 looks more comfortable and convenient than it really is – older cyclists looking for less pedal effort will be disappointed by the agility its layout demands. Although it is delightfully quiet, performance, range, and comfort do not compare with the better mopeds and costs are much closer than one might think when one allows for the inevitable battery replacement.&lt;ref name="AK196"&gt;Adamson &amp; Kennedy, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Which?|Consumers' Association]] published a critical report on the C5 in the June issue of its magazine ''[[Which?|Which]]'', concluding that the vehicle was of only limited use and represented poor value for money. All three of the C5s that it tested broke down with a "major gearbox fault" and their High-Vis Masts snapped. The longest run between battery charges was only {{convert|14.2|mi}}, and a more realistic achievable range was 5–10 miles (8–16&amp;nbsp;km). It also echoed the AA's concerns about the C5's safety and the omission of the High-Vis Mast from the standard package.&lt;ref name="Times-6-Jun-1985"&gt;{{cite news|title=C5 is poor value for money, test concludes|last=Webb|first=Clifford|work=The Times|date=6 June 1985|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine also called the C5 "too easy to steal",&lt;ref name="AK197"&gt;Adamson &amp; Kennedy, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; hardly surprising considering that while a security lock could be used to prevent it being driven away, the C5 was light enough that a would-be thief could simply pick it up and carry it off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sinclair's electric dreams come true|page=5|last=Griffiths|first=John|work=The Financial Times|date=11 January 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the summer of 1985 continued, sales of the C5 remained far below Sinclair's predictions; only 8,000 had been sold by July. In the middle of that month, the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] ordered Sinclair to amend or withdraw its advertisements for the C5 after finding that the company's claims about the safety and speed of the C5 either could not be proved or were not justified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=C5 advert claims rejected|date=17 July 1985|work=The Times|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Retailers attempted to deal with unsold stocks of C5s by drastically cutting the vehicle's price. Comet first reduced the price to £259.90&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Poor sales see price drop for Sinclair's C5|date=17 July 1985|work=The Times|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; but by the end of the year was selling C5s with a complete set of accessories for only £139.99, 65% less than the initial price.&lt;ref name="AK200"&gt;Adamson &amp; Kennedy, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

Production was terminated in August 1985, by which time 14,000 C5s had been assembled.&lt;ref name="SundayTimes-15-Dec-1985"&gt;{{cite news|title=C5 – an electric dream fades|last=Brooks|first=Richard|work=The Sunday Times|date=15 December 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cashflow problems caused by the paucity of sales caused relations to break down between Sinclair Vehicles and Hoover. In June 1985 Hoover obtained a writ against Sinclair for unpaid debts of over £1.5 million, relating to work carried out over the previous eight months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sinclair faces £1.5m writ|last=Johnston|first=Bill|date=15 July 1985|work=The Times|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It did not actually serve the writ but entered negotiations with Sinclair. In mid-August, it publicly announced that it was ceasing production of the C5.&lt;ref name="AK200" /&gt; A Sinclair spokesman told the media that the halt in production was "due to a shortage of certain components which are unable to be re-ordered while a financial settlement is pending. Once this has been concluded production is envisaged to recommence."&lt;ref name="Times-13-Aug-1985" /&gt;

===Demise of Sinclair Vehicles===
[[File:Abandoned Sinclair C5.jpg|right|thumb|An abandoned Sinclair C5 in [[Fife]], Scotland]]
Production did not recommence and the Hoover production line remained closed permanently. On 19 September 1985, Sinclair Vehicles changed its name to TPD Limited, with a direct subsidiary named Sinclair Vehicles Sales Limited continuing to sell C5s. TPD only lasted until 15 October, when it was placed into receivership. The receivers announced that 4,500 C5s had been sold by Sinclair Vehicles, with another 4,500 remaining in the company's hands. £7.75 million was reportedly owed to creditors, of which £7 million was owed to Sir Clive Sinclair himself in reflection of his personal investment in the project. Hoover was not among the creditors, as Sinclair had managed to settle the dispute on terms that neither company would reveal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Receivers Put Debts of Sinclair's C5 Concern at £7.75m|last=Griffiths|first=John|work=The Financial Times|date=15 October 1985|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 November, TPD was formally liquidated at a creditors' meeting. It was revealed, to the anger of the creditors, that Sinclair had taken out a £5 million [[debenture]] to cover the money that he had put into the company. Ordinary creditors faced little prospect of recovering the £1 million left outstanding.&lt;ref name="Guardian-6-Nov-1985"&gt;{{cite news|title=Little hope for Sinclair creditors|last=Wheatcroft|first=Patience|work=The Guardian|date=6 November 1985|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary Contact, the marketing agency used by Sinclair to promote the C5, was left with the biggest unpaid bill, of nearly £500,000.&lt;ref name="Guardian-6-Nov-1985" /&gt; The last of the unsold C5s were bought for £75 each by Ellar (Surplus Goods) Ltd of Liverpool, which planned to sell 1,000 of them to an Egyptian businessman for use on a university campus while another 1,500 were intended to be sold in the UK.&lt;ref name="SundayTimes-15-Dec-1985" /&gt;

Many reasons have been suggested for the failure of Sinclair Vehicles and what Dale calls "the jigsaw of the C5's disappointment".&lt;ref name="Dale160" /&gt; One of the receivers of Sinclair Vehicles, John Sapte, suggested that Sinclair had taken the wrong tack with its marketing of the C5: "It was presented as a serious transport, when perhaps it should have been presented as a luxury product, an up-market plaything."&lt;ref name="FT-15-Oct-1985" /&gt; Ellar's director Maurice Levensohn took exactly this tack when he purchased Sinclair Vehicles' remaining stock, saying that his company would market them as "a sophisticated toy": "If you were a little boy, wouldn't you want your parents to get you one this Christmas?"&lt;ref name="SundayTimes-15-Dec-1985" /&gt; His strategy was notably successful; Ellar sold nearly 7,000 C5s at up to £700 each, far more (and at a higher price) than Sinclair had ever managed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Whatever happened to the C5?|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/whatever-happened-to-the-sinclair-c5-1350234.html|newspaper=The Independent|first=Sam|last=Coates|date=2 November 1996|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators attributed the C5's failure to problems with Sinclair's marketing strategy; only a year after the demise of Sinclair Vehicles, the ''Globe and Mail'' newspaper called it "one of the great marketing bombs of postwar British industry".&lt;ref name="GandM" /&gt; Andrew P. Marks of [[Paisley College of Technology]] criticises Sinclair's marketing strategy as confused; the C5 promotional brochure depicts it as a leisure vehicle, showing boys in C5s at a football pitch, women in C5s on a suburban road, and so on, while the text suggests that the C5 is a serious substitute for a car. He concludes that the C5 was poorly defined, appearing to be "trying to grasp at two different markets" but was unable to appeal to either, and so failed to take off. The fact that it was initially only available via mail order was also a mistake, in Marks' view, as it meant that no physical inspection of the product could be made before purchasing it. This was a serious deterrent to consumers as it made the C5 a much more risky purchase.&lt;ref name="Marks1989" /&gt;

The design researcher and academic [[Nigel Cross]] calls the C5 a "notorious&amp;nbsp;... example of failure" and describes its basic concept as "wrong". He points out that the marketing research for the C5 was carried out ''after'' the vehicle's concept had already been decided; he notes that it appears to have been intended "mainly to aid promotion" rather than to guide development.&lt;ref name="Cross" /&gt; Gus Desbarats, the C5's industrial designer, attributes the vehicle's flawed concept to Sinclair operating in a "bubble"&lt;ref name="Gray93" /&gt; and believes that Sinclair "failed to understand the difference between a new market, computing, and a mature one, transport, where there were more benchmarks to compare against".&lt;ref name="Gray91"&gt;Gray, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; He comments that the experience of working on the C5 convinced him of the need for industrial designers such as himself to get "involved early in the innovation process, shaping basic configurations, never again [being] satisfied to simply decorate a fundamentally bad idea".&lt;ref name="Gray93" /&gt;

Sinclair himself said in 2005 that the C5 "was early for what it was. People reacted negatively and the press didn't help. It was too low down and people felt insecure, hence it got bad press."&lt;ref name="Scotsman-10-Jan-2005" /&gt; Sam Dawson of ''Classic and Sport Car Magazine'' described the C5 as "incredibly fun to drive", suggesting that the safety concerns "could have been addressed if it wasn't for the fact that it was already doomed as a national joke." He noted the disconnect between the media's expectations of a serious electric car and the reality of the C5, which he called "just a fun way of getting around".&lt;ref name="BBC-13-Jul-2014" /&gt; Professor Stuart Cole of the [[University of South Wales]] comments that the C5 suffered from the design of the roads and the attitudes of the time, which were not geared towards pedal or electric vehicles: "In the days before unleaded petrol, your face would have been at the height of every exhaust pipe, and drivers weren't used to having to consider slower-moving cyclists. But with more cycle lanes, better education, and workplaces providing showers, etc., the world now is much more geared up for people looking for alternatives to the car, and hopefully will become even more so in the future."&lt;ref name="BBC-13-Jul-2014"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sinclair C5 built in Merthyr in 1984 'was ahead of its time'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-28219291|last=Prior|first=Neil|publisher=BBC News|date=13 July 2014|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sinclair's other electric vehicles===

Sinclair envisaged producing follow-up vehicles such as the C10, a two-seater city car, and the C15, a four-seater capable of travelling at {{convert|80|mph}}.&lt;ref name="AK198"&gt;Adamson &amp; Kennedy, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; As Wills put it at the launch event, "We're developing a family of traffic-compatible, quiet, economic and pollution-free vehicles for the end of the '80s." The C5 was described as "the baby of the family".&lt;ref name="Dale165" /&gt; The C10 was intended to be a city car, capable of carrying two passengers at up to {{convert|40|mph}} in a roofed but open-sided compartment with two wheels at the front and one at the back. Wood Rogers intended it to effectively be an updated version of the [[Isetta]], a 1960s Italian [[microcar]]. Sinclair built a full-scale mock-up of it; according to Wood Rogers, "it looked great. I specified open sides to keep the cost down and having no doors meant it escaped a lot of regulations too." The design is strikingly similar to the modern [[Renault Twizy]] electric vehicle; Wood Rogers comments that "you could put the C10 into production today and it would still look contemporary."&lt;ref name="Burton102"&gt;Burton, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the C5's launch, Sinclair described the C15 as having "a futuristic design with an elongated 'tear-drop' shape, a lightweight body made of self-coloured polypropylene and a single, possibly 'roller' type rear wheel".&lt;ref name="AK198"/&gt; It would have been launched at the 1988 International Motor Show in Birmingham following a development programme costed at £2 million. Unlike the relatively conventional technology used in the C5, Sinclair intended to use [[Sodium–sulfur battery|sodium sulphur batteries]] with four times the power-to-weight ratio of lead-acid batteries to give the C15 much greater speed and range – over {{convert|180|mi}} on a single charge. It would have had approximately the same dimensions as a conventional small car, measuring {{convert|3.5|m}} long, {{convert|1.35|m}} high, and {{convert|1.35|m}} wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Car That the Sinclair C5 Led up a Cul-De-Sac|last=Cane|first=Alan|work=The Financial Times|page=14|date=30 September 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it could only have worked if sodium sulphur batteries had realised their promise. In the event they did not, the project could not continue, due to thermal problems.&lt;ref name="Burton102" /&gt; Neither the C10 nor the C15 ever left the drawing board.&lt;ref name="AK198" /&gt;

Although Sinclair went on to produce more (but much smaller) electric vehicles, the C5 debacle did lasting damage to the reputation of subsequent EVs in the UK, which the media routinely compared to the C5. It was not until a highly regarded manufacturer, [[Toyota]], launched a serious and well-received vehicle in the 1990s, the [[Toyota Prius|Prius]], that the C5 "jinx" was finally laid to rest.&lt;ref name="Burton"&gt;Burton, pp. 106–7&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 Sir Clive's nephew Grant Sinclair presented what he called an updated version of the Sinclair C5 called the [[Iris eTrike]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newatlas.com/sinclar-c5-updated-iris-etrike/47966/|title=Clive Sinclair's nephew creates a C5 for today|website=newatlas.com|accessdate=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/news/cambridge-news/watch-its-not-sinclair-c5-12611052|title=Iris eTrike 2017's answer to the Sinclair C5?|first=Chris|last=Elliott|date=15 February 2017|website=Cambridge-news.co.uk|accessdate=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/business-38960275/can-modern-incarnation-of-c5-succeed|title=Can modern incarnation of C5 succeed?|date=15 February 2017|accessdate=2 September 2017|website=Bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===From flop to cult===
[[File:C5 Alive rally.jpg|right|thumb|C5 enthusiasts gather at the [[Brooklands Museum]]]]
[[File:Sinclair C5 jet engine.jpg|right|thumb|A heavily modified C5 fitted with a [[jet engine]]]]
Despite its lack of commercial success when it was first released, the C5 gained an unexpected degree of cult status in the later years.&lt;ref name="Scotsman-10-Jan-2005" /&gt; Collectors began purchasing them as investment items,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=1985: Down Memory Lane in the Sinclair C5|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/witness/january/10/newsid_4111000/4111177.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; reselling them for considerably more than their original retail price. One such investor, Adam Harper, bought 600 C5s from a film company as a speculative investment in 1987. He sold all but four within two years, selling them to customers who wanted a novel or more environmentally friendly form of transportation. He also found willing customers among drivers who had been banned from the road, as the C5 did not need a driving licence or vehicle tax.&lt;ref name="Times-7-Aug-1989" /&gt; According to Harper, C5s could be resold for as much as £2,500 – more than six times the original retail price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Derided Sinclair C5 has last laugh at 72mph|last=Eason|first=Kevin|page=1|work=The Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1996, a Special Edition C5 in its original box was reported to be worth more than £5,000 to collectors.&lt;ref name="Charge"&gt;{{cite news|title=Charge!|url=http://yoz.com/wired/2.02/features/charge.html|last=Flint|first=James|work=Wired|issue=2.02|date=February 1996|accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

C5 owners began modifying their vehicles to achieve levels of performance far beyond anything envisaged by Sinclair. Adam Harper used one C5 as a stunt vehicle, driving it through a {{convert|70|ft|abbr=on}} tunnel of fire,&lt;ref name="Charge"/&gt; and adapted another to run at {{convert|150|mph}}, aiming to break a world land speed record for a three-wheeled electric vehicle and the British record for any type of electric vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://yoz.com/wired/2.02/features/charge.html|title=Charge!|last=Flint|first=James|work=Wired|issue=2.02|date=February 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="150mph"/&gt; He said later: "Up to 100&amp;nbsp;mph it's like you're running on rails, it's really stable.

As quoted in the 1987 ''Guinness Book of Records'' under battery powered vehicle: "John W. Owen and Roy Harvey travelled 919 miles 1479&amp;nbsp;km from John O'Groats to Land's End in a Sinclair C5 in 103 hr 15 min on 30 Apr-4 May 1985."(8.9&amp;nbsp;mph average.)

{{Agriculture}}

'''Slash-and-burn agriculture''', or '''fire–fallow cultivation''', is a farming method that involves the cutting and burning of plants in a [[forest]] or [[woodland]] to create a [[Field (agriculture)|field]] called a '''swidden'''. (Preparing fields by [[deforestation]] is called ''[[assarting]]''.)

In [[subsistence agriculture]], slash-and-burn typically uses little technology. It is often applied in [[shifting cultivation]] agriculture (such as in the [[Amazon rainforest]]) and in [[transhumance]] livestock herding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Waters |first=Tony |title=The Persistence of Subsistence Agriculture |page=3 |publisher=Lexington Books |location=Lanham |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7391-0768-3 |oclc=70334845}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slash-and-burn is used by 200–500 million people worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Slash_and_burn |title=Slash and burn |website=[[Encyclopedia of Earth]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Skegg |first=Martin |title=True Stories: Up in Smoke |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 it was estimated that in [[Brazil]] alone, 500,000 [[small farm]]ers each cleared an average of one hectare (2.47105 acres) of forest per year&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.uia.org/en/problem/147982|title=Agricultural burning {{!}} World Problems &amp; Global Issues {{!}} The Encyclopedia of World Problems|website=encyclopedia.uia.org|access-date=2018-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==
Historically, '''slash-and-burn''' cultivation has been practiced throughout much of the world, in [[grassland]]s as well as [[woodland]]s.

During the [[Neolithic Revolution]], which included agricultural advancements, groups of [[hunter-gatherers]] domesticated various plants and animals, permitting them to settle down and practice agriculture, which provides more nutrition per hectare than hunting and gathering. This happened in the [[river civilization|river valleys of Egypt and Mesopotamia]]. Due to this decrease in food from hunting, as human populations increased, agriculture became more important. Some groups could easily plant their crops in open fields along river valleys, but others had forests blocking their farming land.

In this context, humans used slash-and-burn agriculture to clear more land to make it suitable for plants and animals. Thus, since Neolithic times, slash-and-burn techniques have been widely used for converting forests into crop fields and pasture.&lt;ref&gt;Jaime Awe, ''Maya Cities and Sacred Caves'', Cu bola Books (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Fire was used before the Neolithic as well, and by hunter-gatherers up to present times. Clearings created by the fire were made for many reasons, such as to draw game animals and to promote certain kinds of edible plants such as berries.

Slash-and-burn fields are typically used and owned by a family until the soil is exhausted. At this point the ownership rights are abandoned, the family clears a new field, and trees and shrubs are permitted to grow on the former field. After a few decades, another family or clan may then use the land and claim [[Usufruct|usufructuary rights]]. In such a system there is typically no market in farmland, so land is not bought or sold on the open market and land rights are traditional. In slash-and-burn agriculture, forests are typically cut months before a dry season. The "slash" is permitted to dry and then burned in the following dry season. The resulting ash fertilizes the soil&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://athenaeum.libs.uga.edu/bitstream/handle/10724/12128/B1142.pdf?sequence=1|title=Best Management Practices for Wood Ash as Agricultural Soil Amendment|last=|first=|date=|website=athenaeum.libs.uga.edu|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecologic.org/actions-issues/challenges/slash-burn-agriculture/|title=Slash and Burn Agriculture {{!}} EcoLogic Development Fund|website=www.ecologic.org|language=English|access-date=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the burned field is then planted at the beginning of the next rainy season with crops such as upland rice, maize, cassava, or other staples. Most of this work is typically done by hand, using such basic tools such as [[machete]]s, [[axe]]s, [[Hoe (tool)|hoe]]s, and makeshift [[shovel]]s. The old American civilizations, like the Inca, Maya, and Aztecs, also used this old agricultural technique.

Large families or clans wandering in the lush woodlands long continued to be the most common form of society through human [[prehistory]]. Axes to fell trees and [[sickle]]s for harvesting grain were the only tools people might bring with them. All other tools were made from materials they found at the site, such as fire stakes of [[birch]], long rods (Vanko), and [[Harrow (tool)|harrow]]s made of [[spruce]] tops. The extended family conquered the lush virgin forest, burned and cultivated their carefully selected swidden plots, sowed one or more crops, and then proceeded on to forests that had been noted in their wanderings. In the temperate zone, the forest regenerated in the course of a lifetime. So swidden was repeated several times in the same area over the years. But in the tropics the forest floor gradually depleted. It was not only in the [[Moorland|moor]]s, as in Northern Europe, but also in the [[steppe]], [[Savannah]], [[prairie]], [[pampas]] and barren [[desert]] in tropical areas where shifting cultivation is the oldest type of farming. Cultivation is similar to slash-and-burn. (Clark 1952 91–107).&lt;ref&gt;Clark J.G.D. 1952, Farming: Clearance and Cultivation II Prehistoric Europe: The Economic Basis, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Southern European Mediterranean climates have favored [[evergreen forest|evergreen]] and [[deciduous forest]]s. With slash-and-burn agriculture, this type of forest was less able to [[regeneration (ecology)|regenerate]] than those north of the Alps. Although in northern Europe one crop was usually harvested before [[grass]] was allowed to grow, in southern Europe it was more common to exhaust the soil by farming it for several years.

Classical authors mentioned large forests,&lt;ref&gt;Semple E.C.1931, Ancient Mediterranean Forests and the Lumber Trade, vol. II., p. 261-296. Henry Holt et al., The Geography of the Mediterranean Region, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Homer]] writing about "wooded [[Samothrace]]," [[Zakynthos]], [[Sicily]], and other woodlands.&lt;ref&gt;Homer, e.g., Iliad XIII.11–13, Odyssey IX.22–24.&lt;/ref&gt; These authors indicated that the Mediterranean area once had more forest; much had already been lost, and the remainder was primarily in the mountains.&lt;ref&gt;Darby, H.C., 1950, Domesday Woodland II Economic History Review, 2d ser.,III, London; Darby, H.C., 1956, The clearing of the Woodland in Europe II, p 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although parts of Europe aside from the north remained wooded, by the [[Roman Iron Age|Roman Iron]] and early [[Viking Age]]s, forests were drastically reduced and settlements regularly moved. The reasons for this pattern of mobility, the transition to stable settlements from the late Viking period on, or the transition from shifting cultivation to stationary [[farming]] are unknown. From this period, plows are found in graves. Early agricultural peoples preferred good forests on hillsides with good drainage, and traces of cattle enclosures are evident there.

In Italy, shifting cultivation was a thing of the past by the birth of Christ. [[Tacitus]] describes it as a strange cultivation method, practiced by the Germans. In 98 AD, he wrote about the Germans that their fields were proportional to the participating cultivators but their crops were shared according to status. Distribution was simple, because of wide availability; they changed fields annually, with much to spare because they were producing grain rather than other crops. A W Liljenstrand wrote 1857 in his doctoral dissertation, "About Changing of Soil" (p. 5 ff.), that Tacitus discusses shifting cultivation: "arva per annos mutant".&lt;ref name="Harvard"&gt;Perkins and Marvin, Ex Editione Oberliniana, Harvard College Library, 1840 (Xxvi, 15–23).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arenander E.O. 1923, Germanemas jordbrukskultur ornkring KristifØdelse // Berattelse over Det Nordiska Arkeologmotet i Stockholm 1922, Stockholm.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the practice of shifting cultivation.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=USDA APHIS|date=October 26, 2011 |url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/plant_health/lacey_act|title=U.S. Department of Agriculture Lacey Act Guidance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Migration Period]] in Europe, after the Roman Empire and before the Viking Age, the peoples of Central Europe moved to new forests after exhausting old parcels. Forests were quickly exhausted; the practice had ended in the Mediterranean, where forests were less resilient than the sturdier coniferous forests of Central Europe. [[Deforestation]] had been partially caused by burning to create pasture. Reduced timber delivery led to higher prices and more stone construction in the Roman Empire (Stewart 1956, p.&amp;nbsp;123).&lt;ref&gt;Stewart O.C. 1956, Fire as the First Great Force Employed by Man, II. Thomas W.L. Man's Role in Changing the Face of the Earth, Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt; Although forests gradually decreased in northern Europe, they have survived in the Nordic countries.

Tribes in pre-Roman Italy (including the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]]s, Umbrians, Ligurians, [[Sabine]]s, [[Latin]]s, Campanians, Apulians, Saliscans, and Sabellians) apparently lived in temporary locations. They cultivated small patches of land, kept sheep and cattle, traded with foreign merchants, and occasionally fought. These Italic groups developed identities as settlers and warriors around 900 BC. They built forts in the mountains which are studied today, as are the ruins of a large [[Samnium|Samnite]] temple and theater at [[Pietrabbondante]].

Many [[Italic peoples]] saw benefits in allying with Rome. When the Romans built the ''[[Via Cassia#Via Amerina|Via Amerina]]'' in 241 BC, the [[Falisci]] settled in cities on the plains and aided the Romans in road construction; the [[Roman Senate]] gradually acquired representatives from Faliscan and [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] families, and the Italic tribes became settled farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Zwingle|first=E.|date=January 2005|title=Italy before the Romans|journal=National Geographic|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical writers described peoples who practiced [[shifting cultivation]], which characterized the Migration Period in Europe. The exploitation of forests demanded displacement as areas were deforested. [[Julius Caesar]] wrote about the [[Suebi]] in ''Commentarii de Bello Gallico'' 4.1, "They have no private and secluded fields ("''privati ac separati agri apud eos nihil est''") ...&amp;nbsp;They cannot stay more than one year in a place for cultivation’s sake" ("''neque longius anno remanere uno in loco colendi causa licet''"). The Suebi lived between the [[Rhine]] and the [[Elbe]]. About the Germani, Caesar wrote: "No one has a particular field or area for himself, for the magistrates and chiefs give year by year to the people and the clans, who have gathered together, as much land and in such places as seem good to them and then make them move on after a year" ("''Neque quisquam agri modum certum aut fines habet proprios, sed magistratus ac principes in annos singulos gentibus cognationibusque hominum, qui tum una coierunt, a quantum et quo loco visum est agri attribuunt atque anno post alio transire cogunt''" [Book 6.22]).

[[Strabo]] (63 BC—c. 20 AD) also writes about the Suebi in his ''Geography'' (VII, 1, 3): "Common to all the people in this area is that they can easily change residence because of their sordid way of life; they do not cultivate fields or collect property, but live in temporary huts. They get their nourishment from their livestock for the most part, and like [[nomad]]s, pack all their goods in wagons and go on to wherever they want". Horace writes in 17 BC (''Carmen Saeculare'', 3, 24, 9ff.) about the people of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]]: "The proud [[Getae]] also live happily, growing free food and cereal for themselves on land they do not want to cultivate for more than a year" ("''Vivunt et rigidi Getae, / immetata quibus iugera liberas / fruges et Cererem ferunt, / nec cultura placet longior annua''").

[[File:Jordanes, Norway tribes.png|thumb|Locations of Norwegian tribes described by Jordanes in his ''Getica'']] 
[[Jordanes]], of [[Goths|Gothic]] descent, became a monk in Italy. In his mid-sixth-century AD ''[[Getica]]'' (''De origine actibusque Getarum''; ''The Origin and Deeds of the Goths''){{#tag:ref|Late antique writers commonly used [[Getae]] for [[Goths]] mixing the peoples in the process.|group}},&lt;ref&gt;G. Costa, 32. Also: ''De Rebus Geticis'': O. Seyffert, 329; ''De Getarum (Gothorum) Origine et Rebus Gestis'': W. Smith, vol 2 page 607&lt;/ref&gt; he described the large island of [[Scandza]], on which the Goths originated. According to Jordanes, of the tribes living there, some are [[Hålogaland#Etymology|Adogit]] from within 40 days of the midnight sun. After the Adogit were the Screrefennae and [[Swedes (Germanic tribe)|Suehans]], who also lived in the north. The Screrefennae did not raise crops, instead hunting and collecting bird eggs. The Suehans, a semi-nomadic tribe with good horses (comparable to the [[Thuringii]]), hunted furs to sell; grain could not be grown so far north. In about 550 AD, [[Procopius]] also described a primitive hunting people he called "Skrithifinoi": "Both men and women engaged incessantly just in hunting the rich forests and mountains, which gave them an endless supply of game and wild animals."{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The use of fire in northeastern Sweden changed as agriculture evolved. Although the [[Sami people]] did not burn land (since burning killed the lichen required by their reindeer), later farmers frequently used slash-and-burn techniques. The 19th-century Swedish timber industry moved north, clearing the land of trees but leaving waste behind as a fire risk; during the 1870s, fires were frequent.&lt;ref name=alex&gt;{{cite book|last=Alexander|first=Andrew C.

One culture which flourished in pre-agricultural Europe survives: the [[Forest Finns]] in Scandinavia. Martin Tvengsberg, a descendant the Forest Finns, studied them in his capacity as curator of the [[Hedmark Museum]] in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;Svedjebruk.Hedmark 2010.Foreword by Ragnhild Queseth Haarstad Styreleder i Norsk Skogfinsk Museum. {{ISBN|978-82-93036-00-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Savonia (historical province)|Savo-]][[Karelians]] had a sophisticated system for cultivating spruce forests. A [[Runes|runic]] poem about Finland's spruce forests reads, ''"Gåivu on mehdien valgoinen valhe"'' ("The birch is the forest’s white lie").{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The best spruce forests reportedly contain birch trees, which grow only after a forest has burned once or twice.

Slash-and-burn may be defined as the large-scale deforestation of forests for agricultural use. Ashes from the trees help farmers by providing nutrients for the soil.&lt;ref name="geography.about.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geography.about.com/od/urbaneconomicgeography/a/slashburn.htm |title=Slash and Burn Agriculture – An Overview of Slash and Burn |publisher=Geography.about.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In industrialized regions, including [[Europe]] and [[North America]], the practice was abandoned with the introduction of [[market agriculture]] and land ownership. Slash-and-burn agriculture was initially practiced by European pioneers in North America such as [[Daniel Boone]] and his family, who cleared land in the [[Appalachian Mountains]] during the late 18th and early 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnography.com/2010/12/farmer-power-the-continuing-confrontation-between-subsistence-farmers-and-development-bureaucrats/ |title=Blog Archive » Farmer Power: The Continuing Confrontation between Subsistence Farmers and Development Bureaucrats |publisher=Ethnography.com |date=2010-12-02 |accessdate=2013-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160527053917/http://www.ethnography.com/2010/12/farmer-power-the-continuing-confrontation-between-subsistence-farmers-and-development-bureaucrats/ |archivedate=2016-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, land cleared by slash-and-burn farmers was eventually taken over by systems of [[land tenure]] focusing on long-term improvement and discouraging practices associated with slash-and-burn agriculture.

Tribal groups in the [[Northeast India|northeastern Indian states]] of [[Tripura]], [[Arunachal Pradesh]], [[Meghalaya]], [[Mizoram]] and [[Nagaland]] and the [[Bangladesh]]i districts of [[Rangamati]], [[Khagrachari]], [[Bandarban]] and [[Sylhet]] refer to slash-and-burn agriculture as ''jhum'' or ''jhoom'' cultivation. The system involves clearing land, by fire or clear-felling, for economically-important crops such as [[upland rice]], vegetables or fruits. After a few cycles, the land's fertility declines and a new area is chosen. ''Jhum'' cultivation is most often practiced on the slopes of thickly-forested hills. Cultivators cut the treetops to allow sunlight to reach the land, burning the trees and grasses for fresh soil.

Although a solution for [[Human overpopulation|overpopulated]] tropical countries where subsistence agriculture may be the traditional method of sustaining many families, the consequences of slash-and-burn techniques for [[ecosystems]] are almost always destructive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://library.thinkquest.org/07aug/00720/home.html|title = The Forest Buddies|work = thinkquest.org|accessdate = 2015-12-16|deadurl = bot: unknown|archiveurl = https://wayback.archive-it.org/3635/20130906055619/http://library.thinkquest.org/07aug/00720/home.html|archivedate = 2013-09-06|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This happens particularly as population densities increase, and as a result farming becomes more intensively practiced. This is because as demand for more land increases, the fallow period by necessity declines. The principal vulnerability is the [[nutrient]]-poor soil, pervasive in most [[tropical forest]]s. When biomass is extracted even for one harvest of wood or charcoal, the residual soil value is heavily diminished for further growth of any type of vegetation.

Sometimes there are several cycles of slash-and-burn within a few years' time span. For example, in eastern [[Madagascar]], the following scenario occurs commonly. The first wave might be cutting of all trees for wood use. A few years later, saplings are harvested to make charcoal, and within the next year the plot is burned to create a quick flush of nutrients for grass to feed the family [[zebu]] cattle. If adjacent plots are treated in a similar fashion, large-scale [[erosion]] will usually ensue, since there are no roots or temporary water storage in nearby canopies to arrest the [[surface runoff]]. Thus, any small remaining amounts of nutrients are washed away. The area is an example of [[desertification]], and no further growth of any type may arise for generations.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

The ecological ramifications of the above scenario are further magnified, because [[tropical forest]]s are [[habitat]]s for extremely [[biodiversity|biologically diverse]] ecosystems, typically containing large numbers of [[Endemic (ecology)|endemic]] and [[endangered species]]. Therefore, the role of slash-and-burn is significant in the current [[Holocene extinction]].{{cn|date=August 2017}}

[[Slash-and-char]] is an alternative that alleviates some of the negative ecological implications of traditional slash-and-burn techniques.

'''Energy efficient stadiums''' is the latest trend of [[environmentalism]] in [[sports]].  Many [[stadium]]s are beginning to take measures to become more [[environmentally friendly]] and [[Energy conservation|energy efficient]], such as using [[solar energy]] to power the stadiums and using reusable raw materials. The first stadium successfully built to use 100 percent solar power is the [[Kaohsiung National Stadium]] in [[Kaohsiung, Taiwan]].  It earned the nickname of the 'dragon' stadium.  Completed in 2009, the 55,000 capacity stadium was built for the [[World Games]], which took place in July 2009.  After the conclusion of the World Games, the stadium will be used mainly for [[Rugby football|rugby]] games and other athletic events.  [[Japan]]ese [[architect]] [[Toyo Ito]] designed the stadium which incorporates 8,844 [[solar panel]]s on the roof.  These solar panels provide enough energy to power the 3,300 lights and two giant television screens.  The stadium provides so much power, and not all of it is needed to power the stadium.  The [[Government of the Republic of China|Taiwanese government]] plans to sell the excess energy.  The stadium will prevent 660 tons of carbon dioxide from being released. Not only is the Kaohsiung National Stadium 100 percent solar powered, but all of the raw materials used in the stadium are reusable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1181327/First-solar-powered-sstadium-used-World-Games.html |title=First solar powered stadium to be used at World Games &amp;#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2009-05-14 |accessdate=2012-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philadelphia Eagles==

The Dragon stadium is not the only sports arena to become energy efficient.  The [[Philadelphia Eagles]] of the [[National Football League|NFL]] announced a new plan to make their stadium, [[Lincoln Financial Field]], more energy efficient by the 2011-2012 season.  [[Lincoln Financial Field]] will have 2,500 solar panels and 80 20-foot-high wind turbines installed, as well as a [[Electric generator|generator]] that runs on natural gas.  Lincoln Financial Field will be the first stadium in the [[United States of America|United States]] capable of generating all of its own electricity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/18/sports/football/18stadium.html Philadelphia Eagles’ Stadium Is Becoming Energy Self-Sufficient]&lt;/ref&gt;
The Eagles hired the Florida-based company Solar Blue to install their solar panels and wind turbines.  The team will spend $30 million to have everything installed by the start of the 2011-2012 season.  The solar panels and wind turbines will generate about 25 percent of the stadium's energy needs, and the generator will provide the rest.  Not only is the Eagles' stadium energy efficient, but it is also eco-friendly.  The Eagles directed [[Aramark]], the food service and cleaning contractor at the Eagles' stadium, to use nontoxic cleaning supplies and toilet paper, tissues, and towels which are made from 100 percent recycled fibers.  These efforts have allowed the team to recycle over 30 percent of its waste, which has doubled since 2008.  Even more, the Eagles compost over 25 tons of organic waste and over 10,000 gallons of grease and kitchen oil were converted into biodiesel last year.  These efforts have made the Eagles the "greenest" team in the NFL.

==AT&amp;T Park==
[[File:ATTParkannualoutput.png|thumb|Monthly output of AT&amp;T Park solar panels]]
[[Major League Baseball]] teams have also joined in the efforts of making their stadiums more energy efficient and eco-friendly.  [[AT&amp;T Park]], the home of the [[San Francisco Giants]], uses 590 solar panels to provide a total of 120&amp;nbsp;kW.  This system provides enough electricity to power the stadium's scoreboard, which is equivalent to powering 40 homes.&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, Ryan. "Giants to Put Solar Panels on AT&amp;T Park." Sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/. 21 Mar. 2007. Web. 4 June 2012. &lt;http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070321&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fenway Park==

[[Fenway Park]] is also increasing their efforts to become more energy efficient.  The [[Boston Red Sox]]'s stadium has solar thermal panels which generate enough heat to provide the stadium with over 37 percent of its hot water.   Fenway also composts grass clippings and encourages recycling.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, David. "Solar Panels Unveiled at Fenway." Web log post. The Green Blog - Boston Globe. 19 May 2008. Web. 4 June 2012. &lt;http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/green/greenblog/2008/05/solar_panels_unveiled_at_fenwa.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stonehenge in Context 2 - geograph.org.uk - 1434969 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Traffic on the A303 road passing by Stonehenge]]

The '''Stonehenge road tunnel''' is a planned tunnel in [[Wiltshire]], England drawn up by [[Highways England]] to upgrade the [[A303 road]].  It would move the A303 into a tunnel under the [[Stonehenge]] [[World Heritage Site]], completing the removal of traffic begun with the closure of the [[A344 road (England)|A344 road]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/8311.aspx |title=Reasons for Review |publisher=Highways Agency |accessdate=2007-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hicks|first1=Dan|title=Why are England's heritage bodies supporting the Stonehenge Bypass?|url=https://www.apollo-magazine.com/englands-heritage-bodies-supporting-stonehenge-bypass/|work=Apollo|date=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wider project was designed to improve the landscape around the monument and to improve safety on the A303,&lt;ref name="ha"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/3659.aspx |title=A303 Stonehenge |publisher=Highways Agency |accessdate=2007-04-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804012024/http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/3659.aspx |archivedate=4 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was part of proposals to change the site in other ways including moving the visitors centre.

==Context==
[[File:A303(T) Queues at Stonhenge - geograph.org.uk - 34458.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The A303 road passing by Stonehenge]]
The A303 [[primary route]] is one of the main routes from London to the [[South West England|South West of England]].  Sections have been upgraded to [[dual carriageway]] status, though one third of the road remains single carriageway.  Traffic flows on the A303 between [[Amesbury]] and [[Winterbourne Stoke]] (the section including Stonehenge) are above the capacity of the road&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/6382.aspx |title=A303 Stonehenge (incorporating the Winterbourne Stoke Bypass) Preferred Route Announcement June 1999 – Why a road improvement is proposed |publisher=Highways Agency |accessdate=2007-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Highways Agency expressed concern about safety on this road and the A344. The two roads passed through Stonehenge and land owned by the National Trust&lt;ref name="report"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roads/network/strategic/programme/decisionletters/coll_reportofthelocalinquiryinto/reportofthelocalinquiryintot3987 |title=Report to the First Secretary of State and the Secretary of State for Transport |page=8 |date=31 January 2005 |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-07-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070206194011/http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roads/network/strategic/programme/decisionletters/coll_reportofthelocalinquiryinto/reportofthelocalinquiryintot3987 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=2007-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the A303 passing directly south and the A344 directly to the north, with a pedestrian tunnel passing from the Stonehenge visitor centre to the site underneath this road.  As part of the development of the proposals, over 50 routes were considered by the Highways Agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/6381.aspx |title=A303 Stonehenge (incorporating the Winterbourne Stoke Bypass) Preferred Route Announcement June 1999 – Choice of route |publisher=Highways Agency |accessdate=2007-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1991, 51 proposals have been considered for improving the A303 in the area and to remove it from the Stonehenge site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org.uk/UserFiles/File/UKNC_Stonehenge_042006.pdf |title=A303 Stonehenge Improvement Scheme Review: public consultation — Response by the United Kingdom National Commission for UNESCO |accessdate=2007-05-17 |author=Professor Alec Boksenberg CBE FRS |date=19 April 2006 |format=PDF |publisher=UNESCO Committee for United Kingdom |pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposals==

===1995 proposal===
In 1995 it was proposed to build a tunnel for the A303 underneath the World Heritage Site. A conference agreed on a 2.5-mile (4&amp;nbsp;km) [[tunnel|bored tunnel]]; however, the [[United Kingdom government|government]] instead proposed a [[cut and cover]] tunnel, with plans being published in 1999. These plans were criticised by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], [[Campaign for Better Transport (United Kingdom)|Transport 2000]] and others who expressed concern that it would cause damage to archaeological remains along the route, destroy ancient sites and not achieve an improvement in the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1606053.stm |title=Stonehenge road plans 'may damage site' |publisher=BBC News  |date=18 October 2001 |accessdate=2007-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2299033.stm |title=Trust attacks Stonehenge tunnel |publisher=BBC News  |date=4 October 2002 |accessdate=2007-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, new plans for a bored tunnel of 1.3 miles (2.1&amp;nbsp;km) were announced by the [[Secretary of State for Transport]] as part of a 7.7-mile (12.5&amp;nbsp;km) plan to upgrade the A303 to dual carriageway status, with the tunnel estimated to cost [[£]]183 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2562675.stm |title=Stonehenge tunnel approved |publisher=BBC News  |date=10 December 2002 |accessdate=2007-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal brought further protests from the National Trust, [[English Heritage]], [[UNESCO]], [[Campaign to Protect Rural England|CPRE]], the [[Council for British Archaeology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britarch.ac.uk/stonehenge/Stonehenge%20roads%20inquiry%20final%20proof.doc|title=Proof of Evidence of George Lambrick MA FSA MIFA|last=|first=|date=January 2004|website=|publisher=Council for British Archaeology|format=DOC|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2007-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and local groups as the tunnel approach cutting would cut in two a prehistoric track way between Stonehenge and a nearby river. These groups are calling for a tunnel at least 2.9&amp;nbsp;km long, which would, while being sited within the world heritage site, clear most of the known major artefacts, claiming that if the government goes ahead with the 2.1&amp;nbsp;km tunnel there may never be another chance to remove the road from the site completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Maximising benefits – A more sustainable tunnel solution at Stonehenge|date=|publisher=The National Trust|url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/webpack/bin/webpack.exe/livebase?object=LiveBase1&amp;itemurn=1247&amp;mode=wbFullItem|accessdate=2007-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 a [[public enquiry]]&lt;ref name="enquirybegins"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wiltshire/3493649.stm|title=Stonehenge tunnel inquiry opens|date=17 February 2004|accessdate=2007-04-08|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; required under the [[Highways Act 1980]] was conducted by a planning inspector, Michael Ellison.  His enquiry agreed that the government proposals were adequate.&lt;ref name="report"/&gt; The report stated:

{{cquote|The physical loss of archaeological remains, the changes to the land form in these sections, and the scale of the new highway would adversely affect the authenticity of the site and more than offset the benefits of the proposed tunnel in the central area. The published scheme would represent the largest earthwork ever constructed within the World Heritage Site; a feature that would contribute nothing to the authenticity.}}

but concluded:

{{cquote|...after taking into account the requirements of local and national planning, including the requirements of agriculture, that it is expedient for the purpose of improving the A303 between points A and B on the plan referred to in the Line Order for a trunk road to be provided along the route shown in the Line Order}}

On 20 July 2005 the tunnel scheme was withdrawn by the Government, partly due to rising costs of construction, which had doubled to £470&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wiltshire/4699477.stm |title= Stonehenge tunnel plan cash blow |publisher=BBC News  |date=20 July 2005 |accessdate=2007-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Highways Agency continued to list the project as planned, but gave 2008 as the earliest date for the start of construction.&lt;ref name="ha" /&gt;

===2005 proposal===
On 31 October 2005 a Government steering group was set up to look at possible solutions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Way Forward Announced For A303 Stonehenge Review |publisher=Government News Network |date=31 October 2005 |url=http://www.gnn.gov.uk/environment/fullDetail.asp?ReleaseID=175616&amp;NewsAreaID=2&amp;NavigatedFromDepartment=False |accessdate=2007-04-08 |quote=Stephen Ladyman, Minister of State for Transport, said: "I hope this review will enable me to decide on an option in keeping with the special requirements of the location that is affordable, realistic and deliverable." |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930155037/http://www.gnn.gov.uk/environment/fullDetail.asp?ReleaseID=175616&amp;NewsAreaID=2&amp;NavigatedFromDepartment=False |archivedate=30 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the aim of choosing an "option in keeping with the special requirements of the location that is affordable, realistic and deliverable." The review presented five options – the published tunnel scheme, a cut and cover tunnel, a 'partial solution' (involving a roundabout but maintaining the current road), and two overland bypass routes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wiltshire/4694894.stm |title=Heritage site road plans revealed |publisher=BBC News  |date=8 February 2006 |accessdate=2007-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/documents/Stonehenge_Leaflet_web_version.pdf |title=A303 Stonehenge Improvement Scheme Review – Public Consultation |publisher=Highways Agency |format=PDF |date=January 2006 |accessdate=2007-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these plans have been criticised as being damaging to both archaeology and [[biodiversity]], including the [[stone curlew]], [[barn owl]]s, [[bat]]s, and the chalk grassland habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wiltshire/4637656.stm |publisher=BBC News  |title=Stonehenge road 'a risk to birds' |date=23 January 2006 |accessdate=2007-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five options were considered including diverting the A303 further away and only closing the A344. The group expected to produce a report in 2006, taking into account the results of public consultation which started on 23 January 2006 and ran until 24 April 2006.&lt;ref name="ha" /&gt;

On 6 December 2007, Roads Minister [[Tom Harris (UK politician)|Tom Harris]] announced that the whole scheme had been cancelled due to increased costs of £540&amp;nbsp;million.  English Heritage expressed disappointment whilst the group Save Stonehenge (now Stonehenge Alliance) were pleased with the outcome. The Highways Agency stated that they would continue to work on small scale improvements to the A303.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wiltshire/7130666.stm |publisher=BBC News  |title=Stonehenge tunnel plans scrapped |date=6 December 2007 |accessdate=2007-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A344 closure===
A revised proposal, of closing the [[A344 road (England)|A344 road]] between Stonehenge Bottom and Byway 12, and closing part of the B3086 was put forward in 2010. This also included a proposed new roundabout to replace the current Airman's Corner junction and improvements to the Longbarrow Roundabout on the A303.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salisburyjournal.co.uk/news/9097436.Public_inquiry_into_Stonehenge_road_closure/     |title=Public inquiry into Stonehenge road closure |work=Salisbury Journal |date=22 June 2011  |accessdate=2011-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bajrfed.co.uk/showthread.php?2771-Stonehenge-Road-Closure |title=Stonehenge Road Closure  |publisher=BAJR archaeology portal  |date=February 2010  |accessdate=2011-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A planning inquiry to consider the proposal was started in June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-wiltshire-13863143  |title=Inquiry into Stonehenge A344 closure plans |publisher=BBC |date=22 June 2011  |accessdate=2011-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2012 work began on the £27 million project which involved the closure and grassing over of part of the A344 and the closing of the underpass beneath the road at the monument entrance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/jul/11/stonehenge-27-million-makeover-a344|title=Stonehenge's £27m makeover will end its days as a traffic island |work=The Guardian |date=11 July 2012  |accessdate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013 the new visitors' centre at Airman's Corner on the [[A360 road|A360]] was opened. Shuttle buses take visitors to the monument along the old A344 road, a distance of approximately 2.4&amp;nbsp;km.

===2013 proposal===
According to documentation released in response to a [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information]] request, in January 2012 local councils and the South West Local Enterprise Partnership met to discuss their proposals for "a consortium of Local Authorities to develop and take forward a new scheme for improvements to the A303/ A358/A30" and to "develop an effective lobbying framework so that we can take a planned approach to raising our profile both nationally, regionally and locally".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/101507/response/257007/attach/3/ENV%20767%20Rebecca%20Lush%20Blum%20Reply%20attachment%20A303%20Meeting%206%20January%202012.pdf|title=Notes of a meeting to discuss opportunities to take forward a new proposal for improvements to the A303, A358 and A30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2012 a survey conducted by Somerset County Council found that more than 90% of commuters and businesses in the South West back an upgrade of the A303.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-19615859|title=A303 dualling plan through South West 'supported by businesses'}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2013 it was reported that the chancellor was giving consideration to "...adding lanes to the A303 – known all too well to holidaymakers – which runs from Basingstoke through Wiltshire (past Stonehenge) and Somerset to the South West of England..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/chancellor-plans-second-toll-motorway-in-major-road-spend-8556198.html|title=Chancellor plans second toll motorway in major road spend|work=The Independent|date=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2017 go-ahead===
The proposal was finally allowed by the Government on 12 January 2017. The Transport Secretary, [[Chris Grayling]], said that "it will transform the A303, cutting congestion and improving journey times". Chairman of Amesbury Museum and Heritage Trust, Andy Rhind-Tutt, described the tunnel plan as a "self-destructing time bomb" which would "do nothing" for traffic problems in the area. The Stonehenge Alliance campaign group repeated their belief that "any tunnel shorter than 2.7 miles would cause irreparable damage to the landscape".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-wiltshire-38589118|title=Stonehenge tunnel plan finalised by government|publisher=BBC News|date=12 January 2017|access-date=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hicks|first1=Dan|title=The A303 is part of the Stonehenge setting, don't bury it|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/archaeology/the-a303-is-part-of-the-stonehenge-setting-dont-bury-it-a7543226.html|work=The Independent|date=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group also responded with a statement:&lt;ref name="stoneall"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stonehengealliance.org.uk/stonehenge-alliance-responds-and-calls-for-a-re-run/|title=Stonehenge Alliance responds and calls for a re-run|date=3 March 2017|work=Stonehenge Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tenke Fungurume Mine''' holds one of the world's largest known copper and cobalt resources. The deposits are located within two concessions totaling over {{convert|1500|km2|sqmi}}  within [[Katanga Province]],  in the south eastern region of the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] (DRC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eib.org/projects/news/tenke-fungurume-mining-project,-democratic-republic-of-congo-drc.htm |title=Tenke Fungurume Mining project, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) |publisher=[[European Investment Bank]] |date=2007-02-08 |accessdate=2009-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309160826/http://www.eib.org/projects/news/tenke-fungurume-mining-project,-democratic-republic-of-congo-drc.htm |archivedate=March 9, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tenke Fungurume is the largest copper mine in the DRC.

==Ownership==

The mining project is a partnership led by [[Freeport-McMoRan|Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold]], the [[Lundin Mining|Lundin Mining Corporation]], and the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo, through [[Gécamines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  |url=http://www.fcx.com/operations/africa.htm
  |title=Africa Project
  |publisher=Freeport-McMoRan
  |date=
  |accessdate=2009-04-10
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of September 2009 Freeport-McMoRan operated the mine and held 58.8%, Lundin held 24.8% and Gécamines (La Générale des Carrières et des Mines) held the remaining  17.5%. In May 2016, Freeport-McMoRan sold their stake to [[China Molybdenum]] (CMOC) for 2.65 Billion USD, as the area holds [[cobalt]] for [[lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion batteries]] in addition to copper.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ft.com/content/054bbb3a-1e8b-11e6-a7bc-ee846770ec15 China plays long game on cobalt and electric batteries] FT&lt;/ref&gt;  The contract had yet to be reviewed by the government under a "revisitation" process started earlier that year.

The first phase at the mine cost US$1.8bn to build.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Operations==
The first copper cathode was produced in March 2009, and the plant was working at planned capacity by September 2009. 
In the third quarter of 2009 the cobalt plant and the sulphuric acid plant were commissioned.
It is expected that the operation will produce {{convert|250000000|lb|kg}} of copper metal and {{convert|18000000|lb|kg}} of cobalt annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Triflate''', also known by the systematic name '''trifluoromethanesulfonate''', is a [[functional group]] with the formula CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;−. The triflate group is often represented by −OTf, as opposed to −Tf ([[trifluoromethylsulfonyl|triflyl]]). For example, ''n''-butyl triflate can be written as CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OTf.

The corresponding triflate anion, {{chem|CF|3|SO|3|−}}, is an extremely stable [[polyatomic ion]], being the [[conjugate acid|conjugate base]] of [[triflic acid]] (CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H), one of the strongest [[acid]]s known. It is defined as a [[superacid]], because it is more acidic than pure [[sulfuric acid]].

==Applications==
A triflate group is an excellent [[leaving group]] used in certain [[organic reactions]] such as [[nucleophilic substitution]], [[Suzuki coupling]]s and [[Heck reaction]]s. Since alkyl triflates are extremely reactive in [[SN2 reaction|S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 reactions]], they must be stored in conditions free of [[nucleophile]]s (such as [[water]]). The anion owes its stability to [[resonance stabilization]] which causes the negative charge to be spread over the three oxygen atoms and the sulfur atom. An additional stabilization is achieved by the [[trifluoromethyl]] group as a strong [[electron-withdrawing group]].

Triflates have also been applied as ligands for group [[Group 11 element|11]] and [[Group 13 element|13]] metals along with [[lanthanide]]s.

Lithium triflates are used in some [[lithium ion batteries]] as a component of the [[electrolyte]].

A mild '''triflating reagent'''  is phenyl triflimide or ''N'',''N''-bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)aniline, where the by-product is [CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N−Ph]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.

[[File:Triflate mesomeric stability transp.png|center|thumb|600px|Triflate mesomeric stability]]

==Triflate salts==
Triflate [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]]s are thermally very stable with melting points up to 350&amp;nbsp;°C for [[sodium]], [[boron]] and [[silver]] salts especially in water-free form. They can be obtained directly from triflic acid and the metal hydroxide or metal carbonate in water. Alternatively, they can be obtained from reacting metal chlorides with neat triflic acid or [[silver triflate]], or from reacting [[barium triflate]] with metal sulfates in water:&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | journal = [[Inorganic Syntheses]] | title = Trifluoromethanesulfonates and Trifluoromethanesulfonato-''O'' Complexes |author1=Dixon, N. E. |author2=Lawrance, G. A. |author3=Lay, P. A. |author4=Sargeson, A. M. |author5=Taube, H. | volume = 28 | pages = 70–76 | doi = 10.1002/9780470132593.ch16 | year = 1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:MCl&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n'' HOTf → M(OTf)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n'' HCl
:MCl&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n'' AgOTf → M(OTf)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n'' AgCl ↓

Metal triflates are used as [[Lewis acid]] catalysts in [[organic chemistry]]. Especially useful are the [[lanthanide triflates]] of the type Ln(OTf)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (where Ln = lanthanide). A related popular catalyst [[scandium triflate]] is used in such reactions as [[aldol reaction]]s and [[Diels-Alder reaction]]s. An example is the [[Mukaiyama aldol addition]] reaction between [[benzaldehyde]] and the [[silyl enol ether]] of [[cyclohexanone]] with an 81% [[chemical yield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kobayashi, S. | title = Scandium Triflate in Organic Synthesis | journal = European Journal of Organic Chemistry | volume = 1999 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–27 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1099-0690(199901)1999:1&lt;15::AID-EJOC15&gt;3.0.CO;2-B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corresponding reaction with the [[yttrium]] salt fails:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="56129">[[File:Neat organized wood drying rack (3947424419).jpg|thumb|Air-drying timber stack]]
'''Wood drying''' (also '''seasoning lumber''' or '''wood seasoning''') reduces the [[moisture content]] of [[wood]] before its use. When the drying is done in a [[kiln]], the product is known as '''kiln-dried''' timber or [[lumber]], whereas air drying is the more traditional method.

There are two main reasons for drying wood:
* ''Woodworking'': when wood is used as a construction material, whether as a structural support in a building or in [[woodworking]] objects, it will absorb or desorb [[moisture]] until it is in equilibrium with its surroundings. Equilibration (usually drying) causes unequal shrinkage in the wood, and can cause damage to the wood if equilibration occurs too rapidly. The equilibration must be controlled to prevent damage to the wood.
* ''Wood burning'': when wood is burned, it is usually best to dry it first. Damage from shrinkage is not a problem here, and the drying may the case of drying for woodworking purposes. Moisture affects the burning process, with unburnt hydrocarbons going up the chimney. If a 50% wet log is burnt at high temperature, with good heat extraction from the exhaust gas leading to a 100&amp;nbsp;°C exhaust [[temperature]], about 5% of the energy of the log is wasted through evaporating and heating the water vapour. With condensers, the efficiency can be further increased; but, for the normal stove, the key to burning wet wood is to burn it very hot, perhaps starting fire with dry wood.

[[File:Ved i store vedsekker til tørk.JPG|thumb|Small firewood logs drying on-site]]
For some purposes, wood is not dried at all, and is used [[Green wood|green]]. Often, wood must be in [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]] with the air outside, as for construction wood, or the air indoors, as for wooden furniture.

Wood is air-dried or dried in a purpose built oven ([[kiln]]). Usually the wood is sawed before drying, but sometimes the log is dried whole.

Case hardening describes lumber or timber that has been dried too rapidly. Wood initially dries from the shell (surface), shrinking the shell and putting the core under compression. When this shell is at a low moisture content it will 'set' and resist shrinkage. The core of the wood is still at a higher moisture content. This core will then begin to dry and shrink. However, any shrinkage is resisted by the already 'set' shell. This leads to reversed stresses; compression stresses on the shell and tension stresses in the core. This results in unrelieved stress called case hardening. Case-hardened [wood] may warp considerably and dangerously when the stress is released by [[sawing]].

==Types of wood==
Wood is divided, according to its botanical origin, into two kinds: softwoods, from coniferous trees, and hardwoods, from broad-leaved trees. Softwoods are lighter and generally simple in structure, whereas hardwoods are harder and more complex. However, in Australia, ''softwood'' generally describes rainforest trees, and ''hardwood'' describes [[sclerophyllous|Sclerophyll]]  species (''Eucalyptus'' ''spp'').

[[Softwoods]] such as pine are typically much lighter and easier to process than [[hardwood]]s such as fruit tree wood.  The [[density]] of softwoods ranges from {{val|350|u=kg/m3}} to {{val|700|u=kg/m3}}, while hardwoods are {{val|450|u=kg/m3}} to {{val|1250|u=kg/m3}}. Once dried, both consist of approximately 12% of moisture (''Desch and Dinwoodie, 1996''). Because of hardwood's denser and more complex structure, its [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] is much less than that of softwood, making it more difficult to dry. Although there are about a hundred times more species of hardwood trees than softwood trees, the ability to be dried and processed faster and more easily makes softwood the main supply of commercial wood today.

==Wood–water relationships==
The timber of living trees and fresh logs contains a large amount of water which often constitutes over 50% of the wood's weight. Water has a significant influence on wood. Wood continually exchanges moisture or water with its surroundings, although the rate of exchange is strongly affected by the degree to which wood is sealed.

Wood contains water in three forms:
# Free water: The bulk of water contained in the cell lumina is only held by capillary forces. It is not bound chemically and is called free water. Free water is not in the same thermodynamic state as liquid water: energy is required to overcome the [[capillary force]]s. Furthermore, free water may contain chemicals, altering the drying characteristics of wood.
# Bound or hygroscopic water: Bound water is bound to the wood via [[hydrogen bond]]s. The attraction of wood for water arises from the presence of free [[hydroxyl]] (OH) groups in the [[cellulose]], [[hemicellulose]]s and [[lignin]] molecules in the cell wall. The hydroxyl groups are negatively charged. Because water is a polar liquid, the free hydroxyl groups in cellulose attract and hold water by hydrogen bonding.
# Vapor: Water in cell lumina in the form of [[water vapour]] is normally negligible at normal temperature and humidity.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

===Moisture content===
The moisture content of wood is calculated by the formula (Siau, 1984):
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{moisture~content} = \frac{m_g-m_{od}} {m_{od}} \times 100\%&lt;/math&gt;
Here, &lt;math&gt;m_g\;&lt;/math&gt; is the green mass of the wood, &lt;math&gt;m_{od}&lt;/math&gt; is its oven dry mass (the attainment of constant mass generally after drying in an oven set at {{val|{{convert|218|F|disp=number}}|{{convert|4|F-change|disp=number|sigfig=1}}|u=°C}} ({{val|218|4|u=°F}})  for 24 hours as mentioned by Walker ''et al.'', 1993). The equation can also be expressed as a fraction of the mass of the water and the mass of the oven dry wood rather than a percentage. For example, {{val|0.59|u=kg/kg}} (oven dry basis) expresses the same moisture content as 59% (oven dry basis).

Students in the United Kingdom would recognise this formula written as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{moisture~content} = \frac{\mathrm{Wet~Weight} - \mathrm{Dry~Weight}}{ \mathrm{Dry~Weight}} \times 100\%&lt;/math&gt;

Where the wet weight is the weight of the original 'wet' sample and the dry weight being the weight of the sample after drying in an oven. Moisture contents being expressed as a percentage.

===Fibre saturation point===
[[File:IPPC markings on wood pallet.JPG|thumb|These [[International Plant Protection Convention|IPPC]] markings on a wood pallet indicate KD: kiln-dried, HT: heat treated, and DB: debarked. Essentially all wood packaging material that is exported to an IPPC member state must have a stamp such as this.]]
When green wood dries, free water from the cell lumina, held by the capillary forces only, is the first to go. Physical properties, such as strength and shrinkage, are generally not affected by the removal of free water. The fibre saturation point (FSP) is defined as the moisture content at which free water should be completely gone, while the cell walls are saturated with bound water. In most types of woods, the fibre saturation point is at 25 to 30% moisture content. Siau (1984) reported that the fibre saturation point &lt;math&gt;X_{fsp} \;&lt;/math&gt; (kg/kg) is dependent on the temperature T (°C) according to the following equation:
:&lt;math&gt;X_{fsp} = 0.30 - 0.001 (T-20) \; &lt;/math&gt; (1.2)

Keey ''et al.'' (2000) use a different definition of the fibre saturation point (equilibrium moisture content of wood in an environment of 99% relative humidity).

Many properties of wood show considerable change as the wood is dried below the fibre saturation point, including:
# volume (ideally no shrinkage occurs until some bound water is lost, that is, until wood is dried below FSP);
# strength (strengths generally increase consistently as the wood is dried below the FSP (Desch and Dinwoodie, 1996), except for impact-bending strength and, in some cases, toughness);
# [[electrical resistivity]], which increases very rapidly with the loss of bound water when the wood dries below the FSP.

===Equilibrium moisture content===
{{Main|Equilibrium moisture content}}

Wood is a [[hygroscopy|hygroscopic]] substance. It has the ability to take in or give off moisture in the form of vapour. Water contained in wood exerts vapour pressure of its own, which is determined by the maximum size of the capillaries filled with water at any time. If water vapour pressure in the ambient space is lower than vapour pressure within wood, desorption takes place. The largest-sized capillaries, which are full of water at the time, empty first. Vapour pressure within the wood falls as water is successively contained in smaller capillaries. A stage is eventually reached when vapour pressure within the wood equals vapour pressure in the ambient space above the wood, and further desorption ceases. The amount of moisture that remains in the wood at this stage is in equilibrium with water vapour pressure in the ambient space, and is termed the equilibrium moisture content or EMC (Siau, 1984). Because of its hygroscopicity, wood tends to reach a moisture content that is in equilibrium with the relative humidity and temperature of the surrounding air.
The EMC of wood varies with the ambient relative humidity (a function of temperature) significantly, to a lesser degree with the temperature. Siau (1984) reported that the EMC also varies very slightly with species, mechanical stress, drying history of wood, density, extractives content and the direction of sorption in which the moisture change takes place (i.e. adsorption or desorption).

===Moisture content of wood in service===
Wood retains its hygroscopic characteristics after it is put into use. It is then subjected to fluctuating humidity, the dominant factor in determining its EMC. These fluctuations may be more or less cyclical, such as diurnal changes or annual seasonal changes.

To minimize the changes in wood moisture content or the movement of wooden objects in service, wood is usually dried to a moisture content that is close to the average EMC conditions to which it will be exposed. These conditions vary for interior uses compared with exterior uses in a given geographic location. For example, according to the Australian Standard for Timber Drying Quality (AS/NZS 4787, 2001), the EMC is recommended to be 10% - 12% for the majority of Australian states, although extreme cases are up to 15 to 18% for some places in Queensland, Northern Territory, Western Australia and Tasmania. However, the EMC is as low as 6 to 7% in dry centrally heated houses and offices or in permanently air-conditioned buildings.

The primary reason for drying wood to a moisture content equivalent to its mean EMC under use conditions is to minimize the dimensional changes (or movement) in the final product.

===Shrinkage and swelling===
Shrinkage and swelling may occur in wood when the moisture content is changed (Stamm, 1964). Shrinkage occurs as moisture content decreases, while swelling takes place when it increases. Volume change is not equal in all directions. The greatest dimensional change occurs in a direction tangential to the growth rings. Shrinkage from the pith outwards, or radially, is usually considerably less than tangential shrinkage, while longitudinal (along the grain) shrinkage is so slight as to be usually neglected. The longitudinal shrinkage is 0.1% to 0.3%, in contrast to transverse shrinkages, which is 2% to 10%. Tangential shrinkage is often about twice as great as in the radial direction, although in some species it is as much as five times as great. The shrinkage is about 5% to 10% in the tangential direction and about 2% to 6% in the radial direction (Walker ''et al.'', 1993).

Differential transverse shrinkage of wood is related to:
# the alternation of late wood and early wood increments within the annual ring;
# the influence of wood rays on the radial direction (Kollmann and Cote, 1968);
# the features of the cell wall structure such as microfibril angle modifications and pits;
# the chemical composition of the middle lamella.

{{Citation style|section|date=August 2014}}
Wood drying may be described as the art of ensuring that gross dimensional changes through shrinkage are confined to the drying process. Ideally, wood is dried to that equilibrium moisture content as will later (in service) be attained by the wood. Thus, further dimensional change will be kept to a minimum.

It is probably impossible to completely eliminate dimensional change in wood, but elimination of change in size may be approximated by chemical modification. For example, wood can be treated with chemicals to replace the hydroxyl groups with other hydrophobic functional groups of modifying agents (Stamm, 1964). Among all the existing processes, wood modification with [[acetic anhydride]] has been noted for the high anti-shrink or anti-swell efficiency (ASE) attainable without damage to wood. However, acetylation of wood has been slow to be commercialised due to the cost, corrosion and the entrapment of the acetic acid in wood. There is an extensive volume of literature relating to the chemical modification of wood (Rowell, 1983, 1991; Kumar, 1994; Haque, 1997).

Drying timber is one method of adding value to sawn products from the primary wood processing industries. According to the Australian Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation (FWPRDC), green sawn hardwood, which is sold at about $350 per cubic metre or less, increases in value to $2,000 per cubic metre or more with drying and processing. However, currently used conventional drying processes often result in significant quality problems from cracks, both externally and internally, reducing the value of the product. For example, in Queensland (Anon, 1997), on the assumption that 10% of the dried softwood is devalued by $200 per cubic metre because of drying defects, saw millers are losing about $5 million a year. In Australia, the loss could be $40 million a year for softwood and an equal or higher amount for hardwood. Thus, proper drying under controlled conditions prior to use is of great importance in timber use, in countries where climatic conditions vary considerably at different times of the year. {{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Drying, if carried out promptly after felling of trees, also protects timber against primary decay, fungal stain and attack by certain kinds of insects. Organisms, which cause decay and stain, generally cannot thrive in timber with a moisture content below 20%. Several, though not all, insect pests can live only in green timber.

In addition to the above advantages of drying timber, the following points are also significant (Walker ''et al.'', 1993; Desch and Dinwoodie, 1996):
# Dried timber is lighter, and the transportation and handling costs are reduced.
# Dried timber is stronger than green timber in most strength properties.
# Timbers for impregnation with preservatives have to be properly dried if proper penetration is to be accomplished, particularly in the case of oil-type preservatives.
# In the field of chemical modification of wood and wood products, the material should be dried to a certain moisture content for the appropriate reactions to occur.
# Dry wood generally works, machines, finishes and glues better than green timber (although there are exceptions; for instance, green wood is often easier to turn than dry wood). Paints and finishes last longer on dry timber.
# The electrical and thermal insulation properties of wood are improved by drying.

Prompt drying of wood immediately after felling therefore significantly upgrades and adds value to raw timber. Drying enables substantial long-term economy by rationalizing the use of timber resources. The drying of wood is thus an area for research and development, which concern many researchers and timber companies around the world.

===Mechanisms of moisture movement===
Water in wood normally moves from zones of higher to zones of lower moisture content (Walker ''et al.'', 1993). Drying starts from the exterior of the wood and moves towards the centre, and drying at the outside is also necessary to expel moisture from the inner zones of the wood. Wood subsequently attains equilibrium with the surrounding air in moisture content.

====Moisture passageways====
The driving force of moisture movement is chemical potential. However, it is not always easy to relate chemical potential in wood to commonly observable variables, such as temperature and moisture content (Keey ''et al.'', 2000). Moisture in wood moves within the wood as liquid or vapour through several types of passageways, based on the nature of the driving force, (e.g. pressure or moisture gradient), and variations in wood structure (Langrish and Walker, 1993), as explained in the next section on driving forces for moisture movement. These pathways consist of cavities of the vessels, fibres, ray cells, pit chambers and their pit membrane openings, intercellular spaces and transitory cell wall passageways.

Movement of water takes place in these passageways in any direction, longitudinally in the cells, as well as laterally from cell to cell until it reaches the lateral drying surfaces of the wood. The higher longitudinal permeability of sapwood of hardwood is generally caused by the presence of vessels. The lateral permeability and transverse flow is often very low in hardwoods. The vessels in hardwoods are sometimes blocked by the presence of tyloses and/or by secreting gums and resins in some other species, as mentioned earlier. The presence of gum veins, the formation of which is often a result of natural protective response of trees to injury, is commonly observed on the surface of sawn boards of most eucalypts. Despite the generally higher volume fraction of rays in hardwoods (typically 15% of wood volume), the rays are not particularly effective in radial flow, nor are the pits on the radial surfaces of fibres effective in tangential flow (Langrish and Walker, 1993).

====Moisture movement space====
The available space for air and moisture in wood depends on the density and porosity of wood. Porosity is the volume fraction of void space in a solid. The porosity is reported to be 1.2 to 4.6% of dry volume of wood cell wall (Siau, 1984). On the other hand, permeability is a measure of the ease with which fluids are transported through a porous solid under the influence of some driving forces, e.g. capillary pressure gradient or moisture gradient. It is clear that solids must be porous to be permeable, but it does not necessarily follow that all porous bodies are permeable. Permeability can only exist if the void spaces are interconnected by openings. For example, a hardwood may be permeable because there is intervessel pitting with openings in the membranes (Keey ''et al.'', 2000). If these membranes are occluded or encrusted, or if the pits are aspirated, the wood assumes a closed-cell structure and may be virtually impermeable. The density is also important for impermeable hardwoods because more cell-wall material is traversed per unit distance, which offers increased resistance to diffusion (Keey ''et al.'', 2000). Hence lighter woods, in general, dry more rapidly than do the heavier woods. The transport of fluids is often bulk flow (momentum transfer) for permeable softwoods at high temperature while diffusion occurs for impermeable hardwoods (Siau, 1984). These mechanisms are discussed below.

===Driving forces for moisture movement===
Three main driving forces used in different version of diffusion models are moisture content, the partial pressure of water vapour, and the chemical potential (Skaar, 1988; Keey ''et al.'', 2000). These are discussed here, including capillary action, which is a mechanism for free water transport in permeable softwoods. Total pressure difference is the driving force during wood vacuum drying.

====Capillary action====
Capillary forces determine the movements (or absence of movement) of free water. It is due to both adhesion and cohesion. Adhesion is the attraction between water to other substances and cohesion is the attraction of the molecules in water to each other.

As wood dries, evaporation of water from the surface sets up capillary forces that exert a pull on the free water in the zones of wood beneath the surfaces. When there is no longer any free water in the wood capillary forces are no longer of importance.

====Moisture content differences====
The chemical potential is explained here since it is the true driving force for the transport of water in both liquid and vapour phases in wood (Siau, 1984). The Gibbs free energy per mole of substance is usually expressed as the chemical potential (Skaar, 1933). The chemical potential of unsaturated air or wood below the fibre saturation point influences the drying of wood. Equilibrium will occur at the equilibrium moisture content (as defined earlier) of wood when the chemical potential of the wood becomes equal to that of the surrounding air. The chemical potential of sorbed water is a function of wood moisture content. Therefore, a gradient of wood moisture content (between surface and centre), or more specifically of activity, is accompanied by a gradient of chemical potential under isothermal conditions. Moisture will redistribute itself throughout the wood until the chemical potential is uniform throughout, resulting in a zero potential gradient at equilibrium (Skaar, 1988). The flux of moisture attempting to achieve the equilibrium state is assumed to be proportional to the difference in chemical potential, and inversely proportional to the path length over which the potential difference acts (Keey ''et al.'', 2000).

The gradient in chemical potential is related to the moisture content gradient as explained in above equations (Keey ''et al.'', 2000). The diffusion model using moisture content gradient as a driving force was applied successfully by Wu (1989) and Doe ''et al.'' (1994). Though the agreement between the moisture-content profiles predicted by the diffusion model based on moisture-content gradients is better at lower moisture contents than at higher ones, there is no evidence to suggest that there are significantly different moisture-transport mechanisms operating at higher moisture contents for this timber. Their observations are consistent with a transport process that is driven by the total concentration of water. The diffusion model is used for this thesis based on this empirical evidence that the moisture-content gradient is a driving force for drying this type of impermeable timber.

Differences in moisture content between the surface and the centre (gradient, the chemical potential difference between interface and bulk) move the bound water through the small passageways in the cell wall by diffusion. In comparison with capillary movement, diffusion is a slow process. Diffusion is the generally suggested mechanism for the drying of impermeable hardwoods (Keey ''et al.'', 2000). Furthermore, moisture migrates slowly due to the fact that extractives plug the small cell wall openings in the heartwood. This is why sapwood generally dries faster than heartwood under the same drying conditions.

====Moisture movement directions for diffusion====
It is reported that the ratio of the longitudinal to the transverse (radial and tangential) diffusion rates for wood ranges from about 100 at a moisture content of 5%, to 2 - 4 at a moisture content of 25% (Langrish and Walker, 1993). Radial diffusion is somewhat faster than tangential diffusion. Although longitudinal diffusion is most rapid, it is of practical importance only when short pieces are dried. Generally the timber boards are much longer than in width or thickness. For example, a typical size of a green board used for this research was 6 m long, 250&amp;nbsp;mm in width and 43&amp;nbsp;mm in thickness. If the boards are quartersawn, then the width will be in the radial direction whereas the thickness will be in tangential direction, and vice versa for plain-sawn boards.  Most of the moisture is removed from wood by lateral movement during drying.

===Reasons for splits and cracks during timber drying and their control===
The chief difficulty experienced in the drying of timber is the tendency of its outer layers to dry out more rapidly than the interior ones. If these layers are allowed to dry much below the fibre saturation point while the interior is still saturated, stresses (called drying stresses) are set up because the shrinkage of the outer layers is restricted by the wet interior (Keey ''et al.'', 2000). Rupture in the wood tissues occurs, and consequently splits and cracks occur if these stresses across the grain exceed the strength across the grain (fibre to fibre bonding).

The successful control of drying defects in a drying process consists in maintaining a balance between the rate of evaporation of moisture from the surface and the rate of outward movement of moisture from the interior of the wood. The way in which drying can be controlled will now be explained. One of the most successful ways of wood drying or seasoning would be kiln drying, where the wood is placed into a kiln compartment in stacks and dried by steaming, and releasing the steam slowly.

===Influence of temperature, relative humidity and rate of air circulation===
The external drying conditions (temperature, relative humidity and air velocity) control the external boundary conditions for drying, and hence the drying rate, as well as affecting the rate of internal moisture movement. The drying rate is affected by external drying conditions (Walker ''et al.'', 1993; Keey ''et al.'', 2000), as will now be described.

Temperature: If the relative humidity is kept constant, the higher the temperature, the higher the drying rate. Temperature influences the drying rate by increasing the moisture holding capacity of the air, as well as by accelerating the diffusion rate of moisture through the wood.
The actual temperature in a drying kiln is the dry-bulb temperature (usually denoted by Tg), which is the temperature of a vapour-gas mixture determined by inserting a thermometer with a dry bulb. On the other hand, the wet-bulb temperature (TW) is defined as the temperature reached by a small amount of liquid evaporating in a large amount of an unsaturated air-vapour mixture. The temperature sensing element of this thermometer is kept moist with a porous fabric sleeve (cloth) usually put in a reservoir of clean water. A minimum air flow of 2&amp;nbsp;m/s is needed to prevent a zone of stagnant damp air formation around the sleeve (Walker ''et al.'', 1993). Since air passes over the wet sleeve, water is evaporated and cools the wet-bulb thermometer. The difference between the dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures, the wet-bulb depression, is used to determine the relative humidity from a standard hygrometric chart (Walker ''et al.'', 1993). A higher difference between the dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures indicates a lower relative humidity. For example, if the dry-bulb temperature is 100&amp;nbsp;°C and wet-bulb temperature 60&amp;nbsp;°C, then the relative humidity is read as 17% from a hygrometric chart.

[[Relative humidity]]: The relative humidity of air is defined as the partial pressure of water vapour divided by the saturated vapour pressure at the same temperature and total pressure (Siau, 1984). If the temperature is kept constant, lower relative humidities result in higher drying rates due to the increased moisture gradient in wood, resulting from the reduction of the moisture content in the surface layers when the relative humidity of air is reduced. The relative humidity is usually expressed on a percentage basis. For drying, the other essential parameter related to relative humidity is the absolute humidity, which is the mass of water vapour per unit mass of dry air (kg of water per kg of dry air).However, its influenced by the amount of water in the heated air.

Air circulation rate: Drying time and timber quality depend on the air velocity and its uniform circulation. At a constant temperature and relative humidity, the highest possible drying rate is obtained by rapid circulation of air across the surface of wood, giving rapid removal of moisture evaporating from the wood. However, a higher drying rate is not always desirable, particularly for impermeable hardwoods, because higher drying rates develop greater stresses that may cause the timber to crack or distort. At very low fan speeds, less than 1&amp;nbsp;m/s, the air flow through the stack is often laminar flow, and the heat transfer between the timber surface and the moving air stream is not particularly effective (Walker ''et al.'', 1993). The low effectiveness (externally) of heat transfer is not necessarily a problem if internal moisture movement is the key limitation to the movement of moisture, as it is for most hardwoods (Pordage and Langrish, 1999).

===Classification of timbers for drying===
The timbers are classified as follows according to their ease of drying and their proneness to drying degrade:

# Highly refractory woods: These woods are slow and difficult to dry if the final product is to be free from defects, particularly cracks and splits. Examples are heavy structural timbers with high density such as ironbark (''Eucalyptus paniculata''), blackbutt (''E. pilularis''), southern blue gum (''E. globulus'') and brush box (''Lophostemon cofertus''). They require considerable protection and care against rapid drying conditions for the best results (Bootle, 1994).
# Moderately refractory woods: These timbers show a moderate tendency to crack and split during seasoning. They can be seasoned free from defects with moderately rapid drying conditions (i.e. a maximum dry-bulb temperature of 85&amp;nbsp;°C can be used). Examples are Sydney blue gum (''E. saligna'') and other timbers of medium density (Bootle, 1994), which are potentially suitable for furniture.
# Non-refractory woods: These woods can be rapidly seasoned to be free from defects even by applying high temperatures (dry-bulb temperatures of more than 100&amp;nbsp;°C) in industrial kilns. If not dried rapidly, they may develop discolouration (blue stain) and mould on the surface. Examples are softwoods and low density timbers such as ''Pinus radiata''.

===Model===
The rate at which wood dries depends upon a number of factors, the most important of which are the temperature, the dimensions of the wood, and the relative humidity. Simpson and Tschernitz&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Simpson |first=William |author2=John Tschernitz |title=Importance of Thickness Variation in Kiln Drying Red Oak Lumber |publisher=Western Dry Kiln Clubs |location=Corvallis, Oregon |date=1979 |url=http://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/dspace/bitstream/1957/5722/1/Importance_Thick_ocr.pdf |accessdate=2008-11-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have developed a simple model of wood drying as a function of these three variables. Although the analysis was done for red oak, the procedure may be applied to any species of wood by adjusting the constant parameters of the model.

Simply put, the model assumes that the rate of change of the moisture content ''M'' with respect to time ''t'' is proportional to how far the wood sample is from its [[equilibrium moisture content]] &lt;math&gt;M_e&lt;/math&gt;, which is a function of the temperature ''T'' and relative humidity ''h'':
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dM}{dt}=-\frac{M-M_e}{\tau}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is a function of the temperature ''T'' and a typical wood dimension ''L'' and has units of time. The typical wood dimension is roughly the smallest value of (&lt;math&gt;L_r,\,L_t,\,L_L/10&lt;/math&gt;) which are the radial, tangential and longitudinal dimensions respectively, in inches, with the longitudinal dimension divided by ten because water diffuses about 10 times more rapidly in the longitudinal direction (along the grain) than in the lateral dimensions. The solution to the above equation is:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{M-M_e}{M_0-M_e}=e^{-t/\tau}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; is the initial moisture content. It was found that for red oak lumber, the "time constant" &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; was well expressed as:
:&lt;math&gt;\tau=\frac{L^n}{a+bp_\text{sat}(T)}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'', ''b'' and ''n'' are constants and &lt;math&gt;p_\text{sat}(T)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[vapor pressure of water|saturation vapor pressure of water]] at temperature ''T''. For time measured in days, length in inches, and &lt;math&gt;p_\text{sat}&lt;/math&gt; measured in mmHg, the following values of the constants were found for red oak lumber.
:''a'' = 0.0575
:''b'' = 0.00142
:''n'' = 1.52

Solving for the drying time yields:
:&lt;math&gt;t=-\tau\,\ln\left(\frac{M-M_e}{M_0-M_e}\right)=\frac{-L^n}{a+bp_\text{sat}(T)}\,\ln\left(\frac{M-M_e}{M_0-M_e}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

For example, at 150 deg F, using the [[Arden Buck equation]], the saturation vapor pressure of water is found to be about 192 mmHg. The time constant for drying a {{convert|1|in|mm|adj=mid|-thick}} red oak board at 150 deg F is then &lt;math&gt;\tau=3.03&lt;/math&gt; days, which is the time required to reduce the moisture content to 1/e = 37% of its initial deviation from equilibrium. If the relative humidity is 0.50, then using the [[equilibrium moisture content|Hailwood-Horrobin equation]] the moisture content of the wood at equilibrium is about 7.4%. The time to reduce the lumber from 85% moisture content to 25% moisture content is then about 4.5 days.  Higher temperatures will yield faster drying times, but they will also create greater stresses in the wood due because the moisture [[gradient]] will be larger. For firewood, this is not an issue but for woodworking purposes, high stresses will cause the wood to crack and be unusable. Normal drying times to obtain minimal seasoning checks (cracks) in 25mm (1 inch or 4/4 lumber) Red Oak ranges from 22 to 30 days, and in 8/4, (50mm or 2 inch) it will range from 65 to 90 days.

==Methods of drying timber==
Broadly, there are two methods by which timber can be dried:
* natural drying or air drying
* artificial drying

===Air drying===
Air drying is the drying of timber by exposing it to the air. The technique of air drying consists mainly of making a stack of sawn timber (with the layers of boards separated by stickers) on raised foundations, in a clean, cool, dry and shady place. Rate of drying largely depends on climatic conditions, and on the air movement (exposure to the wind). For successful air drying, a continuous and uniform flow of air throughout the pile of the timber needs to be arranged (Desch and Dinwoodie, 1996).

The rate of loss of moisture can be controlled by coating the planks with any substance that is relatively impermeable to moisture; ordinary mineral oil is usually quite effective. Coating the ends of logs with oil or thick paint improves their quality upon drying. Wrapping planks or logs in materials which will allow some movement of moisture, generally works very well provided the wood is first treated against fungal infection by coating in petrol/gasoline or oil. Mineral oil will generally not soak in more than 1–2&amp;nbsp;mm below the surface and is easily removed by planing when the timber is suitably dry. 
* Benefits: It can be less expensive to use this drying method (there are still costs associated with storing the wood, and with the slower process of getting the wood to market), and air drying often produces a higher quality, more easily workable wood than with kiln drying.  
* Drawbacks: Depending on the climate, it takes several months to a number of years to air-dry the wood.

===Kiln drying===
[[File:Wood Drying Room.JPG|thumb|Large wood-drying kiln, used for maple]]
The process of artificial or 'oven' drying consists basically of introducing heat. This may be directly, using natural gas and/or electricity or indirectly, through steam-heated heat exchangers. Solar energy is also an option. In the process, deliberate control of temperature, relative humidity and air circulation creates variable conditions to achieve specific drying profiles. To achieve this, the timber is stacked in chambers, which are fitted with equipment to control atmospheric temperature, relative humidity and circulation rate (Walker ''et al.', 1993; Desch and Dinwoodie, 1996).

Chamber drying provides a means of overcoming the limitations imposed by erratic weather conditions. With kiln drying, as is the case with air drying, unsaturated air is used as the drying medium. Almost all commercial timbers of the world are dried in industrial kilns. A comparison of air drying, conventional kiln and solar drying is given below:
# Timber can be dried to any desired low-moisture content by conventional or solar kiln drying, but in air drying, moisture contents of less than 18% are difficult to attain for most locations.
# The drying times are considerably less in conventional kiln drying than in solar kiln drying, followed by air drying.
#* This means that if capital outlay is involved, this capital sits for a longer time when air drying is used. On the other hand, installing, operating and maintaining an industrial kiln is expensive.
#* In addition, wood that is being air dried takes up space, which could also cost money.
# In air drying, there is little control over the drying conditions, so drying rates cannot be controlled.
# The temperatures employed in kiln drying typically kill all the fungi and insects in the wood if a maximum dry-bulb temperature of above 60&amp;nbsp;°C is used for the drying schedule. This is not guaranteed in air drying.
# If air drying is done improperly (exposed to the sun), the rate of drying may be overly rapid in the dry summer months, causing cracking and splitting, and too slow during the cold winter months.

Significant advantages of conventional kiln drying include higher throughput and better control of the final moisture content. Conventional kilns and solar drying both enable wood to be dried to any moisture content regardless of weather conditions. For most large-scale drying operations solar and conventional kiln drying are more efficient than air drying.

Compartment-type kilns are most commonly used in timber companies. A compartment kiln is filled with a static batch of timber through which air is circulated. In these types of kiln, the timber remains stationary. The drying conditions are successively varied according to the type of timber being dried. This drying method is well suited to the needs of timber companies, which have to dry timbers of varied species and thickness, including refractory hardwoods that are more liable than other species to check and split.

The main elements of chamber drying are:
* Construction materials
: The chambers are generally built of brick masonry, or hollow cement-concrete slabs. Sheet metal or prefabricated aluminium in a double-walled construction with sandwiched thermal insulation, such as glass wool or polyurethane foams, are materials that are also used in some modern timber ovens.  However, brick masonry chambers, with lime and (mortar) plaster on the inside and painted with impermeable coatings, are used widely and have been found to be satisfactory for many applications.
* Heating
: Heating is usually carried out by steam heat exchangers and pipes of various configurations (e.g. plain, or finned (transverse or longitudinal) tubes) or by large flue pipes through which hot gases from a wood burning furnace are passed. Only occasionally is electricity or gas employed for heating.
* Humidification
: Humidification is commonly accomplished by introducing live steam into the kiln through a steam spray pipe. In order to limit and control the humidity of the air when large quantities of moisture are being rapidly evaporated from the timber, there is normally a provision for ventilation of the chamber in all types of kilns.
* Air circulation
: Air circulation is the means for carrying the heat to and the moisture away from all parts of a load. Forced circulation kilns are most common, where the air is circulated by means of fans or blowers, which may be installed outside the kiln chamber (external fan kiln) or inside it (internal fan kiln).
Throughout the process, it is necessary to keep close control of the moisture content using a moisture meter system in order to reduce over-drying and allow operators to know when to pull the charge. Preferably, this in-kiln moisture meter will have an auto-shutoff feature.

====Kiln drying schedules====
Satisfactory kiln drying can usually be accomplished by regulating the temperature and humidity of the circulating air to control the moisture content of the lumber at any given time. This condition is achieved by applying kiln-drying schedules. The desired objective of an appropriate schedule is to ensure drying lumber at the fastest possible rate without causing objectionable degrade. The following factors have a considerable bearing on the schedules.

# The species: Variations in anatomical, physical, and mechanical properties between species affect drying times and overall results.
# The thickness of the lumber: Drying time is inversely related to thickness and, to some extent, the width of the lumber.
# Whether the lumber boards are quarter-sawn, flat-sawn, or bastard-sawn (mixed-sawn): Sawing pattern influences the distortion due to shrinkage anisotropy.
# Permissible drying degrade: Aggressive drying schedules can cause timber to crack and distort.
# Intended use of timber: Mechanical and aesthetic requirements will necessitate different moisture targets depending on the intended use.
Considering each of the factors, no one schedule is necessarily appropriate, even for similar loads of the same species. This is why there is so much timber drying research focused on the development of effective drying schedules.

===Dehumidification kiln===
A dehumidification chamber can be an unvented system (closed loop) or a partially vented system which uses a heat pump to condense moisture from the air using cold side of the refrigeration process (evaporator.) The heat thus gathered is sent to the hot side of the refrigeration process (condenser) to re-heat the air and returns this drier and warmer air inside the kiln. Fans blow the air through the piles as in a normal kiln. These kilns traditionally operate from 100&amp;nbsp;°F to 160&amp;nbsp;°F and use about half the energy of a conventional kiln.&lt;ref name="FHB"&gt;Multiple authors. ''Fine woodworking on wood and how to dry it: 41 articles''. Newtown, Conn.: Taunton Press, 1986. 86-89. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vacuum kiln===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}
These kilns can be the fastest to dry and most efficient with energy usage. At a vacuum water boils at a lower temperature. In addition to speed a vacuum kiln can also produce an improved quality in the wood.

===Solar kiln===
A solar kiln is a cross between kiln drying and air drying. These kilns are generally a [[greenhouse]] with a high-temperature fan and either vents or a condensing system. Solar kilns are slower and variable due to the weather, but are low cost.&lt;ref name="FHB" /&gt;

===Water seasoning===
Immersion in running water quickly removes sap and then the wood is air dried. "...it reduces the elasticity and durability of the wood and also makes it brittle."&lt;ref&gt;Riley, J. W.. ''A manual of carpentry and joinery'',. London: Macmillan and co., limited;, 1905. 8. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  But there are competing perspectives, e.g., "Duhamel, who made many experiments on this important subject, states, that timber for the joiner's use is best put in water for some time, and afterwards dried; as it renders the timber less liable to warp and crack in drying; but, he adds, 'where strength is required it ought not to be put in water.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chestofbooks.com/home-improvement/woodworking/Carpentry-Principles/451-Water-Seasoning.html|title=451. Water Seasoning|author=|date=|website=chestofbooks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boiling or steam seasoning===
Submersion in boiling water or the application of steam speed the drying of wood. This method is said to cause less shrinkage "...but it is expensive to use, and reduces the strength and elasticity of the timber."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Percy Guillemard Llewellyn. ''Notes on building construction''. London: Longmans, Greene and Co., 1891. 390.Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical or salt seasoning===
Salt seasoning is the submersion of wood in a solution of urea, sodium nitrate, all of which act as dehydrating agents. Then the wood is air dried.&lt;ref name="Punmia"&gt;Punmia, B.C., Ashok Kumar Jain, and Arun Kumar Jain. ''Basic civil engineering: for B.E. / B.Tech first year courses of various universities including M.D.U. and K.U''., Haryana. New Delhi: Laxmi Publications, 2003. 85. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electrical seasoning===
Electrical seasoning involves running an electric current through the lumber causing heat to build up drying the wood. This method is expensive but is fast and uniform quality.&lt;ref name="Punmia" /&gt;

==Drying defects==
Drying defects are the most common form of degrade in timber, next to natural problems such as knots (Desch and Dinwoodie, 1996).
There are two types of drying defects, although some defects involve both causes:
# Defects from shrinkage anisotropy, resulting in warping: cupping, bowing, twisting, crooking, spring and diamonding.
# Defects from uneven drying, resulting in the rupture of the wood tissue, such as checks (surface, end and internal), end splits, honey-combing and case hardening. Collapse, often shown as corrugation, or "washboarding" of the wood surface, may also occur (Innes, 1996). Collapse is a defect that results from the physical flattening of fibres to above the fibre saturation point and is thus not a form of shrinkage anisotropy.

The standard organizations in Australia and New Zealand (AS/NZS 4787, 2001) have developed a standard for timber quality. The five measures of drying quality include:
# moisture content gradient and presence of residual drying stress (case-hardening);
# surface, internal and end checks;
# collapse;
# distortions;
# discolouration caused by drying.

==Wood-drying kiln==

A variety of wood drying kiln technologies exist today:  conventional, dehumidification, solar, vacuum and radio frequency.

Conventional wood dry kilns (Rasmussen, 1988) are either package-type (sideloader) or track-type (tram) construction. Most hardwood lumber kilns are sideloader kilns in which fork trucks are used to load lumber packages into the kiln. Most softwood lumber kilns are track types in which lumber packages are loaded on kiln/track cars for loading the kiln.

Modern high-temperature, high-air-velocity conventional kilns can typically dry {{convert|1|in|mm|adj=mid|-thick}} green lumber in 10 hours down to a moisture content of 18%. However, 1-inch-thick green Red Oak requires about 28 days to dry down to a moisture content of 8%.

Heat is typically introduced via steam running through fin/tube heat exchangers controlled by on/off pneumatic valves.  Less common are proportional pneumatic valves or even various electrical actuators.  Humidity is removed via a system of vents, the specific layout of which are usually particular to a given manufacturer.  In general, cool dry air is introduced at one end of the kiln while warm moist air is expelled at the other.  Hardwood conventional kilns also require the introduction of humidity via either steam spray or cold water misting systems to keep the relative humidity inside the kiln from dropping too low during the drying cycle.  Fan directions are typically reversed periodically to ensure even drying of larger kiln charges.

Most softwood lumber kilns operate below {{convert|115|C|0|abbr=on}} temperature. Hardwood lumber kiln drying schedules typically keep the dry bulb temperature below {{convert|80|C|0|abbr=on}}. Difficult-to-dry species might not exceed {{convert|60|C|0|abbr=on}}.

Dehumidification kilns are very similar to conventional kilns in basic construction.  Drying times are usually comparable.  Heat is primarily supplied by an integral dehumidification unit which also serves to remove humidity.  Auxiliary heat is often provided early in the schedule where the heat required may exceed the heat generated by the DH unit.

Solar kilns are conventional kilns, typically built by hobbyists to keep initial investment costs low.  Heat is provided via solar radiation, while internal air circulation is typically passive.

In 1949 a Chicago company introduced a wood drying kiln that used infrared lamps that they claimed reduced the standard drying time from 14 days to 45 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GtkDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=popular+mechanics+July+1932+airplane&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=IoAZTePWB-DRnAe63OjPDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwBjg8#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Infrared Oven Dries Wood"] ''Popular Mechanics'', July 1949&lt;/ref&gt;

Newer wood drying technologies have included the use of reduced atmospheric pressure to attempt to speed up the drying process.  A variety of vacuum technologies exist, varying primarily in the method heat is introduced into the wood charge.  Hot water platten vacuum kilns use aluminum heating plates with the water circulating within as the heat source, and typically operate at significantly reduced absolute pressure.  Discontinuous and SSV (super-heated steam) use atmosphere to introduce heat into the kiln charge.  Discontinuous technology allows the entire kiln charge to come up to full atmospheric pressure, the air in the chamber is then heated, and finally vacuum is pulled.  SSV run at partial atmospheres (typically around 1/3 of full atmospheric pressure) in a hybrid of vacuum and conventional kiln technology (SSV kilns are significantly more popular in Europe where the locally harvested wood is easier to dry versus species found in North America).  RF/V (radio frequency + vacuum) kilns use microwave radiation to heat the kiln charge, and typically have the highest operating cost due to the heat of vaporization being provided by electricity rather than local fossil fuel or waste wood sources.

Valid economic studies of different wood drying technologies are based on the total energy, capital, insurance/risk, environmental impacts, labor, maintenance, and product degrade costs for the task of removing water from the wood fiber. These costs (which can be a significant part of the entire plant costs)involve the differential impact of the presence of drying equipment in a specific plant. An example of this is that every piece of equipment (in a lumber manufacturing plant) from the green trimmer to the infeed system at the planer mill is the "drying system". Since thousands of different types of wood products manufacturing plants exist around the globe, and may be integrated (lumber, plywood, paper, etc.) or stand alone (lumber only), the true costs of the drying system can only be determined when comparing the total plant costs and risks with and without drying.

The total (harmful) air emissions produced by wood kilns, including their heat source, can be significant. Typically, the higher the temperature the kiln operates at, the larger amount of emissions are produced (per pound of water removed). This is especially true in the drying of thin veneers and high-temperature drying of softwoods.
