Born '''Abhay Charan De''' in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], he was educated at the [[Scottish Church College]] in Calcutta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Constance|title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism|year=2007|publisher=Infobase Publishing|location=New York|isbn=0-8160-5458-4|pages=77–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before adopting the life of a pious renunciant ([[vanaprastha]]) in 1950,&lt;ref name="SDG6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Goswami|2002|loc=Vol.1 Chapter 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was married with children and owned a small [[pharmaceutical]] business.&lt;ref name="Rodes" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "SDG4"/&gt; In 1959 he took a vow of renunciation ([[sannyasa]]) and started writing commentaries on Vaishnava scriptures.&lt;ref name = "SDG9"/&gt; In his later years, as a travelling Vaishnava monk, he became an influential communicator of Gaudiya Vaishnava theology to India and specifically to the [[Western world|West]] through his leadership of ISKCON, founded in 1966.&lt;ref name = kk2/&gt;&lt;ref name="ex23"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ekstrand|Bryant|2004|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the founder of ISKCON, he "emerged as a major figure of the Western [[counterculture]], initiating thousands of young Americans."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Klostermaier|2007|p=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received criticism from [[Anti-cult movement|anti-cult groups]], as well as a favourable welcome from [[religious scholar]]s such as J. Stillson Judah, [[Harvey Cox]], [[Larry Shinn]] and [[Thomas J. Hopkins|Thomas Hopkins]], who praised Bhaktivedanta Swami's translations and defended the group against distorted media images and misinterpretations.&lt;ref name="Vasan2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Vasan|Lewis|2005|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; In respect to his achievements, religious leaders from other Gaudiya Vaishnava movements have also given him credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

He has been described as a [[Charismatic authority|charismatic leader]], in the sense used by sociologist [[Max Weber]], as he was successful in acquiring followers in the United States, Europe, India and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;"Unrecognized charisma?

In February 2014, ISKCON's news agency reported reaching a milestone of distributing over half a billion of his books since 1965.  His translation and commentaries of the ''[[Bhagavad-Gītā As It Is]]'' is considered by adherents to the ISKCON movement and many Vedic scholars as one of the finest literary works of [[Vaishnavism]] translated into the English Language.&lt;ref name="Smullen"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://iskconnews.org/bbt-reaches-half-a-billion-books-distributed-since-1965,4286/ | title = BBT Reaches Half a Billion Books Distributed Since 1965 | accessdate = 27 February 2014 | last = Smullen | first = Madhava | date = 12 February 2014 | publisher = ISKCON News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

== Life ==

===Early life===
Born on 4 September 1896, the day after [[Janmastami]], one of the most important Vaishnava holidays, in a humble house in the [[Tollygunge]] suburb of Calcutta in a Bengali [[Suvarna Banik]] family,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bvml.org/contemporary/sankarsan.html|title=Interview with Srila Prabhupada's Grand-Nephew - Sankarsan Prabhu|website=bvml.org|access-date=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was named Abhay Charan, "''one who is fearless'', ''having taken shelter at Lord [[Krishna]]'s feet''." Since he was born on the day of Nandotsava ("the celebration of [[Nanda (mythology)|Nanda]]," Krishna's father, a traditional festival in honour of Krishna's birth) he was also called Nandulal. His parents, Sriman Gour Mohan De and Srimati Rajani De, were devout [[Vaishnava]]s (devotees of [[Vishnu]]). In accordance with [[Bengali people|Bengali]] tradition, his mother had gone to the home of her parents for the delivery, and only a few days later Abhay returned with parents to his home at 6 Sitakanta Banerjee Lane Kolkata 700005.&lt;ref name = "SDG2"/&gt;

He received a European-led education in the [[Scottish Church College]], which was well reputed among Bengalis; many Vaishnava families sent their sons there. The professors, most of whom were Europeans, were known as sober, moral men, and it is believed that the students received a good education. The college was located in north Calcutta, near the De's family home on Harrison Road. During his years in the college, Abhay Charan De (অভয়চরণ দে) was a member of the English Society as well as that of the [[Sanskrit]] Society, and it has been suggested that his education provided him a foundation for his future leadership.&lt;ref name="Rodes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SDG2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Goswami|2002|loc=Vol.1 Chapter 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated in 1920 with majors in English, philosophy and economics.&lt;ref name="Vasan"&gt;{{Harvnb|Vasan|Lewis|2005|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; He rejected his diploma in response to Gandhi's independence movement.&lt;ref&gt;Eggenberger, D. 1989. ''Encyclopedia of World Biography: A to F''.&lt;/ref&gt;

At 22 years of age he married Radharani Devi, who was then 11 years old, in a [[arranged marriage|marriage arranged]] by their parents. At 14, she gave birth to Abhay's first son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prabhupada.org.uk/articles1/48_53/48.htm|title=Srila Prabjupada's marriage|accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious journey===
[[File:Bhaktisiddhanta.jpg|thumb|216x216px|[[Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura]]]]
{{Vaishnavism}}
In 1922, when he first met his [[parampara|spiritual master]], [[Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura]], he was requested to spread the message of [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] in the English language.&lt;ref name="SDGPRA"&gt;{{Harvnb|Goswami|1984|loc=page xv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933 he became a formally initiated disciple of Bhaktisiddhanta. In 1944, (from his front room at Sita Kanta Banerjee, Calcutta), he started the publication called ''[[Back to Godhead]]'',&lt;ref name = hk34/&gt;&lt;ref name="SDGPRA1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Goswami|1984|loc=page xviii}}&lt;/ref&gt; for which he acted as writer, designer, publisher, editor, copy editor and distributor. He personally designed the logo, an effulgent figure of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in the upper left corner, with the motto: "''Godhead is Light, Nescience is darkness''" greeting the readers.&lt;ref name="SDG5"&gt;{{Harvnb|Goswami|2002|loc=Vol. 1 Chapter 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first magazine he wrote:

{{quote|Under the circumstances since 1936 up to now, I was simply speculating whether I shall venture this difficult task and that without any means and capacity; but as none have discouraged me, I have now taken courage to take up the work.|A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami|Back to Godhead magazine (Vol. 1, 1–4, 1944)&lt;ref name="SDG5" /&gt;}}

In 1947, the Gaudiya Vaishnava Society recognised his scholarship with the title ''Bhaktivedanta,'' (''{{IAST|bhakti-vedānta}}'') meaning "one who has realised that devotional service to the Supreme Lord is the end of all knowledge"&lt;ref name="Ssr"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bhaktivedanta|2003|loc=Ending Glossary}}&lt;/ref&gt; (with the words [[Bhakti]], indicating devotion and [[Vedanta]] indicating conclusive knowledge).&lt;ref&gt;A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, [[Satsvarupa dasa Goswami]] (1998) ''The secrets of transcendental love'', {{ISBN|0-89213-273-6}}, p. 73: "The spiritual harmony of knowledge and devotion is well expressed in the phrase ''bhakti-vedānta''"&lt;/ref&gt;

His later well known name, ''{{IAST|Prabhupāda}}'', is a [[Sanskrit]] title, literally meaning "he who has taken the shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord" where'' {{IAST|prabhu}}'' denotes "Lord", and ''{{IAST|pāda}}'' means "taking shelter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Aparna Chattopadhyay |title=Pearls of Spiritual Wisdom |publisher=Pustak Mahal, India |location= |year=2004 |page=37 |isbn=81-223-0858-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, "''at whose feet masters sit''".&lt;ref name="Rodes"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rhodes|2001|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; This name was used as a respectful form of address by his disciples from late 1967 early 1968 onwards. Previous to this, as with his early disciples, followers used to call him "[[Swami|Swamiji]]".&lt;ref name="SDGp"&gt;{{Harvnb|Goswami|2002|loc=Vol.1 Chapter ''Planting the seed''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1950 onwards, he lived at the medieval Radha-Damodar [[mandir]] in the holy town of [[Vrindavan]], where he began his commentary and translation work of the [[Sanskrit]] work [[Bhagavata Purana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Charles S. J.

The [[Gaudiya Matha]] at [[Allahabad]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] was where he lived, wrote and studied, edited the ''{{IAST|Gauḍīya Patrikā}}'' magazine and where he donated the idol ([[murti]]) of [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] which stands on the altar beside those of [[Radha Krishna]] (named ''Śrī Śrī Rādhā Vinodavihārījī''). During his visit in September 1959 he entered the doors of this ''[[Gaudiya Matha|matha]]'' dressed in white, as Abhoy Babu, but would be leaving dressed in saffron, a Vaishnava renunciate (''[[sannyasa|sannyasi]]'').&lt;ref name="SDG9"&gt;{{Harvnb|Goswami|2002|loc=Vol.1 Chapter 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took his renunciate vows from his friend and godbrother [[Bhakti Prajnana Keshava]]. On becoming a sannyasa he also took the prenominal ''[[Swami]]'' (स्वामी Svāmī). He single-handedly published the first three volumes covering seventeen chapters of the first book of ''Bhagavata Purana'', filling three volumes of four hundred pages, each with a detailed commentary. The introduction to the first volume was a biographical sketch of Caitanya Mahāprabhu.&lt;ref name="SDGm" /&gt; He then left India, obtaining free passage on a freighter called the ''Jaladuta'', with the aim and a hope of fulfilling his spiritual master's instruction to spread the message of Caitanya Mahaprabhu around the world. In his possession were a suitcase, an umbrella, a supply of dry cereal, about eight dollars worth of [[Indian rupee|Indian currency]], and several boxes of books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Knott|1997|loc="Bhaktivedanta Swami, by journeying to America, was attempting to fulfill the wish of his guru, possible only by the grace of his dear Lord Krishna."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mission to the West===
{{main article|International Society for Krishna Consciousness}}
[[File:Prabhupadai-handwrite.jpg|left|thumb|274x274px|A message from ''Jaladuta Diary'' Journal kept by Prabhupada. Between 25 August 1965 and 30 August 1965, the ''Jaladuta'' Journal falls silent for six days. On the seventh day, 31 August, the silence is broken with these simple words, "Passed over a great crisis on the struggle for life and death."]]

When he sailed to the United States in 1965, his trip was not sponsored by any religious organization, nor was he met upon arrival by a group of loyal followers.&lt;ref name="char" /&gt; As the Indian freighter ''Jaladuta'' neared his destination, the magnitude of his intended task weighed on him. On 13 September he wrote in his diary, "Today I have disclosed my mind to my companion, Lord Sri [[Krishna]]."&lt;ref name="SDG11"&gt;{{Harvnb|Goswami|2002|loc=Vol 1. Ch 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; On this occasion and on a number of others, he called on Krishna for help in his native [[Bengali language|Bengali]]. Examining these compositions, academics regard them as "intimate records of his prayerful preparation for what lay ahead" and a view on "how Bhaktivedanta Swami understood his own identity and mission."&lt;ref name="Knot22"&gt;{{Harvnb|Knott|1997|loc=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|I do not know why You have brought me here. Now You can do whatever You like with me. But I guess You have some business here, otherwise why would You bring me to this terrible place? How will I make them understand this message of Krishna consciousness? I am very unfortunate, unqualified and most fallen. Therefore I am seeking Your benediction so that I can convince them, for I am powerless to do so on my own.&lt;ref name="SDG11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Knot22" /&gt;}}
By journeying to the United States, he was attempting to fulfil the wish of his guru, possible only by the grace of "his dear Lord Krishna".&lt;ref name="Knot22" /&gt; It was in July 1966 that he brought "global missionary Vaishnavism" to the [[Western world]],&lt;ref name="Srivatsa" /&gt; founding the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] (ISKCON) in [[New York City]]. He spent much of the last decade of his life setting up the institution. Since he was the Society's leader, his personality and management were responsible for much of ISKCON's growth and the reach of his mission.

When it was suggested to him at the time of founding the ISKCON in 1966 that a broader term "God Consciousness" would be preferable to "Krishna Consciousness" in the title, he rejected this recommendation, suggesting that the name ''Krishna'' includes all other forms and concepts of God.&lt;ref name="ex122"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ekstrand|Bryant|2004|pp=120–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a group of devotees and a temple had been established in [[New York City|New York]] another centre was started in [[San Francisco]] in 1967.&lt;ref name="Vasan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cole|Dwayer|2007|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; From there he travelled throughout America with his disciples, popularizing the movement through street chanting (''[[sankirtana]]''), book distribution and public speeches.

[[File:Krishna Balarama12.jpg|thumb|One of 108 worldwide temples he opened by 1977, was dedicated to [[Krishna]]-[[Balarama]] (pictured above) in [[Vrindavana]], India]]

Once ISKCON was more established in there, a small number of devotees from the [[San Francisco]] temple were sent to [[London]], England where they came into contact with [[The Beatles]]. [[George Harrison]] took the greatest interest, spending a significant time speaking with him and producing a record with members of the later London [[Radha Krsna Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cole|Dwayer|2007|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Over the following years his continuing leadership role took him around the world some several times setting up temples and communities on other continents.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite book|title=Hinduism and modernity|publisher=Blackwell Pub|year=2003|isbn=0-631-20862-3|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|page=178|author=Smith, David Nichol}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of his death in Vrindavan in 1977, ISKCON had become an internationally known expression of [[Vaishnavism]].&lt;ref name="Vasan" /&gt;

In the twelve years from his arrival in New York until his final days, he:
* circled the globe fourteen times on lecture tours that took him to six continents&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;
* initiated many disciples, awarding [[sannyasa]] initiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* founded the religious colony [[New Vrindavan]] in [[West Virginia]],&lt;ref name="ShinnBrom1987q"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shinn|Bromley|1987|p=124}} now a tourist attraction. "New Vrindavan in [[West Virginia]], on the other hand, is a close-knit community, has a strong sense of common purpose."&lt;/ref&gt;
* authored more than eighty books (with many available online&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://vedabase.com/en| title=Bhaktivedanta VedaBase Online | publisher=vedabase.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;) on Vedantic philosophy, religion, literature and culture (including four published originally in [[Bengali language|Bengali]])&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;&lt;ref name="translation" /&gt;

* watched ISKCON grow to more than 108 temples, various institutes, and farm communities&lt;ref name="Harvnb|Cole|Dwayer|2007|p=25"/&gt;

Through his mission, he followed and communicated the teachings of [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] and introduced [[bhakti yoga]] to an international audience.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;&lt;ref name="translation" /&gt; Within Gaudiya Vaishnavism this was viewed as the fulfilment of a long time mission to introduce Caitanya Mahaprabhu's teachings to the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cole|Dwayer|2007|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vrindavan.org/English/Books/GM/GMII.html#BranchesGM| title=Branches of the Gaudiya Math |publisher=www.vrindavan.org| accessdate=30 May 2008 |last=Maharaja |first=Sridhar |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704175744/http://www.vrindavan.org/English/Books/GM/GMII.html |archivedate=4 July 2008 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his discussion with historian [[Arnold J.

* According to the most recent issue of ''Back to Godhead'' magazine, founded by Prabhupada, there are presently over 400 temples and farm communities listed to visit. The magazine lists only the major centres, there are many more homes turned temple that hold programs as well that aren't close by regular temples ([[Back to Godhead]]). Prabhupada's initiated disciples and grand disciples number in the tens or hundreds of thousands, while millions of believers who accept his teachings as genuine and bona-fide throughout the world.

==Books and publishing==
It is believed that Bhaktivedanta Swami's most significant contribution are his books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sharma|1981|p=971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.acbspn.com/reviews.htm| title=Scholars reviews of Srila Prabhupada's books| publisher=www.acbspn.com| accessdate=31 May 2008| last=| first=| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515205053/http://www.acbspn.com/reviews.htm| archivedate=15 May 2008| deadurl=yes| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the final twelve years of his life Bhaktivedanta Swami translated over sixty volumes of classic [[Vedic texts|Vedic]] scriptures (such as the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]], [[Chaitanya Charitamrita]]''and the ''[[Srimad Bhagavatam]]'') into the English language.&lt;ref name="Harvnb|Cole|Dwayer|2007|p=25" /&gt; For their authority, depth, and clarity, his books have won praise from professors at colleges and universities like Harvard, Oxford, Cornell, Columbia, Syracuse, Oberlin, and Edinburgh,&lt;ref name="bbt"&gt;

The [[Bhaktivedanta Book Trust]] was established in 1972 to publish his works, and it has also published his multi-volume biography, ''[[#CITEREFGoswami2002|Srila Prabhupada-lilamrta]]'', that according to [[Larry Shinn]] will "certainly be one of the most complete records of the life and work of any modern religious figure".&lt;ref name="Srivatsa"&gt;{{Harvnb|Goswami et al.|1983|p=986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ShinnBrom"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shinn|Bromley|1989|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prabhupada reminded his devotees before his death that he would live forever in his books, and through them would remain present as a spiritual master or [[guru]].&lt;ref name="Knot3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Knott|1997|loc=Prabhupada, Books and Publishing}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Bhaktivedanta Swami had instilled in his followers an understanding of the importance of writing and publishing not only with regard to his works, but also their own initiatives. His early disciples felt Prabhupada had given them ''[[Back To Godhead]]'' for their own writings from the very start.&lt;ref name="Knot3" /&gt;

A prominent [[Gaudiya Vaishnava]] figure, Shrivatsa [[Goswami]], who as a young man had met Bhaktivedanta Swami in 1972, affirmed the significance of book publishing and distribution in spreading the message of Caitanya in an interview with Steven Gelberg:&lt;ref name="Knot3" /&gt;
{{quote|Making these Vaisnava texts available is one of Srila Prabhupada's greatest contributions. Apart from the masses, his books have also reached well into academic circles and have spurred academic interest in the Chaitanya tradition ... The significance of making these texts available is not merely academic or cultural; it is spiritual.&lt;ref name="Gelberg"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cox et al.|1983|p=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Copyright claims===

In 1997, a legal dispute opposing ISKCON Inc. / BBTI (Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International) to the sole trustee of [[Bhaktivedanta Book Trust]] (at this time, [[Hansadutta Swami]]), ISKCON Inc. supported the position that Bhaktivedanta Book Trust was non-existent;&lt;ref name="bbtivhk"&gt;{{cite web

==Views on other religious traditions==
{{Hinduism}}
Bhaktivedanta Swami said:

{{quote|Actually, it doesn't matter&amp;nbsp;– Krishna or Christ&amp;nbsp;– the name is the same. The main point is to follow the injunctions of the Vedic scriptures that recommend chanting the name of God in this age.&lt;ref name="Ssr1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bhaktivedanta|2003|loc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other typical expressions present a different perspective, where he would point out that "today I may be a [[Hindu]], but tomorrow I may become a [[Christian]] or [[Muslim]]. In this way faiths can be changed, but [[dharma]] is a natural sequence, a natural occupation or a connection and it can not be changed, because it is permanent, according to him."&lt;ref name="Harvnb|Cole|Dwayer|2007|p=25"/&gt; While the [[ISKCON]] theology of [[personal god]] is close to Christian theology, both personal and monotheistic, being a preacher of [[bhakti]] and a missionary he sometimes would add, that "already many Christians have tasted the nectar of divine love of the holy name and are dancing with ''[[karatalas]]'' (hand-cymbals) and ''[[mridanga]]s'' (drums)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cole|Dwayer|2007|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His approach to modern knowledge is also seen in sectarian [[Orthodox Judaism]], where the skills and technical knowledge of modernity are encouraged, but the values rejected. Bhaktivedanta Swami stated "devotees should not be lazy, idle...we are not afraid to work. Whatever our engagement is, by offering the result to Krishna we become Krishna conscious".&lt;ref name="char"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iskcon.com/icj/contributors.html#Selengut |title=Charisma and Religious Innovation: Prabhupada and the Founding of ISKCON |publisher=[[ISKCON Communications Journal]] |accessdate=31 May 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516204151/http://www.iskcon.com/icj/4_2/4_2charisma.html#Selengut |archivedate=16 May 2008 |deadurl=yes  }} (self published)&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his representations are believed to affect women adversely and are male-centred, others are tender and celebratory. Bhaktivedanta Swami himself taught a dualism of body and soul and that of the genders. Similar to many traditional religions he considered sexuality and spirituality as conflicting opposites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cole|Dwayer|2007|p=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among some liberal male followers there is a positive recognition of his example in applying the spirit of the law according to time, place, person and circumstance, rather than literal tracing of the tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cole|Dwayer|2007|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Within India==

[[File:ISKCON Tirupathi.jpg|250px|thumb|ISKCON Temple in [[Tirupati (city)|Tirupathi]], India]]

Beginning his public preaching mission in India, he founded the League of Devotees in [[Jhansi]] in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prabhupadaconnect.com/League_of_Devotees.html League of Devotees article] prabhupadaconnect.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the establishment of temples and centres in the United States and Europe, he returned to India in 1971, holding many public programs which were well attended. From 1971 onwards, the movement became increasingly popular and spread throughout India. He was particularly eager to see the progress at "the impressive temple project in" [[Mumbai]] which he and his disciples had fought very hard to establish,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cole|Dwayer|2007|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; with large temples in [[Mayapur]] and [[Vrindavan]] to follow in the mid-1970s. To promote the vedic education system within the modern Indian education structure, he introduced a chain of [[Gurukul]] in various part of India. The [[ISKCON schools#Bhaktivedanta Gurukula and International School|Bhaktivedanta Gurukula and International School]] is one of the most successful schools in the list.

In 1996, the [[Government of India]] recognized his accomplishments by issuing a commemorative stamp in his honour as a part of Prabhupada Centennial celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;

Speaking at the inauguration of ISKCON's cultural centre in New Delhi on 5 April on the occasion of Ramnavmi in 1998, [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]], then India's prime minister, said:

{{quote|If today the Bhagavad Gita is printed in millions of copies in scores of Indian languages and distributed in all nooks and corners of the world, the credit for this great sacred service goes chiefly to ISKCON.&amp;nbsp;...

For this one accomplishment alone, Indians should be eternally grateful to the devoted spiritual army of Swami Prabhupada's followers. The voyage of Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada to the United States in 1965 and the spectacular popularity his movement gained in a very short spell of twelve years must be regarded as one of the greatest spiritual events of the century.|Atal Bihari Vajpayee – April 1998

A number of memorial [[Samādhi#Samadhi as mausoleum|samadhi]]s or shrines to Bhaktivedanta Swami were constructed by the members of ISKCON in his remembrance, the largest of which are in Mayapur, Vrindavan and at the larger sized temples in America. [[Prabhupada's Palace of Gold]] was designed and constructed by devotees of the [[New Vrindavan]] community and dedicated on 2 September 1979. Back in 1972 it was intended to be simply a residence for Bhaktivedanta Swami, but over time the plans evolved into an ornate marble and gold palace which is now visited by thousands of [[Hindu]] pilgrims each year, visiting this centrepiece of the community strongly relying upon tourist trade.&lt;ref name="ShinnBrom1987q" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.palaceofgold.com/| title=Prabhupada's Palace of Gold| publisher=www.palaceofgold.com| accessdate=31 May 2008| last=| first=| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080614223037/http://palaceofgold.com/| archivedate= 14 June 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Gnosticism}}
'''Barbēlō''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: Βαρβηλώ)&lt;ref&gt;Iren., Epiph., Philast., ''Pist. Soph''., Hier.; -ρώ Epiph. as an alternative, 92 A, and similarly the Epitome, p.&amp;nbsp;354 Dind.; -λ, Epit. ''l. c. bis;'' -λώθ [[Theodoret]].&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the first [[emanation]] of [[God]] in several forms of [[Gnostic]] [[cosmogony]].  Barbēlō is often depicted as a supreme female principle, the single passive antecedent of creation in its manifoldness. This figure is also variously referred to as 'Mother-Father' (hinting at her apparent [[androgyny]]), 'First Human Being', 'The Triple Androgynous Name', or 'Eternal [[Aeon (Gnosticism)|Aeon]]'.  So prominent was her place amongst some Gnostics that some schools were designated as ''Barbeliotae'', Barbēlō worshippers or Barbēlōgnostics.

==The nature of Barbēlō==

===Nag Hammadi Library===
In the ''[[Apocryphon of John]]'', a tractate in the [[Nag Hammadi Library]] containing the most extensive recounting of the Sethian creation myth, the Barbēlō is described as "the first power, the glory, Barbēlō, the perfect glory in the aeons, the glory of the revelation". All subsequent acts of creation within the divine sphere (save, crucially, that of the lowest aeon [[Sophia (Gnosticism)|Sophia]]) occurs through her coaction with God. The text describes her thus:

{{quote|This is the first thought, his image; she became the womb of everything, for it is she who is prior to them all, the Mother-Father, the first man ([[Adam Kadmon#Gnosticism|Anthropos]]), the holy Spirit, the thrice-male, the thrice-powerful, the thrice-named androgynous one, and the eternal aeon among the invisible ones, and the first to come forth.}}

Barbēlō is found in other Nag Hammadi writings:
* ''[[Allogenes]]'' makes reference to a Double Powerful Invisible Spirit, a masculine female virgin, who is the Barbēlō.
* ''[[Coptic Gospel of the Egyptians|The Holy Book of the Great Invisible Spirit]]'' refers to a divine emanation called 'Mother', who is also identified as the Barbēlō.
*The ''[[Gospel of Judas]]''—[[Judas Iscariot]] says to [[Jesus]] that he knows that Jesus is from the immortal realm of Barbēlō.
*''[[Marsanes]]''—several places.
*''[[Melchizedek#In Nag Hammadi Library|Melchizedek]]''—twice, the second time in a prayer of Melchizedek: "Holy are you, Holy are you, Holy are you, Mother of the aeons, Barbelo, for ever and ever, Amen."
* ''[[The Three Steles of Seth]]'' offers a description of "the first aeon, male virginal Barbelo, the first glory of the invisible Father, she who is called 'perfect'."
* ''[[Trimorphic Protennoia]]'' ('First Thought in Three Forms'), even in the first person: "He perpetuated the Father of all Aeons, who am I, the Thought of the Father, Protennoia, that is, Barbelo, the perfect Glory, and the immeasurable Invisible One who is hidden. I am the Image of the Invisible Spirit, and it is through me that the All took shape, and (I am) the Mother (as well as) the Light which she appointed as Virgin, she who is called 'Meirothea', the incomprehensible Womb, the unrestrainable and immeasurable Voice."
* ''[[Zostrianos]]''—the aeon Barbēlō is referred to in many places.

===Pistis Sophia===
In the ''[[Pistis Sophia]]'' Barbēlō is named often, but her place is not clearly defined. She is one of the gods, "a great power of the Invisible God" (373), joined with Him and the three "Thrice-powerful deities" (379), the mother of Pistis Sophia (361) and of other beings (49); from her Jesus received His "garment of light" or heavenly body (13, 128; cf. 116, 121); the earth apparently is the "matter of Barbēlō" (128) or the "place of Barbēlō" (373).

===In patristic texts===
She is obscurely described by [[Irenaeus]] as "a never-aging aeon in a virginal spirit", to whom, according to certain "Gnostici", the Innominable Father wished to manifest Himself, and who, when four successive beings, whose names express thought and life, had come forth from Him, was quickened with joy at the sight, and herself gave birth to three (or four) other like beings.

She is noticed in several neighbouring passages of [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]], who in part must be following the Compendium of [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]], as is shown by comparison with [[Philastrius|Philaster]] (c. 33), but also speaks from personal knowledge of the Ophitic sects specially called "Gnostici" (i. 100 f.). The first passage is in the article on the [[Nicolaitans]] (i. 77 f.), but is apparently an anticipatory reference to their alleged descendants the "Gnostici" (77 A; Philast.). According to their view Barbēlō lives "above in the [[seven heavens|eighth heaven]]"; she had been 'put forth' (προβεβλῆσθαι) "of the Father"; she was mother of [[Yaldabaoth]] (some said, of [[Sabaoth]]), who insolently took possession of the seventh heaven, and proclaimed himself to be the only God; and when she heard this word she lamented. She was always appearing to the [[Archon]]s in a beautiful form, that by beguiling them she might gather up her own scattered power.

Others, Epiphanius further seems to say (78 f.), told a similar tale of [[Sophia (Gnosticism)#Prunikos|Prunikos]], substituting Caulacau for Yaldabaoth. In his next article, on the "Gnostici", or [[Borborites]] (83 C D), the idea of the recovery of the scattered powers of Barbēlō recurs as set forth in an apocryphal Book of [[Norea|Noria]], [[Noah]]'s legendary wife.

{{quote|For Noah was obedient to the archon, they say, but Noria revealed the powers on high and Barbelo, the scion of the powers—the opposite of the archon, as the other powers are. And she intimated that what has been taken from the Mother on High by the archon who made the world, and others with him—gods, demons, and angels—must be gathered from the power in the bodies, through the male and female emissions.}}

In both places Epiphanius represents the doctrine as giving rise to sexual libertinism. [[Mircea Eliade]] has compared these Borborite beliefs and practices involving Barbēlō to [[Tantra|Tantric]] [[Tantra#Sexual rites|rituals]] and beliefs, noting that both systems have a common goal of attaining [[Henosis|primordial spiritual unity]] through [[eroticism|erotic]] [[wikt:Bliss|bliss]] and the [[ganachakra|consumption]] of [[menses]] and [[semen]].&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, Mercea. ''Occultism, Witchcraft, and Cultural Fashions: Essays in Comparative Religion'', pp. 109–112. University of Chicago Press, 1978. {{ISBN|0-226-20392-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a third passage (91 f.), enumerating the Archons said to have their seat in each heaven, Epiphanius mentions as the inhabitants of the eighth or highest heaven "her who is called Barbēlō", and the self-gendered Father and Lord of all things, and the virgin-born (αὐτολόχευτον) [[Christ]] (evidently as her son, for according to Irenaeus her first progeny, "the Light", was called Christ); and similarly he tells how the ascent of souls through the different heavens terminated in the upper region, "where Barbēro or Barbēlō is, the Mother of the Living" ({{bibleverse|Genesis||3:20}}).

[[Theodoret]] (''H. F.'' f. 13) merely paraphrases Irenaeus, with a few words from Epiphanius. [[Jerome]] several times includes ''Barbēlō'' in lists of portentous names current in Spanish heresy, that is, among [[Priscillianists]]; ''Balsamus'' and ''Leusibora'' being three times associated with it (''Ep.'' 75 c. 3, p.&amp;nbsp;453 c. Vall.; c. ''Vigil.'' p.&amp;nbsp;393 A; ''in Esai''. lxvi. 4 p.&amp;nbsp;361 c; in ''Amos'' iii. 9 p.&amp;nbsp;257 E).

====Babel====
''Babel'', in the book of "Baruch" of the Gnostic Justinus, the name of the first of the twelve "maternal angels" born to [[Elohim]] and Edem ([[Hippolytus of Rome|Hipp]]. ''[[Philosophumena|Haer]]''. v. 26, p.&amp;nbsp;151). She is identical with [[Aphrodite]], and is enjoined by her mother to cause adulteries and desertions among men, in revenge for Edem's desertion by Elohim (p.&amp;nbsp;154). When [[Heracles]] is sent by Elohim as "a prophet of the uncircumcision" to overcome "the twelve evil angels of the creation," i. e. the maternal angels, Babel, now identical with Omphale, beguiles and enfeebles him (p.&amp;nbsp;156; x. 15, p.&amp;nbsp;323). She may possibly be the Baalti or female [[Baal]] of various Semitic nations, though the intrusive β is not easily explained. But it is on the whole possible to take ''Babel'', "confusion" ([[Josephus|Joseph]]. ''[[Antiquities of the Jews|Ant]]''. i. 4, § 3), as a form of Barbēlō, which may have the same meaning. The eclecticism of Justinus would account for his deposition of Barbēlō from the first to the second place, where she is still above [[Sophia (Gnosticism)#Achamōth|Hachamoth]].

==Significance==
In Gnostic accounts of God, the notions of impenetrability, stasis and ineffability are of central importance. The emanation of Barbēlō may be said to function as an intermediary generative aspect of the Divine, or as an abstraction of the generative aspect of the Divine through its Fullness. The most transcendent hidden invisible Spirit is not depicted as actively participating in creation. This significance is reflected both in her apparent androgyny (reinforced by several of her given epithets), and in the name ''Barbēlō'' itself. Several plausible etymologies of the name (Βαρβηλώ, Βαρβηρώ, Βαρβηλ, Βαρβηλώθ) have been proposed.

*[[William Wigan Harvey]] (on Irenaeus), and [[Richard Adelbert Lipsius]] (''Gnosticismus'', p.&amp;nbsp;115; ''Ophit. Syst''. in Hilgenfeld's ''Zeitschrift'' for 1863, p.&amp;nbsp;445) have proposed ''Barba-Elo'', 'The Deity-in Four', with reference to the [[Tetrad (Greek philosophy)|tetrad]], which by the report of Irenaeus proceeds from her. Her relation to this tetrad bears however no true analogy to the ''[[Colarbasians|Col-Arba]]'' of [[Marcosians|Marcus]]; it forms only the earliest group of her progeny; and it is mentioned but once.
* 'The supreme Limit,' ''paravela'', from the Indian ''vela'', 'limit'—a suggestion made by Julius Grill (''Untersuchungen über die Entstehung des vierten Evangeliums'', Tübingen, 1902, pp.&amp;nbsp;396–397), who connects it with the Valentinian ''Horos'', the Barbēlō being called 'the supreme limit' in relation to the ''Patēr akatonomastos'' on the one side and to the lower syzygies on the other.
* [[Wilhelm Bousset]] (''Hauptprobleme der Gnosis'', Göttingen, 1907, p.&amp;nbsp;14 f.) suggests that the word is a mutilation of ''[[wikt:παρθένος|parthenos]]''—the intermediate form, ''Barthenōs'', actually occurring in Epiphanius (''Haer''. xxvi. 1) as the name of Noah's wife.
*[[Fenton John Anthony Hort]] (''[[Dictionary of Christian Biography|DCB]]'' i. 235, 249) states that the "root ''balbel'' much used in the [[Targum]]s (Buxtorf, ''Lex, Rabb.'' 309), in biblical Hebrew ''balal'', signifying mixture or confusion, suggests a better derivation for ''Barbelo,'' as denoting the chaotic germ of various and discrete existence: the change from ל to ר is common enough, and may be seen in the alternative form Βαρβηρώ. If the {{sm|Babel}} of Justinus (Hipp. ''Haer''. v. 26; x. 15) is identical with Barbelo, as is at least possible, this derivation becomes still more probable."
* It may be an ''ad hoc'' [[Coptic language|Coptic]] construction signifying both 'Great Emission' (according to [[Bentley Layton]]'s ''The Gnostic Scriptures'') and 'Seed' according to [[F.C. Burkitt]] (in ''Church and Gnosis'').

The '''Boyd Group''' is a Britain-based, independent [[think tank]] considering issues relating to [[animal testing]].

== Background ==
The group was founded in 1992, the idea forming from a dialogue between [[Colin Blakemore]], a strong advocate of animal testing and subsequently chief executive of the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]], and Les Ward, then director of the anti-[[vivisection]] group, [[Advocates for Animals]]. The group is named after its chairman, Kenneth Boyd, a professor of [[medical ethics]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name=Boyd&gt;Kenneth Boyd [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=46381 Bringing both sides together.] ''Camb Q Healthc Ethics''. 1999; 8:43-5. {{PMID|9924617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objectives and approach ==
The groups states its primary objective is to act as a "forum for open exchange of views" on "issues of concern" to its membership and, whenever possible, form [[consensus]] and make recommendations.&lt;ref name=About&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.boyd-group.demon.co.uk/about_us.pdf |title= About the Boyd Group. |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070714153958/http://www.boyd-group.demon.co.uk/about_us.pdf |archivedate= July 14, 2007 |df=  }} &amp;nbsp;{{small|(187&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}} Retrieved December 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the diverse membership, the group will often fail to find consensus. In these situations, they aim to publish "an agreed account of where members (as people familiar with the issues) differ from one another, regarding what they consider to be the relevant facts, the best interpretation of these facts and relevant moral arguments".&lt;ref name=About/&gt; Issues for debate are raised by members, then discussed by the group (or a sub-group). Occasionally, the group may communicate with other bodies, such as [[Pro-Test]].&lt;ref name=Protest&gt;[http://pro-test.org.uk/2006/07/recent-debates.html Pro-Test at the Boyd Group]. Retrieved December 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Patrick Bateson]] has said of the group: {{quote|I was involved [with the Boyd Group] when Kenneth Boyd was doing his early report with Jane Smith for the Institute of Medical Ethics. We were a disparate group of people ranging from some [[gung-ho]] scientists on the one hand to some hard-line animal rights people on the other hand. We worked together for three years and eventually we were all talking to each other. It can be done. Even the groups which seem so implacably opposed can end up understanding that there might be agreed positions, because the moral issues are numerous and we have to try to bring these very different forms of morality together.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld200102/ldselect/ldanimal/999/2012906.htm Patrick Bateson's evidence] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605020742/http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld200102/ldselect/ldanimal/999/2012906.htm |date=June 5, 2011 }} to the House of Lords Select Committee on Animal Testing, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Boyd Group has been criticized by some anti-vivisection organisations. Representatives of the [[National Anti-Vivisection Society]] (NAVS) told a [[House of Lords]] [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|select committee]] the Boyd Group is a "[[talking shop]]" with a "pre-set agenda." &lt;ref name=Creamer&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldselect/ldanimal/999/2031204.htm Minutes of Evidence, Question 1362].

Retrieved December 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Les Ward defended Advocates for Animals' membership of the group and the effectiveness of a collaborative approach: {{quote|Before [[Animal testing#Cosmetics testing|cosmetic testing]] was abolished by the government, or a ban introduced, the Boyd Group called for it to be banned. That was great, here was the animal welfare and the scientific community going together to the [[Home Office]] with a powerful voice and putting the case forward." &lt;ref name=Ward&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldselect/ldanimal/999/2031206.htm Minutes of Evidence, Question 1384]. ''Select Committee on Animals In Scientific Procedures'', March 12, 2002. Retrieved December 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Membership ==
The group had, according to Blakemore in 2002, "about 25 member organisations" &lt;ref name=Blakemore&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldselect/ldanimal/999/2012203.htm Minutes of Evidence, Question 964].

Retrieved December 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  including [[animal welfare]] groups, anti-vivisectionist groups, charitable bodies, government, industry, veterinarians, academic scientists and philosophers. The membership includes both expert individuals and those nominated by, and representative of, groups or societies. The group invites applications for membership, but excluding only individuals and groups that "support violent activity or break the criminal law".&lt;ref name=About/&gt; Identified members, past and present, include:

The Boyd Group lacks representation from a number of large anti-vivisectionist organisations, with Blakemore admitting their "credibility is reduced because of that".&lt;ref name=Blakemore/&gt; Both Ward and Blakemore have expressed a wish to include more of these organisations, including [[BUAV]], [[NAVS]], [[PETA]] and [[Animal Aid]].&lt;ref name=Ward/&gt;&lt;ref name=Blakemore2/&gt;

In [[international relations]], '''constructivism''' is the claim that significant aspects of international relations are historically and socially constructed, rather than inevitable consequences of human nature or other essential characteristics of world politics.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Thaddeus Jackson and Daniel H. Nexon, "Whence Causal Mechanisms? A Comment on Legro" in ''Dialogue IO'' Vol. 1, 2002 [http://journals.cambridge.org/production/action/cjoGetFulltext?fulltextid=149074]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
[[Nicholas Onuf]] is usually credited with coining the term "constructivism" to describe theories that stress the [[Social constructionism|socially constructed]] character of international relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Contemporary constructivist theory traces its roots to pioneering work not only by Onuf, but also by [[Richard K. Ashley]], [[Friedrich Kratochwil]], [[John Ruggie]], and [[Christian Reus-Smit]]. Nevertheless, [[Alexander Wendt]] is the best-known advocate of [[social constructivism]] in the field of [[international relations]]. Wendt’s 1992 article "[[Anarchy (international relations)|Anarchy]] is What States Make of It: the Social Construction of Power Politics" published in ''[[International Organization]]'' laid the theoretical groundwork for challenging what he considered to be a flaw shared by both neorealists and neoliberal institutionalists, namely, a commitment to a (crude) form of materialism.  By attempting to show that even such a core realist concept as "[[power politics]]" is socially constructed—that is, not given by nature and hence, capable of being transformed by human practice—Wendt opened the way for a generation of international relations scholars to pursue work in a wide range of issues from a constructivist perspective. Wendt further developed these ideas in his central work, ''[[Social Theory of International Politics]]'' (1999).{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Since the late 1980s and early 1990s, constructivism has become one of the major schools of thought within international relations. [[John Ruggie]]&lt;ref name="zero2"&gt;{{cite journal|title=What Makes the World Hang Together? Neo-utilitarianism and the Social Constructivist Challenge |publisher=CUP |author=John Gerard Ruggie |journal=International Organization|volume=52|issue=4|year=1998|pages=855|doi=10.1162/002081898550770}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Christian Reus-Smit]]&lt;ref&gt;"http://www.palgrave.com/page/detail/theories-of-international-relations-scott-burchill/?isb=978023036222"&lt;/ref&gt; have identified several strands of constructivism. On the one hand, there are constructivist scholars such as [[Martha Finnemore]], [[Kathryn Sikkink]], [[Peter Katzenstein]], Elizabeth Kier, and Alexander Wendt, whose work has been widely accepted within the mainstream IR community and has generated vibrant scholarly discussions among [[Realism (international relations)|realists]], [[Liberalism (international relations)|liberals]], [[Institutionalism (international relations)|institutionalists]], and constructivists. On the other hand, there are radical constructivists who take discourse and linguistics more seriously.

==Theory==
Constructivism primarily seeks to demonstrate how core aspects of international relations are, contrary to the assumptions of [[Neorealism (international relations)|neorealism]] and [[Neoliberalism (international relations)|neoliberalism]], ''socially constructed'', that is, they are given their form by ongoing processes of social practice and interaction. [[Alexander Wendt]] calls two increasingly accepted basic tenets of Constructivism "that the structures of human association are determined primarily by shared ideas rather than material forces, and that the identities and interests of purposive actors are constructed by these shared ideas rather than given by nature".&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Wendt, ''Social Theory of International Politics'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999), p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion that international relations are not only affected by power politics, but also by ideas, is shared by writers who describe themselves as ''constructivist theorists.'' According to this view, the fundamental structures of international politics are social rather than strictly material. This leads to ''social constructivists'' to argue that changes in the nature of social interaction between states can bring a fundamental shift towards greater international security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Globalization of World Politics|last=Baylis|first=John|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc.|year=2011|isbn=978-0-19-956909-0|location=|pages=237|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Challenging realism===
During constructivism's formative period [[Neorealism (international relations)|neorealism]] was the dominant discourse of international relations, thus much of constructivism's initial theoretical work challenged basic Neorealist assumptions. Neorealists are fundamentally causal [[Structuralism|structuralists]], in that they hold that the majority of important content to international politics is explained by the structure of the international system, a position first advanced in [[Kenneth Waltz]]'s ''[[Man, the State, and War]]'' and fully elucidated in his core text of Neorealism, ''Theory of International Politics''. Specifically, international politics is primarily determined by the fact that the international system is [[Anarchy (international relations)|anarchic]] – it lacks any overarching authority, instead it is composed of units ([[Sovereign state|states]]) which are formally equal – they are all sovereign over their own territory. Such anarchy, Neorealists argue, forces States to act in certain ways, specifically, they can rely on no-one but themselves for security (they have to self-help). The way in which anarchy forces them to act in such ways, to defend their own self-interest in terms of power, neorealists argue, explains most of international politics. Because of this, Neorealists tend to disregard explanations of international politics at the "unit" or "state" level.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Wendt, ''Social Theory of International Politics'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999), pp.8-15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chris Brown, ''Understanding International Relations'' (Basingstoke: Palgrave Publishing, 2005), pp.40-43&lt;/ref&gt; Kenneth Waltz attacked such a focus as being [[Reductionism|reductionist]].&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Waltz, ''Theory of International Politics'' (McGraw-Hill Higher Education, 1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

Constructivism, particularly in the formative work of Wendt, challenges this assumption by showing that the causal powers attributed to "structure" by neorealists are in fact not "given", but rest on the way in which structure is constructed by social practice. Removed from presumptions about the nature of the identities and interests of the actors in the system, and the meaning that social institutions (including anarchy) have for such actors, Wendt argues neorealism's "structure" reveals very little: "it does not predict whether two states will be friends or foes, will recognize each other's sovereignty, will have dynastic ties, will be revisionist or status quo powers, and so on".&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Wendt, "Anarchy is What States Make of It: the Social Construction of Power Politics" in ''International Organization'' (46:2, Spring 1992), p. 396.&lt;/ref&gt; Because such features of behavior are not explained by anarchy, and require instead the incorporation of evidence about the interests and identities held by key actors, Neorealism's focus on the material structure of the system (anarchy) is misplaced.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Wendt, "Anarchy is What States Make of It: the Social Construction of Power Politics" in ''International Organization'' (46:2, Spring 1992), pp. 396–399.&lt;/ref&gt; Wendt goes further than this – arguing that because the way in which anarchy constrains states depends on the way in which states conceive of anarchy, and conceive of their own identities and interests, anarchy is not necessarily even a self-help system. It only forces states to self-help if they conform to neorealist assumptions about states as seeing security as a competitive, relative concept, where the gain of security for any one state means the loss of security for another. If states instead hold alternative conceptions of security, either "co-operative", where states can maximise their security without negatively affecting the security of another, or "collective" where states identify the security of other states as being valuable to themselves, anarchy will not lead to self-help at all.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Wendt, "Anarchy is What States Make of It: the Social Construction of Power Politics" in ''International Organization'' (46:2, Spring 1992), pp. 399–403.&lt;/ref&gt; Neorealist conclusions, as such, depend entirely on unspoken and unquestioned assumptions about the way in which the meaning of social institutions are constructed by actors. Crucially, because Neorealists fail to recognize this dependence, they falsely assume that such meanings are unchangeable, and exclude the study of the processes of social construction which actually do the key explanatory work behind neorealist observations.

===Identities and interests===
As constructivists reject neorealism's conclusions about the determining effect of anarchy on the behavior of international actors, and move away from neorealism's underlying materialism, they create the necessary room for the identities and interests of international actors to take a central place in theorising international relations. Now that actors are not simply governed by the imperatives of a self-help system, their identities and interests become important in analysing how they behave. Like the nature of the international system, constructivists see such identities and interests as not objectively grounded in material forces (such as dictates of the human nature that underpins [[Realism (international relations)|classical realism]]) but the result of ideas and the social construction of such ideas. In other words, the meanings of ideas, objects, and actors are all given by [[social interaction]]. People give objects their meanings and can attach different meanings to different things.

[[Martha Finnemore]] has been influential in examining the way in which international organizations are involved in these processes of the social construction of actor's perceptions of their interests.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Walt writes on the back cover of Finnemore's book "Many writers have asserted that social structures assert a powerful impact on national preferences...but Finnemore is the first to present sophisticated evidence for this claim."&lt;/ref&gt; In ''National Interests In International Society'', Finnemore attempts to "develop a systemic approach to understanding state interests and state behavior by investigating an international structure, not of power, but of meaning and social value".&lt;ref name="Martha Finnemore 1996 p.2"&gt;Martha Finnemore, ''National Interests In International Society'' (New York: [[Cornell University Press]], 1996), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; "Interests", she explains, "are not just 'out there' waiting to be discovered; they are constructed through social interaction".&lt;ref name="Martha Finnemore 1996 p.2"/&gt; Finnemore provides three case studies of such construction – the creation of Science Bureaucracies in states due to the influence of the [[UNESCO]], the role of the [[Red Cross]] in the [[Geneva Conventions]] and the [[World Bank]]'s influence of attitudes to [[poverty]].

Studies of such processes are examples of the constructivist attitude towards state interests and identities. Such interests and identities are central determinants of state behaviour, as such studying their nature and their formation is integral in constructivist methodology to explaining the international system. But it is important to note that despite this refocus onto identities and interests—properties of states—constructivists are not necessarily wedded to focusing their analysis at the unit-level of international politics: the state. Constructivists such as Finnemore and Wendt both emphasise that while ideas and processes tend to explain the social construction of identities and interests, such ideas and processes form a structure of their own which impact upon international actors. Their central difference from neorealists is to see the structure of international politics in primarily ideational, rather than material, terms.&lt;ref&gt;Martha Finnemore, ''National Interests In International Society'' (New York: Cornell University Press, 1996), pp. 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Wendt, ''Social Theory of International Politics'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999), pp. 29-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research areas===
Many constructivists analyse [[international relations]] by looking at goals, threats, fears, cultures, identities, and other elements of "social reality" as [[social fact]]s.  In an important edited volume, ''The Culture of National Security'',&lt;ref&gt;''The Culture of National Security'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; constructivist scholars—including Elizabeth Kier, Jeffrey Legro, and [[Peter Katzenstein]] - challenged many realist assumptions about the dynamics of international politics, particularly in the context of military affairs. [[Thomas J. Biersteker]] and [[Cynthia Weber]]&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J. Biersteker and Cynthia Weber, eds., ''State Sovereignty As Social Construct'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; applied constructivist approaches to understand the evolution of state sovereignty as a central theme in international relations, and works by [[Rodney Bruce Hall]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Rodney Bruce Hall]], ''National Collective Identity'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; and Daniel Philpott&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Philpott, ''Revolutions in Sovereignty: How Ideas Shaped Modern International Relations'' (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; (among others) developed constructivist theories of major transformations in the dynamics of international politics. In [[international political economy]], the application of constructivism has been less frequent. Notable examples of constructivist work in this area include Kathleen R. McNamara's study of European Monetary Union&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen R. McNamara, ''The Currency of Ideas: Monetary Politics in the European Union'' (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; and Mark Blyth's analysis of the rise of [[Reaganomics]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Blyth ''Great Transformations: Economic Ideas and Institutional Change in the Twentieth Century'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

By focusing on how language and rhetoric are used to construct the social reality of the international system, constructivists are often seen as more optimistic about progress in international relations than versions of [[Realism (international relations)|realism]] loyal to a purely materialist ontology, but a growing number of constructivists question the "liberal" character of constructivist thought and express greater sympathy for realist pessimism concerning the possibility of emancipation from power politics.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Thaddeus Jackson, ed. "Bridging the Gap: Towards a Realist-Constructivist Dialogue" in ''International Studies Review'' vol. 6, 2004, pp. 337-352&lt;/ref&gt;

Constructivism is often presented as an alternative to the two leading theories of international relations, [[Realism (international relations)|realism]] and [[Liberalism (international relations)|liberalism]], but some maintain that it is not necessarily inconsistent with one or both.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Moravscik, Taking Preferences Seriously: A Liberal Theory of International Politics" in ''International Organization'' vol. 51, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;  Wendt shares some key assumptions with leading realist and [[Neorealism (international relations)|neorealist]] scholars, such as the existence of anarchy and the centrality of states in the international system.  However, Wendt renders anarchy in cultural rather than materialist terms; he also offers a sophisticated theoretical defense of the state-as-actor assumption in international relations theory.  This is a contentious issue within segments of the IR community as some constructivists challenge Wendt on some of these assumptions (see, for example, exchanges in ''[[Review of International Studies]]'', vol. 30, 2004).  It has been argued that progress in IR theory will be achieved when Realism and Constructivism can be aligned or even synthesized.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelia Beyer, "Hegemony, Equilibrium and Counterpower: A Synthetic Approach", in International Relations vol 23:3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Sterling-Folker, Realism and the Constructivist Challenge: Rejecting, Reconstructing, or Rereading, ''International Studies Review'', 4(1), pg. 73–97, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; An early example of such synthesis was [[Jennifer Sterling-Folker’s]] analysis of the United States’ international monetary policy following the [[Bretton Woods system]]. Sterling-Folker argued that the U.S. shift towards unilateralism is partially accounted for by realism’s emphasis of an anarchic system, but constructivism helps to account for important factors from the domestic or second [[level of analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Sterling-Folker, ''Theories of International Cooperation and the Primacy of Anarchy: Explaining  U.S. International Monetary Policy-Making after Bretton Wood'', State University of New York Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent developments===
A significant group of scholars who study processes of social construction self-consciously eschew the label "Constructivist". They argue that "mainstream" constructivism has abandoned many of the most important insights from [[linguistic turn]] and social-constructionist theory in the pursuit of respectability as a "scientific" approach to international relations.&lt;ref&gt;Maja Zehfuss, ''Constructivism in International Relations: The Politics of Reality'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Even some putatively "mainstream" constructivists, such as [[Jeffrey Checkel]], have expressed concern that constructivists have gone too far in their efforts to build bridges with non-constructivist schools of thought.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Checkel, “Social Constructivisms in Global and European Politics” in ''Review of International Studies'' Vol.30, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

A growing number of constructivists contend that current theories pay inadequate attention to the role of [[Habit (psychology)|habitual]] and unreflective behavior in world politics.&lt;ref&gt;Iver B. Neumann, "Returning Practice to the Linguistic Turn: The Case of Diplomacy" in ''Millennium: Journal of International Studies'' vol. 31, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; These advocates of the "practice turn" take inspiration from work in [[neuroscience]], as well as that of social theorists such as [[Pierre Bourdieu]], that stresses the significance of habit and practices in psychological and social life - essentially calling for greater attention and sensitivity towards the 'every day' and 'taken for granted' activities of international politics &lt;ref&gt;Ted Hopf, ''Social Construction of International Politics: Identities &amp; Foreign Policies, Moscow, 1955 and 1999'' (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Pouliot, "The Logic of Practicality: A Theory of Practice of Security Communities" in ''International Organization'' vol. 62, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Increasingly, these scholars are also moving towards employing the related sociological approach known as [[Actor-Network Theory]] (ANT), which extends the early focus of the Practice Turn on the work of [[Pierre Bourdieu]] towards that of [[Bruno Latour]] and others. Scholars have employed ANT in order to disrupt traditional world political binaries (civilised/barbarian, democratic/autocratic, etc.),&lt;ref&gt;Austin, Jonathan Luke., 2015. [http://ejt.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/11/26/1354066115616466.abstract "We have never been civilized: Torture and the Materiality of World Political Binaries."] ''European Journal of International Relations'', [[doi:10.1177/1354066115616466]]&lt;/ref&gt; consider the implications of a posthuman understanding of IR,&lt;ref&gt;Cudworth, E. and Hobden, S, 2013. “Of parts and wholes: International Relations beyond the human.” ''Millennium: Journal of International Studies', 41(3), pp.430-450.&lt;/ref&gt; explore the infrastructures of world politics,&lt;ref&gt;Barry, A., 2013. “Material Politics.” Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; and consider the effects of technological agency.&lt;ref&gt;Leander, A., 2013. “Technological agency in the co-constitution of legal expertise and the US drone program.” ''Leiden Journal of International Law', 26(4), pp.811-831.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dekalog''''' ({{IPA-pl|dɛˈkalɔg|pron}}, also known as '''''Dekalog: The Ten Commandments''''' and '''''The Decalogue''''') is a 1989 [[Poles|Polish]] [[television]] [[Drama film|drama series]] directed by [[Krzysztof Kieślowski]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.facets.org/decalogue/biography.html Biography of Krysztof Kieślowski] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724173154/http://www.facets.org/decalogue/biography.html |date=24 July 2010 }}, www.facets.org, n.d., retrieved 6 June2017&lt;/ref&gt; and co-written by Kieślowski with [[Krzysztof Piesiewicz]], with music by [[Zbigniew Preisner]].&lt;ref name=off&gt;JOSHUA TANZER[http://www.offoffoff.com/film/2001/decalogue.php A Perfect 10. Series overview] Offoff.com, THE GUIDE TO ALTERNATIVE NEW YORK, JANUARY 20, 2001, retrieved 6 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of ten one-hour films, inspired by the decalogue of the [[Ten Commandments]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://catholic-resources.org/Bible/Decalogue.htm Ten Commandments] catholic-resources.org, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt; Each short film explores characters facing one or several moral or [[ethical dilemma]]s as they live in an austere [[housing project]] in 1980s Poland.

The series, which is Kieślowski's most acclaimed work,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theyshootpictures.com/kieslowskikrzysztof.php |title=Krzysztof Kieślowski's Acclaimed Films |publisher=They Shoot Pictures, Don't They |accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was said in 2002 to be "the best dramatic work ever done specifically for television"&lt;ref name=rf&gt;Fulford, Robert [http://www.robertfulford.com/Decalogue.html Kieslowski's magnificent Decalogue] The National Post, 14 May 2002, retrieved 6 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and has won numerous international awards, though it was not widely released outside Europe until the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.facets.org/decalogue/reviews.html Critical response on www.facets.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724165722/http://www.facets.org/decalogue/reviews.html |date=24 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, filmmaker [[Stanley Kubrick]] wrote an admiring foreword to the published screenplay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0078.html Stanley Kubrick review of the film on www.visual-memory.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
The series was conceived when screenwriter [[Krzysztof Piesiewicz]], who had seen a 15th-century artwork illustrating the Commandments in scenes from that time period, suggested the idea of a modern equivalent. Filmmaker [[Krzysztof Kieślowski]] was interested in the philosophical challenge, and also wanted to use the series as a portrait of the hardships of Polish society, while deliberately avoiding the political issues he had depicted in earlier films. He originally meant to hire ten different directors, but decided to direct the films himself. He used a different [[cinematographer]] for each episode except III and IX, in both of which [[Piotr Sobociński]] was director of photography.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.facets.org/decalogue/cinematographers.html Behind the Camera: Poland’s Best Cinematographers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725120727/http://www.facets.org/decalogue/cinematographers.html |date=25 July 2010 }} www.facets.org, n.d., retrieved 6 June2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The large cast includes both famous and unknown actors, many of whom Kieślowski also used in his other films. Typically for Kieślowski, the tone of most of the films is melancholic, except for the final one, which is a [[black comedy]], featuring two of the same actors, [[Jerzy Stuhr]] and [[Zbigniew Zamachowski]], as in [[Three Colors: White]].{{cn|date=June 2017}}

==Themes==
The ten films are titled simply by number, e.g. ''Dekalog: One''. According to film critic [[Roger Ebert|Roger Ebert's]] introduction to the DVD set, Kieślowski said that the films did not correspond exactly to the commandments, and never used their names himself.&lt;ref name=robeb&gt; Robert Ebert [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20000402/REVIEWS08/4020301/1023 The Decalogue movie and film review], rogerebert.suntimes.com, 2 April 2000, retrieved 6 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; 
Though each film is independent, most of them share the same setting in Warsaw, and some of the characters are acquainted with each other.  Each short film explores characters facing one or several moral or [[ethical dilemma]]s as they live in a large [[housing project]] in 1980s Poland.&lt;ref name=off/&gt;
The themes can be interpreted in many different ways; however, each film has its own literality:&lt;ref name=kickasola164&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kickasola|first=Joseph G. |title=The Films of Krzysztof Kieślowski:The Liminal Image |year=2006 |publisher=Continuum (Bloomsbury Publishing) |isbn=978-0-826-41559-2 |page=164 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=OO62cTdxi6sC |accessdate=30 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kieślowski expanded ''Five'' and ''Six'' into longer feature films (''[[A Short Film About Killing]]'' and ''[[A Short Film About Love]]''), using the same cast and changing the stories slightly. 
This was part of a contractual obligation with the producers, since feature films were easier to distribute outside Poland.{{cn|date=June 2017}} In 2000, the series was released on five DVDs, each containing two parts of about 2 hours.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

[[Derge]] is a county seat in a high valley in [[Kham]], an eastern district of traditional Tibet which is now part of China's [[Sichuan]] Province. The Derge Parkhang is a living institution devoted to the printing and preservation of Tibetan literature, a printing temple that holds the greatest number of Tibetan [[Woodblock printing|woodblocks]] in the world. 
	
The Derge Sutra Printing Temple (Parkhang in Tibetan) is one of the most important cultural, social, religious and historical institutions in Tibet. Founded in 1729 by Demba Tsering, the fortieth King of Derge (1678–1739) with the spiritual and literature assistance of the [[8th Tai Situ Panchen Chokyi Jungne]], the Derge Parkhang is an active center for publication of Tibetan Buddhist [[sutra]], commentaries, and [[thangka]] as well as works of history, technology, biography, medicine and literature. Books are still being made in the same way as they have been for almost three hundred years: handprinted from hand-carved wooden blocks. Cinnabar is used to colour the text red,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The handbook of Tibetan Buddhist symbols |last=Beer |first=R. |year=2003 |publisher=Serindia Publications |isbn=1-932476-03-2  |pages=16, 19, 24 and 134 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-3804Ud9-4IC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=tibetan+printing+cinnabar&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FPGAZTHgMB&amp;sig=IsCFc2hBROTTIQygtph9Tjq7bFo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=uxY3S_SeEs-gkQWaivn_Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=cinnabar&amp;f=false |accessdate=27 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which workers can print eight to fifteen pages manually a minute,&lt;ref name=storehouse/&gt; 2500 in a day,&lt;ref name=Bakong/&gt; from wooden blocks that have already been engraved with text.&lt;ref name=archive&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/download/tibetanlifeandcu000119mbp/tibetanlifeandcu000119mbp.pdf |title=Tibetan Life and Culture |author=Olsen, E. |year=1960 |page=21 |accessdate=27 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty printers are in working condition where printers work in pairs, one puts ink on wooden press, later cleaned in a trough, while the other rolls a piece of paper using a roller which is imprinted red with sayings of [[Buddha]].&lt;ref name=storehouse/&gt;&lt;ref name=archive/&gt;

== History ==
The history of the Derge Parkhang is closely bound to the history of the [[Kingdom of Derge]]. From a mythical ancestor in the eighth century, the Derge royal dynasty rose to found and rule an influential independent Tibetan kingdom in the [[Kham]] area of Eastern Tibet, controlling a large area straddling the Drichu River (called the Jinsha River in Chinese and forming the upper reaches of the Yangtse River) on what is now the border between the Tibetan Autonomous Region and Sichuan. Astute politicians, the Kings of Derge maintained political power through generous patronage of religious institutions: their unusual pattern of patronage for all [[Tibetan Buddhism|five schools of Buddhism]] meant strong support for monasteries, learning and art in the area under their political control. They were also able stay on good terms with both of their powerful neighbors, the governments of Lhasa and Beijing. A gradual weakening of the family through the nineteenth century followed by a succession struggle in the early twentieth century brought about the effective end of their political control, but they remained in nominal power until the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese Communists in 1950.

The survival of the Derge Parkhang during the "Three Crises", its close escape from destruction during the campaigns of Gonpo Namgyal in the mid-nineteenth century, survival through the succession struggles in the early twentieth century, and finally its preservation through the period of religious and cultural suppression under the Communist Party of China are credited to sources both natural and supernatural. The Parkhang returned to production in the early 1980s after a hiatus of almost twenty-five years, and today produces and distributes sutra and other books throughout Tibet, China and internationally (including the collection of the New York Public Library) as well as printed thangkas and [[mandala]] to local people, pilgrims and, increasingly, to tourists. As the present Director, Tsewang Jirme Rinpoche says, "This is not a museum of antiques, it is a living institution." The temple has been recognized by the People's Republic of China since the fifties as a national site for historical preservation and is working for recognition as a World Heritage Site. Derge has attracted western notice (e.g. New York Times, March 19, 2000: "Storehouse of Tibetan Culture,") and welcomes tourists, but because of its remote location, four days by bus from [[Chengdu]] only the most committed travelers visit it.

The Derge Parkhang today faces a set of challenges that arise from the social, economic and political developments that arise from Kham's opening to development and tourism in the late nineties. Current leadership at the Parkhang has worked to clarify the institution's bureaucratic status, open new sources of funding and support, and to gain control of its media representation. All of these programs demand money, and both governmental support and donations steered by the government have been developed. Nevertheless, the institution remains in competition with hundreds of other cultural preservation projects in China and with numerous other religious institutions in Kham and Tibet. The leadership at the Parkhang needs to find a way to transform immense cultural capital into the means to support the institution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1611">'''Dialectica spaces''' are a [[category theory|categorical]] way of constructing  models of [[linear logic]].

They were introduced by [[Valeria de Paiva]], [[Martin Hyland]]'s student, in her doctoral thesis, as a way of modeling both linear logic and [[Gödel]]'s [[dialectica interpretation]]&amp;mdash;hence the name.

Given a [[category (category theory)|category]] ''C'' and a specific object ''K'' of ''C'' with certain (logical) properties, one can construct the category of Dialectica spaces over ''C'', whose objects are  pairs of objects of ''C'',  related by a ''C''-[[morphism]] into the given object. Morphisms of Dialectica spaces are similar to [[Chu space]] morphisms, but instead of an equality condition, they have an inequality condition, which is read as a [[logical consequence|logical implication]], the first object implies the second.

'''''Eureka: An Exposition of the Apocalypse''''' (commonly called ''Eureka'') is a book written by [[John Thomas (Christadelphian)|John Thomas]] in 1861. Each chapter has been written expounding the correspond chapter of last book of the bible ([[Book of Revelation|Revelation]], or Apocalypse in the [[Greek language|Greek]]). Originally written in three volume set, later editors published the work in 5 volumes. In earlier editions ''Eureka'' included the ''Exposition of Daniel'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thechristadelphian.com/books/readonline/daniel/default.html |title=''Exposition of Daniel'' |accessdate=2011-04-28 |last=Thomas |first=John |authorlink=John Thomas (Christadelphian)|year=1868 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was later generally published as a separate work.

{{Quotation|Most people claim that The Apocalypse is too deep and enigmatical to be understood. But its style constitutes a challenge to faith. In delivering it to John for the benefit of "his servants", the Lord treated them as "his friends". He declared: "Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth; but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you" (John 15:15). The Apocalypse needs to be treated in that fashion. If we value the friendship of Christ we will not be deterred by its problems, but will prayerfully and conscientiously seek to understand it. "Blessed is he that readeth," declared Christ. Christ does not mock us by inviting us to engage in a vain study. The Apocalypse is not sealed:" Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book" (Rev. 22:10). That this book is understandable, the volumes of Eureka are a witness. With them before him, let no reader foster the idea that The Apocalypse is a book beyond comprehension. Under God, through the labours of its author, the basic principles of the Truth have been clearly set forth: and similarly, in Eureka, the deeper revelation of the divine purpose has been expounded. And in a manner that the simplest mind can grasp with a prayerful effort. Let the reader gratefully accept the providential help of Eureka. By its means he can read himself rich unto life eternal.|Foreword|Eureka Volume 1}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10385">[[Image:R. A. Fischer.jpg|thumb|200px|Ronald Fisher]]

'''Fisher's principle''' is an [[evolution]]ary model that explains why the [[sex ratio]] of most [[species]] that produce [[offspring]] through [[sexual reproduction]] is approximately 1:1 between [[male]]s and [[female]]s. [[A. W. F. Edwards]] has remarked that it is "probably the most celebrated argument in [[evolutionary biology]]".&lt;ref name=Edwards98&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1086/286141 | last1 = Edwards | first1 = A.W.F. | year = 1998 | title = Natural Selection and the Sex Ratio: Fisher's Sources | url = | journal = American Naturalist | volume = 151 | issue = 6| pages = 564–569 | pmid = 18811377 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fisher's principle was famously outlined by [[Ronald Fisher]] in his 1930 book ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]''&lt;ref name=Fisher30/&gt; (but has been incorrectly attributed to Fisher as original&lt;ref name=Edwards98/&gt;). Specifically, Fisher couched his argument in terms of [[parental expenditure]], and predicted that parental expenditure on both sexes should be equal.  Sex ratios that are 1:1 are hence known as "Fisherian", and those that are not 1:1 are "non-Fisherian" or "extraordinary" and occur because they break the assumptions made in Fisher's model.&lt;ref name=Hamilton67/&gt;

==Basic explanation==
[[W.D. Hamilton]] gave the following basic explanation in his 1967 paper on "Extraordinary sex ratios",&lt;ref name=Hamilton67&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.156.3774.477 | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = W.D. | year = 1967 | title = Extraordinary sex ratios | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/refs/156/3774/477 | journal = Science | volume = 156 | issue = 3774| pages = 477–488 | pmid = 6021675 |bibcode = 1967Sci...156..477H }}&lt;/ref&gt; given the condition that males and females cost equal amounts to produce:&lt;!-- this is a better explanation than Fisher's contorted text--&gt;

{{block indent|
# Suppose male births are less common than female.
# A newborn male then has better mating prospects than a newborn female, and therefore can expect to have more offspring.
# Therefore parents genetically disposed to produce males tend to have more than average numbers of grandchildren born to them.
# Therefore the genes for male-producing tendencies spread, and male births become more common.
# As the 1:1 sex ratio is approached, the advantage associated with producing males dies away.
# The same reasoning holds if females are substituted for males throughout. Therefore 1:1 is the equilibrium ratio.}}

In modern language, the 1:1 ratio is the [[evolutionarily stable strategy]] (ESS).&lt;ref name=MaynardSmithPrice73&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/246015a0 | last1 = Maynard Smith | first1 = J | last2 = Price | first2 = G.R. | year = 1973 | title = The logic of animal conflict | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v246/n5427/abs/246015a0.html | journal = Nature | volume = 246 | issue = 5427| pages = 15–18 | bibcode=1973Natur.246...15S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parental expenditure==
In Chapter 6 "Sexual Reproduction and [[Sexual selection|Sexual Selection]]", Fisher wrote under the heading "Natural Selection and the sex-ratio" (page 141)&lt;ref name=Fisher30&gt;[[Ronald Fisher|Fisher, R.A.]] 1930 ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]'', Clarendon Press, Oxford&lt;/ref&gt; the explanation described by [[Eric Charnov]] and [[James J. Bull]] as being "characteristically terse" and "cryptic":&lt;ref name=BullCharnov88&gt;Bull, J. J., and E. L. Charnov, 1988 How fundamental are Fisherian
sex ratios?, pp. 96–135 in Oxford Surveys on Evolutionary Biology,
Vol. 5, edited by P. H. Harvey and L. Partridge. Oxford
University Press, Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In organisms of all kinds the young are launched upon their careers endowed with a certain amount of biological capital derived from their parents. This varies enormously in amount in different species, but, in all, there has been, before the offspring is able to lead an independent existence, a certain expenditure of nutriment in addition, almost universally, to some expenditure of time or activity, which the parents are induced by their instincts to make for the advantage of their young. Let us consider the reproductive value of these offspring at the moment when this parental expenditure on their behalf has just ceased. If we consider the aggregate of an entire generation of such offspring it is clear that the total reproductive value of the males in this group is exactly equal to the total value of all the females, because each sex must supply half the ancestry of all future generations of the species. From this it follows that the sex ratio will so adjust itself, under the influence of Natural Selection, that the total parental expenditure incurred in respect of children of each sex, shall be equal; for if this were not so and the total expenditure incurred in producing males, for instance, were less than the total expenditure incurred in producing females, then since the total reproductive value of the males is equal to that of the females, it would follow that those parents, the innate tendencies of which caused them to produce males in excess, would, for the same expenditure, produce a greater amount of reproductive value; and in consequence would be the progenitors of a larger fraction of future generations than would parents having a congenital bias towards the production of females.  Selection would thus raise the sex-ratio until the expenditure upon males became equal to that upon females.}}

==Development of the argument==
Fisher's principle is an early example of a model in which genes for greater production of either sex become equalized in the population, because each sex supplies exactly half the genes of all future generations.

Fisher's principle is rooted in the concept of frequency-dependent selection, though Fisher's principle is not frequency-dependent selection ''per se''. Frequency-dependent selection, in this scenario, is the logic that the probability of an individual being able to breed is dependent on the frequency of the opposite sex in relation to its own sex. It was first described by [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] in [[The Descent of Man|1871]].

Fisher's principle extends frequency dependence to explain how natural selection can act on genes that affect the frequency of an individual's grandchildren without affecting the frequency of their children. Fisher predicted that parents will invest their resources equally between each sex of offspring, because each sex supplies exactly half the genes of all future generations. As a result, those genes that cause parents to invest unequally in the sexes will tend to be selected against. Fisher was aware that in humans, more boys are born, whilst boys are also more likely to die in infancy. As a consequence, he reasoned that because parents tend to invest less in boys{{snd}} because more boys die before the end of the period of parental care{{snd}} there is a higher rate of male births to equalise parental investment in each sex.

Fisher's principle is also the precursor to [[evolutionary game theory]].  [[Robert MacArthur|R.H. MacArthur]] (1965) first suggested applying to sex ratios the language of [[game theory]],&lt;ref name=MacArthur65&gt;[[Robert MacArthur|MacArthur, R. H.]] (1965). in: ''Theoretical and mathematical biology'' T. Waterman &amp; H. Horowitz, eds. Blaisdell: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; and this was subsequently picked up by [[W.D. Hamilton]] (1967) who termed the equilibrium point the "[[unbeatable strategy]]".&lt;ref name=Hamilton67/&gt;  Hamilton's unbeatable strategy was refined by [[John Maynard Smith]] and [[George R. Price]] (1973) into their concept of the [[evolutionarily stable strategy]], i.e. one which cannot be invaded by a mutant strategy.&lt;ref name=MaynardSmithPrice73/&gt;

Fisher's concept of parental expenditure (now termed [[parental investment]]), developed particularly by [[Robert Trivers]] is now an important concept in [[ecology]].

==Fisher's sources==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8453">In linguistics, '''gapping''' is a type of [[ellipsis (linguistics)|ellipsis]] that occurs in the non-initial conjuncts of [[coordination (linguistics)|coordinate structures]].&lt;ref&gt;Gapping is limited to coordinate structures; it does not occur independent of coordination, as noted by McCawley (1988:48f.) and Kroeger (2004:35).&lt;/ref&gt; Gapping usually elides minimally a finite verb and further any non-finite verbs that are present. This material is "gapped" from the non-initial conjuncts of a coordinate structure. Gapping exists in many languages, but by no means in all of them, and gapping has been studied extensively and is therefore one of the more understood ellipsis mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;For prominent studies of gapping, see for instance Ross (1970), Jackendoff (1971), Kuno (1976), Hankamer (1979), Hartmann (2000), Osborne (2006), Johnson (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stripping (linguistics)|Stripping]] is viewed as a particular manifestation of the gapping mechanism where just one remnant (instead of two or more) appears in the gapped/stripped conjunct.

==Basic examples==
Canonical examples of gapping have a true "gap", which means the elided material appears medially in the non-initial conjuncts, with a '''remnant''' to its left and a remnant to its right. The elided material of gapping in all the examples below is indicated with subscripts and a smaller font:

::Some ate bread, and others &lt;sub&gt;ate&lt;/sub&gt; rice.
::Fred likes to pet the cat, and Sally &lt;sub&gt;likes to pet&lt;/sub&gt; the dog.
::Jim has been being observed by me, and Tom &lt;sub&gt;has been being observed&lt;/sub&gt; by you.

In the first sentence, the second conjunct has the subject ''others'', the object ''rice'', but the verb has been 'gapped', that is, omitted. Gapping can span several verbs and nonfinite clause boundaries, as the second and third sentence illustrate, but it cannot apply across a finite clause boundary, as seen in the next sentence:

:: *Sam said that they spoke German, and Charlene &lt;sub&gt;said that they spoke&lt;/sub&gt; Spanish.

The star * indicates that the sentence is bad. Gapping is also incapable of operating backwards, which means that the antecedent to the gap must precede the gap. Attempts at gapping where the gap precedes its antecedent are quite bad, e.g.

:: *He &lt;sub&gt;orders&lt;/sub&gt; beer, and she orders wine.

==Further examples==
While the canonical cases of gapping have medial gaps, the gap can also be discontinuous, e.g.

::Should I call you, or &lt;sub&gt;should&lt;/sub&gt; you &lt;sub&gt;call&lt;/sub&gt; me?
::Will Jimmy greet Jill first, or &lt;sub&gt;will&lt;/sub&gt; Jill &lt;sub&gt;greet&lt;/sub&gt; Jimmy &lt;sub&gt;first&lt;/sub&gt;?
::He believes her to know the answer, and she &lt;sub&gt;believes&lt;/sub&gt; him &lt;sub&gt;to know the answer&lt;/sub&gt;.
::I expect you to help, and you &lt;sub&gt;expect&lt;/sub&gt; me &lt;sub&gt;to help&lt;/sub&gt;.

Many syntacticians take [[stripping (linguistics)|stripping]] (= bare argument ellipsis) to be a particular manifestation of gapping where only one remnant appears instead of two or more. If this assumption is correct, then the same ellipsis mechanism is at work in the following cases:

::Sam has done the work, and Bill &lt;sub&gt;has done the work&lt;/sub&gt;, too.
::Sophie barks at racoons in the morning, and &lt;sub&gt;Sophie barks&lt;/sub&gt; at squirrels &lt;sub&gt;in the morning&lt;/sub&gt;, too.
::Did Frank get married first, or &lt;sub&gt;did&lt;/sub&gt; Larry &lt;sub&gt;get married first&lt;/sub&gt;?

In its manifestation as stripping, the gapping mechanism occurs frequently. Gapping is widely assumed to obligatorily elide a finite verb. However, gapping can also occur when no finite verb is involved,&lt;ref&gt;The first example here is taken from Hudson (???).&lt;/ref&gt; e.g.

::With her keen on him, and him &lt;sub&gt;keen&lt;/sub&gt; on her, the party should be fun.
::It is impossible for Connor to be nice to Jilian, or Jilian &lt;sub&gt;to be nice&lt;/sub&gt; to Connor.

The gap of gapping cannot, however, cut into a ''major constituent'', e.g.

:: *I read the story about elves, and you &lt;sub&gt;read the story&lt;/sub&gt; about dwarves.
:: *Pictures of friends should make you smile, and &lt;sub&gt;pictures&lt;/sub&gt; of enemies &lt;sub&gt;should make you&lt;/sub&gt; frown.

==Theoretical analyses==
Gapping challenges [[phrase structure grammar|phrase structure]] theories of syntax because it is not evident how one might produce a satisfactory analysis of the material that can be gapped. The problem concerns the fact that the elided material often does not qualify as a [[constituent (linguistics)|constituent]], as many of the examples above illustrate.&lt;ref&gt;That the gap often does not qualify as a constituent is a widely acknowledged fact of gapping.  See for instance Kroeger (2004:1935) and Carnie (2013:459).&lt;/ref&gt; Faced with this challenge, one prominent approach is to assume some sort of movement. The remnants are moved out of an encompassing parent constituent so that the parent constituent can then be deleted. In other words, there is an ordering of transformations. First the remnants are moved out of their parent constituent and then that parent constituent is elided. The difficulty with such movement analyses concerns the nature of the movement mechanisms, since the movement mechanism needed to vacate the parent constituent would be unlike the recognized movement mechanisms (fronting, scrambling, extraposition).

An alternative analysis of gapping assumes that the [[catena (linguistics)|catena]] is the basic unit of syntactic analysis.&lt;ref&gt;See Osborne et al. (2012) argue that the catena is the relevant unit of syntactic analysis for all types of ellipsis, not just for gapping.&lt;/ref&gt; The catena is associated with [[dependency grammar]]s and is defined as ''any word or any combination of words that is continuous with respect to dominance''. The elided material of gapping always qualifies as a catena. This situation is illustrated with the following tree, which shows the dependency structure of a well-known example from Ross 1970:

::[[File:Gapping.jpg|Gapping examples]]

The a-clause is from Ross, whereas the clauses b-i have been added to illustrate the role that the catena plays. The (at least somewhat) acceptable clauses a-d have the elided material corresponding to a catena each time, whereas the clauses e-i are unacceptable each time because the elided material does not correspond to a catena. The star * indicates that the clauses are bad. For instance, the elided material ''wants...to begin'', to the exclusion of ''to try'', is not a catena in (g). The other main forms of [[ellipsis (linguistics)|ellipsis]] (e.g. answer fragments, [[sluicing]], [[verb phrase ellipsis|VP-ellipsis]], etc.) can also all be investigated in terms of the catena. The elided material of most if not all ellipsis mechanisms corresponds to catenae.

This embodied the early modern "...common way of understanding [[human nature]]...through analyzing how European bodies altered as a result of being in one climate rather than another – some Europeans, notably those in cold northern climes, such as the English and Scots, and those in southern climes, such as those close to the shores of tropical Africa, had their bodies altered sufficiently by environmental factors so as to be morally defective and physically decrepit" ([[David Abulafia|Abulafia]] qtd. in Burnard par. 7).

The '''Golden Wind Zen Order''' (GWZO) is an American Zen Buddhist Order with centers and groups in Long Beach, CA and Seattle, WA. It was founded in 2004 by Zen Master Ji Bong  (Robert Moore). Moore began training with the Korean Zen Master Seung Sahn in 1974, and was one of the founders of the New Haven Zen Center and core teachers of the early years of the international Kwan Um School of Zen. He was a teacher at several centers around the United States, and after more than twenty years of training, he received Dharma transmission from Seung Sahn in 1997.

Moore established his own practice center in the 1990s, and eventually broke off from the Kwan Um School in 2004 to establish an independent organization, the Golden Wind Zen Order. Though not affiliated with the Kwan Um School, the GWZO follows many of its practice forms, with an emphasis on seated meditation practice, kong-an training, and chanting.

The Order's practice centers are the Golden Wind Zen Center (currently in the Signal Hill area of Long Beach, CA) and the Blue Heron Zen Community in Seattle, WA.

==History==
The Korean Zen Master Seung Sahn, Robert Moore, and Paul Lynch founded the Huntington Beach Zen Center in 1993. The first center was a four bedroom house, with the Dharma Room located in the back of the house. In early 1994 the Zen Center accepted its first resident, who lived as a novice monk full-time at the Zen Center. A few residents moved in and out of the Huntington Beach Zen Center, including a Korean monk. In 1995 the Zen Center was moved to a larger six bedroom house in Stanton. At that time Zen Master Seung Sahn suggested changing the name of the center to Ocean Eyes Zen Center.

In 1997 the Ocean Eyes Zen Center moved from Stanton to a residence in [[Long Beach, California]] where it was established as a residential center with 5 to 6 full-time resident students. However, the residential model came into conflict with local zoning ordinances, and in 1999 the Center became temporarily homeless. However, students continued to practice in transitional locations in Whittier and in San Pedro until 2000, when the Center reopened at a new location in Long Beach. In 2011, the Center re-located to a commercial building in the Signal Hill area of Long Beach.

These centers were all affiliated with the international Kwan Um School of Zen until 2004. That year Moore and the membership decided to change the name of the Center to the Golden Wind Zen Center, and to affiliate with a new, independent teaching organization called the Golden Wind Zen Order.

The Dharma Sound Zen Community in Seattle, WA was originally established under the auspices of the Kwan Um School of Zen, with Moore as their guiding teacher. After Moore established the GWZO, Dharma Sound members elected to retain Moore as their guiding teacher, and to affiliate with the GWZO. In 2006, Dharma Sound changed its name to the Blue Heron Zen Community, and also separated from the Kwan Um School.

Over some two decades, Moore trained several students to become teachers or "Ji Do Poep Sunims" (JDPSN, or "Dharma Masters"). These have included Jeff Tipp, Eric Nord, and Anita Feng in Seattle, along with Tim Colohan and Sensei Frank McGouirk in Long Beach. McGouirk has been the head teacher and director of the Aikido-Ai dojo in Whittier, CA for several years, and some GWZO members also practice and teach there. After nearly twenty years of training, Colohan left the GWZO in 2015 to pursue other teaching and practice opportunities.

In 2015, Zen Master Ji Bong (Robert Moore) gave transmission to his first Dharma heir, Zen Master Jeong Ji (Anita Feng) at the Blue Heron Zen Community in Seattle, WA.

'''Gonzalo Arango Arias''' (born in [[Andes, Antioquia|Andes]], [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]] 1931 &amp;ndash; [[Tocancipá]], [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]] 1976) was a Colombian poet, journalist and philosopher. During a repressive phase of government in the 1940s he led a literary movement known as [[Nadaísmo]] (Nothing-''ism'').&lt;ref&gt;Pensamiento Colombiano Del Siglo XX, Volume 2, Page 199&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Geographic Traveler: Colombia - Page 51 Christopher Baker - 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He and other young Colombian thinkers of his generation in the movement were inspired by the Colombian philosopher [[Fernando González (writer)|Fernando González Ochoa]].

Arango's life was characterized by large contrasts from an open atheism to an intense spirituality, and a strong criticism of the society of his time. Those contrasts can be read in the ''First Manifesto of Nadaísmo'' as "''The artist is considered sometimes a symbol fluctuation between holiness and madness''".&lt;ref&gt;'''Es''': ARANGO, Gonzalo, [http://www.gonzaloarango.com/ Primer Manifiesto Nadaista], 1958, gonzaloarango.com. Link retrieved on June 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Arango died in a tragic car accident in the city of [[Tocancipá]] in 1976 when he was planning to move to [[London]]  so that "''by losing me, Colombians win me''".&lt;ref&gt;'''Es''': VELEZ ESCOBAR, Juan Carlos, [http://www.gonzaloarango.com/ Hace 25 años se mató Gonzalo Arango], en gonzaloarango.com.  Link retrieved on June 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==

Gonzalo Arango was born in [[Andes, Antioquia|Andes]], a town of the [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]]n South-Eastern region in 1931, in a time known in [[Colombia]] as the Regime of the Liberals that had to face the [[Great Depression]]. It was also the time of Constitutional and social reforms such as that of president [[Alfonso López Pumarejo]]. When he was an adolescent he saw the falling of the country into a bloody fight between the two traditional political parties after [[El Bogotazo]] of April 9, 1948, a period of violent civil strife that was triggered by the murder of presidential candidate [[Jorge Eliecer Gaitán]]. He lived also in a time when the [[Catholic Church]] in Colombia possessed the control of education, thanks to the Colombian Constitution of 1886, and thus exerted a great authority over political, cultural and social matters, such as in the censorship over intellectual material produced in the nation. As an example, one of the works by philosopher [[Fernando González (writer)|Fernando González Ochoa]], "''Viaje a pie''" (Trip by foot) was forbidden by the [[Archbishop]] of [[Medellín]] under death penalty in 1929. This social context promoted his growing as an eccentric writer and thinker, and would influence Arango's work.

Arango was the last son of the 13 children of Francisco Arango (known as Don Paco) and Magdalena Arias. Don Paco was the telegraphist of the town and Madgalena was a housewife.

=== His beginning as a writer ===

In 1947 he began to study [[Law]] in the [[University of Antioquia]], but three years later he left the studies to devote himself to writing, starting with his first work "''Después del Hombre''" (After the Man). The eccentric writer stole a skull from the Saint Peter Cemetery of Medellín&lt;ref name="Boceto biográfico"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gonzaloarango.com/vida/suvida_ind.htm |author=Eduardo Escobar |title=Nadaísmo revisado |date=December 11, 2006 |location=Bogota |website=gonzaloarango.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604212958/http://www.gonzaloarango.com/vida/suvida_ind.htm |archivedate=2008-06-04 |accessdate=June 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be his companion in a country farm of his relatives where he went to live alone. About this time Eduardo Escobar wrote:

{{cita|(...) don Paco Arango, his father, went to visit him, concerned. He utterly disliked what he saw: the young poet thin and yellow, the pile of acid bones bitterly hairless, giving himself to write a novel. The title said everything. Its name was ''After the Man''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gonzaloarango.com/vida/suvida_ind.htm |author=Eduardo Escobar |title=Nadaísmo revisado |date=December 11, 2006 |location=Bogota |website=gonzaloarango.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604212958/http://www.gonzaloarango.com/vida/suvida_ind.htm |archivedate=2008-06-04 |accessdate=June 12, 2008 |quote=(...) don Paco Arango, su padre, fue a visitarlo, preocupado.

Se llamaba Después del hombre''. &lt;!-- Please try a best translation --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Rojas Pinilla ===

On June 13, 1953 General [[Gustavo Rojas Pinilla]] led a bloodless [[Coup d'etat]] to the authoritarian conservative president [[Laureano Gómez]] to bring peace to the country after many years of civil war between liberals and conservatives. The Assembly that replaced the [[Congress of the Republic of Colombia|Congress]], composed mostly of [[Colombian Conservative Party|conservatives]], re-elected him for the next presidential period until 1958.  The Rojas coup was seen by many as a solution to the political crisis, the violence in the country, and as an alternative to the two traditional national parties.  Young Arango was a Rojas supporter, joining the  ''Movimiento Amplio Nacional - MAN'' (National Wide Movement) composed of artists and young intellectuals that supported the dictator.&lt;ref name="Boceto biográfico"/&gt; In this period, Arango devoted himself to journalism.

Soon, however, the reaction of the leaders of conservatives and liberals against Rojas was manifested in an agreement that caused his fall on May 10, 1957. While the dictator was exiled in [[Spain]], Gonzalo Arango fled to [[Department of Chocó|Chocó]].

=== Creation of Nadaísmo ===

He took refuge in the city of [[Cali]] in 1957. It was in the bohemian lifestyle of the [[salsa music]]'s city where he started to give form to the Nadaism that he was to express in the First Manifesto, to be published a year later in [[Medellín]]. The dishonour of having supported a lost cause and the feeling of no future, with nothing, brought him to look for other companions who thought likewise about society:

{{cita|What did I have. He asked himself. Nothing. Nothing-ism (Nadaísmo). He enlightened the future upon the ruins. He decided to rise as a rebel against the horrible dullness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gonzaloarango.com/vida/suvida_ind.htm |author=Eduardo Escobar |title=Nadaísmo revisado |date=December 11, 2006 |location=Bogota |website=gonzaloarango.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604212958/http://www.gonzaloarango.com/vida/suvida_ind.htm |archivedate=2008-06-04 |accessdate=June 12, 2008 |quote=Qué tenía. Se preguntó. Nada. Nadaísmo. Alumbró el futuro sobre la ruina. Decidió que se levantaría en rebeldía contra la horrible lascitud. &lt;!-- Please try a best translation --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The first people to join the new movement were Alberto Escobar and Amilkar Osorio and, as an inauguration, they burned in 1958 in Plazuela de San Ignacio of Medellín the Colombian literature as a symbol against what was considered the traditional and masterpiece of literature. One of the books was his own first work, "After the Man".

The following year the Nadaists sabotaged the First Congress of Catholic Intellectuals in Medellín, a reason enough to be sent to prison in the same city. In prison he received the visit of Fernando González, the philosopher of ''Otraparte'' and one of his first inspirations. Among other Nadaist scandals is the sacrilege of the [[Sacramental bread|Holy Host]] in the Basilica of Medellín in 1961, a fact that had international consequences, and that he himself later repented for.

In 1963 he began a new change in his life and he was symbolically burned by the Nadaists in a bridge in Cali. He published a poetic anthology of ten Nadaists and wrote for ''La Nueva Prensa''.

== Nadaísmo (Nothing-ism) ==

The ''Nadaísmo'' movement continues to be a matter of study, because it was an authentic literary revolution in the Colombia of the second part of the 20th century. It has as its first inspiration the books of the philosopher [[Fernando González (writer)|Fernando González Ochoa]] and is framed by the flamboyant methods of [[surrealism]].

More than anything, ''Nadaísmo'' was Gonzalo Arango's creation and inspiration, and his goal for it was that of "not leaving intact any faith or any idol in place," according to the First Manifesto. The Movement was deeply entrenched in the 1960s and attracted young talented  writers of the time who created a strong literary school in Colombia, especially in poetry. The first ''Nadaists'' with Arango were Amílcar Osorio (known as Amílkar U) and Eduardo Escobar. Others would come such as Elmo Valencia and Jotamario Arbeláez. The cities of [[Medellín]] and [[Cali]] became the first setting for the development of the Movement, but it became soon of a national level.

Nadaism manifested its nonconformity against the social order of the time under the rule of the two Colombian traditional political parties (Liberal and Conservative), against a very conservative social structure, against bourgeoisie, and against mass revolutions with totalitarian aims. It was also a bohemian movement dedicated to poetry that was given as closed by its own founder at the beginning of the 1970s, but was continued by some of its followers even until modern times, like Jotamario Arbeláez and Eduardo Escobar.&lt;ref name="Boceto biográfico"/&gt;

== Abandonment of Nadaism ==

As a surprise for his followers, Gonzalo Arango abandoned Nadaísmo in 1970, an event that was considered by the Nadaists as treason to its original principles. Already in 1968 he wrote an article of admiration for president [[Carlos Lleras Restrepo]] that caused the disapproval of the Nadaists. It was the beginning of the separation of the founder and his foundation until the day of his death.

The man who wrote manifestos against Catholic writers, began a new time of profound spirituality and the writing of love poems for his lover, the [[United Kingdom|British]] Angela Mary Hickie:

{{cita|For ''Angelita'', Nadaísmo died in the 1970s buried by its own father. For this reason she remembers that in "''Correspondencia violada''" Arango goes against his own disciples and said that "they are digging out their old literary corpses to live from them in an advertising sense, disguising their past of soulless modernity, plastic philosophical eggs. What a lack of faith in life to still believe in Nadaism as the salvation...! What is important is what we are and not what we were,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gonzaloarango.com/vida/suvida_ind.htm |author=Eduardo Escobar |title=Nadaísmo revisado |date=December 11, 2006 |location=Bogota |website=gonzaloarango.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604212958/http://www.gonzaloarango.com/vida/suvida_ind.htm |archivedate=2008-06-04 |accessdate=June 12, 2008 |quote=Para Angelita, el nadaísmo murió en los años 70, enterrado por su propio progenitor. Y por eso recuerda que en Correspondencia violada Arango arremete contra sus discípulos y dice que están “desenterrando sus viejos cadáveres literarios para vivir de ellos en un sentido publicitario, maquillando su pasado de modernidad sin alma, huevos filosofales de plástico. ¡Qué falta de fe en la vida seguir creyendo que el nadaísmo es la salvación...! Lo que vale es lo que somos, no lo que fuimos}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, for Colombian writers of Nadaism like Jotamario Arbeláez and Eduardo Escobar, the movement is still alive in dissenter youngsters:

{{cita|"You shouldn't get into an argument with [[Yoko Ono]] or [[Maria Kodama]], on the risk of legitimizing them - said Arbeláez -. If we Nadaists were to devote ourselves to answer to Angelita, that would mean the real sign of our decadency as extremists, after 50 years of keeping alive the most negative and virulent movement of the history in literature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gonzaloarango.com/vida/suvida_ind.htm |author=Eduardo Escobar |title=Nadaísmo revisado |date=December 11, 2006 |location=Bogota |website=gonzaloarango.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604212958/http://www.gonzaloarango.com/vida/suvida_ind.htm |archivedate=2008-06-04 |accessdate=June 12, 2008 |quote=No se polemiza con Yoko Ono ni con María Kodama, a riesgo de legitimarlas —sostiene Arbeláez—. Si los nadaístas nos dedicáramos a contestarle a Angelita, esa sí sería la muestra palpable de nuestra decadencia como extremistas, luego de 50 años de mantener con vida el movimiento más negativo y virulento en la historia de la literatura}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Gonzalo Arango was also a journalist and he participated in different newspapers and magazines both in his country like ''Nueva Prensa'', ''Cromos Magazine'', and outside, as ''Corno Emplumado'' ([[Mexico]]) and ''Zona Franca'' ([[Venezuela]]). He published also his ''Nadaism Magazine''.

"The Prophet," as he liked to call himself and was so called by his followers, ended his life in a tragic accident on the road [[Bogotá]] - [[Tunja]] on September 25, 1976.

'''Govindananda Bharati''' also known as ''Shivapuri Baba'' was a [[Hindu]] [[saint]] and a traveller hermit who taught the world ''swadharma'', the ancient system of living. He is the first Keralite to encircle the world (almost entirely on foot) and earned the name ''Malayali Magellan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2013-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Born as Jayanthan Nambudiripad in Akkikkavu of [[Thrissur District]] in 1826, he lost his family at the age of 9. He was born along with his twin sister.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Swadharma|last=Timilsina|first=Bishnu Prasad|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; His grandfather Achyutam, who was a well known astrologer in the court of [[Tipu Sultan]], looked after him. By the age of sixteen he had completed his education of four Vedas, Ayurveda, and Dhanurveda. He left his home when he was 24 with his grandfather. He served his grandfather and attained ''Iswarasakshatkaram'' in Amarantaka forest of [[Madhya Pradesh]]. After getting enlightenment, he became ''sanyasi'' in Sringeri Math and changed his name to Govindananda Bharathi.

Only after living in the Shivapuri peak of Shivapuri-Nagarjun National Park for more than 25 years, he came to be known by the name of Shivapuri Baba, as locals called him. [[John G. Bennett]] had made contact with the Shivapuri Baba, a Hindu sage living in Nepal. He had first heard of the Shivapuri Baba in the early 1940s, and now learned from Hugh Ripman (a fellow student of Ouspensky) that the yogi was still alive. Bennett visited the Shivapuri Baba twice between 1961 and 1963, by which time the Shivapuri Baba was reportedly 136 years old. Bennett was impressed with the vitality and simplicity of the Shivapuri Baba's teaching, and later referred to him as his teacher. Bennett undertook to propagate the Shivapuri Baba's teaching and made various attempts to incorporate it into his own work.

Shivapuri Baba died in 1963, shortly after he had approved the draft for his biography, Bennett's ''Long Pilgrimage - The Life and Teaching of the Shivapuri Baba''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duversity.org/institute_2.htm HISTORY OF THE INSTITUTE FOR THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF HISTORY, PHILOSOPHY AND THE SCIENCES, LTD. - Shivapuri Baba]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The year of birth of Govindananda Bharati is unsubstantiated. The claim that his place of birth was in Akkikkavu, Thrissur District, Kerala, is also based on speculation, and lacks evidence.

== Research ==

In the 1980s Dr. Blau's findings challenged the prevalent view that the mammalian differentiated state is fixed and irreversible.&lt;ref name="Blau 758–766"/&gt;  In her famous heterokaryon experiments she fused differentiated cells of two different species to form stable non-dividing heterokaryons, and found that previously silent genes could be activated.&lt;ref name="Blau 4856–4860"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chiu 879–887"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chiu 417–424"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blau 758–766"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Reprogramming to a muscle fate by fusion recapitulates differentiation|journal = Journal of Cell Science|date = 2009-04-01|issn = 0021-9533|pmc = 2720934|pmid = 19295131|pages = 1045–1053|volume = 122|issue = Pt 7|doi = 10.1242/jcs.041376|first = Jason H.|last = Pomerantz|first2 = Semanti|last2 = Mukherjee|first3 = Adam T.|last3 = Palermo|first4 = Helen M.|last4 = Blau}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, human keratinocytes, hepatocytes and fibroblasts expressed muscle genes that they normally never would.

'''Henry Ercole''' (died 1764) was a minor Maltese mediaeval philosopher who specialised mainly in [[ethics]] and [[logic]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Montebello, ''Il-Ktieb tal-Filosofija f’Malta'' (''A Source Book of Philosophy in Malta''), PIN Publications, Malta, 2001, Vol. I, pp. 146f.&lt;/ref&gt; He enjoyed great esteem from his contemporaries, both as an administrator and a philosopher.

==Life==
It is still unclear where Ercole was born in Malta or when. He was a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friar, for sure, but it not known where he completed his initial studies, whether in [[Malta]], [[Sicily]] or elsewhere. The first time we come across documentary evidence about him is when, in 1711, he was Master of Studies at the ''Studium Generale'' of the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] at [[Rabat, Malta]]. Four years later, in 1715, he held the same office at [[Trapani]], [[Sicily]].

For some unknown reason, some time between 1716 and 1718 Ercole was expelled from [[Sicily]] by royal decree, and returned to [[Malta]]. He acquired his [[Bachelor's degree|Baccalaureate]] in theology between 1718 and 1722. In this latter year, Ercole was appointed Master of Studies at the Dominican ''Collegium Generale'' of [[Valletta]], [[Malta]]. A year later, in 1723, he became Master of Theology.

In 1724, Ercole’s life took a turn when he was chosen as Prior Provincial of the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] province of [[Sicily]] (which included also [[Malta]]). This was at [[Caltanisetta]], and Ercole was the first Maltese Dominican friar to achieve such a position. He remained in this office for two years, up till 1726, then returned to [[Malta]]. He lived at the convent of [[Valletta]], where, in 1734, he was chosen as Prior of the community. Ercole was twice the Vicar-General of the Maltese [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] on behalf of the Sicilian Prior Provincial. The second time was between 1738 and 1741.

Throughout this whole period, at least from 1711 onwards, Ercole never stopped teaching philosophy and theology. He was particularly close to the [[List of Grand Masters of the Knights Hospitaller|Grand Master]] of the [[Knights Hospitallers]], [[Manuel Pinto da Fonseca]], who consistently showered upon him innumerable favours. This stands as witness to Ercole’s position of high regard.

Unfortunately, no portrait of him has been discovered as yet.

==Extant works==
Very few works of Ercole seem to have survived. Three works by [[Rosarius Mary Hagius]] declare that Ercole gave his assistance in their composition, though they fall short of asserting that he was their co-author.

Only one light work is certainly his: '''''Lettere Famigliari''''' (''Convivial Letters''), dedicated to [[List of Grand Masters of the Knights Hospitaller|Grand Master]] [[Manuel Pinto da Fonseca]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript, which is held at [[National Library of Malta]] in [[Valletta]], [[Malta]], and marked as MS. 759, is made up of 231 folios (though in the extant document the last six pages are missing). The work is a collection of twenty-six letters, all signed, in which Ercole imagines writing to scholars who had put in doubt the shipwreck of [[St. Paul]] on [[Malta]] back in the 1st century as recounted in the Bible (''Acts of the Apostles'', Chapters 27-28). To illustrate his point, he also pens down a crude map of the [[Mediterranean Sea]].

Ercole’s writing is not a piece of rhetorical work, as one might expect with such themes. It is an interesting Scholastic disputation concentrating on the logic of statements put forward by the proponents. Ercole skilfully draws out certain main points, and examines their logical content and their syntax.

Apart from this work, it is possible that other compositions exist from Ercole’s hand. However, they might not bear his name, and much research is still needed to ascribe authorship to him.

He completed technical studies, [[musicology]] and philosophy in Warsaw. He received his Ph.D. in philosophy from [[Oxford University]].

The student of [[Tadeusz Kotarbiński]] and [[Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz]], he specialized in [[logic]] and [[philosophy of language]]. Skolimowski earned a doctorate at the University of Oxford, where he also taught before he began his professorships at the [[University of Southern California]] in Los Angeles, and then at the [[University of Michigan]], [[Ann Arbor]], where he was for many years a professor of philosophy, and now holds the position of professor emeritus. Today he is considered to be the leading thinker in the field of [[ecosophy|eco-philosophy]].

Skolimowski's work is targeted at overcoming human [[angst]] and disconnection caused in part by the overwhelming preponderance of modern technology, which had its seeds in the Industrial Revolution. Our accelerating dependence on technology at the expense of a right relationship with Nature and the planet is a prime concern within Skolimowski's work, as is the increasing inability of organized patriarchal religions to provide a meaningful spiritual platform from which modern human beings may appropriately evolve.

During decades of travel and involvement with leading thinkers across the globe, Skolimowski has become familiar a great variety of cultures, and has included winning precepts from them into his works. He is the author of over 50 books and hundreds of scientific and academic papers. He is also a poet. He writes in English.  In the years 1992–1997 Skolimowski held the position of Chair of Eco-Philosophy at [[Technical University of Lodz]], the first such position of its kind in the world.

Other information:
* Skolimowski is part  of a new branch of philosophy called Eco-Philosophy, which claims that THE WORLD IS A SANCTUARY. From this central assumption immediately follows reverence for life and for all there is, responsibility for the world and society, altruism and sharing as the basis for ethics, and ecological spirituality, which maintains that the ecological and the spiritual are one.
* Swimming against the current of the disengaged academic philosophy, Skolimowski has insisted, for the last four decades, that philosophy must be committed to life, must be living philosophy, helping life to unfold and to flourish. More recently, he proposed a new cosmology of light, according to which Light is the source of it all; it is truly a Great Mother; if we have the eyes to see and the mind to bear its greatness. Light is the source of all spiritualities and religions.
* Skolimowski's passions are: hiking in the mountains - the higher the better; watching the sunrise over the Himalayas - it has been his sublime experience; also watching the stars in the mountains on moonless nights...and sometimes dialoguing with the stars.
* creator of a new department of philosophy - eco-philosophy, Poland 1993
* Founder of the Eco-Philosophy Center based in Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA. 1981
* member of the President's Council for Environmental in Poland 1994/97

{{Hermeticism}}

The '''''Hermetica''''' are [[Egypt]]ian-[[Greece|Greek]] [[Wisdom literature|wisdom texts]] from the 2nd century AD and later, which are mostly presented as [[Plato#The dialogues|dialogues]] in which a teacher, generally identified as [[Hermes Trismegistus]] ("thrice-greatest [[Hermes]]"), [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightens]] a disciple. The texts form the basis of [[Hermeticism]]. They discuss the [[Divinity|divine]], the [[cosmos]], [[mind]], and [[nature]]. Some touch upon [[alchemy]], [[astrology]], and related concepts.

==Scope==
The term particularly applies to the '''''Corpus Hermeticum''''', [[Marsilio Ficino]]'s Latin translation in fourteen tracts, of which eight [[incunabulum|early printed]] editions appeared before 1500 and a further twenty-two by 1641.&lt;ref&gt;Noted by [[George Sarton]], review of [[Walter Scott (scholar)|Walter Scott]]'s ''Hermetica'', ''Isis'' '''8'''.2 (May 1926:343-346) p. 345&lt;/ref&gt; This collection, which includes ''[[Poimandres]]'' and some addresses of Hermes to disciples Tat, Ammon and Asclepius, was said to have originated in the school of [[Ammonius Saccas]] and to have passed through the keeping of [[Michael Psellus]]: it is preserved in fourteenth century manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Anon, ''Hermetica – a new translation'', Pembridge Design Studio Press, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; The last three tracts in modern editions were translated independently from another manuscript by Ficino's contemporary [[Lodovico Lazzarelli]] (1447–1500) and first printed in 1507. Extensive quotes of similar material are found in classical authors such as [[Joannes Stobaeus]].

Parts of the ''Hermetica'' appeared in the 4th-century Gnostic library found in [[Nag Hammadi]]. Other works in [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Coptic language|Coptic]] and other languages may also be termed ''Hermetica'' — another famous tract is the ''[[Emerald Tablet]]'', which teaches the doctrine "as above, so below".

All these are themselves remnants of a more extensive literature, part of the [[syncretism|syncretic]], intellectualized paganism of their era, a cultural movement that also included the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic philosophy]] of the [[Greco-Roman mysteries]] and late [[Orpheus|Orphic]] and [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] literature and influenced [[Gnosticism|Gnostic forms]] of the [[Abrahamic religions]]. There are significant differences:&lt;ref&gt;[[Roel van den Broek|Broek, Roelof Van Den]]. "Gnosticism and Hermitism in Antiquity: Two Roads to Salvation." In Broek, Roelof Van Den, and Wouter J. Hanegraaff. 1998. ''Gnosis and Hermeticism From Antiquity to Modern Times.'' Albany: State University of New York Press.&lt;/ref&gt; the Hermetica are little concerned with [[Greek mythology]] or the technical minutiae of metaphysical [[Neoplatonism]]. The Hermetica are heavily influenced by [[Judaism]] and explicitly refer to Genesis 1:28.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Everett. Backgrounds of early Christianity. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2003: pg. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Copenhaver, Brian P. Hermetica: The Greek Corpus Hermeticum and the Latin Asclepius in a new English translation, with notes and introduction. Cambridge University Press, 1995: pg. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; However most of these schools do agree in attributing the creation of the world to a [[Demiurge]] rather than the supreme being&lt;ref&gt;Anon, ''Hermetica – a new translation'', Pembridge Design Studio Press, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; and in accepting [[reincarnation]]. Although [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] philosophers, who quote apocryphal works of [[Orpheus]], [[Zoroaster]], [[Pythagoras]] and other figures, almost never cite [[Hermes Trismegistus]], the tracts were still popular enough in the 5th century to be argued against by [[Augustine of Hippo]] in the ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ls.poly.edu/~jbain/mms/texts/mmsaugustine.htm vii.23&amp;ndash;26]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character and antiquity==
The extant Egyptian-Greek texts dwell upon the oneness and goodness of God, urge purification of the soul, and defend pagan religious practices, such as the veneration of images. Their concerns are practical in nature, their end is a spiritual rebirth through the enlightenment of the mind:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Seeing within myself an immaterial vision that came from the mercy of God, I went out of myself into an immortal body, and now I am not what I was before. I have been born in mind!&lt;ref&gt;''Corpus Hermeticum'' XIII.3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While they are difficult to date with precision, the texts of the ''Corpus'' were likely redacted between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD. During the Renaissance these texts were believed to be of ancient Egyptian origin and even today some readers believe them to date from [[ancient Egypt|Pharaonic Egypt]]. Since [[Plato]]'s [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]] dwelt upon the great antiquity of the Egyptian teachings upon which the philosopher purported to draw, scholars were willing to accept that these texts were the sources of Greek ideas. However the classical scholar [[Isaac Casaubon]] (1559–1614) successfully argued that some, mainly those dealing with philosophy, betrayed too recent a vocabulary. Hellenisms in the language itself point to a Greek-era origin. However, flaws in this dating were discerned by the 17th century scholar Ralph Cudworth, who argued that Casaubon's allegation of forgery could only be applied to three of the seventeen treatises contained within the Corpus Hermeticum. Moreover, Cudworth noted Casaubon's failure to acknowledge the codification of these treatises as a late formulation of a pre-existing oral tradition. According to Cudworth, the texts must be viewed as a terminus ad quem and not a quo. Lost Greek texts, and many of the surviving vulgate books, contained discussions of [[alchemy]] clothed in philosophical metaphor. And one text, the ''Asclepius'', lost in Greek but partially preserved in Latin, contained a bloody prophecy of the end of Roman rule in Egypt and the resurgence of pagan Egyptian power. Thus, it would be fair to assess the ''Corpus Hermeticum'' as intellectually eclectic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.granta.demon.co.uk/arsm/jg/corpus.html Secretum secretorum – An Overview of Magic in the Greco-Roman World]&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent research, while affirming the late dating in a period of [[Syncretism|syncretic]] cultural ferment in Roman Egypt, suggests more continuity with the culture of Pharaonic Egypt than had previously been believed.&lt;ref&gt;Fowden, Garth, The Egyptian Hermes : a historical approach to the late pagan mind (Cambridge/New York : Cambridge University Press), 1986&lt;/ref&gt; There are many parallels with Egyptian prophecies and hymns to the gods but the closest comparisons can be found in Egyptian [[wisdom literature]], which is characteristically couched in words of advice from a "father" to a "son".&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-Pierre Mahé]], "Preliminary Remarks on the Demotic "Book of Thoth" and the Greek Hermetica" ''Vigiliae Christianae'' '''50'''.4 (1996:353-363) p.358f.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] (late Egyptian) [[Papyrus|papyri]] contain substantial sections of a dialogue of Hermetic type between Thoth and a disciple.&lt;ref&gt;See R. Jasnow and Karl-Th. Zausich, "A Book of Thoth?" (paper given at the 7th International Congress of Egyptologists: Cambridge, 3–9 September 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptologist [[Flinders Petrie|Sir William Flinders Petrie]] states that some texts in the Hermetic corpus date back to the 6th century BC during the Persian period.&lt;ref&gt;"Historical References in the Hermetic writings," Transactions of the Third International Congress of the History of Religions. Oxford I (1908) pp. 196-225 and Personal Religion in Egypt before Christianity. New York: Harpers (1909) pp. 85-91.&lt;/ref&gt; Some similarities between the Demotic texts and Platonic philosophy could be the result of Plato and his followers' having drawn on Egyptian sources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Bernal|Bernal, Martin]], "Black Athena: The Afroasiatic Roots of Classical Civilization", volume I, p. 465. n. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/1996/96.04.05.html Martin Bernal's review of Mary Lefkowitz' "Not Out of Africa" (1996)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later history==
Many hermetic texts were lost to [[Western culture]] during the [[Middle Ages]] but rediscovered in Byzantine copies and popularized in [[Italy]] during the [[Renaissance]]. The impetus for this revival came from the [[Latin]] translation by [[Marsilio Ficino]], a member of the [[Cosimo de' Medici|de' Medici]] [[court (royal)|court]], who published a collection of thirteen tractates in 1471, as ''De potestate et sapientia Dei''.&lt;ref&gt;Among the treasures of the [[Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica]] in Amsterdam is this ''Corpus Hermeticum'' as published in 1471.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Hermetica'' provided a seminal impetus in the development of Renaissance thought and culture, having a profound impact on [[alchemy]] and modern magic as well as influencing philosophers such as [[Giordano Bruno]] and [[Pico della Mirandola]], Ficino's student. This influence continued as late as the 17th century with authors such as Sir [[Thomas Browne]].

Although the most famous examples of Hermetic literature were products of [[Greek language|Greek]]-speakers under Roman rule, the genre did not suddenly stop with the fall of the Empire but continued to be produced in [[Coptic language|Coptic]], [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Byzantine Greek]]. The most famous example of this later Hermetica is the ''Emerald Tablet'', known from medieval Latin and Arabic manuscripts with a possible Syriac source. Little else of this rich literature is easily accessible to non-specialists. The mostly gnostic [[Nag Hammadi Library]], discovered in 1945, also contained one previously unknown hermetic text called ''[[The Ogdoad and the Ennead]]'', a description of a hermetic initiation into gnosis that has led to new perspectives on the nature of Hermetism as a whole, particularly due to the research of [[Jean-Pierre Mahé]].&lt;ref&gt;Mahé, ''Hermès en Haute Egypte'' 2 vols. (Quebec) 1978, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standard editions==
[[John Everard (preacher)|John Everard]]'s historically important 1650 translation into [[English language|English]] of the ''Corpus Hermeticum'', entitled ''The Divine Pymander in XVII books'' (London, 1650) was from Ficino's Latin translation; it is no longer considered reliable by scholars. The modern standard editions are the Budé edition by A. D. Nock and A.-J. Festugière (Greek and French, 1946, repr. 1991) and Brian P. Copenhaver (English, 1992).

[[File:Self-portrait with Her Daughter by Elisabeth-Louise Vigée Le Brun.jpg|thumb|upright|''Madame Vigée-Lebrun et sa fille'', by [[Louise Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun]], 1789]]
A '''hug''' is a form of [[Affection|endearment]], universal in [[Communities|human communities]], in which two or more people put their [[arm]]s around the neck, back, or waist of one another and hold each other closely. If more than two persons are involved, it is referred to as a '''group hug'''.

==Etymology==
The origins of the word are unknown but two theories exist. The first is that the verb "hug" (first used in the 1560s) could be related to the [[Old Norse]] word ''hugga'', which meant to comfort. The second theory is that the word is related to the [[German language|German]] word ''hegen'' which means to foster or cherish, and originally meant to enclose with a hedge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=hug&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=hug - Origin and meaning of hug by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
A hug, sometimes in association with a [[kiss]], is a form of [[nonverbal communication]]. Depending on culture, context and [[interpersonal relationship|relationship]], a hug can indicate familiarity, [[love]], [[affection]], [[friendship]], brotherhood or [[sympathy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Hug Therapy Book |author=Kathleen Keating|year= 1994|publisher=Hazelden PES|isbn=1-56838-094-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A hug can indicate support, comfort, and consolation, particularly where words are insufficient. A hug usually demonstrates affection and emotional warmth, sometimes arising from joy or happiness when reunited with someone or seeing someone absent after a long time. A non-reciprocal hug may demonstrate a relational problem. A hug can range from a brief one second squeeze, with the arms not fully around the friend to an extended holding. The length of a hug in any situation is socially and culturally determined. In the case of lovers, and occasionally others, the [[hip]]s may also be pressed together. The emotionality of the hug furthermore influences the direction of the hug. In deeply emotional contexts, hugs tend to be more left-sided compared to hugs in neutral situations such as greetings. While the overall direction of hugs corresponds with physical motor phenotypes such as handedness, the emotional state induces an overall shift to the left attributed to right-hemispheric emotional processing. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00426-018-0985-8|title=Embracing your emotions: affective state impacts lateralisation of human embraces|first1=Julian|last1=Packheiser|first2=Noemi|last2=Rook|first3=Zeynep|last3=Dursun|first4=Janne|last4=Mesenhöller|first5=Alrescha|last5=Wenglorz|first6=Onur|last6=Güntürkün|first7=Sebastian|last7=Ocklenburg|date=18 January 2018|publisher=|journal=Psychological Research|pages=1–11|via=link.springer.com|doi=10.1007/s00426-018-0985-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763418304329|title=Hugs and Kisses - The role of motor preferences and emotional lateralization for hemispheric asymmetries in human social touch|first1=Sebastian|last1=Ocklenburg|first2=Julian|last2=Packheiser|first3=Judith|last3=Schmitz|first4=Noemi|last4=Rook|first5=Onur|last5=Güntürkün|first6=Jutta|last6=Peterburs|first7=Gina|last7=Grimshaw|date=15 October 2018|publisher=|journal=Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews|pages=353–360|via=sciencedirect.com|doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2018.10.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike some other types of physical contact, a hug can be practiced publicly and privately without [[social stigma|stigma]] in many countries, religions and cultures, within families, and also across age and gender lines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duranti|first1=Alessandro|title=Universal and Culture-Specific Properties of Greetings|journal=Journal of Linguistic Anthropology|date=June 1997|volume=7|issue=1|pages=63–97|accessdate=18 November 2015|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1525/jlin.1997.7.1.63}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is generally an indication that people are familiar with each other. Moving from a handshake (or touch-free) relationship to a hug relationship is a sign of a closer friendship such as best friends.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

[[File:Celebrating gold.jpg|thumb|upright=1||A hug after a sporting victory]]

An unexpected hug can be regarded as an invasion of a person's [[personal space]], but if it is reciprocated it is an indication that it is welcome. Some Western culture commentators advise avoiding hugs at work to prevent uncomfortable moments, especially with people who dislike hugging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/01/11/261467123/a-new-rule-for-the-workplace-hug-sparingly|agency=NPR|title=A New Rule For The Workplace: 'Hug Sparingly'|date=2014-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a person, especially a [[child]], may caress and hug a [[doll]] or [[stuffed animal]]. Young children will also hug their parents when they feel threatened by an unfamiliar person, although this may be regarded as clinging onto rather than hugging because it demonstrates a need for protection rather than affection.

==Cultural aspects==
While less common, hugging may be undertaken as part of a ritual or social act in certain social groups. It is a custom in some cultures such as France, Spain and Latin America for male friends to hug (as well as slap each other on the back) in a joyous greeting.&lt;ref&gt;William Cane, ''The Art of Hugging: The World-Famous Kissing Coach Offers Inspiration and Advice on Why, Where, and How to Hug'', St. Martin's Griffin, US, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; A similar hug, usually accompanied by a kiss on the cheek, is also becoming a custom among Western women at meeting or parting. In Portugal and Brazil, it is common, mostly among males, to finish letters and emails with ''Um abraço'' or ''Abraço'' followed by the sender's signature. Similar formulas may be used in oral communication.  In the [[Roman Catholic]] rite of the [[Holy Mass]] a hug may be substituted for a kiss or handshake during the [[kiss of peace]] ritual.

In May 2009, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that "the hug has become the favorite social greeting when teenagers meet or part these days" in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/28/style/28hugs.html |title=For Teenagers, Hello Means 'How About a Hug?' |date=2009-05-27 |first=Sarah |last=Kershaw |accessdate=2009-05-29 |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714020842/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/28/style/28hugs.html |archivedate=July 14, 2011 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; A number of schools in the United States have issued bans on hugs, which in some cases have resulted in student-led protests against these bans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecourier.com/Issues/2010/Apr/15/ar_news_041510_story1.asp?d=041510_story1,2010,Apr,15&amp;c=n |title=Students pan hugging ban |date=2010-04-15 |first=Denise |last=Grant |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320005015/http://www.thecourier.com/Issues/2010/Apr/15/ar_news_041510_story1.asp?d=041510_story1%2C2010%2CApr%2C15&amp;c=n |archivedate=2012-03-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kpho.com/news/15456156/detail.html |title=School Bans Hugs Over 2 Seconds |date=2008-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516085731/http://www.kpho.com/news/15456156/detail.html |archivedate=May 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Canadian journalistic investigation in 2015 noted the popularity of the hug in [[bromance]], among young francophone adults in [[Quebec]].&lt;ref&gt;Lili Boisvert, radio-canada.ca, [http://blogues.radio-canada.ca/originel/2015/01/19/bromance-ces-gars-qui-craquent-pour-leurs-amis/ Bromance : ces gars qui craquent pour leurs amis], Canada, January 19, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cultures do not use hugging as a sign of affection or love, such as the [[Himba people|Himba]] in [[Namibia]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} During the Islamic fasting month of [[Ramadan]], it is [[halal]] (permissible) for someone to hug one's significant other during daylight hours if one has self-control. However, if accompanied by libidinous urges, it is [[haram]] (sinful).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onislam.net/english/ask-the-scholar/acts-of-worship/fasting/fasting-rulings-and-regulations/169766-hugging-ones-spouse-while-fasting.html?Regulations=]{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020091114/http://www.onislam.net/english/ask-the-scholar/acts-of-worship/fasting/fasting-rulings-and-regulations/169766-hugging-ones-spouse-while-fasting.html?Regulations=|date=October 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the south Indian state of [[Kerala]] a sixteen-year-old boy was expelled from school for hugging a girl after she won a prize at an arts competition. When the Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights ordered the school to re-enroll the boy, it was challenged in the High Court. The Court nullified the Commission's order and upheld the school principal's order to expel the student saying "The school principal is the institution’s guardian, vested with powers to take action necessary to maintain discipline and morality in the school. The child rights commission cannot interfere there."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/kerala-class-12-student-expelled-for-hugging-in-school-hc-upholds-order/305657|title=Kerala Class 12 Student Expelled For Hugging In School, HC Upholds Order|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health benefits==
Hugging has been proven to have health benefits. One study has shown that hugs increase levels of [[oxytocin]] and reduce [[blood pressure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4131508.stm| title = How hugs can aid women's hearts| accessdate = 2008-11-28| date = August 8, 2005| publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Light|first=Kathleen C.|last2=Grewen|first2=Karen M.|last3=Amico|first3=Janet A.|title=More frequent partner hugs and higher oxytocin levels are linked to lower blood pressure and heart rate in premenopausal women|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0301051104001632|journal=Biological Psychology|volume=69|issue=1|pages=5–21|doi=10.1016/j.biopsycho.2004.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on significant research indicating that a 20-second-or-longer hug releases oxytocin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://health.usnews.com/health-news/health-wellness/articles/2016-02-03/the-health-benefits-of-hugging|title = The health benefits of hugging}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leo Buscaglia]] encourages people to hug for 21 days consecutively and to have each day a hug that lasts for a minimum of 21 seconds. He recommends "getting lost in the hug", encouraging people to slow down and "use the power of the hug to be fully present in the moment".{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

In the United States, 30,000 people have [[Williams syndrome]] and are prone to hugging others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/07/williams-health-love-genetics-books/|title=This Rare Medical Condition Makes You Love Everyone|date=16 July 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Group hug ==
[[File:Bromances.jpg|thumb|upright|A group hug among young men, showing their close friendship]]

A group hug has been found to be a useful tool in [[group therapy]] to cement a sense of cohesion among the participants after a session,&lt;ref name="Pesso"&gt;Albert Pesso, ''Movement in Psychotherapy: Psychomotor Techniques and Training'' (1969), pp. 92–93.&lt;/ref&gt; although it may cause discomfort for group members who shy away from physical contact.&lt;ref name="Pesso"/&gt;

== Cuddling ==
Cuddling is a related form of [[physical intimacy]] in which two people hold one another with each person's arms wrapped around the other's body. Cuddling can be with family members, friends or lovers. In 2014, British sociologists [[Eric Anderson (sociologist)|Eric Anderson]] and Mark McCormack published a study which showed that 93% of British heterosexual student-athletes had spooned or cuddled with a male friend, as a sign of friendship.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Anderson, Mark McCormack, Journal Men and Masculinities, [http://jmm.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/03/11/1097184X14523433.abstract Cuddling and Spooning: Heteromasculinity and Homosocial Tactility among Student-athletes], UK, March 12, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henry Alford, Journal nytimes.com, [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/28/fashion/the-bro-hug-embracing-a-change-in-custom.html?_r=0 The Bro Hug: Embracing a Change in Custom], US, September 26, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to hugging, cuddling is a more affectionate and intimate embrace, normally done for a longer period of time (usually lasting from a few minutes to several hours). In contrast to hugging, which can often be a [[nonverbal]] [[greeting]] or [[parting tradition]], cuddling is usually shared between two people who are lying down together or sitting somewhere in an intimate manner. Like hugging, cuddling makes the body release [[oxytocin]], which has a variety of effects.

'''''Idios kosmos''''' comes from Greek and means private world. It exists with, and is opposite to, '''''koinos kosmos''''' (shared world). ''Idios kosmos'' is the view of the world that is developed from personal experience and knowledge and is therefore unique; however, it can be difficult to tell the difference between it and ''koinos kosmos''.

The two phrases come from the [[Diels–Kranz numbering system|Diels-Kranz]] fragment B89 of [[Heraclitus]]: ὁ Ἡράκλειτός φησι τοῖς ἐγρηγορόσιν ἕνα καὶ κοινὸν κόσμον εἶναι τῶν δὲ κοιμωμένων ἕκαστον εἰς ἴδιον ἀποστρέφεσθαι  ("Heraclitus said that the waking have one common world, but the sleeping turn aside each into a world of his own.")

The idea of ''idios kosmos'' is an important part of [[Philip K. Dick]]'s views on [[schizophrenia]], as expressed in his 1964 essay "Schizophrenia &amp; 'The Book of Changes'", drawing on personal experience with the [[I Ching]].

'''Impartiality''' (also called '''evenhandedness''' or '''fair-mindedness''') is a principle of [[justice]] holding that decisions should be based on [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective criteria]], rather than on the basis of [[bias]], [[prejudice]], or preferring the benefit to one person over another for improper reasons.

==Legal concept==
[[European Union law]] refers in the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] to:
*A right to good administration:
:''Every person has the right to have his or her affairs handled '''impartially''', fairly and within a [[reasonable time]] by the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the [[European Union|Union]]'' (Article 41)
*A right to an effective remedy and to a [[fair trial]]:
:''Everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and '''impartial''' tribunal previously established by law'' (Article 47).&lt;ref&gt;European Parliament, Council and Commission, [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:12012P/TXT&amp;from=EN Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union], 26 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious concepts==

===Buddhism===
*Developing seven factors are conducive to the attainment of enlightenment: careful observation/attention/monitoring, curiosity/investigation of observed phenomena, effort/exertion/striving, anticipation/rapture, calm/tranquility, immersion/absorption, and equanimity/impartiality.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}
*The "four sublime states" are benevolence, compassion, appreciation, and impartiality/equanimity, which are claimed to be prerequisite skills for rebirth in a realm of gods, called Brahma realm. (Accesstoinsight.com){{reliable source|date=March 2014}}

===Christianity===
*"For there is no respect of persons with God." —[[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 2:11, [[KJV]]
*"But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons." —[[Colossians]] 3:25, KJV
*"My dear brothers and sisters, how can you claim that you have faith in our glorious Lord [[Jesus Christ]] if you favor some people more than others? For instance, suppose someone comes into your meeting dressed in fancy clothes and expensive jewelry, and another comes in who is poor and dressed in shabby clothes. If you give special attention and a good seat to the rich person, but you say to the poor one, 'You can stand over there, or else sit on the floor'—well, doesn't this discrimination show that you are guided by wrong motives? Listen to me, dear brothers and sisters. Hasn't God chosen the poor in this world to be rich in faith? Aren't they the ones who will inherit the Kingdom he promised to those who love him? And yet, you insult the poor man! Isn't it the rich who oppress you and drag you into court? Aren't they the ones who slander Jesus Christ, whose noble name you bear? Yes indeed, it is good when you truly obey our Lord's royal command found in the scriptures: '[[Love thy neighbor as thyself|Love your neighbor as yourself]]'. But if you pay special attention to the rich, you are committing a sin, for you are guilty of breaking that law." —[[Epistle of James]] 2:1-9, NLT
*"But the wisdom that comes from heaven is first of all pure; then peace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and sincere." -[[Epistle of James]] 3:17, [[NIV]]

===Hinduism===
*"Truth, O [[Bhārat Gaṇarājya|Bharata]], as it exists in all the world, is of thirteen kinds. The forms that Truth assumes are impartiality, self-control, forgiveness, modesty, endurance, goodness, renunciation, contemplation, dignity, fortitude, compassion, and abstention from injury."—Truth, The Mahabharata, Santi Parva, Section CLXII.

===Islam===
* "O you who have believed, be persistently standing firm in justice, witnesses for Allah, even if it be against yourselves or parents and relatives. Whether one is rich or poor, Allah is more worthy of both. So follow not [personal] inclination, lest you not be just. And if you distort [your testimony] or refuse [to give it], then indeed Allah is ever, with what you do, Acquainted." Quran 4:135.
* "O you who have believed, be persistently standing firm for Allah, witnesses in justice, and do not let the hatred of a people prevent you from being just. Be just; that is nearer to righteousness. And fear Allah ; indeed, Allah is Acquainted with what you do." Quran 5:8.

===Judaism===

*"You shall do no injustice in court. You shall not be partial to the poor or defer to the great, but in righteousness shall you judge your neighbor." —[[Leviticus]] 19:15, [[English Standard Version]]
*"You shall not be partial in judgment. You shall hear the small and the great alike." —[[Deuteronomy]] 1:17, ESV
*"These things also belong to the wise. It is not good to have respect of persons in judgment." —[[Book of Proverbs]] 24:23, KJV

[[Image:Jan Rokycana plaque Rokycany CZ town hall 0593.jpg|thumb|Memorial plaque of John of Rokycany on town hall in his home town of [[Rokycany]]]]
'''John of Rokycany''', also known as ''Jan of Rokycany'', in [[Czech language]] ''Jan Rokycana'', and ''Jan z Rokycan'' (c. 1396 in [[Rokycany]], [[Bohemia]] - 21 February 1471 in [[Prague]]) was a Czech [[Hussite]] theologian in the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] and a key figure in [[Bohemia]]n church history.

== Life ==
In his youth, Jan Rokycana entered the [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] monastery in Rokycany.  Later, he left the monastery to study in Prague, gaining his [[Bachelor's degree|baccalaureate]] in 1415.  He joined the movement against [[Jan Želivský]], after which he had to flee from Prague. He also opposed the [[Taborites]], most notably at [[Konopiště]] in 1423. Later in Prague he opposed [[Jan Žižka]], when he was blamed for the defeat of the Prague militia at [[Malešov]].

In 1427 he became the vicar of Týn church. He even opposed [[Sigismund Korybut]]. In 1429 he became the ''správcem duchovenstva podobojí'', or the Vicar General of the Prague Archbishopric.  In 1430 he earned his Master of Arts, and in 1435 became rector of [[Charles University]].

On 4 October 1441 he convened an assembly of [[The three orders|all estates]] at [[Kutná Hora]], where the fundamentals of Hussite belief were laid down as the law of the land. In the year 1442 he made his peace with [[Jan Příbram]]. In 1444, the courts found in favour of him against the [[Taborites]], who still refused to comply with the unanimous policy and the Tabor doctrine was decried.

In 1449, he started to correspond regularly with [[Pope Nicholas V]], because he needed to carry out ordinations to the priesthood. In the end, he tried to come to see the Pope in person, but was unable to pass through [[Germany]]. For this reason, in 1451 he started talks with  [[Constantinople]] about the potential cooperation of the Hussite and Greek Churches, but had to give up in 1452, when Constantinople fell to the [[Ottoman Turks]].

King [[Ladislaus Posthumus of Bohemia and Hungary|Ladislaus Posthumus]] (1440 - 1457) was unsure of Rokycan's agenda, so he avoided his sermons. In 1457, Jan Rokycana started corresponding again directly with the Pope (now [[Pope Callixtus III]]), though this was interrupted by Ladislaus's death.

The situation was somewhat improved by the rise of [[Jiří z Poděbrad]], and although Jiří z Poděbrad tried to reduce the power of the church, Jan Rokycana supported his election through his lectures. From the beginning, Jan endorsed Jiří z Poděbrad's politics and had all churches ring their bells to mark the reconciliation of the Vratislavskys.  In return, Jiří z Poděbrad considered him to represent the church and alternated between attending Jan Rokycana’s masses and those in [[St. Vitus Cathedral|Saint Vitus Cathedral]].

In 1461, Jiří z Poděbrad began aspiring to the crown of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], which would surely have meant renouncing the chalice of Hussitism. This led Jan Rokycana to speak against Jiří z Poděbrad in his sermons. On 7 February 1465 he took part in a dispute over the king's ministry, after which the king requested greater cooperation from the church. A year later, in 1466, Jan Rokycana suffered a stroke, after which he started to have trouble speaking. He was buried in [[Church of Our Lady in front of Týn|Týn church]].

For his seal, he used a horseshoe with a star, probably in memory of his father, who was a blacksmith.

== Works ==
* ''Postilla'' - collected by his students on the basis of his lectures from 1453 to 1457, probably the most interesting Czech ''[[postilla]]'', because it in no way discussed theological problems, but rather focused on the everyday problems of people living in those times. 
* ''Latinská postilla''
* ''Výklad zjevení svatého Jana'' - A Discussion of The Revelations of [[John the Apostle|Saint John]]
* ''Kázání u Kutné Hory'' - Sermons at [[Kutná Hora]]

* ''Latinský slovník'' - A Latin Dictionary
* ''Tractatus de eucharista''
* ''Tractatus de septem sacramentis''

He has also been credited by some sources with the composing of several songs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5101">'''John Earman''' (born 1942) is an American [[philosophy of physics|philosopher of physics]]. He is an emeritus professor in the [[History and Philosophy of Science]] department at the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. He has also taught at UCLA, the Rockefeller University, and the University of Minnesota, and was president of the Philosophy of Science Association. He received his PhD from Princeton in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hps.pitt.edu/profile/earman.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

John Earman was born in Washington, D.C. in 1942 and earned his Ph.D. at Princeton University in 1968 with a dissertation on temporal asymmetry directed by [[Carl Gustav Hempel]] and [[Paul Benacerraf]].  After holding professorships at UCLA, the Rockefeller University, and the University of Minnesota, he joined the faculty of the History and Philosophy of Science department of the [[University of Pittsburgh]] in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pitt.edu/~pittcntr/About/The_Berlin_School.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; He remained at Pittsburgh for the rest of his career, recently retiring to become Professor Emeritus.  Earman is a former president of the [[Philosophy of Science Association]] and a fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], and of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hps.pitt.edu/profile/earman.php&lt;/ref&gt;  He is a member of the Archive Board of the Phil-Sci Archive.&lt;ref&gt;http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/information.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==The hole argument==
{{details|hole argument}}
Earman has notably contributed to debate about the "hole argument". The hole argument was invented for slightly different purposes by [[Albert Einstein]] late in 1913 as part of his quest for the [[general theory of relativity]] (GTR). It was revived and reformulated in the modern context by John3 (a short form for the "three Johns": John Earman, [[John Stachel]], and John Norton).

With the GTR, the traditional debate between [[Absolute truth|absolutism]] and [[relationalism]] has been shifted to whether or not [[spacetime]] is a substance, since the GTR largely rules out the existence of, e.g., absolute positions. The "hole argument" offered by John Earman is a powerful argument against [[manifold substantialism]].

This is a technical mathematical argument but can be paraphrased as follows:

Define a function &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; as the identity function over all elements over the [[manifold]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, excepting a small neighbourhood ([[topology]]) &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; belonging to &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. Over &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; comes to differ from identity by a smooth function.

With use of this function &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; we can construct two mathematical models, where the second is generated by applying &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; to proper elements of the first, such that the two models are identical prior to the time &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is a time function created by a [[foliation]] of spacetime, but differ after &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt;.

These considerations show that, since substantialism allows the construction of holes, that the universe must, on that view, be indeterministic. Which, Earman argues, is a case against substantialism, as the case between [[determinism]] or [[indeterminism]] should be a question of physics, not of our commitment to substantialism.

'''Jorge J.E. Gracia''' (born 1942, [[Cuba]]) is the Samuel P. Capen Chair, SUNY Distinguished Professor in the Department of [http://www.buffalo.edu/cas/philosophy/faculty/faculty_directory/gracia.html Philosophy] and Department of Comparative Literature in the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|State University of New York at Buffalo]].  Gracia was educated in Cuba, the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and Spain, and received his Ph.D. in Medieval Philosophy from the [[University of Toronto]].

Gracia has authored or edited over forty books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buffalo.edu/news/releases/2012/09/13686.html|title=UB Humanities Institute to Showcase Work of SUNY Distinguished Professor Jorge Gracia|date=|website=The University at Buffalo News Center|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|last1=Donovan|first1=Patricia|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His areas of specialization include Metaphysics/Ontology, Philosophical Historiography, Philosophy of Language/Hermeneutics, Ethnicity/Race/Nationality Issues, Hispanic/Latino Issues, Medieval/Scholastic Philosophy and  Hispanic/Latino/Latin-American Philosophy.  While Gracia's earlier work was primarily in the areas of Medieval Philosophy and Metaphysics, much of his recent work has focused on issues of race, ethnicity and identity.  His contributions to the philosophical study of race and ethnicity have been groundbreaking.  It is within this area that Gracia proposed his familial-historical view of ethnicity and his genetic common-bundle view of race.  These views of race and ethnicity have helped to shape the field and addressed many issues that previous theories had left unanswered.

Gracia was the founding chair of the [[American Philosophical Association|APA]] Committee for Hispanics in Philosophy, past president of the [[Society for Medieval and Renaissance Philosophy]], past president of the [[Society for Iberian and Latin American Thought]], past president of the [[American Catholic Philosophical Association]], and past president of the [[Metaphysical Society of America]].

== Education ==
Gracia studied architecture at [[University of Havana|Universidad de La Habana]] and also took classes at [[Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes "San Alejandro"|Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes San Alejandro]], both in [[Havana|Havana, Cuba]], for a year before coming to United States and earning a B.A. in philosophy at [[Wheaton College (Illinois)|Wheaton College (Ill.)]] in 1965.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~gracia/cv.html|title=Jorge J.E. Garcia (C.V.)|last=|first=|date=|website=Jorge J. E. Gracia (Personal Website)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Painting Borges'', he narrates how he changed his field of study from [[architecture]] to [[mathematics]] to [[English literature]] to [[philosophy]] because he became "enthralled by language" and "craved ... to know [its] secret."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/871961967|title=Painting Borges philosophy interpreting art interpreting literature|last=Garcia|first=Jorge J. E.|date=2012|publisher=SUNY Press|year=|isbn=9781438441795|location=|pages=xvi|oclc=871961967}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received his M.A. in philosophy from [[University of Chicago]] in 1966, M.S.L. (Licentiate in Mediaeval Studies) in philosophy from [[Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies]] in 1970, and Ph.D. in [[Medieval philosophy]] from [[University of Toronto]] in 1971. During his graduate studies he spent a year (1969-1970) at [[Institut d'Estudis Catalans]] for study and research.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Work==

===History of medieval philosophy===
Gracia has written extensively on the problem of individuation in the early Middle Ages.  Within this context, he has explored [[Boethius]] and his metaphysical and logical approaches to the problem of individuation. He has also dealt with the metaphysical views of [[Thierry of Chartres]], [[Gilbert de la Porrée|Gilbert of Potiers]], [[Peter Abailard]] and others. He wrote the first book on the development of the problem of individuation in the early Middle Ages, the period that goes from the 6th century to the 14th. In this book, he applied a new, analytic problems approach method to the history of medieval philosophy.

Gracia has studied and written on the philosophy of [[Thomas Aquinas]], focusing on Aquinas' Christian philosophy, his approach to universals, and his metaphysics of thought and existence.

===History of Spanish philosophy===
Gracia has explored the work of [[Francisco Suárez]], focusing on his metaphysics as well as the issues of individuation and good and evil.  He has also translated Suárez's Disputations V, X, and XI and published commentaries and editions of these.  He has also studied [[Ramon Llull]]'s work on metaphysics and individuation and written on [[José Ortega y Gasset]].

===Contemporary Latin American philosophy===
Gracia has published many articles on the work of Latin American philosophers and explored their work in terms of the impact it has had upon Latin America.  The research has also extended to the exploration of Latin American art and literature. He was a pioneer in this field. The anthology on Latin American philosophy he edited in the mid-1980s was the first work of its nature published in English by a philosopher.

===Philosophical historiography===
Gracia's work in this area has examined the concept of Hispanic philosophy and presented a historico-relational understanding of it. In addition, Gracia has described the origin of Hispanic philosophy in the 16th century.  He presented a historical account of discussions concerning the controversy about the nature of Latin-American philosophy and developed a historiographical model for the understanding of Hispanic thought.

Gracia has also focused on a systematic treatment of the main issues involved in philosophical historiography. He has dealt with such topics as the relation of philosophy to its history, the role of value judgments in historical accounts, the value of the history of philosophy for philosophy, the nature and role of texts and their interpretation in the history of philosophy, historiographical method, and the stages of development and progress of philosophical ideas. His book on the historiography of philosophy is the most comprehensive study of this topic in English.

===Metaphysics===
Gracia has published many works in the area of metaphysics.  He has devoted extensive time dealing with the metaphysical/ontological issues posed by categories.  In this work, Gracia has also offered a systematic analysis of the nature of metaphysics which provides an answer as to why metaphysics always recovers from the many attacks to which it has been subjected throughout its history.  Apart from a new conception of metaphysics and an explanation of the resilience of the discipline, Gracia presents an understanding of the nature and ontological status of categories, an analysis of the nature of reductionism and its role in philosophy, and a discussion and criticism of the main views concerning the nature of metaphysics developed in the history of philosophy. Gracia also distinguishes six fundamental issues in the metaphysics of individuality: intension, extension, ontological status, the principle of individuation, discernibility, and reference. He has taken new and controversial positions in all these topics.

===Hermeneutics===
Gracia has written on the logical and epistemological dimensions of a theory of textuality which takes into account the relevant views of both analytic and Continental thinkers and also of some major historical figures. He has given a logical analysis of the notion of text resulting from a definition that serves as the basis for the distinctions subsequently drawn between texts on the one hand and language, artifacts, art objects, and works on the other; and for the classification of texts according to modality and function. He has used his conclusions in this area to solve the various epistemological issues which have been raised about texts by philosophers of language, semioticians, hermeneuticists, literary critics, semanticists, aestheticians, and historiographers. Gracia has provided an ontological characterization of texts; it explores the issues raised by the identity of various texts; and it presents a view of the identity and function of authors and audiences and of their relations to texts.

===Philosophy of religion===
Gracia has written a philosophical understanding of the conditions that must be satisfied by the interpretation of texts which are regarded as revealed by religious communities. He has focused on the issues of revelation, interpretation, various kinds of hermeneutical views (authorial, audiencial, literary, sociological, and theological), definitive interpretations, and the relativity of interpretations. He has argued for the preeminence of theological interpretations, for the logical possibility but the factual difficulty of definitive interpretations of revelation, and for the relativity of, but not relativism in, these interpretations.   Gracia has also written on religious skepticism in Latin America.

===Race, ethnicity, and nationality===
Gracia has examined the nature of tradition and how a proper metaphysical understanding of this notion as a kind of action clarifies its various uses and helps us understand in turn how communication, the preservation of knowledge, and group identity take place. He has also published a systematic discussion of the notions of race, ethnicity, and nationality.  He has written on the metaphysical questions of "What is race?" and "What is ethnicity."  It is within this area that Gracia has proposed his familial-historical view of ethnicity and his genetic common-bundle view of race.  These views of race and ethnicity have helped to shape the field and addressed many issues that previous theories had left unanswered.

===Hispanic/Latinx Issues===
Gracia  published systematic discussions of social issues that affect Latinxs/Hispanics in American society.  As well, Gracia presents a familial/relational theory of Hispanic/Latinx identity.  In addition he discusses such topics as the nature of ethnicity, the proper name for Hispanics/Latinxs, the origin of Hispanic/Latinx identity, the role of mestizaje in Hispanic/Latinx identity, the history of discussions of Latin American identity in Latin America, and the situation of Hispanics/Latinxs in American philosophy today. Within this work Gracia takes into account recent research in various disciplines: anthropology, sociology, history, philosophy, literature, and Latinx studies. Gracia's book on Hispanic/Latinx identity as the first published book on this topic.

Gracia has also published a systematic discussion of the nature and possibility of the philosophical interpretation of art with respect to [[Carlos Estévez (artist)|Carlos Estévez]] work.  Gracia's work also includes writing on a number of Cuban American artists, writers, and philosophers.

'''Józef Maria Bocheński''' ([[Czuszów]], [[Congress Poland]], [[Russian Empire]], 30 August 1902 – 8 February 1995, [[Fribourg]], [[Switzerland]]) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[Dominican Order|Dominican]], [[logician]] and [[philosopher]].

==Life==
After taking part in the 1920 campaign against [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]], he took up legal studies in [[Lwów]], then studied economics in [[Poznań]]. Bocheński earned a doctorate in philosophy (he studied in [[Fribourg]] in Switzerland, 1928–31).  He was also an [[List of people associated with the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas|alumnus]] of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] in [[Rome]] where he studied [[Sacred Theology]] from 1931 to 1934 earning a doctorate in Sacred Theology. Bocheński was a professor of logic at the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|''Angelicum'']] until 1940.

During [[World War II]] he served as chaplain to Polish forces during the 1939 [[invasion of Poland]], was taken [[prisoner of war]], escaped the Germans and reached [[Rome]]. He joined the Polish Army and served as chaplain first in [[France]], then in [[England]]. He fought as a soldier in 1944 in the Italian campaign of the [[Polish II Corps]] at [[Monte Cassino]].

In 1945 he received the chair in the history of twentieth-century philosophy at the [[University of Fribourg]] (of which he was [[Rector (academia)|rector]] in 1964-66); he founded and ran the Institute of Eastern Europe there, and published the journal ''Studies in Soviet Thought'' and a book series concerned with the foundations of Marxist philosophy (''Sovietica'').

Bocheński served as consultant to several governments: West Germany (under [[Konrad Adenauer]]), South Africa, the United States, Argentina, and Switzerland.

Before 1989 none of his works were published officially in [[Poland]].

==Cracow Circle==
Bocheński is perhaps the most famous exponent of the [[Cracow Circle Thomism]], which has been called "the most significant expression of Catholic thought between the two World Wars."&lt;ref&gt;http://segr-did2.fmag.unict.it/~polphil/polphil/Cracow/Cracow.html  Accessed 15 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The Circle was founded by a group of [[Analytical Thomism|philosophers]] and theologians that, in distinction from traditional neo-Thomism, embraced modern formal logic and applied it to traditional Thomist philosophy and theology.&lt;ref&gt;http://segr-did2.fmag.unict.it/~polphil/polphil/Cracow/Cracow.html  Accessed 15 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by the logical clarity of Aquinas, members of the Circle held both philosophy and theology to contain "propositions with truth-values…a structured body of propositions connected in meaning and subject matter, and linked by logical relations of compatibility and incompatibility, entailment etc."  "The Cracow Circle set about investigating and where possible improving this logical structure with the most advanced logical tools available at the time, namely those of modern mathematical logic, then called ‘logistic’." &lt;ref&gt;" Bocheński and Balance: System and History in Analytic Philosophy", Peter Simons, Studies in East European Thought 55 (2003), 281–297, Reprinted in: Edgar Morscher, Otto Neumaier and Peter Simons, Ein Philosoph mit "Bodenhaftung": Zu Leben und Werk von Joseph M. Bocheński. St.Augustin: Academia, 2011, 61–79&lt;/ref&gt;  Other members of the Circle included [[:pl:Jan Salamucha|Jan Salamucha]] and Jan F. Drewnowski.

== The logical hexagon for the square of opposition ==
[[Robert Blanché]] quoted a passage of Bochenski’s ''Formale Logik'' in ''Structure intellectuelles'' (1966, 39): "Hindu logic knows of three logical propositions and not the four of western logic. For it ''Some S are P'' does not signify ''Some S at least are P'' but ''Some S are P but not all''." This passage shows that Indian tradition explicitly speaks of the existence of partial quantity, the third quantity to be considered along with totality apprehended by A the universal affirmative of the square, and zero quantity apprehended by E the universal negative of the square. To the two universals A and E entertaining a relationship of contrariety, one should add the third contrary constituted by the double negation of the first two. As the subcontrary I contradicts E and the subcontrary O contradicts A, the logical proposition apprehending partial quantity can be represented by the conjunction of I and O : I &amp; O. In Blanché’s [[logical hexagon]] this conjunction is symbolized by the letter Y. Many scholars{{who|date=July 2014}} think that the logical [[square of opposition]], representing four values, should be replaced by the logical hexagon, which has the power to express more relations of opposition.

'''Khwaja Shamsuddin Azeemi''' ({{lang-ur|خواجه شمس الدين عظيمي}}; born 17 October 1927) is a Pakistani scholar of international repute in the field of [[spiritualism]]. He is the current head of the [[Azeemiyya]] Sufi order, presenting [[spiritualism]] in a modern and scientific way.&lt;ref name="Spiritual"&gt;{{cite book |last=Azeemi|first=Khawaja Shamsuddin|title=Spiritual Prayer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, he has written numerous books on the subject of spirituality or [[Muraqaba]] and is the chief editor of the monthly ''Roohani Digest'' in [[Karachi, Pakistan]]. Moreover, he has established a chain of fifty-three [[Muraqaba]] halls worldwide.&lt;ref name="Azeemia"&gt;{{cite web |title=Khwaja Shamsuddin Azeemi|url=http://azeemiasilsila.org/khwaja_shamsuddin.php|date=|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

===Family===
Khwaja Shamsuddin's father was Haji Anis Ahmed Ansari and mother's name was Umat-ur-Rehman. He is descended from [[Abu Ayyub al-Ansari]], a close companion of the [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] and his host during Muhammad's migration to [[Madinah]].&lt;ref name="Foundation"&gt;{{cite web |title=Khawaja Shamsuddin Azeemi|url=https://www.azeemiafoundation.org/khawaja.htm|date=|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Khwaja Shamsuddin lived with and served his spiritual master [[Qalander Baba Auliya]] for sixteen years until his passing away in 1979. During this long companionship, Qalandar Baba Auliya prepared his able student to enable transference of his spiritual knowledge to him. When this spiritual teacher was about to pass away he blew three times on Khwaja Shamsuddin's forehead and uttered "You are to take my place and run my [[silsila]] (Sufi Order) after me… the people who run a mission work obsessively". Khwaja Shamsuddin azeemi acted upon the advice of his spiritual master and promoted his mission worldwide. As a result, the [[Azeemiyya]] Sufi order is now a well-known and respected ssilsila across the globe.&lt;ref name="Foundation" /&gt;

{{Hindu philosophy}}
'''Kundalini yoga''' ({{IAST|kuṇḍalinī-yoga}}) is a school of yoga that is influenced by [[Shaktism]] and [[Tantra]] schools of [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dlshq.org/download/kundalini.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It derives its name through a focus on awakening [[kundalini energy]] through regular practice of [[mantra]], [[tantra]], [[yantra]], [[yoga]]
or [[meditation]].&lt;ref name="YJ Spotlight"&gt;{{cite web|title=Spotlight on Kundalini Yoga|url=http://www.yogajournal.com/basics/1336|publisher=Yoga Journal|accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Swami Sivananda Radha 2004, pp 13-15"&gt;Swami Sivananda Radha,  2004, pp. 13, 15&lt;/ref&gt; Kundalini yoga is often identified as the most dangerous form of yoga because of the involvement of subtle energies.&lt;ref&gt;https://isha.sadhguru.org/yoga/yoga_articles_yoga/kundalini-yoga-beneficial-or-dangerous/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

===Name===
What has become known as "Kundalini yoga" in the 20th century, after a technical term particular to this tradition, is actually a synthesis of many traditions which may include haṭha yoga techniques (such as [[Bandha (Yoga)|bandha]], [[pranayama]], and [[asana]]), Patañjali's kriya yoga (consisting of self-discipline, self-study, and devotion to God), tantric visualization and meditation techniques of ''laya yoga'' (known as ''samsketas''),&lt;ref&gt;Mallinson, James. "Dattātreya's Discourse on Yoga". 24 June 2013. accessed 25 October 2015. https://www.academia.edu/3773137/Translation_of_the_Datt%C4%81treyayoga%C5%9B%C4%81stra_the_earliest_text_to_teach_ha%E1%B9%ADhayoga . "The Yoga of Dissolution (layayoga) happens as a result of the dissolution of the mind by means of esoteric techniques (saṃketas). Ādinātha has taught eighty million esoteric techniques."&lt;/ref&gt; and other techniques oriented towards the 'awakening of kundalini'.&lt;ref&gt;http://ewawinberg.blogspot.com/2012/12/kundalini-yoga-vs-hatha-yoga.html&lt;/ref&gt; Laya may refer both to techniques of yoga, and (like Raja Yoga) its effect of "absorption" of the individual into the cosmic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Woodroffe | first=John | title='The Serpent Power'.

The Shiva Samhita describes the qualified yogi as practicing 'the four yogas' to achieve kundalini awakening while lesser students may resort solely to one technique or another: "Mantra Yoga and Hatha Yoga. Laya Yoga is the third. The fourth is Raja Yoga. It is free from duality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Mallinson | first=James | date=2007-01-01 | title=The Shiva Samhita: A Critical Edition and an English Translation (Kindle Locations 100-101) and (Kindle Locations 799-825) | publisher=YogaVidya.com | edition=Kindle | quote=As Hatha Yoga, originally the preserve of the unorthodox Nathas, grew in popularity in the medieval period, the orthodox Shaivas sought to incorporate it within their soteriology, and thus the Shiva Samhita may be an example of this appropriation." and "He is sure to achieve perfection in three years.

The Sanskrit adjective ''{{IAST|kuṇḍalin}}'' means "circular, annular". It does occur as a noun for "a snake" (in the sense "coiled", as in "forming ringlets") in the 12th-century ''[[Rajatarangini]]'' chronicle (I.2). ''{{IAST|Kuṇḍa}}'', a noun with the meaning "bowl, water-pot" is found as the name of a [[Nāga|Naga]] in [[Mahabharata]] 1.4828.
The feminine  ''kuṇḍalī'' has the meaning of "ring, bracelet, coil (of a rope)" in Classical Sanskrit, and is used as the name of a "serpent-like" [[Shakti]] in [[Tantrism]] as early as the 11th century, in the ''Śaradatilaka''.&lt;ref&gt;André Padoux, ''Vāc: The Concept of the Word in Selected Hindu Tantras'', SUNY Press, 1990, 124-136.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept is adopted as  ''kuṇḍalniī'' as a technical term into [[Hatha yoga]] in the 15th century and becomes widely used in the [[Yoga Upanishad]]s by the 16th century.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

===Hatha yoga===
{{further|Hatha Yoga Pradipika|Yoga-Kundalini Upanishad}}
The ''Yoga-Kundalini'' [[Upanishad]]  is listed in the [[Muktika]] canon of 108 Upanishads. Since this canon was fixed in the year 1656, it is known that the ''Yoga-Kundalini'' Upanishad was compiled in the first half of the 17th century at the latest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rishikesh Yogis: Kundalini Yoga Teacher Training in India|url=https://www.rishikeshyogisyogshala.org/what-is-kundalini-yoga/|accessdate=12 Oct 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Upanishad more likely dates to the 16th century,{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} as do other Sanskrit texts which treat ''kundalini'' as a technical term in tantric yoga, such as the ''Ṣaṭ-cakra-nirūpana'' and the ''Pādukā-pañcaka''. These latter texts were translated in 1919 by [[John Woodroffe]] as ''The Serpent Power: The Secrets of Tantric and Shaktic Yoga''. He identifies the process of involution and its techniques in these texts as a particular form of Tantrik ''Laya Yoga''.&lt;ref&gt;Woodroffe, John. "The Serpent Power". Illustrations, Tables, Highlights and Images by Veeraswamy Krishnara. p. 11. Accessed 25 October 2015. http://www.bhagavadgitausa.com/Serpent%20Power%20Complete.pdf "when dealing with the practice of Yoga, the rule is that things dissolve into that from which they originate, and the Yoga process here described is such dissolution (Laya)"&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Yoga-Kundalini Upanishad|Yogakundali]]'' and the ''[[Yogatattva Upanishad|Yogatattva]]'' are yoga texts related to the school of Hatha yoga and Mantra yoga.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, Gerald James (2008). ''The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies: Yoga: India's philosophy of meditation''. Motilal Banarsidass. {{ISBN|978-81-208-3349-4}}, p. 476, 615-617&lt;/ref&gt; They are part of a tendency of [[syncretism]] combining the tradition of yoga with other schools of Hindu philosophy during the 15th and 16th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yoga Teacher Training in Rishikesh|url=https://www.rishikeshyogisyogshala.org|accessdate=15 Oct 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Yoga-Kundalini'' Upanishad itself consists of three short chapters; it begins by stating that Chitta (consciousness) is controlled by Prana, and it's controlled by moderate food, postures and ''Shakti-Chala'' (I.1-2). Verses I.3-6 explain the concepts of moderate food and concept, and verse I.7 introduces ''Kundalini'' as the name of the ''Shakti'' under discussion:
:I.7. The Sakti (mentioned above) is only Kundalini. A wise man should take it up from its place (Viz., the navel, upwards) to the middle of the eyebrows. This is called Sakti-Chala. 
:I.8. In practising it, two things are necessary, Sarasvati-Chalana and the restraint of Prana (breath). Then through practice, Kundalini (which is spiral) becomes straightened.&lt;ref&gt;trans. K. Narayanasvami Aiyar [http://www.astrojyoti.com/yogakundaliniupanishad.htm Astrojyoti.com], based on a translation first published in 1891 in ''The Theosophist'', Volume 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern reception===
Although kundalini developed as a part of tantra side-by-side with hatha yoga through a process of syncretism, [[Swami Nigamananda]] (d. 1935) taught a form of ''laya yoga'' which he insisted was not part of Hatha yoga.

Swami Sivananda (1935) introduced many readers to "Kundalini Yoga" with his book on the subject in 1935. This book has in-depth details about Kundalini Yoga&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kundalini Yoga |url=http://www.dlshq.org/download/kundalini.htm |website= |accessdate=15 September 2018 |work= |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swami Sivananda's book combines laya teachings from older sources including the Hathapradipika and Satcakranirupdepth details about Kundalini Yogaana.&lt;ref&gt;Swami Sivananda (4th ed. 2007), page 32&lt;/ref&gt; Together with other currents of [[Hindu revivalism]] and [[Neo-Hinduism]], Kundalini Yoga became popular in 1960s to 1980s western [[counterculture]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==== Yogi Bhajan  ====

In 1968, [[Harbhajan Singh Khalsa]], also known as Yogi Bhajan, introduced his own brand of kundalini yoga into the United States, "Kundalini Yoga as taught by Yogi Bhajan". Yogi Bhajan founded the "[[3HO|Healthy, Happy, Holy Organization]]" (3HO) as a teaching organization. Yogi Bhajan took yogic postures and techniques, attached them to Tantric theories and Sikh mantras, synthesizing a new form of 'Kundalini' yoga. "When placed alongside the teachings of Swami Dhirendra Brahmachari and Maharaj Virsa Singh, it becomes strikingly apparent that at least in its earliest years, Yogi Bhajan's Kundalini yoga was not a distinct practice, but essentially a combination of yogic mechanics learned from the former and the Sikh-derived mantras (Ik Ongkaar, Sat Naam, Sri Waheguru) and chanting from the latter," Deslippe writes.&lt;ref&gt;https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6r63q6qn%20-%20page-15&lt;/ref&gt; But Virsa Singh rejected Bhajan’s Kundalini yoga. Yoga was not a part of the Gobind Sadan spiritual path. And a power struggle ensued over who would win control of the new American followers.&lt;ref name="sikhfreepress.org"&gt;http://sikhfreepress.org/headlines/2667/american-yogis-distort-sikh-scripture&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional Sikhs use quotations by Bhai Gurdas, whose "Vaaraa," or "Ballads," were considered by Guru Arjan as a key to understanding the concepts of the Guru Granth as saying, wherever [[Guru Nanak]] went and debated the futility of yoga, the yogis gave up their yogic paths. The yogis of "Gorakhmata," meaning "Wisdom of Gorakhnatha," the founder of Hatha yoga, converted to the path of Guru Nanak, and also changed the name of their ancient center to "Nanakmata," meaning "Wisdom of Guru Nanak," known today as Gurdwara Sri Nanakmata Sahib.
Guru Nanak never practiced yoga, and neither did any of the following Gurus, their Sikhs or the Khalsa. Yoga is unmistakably refuted in the Guru Granth.&lt;ref name="sikhfreepress.org"/&gt;

Disciples of Harbhajan Singh (Yogi Bhajan) claim that while Yoga practice and philosophy are generally considered a part of Hindu culture, Kundalini Yoga as taught by Yogi Bhajan is founded on the principles of [[Sikh Dharma]]. While adhering to the three pillars of [[Patanjali]]'s kriya yoga system: discipline (''tapaḥ''), spiritual study (''svādhyāya'') and devotion to God (''iśvarapraṇidāna'') (PYS, II:1), Kundalini Yoga as taught by Yogi Bhajan does not condone extremes of [[asceticism]] or [[renunciation]]. He encouraged his students to marry, establish businesses, and be fully engaged in society.  Rather than worshiping God, Yogi Bhajan's teachings encourage students to train their mind to experience God.&lt;ref name=Gursikh&gt;{{cite book |first=Guru Fatha Singh|last=Khalsa |title=The Essential Gursikh Yogi: The Yoga and Yogis in the Past, Present and Future of Sikh Dharma |location=Toronto|publisher=Monkey Minds Press |year=2008 |page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yogi Bhajan sometimes referred to the Sikh lifestyle as ''[[Raja Yoga]]'', the yoga of living detached, yet fully engaged in the world.&lt;ref name=Gursikh /&gt;{{rp|pages=188–89, 210–12, 222–39}}

In respect of the rigor of his teachings, Yogi Bhajan claims kinship with other 20th century Sikh sadhu saints, such as Sant Baba Attar Singh, Sant Baba Nand Singh, and Bhai Randhir Singh.&lt;ref name=Gursikh /&gt;{{rp|200–208}}

Yogi Bhajan{{'s}} version of Kundalini Yoga has continued to grow in influence and popularity largely in the Americas, Europe, South Africa, Togo, Australia, and East Asia, with the training of many thousands of teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kundaliniresearchinstitute.org/teachertraining.htm |title=Yoga As Taught by Yogi Bhajan - Located in beautiful Espanola, New Mexico |publisher=Kundalini Research Institute |date=1989-06-22 |accessdate=2014-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is popularized through books and videos, teachers such as [[Gurmukh (yoga teacher)|Gurmukh]], research by [[David Shannahoff-Khalsa]], [[Dharma Singh Khalsa]], [[Sat Bir Singh Khalsa]] and others, and through the publicity accorded it by various celebs such as [[Madonna (entertainer)]], [[Demi Moore]], [[Cindy Crawford]], [[Russell Brand]], [[Al Pacino]], [[David Duchovny]], and [[Miranda Kerr]] who are known, or have been known, to practice it.

== Principles and methodology ==
''Kundalini'' is the term for "a [[Vitalism|spiritual energy or life force]] located at the base of the spine",  conceptualized as a coiled-up serpent. The practice of Kundalini yoga is supposed to arouse the sleeping Kundalini Shakti from its coiled base through the 6 [[chakras]], and penetrate the 7th chakra, or crown. 
This energy is said to travel along the ida (left), pingala (right) and central, or sushumna [[Nadi (yoga)|nadi]] - the main channels of pranic energy in the body.&lt;ref&gt;Swami Sivananda  (4th ed. 2007) page 12&lt;/ref&gt; A recent article has suggested that the process may be mediated by [[vagus nerve]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boloji.com/index.cfm?md=Content&amp;sd=Articles&amp;ArticleID=49653 Kundalini and Patanjali Yoga Sutras]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kundalini energy is technically explained as being sparked during yogic breathing when [[prana]] and [[Prana#The Five Prāṇas|apana]] blends at the 3rd chakra (navel center) at which point it initially drops down to the 1st and 2nd chakras before traveling up to the spine to the higher centers of the brain to activate the ''golden cord'' - the connection between the [[pituitary]] and [[pineal]] glands - and penetrate the 7 chakras.&lt;ref name="bhajan176"&gt;Yogi Bhajan, The Aquarian Teacher, KRI International Teacher Training in Kundalini Yoga as taught by Yogi Bhajan, Kundalini Research Institute, 4th Edition, 2007, pages 176-179&lt;/ref&gt;
	 	
Borrowing and integrating the highest forms from many different approaches, Kundalini Yoga can be understood as a tri-fold approach of [[Bhakti yoga]] for devotion, Shakti yoga for power, and [[Raja yoga]] for mental power and control. Its purpose through the daily practice of [[kriyas]] and meditation in [[sadhana]] are described a practical technology of human consciousness for humans to achieve their total creative potential. With the practice of Kundalini Yoga one is thought able to liberate oneself from one's Karma and to realize one's Dharma (Life Purpose).&lt;ref&gt;Yogi Bhajan, The Aquarian Teacher, KRI International Teacher Training in Kundalini Yoga as taught by Yogi Bhajan, Kundalini Research Institute, 4th Edition, 2007, page 20&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practice ==
The practice of kriyas and meditations in Kundalini Yoga are designed to raise complete body awareness to prepare the body, [[nervous system]], and mind to handle the energy of Kundalini rising. The majority of the physical postures focus on navel activity, activity of the spine, and selective pressurization of body points and meridians. Breath work and the application of bandhas (3 yogic locks) aid to release, direct and control the flow of Kundalini energy from the lower centers to the higher energetic centers.&lt;ref&gt;Yogi Bhajan, The Aquarian Teacher, KRI International Teacher Training in Kundalini Yoga as taught by Yogi Bhajan, Kundalini Research Institute, 4th Edition, 2007, page 177&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the many kriyas, meditations and practices of Kundalini Yoga, a simple breathing technique of alternate nostril breathing (left nostril, right nostril) is taught as a method to cleanse the ''nadis'', or subtle channels and pathways, to help awaken Kundalini energy.&lt;ref&gt;Swami Sivananda (4th ed. 2007) page 23&lt;/ref&gt;

Sovatsky (1998) adapts a developmental and evolutionary perspective in his interpretation of Kundalini Yoga. That is, he interprets Kundalini Yoga as a catalyst for psycho-spiritual growth and bodily maturation. According to this interpretation of yoga, ''the body bows itself into greater maturation [...], none of which should be considered mere stretching exercises''.&lt;ref&gt;Sovatsky, Stuart (1998) ''Words from the Soul: Time, East/West Spirituality, and Psychotherapeutic Narrative'', Suny Series in Transpersonal and Humanistic Psychology, New York: State University of New York Press, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Her book ''Respect, Plurality, and Prejudice'' combined [[critical theory]] with [[psychoanalysis]] and [[psychosocial]] studies, examining the  underlying unconscious forces and structures that make up the phenomena of [[xenophobia]], [[Antisemitism]], [[Islamophobia]], [[homophobia]] and [[sexism]]. It provides an overview of how social prejudices, and the discrimination and violence that often tend to accompany the latter, come into being. Moreover, It argues that in order to fully understand how a complex phenomenon such as [[prejudice]] works, we need to alter our traditional Western philosophical understanding of the subject as a supposedly fully rational, autonomous and individual agent. Auestad argues that we need a more situated and relational understanding of subjectivity and the subject, as prejudice and acts of discrimination always take place  in  a  contextualized setting  between subjects whose thoughts and actions influence each other.&lt;ref name=rpp/&gt;

Auestad has also written about the rise of nationalism in  European countries, both in terms of its expression in extreme far-right groups and in the context of everyday political language and policy.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, C.  (2015) The Play of Political Culture, Emotion and Identity. Palgrave Macmillan, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Svendsen, S. H. B.  (2015) Feeling at Loss: Affect, Whiteness and Masculinity in the Immideate Aftermath of Norway's Terror, in: Affectivity and Race: Studies from Nordic Contexts. Ashgate, pp. 133-150&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nbp/&gt;

Auestad suggested that psychoanalysis can be used to think about the invisible and subtle processes of power over symbolic representation, for example, in the context of stereotyping and dehumanization, and posed the question of what forces govern the states of affairs that determine who is an 'I' and who is an 'it' in the public sphere.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, K. (2015) Psychosocial Studies. An introduction,  London/New York, Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

She founded and runs the international and interdisciplinary conference series Psychoanalysis and Politics http://www.psa-pol.org , which aims to address how contemporary political issues may be analyzed through [[psychoanalytic theory]] and vice versa – how political phenomena may reflect back on psychoanalytic thinking.

'''Mary Farkas''' (1911—June 7, 1992) was the director of the [[First Zen Institute of America]] (FZIA), running the center's administrative functions for many years following the death of her teacher ([[Sokei-an]]) in 1945.&lt;ref name="tricycle"&gt;Tricycle&lt;/ref&gt; Though she was not a teacher of [[Zen Buddhism]] in any traditional sense of the word, she did help to carry on the lineage of Sokei-an and also was editor of the FZIA's journal, ''Zen Notes'', starting with Volume 1 in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Stirling 2006, pg. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, she also edited books about Sokei-an, i.e. "''The Zen Eye''" and "''Zen Pivots''." Through her transcriptions of his talks, the institute was able to continue on the lineage without having a formal teacher (Sokei-an left no [[Dharma heir]]).&lt;ref name="keller"&gt;Skinner Keller, 638&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thakurartha Devadithya Guardiyawasam Lindamulage Nalin Kumara de Silva ''' ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: නලින් ද සිල්වා; 20 October 1944) is a Sri Lankan philosopher &lt;ref&gt;http://www.vidusara.com/2011/07/27/readers1.html&lt;/ref&gt; , a scientist{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} and a political analyst. He was a Professor in the Department of Mathematics, a Member of University Grant Commission and the Dean of the faculty of Science at the [[University of Kelaniya]], Sri Lanka.

De Silva has openly stated that the so-called 'objective scientific method' is a lie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=De Silva|first=Nalin|title=The importance of learning English/ Mathematics – V|url=http://www.island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article-details&amp;page=article-details&amp;code_title=20138|publisher=The Island}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chemical Arsenic and other Arsenics|url=http://epaper.divaina.com/index.php?option=com_flippingbook&amp;view=book&amp;id=245&amp;page=1|newspaper=The Sunday Divaina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011 he stated that information regarding presence of Arsenic in water claiming that the cause of Rajarata Chronic Kidney Disease had been given to him by the god "Natha".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Devivaru, Arsenic and Science|url=http://www.srilankaguardian.org/2011/06/devivaru-arsenic-and-science.html|newspaper=Sri Lanka Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sri Lanka Association for the Advancement of Science, an organisation in which De Silva claims lifelong membership, has said that they consider it "extremely unfortunate that the Dean of a Science Faculty should make it his publicly stated aim to run down science and bring it into disrepute.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=SLAAS|title=SLAAS refutes Arsenic claims|url=http://www.dailynews.lk/2011/07/08/news41.asp|publisher=The Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the presence of Arsenic was verified in water and vegetation, and the source was found to be agrochemical fertilizers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Charita|first=Wijeratne|title=Arsenic or not pesticides are deadly|url=http://www.island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article-details&amp;page=article-details&amp;code_title=29782|publisher=The Island|accessdate=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ockersz|first=Lynne|title=Arsenic in water placing 'whole nation at risk' says scientis|url=http://www.island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article-details&amp;page=article-details&amp;code_title=20846|publisher=The Island|accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nalin de Silva.jpg|left|upright|thumb|273px|Professor Nalin de Silva in 2014.]]

=== Constructive Relativism===
Nalin de Silva was formally a member of the Marxist Trotskyite [[Lanka Sama Samaja Party]] and the [[Nava Sama Samaja Party]], and as a marxist studying both disciplines he intensively began to question the foundations of both [[Marxism]] and science. As a result, in 1986, he wrote ''Mage Lokaya'' (My World), criticizing the basis of the established western system of knowledge, and its propagation, which he refers as "domination throughout the world".He explained in this book that mind independent reality is impossible and knowledge is not found but constructed.

This has further evolved into a study of [[Epistemology]] &amp; [[Ontology]], and in the process he has introduced and developed the concept of "Constructive Relativism"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kalaya.org/npe051127.html&lt;/ref&gt; as the basis on which knowledge is constructed relative to the sense organs, culture and the mind completely based on [[Avidyā (Buddhism)|Avidya]]. Though he was identified as a representative of "Jathika Chinthanaya" an idea proposed by [[Gunadasa Amarasekara]] based on national thought concept of [[Erich Fromm]], Nalin de Silva's concept Chinthanaya is a different epistemological concept.&lt;ref&gt;http://www1.kalaya.org/2013/05/blog-post_1036.html &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arsenic Controversy ===
The Rajarata Chronic Kidney Disease (RCKD) has been an ailment prevalent in the [[North Central Province, Sri Lanka|North Central Province of Sri Lanka]] for several decades. In 2010 a team of scientists headed by Prof. Priyani Paranagama, Head of the Chemistry Department at Kelaniya University, conducted a study to find the cause of the disease. The team was advised by Prof. Nalin de Silva, Dean of the Faculty of Science, Kelaniya University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Arsenic is attributed to kidney ailment in North Central Province|url=http://www.itnnews.lk/?p=26155|newspaper=ITN News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team presented their findings in June 2011. They stated that they had found high concentrations of [[arsenic]] in drinking water, vegetation, rice and other samples in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fernando|first=Manjula|title=Key to mystery killer disease found|url=http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2011/06/12/fea11.asp|newspaper=The Sunday Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team however refused to release their data to the public raising questions about their methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Furore over arsenic shakes agri sector|url=http://www.nation.lk/2011/06/19/newsfe10.htm|newspaper=The Nation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their finding were followed by allegations that the arsenic was being introduced to the system through foreign pesticides and fertilizers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=High levels of arsenic in pesticides|url=http://print.dailymirror.lk/opinion1/46604.html|newspaper=The Daily Mirror}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As this statement caused a huge uproar in the agricultural sector in Sri Lanka, the Industrial Technology Institute stated that they had used [[Atomic absorption spectroscopy|Hydride Generation Atomic Absorption Spectrometry]] on rice samples which showed no high levels of arsenic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=No Arsenic found in Sri Lankan Local Rice – ITI|url=http://news.lk/home/18346-no-arsenic-found-in-sri-lankan-local-rice-iti|newspaper=Government Information Department – Sri Lanka}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ITI study also found that in samples of 28 different pesticides only 3 showed any signs of arsenic, and even then not in the concentrations that De Silva's team alleged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Furore over arsenic shakes agri sector|url=http://www.nation.lk/2011/06/19/newsfe10.htm|newspaper=The Nation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kelaniya University team stated that they had used new methods to locate the Arsenic in the samples they collected but did not feel a need to submit their findings for peer-review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=SLAAS Statement|title=SLAAS refutes Arsenic claims|url=http://www.dailynews.lk/2011/07/08/news41.asp|publisher=The Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Silva stated that they did not publish their results in a "so-called peer reviewed journal due to our concern regarding the authorship of the paper as the original idea was given by 'samyak drshtika devivaru'  also known as [[Deva (Buddhism)|Devas]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=De Silva|first=Nalin|title=Statement by SLAAS on Arsenic studies|url=http://www.island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article-details&amp;page=article-details&amp;code_title=29428|newspaper=The Island}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the authenticity of the findings made by the University of Kelaniya team were questioned by other scientists De Silva stated that the god "Natha" had first told them about the arsenic through a mystic.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The merit (pina) in this regard should go to the "samyak drshtika devivaru" who first told that Arsenic is present in Rajarata drinking water and later revealed to us that Arsenic which is not found naturally in Sri Lanka has found its way to the wells and the wewas in Rajarata through Agrochemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Devivaru, Arsenic and Science|url=http://www.srilankaguardian.org/2011/06/devivaru-arsenic-and-science.html|newspaper=Sri Lanka Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It's simply like this. We can see professors. Professors cannot see Arsenic. We cannot see gods. Gods can see Arsenic. I like this because there is certain symmetry in it... I know very well that the so-called objective scientific method is a lie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=De Silva|first=Nalin|title=Chemical Arsenic and other Arsenics|url=http://epaper.divaina.com/index.php?option=com_flippingbook&amp;view=book&amp;id=245&amp;page=1|newspaper=The Sunday Divaina|date=15/052011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dr Paranagama too has stood by De Silva and defended their methods. She said that they had first been told of the Arsenic by the wife of "a university lecturer who had developed her mental faculties to communicate with a higher being", but then used scientific methods to deduce it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Weerasekera|first=Mangala|title=Scientists say Gods and tests helped detect arsenic in agrochemicals|url=http://sundaytimes.lk/110703/News/nws_12.html|newspaper=The Sunday Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sri Lanka Association for the Advancement of Science released a statement in July 2011 questioning the validity of the findings and the process and individuals involved in the study. Their statement laid the blame for the scandal firmly on Prof Nalin De Silva and they called for other scientists and researchers in the group to distance themselves from De Silva to have their work taken seriously {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}.

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is another serious issue which casts grave doubts on the credibility of the claims made by the Kelaniya group. The press has publicly identified as the leader of this group an individual, who despite holding a responsible position, professes a disdain for 'Western' science. He has publicly claimed supernatural revelations ('samyak drushtika devivaru') as the source of his group's information and even methods. While recognising that many scientists are deeply religious, the SLAAS wishes to state categorically that superstition and the supernatural have no place in science, and that scientific results inspired by such sources are highly suspect because of a probable bias on the part of the investigator.

We also note that other researchers in the group have yet to distance themselves from the eccentric statements of their leader, and they need to do this if they wish to be taken seriously as scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=SLAAS|title=SLAAS refutes Arsenic claims|url=http://www.dailynews.lk/2011/07/08/news41.asp|publisher=The Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Western Cultural Dominance ===
Prof. De Silva has also been a vocal opponent of what he calls western cultural dominance which he claims is in its final phase.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The western Christian modernity (WCM) is in the last phase of its hegemony and is acting like an insane person. It has no respect for the sovereignty of the other countries as has been exemplified from invasions, killings and supporting so called rebel groups in the countries in Asia and Africa. The USA that became the leader of WCM after the so called second world war is trying desperately to hold to the hegemony of WCM. After more than five hundred years of world domination WCM will have to leave the planet without making the people suffer more and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=De Silva|first=Nalin|title=Get ready for a humanitarian attack|url=http://www1.kalaya.org/2011/05/get-ready-for-humanitarian-attack.html|publisher=Kalaya}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Prof. De Silva has also referred to linguist and philosopher [[Noam Chomsky]] as a puppet of the Western Christian Modernity.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The west also maintains people such as Chomsky who is not known to the average American in order to show to the world that there is freedom for the intellectuals to champion their views heard more by the rest of the world than by the Americans themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=De Silva|first=Nalin|title=Get ready for a humanitarian attack|url=http://www1.kalaya.org/2011/05/get-ready-for-humanitarian-attack.html|publisher=Kalaya}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== About Science ===
Nalin de Silva who is influenced by [[Paul Feyerabend]] rejected the existence of scientific method and propose proliferation of sciences on various chinthanayas. &lt;ref&gt; Vidya Kathandara (Science Stories) Vidya Kathandara (Stories of Science) https://www.sarasavi.lk/Book/Vidya-Kathandara-9559170600 &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sacking from University of Colombo ===
De Silva was sacked from the University of Colombo for engaging in unlawful political activity within the campus. In subsequent letters he has described the event.
&lt;blockquote&gt;When I was in the University of Colombo, not the best place to fight the cultural pentagon, I was asked by the then Vice Chancellor [[G. L. Peiris]] why I was teaching Jathika Chinthanaya to a captive audience. The audience was not that captive and had the backing of the Vice Chancellor and some members of the senior staff, and of course the cultural pentagon. Nothing happened to the captive audience but soon I found that I was out of the University system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=De Silva| first= Pentagon|url=http://www.island.lk/2008/02/13/midweek2.html|publisher=The Island|title=Cultural Pentagon by Nalin de Silva}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Veemansaka Parshadaya ===
In 2008 the Veemansaka Parshadaya, a student organisation where De Silva is the treasurer and mentor started a campaign to ban western clothing in Kelaniya University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=De Silva|first=Nalin|title=Cultural Pentagon|url=http://www.island.lk/2008/02/13/midweek2.html|publisher=The Island}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Property law}}
The '''open mines doctrine''' is a term of [[real property]]. Under the open mines doctrine, depletion of [[natural resources]] constitutes [[Waste (law)|waste]] unless consumption of such resources constitutes normal use of the land, as in the case of a [[life estate]] in [[coal mine]] or a granite [[quarry]]. 

The [[life tenant]] cannot open the land to search for [[minerals]] and other natural resources, but if the quarries or mines were open before the tenant took the life estate, then it is not waste for the life tenant to continue their use.  Where the [[life tenant]] opens the land for new mines (i.e., voluntary waste) a remainderman can enjoin such.

The sale of harvestable [[crops]] does not constitute waste.

'''Paul Edwards''' (September 2, 1923 – December 9, 2004) was an Austrian-American moral [[philosopher]]. He was the editor-in-chief of MacMillan's eight-volume ''[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' from 1967, and lectured at [[New York University]], [[Brooklyn College]] and the [[New School for Social Research]] from the 1960s to the 1990s.&lt;ref name=Bayot&gt;Bayot, Jennifer. [http://wasm.us/Edwards%20Obit.pdf Edwards' obituary at wasm.us "Paul Edwards, Professor and Editor of Philosophy, dies at 81"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313170654/http://wasm.us/Edwards%20Obit.pdf |date=2013-03-13 }}, ''The New York Times'', December 16, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Edwards was born Paul Eisenstein in [[Vienna]] in 1923 to assimilated [[Jewish]] parents,&lt;ref name=Bayot/&gt; the youngest of three brothers. According to [[Peter Singer]], his upbringing was non-religious. He distinguished himself early on as a gifted student and was admitted to the [[Akademisches Gymnasium (Vienna)|Akademisches Gymnasium]], a prestigious Viennese high school. When [[Anschluss|Germany annexed Austria]] in 1938, Edwards was sent by his family to Scotland, later joining them in Melbourne, Australia, where the family name was changed to Edwards. He attended Melbourne High School, graduating as dux of the school, then studied philosophy at the [[University of Melbourne]], completing a B.A. and M.A.&lt;ref name=Singer&gt;Singer, Peter. "Philosopher insisted on clarity and rigour," ''The Age'' (Melbourne), January 14, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was awarded a scholarship to study in England in 1947, but on his way there, he stopped in New York and ended up staying there for the rest of his life, apart from a brief period teaching at the [[University of California in Berkeley]]. He was awarded his doctorate by [[Columbia University]] in 1951.&lt;ref name=Wreen1/&gt; While writing his doctoral thesis he contacted [[Bertrand Russell]] because he shared Russell's scepticism about religious belief. This led to a lasting friendship and a number of joint projects. Edwards collected Russell's writings on religion and published them in 1957, with an appendix on "the Bertrand Russell case," under the title ''[[Why I am not a Christian]]''.&lt;ref name=Singer/&gt; He taught at New York University until 1966, at Brooklyn College from then until 1986, and at the New School from the 1960s until 1999.&lt;ref name=Wreen1/&gt;

Edwards was characterized by Michael Wreen as "mixed one part analytic philosopher to one part ''philosophe''" with "a deep respect for science and common sense." His considerable influence on moral philosophy came from two works he edited, a very widely used introductory book he co-edited with [[Arthur Pap]] (''A modern introduction to philosophy'', 1965), and the famous ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', an eight-volume "massive Enlightenment work with notable analytic sensibility."&lt;ref name=Wreen2&gt;Wreen, Michael. "Edwards, Paul,"  in Ted Honderich (ed.). ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy''. Oxford University Press, 1955, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was one of the signers of the [[Humanist Manifesto II|Humanist Manifesto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II | title=Humanist Manifesto II | publisher=American Humanist Association | accessdate=October 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher [[Timothy Madigan]] wrote in an obituary: "Those who knew Edwards will always remember his erudition and his wicked sense of humour. [ ... ] Given Paul's own biting wit, it's not surprising that he so admired [[Voltaire]] and Russell. [ ... ] Never one to hide his own unbelief, he often commented that his two main goals were to demolish the influence of [[Heidegger]] and keep alive the memory of [[Wilhelm Reich]], the much-reviled psychoanalyst whose critiques of religion Edwards felt remained valid."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lehman.edu/deanhum/philosophy/BRSQ/05aug/society-news.htm "Tim Madigan remembers Paul Edwards (1923–2004)"]. In: The Bertrand Russell Society Quarterly, Issue Nr. 127, August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Edwards was also sympathetic to the Danish philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]], although he detested Kierkegaardian existentialist admirers such as Heidegger and [[William Barrett (philosopher)|William Barrett]] for confusing and conflating Kierkegaardian terminology.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Paul. (1971). ''Kierkegaard and the 'Truth' of Christianity''. Philosophy, 46, pp 89-108. doi:10.1017/S0031819100017150.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Encyclopedia of Philosophy==
Edwards was editor-in-chief of Macmillan's ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', published in 1967. With eight volumes and nearly 1,500 entries by over 500 contributors, it is one of the monumental works of twentieth century philosophy. Using his editorial prerogative, Edwards made sure that there were plentiful entries on atheism, materialism and related subjects (which is not surprising considering that such subjects would have been of interest to modern philosophers). He always remained "a fervent advocate of clarity and rigour in philosophical argument." When, after four decades, the ''Encyclopedia'' was revised by other editors for a new edition, Edwards told [[Peter Singer]] that he was "distressed that the revisions had diluted the philosophical message and had been too gentle on a lot of [[postmodernism|postmodern thought]]."&lt;ref name=Singer/&gt;

==Reincarnation==

Edwards was highly skeptical of claims regarding [[reincarnation]].&lt;ref&gt;Cogan, Robert. (1998). ''Critical Thinking: Step by Step''. University Press of America. pp. 202-203. {{ISBN|0-7618-1067-6}} "Edwards catalogs common sense objections which have been made against reincarnation. 1) How does a soul exist between bodies? 2) Tertullian's objection: If there is reincarnation, why are not babies born with the mental abilities of adults? 3) Reincarnation claims an infinite series of prior incarnations. Evolution teaches that there was a time when humans did not yet exist. So reincarnation is inconsistent with modern science. 4) If there is reincarnation, then what is happening when the population increases? 5) If there is reincarnation, then why do so few, if any people, remember past lives?... To answer these objections believers in reincarnation must accept additional assumptions... Acceptance of these silly assumptions, Edwards says, amounts to a crucifixion of one's intellect."&lt;/ref&gt; He was the author of the book ''Reincarnation: A Critical Examination'' (1996), which is notable for criticizing the cases collected by [[Ian Stevenson]]. The book has received positive reviews from academics.&lt;ref&gt;Dilley, Frank. B. (1997). ''Reincarnation: A Critical Examination by Paul Edwards''. ''International Journal for Philosophy of Religion''. Vol. 42, No. 1. pp. 61-63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell, Kenneth. (1998). ''Rationalism and Reincarnation [Review of Paul Edwards, Reincarnation]''. ''[[Russell: The Journal of Bertrand Russell Studies]]'' 18: 187-188. "Why should Edwards spend time on such arguments when, to rationalists, they are patently absurd or without empirical foundation? Because there is widespread belief in them... The book is salutary in revealing the persistence of nonsense and the persisting need for education, logic and good sense."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barry Beyerstein]] wrote that "Skeptics who follow my recommendation and read ''Reincarnation: A Critical Examination'' will derive much ammunition for arguing not only with reincarnationists but with 'near-death experience' aficionados and afterlife enthusiasts of other stripes as well."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/a_cogent_consideration_of_the_case_for_karma_and_reincarnation|title=A Cogent Consideration of the Case for Karma (and Reincarnation) - CSI|website=www.csicop.org|access-date=2017-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher and [[parapsychology|parapsychologist]] [[Stephen E. Braude]] criticized the arguments presented in Edwards book, saying, "Apparently Edwards did not realize that his condescending and allegedly hard-nosed attack on reincarnationists was as deeply (and inevitably) metaphysical as the view he opposed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Braude|first=Stephen E.|date=July 2005|title=Personal Identity and Postmortem Survival|url=|journal=Social Philosophy and Policy|language=en|volume=22|issue=2|pages=244|doi=|issn=1471-6437|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wilhelm Reich==
Edwards said that when he arrived in New York in 1947 [[Wilhelm Reich]] was "the talk of the town" and that for years he and his friends regarded Reich as "something akin to a messiah": "There was ... a widespread feeling that Reich had an original and penetrating insight into the troubles of the human race."&lt;ref name=greatness&gt;Edwards, Paul. "The Greatness of Wilhelm Reich," ''The Humanist, March/April 1974, reproduced in Charles A. Garfield (ed.). ''Rediscovery of the Body. A Psychosomatic View of Life and Death.''Dell 1977, pp. 41-50.&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty years later, as editor-in-chief of the ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy,'' Edwards wrote an article about Reich, comprising 11 pages as compared to the four devoted to Freud. He pointed out what is of interest to philosophers in Reich: his views concerning the origin of religious and metaphysical needs, the relation between the individual and society and the possibility of social progress, and, above all, the implications of his psychiatry for certain aspects of the mind-body problem. An abridged version of the article appeared in the ''Encyclopedia of Unbelief'' (ed. [[Gordon Stein]], 1985).

Edwards omitted Reich's orgone therapy from the ''Encyclopedia'' article because, he said, "it is of no philosophical interest." But in a BBC interview he said somewhat more: "I concede that Reich had no real competence as a physicist... At the same time I am quite convinced that the orgone theory cannot be complete nonsense. For a number of years, largely out of curiosity, I sat in an orgone accumulator once a day."&lt;ref name=greatness/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10797">There have been several designs for a '''[[peace]] flag'''.

== The Peace Flag initiative ==
"The Peace Flag" is an initiative that aims to unify all nations underneath one common symbol on [[International Day of Peace|International Peace Day]].
While there are various icons of peace – the olive branch, the dove – there is no official world flag of peace adopted by the [[United Nations]]. That’s why this initiative has proposed that, for one day a year on 21 September, every country raises an all-white version of their national flag to represent that we are all one. In 2013, embassies of Colombia, Equatorial Guinea and Ecuador in London officially agreed to support The Peace Flag initiative by raising a colorless version of their respective flags on September 21. The initiative was nominated for a White Pencil in 2012 at [[D&amp;AD]] for its contribution towards peace, in support of Peace One Day.

== White-bordered national flag ==
[[File:Peace to All Nations.jpg|thumb|left|White-bordered US flag. Banner reads "Peace to All Nations".]]
The [[white flag]] is recognized in most of the world as a flag of surrender, truce or ceasefire. The first mention of a white flag used in this context is made during the Eastern Han dynasty (AD 25–220). A white flag was also used by the anti-war movement during the [[US Civil War]] in 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7t_an-gkYa4C&amp;pg=PA251&amp;dq=%22Peace+Flag%22|title=The American Annual Cyclopedia and Register of Important Events of the Year|date=30 April 1864|publisher=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XS0LAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA230|title=Struggles and Triumphs: Or, Sixty Years' Recollections of P.T. Barnum, Including His Golden Rules for Money-making|first=Phineas Taylor|last=Barnum|date=30 April 1889|publisher=Courier Company|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1891, the third [[Peace congress#Universal Peace Congress|Universal Peace Congress]] in Rome devised a generalized Peace Flag design, which was simply the home nation's flag bordered in white to signify non-violent conflict resolution. This was used (although not officially adopted) by the [[American Peace Society]]&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=btwBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA213&amp;dq="Peace+Flag" US advocate of peace]''&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Universal Peace Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=09wBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA113|title=The Advocate of Peace|date=30 April 1894|publisher=American Peace Society|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed by Henry Pettit.&lt;ref name="Devere Allen 1930. p.553"/&gt;

== The International Council of Women's banner ==
[[File:1904 Peace Flag.jpg|thumb|right|Button depicting the peace flag]]
In the 1890s, expatriate American Cora Slocomb di Brazza Savorgnan, the Countess Di Brazza, invented a universal peace flag with three upright bands: yellow, purple, and white, which became the peace flag of the [[International Peace Bureau]].&lt;ref name="Devere Allen 1930. p.553"&gt;Devere Allen, ed., The Fight for Peace (New York: Macmillan, 1930), 553, [https://www.questia.com/read/886957 ].&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, there was a complicated symbol on the middle band: "a shield ... surmounted by a man's and a woman's clasped hands, sustained by a pair of dove wings with a white star aloft; on the shield can appear any device chosen by the association adopting the flag, or simply the number of enrollment among the users of the flag, or the motto ''Pro Concordia Labor'' (For Peace I Work), or this motto may be placed upon a ribbon on the flag beneath the shield, or on a streamer (white) from the flag staff (blue, the color of promise) surmounted by a star with the motto of the association or individual using the flag upon the other white streamer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-IIEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA315|title=History and Minutes of the National Council of Women of the United States, Organized in Washington, D.C., March 31, 1888|first=National Council of Women of the United|last=States|date=30 April 1898|publisher=E.B. Stillings|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This flag was adopted by the [[International Council of Women]] in 1896. In 1904, it lost the complicated design and became a simple tricolor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RCqyJyiwW7MC&amp;pg=PA476|title=School Arts|date=30 April 2018|publisher=Davis Publications|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Earth flag ==
[[File:Peace Congress flag.svg|thumb|The Universal Peace Congress' world peace flag.]]
{{See also|Flag of the Earth}}
James William van Kirk, a Methodist minister from Youngstown (Ohio, USA), designed the first world peace [[flag of the Earth]], using rainbow stripes, stars and a globe. In 1913 and 1929, he made a peace tour through Europe with his flag.&lt;ref&gt;Corien Glaudemans, 'Een vredesapostel uit Ohio', in: ''Den Haag Centraal'', 16 oktober 2009; for pictures of James William van Kirk and his peace flag, see [http://www.haagsebeeldbank.nl/ Haagse Beeldbank; photocollection of the Municipal Archive of The Hague (the Netherlands)] nrs. 1.02811 and 5.12996.&lt;/ref&gt; He traveled around the world arguing for "the brotherhood of man and the Fatherhood of God".&lt;ref&gt;"How One Minister Paid His Way Round The World". ''The Western Christian Advocate''. C. Holliday and J.F. Wright, 1906.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Universal Peace Congress eventually came to adopt Kirk's flag as its official World Peace Flag, and it was subsequently adopted by the American Peace Society as well as other groups. It consisted of "the earth on a blue field covered with white stars; a white band crossed the globe and to the left was broken up into a spectrum representing the variations of the human race — different, but united in peace".&lt;ref name="Devere Allen 1930. p.553"/&gt;

In 1938, Kirk authored an autobiography, ''Stranger than fiction : four times around the world, designer of world flag, a world builder, at 80 years makes a new start in life''.

== The Banner of Peace ==
{{main|Banner of Peace}}
[[File:Pax cultura.svg|thumb|140px|Banner of Peace sign]]
The ''banner of peace'' is a symbol of the [[Roerich Pact]]. This pact was the first international treaty dedicated to the protection of artistic and scientific institutions and historical monuments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uscbs.org/1935-roerich-pact.html Roerich Pact: Treaty on the Protection of Artistic and Scientific Institutions and Historic Monuments]&lt;/ref&gt; It was signed on April 15, 1935. The banner of peace was proposed by [[Nicholas Roerich]] for an international pact for the protection of culture values.

== The Rainbow flag ==
[[File:PACE-flag.svg|thumb|220px|The actual rainbow colors in the PACE flag ([[Italian language|Italian]] for '[[peace]]')]]
The most common recent design is a [[rainbow flag]] representing peace, first used in [[Italy]] at a [[peace march]] in 1961. The flag was inspired by similar multi-coloured flags used in demonstrations against [[nuclear weapon]]s. A previous version had featured a dove drawn by [[Pablo Picasso]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elettrosmog.com/bandieradellapace.htm|title=La vera storia della bandiera della pace - Notizie storiche sulla  bandiera della Pace, la bandiera Arcobaleno della Pace|first=|last=A.E.|website=www.elettrosmog.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common variety has seven colours — [[purple]], [[blue]], [[azure (color)|azure]], [[green]], [[yellow]], [[orange (color)|orange]], and [[red]] — and is emblazoned in bold with the [[Italian language|Italian]] word ''PACE'', meaning "peace".

It became popular with the ''Pace da tutti i balconi'' ("peace from every balcony") campaign in 2002, started as a protest against the impending war in the world. The flag was flown from balconies in all Italian [[city|cities]] by citizens against the war. Its use spread to other countries too, and the Italian ''Pace'' was sometimes, but not everywhere, replaced with the corresponding translation in the local languages.

According to [[Amnesty International]], producer [[Franco Belsito]] had produced about 1,000 flags per year for 18 years, and suddenly had to cope with a demand in the range of the millions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnesty.no/aktuelt/flere-nyheter/arkiv-reportasjer/det-nytter-1 'Det nytter!'], Amnesty International Norway&lt;/ref&gt;

Common variations include moving the purple stripe down below the azure one, and adding a white stripe on top.

The seven-color peace flag is not to be confused with the similar six-color [[Rainbow flag (LGBT movement)|gay pride flag]], which does not have [[azure (color)|azure]] (it has [[Turquoise (color)|turquoise]]) and the colors are in opposite order: with red at the top.

[[Robert A. Heinlein]], in his 1947 short story ''[[The Green Hills of Earth]]'', referred to "Terra's [Earth's] rainbow banner".

=== The largest peace flag ===
[[File:MegaPeaceFlag.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Large peace flag in Lecce, 14 November 2009]]
The first large peace flag was made in [[Lecce]], [[Salento]], Italy by the association "GPace - Youth for peace" on Saturday, 14 November 2009. It was 21 m wide and 40 m long. Three years later this record was broken. On September the 21st 2012 the Belgian Peace Organisation [http://www.vrede.be/ Vrede vzw], Vredeshuis Ghent and five city schools unfolded the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VzXEtQN8x4 worlds largest peace flag] (30 m wide and 50 m long) in the historic center of [[Ghent]]. The action aimed to reinforce the demand to disarm in order to make room for sustainable development.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5883">'''Peter Munz''' (12 May 1921 – 14 October 2006) was a [[philosopher]] and [[historian]], Professor of the [[Victoria University of Wellington]]; among the major influences on his work were [[Karl Popper]] and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].&lt;ref name="Guardian-obit"&gt;{{cite news|last=Price|first=Russell|title=Obituary: Peter Munz|newspaper=The Guardian|date=11 March 2007|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/mar/12/obituaries.mainsection}}&lt;/ref&gt; Munz is one of two students who studied under both Popper and Wittgenstein.&lt;ref&gt;Edmunds, D. and Eidenow, J. ''Wittgenstein's Poker: The Story of a Ten-Minute Argument Between Two Great Philosophers,'' 2001, page 13.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Early life and education==
Munz was born in [[Chemnitz]], [[Germany]] in 1921, and educated in Germany, Switzerland, and Italy. The Munz family were [[Jewish]], and the rise of [[fascism]] in Italy and [[Nazism]] in Germany led Munz and his mother and sister to emigrate to [[New Zealand]]. They arrived in [[Christchurch]] in January 1940.&lt;ref name="Guardian-obit"/&gt;

Later in 1940, Munz enrolled in [[Canterbury University College]], where he studied German, history and philosophy. His philosophy lecturer was [[Karl Popper]], who had also migrated from Europe to New Zealand to escape the Nazi regime. The two men became close friends.&lt;ref name="Guardian-obit"/&gt;

After graduating from Canterbury in 1944, Munz earned a PhD at [[Cambridge University]] in England. At Cambridge he studied under [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].&lt;ref name="NZ Books obit"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Morris |first1=Paul |title=Obituary - Peter Munz |url=https://nzbooks.org.nz/2006/obituaries/obituary-peter-munz/ |website=New Zealand Books |accessdate=25 September 2018 |ref=NZ Books obit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
Munz returned to New Zealand to lecture at [[Victoria University of Wellington]], where he taught the history of the middle ages, 17th century France, and the [[French Revolution]]. He published work on medieval history, and translated the work of other writers from German and Italian into English.&lt;ref name="Guardian-obit"/&gt;

From the 1950s, Munz also researched and published on the place of religion in modern thought and the role of myth in society. From the mid 1970s, his work focused increasingly on philosophy. Some of his published work focused on his two mentors, Popper and Wittgenstein. He agreed with Popper that there is such a thing as certain knowledge, and that societies are better off when knowledge is free and open.&lt;ref name="NZ Books obit"/&gt; 

==Controversy==
One of his former students wrote that Munz "liked being provocative",&lt;ref name="Guardian-obit"/&gt; and in his later life he took several controversial positions. He was highly critical of [[postmodern]] history, and in 1994 published a long and scathing review of [[Anne Salmond]]'s book &lt;i&gt;Two Worlds&lt;/i&gt; in which he suggested that she was less interested in historical truth than "faddish" postmodernism and [[political correctness]].&lt;ref name="Munz-NZJH"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Munz |first1=Peter |title=The Two Worlds of Anne Salmond in Postmodern Fancy-Dress |journal=New Zealand Journal of History |date=1994 |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=60-75 |url=http://www.nzjh.auckland.ac.nz/document/document/?wid=683 |accessdate=25 September 2018 |ref=Munz-NZJH}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review also made a number of unflattering comments about traditional [[Māori people|Maori]] society, saying that they "found" New Zealand but did not "discover" it, and that they "were not good observers... a society in which people are unable to discern and diagnose life-threatening events is lacking in something that is essential."&lt;ref name="Munz-NZJH"/&gt;

In 2004 Munz appeared before the [[New Zealand Parliament]]'s Law and Order [[select committee]] to argue that consensual [[incest]] should be legalised. He argued that "the prohibition of incest is completely universal in early Palaeolithic societies and has lingered on ever since. But in modern civil societies it is an outmoded prohibition."&lt;ref name="NZH incest"&gt;{{cite news |title=Academic takes on incest taboo |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=3567929 |accessdate=25 September 2018 |publisher=New Zealand Herald |date=21 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a frequent critic of the state of [[Israel]], saying that "I'm Jewish myself and I find it absolutely devastating how other Jews can do things like steal other people's lands and then kill them."&lt;ref name="NZH incest"/&gt;

'''Pity''' is a sympathetic sorrow evoked by the suffering of others and is used in a comparable sense to  ''[[compassion]]'', ''[[condolence]]'' or ''[[empathy]]''.  Through frequent, insincere, pejorative usage, it is used to connote feelings of superiority, condescension, or contempt.&lt;ref name="Stuff Pitty!"&gt;[http://www.newint.org/features/2005/11/01/keynote/ Stuff Pity!]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Den Leichnam des Darius.jpg|thumb|right|Alexander sees with a look of pity that Darius has died from his wounds.]]
[[File:Songs of Innocence and of Experience, copy L, 1795 (Yale Center for British Art) The Human Abstract.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[The Human Abstract (poem)|The Human Abstract]]'', a poem in William Blake's collection ''[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience]]'', in which he proclaims "Pity would be no more, / If we did not make somebody Poor" (1-2). This version is copy L created in 1795 and currently held by the [[Yale Center for British Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/object.xq?objectid=songsie.l.illbk.47&amp;java=no| title = Songs of Innocence and of Experience, copy L, object 47 (Bentley 47, Erdman 47, Keynes 47) "The Human Abstract" | editors = Morris Eaves, Robert N. Essick, and Joseph Viscomi| publisher = [[William Blake Archive]]|accessdate = June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The word ''pity'' comes from the Latin ''[[Pietas|pietās]]'', that is also etymon of ''[[piety]]''.

The word is often used in the translations from ancient Greek into English of [[Aristotle]]'s ''Poetics'' and ''Rhetoric''.  [[Aristotle]] argued (Rhetoric 2.8) that before a person can feel pity for another human, the person must first have experienced suffering of a similar type, and the person must also be somewhat distanced or removed from the sufferer.&lt;ref name="konstan"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Konstan|title=Pity Transformed|location=London|publisher=Duckworth|year=2001|pages=181|ISBN=0-7156-2904-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Aristotle's ''Rhetoric'' he defines pity as follows: "Let pity, then, be a kind of pain in the case of an apparent destructive or painful harm of one not deserving to encounter it, which one might expect oneself, or one of one's own, to suffer, and this when it seems near".&lt;ref name="konstan" /&gt; Aristotle also pointed out that "people pity their acquaintances, provided that they are not exceedingly close in kinship; for concerning these they are disposed as they are concerning themselves...For what is terrible is different from what is pitiable, and is expulsive of pity".&lt;ref name="konstan" /&gt; Thus, from Aristotle's perspective, in order to feel pity, a person must believe that the person who is suffering does not deserve their fate.&lt;ref name="konstan" /&gt; Developing a traditional Greek view in his work on poetry, Aristotle also defines tragedy as a kind of imitative poetry that provokes pity and fear.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', section 6.1449b24-28.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The religious concept of pity was reinforced in the West after the acceptance of Judeo-Christian concepts of God by the proposition of a deity which felt pity for all humanity. Consistent references to the concept of God's pity can be found in the older Jewish tradition. The Hebrew word "Hesed" translated in the LXX by "Eleos" carries the meaning roughly equivalent to pity in the sense of compassion, mercy and loving-kindness. (See The Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament, 698a.) By the nineteenth century, two different kinds of pity had come to be distinguished, which we might call "benevolent pity" and "contemptuous pity" (see Kimball). David Hume observed that pity which has in it a strong mixture of good-will, is nearly allied to contempt, which is a species of dislike, with a mixture of pride. Pity is an [[emotion]] that almost always results from an encounter with a real or perceived unfortunate, injured, or pathetic creature.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Jean-Jacques Rousseau had the following opinion of pity as opposed to love for others: "It is therefore certain that pity is a natural sentiment, which, by moderating in every individual the activity of self-love, contributes to the mutual preservation of the whole species. It is this pity which hurries us without reflection to the assistance of those we see in distress; it is this pity which, in a state of nature, stands for laws, for manners, for virtue, with this advantage, that no one is tempted to disobey her sweet and gentle voice: it is this pity which will always hinder a robust savage from plundering a feeble child, or infirm old man, of the subsistence they have acquired with pain and difficulty, if he has but the least prospect of providing for himself by any other means: it is this pity which, instead of that sublime maxim of argumentative justice, Do to others as you would have others do to you, inspires all men with that other maxim of natural goodness a great deal less perfect, but perhaps more useful, Consult your own happiness with as little prejudice as you can to that of others. It is in a word, in this natural sentiment, rather than in fine-spun arguments, that we must look for the cause of that reluctance which every man would experience to do evil, even independently of the maxims of education." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rousseau|first1=Jean-Jacques|title=Discourse on the origin of inequality|date=2004|publisher=Dover|location=Mineola|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person experiencing pity will experience a combination of intense [[sorrow (emotion)|sorrow]] and [[mercy]] for the person or creature, often giving the pitied some kind of [[aid]], physical help, and/or [[money|financial assistance]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Nietzsche, however, pointed out that since all people to some degree value [[self-esteem]] and [[self-worth]], pity can negatively affect any situation. Additionally, pity may actually be [[psychologically]] harmful to the pitied: [[Self-pity]] and [[Clinical depression|depression]] can sometimes be the result of the power imbalance fostered by pity, sometimes with extremely negative psychological and psycho-social consequences for the pitied party.

Though in his later works he reverses his position and sees Pity as an emotion that can draw beings together, [[mysticism|Mystic]] poet [[William Blake]] is known to have been ambivalent about the emotion Pity. In [[The Book of Urizen]] Pity begins when Los looks on the body of Urizen bound in chains (Urizen 13.50–51). However, Pity furthers the fall, "For pity divides the soul" (13.53), dividing Los and Enitharmon (Enitharmon is named Pity at her birth). Analyzers of this work assert that Blake shows that "Pity defuses the power of righteous indignation and proper prophetic wrath that lead to action. Pity is a distraction; the soul is divided between it and the action a 'pitiable' state demands. This is seen as Los's division into active male and tearful female, the latter deluding the former."{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Again railing against Pity in ''[[The Human Abstract (poem)|The Human Abstract]]'', Blake exclaims: "Pity would be no more, / If we did not make somebody Poor" (1–2).

== Neurological perspectives ==
Modern neurology asserts that pity consists of an initial aversion to the plight of the sufferer, after which the higher parts of the brain make a more nuanced assessment of the situation (e.g., considering the context and invoking empathy, etc.).{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The division of philosophy into a '''practical philosophy''' and a [[theoretical philosophy|theoretical]] discipline has its origin in [[Aristotle]]'s moral philosophy and natural philosophy categories. In [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]] courses in theoretical and practical philosophy are taught separately, and are separate degrees. Other countries may use a similar scheme—some [[Scotland|Scottish]] universities, for example, divide philosophy into [[logic]], [[metaphysics]], and [[ethics]]—but in most universities around the world philosophy is taught as a single subject. There is also a unified philosophy subject in some Swedish universities, such as [[Södertörn University College|Södertörns Högskola]].

Practical Philosophy is also the use of philosophy and philosophical techniques in everyday life. This can take a number of forms including reflective practice, personal philosophical thinking, and [[philosophical counselling]].

Examples of practical philosophy subjects are:
*[[Aesthetics]]
*[[Decision theory]]
*[[Ethics]]
*[[Political philosophy]]                                             
==Scope of philosophy==
Science, which emerged from philosophy, deals with material realities, arts with the various styles of expressions while philosophy deals with our experience of reality by essentially different methods.
===Ontology===
[[Ontology]] provides techniques to deal the concept of [[reality]], and how ''[[truth]]'' may be either ''doxa'' (informed [[opinion]]) or ''techa'' (demonstrable [[fact]]). This branch of philosophy also considers the relation of man to the measurable physical universe and to the virtual concept of divine influences. 
===Axiology===
[[Axiology]] provides directions in determining what is socially correct opinion and behavior:
* What is good? (socially beneficial)
* What is bad?  (socially harmful)
* What is ''khair'' (social obligations)
* What is ''shar?'' (social prohibitions)
===Epistemology===
[[Epistemology]] deals with [[knowledge]]. It tells us which knowledge is ultimate?
* What are the sources of knowledge?
* What sources of knowledge are dependable?

Each social group develops its ideology of life according to epistemology. While science provides a measure of testable ''techa'', it is also partly a belief system with values.

==Process==
First, the practitioners (there must be at least two) must identify what is wanted from the process - the objective of the enterprise. Secondly we consider the resources we have to hand such as  time, learning, experience, intelligence and so on, and finally we try to unite what we do now know as ''truth'' to the objective we wish to know, using techniques such as rhetoric,debate, discussion, argumentation. No matter what the protagonists actually think or believe, generally one person or group tries advocate the conventional point of view, while their opponents try to convince them of a radically opposing and controversial opinion.

'''Selfism''' refers to any philosophy, theory,  doctrine, or tendency that upholds explicitly [[selfish]] principles as being desirable. It is usually used [[pejoratively]].

==Definition==
The term "selfism" was used by [[Paul Vitz]] in his 1977 book ''Psychology as Religion: The Cult of Self-Worship''. Vitz deconstructs the selfist movement(s) and tries to uphold [[God]]-centered [[Altruism (ethics)|altruism]], and claims that all of modern-day [[liberalism]] and [[leftism]] are essentially selfist at their core. He lays the blame predominantly at the feet of [[Erik Erikson]], [[Erich Fromm]], and other prominent psychologists of the third quarter of the 20th century (c. 1950–1975 CE).

Explicit selfishness as a desirable end and moral good had diverse manifestations during that period, for example, in the writings of [[David Seabury]], [[Ayn Rand]], and even among some of Rand's near-opposites, such as Erikson and Fromm. Rand called her philosophy [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]]. Later popularizers of similar positions include [[Nathaniel Branden]], [[Paul Lepanto]], [[Robert Ringer]], [[Harry Browne]], and [[David Kelley]], among others. None of these named the system they espoused "selfism" or characterized it as "selfist", although both Seabury and Rand included the word "selfishness" in the titles of books presenting their views. Many of these figures were pro-[[Capitalism|capitalist]] [[Secularism|secularists]] ("[[Atheism|atheist]] capitalists"), but Seabury was a [[Christian]], while Erickson and Fromm were prominent [[Leftism|leftists]].

[[Anton LaVey]], founder of the [[Church of Satan]] and author of [[The Satanic Bible]], acknowledges [[Ayn Rand]] and [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] as a source of inspiration for [[LaVeyan Satanism]]. This form of Satanism holds the [[self]] above all else in similar fashion to Objectivism. Despite some similarities, they remain separate entities, as there are clear differences between the two concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Origins of selfist thought==
Some early examples of "selfist" thinking are the [[Ethical egoism|egoistic]] philosophies of [[Yangism]] in [[ancient China]] and of [[Cyrenaic]] [[hedonism]] in [[ancient Greece]].  Yangists followed the teachings of [[Yang Zhu]] and might have been influenced by [[Taoism]].  [[Cyrenaics]], founded by [[Aristippus of Cyrene]], were [[Religious skepticism|skeptics]] and [[Materialism|materialists]] (but perhaps nominally Greek [[Paganism|pagans]]). [[Thomas Hobbes]], who could also be viewed as ''selfist'', was a [[Materialism|materialist]] but also advocated loyalty to a strong government and [[state church]]. [[Joseph Butler]], whose philosophy is unmistakably selfist, was generally regarded as an [[First seven Ecumenical Councils|orthodox Christian]] and was canonized an [[Anglican]] [[saint]]. The views of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Max Stirner]] provide a more proximate link to the modern selfists.

'''Systemography''' or '''SGR'''&lt;ref name="Systemic Theory"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eriksson|first=Darek M.|year=1997|title=A Principal Exposition of Jean-Louis Le Moigne’s Systemic Theory|journal="Cybernetics and Human Knowing"|volume=4 |issue=2-3|url=http://www.mcxapc.org/docs/ateliers/erikss1.htm|accessdate=24 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a process where phenomena regarded as complex are purposefully represented as a constructed model of a [[Systems theory#General systems research and systems inquiry|general system]]. It may be used in three different ways: conceptualization, analysis, and simulation. The work of [[Jean-Louis Le Moigne]] is associated with systemography.&lt;ref name="Systemic Theory" /&gt;

Systemography modeling consists of building, simultaneously, the process´ operational, informational and decisional systemographs in modeling phase. Ettore Bresciani Filho (2001) recommends the following order in systemography modeling:

#Define the border of the system to be modeled, characterizing the border´s processors responsible for the system´s inputs and outputs.
#Build the operational systemograph of the production system, disposing in a [[block diagram]] the production process' different stages, representing each with an operational processor.
#Build the informational systemograph of the production system, disposing in a block diagram the different stages of the information´s generation, transformation and communication, representing each with an informational processor.
#Build the decisional systemograph of the production system, disposing in a block diagram the different stages of the decision´s process representing each one with decisional processors.
#Classify the processors of the systemographs in categories, types and levels; building a comparative table of processors.
#Identify the possible forces fields influences, such as culture and organizational climate.
#Relate the problems in priority order, applying problem analysis techniques to identify and find solutions for each one of them.
#Use mathematical methods for the modeling the processors as the system as a whole.
#Propose the solution of the problems in the form of recommendations and procedures to be adopted. 
To systemograph consists, in a few words, in building a model, physical or mathematical, static or dynamic, analytical or numeric of a phenomenon that can be noticed as complex by the analyzer that intends to model it.

The elaboration of the operational systemographs (presenting the operations involved in the process), of the informational systemographs (where the information flow is highlighted) and of the decisional systemographs (where the decisions are shown) allows, during the activity analysis, to evaluate it and to improve it.

These systemographs allow to observe and to eliminate redundancies and cycles that are (or not) important for the process, providing its systemic visualization, identifying points to allow its rationalization, increase of flexibility, and activation.

==History==
The systemography was studied and presented theoretically by Jean-Louis LeMoigne (1990; 1994) in his ''Théorie du Système Général'' (1994). Bresciani Filho presents, in his works and through his students, a practical use of the systemography concepts, particularly for systems of production and of information.

'''Thales of Miletus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|θ|eɪ|l|iː|z}}; {{lang-el|[[wikt:Θαλῆς|Θαλῆς]] (ὁ Μιλήσιος)}}, ''Thalēs''; {{circa}} 624&amp;nbsp;– c. 546&amp;nbsp;BC) was a [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]], [[Greek Mathematics|mathematician]], and [[astronomer]] from [[Miletus]] in [[Asia Minor]] (present-day [[Milet]] in [[Turkey]]).  He was one of the [[Seven Sages of Greece]]. Many, most notably [[Aristotle]], regarded him as the first philosopher in the [[Greek philosophy|Greek tradition]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], Metaphysics Alpha, 983b18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CPM"&gt;{{cite DGRBM |title=Thales |year=1870 |url=https://archive.org/stream/dictionaryofgree03smituoft#page/1016  |page=1016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he is otherwise historically recognized as the first individual in [[Western civilization]] known to have entertained and engaged in [[History of science#Greco-Roman world|scientific philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Fowler, [http://galileoandeinstein.physics.virginia.edu/lectures/thales.html Early Greek Science: Thales to Plato], University of Virginia [Retrieved 2016-06-16]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;Frank N. Magill, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_CMl8ziTbKYC&amp;pg=PA1121 ''The Ancient World: Dictionary of World Biography'', Volume 1], Routledge, 2003 {{isbn|1135457395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thales is recognized for breaking from the use of [[mythology]] to explain the world and the universe, and instead explaining natural objects and phenomena by [[Theory|theories]] and [[hypothesis|hypotheses]], in a precursor to modern [[science]]. Almost all the other [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic philosophers]] followed him in explaining nature as deriving from a unity of everything based on the existence of a single ultimate substance, instead of using mythological explanations. Aristotle reported Thales' hypothesis that the [[Arche|originating principle]] of [[nature]] and the nature of [[matter]] was a single material [[Substance theory|substance]]: [[Water (classical element)|water]].

In [[mathematics]], Thales used [[geometry]] to calculate the heights of pyramids and the distance of ships from the shore. He is the first known individual to use [[deductive reasoning]] applied to geometry, by deriving four corollaries to [[Thales' theorem]]. He is the first known individual to whom a [[Greek mathematics#Classical period|mathematical discovery]] has been attributed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Ionia and the Pythagoreans" p. 43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

Thales was probably born in the city of Miletus around the mid-620s BC.

===Background===
The dates of Thales' life are not exactly known, but are roughly established by a few datable events mentioned in the sources. According to [[Herodotus]] (and as determined by modern methods) Thales predicted the [[Eclipse of Thales|solar eclipse of May 28, 585&amp;nbsp;BC]].&lt;ref name="1.74.2"&gt;Herodotus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hdt.+1.74.1 1.74.2], and A. D. Godley's footnote 1; Pliny, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plin.+Nat.+2.9 2.9 (12)] and Bostock's footnote 2.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diogenes Laërtius]] quotes the chronicle of Apollodorus of Athens as saying that Thales died at the age of 78 during the 58th [[Olympiad]] (548–545&amp;nbsp;BC) and attributes his death to [[heat stroke]] while watching the games. 

Diogenes Laërtius states that "according to Herodotus and Douris and [[Democritus]]", Thales' parents were Examyes and Cleobuline, whose names are indigenous Carian and Greek, respectively.&lt;ref name="Freely2012"/&gt; Diogenes then delivers conflicting reports: one that Thales married and either fathered a son ([[Cybisthus]] or [[Cybisthon]]) or adopted his nephew of the same name; the second that he never married, telling his mother as a young man that it was too early to marry, and as an older man that it was too late. [[Plutarch]] had earlier told this version: [[Solon]] visited Thales and asked him why he remained single; Thales answered that he did not like the idea of having to worry about children. Nevertheless, several years later, anxious for family, he adopted his nephew Cybisthus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Plutarch |title=Lives |year=1952 |publisher=William Benton |location=Chicago |pages=66 |chapter=Solon |editor=Robert Maynard Hutchins |series=Great Books of the Western World |volume=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thales involved himself in many activities, taking the role of an innovator. Some say that he left no writings, others say that he wrote ''On the [[Solstice]]'' and ''On the [[Equinox]]''. (No writing attributed to him has survived.) Diogenes Laërtius quotes two letters from Thales: one to [[Pherecydes of Syros]], offering to review his book on religion, and one to [[Solon]], offering to keep him company on his sojourn from{{Clarify|date=February 2017}} [[Athens]]. Thales identifies the Milesians as Athenian [[Colonies in antiquity#Greek colonies|colonists]].&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, 1.43, 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Engineering===
Thales' principal occupation was [[engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;J J O'Connor and E F Robertson, [http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Thales.html Thales of Miletus], University of St Andrews [Retrieved 2016-06-16]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was aware of the existence of the [[lodestone]], and was the first to be connected to knowledge of this in history. According to Aristotle, Thales thought lodestones had souls, because iron is attracted to them (by the force of [[magnetism]]).&lt;ref&gt;Nathan Ida, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YtmIBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA427 ''Engineering Electromagnetics''], Springer, 2015 {{isbn|3319078062}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Hieronymus of Rhodes|Hieronymus]], historically quoted by [[Diogenes Laertius]], Thales found the height of pyramids by comparison between the lengths of the shadows cast by a person and by the pyramids.&lt;ref&gt;J J O'Connor and E F Robertson&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business===
[[File:Capernaum roman olive press by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|An olive mill and an olive press dating from Roman times in [[Capernaum, Israel]].]]
Several anecdotes suggest Thales was not just a philosopher, but also a businessman.

A story, with different versions, recounts how Thales achieved riches from an olive harvest by [[Weather forecasting#Ancient forecasting|prediction of the weather]].

In one version, he bought all the [[Olive oil extraction#Traditional method: olive press|olive presses]] in Miletus after predicting the weather and a good harvest for a particular year. Another version of the story has Aristotle explain that Thales had reserved presses in advance, at a discount, and could rent them out at a high price when demand peaked, following his [[derivative (finance)|prediction]] of a particularly good harvest. This first version of the story would constitute the first historically known creation and use of [[Futures contract|futures]], whereas the second version would be the first historically known of creation and use of [[Option (finance)|options]].&lt;ref&gt;George Crawford, Bidyut Sen - ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=NIIVeirctosC&amp;pg=PA7 Derivatives for Decision Makers: Strategic Management Issues]'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1996 {{isbn|9780471129943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle explains that Thales' objective in doing this was not to enrich himself but to prove to his fellow Milesians that philosophy could be useful, contrary to what they thought,&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]] 1259a [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Aristot.+Pol.+1.1259a]&lt;/ref&gt; or alternatively, Thales had made his foray into enterprise because of a personal challenge put to him by an individual who had asked why, if Thales was an intelligent famous philosopher, he had yet to attain wealth.

===Politics===
Thales’ political life had mainly to do with the involvement of the [[Ionians]] in the defense of [[Anatolia]] against the growing power of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]], who were then new to the region. In neighbouring [[Lydia]], a king had come to power: [[Croesus]], who was somewhat too aggressive for the size of his army. He had conquered most of the states of coastal Anatolia, including the cities of the Ionians. The story is told in [[Herodotus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]], Book 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lydians were at war with the [[Medes]], who were a remnant of the first wave of migration of ancient Iranian peoples, who had subsequently settled into the region, over the issue of refuge the Lydians had given to some [[Scythian]] [[Mercenary|soldiers of fortune]] inimical to the Medes. The war endured for five years, but in the sixth an eclipse of the Sun (mentioned above) spontaneously halted a battle in progress (the [[Battle of Halys (585&amp;nbsp;BC)|Battle of Halys]]).

It seems that Thales had predicted this [[solar eclipse]]. The [[Seven Sages of Greece|Seven Sages]] were most likely already in existence, as Croesus was also heavily influenced by [[Solon]] of [[Athens]], another sage. Whether Thales was present at the battle is not known, nor are the exact terms of the prediction, but based on it the Lydians and Medes made peace immediately, swearing a [[Blood brother|blood oath]].

The Medes were [[Dependent territory|dependencies]] of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] under [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]]. Croesus now sided with the Medes against the Persians and marched in the direction of Iran (with far fewer men than he needed). He was stopped by the river [[Halys River|Halys]], then unbridged. This time he had Thales with him, perhaps by invitation. Whatever his status, the king gave the problem to him, and he got the army across by digging a diversion upstream so as to reduce the flow, making it possible to ford the river. The channels ran around both sides of the camp.

The two armies engaged at [[Pteria (Cappadocia)|Pteria]] in [[Cappadocia]]. As the battle was indecisive but paralyzing to both sides, Croesus marched home, dismissed his mercenaries and sent emissaries to his dependents and allies to ask them to dispatch fresh troops to [[Sardis]]. The issue became more pressing when the Persian army showed up at Sardis. [[Diogenes Laërtius]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laërtius]] 1.25&lt;/ref&gt; tells us that Thales gained fame as a counselor when he advised the Milesians not to engage in a symmachia, a "fighting together", with the Lydians. This has sometimes been interpreted as an alliance, but a ruler does not ally with his subjects.

Croesus was defeated before the city of Sardis by Cyrus, who subsequently spared Miletus because it had taken no action. Cyrus was so impressed by Croesus’ wisdom and his connection with the sages that he spared him and took his advice on various matters.

The Ionians were now free. Herodotus says that Thales advised them to form an Ionian state; that is, a bouleuterion ("deliberative body") to be located at [[Teos]] in the center of [[Ionia]]. The Ionian cities should be demoi, or "districts". Miletus, however, received favorable terms from Cyrus. The others remained in an Ionian League of 12 cities (excluding Miletus now), and were subjugated by the Persians.

While Herodotus reported that most of his fellow Greeks believe that Thales did divert the river Halys to assist King Croesus' military endeavors, he himself finds it doubtful.&lt;ref name="Dicks"/&gt;

===Sagacity===
[[File:MiletusIonicStoa.jpg|thumb|The Ionic Stoa on the Sacred Way in Miletus]]
[[Diogenes Laërtius]]&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius 1.22&lt;/ref&gt; tells us that the [[Seven Sages of Greece|Seven Sages]] were created in the [[archon]]ship of Damasius at [[Athens]] about 582&amp;nbsp;BC and that Thales was the first sage. The same story, however, asserts that Thales emigrated to [[Miletus]]. There is also a report that he did not become a student of [[nature]] until after his political career. Much as we would like to have a date on the seven sages, we must reject these stories and the tempting date if we are to believe that Thales was a native of Miletus, predicted the eclipse, and was with [[Croesus]] in the campaign against [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]].

Thales received instruction from an [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] priest. It was fairly certain that he came from a wealthy, established family, in a class which customarily provided higher education for their children. Moreover, the ordinary citizen, unless he was a seafaring man or a merchant, could not afford the grand tour in [[Egypt]], and did not consort with noble lawmakers such as [[Solon]].
[[File:Solar eclipse 1999 4 NR.jpg|thumb|left|Total [[eclipse]] of the [[Sun]]]]
In Diogenes Laërtius' ''Lives of Eminent Philosophers'' Chapter 1.39, Laërtius relates the several stories of an expensive object that is to go to the most [[Wisdom#Philosophical perspectives|wise]]. In one version (that Laërtius credits to [[Callimachus]] in his ''Iambics'') Bathycles of Arcadia states in his will that an expensive bowl "'should be given to him who had done most good by his wisdom.'  So it was given to Thales, went the round of all the sages, and came back to Thales again. And he sent it to [[Didyma|Apollo at Didyma]], with this dedication...'Thales the Milesian, son of Examyas [dedicates this] to Delphinian Apollo after twice winning the prize from all the Greeks.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Astronomy ===
{{See also|The Astrologer who Fell into a Well}}
Thales predicted the [[Eclipse of Thales|solar eclipse of May 28, 585&amp;nbsp;BC]].&lt;ref name="1.74.2"/&gt; Thales also described the position of [[Ursa Minor]], and thought the constellation might be useful as a guide for navigation at sea. He calculated the duration of the year and the timings of the [[equinoxes]] and [[solstices]]. He is additionally attributed with the first observation of the [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]] and with calculating the position of the [[Pleiades]].&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Stephen Kirk, John Earle Raven, Malcolm Schofield - Les philosophes présocratiques : Une histoire critique avec un choix de textes, vol. 16, Fribourg, Saint-Paul, coll. « Vestigia », 1995 {{isbn|978-2-204-05263-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plutarch]] indicates that in his day (c. AD 100) there was an extant work, the ''Astronomy'', composed in verse and attributed to Thales.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''[[Moralia#Books|De Pythiae oraculis]]'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0247%3Asection%3D18 18.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theories ==
Early Greeks, and other civilizations before them, often invoked idiosyncratic explanations of natural phenomena with reference to the will of [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[Deity|gods]] and [[hero]]es. Instead, Thales aimed to explain natural phenomena via rational hypotheses that referenced natural processes themselves. For example, rather than assuming that earthquakes were the result of supernatural whims Thales explained them by hypothesizing that the [[Earth]] floats on water and that earthquakes occur when the Earth is rocked by waves.

Thales was a [[Hylozoism|hylozoist]] (one who thinks that matter is alive,&lt;ref&gt;Farrington, B., 1944 Greek Science. Pelican&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. containing soul(s)). Aristotle wrote (''[[De Anima]]'' 411 a7-8) of Thales: ...''Thales thought all things are full of gods''. Aristotle posits the origin of Thales thought on matter generally containing souls, to Thales thinking initially on the fact of, because [[lodestone|magnets]] move iron, the presence of movement of matter indicated this matter contained life.&lt;ref&gt;Garrett Thomson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aHmuCgAAQBAJ ''Thales to Sextus: An Introduction to Ancient Philosophy''], page 25, Waveland Press, 2015, {{isbn|1478631864}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patricia O'Grady, [http://www.iep.utm.edu/thales/#H7 Thales of Miletus], [[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] [Retrieved 2016-07-01]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thales, according to [[Aristotle]], asked what was the nature (Greek ''[[arche]]'') of the object so that it would behave in its characteristic way. [[Physis]] ({{lang|el|φύσις}}) comes from phyein ({{lang|el|φύειν}}), "to grow", related to our word "be".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/77/P0277700.html |title=physics |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061222071531/http://www.bartleby.com/61/77/P0277700.html |archive-date=22 December 2006 |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Company]] |dictionary=[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]] |edition=4th |year=2000 |access-date=18 June 2018 |via=[[Bartleby.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE62.html |title=be |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206143813/http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE62.html |archive-date=6 February 2007 |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Company]] |dictionary=[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]] |edition=4th |year=2000 |access-date=18 June 2018 |via=[[Bartleby.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''(G)natura'' is the way a thing is "born",&lt;ref&gt;The initial g of the archaic Latin gives the root away as [https://web.archive.org/web/20010610085448/http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE143.html *''genə''-], "beget."&lt;/ref&gt; again with the stamp of what it is in itself.

Aristotle&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''[[Metaphysics]]'' 983b6&lt;/ref&gt; characterizes most of the philosophers "at first" ({{lang|grc|πρῶτον}}) as thinking that the "principles in the form of matter were the only principles of all things", where "principle" is [[arche]], "matter" is [[hyle]] ("wood" or "matter", "material") and "form" is [[eidos (philosophy)|eidos]].

''Arche'' is translated as "principle", but the two words do not have precisely the same meaning. A [[principle]] of something is merely prior (related to pro-) to it either chronologically or logically. An arche (from {{lang|grc|ἄρχειν}}, "to rule") dominates an object in some way. If the arche is taken to be an origin, then specific causality is implied; that is, B is supposed to be characteristically B just because it comes from A, which dominates it.

The archai&lt;!-- surely the reader have to recognize this easily as Greek plural of ἀρχή? --&gt; that Aristotle had in mind in his well-known passage on the first Greek scientists are not necessarily chronologically prior to their objects, but are constituents of it. For example, in pluralism objects are composed of earth, air, fire and water, but those elements do not disappear with the production of the object. They remain as archai within it, as do the atoms of the atomists.

What Aristotle is really saying is that the first philosophers were trying to define the substance(s) of which all material objects are composed. As a matter of fact, that is exactly what modern scientists are attempting to accomplish in [[nuclear physics]], which is a second reason why Thales is described as the first western scientist,{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} but some contemporary scholars reject this interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Aryeh  |last=Finkelberg |author-link=|year=2017 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8kEEDgAAQBAJ |title=Heraclitus and Thales’ Conceptual Scheme: A Historical Study |publisher=[[Brill (publisher)|Brill]] |page=318, fn. 38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geometry===
Thales was known for his innovative use of [[geometry]]. His understanding was theoretical as well as practical. For example, he said:

{{quote|
{{transl|el|''Megiston topos: hapanta gar chorei''}} ({{lang|el|Μέγιστον τόπος· ἄπαντα γὰρ χωρεῖ.}})

The greatest is space, for it holds all things.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 35}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Topos is in Newtonian-style [[space]], since the verb, chorei, has the connotation of yielding before things, or spreading out to make room for them, which is [[Extension (metaphysics)|extension]]. Within this extension, things have a position. [[Point (geometry)|Points]], [[line (mathematics)|lines]], [[plane (mathematics)|planes]] and [[solid]]s related by [[distance]]s and [[angle]]s follow from this presumption.

Thales understood [[similar triangles]] and [[right triangle]]s, and what is more, used that knowledge in practical ways. The story is told in DL (loc. cit.) that he measured the height of the [[pyramids]] by their shadows at the moment when his own shadow was equal to his height. A right triangle with two equal legs is a 45-degree right triangle, all of which are similar. The length of the pyramid's shadow measured from the center of the pyramid at that moment must have been equal to its height.

This story indicates that he was familiar with the Egyptian ''[[seked]]'', or ''seqed'', the ratio of the run to the rise of a [[slope]] ([[cotangent]]). The ''seked'' is at the base of problems 56, 57, 58, 59 and 60 of the [[Rhind papyrus]] — an ancient Egyptian mathematical document.

In present-day trigonometry, cotangents require the same units for run and rise (base and perpendicular), but the papyrus uses [[cubits]] for rise and [[Palm (measurement)|palms]] for run, resulting in different (but still characteristic) numbers. Since there were 7 palms in a cubit, the ''seked'' was 7 times the cotangent.

To use an example often quoted in modern reference works, suppose the base of a pyramid is 140&amp;nbsp;cubits and the angle of rise 5.25 ''seked''. The Egyptians expressed their fractions as the sum of fractions, but the decimals are sufficient for the example. What is the rise in cubits? The run is 70&amp;nbsp;cubits, 490 palms. X, the rise, is 490 divided by 5.25 or 93{{frac|1|3}} cubits. These figures sufficed for the Egyptians and Thales. We would go on to calculate the cotangent as 70 divided by 93{{frac|1|3}} to get 3/4 or .75 and looking that up in a table of cotangents find that the angle of rise is a few minutes over 53&amp;nbsp;degrees.

Whether the ability to use the ''[[seked]]'', which preceded Thales by about 1000&amp;nbsp;years, means that he was the first to define trigonometry is a matter of opinion. More practically Thales used the same method to measure the distances of ships at sea, said Eudemus as reported by [[Proclus]] ("in Euclidem"). According to Kirk &amp; Raven (reference cited below), all you need for this feat is three straight sticks pinned at one end and knowledge of your altitude. One stick goes vertically into the ground. A second is made level. With the third you sight the ship and calculate the ''seked'' from the height of the stick and its distance from the point of insertion to the line of sight.

The ''seked'' is a measure of the angle. Knowledge of two angles (the ''seked'' and a right angle) and an enclosed leg (the altitude) allows you to determine by similar triangles the second leg, which is the distance.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Thales' theorems===
[[File:Thales theorem 1.png|thumb|300px|[[Intercept theorem|Thales' theorem]]: &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \frac{DE}{BC} = \frac{AE}{AC } = \frac{AD}{AB}&lt;/math&gt;]]
{{Main article|Thales' theorem}} 
{{Main article|Intercept theorem}}
{{See also|Pythagorean theorem}}
There are two theorems of Thales in [[elementary geometry]], one known as [[Thales' theorem]] having to do with a triangle inscribed in a circle and having the circle's diameter as one leg, the other theorem being also called the [[intercept theorem]]. In addition [[Eudemus of Rhodes|Eudemus]] attributed to him the discovery that a circle is [[bisection|bisected]] by its diameter, that the base angles of an isosceles triangle are equal and that [[vertical angles]] are equal. According to a historical Note,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William George |last=Shute |first2=William W. |last2=Shirk |first3=George F. |last3=Porter |title=Plane and Solid Geometry |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=DIENAQAAIAAJ |publisher=[[American Book Company (1890)|American Book Company]] |year=1960 |pages=25–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; when [[Ancient Egypt#Late Period .28672.E2.80.93332 BC.29|Thales visited Egypt]], he observed that whenever the Egyptians drew two intersecting lines, they would measure the vertical angles to make sure that they were equal. Thales concluded that one could prove that all vertical angles are equal if one accepted some general notions such as: all straight angles are equal, equals added to equals are equal, and equals subtracted from equals are equal.

===Cosmology: water as a first principle===
Thales' most famous philosophical position was his [[cosmology|cosmological]] thesis, which comes down to us through a passage from [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Aristotle |author-link=Aristotle |title=[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]] |others=983 b6 8-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the work Aristotle unequivocally reported Thales’ [[hypothesis]] about the nature of all [[Matter#Historical development|matter]] – that the [[Arche|originating principle of nature]] was [[Material monism|a single material substance]]: water. Aristotle then proceeded to proffer a number of conjectures based on his own observations to lend some credence to why Thales may have advanced this idea (though Aristotle didn’t hold it himself).

Aristotle laid out his own thinking about [[Hylomorphism|matter and form]] which may shed some light on the ideas of Thales, in ''[[Metaphysics]]'' 983 b6 8–11, 17–21. (The passage contains words that were later adopted by science with quite different meanings.)

{{quote|That from which is everything that exists and from which it first becomes and into which it is rendered at last, its substance remaining under it, but transforming in qualities, that they say is the element and principle of things that are. …For it is necessary that there be some nature ({{lang|el|φύσις}}), either one or more than one, from which become the other things of the object being saved... Thales the founder of this type of philosophy says that it is water.}}

In this quote we see Aristotle's depiction of the problem of change and the definition of [[Substance theory|substance]]. He asked if an object changes, is it the same or different? In either case how can there be a change from one to the other? The answer is that the substance "is saved", but acquires or loses different qualities ({{lang|el|πάθη}}, the things you "experience").

Aristotle conjectured that Thales reached his conclusion by contemplating that the "nourishment of all things is moist and that even the hot is created from the wet and lives by it." While Aristotle's conjecture on why Thales held water as the originating principle of matter is his own thinking, his statement that Thales held it as water is generally accepted as genuinely originating with Thales and he is seen as an incipient matter-and-formist.

Thales thought the Earth must be a flat disk which is floating in an expanse of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Thales-of-Miletus |title=Thales of Miletus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Heraclitus (commentator)|Heraclitus Homericus]] states that Thales drew his conclusion from seeing moist substance turn into air, slime and earth. It seems likely that Thales viewed the Earth as solidifying from the water on which it floated and the oceans that surround it.

Writing centuries later, Diogenes Laërtius also states that Thales taught "Water constituted ({{lang|grc|ὑπεστήσατο}}, 'stood under') the principle of all things."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Diogenes Laërtius |author-link=Diogenes Laërtius |url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Lives_of_the_Eminent_Philosophers/Book_I#Thales |title=Lives of the Eminent Philosophers | others=Book 1, paragraph 27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] considered Thales’ position to be roughly the equivalent to the later ideas of [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]], who held that everything was composed of [[air]].

The 1870 book ''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]'' noted&lt;ref name="CPM"/&gt;
{{quote|Thales dogma that water is the origin of things, that is, that it is that out of which every thing arises, and into which every thing resolves itself, Thales may have followed [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic]] cosmogonies, while, unlike them, he sought to establish the truth of the assertion. Hence, Aristotle, immediately after he has called him the originator of philosophy brings forward the reasons which Thales was believed to have adduced in confirmation of that assertion; for that no written development of it, or indeed any book by ''Thales'', was extant, is proved by the expressions which Aristotle uses when he brings forward the doctrines and proofs of the [[Miletus|Milesian]]. (p. 1016)}}

====Influences====
Later [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] thinkers would maintain that in his choice of water Thales was influenced by Babylonian or Chaldean religion, that held that a god had begun creation by acting upon the pre-existing water. Historian Abraham Feldman holds this does not stand up under closer examination. In Babylonian religion the water is lifeless and sterile until a god acts upon it, but for Thales water itself was divine and creative. He maintained that "All things are full of gods", and to understand the nature of things was to discover the secrets of the deities, and through this knowledge open the possibility that one could be greater than the grandest Olympian.&lt;ref name="Feldman"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Feldman |first=Abraham |title=Thoughts on Thales |journal=[[The Classical Journal]] |volume=41 |date=October 1945 |pages=4–6 |issue=1 |publisher=[[Classical Association of the Middle West and South]] |issn=0009-8353 |jstor=3292119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feldman points out that while other thinkers recognized the wetness of the world "none of them was inspired to conclude that everything was ultimately aquatic."&lt;ref name="Feldman"/&gt; He further points out that Thales was "a wealthy citizen of the fabulously rich Oriental port of Miletus...a dealer in the staples of antiquity, wine and oil...He certainly handled the shell-fish of the Phoenicians that secreted the dye of imperial purple."&lt;ref name="Feldman"/&gt; Feldman recalls the stories of Thales measuring the distance of boats in the harbor, creating mechanical improvements for ship navigation, giving an explanation for the [[flooding of the Nile]] (vital to Egyptian agriculture and Greek trade), and changing the course of the river Halys so an army could ford it. Rather than seeing water as a barrier Thales contemplated the Ionian yearly religious gathering for athletic ritual (held on the promontory of Mycale and believed to be ordained by the ancestral kindred of Poseidon, the god of the sea). He called for the Ionian mercantile states participating in this ritual to convert it into a democratic federation under the protection of Poseidon that would hold off the forces of pastoral Persia. Feldman concludes that Thales saw "that water was a revolutionary leveler and the elemental factor determining the subsistence and business of the world"&lt;ref name="Feldman"/&gt; and "the common channel of states."&lt;ref name="Feldman"/&gt;

Feldman considers Thales' environment and holds that Thales would have seen tears, sweat, and blood as granting value to a person's work and the means how life giving commodities travelled (whether on bodies of water or through the sweat of slaves and pack-animals). He would have seen that minerals could be processed from water such as life-sustaining salt and gold taken from rivers. He would’ve seen fish and other food stuffs gathered from it. Feldman points out that Thales held that the lodestone was alive as it drew metals to itself. He holds that Thales "living ever in sight of his beloved sea" would see water seem to draw all "traffic in wine and oil, milk and honey, juices and dyes" to itself, leading him to "a vision of the universe melting into a single substance that was valueless in itself and still the source of wealth."&lt;ref name="Feldman"/&gt; Feldman concludes that for Thales "...water united all things. The social significance of water in the time of Thales induced him to discern through hardware and dry-goods, through soil and sperm, blood, sweat and tears, one fundamental fluid stuff...water, the most commonplace and powerful material known to him."&lt;ref name="Feldman"/&gt; This combined with his contemporary's idea of "[[spontaneous generation]]" allow us to see how Thales could hold that water could be divine and creative.

Feldman points to the lasting association of the theory that "all whatness is wetness" with Thales himself, pointing out that Diogenes Laërtius speaks of a poem, probably a satire, where Thales is snatched to heaven by the sun, "Perhaps it was an elaborate paronomasia based on the fact that ''thal'' was the Phoenician word for dew."&lt;ref name="Feldman"/&gt;

===Beliefs in divinity===
{{See also|Neopythagoreanism|Neoplatonism}}
Thales applied his method to objects that changed to become other objects, such as water into earth (or so he thought). Thales also applied his method to the act of change itself, approaching it through [[lodestone]] and [[amber]] (which, when electrified by rubbing together, also attracts).{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}  As for the ability of a mover to move something else without being changed itself, Thales saw a commonality between that and the power of a living thing to act. The lodestone and the amber must be alive, and if that were so, there could be no difference between the living and the dead. When asked why he didn’t die if there was no difference, he replied "because there is no difference."{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Aristotle defined the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] as the principle of life, that which imbues the matter and makes it live, giving it the animation, or power to act. The idea did not originate with him, as the Greeks in general believed in the distinction between mind and matter, which was ultimately to lead to a distinction not only between body and soul but also between matter and energy.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}  If things were alive, they must have souls. This belief was no innovation, as the ordinary ancient populations of the Mediterranean did believe that natural actions were caused by divinities. Accordingly, Aristotle and other ancient writers state that Thales believed that "all things were full of gods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Aristotle |author-link=Aristotle |title=[[De Anima]] |page=411a7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kirk |first=G. S. |last2=Raven |first2=J. E. |last3=Schofield |first3=M. |title=The Presocratic Philosophers: A Critical History with a Selection of Texts |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=kFpd86J8PLsC&amp;pg=PA93 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |date=December 29, 1983 |pages=93-97 |isbn=9780521274555}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their zeal to make him the first in everything some said he was the first to hold the belief, which must have been widely known to be false.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}  However, Thales was looking for something more general, a universal substance of mind.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} That also was in the polytheism of the times. [[Zeus]] was the very personification of supreme [[mind]], dominating all the subordinate manifestations. From Thales on, however, philosophers had a tendency to depersonify or objectify mind, as though it were the substance of animation per se and not actually a god like the other gods. The end result was a total removal of mind from substance, opening the door to a non-divine principle of action.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Classical thought, however, had proceeded only a little way along that path. Instead of referring to the person, Zeus, they talked about the great mind:

{{quote| "Thales", says [[Cicero]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cicero |author-link=Cicero |title=[[De Natura Deorum]] |page=i.,10}}&lt;/ref&gt; "assures that ''water'' is the principle of all things; and that God is that Mind which shaped and created all things from water."}}

The universal mind appears as a Roman belief in [[Virgil]] as well:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
In the beginning, SPIRIT within (spiritus intus) strengthens Heaven and Earth,
The watery fields, and the lucid globe of Luna, and then –
Titan stars; and mind (mens) infused through the limbs
Agitates the whole mass, and mixes itself with GREAT MATTER (magno corpore)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Virgil |author-link=Virgil |title=[[Aeneid]] |chapter=vi |pages=724-727}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

According to [[Henry Fielding]], [[Diogenes Laërtius]] (1.35) affirmed that Thales posed "the independent pre-existence of God from all eternity, stating "that God was the oldest of all beings, for he existed without a previous cause even in the way of generation; that the world was the most beautiful of all things; for it was created by God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fielding |first=Henry |author-link=Henry Fielding |year=1775 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C2RVAAAAcAAJ |title=An essay on conversation |publisher=[[John Bell (publisher)|John Bell]] |page=346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reputation==
Thales (who died around 30&amp;nbsp;years before the time of [[Pythagoras]] and 300&amp;nbsp;years before [[Euclid]], [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]], and [[Eudemus of Rhodes]]) is often hailed as "the first Greek mathematician".&lt;ref name="gazette"/&gt; While some historians, such as Colin R. Fletcher, point out that there could have been a predecessor to Thales who would've been named in Eudemus' lost book  ''History of Geometry'' it is admitted that without the work "the question becomes mere speculation."&lt;ref name="gazette"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fletcher |first=Colin R. |title= Thales—our founder? |journal=The Mathematical Gazette |publisher=The Mathematical Association |volume=66 |date=December 1982 |page=267 |issue=438}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fletcher holds that as there is no viable predecessor to the title of first Greek mathematician, the only question is whether Thales qualifies as a practitioner in that field; he holds that "Thales had at his command the techniques of observation, experimentation, superposition and deduction…he has proved himself mathematician."&lt;ref name="gazette"/&gt;

The evidence for the primacy of Thales comes to us from a book by [[Proclus]] who wrote a thousand years after Thales but is believed to have had a copy of Eudemus' book. Proclus wrote "Thales was the first to go to Egypt and bring back to Greece this study."&lt;ref name="gazette"/&gt; He goes on to tell us that in addition to applying the knowledge he gained in Egypt "He himself discovered many propositions and disclosed the underlying principles of many others to his successors, in some case his method being more general, in others more empirical."&lt;ref name="gazette"/&gt;

Other quotes from Proclus list more of Thales' mathematical achievements:

{{quote|They say that Thales was the first to demonstrate that the circle is bisected by the diameter, the cause of the bisection being the unimpeded passage of the straight line through the centre.&lt;ref name="gazette"/&gt;}}

{{quote|[Thales] is said to have been the first to have known and to have enunciated [the theorem] that the angles at the base of any isosceles triangle are equal, though in the more archaic manner he described the equal angles as similar.&lt;ref name="gazette"/&gt;}}

{{quote|This theorem, that when two straight lines cut one another, the vertical and opposite angles are equal, was first discovered, as Eudemus says, by Thales, though the scientific demonstration was improved by the [[Euclid|writer of ''Elements'']].&lt;ref name="gazette"/&gt;}}

{{quote|Eudemus in his ''History of Geometry'' attributes this theorem [the equality of triangles having two angles and one side equal] to Thales. For he says that the method by which Thales showed how to find the distance of ships at sea necessarily involves this method.&lt;ref name="gazette"/&gt;}}

{{quote|[[Pamphile of Epidaurus|Pamphila]] says that, having learnt geometry from the Egyptians, he [Thales] was the first to inscribe in a circle a right-angled triangle, whereupon he [[Animal sacrifice|sacrificed an ox]].&lt;ref name="gazette"/&gt;}}

In addition to Proclus, [[Hieronymus of Rhodes]] also cites Thales as the first Greek mathematician. Hieronymus held that Thales was able to measure the height of the pyramids by using a [[theorem]] of geometry now known as the [[intercept theorem#Measuring/Survey|intercept theorem]], (after gathering data by using his walking-stick and comparing its shadow to those cast by the pyramids). We receive variations of Hieronymus' story through [[Diogenes Laërtius]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Laërtius|1925|loc=§27}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the Elder]], and [[Plutarch]].
&lt;ref name="gazette"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Moralia, The Dinner of the Seven Wise Men, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Dinner_of_the_Seven*.html#ref5 147A]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the variations among testimonies, such as the "story of the sacrifice of an ox on the occasion of the discovery that the angle on a diameter of a circle is a right angle" in the version told by Diogenes Laërtius being accredited to Pythagoras rather than Thales, some historians (such as D. R. Dicks) question whether such anecdotes have any historical worth whatsoever.&lt;ref name="Dicks"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dicks |first=D. R. |title=Thales |pages=294–309 |journal=The Classical Quarterly |volume=9 |date=November 1959 |issue=2 |doi=10.1017/S0009838800041586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
Due to the scarcity of sources concerning Thales and the diversity among the ones we possess, there is a scholarly debate over possible influences on Thales and the Greek mathematicians that came after him.

Historian Roger L. Cooke points out that Proclus does not make any mention of Mesopotamian influence on Thales or Greek geometry, but "is shown clearly in Greek astronomy, in the use of sexagesimal system of measuring angles and in Ptolemy's explicit use of Mesopotamian astronomical observations."&lt;ref name="Cooke"/&gt; Cooke notes that it may possibly also appear in the second book of Euclid's ''Elements'', "which contains geometric constructions equivalent to certain algebraic relations that are frequently encountered in the cuneiform tablets." Cooke notes "This relation however, is controversial."&lt;ref name="Cooke"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cooke |first=Roger L. |title=The History of Mathematics: A Brief Course |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Bartel Leendert van der Waerden|B.L. Van der Waerden]] is among those advocating the idea of Mesopotamian influence, writing "It follows that we have to abandon the traditional belief that the oldest Greek mathematicians discovered geometry entirely by themselves…a belief that was tenable only as long as nothing was known about Babylonian mathematics. This in no way diminishes the stature of Thales; on the contrary, his genius receives only now the honour that is due to it, the honour of having developed a logical structure for geometry, of having introduced proof into geometry."&lt;ref name="gazette"/&gt;

Some historians, such as D. R. Dicks takes issue with the idea that we can determine from the questionable sources we have, just how influenced Thales was by Babylonian sources. He points out that while Thales is held to have been able to calculate an eclipse using a cycle called the "Saros" held to have been "borrowed from the Babylonians", "The Babylonians, however, did not use cycles to predict solar eclipses, but computed them from observations of the latitude of the moon made shortly before the expected syzygy."&lt;ref name="Dicks"/&gt; Dicks cites historian O. Neugebauer who relates that "No Babylonian theory for predicting solar eclipse existed at 600&amp;nbsp;B.C., as one can see from the very unsatisfactory situation 400&amp;nbsp;years later; nor did the Babylonians ever develop any theory which took the influence of geographical latitude into account." Dicks examines the cycle referred to as  'Saros' - which Thales is held to have used and which is believed to stem from the Babylonians. He points out that Ptolemy makes use of this and another cycle in his book ''Mathematical Syntaxis'' but attributes it to Greek astronomers earlier than [[Hipparchus]] and not to Babylonians.&lt;ref name="Dicks"/&gt; Dicks notes Herodotus does relate that Thales made use of a cycle to predict the eclipse, but maintains that "if so, the fulfillment of the 'prediction' was a stroke of pure luck not science".&lt;ref name="Dicks"/&gt; He goes further joining with other historians (F. Martini, J.L. E. Dreyer, O. Neugebauer) in rejecting the historicity of the eclipse story altogether.&lt;ref name="Dicks"/&gt; Dicks links the story of Thales discovering the cause for a solar eclipse with Herodotus' claim that Thales discovered the cycle of the sun with relation to the solstices, and concludes "he could not possibly have possessed this knowledge which neither the Egyptians nor the Babylonians nor his immediate successors possessed."&lt;ref name="Dicks"/&gt; Josephus is the only ancient historian that claims Thales visited Babylonia.

Herodotus wrote that the Greeks learnt the practice of dividing the day into 12 parts, about the ''polos'', and the [[gnomon]] from the Babylonians. (The exact meaning of his use of the word ''polos'' is unknown, current theories include: "the heavenly dome", "the tip of the axis of the celestial sphere", or a spherical concave sundial.) Yet even Herodotus' claims on Babylonian influence are contested by some modern historians, such as L. Zhmud, who points out that the division of the day into twelve parts (and by analogy the year) was known to the Egyptians already in the second millennium, the gnomon was known to both Egyptians and Babylonians, and the idea of the "heavenly sphere" was not used outside of Greece at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zhmud |first=Leonid |title=The Origin of the History of Science in Classical Antiquity |publisher=Die Deutsche Bibliothek |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less controversial than the position that Thales learnt Babylonian mathematics is the claim he was influenced by Egyptians. Pointedly historian S. N. Bychkov holds that the idea that the base angles of an isosceles triangle are equal likely came from Egypt. This is because, when building a roof for a home - having a cross section be exactly an isosceles triangle isn't crucial (as it's the ridge of the roof that must fit precisely), in contrast a symmetric square pyramid cannot have errors in the base angles of the faces or they will not fit together tightly.&lt;ref name="Cooke"/&gt;
Historian D.R. Dicks agrees that compared to the Greeks in the era of Thales, there was a more advanced state of mathematics among the Babylonians and especially the Egyptians - "both cultures knew the correct formulae for determining the areas and volumes of simple geometrical figures such as triangles, rectangles, trapezoids, etc.; the Egyptians could also calculate correctly the volume of the frustum of a pyramid with a square base (the Babylonians used an incorrect formula for this), and used a formula for the area of a circle...which gives a value for [[Pi|π]] of 3.1605--a good approximation."&lt;ref name="Dicks"/&gt; Dicks also agrees that this would have had an effect on Thales (whom the most ancient sources agree was interested in mathematics and astronomy) but he holds that tales of Thales' travels in these lands are pure myth.

The ancient civilization and massive monuments of Egypt had "a profound and ineradicable impression on the Greeks". They attributed to Egyptians "an immemorial knowledge of certain subjects" (including geometry) and would claim Egyptian origin for some of their own ideas to try and lend them "a respectable antiquity" (such as the [[Hermetica|"Hermetic" literature]] of the Alexandrian period).&lt;ref name="Dicks"/&gt;

Dicks holds that since Thales was a prominent figure in Greek history by the time of Eudemus but "nothing certain was known except that he lived in Miletus".&lt;ref name="Dicks"/&gt;  A tradition developed that as "Milesians were in a position to be able to travel widely" Thales must have gone to Egypt.&lt;ref name="Dicks"/&gt; As Herodotus says Egypt was the birthplace of geometry he must have learnt that while there. Since he had to have been there, surely one of the theories on Nile Flooding laid out by Herodotus must have come from Thales. Likewise as he must have been in Egypt he had to have done something with the Pyramids - thus the tale of measuring them. Similar apocryphal stories exist of Pythagoras and Plato traveling to Egypt with no corroborating evidence.

As the Egyptian and Babylonian geometry at the time was "essentially arithmetical", they used actual numbers and "the procedure is then described with explicit instructions as to what to do with these numbers" there was no mention of how the rules of procedure were made, and nothing toward a logically arranged corpus of generalized geometrical knowledge with analytical 'proofs' such as we find in the words of Euclid, Archimedes, and Apollonius."&lt;ref name="Dicks"/&gt; So even had Thales traveled there he could not have learnt anything about the theorems he is held to have picked up there (especially because there is no evidence that any Greeks of this age could use Egyptian hieroglyphics).&lt;ref name="Dicks"/&gt;

Likewise until around the second century BC and the time of Hipparchus (c. 194-120&amp;nbsp;BC) the Babylonian general division of the circle into 360&amp;nbsp;degrees and their sexagesimal system was unknown.&lt;ref name="Dicks"/&gt;  Herodotus says almost nothing about Babylonian literature and science, and very little about their history. Some historians, like P. Schnabel, hold that the Greeks only learned more about Babylonian culture from Berossus, a Babylonian priest who is said to have set up a school in Cos around 270&amp;nbsp;BC (but to what extent this had in the field of geometry is contested).

Dicks points out that the primitive state of Greek mathematics and astronomical ideas exhibited by the peculiar notions of Thales' successors (such as Anaximander, Anaximenes, Xenophanes, and Heraclitus), which historian J. L. Heiberg calls "a mixture of brilliant intuition and childlike analogies",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gesch |first=J. L. |title=D. Math. Und Naturwiss. im Altertum |location=Munich |year=1925 |page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues against the assertions from writers in late antiquity that Thales discovered and taught advanced concepts in these fields.

[[John Burnet (classicist)|John Burnet]] (1892) noted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burnet |first=John |url=https://archive.org/details/earlygreekphilo01burngoog |title=Early Greek Philosophy |page=29 |year=1892}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Lastly, we have one admitted instance of a philosophic guild, that of the [[Pythagoreans]]. And it will be found that the hypothesis, if it is to be called by that name, of a regular organisation of scientific activity will alone explain all the facts. The development of doctrine in the hands of ''Thales'', [[Anaximander]], and [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]], for instance, can only be understood as the elaboration of a single idea in a school with a continuous tradition.}}

== Interpretations ==
In the long sojourn of philosophy, there has existed hardly a philosopher or historian of philosophy who did not mention Thales and try to characterize him in some way. He is generally recognized as having brought something new to human thought. Mathematics, astronomy, and medicine already existed. Thales added something to these different collections of knowledge to produce a universality, which, as far as writing tells us, was not in tradition before, but resulted in a new field.

Ever since, interested persons have been asking what that new something is. Answers fall into (at least) two categories, the theory and the method. Once an answer has been arrived at, the next logical step is to ask how Thales compares to other philosophers, which leads to his classification (rightly or wrongly).

===Theory===
The most natural epithets of Thales are "[[materialist]]" and "[[Metaphysical naturalism|naturalist]]", which are based on ousia and physis. The [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] notes that Aristotle called him a physiologist, with the meaning "student of nature."&lt;ref&gt;Turner, ''Catholic Encyclopedia''.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, he would have qualified as an early [[physicist]], as did Aristotle. They studied corpora, "bodies", the medieval descendants of substances.

Most agree that Thales' stamp on thought is the unity of substance, hence [[Bertrand Russell]]:&lt;ref&gt;''Wisdom of the West''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The view that all matter is one is quite a reputable scientific hypothesis.

...But it is still a handsome feat to have discovered that a substance remains the same in different [[Phase (matter)|states of aggregation]].}}

Russell was only reflecting an established tradition; for example: [[Nietzsche]], in his ''[[Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks]]'', wrote:&lt;ref&gt;§ 3&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Greek philosophy seems to begin with an absurd notion, with the proposition that ''water'' is the primal origin and the womb of all things. Is it really necessary for us to take serious notice of this proposition? It is, and for three reasons. First, because it tells us something about the primal origin of all things; second, because it does so in language devoid of image or fable, and finally, because contained in it, if only embryonically, is the thought, "all things are one."}}

This sort of materialism, however, should not be confused with deterministic materialism. Thales was only trying to explain the unity observed in the free play of the qualities. The arrival of uncertainty in the modern world made possible a return to Thales; for example, [[John Elof Boodin]] writes ("God and Creation"):

{{quote|We cannot read the universe from the past...}}

Boodin defines an "emergent" materialism, in which the objects of sense emerge uncertainly from the substrate. Thales is the innovator of this sort of materialism.

===Rise of theoretical inquiry===
In the West, Thales represents a new kind of inquiring community as well. [[Edmund Husserl]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Vienna Lecture''&lt;/ref&gt; attempts to capture the new movement as follows. Philosophical man is a "new cultural configuration" based in stepping back from "pregiven tradition" and taking up a rational "inquiry into what is true in itself;" that is, an ideal of truth. It begins with isolated individuals such as Thales, but they are supported and cooperated with as time goes on. Finally the ideal transforms the norms of society, leaping across national borders.

===Classification===
The term "[[Pre-Socratic]]" derives ultimately from the philosopher Aristotle, who distinguished the early philosophers as concerning themselves with substance.

Diogenes Laërtius on the other hand took a strictly geographic and ethnic approach. Philosophers were either Ionian or Italian. He used "Ionian" in a broader sense, including also the Athenian academics, who were not Pre-Socratics. From a philosophic point of view, any grouping at all would have been just as effective. There is no basis for an Ionian or Italian unity. Some scholars, however, concede to Diogenes' scheme as far as referring to an "Ionian" school. There was no such school in any sense.

The most popular approach refers to a Milesian school, which is more justifiable socially and philosophically. They sought for the substance of phenomena and may have studied with each other. Some ancient writers qualify them as Milesioi, "of Miletus."

==Influence on others==
[[File:Louisstgaudens1.jpg|left|thumb|''Thales (Electricity)'', sculpture from "The Progress of Railroading" (1908), main facade of [[Union Station (Washington, DC)]]]]

Thales had a profound influence on other Greek thinkers and therefore on [[Western world|Western]] history. Some believe [[Anaximander]] was a pupil of Thales. Early sources report that one of Anaximander's more famous pupils, [[Pythagoras]], visited Thales as a young man, and that Thales advised him to travel to Egypt to further his philosophical and mathematical studies.

Many philosophers followed Thales' lead in searching for explanations in [[nature]] rather than in the supernatural; others returned to supernatural explanations, but couched them in the language of philosophy rather than of myth or of [[religion]].

Looking specifically at Thales' influence during the pre-Socratic era, it is clear that he stood out as one of the first thinkers who thought more in the way of ''[[logos]]'' than ''[[Mythology|mythos]]''. The difference between these two more profound ways of seeing the world is that ''mythos'' is concentrated around the stories of holy origin, while ''logos'' is concentrated around the argumentation. When the mythical man wants to explain the world the way he sees it, he explains it based on gods and powers. Mythical thought does not differentiate between things and persons{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} and furthermore it does not differentiate between nature and culture{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}. The way a ''logos'' thinker would present a world view is radically different from the way of the mythical thinker. In its concrete form, ''logos'' is a way of thinking not only about individualism{{Clarify|date=July 2009}}, but also the abstract{{Clarify|date=July 2009}}. Furthermore, it focuses on sensible and continuous argumentation. This lays the foundation of [[philosophy]] and its way of explaining the world in terms of abstract argumentation, and not in the way of gods and mythical stories{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}.

==Reliability of sources==
[[File:Nuremberg chronicles f 59r 2.png|thumb|180px|Thales, [[Nuremberg Chronicle]].]]

Because of Thales' elevated status in Greek culture an intense interest and admiration followed his reputation. Due to this following, the oral stories about his life were open to amplification and historical fabrication, even before they were written down generations later. Most modern dissension comes from trying to interpret what we know, in particular, distinguishing legend from fact.

Historian D.R. Dicks and other historians divide the ancient sources about Thales into those before 320&amp;nbsp;BC and those after that year (some such as [[Proclus]] writing in the 5th century C.E. and [[Simplicius of Cilicia]] in the 6th century C.E. writing nearly a millennium after his era).&lt;ref name="Dicks"/&gt; The first category includes [[Herodotus]], [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Aristophanes]], and [[Theophrastus]] among others. The second category includes [[Plautus]], [[Aetius (philosopher)|Aetius]], [[Eusebius]], [[Plutarch]], [[Josephus]], [[Iamblichus]], [[Diogenes Laërtius]], [[Theon of Smyrna]], [[Apuleius]], [[Clement of Alexandria]], [[Pliny the Elder]], and [[John Tzetzes]] among others.

The earliest sources on Thales (living before 320&amp;nbsp;BC) are often the same for the other [[Milesian school|Milesian philosophers]] ([[Anaximander]], and [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]]). These sources were either roughly contemporaneous (such as [[Herodotus]]) or lived within a few hundred years of his passing. Moreover, they were writing from an oral tradition that was widespread and well known in the Greece of their day.

The latter sources on Thales are several  "ascriptions of commentators and compilers who lived anything from 700 to 1,000&amp;nbsp;years after his death"&lt;ref name="Dicks"/&gt; which include "anecdotes of varying degrees of plausibility"&lt;ref name="Dicks"/&gt; and in the opinion of some historians (such as D. R. Dicks) of "no historical worth whatsoever".&lt;ref name="Dicks"/&gt; Dicks points out that there is no agreement "among the 'authorities' even on the most fundamental facts of his life--e.g. whether he was a Milesian or a Phoenician, whether he left any writings or not, whether he was married or single-much less on the actual ideas and achievements with which he is credited."&lt;ref name="Dicks"/&gt;

Contrasting the work of the more ancient writers with those of the later, Dicks points out that in the works of the early writers Thales and the other men who would be hailed as "the Seven Sages of Greece" had a different reputation than that which would be assigned to them by later authors. Closer to their own era, Thales, [[Solon]], [[Bias of Priene]], [[Pittacus of Mytilene]] and others were hailed as "essentially practical men who played leading roles in the affairs of their respective states, and were far better known to the earlier Greeks as lawgivers and statesmen than as profound thinkers and philosophers."&lt;ref name="Dicks"/&gt; For example, Plato praises him (coupled with [[Anacharsis]]) for being the originator of the potter's wheel and the anchor.

Only in the writings of the second group of writers (working after 320&amp;nbsp;BC) do "we obtain the picture of Thales as the pioneer in Greek scientific thinking, particularly in regard to mathematics and astronomy which he is supposed to have learnt about in Babylonia and Egypt."&lt;ref name="Dicks"/&gt; Rather than "the earlier tradition [where] he is a favourite example of the intelligent man who possesses some technical 'know how'...the later [[Doxography|doxographers]] [such as [[Dicaearchus]] in the latter half of the fourth century BC] foist on to him any number of discoveries and achievements, in order to build him up as a figure of superhuman wisdom."&lt;ref name="Dicks"/&gt;

Dicks points out a further problem arises in the surviving information on Thales, for rather than using ancient sources closer to the era of Thales, the authors in later antiquity ("epitomators, excerptors, and compilers"&lt;ref name="Dicks"/&gt;) actually "preferred to use one or more intermediaries, so that what we actually read in them comes to us not even at second, but at third or fourth or fifth hand. ...Obviously this use of intermediate sources, copied and recopied from century to century, with each writer adding additional pieces of information of greater or less plausibility from his own knowledge, provided a fertile field for errors in transmission, wrong ascriptions, and fictitious attributions".&lt;ref name="Dicks"/&gt; Dicks points out that "certain doctrines that later commentators invented for Thales...were then accepted into the biographical tradition" being copied by subsequent writers who were then cited by those coming after them "and thus, because they may be repeated by different authors relying on different sources, may produce an illusory impression of genuineness."&lt;ref name="Dicks"/&gt;

Doubts even exist when considering the philosophical positions held to originate in Thales "in reality these stem directly from Aristotle's own interpretations which then became incorporated in the doxographical tradition as erroneous ascriptions to Thales".&lt;ref name="Dicks"/&gt; (The same treatment was given by Aristotle to [[Anaxagoras]].)

Most philosophic analyses of the philosophy of Thales come from [[Aristotle]], a professional philosopher, tutor of [[Alexander the Great]], who wrote 200&amp;nbsp;years after Thales' death. Aristotle, judging from his surviving books, does not seem to have access to any works by Thales, although he probably had access to works of other authors about Thales, such as [[Herodotus]], [[Hecataeus of Miletus|Hecataeus]], [[Plato]] etc., as well as others whose work is now extinct. It was Aristotle's express goal to present Thales' work not because it was significant in itself, but as a prelude to his own work in natural philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;See Aristotle, Metaphysics Alpha, 983b 1-27.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geoffrey Kirk]] and [[John Raven]], English compilers of the fragments of the Pre-Socratics, assert that Aristotle's "judgments are often distorted by his view of earlier philosophy as a stumbling progress toward the truth that Aristotle himself revealed in his physical doctrines."&lt;ref&gt;Kirk and Raven, The Presocratic Philosophers, Second Edition (Cambridge University Press, 1983) 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  There was also an extensive oral tradition. Both the oral and the written were commonly read or known by all educated men in the region.

Aristotle's philosophy had a distinct stamp: it professed the theory of matter and form, which modern scholastics have dubbed [[hylomorphism]]. Though once very widespread, it was not generally adopted by [[rationalist]] and modern science, as it mainly is useful in [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] analyses, but does not lend itself to the detail that is of interest to modern science. It is not clear that the theory of matter and form existed as early as Thales, and if it did, whether Thales espoused it.

While some historians, like B. Snell, maintain that Aristotle was relying on a pre-Platonic written record by [[Hippias]] rather than oral tradition, this is a controversial position. Representing the scholarly consensus Dicks states that "the tradition about him even as early as the fifth century B.C., was evidently based entirely on hearsay....It would seem that already by Aristotle's time the early Ionians were largely names only to which popular tradition attached various ideas or achievements with greater or less plausibility".&lt;ref name="Dicks"/&gt; He points out that works confirmed to have existed in the sixth century BC by Anaximander and Xenophanes had already disappeared by the fourth century BC, so the chances of Pre-Socratic material surviving to the age of Aristotle is almost nil (even less likely for Aristotle's pupils Theophrastus and Eudemus and less likely still for those following after them).

The main secondary source concerning the details of Thales' life and career is [[Diogenes Laërtius]], "''[[Lives of Eminent Philosophers]]''".&lt;ref&gt;Translation of his biography on Thales: [http://www.classicpersuasion.org/pw/diogenes/dlthales.htm Thales], classicpersuasion site; original Greek text, under [http://www.mikrosapoplous.gr/dl/dl01.html#thales ΘΑΛΗΣ], the Library of Ancient Texts Online site.&lt;/ref&gt; This is primarily a biographical work, as the name indicates. Compared to Aristotle, Diogenes is not much of a philosopher. He is the one who, in the Prologue to that work, is responsible for the division of the early philosophers into "Ionian" and "Italian", but he places the Academics in the Ionian school and otherwise evidences considerable disarray and contradiction, especially in the long section on forerunners of the "Ionian School". Diogenes quotes two letters attributed to Thales, but Diogenes wrote some eight centuries after Thales' death and that his sources often contained "unreliable or even fabricated information",&lt;ref&gt;See {{Cite book |last=McKirahan |first=Richard D., Jr. |year=1994 |title=Philosophy Before Socrates |location=Indianapolis |publisher=Hackett |page=5 |isbn=0-87220-176-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; hence the concern for separating fact from legend in accounts of Thales.

It is due to this use of hearsay and a lack of citing original sources that leads some historians, like Dicks and Werner Jaeger, to look at the late origin of the traditional picture of Pre-Socratic philosophy and view the whole idea as a construct from a later age, "the whole picture that has come down to us of the history of early philosophy was fashioned during the two or three generations from Plato to the immediate pupils of Aristotle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jaeger |first=Werner |title=Aristotle |edition=2nd |year=1948 |page=454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Fatal Conceit: The Errors of Socialism''''' (1988) is a non-fiction book written by the economist and political philosopher [[Friedrich Hayek]] and edited by [[William Warren Bartley]]. Bruce Caldwell has questioned how far Bartley was the editor and how far the author.

The title of the book is a reference to a passage from [[Adam Smith]], in his ''[[The Theory of Moral Sentiments]]'' (1759).

==Summary==
In the book, Hayek aims to refute [[socialism]] by demonstrating that socialist theories are not only logically incorrect but that their premises are also incorrect. According to Hayek, civilizations grew because societal traditions placed importance on [[private property]], leading to expansion, trade, and eventually the modern capitalist system, which he calls the [[extended order]].&lt;ref&gt;Hayek, F.A. "The Fatal Conceit: The Errors of Socialism". The University of Chicago Press. 1991. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Hayek says this demonstrates a key flaw within socialist thought, which holds only purposefully designed changes can be the most efficient. Also, he says statist (e.g., "socialist") economies cannot be efficient because dispersed knowledge is required in a modern economy. Additionally, Hayek asserts that since modern civilization, and all of its customs and traditions, naturally led to the current order and are needed for its continuance, fundamental changes to the system that try to control it are doomed to fail since they are impossible or unsustainable in modern civilization. [[Price signals]] are the only means of enabling each economic decision maker to communicate [[tacit knowledge]] or [[dispersed knowledge]] with each other to solve the [[economic calculation problem]].

==Controversy==
There is scholarly debate on the extent of [[William Warren Bartley]]'s influence on the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libertyunbound.com/archive/2005_03/ebenstein-deceit.html|title=The Fatal Deceit|author=Alan Ebenstein|publisher=[[Liberty (1987)|Liberty]]|accessdate=2008-07-06 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080622201757/http://libertyunbound.com/archive/2005_03/ebenstein-deceit.html |archivedate = 2008-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officially, Bartley was the editor who prepared the book for publication once Hayek fell ill in 1985. However, the inclusion of material from Bartley's philosophical point of view and citations that other people provided to Bartley&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Friedman|first=Jeffrey|year=1998|title=What's Wrong with Libertarianism?|journal=Critical Review|volume=Summer 1998|page=463}}&lt;/ref&gt; have led to questions about how much of the book was written by Hayek and whether Hayek knew about the added material. Bruce Caldwell thinks the evidence "clearly points towards a conclusion that the book was a product more of [Bartley's] pen than of Hayek's. ... Bartley may have written the book".&lt;ref&gt;''Karl Popper, a Centenary Assessment Vol. 1: Life and Times, and Values in a World of Facts'', p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:Japanese words and phrases]]}}
{{nihongo|'''''Utamakura'''''|歌枕||extra="poem pillow"}} is a [[rhetoric]]al concept in [[Japanese poetry]].

==Definition==

''Utamakura'' is a category of poetic words, often involving place names, that allow for greater [[allusion]]s and [[intertextuality]] across Japanese poems.

''Utamakura'' includes locations familiar to the court of ancient Japan, such as
* particularly sacred [[Shinto]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] sites,
* places where historic events occurred, and
* places that trigger a separate mental association through a pun.

==Aesthetic function==

''Utamakura'' serve as a significant tool to achieve yugen (mystery and depth) in Japanese poetry by adding profundity and indirect beauty in poems. It can be used as a source for identifying significant figures and places in ancient Japan. ''Utamakura'' enables poets to express ideas and themes concisely — thus allowing them to stay in the confines of strict waka structures.

Some scholars see the use of geographical allusion as the evidence for a restricted scope of poetry writing. Although the poets' "true" meaning was true because the essence was initially pre-established, the poems were written within fixed topics (''dai''). The poet could inhabit a subjective position or persona and write about the topic but not necessarily about his/her personal feelings. ''Utamakura'' could have suppressed poets' individuality or creativity.

==History==

The history of ''utamakura'' is found in documents on the study of poetry such as the ''Utamakura of [[Noin]]'', by the poet and monk of the late Heian period, and lists of places in the ''Utamakura Nayose'' (Utamakura reference book).

''Utamakura'' were first used by traveling priests.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} They collected stories from the towns they traveled to. Since they saw many places, it was easier to remember the details of a story by using a single, consistent reference point for each recurring event in their tales. Over time, the people across the Japan came to identify ''utamakura'' place names by the psychological feelings associated with the references made by the wandering priests.

After ''utamakura'' place names and people had become well established, eager waka poets went sightseeing to the sites of ''utamakura''. Beyond becoming familiar with the scenery of the poems, entering the locale of a poem or story deepened one's understanding of it.

''Utamakura'' was also used in ''[[renga]]'', a form of Japanese [[collaborative poetry]] that is the ancestor of ''[[renku]]'' and ''[[haiku]]'' poetry.

==Examples==

There are numerous instances of ''utamakura'' in Japanese literature, one of which is the ''[[Kokin Wakashū|Kokinshū]]''. The source of this particular ''utamakura'' example is poem #3 in the "Spring" section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Kokin Wakashū |chapter=Spring. No. 3|url=http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/ot2www-japanese?specfile=/web/data/japanese/search/japanese.o2w&amp;act=surround&amp;lang=en&amp;offset=44095026&amp;id=CookKok&amp;query=Where+are+the+promised |work=[[University of Virginia Japanese Text Initiative|Japanese Text Initiative]] |publisher=University of Virginia Library |year=2004 |accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the poem above, ''[[Yoshino, Nara|Yoshino]]'' refers to a place in the [[Yamato Province|Yamato region]] in the vicinity of the capital. ''Yoshino'' is known for having both heavy snowfall and an abundance of cherry blossoms.

Poem #1 in "Spring 1" of ''[[Shin Kokin Wakashū]]'' also uses ''Yoshino'' for depicting the beginning of spring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Shinkokinshu |url=http://etext.virginia.edu/japanese/shinkokinshu/index.html |work=[[University of Virginia Japanese Text Initiative|Japanese Text Initiative]] |publisher=University of Virginia Library |date=1 August 1999 |accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carter1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carter|first=Steven D.|title=Traditional Japanese Poetry: An Anthology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dq7TOrkTCP0C&amp;pg=PA510|year=1993|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-2212-4|page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another instance of poetic place name comes from ''[[Tales of Ise]]'', a piece titled "In the Provinces" (#15).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ise Monogatari |url=http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/japanese/ise/index.html |work=Japanese Text Initiative |publisher=University of Virginia Library |date=11 November 1998 |accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McCullough |first=Helen Craig |title=Tales of Ise: Lyrical Episodes from Tenth - Century Japan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Ol_MOUZmpMC|year=1968 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0-8047-0653-7 |page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mount Shinobu'' is a pun on the verb ''shinobu,'' meaning "to conceal," "endure," "long for," and "remember."

===Contemporary examples===

In Japan there are many examples of ''utamakura'' in everyday readings. Often, menu items will be named after their visual appearance with a reference to a well-known Japanese scenic area.

For example, the Tatsuta River is famous for its red autumn maples. Therefore, a menu that includes tatsuta age will have crispy fish or chicken that was marinated in soy sauce before it was dredged in cornstarch and deep fried. The cornstarch coating absorbs some of the soy, so that when it is fried it takes on a burnished, russet color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Andoh|first=Elizabeth|title=Japanese Menu Names|url=http://www.bento.com/ta-name.html|accessdate=28 July 2013|newspaper=Daily Yomiuri|date=8 November 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parallels in other cultures==

''Utamakura'' can be described as "descriptive epithets" or "circumlocutions designating geographical sites" in poetry of other languages that conjure a memory, thought, image or association with the place referred to.

In [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy#Inferno|Inferno]]'' (Canto VII, line 106) there is a poetic place name in reference to the river [[Styx]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
A lake is form'd, (the Stygian named of old)
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;By this sad stream, when downward it hath run
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Neath the grey rocks that hem the baleful hold.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The adjective Stygian means "of or relating to the River Styx". In [[Ancient Greek literature]], the River Styx forms the boundary between Earth and [[Hades]], the Underworld.

In contemporary Western cultures, parallels to the Japanese ''utamakura'' can be found in many popular songs. Musicians use place names in their lyrics to invoke certain conformed thoughts.

California is a common reference for artists in that it invokes thoughts of excess, splendor, wealth, and a sense of fakeness in body and spirit. [[Weezer]] references the excessiveness of Beverly Hills in their hit song "Beverly Hills", while the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] refer to the sense of things not being "real" in their song "Californication" by including lyrics about plastic surgery and the use of Hollywood sets in government conspiracy.

{{italic title}}
The '''''Wenzi''''' ({{zh|c=文子|p=Wénzǐ|w=Wen-tzu|l=[Book of] Master Wen}}) is a [[Daoist]] classic allegedly written by a disciple of [[Laozi]]. The text was widely read and highly revered in the centuries following its creation, and even canonized as '''''Tongxuan zhenjing''''' ({{zh|c=通玄真經|p=Tōngxuán zhēnjīng|w=T'ung-hsuan chen-ching|l= True Scripture of Understanding the Mysteries}}) in the year 742 CE. However, soon afterwards scholars started questioning its authenticity and dismissing it as a forgery that was created between the [[Han dynasty]] and the [[Tang dynasty]]. The text's fate changed in 1973, when archeologists excavated a 55 BCE tomb and discovered remnants of a ''Wenzi'' copied on bamboo strips, which offer us a glimpse of what the text looked like prior to its drastic revision into the [[textus receptus]].

==Author==
The title ''Wenzi'' 文子 "Master Wen", suffixed with ''-zi'' [[Wikt:子|子]] "child; person; master (title of respect)",  is analogous with other [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] texts like ''[[Mozi]]'', ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'', [[Guiguzi]], and [[Baopuzi]]. Wen [[Wikt:文|文]] "written character; literature; refinement; culture" is an infrequent [[Chinese surname]], and hence Wenzi is interpretable as "Master Wen." Wen is also frequently used in given names, [[posthumous names]], et cetera, due to its positive connotations. For example, [[King Wen of Zhou]] 周文王 or Kong Wenzi 孔文子 (''Analects'' 5.15, tr. Ames and Rosemont 1998:98-99). Hence, Wenzi is also interpretable as a ''nom de plume'' denoting "Master of Literature/Culture." Nothing can be said for certain about Wenzi, no matter how this name is interpreted. Although we do not know his true identity, various hypotheses have been proposed.

The bibliographical section of the 1st century CE ''[[Book of Han]]'' says Wenzi was a student of Laozi, a contemporary of [[Confucius]] 孔子 (551-479 BCE), and an adviser to [[King Ping of Zhou]] 周平王 (r. 770-720 BCE). This cannot be true, as King Ping and Confucius lived two centuries apart, and it fueled suspicion of the text's forged status in later centuries. To solve the chronological inconsistency, some commentators suggest a mistake for King Ping of [[Chu (state)|Chu]] 楚平王 (r. 528-516 BCE), whose reign does coincide with Confucius' lifetime.

The early ''Wenzi'' commentary by Li Xian 李暹 ([[floruit|fl.]] 516 CE) records that Wenzi's surname was Xin 辛 and his [[sobriquet]] (''hao'' [[Wikt:號|號]]) was Jiran 計然, he served under [[Fan Li]] 范蠡 (fl. 517 BCE), and studied with Laozi.

The later ''Wenzi'' commentary by Du Daojian (1237-1318) furthermore notes Wenzi was a nobleman from the [[Spring and Autumn period]] state of [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin]], his surname was Xin 辛 and [[courtesy name]] (''zi'' [[Wikt:字|字]]) was Xing 銒. He was also called Song Xing 宋銒 referring to his home of Kuiqiu 葵丘, which was in [[Song (state)]].

==Received Text==

Written references to the ''Wenzi'' first appear in the Han Dynasty. The no longer extant 1st century BCE ''Qilue'' 七略 "Seven Summaries" by [[Liu Xiang (scholar)|Liu Xiang]] and [[Liu Xin (scholar)|Liu Xin]] said the ''Wenzi'' had 9 ''pian'' 篇 "chapters". The bibliographical section of the 1st century CE ''[[Book of Han]]'' records the ''Wenzi'' text in 9 ''juan'' 卷 "rolls; volumes", says Wenzi was a student of Laozi, a contemporary of [[Confucius]] (551-479 BCE), and adviser to [[King Ping of Zhou]] (r. 770-720 BCE), but adds "the work appears to be a forgery" (tr. Sakade 2007:1041), presumably because King Ping and Confucius lived two centuries apart.

In his ca. 523 CE ''Qilu'' 七录錄 "Seven Records", the [[Liang Dynasty]] scholar Ruan Xiaoxu 阮孝绪 records the ''Wenzi'' text in 10 volumes. Bibliographies in the 636 CE [[Book of Sui]] and the 945 CE [[New Book of Tang]] both record 12 volumes.

In 742 CE, [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang]] canonized the ''Wenzi'' as a Daoist scripture (along with the ''[[Daode jing]]'', ''Zhuangzi'', and ''[[Liezi]]'') honorifically called the ''Tongxuan zhenjing'' 通玄真經 "True Scripture of Understanding the Mysteries". The emperor posthumously styled Wenzi as the Tongxuan [[Zhenren]] 通玄真人 "True Man Who Understands the Mysteries".

The [[Daozang]] "Daoist Canon" includes three ''Wenzi'' redactions under the ''Yujue'' 玉訣 "Commentaries" subsection of the ''Dongshen'' 洞神 "Spirit Grotto" section. The oldest extant edition is the ''Tongxuan zhenjing zhu'' 通玄真經注 "Commentary on the Authentic Scripture of Pervading Mystery" by Xu Lingfu 徐灵府 (ca. 760-841) of the [[Tang Dynasty]]. The ''Tongxuan zhenjing zhengyi zhu'' 通玄真經正儀注 "Commentary on the Correct Meaning of the Authentic Scripture of Pervading Mystery" is by [[Zhu Bian]] (ca. 1085-1144) of the [[Song Dynasty]]. Third is the 1310 CE ''Tongxuan zhenjing zuanyi'' 通玄真經纘義 "Collected Explanations to the Authentic Scripture of Pervading Mystery" by Du Daojian 杜道坚 (1237–1318) of the [[Yuan Dynasty]]. Judith M. Boltz (1987:219) cites the opinion of [[Siku Quanshu]] bibliographers that Du's version was the most reliable ''Wenzi'' redaction. She notes that Du Daojian became the rightful literary heir to Wenzi when he discovered a copy of the classic at the Tongxuan Guan 通玄觀 "Abbey of Pervading Mystery" of Mount Jizhou 計籌 in [[Zhejiang]], where hagiographic legend says Wenzi took refuge and wrote down his teachings.

==Content==
Although the ''Wenzi'' has traditionally been considered a Daoist text illustrating Laozi's thinking, it contains elements from [[Confucianism]], [[Mohism]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], and [[School of Names]]. The textual format records Laozi answering Wenzi's questions about ''[[Daode jing]]'' concepts like ''[[Wu wei]]''. Besides citing passages from Daoist classics like ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' and ''[[Huainanzi]]'', the ''Wenzi'' also cites others like the ''[[Yijing]]'', ''[[Mencius (book)|Mengzi]]'', ''[[Lüshi Chunqiu]]'', and ''[[Xiao Jing]]''. Regarding the received ''Wenzi'' text, Yoshinobu Sakade concludes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;While these references make the ''Wenzi'' appear as a source of ancient thought, in the form we know it today it is a forgery, with about eighty percent of the text quoted from the ''Huainan zi'', and the rest consisting of an amplification of the ''Daode jing'' or quotations from other texts. The present version contains expression similar to those found in the Taoist scriptures … These elements suffice to show that the extant ''Wenzi'' was written between the third and eight centuries, before the time of Xu Lingfu. (2007:1042) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Excavated text==
In 1973, Chinese archeologists excavated a [[Han Dynasty]] tomb near [[Dingzhou]] 定州 (or Dingxian 定縣) in [[Hebei]]. Its occupant is identified as King Huai 懷王 of [[Zhongshan (state)|Zhongshan]], who died in 55 BCE. Tomb furnishings included a precious [[Jade burial suit]], jade ornaments, writing tools, and remnants of eight [[Chinese classic texts]], including the ''Wenzi'' and Confucian ''[[Analects]]'' copied on hundreds of [[Bamboo and wooden slips|bamboo slips]] (''jian'' [[Wikt:簡|簡]]). These bamboo manuscripts were fragmented, disordered, and blackened by fire, perhaps accidentally caused by tomb robbers.

The specialized project of deciphering and transcribing this ancient ''Wenzi'' copy was delayed owing to a 1976 earthquake at [[Tangshan]] that further damaged the Dingzhou bamboo slips. The team published their first report in 1981 and their ''Wenzi'' transcription in 1995 (both in the archeological journal ''Wenwu'' 文物 "Cultural Relics").

Ongoing sinological studies of the so-called Dingzhou ''Wenzi'' (Le Blanc 2000, Ho 2002, van Els 2018) are providing both specific details of the presumed [[urtext edition]] and general insights in the early history of Daoist texts. Portions of the Dingzhou ''Wenzi'' are basically consistent with certain section in chapter 5 of the received text. Consensus is building that this excavated ''Wenzi'' dates from the 2nd century BCE, while the transmitted text was created after the 2nd century CE (van Els 2018:43-47, 129).

The question-and-answer format is a significant difference between the bamboo and received ''Wenzi'' versions. Ames and Rosemont explain:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Consistent with the court bibliography in the ''History of the Han'', the Dingzhou ''Wenzi'' has Wenzi as teacher who is being asked questions by a King Ping of the Zhou 周平王. The received text, on the other hand, has the teacher Laozi 老子 being asked questions by the student Wenzi, certainly less appropriate given that texts are usually named for the teacher rather than the student. (1998:273-4)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Translations==
Compared with the numerous English translations of familiar Daoist texts like the ''Daode jing'' and ''Zhuangzi'', the presumably apocryphal ''Wenzi'' has been disregarded. [[Thomas Cleary]] (1991) wrote a popularized translation of the transmitted ''Wenzi'', which he attributes to [[Laozi]].

There is no authoritative English ''Wenzi'' translation based on the groundbreaking Dingzhou readings, nothing comparable with the ''Analects'' translation by Ames and Rosemont (1998). English translations of select Dingzhou ''Wenzi'' bamboo strips can be found in the monograph by Paul van Els (2018).

'''The Year of the Eucharist''' is the name of the [[liturgical year]] from October 2004 to October 2005, as celebrated by [[Roman Catholics|Catholics]] worldwide. On June 10, 2004, [[Pope John Paul II]] announced the dedication of an entire year to the [[Blessed Sacrament]] and invited the entire Church to reflect upon the [[Eucharist]].

==Opening the Year==
Pope John Paul II stated that the idea came from scheduled events to take place in the following liturgical year. The [[International Eucharistic Congress]] was scheduled for October 10, 2004 to October 17, 2004, and would mark the opening of ''Year of the Eucharist''. The year would close with the ''[[Ordinary Assembly of the Synod of Bishops]]'', held from October 2, 2005 to October 29, 2005.

He stated that the [[World Youth Day 2005]] was another consideration in his decision of the dedication. He said, "I would like the young people to gather around the Eucharist as the vital source which nourishes their faith and enthusiasm." 

Specifically how the year was to be celebrated was left to the particular Churches. However, Pope John Paul II offered some basic guidelines. Suggestions were also presented by the [[Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments]]. In the United States, many dioceses encouraged local parishes to conduct celebrations, to examine the place of the Eucharist in parish life, to encourage [[Eucharistic adoration]] separate from the Mass, and to evaluate how Eucharistic adoration is conducted locally. Many Bishops took the time to encourage their local parishes to institute 40-hour devotions.

==Goals of the Year of the Eucharist==
[[Pope John Paul II]] made several suggestions to the Church in order to help the faithful benefit from the ''Year of the Eucharist''. He called on Catholics to understand the Eucharist as "an urgent summons to testimony and evangelization," providing the necessary strength to carry out the "charge" given at the end of each Mass to spread the Gospel. John Paul II also asked for a commitment to a "culture of the Eucharist," i.e. a commitment to providing witness to God's ''real'' presence in the world.

Another reflection offered by Pope John Paul II is that of the meaning of the word ''[[Eucharist]]'': [[Thanksgiving]]. John Paul II said, "In Jesus, in his sacrifice, in his unconditional 'yes' to the will of the Father, is contained the 'yes', the 'thank you' and the 'amen' of all humanity." He asked for a commitment to giving thanks to God, which he called a "'Eucharistic' attitude."

==Notable events==
Among the many reflections published in honor of the year, Archbishop Alfred C. Hughes' of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans|Archdiocese of New Orleans]] wrote, "On this side of heaven, one cannot experience a more substantial or intense communion with Christ's presence than in the Eucharist."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archdiocese-no.org/eucharist/letter/index.html Archbishop Alfred C. Hughes' Letter on the Year of the Eucharist]&lt;/ref&gt;
This year also saw the death of [[Pope John Paul II]] on April 2, 2005 (the one who established the year itself), and the subsequent election of [[Pope Benedict XVI]] on April 19, 2005.

There was an [[Eucharistic Congress]] in the [[Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception]] in Washington, D.C., on September 25, 2004, the [[homily]] was given by Cardinal [[Francis Arinze]], [[prefect]] of the [[Congregation for Divine Worship]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adoremus.org/Arinze-EuchUnites.html THE HOLY EUCHARIST UNITES HEAVEN AND EARTH] Francis Cardinal Arinze&lt;/ref&gt; The closing Mass was attended by 3,000 Catholics.

'''''Zazen gi''''' ({{CJKV|j=坐禪儀}}), also known in various English translations such as '''''The Standard Method of Zazen''''' or '''''Principles of Zazen''''', is a book of the [[Shōbōgenzō]] by the 13th century [[Sōtō]] [[Zen]] monk [[Eihei Dōgen]]. The book appears tenth in the 75 fascicle version of the [[Shōbōgenzō]], and it is ordered 58th in the later chronological 95 fascicle "''Honzan'' edition".&lt;ref name=textual&gt;{{citation|last=Heine|first=Steven|title=Dōgen: Textual and Historical Studies|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|pages=27, 39|isbn=978-0-19-975447-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was presented to his students in the eleventh month of 1243 at Yoshimine shōja (吉峰精舍), a small temple where Dōgen and his sangha practiced briefly following their sudden move to [[Echizen Province]] from their previous temple [[Kōshōhōrin-ji]] earlier in the same year and before the establishment of [[Eihei-ji]]. Unlike other books of the Shōbōgenzō, it is not as much a commentary on classical [[Chan Buddhism|Chinese Chan literature]] as it is a guide for the practice of [[zazen]]. The title comes from earlier Chinese texts of the same name and purpose, with a well known example found in the ''[[Chanyuan Qinggui|Chanyuan qinggui]]'', from which Dōgen quotes extensively. His more famous ''[[Fukan zazengi]]'', as well as ''[[Eihei shingi]]'''s ''Bendoho'', also owe much to this Chinese text and are thus closely related to the Shōbōgenzō's ''Zazen gi''.&lt;ref name=bielefeldt&gt;{{citation|last=Bielefeldt|first=Carl|title=Kobutsushin: Introduction|year=2005|publisher=Sotoshu Shumucho|url=http://stanford.edu/group/scbs/sztp3/translations/shobogenzo/translations/zazengi/zazengi.intro.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gudo&gt;{{Citation| last1 =Nishijima|first1=Gudo|last2=Cross|first2=Chodo|authorlink1=Gudo Nishijima|year = 2008| title = Master Dogen's Shōbōgenzō| volume=3|pages=225– 227|publisher = Numata Center for Buddhist Translation and Research| isbn=978-1-886439-37-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
