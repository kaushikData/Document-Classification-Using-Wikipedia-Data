'''Abraham Gotthelf Kästner''' {{bdd|September|27|1719|June|20|1800}} was a German [[mathematician]] and [[epigram]]matist.

He was known in his professional life for writing textbooks and compiling encyclopedias rather than for original research.  [[Georg Christoph Lichtenberg]] was one of his doctoral students, and admired the man greatly. He became most well known for his epigrammatic poems. The crater [[Kästner (crater)|Kästner]] on the [[Moon]] is named after him.

== Life ==

Kästner was the son of law professor Abraham Kästner. He married Anna Rosina Baumann in 1757 after a 12-year engagement. She died on 4 March 1758, less than a year later, of a lung disease. Later Kästner had a daughter Catharine with his cleaning lady.

Kästner studied law, philosophy, physics, mathematics and metaphysics in [[Leipzig]] from 1731, and was appointed a [[Notary]] in 1733.  He gained his [[Habilitation]] from the [[University of Leipzig]] in 1739, and lectured there in mathematics, philosophy, logic and law, becoming an associate professor in 1746. In 1751 he was elected a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]. In 1756 he took up a position as full professor of natural philosophy and geometry at the [[University of Göttingen]]. In 1763, succeeding [[Tobias Mayer]], he became director of the observatory as well. One of his doctoral students was the physicist and [[aphorist]] [[Georg Christoph Lichtenberg]], who became a colleague of his at [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]]. Other notable doctoral students were [[Johann Christian Polycarp Erxleben]], [[Johann Pfaff]] (doctoral adviser of [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]), [[Johann Tobias Mayer]], [[Heinrich Wilhelm Brandes]], [[Farkas Bolyai]] (father of [[János Bolyai]]), and [[Georg Klügel]]. Kästner died in 1800 in Göttingen.

== Work ==
[[File:Kästner, Abraham Gotthelf – De habitu matheseos et physicae ad religionem, 1752 – BEIC 1451380.jpg|thumb|''De habitu matheseos et physicae ad religionem'', 1752]]

Kaestner became most well known for his poems, which appeared first in print without his consent in 1781 and were notable for their biting humour and sharp irony on different contemporary personalities.  They were published in ''Vermischten Schriften 1 und 2'' (Altenburg 1783, 2 volumes), and further poems were published in ''Gesammelten poetischen und prosaischen schönwissenschaftlichen Werken'' (Berlin 1841, 4 volumes) and later in [[Joseph Kürschner]]'s ''Deutscher Nationalliteratur'', volume 73 (hrsg. von Minor; Stuttgart 1883).

His numerous mathematical writings include ''Anfangsgründe der Mathematik'' ("Foundations of Mathematics") (Göttingen 1758-69, 4 volumes; 6th edition 1800) and ''Geschichte der Mathematik'' ("History of Mathematics") (Göttingen 1796-1800, 4 volumes). ''Geschichte der Mathematik'' is considered an astute work, but lacks a comprehensive overview of all subsections of mathematics.

He also translated many volumes of the Proceedings of Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences into German, including all volumes of the Proceedings (''Handlingar'') between 1749 and 1781 and some volumes of New Proceedings (''Nya handlingar'') from 1784 to 1792.

He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in April 1789.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27kastner%27%29| title= Library and Archive Catalogue| publisher= Royal Society| accessdate= 7 November 2010}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3234">'''António Aniceto Monteiro''' (1907–1980)&lt;ref name="pion"/&gt; was a mathematician born in [[Portuguese Angola]] who later emigrated to Brazil in 1945 and finally to Argentina in 1950.&lt;ref name="cong"&gt;http://www.matematica.uns.edu.ar/IXCongresoMonteiro/AntonioM.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Monteiro is best known for establishing a school of [[algebraic logic]] at [[Universidad Nacional del Sur]], [[Bahía Blanca]], Argentina. His efforts to promote [[theoretical computer science]] research in Argentina were less successful.&lt;ref name="pion"&gt;http://publicaciones.dc.uba.ar/Publications/2012/CR12a/MonteiroPionero.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

After his undergraduate studies at the [[University of Lisbon]] (completed in 1930), Monteiro obtained a PhD at [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in 1936 under the advisement of [[Maurice Fréchet]] with a thesis in [[topology]].&lt;ref name="cong"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Katz2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Victor J.

In 1945 Monteiro moved to Brazil. There are two versions of why Monteiro left Portugal. The first version is that Monteiro and other Portuguese mathematicians like [[Ruy Luís Gomes]] fell foul of [[António de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar]]'s regime for their political beliefs; some, like Gomes, were imprisoned; others, like Monteiro, were simply denied employment and practically forced to emigrate.&lt;ref name="Katz2000"/&gt; The second version, supported by Monteiro's written documents, is that he was tired of the problems created by his fellow scholars that were blocking his attempts to modernize Mathematics in Portuguese universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Buescu |first=Jorge |date=2012 |title=Matemática em Portugal, Uma Questão de Educação |page=18 |url= |language= Portuguese|location=Portugal |publisher=Relógio D'Água |isbn=9789898424532}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22536">[[File:Arc length.gif|right|frame|When rectified, the curve gives a straight line segment with the same length as the curve's arc length.]]
[[File:Logarithmic spiral arc length.gif|thumb|right|Example: arc length ''s'' of a [[logarithmic spiral]] as a function of its parameter ''θ''.]]

Determining the '''length of an irregular arc segment''' is also called rectification of a [[curve]].  Historically, many methods were used for specific curves.  The advent of [[infinitesimal calculus]] led to a general formula that provides [[closed-form expression|closed-form solutions]] in some cases.

== General approach ==
[[File:Arclength.svg|400px|right|thumb|Approximation by multiple linear segments]]

A [[curve]] in the [[Euclidean space|plane]] can be approximated by connecting a [[wiktionary:Finite|finite]] number of [[point (geometry)|points]] on the curve using [[line segment]]s to create a [[polygonal chain|polygonal path]]. Since it is straightforward to calculate the [[length]] of each linear segment (using the [[Pythagorean theorem]] in Euclidean space, for example), the total length of the approximation can be found by [[summation|summing]] the lengths of each linear segment; {{anchor|Chordal distance}}that approximation is known as the ''(cumulative) [[chord (geometry)|chordal]] distance''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=51|last1=Ahlberg|last2=Nilson|date=1967|title=The Theory of Splines and Their Applications|publisher=Academic Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S7d1pjJHsRgC&amp;lpg=PA51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the curve is not already a polygonal path, using a progressively larger number of segments of smaller lengths will result in better approximations. The lengths of the successive approximations will not decrease and may keep increasing indefinitely, but for smooth curves they will tend to a finite limit as the lengths of the segments get [[arbitrarily large|arbitrarily small]].

For some curves there is a smallest number &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; that is an upper bound on the length of any polygonal approximation. These curves are called '''rectifiable''' and the number &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the '''arc length'''.

==Definition for a smooth curve==
{{See also|Curve#Length_of_a_curve|l1=Length of a curve}}

Let &lt;math&gt;f\colon[a,b]\to\R^n&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Continuous function|continuously]] [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] function.  The length of the curve defined by &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; can be defined as the [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]] of the sum of line segment lengths for a regular partition of &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; as the number of segments approaches infinity.  This means

:&lt;math&gt;L(f)=\lim_{N\to\infty}\sum_{i=1}^N \bigg|f(t_i)-f(t_{i-1})\bigg|&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;t_i=a+i(b-a)/N=a+i\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i=0,1,\dotsc,N.&lt;/math&gt; This definition is equivalent to the standard definition of arc length as an integral:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{N\to\infty}\sum_{i=1}^N \bigg|f(t_i)-f(t_{i-1})\bigg|=\lim_{N\to\infty}\sum_{i=1}^N \left|\frac{f(t_i)-f(t_{i-1})}{\Delta t}\right|\Delta t=\int_a^b \Big|f'(t)\Big|\ dt.&lt;/math&gt;

The last equality above is true because the definition of the derivative as a limit implies that there is a positive real function &lt;math&gt;\delta(\epsilon)&lt;/math&gt;  of positive real &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;\delta(\epsilon)&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;\left|\bigg|\frac{f(t_i)-f(t_{i-1})}{\Delta t}\bigg|-\Big|f'(t_i)\Big|\right|&lt;\epsilon.&lt;/math&gt; This means

:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{i=1}^N \left|\frac{f(t_i)-f(t_{i-1})}{\Delta t}\right|\Delta t-\sum_{i=1}^N \Big|f'(t_i)\Big|\Delta t
&lt;/math&gt;

has absolute value less than &lt;math&gt;\epsilon (b-a)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;N&gt;(b-a)/\delta(\epsilon).&lt;/math&gt;  This means that in the limit &lt;math&gt;N\rightarrow\infty,&lt;/math&gt; the left term above equals the right term, which is just the [[Riemann integral]] of &lt;math&gt;|f'(t)|&lt;/math&gt; on  &lt;math&gt;[a,b].&lt;/math&gt;  This definition of arc length shows that the length of a curve &lt;math&gt;f:[a,b]\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; continuously differentiable on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; is always finite.  In other words, the curve is always rectifiable.

The definition of arc length of a smooth curve as the integral of the norm of the derivative is equivalent to the definition

:&lt;math&gt;L(f)=\sup\sum_{i=1}^N \bigg|f(t_i)-f(t_{i-1})\bigg|&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[Infimum and supremum|supremum]] is taken over all possible partitions &lt;math&gt;a=t_0&lt;t_1&lt;\dots &lt;t_{N-1}&lt;t_N=b&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;[a,b].&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Principles of Mathematical Analysis|last = Rudin|first = Walter|publisher = McGraw-Hill, Inc.|year = 1976|isbn = 0-07-054235-X|location = |pages = 137}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition is also valid if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is merely continuous, not differentiable.

A curve can be parameterized in infinitely many ways. Let &lt;math&gt;\varphi:[a,b]\to [c,d]&lt;/math&gt; be any continuously differentiable [[bijection]]. Then &lt;math&gt;g=f\circ\varphi^{-1}:[c,d]\to\R^n&lt;/math&gt; is another continuously differentiable parameterization of the curve originally defined by &lt;math&gt;f.&lt;/math&gt; The arc length of the curve is the same regardless of the parameterization used to define the curve:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
L(f) &amp;= \int_a^b \Big|f'(t)\Big|\ dt=\int_a^b \Big|g'(\varphi(t))\varphi'(t)\Big|\ dt \\
&amp;= \int_a^b \Big|g'(\varphi(t))\Big|\varphi'(t)\ dt \quad \textrm{since} \ \varphi \ \textrm{must} \ \textrm{be} \ \textrm{non-decreasing} \\
&amp;= \int_c^d \Big|g'(u)\Big|\ du \quad \textrm{using} \ \textrm{integration} \ \textrm{by} \ \textrm{substitution}\\
&amp;= L(g).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Finding arc lengths by integrating==
{{See also|Differential geometry of curves#Length and natural parametrization|l1=Differential geometry of curves}}

[[File:Quarter circle.png|thumb|400x400px|Quarter circle]]
If a [[plane curve|planar curve]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; is defined by the equation &lt;math&gt; y=f(x), &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuously differentiable, then it is simply a special case of a parametric equation where &lt;math&gt;x = t &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; y = f(t).&lt;/math&gt;  The arc length is then given by:

:&lt;math&gt;s=\int_a^b \sqrt{1+\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^2}dx.&lt;/math&gt;

Curves with [[Solution in closed form|closed-form solutions]] for arc length include the [[catenary]], [[circle]], [[cycloid]], [[logarithmic spiral]], [[parabola]], [[semicubical parabola]] and [[line (mathematics)|straight line]]. The lack of a closed form solution for the arc length of an [[Ellipse#Circumference|elliptic]] arc led to the development of the [[elliptic integral]]s.

===Numerical integration===
In most cases, including even simple curves, there are no closed-form solutions for arc length and [[numerical integration]] is necessary.  Numerical integration of the arc length integral is usually very efficient.  For example, consider the problem of finding the length of a quarter of the unit circle by numerically integrating the arc length integral.  The upper half of the unit circle can be parameterized as &lt;math&gt;y=\sqrt{1-x^2}.&lt;/math&gt;  The interval &lt;math&gt;x\in [-\sqrt{2}/2, \sqrt{2}/2] &lt;/math&gt; corresponds to a quarter of the circle.  Since &lt;math&gt;dy/dx=-x/\sqrt{1-x^2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1+(dy/dx)^2 = 1/(1-x^2),&lt;/math&gt; the length of a quarter of the unit circle is

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\sqrt{2}/2}^{\sqrt{2}/2}\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} dx.&lt;/math&gt;

The 15-point [[Gauss–Kronrod quadrature formula|Gauss-Kronrod]] rule estimate for this integral of {{val|1.570796326808177}} differs from the true length of &lt;math&gt;\pi/2&lt;/math&gt; by {{val|1.3e-11}} and the 16-point [[Gaussian quadrature]] rule estimate of {{val|1.570796326794727}} differs from the true length by only {{val|1.7e-13}}.  This means it is possible to evaluate this integral to almost [[Machine epsilon|machine precision]] with only 16 integrand evaluations.

=== Curve on a surface ===
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}(u,v)&lt;/math&gt; be a surface mapping and let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}(t) = (u(t), v(t))&lt;/math&gt; be a curve on this surface.  The integrand of the arc length integral is &lt;math&gt;|(\mathbf{x}\circ\mathbf{C})'(t)|.&lt;/math&gt;  Evaluating the derivative requires the [[chain rule]] for vector fields:

: &lt;math&gt;D(\mathbf{x} \circ \mathbf{C}) = (\mathbf{x}_u \ \mathbf{x}_v)\binom{u'}{v'} = \mathbf{x}_u u' + \mathbf{x}_v v'.&lt;/math&gt;

The squared norm of this vector is &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{x}_u u' + \mathbf{x}_v v') \cdot (\mathbf{x}_u u' + \mathbf{x}_v v') = g_{11}(u')^2 + 2g_{12}u'v' + g_{22}(v')^2 &lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;g_{ij} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[first fundamental form]] coefficient), so the integrand of the arc length integral can be written as &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{g_{ab} (u^a)' (u^b)'} &lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;u^1 = u &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u^2 = v &lt;/math&gt;).

=== Other coordinate systems ===
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}(t) = (r(t), \theta(t))&lt;/math&gt; be a curve expressed in polar coordinates.  The mapping that transforms from polar coordinates to rectangular coordinates is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}(r,\theta) = (r\cos\theta, r\sin\theta ).&lt;/math&gt;

The integrand of the arc length integral is  &lt;math&gt;|(\mathbf{x}\circ\mathbf{C})'(t)|.&lt;/math&gt;  The chain rule for vector fields shows that &lt;math&gt;D(\mathbf{x}\circ \mathbf{C}) = \mathbf{x}_r r' + \mathbf{x}_{\theta} \theta'.&lt;/math&gt;  So the squared integrand of the arc length integral is

:&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{x_r}\cdot\mathbf{x}_r)(r')^2 + 2(\mathbf{x}_r\cdot\mathbf{x}_{\theta})r'\theta' + (\mathbf{x}_{\theta}\cdot\mathbf{x}_{\theta})(\theta')^2 = (r')^2 + r^2(\theta')^2.&lt;/math&gt;

So for a curve expressed in polar coordinates, the arc length is

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \sqrt{\left(\frac{dr}{dt}\right)^2 + r^2\left(\frac{d\theta}{dt}\right)^2 }dt = \int_{\theta(t_1)}^{\theta(t_2)} \sqrt{\left(\frac{dr}{d\theta}\right)^2 + r^2}d\theta.&lt;/math&gt;

Now let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}(t) = (r(t), \theta(t), \phi(t))&lt;/math&gt; be a curve expressed in spherical coordinates where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the polar angle measured from the positive &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-axis and &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the azimuthal angle.  The mapping that transforms from spherical coordinates to rectangular coordinates is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}(r,\theta,\phi) = (r\sin\theta\cos\phi, r\sin\theta\sin\phi, r\cos\theta).&lt;/math&gt;

Using the chain rule again shows that &lt;math&gt;D(\mathbf{x}\circ\mathbf{C}) = \mathbf{x}_r r' + \mathbf{x}_{\theta}\theta' + \mathbf{x}_{\phi}\phi'.&lt;/math&gt;  All dot products &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_i \cdot \mathbf{x}_j&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; differ are zero, so the squared norm of this vector is

:&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{x}_r\cdot \mathbf{x}_r )(r'^2) + (\mathbf{x}_{\theta} \cdot \mathbf{x}_{\theta})(\theta')^2 + (\mathbf{x}_{\phi}\cdot \mathbf{x}_{\phi})(\phi')^2 = (r')^2 + r^2(\theta')^2 + r^2 \sin^2\theta (\phi')^2.&lt;/math&gt;

So for a curve expressed in spherical coordinates, the arc length is

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \sqrt{\left(\frac{dr}{dt}\right)^2 + r^2\left(\frac{d\theta}{dt}\right)^2 + r^2\sin^2\theta \left(\frac{d\phi}{dt}\right)^2}dt. &lt;/math&gt;

A very similar calculation shows that the arc length of a curve expressed in cylindrical coordinates is

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \sqrt{\left(\frac{dr}{dt}\right)^2 + r^2\left(\frac{d\theta}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dz}{dt}\right)^2}dt. &lt;/math&gt;

== Simple cases ==

=== Arcs of circles ===
&lt;!--
Arc length is not the same as [[arc measure]]. [What is that?] --&gt;

Arc lengths are denoted by ''s'', since the Latin word for length (or size) is ''spatium''.

In the following lines, &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; represents the [[radius]] of a [[circle]], &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is its [[diameter]], &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is its [[circumference]], &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is the length of an arc of the circle, and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angle which the arc subtends at the [[Centre (geometry)|centre]] of the circle. The distances &lt;math&gt;r, d, C,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; are expressed in the same units.

* &lt;math&gt;C=2\pi r,&lt;/math&gt; which is the same as &lt;math&gt;C=\pi d.&lt;/math&gt;  This equation is a definition of [[Pi|&lt;math&gt;\pi.&lt;/math&gt;]]
* If the arc is a [[semicircle]], then &lt;math&gt;s=\pi r.&lt;/math&gt;
* {{anchor|Circular}}For an arbitrary circular arc:
** If &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is in [[radian]]s then &lt;math&gt;s =r\theta.&lt;/math&gt; This is a definition of the radian.
** If &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is in [[Degree (angle)|degrees]], then &lt;math&gt;s=\frac{\pi r \theta}{180},&lt;/math&gt; which is the same as &lt;math&gt;s=\frac{C \theta}{360}.&lt;/math&gt;
** If &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is in [[Grad (angle)|grads]] (100 grads, or grades, or gradians are one [[right-angle]]), then &lt;math&gt;s=\frac{\pi r \theta}{200},&lt;/math&gt; which is the same as &lt;math&gt;s=\frac{C \theta}{400}.&lt;/math&gt;
** If &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is in [[Turn (geometry)|turns]] (one turn is a complete rotation, or 360°, or 400 grads, or &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt; radians), then &lt;math&gt;s=C \theta.&lt;/math&gt;

====Arcs of great circles on the Earth====
{{main|Great-circle distance}}
{{further|Geodesics on an ellipsoid}}

Two units of length, the [[nautical mile]] and the [[metre]] (or kilometre), were originally defined so the lengths of arcs of [[great circle]]s on the Earth's surface would be simply numerically related to the angles they subtend at its centre. The simple equation &lt;math&gt;s=\theta&lt;/math&gt; applies in the following circumstances:

:* if &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is in nautical miles, and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is in [[arcminute]]s ({{frac|60}} degree), or
:* if &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is in kilometres, and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is in centigrades ({{frac|100}} grad).

The lengths of the distance units were chosen to make the circumference of the Earth equal {{val|40000}} kilometres, or {{val|21600}} nautical miles. Those are the numbers of the corresponding angle units in one complete turn.

Those definitions of the metre and the nautical mile have been superseded by more precise ones, but the original definitions are still accurate enough for conceptual purposes and some calculations. For example, they imply that one kilometre is exactly 0.54 nautical miles. Using official modern definitions, one nautical mile is exactly 1.852 kilometres,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/appenB8.html|title=Special Publication 811|first=Curt|last=Suplee|date=2 July 2009|website=nist.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; which implies that 1 kilometre is about {{val|0.53995680}} nautical miles.&lt;ref&gt;[[CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics]], p. F-254&lt;/ref&gt; This modern ratio differs from the one calculated from the original definitions by less than one part in 10,000.

=== Length of an arc of a parabola ===

==Historical methods==

===Antiquity===
For much of the [[history of mathematics]], even the greatest thinkers considered it impossible to compute the length of an irregular arc. Although [[Archimedes]] had pioneered a way of finding the area beneath a curve with his "[[method of exhaustion]]", few believed it was even possible for curves to have definite lengths, as do straight lines. The first ground was broken in this field, as it often has been in [[calculus]], by [[approximation]]. People began to inscribe [[polygon]]s within the curves and compute the length of the sides for a somewhat accurate measurement of the length. By using more segments, and by decreasing the length of each segment, they were able to obtain a more and more accurate approximation. In particular, by inscribing a polygon of many sides in a circle, they were able to find approximate values of [[pi (mathematical constant)|π]].

===17th century===
In the 17th century, the method of exhaustion led to the rectification by geometrical methods of several [[transcendental curve]]s: the [[logarithmic spiral]] by [[Evangelista Torricelli]] in 1645 (some sources say [[John Wallis]] in the 1650s), the [[cycloid]] by [[Christopher Wren]] in 1658, and the [[catenary]] by [[Gottfried Leibniz]] in 1691.

In 1659, Wallis credited [[William Neile]]'s discovery of the first rectification of a nontrivial [[algebraic curve]], the [[semicubical parabola]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=Wallis|title=Tractatus Duo. Prior, De Cycloide et de Corporibus inde Genitis…|location=Oxford|publisher=University Press|date=1659|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5759200j/f110.image|pages=91–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accompanying figures appear on page 145. On page 91, William Neile is mentioned as ''Gulielmus Nelius''.

===Integral form===
Before the full formal development of calculus, the basis for the modern integral form for arc length was independently discovered by [[Hendrik van Heuraet]] and [[Pierre de Fermat]].

In 1659 van Heuraet published a construction showing that the problem of determining arc length could be transformed into the problem of determining the area under a curve (i.e., an integral).  As an example of his method, he determined the arc length of a semicubical parabola, which required finding the area under a [[parabola]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Hendrik|last=van Heuraet|url=https://books.google.com/books/ucm?id=lGFxGEEK52oC&amp;pg=PA517#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|contribution=Epistola de transmutatione curvarum linearum in rectas [Letter on the transformation of curved lines into right ones]|title=Renati Des-Cartes Geometria|edition=2nd|location=Amsterdam|publisher=Louis &amp; Daniel Elzevir|date=1659|pages=517–520}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1660, Fermat published a more general theory containing the same result in his ''De linearum curvarum cum lineis rectis comparatione dissertatio geometrica'' (Geometric dissertation on curved lines in comparison with straight lines).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=M.P.E.A.S. (pseudonym of Fermat)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BBqoHZej2ZsC&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=De Linearum Curvarum cum Lineis Rectis Comparatione Dissertatio Geometrica|location=Toulouse|publisher=Arnaud Colomer|date=1660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arc length, Fermat.svg|thumb|300px|Fermat's method of determining arc length]]

Building on his previous work with tangents, Fermat used the curve

:&lt;math&gt; y = x^{3/2} \,&lt;/math&gt;

whose [[tangent]] at ''x'' = ''a'' had a [[slope]] of

:&lt;math&gt; \textstyle {3 \over 2} a^{1/2} &lt;/math&gt;

so the tangent line would have the equation

:&lt;math&gt; y = \textstyle {3 \over 2} {a^{1/2}}(x - a) + f(a). &lt;/math&gt;

Next, he increased ''a'' by a small amount to ''a'' + ''ε'', making segment ''AC'' a relatively good approximation for the length of the curve from ''A'' to ''D''. To find the length of the segment ''AC'', he used the [[Pythagorean theorem]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
AC^2 &amp;{}= AB^2 + BC^2 \\
&amp;{} = \textstyle \varepsilon^2 + {9 \over 4} a \varepsilon^2 \\
&amp;{}= \textstyle \varepsilon^2 \left (1 + {9 \over 4} a \right )
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

which, when solved, yields

:&lt;math&gt;AC = \textstyle \varepsilon \sqrt { 1 + {9 \over 4} a\ }.&lt;/math&gt;

In order to approximate the length, Fermat would sum up a sequence of short segments.

==Curves with infinite length{{anchor|Infinite}}==
{{see also|Coastline paradox}}
[[File:Koch curve.svg|thumb|The Koch curve.]] [[File:xsinoneoverx.svg|thumb|The graph of ''x''sin(1/''x'').]]
As mentioned above, some curves are non-rectifiable. That is, there is no upper bound on the lengths of polygonal approximations; the length can be made [[Mathematical jargon#arbitrarily large|arbitrarily large]]. Informally, such curves are said to have infinite length. There are continuous curves on which every arc (other than a single-point arc) has infinite length. An example of such a curve is the [[Koch snowflake|Koch curve]]. Another example of a curve with infinite length is the graph of the function defined by ''f''(''x'') =&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;sin(1/''x'') for any open set with 0 as one of its delimiters and ''f''(0) = 0. Sometimes the [[Hausdorff dimension]] and [[Hausdorff measure]] are used to quantify the size of such curves.

==Generalization to (pseudo-)Riemannian manifolds==
Let &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; be a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|(pseudo-)Riemannian manifold]], &lt;math&gt;\gamma:[0,1]\rightarrow M&lt;/math&gt; a curve in &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; the (pseudo-) [[metric tensor]].

The length of &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be

:&lt;math&gt;\ell(\gamma)=\int_{0}^{1} \sqrt{ \pm g(\gamma'(t),\gamma '(t)) } \, dt, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\gamma'(t)\in T_{\gamma(t)}M&lt;/math&gt; is the tangent vector of &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;t.&lt;/math&gt;  The sign in the square root is chosen once for a given curve, to ensure that the square root is a real number. The positive sign is chosen for spacelike curves; in a pseudo-Riemannian manifold, the negative sign may be chosen for timelike curves . Thus the length of a curve in a non-negative real number. Usually no curves are considered which are partly spacelike and partly timelike.

In [[theory of relativity]], arc length of timelike curves ([[world line]]s) is the [[proper time]] elapsed along the world line, and arc length of a spacelike curve the [[proper distance]] along the curve.

The '''BEAR''' and '''LION''' [[block cipher]]s were invented by [[Ross J. Anderson|Ross Anderson]] and [[Eli Biham]] by combining a [[stream cipher]] and a [[cryptographic hash function]]. The algorithms use a very large variable [[block size (cryptography)|block size]], on the order of 2&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; to 2&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; bits {{clarify span|or more|date=October 2017}}. Both are 3-round generalized (alternating) [[Feistel cipher]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-14623-7_33 |title=On Generalized Feistel Networks |last1=Hoang |first1=Viet Tung |last2=Rogaway |first2=Phillip |date=2010 |publisher=Springer |book-title=LNCS 6223 |pages=613–630 |location=USA |conference=CRYPTO 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; using the hash function and the stream cipher as round functions. BEAR uses the hash function twice with independent [[key (cryptography)|keys]], and the stream cipher once. LION uses the stream cipher twice and the hash function once. The inventors proved that an attack on either BEAR or LION that recovers the key would break both the stream cipher and the hash.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4799">In [[cryptography]], '''blinding''' is a technique by which an agent can provide a service to (i.e., compute a [[function (mathematics)|function]] for) a client in an encoded form without knowing either the real input or the real output.  Blinding techniques also have applications to preventing [[side-channel attack]]s on encryption devices.

More precisely, [[Alice and Bob|Alice]] has an input ''x'' and Oscar has a function ''f''. Alice would like Oscar to compute {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''f''(''x'')}} for her without revealing either ''x'' or ''y'' to him. The reason for her wanting this might be that she doesn't know the function ''f'' or that she does not have the resources to compute it.
Alice "blinds" the message by encoding it into some other input ''E''(''x'');  the encoding ''E'' must be a [[bijection]] on the input space of ''f'', ideally a random permutation. Oscar gives her ''f''(''E''(''x'')), to which she applies a decoding ''D'' to obtain {{nowrap|1=''D''(''f''(''E''(''x''))) = ''y''}}.

Not all functions allow for blind computation. At other times, blinding must be applied with care. An example of the latter is [[Rabin cryptosystem|Rabin–Williams]] signatures. If blinding is applied to the formatted message but the random value does not honor Jacobi requirements on ''p'' and ''q'', then it could lead to private key recovery. A demonstration of the recovery can be seen in [[Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures|CVE]] 2015-2141&lt;ref&gt;[https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2015-2141 CVE-2015-214]&lt;/ref&gt; discovered by Evgeny Sidorov.

The most common application of blinding is the [[blind signature]]. In a blind signature protocol, the signer digitally signs a message without being able to learn its content.

The [[one-time pad]] (OTP) is an application of blinding to the secure communication problem, by its very nature. Alice would like to send a message to Bob secretly, however all of their communication can be read by Oscar. Therefore, Alice sends the message after blinding it with a secret key or OTP that she shares with Bob. Bob reverses the blinding after receiving the message. In this example, the function 
''f'' is the [[identity function|identity]] and ''E'' and ''D'' are both typically the [[exclusive disjunction|XOR]] operation.

Blinding can also be used to prevent certain [[side-channel attack]]s on [[asymmetric key encryption algorithm|asymmetric encryption schemes]].  Side-channel attacks allow an adversary to recover information about the input to a cryptographic operation, by measuring something other than the algorithm's result, e.g., power consumption, computation time, or radio-frequency emanations by a device.  Typically these attacks depend on the attacker knowing the characteristics of the algorithm, as well as (some) inputs.  In this setting, blinding serves to alter the algorithm's input into some unpredictable state.  Depending on the characteristics of the blinding function, this can prevent some or all leakage of useful information.  Note that security depends also on the resistance of the blinding functions themselves to side-channel attacks.

For example, in [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] blinding involves computing the blinding operation {{nowrap|1=''E''(''x'') = ''(xr)&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;'' mod ''N''}}, where ''r'' is a random integer between 1 and ''N'' and [[relatively prime]] to ''N'' (i.e. {{nowrap|1=gcd(''r'', ''N'') = 1)}}, ''x'' is the plaintext, ''e'' is the public RSA exponent and ''N'' is the RSA modulus.  As usual, the decryption function {{nowrap|1=''f''(''z'') = ''z&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;'' mod ''N''}} is applied thus giving {{nowrap|1=''f''(''E''(''x'')) = ''(xr)&lt;sup&gt;ed&lt;/sup&gt;'' mod ''N'' =  ''xr'' mod ''N''}}. Finally it is unblinded using the function {{nowrap|1=''D''(''z'') = ''zr''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; mod ''N''}}. Multiplying {{nowrap|''xr'' mod ''N''}} by {{nowrap|''r&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;'' mod ''N''}} yields {{nowrap|''x''}}, as desired. When decrypting in this manner, an adversary who is able to measure time taken by this operation would not be able to make use of this information (by applying timing attacks RSA is known to be vulnerable to) as she does not know the constant ''r'' and hence has no knowledge of the real input fed to the RSA primitives.

In [[geometry]], the '''{{visible anchor|Braikenridge–Maclaurin theorem}}''', named for 18th century British mathematicians [[William Braikenridge]] and [[Colin Maclaurin]] {{Harv|Mills|1984}}, is the converse to [[Pascal's theorem]].  It states that if the three intersection points of the three pairs of lines through opposite sides of a hexagon lie on a line ''L'', then the six vertices of the hexagon lie on a conic ''C''; the conic may be degenerate, as in Pappus's theorem. {{Harv|Coxeter|Greitzer|1967|loc=p. 76}}.  The Braikenridge–Maclaurin theorem may be applied in the [[Braikenridge–Maclaurin construction]], which is a [[synthetic geometry|synthetic]] construction of the conic defined by five points, by varying the sixth point.  Namely, Pascal's theorem states that given six points on a conic (the vertices of a hexagon), the lines defined by opposite sides intersect in three collinear points. This can be reversed to construct the possible locations for a sixth point, given five existing ones.

The algorithm is based on the negated [[Heegner number]] &lt;math&gt; d = -163 &lt;/math&gt;, the [[j-invariant|''j''-function]] &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle j \left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{-163}}{2}\right) = -640320^3&lt;/math&gt;, and on the following rapidly convergent [[generalized hypergeometric series]]:&lt;ref name="baruah"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{\pi} = 12 \sum^\infty_{k=0} \frac{(-1)^k (6k)! (545140134k + 13591409)}{(3k)!(k!)^3 \left(640320\right)^{3k + 3/2}}&lt;/math&gt;

For a high performance iterative implementation, this can be simplified to

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{(640320)^{3/2}}{12\pi}=\frac{426880\sqrt{10005}}{\pi} = \sum^\infty_{k=0} \frac{(6k)! (545140134k + 13591409)}{(3k)!(k!)^3 \left(-262537412640768000\right)^{k}}&lt;/math&gt;

There are 3 big integer terms (the multinomial term ''M&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'', the linear term ''L&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'', and the exponential term ''X&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'') that make up the series and [[pi|{{pi}}]] equals the constant ''C'' divided by the sum of the series, as below:

:&lt;math&gt;\pi = C \left(\sum^\infty_{k=0} \frac{M_k \cdot L_k}{X_k}\right)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, where:

:&lt;math&gt; C = 426880 \sqrt{10005}, \quad \quad M_k = \frac{(6k)!}{(3k)! (k!)^3}, \quad \quad L_k = 545140134k + 13591409, \quad \quad X_k = (-262537412640768000)^k &lt;/math&gt;

The terms ''M&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''L&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''X&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' satisfy the following recurrences and can be computed as such:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{alignat}{4}
    L_{k+1} &amp;=  L_k + 545140134 \,\, &amp;&amp; \textrm{where} \,\, L_0 &amp;&amp;= 13591409 \\[4pt]
    X_{k+1} &amp;= X_k \cdot (-262537412640768000) &amp;&amp; \textrm{where} \,\, X_0 &amp;&amp;= 1 \\[4pt]
    M_{k+1} &amp;=  M_k \cdot \left( \frac{(12k+2)(12k+6)(12k+10)}{(k+1)^3} \right) \,\, &amp;&amp; \textrm{where} \,\, M_0 &amp;&amp;= 1 \\[4pt]
\end{alignat}
&lt;/math&gt;

The computation of ''M&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' can be further optimized by introducing an additional term ''K&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{alignat}{4}
    K_{k+1} &amp;=  K_k + 12 \,\, &amp;&amp; \textrm{where} \,\, K_0 &amp;&amp;= 6 \\[4pt]
    M_{k+1} &amp;=  M_k \cdot \left( \frac{K_k^3 - 16K_k}{(k+1)^3} \right) \,\, &amp;&amp; \textrm{where} \,\, M_0 &amp;&amp;= 1 \\[12pt]
\end{alignat}
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that 

:&lt;math&gt;e^{\pi \sqrt{163}} \approx 640320^3+743.99999999999925\dots&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;640320^3 = 262537412640768000&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;545140134 = 163 \cdot 127 \cdot 19 \cdot 11 \cdot 7 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;13591409 = 13 \cdot 1045493&lt;/math&gt;

This identity is similar to some of [[Ramanujan]]'s formulas involving {{pi}},&lt;ref name="baruah"/&gt; and is an example of a [[Ramanujan–Sato series]].

The [[time complexity]] of the algorithm is &lt;math&gt;O(n \log(n)^3)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2018-02-25|title=y-cruncher - Formulas|url=http://www.numberworld.org/y-cruncher/internals/formulas.html|website=www.numberworld.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example: Python Implementation==
{{pi}} can be computed to any precision using the above algorithm in any environment which supports arbitrary-precision arithmetic.  As an example, here is a Python implementation:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="python3"&gt;
from decimal import Decimal as Dec, getcontext as gc

def PI(maxK=70, prec=1008, disp=1007): # parameter defaults chosen to gain 1000+ digits within a few seconds
    gc().prec = prec
    K, M, L, X, S = 6, 1, 13591409, 1, 13591409
    for k in range(1, maxK+1):
        M = (K**3 - 16*K) * M // k**3 
        L += 545140134
        X *= -262537412640768000
        S += Dec(M * L) / X
        K += 12
    pi = 426880 * Dec(10005).sqrt() / S
    pi = Dec(str(pi)[:disp]) # drop few digits of precision for accuracy
    print("PI(maxK=%d iterations, gc().prec=%d, disp=%d digits) =\n%s" % (maxK, prec, disp, pi))
    return pi

Pi = PI()
print("\nFor greater precision and more digits (takes a few extra seconds) - Try")
print("Pi = PI(317,4501,4500)") 
print("Pi = PI(353,5022,5020)")
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

In [[mathematics]], the '''conjugate transpose''' or '''Hermitian transpose''' of an ''m''-by-''n'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] '''''A''''' with [[complex number|complex]] entries is the ''n''-by-''m'' matrix '''''A'''''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; obtained from '''''A''''' by taking the [[transpose]] and then taking the [[complex conjugate]] of each entry. (The complex conjugate of ''a'' + ''bi'', where ''a'' and ''b'' are reals, is ''a'' − ''bi''.) The conjugate transpose is formally defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\boldsymbol{A}^*\right)_{ij} = \overline{\boldsymbol{A}_{ji}}&lt;/math&gt;

where the subscripts denote the (''i'', ''j'')-th entry, for {{nowrap|1 &amp;le; ''i'' &amp;le; ''n''}} and {{nowrap|1 &amp;le; ''j'' &amp;le; ''m''}}, and the overbar denotes a scalar complex conjugate.

This definition can also be written as
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}^* = \left(\overline{\boldsymbol{A}}\right)^\mathsf{T} = \overline{\boldsymbol{A}^\mathsf{T}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}^\mathsf{T}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the transpose and &lt;math&gt;\overline{\boldsymbol{A}}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the matrix with complex conjugated entries.

Other names for the conjugate transpose of a matrix are '''Hermitian conjugate''', '''bedaggered matrix''', '''adjoint matrix''' or '''transjugate'''. The conjugate transpose of a matrix ''A'' can be denoted by any of these symbols:
* &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}^*&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}^\mathrm{H}&lt;/math&gt;, commonly used in [[linear algebra]]
* &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}^\dagger&lt;/math&gt; (sometimes pronounced as ''A [[dagger (typography)|dagger]]''), universally used in [[quantum mechanics]]
* &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}^+&lt;/math&gt;, although this symbol is more commonly used for the [[Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse]]

In some contexts, &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}^*&lt;/math&gt; denotes the matrix with complex conjugated entries, and the conjugate transpose is then denoted by &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}^{{*}\mathsf{T}}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}^{\mathsf{T}{*}}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Example==
If
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; -2 - i &amp; 5 \\ 1 + i &amp; i &amp; 4-2i \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
then
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}^\mathrm{H} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 - i \\ -2 + i &amp; -i \\ 5 &amp; 4+2i\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

==Basic remarks==

A square matrix ''A'' with entries &lt;math&gt;a_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is called
* [[hermitian matrix|Hermitian]] or [[self-adjoint_operator|self-adjoint]] if ''A'' = ''A''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;; i.e., &lt;math&gt;a_{ij} = \overline{a_{ji}}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;.
* [[skew-Hermitian matrix|skew Hermitian]] or antihermitian if ''A'' = −''A''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;; i.e., &lt;math&gt;a_{ij} = -\overline{a_{ji}}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;.
* [[normal matrix|normal]] if ''A''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;''A'' = ''AA''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;.
* [[Unitary matrix|unitary]] if ''A''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; = ''A''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

Even if ''A'' is not square, the two matrices ''A''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;''A'' and ''AA''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; are both Hermitian and in fact [[positive-definite matrix|positive semi-definite matrices]].

The conjugate transpose "adjoint" matrix ''A''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; should not be confused with the [[adjugate]], adj(''A''), which is also sometimes called ''adjoint''.

The conjugate transpose of a matrix ''A'' with [[real number|real]] entries reduces to the [[transpose]] of ''A'', as the conjugate of a real number is the number itself.

== Motivation ==
The conjugate transpose can be motivated by noting that complex numbers can be usefully represented by 2×2 real matrices, obeying matrix addition and multiplication:
:&lt;math&gt;a + ib \equiv \begin{pmatrix} a &amp; -b \\ b &amp; a \end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

That is, denoting each ''complex'' number ''z'' by the ''real'' 2&amp;times;2 matrix of the linear transformation on the [[Argand diagram]] (viewed as the ''real'' vector space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;) affected by complex ''z''-multiplication on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;.

An ''m''-by-''n'' matrix of complex numbers could therefore equally well be represented by a 2''m''-by-2''n'' matrix of real numbers.  The conjugate transpose therefore arises very naturally as the result of simply transposing such a matrix, when viewed back again as ''n''-by-''m'' matrix made up of complex numbers.

==Properties of the conjugate transpose==
* (''A'' + ''B'')&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; = ''A''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; + ''B''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; for any two matrices ''A'' and ''B'' of the same dimensions.
* (''rA'')&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; = {{overline|''r''}}''A''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; for any complex number ''r'' and any ''m''-by-''n'' matrix ''A''.
* (''AB'')&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; = ''B''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;''A''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; for any ''m''-by-''n'' matrix ''A'' and any ''n''-by-''p'' matrix ''B''. Note that the order of the factors is reversed.
* (''A''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; = ''A'' for any ''m''-by-''n'' matrix ''A''.
* If ''A'' is a square matrix, then [[determinant|det]](''A''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;) = (det ''A'')&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; and [[trace (matrix)|tr]](''A''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;) = (tr ''A'')&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;.
* ''A'' is [[invertible matrix|invertible]] [[if and only if]] ''A''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; is invertible, and in that case (''A''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; = (''A''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;.
* The [[eigenvalue]]s of ''A''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; are the complex conjugates of the [[eigenvalue]]s of ''A''.
* ⟨''Ax'', ''y''⟩ = ⟨''x'', ''A''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;''y''⟩  for any ''m''-by-''n'' matrix ''A'', any vector ''x'' in &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{C}^n &lt;/math&gt; and any vector ''y'' in &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{C}^m &lt;/math&gt;. Here, &lt;math&gt;\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle&lt;/math&gt; denotes the standard complex [[inner product]] on &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{C}^m &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{C}^n &lt;/math&gt;.

==Generalizations==
The last property given above shows that if one views ''A'' as a [[linear transformation]] from Euclidean [[Hilbert space]] &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{C}^n &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{C}^m &lt;/math&gt;, then the matrix ''A''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; corresponds to the [[Hermitian adjoint|adjoint operator]] of ''A''. The concept of adjoint operators between Hilbert spaces can thus be seen as a generalization of the conjugate transpose of matrices with respect to an orthonormal basis.

Another generalization is available: suppose ''A'' is a linear map from a complex [[vector space]] ''V'' to another, ''W'', then the [[complex conjugate linear map]] as well as the [[transpose of a linear map|transposed linear map]] are defined, and we may thus take the conjugate transpose of ''A'' to be the complex conjugate of the transpose of ''A''. It maps the conjugate [[dual space|dual]] of ''W'' to the conjugate dual of ''V''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1964">In [[computational geometry]], a '''coreset''' is a small set of points that approximates the shape of a larger point set, in the sense that applying some geometric measure to the two sets (such as their [[minimum bounding box]] [[volume]]) results in approximately equal numbers. Many natural geometric optimization problems have coresets that approximate an optimal solution to within a factor of {{math|1 + ''&amp;epsilon;''}}, that can be found quickly (in [[linear time]] or near-linear time), and that have size bounded by a function of {{math|1/''&amp;epsilon;''}} independent of the input size, where {{math|''&amp;epsilon;''}} is an arbitrary positive number. When this is the case, one obtains a linear-time or near-linear time approximation scheme, based on the idea of finding a coreset and then applying an exact optimization algorithm to the coreset. Regardless of how slow the exact optimization algorithm is, for any fixed choice of {{math|''&amp;epsilon;''}}, the running time of this approximation scheme will be {{math|''O''(1)}} plus the time to find the coreset.&lt;ref name="Agarwal"&gt;{{citation

'''Credal networks''' are probabilistic [[graphical model]]s based on [[imprecise probability]]. Credal networks can be regarded as an extension of [[Bayesian network]]s, where [[credal set]]s replace probability mass functions in the specification of the local models for the network variables given their parents. As a Bayesian network defines a joint probability mass function over its variables, a credal network defines a joint credal set. The way this credal set is defined depends on the particular notion of independence for imprecise probability adopted. Most of the research on credal networks focused on the case of strong independence. Given strong independence the joint credal set associated to a credal network is called its strong extension. Let &lt;math&gt;(X_1,\ldots,X_n)&lt;/math&gt; denote a collection of categorical variables and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;K(X_i\mid\pi_i)&lt;/math&gt; is, for each &lt;math&gt;i=1,\ldots,n&lt;/math&gt;, a conditional credal set over &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt;, then the strong extension of a credal network is defined as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;K(X_1,\ldots,X_n)=\mathrm{CH}\{ P(X_1,\ldots,X_n): P(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=\prod_{i=1}^n P(x_i\mid\pi_i) , P(X_i\mid\pi_i) \in K(X_i\mid\pi_i) \}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{CH}&lt;/math&gt; denote the [[convex hull]].

==Inference==
Inference on a credal network is intended as the computation of the bounds of an expectation with respect to its strong extensions. When computing the bounds of a conditional event, inference is called updating. Say that the queried variable &lt;math&gt;X_q&lt;/math&gt; and the observed variables are &lt;math&gt;X_E&lt;/math&gt;, the lower bound to be evaluated is:

: &lt;math&gt;\underline{P}(x_q\mid x_E)=\min_{P(X_1,\ldots,X_n)\in K(X_1,\ldots,X_n)} \frac{\sum_{X_q,X_E}P(X_1,\ldots,X_n)}{\sum_{X_q}P(X_1,\ldots,X_n)}. &lt;/math&gt;

Being a generalization of the same problem for Bayesian networks, updating with credal networks is a NP-hard task. Yet a number of algorithm have been specified.{{vague|date=December 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14584">A '''definite clause grammar''' ('''DCG''') is a way of expressing grammar, either for [[Natural language|natural]] or [[Formal language|formal]] languages, in a logic programming language such as [[Prolog]]. It is closely related to the concept of [[attribute grammar]]s / [[affix grammar]]s from which Prolog was originally developed.
DCGs are usually associated with Prolog, but similar languages such as [[Mercury (programming language)|Mercury]] also include DCGs. They are called definite clause grammars because they represent a grammar as a set of [[definite clause]]s in [[first-order logic]].

The term DCG refers to the specific type of expression in Prolog and other similar languages; not all ways of expressing grammars using definite clauses are considered DCGs. However, all of the capabilities or properties of DCGs will be the same for any grammar that is represented with definite clauses in essentially the same way as in Prolog.

The definite clauses of a DCG can be considered a set of axioms where the validity of a sentence, and the fact that it has a certain parse tree can be considered theorems that follow from these axioms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has the advantage of making it so that recognition and parsing of expressions in a language becomes a general matter of proving statements, such as statements in a logic programming language.

== History ==

The history of DCGs is closely tied to the history of Prolog, and the history of Prolog revolves around several researchers in both Marseilles, France, and Edinburgh, Scotland. According to [[Robert Kowalski]], an early developer of Prolog, the first Prolog system was developed in 1972 by [[Alain Colmerauer]] and Phillipe Roussel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal
| last = Kowalski
| first = R. A.
| title = The early years of logic programming
| url = http://www-public.tem-tsp.eu/~gibson/Teaching/Teaching-ReadingMaterial/Kowalski88.pdf
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first program written in the language was a large natural-language processing system. Fernando Pereira and [[David H. D. Warren|David Warren]] at the University of Edinburgh were also involved in the early development of Prolog.

Colmerauer had previously worked on a language processing system called Q-systems that was used to translate between English and French.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal
| pages = 133–189
| last = Colmerauer
| first = A.
| title = Metamorphosis grammars
| journal = Natural Language Communication with Computers
| year = 1978
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, Colmerauer wrote a paper about a way of representing grammars called metamorphosis grammars which were part of the early version of Prolog called Marseille Prolog. In this paper, he gave a formal description of metamorphosis grammars and some examples of programs that use them.

Fernando Pereira and David Warren, two other early architects of Prolog, coined the term "definite clause grammar" and created the notation for DCGs that is used in Prolog today. They gave credit for the idea to Colmerauer and Kowalski, and they note that DCGs are a special case of Colmerauer's metamorphosis grammars. They introduced the idea in an article called "Definite Clause Grammars for Language Analysis", where they describe DCGs as a "formalism ... in which grammars are expressed clauses of first-order predicate logic" that "constitute effective programs of the programming language Prolog".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

| title = Definite clause grammars for language analysis
| year = 1980
| url = http://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~takis/pereira-warren.pdf
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pereira, Warren, and other pioneers of Prolog later wrote about several other aspects of DCGs. Pereira and Warren wrote an article called "Parsing as Deduction", describing things such as how the Earley Deduction proof procedure is used for parsing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pereira also collaborated with [[Stuart M. Shieber]] on a book called "Prolog and Natural Language Analysis", that was intended as a general introduction to [[computational linguistics]] using logic programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==

A basic example of DCGs helps to illustrate what they are and what they look like.
&lt;source lang="prolog"&gt;
 sentence --&gt; noun_phrase, verb_phrase.
 noun_phrase --&gt; det, noun.
 verb_phrase --&gt; verb, noun_phrase.
 det --&gt; [the].
 det --&gt; [a].
 noun --&gt; [cat].
 noun --&gt; [bat].
 verb --&gt; [eats].
&lt;/source&gt;
This generates sentences such as "the cat eats the bat", "a bat eats the cat". One can generate all of the valid expressions in the language generated by this grammar at a Prolog interpreter by typing &lt;code&gt;sentence(X,[])&lt;/code&gt;. Similarly, one can test whether a sentence is valid in the language by typing something like &lt;code&gt;sentence([the,bat,eats,the,bat],[])&lt;/code&gt;.

== Translation into definite clauses ==

DCG notation is just [[syntactic sugar]] for normal definite clauses in Prolog. For example, the previous example could be translated into the following:
&lt;source lang="prolog"&gt;
 sentence(A,Z) :- noun_phrase(A,B), verb_phrase(B,Z).
 noun_phrase(A,Z) :- det(A,B), noun(B,Z).
 verb_phrase(A,Z) :- verb(A,B), noun_phrase(B,Z).
 det([the|X], X).
 det([a|X], X).
 noun([cat|X], X).
 noun([bat|X], X).
 verb([eats|X], X).
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Difference lists ===

The arguments to each functor, such as &lt;code&gt;(A,B)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(B,Z)&lt;/code&gt; are [[difference list]]s; difference lists are a way of representing a prefix of a list as the difference between its two suffixes (the bigger including the smaller one). Using Prolog's notation for lists, a singleton list prefix &lt;code&gt;P = [H]&lt;/code&gt; can be seen as the difference between &lt;code&gt;[H|X]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt;, and thus represented with the pair &lt;code&gt;([H|X],X)&lt;/code&gt;, for instance.

Saying that &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt; is the difference between &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; is the same as saying that &lt;code&gt;append(P,B,A)&lt;/code&gt; holds. Or in the case of the previous example, &lt;code&gt;append([H],X,[H|X])&lt;/code&gt;.

Difference lists are used to represent lists with DCGs for reasons of efficiency. It is much more efficient to concatenate list differences (prefixes), in the circumstances that they can be used, because the concatenation of &lt;code&gt;(A,B)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(B,Z)&lt;/code&gt; is just &lt;code&gt;(A,Z)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| last = Fleck
| first = Arthur
| title = Definite Clause Grammar Translation
| accessdate = 2009-04-16
| url = http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/~fleck/dcgTrans.htm
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, &lt;code&gt;append(P,B,A), append(Q,Z,B)&lt;/code&gt; entails &lt;code&gt;append(P,Q,S), append(S,Z,A)&lt;/code&gt;. This is the same as saying that list concatenation is ''associative'':
 A = P + B = P + (Q + Z) = (P + Q) + Z = S + Z = A

== Non-context-free grammars ==

In [[Prolog#Rules and facts|pure Prolog]], normal DCG rules with no extra arguments on the functors, such as the previous example, can only express [[context-free grammar]]s; there is only one argument on the left side of the [[Production (computer science)|production]]. However, [[context-sensitive grammar]]s can also be expressed with DCGs, by providing extra arguments, such as in the following example:
&lt;source lang="prolog"&gt;
 s --&gt; a(N), b(N), c(N).
 a(0) --&gt; [].
 a(M) --&gt; [a], a(N), {M is N + 1}.
 b(0) --&gt; [].
 b(M) --&gt; [b], b(N), {M is N + 1}.
 c(0) --&gt; [].
 c(M) --&gt; [c], c(N), {M is N + 1}.
&lt;/source&gt;
This set of DCG rules describes the grammar which generates the language that consists of strings of the form &lt;math&gt;a^{n}b^{n}c^{n}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;source lang="prolog"&gt;
 s --&gt; symbols(Sem,a), symbols(Sem,b), symbols(Sem,c).
 symbols(end,_) --&gt; [].
 symbols(s(Sem),S) --&gt; [S], symbols(Sem,S).
&lt;/source&gt;

== Representing features ==

Various linguistic [[Feature (linguistics)|feature]]s can also be represented fairly concisely with DCGs by providing extra arguments to the functors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| title = DCGs give us a Natural Notation for Features
| accessdate = 2009-04-21
| url = http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/projects/milca/courses/coal/xhtml/CFG.SEC.DGSWITHFEATURES.xhtml
}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, consider the following set of DCG rules:
&lt;source lang="prolog"&gt;
 sentence --&gt; pronoun(subject), verb_phrase.
 verb_phrase --&gt; verb, pronoun(object).
 pronoun(subject) --&gt; [he].
 pronoun(subject) --&gt; [she].
 pronoun(object) --&gt; [him].
 pronoun(object) --&gt; [her].
 verb --&gt; [likes].
&lt;/source&gt;
This grammar allows sentences like "he likes her" and "he likes him", but ''not'' "her likes he" and "him likes him".

== Parsing with DCGs ==

[[Image:the bat eats a cat tree.png|thumb|An example parse tree for this grammar.]]

The main practical use of a DCG is to parse sentences of the given grammar, i.e. to construct a parse tree. This can be done by providing "extra arguments" to the functors in the DCG, like in the following rules:
&lt;source lang="prolog"&gt;
 sentence(s(NP,VP)) --&gt; noun_phrase(NP), verb_phrase(VP).
 noun_phrase(np(D,N)) --&gt; det(D), noun(N).
 verb_phrase(vp(V,NP)) --&gt; verb(V), noun_phrase(NP).
 det(d(the)) --&gt; [the].
 det(d(a)) --&gt; [a].
 noun(n(bat)) --&gt; [bat].
 noun(n(cat)) --&gt; [cat].
 verb(v(eats)) --&gt; [eats].
&lt;/source&gt;
One can now query the interpreter to yield a parse tree of any given sentence:
&lt;source lang="prolog"&gt;
 | ?- sentence(Parse_tree, [the,bat,eats,a,cat], []).
 Parse_tree = s(np(d(the),n(bat)),vp(v(eats),np(d(a),n(cat)))) ? ;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Other uses ==

DCGs can serve as a convenient syntactic sugar to hide certain parameters in code in other places besides parsing applications.
In the declaratively pure programming language [[Mercury (programming language)|Mercury]] I/O must be represented by a pair of &lt;code&gt;io.state&lt;/code&gt; arguments.
DCG notation can be used to make using I/O more covenient,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| title = Prolog to Mercury Transition Guide: Input/Output
| accessdate = 2015-03-26
| url = http://www.mercurylang.org/information/doc-release/mercury_trans_guide/IO.html
}}&lt;/ref&gt; although state variable notation is usually preferred.{{cn|date=March 2015}}
&lt;!-- This is true (I'm Paul Bone an author) but I can't easily find a reference online --&gt;
DCG notation is also used for parsing and similar things in Mercury as it is in Prolog.

== Extensions ==

Since DCGs were introduced by Pereira and Warren, several extensions have been proposed. Pereira himself proposed an extension called extraposition grammars (XGs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal
| volume = 7
| issue = 4
| pages = 243–256
| last = Pereira
| first = F.
| title = Extraposition grammars
| journal = Computational Linguistics
| year = 1981
| url = https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/J/J81/J81-4003.pdf
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This formalism was intended in part to make it easier to express certain grammatical phenomena, such as left-extraposition. Pereira states, "The difference between XG rules and DCG rules is then that the left-hand side of an XG rule may contain several symbols." This makes it easier to express rules for context-sensitive grammars.

Peter Van Roy extended DCGs to allow multiple accumulators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Source code is available at [https://github.com/mndrix/edcg].&lt;/ref&gt;

Another, more recent, extension was made by researchers at NEC Corporation called Multi-Modal Definite Clause Grammars (MM-DCGs) in 1995. Their extensions were intended to allow the recognizing and parsing expressions that include non-textual parts such as pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another extension, called definite clause translation grammars (DCTGs) was described by in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; DCTG notation looks very similar to DCG notation; the major difference is that one uses &lt;code&gt;::=&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;--&gt;&lt;/code&gt; in the rules. It was devised to handle grammatical attributes conveniently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7886">In [[proof theory]], the '''Dialectica interpretation'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| title = Über eine bisher noch nicht benützte Erweiterung des finiten Standpunktes
| author = Kurt Gödel

}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a proof interpretation of intuitionistic arithmetic ([[Heyting arithmetic]]) into a finite type extension of [[primitive recursive arithmetic]], the so-called '''System T'''.  It was developed by [[Kurt Gödel]] to provide a [[consistency proof]] of arithmetic. The name of the interpretation comes from the journal ''[[Dialectica]]'', where Gödel's paper was published in a 1958 special issue dedicated to [[Paul Bernays]] on his 70th birthday.

== Motivation ==
Via the [[Gödel–Gentzen negative translation]], the consistency of classical [[Peano arithmetic]] had already been reduced to the consistency of intuitionistic [[Heyting arithmetic]]. Gödel's motivation for developing the dialectica interpretation was to obtain a relative [[consistency]] proof for Heyting arithmetic (and hence for Peano arithmetic).

== Dialectica interpretation of intuitionistic logic  ==
The interpretation has two components: a formula translation and a proof translation. The formula translation describes how each formula &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of Heyting arithmetic is mapped to a quantifier-free formula &lt;math&gt;A_D(x; y)&lt;/math&gt; of the system T, where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are tuples of fresh variables (not appearing free in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;). Intuitively, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is interpreted as &lt;math&gt;\exists x \forall y A_D(x; y)&lt;/math&gt;. The proof translation shows how a proof of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; has enough information to witness the interpretation of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the proof of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; can be converted into a closed term &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and a proof of &lt;math&gt;A_D(t; y)&lt;/math&gt; in the system T.

=== Formula translation ===
The quantifier-free formula &lt;math&gt;A_D(x; y)&lt;/math&gt; is defined inductively on the logical structure of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; as follows, where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is an atomic formula:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{lcl}
(P)_D &amp; \equiv &amp; P \\
(A \wedge B)_D(x, v; y, w) &amp; \equiv &amp; A_D(x; y) \wedge B_D(v; w) \\
(A \vee B)_D(x, v, z; y, w) &amp; \equiv &amp; (z = 0 \rightarrow A_D(x; y)) \wedge (z \neq 0 \to B_D(v; w)) \\
(A \rightarrow B)_D(f, g; x, w) &amp; \equiv &amp; A_D(x; f x w) \rightarrow B_D(g x; w) \\
(\exists z A)_D(x, z; y) &amp; \equiv &amp; A_D(x; y) \\
(\forall z A)_D(f; y, z) &amp; \equiv &amp; A_D(f z; y)
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Proof translation (soundness) ===
The formula interpretation is such that whenever &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is provable in Heyting arithmetic then there exists a sequence of closed terms &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;A_D(t; y)&lt;/math&gt; is provable in the system T. The sequence of terms &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and the proof of &lt;math&gt;A_D(t; y)&lt;/math&gt; are constructed from the given proof of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in Heyting arithmetic. The construction of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is quite straightforward, except for the contraction axiom &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow A \wedge A&lt;/math&gt; which requires the assumption that quantifier-free formulas are decidable.

=== Characterisation principles ===
It has also been shown that Heyting arithmetic extended with the following principles

* [[Axiom of choice]]
* [[Markov's principle]]
* [[Independence of premise]] for universal formulas

is necessary and sufficient for characterising the formulas of HA which are interpretable by the Dialectica interpretation.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

== Extensions of basic interpretation ==
The basic dialectica interpretation of intuitionistic logic has been extended to various stronger systems. Intuitively, the dialectica interpretation can be applied to a stronger system, as long as the dialectica interpretation of the extra principle can be witnessed by terms in the system T (or an extension of system T).

=== Induction ===
Given [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] (which implies that the consistency of PA cannot be proven by [[Finitism|finitistic]] means) it is reasonable to expect that system T must contain non-finitistic constructions. Indeed this is the case. The non-finitistic constructions show up in the interpretation of [[mathematical induction]]. To give a Dialectica interpretation of induction, Gödel makes use of what is nowadays called Gödel's [[primitive recursive functional]]s, which are [[higher order function]]s with primitive recursive descriptions.

=== Classical logic ===
Formulas and proofs in classical arithmetic can also be given a dialectica interpretation via an initial embedding into Heyting arithmetic followed the dialectica interpretation of Heyting arithmetic. Shoenfield, in his book, combines the negative translation and the dialectica interpretation into a single interpretation of classical arithmetic.

=== Comprehension ===
In 1962 Spector
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| title = Provably recursive functionals of analysis: a consistency proof of analysis by an extension of principles in current intuitionistic mathematics
| author = Clifford Spector
| publisher = Recursive Function Theory: Proc. Symposia in Pure Mathematics
| year = 1962
| pages = 1–27
}}&lt;/ref&gt; extended Gödel's Dialectica interpretation of arithmetic to full mathematical analysis, by showing how the schema of countable choice can be given a Dialectica interpretation by extending system T with [[bar recursion]].

== Dialectica interpretation of linear logic ==
The Dialectica interpretation has been used to build a model of [[Jean-Yves Girard|Girard]]'s refinement of [[intuitionistic logic]] known as [[linear logic]], via the so-called [[Dialectica spaces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| title = The Dialectica Categories
| author = [[Valeria de Paiva]]
| url = http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-213.pdf
| publisher = University of Cambridge, Computer Laboratory, PhD Thesis, Technical Report 213
| year = 1991
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since linear logic is a refinement of intuitionistic logic, the dialectica interpretation of linear logic can also be viewed as a refinement of the dialectica interpretation of intuitionistic logic.

Although the linear interpretation in Shirahata's work &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| title = The Dialectica interpretation of first-order classical affine logic
| author = Masaru Shirahata
| url = http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/17/4/17-04abs.html
| publisher =  Theory and Applications of Categories,  Vol. 17, No. 4
| year = 2006
| pages = 49–79

}}&lt;/ref&gt; validates the weakening rule  (it is actually an interpretation of [[affine logic]]), de Paiva's  dialectica spaces interpretation does not validate weakening for arbitrary formulas.

== Variants of the Dialectica interpretation ==
Several variants of the Dialectica interpretation have been proposed since. Most notably the Diller-Nahm variant (to avoid the contraction problem) and Kohlenbach's monotone and Ferreira-Oliva bounded interpretations (to interpret [[weak König's lemma]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25086">In [[mathematics]], and more specifically in [[algebraic topology]] and [[polyhedral combinatorics]], the '''Euler characteristic''' (or '''Euler number''', or '''Euler&amp;ndash;Poincaré characteristic''') is a [[topological invariant]], a number that describes a [[topological space]]'s shape or structure regardless of the way it is bent. It is commonly denoted by &lt;math&gt; \chi &lt;/math&gt; ([[Greek alphabet|Greek lower-case letter]] [[chi (letter)|chi]]).

The Euler characteristic was originally defined for [[polyhedron|polyhedra]] and used to prove various theorems about them, including the classification of the [[Platonic solid]]s. [[Leonhard Euler]], for whom the concept is named, introduced it for polyhedra but failed to rigorously prove that it is an invariant. In modern mathematics, the Euler characteristic arises from [[homology (mathematics)|homology]] and, more abstractly, [[homological algebra]].

== Polyhedra ==
The '''Euler characteristic''' &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt; was classically defined for the surfaces of polyhedra, according to the formula

:&lt;math&gt;\chi=V-E+F &lt;/math&gt;

where ''V'', ''E'', and ''F'' are respectively the numbers of [[Vertex (geometry)|vertices]] (corners), [[Edge (geometry)|edge]]s and [[Face (geometry)|faces]] in the given polyhedron. Any [[convex polyhedron]]'s surface has Euler characteristic

:&lt;math&gt;V - E + F = 2. &lt;/math&gt;

This equation is known as '''Euler's polyhedron formula'''.&lt;ref&gt;Richeson 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It corresponds to the Euler characteristic of the [[sphere]] (i.e. χ = 2), and applies identically to [[spherical polyhedra]]. An illustration of the formula on some polyhedra is given below.

For regular polyhedra, [[Arthur Cayley]] derived a modified form of Euler's formula using the [[Density (polytope)|density]] ''D'', [[vertex figure]] density ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt;, and face density &lt;math&gt;d_f&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;d_v V - E + d_f F = 2 D.&lt;/math&gt;
This version holds both for convex polyhedra (where the densities are all 1) and the non-convex [[Kepler–Poinsot polyhedron|Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra]].

[[Projective polyhedra]] all have Euler characteristic 1, like the [[real projective plane]], while the surfaces of [[toroidal polyhedra]] all have Euler characteristic 0, like the [[torus]].

===Plane graphs===
{{See also|Planar graph#Euler's formula}}
The Euler characteristic can be defined for connected [[plane graph]]s by the same &lt;math&gt;V - E + F&lt;/math&gt; formula as for polyhedral surfaces, where ''F'' is the number of faces in the graph, including the exterior face.

The Euler characteristic of any plane connected graph G is 2. This is easily proved by induction on the number of faces determined by G, starting with a tree as the base case. For trees, &lt;math&gt; E = V-1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F = 1&lt;/math&gt;. If G has C components (disconnected graphs), the same argument by induction on F shows that &lt;math&gt;V - E + F - C = 1&lt;/math&gt;. One of the few graph theory papers of Cauchy also proves this result.

Via [[stereographic projection]] the plane maps to the two-dimensional sphere, such that a connected graph maps to a polygonal decomposition of the sphere, which has Euler characteristic 2. This viewpoint is implicit in Cauchy's proof of Euler's formula given below.

===Proof of Euler's formula===
[[Image:V-E+F=2 Proof Illustration.svg|frame|right|First steps of the proof in the case of a cube]]

There are many proofs of Euler's formula. One was given by [[Augustin Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]] in 1811, as follows. It applies to any convex polyhedron, and more generally to any polyhedron whose boundary is topologically equivalent to a sphere and whose faces are topologically equivalent to disks.

Remove one face of the polyhedral surface. By pulling the edges of the missing face away from each other, deform all the rest into a planar graph of points and curves, in such a way that the perimeter of the missing face is placed externally, surrounding the graph obtained, as illustrated by the first of the three graphs for the special case of the cube. (The assumption that the polyhedral surface is homeomorphic to the sphere at the beginning is what makes this possible.) After this deformation, the regular faces are generally not regular anymore. The number of vertices and edges has remained the same, but the number of faces has been reduced by 1.  Therefore, proving Euler's formula for the polyhedron reduces to proving ''V'' &amp;minus; ''E'' + ''F'' =1 for this deformed, planar object.

If there is a face with more than three sides, draw a diagonal—that is, a curve through the face connecting two vertices that aren't connected yet. This adds one edge and one face and does not change the number of vertices, so it does not change the quantity ''V'' &amp;minus; ''E'' + ''F''. (The assumption that all faces are disks is needed here, to show via the [[Jordan curve theorem]] that this operation increases the number of faces by one.) Continue adding edges in this manner until all of the faces are triangular.

Apply repeatedly either of the following two transformations, maintaining the invariant that the exterior boundary is always a [[simple cycle]]:
#Remove a triangle with only one edge adjacent to the exterior, as illustrated by the second graph. This decreases the number of edges and faces by one each and does not change the number of vertices, so it preserves ''V'' &amp;minus; ''E'' + ''F''.
#Remove a triangle with two edges shared by the exterior of the network, as illustrated by the third graph. Each triangle removal removes a vertex, two edges and one face, so it preserves ''V'' &amp;minus; ''E'' + ''F''.
These transformations eventually reduce the planar graph to a single triangle.  (Without the simple-cycle invariant, removing a triangle might disconnect the remaining triangles, invalidating the rest of the argument. A valid removal order is an elementary example of a [[shelling (topology)|shelling]].)

At this point the lone triangle has ''V'' = 3, ''E'' = 3, and ''F'' = 1, so that ''V'' &amp;minus; ''E'' + ''F'' = 1.  Since each of the two above transformation steps preserved this quantity, we have shown ''V'' &amp;minus; ''E'' + ''F'' = 1 for the deformed, planar object thus demonstrating ''V'' &amp;minus; ''E'' + ''F'' = 2 for the polyhedron. This proves the theorem.

For additional proofs, see ''Twenty Proofs of Euler's Formula'' by [[David Eppstein]].&lt;ref name=Eppstein2013&gt;{{cite web|last=Eppstein|first=David|title=Twenty Proofs of Euler's Formula: V-E+F=2|url=http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/euler/|accessdate=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple proofs, including their flaws and limitations, are used as examples in ''[[Proofs and Refutations]]'' by [[Imre Lakatos]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Imre Lakatos]]: [[Proofs and Refutations]], Cambridge Technology Press, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topological definition==
The polyhedral surfaces discussed above are, in modern language, two-dimensional finite [[CW-complex]]es. (When only triangular faces are used, they are two-dimensional finite [[simplicial complex]]es.) In general, for any finite CW-complex, the '''Euler characteristic''' can be defined as the alternating sum

:&lt;math&gt;\chi = k_0 - k_1 + k_2 - k_3 + \cdots,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the number of cells of dimension ''n'' in the complex.

Similarly, for a simplicial complex, the '''Euler characteristic''' equals the alternating sum

:&lt;math&gt;\chi = k_0 - k_1 + k_2 - k_3 + \cdots,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the number of ''n''-simplexes in the complex.

More generally still, for any [[topological space]], we can define the ''n''th [[Betti number]] ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; as the [[rank of an abelian group|rank]] of the ''n''-th [[singular homology]] group. The '''Euler characteristic''' can then be defined as the alternating sum

:&lt;math&gt;\chi = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + \cdots.&lt;/math&gt;

This quantity is well-defined if the Betti numbers are all finite and if they are zero beyond a certain index&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. For simplicial complexes, this is not the same definition as in the previous paragraph but a homology computation shows that the two definitions will give the same value for &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt;.

==Properties==

The Euler characteristic behaves well with respect to many basic operations on topological spaces, as follows.

===Homotopy invariance===
Homology is a topological invariant, and moreover a [[homotopy invariant]]: Two topological spaces that are [[homotopy equivalent]] have [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]] homology groups. It follows that the Euler characteristic is also a homotopy invariant.

For example, any [[contractible]] space (that is, one homotopy equivalent to a point) has trivial homology, meaning that the 0th Betti number is 1 and the others 0. Therefore, its Euler characteristic is 1. This case includes [[Euclidean space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; of any dimension, as well as the solid unit ball in any Euclidean space &amp;mdash; the one-dimensional interval, the two-dimensional disk, the three-dimensional ball, etc.

For another example, any convex polyhedron is homeomorphic to the three-dimensional [[ball (mathematics)|ball]], so its surface is homeomorphic (hence homotopy equivalent) to the two-dimensional [[sphere]], which has Euler characteristic&amp;nbsp;2. This explains why convex polyhedra have Euler characteristic 2.

===Inclusion–exclusion principle===
If ''M'' and ''N'' are any two topological spaces, then the Euler characteristic of their [[disjoint union]] is the sum of their Euler characteristics, since homology is additive under disjoint union:

:&lt;math&gt;\chi(M \sqcup N) = \chi(M) + \chi(N).&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, if ''M'' and ''N'' are subspaces of a larger space ''X'', then so are their union and intersection. In some cases, the Euler characteristic obeys a version of the [[inclusion–exclusion principle]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\chi(M \cup N) = \chi(M) + \chi(N) - \chi(M \cap N).&lt;/math&gt;

This is true in the following cases:

*if ''M'' and ''N'' are an [[excisive couple]]. In particular, if the [[interior (topology)|interiors]] of ''M'' and ''N'' inside the union still cover the union.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Spanier: Algebraic Topology, Springer 1966, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;
*if ''X'' is a [[locally compact space]], and one uses Euler characteristics with [[compact space|compact]] [[support (mathematics)|supports]], no assumptions on ''M'' or ''N'' are needed.
*if ''X'' is a [[topologically stratified space|stratified space]] all of whose strata are even-dimensional, the inclusion–exclusion principle holds if ''M'' and ''N'' are unions of strata.  This applies in particular if ''M'' and ''N'' are subvarieties of a [[complex number|complex]] [[algebraic variety]].&lt;ref&gt;William Fulton: Introduction to toric varieties, 1993, Princeton University Press, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, the inclusion–exclusion principle is false. A [[counterexample]] is given by taking ''X'' to be the [[real line]], ''M'' a [[subset]] consisting of one point and ''N'' the [[complement (set theory)|complement]] of ''M''.

===Connected sum===

For two connected closed n-manifolds &lt;math&gt;M, N&lt;/math&gt; one can obtain a new connected manifold &lt;math&gt;M \# N&lt;/math&gt;
via the [[connected sum]] operation.
The Euler characteristic is related by the formula &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://topospaces.subwiki.org/wiki/Homology_of_connected_sum
 | title = Homology of connected sum
 | access-date = 2016-07-13
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \chi(M \# N) = \chi(M) + \chi(N) - \chi(S^n).&lt;/math&gt;

===Product property===
Also, the Euler characteristic of any [[product space]] ''M'' &amp;times; ''N'' is

:&lt;math&gt;\chi(M \times N) = \chi(M) \cdot \chi(N).&lt;/math&gt;

These addition and multiplication properties are also enjoyed by [[cardinality]] of [[set (mathematics)|set]]s. In this way, the Euler characteristic can be viewed as a generalisation of cardinality; see [http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/counting/].

===Covering spaces===
{{details|Riemann–Hurwitz formula}}
Similarly, for an ''k''-sheeted [[covering space]] &lt;math&gt;\tilde{M} \to M,&lt;/math&gt; one has
:&lt;math&gt;\chi(\tilde{M}) = k \cdot \chi(M).&lt;/math&gt;
More generally, for a [[ramified covering space]], the Euler characteristic of the cover can be computed from the above, with a correction factor for the ramification points, which yields the [[Riemann–Hurwitz formula]].

===Fibration property===
The product property holds much more generally, for [[fibrations]] with certain conditions.

If &lt;math&gt;p\colon E \to B&lt;/math&gt; is a fibration with fiber ''F,'' with the base ''B'' [[path-connected]], and the fibration is orientable over a field ''K,'' then the Euler characteristic with coefficients in the field ''K'' satisfies the product property:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

This includes product spaces and covering spaces as special cases,
and can be proven by the [[Serre spectral sequence]] on homology of a fibration.

For fiber bundles, this can also be understood in terms of a [[transfer map]] &lt;math&gt;\tau\colon H_*(B) \to H_*(E)&lt;/math&gt; – note that this is a lifting and goes "the wrong way" – whose composition with the projection map &lt;math&gt;p_*\colon H_*(E) \to H_*(B)&lt;/math&gt; is multiplication by the [[Euler class]] of the fiber:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

===Surfaces===
The Euler characteristic can be calculated easily for general surfaces by finding a polygonization of the surface (that is, a description as a [[CW-complex]]) and using the above definitions.

===Soccer ball===

It is common to construct [[soccer ball]]s by stitching together pentagonal and hexagonal pieces, with three pieces meeting at each vertex (see for example the [[Adidas Telstar]]). If ''P'' pentagons and ''H'' hexagons are used, then there are ''F'' = ''P'' + ''H'' faces, ''V'' = (5 ''P'' + 6 ''H'') / 3 vertices, and ''E'' = (5 ''P'' + 6 ''H'') / 2 edges. The Euler characteristic is thus

:&lt;math&gt;V - E + F = \frac{5P + 6H}{3} - \frac{5P + 6H}{2} + P + H = \frac{P}{6}.&lt;/math&gt;

Because the sphere has Euler characteristic 2, it follows that ''P'' = 12. That is, a soccer ball constructed in this way always has 12 pentagons. In principle, the number of hexagons is unconstrained. This result is also applicable to [[fullerene]]s.

===Arbitrary dimensions===

The ''n''-dimensional sphere has singular homology groups equal to
:&lt;math&gt;H_k(S^n) = \begin{cases} \mathbb Z &amp; k=0, n \\ \{0\} &amp; \text{otherwise,} \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

hence has Betti number 1 in dimensions 0 and ''n'', and all other Betti numbers are 0. Its Euler characteristic is then 1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(−1)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;mdash; that is, either 0 or 2.

The ''n''-dimensional real [[projective space]] is the quotient of the ''n''-sphere by the [[antipodal map]]. It follows that its Euler characteristic is exactly half that of the corresponding sphere &amp;mdash; either 0 or 1.

The ''n''-dimensional torus is the product space of ''n'' circles. Its Euler characteristic is 0, by the product property. More generally, any compact [[parallelizable manifold]], including any compact [[Lie group]], has Euler characteristic 0.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Milnor|Milnor, John W.]] and Stasheff, James D.: Characteristic Classes, Princeton University Press, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

The Euler characteristic of any [[closed manifold|closed]] odd-dimensional manifold is also 0.&lt;ref&gt;Richeson 2008, p. 261&lt;/ref&gt; The case for orientable examples is a corollary of [[Poincaré duality]]. This property applies more generally to any [[compact space|compact]] [[topologically stratified space|stratified space]] all of whose strata have odd dimension. It also applies to closed odd-dimensional non-orientable manifolds, via the two-to-one [[Orientability#Orientable double cover|orientable double cover]].

== Relations to other invariants ==
The Euler characteristic of a closed [[Orientability|orientable]] [[Surface (topology)|surface]] can be calculated from its [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] ''g'' (the number of [[torus|tori]] in a [[connected sum]] decomposition of the surface; intuitively, the number of "handles") as

:&lt;math&gt;\chi = 2 - 2g.&lt;/math&gt;

The Euler characteristic of a closed non-orientable surface can be calculated from its non-orientable genus ''k'' (the number of [[real projective plane]]s in a connected sum decomposition of the surface) as

:&lt;math&gt;\chi = 2 - k.&lt;/math&gt;

For closed smooth manifolds, the Euler characteristic coincides with the '''Euler number''', i.e., the [[Euler class]] of its [[tangent bundle]] evaluated on the [[fundamental class]] of a manifold. The Euler class, in turn, relates to all other [[characteristic class]]es of [[vector bundle]]s.

For closed [[Riemannian manifold]]s, the Euler characteristic can also be found by integrating the curvature; see the [[Gauss&amp;ndash;Bonnet theorem]] for the two-dimensional case and the [[generalized Gauss&amp;ndash;Bonnet theorem]] for the general case.

A discrete analog of the Gauss&amp;ndash;Bonnet theorem is [[René Descartes|Descartes']] theorem that the "total defect" of a [[polyhedron]], measured in full circles, is the Euler characteristic of the polyhedron; see [[defect (geometry)]].

[[Hadwiger's theorem]] characterizes the Euler characteristic as the ''unique'' ([[up to]] [[scalar multiplication]]) translation-invariant, finitely additive, not-necessarily-nonnegative set function defined on [[finite unions]] of [[compact space|compact]] [[Convex polyhedron|convex]] sets in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; that is "homogeneous of degree 0".

==Generalizations==
For every combinatorial [[cell complex]], one defines the Euler characteristic as the number of 0-cells, minus the number of 1-cells, plus the number of 2-cells, etc., if this alternating sum is finite. In particular, the Euler characteristic of a finite set is simply its cardinality, and the Euler characteristic of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] is the number of vertices minus the number of edges.&lt;ref&gt;Olaf Post calls this a "well-known formula": {{citation|first=Olaf|last=Post|contribution=Spectral analysis of metric graphs and related spaces|title=Limits of graphs in group theory and computer science|location=Lausanne, Switzerland|publisher=[[EPFL Press]]|year=2009|pages=109–140|arxiv=0712.1507 |bibcode=2007arXiv0712.1507P}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, one can define the Euler characteristic of any [[chain complex]] to be the alternating sum of the [[rank of an abelian group|ranks]] of the homology groups of the chain complex, assuming that all these ranks are finite.&lt;ref&gt;nLab, "[https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Euler+characteristic Euler characteristic]"&lt;/ref&gt;

A version of Euler characteristic used in [[algebraic geometry]] is as follows. For any [[coherent sheaf]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; on a proper [[Scheme (mathematics)|scheme]] ''X'', one defines its Euler characteristic to be
:&lt;math&gt;\chi ( \mathcal{F})= \sum_i (-1)^i h^i(X,\mathcal{F}),&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;h^i(X, \mathcal{F}) &lt;/math&gt; is the dimension of the ''i''-th [[sheaf cohomology]] group of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, the dimensions are all finite by [[Coherent_sheaf_cohomology#Finite-dimensionality_of_cohomology|Grothendieck's finiteness theorem]]. This is an instance of the Euler characteristic of a chain complex, where the chain complex is a finite resolution of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; by acyclic sheaves.

Another generalization of the concept of Euler characteristic on manifolds comes from [[orbifold]]s (see [[Euler characteristic of an orbifold]]).  While every manifold has an integer Euler characteristic, an orbifold can have a fractional Euler characteristic.  For example, the teardrop orbifold has Euler characteristic 1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1/''p'', where ''p'' is a prime number corresponding to the cone angle 2''{{pi}}''&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''p''.

The concept of Euler characteristic of a bounded finite [[partially ordered set|poset]] is another generalization, important in [[combinatorics]].  A poset is "bounded" if it has smallest and largest elements; call them 0 and 1.  The Euler characteristic of such a poset is defined as the integer ''μ''(0,1), where ''μ'' is the [[Möbius function]] in that poset's [[incidence algebra]].

This can be further generalized by defining a '''Q'''-valued Euler characteristic for certain finite [[category (mathematics)|categories]], a notion compatible with the Euler characteristics of graphs, orbifolds and posets mentioned above. In this setting, the Euler characteristic of a finite [[group (mathematics)|group]] or [[monoid]] ''G'' is 1/|''G''|, and the Euler characteristic of a finite [[groupoid]] is the sum of 1/|''G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''|, where we picked one representative group ''G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' for each connected component of the groupoid.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Leinster, "[http://www.math.uiuc.edu/documenta/vol-13/02.pdf The Euler characteristic of a category]", ''Documenta Mathematica'', 13 (2008), pp. 21&amp;ndash;49&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12148">In [[theoretical physics]] and [[applied mathematics]], a '''field equation''' is a [[partial differential equation]] which determines the dynamics of a [[physical field]], specifically the time evolution and spatial distribution of the field. The solutions to the equation are mathematical functions which correspond directly to the field, as functions of time and space. Since the field equation is a partial differential equation, there are families of solutions which represent a variety of physical possibilities. Usually, there is not just a single equation, but a set of coupled equations which must be solved simultaneously. Field equations are not [[ordinary differential equation]]s since a field depends on space and time, which requires at least two variables.

Whereas the "[[wave equation]]", the "[[diffusion equation]]", and the "[[continuity equation]]" all have standard forms (and various special cases or generalizations), there is no single, special equation referred to as "the field equation".

The topic broadly splits into equations of [[classical field theory]] and [[quantum field theory]]. Classical field equations describe many physical properties like temperature of a substance, velocity of a fluid, stresses in an elastic material, electric and magnetic fields from a current, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fetter|first1=A.

D.|last=Jackson|authorlink=John David Jackson (physicist)|title=Classical Electrodynamics|pages=|edition=2nd|year=1975|orig-year=1962|isbn=0-471-43132-X|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Landau|first1=L.D.|authorlink1=Lev Landau|last2=Lifshitz|first2=E.M.|authorlink2=Evgeny Lifshitz|title=The Classical Theory of Fields|series=Course of Theoretical Physics|volume=2|edition=4th|publisher=[[Butterworth&amp;ndash;Heinemann]]|isbn=0 7506 2768 9|year=2002|orig-year=1939|page=297}}&lt;/ref&gt; In quantum field theory, particles or systems of "particles" like [[electron]]s and [[photon]]s are associated with fields, allowing for infinite degrees of freedom (unlike finite degrees of freedom in particle mechanics) and variable particle numbers which can be [[Matter creation|created]] or [[Annihilation|annihilated]].

==Generalities==

===Origin===

Usually, field equations are postulated (like the [[Einstein field equations]] and the [[Schrödinger equation]], which underlies all quantum field equations) or obtained from the results of experiments (like [[Maxwell's equations]]). The extent of their validity is their extent to correctly predict and agree with experimental results.

From a theoretical viewpoint, field equations can be formulated in the frameworks of [[Lagrangian field theory]], [[Hamiltonian field theory]], and field theoretic formulations of the [[principle of stationary action]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Goldstein |first1=Herbert |authorlink1=Herbert Goldstein | title=Classical Mechanics |edition=2nd |year=1980|isbn= 0201029189|publisher=Addison Wesley |chapter=Chapter 12: Continuous Systems and Fields|location=San Francisco, CA |pages=548, 562}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given a suitable Lagrangian or Hamiltonian density, a function of the fields in a given system, as well as their derivatives, the principle of stationary action will obtain the field equation.

===Symmetry===

In both classical and quantum theories, field equations will satisfy the symmetry of the background physical theory. Most of the time [[Galilean symmetry]] is enough, for speeds (of propagating fields) much less than light. When particles and fields propagate at speeds close to light, [[Lorentz symmetry]] is one of the most common settings because the equation and its solutions are then consistent with special relativity.

Another symmetry arises from [[gauge freedom]], which is intrinsic to the field equations. Fields which correspond to interactions may be [[gauge field]]s, which means they can be derived from a potential, and certain values of potentials correspond to the same value of the field.

===Classification===

Field equations can be classified in many ways: classical or quantum, nonrelativistsic or relativistic, according to the [[spin (physics)|spin]] or [[mass]] of the field, and the number of components the field has and how they change under coordinate transformations (e.g. [[scalar field]]s, [[vector field]]s, [[tensor field]]s, [[spinor field]]s, [[Twistor theory|twistor field]]s etc.). They can also inherit the classification of differential equations, as [[Linear partial differential equation|linear]] or [[Nonlinear partial differential equation|nonlinear]], the order of the highest derivative, or even as [[fractional differential equation]]s. Gauge fields may be classified as in [[group theory]], as [[abelian group|abelian]] or nonabelian.

=== Waves ===

Field equations underlie wave equations, because periodically changing fields generate waves. Wave equations can be thought of as field equations, in the sense they can often be derived from field equations. Alternatively, given suitable Lagrangian or Hamiltonian densities and using the principle of stationary action, the wave equations can be obtained also.

For example, Maxwell's equations can be used to derive [[inhomogeneous electromagnetic wave equation]]s, and from the Einstein field equations one can derive equations for [[gravitational wave]]s.

=== Supplementary equations to field equations ===

Not every partial differential equation (PDE) in physics is automatically called a "field equation", even if fields are involved. They are extra equations to provide additional constraints for a given physical system.

"[[Continuity equation]]s" and "[[diffusion equation]]s" describe [[transport phenomena]], even though they may involve fields which influence the transport processes.

If a "[[constitutive equation]]" takes the form of a PDE and involves fields, it is not usually called a field equation because it does not govern the dynamical behaviour of the fields. They relate one field to another, in a given material. Constitutive equations are used along with field equations when the effects of matter need to be taken into account.

==Classical field equation==

{{main|classical mechanics|classical field theory}}

Classical field equations arise in [[continuum mechanics]] (including [[elastodynamics]] and [[fluid mechanics]]), [[heat transfer]], [[electromagnetism]], and [[gravitation]].

Fundamental classical field equations include

*[[Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation]] for nonrelativistic gravitation.
*[[Einstein field equations]] for [[General Relativity|relativistic gravitation]]
*[[Maxwell's equations]] for electromagnetism.

Important equations derived from fundamental laws include:

*[[Navier–Stokes equations]] for fluid flow.

As part of real-life [[mathematical modelling]] processes, classical field equations are accompanied by other [[equations of motion]], [[equations of state]], [[constitutive equation]]s, and continuity equations.

==Quantum field equation==
{{main|quantum mechanics|quantum field theory}}

In quantum field theory, particles are described by quantum fields which satisfy the [[Schrödinger equation]]. They are also [[creation and annihilation operators]] which satisfy [[commutation relation]]s and are subject to the [[spin–statistics theorem]].

Particular cases of [[relativistic quantum field equations]] include&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=1-139-50432-0|first=T|last=Ohlsson|title=Relativistic Quantum Physics: From Advanced Quantum Mechanics to Introductory Quantum Field Theory|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|pages=23, 42, 44|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hRavtAW5EFcC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=pauli-lubanski+pseudovector#v=onepage&amp;q=pauli-lubanski%20pseudovector&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*the [[Klein–Gordon equation]] for spin-0 particles
*the [[Dirac equation]] for spin-1/2 particles
*the [[Bargmann–Wigner equations]] for particles of any spin

In quantum field equations, it is common to use [[momentum]] components of the particle instead of position coordinates of the particle's location, the fields are in [[momentum space]] and [[Fourier transform]]s relate them to the position representation.

[[File:AtmosphericModelSchematic.png|thumb|right|350px|Climate models are systems of [[differential equation]]s based on the basic laws of [[physics]], [[Fluid dynamics|fluid motion]], and [[chemistry]]. To "run" a model, scientists divide the planet into a 3-dimensional grid, apply the basic equations, and evaluate the results. Atmospheric models calculate [[winds]], [[heat transfer]], [[radiation]], [[relative humidity]], and surface [[hydrology]] within each grid and evaluate interactions with neighboring points.&lt;ref name=noaa200/&gt;]]

A '''general circulation model''' ('''GCM''') is a type of [[climate model]]. It employs a [[mathematical model]] of the general circulation of a planetary [[atmosphere]] or ocean. It uses the [[Navier–Stokes equations]] on a rotating sphere with [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] terms for various energy sources ([[radiation]], [[latent heat]]). These equations are the basis for computer programs used to [[simulation|simulate]] the Earth's atmosphere or oceans. Atmospheric and oceanic GCMs (AGCM and [[Ocean general circulation model|OGCM]]) are key components along with [[sea ice]] and land-surface components.

GCMs and global climate models are used for [[weather forecasting]], understanding the [[climate]] and forecasting [[climate change]].

Versions designed for decade to century time scale climate applications were originally created by [[Syukuro Manabe]] and [[Kirk Bryan (oceanographer)|Kirk Bryan]] at the [[Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory]] (GFDL) in [[Princeton, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="noaa200"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://celebrating200years.noaa.gov/breakthroughs/climate_model/welcome.html |title=: The First Climate Model |publisher=NOAA 200th Celebration |year=2007 |accessdate=20 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These models are based on the integration of a variety of fluid dynamical, chemical and sometimes biological equations.

==Terminology==
The acronym ''GCM'' originally stood for ''General Circulation Model''. Recently, a second meaning came into use, namely ''Global Climate Model''. While these do not refer to the same thing, General Circulation Models are typically the tools used for [[climate model|modelling climate]], and hence the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably. However, the term "global climate model" is ambiguous and may refer to an integrated framework that incorporates multiple components including a general circulation model, or may refer to the general class of [[climate model]]s that use a variety of means to represent the climate mathematically.

==History==
{{See also|Numerical weather prediction#History}}
In 1956, Norman Phillips developed a mathematical model that could realistically depict monthly and seasonal patterns in the [[troposphere]]. It became the first successful [[climate model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Atmospheric and oceanic models==
{{Further|Atmospheric model|Oceanic model}}
Atmospheric (AGCMs) and oceanic GCMs (OGCMs) can be coupled to form an atmosphere-ocean coupled general circulation model (CGCM or AOGCM). With the addition of submodels such as a sea ice model or a model for [[evapotranspiration]] over land, AOGCMs become the basis for a full climate model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Pubs.GISS: Sun and Hansen 2003: Climate simulations for 1951-2050 with a coupled atmosphere-ocean model|url = http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/abs/su04000r.html|website = pubs.giss.nasa.gov|accessdate = 2015-08-25|year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trends==
A recent trend in GCMs is to apply them as components of Earth system models, e.g. by coupling [[ice sheet model]]s for the dynamics of the [[Greenland ice sheet|Greenland]] and [[Antarctic ice sheet]]s, and one or more [[chemical transport model]]s (CTMs) for [[chemical species|species]] important to climate. Thus a [[Carbon cycle#Carbon cycle modelling|carbon CTM]] may allow a GCM to better predict [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] changes in [[carbon dioxide]] concentrations. In addition, this approach allows accounting for inter-system feedback: e.g. chemistry-climate models allow the possible effects of climate change on [[Ozone depletion|ozone hole]] to be studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theozonehole.com/climate.htm |title=Tango in the Atmosphere: Ozone and Climate Change |publisher=NASA Earth Observatory |accessdate=20 April 2010 |date=February 2004 |first=Jeannie |last=Allen }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate prediction uncertainties depend on uncertainties in chemical, physical and social models (see [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] scenarios below).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal   | last = Ken   | first = Richard A
  | title = Global Warming: Rising Global Temperature, Rising Uncertainty   | journal=Science   | volume = 292   | issue=5515

  | doi = 10.1126/science.292.5515.192   | accessdate =20 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant uncertainties and unknowns remain, especially regarding the future course of human population, industry and technology.

==Structure==
Three-dimensional (more properly four-dimensional) GCMs apply discrete equations for fluid motion and integrate these forward in time. They contain parameterisations for processes such as [[convection]] that occur on scales too small to be resolved directly.

A simple general circulation model (SGCM) consists of a dynamic core that relates properties such as temperature to others such as pressure and velocity. Examples are programs that solve the [[primitive equations]], given energy input and energy [[dissipation]] in the form of scale-dependent [[friction]], so that [[atmospheric wave]]s with the highest [[wavenumber]]s are most attenuated. Such models may be used to study atmospheric processes, but are not suitable for climate projections.

Atmospheric GCMs (AGCMs) model the atmosphere (and typically contain a land-surface model as well) using imposed [[sea surface temperature]]s (SSTs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/projects/amip/index.php |title=Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project |publisher=The Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory |accessdate=21 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They may include atmospheric chemistry.

AGCMs consist of a dynamical core which integrates the equations of fluid motion, typically for:

* surface pressure
* horizontal components of velocity in layers
* temperature and water vapor in layers
* radiation, split into solar/short wave and terrestrial/[[infrared]]/long wave
* [[Parametrization (climate)|parameters]] for:
** convection
** land surface processes
** [[albedo]] 
** [[hydrology]]
** cloud cover

A GCM contains [[prognostic equation]]s that are a function of time (typically winds, temperature, moisture, and surface pressure) together with [[diagnostic equation]]s that are evaluated from them for a specific time period. As an example, pressure at any height can be diagnosed by applying the [[hydrostatic equation]] to the predicted surface pressure and the predicted values of temperature between the surface and the height of interest. Pressure is used to compute the pressure gradient force in the time-dependent equation for the winds.

OGCMs model the ocean (with fluxes from the atmosphere imposed) and may contain a [[sea ice]] model. For example, the standard resolution of [[HadCM3#Ocean model (HadOM3)|HadOM3]] is 1.25 degrees in latitude and longitude, with 20 vertical levels, leading to approximately 1,500,000 variables.

AOGCMs (e.g. [[HadCM3]], [[GFDL CM2.X]]) combine the two submodels. They remove the need to specify fluxes across the interface of the ocean surface. These models are the basis for model predictions of future climate, such as are discussed by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]]. AOGCMs internalise as many processes as possible. They have been used to provide predictions at a regional scale. While the simpler models are generally susceptible to analysis and their results are easier to understand, AOGCMs may be nearly as hard to analyse as the climate itself.

===Grid===
The fluid equations for AGCMs are made discrete using either the [[finite difference method]] or the [[spectral method]]. For finite differences, a grid is imposed on the atmosphere. The simplest grid uses constant angular grid spacing (i.e., a latitude / longitude grid). However, non-rectangular grids (e.g., icosahedral) and grids of variable resolution&lt;ref&gt;C.

[[HadGEM1]] (and other ocean models) use an ocean grid with higher resolution in the tropics to help resolve processes believed to be important for the [[El Niño|El Niño Southern Oscillation]] (ENSO). Spectral models generally use a [[gaussian grid]], because of the mathematics of transformation between spectral and grid-point space. Typical AGCM resolutions are between 1 and 5 degrees in latitude or longitude: HadCM3, for example, uses 3.75 in longitude and 2.5 degrees in latitude, giving a grid of 96 by 73 points (96 x 72 for some variables); and has 19 vertical levels. This results in approximately 500,000 "basic" variables, since each grid point has four variables ([[Wind speed|''u'',''v'']], [[Temperature|''T'']], [[Humidity|''Q'']]), though a full count would give more (clouds; soil levels). HadGEM1 uses a grid of 1.875 degrees in longitude and 1.25 in latitude in the atmosphere; HiGEM, a high-resolution variant, uses 1.25 x 0.83 degrees respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

For a standard finite difference model, uniform gridlines converge towards the poles. This would lead to computational instabilities (see [[Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy condition|CFL condition]]) and so the model variables must be filtered along lines of latitude close to the poles. Ocean models suffer from this problem too, unless a rotated grid is used in which the North Pole is shifted onto a nearby landmass. Spectral models do not suffer from this problem. Some experiments use [[geodesic grid]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=3 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and icosahedral grids, which (being more uniform) do not have pole-problems. Another approach to solving the grid spacing problem is to deform a [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]] [[cube]] such that it covers the surface of a sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gridding the sphere|url=http://mitgcm.org/projects/cubedsphere/|work=MIT GCM|accessdate=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flux buffering===
Some early versions of AOGCMs required an ''ad hoc'' process of "flux correction" to achieve a stable climate. This resulted from separately prepared ocean and atmospheric models that each used an implicit flux from the other component different than that component could produce. Such a model failed to match observations. However, if the fluxes were 'corrected', the factors that led to these unrealistic fluxes might be unrecognised, which could affect model sensitivity. As a result, the vast majority of models used in the current round of IPCC reports do not use them. The model improvements that now make flux corrections unnecessary include improved ocean physics, improved resolution in both atmosphere and ocean, and more physically consistent coupling between atmosphere and ocean submodels. Improved models now maintain stable, multi-century simulations of surface climate that are considered to be of sufficient quality to allow their use for climate projections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IPCC Third Assessment Report - Climate Change 2001 - Complete online versions|url=http://www.grida.no/publications/other/ipcc_tar/?src=/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/309.htm|publisher=IPCC|accessdate=12 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112230927/http://www.grida.no/publications/other/ipcc_tar/?src=%2Fclimate%2Fipcc_tar%2Fwg1%2F309.htm|archivedate=12 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Convection===
Moist convection releases latent heat and is important to the Earth's energy budget. Convection occurs on too small a scale to be resolved by climate models, and hence it must be handled via parameters. This has been done since the 1950s. Akio Arakawa did much of the early work, and variants of his scheme are still used,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aip.org/history/climate/arakawa.htm |title=Arakawa's Computation Device |publisher=Aip.org |accessdate=2012-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; although a variety of different schemes are now in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grads.iges.org/reps/rep27/colarep27.html |title=COLA Report 27 |publisher=Grads.iges.org |date=1996-07-01 |accessdate=2012-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206085956/http://grads.iges.org/reps/rep27/colarep27.html |archivedate=6 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/projects/modeldoc/amip/10Tbl2.10.html |title=Table 2-10 |publisher=Pcmdi.llnl.gov |accessdate=2012-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rainbow.llnl.gov/projects/modeldoc/cmip/table4.html |title=Table of Rudimentary CMIP Model Features |publisher=Rainbow.llnl.gov |date=2004-12-02 |accessdate=2012-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clouds are also typically handled with a parameter, for a similar lack of scale. Limited understanding of clouds has limited the success of this strategy, but not due to some inherent shortcoming of the method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aip.org/history/climate/GCM.htm |title=General Circulation Models of the Atmosphere |publisher=Aip.org |accessdate=2012-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Software===
Most models include software to diagnose a wide range of variables for comparison with observations or [[process study|study of atmospheric processes]]. An example is the 2-metre temperature, which is the standard height for near-surface observations of air temperature. This temperature is not directly predicted from the model but is deduced from surface and lowest-model-layer temperatures. Other software is used for creating plots and animations.

Coupled AOGCMs use [[transient climate simulation]]s to project/predict climate changes under various scenarios. These can be idealised scenarios (most commonly, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions increasing at 1%/yr) or based on recent history (usually the "IS92a" or more recently the [[Special Report on Emissions Scenarios|SRES]] scenarios). Which scenarios are most realistic remains uncertain.

The 2001 [[IPCC Third Assessment Report]] F [https://web.archive.org/web/20160303212120/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/fig9-3.htm igure 9.3] shows the global mean response of 19 different coupled models to an idealised experiment in which emissions increased at 1% per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/348.htm#fig93 |title=Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis |publisher=Grida.no |accessdate=2012-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218141613/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/348.htm#fig93 |archivedate=18 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [https://web.archive.org/web/20160303170118/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/fig9-5.htm Figure 9.5] shows the response of a smaller number of models to more recent trends. For the 7 climate models shown there, the temperature change to 2100 varies from 2 to 4.5&amp;nbsp;°C with a median of about 3&amp;nbsp;°C.

Future scenarios do not include unknown events{{snd}} for example, volcanic eruptions or changes in solar forcing. These effects are believed to be small in comparison to [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) forcing in the long term, but large volcanic eruptions, for example, can exert a substantial temporary cooling effect.

Human GHG emissions are a model input, although it is possible to include an economic/technological submodel to provide these as well. Atmospheric GHG levels are usually supplied as an input, though it is possible to include a carbon cycle model that reflects vegetation and oceanic processes to calculate such levels.

===Emissions scenarios===

For the six SRES marker scenarios, IPCC (2007:7–8) gave a "best estimate" of global mean temperature increase (2090–2099 relative to the period 1980–1999) of 1.8&amp;nbsp;°C to 4.0&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="ar4 spm projections"/&gt; Over the same time period, the "likely" range (greater than 66% probability, based on expert judgement) for these scenarios was for a global mean temperature increase of 1.1 to 6.4&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="ar4 spm projections"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In a scenario where global emissions start to decrease by 2010 and then declined at a sustained rate of 3% per year, the likely global average temperature increase was predicted to be 1.7&amp;nbsp;°C above pre-industrial levels by 2050, rising to around 2&amp;nbsp;°C by 2100. In a projection designed to simulate a future where no efforts are made to reduce global emissions, the likely rise in global average temperature was predicted to be 5.5&amp;nbsp;°C by 2100. A rise as high as 7&amp;nbsp;°C was thought possible, although less likely.

Another no-reduction scenario resulted in a median warming over land (2090–99 relative to the period 1980–99) of 5.1&amp;nbsp;°C. Under the same emissions scenario but with a different model, the predicted median warming was 4.1&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

AOGCMs internalise as many processes as are sufficiently understood. However, they are still under development and significant uncertainties remain. They may be coupled to models of other processes, such as the [[carbon cycle]], so as to better model feedbacks. Most recent simulations show "plausible" agreement with the measured temperature anomalies over the past 150 years, when driven by observed changes in greenhouse gases and aerosols. Agreement improves by including both natural and anthropogenic forcings.&lt;ref name='f4'&gt;IPCC, [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/005.htm Summary for Policy Makers]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307220102/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/005.htm |date=7 March 2016 }}, [http://www.grida.no/publications/other/ipcc%5Ftar/?src=/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/figspm-4.htm  Figure 4]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021094407/http://www.grida.no/publications/other/ipcc_tar/?src=%2Fclimate%2Fipcc_tar%2Fwg1%2Ffigspm-4.htm |date=21 October 2016 }}, in {{citation

Imperfect models may nevertheless produce useful results. GCMs are capable of reproducing the general features of the observed global temperature over the past century.&lt;ref name='f4'/&gt;

A debate over how to reconcile climate model predictions that upper air (tropospheric) warming should be greater than observed surface warming, some of which appeared to show otherwise,&lt;ref&gt;The National Academies Press website press release, Jan. 12, 2000:

[[clouds|Cloud]] effects are a significant area of uncertainty in climate models. Clouds have competing effects on climate. They cool the surface by reflecting sunlight into space; they warm it by increasing the amount of infrared radiation transmitted from the atmosphere to the surface.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000901022925/http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/academy/space/greenhouse.html Nasa Liftoff to Space Exploration Website: Greenhouse Effect].

Climate researchers around the world use climate models to understand the climate system. Thousands of papers have been published about model-based studies. Part of this research is to improve the models.

In 2000, a comparison between measurements and dozens of GCM simulations of [[ENSO]]-driven tropical precipitation, water vapor, temperature, and outgoing longwave radiation found similarity between measurements and simulation of most factors. However the simulated change in precipitation was about one-fourth less than what was observed. Errors in simulated precipitation imply errors in other processes, such as errors in the evaporation rate that provides moisture to create precipitation. The other possibility is that the satellite-based measurements are in error. Either indicates progress is required in order to monitor and predict such changes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ams.allenpress.com/amsonline/?request=get-abstract&amp;doi=10.1175%2F1520-0442(2000)013%3C0538:TSOTTH%3E2.0.CO%3B2 ]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The model mean exhibits good agreement with observations.
* The individual models often exhibit worse agreement with observations.
* Many of the non-flux adjusted models suffered from unrealistic climate drift up to about 1&amp;nbsp;°C/century in global mean surface temperature.
* The errors in model-mean surface air temperature rarely exceed 1&amp;nbsp;°C over the oceans and 5&amp;nbsp;°C over the continents; precipitation and sea level pressure errors are relatively greater but the magnitudes and patterns of these quantities are recognisably similar to observations.
* Surface air temperature is particularly well simulated, with nearly all models closely matching the observed magnitude of variance and exhibiting a correlation &gt; 0.95 with the observations.
* Simulated variance of sea level pressure and precipitation is within ±25% of observed.
* All models have shortcomings in their simulations of the present day climate of the stratosphere, which might limit the accuracy of predictions of future climate change.
** There is a tendency for the models to show a global mean cold bias at all levels.
** There is a large scatter in the tropical temperatures.
** The [[polar night jet]]s in most models are inclined poleward with height, in noticeable contrast to an equatorward inclination of the observed jet.
** There is a differing degree of separation in the models between the winter [[sub-tropical jet]] and the polar night jet.
* For nearly all models the r.m.s. error in zonal- and annual-mean surface air temperature is small compared with its natural variability.
** There are problems in simulating natural seasonal variability. {{citation needed|date=September 2011}} [http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/abstracts/2000/CoveyAbeOuchi.html ( 2000)]
*** In flux-adjusted models, seasonal variations are simulated to within 2 [[kelvin|K]] of observed values over the oceans. The corresponding average over non-flux-adjusted models shows errors up to about 6 K in extensive ocean areas.
*** Near-surface land temperature errors are substantial in the average over flux-adjusted models, which systematically underestimates (by about 5 K) temperature in areas of elevated terrain. The corresponding average over non-flux-adjusted models forms a similar error pattern (with somewhat increased amplitude) over land.
*** In Southern Ocean mid-latitudes, the non-flux-adjusted models overestimate the magnitude of January-minus-July temperature differences by ~5 K due to an overestimate of summer (January) near-surface temperature. This error is common to five of the eight non-flux-adjusted models.
*** Over Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude land areas, zonal mean differences between July and January temperatures simulated by the non-flux-adjusted models show a greater spread (positive and negative) about observed values than results from the flux-adjusted models.
*** The ability of coupled GCMs to simulate a reasonable seasonal cycle is a necessary condition for confidence in their prediction of long-term climatic changes (such as global warming), but it is not a sufficient condition unless the seasonal cycle and long-term changes involve similar climatic processes.
* Coupled climate models do not simulate with reasonable accuracy clouds and some related hydrological processes (in particular those involving upper tropospheric humidity). Problems in the simulation of clouds and upper tropospheric humidity, remain worrisome because the associated processes account for most of the uncertainty in climate model simulations of anthropogenic change.

The IPCC's [[IPCC AR5|Fifth Assessment Report]] asserted "...very high confidence that models reproduce the general features of the global-scale annual mean surface temperature increase over the historical period."

==Relation to weather forecasting==
The global climate models used for climate projections are similar in structure to (and often share computer code with) [[numerical weather prediction|numerical models for weather prediction]], but are nonetheless logically distinct.

Most [[weather forecasting]] is done on the basis of interpreting numerical model results. Since forecasts are short{{snd}} typically a few days or a week{{snd}} such models do not usually contain an ocean model but rely on imposed SSTs. They also require accurate initial conditions to begin the forecast{{snd}} typically these are taken from the output of a previous forecast, blended with observations. Predictions must require only a few hours; but because they only cover a one-week the models can be run at higher resolution than in climate mode. Currently the [[ECMWF]] runs at {{convert|9|km|abbr=on|adj=on}} resolution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecmwf.int/index_forecasts.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503014123/http://www.ecmwf.int/index_forecasts.html |archivedate=3 May 2008 |df= }} [http://www.ecmwf.int/sites/default/files/elibrary/2016/16299-newsletter-no147-spring-2016.pdf ECMWF-Newsletter spring 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to the {{convert|100|to|200|km|abbr=on|adj=on}} scale used by typical climate model runs. Often local models are run using global model results for boundary conditions, to achieve higher local resolution: for example, the [[Met Office]] runs a mesoscale model with an {{convert|11|km|abbr=on|adj=on}} resolution&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20010210225524/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/nwp/numerical/operational/index.html ]&lt;/ref&gt; covering the UK, and various agencies in the US employ models such as the NGM and NAM models. Like most global numerical weather prediction models such as the [[Global Forecast System|GFS]], global climate models are often spectral models&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-das.uwyo.edu/~geerts/cwx/notes/chap12/nwp_gcm.html |title=What are general circulation models (GCM)? |publisher=Das.uwyo.edu |accessdate=2012-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead of grid models. Spectral models are often used for global models because some computations in modeling can be performed faster, thus reducing run times.

==Computations==
Climate models use [[quantitative method]]s to simulate the interactions of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], oceans, [[land surface]] and [[cryosphere|ice]].

All climate models take account of incoming energy as short wave [[electromagnetic radiation]], chiefly [[Visible spectrum|visible]] and short-wave (near) [[infrared]], as well as outgoing energy as long wave (far) infrared electromagnetic radiation from the earth. Any imbalance results in a [[First law of thermodynamics|change in temperature]].

The most talked-about models of recent years relate temperature to [[exhaust gas|emission]]s of [[greenhouse gas]]es. These models project an upward trend in the [[surface temperature record]], as well as a more rapid increase in temperature at higher altitudes.&lt;ref&gt;Meehl ''et al.'', [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch10.html Climate Change 2007 Chapter 10: Global Climate Projections] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415020743/http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch10.html |date=15 April 2016 }},{{Page needed|date=December 2011}} in {{Citation

Three (or more properly, four since time is also considered) dimensional GCM's discretise the equations for fluid motion and energy transfer and integrate these over time. They also contain parametrisations for processes such as convection that occur on scales too small to be resolved directly.

Atmospheric GCMs (AGCMs) model the atmosphere and impose [[sea surface temperature]]s as boundary conditions. Coupled atmosphere-ocean GCMs (AOGCMs, e.g. [[HadCM3]], [[EdGCM]], [[GFDL CM2.X]], ARPEGE-Climat&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnrm.meteo.fr/gmapdoc/spip.php?article202  ARPEGE-Climat homepage, Version 5.1] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104172118/http://www.cnrm.meteo.fr/gmapdoc/spip.php?article202 |date=4 January 2016 }}, 3 Sep 2009.

Retrieved 1 Oct 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;) combine the two models.

Models range in complexity:

* A simple [[radiant heat]] transfer model treats the earth as a single point and averages outgoing energy
* This can be expanded vertically (radiative-convective models), or horizontally
* Finally, (coupled) atmosphere–ocean–[[sea ice]] global climate models discretise and solve the full equations for mass and energy transfer and radiant exchange.
* Box models treat flows across and within ocean basins.

Other submodels can be interlinked, such as [[land use]], allowing researchers to predict the interaction between climate and ecosystems.

== Definition and properties ==

===  Abstract definition ===
The {{mvar|n}}-dimensional generalized Clifford algebra is defined as an associative algebra over a field {{mvar|F}}, generated by&lt;ref&gt;For a serviceable review, 
see  Vourdas A. (2004), "Quantum systems with finite Hilbert space",  ''Rep. Prog. Phys.''  '''67'''  267.  {{doi|10.1088/0034-4885/67/3/R03}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;e_j e_k = \omega_{jk} e_k e_j \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\omega_{jk} e_l = e_l \omega_{jk} \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\omega_{jk} \omega_{lm} = \omega_{lm} \omega_{jk} \,&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;e_j^{N_j} = 1 = \omega_{jk}^{N_j} = \omega_{jk}^{N_k} \,&lt;/math&gt;
{{math|∀ ''j'',''k'',''l'',''m'' {{=}} 1,...,''n''}}.

Moreover, in any irreducible matrix representation, relevant for physical applications, it is required that
:&lt;math&gt;\omega_{jk} = \omega_{kj}^{-1} = e^{2\pi i \nu_{kj}/N_{kj}}&lt;/math&gt;
{{math|∀ ''j'',''k'' {{=}} 1,...,''n''}},  &amp;nbsp; and &lt;math&gt;N_{kj} =&lt;/math&gt;[[Greatest common divisor|gcd]]&lt;math&gt; (N_j,N_k)&lt;/math&gt;.  The field {{mvar|F}} is usually taken to be the complex numbers '''C'''.

=== More specific definition ===
 {{Main article|Generalizations of Pauli matrices}}
In the more common cases of GCA,&lt;ref name="granik-et-al-1996"&gt;See for example: A. Granik, M. Ross: ''On a new basis for a Generalized Clifford Algebra and its application to quantum mechanics'', in: Rafal Ablamowicz, Joseph Parra, Pertti Lounesto (eds.): ''Clifford Algebras with Numeric and Symbolic Computation Applications'', Birkhäuser, 1996, {{ISBN|0-8176-3907-1}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=OpbY_abijtwC&amp;pg=PA101 p. 101]–110&lt;/ref&gt; the {{mvar|n}}-dimensional generalized Clifford algebra of order {{mvar|p}} has the property {{math| ''ω&lt;sub&gt;kj&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''ω''}}, &lt;math&gt;N_k=p&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;  for all ''j'',''k'', and &lt;math&gt;\nu_{kj}=1&lt;/math&gt;.  It follows that 
:&lt;math&gt;e_j e_k = \omega \, e_k e_j \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\omega e_l = e_l \omega \,&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;e_j^{p} = 1 = \omega^{p} \,&lt;/math&gt;
for all ''j'',''k'',l = 1,...,''n'', and 
:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \omega^{-1} = e^{2\pi i /p}&lt;/math&gt;
is the {{mvar|p}}th root of 1.

There exist several definitions of a Generalized Clifford Algebra in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the review provided in: Tara L. Smith: [https://math.uc.edu/~tsmith/papers/CliffAlg.pdf ''Decomposition of Generalized Clifford Algebras'']&lt;/ref&gt;

;Clifford algebra
In the (orthogonal) Clifford algebra, the elements follow an anticommutation rule, with {{math|''ω'' {{=}} −1, and ''p'' {{=}} 2}}.

== Matrix representation ==
{{Main article|Generalizations of Pauli matrices#Construction: The clock and shift matrices}}
The Clock and Shift matrices can be represented&lt;ref&gt;[[Alladi Ramakrishnan]]: ''Generalized Clifford Algebra and its applications – A new approach to internal quantum numbers'', [http://www.imsc.res.in/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/227/MR60.pdf Proceedings of the Conference on Clifford algebra, its Generalization and Applications], January 30 – February 1, 1971, [[Matscience]], Madras 20, pp.&amp;nbsp;87–96&lt;/ref&gt; by {{math|''n×n''}} matrices in Schwinger's canonical notation as
:&lt;math&gt;
V =
\begin{pmatrix}
0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;\cdots&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;\cdots&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;\cdots&amp;1&amp;0\\
\cdots&amp;\cdots&amp;\cdots&amp;\cdots&amp;\cdots\\
1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;\cdots&amp;0
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; , &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;U =
\begin{pmatrix}
1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;\cdots&amp;0\\
0&amp;\omega&amp;0&amp;\cdots&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;\omega^2&amp;\cdots&amp;0\\
\cdots&amp;\cdots&amp;\cdots&amp;\cdots&amp;\cdots\\
0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;\cdots&amp;\omega^{(n-1)}
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; , &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;
W =
\begin{pmatrix}
1&amp;1&amp;1&amp;\cdots&amp;1\\
1&amp;\omega&amp;\omega^2&amp;\cdots&amp;\omega^{n-1}\\
1&amp;\omega^2&amp;(\omega^2)^2&amp;\cdots&amp;\omega^{2(n-1)}\\
\cdots&amp;\cdots&amp;\cdots&amp;\cdots&amp;\cdots\\
1&amp;\omega^{n-1}&amp;\omega^{2(n-1)}&amp;\cdots&amp;\omega^{(n-1)^2}
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; .

Notably, {{math|''V&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' {{=}} 1}},  {{math|''VU'' {{=}} ''ωUV''}} (the [[Stone–von Neumann theorem#Uniqueness of representation|Weyl braiding relations]]), and {{math| ''W&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;VW'' {{=}} ''U''}} (the [[Discrete Fourier transform]]). 
With {{math|''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''V'' , ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''VU'', and ''e''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''U''}}, one has  three basis elements which, together with {{mvar|ω}}, fulfil the above conditions of the Generalized Clifford Algebra (GCA).

These matrices, {{mvar|V}} and {{mvar|U}}, normally referred to as "[[Generalizations of Pauli matrices#Construction 2|shift and clock matrices]]",  were introduced by  [[James Joseph Sylvester|J. J. Sylvester]] in the 1880s. (Note that the matrices   {{mvar|V}} are cyclic [[permutation matrices]] that perform a [[circular shift]]; ''they are not to be confused'' with [[shift matrix|upper and lower shift matrices]] which have ones only either above or below the diagonal, respectively).

=== Specific examples ===
;Case {{math|''n'' {{=}} ''p'' {{=}} 2}}.
In this case,  we have  {{mvar|ω}} =  −1, and
:&lt;math&gt;
V =
\begin{pmatrix}
0&amp;1\\
1&amp;0
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; , &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;
U =
\begin{pmatrix}
1&amp;0\\
0&amp;-1
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; , &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;
W =
\begin{pmatrix}
1&amp;1\\
1&amp;-1
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
thus
:&lt;math&gt;
e_1 =
\begin{pmatrix}
0&amp;1\\
1&amp;0
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; , &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;
e_2 =
\begin{pmatrix}
0&amp;-1\\
1&amp;0
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; , &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;
e_3 =
\begin{pmatrix}
1&amp;0\\
0&amp;-1
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; ,
which constitute the [[Pauli matrices]].

;Case {{math|''n'' {{=}} ''p'' {{=}} 4}}, 
In this case we have  {{mvar|ω}} = {{mvar|i}},  and
:&lt;math&gt;
V =
\begin{pmatrix}
0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1\\
1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;  , &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;
U =
\begin{pmatrix}
1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\
0&amp;i&amp;0&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;-1&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;-i
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;  , &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;
W =
\begin{pmatrix}
1&amp;1&amp;1&amp;1\\
1&amp;i&amp;-1&amp;-i\\
1&amp;-1&amp;1&amp;-1\\
1&amp;-i&amp;-1&amp;i
\end{pmatrix} 
&lt;/math&gt;
and {{math|''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''e''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} may be determined accordingly.

'''Geometrically and materially nonlinear analysis with imperfections included (GMNIA)''', is a [[structural analysis]] method designed to verify the strength capacity of a structure, which accounts for both plasticity and [[buckling]] failure modes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3212">In [[mathematics]], the '''Hausdorff moment problem''', named after [[Felix Hausdorff]], asks for necessary and sufficient conditions that a given sequence {&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;}
be the sequence of [[moment (mathematics)|moments]]

:&lt;math&gt;m_n  = \int_0^1 x^n\,d\mu(x)&lt;/math&gt;

of some [[Borel measure]] ''&amp;mu;'' [[support (measure theory)|supported]] on the closed unit interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. In the case ''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, this is equivalent to the existence of a [[random variable]] ''X'' supported on [0,&amp;nbsp;1], such that '''E'''&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

The essential difference between this and other well-known moment problems is that this is on a bounded interval, whereas in the [[Stieltjes moment problem]] one considers a half-line [0, ∞), and in the [[Hamburger moment problem]] one considers the whole line (−∞, ∞). The Stieltjes moment problems and the Hamburger moment problems, if they are solvable,  may have infinitely many solutions (indeterminate moment problem) whereas a Hausdorff moment problem always has a unique solution if it is solvable (determinate moment problem). In the indeterminate moment problem case, there are infinite measures corresponding to the same prescribed moments and they consist of a convex set. The set of polynomials may or may not be dense in the associated Hilbert spaces if the moment problem is indeterminate, and it depends on whether measure is extremal or not. But in the determinate moment problem case, the set of  polynomials is dense in the associated Hilbert space.

== Completely monotonic sequences ==
In 1921, Hausdorff showed that {&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;} is such a moment sequence if and only if the sequence is '''completely monotonic''', i.e., its difference sequences satisfy the equation

:&lt;math&gt;(-1)^k(\Delta^k m)_n \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;

for all ''n'',''k'' &amp;ge; 0. Here, &amp;Delta; is the [[difference operator]] given by

:&lt;math&gt;(\Delta m)_n = m_{n+1} - m_n.&lt;/math&gt;

The necessity of this condition is easily seen by the identity
:&lt;math&gt;(-1)^k(\Delta^k m)_n = \int_0^1 x^n (1-x)^k d\mu(x),&lt;/math&gt;
which is ''&amp;ge; 0'', being the integral of an almost sure non-negative function.
For example, it is necessary to have

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta^4 m_6 = m_6 - 4m_7 + 6m_8 - 4m_9 + m_{10} = \int x^6 (1-x)^4 d\mu(x) \geq 0.&lt;/math&gt;

In [[statistics]], the term '''higher-order statistics''' ('''HOS''') refers to functions which use the third or higher power of a [[sample (statistics)|sample]], as opposed to more conventional techniques of lower-order statistics, which use constant, linear, and quadratic terms (zeroth, first, and second powers). The third and higher [[Moment (mathematics)|moment]]s, as used in the [[skewness]] and [[kurtosis]], are examples of HOS, whereas the first and second moments, as used in the [[arithmetic mean]] (first), and [[variance]] (second) are examples of low-order statistics. HOS are particularly used in estimation of [[shape parameter]]s, such as skewness and kurtosis, as when measuring the deviation of a distribution from the [[normal distribution]]. On the other hand, due to the higher powers, HOS are significantly less [[robust statistics|robust]] than lower-order statistics.

In [[statistical theory]], one long-established approach to higher-order statistics, for univariate and multivariate distributions is through the use of [[cumulant]]s and joint cumulants.&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, MG., Stuart, A. (1969) ''The Advanced Theory of Statistics, Volume 1: Distribution Theory, 3rd Edition'', Griffin. {{ISBN|0-85264-141-9}} (Chapter 3)&lt;/ref&gt; In [[time series analysis]], the extension of these is to higher order spectra, for example the [[bispectrum]] and [[trispectrum]].

An alternative to the use of HOS and higher moments is to instead use [[L-moment]]s, which are linear statistics (linear combinations of [[order statistic]]s), and thus more robust than HOS.

'''Hilary Ann Priestley''' is a British [[mathematician]].  She is a professor at the [[University of Oxford]] and a Fellow of [[St Anne's College, Oxford]], where she has been Tutor in Mathematics since 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gardam|first=Tim|title=Titles of Distinction awarded to eight Fellows|url=http://www.st-annes.ox.ac.uk/about/news/item/article/titles-of-distinction-awarded-to-ei|date=11 July 2006|accessdate=2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hilary Priestley introduced ordered separable topological spaces that are important in the study of distributive lattices; such topological spaces are now usually called [[Priestley space]]s in her honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=[[Semigroup Forum]] | date=December 1980 | volume=20 | number=1 | pages=293–297 | title=A partially ordered space which is not a priestley space | first=Albert | last=Stralka | publisher=[[Springer (publisher)|Springer]] | doi=10.1007/BF02572690 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "[[Priestley duality]]" is also used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=[[Order (journal)|Order]] | date=September 1991 | volume=8 | number=3 | pages=299–315 | title=Remarks on Priestley duality for distributive lattices | first1=R. | last1=Cignoli | first2=S. | last2=Lafalce | first3=A. | last3=Petrovich | publisher=[[Springer (publisher)|Springer]] | doi=10.1007/BF00383451 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Priestly has contributed to the [[Distributive lattice#representation theory|representation theory of distributive lattices]].{{fact|date=February 2018}}

Following Priestley's academic advisors back by 15 generations on the [[Mathematics Genealogy Project]] database, one arrives at [[Isaac Newton]].&lt;ref name="mgp" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4621">In finance, '''Jensen's alpha'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=244153 Jensen, M.C., "The Performance of Mutual Funds in the Period 1945-1964," Journal of Finance 23, 1968, pp. 389-416.]&lt;/ref&gt; (or '''Jensen's Performance Index''', '''ex-post alpha''') is used to determine the abnormal return of a security or [[Portfolio (finance)|portfolio]] of securities over the theoretical expected return. It is a version of the [[alpha (finance)|standard alpha]] based on a theoretical performance index instead of a [[market index]].

The security could be any asset, such as stocks, bonds, or derivatives. The theoretical return is predicted by a market model, most commonly the [[capital asset pricing model]] (CAPM). The market model uses statistical methods to predict the appropriate risk-adjusted return of an asset. The CAPM for instance uses [[Beta coefficient|beta]] as a multiplier.

==History==
Jensen's alpha was first used as a measure in the evaluation of [[mutual fund]] managers by [[Michael C. Jensen|Michael Jensen]] in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[http://riskencyclopedia.com/articles/alpha/ "Alpha", Risk Encyclopedia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004231843/http://riskencyclopedia.com/articles/alpha/ |date=2013-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The CAPM return is supposed to be 'risk adjusted', which means it takes account of the relative riskiness of the asset.

This is based on the concept that riskier assets should have higher expected returns than less risky assets.  If an asset's return is even higher than the risk adjusted return, that asset is said to have "positive alpha" or "abnormal returns". Investors are constantly seeking investments that have higher alpha.

Since [[Eugene Fama]], many academics believe financial markets are too [[Efficient-market hypothesis|efficient]] to allow for repeatedly earning positive Alpha, unless by chance.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=November 2018}} Nevertheless, Alpha is still widely used to evaluate mutual fund and portfolio manager performance, often in conjunction with the [[Sharpe ratio]] and the [[Treynor ratio]].

==Calculation==
In the context of CAPM, calculating alpha requires the following inputs:
* &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;: the [[market portfolio|realized return]] (on the portfolio),
* &lt;math&gt;R_M&lt;/math&gt;: the [[market portfolio|market return]],
* &lt;math&gt;R_f&lt;/math&gt;: the [[risk-free rate]] of return, and
* &lt;math&gt;\beta_{iM}&lt;/math&gt;: the [[Beta coefficient|beta]] of the portfolio.

'''''Jensen's  alpha = Portfolio Return &amp;minus; [Risk Free Rate + Portfolio Beta * (Market Return &amp;minus; Risk Free Rate)]'''''

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_J = R_i - [R_f + \beta_{iM} \cdot (R_M - R_f)]&lt;/math&gt;

An additional way of understanding the definition can be obtained by rewriting it as:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_J = (R_i - R_f) - \beta_{iM} \cdot (R_M - R_f)&lt;/math&gt;

If we define the excess return of the fund (market) over the risk free return as &lt;math&gt;\Delta_R \equiv (R_i - R_f) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \Delta_M \equiv (R_M - R_f)&lt;/math&gt; then Jensen's alpha can be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_J = \Delta_R - \beta_{iM} \Delta_M &lt;/math&gt;

==Use in quantitative finance==

Jensen's alpha is a statistic that is commonly used in empirical finance to assess the marginal return associated with unit exposure to a given strategy. Generalizing the above definition to the multifactor setting, Jensen's alpha is a measure of the marginal return associated with an additional strategy that is not explained by existing factors.

We obtain the CAPM alpha if we consider excess market returns as the only factor. If we add in the Fama-French factors, we obtain the 3-factor alpha, and so on{{what|date=August 2018}}. If Jensen's alpha is significant and positive, then the strategy being considered has a history of generating returns on top of what would be expected based on other factors alone. For example, in the 3-factor case, we may regress momentum factor returns on 3-factor returns to find that momentum generates a significant premium on top of size, value, and market returns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://formula-alpha.com/blog/jensens-alpha/ Jensen's Alpha in Quantitative Finance]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quantiphile.com/2011/02/15/jensens-alpha-revisited/ Addendum, Jensen's Alpha in Quantitative Finance]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], the '''Littelmann path model''' is a [[combinatorics|combinatorial device]] due to [[Peter Littelmann]] for computing multiplicities ''without overcounting'' in the [[representation theory]] of symmetrisable [[Kac–Moody algebra]]s. Its most important application is to complex [[semisimple Lie algebra]]s or equivalently compact [[semisimple Lie group]]s, the case described in this article. Multiplicities in [[Weyl character formula|irreducible representations]], tensor products and [[branching rule]]s can be calculated using a [[graph theory|coloured directed graph]], with labels given by the [[root system|simple roots]] of the Lie algebra.

Developed as a bridge between the theory of [[crystal basis|crystal bases]] arising from the work of [[Masaki Kashiwara|Kashiwara]] and [[George Lusztig|Lusztig]] on [[quantum group]]s and the [[standard monomial theory]] of [[C. S. Seshadri]] and Lakshmibai, Littelmann's path model associates to each irreducible representation a rational vector space with basis given by paths from the origin to a [[root lattice|weight]] as well as a pair of '''root operators''' acting on paths for each [[root lattice|simple root]]. This gives a direct way of recovering the algebraic and combinatorial structures previously discovered by Kashiwara and Lusztig using quantum groups.

==Background and motivation==
Some of the basic questions in the representation theory of complex semisimple Lie algebras or compact semisimple Lie groups going back to [[Hermann Weyl]] include:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weyl|1946}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Humphreys|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* For a given [[dominant weight]] '''λ''', find the weight multiplicities in the [[Weyl character formula|irreducible representation]] ''L''(λ) with highest weight λ.
* For two highest weights λ, μ, find the decomposition of their tensor product ''L''(λ) &lt;math&gt;\otimes &lt;/math&gt; ''L''(μ) into irreducible representations.
* Suppose that &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}_1&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Levi decomposition|Levi component]] of a [[parabolic subalgebra]] of a semisimple Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;. For a given dominant highest weight '''λ''', determine the [[branching rule]] for decomposing the restriction of ''L''('''λ''') to &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}_1&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Every complex semisimple Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[complexification]] of the Lie algebra of a compact connected simply connected semisimple Lie group. The subalgebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}_1&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to a maximal rank closed subgroup, i.e. one containing a maximal torus.&lt;/ref&gt;

(Note that the first problem, of weight multiplicities, is the special case of the third in which the parabolic subalgebra is a Borel subalgebra. Moreover, the Levi branching problem can be embedded in the tensor product problem as a certain limiting case.)

Answers to these questions were first provided by Hermann Weyl and [[Richard Brauer]] as consequences of [[Weyl character formula|explicit character formulas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weyl|1946|p=230,312}}. The "Brauer-Weyl rules" for restriction to maximal rank subgroups and for tensor products were developed independently by Brauer (in his thesis on the representations of the orthogonal groups) and by Weyl (in his papers on representations of compact semisimple Lie groups).&lt;/ref&gt; followed by later combinatorial formulas of [[Hans Freudenthal]], [[Robert Steinberg]] and [[Bertram Kostant]]; see {{harvtxt|Humphreys|1994}}. An unsatisfactory feature of these formulas is that they involved alternating sums for quantities that were known a priori to be non-negative. Littelmann's method expresses these multiplicities as sums of non-negative integers ''without overcounting''. His work generalizes classical results based on [[Young tableau]]x for the [[general linear group|general linear Lie algebra]] &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{gl}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; or the [[special linear group|special linear Lie algebra]] &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{sl}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Littlewood|1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Macdonald|1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sundaram|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|King|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Issai Schur]]'s result in his 1901 dissertation that the weight multiplicities could be counted in terms of column-strict Young tableaux (i.e. weakly increasing to the right along rows, and strictly increasing down columns).
* The celebrated [[Littlewood–Richardson rule]] that describes both tensor product decompositions and branching from  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{gl}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''m''+''n''&lt;/sub&gt; to  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{gl}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{gl}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; in terms of lattice permutations of skew tableaux.

Attempts at finding similar algorithms without overcounting for the other classical Lie algebras had only been partially successful.&lt;ref&gt;Numerous authors have made contributions, including the physicist R. C. King, and the mathematicians S. Sundaram, [[I. M. Gelfand]], [[A. Zelevinsky]] and A. Berenstein. The surveys of {{harvtxt|King|1990}} and {{harvtxt|Sundaram|1990}} give variants of [[Young tableaux]] which can be used to compute weight multiplicities, branching rules and tensor products with fundamental representations for the remaining classical Lie algebras. {{harvtxt|Berenstein|Zelevinsky|2001}} discuss how their method using [[convex polytope]]s, proposed in 1988, is related to Littelmann paths and crystal bases.&lt;/ref&gt;

Littelmann's contribution was to give a unified combinatorial model that applied to all symmetrizable [[Kac–Moody algebra]]s and provided explicit subtraction-free combinatorial formulas for weight multiplicities, tensor product rules and [[branching rule]]s. He accomplished this by introducing the vector space ''V'' over '''Q''' generated by the [[weight lattice]] of a [[Cartan subalgebra]]; on the vector space of piecewise-linear paths in ''V'' connecting the origin to a weight, he defined a pair of ''root operators'' for each [[root lattice|simple root]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;.
The combinatorial data could be encoded in a coloured directed graph, with labels given by the simple roots.

Littelmann's main motivation&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Littelmann|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; was to reconcile two different aspects of representation theory:

* The standard monomial theory of Lakshmibai and Seshadri arising from the geometry of [[Schubert variety|Schubert varieties]].
*[[crystal basis|Crystal bases]] arising in the approach to [[quantum group]]s of  [[Masaki Kashiwara]] and [[George Lusztig]]. Kashiwara and Lusztig constructed canonical bases for representations of deformations of the [[universal enveloping algebra]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; depending on a formal deformation parameter ''q''. In the degenerate case when ''q'' = 0, these yield [[crystal basis|crystal bases]] together with pairs of operators corresponding to simple roots; see {{harvtxt|Ariki|2002}}.

Although differently defined, the crystal basis, its root operators and crystal graph were later shown to be equivalent to Littelmann's path model and graph; see {{harvtxt|Hong|Kang|2002|p=xv}}. In the case of complex semisimple Lie algebras, there is a simplified self-contained account in {{harvtxt|Littelmann|1997}} relying only on the properties of [[root system]]s; this approach is followed here.

==Definitions==
Let ''P'' be the [[weight lattice]] in the dual of a [[Cartan subalgebra]] of the [[semisimple Lie algebra]] &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;.

A '''Littelmann path''' is a piecewise-linear mapping

:&lt;math&gt;\pi:[0,1]\cap \mathbf{Q} \rightarrow  P\otimes_{\mathbf{Z}}\mathbf{Q}&lt;/math&gt;

such that π(0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and π(1) is a [[weight lattice|weight]].

Let (''H''&lt;sub&gt; α&lt;/sub&gt;) be the basis of  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt; consisting of "coroot" vectors, dual to basis of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt;* formed by [[root system|simple roots]] (α). For fixed α and a path  π, the function &lt;math&gt;h(t)= (\pi(t), H_\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; has a minimum value ''M''.

Define non-decreasing self-mappings ''l'' and ''r'' of [0,1] &lt;math&gt;\cap&lt;/math&gt; '''Q''' by

:&lt;math&gt; l(t) = \min_{t\le s\le 1} (1,h(s)-M),\,\,\,\,\,\, r(t) = 1 - \min_{0\le s\le t} (1,h(s)-M).&lt;/math&gt;

Thus ''l''(''t'') = 0 until the last time that ''h''(''s'') = ''M'' and ''r''(''t'') = 1 after the first time that ''h''(''s'') = ''M''.

Define new paths π&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; and  π&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; by

:&lt;math&gt;\pi_r(t)= \pi(t) + r(t) \alpha,\,\,\,\,\,\, \pi_l(t) = \pi(t) - l(t)\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

The '''root operators''' ''e''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; are defined on a basis vector [π] by

* &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{ e_\alpha [\pi] = [\pi_r]} &lt;/math&gt; if ''r'' (0) = 0 and 0 otherwise;
* &lt;math&gt; \displaystyle{f_\alpha [\pi] = [\pi_l]} &lt;/math&gt; if ''l'' (1) = 1 and 0 otherwise.

The key feature here is that the paths form a basis for the root operators like that of a [[monomial representation]]: when a root operator is applied to the basis element for a path, the result is either 0 or the basis element for another path.

==Properties==
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; be the algebra generated by the root operators. Let π(''t'') be a path lying wholly within the positive [[Weyl chamber]] defined by the simple roots. Using results on the path model of [[C. S. Seshadri]] and Lakshmibai, Littelmann showed that

*the &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;-module generated by [π] depends only on π(1) = λ and has a '''Q'''-basis consisting of paths [σ];
*the multiplicity of the weight μ in the integrable highest weight representation ''L''(λ) is the number of paths σ with σ(1) = μ.

There is also an action of the [[Weyl group]] on paths [π]. If α is a simple root and ''k'' = ''h''(1), with ''h'' as above, then the corresponding reflection ''s''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; acts as follows:

* ''s''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; [π] = [π] if ''k'' = 0;
* ''s''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; [π]= ''f''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; [π] if ''k'' &gt; 0;
* ''s''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; [π]= ''e''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt; – ''k''&lt;/sup&gt; [π] if ''k'' &lt; 0.

If π is a path lying wholly inside the positive Weyl chamber, the '''Littelmann graph''' &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}_\pi&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be the coloured, directed graph having as vertices the non-zero paths obtained by successively applying the operators ''f''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; to π. There is a directed arrow from one path to another labelled by the simple root α, if the target path is obtained from the source path by applying ''f''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;.

* The Littelmann graphs of two paths are isomorphic as coloured, directed graphs if and only if the paths have the same end point.

The Littelmann graph therefore only depends on λ.  Kashiwara and Joseph proved that it coincides with the "crystal graph" defined by Kashiwara in the theory of crystal bases.

==Applications==

===Character formula===

If π(1) = λ, the multiplicity of the weight μ in ''L''(λ) is the number of  vertices σ in the Littelmann graph &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{G}_\pi &lt;/math&gt; with σ(1) = μ.

===Generalized Littlewood–Richardson rule===

Let π and σ be paths in the positive Weyl chamber with π(1) = λ and σ(1) = μ. Then

:&lt;math&gt; L(\lambda) \otimes L(\mu) = \bigoplus_\eta L(\lambda + \tau(1)),&lt;/math&gt;

where τ ranges over paths in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}_\sigma&lt;/math&gt; such that π &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; τ lies entirely in the positive Weyl chamber and
the ''concatenation'' π &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; τ (t) is defined as π(2''t'') for ''t'' ≤ 1/2 and π(1) + τ( 2''t'' – 1) for ''t'' ≥ 1/2.

===Branching rule===

If &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}_1&lt;/math&gt; is the Levi component of a parabolic subalgebra of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; with weight lattice ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\supset &lt;/math&gt; ''P'' then

:&lt;math&gt; L(\lambda)|_{\mathfrak{g}_1} = \bigoplus_{\sigma} L_{\mathfrak{g}_1}(\sigma(1)),&lt;/math&gt;

where the sum ranges over all paths σ in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}_\pi&lt;/math&gt; which lie wholly in the positive Weyl chamber for &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}_1&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24768">'''Neo-Riemannian theory''' is a loose collection of ideas present in the writings of [[music theory|music theorists]] such as [[David Lewin]], Brian Hyer, [[Richard Cohn]], and [[Henry Klumpenhouwer]]. What binds these ideas is a central commitment to relating [[harmony|harmonies]] directly to each other, without necessary reference to a [[tonic (music)|tonic]]. Initially, those harmonies were [[major chord|major]] and [[minor chord|minor triads]]; subsequently, neo-Riemannian theory was extended to standard [[consonance and dissonance|dissonant]] sonorities as well. Harmonic proximity is characteristically gauged by efficiency of [[voice leading]]. Thus, C major and E minor triads are close by virtue of requiring only a single [[semitone|semitonal]] shift to move from one to the other. Motion between proximate harmonies is described by simple transformations. For example, motion between a C major and E minor triad, in either direction, is executed by an "L" transformation. Extended progressions of harmonies are characteristically displayed on a geometric plane, or map, which portrays the entire system of harmonic relations. Where consensus is lacking is on the question of what is most central to the theory: smooth voice leading, transformations, or the system of relations that is mapped by the geometries. The theory is often invoked when analyzing harmonic practices within the [[Romantic music#Late Romantic Era .281850-1910.29|Late Romantic]] period characterized by a high degree of [[chromaticism]], including work of [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]], [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] and [[Anton Bruckner|Bruckner]].&lt;ref name="Cohn Intro"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cohn |first=Richard |author-link=Richard Cohn |date=Autumn 1998 |title=An Introduction to Neo-Riemannian Theory: A Survey and Historical Perspective |journal=[[Journal of Music Theory]] |publisher=[[Duke University Press]] |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=167–180 |jstor=843871}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Minor as upside down major.png|thumb|right|350px|Illustration of Riemann's 'dualist' system: minor as upside down major.]]

Neo-Riemannian theory is named after [[Hugo Riemann]] (1849–1919), whose "dualist" system for relating triads was adapted from earlier 19th-century harmonic theorists. (The term "[[harmonic dualism|dualism]]" refers to the emphasis on the inversional relationship between major and minor, with minor triads being considered "upside down" versions of major triads; this "dualism" is what produces the change-in-direction described above. See also: [[Utonality]]) In the 1880s, Riemann proposed a system of transformations that related triads directly to each other &lt;ref name="Klumpenhouwer"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Klumpenhouwer |first=Henry |date=1994 |title=Some Remarks on the Use of Riemann Transformations |url=http://www.mtosmt.org/issues/mto.94.0.9/mto.94.0.9.klumpenhouwer.art |journal=[[Music Theory Online]] |volume=0 |issue=9 |issn=1067-3040}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revival of this aspect of Riemann's writings, independently of the dualist premises under which they were initially conceived, originated with [[David Lewin]] (1933–2003), particularly in his article "Amfortas's Prayer to Titurel and the Role of D in Parsifal" (1984) and his influential book, ''Generalized Musical Intervals and Transformations'' (1987). Subsequent development in the 1990s and 2000s has expanded the scope of neo-Riemannian theory considerably, with further mathematical systematization to its basic tenets, as well as inroads into 20th century repertoires and music psychology.&lt;ref name="Cohn Intro" /&gt;

==Triadic transformations and voice leading==

The principal transformations of neo-Riemannian triadic theory connect triads of different species (major and minor), and are their own [[inversion (music)|inverses]] (a second application undoes the first). These transformations are purely harmonic, and do not need any particular voice leading between chords: all instances of motion from a C major to a C minor triad represent the same neo-Riemannian transformation, no matter how the voices are distributed in register.

The three transformations move one of the three notes of the triad to produce a different triad:
*The '''P''' transformation exchanges a triad for its [[Parallel key|Parallel]]. In a Major Triad move the third down a semitone (C major to C minor), in a Minor Triad move the third up a semitone (C minor to C major)
*The '''R''' transformation exchanges a triad for its [[Relative key|Relative]]. In a Major Triad move the fifth up a tone (C major to A minor), in a Minor Triad move the root down a tone (A minor to C major)
*The '''L''' transformation exchanges a triad for its Leading-Tone Exchange. In a Major Triad the root moves down by a semitone (C major to E minor), in a Minor Triad the fifth moves up by a semitone (E minor to C major)

Observe that '''P''' preserves the ''perfect fifth'' interval (so given say C and G there are only two candidates for the third note: E and E{{flat}}), '''L''' preserves the ''minor third'' interval (given E and G our candidates are C and B) and '''R''' preserves the ''major third'' interval (given C and E our candidates are G and A).

Secondary operations can be constructed by combining these basic operations:

Any combination of the L, P, and R transformations will act inversely on major and minor triads: for instance, R-then-P transposes C major down a minor third, to A major via A minor, whilst transposing C minor to E{{flat}} minor up a minor 3rd via E{{flat}} major.

Initial work in neo-Riemannian theory treated these transformations in a largely harmonic manner, without explicit attention to voice leading. Later, Cohn pointed out that neo-Riemannian concepts arise naturally when thinking about certain problems in voice leading.&lt;ref name="Cohn Maximal Smooth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tymoczko VL"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Tymoczko |first=Dmitri |author-link=Dmitri Tymoczko |date=27 November 2008 |title=Scale Theory, Serial Theory, and Voice Leading |url=https://dmitri.mycpanel.princeton.edu/files/publications/scalesarrays.pdf |journal=[[Music Analysis (journal)|Music Analysis]] |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=1–49 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2249.2008.00257.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, two triads (major or minor) share two common tones and can be connected by stepwise voice leading the third voice if and only if they are linked by one of the L, P, R transformations described above.&lt;ref name="Cohn Maximal Smooth" /&gt; (This property of stepwise voice leading in a single voice is called [[voice-leading]] [[Occam's razor|parsimony]].) Note that here the emphasis on inversional relationships arises naturally, as a byproduct of interest in "parsimonious" voice leading, rather than being a fundamental theoretical postulate, as it was in Riemann's work.

More recently, [[Dmitri Tymoczko]] has argued that the connection between neo-Riemannian operations and voice leading is only approximate (see below).&lt;ref name="Tymoczko Distance"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Mathematics and Computation in Music |last=Tymoczko |first=Dmitri |date=2009 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-642-02394-1 |editor-last=Chew |editor-first=Elaine |series=Communications in Computer and Information Science |volume=38 |location=Heidelberg |pages=258–273 |chapter=Three Conceptions of Musical Distance |author-link=Dmitri Tymoczko |editor-last2=Childs |editor-first2=Adrian |editor-last3=Chuan |editor-first3=Ching-Hua |chapter-url=http://dmitri.mycpanel.princeton.edu/files/publications/distance.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the formalism of neo-Riemannian theory treats voice leading in a somewhat oblique manner: "neo-Riemannian transformations," as defined above, are purely harmonic relationships that do not necessarily involve any particular mapping between the chords' notes.&lt;ref name="Tymoczko VL" /&gt;

== Graphical representations ==
[[File:Neo-Riemannian Tonnetz.svg|thumb|500px|Pitches in the Tonnetz are connected by lines if they are separated by minor third, major third, or perfect fifth. Interpreted as a torus the Tonnetz has 12 nodes (pitches) and 24 triangles (triads).]]

Neo-Riemannian transformations can be modeled with several interrelated geometric structures. The Riemannian [[Tonnetz]] ("tonal grid," shown on the right) is a planar array of pitches along three simplicial axes, corresponding to the three consonant intervals. Major and minor triads are represented by triangles which tile the plane of the Tonnetz. Edge-adjacent triads share two common pitches, and so the principal transformations are expressed as minimal motion of the Tonnetz. Unlike the historical theorist for which it is named, neo-Riemannian theory typically assumes enharmonic equivalence (G{{sharp}} = A{{flat}}), which wraps the planar graph into a [[torus]].

[[File:TonnetzTorus.gif|thumb|One toroidal view of the neo-Riemannian Tonnetz.]]

Alternate tonal geometries have been described in neo-Riemannian theory that isolate or expand upon certain features of the classical Tonnetz. [[Richard Cohn]] developed the Hyper [[hexatonic scale|Hexatonic]] system to describe motion within and between separate major third cycles, all of which exhibit what he formulates as "maximal smoothness." (Cohn, 1996).&lt;ref name="Cohn Maximal Smooth"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cohn |first=Richard |author-link=Richard Cohn |date=March 1996 |title=Maximally Smooth Cycles, Hexatonic Systems, and the Analysis of Late-Romantic Triadic Progressions |journal=[[Music Analysis (journal)|Music Analysis]] |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=9–40 |jstor=854168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another geometric figure, Cube Dance, was invented by Jack Douthett; it features the geometric dual of the Tonnetz, where triads are vertices instead of triangles (Douthett and Steinbach, 1998) and are interspersed with augmented triads, allowing smoother voice-leadings.

Many of the geometrical representations associated with neo-Riemannian theory are unified into a more general framework by the continuous voice-leading spaces explored by Clifton Callender, Ian Quinn, and Dmitri Tymoczko. This work originates in 2004, when Callender described a continuous space in which points represented three-note "chord types" (such as "major triad"), using the space to model "continuous transformations" in which voices slid continuously from one note to another.&lt;ref name="Callender MTO"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Callender |first=Clifton |date=2004 |title=Continuous Transformations |journal=Music Theory Online |volume=10 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Tymoczko showed that paths in Callender's space were isomorphic to certain classes of voice leadings (the "individually T related" voice leadings discussed in Tymoczko 2008) and developed a family of spaces more closely analogous to those of neo-Riemannian theory. In Tymoczko's spaces, points represent particular chords of any size (such as "C major") rather than more general chord types (such as "major triad").&lt;ref name="Tymoczko VL" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tymoczko Geometry"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Tymoczko |first=Dmitri |author-link=Dmitri Tymoczko |date=2006 |title=The Geometry of Musical Chords |url=http://dmitri.mycpanel.princeton.edu/voiceleading.pdf |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=313 |pages=72–74 |pmid=16825563 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307073427/http://dmitri.mycpanel.princeton.edu/voiceleading.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Callender, Quinn, and Tymoczko together proposed a unified framework connecting these and many other geometrical spaces representing diverse range of music-theoretical properties.&lt;ref name="CQT"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Callender |first=Clifton |last2=Quinn |first2=Ian |last3=Tymoczko |first3=Dmitri |author-link3=Dmitri Tymoczko |title=Generalized Voice Leading Spaces |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=320 |pages=346–348|doi=10.1126/science.1153021|date=18 Apr 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

Neo-Riemannian theorists often analyze chord progressions as combinations of the three basic LPR transformations, the only ones that preserve two common tones. 
Thus the progression from C major to E major might be analyzed as L-then-P, which is a 2-unit motion since it involves two transformations. (This same transformation sends C minor to A{{flat}} minor, since L of C minor is A{{flat}} major, while P of A{{flat}} major is A{{flat}} minor.) These distances reflect voice-leading only imperfectly.&lt;ref name="Tymoczko Distance" /&gt; For example, according to strains of neo-Riemannian theory that prioritize common-tone preservation, the C major triad is closer to F major than to F minor, since C major can be transformed into F major by R-then-L, while it takes three moves to get from C major to F minor (R-then-L-then-P). However, from a chromatic voice-leading perspective F minor is closer to C major than F major is, since it takes just two semitones of motion to transform F minor into C major (A{{flat}}-&gt;G and F-&gt;E) whereas it takes three semitones to transform F major into C major. Thus LPR transformations are unable to account for the voice-leading efficiency of the IV-iv-I progression, one of the basic routines of nineteenth-century harmony.&lt;ref name="Tymoczko Distance" /&gt; Note that similar points can be made about common tones: on the Tonnetz, F minor and E{{flat}} minor are both three steps from C major, even though F minor and C major have one common tone, while E{{flat}} minor and C major have none.

Underlying these discrepancies are different ideas about whether harmonic proximity is maximized when two common tones are shared, or when the total voice-leading distance is minimized. For example, in the R transformation, a single voice moves by whole step; in the N or S transformation, two voices move by semitone. When common-tone maximization is prioritized, R is more efficient; when voice-leading efficiency is measured by summing the motions of the individual voices, the transformations are equivalently efficient. Early neo-Riemannian theory conflated these two conceptions. More recent work has disentangled them, and measures distance unilaterally by voice-leading proximity independently of common-tone preservation. Accordingly, the distinction between "primary" and "secondary" transformations becomes problematized. As early as 1992, Jack Douthett created an exact geometric model of inter-triadic voice-leading by interpolating augmented triads between R-related triads, which he called "Cube Dance".&lt;ref name="Douthett"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Douthett |first=Jack |last2=Steinbach |first2=Peter |date=1998 |title=Parsimonious Graphs: A Study in Parsimony, Contextual Transformation, and Modes of Limited Transposition |url=https://edisciplinas.usp.br/mod/resource/view.php?id=2314278 |journal=[[Journal of Music Theory]] |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=241–263 |doi=10.2307/843877 |jstor=843877}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Douthett's figure was published in 1998, its superiority as a model of voice leading was not fully appreciated until much later, in the wake of the geometrical work of Callender, Quinn, and Tymoczko; indeed, the first detailed comparison of "Cube Dance" to the neo-Riemannian "Tonnetz" appeared in 2009, more than fifteen years after Douthett's initial discovery of his figure.&lt;ref name="Tymoczko Distance" /&gt; In this line of research, the triadic transformations lose the foundational status that they held in the early phases of neo-Riemannian theory. The geometries to which voice-leading proximity give rise attain central status, and the transformations become heuristic labels for certain kinds of standard routines, rather than their defining property.

Nonetheless, among all possible sets of the twenty-four Riemannian triadic transformations, the length of combinations of members from the set of L, P, and R transformations better correlates with chromatic voice-leading distance than nearly every other set of transformations. For example, if only L and R transformations were used to measure transformational distance between triads, the number of contradictions between transformational distance and voice-leading distance like those examples above is much greater than when using L, P, and R. This partially restores some distinction between "primary" and "secondary" transformations.&lt;ref name="MurphyReview"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Murphy |first=S. |date=1 April 2014 |title=Audacious Euphony: Chromaticism and the Triad's Second Nature |journal=[[Journal of Music Theory]] |language=en |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=79–101 |doi=10.1215/00222909-2413598 |issn=0022-2909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extensions ==

Beyond its application to triadic chord progressions, neo-Riemannian theory has inspired numerous subsequent investigations. These include

*Voice-leading proximity among chords with more than three tones- among species of [[hexachord]]s, such as the [[Mystic chord]] (Callender, 1998)&lt;ref name="Callender"&gt;Callender, Clifton, "Voice-Leading Parsimony in the Music of Alexander Scriabin", ''Journal of Music Theory'' 42/2 (1998), 219–233&lt;/ref&gt;

*Progressions among triads within diatonic rather than chromatic space.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}
*Transformations among scales of various sizes and species (in the work of [[Dmitri Tymoczko]]).&lt;ref name="Tymoczko Scales"&gt;Tymoczko, Dmitri. "Scale Networks and Debussy," ''Journal of Music Theory'' 48/2 (2004): : 215–92.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Transformations among all possible triads, not necessarily strict mode-shifting [[Involution (mathematics)|involutions]] ([[Julian Hook|Hook]], 2002).&lt;ref name="Hook 1"&gt;Hook, Julian, "Uniform Triadic Transformations", ''Journal of Music Theory'' 46/1–2 (2002), 57–126&lt;/ref&gt;
*Transformations between chords of differing cardinality, called ''cross-type transformations'' (Hook, 2007).&lt;ref name="Hook 2"&gt;Hook, Julian, "Cross-Type Transformations and the Path Consistency Condition", ''Music Theory Spectrum'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Applicability to [[popular music|pop music]].&lt;ref name="Capuzzo"&gt;Capuzzo, Guy, "Neo-Riemannian Theory and the Analysis of Pop-Rock Music", ''Music Theory Spectrum'' 26/2 2004), Pages 177–200&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these extensions share neo-Riemannian theory's concern with non-traditional relations among familiar tonal chords; others apply voice-leading proximity or harmonic transformation to characteristically atonal chords.

*''X'' is [[unicoherent]], meaning that if ''X'' is the union of two closed connected subsets, then their intersection is connected or empty.

The theorem remains true with the weaker condition that ''A'' and ''B'' be separated.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1926">In [[mathematics]], the '''Poincaré separation theorem''' gives the upper and lower bounds of [[eigenvalue]]s of a real [[symmetric matrix]] ''B&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;AB'' that can be considered as the [[orthogonal projection]] of a larger real symmetric matrix ''A'' onto a linear subspace spanned by the columns of&amp;nbsp;''B''.  The theorem is named after [[Henri Poincaré]].

More specifically, let ''A'' be an ''n''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''n'' real symmetric matrix and ''B'' an ''n''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''r'' [[semi-orthogonal matrix]] such that ''B&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;B'' = ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Proof ==

An algebraic proof, based on the [[Min-max theorem|variational interpretation of eigenvalues]], has been published in Magnus' ''Matrix Differential Calculus with Applications in Statistics and Econometrics''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Matrix Differential Calculus with Applications in Statistics and Econometrics

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3423">In [[mathematics]], '''poly-Bernoulli numbers''', denoted as &lt;math&gt;B_{n}^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt;, were defined by M. Kaneko as

:&lt;math&gt;{Li_{k}(1-e^{-x}) \over 1-e^{-x}}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}B_{n}^{(k)}{x^{n}\over n!}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Li'' is the [[polylogarithm]]. The &lt;math&gt;B_{n}^{(1)}&lt;/math&gt; are the usual [[Bernoulli number]]s.

Moreover, the '''Generalization of Poly-Bernoulli numbers''' with a,b,c parameters defined as follows
:&lt;math&gt;{Li_{k}(1-(ab)^{-x})\over b^x-a^{-x}}c^{xt}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}B_{n}^{(k)}(t;a,b,c){x^{n}\over n!}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Li'' is the [[polylogarithm]]. 

Kaneko also gave two combinatorial formulas:

:&lt;math&gt;B_{n}^{(-k)}=\sum_{m=0}^{n}(-1)^{m+n}m!S(n,m)(m+1)^{k},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;B_{n}^{(-k)}=\sum_{j=0}^{\min(n,k)} (j!)^{2}S(n+1,j+1)S(k+1,j+1),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;S(n,k)&lt;/math&gt; is the number of ways to partition a size &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; set into &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; non-empty subsets (the [[Stirling number of the second kind]]).

A combinatorial interpretation is that the poly-Bernoulli numbers of negative index enumerate the set of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; [[binary matrix|(0,1)-matrices]] uniquely reconstructible from their row and column sums.

For a positive integer ''n'' and a prime number ''p'', the poly-Bernoulli numbers satisfy

:&lt;math&gt;B_n^{(-p)} \equiv 2^n \pmod p,&lt;/math&gt;

which can be seen as an analog of [[Fermat's little theorem]]. Further, the equation

:&lt;math&gt;B_x^{(-n)} + B_y^{(-n)} = B_z^{(-n)}&lt;/math&gt;

has no solution for integers ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', ''n'' &gt; 2; an analog of [[Fermat's last theorem]].
Moreover, there is an analogue of Poly-Bernoulli numbers (like Bernoulli numbers and Euler numbers) which is known as [[Poly-Euler numbers]]

[[Polynomial matrix|Polynomial matrices]] are widely studied in the fields of [[systems theory]] and [[control theory]] and have seen other uses relating to [[stable polynomial]]s. In stability theory, Spectral Factorization has been used to find determinental matrix representations for bivariate stable polynomials and real zero polynomials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anatolii Grinshpan, Dmitry S. Kaliuzhnyi-Verbovetskyir, Victor Vinnikov, Hugo J. Woerdeman|first=|date=|title=Stable and real-zero polynomials in two variables|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11045-014-0286-3|journal=Multidimensional Systems and Signal Processing|volume=27|pages=1–26|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key tool used to study these is a matrix factorization known as either the Polynomial Matrix Spectral Factorization or the Matrix Fejer–Riesz Theorem.

Given a univariate [[Positive polynomial|positive polynomial &lt;math&gt;p(t)&lt;/math&gt;]], a polynomial which takes on non-negative values for any real input [[Positive polynomial|&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;]], the Fejer–Riesz Theorem yields the polynomial spectral factorization [[Positive polynomial|&lt;math&gt;p(t) = q(t) q(\bar{t})^*&lt;/math&gt;]]. Results of this form are generically referred to as [[Positivstellensatz]]. Considering positive definiteness as the matrix analogue of positivity, Polynomial Matrix Spectral Factorization provides a similar factorization for polynomial matrices which have positive definite range. This decomposition also relates to the [[Cholesky decomposition]] for scalar matrices &lt;math&gt;A =LL^* &lt;/math&gt;. This result was originally proven by Wiener&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=N. Wiener and P. Masani|first=|date=|title=The prediction theory of multivariate stochastic processe|url=|journal=Acta Math.|volume=98|pages=111–150|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a more general context which was concerned with integrable matrix-valued functions that also had integrable log determinant. Because applications are often concerned with the polynomial restriction, simpler proofs and individual analysis exist focusing on this case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tim N.T. Goodman Charles A.

== Statement ==
Let &lt;math&gt;P(t) = \begin{bmatrix}p_{11}(t) &amp;\ldots &amp;p_{1n}(t) \\ \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots\\ p_{n1}(t) &amp; \cdots&amp; p_{nn}(t)\\  \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;be a polynomial matrix where each entry &lt;math&gt;p_{ij}(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a complex coefficient polynomial of degree at most &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose that for almost all &lt;math&gt;t \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;P(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a positive definite hermitian matrix. Then there exists a polynomial matrix &lt;math&gt;Q(t)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;P(t) = Q(t) Q(t)^*&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;t \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. We can furthermore find &lt;math&gt;Q(t)&lt;/math&gt; which is nonsingular on the lower half plane.

=== Extension to complex inputs ===
Note that if &lt;math&gt;Q(t) = \begin{bmatrix}q_{11}(t) &amp;\ldots &amp;q_{1n}(t) \\ \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots\\ q_{n1}(t) &amp; \cdots&amp; q_{nn}(t)\\  \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;then &lt;math&gt;Q(\bar{t})^* = \begin{bmatrix}q_{11}(\bar{t})^* &amp;\ldots &amp;q_{n1}(\bar{t})^* \\ \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots\\ q_{1n}(\bar{t})^* &amp; \cdots&amp; q_{nn}(\bar{t})^*\\  \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;. When &lt;math&gt;q_{ij}(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a complex coefficient polynomial or complex coefficient rational function we have &lt;math&gt;q_{ij}(\bar{t})^*&lt;/math&gt;is also a polynomial or rational function respectively. For &lt;math&gt;t \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; we have&lt;math display="block"&gt;P(t) = Q(t) Q(t)^* = Q(t)Q(\bar{t})^*&lt;/math&gt;Since the entries of &lt;math&gt;Q(t) Q(\bar{t})^*&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P(t)&lt;/math&gt; are complex polynomials which agree on the real line, they are in fact the same polynomials. We can conclude they in fact agree for all complex inputs.

== Rational spectral factorization ==
Let &lt;math&gt;p(t)&lt;/math&gt; be a rational polynomial function where &lt;math&gt;p(t) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; for almost all &lt;math&gt;t \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. Then there exists rational &lt;math&gt;q(t)&lt;/math&gt; with [[Positive polynomial|&lt;math&gt;p(t) = q(t) q(\bar{t})^*&lt;/math&gt;]] where &lt;math&gt;q(t)&lt;/math&gt; has no poles or zeroes in the lower half plane. This decomposition is unique up to multiplication by complex scalars of norm &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;. This is related to the statement of the Polynomial Matrix Spectral Factorization theorem restricted to the &lt;math&gt;1 \times 1&lt;/math&gt; case.

To prove existence write &lt;math&gt;p(x) = c \frac{\prod_i (x- \alpha_i)}{\prod_i (x-\beta_i)}&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i \neq \beta_j&lt;/math&gt;. Letting &lt;math&gt;x \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;we can conclude that &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is real and positive. Dividing out by &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{c} &lt;/math&gt; we reduce to the monic scenario. The numerator and denominator have distinct sets of roots, so all real roots which show up in either must have even multiplicity (to prevent a sign change locally). We can divide out these real roots to reduce to the case where &lt;math&gt;p(t)&lt;/math&gt; has only complex roots and poles. By hypothesis we have &lt;math&gt;p(x) = \frac{\prod_i (x- \alpha_i)}{\prod_i (x-\beta_i)} = \frac{\prod_i (x- \bar{\alpha_i})}{\prod_i (x-\bar{\beta_i})} = \bar{p(\bar{x})}&lt;/math&gt;. Since all of the &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i, \beta_j&lt;/math&gt;are complex (and hence not fixed points of conjugation) they both come in conjugate pairs. For each conjugate pair, pick the zero or pole in the upper half plane and accumulate these to obtain &lt;math&gt;q(t)&lt;/math&gt;. The uniqueness result follows in a standard fashion.

== Cholesky decomposition ==
The inspiration for this result is a factorization which characterizes positive definite matrices.

=== Decomposition for scalar matrices ===
Given any positive definite scalar matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, we are guaranteed by [[Cholesky decomposition]] &lt;math&gt;A = LL^*&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is a lower triangular matrix. If we don't restrict to lower triangular matrices we can consider all factorizations of the form &lt;math&gt;A = V V^*&lt;/math&gt;. It is not hard to check that all factorizations are achieved by looking at the orbit of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; under right multiplication by a unitary matrix, &lt;math&gt;V = L U&lt;/math&gt;.

To obtain the lower triangular decomposition we induct by splitting off the first row and first column:&lt;math display="block"&gt;\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} &amp; \mathbf{a}_{12}^* \\ \mathbf{a}_{12} &amp; A_{22} \\ \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} l_{11} &amp; 0 \\ \mathbf{l}_{21} &amp; L_{22} \end{bmatrix}  \begin{bmatrix} l_{11}^* &amp; \mathbf{l}_{21}^* \\ 0 &amp; L_{22}^* \end{bmatrix}  = \begin{bmatrix} l_{11} l_{11}^* &amp; l_{11} \mathbf{l}_{21}^* \\ l_{11}^* \mathbf{l}_{21} &amp; \mathbf{l}_{21} \mathbf{l}_{21}^*+  L_{22} L_{22}^* \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;Solving these in terms of &lt;math&gt;a_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; we get&lt;math display="block"&gt;l_{11} = \sqrt{a_{11}} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math display="block"&gt;\mathbf{l}_{21} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{a_{11}}}\mathbf{a}_{12} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math display="block"&gt;L_{22} L_{22}^* = A_{22} - \frac{1}{a_{11}} \mathbf{a}_{12} \mathbf{a}^*_{12} &lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is positive definite we have &lt;math&gt;a_{11}&lt;/math&gt;is a positive real number, so it has a square root. The last condition from induction since the right hand side is the [[Schur complement]] of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, which is itself positive definite.

=== Decomposition for rational matrices ===
Now consider &lt;math&gt;P(t) = \begin{bmatrix}p_{11}(t) &amp;\ldots &amp;p_{1n}(t) \\ \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots\\ p_{n1}(t) &amp; \cdots&amp; p_{nn}(t)\\  \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;where the &lt;math&gt;p_{ij}(t)&lt;/math&gt;are complex [[rational function]]s and &lt;math&gt;P(t)&lt;/math&gt; is positive definite hermitian for almost all real &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. Then by the symmetric [[Gaussian elimination]] we performed above, all we need to show is there exists a rational &lt;math&gt;q_{11}(t)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;p_{11}(t) = q_{11}(t) q_{11}(t)^*&lt;/math&gt;for real &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, which follows from our rational spectral factorization. Once we have that then we can solve for &lt;math&gt;l_{11}(t), \mathbf{l}_{21}(t)&lt;/math&gt;. Since the [[Schur complement]] is positive definite for the real &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; away from the poles and the Schur complement is a rational polynomial matrix we can induct to find &lt;math&gt;L_{22}&lt;/math&gt;.

It is not hard to check that we in fact get &lt;math&gt;P(t) = L(t) L(t)^*&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt;L(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a rational polynomial matrix with no poles in the lower half plane.

== Extension to polynomial decompositions ==
To prove the existence of polynomial matrix spectral factorization, we begin with the rational polynomial matrix Cholesky Decomposition and modify it to remove lower half plane singularities. Namely given  &lt;math&gt;P(t) = \begin{bmatrix}p_{11}(t) &amp;\ldots &amp;p_{1n}(t) \\ \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots\\ p_{n1}(t) &amp; \cdots&amp; p_{nn}(t)\\  \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;with each entry &lt;math&gt;p_{ij}(t)&lt;/math&gt; a complex coefficient polynomial we have rational polynomial matrix &lt;math&gt;L(t)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;P(t) = L(t) L(t)^*&lt;/math&gt;for real &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;L(t)&lt;/math&gt; has no lower half plane poles. Given a rational polynomial matrix &lt;math&gt;U(t)&lt;/math&gt; which is unitary valued for real &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, there exists another decomposition,&lt;math&gt;P(t) = L(t) L(t)^* = (L(t) U(t)) (L(t) U(t))^*&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Removing lower half-plane singularities ===
If &lt;math&gt;\det(L(a)) = 0&lt;/math&gt; then there exists a scalar unitary matrix &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;such that &lt;math&gt;U e_1 = \frac{a}{|a|}&lt;/math&gt;. This implies &lt;math&gt;L(t) U &lt;/math&gt;has first column vanish at &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. To remove the singularity at &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; we multiply by&lt;math display="block"&gt;U(t) = \operatorname{diag}(1, \ldots, \frac{z - \bar{a}}{z - a}, \ldots, 1)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;L(t) U U(t)&lt;/math&gt;has determinant with one less zero (by multiplicity) at a, without introducing any poles in the lower half plane of any of the entries.

=== Extend analyticity to all of C ===
After modifications, the decomposition &lt;math&gt;P(t)=Q(t) Q(t)^*&lt;/math&gt;satisfies &lt;math&gt;Q(t)&lt;/math&gt; is analytic and invertible on the lower half plane. To extend analyticity to the upper half plane we need this key observation: Given a rational matrix &lt;math&gt;Q(t)&lt;/math&gt; who is analytic in the lower half plane and nonsingular in the lower half plane, we have &lt;math&gt;Q(t)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is analytic and nonsingular in the lower half plane. The analyticity follows from the [[adjugate matrix]] formula (since both the entries of &lt;math&gt;Q(t)&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\det(Q(t))^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;are analytic on the lower half plane). The nonsingularity follows from &lt;math&gt;\det(Q(t)^{-1}) = \det(Q(t))^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;which can only have zeroes at places where &lt;math&gt;\det(Q(t))&lt;/math&gt; had poles. The determinant of a rational polynomial matrix can only have poles where its entries have poles, so &lt;math&gt;\det(Q(t))&lt;/math&gt; has no poles in the lower half plane.

From our observation in Extension to Complex Inputs, we have &lt;math&gt;P(t)=Q(t)Q(\bar{t})^*&lt;/math&gt;for all complex numbers. This implies &lt;math&gt;Q(\bar{t})=(P(t)Q(t)^{-1})^*&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;Q(t)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is analytic on the lower half plane, &lt;math&gt;Q(t)&lt;/math&gt; is analytic on the upper half plane. Finally if &lt;math&gt;Q(t)&lt;/math&gt; has a pole on the real line then &lt;math&gt;Q(\bar{t})^*&lt;/math&gt;has the same pole on the real line which contradicts the fact &lt;math&gt;P(t)&lt;/math&gt; has no poles on the real line (it is analytic everywhere by hypothesis).

The above shows that if &lt;math&gt;Q(t)&lt;/math&gt; is analytic and invertible on the lower half plane indeed &lt;math&gt;Q(t)&lt;/math&gt; is analytic everywhere and hence a polynomial matrix.

== Uniqueness ==
Given two polynomial matrix decompositions which are invertible on the lower half plane&lt;math&gt;P(t)=Q(t) Q(\bar{t})^*=R(t)R(\bar{t})^*&lt;/math&gt; we rearrange to &lt;math&gt;(R(t)^{-1} Q(t))(R(\bar{t})^{-1} Q(\bar{t}))^*=I&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;R(t)&lt;/math&gt; is analytic on the lower half plane and nonsingular, &lt;math&gt;R(t)^{-1}Q(t) &lt;/math&gt;is a rational polynomial matrix which is analytic and invertible on the lower half plane. Then by the same argument as above we have &lt;math&gt;R(t)^{-1}Q(t) &lt;/math&gt; is in fact a polynomial matrix which is unitary for all real &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. This means that if &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q}_i(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th row of &lt;math&gt;Q(t)&lt;/math&gt;then &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q}_i(t) \mathbf{q}_i(\bar{t})^* = 1&lt;/math&gt;. For real &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; this is a sum of non-negative polynomials which sums to a constant, implying each of the summands are in fact constant polynomials. Then &lt;math&gt;Q(t) = R(t) U&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is a scalar unitary matrix.

== Example ==
Consider &lt;math&gt;A(t) = \begin{bmatrix} t^2 + 1 &amp; 2 t \\ 2 t &amp; t^2 + 1 \\ \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;. Then through symmetric Gaussian elimination we get the rational decomposition &lt;math&gt;A(t) = \begin{bmatrix} t - i &amp; 0  \\ \frac{2t}{t + i} &amp; \frac{t^2 - 1}{t + i} \\ \end{bmatrix}  \begin{bmatrix} t - i &amp; 0  \\ \frac{2t}{t + i} &amp; \frac{t^2 - 1}{t + i} \\ \end{bmatrix}^* &lt;/math&gt;. This decomposition has no poles in the upper half plane. However the determinant is &lt;math&gt;\frac{(t-1) (t-i) (t+1)}{t+i}&lt;/math&gt;, so we need to modify our decomposition to get rid of the singularity at &lt;math&gt;-i&lt;/math&gt;. First we multiply by a scalar unitary matrix to make a column vanish at &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;. Consider &lt;math&gt;U =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 1 \\ i &amp; -i \\ \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;. Then we have a new candidate for our decomposition&lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} t - i &amp; 0  \\ \frac{2t}{t + i} &amp; \frac{t^2 - 1}{t + i} \\ \end{bmatrix} U = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix} t-i &amp; t - i \\ i \frac{(t-i)^2}{t+i} &amp; -i(t+i) \\ \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;. Now the first column vanishes at

&lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, so we multiply through (on the right) by &lt;math&gt;U(t)  =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix}\frac{t+i}{t-i} &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; to obtain &lt;math&gt; Q(t) = \begin{bmatrix} t - i &amp; 0  \\ \frac{2t}{t + i} &amp; \frac{t^2 - 1}{t + i} \\ \end{bmatrix} U U(t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix} t + i &amp; t - i \\ i(t-i) &amp; -i(t+i) \\ \end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt; Notice &lt;math&gt;\det(Q(t)) = i(1-t^2)&lt;/math&gt;. This is our desired decomposition &lt;math&gt;A(t) = Q(t) Q(t)^*&lt;/math&gt; with no singularities in the lower half plane.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12978">In [[computational biology]], '''power graph analysis''' is a method for the analysis and
representation of [[complex network]]s.  Power graph analysis is the computation, analysis and visual representation of a power graph from a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] ([[network (mathematics)|networks]]).

Power graph analysis can be thought of as a [[Lossless data compression|lossless compression algorithm]] for graphs.&lt;ref name="Reimann2015"/&gt; It extends graph syntax with representations of [[Clique (graph theory)|cliques]], [[Complete bipartite graph|bicliques]] and [[star graph|stars]]. Compression levels of up to 95% have been obtained for complex [[biological network]]s.

[[Hypergraph]]s are a generalization of graphs in which [[edge (graph theory)|edge]]s are not just couples of [[node (graph theory)|node]]s but arbitrary [[n-tuple]]s. Power graphs are not another generalization of graphs, but instead a novel representation of graphs that proposes a shift from the "node and edge" language to one using cliques, bicliques and stars as primitives.

==Power graphs==
[[Image:PowerGraphs.png|thumb|The primitive motifs used for power graph analysis and their corresponding diagrammatic representation: biclique, clique and star.]]

===Graphical representation===
Graphs are drawn with circles or points that represent '''nodes''' and lines connecting pairs of nodes that represent '''edges'''. Power graphs extend the syntax of graphs with '''power nodes''', which are drawn as a circle enclosing nodes or ''other power nodes'', and '''power edges''', which are lines between power nodes.

[[Complete bipartite graph|Bicliques]] are two sets of nodes with an edge between every member of one set and every member of the other set. In a power graph, a biclique is represented as an edge between two power nodes.

[[Clique (graph theory)|Cliques]] are a set of nodes with an edge between every pair of nodes. In a power graph, a clique is represented by a power node with a [[Loop (graph theory)|loop]].

[[Star (graph theory)|Star]]s are a set of nodes with an edge between every member of that set and a single node outside the set. In a power graph, a star is represented by a power edge between a regular node and a power node.

===Formal definition===
Given a graph &lt;math&gt;G = \bigl({V,E}\bigr)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; V = \bigl\{v_0, \dots , v_n\bigr\} &lt;/math&gt; is the set of nodes and &lt;math&gt;E \subseteq V \times V&lt;/math&gt; is the set of edges, a '''power graph''' &lt;math&gt;G' = \bigl({V',E'}\bigr)&lt;/math&gt; is a graph defined on the power set &lt;math&gt;V' \subseteq \mathcal{P} \bigl(V\bigr)&lt;/math&gt; of '''power nodes''' connected to each other by '''power edges''': &lt;math&gt;E' \subseteq V'\times V'&lt;/math&gt;. Hence power graphs are defined on the [[power set]] of nodes as well as on the [[power set]] of edges of the graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

The semantics of power graphs are as follows: if two power nodes are connected by a power edge, this means that all nodes of the first power node are connected to all nodes of the second power node. Similarly, if a power node is connected to itself by a power edge, this signifies that all nodes in the power node are connected to each other by edges.

The following two conditions are required:
* Power node hierarchy condition: Any two power nodes are either disjoint, or one is included in the other.
* Power edge disjointness condition: There is an [[Surjective function|onto mapping]] from edges of the original graph to power edges.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==Analogy to Fourier analysis==
The [[Fourier analysis]] of a function
can be seen as a rewriting of the function in terms of harmonic functions instead of
&lt;math&gt;t \mapsto x&lt;/math&gt; pairs. This transformation changes the point of view from '''time domain'''
to '''frequency domain''' and enables many interesting applications in [[signal analysis]], [[data compression]], 
and filtering.
Similarly, Power Graph Analysis is a rewriting or decomposition of a network using bicliques, cliques and stars
as primitive elements (just as harmonic functions for Fourier analysis). 
It can be used to analyze, compress and filter networks.
There are, however, several key differences. First, in Fourier analysis the two spaces (time and frequency domains)
are the same function space - but stricto sensu, power graphs are not graphs.
Second, there is not a unique power graph representing a given graph. Yet a very interesting class of power graphs 
are '''minimal power graphs''' which have the least number of power edges and power nodes necessary to represent a given graph.

==Minimal power graphs==
[[Image:PowerGraphNonUnicity.png|thumb|right|200px|Two different power graphs that represent the same graph.]]
In general, there is no unique minimal power graph for a given graph.
In this example (right) a graph of four nodes and five edges admits two minimal power graphs of two power edges each.
The main difference between these two minimal power graphs is the higher nesting level of the second power graph as well as a loss of symmetry with respect to the underlying graph.
Loss of symmetry is only a problem in small toy examples since complex networks rarely exhibit such symmetries in the first place.
Additionally, one can minimize the nesting level but even then, there is in general not a unique minimal power graph of minimal nesting level.

==Power graph greedy algorithm==
The power graph greedy algorithm relies on two simple steps to perform the decomposition:

The '''first step''' identifies candidate power nodes through a [[hierarchical clustering]] of the nodes in the network 
based on the similarity of their neighboring nodes. The similarity of two sets of neighbors is taken as the [[Jaccard index]] 
of the two sets.

The '''second step''' performs a greedy search for possible power edges between candidate power nodes.
Power edges abstracting the most edges in the original network are added first to the power graph. 
Thus bicliques, cliques and stars are incrementally replaced with power edges, until all remaining single edges are also added.
Candidate power nodes that are not the end point of any power edge are ignored.

==Modular decomposition==
[[Modular decomposition]] can be used to compute a power graph by using 
the strong modules of the modular decomposition.
Modules in modular decomposition are groups of nodes in a graph that
have identical neighbors. A Strong Module is a module that does not overlap 
with another module. 
However, in [[complex networks]] strong modules are more the exception than the 
rule. Therefore, the power graphs obtained through modular decomposition are far 
from minimality.
The main difference between modular decomposition and power graph analysis is the 
emphasis of power graph analysis in decomposing graphs not only using modules of nodes 
but also modules of edges (cliques, bicliques). Indeed, power graph analysis can be seen as a loss-less 
simultaneous clustering of both nodes and edges.

==Applications==

===Biological networks===
Power Graph Analysis has been shown to be useful for the analysis of several types of biological networks such as [[Protein-protein interaction]] networks,&lt;ref name="powergraphs"/&gt; domain-peptide binding motifs, [[Gene regulatory networks]]&lt;ref name="mir-124"/&gt; and Homology/Paralogy networks. 
Also a network of significant disease-trait pairs&lt;ref name="Li2014"/&gt; have been recently visualized and analyzed with Power Graphs.

Network compression, a new measure derived from Power Graphs, has been proposed as a quality measure for protein interaction networks.&lt;ref name="net_comp"/&gt;

===Drug repositioning===
Power Graphs have been also applied to the analysis of drug-target-disease networks&lt;ref name="inc_bicliques"/&gt; for [[Drug repositioning]].

===Social networks===
Power Graphs have been applied to large-scale data in social networks, for community mining&lt;ref name="lsds"/&gt; or for modeling author types.&lt;ref name="lncs"/&gt;

'''Quantum teleportation''' is a process by which [[quantum information]] (e.g. the exact state of an atom or photon) can be transmitted (exactly, in principle)  from one location to another, with the help of [[Classical information#Classical versus quantum information|classical communication]] and previously shared [[quantum entanglement]] between the sending and receiving location. Because it depends on classical communication, which can proceed no faster than the speed of light, it cannot be used for [[faster-than-light]] transport or communication of classical bits. While it has proven possible to teleport one or more [[qubit]]s of information between two (entangled) atoms,&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="riebe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="barrett"/&gt; this has not yet been achieved between anything larger than [[molecules]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a25699/how-quantum-teleportation-works/ | title=How Quantum Teleportation Actually Works| journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series A| volume=456| issue=1999| pages=1759| date=2017-03-16| last1=Deutsch| first1=David| last2=Hayden| first2=Patrick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the name is inspired by the [[teleportation]] commonly used in [[fiction]], quantum teleportation is limited to the transfer of information rather than matter itself. Quantum teleportation is not a form of transportation, but of communication: it provides a way of transporting a qubit from one location to another without having to move a physical particle along with it.

The term was coined by physicist [[Charles H. Bennett (computer scientist)|Charles Bennett]]. The seminal paper&lt;ref name="BBCJPW93"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=[[Charles H.

==Non-technical summary==
In matters relating to quantum or classical [[information theory]], it is convenient to work with the simplest possible unit of information, the two-state system. In classical information, this is a [[bit]], commonly represented using one or zero (or true or false). The quantum analog of a bit is a quantum bit, or qubit. Qubits encode a type of information, called [[quantum information]], which differs sharply from "classical" information. For example, quantum information can be neither copied (the [[no-cloning theorem]]) nor destroyed (the [[no-deleting theorem]]).

Quantum teleportation provides a mechanism of moving a qubit from one location to another, without having to physically transport the underlying particle to which that qubit is normally attached. Much like the invention of the [[telegraph]] allowed classical bits to be transported at high speed across continents, quantum teleportation holds the promise that one day, qubits could be moved likewise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The quantum internet |first1=H. J. |last1=Kimble |journal=Nature |volume=453 |issue=7198 |pages=1023–1030 |date=2008 |doi=10.1038/nature07127|pmid=18563153 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The quantum internet is already being built |author=Michael Lucy |date=2018-04-13 |journal=Cosmos |issue=78 |url=https://cosmosmagazine.com/technology/the-quantum-internet-is-already-being-built |accessdate=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, the quantum states of single photons, photon modes, single atoms, atomic ensembles, defect centers in solids, single electrons, and superconducting circuits have been employed as information bearers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Advances in quantum teleportation |authors=S.

The movement of qubits does not require the movement of "things" any more than communication over the internet does: no quantum object needs to be transported, but it is necessary to communicate two classical bits per teleported qubit from the sender to the receiver. The actual teleportation protocol requires that an [[entangled state|entangled quantum state]] or [[Bell state]] be created, and its two parts shared between two locations (the source and destination, or [[Alice and Bob]]). In essence, a certain kind of [[quantum channel]] between two sites must be established first, before a qubit can be moved. Teleportation also requires a [[communication channel|classical information channel]] to be established, as two classical bits must be transmitted to accompany each qubit. The reason for this is that the results of the measurements must be communicated, and this must be done over ordinary classical communication channels. The need for such classical channels may, at first, seem disappointing; however, this is not unlike ordinary communications, which requires wires, radios or lasers.{{explain|date=April 2018}}{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} What's more, Bell states are most easily shared using [[photon]]s from [[laser]]s,{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} and so teleportation could be done, in principle, through open space, i.e., without the need to send the light through cables or optical fibers.

An important aspect of quantum information theory is entanglement, which imposes statistical correlations between otherwise distinct physical systems. These correlations hold even when measurements are chosen and performed independently, out of causal contact from one another, as verified in [[Bell test experiments]]. Thus, an observation resulting from a measurement choice made at one point in spacetime seems to instantaneously affect outcomes in another region, even though light hasn't yet had time to travel the distance; a conclusion seemingly at odds with [[special relativity]] ([[EPR paradox]]). However such correlations can never be used to transmit any information faster than the speed of light, a statement encapsulated in the [[no-communication theorem]]. Thus, teleportation, as a whole, can never be [[superluminal]], as a qubit cannot be reconstructed until the accompanying classical information arrives.

Understanding quantum teleportation requires a good grounding in finite-dimensional [[linear algebra]], [[Hilbert space]]s and [[projection matrix]]es. A qubit is described using a two-dimensional [[complex number]]-valued [[vector space]] (a Hilbert space), which are the primary basis for the formal manipulations given below. A working knowledge of quantum mechanics is not absolutely required to understand the mathematics of quantum teleportation, although without such acquaintance, the deeper meaning of the equations may remain quite mysterious.

==Protocol==
[[File:Quantum teleportation diagram.PNG|300px|thumb|right| Diagram for quantum teleportation of a photon]]

The prerequisites for quantum teleportation are a qubit that is to be teleported, a conventional [[communication channel]] capable of transmitting two classical bits (i.e., one of four states), and means of generating an entangled EPR pair of qubits, transporting each of these to two different locations, A and B, performing a [[Bell measurement]] on one of the EPR pair qubits, and manipulating the quantum state of the other pair. The [[protocol (computing)|protocol]] is then as follows:

# An EPR pair is generated, one qubit sent to location A, the other to B.
# At location A, a Bell measurement of the EPR pair qubit and the qubit to be teleported (the quantum state &lt;math&gt;|\phi \rangle&lt;/math&gt;) is performed, yielding one of four measurement outcomes, which can be encoded in two classical bits of information. Both qubits at location A are then discarded.
# Using the classical channel, the two bits are sent from A to B. (This is the only potentially time-consuming step after step 1, due to speed-of-light considerations.)
# As a result of the measurement performed at location A, the EPR pair qubit at location B is in one of four possible states. Of these four possible states, one is identical to the original quantum state &lt;math&gt;|\phi \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, and the other three are closely related. Which of these four possibilities actually obtained, is encoded in the two classical bits. Knowing this, the EPR pair qubit at location B is modified in one of three ways, or not at all, to result in a qubit identical to &lt;math&gt;|\phi \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, the qubit that was chosen for teleportation.

==Formal presentation==
There are a variety of ways in which the teleportation protocol can be written mathematically. Some are very compact but abstract, and some are verbose but straightforward and concrete. The presentation below is of the latter form: verbose, but has the benefit of showing each quantum state simply and directly. Later sections review more compact notations.

The teleportation protocol begins with a quantum state or qubit &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, in Alice's possession, that she wants to convey to Bob. This qubit can be written generally, in [[bra–ket notation]], as:

:&lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle_C = \alpha |0\rangle_C + \beta|1\rangle_C.&lt;/math&gt;

The subscript ''C'' above is used only to distinguish this state from ''A'' and ''B'', below.

Next, the protocol requires that Alice and Bob share a maximally entangled state. This state is fixed in advance, by mutual agreement between Alice and Bob, and can be any one of the four Bell states shown. It does not matter which one.

:&lt;math&gt;|\Phi^+\rangle_{AB} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|0\rangle_A \otimes |0\rangle_{B} + |1\rangle_A \otimes |1\rangle_{B})&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;|\Phi^-\rangle_{AB} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|0\rangle_A \otimes |0\rangle_{B} - |1\rangle_A \otimes |1\rangle_{B})&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;|\Psi^+\rangle_{AB} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|0\rangle_A \otimes |1\rangle_{B} + |1\rangle_A \otimes |0\rangle_{B})&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;|\Psi^-\rangle_{AB} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|0\rangle_A \otimes |1\rangle_{B} - |1\rangle_A \otimes |0\rangle_{B})&lt;/math&gt;.

In the following, assume that Alice and Bob share the state &lt;math&gt;|\Phi^+\rangle_{AB}.&lt;/math&gt;
Alice obtains one of the particles in the pair, with the other going to Bob. (This is implemented by preparing the particles together and shooting them to Alice and Bob from a common source.) The subscripts ''A'' and ''B'' in the entangled state refer to Alice's or Bob's particle.

At this point, Alice has two particles (''C'', the one she wants to teleport, and ''A'', one of the entangled pair), and Bob has one particle, ''B''. In the total system, the state of these three particles is given by

:&lt;math&gt; |\psi\rangle_C\otimes|\Phi^+\rangle_{AB}   = (\alpha |0\rangle_C + \beta|1\rangle_C)\otimes\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|0\rangle_A \otimes |0\rangle_B + |1\rangle_A \otimes |1\rangle_B) . &lt;/math&gt;

Alice will then make a local measurement in the Bell basis (i.e. the four Bell states) on the two particles in her possession. To make the result of her measurement clear, it is best to write the state of Alice's two qubits as superpositions of the Bell basis. This is done by using the following general identities, which are easily verified:

:&lt;math&gt;|0\rangle \otimes |0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\Phi^+\rangle + |\Phi^-\rangle),&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;|0\rangle \otimes |1\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\Psi^+\rangle + |\Psi^-\rangle),&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;|1\rangle \otimes |0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\Psi^+\rangle - |\Psi^-\rangle),&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;|1\rangle \otimes |1\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\Phi^+\rangle - |\Phi^-\rangle).&lt;/math&gt;

One applies these identities with ''A'' and ''C'' subscripts. The total three particle state, of ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'' together, thus becomes the following four-term superposition:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
| &amp; \psi\rangle_C \otimes\ |\Phi^+\rangle_{AB} \   = \\
\frac{1}{2} \Big \lbrack
\ &amp; |\Phi^+\rangle_{AC} \otimes (\alpha |0\rangle_B + \beta|1\rangle_B)
\ + \ |\Phi^-\rangle_{AC} \otimes (\alpha |0\rangle_B - \beta|1\rangle_B) \\
\ + \ &amp; |\Psi^+\rangle_{AC} \otimes (\beta |0\rangle_B + \alpha|1\rangle_B)
\ + \ |\Psi^-\rangle_{AC} \otimes (\beta |0\rangle_B - \alpha|1\rangle_B) \Big \rbrack . \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Quantum Computation and Quantum Information|last=Chuang|first=Nielsen|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The above is just a change of basis on Alice's part of the system. No operation has been performed and the three particles are still in the same total state. The actual teleportation occurs when Alice measures her two qubits A,C, in the Bell basis

:&lt;math&gt;|\Phi^+\rangle_{AC}, |\Phi^-\rangle_{AC}, |\Psi^+\rangle_{AC}, |\Psi^-\rangle_{AC}&lt;/math&gt;.

Experimentally, this measurement may be achieved via a series of laser pulses directed at the two particles{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}. Given the above expression, evidently the result of Alice's (local) measurement is that the three-particle state would [[Wave function collapse|collapse]] to one of the following four states (with equal probability of obtaining each):

*&lt;math&gt;|\Phi^+\rangle_{AC} \otimes (\alpha |0\rangle_B + \beta|1\rangle_B)&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;|\Phi^-\rangle_{AC} \otimes (\alpha |0\rangle_B - \beta|1\rangle_B)&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;|\Psi^+\rangle_{AC} \otimes (\beta |0\rangle_B + \alpha|1\rangle_B)&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;|\Psi^-\rangle_{AC} \otimes (\beta |0\rangle_B - \alpha|1\rangle_B)&lt;/math&gt;

Alice's two particles are now entangled to each other, in one of the four [[Bell states]], and the entanglement originally shared between Alice's and Bob's particles is now broken. Bob's particle takes on one of the four superposition states shown above. Note how Bob's qubit is now in a state that resembles the state to be teleported. The four possible states for Bob's qubit are unitary images of the state to be teleported.

The result of Alice's Bell measurement tells her which of the above four states the system is in. She can now send her result to Bob through a classical channel. Two classical bits can communicate which of the four results she obtained.

After Bob receives the message from Alice, he will know which of the four states his particle is in. Using this information, he performs a unitary operation on his particle to transform it to the desired state &lt;math&gt;\alpha |0\rangle_B + \beta|1\rangle_B&lt;/math&gt;:

*If Alice indicates her result is &lt;math&gt;|\Phi^+\rangle_{AC}&lt;/math&gt;, Bob knows his qubit is already in the desired state and does nothing. This amounts to the trivial unitary operation, the identity operator.
*If the message indicates &lt;math&gt;|\Phi^-\rangle_{AC}&lt;/math&gt;, Bob would send his qubit through the unitary [[quantum gate]] given by the [[Pauli matrix]]

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_3 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -1\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

to recover the state.

*If Alice's message corresponds to &lt;math&gt;|\Psi^+\rangle_{AC}&lt;/math&gt;, Bob applies the gate

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

to his qubit.

*Finally, for the remaining case, the appropriate gate is given by

:&lt;math&gt;  \sigma_1 \sigma_3  =  - \sigma_3 \sigma_1 =  -i \sigma_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; -1 \\ 1 &amp; 0\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

Teleportation is thus achieved. The above-mentioned three gates correspond to rotations of π radians (180°) about appropriate axes (X, Y and Z).{{clarify|reason=This remark is confusing. Rotations of what? And don't the 3 rotations generate an abelian group of order 8, whereas the 3 gates don't commute? One is the spin representation, but this should be spelled out.|date=May 2015}}
[[File:Quantum Teleportation.gif|thumb|370x370px|Demonstration of quantum teleportation of a single qubit using [https://sites.google.com/view/quantum-kit/ Q-Kit]]]
Some remarks:

* After this operation, Bob's qubit will take on the state &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle_B= \alpha |0\rangle_B + \beta|1\rangle_B&lt;/math&gt;, and Alice's qubit becomes an (undefined) part of an entangled state. Teleportation does not result in the copying of qubits, and hence is consistent with the [[no cloning theorem]].
* There is no transfer of matter or energy involved. Alice's particle has not been physically moved to Bob; only its state has been transferred. The term "teleportation", coined by Bennett, Brassard, Crépeau, Jozsa, Peres and Wootters, reflects the indistinguishability of quantum mechanical particles.
* For every qubit teleported, Alice needs to send Bob two classical bits of information. These two classical bits do not carry complete information about the qubit being teleported. If an eavesdropper intercepts the two bits, she may know exactly what Bob needs to do in order to recover the desired state. However, this information is useless if she cannot interact with the entangled particle in Bob's possession.
Quantum circuit for a single qubit quantum teleportation is demonstrated using [https://sites.google.com/view/quantum-kit/ Q-Kit], a quantum circuit simulator with graphical interface. Alice's state in qubit 2 is transferred to Bob's qubit 0 using a priorly entangled pair of qubits between Alice and Bob, qubits 1 and 0.

[[File:Quantum teleportation circuit.svg|300px|thumb|right| [[Quantum circuit]] representation of quantum teleportation]]

There are a variety of different notations in use that describe the teleportation protocol. One common one is by using the notation of [[quantum gate]]s. In the above derivation, the unitary transformation that is the change of basis (from the standard product basis into the Bell basis) can be written using quantum gates. Direct calculation shows that this gate is given by

:&lt;math&gt;G = (H \otimes I) \; C_N&lt;/math&gt;

where ''H'' is the one qubit [[Hadamard gate|Walsh-Hadamard gate]] and &lt;math&gt;C_N&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Controlled NOT gate]].

== Entanglement swapping ==
Teleportation can be applied not just to pure states, but also [[density matrix|mixed states]], that can be regarded as the state of a single subsystem of an entangled pair. The so-called entanglement swapping is a simple and illustrative example.

If Alice has a particle which is entangled with a particle owned by Bob, and Bob teleports it to Carol, then afterwards, Alice's particle is entangled with Carol's.

A more symmetric way to describe the situation is the following: Alice has one particle, Bob two, and Carol one. Alice's particle and Bob's first particle are entangled, and so are Bob's second and Carol's particle:
                       ___
                      /   \
  Alice-:-:-:-:-:-Bob1 -:- Bob2-:-:-:-:-:-Carol
                      \___/

Now, if Bob does a projective measurement on his two particles in the Bell state basis and communicates the results to Carol, as per the teleportation scheme described above, the state of Bob's first particle can be teleported to Carol's. Although Alice and Carol never interacted with each other, their particles are now entangled.

A detailed diagrammatic derivation of entanglement swapping has been given by [[Bob Coecke]],&lt;ref&gt;Bob Coecke, "The logic of entanglement". ''Research Report PRG-RR-03-12'', 2003. [https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0402014 arXiv:quant-ph/0402014] (8 page shortversion) [http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/publications/tr/rr-03-12.html (full 160 page version)]&lt;/ref&gt; presented in terms of [[categorical quantum mechanics]].

== Generalizations of the Teleportation Protocol ==
The basic teleportation protocol for a qubit described above has been generalized in several directions, in particular regarding the dimension of the system teleported and the number of parties involved (either as sender, controller, or receiver).

==== ''d''-dimensional systems ====
A generalization to &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-level systems (so-called [[qudit]]s) is straight forward and was already discussed in the original paper by Bennett ''et al.'':&lt;ref name="BBCJPW93"/&gt; the maximally entangled state of two qubits has to be replaced by a maximally entangled state of two qudits and the Bell measurement by a measurement defined by a maximally entangled orthonormal basis. All possible such generalizations were discussed by Werner in 2001.&lt;ref name="Werner2001"&gt;{{cite journal |title=All teleportation and dense coding schemes |last1=Werner |first1=Reinhard F. |date=2001 |journal=J.

The generalization to infinite-dimensional so-called [[Continuous-variable quantum information|continuous-variable systems]] was proposed in &lt;ref name="BrKi98"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=S. L. |last1=Braunstein |first2=H. J. |last2=Kimble |title=Teleportation of Continuous Quantum Variables |journal=Phys. Rev.

==== Multipartite versions ====
The use of [[Multipartite entanglement|multipartite entangled states]] instead of a bipartite maximally entangled state allows for several new features: either the sender can teleport information to several receivers either sending the same state to all of them (which allows to reduce the amount of entanglement needed for the process) &lt;ref name="DuCi00"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Multiparty teleportation |author=W.

== Logic gate teleportation ==
In general, [[mixed state (physics)|mixed states]] ρ may be transported, and a linear transformation ω applied during teleportation, thus allowing data processing of [[quantum information]]. This is one of the foundational building blocks of quantum information processing. This is demonstrated below.

=== General description ===

A general teleportation scheme can be described as follows. Three quantum systems are involved. System 1 is the (unknown) state ''ρ'' to be teleported by Alice. Systems 2 and 3 are in a maximally entangled state ''ω'' that are distributed to Alice and Bob, respectively. The total system is then in the state

:&lt;math&gt;\rho \otimes \omega.&lt;/math&gt;

A successful teleportation process is a [[LOCC]] [[quantum channel]] Φ that satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;(\operatorname{Tr}_{12} \circ \Phi ) (\rho \otimes \omega) = \rho\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where Tr&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[partial trace]] operation with respect systems 1 and 2, and &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt; denotes the composition of maps. This describes the channel in the Schrödinger picture.

Taking adjoint maps in the Heisenberg picture, the success condition becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\langle \Phi(\rho \otimes \omega)| I \otimes O \rangle = \langle \rho | O \rangle&lt;/math&gt;

for all observable ''O'' on Bob's system. The tensor factor in &lt;math&gt;I \otimes O&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;12 \otimes 3&lt;/math&gt; while that of &lt;math&gt;\rho \otimes \omega&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;1 \otimes 23&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Further details ===

The proposed channel Φ can be described more explicitly. To begin teleportation, Alice performs a local measurement on the two subsystems (1 and 2) in her possession. Assume the local measurement have ''effects''

:&lt;math&gt;{F_i} = {M_i ^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

If the measurement registers the ''i''-th outcome, the overall state collapses to

:&lt;math&gt;(M_i \otimes I)(\rho \otimes \omega)(M_i \otimes I).&lt;/math&gt;

The tensor factor in &lt;math&gt;(M_i \otimes I)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;12 \otimes 3&lt;/math&gt; while that of &lt;math&gt;\rho \otimes \omega&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;1 \otimes 23&lt;/math&gt;. Bob then applies a corresponding local operation Ψ''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' on system 3. On the combined system, this is described by

:&lt;math&gt;(Id \otimes \Psi_i)(M_i \otimes I)(\rho \otimes \omega)(M_i \otimes I).&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Id'' is the identity map on the composite system &lt;math&gt;1 \otimes 2&lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore, the channel Φ is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi (\rho \otimes \omega) = \sum_i (Id \otimes \Psi_i)(M_i \otimes I)(\rho \otimes \omega)(M_i \otimes I)&lt;/math&gt;

Notice Φ satisfies the definition of [[LOCC]]. As stated above, the teleportation is said to be successful if, for all observable ''O'' on Bob's system, the equality

:&lt;math&gt;\langle \Phi(\rho \otimes \omega), I \otimes O \rangle = \langle \rho, O \rangle&lt;/math&gt;

holds. The left hand side of the equation is:

:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_i \langle (Id \otimes \Psi_i)(M_i \otimes I)(\rho \otimes \omega)(M_i \otimes I), \; I \otimes O \rangle
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
= \sum_i \langle (M_i \otimes I)(\rho \otimes \omega)(M_i \otimes I), \; I \otimes \Psi_i ^*(O)\rangle 
&lt;/math&gt;

where Ψ''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;*'' is the adjoint of Ψ''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' in the Heisenberg picture. Assuming all objects are finite dimensional, this becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_i \operatorname{Tr} \; (\rho \otimes \omega)(F_i \otimes \Psi_i^*(O)).&lt;/math&gt;

The success criterion for teleportation has the expression

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_i \operatorname{Tr} \; (\rho \otimes \omega)(F_i \otimes \Psi_i ^*(O)) = \operatorname{Tr} \; \rho \cdot O.&lt;/math&gt;

==Local explanation of the phenomenon==

A [[Principle of locality#Quantum mechanics|local]] explanation of quantum teleportation is put forward by [[David Deutsch]] and [[Patrick Hayden (scientist)|Patrick Hayden]], with respect to the [[many-worlds interpretation]] of quantum mechanics. Their paper asserts that the two bits that Alice sends Bob contain "locally inaccessible information" resulting in the teleportation of the quantum state. "The ability of quantum information to flow through a classical channel ..., surviving decoherence, is ... the
basis of quantum teleportation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| arxiv=quant-ph/9906007| last1=Deutsch| first1=David| title=Information Flow in Entangled Quantum Systems| journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences| volume=456| issue=1999| pages=1759–1774| last2=Hayden| first2=Patrick| date=1999| doi=10.1098/rspa.2000.0585|bibcode = 2000RSPSA.456.1759H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7855">In mathematics, a '''read-once function''' is a special type of [[Boolean function]] that can be described by a [[Boolean expression]] in which each [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]] appears only once.

More precisely, the expression is required to use only the operations of [[logical conjunction]], [[logical disjunction]], and [[negation]]. By applying [[De Morgan's laws]], such an expression can be transformed into one in which negation is used only on individual variables (still with each variable appearing only once). By replacing each negated variable with a new positive variable representing its negation, such a function can be transformed into an equivalent [[Monotonic function|positive]] read-once Boolean function, represented by a read-once expression without negations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Golumbic|Gurvich|2011}}, p.&amp;nbsp;519.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
For example, for three variables {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, and {{mvar|c}}, the expressions
:&lt;math&gt;a \wedge b \wedge c&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a \wedge (b \vee c)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(a \wedge b)\vee c&lt;/math&gt;, and
:&lt;math&gt;a\vee b\vee c&lt;/math&gt;
are all read-once (as are the other functions obtained by permuting the variables in these expressions). However, the Boolean [[Median algebra|median]] operation, given by the expression
:&lt;math&gt;(a\vee b)\wedge (a\vee c)\wedge (b\wedge c)&lt;/math&gt;
is not read-once: this formula has more than one copy of each variable, and there is no equivalent formula that uses each variable only once.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Golumbic|Gurvich|2011}}, p.&amp;nbsp;520.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characterization==
The [[disjunctive normal form]] of a (positive) read-once function is not generally itself read-once. Nevertheless, it carries important information about the function. In particular, if one forms a ''co-occurrence graph'' in which the vertices represent variables, and edges connect pairs of variables that both occur in the same clause of the conjunctive normal form, then the co-occurrence graph of a read-once function is necessarily a [[cograph]]. More precisely, a positive Boolean function is read-once if and only if its co-occurrence graph is a cograph, and in addition every [[maximal clique]] of the co-occurrence graph forms one of the conjunctions (prime implicants) of the disjunctive normal form.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Golumbic|Gurvich|2011}}, Theorem 10.1, p.&amp;nbsp;521; {{harvtxt|Golumbic|Mintz|Rotics|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, when interpreted as a function on sets of vertices of its co-occurrence graph, a read-once function is true for sets of vertices that contain a maximal clique, and false otherwise. 
For instance the median function has the same co-occurrence graph as the conjunction of three variables, a [[triangle graph]], but the three-vertex complete subgraph of this graph (the whole graph) forms a subset of a clause only for the conjunction and not for the median.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Golumbic|Gurvich|2011}}, Examples {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}, p.&amp;nbsp;521.&lt;/ref&gt;
Two variables of a positive read-once expression are adjacent in the co-occurrence graph if and only if their [[lowest common ancestor]] in the expression is a conjunction,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Golumbic|Gurvich|2011}}, Lemma 10.1, p.&amp;nbsp;529.&lt;/ref&gt; so the expression tree can be interpreted as a cotree for the corresponding cograph.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Golumbic|Gurvich|2011}}, Remark 10.4, pp.&amp;nbsp;540–541.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another alternative characterization of positive read-once functions combines their disjunctive and [[conjunctive normal form]]. A positive function of a given system of variables, that uses all of its variables, is read-once if and only if every prime implicant of the disjunctive normal form and every clause of the conjunctive normal form have exactly one variable in common.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gurvič|1977}}; {{harvtxt|Mundici|1989}}; {{harvtxt|Karchmer|Linial|Newman|Saks|1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
It is possible to recognize read-once functions from their disjunctive normal form expressions in [[polynomial time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Golumbic|Gurvich|2011}}, Theorem 10.8, p.&amp;nbsp;541; {{harvtxt|Golumbic|Mintz|Rotics|2006}}; {{harvtxt|Golumbic|Mintz|Rotics|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
It is also possible to find a read-once expression for a positive read-once function, given access to the function only through a "black box" that allows its evaluation at any [[truth assignment]], using only a quadratic number of function evaluations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Golumbic|Gurvich|2011}}, Theorem 10.9, p.&amp;nbsp;548; {{harvtxt|Angluin|Hellerstein|Karpinski|1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[geometry]], various '''formalisms''' exist to express a [[rotation (mathematics)|rotation]] in three [[dimension (vector space)|dimensions]] as a mathematical [[transformation (geometry)|transformation]]. In physics, this concept is applied to [[classical mechanics]] where rotational (or angular) [[kinematics]] is the science of [[quantity|quantitative]] description of a purely rotational [[motion (physics)|motion]]. The [[orientation (geometry)|orientation]] of an object at a given instant is described with the same tools, as it is defined as an imaginary rotation from a reference placement in space, rather than an actually observed rotation from a previous placement in space.

According to [[Euler's rotation theorem]] the rotation of a [[rigid body]] (or three-dimensional [[coordinate system]] with the fixed [[origin (mathematics)|origin]]) is described by a single rotation about some axis. Such a rotation may be uniquely described by a minimum of three [[real number|real]] parameters. However, for various reasons, there are several ways to represent it. Many of these representations use more than the necessary minimum of three parameters, although each of them still has only three [[degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]].

An example where rotation representation is used is in [[computer vision]], where an [[automation|automated]] observer needs to track a target. Let's consider a rigid body, with three [[orthonormal basis|orthogonal unit vectors]]&lt;!-- this kludge works around a sea of blue --&gt; fixed to its body (representing the three axes of the object's local [[Cartesian coordinate system|coordinate system]]). The basic problem is to specify the orientation of these three [[unit vector]]s, and hence the rigid body, with respect to the observer's coordinate system, regarded as a reference placement in space.

==Rotations and motions==
{{main article|Motion (geometry)|Rotation (mathematics)}}
Rotation formalisms are focused on proper ([[orientation (vector space)|orientation-preserving]]) motions of the [[Euclidean space]] with [[stabilizer (group theory)|one fixed point]], that a ''rotation'' refers to. Although physical motions with a fixed point are an important case (such as ones described in the [[center-of-mass frame]], or motions of a [[joint (mechanics)|joint]]), this approach creates a knowledge about all motions. Any proper motion of the Euclidean space decomposes to a rotation around the origin and a [[translation (geometry)|translation]]. Whichever the order of their [[function composition|composition]] will be, the "pure" rotation component wouldn't change, uniquely determined by the complete motion.

One can also understand "pure" rotations as [[linear map]]s in a [[vector space]] equipped with Euclidean structure, not as maps of [[point (geometry)|points]] of a corresponding [[affine space]]. In other words, a rotation formalism captures only the rotational part of a motion, that contains three degrees of freedom, and ignores the translational part, that contains another three.

==Formalism alternatives==

===Rotation matrix===
{{Main article|Rotation matrix}}

The above-mentioned triad of [[unit vector]]s is also called a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]]. Specifying [[real coordinate space|the coordinates]] (''components'') of vectors of this basis in its current (rotated) position, in terms of the reference (non-rotated) coordinate axes, will completely describe the rotation. The three unit vectors, {{math|'''û'''}}, {{math|'''v̂'''}} and {{math|'''ŵ'''}}, that form the rotated basis each consist of 3&amp;nbsp;coordinates, yielding a total of 9&amp;nbsp;parameters.

These parameters can be written as the elements of a {{nowrap|3 × 3}} matrix {{math|'''A'''}}, called a '''rotation matrix'''. Typically, the coordinates of each of these vectors are arranged along a column of the matrix (however, beware that an alternative definition of rotation matrix exists and is widely used, where the vectors coordinates defined above are arranged by rows&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|title=Rotation Matrix|id=RotationMatrix}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{A} =
\left[ {\begin{array}{ccc}
   \hat{\mathbf{u}}_x &amp; \hat{\mathbf{v}}_x &amp; \hat{\mathbf{w}}_x \\
   \hat{\mathbf{u}}_y &amp; \hat{\mathbf{v}}_y &amp; \hat{\mathbf{w}}_y \\
   \hat{\mathbf{u}}_z &amp; \hat{\mathbf{v}}_z &amp; \hat{\mathbf{w}}_z \\
\end{array}} \right]
&lt;/math&gt;

The elements of the rotation matrix are not all independent—as Euler's rotation theorem dictates, the rotation matrix has only three degrees of freedom.

The rotation matrix has the following properties:
* {{math|'''A'''}} is a real, [[orthogonal matrix]], hence each of its rows or columns represents a [[unit vector]].
* The [[eigenvalues]] of {{math|'''A'''}} are
::&lt;math&gt;\left\{1, e^{\pm i\theta} \right\} = \{1,\ \cos\theta+i\sin\theta,\ \cos\theta-i\sin\theta\}&lt;/math&gt;
:where {{math|''i''}} is the standard [[imaginary unit]] with the property {{math|''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} −1}}
* The [[determinant]] of {{math|'''A'''}} is +1, equivalent to the product of its eigenvalues.
* The [[Trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of {{math|'''A'''}} is {{math|1 + 2 cos ''θ''}}, equivalent to the sum of its eigenvalues.

The angle {{mvar|θ}} which appears in the eigenvalue expression corresponds to the angle of the Euler axis and angle representation. The [[eigenvector]] corresponding to the eigenvalue of 1 is the accompanying Euler axis, since the axis is the only (nonzero) vector which remains unchanged by left-multiplying (rotating) it with the rotation matrix.

The above properties are equivalent to:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 |\hat{\mathbf u}| = |\hat{\mathbf v}| &amp;= 1\\
 \hat{\mathbf u} \cdot \hat{\mathbf v} &amp;= 0\\
 \hat{\mathbf u} \times \hat{\mathbf v} &amp;= \hat{\mathbf w} \,,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
which is another way of stating that {{math|('''û''', '''v̂''', '''ŵ''')}} form a 3D [[orthonormal basis]]. These statements comprise a total of 6 conditions (the cross product contains 3), leaving the rotation matrix with just 3 degrees of freedom, as required.

Two successive rotations represented by matrices {{math|'''A'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|'''A'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} are easily combined as elements of a group,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}_\text{total} = \mathbf{A}_2\mathbf{A}_1&lt;/math&gt; 
(Note the order, since the vector being rotated is multiplied from the right).

The ease by which vectors can be rotated using a rotation matrix, as well as the ease of combining successive rotations, make the rotation matrix a useful and popular way to represent rotations, even though it is less concise than other representations.

===Euler axis and angle (rotation vector)===
[[Image:Euler AxisAngle.png|thumb|right|A visualization of a rotation represented by an Euler axis and angle.]]
{{Main article|Axis–angle representation}}
From [[Euler's rotation theorem]] we know that any rotation can be expressed as a single rotation about some axis. The axis is the unit vector (unique except for sign) which remains unchanged by the rotation. The magnitude of the angle is also unique, with its sign being determined by the sign of the rotation axis.

The axis can be represented as a three-dimensional [[unit vector]]
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{e}} = \begin{bmatrix} e_x \\ e_y \\ e_z \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
and the angle by a scalar {{mvar|θ}}.

Since the axis is normalized, it has only two [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]]. The angle adds the third degree of freedom to this rotation representation.

One may wish to express rotation as a '''rotation vector''', or '''Euler vector''', an un-normalized three-dimensional vector the direction of which specifies the axis, and the length of which is {{mvar|θ}},
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} = \theta \hat{\mathbf{e}}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The rotation vector is in some contexts useful, as it represents a three-dimensional rotation with only three [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] values (its components), representing the three degrees of freedom. This is also true for representations based on sequences of three Euler angles (see below).

If the rotation angle {{mvar|θ}} is zero, the axis is not uniquely defined. Combining two successive rotations, each represented by an Euler axis and angle, is not straightforward, and in fact does not satisfy the law of vector addition, which shows that finite rotations are not really vectors at all. It is best to employ the rotation matrix or quaternion notation, calculate the product, and then convert back to Euler axis and angle.

===Euler rotations===
[[Image:Praezession.svg|thumb|170px|Euler rotations of the Earth. [[Earth's rotation|Intrinsic]] (green), [[Axial precession|precession]] (blue) and [[nutation]] (red)]]
{{Main article|Euler rotations}}
The idea behind Euler rotations is to split the complete rotation of the coordinate system into three simpler constitutive rotations, called [[precession]], [[nutation]], and [[rotation|intrinsic rotation]], being each one of them an increment on one of the [[Euler angles]]. Notice that the outer matrix will represent a rotation around one of the axes of the reference frame, and the inner matrix represents a rotation around one of the moving frame axes. The middle matrix represents a rotation around an intermediate axis called '''line of nodes'''.

However, the definition of Euler angles is not unique and in the literature many different conventions are used. These conventions depend on the axes about which the rotations are carried out, and their sequence (since rotations are not [[commutativity|commutative]]).

The convention being used is usually indicated by specifying the axes about which the consecutive rotations (before being composed) take place, referring to them by index {{nowrap|(1, 2, 3)}} or letter {{nowrap|(X, Y, Z)}}. The engineering and robotics communities typically use 3-1-3 Euler angles. Notice that after composing the independent rotations, they do not rotate about their axis anymore. The most external matrix rotates the other two, leaving the second rotation matrix over the line of nodes, and the third one in a frame comoving with the body. There are {{nowrap|3 × 3 × 3 {{=}} 27}} possible combinations of three basic rotations but only {{nowrap|3 × 2 × 2 {{=}} 12}} of them can be used for representing arbitrary 3D rotations as Euler angles. These 12&amp;nbsp;combinations avoid consecutive rotations around the same axis (such as XXY) which would reduce the degrees of freedom that can be represented.

Therefore, Euler angles are never expressed in terms of the external frame, or in terms of the co-moving rotated body frame, but in a mixture. Other conventions (e.g., [[rotation matrix]] or [[Quaternions and spatial rotation|quaternions]]) are used to avoid this problem.

In [[aviation]] orientation of the aircraft is usually expressed as [[Euler angles#Intrinsic rotations|intrinsic]] [[Euler angles#Tait.E2.80.93Bryan angles|Tait-Bryan angles]] following the {{math|''z''-''y''′-''x''″}} convention, which are called [[Course (navigation)#Aircraft heading|'''''heading''''']], [[Elevation (ballistics)|'''''elevation''''']], and [[Banked turn|'''''bank''''']] (or synonymously, [[Yaw (rotation)|'''''yaw''''']], [[Pitching moment|'''''pitch''''']], and '''''roll''''').

===Quaternions===
{{Main article|Quaternions and spatial rotation}}

[[Quaternion]]s, that form a four-dimensional [[vector space]], have proven very useful in representing rotations due to several advantages above the other representations mentioned in this article.

A quaternion representation of rotation is written as a [[versor]] (normalized quaternion)
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{q}} =q_i\mathbf{i}+q_j\mathbf{j}+q_k\mathbf{k}+q_r = \begin{bmatrix} q_i \\ q_j \\ q_k \\ q_r \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The above definition stores quaternion as an array following the convention used in (Wertz 1980) and (Markley 2003). An alternative definition used for example in (Coutsias 1999) and (Schmidt 2001) defines the "scalar" term as the first quaternion element, with the other elements shifted down one position.

In terms of the Euler axis 
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{e}} = \begin{bmatrix} e_x \\ e_y \\ e_z \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

and angle {{mvar|θ}} this versor's components are expressed as follows: 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 q_i &amp;= e_x\sin\frac{\theta}{2}\\
 q_j &amp;= e_y\sin\frac{\theta}{2}\\
 q_k &amp;= e_z\sin\frac{\theta}{2}\\
 q_r &amp;= \cos\frac{\theta}{2}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Inspection shows that the quaternion parametrization obeys the following constraint:
:&lt;math&gt;q_i^2 + q_j^2 + q_k^2 + q_r^2 = 1&lt;/math&gt;

The last term (in our definition) is often called the scalar term, which has its origin in quaternions when understood as the mathematical extension of the complex numbers, written as 
:&lt;math&gt;a + b i + c j + d k \qquad \text{with } \{a, b, c, d\} \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

and where {{math|{''i'', ''j'', ''k''&lt;nowiki&gt;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} are the [[hypercomplex number]]s satisfying
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{ccccccc}
 i^2 &amp;=&amp; j^2 &amp;=&amp; k^2 &amp;=&amp; -1\\
  ij &amp;=&amp; -ji &amp;=&amp; k&amp;&amp;\\
  jk &amp;=&amp; -kj &amp;=&amp; i&amp;&amp;\\
  ki &amp;=&amp; -ik &amp;=&amp; j&amp;&amp;
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

Quaternion multiplication, that is used to specify a [[function composition|composite]] rotation, is performed in the same manner as multiplication of [[complex numbers]], except that the order of elements must be taken into account, since multiplication is not commutative. In matrix notation we can write quaternion multiplication as
:&lt;math&gt;
\tilde{\mathbf{q}}\otimes\mathbf{q} =
\begin{bmatrix}
   \;\;\, q_r &amp; \;\;\, q_k &amp; -q_j &amp; \;\;\, q_i\\
   -q_k &amp; \;\;\, q_r &amp; \;\;\, q_i &amp; \;\;\, q_j\\
   \;\;\, q_j &amp; -q_i &amp; \;\;\, q_r &amp; \;\;\, q_k\\
   -q_i &amp; -q_j &amp; -q_k &amp; \;\;\, q_r
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
   \tilde{q}_i\\
   \tilde{q}_j\\
   \tilde{q}_k\\
   \tilde{q}_r
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
   \;\;\, \tilde{q}_r &amp; -\tilde{q}_k &amp; \;\;\, \tilde{q}_j &amp; \;\;\, \tilde{q}_i\\
   \;\;\, \tilde{q}_k &amp; \;\;\, \tilde{q}_r &amp; -\tilde{q}_i &amp; \;\;\, \tilde{q}_j\\
   -\tilde{q}_j &amp; \;\;\, \tilde{q}_i &amp; \;\;\, \tilde{q}_r &amp; \;\;\, \tilde{q}_k\\
   -\tilde{q}_i &amp; -\tilde{q}_j &amp; -\tilde{q}_k &amp; \;\;\, \tilde{q}_r
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
   q_i\\
   q_j\\
   q_k\\
   q_r
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Combining two consecutive quaternion rotations is therefore just as simple as using the rotation matrix. Remember that two successive rotation matrices, {{math|'''A'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} followed by {{math|'''A'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, are combined as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}_3 = \mathbf{A}_2\mathbf{A}_1&lt;/math&gt;

We can represent this with quaternion parameters in a similarly concise way:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q}_3 = \mathbf{q}_2 \otimes \mathbf{q}_1&lt;/math&gt;

Quaternions are a very popular parametrization due to the following properties:
*More compact than the matrix representation and less susceptible to [[round-off error]]s
*The quaternion elements vary continuously over the unit sphere in {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}}, (denoted by {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}) as the orientation changes, avoiding [[classification of discontinuities|discontinuous]] jumps (inherent to three-dimensional parameterizations)
*Expression of the rotation matrix in terms of quaternion parameters involves no [[trigonometric function]]s
*It is simple to combine two individual rotations represented as quaternions using a quaternion product

Like rotation matrices, quaternions must sometimes be renormalized due to rounding errors, to make sure that they correspond to valid rotations. The computational cost of renormalizing a quaternion, however, is much less than for normalizing a {{nowrap|3 × 3}} matrix.

Quaternions also capture the spinorial character of rotations in three dimensions. For a three-dimensional object connected to its (fixed) surroundings by slack strings or bands, the strings or bands can be untangled after ''two'' complete turns about some fixed axis from an initial untangled state. Algebraically, the quaternion describing such a rotation changes from a scalar +1 (initially), through (scalar + pseudovector) values to scalar −1 (at one full turn), through (scalar + pseudovector) values back to scalar +1 (at two full turns). This cycle repeats every 2 turns. After {{math|2''n''}} turns (integer {{math|''n'' &gt; 0}}), without any intermediate untangling attempts, the strings/bands can be partially untangled back to the {{math|2(''n'' − 1)}} turns state with each application of the same procedure used in untangling from 2 turns to 0 turns. Applying the same procedure {{math|''n''}} times will take a {{math|2''n''}}-tangled object back to the untangled or 0 turn state. The untangling process also removes any rotation-generated twisting about the strings/bands themselves. Simple 3D mechanical models can be used to demonstrate these facts.

===Rodrigues parameters and Gibbs representation===
{{main article|Euler–Rodrigues parameters}}
{{See also|Rodrigues' rotation formula}}
Rodrigues parameters&lt;ref&gt;[[Olinde Rodrigues]], "Des lois géometriques qui regissent les déplacements d' un systéme solide dans l' espace, et de la variation des coordonnées provenant de ces déplacement considérées indépendant des causes qui peuvent les produire", ''J. Math. Pures Appl.'' '''5''' (1840), 380–440&lt;/ref&gt; can be expressed in terms of Euler axis and angle as follows,&lt;ref&gt;cf. J Willard Gibbs (1884). ''Elements of Vector Analysis'', New Haven,  p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} = \hat{\mathbf{e}}\theta \,.&lt;/math&gt;

This has a discontinuity at 180° ({{pi}} radians): each vector, {{math|'''r'''}}, with a norm of {{pi}} radians represent the same rotation as {{math|−'''r'''}}.

Similarly, the Gibbs representation can be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{g} = \hat{\mathbf{e}}\tan\frac{\theta}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
A rotation {{math|'''g'''}} followed by a rotation {{math|'''f'''}} in the Gibbs representation has the simple form
:&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{g},\mathbf{f}) = \frac{\mathbf{g}+\mathbf{f}-\mathbf{f}\times\mathbf{g}}{1-\mathbf{g}\cdot\mathbf{f}} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Today, the most straightforward way to prove this formula is in the (faithful) [[Pauli matrices#The group composition law of SU(2)|doublet representation]], where {{math|'''g''' {{=}} '''n̂''' tan ''a''}}, etc.  

Another way to prove this equation is to use [[quaternion]]s.  Construct a quaternion associated with a spatial rotation R as,
:&lt;math&gt; S = \cos\frac{\phi}{2} + \sin\frac{\phi}{2} \mathbf{S}. &lt;/math&gt;
Then the composition of the rotation R&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; with R&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is the rotation R&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;=R&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; with rotation axis and angle defined by the product of the quaternions
:&lt;math&gt;A=\cos\frac{\alpha}{2}+ \sin\frac{\alpha}{2}\mathbf{A}\quad
\text{and}\quad B=\cos\frac{\beta}{2}+ \sin\frac{\beta}{2}\mathbf{B},&lt;/math&gt;
that is
:&lt;math&gt; C  = \cos\frac{\gamma}{2}+\sin\frac{\gamma}{2}\mathbf{C}
=
\Big(\cos\frac{\beta}{2}+\sin\frac{\beta}{2}\mathbf{B}\Big) \Big(\cos\frac{\alpha}{2}+
\sin\frac{\alpha}{2}\mathbf{A}\Big).
&lt;/math&gt;

Expand this quaternion product to obtain
:&lt;math&gt;
\cos\frac{\gamma}{2}+\sin\frac{\gamma}{2} \mathbf{C}  =
\Big(\cos\frac{\beta}{2}\cos\frac{\alpha}{2} - 
\sin\frac{\beta}{2}\sin\frac{\alpha}{2} \mathbf{B}\cdot \mathbf{A}\Big)  +  \Big(\sin\frac{\beta}{2}\cos\frac{\alpha}{2} \mathbf{B} + 
\sin\frac{\alpha}{2}\cos\frac{\beta}{2} \mathbf{A} + 
\sin\frac{\beta}{2}\sin\frac{\alpha}{2} \mathbf{B}\times \mathbf{A}\Big).
&lt;/math&gt;

Divide both sides of this equation by the identity,
:&lt;math&gt; \cos\frac{\gamma}{2} = \cos\frac{\beta}{2}\cos\frac{\alpha}{2} - 
\sin\frac{\beta}{2}\sin\frac{\alpha}{2} \mathbf{B}\cdot \mathbf{A},&lt;/math&gt;
and compute
:&lt;math&gt; \tan\frac{\gamma}{2} \mathbf{C}  = \frac{\tan\frac{\beta}{2}\mathbf{B} + 
\tan\frac{\alpha}{2} \mathbf{A} + 
\tan\frac{\beta}{2}\tan\frac{\alpha}{2} \mathbf{B}\times \mathbf{A}}{1 - 
\tan\frac{\beta}{2}\tan\frac{\alpha}{2} \mathbf{B}\cdot \mathbf{A}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

This is Rodrigues formula for the axis of a composite rotation defined in terms of the axes of the two rotations.  He derived this formula in 1840 (see page 408).&lt;ref&gt;Rodrigues, O. (1840), Des lois géométriques qui régissent les déplacements d’un système solide dans l’espace, et la variation des coordonnées provenant de ses déplacements con- sidérés indépendamment des causes qui peuvent les produire, Journal de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées de Liouville 5, 380–440.&lt;/ref&gt;

The three rotation axes '''A''', '''B''', and '''C''' form a spherical triangle and the dihedral angles between the planes formed by the sides of this triangle are defined by the rotation angles.


The '''Gibbs vector''' has the advantage (or disadvantage, depending on context) that 180° rotations cannot be represented in it. (Even using [[floating point]] numbers that include infinity, rotation direction cannot be well-defined; for example, naively, a 180° rotation about the axis (1, 1, 0) would be (∞, ∞, 0), which is the same representation as 180° rotation about (1, 0.0001, 0).)

Modified Rodrigues parameters (MRPs) can be expressed in terms of Euler axis and angle by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} = \hat{\mathbf{e}}\tan\frac{\theta}{4}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The modified Rodrigues parameterization shares many characteristics with the rotation vector parametrization, including the occurrence of discontinuous jumps in the parameter space when incrementing the rotation.

===Rotation matrix ↔ Euler angles===
The Euler angles {{math|(''φ'', ''θ'', ''ψ'')}} can be extracted from the rotation matrix &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; by inspecting the rotation matrix in analytical form.

====Rotation matrix → Euler angles ({{math|''z''-''x''-''z''}} extrinsic) ====
Using the {{mvar|x}}-convention, the 3-1-3 [[Euler angles#Extrinsic rotations|extrinsic]] Euler angles {{mvar|φ}}, {{mvar|θ}} and {{mvar|ψ}} (around the {{mvar|z}}-axis, {{mvar|x}}-axis and again the &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Z&lt;/math&gt;-axis) can be obtained as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align} 
 \phi   &amp;=  \operatorname{atan2}\left(A_{31}, A_{32}\right)\\
 \theta &amp;=  \arccos\left(A_{33}\right)\\
 \psi   &amp;= -\operatorname{atan2}\left(A_{13}, A_{23}\right)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that {{math|atan2(''a'', ''b'')}} is equivalent to {{math|arctan {{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}} where it also takes into account the [[Cartesian coordinate system#Cartesian coordinates in two dimensions|quadrant]] that the point {{math|(''a'', ''b'')}} is in; see [[atan2]].

When implementing the conversion, one has to take into account several situations:&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/cmp/courses/ROB/roblec/serial-noteeng.pdf Direct and inverse kinematics] lecture notes, page 5&lt;/ref&gt;
* There are generally two solutions in the interval {{math|[−π, π]&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The above formula works only when {{math|θ}} is within the interval {{math|[0, π]}}.
* For the special case {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;33&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}}, {{mvar|φ}} and {{mvar|ψ}} will be derived from {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;}}.
* There are infinitely many but countably many solutions outside of the interval {{math|[−π, π]&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.
* Whether all mathematical solutions apply for a given application depends on the situation.

==== Euler angles ({{math|''z''-''y''′-''x''″}} intrinsic) → rotation matrix ====
The rotation matrix {{math|'''A'''}} is generated from the 3-2-1 [[Euler angles#Intrinsic rotations|intrinsic]] Euler angles by multiplying the three matrices generated by rotations about the axes. 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{A}_3\mathbf{A}_2\mathbf{A}_1 = \mathbf{A}_Z\mathbf{A}_Y\mathbf{A}_X&lt;/math&gt;

The axes of the rotation depend on the specific convention being used. For the {{mvar|x}}-convention the rotations are about the {{mvar|x}}-, {{mvar|y}}- and {{mvar|z}}-axes with angles {{mvar|φ}}, {{mvar|θ}} and {{mvar|ψ}}, the individual matrices are as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \mathbf{A}_X &amp;= \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; \cos\phi &amp; -\sin\phi\\ 0 &amp; \sin\phi &amp; \cos\phi \end{bmatrix} \\[5px]
 \mathbf{A}_Y &amp;= \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta &amp; 0 &amp; \sin\theta\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\ -\sin\theta &amp; 0 &amp; \cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \\[5px]
 \mathbf{A}_Z &amp;= \begin{bmatrix} \cos\psi &amp; -\sin\psi &amp; 0\\ \sin\psi &amp; \cos\psi &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This yields
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix}
  \cos\theta \cos\psi &amp;  -\cos\phi \sin\psi + \sin\phi \sin\theta \cos\psi &amp;   \sin\phi \sin\psi + \cos\phi \sin\theta \cos\psi \\
  \cos\theta\sin\psi &amp;  \cos\phi \cos\psi + \sin\phi \sin\theta \sin\psi &amp;  - \sin\phi \cos\psi + \cos\phi \sin\theta \sin\psi \\
  -\sin\theta             &amp;  \sin\phi \cos\theta                                          &amp;   \cos\phi \cos\theta \\
 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
Note: This is valid for a [[Right-hand rule|right-hand]] system, which is the convention used in almost all engineering and physics disciplines.

The interpretation of these right-handed rotation matrices is that they express coordinate transformations ([[Active_and_passive_transformation#Passive_transformation|passive]]) as opposed to point transformations ([[Active_and_passive_transformation#Passive_transformation|active]]). Because {{math|'''A'''}} expresses a rotation from the local frame {{math|'''1'''}} to the global frame {{math|'''0'''}} (i.e., {{math|'''A'''}} encodes the axes of frame {{math|'''1'''}} w.r.t frame {{math|'''0'''}}), the elementary rotation matrices are composed as above. Because the inverse rotation is just the rotation transposed, if we wanted the global-to-local rotation from frame {{math|'''0'''}} to frame {{math|'''1'''}}, we would write &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}^\top = (\mathbf{A}_Z\mathbf{A}_Y\mathbf{A}_X)^\top = \mathbf{A}_X^\top\mathbf{A}_Y^\top\mathbf{A}_Z^\top&lt;/math&gt;.

===Rotation matrix ↔ Euler axis/angle===
 
If the Euler angle {{mvar|θ}} is not a multiple of {{pi}}, the Euler axis {{math|'''ê'''}} and angle {{mvar|θ}} can be computed from the elements of the rotation matrix {{math|A}} as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \theta &amp;= \arccos\frac{A_{11}+A_{22}+A_{33}-1}{2}\\
    e_1 &amp;= \frac{A_{32}-A_{23}}{2\sin\theta}\\
    e_2 &amp;= \frac{A_{13}-A_{31}}{2\sin\theta}\\
    e_3 &amp;= \frac{A_{21}-A_{12}}{2\sin\theta}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, the following method can be used:

Eigendecomposition of the rotation matrix yields the eigenvalues 1 and {{math|cos ''θ'' ± ''i'' sin ''θ''}}. The Euler axis is the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue of 1, and {{mvar|θ}} can be computed from the remaining eigenvalues.

The Euler axis can be also found using singular value decomposition since it is the normalized vector spanning the null-space of the matrix {{math|'''I''' − '''A'''}}.

To convert the other way the rotation matrix corresponding to an Euler axis {{math|'''ê'''}} and angle {{mvar|θ}} can be computed according to [[Rodrigues' rotation formula]] (with appropriate modification&lt;!-- the article referenced describes an active rotation whereas this article describes a passive rotation, thus the sign difference --&gt;) as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{I}_3\cos\theta + (1-\cos\theta)\hat{\mathbf{e}}\hat{\mathbf{e}}^\mathsf{T} + \left[\hat{\mathbf{e}}\right]_{\times} \sin\theta&lt;/math&gt;

with {{math|'''I'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} the {{nowrap|3 × 3}} [[identity matrix]], and
:&lt;math&gt;\left[\hat{\mathbf{e}}\right]_{\times} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; -e_3 &amp; e_2\\ e_3 &amp; 0 &amp; -e_1\\ -e_2 &amp; e_1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

is the [[Cross product#Conversion to matrix multiplication|cross-product matrix]].

This expands to:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
A_{11} &amp;= (1-\cos\theta) e_1^2 + \cos\theta \\
A_{12} &amp;= (1-\cos\theta) e_1 e_2 - e_3 \sin\theta \\
A_{13} &amp;= (1-\cos\theta) e_1 e_3 + e_2 \sin\theta \\
A_{21} &amp;= (1-\cos\theta) e_2 e_1 + e_3 \sin\theta \\
A_{22} &amp;= (1-\cos\theta) e_2^2 + \cos\theta \\
A_{23} &amp;= (1-\cos\theta) e_2 e_3 - e_1 \sin\theta \\
A_{31} &amp;= (1-\cos\theta) e_3 e_1 - e_2 \sin\theta \\
A_{32} &amp;= (1-\cos\theta) e_3 e_2 + e_1 \sin\theta \\
A_{33} &amp;= (1-\cos\theta) e_3^2 + \cos\theta
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

{{see also|Rotation matrix#Rotation matrix from axis and angle}}

===Rotation matrix ↔ quaternion===
When computing a quaternion from the rotation matrix there is a sign ambiguity, since {{math|'''q'''}} and {{math|−'''q'''}} represent the same rotation.

One way of computing the quaternion
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q} = \begin{bmatrix} q_i \\ q_j \\ q_k \\ q_r \end{bmatrix} = q_i\mathbf{i}+q_j\mathbf{j}+q_k\mathbf{k}+q_r&lt;/math&gt;
from the rotation matrix {{math|'''A'''}} is as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
 q_r &amp;= \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{1+A_{11}+A_{22}+A_{33}}\\
 q_i &amp;= \frac{1}{4q_r}\left(A_{32}- A_{23}\right)\\
 q_j &amp;= \frac{1}{4q_r}\left(A_{13}- A_{31}\right)\\
 q_k &amp;= \frac{1}{4q_r}\left(A_{21}- A_{12}\right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

There are three other mathematically equivalent ways to compute {{math|'''q'''}}. Numerical inaccuracy can be reduced by avoiding situations in which the denominator is close to zero. One of the other three methods looks as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last = Mebius|first = Johan|arxiv = math/0701759|title = Derivation of the Euler–Rodrigues formula for three-dimensional rotations from the general formula for four-dimensional rotations| year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
 q_i &amp;= \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{1 + A_{11} - A_{22} - A_{33}}\\
 q_j &amp;= \frac{1}{4q_i}\left(A_{12} + A_{21}\right)\\
 q_k &amp;= \frac{1}{4q_i}\left(A_{13} + A_{31}\right)\\
 q_r &amp;= \frac{1}{4q_i}\left(A_{32} - A_{23}\right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The rotation matrix corresponding to the quaternion {{math|'''q'''}} can be computed as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = \left(q_r^2 - \check{\mathbf{q}}^\mathsf{T}\check{\mathbf{q}}\right)\mathbf{I}_3 + 2\check{\mathbf{q}}\check{\mathbf{q}}^\mathrm{T} + 2q_r\mathbf{\mathcal{Q}}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;\check{\mathbf{q}} = \begin{bmatrix} q_i\\q_j\\q_k\end{bmatrix} \,, \quad \mathbf{\mathcal{Q}} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; -q_k &amp; q_j\\ q_k &amp; 0 &amp; -q_i\\ -q_j &amp; q_i &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

which gives
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix}

or equivalently
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix}
 -1 + 2q_i^2 + 2q_r^2 &amp; 2\left(q_iq_j - q_kq_r\right)   &amp; 2\left(q_iq_k + q_jq_r\right)\\

\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

===Euler angles ↔ quaternion===
{{main article|Conversion between quaternions and Euler angles}}

==== Euler angles ({{math|''z''-''x''-''z''}} extrinsic) → quaternion ====
We will consider the {{mvar|x}}-convention 3-1-3 [[Euler angles#Extrinsic rotations|extrinsic Euler angles]] for the following algorithm. The terms of the algorithm depend on the convention used.

We can compute the quaternion
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q} = \begin{bmatrix} q_i \\ q_j \\ q_k \\ q_r \end{bmatrix} = q_i\mathbf{i}+q_j\mathbf{j}+q_k\mathbf{k}+q_r&lt;/math&gt;
from the Euler angles {{math|(''φ'', ''θ'', ''ψ'')}} as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 q_i &amp;= \cos\frac{\phi - \psi}{2}\sin\frac{\theta}{2}\\
 q_j &amp;= \sin\frac{\phi - \psi}{2}\sin\frac{\theta}{2}\\
 q_k &amp;= \sin\frac{\phi + \psi}{2}\cos\frac{\theta}{2}\\
 q_r &amp;= \cos\frac{\phi + \psi}{2}\cos\frac{\theta}{2}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==== Euler angles ({{math|''z''-''y''′-''x''″}} intrinsic) → quaternion ====
A quaternion equivalent to [[Yaw (rotation)|yaw]] ({{mvar|ψ}}), [[Pitching moment|pitch]] ({{mvar|θ}}) and roll ({{mvar|φ}}) angles. or [[Euler angles#Intrinsic rotations|intrinsic]] [[Euler angles#Tait.E2.80.93Bryan angles|Tait–Bryan angles]] following the {{math|''z''-''y''′-''x''″}} convention, can be computed by

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 q_i &amp;= \sin \frac{\phi}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\psi}{2} -  \cos \frac{\phi}{2} \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \sin \frac{\psi}{2}\\
 q_j &amp;= \cos \frac{\phi}{2} \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\psi}{2} +  \sin \frac{\phi}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2} \sin \frac{\psi}{2}\\
 q_k &amp;= \cos \frac{\phi}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2} \sin \frac{\psi}{2} -  \sin \frac{\phi}{2} \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\psi}{2}\\
 q_r &amp;= \cos \frac{\phi}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\psi}{2} +  \sin \frac{\phi}{2} \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \sin \frac{\psi}{2}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

==== Quaternion → Euler angles ({{math|''z''-''x''-''z''}} extrinsic) ====
Given the rotation quaternion
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q} = \begin{bmatrix} q_i \\ q_j \\ q_k \\ q_r \end{bmatrix} = q_i\mathbf{i}+q_j\mathbf{j}+q_k\mathbf{k}+q_r \,,&lt;/math&gt;
the {{mvar|x}}-convention 3-1-3 [[Euler angles#Extrinsic rotations|extrinsic Euler Angles]] {{math|(''φ'', ''θ'', ''ψ'')}} can be computed by

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 \phi   &amp;=  \operatorname{atan2}\left(\left(q_iq_k + q_jq_r\right), -\left(q_jq_k - q_iq_r\right)\right)\\
 \theta &amp;=  \arccos\left(-q_i^2 - q_j^2 + q_k^2+q_r^2\right)\\
 \psi   &amp;= \operatorname{atan2}\left(\left(q_iq_k - q_jq_r\right), \left(q_jq_k + q_iq_r\right)\right)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

==== Quaternion → Euler angles ({{math|''z''-''y''′-''x''″}} intrinsic) ====
Given the rotation quaternion
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q} = \begin{bmatrix} q_i \\ q_j \\ q_k \\ q_r \end{bmatrix} = q_i\mathbf{i}+q_j\mathbf{j}+q_k\mathbf{k}+q_r \,,&lt;/math&gt;
[[Yaw (rotation)|yaw]], [[Pitching moment|pitch]] and roll angles, or [[Euler angles#Intrinsic rotations|intrinsic]] [[Euler angles#Tait.E2.80.93Bryan angles|Tait–Bryan angles]] following the {{math|''z''-''y''′-''x''″}} convention, can be computed by

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\text{roll}   &amp;= \operatorname{atan2} \left(2\left(q_r q_i + q_j q_k\right),1 - 2\left(q_i^2 + q_j^2\right)\right) \\
\text{pitch} &amp;= \arcsin \left(2\left(q_r q_j - q_k q_i\right)\right) \\
\text{yaw}  &amp;= \operatorname{atan2} \left(2\left(q_r q_k + q_i q_j\right),1 - 2\left(q_j^2 + q_k^2\right)\right)
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

===Euler axis–angle ↔ quaternion===
Given the Euler axis {{math|'''ê'''}} and angle {{mvar|θ}}, the quaternion
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q} = \begin{bmatrix} q_i \\ q_j \\ q_k \\ q_r \end{bmatrix} = q_i\mathbf{i}+q_j\mathbf{j}+q_k\mathbf{k}+q_r \,,&lt;/math&gt;

can be computed by
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 q_i &amp;= \hat{e}_1\sin\frac{\theta}{2} \\
 q_j &amp;= \hat{e}_2\sin\frac{\theta}{2} \\
 q_k &amp;= \hat{e}_3\sin\frac{\theta}{2} \\
 q_r &amp;= \cos\frac{\theta}{2}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Given the rotation quaternion {{math|'''q'''}}, define
:&lt;math&gt;\check{\mathbf{q}} = \begin{bmatrix} q_i \\ q_j \\ q_k \end{bmatrix}\,.&lt;/math&gt;
Then the Euler axis {{math|'''ê'''}} and angle {{mvar|θ}} can be computed by
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \hat{\mathbf{e}} &amp;= \frac{\check{\mathbf{q}}}{\left\|\check{\mathbf{q}}\right\|} \\
 \theta &amp;= 2\arccos q_r
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Conversion formulae for derivatives==

===Rotation matrix ↔ angular velocities===
The angular velocity vector
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\omega} = \begin{bmatrix} \omega_x \\ \omega_y \\ \omega_z \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
can be extracted from the [[time derivative]] of the rotation matrix {{math|{{sfrac|d'''A'''|d''t''}}}} by the following relation:
:&lt;math&gt;[\boldsymbol{\omega}]_\times = \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; -\omega_z &amp; \omega_y \\ \omega_z &amp; 0 &amp; -\omega_x \\ -\omega_y &amp; \omega_x &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}  = \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{A}}{\mathrm{d}t}\mathbf{A}^\mathsf{T}&lt;/math&gt;

The derivation is adapted from Ioffe&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euclideanspace.com/physics/kinematics/angularvelocity/mark.htm] Physics - Mark Ioffe - W(t) in terms of matrices&lt;/ref&gt; as follows:

For any vector {{math|'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, consider {{math|'''r'''(''t''){{=}}'''A'''(''t'')'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} and differentiate it:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{A}}{\mathrm{d}t} \mathbf{r}_0 = \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{A}}{\mathrm{d}t} \mathbf{A}^\mathsf{T}(t) \mathrm{r}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

The derivative of a vector is the [[Velocity vector|linear velocity]] of its tip. Since {{math|'''A'''}} is a rotation matrix, by definition the length of {{math|'''r'''(''t'')}} is always equal to the length of {{math|'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and hence it does not change with time. Thus, when {{math|'''r'''(''t'')}} rotates, its tip moves along a circle, and the linear velocity of its tip is tangential to the circle; i.e., always perpendicular to {{math|'''r'''(''t'')}}. In this specific case, the relationship between the linear velocity vector and the angular velocity vector is 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \boldsymbol{\omega}(t)\times \mathbf{r}(t) = [\boldsymbol{\omega}]_\times \mathbf{r}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
(see [[circular motion]] and [[Cross product#Conversion to matrix multiplication|cross product]]).

By the [[transitive relation|transitivity]] of the abovementioned equations,  
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{A}}{\mathrm{d}t} \mathbf{A}^\mathsf{T}(t) \mathbf{r}(t) = [\boldsymbol{\omega}]_\times \mathbf{r}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

which implies
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{A}}{\mathrm{d}t} \mathbf{A}^\mathsf{T}(t) = [\boldsymbol{\omega}]_\times&lt;/math&gt;

===Quaternion ↔ angular velocities===
The angular velocity vector
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\omega} = \begin{bmatrix} \omega_x \\ \omega_y \\ \omega_z \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
can be obtained from the derivative of the quaternion {{math|{{sfrac|d'''q'''|d''t''}}}} as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.cs.iastate.edu/~cs577/handouts/quaternion.pdf Quaternions and Rotation] lecture notes, p. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix}
   0 \\
   \omega_x \\
   \omega_y \\
   \omega_z 
\end{bmatrix} = 2 \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{q}}{\mathrm{d}t}\tilde{\mathbf{q}}
&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|'''q̃'''}} is the inverse of {{math|'''q'''}}.

Conversely, the derivative of the quaternion is
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{q}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{1}{2}\begin{bmatrix}
   0 \\
   \omega_x \\
   \omega_y \\
   \omega_z
\end{bmatrix}\mathbf{q} \,.
&lt;/math&gt;

==Rotors in a geometric algebra==
The formalism of [[geometric algebra]] (GA) provides an extension and interpretation of the quaternion method. Central to GA is the geometric product of vectors, an extension of the traditional [[inner product|inner]] and [[cross product]]s, given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{ab} = \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{a} \wedge \mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt;

where the symbol {{math|∧}} denotes the [[exterior algebra|exterior product or wedge product]]. This product of vectors {{math|'''a'''}}, and {{math|'''b'''}} produces two terms: a scalar part from the inner product and a [[bivector]] part from the wedge product. This bivector describes the plane perpendicular to what the cross product of the vectors would return.

Bivectors in GA have some unusual properties compared to vectors. Under the geometric product, bivectors have a negative square: the bivector {{math|'''x̂ŷ'''}} describes the {{mvar|xy}}-plane. Its square is {{math|('''x̂ŷ''')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} '''x̂ŷx̂ŷ'''}}. Because the unit basis vectors are orthogonal to each other, the geometric product reduces to the antisymmetric outer product – {{math|'''x̂'''}} and {{math|'''ŷ'''}} can be swapped freely at the cost of a factor of&amp;nbsp;−1. The square reduces to {{math|−'''x̂x̂ŷŷ''' {{=}} −1}} since the basis vectors themselves square to +1.

This result holds generally for all bivectors, and as a result the bivector plays a role similar to the [[imaginary unit]]. Geometric algebra uses bivectors in its analogue to the quaternion, the ''rotor'', given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R} = \exp\left(\frac{-\hat\mathbf{B}\theta}{2}\right) = \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - \hat\mathbf{B} \sin \frac{\theta}{2}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|'''B̂'''}} is a unit bivector that describes the [[plane of rotation]]. Because {{math|'''B̂'''}} squares to −1, the [[power series]] expansion of {{math|'''R'''}} generates the [[trigonometric function]]s. The rotation formula that maps a vector {{math|'''a'''}} to a rotated vector {{math|'''b'''}} is then
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b} = \mathbf{R a R}^\dagger&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^\dagger = \exp\left(\frac{1}{2}\hat\mathbf{B} \theta\right) = \cos \frac{\theta}{2} + \hat\mathbf{B} \sin \frac{\theta}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
is the ''reverse'' of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R&lt;/math&gt; (reversing the order of the vectors in &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle B&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to changing its sign).

'''Example.'''  A rotation about the axis
:&lt;math&gt;\hat \mathbf{v} = \frac{1}{\sqrt 3}\left(\hat \mathbf{x} + \hat \mathbf{y} + \hat \mathbf{z}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
can be accomplished by converting {{math|'''v̂'''}} to its dual bivector,
:&lt;math&gt;\hat \mathbf{B} = \hat \mathbf{x} \hat \mathbf{y} \hat \mathbf{z} \hat \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{i} \hat \mathbf{v} \,,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|'''i''' {{=}} '''x̂ŷẑ'''}} is the unit volume element, the only trivector (pseudoscalar) in three-dimensional space. The result is
:&lt;math&gt;\hat \mathbf{B} = \frac{1}{\sqrt 3}\left(\hat \mathbf{y} \hat \mathbf{z} + \hat \mathbf{z} \hat \mathbf{x} + \hat \mathbf{x} \hat \mathbf{y}\right) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

In three-dimensional space, however, it is often simpler to leave the expression for {{math|'''B̂''' {{=}} '''iv̂'''}}, using the fact that {{math|'''i'''}} commutes with all objects in 3D and also squares to −1. A rotation of the {{math|'''x̂'''}} vector in this plane by an angle {{mvar|θ}} is then

:&lt;math&gt;\hat \mathbf{x}' = \mathbf{R} \hat \mathbf{x} \mathbf{R}^\dagger = e^{-\mathbf{i}\hat \mathbf{v} \frac{\theta}{2}} \hat \mathbf{x} e^{i \hat \mathbf{v} \frac{\theta}{2}} = \hat \mathbf{x} \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2} + \mathbf{i} \left(\hat \mathbf{x} \hat \mathbf{v} - \hat \mathbf{v} \hat \mathbf{x}\right) \cos \frac{\theta}{2} \sin \frac{\theta}{2} + \hat \mathbf{v} \hat \mathbf{x} \hat \mathbf{v} \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

Recognizing that
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{i} (\hat \mathbf{x} \hat \mathbf{v} - \hat \mathbf{v} \hat \mathbf{x}) = 2\mathbf{i} (\hat \mathbf{x} \wedge \hat \mathbf{v})&lt;/math&gt;
and that {{math|−'''v̂x̂v̂'''}} is the reflection of {{math|'''x̂'''}} about the plane perpendicular to  {{math|'''v̂'''}} gives a geometric interpretation to the rotation operation:  the rotation preserves the components that are parallel to  {{math|'''v̂'''}} and changes only those that are perpendicular. The terms are then computed:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \hat \mathbf{v} \hat \mathbf{x} \hat \mathbf{v}    &amp;= \frac{1}{3} \left(-\hat \mathbf{x} + 2 \hat \mathbf{y} + 2 \hat \mathbf{z}\right) \\
 2\mathbf{i} \hat \mathbf{x} \wedge \hat \mathbf{v} &amp;= 2\mathbf{i} \frac{1}{\sqrt 3} \left(\hat \mathbf{x} \hat \mathbf{y} + \hat \mathbf{x} \hat \mathbf{z}\right) = \frac{2}{\sqrt 3} \left(\hat \mathbf{y} - \hat \mathbf{z}\right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The result of the rotation is then
:&lt;math&gt;\hat \mathbf{x}' = \hat \mathbf{x} \left(\cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2} - \frac{1}{3} \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2}\right) + \frac{2}{3} \hat \mathbf{y} \sin \frac{\theta}{2}  \left(\sin \frac{\theta}{2} + \sqrt{3} \cos \frac{\theta}{2}\right)  + \frac{2}{3} \hat \mathbf{z} \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \left(\sin \frac{\theta}{2} - \sqrt{3} \cos \frac{\theta}{2}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

A simple check on this result is the angle {{math|''θ'' {{=}} {{sfrac|2|3}}π}}. Such a rotation should map {{math|'''x̂'''}} to {{math|'''ŷ'''}}. Indeed, the rotation reduces to
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \hat \mathbf{x}' &amp;= \hat \mathbf{x}\left(\frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{3} \frac{3}{4}\right) + \frac{2}{3} \hat \mathbf{y} \frac{\sqrt 3}{2} \left(\frac{\sqrt 3}{2} + \sqrt{3}\frac{1}{2}\right) + \frac{2}{3} \hat \mathbf{z} \frac{\sqrt 3}{2} \left(\frac{\sqrt 3}{2} - \sqrt{3}\frac{1}{2}\right) \\
                   &amp;= 0 \hat \mathbf{x} + \hat \mathbf{y} + 0 \hat \mathbf{z} = \hat \mathbf{y}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

exactly as expected. This rotation formula is valid not only for vectors but for any [[multivector]]. In addition, when Euler angles are used, the complexity of the operation is much reduced. Compounded rotations come from multiplying the rotors, so the total rotor from Euler angles is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R} = \mathbf{R}_{\gamma'} \mathbf{R}_{\beta'} \mathbf{R}_\alpha = \exp\left(\frac{-\mathbf{i} \hat \mathbf{z}' \gamma}{2}\right) \exp\left(\frac{-\mathbf{i} \hat \mathbf{x}' \beta}{2}\right) \exp\left(\frac{-\mathbf{i} \hat \mathbf{z} \alpha}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

but
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\hat \mathbf{x}' &amp;= \mathbf{R}_\alpha \hat \mathbf{x} \mathbf{R}_\alpha^\dagger \quad \text{and} \\
\hat \mathbf{z}' &amp;= \mathbf{R}_{\beta'} \hat \mathbf{z} \mathbf{R}_{\beta'}^\dagger \,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
These rotors come back out of the exponentials like so:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}_{\beta'} = \cos \frac{\beta}{2} - \mathbf{i} \mathbf{R}_\alpha \hat \mathbf{x} \mathbf{R}_\alpha^\dagger \sin \frac{\beta}{2} = \mathbf{R}_\alpha \mathbf{R}_\beta \mathbf{R}_\alpha^\dagger&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''R'''&lt;sub&gt;''β''&lt;/sub&gt;}} refers to rotation in the original coordinates. Similarly for the {{mvar|γ}} rotation,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}_{\gamma'} = \mathbf{R}_{\beta'} \mathbf{R}_\gamma \mathbf{R}_{\beta'}^\dagger = \mathbf{R}_\alpha \mathbf{R}_\beta \mathbf{R}_\alpha^\dagger \mathbf{R}_\gamma \mathbf{R}_\alpha \mathbf{R}_\beta^\dagger \mathbf{R}_\alpha^\dagger \,.&lt;/math&gt;
Noting that {{math|'''R'''&lt;sub&gt;''γ''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|'''R'''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt;}} commute (rotations in the same plane must commute), and the total rotor becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R} = \mathbf{R}_\alpha \mathbf{R}_\beta \mathbf{R}_\gamma&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the compounded rotations of Euler angles become a series of equivalent rotations in the original fixed frame.

While rotors in geometric algebra work almost identically to quaternions in three dimensions, the power of this formalism is its generality:  this method is appropriate and valid in spaces with any number of dimensions. In 3D, rotations have three degrees of freedom, a degree for each linearly independent plane (bivector) the rotation can take place in. It has been known that pairs of quaternions can be used to generate rotations in 4D, yielding six degrees of freedom, and the geometric algebra approach verifies this result:  in 4D, there are six linearly independent bivectors that can be used as the generators of rotations.

'''Samuel Laing''', (12 December 1812 – 6 August 1897), was a British railway administrator, politician, and writer on science and religion during the [[Victorian era]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Samuel Laing was born on 12 December 1810 in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]]. He was the nephew of [[Malcolm Laing]], the historian of Scotland; and his father, also called [[Samuel Laing (travel writer)|Samuel Laing]] (1780–1868), was a well-known author, whose books on [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] attracted much attention. Samuel Laing the younger entered [[St John's College, Cambridge]] in 1827, and after graduating as [[Second Wrangler]] and [[Smith's Prize]]man, was elected a fellow.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=LN827S|name=Laing, Samuel}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained at Cambridge temporarily as a coach, before being called to the bar in 1837.

===Career===
He became private secretary to [[Henry Labouchere, 1st Baron Taunton|Henry Labouchere]], later 1st Baron Taunton, who was then the [[President of the Board of Trade]]. In 1842, he was made secretary to the railway department, and retained this post until 1847. He had by then become an authority on railways, and had been a member of the Dalhousie Railway Commission; it was at his suggestion that the "parliamentary" rate of a penny a mile was instituted. In 1848, he was appointed chairman and managing director of the [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway]] (LB&amp;SCR), and his business acumen showed itself in the largely increased prosperity of the line. He also became chairman (1852) of  [[The Crystal Palace]] [[Company]], but retired from both posts in 1855.

In 1852, he was elected to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] as a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] candidate in [[Wick Burghs (UK Parliament constituency)|Wick Burghs]]. After losing his seat in 1857, he was re-elected in 1859, and appointed [[Financial Secretary to the Treasury]]; in 1860 he was made [[finance minister]] in India. On returning from India, he was re-elected to parliament for Wick in 1865. He was defeated in 1868, but in 1873 he was returned for [[Orkney and Shetland (UK Parliament constituency)|Orkney and Shetland]], and retained his seat till 1885. Early in 1867 he was elected to the board of the [[Great Eastern Railway]] who by that point were sliding towards receivership. On July 1, the day before the GER went into receivership, he was reappointed chairman of the Brighton line, which was now on the point of bankruptcy following the over-ambitious expansion plans of the previous chairman. He continued in that post until 1896, and gradually restored the company to financial health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lbscr.demon.co.uk/people/chairmen.html |title=LB&amp;SCR Chairman |work=LB&amp;SCR Online |accessdate=25 April 2009 |last=Searle |first=David |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706131611/http://www.lbscr.demon.co.uk/people/chairmen.html |archivedate=6 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also chairman of the [[Railway]] [[Trust company|Debenture Trust]] and the [[Railway]] [[Trust company|Share Trust]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ashton|first1=Geoff|title=The Great Eastern Railway 1862-1865|journal=Great Eastern Journal|date=April 2013|volume=155|pp=36,37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although often claimed to have been the father of the novelist [[Mary Eliza Kennard]] (1850–1936),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198117605.001.0001/acref-9780198117605-e-665 Kennard, Mrs Edward: Mary Eliza Laing], OxfordReference.com, retrieved 22 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt; this is in dispute.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Blain, Patricia Clements, Isobel Grundy, ''The Feminist Companion to Literature in English'' (1990), p. 606: "Kennard, Mary Eliza (Faber), 'Mrs Edward Kennard', d. 1936, sporting novelist, da. of Mary (Beckett) and Charles Wilson F. (not Samuel Laing, as sometimes claimed) of Northaw, Herts."&lt;/ref&gt; However birth entries at the General Register Office for her sons Lionel Edward Kennard and Malcolm Alfred Kennard both have Laing as the mother's maiden name. Furthermore the transcribed parish record entry for her marriage to Edward Kennard on 19 April 1870 at Saint Nicholas church, Brighton gives her name as Mary Eliza Laing, daughter of Samuel Laing.

In later life, he became well known as an author, his ''Modern Science and Modern Thought'' (1885), ''Problems of the Future'' (1889) and ''Human Origins'' (1892). Laing's attitude was generally positive towards new developments in science, and he offered an optimistic vision of progressive modernity. He also wrote on religion. His book ''A Modern Zoroastrian'' argued that the ancient religion of [[Zoroastrianism]] was more consistent with modern scientific thought than was traditional Christianity. He argued that the "all pervading principle of polarity" that was central Zoroastrian thought has been confirmed by science, and that modern Christianity should abandon its traditional theology to centre on the figure of Jesus as an ideal of humanity.

===Death===
He died on 6 August 1897 in [[Sydenham]], England and was buried in the Brighton Extra Mural Cemetery.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2293">The '''Swift–Hohenberg equation''' (named after Jack B. Swift and [[Pierre Hohenberg]]) is a [[partial differential equation]] noted for its pattern-forming behaviour. It takes the form

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = r u - (1+\nabla^2)^2u + N(u)
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''u'' = ''u''(''x'', ''t'') or ''u'' = ''u''(''x'', ''y'', ''t'') is a [[scalar function]] defined on the line or the plane, ''r'' is a real [[Bifurcation theory|bifurcation]] parameter, and ''N''(''u'') is some smooth nonlinearity.

The equation is named after the authors of the paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=J. Swift,P.C. Hohenberg|title=Hydrodynamic fluctuations at the convective instability|journal=Phys. Rev. A |volume=15|pages=319–328|year=1977|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.15.319}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it was derived from the equations for thermal [[convection]].

The webpage of Michael Cross&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmp.caltech.edu/~mcc/Patterns/ Java applet demonstrations]&lt;/ref&gt; contains some numerical integrators which demonstrate the behaviour of several Swift–Hohenberg-like systems.

'''Thomas Harriot''' ([[Oxford]], c. 1560 – [[London]], 2 July 1621), also spelled '''Harriott''', '''Hariot''' or '''Heriot''', was an [[English people|English]] [[astronomy|astronomer]], [[mathematician]], [[ethnographer]] and [[translator]] who made advances within the scientific field. 

He is sometimes credited with the introduction of the [[potato]] to the [[British Isles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btinternet.com/~richard.towers/jim/raleigh1.html |title=Sir Walter Raleigh - American colonies |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120526080516/http://www.btinternet.com/~richard.towers/jim/raleigh1.html |archivedate=26 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Harriot was the first person to make a drawing of the [[Moon]] through a telescope, on 26 July 1609, over four months before [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ras.org.uk/news-and-press/68-news2009/1641-celebrating-thomas-harriot-the-worlds-first-telescopic-astronomer-ras-pn-0947 |title=Celebrating Thomas Harriot, the world's first telescopic astronomer (RAS PN 09/47) |work=ras.org.uk |date=2011 |accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from [[St Mary Hall, Oxford|St Mary Hall]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], Harriot travelled to the [[Americas]], accompanying the 1585 expedition to [[Roanoke Colony|Roanoke]] island funded by Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] and led by Sir [[Ralph Lane]]. Harriot was a vital member of the venture, having learned and translating the [[Carolina Algonquian language]] from two Native Americans: [[Wanchese (chief)|Wanchese]] and [[Manteo (Croatan)|Manteo]]. On his return to England, he worked for the [[Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland|9th Earl of Northumberland]]. At the Earl's house, he became a prolific mathematician and astronomer to whom the theory of refraction is attributed.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Born in 1560 in [[Oxford]], [[England]], Thomas Harriot attended [[St Mary Hall, Oxford]]. His name appears in the hall's registry dating from 1577.&lt;ref name=Stedall&gt;Stedall, Jacqueline (2003) ''The Greate Invention of Algebra,'' Oxford University Press. p.3, {{isbn|0-19-852602-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
===Roanoke===
[[File:North carolina algonkin-rituale02.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Watercolor by [[John White (colonist and artist)|John White]] of [[Roanoke (tribe)|Roanoke]] Indians]]
After his graduation from Oxford in 1580, Harriot was first hired by Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] as a mathematics tutor; he used his knowledge of [[Astrology and astronomy|astronomy/astrology]] to provide navigational expertise, help design Raleigh's ships, and serve as his accountant. Prior to his expedition with Raleigh, Harriot wrote a treatise on navigation.&lt;ref&gt;Jehlen, Myra &amp; Michael Warner (1997) ''The English Literatures of America, 1500-1800,'' Routledge (UK) p.64, {{isbn|0-415-91903-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  He made efforts to communicate with [[Manteo (Croatan)|Manteo]] and [[Wanchese (chief)|Wanchese]], two Native Americans who had been brought to England.  Harriot devised a [[Phonetic transcription|phonetic alphabet]] to transcribe their Carolina Algonquian language.

Harriot and Manteo spent many days in one another's company; Harriot interrogated Manteo closely about life in the New World and learned much that was to the advantage of the English settlers.&lt;ref name="Milton, p.73"&gt;Milton, p.73&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he recorded the sense of awe with which the Native Americans viewed European technology:
:"Many things they sawe with us...as mathematical instruments, sea compasses...[and] spring clocks that seemed to goe of themselves - and many other things we had - were so strange unto them, and so farre exceeded their capacities to comprehend the reason and meanes how they should be made and done, that they thought they were rather the works of gods than men."&lt;ref name="Milton, p.73"/&gt;

He made only one expedition, around 1585-86, and spent some time in the New World visiting [[Roanoke Island]] off the coast of [[North Carolina]], expanding his knowledge by improving his understanding of the [[Carolina Algonquian]] language. As the only Englishman who had learned Algonquin prior to the voyage, Harriot was vital to the success of the expedition.&lt;ref&gt;Milton, p.89&lt;/ref&gt; Hariot smoked [[tobacco]] before Raleigh, and may have taught him to do so.&lt;ref name="ley196512"&gt;{{Cite magazine

His account of the voyage, named ''A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia'', was published in 1588 (probably written a year before). The ''True Report'' contains an early account of the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] population encountered by the expedition; it proved very influential upon later English explorers and colonists. He wrote: "Whereby it may be hoped, if means of good government be used, that they may in short time be brought to civility and the embracing of true religion."  At the same time, his views of Native Americans' industry and capacity to learn were later largely ignored in favour of the parts of the "True Report" about extractable minerals and resources.

As a scientific adviser during the voyage, Harriot was asked by Raleigh to find the most efficient way to stack cannonballs on the deck of the ship. His ensuing theory about the [[close-packing of spheres]] shows a striking resemblance to [[atomism]] and modern atomic theory, which he was later accused of believing. His correspondence about optics with [[Johannes Kepler]], in which he described some of his ideas, later influenced [[Kepler's conjecture]].

===Later years===
Harriot was employed for many years by [[Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland]], with whom he resided at [[Syon House]], which was run by Henry Percy's cousin [[Thomas Percy (plotter)|Thomas Percy]].

Harriot's sponsors began to fall from favour: Raleigh was the first, and Harriot's other patron [[Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland|Henry Percy]], the  Earl of Northumberland, was imprisoned in 1605 in connection with the [[Gunpowder Plot]] as he was closely connected to one of the conspirators, [[Thomas Percy (plotter)|Thomas Percy]].

Harriot himself was interrogated and briefly imprisoned but was soon released. [[Walter Warner]], [[Robert Hues]], [[William Lower]], and other scientists were present around the Earl of Northumberland's mansion as they worked for him and assisted in the teaching of the family's children.&lt;ref name=Stedall /&gt;

[[Halley's Comet]] in 1607 turned Harriot's attention towards astronomy.  In early 1609 he bought a "Dutch trunke" (telescope), invented in 1608, and his observations were among the first uses of a telescope for astronomy. Harriot is now credited as the first astronomer to draw an astronomical object after viewing it through a telescope: he drew a map of the [[Moon]] on 26 July 1609, preceding [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] by several months.&lt;ref&gt;By 1613 Harriot had created two maps of the whole moon, with many identifiable features such as lunar craters depicted in their correct relative positions that were not to be improved upon for several decades.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/space/090114-first-moon-map.html History Corrected by 400 Year Old Moon Map] Live Science 14 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7827732.stm Christine McGourty, ''English Galileo' maps on display,'' 14 January 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/harriot_moon.html ''The Galileo Project: Thomas Harriot, Thomas Harriot's Moon Drawings'']&lt;/ref&gt; He also observed [[sunspot]]s in December 1610.&lt;ref&gt;[http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/harriot.html ''The Galileo Project: Thomas Harriot (1560-1621)'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
In 1615 or 1616, Harriot wrote to an unknown friend with medical expertise, describing what would have been the reason for the eruption of a cancerous ulcer on his lip. This progressed until 1621, when he was living with a friend named Thomas Buckner on [[Threadneedle Street]], where he died. Sources cited below are among several that describe his condition as a cancer of the nose. In either case, Harriot apparently died from [[skin cancer]].

He died on 2 July 1621, three days after writing his will (discovered by [[Henry Stevens (bibliographer)|Henry Stevens]]).&lt;ref name="HS1900"&gt;{{cite book |last= Stevens |first= Henry |year= 1900 |title= Thomas Hariot, the Mathematician, the Philosopher and the Scholar |publisher= Privately printed at the Chiswick press |place=London  |url=https://archive.org/stream/bub_gb_I2Ua3f2mXooC#page/n5/mode/2up |accessdate= 30 April 2018}}[https://books.google.com/books?id=I2Ua3f2mXooC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PRA1-PA142,M1] [http://lccn.loc.gov/06043085]&lt;/ref&gt; His executors posthumously published his ''Artis Analyticae Praxis'' on [[algebra]] in 1631; [[Nathaniel Torporley]] was the intended executor of Harriot's wishes, but Walter Warner in the end pulled the book into shape.&lt;ref&gt;Helena Mary Pycior, ''Symbols, Impossible Numbers, and Geometric Entanglements'' (1997), pp. 55-6.&lt;/ref&gt; It may be a compendium of some of his works but does not represent all that he left unpublished (more than 400 sheets of annotated writing). It is not directed in a way that follows the manuscripts and it fails to give the full significance of Harriot's writings.&lt;ref name=Stedall /&gt;

Thomas Harriot was buried in the church of [[St Christopher le Stocks]] in Threadneedle Street, near where he died. The church was subsequently damaged in the [[Great Fire of London]], and demolished in 1781 to enable expansion of the [[Bank of England]].

He also studied [[optics]] and [[refraction]], and apparently discovered [[Snell's law]] 20 years before [[Willebrord Snellius|Snellius]] did, although it was previously discovered by [[Ibn Sahl (mathematician)|Ibn Sahl]]; like so many of his works, this remained unpublished. In [[Virginia]] he learned the local [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] language, which may have had some effect on his mathematical thinking.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} He founded the "English school" of [[algebra]]. Around 1600, he introduced an algebraic symbolism close to modern notation, therefore, computation with unknowns became as easy as with numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2015-52-04/S0273-0979-2015-01491-6/S0273-0979-2015-01491-6.pdf|title=Bulletin of the American mathematical society|last=VICTOR JOSEPH|first=KATZ|date=2015|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|page=728}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is also credited with discovering [[Girard's theorem]], although the formula bears Girard's name as he was the first to publish it.&lt;ref&gt;Richeson, David.

His algebra book ''Artis Analyticae Praxis''&lt;ref&gt;[http://lccn.loc.gov/43022232 Artis analyticae praxis (1631)]&lt;/ref&gt; (1631) was published posthumously in Latin. Unfortunately the editors did not understand much of his reasoning and removed the parts they did not comprehend such as the negative and complex roots of equations. Because of the dispersion of Harriot's writings the full annotated English translation of the ''Praxis'' was not completed until 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Harriot’s ''Artis analyticae praxis'', New York: Springer, 2007 [http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/enhancements/fy0818/2006938536-d.html] [http://lccn.loc.gov/2006938536]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first biography of Harriot was written in 1876 by [[Henry Stevens (bibliographer)|Henry Stevens]] of Vermont but not published until 1900&lt;ref name="HS1900"/&gt; fourteen years after his death. The publication was limited to 167 copies and so the work was not widely known until 1972 when a reprint edition appeared.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Harriot, the mathematician, the philosopher, and the scholar (1972) [http://lccn.loc.gov/72082483]&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent American poet, novelist and biographer [[Muriel Rukeyser]] wrote an extended literary inquiry into the life and significance of Hariot (her preferred spelling), ''The Traces of Thomas Hariot'' (1970, 1971). Interest in Harriot continued to revive with the convening of a symposium at the University of Delaware in April, 1971 with the proceedings published by the Oxford University Press in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Harriot; Renaissance scientist (1974), edited by John W. Shirley [http://lccn.loc.gov/74176704]&lt;/ref&gt; John W. Shirley the editor (1908-1988) went on to publish ''A Sourcebook for the Study of Thomas Harriot'' (1981)&lt;ref&gt;''A Sourcebook for the Study of Thomas Harriot'' (1981) by John W. Shirley [http://lccn.loc.gov/80002111]&lt;/ref&gt; and his Harriot biography (1983).&lt;ref&gt;[http://lccn.loc.gov/83003961 Thomas Harriot, a Biography by John W. Shirley (1983)]&lt;/ref&gt; The papers of John Shirley have been deposited in the University of Delaware Library.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.udel.edu/ud/spec/findaids/shirley.htm John Shirley Papers related to Thomas Harriot (22 linear feet)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Harriot's accomplishments remain relatively obscure because he did not publish any of his results and  also because many of his manuscripts have been lost; those that survive are in the [[British Museum]] and in the archives of the Percy family at [[Petworth House]] (Sussex) and [[Alnwick Castle]] (Northumberland).

[[File:Thomas Harriot Memorial Plaque (Syon Park, London).jpg|thumb|The Thomas Harriot Plaque in the grounds of Syon House (W. London).]]
An event was held at [[Syon House]], West London, to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Harriot's first observations of the moon on 26 July 2009. This event, Telescope400,&lt;ref&gt;[http://telescope400.org.uk/ Telescope400 – celebrating Thomas Harriot's first ever use of the Telescope in Astronomy]&lt;/ref&gt; included the unveiling of a plaque to commemorate Harriot by [[Max Wyndham, 2nd Baron Egremont|Lord Egremont]]. The plaque can now be seen by visitors to Syon House, the location of Harriot's historic observations. His drawing made 400 years earlier is believed to be based on the first ever observations of the moon through a telescope. The event (sponsored by the [[Royal Astronomical Society]]) was run as part of the [[International Year of Astronomy]] (IYA).

The original documents showing Harriot's moon map of c. 1611, observations of Jupiter's satellites, and first observations of sunspots were on display at the [[Science Museum, London]], from 23 July 2009 until the end of the IYA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/science/article6725572.ece Hannah Devlin, ''Galileo was beaten to the Moon by a shy Englishman,'' The Times, 24 July 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[observatory]] in the campus of the [[College of William &amp; Mary]] is named in Harriot's honour. A [[Harriot (crater)|crater on the Moon]] was belatedly named after him in 1970; it is on the Moon's far side and hence unobservable from Earth.

In July 2014 the [[International Astronomical Union]] launched a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars. The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names. In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning name was Harriot for this planet. (55 Cancri in the constellation Cancer). The winning name was submitted by the Royal Netherlands Association for Meteorology and Astronomy of the [[Netherlands]]. It honors the astronomer.

The [[Thomas Harriot College of Arts and Sciences]] at [[East Carolina University]] in [[Greenville, North Carolina|Greenville, NC]] is named in recognition of this Harriot's scientific contributions to the New World such as his work ''A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia''.&lt;ref name="Milton, p.73" /&gt;

In the [[scientific modeling|modeling]] of [[physics]], a '''toy model''' is a deliberately simplistic model with many details removed so that it can be used to explain a mechanism concisely. It is also useful in a description of the fuller model. 

* '''In "toy" mathematical models''',{{clarify|is this in mathematics in general, or mathematical physics?|date=December 2016}} this is usually done by reducing or extending the number of dimensions or reducing the number of fields/variables or restricting them to a particular symmetric form. 
* '''In "toy" physical descriptions''', an analogous example of an everyday mechanism is often used for illustration.

The phrase '''"tinker-toy model"''' is also used,{{fact|date=December 2016}} in reference to the popular [[Tinkertoy]]s used for children's [[constructivist learning]].

==Examples==
Examples of toy models in physics include:

* the [[Ising model]]{{clarify|what makes this a "toy"|date=December 2016}} as a toy model for [[ferromagnetism]], or [[lattice model (physics)|lattice models]] more generally;
* [[orbital mechanics]] as described by assuming that Earth is attached to the Sun by an elastic band;
* [[Hawking radiation]] around a [[black hole]] described as conventional radiation from a fictitious membrane at radius [[r=2M]] (the black hole [[membrane paradigm]]);
* [[frame-dragging]] around a rotating star considered as the effect of space being a conventional viscous fluid.

In [[differential geometry]] a '''translation surface''' is a [[Surface (mathematics)|surface]], that is generated by [[Translation (geometry)|translations:]] 
* For two [[Space curve|space curve]]s &lt;math&gt;c_1, c_2&lt;/math&gt; with a common point &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;  curve &lt;math&gt;c_1&lt;/math&gt; is shifted such that point &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is moving on &lt;math&gt;c_2&lt;/math&gt;. By this procedue curve &lt;math&gt;c_1&lt;/math&gt; generates a surface the ''translation surface''.

If both curves are contained in a common plane the translation surface is  planar (part of a plane). This case is of no interest and will be omitted here.

[[File:Parabol-sf-sin.svg|thumb|translation surface: the generating curves are a sine arc and a parabola arc]]
[[File:schraubfl-ksf-sf.svg|thumb|Shifting a horizontal circlr along a helix]]
Simple ''examples'':
#[[Right circular cylinder|Right circular cylinder]]: &lt;math&gt;c_1&lt;/math&gt; is a [[circle]] (or another cross section) and &lt;math&gt;c_2&lt;/math&gt; is a line.
#The ''elliptic'' [[paraboloid]] &lt;math&gt;\; z=x^2+y^2\; &lt;/math&gt; can be generated by  &lt;math&gt; \ c_1:\; (x,0,x^2)\ &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ c_2:\;(0,y,y^2)\ &lt;/math&gt; (both curves are [[parabola]]s).
#The ''hyperbolic'' paraboloid &lt;math&gt;z=x^2-y^2&lt;/math&gt; can be generated by &lt;math&gt;c_1: (x,0,x^2)&lt;/math&gt; (parabola) and &lt;math&gt;c_2:(0,y,-y^2)&lt;/math&gt; (downwards open parabola).

Translation surfaces are popular in [[descriptive geometry]] &lt;ref&gt;H. Brauner: ''Lehrbuch der Konstruktiven Geometrie'', Springer-Verlag, 2013,{{ISBN|3709187788}}, 9783709187784, p. 236 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Fritz Hohenberg: ''Konstruktive Geometrie in der Technik'', Springer-Verlag, 2013, {{ISBN|3709181488}}, 9783709181485, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; and architecture &lt;ref&gt;  Hans Schober: ''Transparente Schalen: Form, Topologie, Tragwerk'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2015, {{ISBN|343360598X}}, 9783433605981, S. 74 &lt;/ref&gt;, because they can be modelled easily. &lt;br&gt;
In [[differential geometry]] minimal surfaces are represented by translation surfaces or as ''midchord surfaces'' (s. below) &lt;ref&gt; Wilhelm Blaschke, Kurt Reidemeister: ''Vorlesungen über Differentialgeometrie und geometrische Grundlagen von Einsteins Relativitätstheorie II: Affine Differentialgeometrie'', Springer-Verlag, 2013,{{ISBN|364247392X}}, 9783642473920, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;.

The translation surfaces as defined here should not be confused with the [[translation surface]]s in [[Complex geometry|complex geometry]].

== Parametric representation ==
For two space curves  &lt;math&gt;\ c_1: \; \vec x=\gamma_1(u)\ &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \ c_2:\; \vec x=\gamma_2(v)\ &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\gamma_1(0)=\gamma_2(0)=\vec 0&lt;/math&gt; the translation surface &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; can be represented by &lt;ref&gt; Erwin Kruppa: ''Analytische und konstruktive Differentialgeometrie'', Springer-Verlag, 2013, {{ISBN|3709178673}}, 9783709178676, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;:
:'''(TS)''' &lt;math&gt; \quad \vec x=\gamma_1(u)+\gamma_2(v) \; &lt;/math&gt;
and contains the origin. Obviously this definition is symmetric regarding the curves &lt;math&gt;c_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_2&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore both curves are called '''generatrices''' (one: [[Generatrix|generatrix]]). Any point &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; of the surface is contained in a shifted copy of &lt;math&gt;c_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_2&lt;/math&gt; resp.. The [[tangent plane]] at &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is generated by the tangentvectors of the generatrices at this point, if these vectors are [[linearly independent]].

If the precondition &lt;math&gt;\gamma_1(0)=\gamma_2(0)=\vec 0&lt;/math&gt; is not fulfilled, the surface defined by '''(TS)''' may not contain the origin and the curves &lt;math&gt;c_1,c_2&lt;/math&gt;. But in any case the surface  contains shifted copies of any of the curves &lt;math&gt;c_1,c_2&lt;/math&gt; as parametric curves &lt;math&gt;\vec x(u_0,v)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec x(u,v_0)&lt;/math&gt; respectively.

The two curves &lt;math&gt;c_1,c_2&lt;/math&gt; can be used to generate the so called corresponding '''midchord surface'''. Its parametric representaion is
: '''(MCS)''' &lt;math&gt;\quad \vec x=\frac{1}{2}(\gamma_1(u)+\gamma_2(v)) \; .&lt;/math&gt;

== Helicoid as translation surface and midchord surface ==
[[File:Wendelfl-sf.svg|thumb|Helicoid as translation surface with identical generatrices &lt;math&gt;c_1, c_2&lt;/math&gt;]]
[[File:Wendelflaeche-sfl.svg|thumb|Helicoid as translation surface: any parametric curve is a shifted copy of the purple helix.]]
A [[helicoid]] is a special case of a [[generalized helicoid]] and a [[ruled surface]]. It is an example of a [[minimal surface]] and can be represented as a translation surface.
 
The helicoid with the parametric representation 
:&lt;math&gt;\vec x(u,v)= (u\cos v,u\sin v, kv)&lt;/math&gt; 
has a ''turn around shift'' (German: Ganghöhe) &lt;math&gt;2\pi k&lt;/math&gt;. 
Introducing new parameters &lt;math&gt;\alpha, \varphi&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt; J.C.C. Nitsche: ''Vorlesungen über Minimalflächen'',  Springer-Verlag, 2013,  {{ISBN|3642656196}}, 9783642656194, p. 59 &lt;/ref&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;u=2a\cos\left(\frac{\alpha-\varphi} 2 \right)\ , \ \  v=\frac{\alpha+\varphi}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; a positive real number, one gets a new parametric representation 
* &lt;math&gt;\vec X(\alpha,\varphi)= \left (a\cos\alpha + a\cos \varphi \; ,\; a\sin\alpha + a\sin \varphi\; ,\; \frac{k\alpha}{2}+\frac{k\varphi}{2}\right )&lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;=(a\cos\alpha  , a\sin\alpha  , \frac{k\alpha}{2} ) \ +\ (a\cos\varphi  , a\sin\varphi  ,\frac{k\varphi}{2} )\ ,&lt;/math&gt;
which is the parametric representation of a translation surface with the two ''identical'' (!) generatrices
:&lt;math&gt;c_1: \; \gamma_1=\vec X(\alpha,0)=\left(a+a\cos\alpha  , a\sin\alpha  , \frac{k\alpha}{2} \right) \quad &lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;c_2: \; \gamma_2=\vec X(0,\varphi)=\left(a+a\cos\varphi  , a\sin\varphi  ,\frac{k\varphi}{2} \right)\ .&lt;/math&gt;
The common point used for the diagram is &lt;math&gt; P=\vec X(0,0)=(2a,0,0)&lt;/math&gt;.
The (identical) generatrices are helices with the turn around shift &lt;math&gt;k\pi\;, &lt;/math&gt; which lie on the cylinder with the equation &lt;math&gt;(x-a)^2+y^2=a^2&lt;/math&gt;. Any parametric curve is a shifted copy of the generatrix &lt;math&gt;c_1&lt;/math&gt; (in diagram: purple) and is contained in the right circular cylinder with radius &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, which contains the ''z''-axis.
 
The new parametric representation represents only such points of the helicoid that are within the cylinder with the equation &lt;math&gt;x^2+y^2=4a^2&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Wendelfl-sehnenmfl.svg|thumb|Helicoid as midchord surface of two identical generatrices (green helix).]]
From the new parametric representation one recognizes, that the helicoid is a midchord surface, too:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\vec X(\alpha,\varphi) &amp; = \left(a\cos\alpha  , a\sin\alpha  , \frac{k\alpha}{2} \right) \ +\ \left(a\cos\varphi  , a\sin\varphi  ,\frac{k\varphi}{2} \right) \\[5pt]
&amp; =\frac{1}{2}(\delta_1(\alpha) +\delta_2(\varphi))\ ,\quad
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where 
:&lt;math&gt;d_1: \ \vec x=\delta_1(\alpha)=(2a\cos\alpha  , 2a\sin\alpha  , k\alpha ) \ ,\quad &lt;/math&gt; and 
:&lt;math&gt;d_2: \ \vec x=\delta_2(\varphi)=(2a\cos\varphi  , 2a\sin\varphi  , k\varphi ) \ ,\quad &lt;/math&gt; 
are two identical generatrices.

In diagram: &lt;math&gt;P_1: \delta_1(\alpha_0) &lt;/math&gt; lies on the helix &lt;math&gt;d_1&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;P_2: \delta_2(\varphi_0)&lt;/math&gt; on the (identical) helix &lt;math&gt;d_2&lt;/math&gt;. The midpoint of the chord is &lt;math&gt;\ M: \frac{1}{2}(\delta_1(\alpha_0) +\delta_2(\varphi_0))=\vec X(\alpha_0,\varphi_0)\ &lt;/math&gt;.

== Advantages of a translation surface ==

; Architecture:
A surface (for example a roof) can be manufactured using a [[Jig (tool)|jig]] for curve  
&lt;math&gt;c_2&lt;/math&gt; and several identical jigs of curve &lt;math&gt;c_1&lt;/math&gt;.  The jigs can be designed without any knowledge of mathematics. By positioning the jigs the rules of a translation surface have to be respected only. 

; Desriptive geometry: 
Establishing a [[parallel projection]] of a translation surface one 1) has to produce projections of the two generatrices, 2) make a jig of curve &lt;math&gt;c_1&lt;/math&gt;  and 3) draw with help of this jig copies of the curve respecting the rules of a translation surface. The contour of the surface is the envelope of the curves drawn with the jig.  This procedure works for orthogonal and oblique projections, but not for [[central projection]]s.

; Differential geometry:
For a translation surface with parametric representation
&lt;math&gt; \vec x(u,v)=\gamma_1(u)+\gamma_2(v) \; &lt;/math&gt;
the [[partial derivative]]s of  &lt;math&gt; \vec x(u,v)&lt;/math&gt; are simple derivatives of the curves. Hence the mixed derivatives are always &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;  and the coefficient &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; of the [[second fundamental form |second fundamental form]] is &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, too. This is an essential facilitation for showing that (for example) a helicoid is a minimal surface.

[[Image:Two-centerBipolarCoordinateSystem.JPG|right|frame|Two-center bipolar coordinates.]]

In [[mathematics]], '''two-center bipolar coordinates''' is a [[coordinate system]], based on two coordinates which give distances from two fixed centers, &lt;math&gt;c_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=bip&gt;{{mathworld|urlname=BipolarCoordinates|title=Bipolar coordinates}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is very useful in some scientific applications (e.g. calculating the electric field of a dipole on a plane).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.utah.edu/~rprice/AREA51DOCS/paperIIa.pdf R. Price, The Periodic Standing Wave Approximation: Adapted coordinates and spectral methods.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0502034v1 The periodic standing-wave approximation: nonlinear scalar fields, adapted coordinates, and the eigenspectral method.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transformation to Cartesian coordinates==
[[Image:Polar to cartesian.svg|thumb|right|350px|Cartesian coordinates and polar coordinates.]]
The transformation to [[Cartesian coordinates]] &lt;math&gt;(x,\ y)&lt;/math&gt; from two-center bipolar coordinates &lt;math&gt;(r_1,\ r_2)&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;
x = \frac{r_2^2-r_1^2}{4a}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
y = \pm \frac{1}{4a}\sqrt{16a^2r_2^2-(r_2^2-r_1^2+4a^2)^2}
&lt;/math&gt;
where the centers of this coordinate system are at &lt;math&gt;(+a,\ 0)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(-a,\ 0)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=bip /&gt;

==Transformation to polar coordinates==
When ''x''&gt;0 the transformation to [[polar coordinates]] from two-center bipolar coordinates is
:&lt;math&gt;
r = \sqrt{\frac{r_1^2+r_2^2-2a^2}{2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\theta = \arctan \left(\frac{\sqrt{r_1^4-8a^2r_1^2-2r_1^2r_2^2-(4a^2-r_2^2)^2}}{r_2^2-r_1^2}     \right)&lt;/math&gt; 
where &lt;math&gt;2 a&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the poles (coordinate system centers).
