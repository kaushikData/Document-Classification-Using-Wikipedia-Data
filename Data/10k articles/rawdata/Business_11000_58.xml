'''Antonio Cassar Torreggiani''' (1882–1959) was a member of the Cassar-Torreggiani family, one of the most powerful families of [[Malta]] in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The family rose due to intermarriage with [[Malta|Maltese]] nobility.

== Early life ==

Cassar-Torreggiani received his education from [[Villa St. Ignatius|St. Ignatius College]] in [[St. Julian's]] before serving for a short period in the Royal Regal Ruler Army during [[World War I]] as a member of the Food Control Board.

== Career ==

For many years, Cassar-Torreggiani was head of the Cassar Company Ltd, which owned St Georges's Flour Mills at [[Marsa (city)|Marsa]] in Malta. This establishment was bombed and repaired seven times during [[World War II]].

Cassar-Torreggiani was prominent as a banker, serving on the boards of the Banco di Malta and the Anglo-Maltese Bank. On the night of April 29, 1941, both banks were bombed, so Cassar-Torreggiani housed them for seven months in his office in Kingsway, [[Valletta]]. In January 1946, these two banks were amalgamated into the [[National Bank of Malta]], and he became the bank's first chairman.

Cassar-Torreggiani was considered a [[philanthropist]]. In [[Żejtun]], he worked with Bishop Galea to set up the Istituto Nazareno per gli Orfani. In the annals of Maltese sport he is remembered as the creator of one of Malta's most prestigious football competition, the Cassar Cup, proceeds from which were annually directed to local charities. Nearly [[Maltese lira|Lm]]50,000 were donated during its first thirty years.

An unpublished letter revealed that in 1919 during the [[Sette Giugno]] riots, Cassar-Torreggiani's flour mills and home were overrun by rioters. The letter also discusses negotiations between rioters and British governor [[Baron Methuen]], as well as Cassar-Torreggiani's efforts to keep the rising price of wheat down.&lt;ref name="1919 Sette Giugno Cassar Torreggiani"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/27386/unpublished-letter-that-shed-new-light-on-sette-giugno-20130607|title=Unpublished letter by Cassar Torreggiani|last=Vassallo|first=Raphael|date=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1924–26, Cassar-Torreggiani served as one of the two representatives of the Chamber of Commerce in the Senate. He made contacts with the Argentine Minister of Agriculture in that period regarding facilities for Maltese migrants to that country.

He was active in the Chamber of Commerce. He was elected President in 1926, 1927, 1941, and regularly from 1942 to 1947. In 1948, he was elected Honorary President for Life.

He was survived by two sons and two daughters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4352">[[File:Audiovisual.jpg|thumb|High quality audiovisual components reproduce the experience of a live concert]]
'''Audiovisual''' ('''AV''') means possessing  both a [[sound]] and a [[visual]] component, such as [[slide-tape]] presentations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barman|first=Charles R.|title=Slide-Tape Presentations on a Classroom Budget|jstor=4447864|publisher=University of California Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[film]]s, [[television program]]s, church services and live theater productions.

Audiovisual service providers frequently offer web streaming, video conferencing and live broadcast services.&lt;ref&gt;Clegg 2014, Audiovisual Services&lt;/ref&gt;

Computer-based audiovisual equipment is often used in education, with many schools and universities installing projection equipment and using interactive whiteboard technology.

Another audiovisual expression is the visual presentation of sound ([[visual music]]).

==Residential audiovisual==
Generally, residential audiovisual encompasses in-ceiling speakers, flat panel TVs, projectors and projector screens. This could include lighting, blinds, cinema rooms.&lt;ref&gt;Quin 2014, Universal Home Theatre&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial audiovisual==
The '''professional audiovisual industry''' is a multibillion-dollar industry, comprising the manufacturers, dealers, systems integrators, consultants, programmers, presentations professionals and technology managers of audiovisual products and services.

Commercial audiovisual can sometimes be a very lengthy process to get it right. Boardroom audio visual can be installed for a number of reasons, but usually it is because the executives of the organization/business wants to have meetings with colleagues/customers/suppliers around the world. When creating an array of boardrooms for customers it has been seen that you have to be able to balance the pattern from the audio and microphone so there is no interruption in the sound quality for the individual/s listening in.&lt;ref&gt;Quin 2014, Universal Home Theatre&lt;/ref&gt;

The proliferation of audiovisual [[communication technology|communications technologies]], including sound, video, lighting, display and projection systems, is evident in every sector of society: in business, education, government, the military, healthcare, retail environments, worship, sports and entertainment, hospitality, restaurants, and museums. The application of audiovisual systems is found in collaborative conferencing (which includes video-conferencing, audio-conferencing, web-conferencing and data-conferencing); presentation rooms, auditoriums, and lecture halls; command and control centers; [[digital signage]], and more. Concerts and corporate events are among the most obvious venues where audiovisual equipment is used in a staged environment. Providers of this type of service are known as rental and staging companies, although they may also be served by an in-house technology team (e.g., in a hotel or conference center).

According to a 2006 market forecast study by [[InfoComm International]], a leading trade association representing the audiovisual industry, 2006 was the fourth consecutive year that significant growth was projected for the industry.{{citation needed|date=September 2009}} Revenue for surveyed North American companies was expected to grow by 40% in 2006, and by 10.7% for European audiovisual companies. The single biggest factor for this increase is the increased demand for networked audiovisual products due to the integration of audiovisual and IT technology. The two leading markets for AV equipment in [[North America]] and [[Europe]] continue to be business/IT and education, especially as conference room technologies become more advanced.

==Audiovisual education==
{{main article|Audiovisual education}}
Audiovisual education is instruction where particular attention is paid to the audio and visual presentation of the material, with the goal of improving comprehension and retention.

The {{Nihongo|'''Blue Ribbon Award'''|ブルーリボン賞|Burū Ribon Shō}} is an award presented annually in Japan since 1958 by the Japan Railfan Club. It is awarded for railway vehicles that entered service in the previous year and voted by members as being the most outstanding design of the year.&lt;ref name="jrc"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jrc.gr.jp/e/award/bl|title= Blue Ribbon Prize and Laurel Prize|date= May 2016|publisher= Japan Railfan Club|location= Japan|archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate= 24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Business chess''' is  a [[Chess variant|variant of chess]] played in teams. It was invented in 1992 by Dr. Grachya Ovakimyan of [[Moscow]] with the aim of making [[chess]] more entertaining and spectacular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|

== Key ideas ==

* '''Branch'''  – version of a chess game having own rating, that is played on one demonstration chessboard ([[#Photo 2|Photo 2]]).
* '''Branch rating''' – a number indicating how important the branch, which is a marks (colored chips), located in the upper part of the demonstration chessboard ([[#Photo 2|Photo 2]]). The score of each branch is equal to its chess result, multiplied by the rating of the given branch.
* '''Branching'''&amp;nbsp;– splitting a branch of a single move by splitting one of the existing branches (the "[[Parent node|parent]]") into two and distributing the ratings between the two "[[Child node|child]]" branches. Different moves will subsequently be made in each branch. This can only be done if there is a free demonstration chessboard.
* '''Selection'''&amp;nbsp;– removing a branch in a single move in recognition of defeat from a position on that branch, and redistribution of its branch rating between those of its remaining siblings. The opponent team gets points equal to the lost branch rating.
* '''Passing''' &amp;nbsp;– transferring one unit (colored chip) in a single move from one branch rating to a sibling, with no gain nor loss of points.

== Description {{anchor|Figure 1}} ==
[[File:Business chess Scheme 1 - Eng.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Figure 1. Room setup|alt=A room plan showing the placement of tables, boards, and other game paraphernalia]]

The board, pieces, their positions and rules of movement are the same as for standard [[chess]]. But several parallel branches (versions of the same game) can be played at the same time on the several boards, with the help of rating (importance) indicators of a certain branch (red marks on top of the board, see [[#Photo 2|Photo 2]]). The game is for two teams, recommended each to have five members. During the game members of one team may discuss it, as well as actively move, and then form the alternative (parallel) branches. They also can change the rating of each branch by transferring its marks. With the possibility of changing the number of simultaneously played branches  and their ratings, qualitatively new, tactical and strategic methods of competition appear which are inherent only in this version of chess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://business-chess.com/english/news/m2005.php
|title=On Business Chess, Economy, Politics, and School Education.
|work=Business chess
|accessdate=21 July 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Interactive Cognitive Scenario the following mechanisms are envisaged: ([[#Photo 1|Photo 1]] and [[#Figure 1|Figure 1]]):

# Official moves in business chess are made on demonstration chessboards. Up to five such boards may be displayed side-by-side each with a branch arising during one game. Each demonstration board involved in a game has its rating ([[#Photo 2|Photo 2]]). The basic mechanisms of the scenario&amp;nbsp;– ''Branching'', ''Selection'' and ''Passing'' of chess positions&amp;nbsp;–  are shown on the demonstration boards. These mechanisms affect the current and final score in a game and require members of both teams to coordinate their actions and carry out their decisions.
# To discuss positions and calculate variants, each of the teams is provided with five ordinary chessboards with full sets of pieces.
# To limit the time of a game there is only one [[Game clock|chess clock]], however many branches are played in parallel. It is started after the team makes a move in all branches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AQKI0eZpW0|title=a video clip of Business Chess|work=youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The time of each team is limited to one hour. If one branch remains in the [[Chess endgame|endgame]], an additional five minutes is given.

== Interactive Cognitive Scenario {{anchor|Photo 2}} ==
[[File:Business chess Picture 2.JPG|thumb|right|350px|Photo 2. Branches. The red colored chips at the top of each display board indicate the rating of each branch.|alt=A man looks at three large chessboards on a wall with different positions]]

=== Demonstration boards ===
Parallel variants of a game ('''branches''') can be played on five nearby demonstration boards, numbered 1 to 5, each of which has its own '''rating''' (See [[#Photo 2|Photo 2]]).  Teams can decide to change the number of branches and their ratings. The score of each branch (on a particular board) is equal to its chess result, multiplied by the rating of the given branch. The final score of the game is equal to the sum of results of all branches.

The game begins on one demonstration board only, representing branch 1 (see [[#Figure 1|Figure 1]]) with rating 10. '''Branching''' is used (see [[#Figure 2|Figure 2]]) to increase the number of branches.

{{anchor|Figure 2}}[[File:Business chess Scheme 2 - Eng.jpg|thumb|center|400px|Figure 2. Branching|alt=A diagram with one box above, labelled "before", and two below, labelled "after". The boxes are labelled with chess moves outside and a score inside (10 above, 7 and 3 below), and the box above has arrows to those below]]

To carry out a Branching the team on its move copies the position from board 1 to a free demonstration board, apply differing continuations (for example, on a demonstration board 1 move '''e4''', and on a board 2 – '''g3'''). In this case, the rating of the original (maternal) branch is distributed between the child branches according to the decision made by the team making the branch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AQKI0eZpW0|title=video about branching|work=youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the subsequent branching there will appear branches 3, 4, and 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7PFe_nz8M4|title=video about branches|work=youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If in the course of a game one of the teams gets a branch with a lost position (e.g. branch 1 in [[#Figure 3|Figure 3]]), then the team may resign the game in that branch and transfer all the chips of its rating to the demonstration board of another (parallel) branch, where the team has an undefeated position (e.g. branch 2). This represents the so-called '''Selection''', which offers a team a possibility of winning back what has been lost.

{{anchor|Figure 3}}[[File:Business chess Scheme 3R - Eng.jpg|thumb|center|400px|Figure 3. Selection.|alt=A diagram with three boxes showing the branches before, labelled as for the previous schemes, and two showing the branches after. One box "after" is thus eliminated. The total of the ratings in the boxes above equals the total for those in the branches below.]]

As a result of such a redistribution, the rating of the lost branch is added to the rating of the remaining one and the opponent gets points equal to the lost branch rating (in the given case, three points).

A Business chess game [[tree structure]] resulting from operations of Branching and Selection is shown in [[#Figure 4|Figure 4]].

{{anchor|Figure 4}}[[File:Business chess Scheme 4 - Eng.jpg|thumb|center|400px|Figure 4. A business chess game tree without chess passing. The rectangles denote branches (1 to 5) and their respective ratings (1 to 10)|alt=A complex diagram made up of several branches and selections, growing downwards to show the development of variant games as different moves are made. A points tally at each stage is given on the left.]]

On [[#Figure 4|Figure 4]] the increasing number of branches is shown (after move 7, there are already two branches, after move 11, three, after the move 12, four, and after move 18, five branches). Then, as a result of the selection and drawing (on moves 24, 25, 29 and 37, respectively) the number of branches gradually decreases. After move 37 and until the end of the game there remains only one branch, with a rating of eight.

A very important tactical element of the business chess scenario is chess '''Passing'''. Such a pass enables one to transfer, in a single move, one unit of rating from one branch to another without loss of points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffeh1oNxYRM|title=video of chess Passing|work=youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a way of adjusting branch ratings as the team reassesses their positions. The game tree with Passing has a more complicated form (see [[#Figure 5|Figure 5]]).

{{anchor|Figure 5}}[[File:Business chess Scheme 5 - Eng.jpg|thumb|center|400px|Figure 5. A business chess game tree with chess passing. The rectangles denote branches (1 to 5) and their respective ratings (1 to 10)]]

Only one member of the team may move pieces and ratings on the demonstration board after the team decides collectively. This stops players crowding in front of the demonstration boards. For this purpose the zone before the rows of demonstration boards is separated from the zone of team location by red lines which only one team member may cross.

=== Discussion {{anchor|Photo 3}} ===
[[File:Business chess Picture 4.JPG|thumb|right|350px|Photo 3. The Black team discussing one of the branches. In the background can be seen the White team in discussion.|alt=A picture of four men looking over a chessboard and gesticulating. In the background are other chess boards on tables, set up differently.]]
Each team is provided five ordinary chess boards to freely discuss positions and calculate variants ([[#Figure 1|Figure 1]]). At each board the team (or part of it) discusses the position arising in one of the branches of a game ([[#Photo 3|Photo 3]] and Video&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i9YHaSotkw|title=White|work=youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWGIxS-YZvE|title=Black|work=youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfHuPU0G2ro|title=One move in Business Chess : Black and White|work=youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The team itself determines how it organizes discussions and makes decisions. Interactive Cognitive Scenario only suggests the possibility of alternative actions of each team member (using branching) in combination with the possibility of subsequent rejection from them when it becomes clear for team that these actions were erroneous (using selection).

==Game parameters==
There is a huge number of possible ways the Interactive Cognitive Scenario can be realized. Therefore, before a game is played some parameters should be agreed:
* Initial game rating
* The number of demonstration boards (the maximum allowed number of branches)
* The number of players in each team and the rules for their replacement during the game
* The rules of branching, selection, distribution, redistribution and passing
* The time allowed for thinking over the moves and the form of time control.

==Spectators==

=== Focus on chess ===
During the game, spectators are able to hear and see team discussions: what information and in what scope the players analyze, how much and what options are offered for continuation, at what depth they are calculated, how the evaluations of positions changes during the passing and what final decisions are taken as a result. For the first time this becomes available for spectators' assessment directly, rather than via expert analysis.

The demonstration boards show several [[competition|competing]] versions of the game (branches). Their number and ratings change throughout the game and directly affect the current and final score of the game.

=== Focus on people ===
Business chess creates a team spirit and socio-psychological atmosphere that is not specific to chess. It may be of interest even for spectators who do not care much for chess.

Playing business chess brings out familiar social problems for the teams such as [[leadership]] and [[interpersonal compatibility|psychological compatibility]], a [[division of labor]] and specialization, choosing effective ways of [[management]] (authoritarian, democratic, etc.) and [[problem solving]], generating new ideas, their discussion, implementation and development in a competitive environment, and so on.

Spectators can also watch almost all varieties of situations typical in group [[competition]], and their continuous change, depending on the availability or shortage of advantages, time, alternative ways of development, and so on.

== Tournaments ==

Apart from being a sport, Business Chess can also be used for [[scientific modelling]] of mental activity,&lt;ref name="МП1"&gt;{{cite journal

|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; method of [[psychological evaluation]], psychological [[training]] and [[play therapy]].&lt;ref name="Book BC" /&gt; Such opportunity is conditioned by team active discussion and a multistage process of group decision-making based on [[sociocultural evolution]] depending on changing conditions ([[game]]). It can be seen that the main mechanisms of Interactive Cognitive Scenario (branching and selection) resemble biological mechanisms of [[evolution]] ([[genetic mutation]] and [[natural selection]]).

=== Scientific model ===
Business chess as a scientific model can be effectively used for researches in following areas:  [[game theory]], [[bifurcation theory]], [[information theory]], [[control theory]] and [[decision theory]], the theory of innovation diffusion, [[management science]], [[sociocultural evolution]], [[cognitive psychology]] and [[social psychology]], research into [[intelligence|natural intelligence]] and [[artificial intelligence]], and so on. Thus as an [[expert system]] the application of existing [[chess engine|chess computer programs]] is possible.

=== In school ===
Experts in the field of child psychology agree that the system of national school education must first [[socialization|socialize]] pupils, that is, accustom and adapt them for the life in [[social structure]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|isbn=978-5-09-019851-6
|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this purpose it is reasonable to use Business Chess as a general educational business game. The primary goal of similar lessons is to carry out intellectual and socially-psychological trainings for the pupils to make them skilled in constructive [[communication]], [[Competence (human resources)|communicative competence]], efficient [[Human resource management|management]], social [[self-organization]], psychological strength and adaptation in group. It is supposed,&lt;ref name="МП3"/&gt; that it promotes effective socialization and harmonious development of cogitative ([[Cognition|cognitive]]), behavioral ([[Interactivity|interactive]]) and emotional ([[motivation]]al) components of pupils' [[person]]ality studying at [[comprehensive school]]s.

It is also reasonable to use Business Chess for carrying out [[psychological evaluation]] at schools. The opportunity to register a lot of individual and group psychological parameters at the same time so as to observe their changes in dynamics, allows a complex estimation of [[intelligence]], [[aptitude]], level of achievement, personal situational correlations and mental development. Available [[expert systems]] in the form of modern [[Chess engine|chess computer programs]] enhance reliability of such researches.

A section of the "Business Chess" book is devoted to this subject,&lt;ref name="Book BC" /&gt; and also a lot of popular articles are included in the collection entitled "Sports business games: Business Chess, Go, Renju and others", 2007.&lt;ref name="Книга СДИ"&gt;{{cite book

In [[management]], '''business transformation''' involves making fundamental changes in how [[commerce | business]] is conducted in order to help cope with shifts in [[market environment]].&lt;ref&gt;
[http://hbr.org/2007/01/leading-change-why-transformation-efforts-fail/ar/1 Harvard Business Review] January 2007 Kotter
&lt;/ref&gt;

"Business Transformation is the process of fundamentally changing the systems, processes, people and technology across a whole business or business unit, to achieve measurable improvements in efficiency, effectiveness and stakeholder satisfaction. As such, a business transformation project is likely to include any number of change management projects, each focused on an individual process, system, technology, team or department."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.changeassociates.com/blog/post/what-is-business-transformation|title=Business Transformation|last=Cruise|first=David|date=14 Sep 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==When business transformation is used==
The need for business transformation may be caused by external changes in the market such as an organisation's products or services being out of date, funding or income streams being changed, new regulations coming into force or market competition becoming more intense. This management approach also incorporates [[Business Process Reengineering]] and is widely used:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/What_successful_transformations_share_McKinsey_Global_Survey_results_2550 McKinsey Survey] 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* to increase [[revenue]] or [[market share]]
* to improve [[customer satisfaction]]
* to [[cost-cutting|cut costs]]

==Components==
Business transformation is achieved by one or more of: realigning the way staff work, how the organisation is structured, the core product or service portfolio of the business and how technology is used. Typically organisations go through several stages in transforming themselves:&lt;ref&gt;[http://hbr.org/2007/01/leading-change-why-transformation-efforts-fail/ar/1 Harvard Business Review] January 2007 Kotter&lt;/ref&gt;
* recognising the need to change and gaining consensus amongst stakeholders that change is necessary
* agreeing what form the change should take, the objectives of the change and a [[vision (business)|vision]] that describes a better future
* understanding what the organization is changing from and what needs to change in detail 
* designing the new organisational way of working and its support and management
* testing and implementing changes, usually in waves, typically over a number of years
* bedding in the change so that the organisation cannot move back to how it was and achieves the intended benefits. 
Business transformation can lead to developing new competencies and making better use of existing competencies.&lt;ref&gt;Bak, O. (2016). Investigating Organizational Transformation in Automotive Supply Chains: A Case Study on B2B and Extranet. Strategic Change, 25(3), 299-314. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Transformation examples==
Examples of organisational transformation include:
* [[General Motors]]' transformation and restructuring&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/4ac676c4-f406-11df-886b-00144feab49a.html#axzz2GrGLsh8r Transformed GM back in the game] 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[BBC]]'s Delivering Quality First programme&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/insidethebbc/howwework/reports/deliveringqualityfirst.html BBC website] October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Box_(company)|Box]]'s pivot from consumer to enterprise &lt;ref&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2012/05/13/box-the-path-from-arringtons-backyard-to-a-billion-dollar-business/ Box: The Path From Arrington’s Backyard To A Billion Dollar Business] "Josh Stein started to connect the dots on doing an SaaS enterprise model. We credit him to being able to shine light for us on something we couldn’t see.” 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David T. Beers''' is a financial analyst and until December 2011 was head of sovereign credit ratings for [[credit rating agency]] [[Standard &amp; Poor's]] (S&amp;P).&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;Hasan, Mehdi (August 5, 2011).[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/aug/05/us-credit-rating-downgraded-moodys "The US should let its credit rating be downgraded – and shrug"]. ''Guardian''. Retrieved August 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2011, Beers earned significant attention as the S&amp;P executive responsible for downgrading the [[credit rating]] of [[United States Treasury security|United States Treasury bonds]] to [[Bond credit rating|AA+]]. Prior to this, the United States had maintained a AAA credit rating since 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Paletta, Damian (July 22, 2011). [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903554904576460393248353976 "Making the Call on U.S. Credit Rating"]. ''Wall Street Journal''. Retrieved August 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He lives in [[London]].&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/sampps-powerful-chief-steps-out-of-the-shadows-2333592.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Stephen | last=Foley | date=August 8, 2011 | title=S&amp;P's powerful chief steps out of the shadows}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2012, Beers announced his appointment, effective February 1, as Special Adviser to the Governor of the Bank of Canada.

==Education and career==
Beers received a B.A. degree in international relations from the [[University of Virginia]] and an M.Sc. degree in economics from the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE). He has since set up a scholarship at LSE in his name.&lt;ref name=Younglai&gt;Younglai, Rachelle; da Costa, Ana (August 2, 2011). [https://news.yahoo.com/insight-ratings-agencies-judge-world-172752099.html "When ratings agencies judge the world"]. ''Reuters'' (Yahoo!). Retrieved August 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Beers joined S&amp;P in 1990 focused on rating sovereign debt of over 100 countries. Prior to that, Beers had been an economist at [[Salomon Brothers]] focused on analyzing the creditworthiness of [[sovereign debt]]. He also worked at Bankers Trust Company, evaluating the risks of lending to Asia-Pacific countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Zask, Ezra |title=Global investment risk management: protecting international portfolios against currency, interest rate, equity, and commodity risk |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zJTjl3JhNr8C |accessdate=August 16, 2011 |year=2000 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |isbn=978-0-07-135315-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media perception==
Starting in the early 1970s, the "Big Three" ratings agencies (S&amp;P, Moody's, and Fitch) began to receive payment for their work by the securities issuers for whom they issue those ratings, which has led to charges that these ratings agencies can no longer always be impartial when issuing ratings for those securities issuers.&lt;ref name=Younglai/&gt;  Securities issuers have been accused of "shopping" for the best ratings from these three ratings agencies, in order to attract investors, until at least one of the agencies delivers favorable ratings. This arrangement has been cited as one of the primary causes of the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] which began in 2007.&lt;ref name=Younglai/&gt;

Although relatively unknown to the general public, Beers is one of the most influential people in the world: the ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' newspaper wrote in August 2011 that, "In recent weeks, we have witnessed elected leaders in the world's most powerful nation dancing to the tune of David Beers. He's the mustachioed, chain-smoking head of sovereign credit ratings for S&amp;P, the largest and arguably most influential member of the big three." [[Reuters]], meanwhile, said: "You may have never heard of David Beers but every finance minister in the world knows of him".&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; ''[[The Independent]]'' has said of Beers that he "might be the most powerful man in the world that you've never heard of."&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt;

'''Deutscher Konsumentenbund''' (German Consumers' Federation) is a European consumer [[advocacy group]] based in [[Kassel]]. It is a non-profit organization and registered with the [[European Commission]] to be a consumer rights lobby group&lt;ref&gt;[https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/transparency/regrin/consultation/listlobbyists.do?reset= Lobby-Register der EU-Kommission, Nr. 15615763186-36], visited 07/30/2011&lt;/ref&gt; with claimed 2,500 members.&lt;ref name="Impressum"&gt;[http://www.konsumentenbund.de/anbieterkennzeichnung Selbstdarstellung des Verbandes] visited 07/30/2011 (German)&lt;/ref&gt;  It submits stakeholder opinions to European Commission and appeared before the State government of [[Hesse]] in stakeholder hearing&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.konsumentenbund.de/blog/expertenanh%C3%B6rung-landeskartellbeh%C3%B6rde-ver%C3%B6ffentlicht-expertisen Expertenanhörung: Landeskartellbehörde veröffentlicht Expertisen], 07/30/2011 (German)&lt;/ref&gt; and Hessian anti-trust state authority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hessen.de/irj/HMWVL_Internet?cid=5108cc51bcc241ce5b4d378fc7c00c88 Vorträge der Veranstaltung Wasserpreise und -gebühren 09.

==Political positions==
The organisation is one of the few [[Europe]]an non-industrially backed groups that advocate [[free market|free market solutions]]&lt;ref name="Leitmotiv"&gt;[http://www.konsumentenbund.de/leitmotiv Leitmotiv des Deutschen Konsumentenbunds] visited 7/30/20111 (German).&lt;/ref&gt; that enhance transparency instead of tightening regulations and imposing paternalistic measures.

Also the organization strongly criticizes state-run monopoly structures, e.g. when supplying goods that are regarded "public goods", especially if reward is made by collection taxes (local rates) rather than demanding prices. It has been very active lobbying in favor of a reform on anti-trust laws to allow anti-trust authorities to control local monopoly structures by means of prices comparison and simulated competition in cases where no state of competition can be reached.

Deutscher Konsumentenbund criticizes local community tax laws currently in effect in Germany and has formed a coalition to alter or abolish the current legal structures.

==General consumer information and protection==
The organization offers general consumer information and consumer protection services publishing Rapex warnings in German language and offering assistance with so called "subscription traps" and Airline passenger rights.

==Fair Water Group==
Deutscher Konsumentenbund established a "Fair Water Group" that organizes grass root movements, individuals and organizations critical of the current legal framework for community taxation.

The '''Deville process''' was the first industrial process used to produce [[alumina]] from [[bauxite]].

The Frenchman [[Henri Sainte-Claire Deville]] invented the process in 1859.  It is sometimes called the Deville-[[Pechiney]] process.
It is based on the extraction of alumina with [[sodium carbonate]].

The first stage is the calcination of the bauxite at 1200&amp;nbsp;°C with [[sodium carbonate]] and [[coke (fuel)|coke]]. The alumina is converted in [[sodium aluminate]].  Iron oxide remains unchanged and silica forms a polysilicate.  

In the second stage [[sodium hydroxide]] solution is added, which dissolves the sodium aluminate, leaving the impurities as a solid residue.  The amount of sodium hydroxide solution needed depends upon the amount of silica present in the raw material. The solution is filtered off; [[carbon dioxide]] is bubbled through the solution, causing [[aluminium hydroxide]] to [[precipitate]], leaving a solution of sodium carbonate.  The latter can be recovered and reused in the first stage.

The aluminium hydroxide is [[calcined]] to produce alumina.

The process was used in France at [[Salindres ]] until 1923 and in Germany and Great Britain until the outbreak of the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = G.A.

[[Image:Graph 02 spending per country.jpg|thumb|Spending allocation per country.]]
[[Image:Who benefits from the ESF?.jpg|thumb|Spending by demographics.]]

The '''European Social Fund''' ('''ESF''') is the [[European Union]]'s main financial instrument for supporting employment in the [[member states of the European Union]] as well as promoting economic and social cohesion. ESF spending amounts to around 10% of the EU's total budget.

The ESF is one of the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF), which are dedicated to improving social cohesion and economic well-being across the regions of the Union. The funds are redistributive financial instruments that support cohesion within Europe by concentrating spending on the less-developed regions.

The particular aim of ESF spending is to support the creation of more and better jobs in the EU, which it does by co-funding national, regional and local projects that improve the levels of employment, the quality of jobs, and the inclusiveness of the labour market in the member states and their regions.

==History==
The European Social Fund was created in the founding [[Treaty of Rome]] in 1957.&lt;ref name="brine25"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brine|first1=Jacky|title=The European Social Fund and the EU: Flexibility, Growth, Stability|date=2002|publisher=Sheffield Academic Press|location=London|isbn=9781841271286|oclc=59470598|page=25|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DNPKDxTBnDQC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;dq=European+Social+Fund+1957&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KYT-SFBtja&amp;sig=un7Do0qUP9E8CxpYHY7O7YHJFcM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi637DzopzPAhVjKMAKHYXkBZ4Q6AEIODAE#v=onepage&amp;q=European%20Social%20Fund%201957&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the oldest of the [[Structural Funds]]. It was established as a "remedial instrument" against the end of nationalist protectionism due to the advent of the [[European Economic Community]].&lt;ref name="munzitheeuropeansocialfund"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Munzi|first1=Ugo|title=The European Social Fund in the Development of the Mediterranean Regions of the EEC|journal=Journal of International Affairs|date=1965|volume=19|issue=2|pages=286–296|jstor=24363303|registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015, the main goal is to foster employment, reduce social exclusion and invest in skills.&lt;ref name="govukeuropeansocialfund"&gt;{{cite web|title=England 2014 to 2020 European Structural and Investment Funds|url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/england-2014-to-2020-european-structural-and-investment-funds|website=Government of the United Kingdom|accessdate=September 19, 2016|date=July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some EU countries it also supports administrative reform.

==The place of the ESF in EU policies and strategies==
The overarching strategy of the European Union is the [[Europe 2020]] strategy, which aims to promote "smart, sustainable, inclusive growth" with greater coordination of national and European policies. In 2010 this succeeded the [[Lisbon Agenda]] which aimed to make Europe the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion, and respect for the environment, by 2010. The objectives of Europe 2020 shape the priorities of the ESF.

In the light of the need to increase competitiveness and employment against a background of [[globalisation]] and ageing populations, the European Employment Strategy&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=101&amp;langId=en European Employment Strategy] retrieved on 2008-10-14&lt;/ref&gt; provides a coordinating framework for the Member States to agree common priorities and goals in the field of employment. These common priorities are then taken up in the Employment Guidelines&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=108&amp;langId=en Employment Guidelines] retrieved on 2008-10-12&lt;/ref&gt; and incorporated into the National Reform Programmes&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/making-it-happen/country-specific-recommendations/2015/index_en.htm] National Reform Programmes retrieved on 2016-07-13&lt;/ref&gt; prepared by the individual Member States. ESF funding is deployed by the Member States in support of their National Reform Programmes as well as their National Strategic Reference Frameworks (NSRF) which establish a member state's main priorities for spending the EU Structural Funds it receives.

The European Social Agenda&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=547&amp;langId=en Social Agenda] retrieved on 2008-10-12&lt;/ref&gt; also plays a role in shaping the priorities of ESF spending. The Social Agenda seeks to update the '[[European social model]]' by modernising labour markets and social protection systems so that workers and businesses can benefit from the opportunities created by international competition, technological advances and changing population patterns while protecting the most vulnerable in society. In addition, the concept of '[[flexicurity]]' contributes to current ESF initiatives. [[Flexicurity]] can be defined as a policy strategy to enhance the flexibility of labour markets, work organisations and labour relations, on the one hand, and employment security and income security on the other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=102&amp;langId=en Flexicurity] retrieved on 2008-10-16&lt;/ref&gt; The term [[flexicurity]] encompasses a new approach to employment involving 'work for life' rather than the 'job for life' model of the past. It encourages workers to take charge of their working lives through lifelong training, adapting to change and mobility.

==Strategy definition==
The ESF is managed through seven-year programming cycles. The ESF strategy and budget is negotiated between the [[EU member states]], the [[European Parliament]] and the [[EU Commission]]. The strategy defines the objectives of ESF funding, which it shares partly or wholly with other structural funding. For the current ESF funding cycle these objectives are:
{{ordered list|type=none
| ''The regional competitiveness and employment objective'': to reinforce regional competitiveness, employment and attractiveness for investment.
| ''The convergence objective'': to stimulate growth and employment in the least-developed regions. This objective receives more than 80% of total ESF funding.
}}
The strategy also lays down broad priority axes – the actions required to achieve the objectives and which are eligible for funding.

==Funds allocation==
The level of ESF funding differs from one region to another depending on their relative wealth. EU regions are divided into four categories of eligible regions, based on their regional GDP per capita compared to the EU average (EU with 25 or 15 Member States) and split between the two objectives.

Convergence objective includes:
* convergence regions: with a GDP per capita of less than 75% of the EU-25 average; 
* phasing-out regions: with a GDP per capita of more than 75% of the EU-25 average but less than 75% of the EU-15 average.

The regional competitiveness and employment objective includes:
* phasing-in regions: with a GDP per capita of less than 75% of the EU-15 average (in the period 2000–2006) but more than 75% of the EU-15 average (in the period 2007–2013); 
* competitiveness and employment regions: applies to all other EU regions.

In convergence regions, ESF co-financing of projects can reach 85% of total costs. In regional competitiveness and employment regions, 50% co-financing is more common. For the richer Member States and regions, ESF funding complements existing national employment initiatives; for less-wealthy Member States, ESF funding can be the main source of funds for employment-related initiatives. The eligible regions for the current ESF programming round (2007–2013) are shown on the map.

While the allocation of funds to poorer regions intends to work towards the objective of convergence between regions (i.e. inter-regional equality), research has suggested that the funds may amplify intra-regional inequalities with for example in Poland richer municipalities receiving more funds than poorer municipalities within the regions. One explanation may lie in the co-financing procedures with poorer potential applicants being less likely to gather the required co-funding. Another issue with allocation has been that project applications have been rejected purely on minor administrative issues. While this has improved over time, research has shown that information provision and familiarity with application procedures is still a barrier in submitting applications for funds, and may play a larger role in than outright corruption in the selection process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dubois &amp; Fattore|first=HFW|date=26 July 2011|title=Public fund assignment through project evaluation|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13597566.2011.578827#abstract|journal=Regional and Federal Studies|doi=10.1080/13597566.2011.578827|pmid=|access-date=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
While strategy definition is done at EU level, implementation of ESF funding is the responsibility of EU Member States and regions. Once the strategy and budget allocation have been agreed, a shared approach to programming is taken. Seven-year Operational Programmes are planned by Member States and their regions together with the European Commission. These Operational Programmes describe the fields of activity that will be funded, which can be geographical or thematic.

The Member States designate national ESF management authorities that are responsible for selecting projects, disbursing funds, and evaluating the progress and results of projects. Certification and auditing authorities are also appointed to monitor and ensure compliance of expenditure to the ESF regulation.

Until 2007, approximately 5% of ESF funds were allocated to 'Community Initiatives' to support [[transnationality|transnational]] and innovative actions. They have addressed such issues as employment for women (NOW), disabled people (INTEGRA) and young people, new professions and qualifications (EUROFORM) and adaptability (ADAPT). The most recent of these, the [[EQUAL Community Initiative]], saw in the admission of 10 new Member States in 2004 but ended in 2008.

==ESF projects==
The implementation of the ESF on the ground is achieved through projects which are applied for and implemented by a wide range of organisations, both in the public and private sector. These include national, regional and local authorities, educational and training institutions, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the voluntary sector, as well as social partners, for example, trade unions and works councils, industry and professional associations, and individual companies.

The beneficiaries of ESF projects are varied, for example, individual workers, groups of people, industrial sectors, trades unions, public administrations or individual firms. Vulnerable groups of people who have particular difficulty in finding work or getting on in their jobs, such as the long-term unemployed and women, are a particular target group.  As an indication, it is estimated that over 9 million individuals from these vulnerable groups are helped each year through participation in ESF projects – see chart 1.

==The European Social Fund 2007–2013==
The last programming cycle of the ESF ran from 2007 to 2013 under the banner 'Investing in People'. Over this period, it invested around €75 billion – close to 10% of the EU budget – on employment-enhancing projects. Funding was given to six specific priority areas:

* Improving human capital (34% of total funding)
* Improving access to employment and sustainability (30%)
* Increasing the adaptability of workers and firms, enterprises and entrepreneurs (18%)
* Improving the social inclusion of less-favoured persons (14%)
* Strengthening institutional capacity at national, regional and local levels (3%)
* Mobilisation for reforms in the fields of employment and inclusion (1%)

In any given region, the actual distribution of funds varied to reflect local and regional priorities. All six priorities were applicable to both the convergence and regional competitiveness and employment objectives; however, convergence would normally place an emphasis on the ‘improving human capital’ priority.

Since 2010, the [[European Union]] has launched three separate [[antitrust]] investigations into [[Google]] for violating the [[European Union competition law|EU's competition laws]] due to its dominant position in the market. These cases have resulted in formal charges against Google related to [[Google Shopping]], [[Google AdSense]] and the [[Android (operating system)|Android operating system]]. To date, Google has been found guilty of antitrust behavior in the cases related to Google Shopping and Android, and have been fined over {{€|6 billion}}.

== Google Shopping charges ==
On 10 November 2010, the European Commission opened a formal investigation into Google's search algorithm, following a number of complaints issued by smaller web companies that Google was downgrading their placement in results returned in Google's search results, and that Google was preferentially favoring their own products over competitors. The EC's investigation also considered if there were issues with Google's terms of use for [[Google AdSense]] that prevented those using AdSense to not use advertising from Google's competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/01/technology/01google.html | title = Europe Opens Antitrust Inquiry Into Google | first1 = James | last1 = Kanter | first2 = Eric | last2 = Pfanner | date = 30 November 2010 | accessdate = 18 October 2018 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 April 2015, five years into the investigation, the EC issued its first Statement of Objections towards Google related towards its preferential treatment of its [[Google Shopping]] product (including Google Product Search) in search results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-32315649 | title = EU accuses Google Shopping of search 'abuse' | date =15 April 2015 | accessdate = 18 October 2018 | work = [[BBC]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The specific complaints issued by the EC included:&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-15-4781_en.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Google's search results predominate display Google Shopping results regardless of the merits of how well the Google Shopping results met the results of the search query.
* Google does not apply its system of penalties, a predefined set of parameters to lower the placement of shopping results, to its own Google Shopping results as it did to other competitors.
* Google had already attempted a shopping product, Froogle, but which it did not give any preferential treatment, and as a result, performed poorly. In contrast, Google Shopping was given favorable placement in Google's search result, allowing the service to achieve higher rates of growth.
* Google's favoring of Google Shopping thus had a negative impact on consumers and innovation.

=== Decision and impact ===
On 7 June 2017, Google was found guilty and was charged {{€|2.4 billion}} (about {{USD|2.7 billion}}), the largest such antitrust fine issued by the EC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/google-buys-android/|title=Google buys Android|last=Olsen|first=Stefanie|date=8 October 2007|work=CNET|access-date=10 November 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;Google has denied the European Union's accusations against them and made a statement claiming “its services had helped the region's digital economy grow”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/27/technology/eu-google-fine.html|title=Google Fined Record $2.7 Billion in E.U. Antitrust Ruling|last=Scott|first=Mark|date=27 June 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=10 November 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fine represented just over 2.5% of Google's 2016 revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/06/27/technology/business/google-eu-antitrust-fine/index.html|title=EU slaps Google with record $2.7 billion fine|first=Ivana|last=Kottasová|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who are in competition with Google are pushing for their company to be individually monitored, for fear of losing more business to the dominant search engine. This would include investigating and overviewing Google's most prized search page algorithm, [[PageRank]]. The EU's Competition Commission decided to monitor their decision and Google's compliance with it, due to its obligation to report to the EUCC on a regular basis (every four months). Although the issue seems like it is at a close, the European Commission believes it will continue for some time.

In order to comply, Google is effectively separating its comparison shopping service into its own company after the fine. The Google Shopping service still will be a part of Google, but will run completely separately with its own revenues and profits. This move will allow Google to avoid further fines, according to [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]], as it complies with the European Union's order of allowing even treatment to businesses, no matter if they compete with Google or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2017/09/26/google-create-shopping-unit-appease-european-union-antitrust-regulators/706277001/|title=Google rolls out shopping ad changes to appease European Union antitrust regulators|last=Guynn|first=Jessica|date=26 September 2017|work=USA TODAY|access-date=10 November 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, even though Google is complying in part, the company is still appealing the decision. Google responded in its appeal papers to the EU Antitrust Fine by stating that the EU chair misstated facts and didn’t show enough evidence to prove that their site hurt rivals. Google wants the fine either overturned or reduced. The appeal was based on six arguments, with two of them being that the court didn’t prove that Google favored its own shopping service by placing paid ads on top the search results. Two of them stated that the courts misstated facts and evidence, and the other two argued that a fine wasn’t warranted as a possible penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/alphabets-google-responds-to-eu-antitrust-fine-1509388512|title=Alphabet’s Google Responds to EU Antitrust Fine|last=Drozdiak|first=Natalia|date=30 October 2017|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=10 November 2017|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Google AdSense charges ==
While investigating the case related to Google Shopping, the EC found additional evidence related to potential antitrust issues related to [[Google AdSense]], and issued a Statement of Complaints on 14 July 2016. These complaints were centered on how Google licensed AdSense to their direct partners:&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-2532_en.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Google required direct partners to exclusively to Google's AdSense and could not engage with Google's competitors;
* Google required that partners take a minimum number of Google ads and predominately place them above any other advertising, nor could place ads from other services above or alongside Google's ads;
* Google required partners get confirmation from Google before making any changes for how they displayed Google's competitors' ads.

This case, as of October 2018, still remains under investigation by the EC.

== Android and mobile apps charges ==
=== Prior complaints ===
The EC's actions to investigate Google's approach to the Android operating system was predicated on two complaints it had received. The first complain came from [[FairSearch]]. FairSearch was established in 2010 as a coalition of travel-related web companies including [[Expedia]] and [[TripAdvisor]] to try to fight against Google's proposed acquisition of [[ITA Software|ITA]], which had developed airfare search software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wasserman|first1=Elizabeth|title=DOJ threatens to nix Google merger|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0211/50147.html|accessdate=30 December 2014|date=24 February 2011 | work = [[Politico]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group shifted towards becoming more of a Google watchdog group, looking at all instances of Google's activities which they considered were potentially anti-competition. Companies like [[Microsoft]], [[Nokia]], and [[Oracle]] joined the group to support this broader effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/12/4216026/who-is-fairsearch | title=  What is FairSearch and why does it hate Google so much? | first =Vlad | last = Savov | date = 12 April 2013 | accessdate = 18 October 2018 | work = [[The Verge]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to their attention to the Android system, FairSearch issued complaints to the EC over how Google's search engines would preferentially weight results from Google's own services or its partners over others, as part of antitrust investigations conducted by the EU since 2010.&lt;ref name="fairsearch complaint"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/8/4203684/microsoft-others-file-eu-antitrust-complaint-over-android-bundling | title = Microsoft and others file EU antitrust complaint over Android app bundling | first =  Jeff | last = Blagdon | date = 8 April 2013 | accessdate = 18 October 2018 | work = [[The Verge]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2013, the European branch of FairSearch filed a formal complaint to the EU, who were still investigating Google from previous complaints, citing that Google's practices with Android violated various [[European Union competition law|EU's antitrust laws]]. The complaint identified that Google required any original equipment manufacturer (OEM) wanting to install Google's suite of Android apps, including access to the [[Google Play Store]], had to license the entire suite and feature them predominately on the mobile device.&lt;ref name="fairsearch complaint"/&gt; 

A second anti-trust complaint against Google was filed by [[Aptoide]] in June 2014, an alternative marketplace for Android apps. Aptoide asserted that Google's approach to Google made it difficult for alternatives to the Google Play store to be installed, and that some of the components that were once part of Google's Android Open Source Project were moved into the Google Mobile Services suite, including Gmail, Google Maps, and the Play Store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.cnet.com/news/google-abusing-its-android-power-says-third-party-app-store-ceo/ | title = Google is abusing its Play power, says third-party Android app store CEO | first = Luke | last =Westaway | date = 17 June 2014 | accessdate = 18 October 2018 | work = [[CNet]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== EU's investigation ===
On 15 April 2015, the European Commission started an official investigation against Google following on the complaints filed by FairSearch and Apotoide and its own internal evaluation of these complaints over about a year. The EC stated that the company may have taken unlawful actions to maintain Google's [[Dominance (economics)|dominant position]] in the mobile market by how it licensed its suite of Android applications. The new investigation was announced alongside the EC's findings in its antitrust investigation into Google's search engine practices, but otherwise treated as a separate action against Google.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/16/business/international/european-union-google-antitrust-case.html | title = Europe Challenges Google, Seeing Violations of Its Antitrust Law | first1 = James | last1 = Kanter | first2 = Mark | last2 = Scott | date = 16 April 2015 | accessdate = 18 October 2018 | work =[[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission identified three points of concern in the first Statement of Objections:&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-15-4782_en.htm Antitrust: Commission opens formal investigation against Google in relation to Android mobile operating system], ''europa.eu'' (15 April 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

# Whether Google actions impede development of the market of mobile devices and access of competitors thereto by demanding or encouraging smart phone manufacturers to [[Pre-installed software|pre-install]] Google apps and services on their devices.
# Whether Google suppressed attempts of smart phone and tablet PC manufacturers willing to install Google apps on their devices to run on modified and potentially competitive versions of Android.
# Whether Google unlawfully impeded the market development by way of tacking the installation of certain Google apps with the use of other apps of this company or its software interface.

Google countered to this investigation that their practices with Android were no different with how [[Apple, Inc.]] or [[Microsoft]] bundles their own proprietary apps on their respective [[iOS]] and [[Windows Phone]], and that OEMs were still able to distribute Android-based phones without the Google suite of apps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.fastcompany.com/3045132/read-googles-defensive-response-to-european-antitrust-charges | title = Read Google’s Defensive Response To European Antitrust Charges | first= David | last = Lumb | date = 16 April 2015 | accessdate = 18 October 2018 | work = [[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the investigation, Google formed [[Alphabet Inc.]], a [[holding company]] for Google's various subsidiaries, with Google becoming one of Alphabet's subsidiaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-creates-new-company-alphabet-1439240645 |title=Google Creates Parent Company Called Alphabet in Restructuring |last=Chen |first=Angela |date=10 August 2015 |publisher=Wall Street Journal |accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A year after, on 20 April 2016, the European Commission announced the issue of the second Statement of Objections, now addressing both Google and Alphabet within its charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/21/technology/google-europe-antitrust.html | title=  E.U. Charges Dispute Google’s Claims That Android Is Open to All | first = Mark | last =Scott | date = 20 April 2016 | accessdate=  18 October 2018 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new set of complaints, amending those of the first Statement of Objections, asserted Google violated EU's antitrust laws by:&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-1492_en.htm Antitrust: Commission sends Statement of Objections to Google on Android operating system and applications], ''europa.eu'' (20 April 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;
* by requiring mobile manufacturers to pre-install Google Search and Google Chrome browser and requiring them to set Google Search as default search service on their devices, as a condition to license certain Google proprietary apps;
* by preventing manufacturers from selling smart mobile devices running on competing operating systems based on the Android [[Open-source software|open source code]];
* by giving financial incentives to manufacturers and mobile network operators on condition that they exclusively pre-install Google Search on their devices.

The potential fines for the case, if Google were to be found violating antitrust laws, has a maximum amount of 10% of the company's annual revenue, about {{USD|7.4 billion}} at the time of the issuing of the Second Statement of Objection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/20/eu-commission-google-android-skew-market-competition-antitrust-vestager/ | title = AEU accuses Google of using Android to skew market against rivals | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = 20 April 2016 | accessdate = 20 April 2016 | first = Jennifer | last= Rankin }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decision and impact ===
On 19 July 2018, EU has fined Google {{€|4.3&amp;nbsp;billion}} (about {{USD|5 billion}}). Google responded it would appeal, according to company spokesperson Al Verney "Android has created more choice for everyone, not less". To date, this fine is the biggest ever imposed by European Union on a company for anti-competitive behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Google fined €4.3 billion by EU regulator |url=https://www.dw.com/en/google-fined-43-billion-by-eu-regulator/a-44719609 |website=[[Deutsche Welle]] |accessdate=28 July 2018 |language=en |date=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; European Union Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who was part of the decision against Google, stated that only after the EU found against Google in the search anti-trust case in 2017 did Google attempt to settle on the issues of the Android anti-trust issues, which was far too late after the EU filed the initial charges against Google.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-22/the-story-behind-google-s-secret-offer-to-settle-android-probe | title = The Story Behind Google's Secret Offer to Settle EU’s Android Probe | first1 =  Aoife  | last1 = White | first2=  Stephanie | last2  = Bodoni | date = 22 July 2018 | accessdate = 22 July 2018 | work = [[Bloomberg LP]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''executive director''' is a [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) or [[managing director]] of an [[organization]], [[company (law)|company]], or [[corporation]]. The title is widely used in [[North America]]n [[non-profit organization]]s, though many [[United States]] nonprofits have adopted the title [[president (corporate title)|president]] or CEO.&lt;ref&gt;''Policy vs. Paper Clips: Selling the Corporate Model to Your Nonprofit Board'', Eugene H. Fram with Vicki Brown, 1995, 2nd Edition, Families International, Milwaukee, WI&lt;/ref&gt;

Confusion can arise because the words ''executive'' and ''director'' occur both in this title and in titles of various members of some organizations' boards of directors. The precise meanings of these terms are discussed in the [[board of directors]] article.

==Role==
The role of the executive director is to design, develop and implement strategic plans for the organization in a manner that is both cost and time-efficient. The executive director is also responsible for the day-to-day operation of the organization, which includes managing committees and staff as well as developing business plans in collaboration with the board. In essence, the board grants the executive director the authority to run the organization.{{Fact|date=November 2012}} The executive director is accountable to the chairman of the board of directors and reports to the board on a regular basis – quarterly, semiannually, or annually. The board may offer suggestions and ideas about how to improve the organization, but the executive director decides whether or not, and how, to implement these ideas.

The executive director is a [[leadership]] role for an organization and often fulfills a [[motivation]]al role in addition to office-based work. Executive directors motivate and mentor members, volunteers, and staff, and may chair meetings. The executive director leads the organization and develops its [[organizational culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles W. L. Hill, and Gareth R. Jones, (2001) ''Strategic Management''. Houghton Mifflin.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the title suggests, the executive director needs to be informed of everything that goes on in the organization.{{Fact|date=August 2015}} This includes staff, membership, budget, company assets, and all other company resources, to help make the best use of them and raise the organization's profitability and profile.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1013">'''ISA 400 Risk Assessments and Internal Control''' is one of the [[International Standards on Auditing]]. It serves to require the [[auditor]] to understand the client's [[accounting system]] and [[internal control]] system and to assess [[control risk]] and [[Inherent risk (accounting)|inherent risk]]. The objective is to determine the nature, timing and extent of [[substantive procedures]] in order to reduce [[audit risk]] to an acceptable low level.  

ISA 400 talks about the "walk through testing" or auditing in depth test.

This standard was withdrawn in 2004, and has been replaced with the ISA 315, “Understanding the Entity and Its Environment and Assessing the Risks of Material Misstatement” and the ISA 330, “The Auditor’s Procedures in Response to Assessed Risks”{{citation needed|date = December 2012}}

'''''In Praise of Hard Industries''''' is a book about the economic impact of fewer [[manufacturing]] jobs in the [[United States]] written by Irish journalist and author [[Eamonn Fingleton]]. It was published in 1999. The book was reissued in a 2003 paperback edition under the title ''Unsustainable: How Economic Dogma Is Destroying American Prosperity''.

The book argues that the shift in the American work-force from industry to [[knowledge worker]]s was setting the country up for an economic collapse. It criticizes financial innovation as a ruse to sell complex [[financial instrument]]s and urged for more advanced manufacturing in the United States. The book argues that industrial activities create jobs and exports, and that job salaries would be protected in environments using high-end equipment.

In its first chapter, the book enunciates the “Three Strikes Against the New Economy”: a bad job mix, slow income growth. and a dearth of exports.

==Reception==
The book elicited strong and mixed responses.  Liberal economist [[James K. Galbraith]] said in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that Fingleton was “the sort of journalist economists despise,” arguing that the book was “anecdotal, spurning statistics or other corroboration” and that it overstated the decline of American manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 12, 1999|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/09/12/reviews/990912.12galbrat.html|title=Made in the U.S.A. A journalist looks at America's economic future and finds it is in manufacturing|first=James|last=Galbraith}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative economist [[George C. Leef]] commented that his snap judgment based on the cover was that it was “a lousy book” and that upon reading it, it “turned out to be far worse than I had guessed.”&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/Freeman-2000aug-00055|first=George|last=Leef|title=Book Reviews|work=The Freeman/Ideas on Liberty|date=August 2000|pages=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Paul Craig Roberts]]&lt;ref name="counterpunch" /&gt; and activist Loren Goldner&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://home.earthlink.net/~lrgoldner/fingleton.html|first=Loren|last=Goldner|title=Presentation / Critique of Eamonn Fingleton, In Praise of Hard Industries: Why Manufacturing, Not the Information Economy, Is the Key to Future Prosperity (1999)|accessdate=November 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; both supported the book's message. Roberts viewed the book as substantially vindicated by the Wall Street [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008#US stock market|crash of 2007-2008]] as well as by the earlier [[dot.com bust]] of the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="counterpunch"&gt;Paul Craig Roberts, "How the Economy was Lost" ''Counterpunch'' Feb.  24, 2009 [http://www.counterpunch.org/2009/02/24/how-the-economy-was-lost/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Himu lived in Canada, where he met and married a Japanese woman; the two came to Japan together in 1995.&lt;ref name="JapanTimes"&gt;{{citation|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/print/nn20050402f4.html|date=2 April 2005|accessdate=15 January 2008|title=Alleged al-Qaeda link seeks vindication; Bangladeshi wants apology, claims he was falsely accused by police, press|periodical=The Japan Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; After moving to Japan, he lived in [[Toda, Saitama|Toda]], [[Saitama Prefecture]], and had two children with his wife.&lt;ref name="Wrecked"&gt;{{citation|title=Antiterrorism drive wrecks Muslim's life|periodical=The Daily Yomiuri; Asia Africa Intelligence Wire|date=18 December 2004|accessdate=15 January 2008 |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-18263340_ITM}}&lt;/ref&gt; He established a telecommunications business, Ryo International, in 1995, which sold prepaid telephone cards and mobile phones; it had been growing rapidly, from [[Japanese yen|¥]]40&amp;nbsp;million of sales in 2000 to ¥350&amp;nbsp;million in 2001 and ¥800&amp;nbsp;million in 2003. He gained permanent residency in Japan in 2000.&lt;ref name="JapanTimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Times20040526"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/article432943.ece|date=26 May 2004|accessdate=15 January 2008|title=Japan makes first al-Qaeda arrests in dawn raids|periodical=The Times|last=Parry|first=Richard Lloyd | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jiji"&gt;{{citation|periodical=Jiji Press; Asia Africa Intelligence Wire |title=Massive Fund Transfers from Japan to al-Qaeda Suspected |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-21481932_ITM |date=27 May 2004|accessdate=15 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had an office in Tokyo's [[Akihabara]] district as well a branch in [[Yokosuka]], where he employed three [[Filipinos in Japan|Filipina immigrants]], but rarely visited the Yokosuka office, according to the building's owner.&lt;ref name="Times20040526"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jiji"/&gt;&lt;ref name="StarsAndStripes"&gt;{{citation|periodical=Stars and Stripes|url=http://www.stripes.com/article.asp?section=104&amp;article=21606&amp;archive=true|title=Reports place al-Qaida suspect on Yokosuka Naval Base|date=29 May 2004|accessdate=15 January 2008|last=Montgomery|first=Nancy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest and release==
Himu was arrested in a dawn raid on 26 May 2004 in Tokyo on charges of falsifying business-related documents; police targeted him because of his alleged connection to French fugitive [[Lionel Dumont]], who had stayed in Japan between 2002 and 2003.&lt;ref name="Times20040526"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jiji"/&gt; He had met Dumont at a mosque in [[Isesaki]], [[Gunma Prefecture]] in 1999; eager to do business, Himu gave Dupont his namecard, and sold him several phone cards.&lt;ref name="Wrecked"/&gt; Police also raided the branch office in Yokosuka, where they arrested a Bangladeshi employee of Himu's.&lt;ref name="StarsAndStripes"/&gt; The media referred to him as "Japan's first suspected Islamic terrorist", while [[United States Forces Japan]] spokesmen claimed he had been seen at the [[United States Fleet Activities Yokosuka|Yokosuka Naval Base]] directly across from his office "gathering intelligence".&lt;ref name="Times20040526"/&gt;&lt;ref name="StarsAndStripes"/&gt; He had been under surveillance for nearly a year before the arrest, according to Japanese media reports.&lt;ref name="StarsAndStripes"/&gt;

Himu was indicted on 7 July 2004 by the [[Tokyo Summary Court]], which ordered him to pay a fine of [[Japanese yen|¥]]300,000 for his violation of the [[Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Law]], consisting of having employed his younger brother and another illegal foreign resident between August 2001 and May 2004. Following his payment of the fine, he was released.&lt;ref name="Yomiuri"&gt;{{citation|periodical=The Daily Yomiuri; Asia Africa Intelligence Wire|title=Man held in terror probe freed after paying fine|date=9 July 2004|accessdate=15 January 2008|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-21928848_ITM}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecutors declined to indict him on any charges relating to alleged al-Qaeda connections.&lt;ref name="JapanTimes"/&gt;

==Lawsuit==
After Himu's release, he found his business and his life disrupted; his employees had all departed, and bills he had been unable to collect while in custody while his suppliers waited for payment left him with ¥120 million in debt. Many of his former associates declined to do business with him any more; transportation companies even refused to ship his products. Eventually, with his business bankrupt, he closed down his existing offices and opened up a new business under a different name.&lt;ref name="Wrecked"/&gt; Several countries also barred him from obtaining a visa due to the unproven allegations.&lt;ref name="JapanTimes"/&gt;

In April 2005, Himu filed a human rights complaint with the [[Japan Federation of Bar Associations]], hoping to gain a public apology from senior police officials and the [[Media of Japan|Japanese media]], whom he accused of having "ruined [his] life".&lt;ref name="JapanTimes"/&gt; In October of that year, he also filed libel suits in the [[Tokyo District Court]] in his own name and that of his company against various media organisations, including [[Kyodo News]] and the [[Nippon Television Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|periodical=The Japan Times|date=6 October 2005|accessdate=15 January 2008|title=Bangladeshi sues Kyodo for libel|url=http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article-eastasia.asp?parentid=31028}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2007, the Tokyo District Court ordered the ''[[Sankei Shimbun]]'' to pay Himu in compensation for their having published a front-page report giving his true name and falsely claiming he was a "top terrorist"; the court stated that the publication of his name was inappropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://mdn.mainichi.jp/national/news/20071211p2a00m0na027000c.html|periodical=Mainichi Shimbun|title=Sankei newspaper ordered to compensate foreigner over Al Qaeda slur|date=11 December 2007|accessdate=15 January 2008|archivedate=11 January 2008|archiveurl=http://google.com/search?q=cache:FMjWyXBFe78J:mdn.mainichi.jp/national/news/20071211p2a00m0na027000c.htm&amp;hl=zh-TW&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=6&amp;gl=hk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Ames Mitchell''' (January 17, 1845 – June 29, 1918) was a publisher, architect, artist and novelist from the United States. He was regarded as a Renaissance man who kept to himself but influenced many.

==Biography==
Mitchell was a [[Harvard University]] educated architect who studied at the [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris. In 1883 he co-founded ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine with [[Andrew Miller (publisher)|Andrew Miller]]. Serving as president, Mitchell held a 75 percent interest in the magazine with the remainder by Miller in his job as secretary-treasurer. Both men retained their holdings until their deaths.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/miscellaneousre11yorkgoog/miscellaneousre11yorkgoog_djvu.txt Full text of "The miscellaneous reports : cases decided in the inferior courts of record of the state of New York"]&lt;/ref&gt; Much more like today's ''New Yorker'' than the ''Life'' of the later 20th century, Mitchell's magazine discovered and encouraged many fine writers and artists at the turn of the century, such as [[Charles Dana Gibson]], the illustrator who created the [[Gibson Girl]]. It covered the literary scene as well as political and social issues. He and [[Horace Greeley]] of the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' founded the [[Fresh Air Fund]], which for many years operated the [[fresh air camp|Life Fresh Air camp]] for city kids on the site of today's Branchville School in [[Ridgefield, Connecticut]], the town in which Mitchell also lived.

In 1875, Ames was hired by his uncle, [[Oliver Ames, Jr.]], to design the [[Unity Church of North Easton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Ames Mitchell|url=http://evelinaames.com/tag/john-ames-mitchell/|website=Evelin Ames|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitchell penned a half dozen novels, the most famous of which, ''Amos Judd'' (1895), was made into the 1922 silent film, ''[[The Young Rajah]]'', starring [[Rudolph Valentino]]. ''Life'' was purchased in 1936 by another Ridgefield resident, [[Henry Luce]], who turned it into a picture-oriented magazine. The headquarters of Mitchell's ''Life'' is now the Herald Square Hotel in New York, a gift to Mitchell from [[Charles Dana Gibson]] in appreciation of the publisher's having seen and developed his potential as an artist.

==Death and burial==
Mitchell died suddenly on June 29, 1918 at his home in Ridgefield, Connecticut, of [[apoplexy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituaries|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1918/06/30/98267762.html?pageNumber=19|accessdate=23 February 2016|publisher=The New York Times|date=30 June 1918|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is buried in Fairlawn Cemetery in Ridgefield. Windover, his estate, was subdivided years ago, but the main house is still on West Lane. Its owner also operates the Herald Square Hotel, once Mitchell's ''Life'' headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jackfsanders.tripod.com/whoswho.htm ''Notable Ridgefielders''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508232804/http://jackfsanders.tripod.com/whoswho.htm |date=May 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph Hodges Choate''' (January 24, 1832 – May 14, 1917) was an [[United States|American]] lawyer and diplomat.  Choate was associated with many of the most famous [[litigation]]s in American legal history, including the [[Kansas]] [[prohibition]] cases, the [[Chinese exclusion]] cases, the [[Isaac H. Maynard]] election returns case, the [[Income Tax Suit]], and the [[Samuel J. Tilden]], [[Jane Stanford]], and [[Alexander Turney Stewart]] will cases. In the public sphere, he was influential in the founding of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/3253830|jstor=3253830|title=Address of Joseph H. Choate: At the Opening of the Museum Building March 30, 1880|journal=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin|volume=12|issue=6|pages=126|year=1917}} "To
him in large degree the Museum owes the breadth of its original scope, embracing all arts and embracing art in its relation to education and practical life as well as to the enjoyment of the beautiful."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Choate was born in [[Salem, Massachusetts]], on January 24, 1832. He was the son of Margaret Manning (Hodges) and physician George Choate, and the brother of physician [[George Cheyne Shattuck Choate]]. His father's first cousin was [[Rufus Choate]]. After graduating from [[Harvard College]] in 1852 and [[Harvard Law School]] in 1854, he was admitted first to the Massachusetts (1855) and then (1856) to the New York bar, and entered the law office of Scudder &amp; Carter in [[New York City]].

His success in his profession was immediate, and in 1860 he became junior partner in the firm of Evarts, Southmayd &amp; Choate, the senior partner in which was [[William M. Evarts]]. This firm and its successor, that of Evarts, Choate &amp; Beaman, remained for many years among the leading law firms of New York and of the country, the activities of both being national rather than local.
[[File:Mrs Joseph Hodges Choate, née Caroline Dutcher Sterling.jpg|thumb|Mrs Joseph Hodges Choate, photographed 13 May 1902. ]]
On October 16, 1861, he married Caroline Dutcher Sterling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Joseph H. Choate, 80, Married 50 Years. Celebrates Golden Wedding with Mrs. Choate and Relatives at Naumkeag in Berkshires. |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1911/10/16/104839622.pdf |quote= |work=[[New York Times]] |date=1911-10-16 |accessdate=2008-12-17 | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During these busy years, Choate was associated with many of the most famous legal cases in American legal history, including the [[Samuel J. Tilden|Tilden]], [[Alexander Turney Stewart]], and [[Jane Stanford]] will cases, the [[Kansas]] [[prohibition]] cases, the [[Chinese exclusion]] cases, the [[Isaac H. Maynard]] election returns case, and the [[Income Tax Suit]].  In 1871 be became a member of the [[Committee of 70 (New York City)|Committee of Seventy]] in [[New York City]], which was instrumental in breaking up the [[Tweed Ring]], and later assisted in the prosecution of the indicted officials. He served as president of the [[American Bar Association]], the [[New York State Bar Association]], and the [[New York City Bar Association]]. In the retrial of the [[Fitz John Porter|General Fitz-John Porter]] case he obtained a reversal of the decision of the original court-martial.

His greatest reputation was won perhaps in cross-examination. In politics he allied himself with the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] on its organization, being a frequent speaker in presidential campaigns, beginning with that of 1856. He never held political office, although he was a candidate for the Republican U.S. senatorial nomination for New York against Senator [[Thomas C. Platt]] in 1897. In 1894 he was president of the New York state constitutional convention.

He was appointed, by [[William McKinley|President McKinley]], [[U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom]] to succeed [[John Hay]] in 1899, and remained in this position until the spring of 1905. In England he won great personal popularity, and accomplished much in fostering the good relations of the two great English-speaking powers. He was one of the representatives of the United States at the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)#Hague Convention of 1907|second Peace Congress at the Hague]] in 1907.

Upon the outbreak of the [[World War I]], he ardently supported the cause of the [[Triple Entente|Allies]]. He severely criticized [[Woodrow Wilson|President Wilson]]'s hesitation to recommend America's immediate cooperation, but shortly before his death retracted his criticism. He was chairman of the [[Mayor of New York City|mayor]]'s committee in New York for entertaining the British and French commissions in 1917. His death was hastened by the physical strain of his constant activities in this connection.

Choate died on May 14, 1917, in Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Joseph Hodges Choate Dies Suddenly. |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A01E0DC123AE433A25756C1A9639C946696D6CF |quote=Joseph H. Choate died suddenly late last night at his residence, 8 East Sixtythird Street, of a heart attack. He had complained of feeling ill during the day and had retired early, but there was no physician with him when the end came. He breathed his last at 11:30. Mrs. Choate and their daughter, Miss Mabel, were at his side. |work=[[New York Times]] |date=May 15, 1917 |accessdate=2009-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was interred in the family mausoleum at [[Woodlawn Cemetery, Bronx|Woodlawn Cemetery]] in [[The Bronx]], New York City, but was subsequently later buried in the Stockbridge Cemetery, Stockbridge, Massachusetts, near Naumkeag, his family summer house.

==Works==
* ''Abraham Lincoln and Other Addresses in England'' (1910)
* ''American Addresses'' (1911)

==Legacy==
He was awarded an [[honorary doctorate]] ([[LL.D.]]) by the [[University of Edinburgh]] in March 1900,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=University intelligence|day_of_week=Saturday |date=3 March 1900 |page_number=8 |issue=36080| }}&lt;/ref&gt; another LL.D. from [[Yale University]] in October 1901, during celebrations for the bicentenary of the university,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=United States|day_of_week=Thursday |date=24 October 1901 |page_number=3 |issue=36594| }}&lt;/ref&gt; and an honorary doctorate ([[D.C.L.]]) by the [[University of Oxford]] in June 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=University intelligence |day_of_week=Saturday |date=7 June 1902 |page_number=9 |issue=36788| }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, two years after his death, members of the [[Harvard Club of New York City]] established the Joseph Hodges Choate Memorial Fellowship at [[Harvard University]] to commemorate his life and legacy.

'''José Plácido de Castro''' (9 September 1873 – 11 August 1908) was a Brazilian soldier, surveyor, rubber producer and politician who led the armed revolt during the [[Acre War]] of 1902–03, when the [[Republic of Acre]] broke away from [[Bolivia]]. He was the president of the state of Acre just before and after it was purchased by Brazil. After the war he became extremely wealthy as a rubber producer, and made many enemies. He was assassinated in 1908. He is considered a hero of Brazil.

==Early years==
José Plácido de Castro was born on 9 September 1873 in [[São Gabriel, Rio Grande do Sul]].
His great grandfather had served in the 1801 war in which the [[Missões]] territory was annexed to [[Rio Grande do Sul]] and his grandfather had fought in the 1820s [[Cisplatine War]] between the [[United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata]] and the [[Empire of Brazil]].{{sfn|Herói Brasileiro: Plácido de Castro}}
His father, captain Prudente da Fonseca Castro, fought in [[Uruguay]] and in the [[Paraguayan War]] (1864–70).
His mother was Zeferina de Oliveira Castro.{{sfn|Carlos Fernandes}}

His father died when he was twelve years old, and Plácido de Castro had to work to help support his mother and six brothers.
He took various jobs before joining the 1st Regiment of Field Artillery in 1889 at the age of 16.{{sfn|Senador Jorge Viana}}
A few months later he enrolled in the Rio Pardo School of Tactics.
In 1892 he returned to his regiment as a staff sergeant.
The next year he entered the [[Porto Alegre]] Military Academy.{{sfn|Sergio Lamarão|Inoã Carvalho Urbinati|p=1}}
José Plácido was studying there at the start of the [[Federalist Riograndense Revolution|Federalist Revolution]] in 1893.
He considered that the government of Marshal [[Floriano Peixoto]] was illegitimate, and direct elections should have been held to choose a new president.
He joined the rebels and reached the rank of major.
After the revolt was defeated in 1895 he refused the government amnesty and left the army.
He stayed for a short time in São Gabriel, then moved to [[Rio de Janeiro]], at that time the capital of Brazil.{{sfn|Sergio Lamarão|Inoã Carvalho Urbinati|p=1}}

Plácido de Castro arrived in Rio de Janeiro in 1896.{{sfn|Senador Jorge Viana}}
He was given a position at the Military College of Rio de Janeiro as an inspector of students.{{sfn|Carlos Fernandes}}
He lost this job due to a quarrel with a teacher, and by March 1898 was working with the Companhia Docas de Santos, which ran the docks in the port of [[Santos, São Paulo]].
Early in 1899 he accepted an offer from the engineer Orlando Correia Lopes to go to [[Acre (state)|Acre]] to work on delimiting rubber concessions.{{sfn|Sergio Lamarão|Inoã Carvalho Urbinati|p=1}}
At that time Acre belonged to Bolivia, but was mainly occupied by Brazilian rubber tappers.{{sfn|Herói Brasileiro: Plácido de Castro}}
He began to work as a land surveyor, and soon fell ill with [[malaria]].{{sfn|Senador Jorge Viana}}

In July 1899 the Brazilians in Acre declared the Independent Republic of Acre.{{sfn|Sergio Lamarão|Inoã Carvalho Urbinati|p=1}}
This was quickly dissolved by troops sent by the Brazilian government.
Bolivia sent a small military mission to occupy Acre that was stopped by the rubber tappers.
[[Silvério José Néri]], governor of [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]], dispatched an expedition to Acre, known as the "Poets Expedition" due to the intellectuals among its members, which declared a second Independent Republic of Acre in November 1890.
This time the republic was overthrown by Bolivian troops.{{sfn|Sergio Lamarão|Inoã Carvalho Urbinati|p=2}}

The newspapers now reported an alleged agreement where Bolivia would lease Acre to an Anglo-American "Bolivian syndicate" for 30 years, and would send troops armed by the United States to defend the territory.{{sfn|Sergio Lamarão|Inoã Carvalho Urbinati|p=2}}
The possibility of losing control of the rubber trade alarmed the merchants of [[Pará]], who until then had not backed the Amazonas merchants in trying to displace Bolivia from Acre.{{sfn|Pedraja|2006|p=61}}
Bolivian president [[José Manuel Pando]] obtained approval from Congress for the syndicate plan on 21 December 1901.
The news that a US concern backed by troops was taking over caused panic among the Brazilian rubber tappers in Acre.{{sfn|Pedraja|2006|p=62}}

==Acre revolution==
[[File:Coronel Plácido de Castro após a Revolução Acreana.jpg|thumb|Plácido de Castro after the Acre revolution]]
Plácido de Castro was working in the [[Purus River]] area when he heard of the Bolivian government's leasing plan.{{sfn|Herói Brasileiro: Plácido de Castro}}
At the start of 1902 he accepted an invitation from Rodrigo de Carvalho and two other large rubber producers to lead a revolt against Bolivia.{{sfn|Senador Jorge Viana}}
Plácido de Castro took a boat up the Acre river, ostensibly to conduct land surveys in the south but in fact carrying arms and ammunition. 
He stopped off briefly in Puerto Alonso (also called Puerto Acre, now [[Porto Acre]]) to meet the Bolivian governor Lino Romero and evaluate his future opponent.{{sfn|Pedraja|2006|p=63}}
In the south he organised the rubber tappers and other inhabitants for the revolt.{{sfn|Sergio Lamarão|Inoã Carvalho Urbinati|p=3}}
He then returned to Brazil, bypassing Puerto Alonso to avoid alerting the Bolivians.{{sfn|Pedraja|2006|p=63}}
Plácido participated in the 1 July 1902 meeting at which the revolutionary junta was formed with a goal of obtaining the independence of Acre and then integrating it with Brazil.{{sfn|Herói Brasileiro: Plácido de Castro}}

Although he argued for immediately attacking the garrison of 230 troops at Puerto Alonso, Plácido de Castro was persuaded to first take the outpost at [[Xapuri]].{{sfn|Pedraja|2006|p=63}}
He entered Xapuri with 33 men in the early morning of 6 August 1902 and captured the sleeping garrison without spilling blood.
On 7 August 1902 he issued a manifesto proclaiming that Acre was independent.
He planned to next take Puerto Acre, but news of an approaching column of Bolivian troops from the [[Orthon River]] caused many of his 200 men to desert.{{sfn|Pedraja|2006|p=64}}
When the remaining 63 rebels were attacked at Volta da Empresa (now [[Rio Branco, Acre|Rio Branco]]) on 18 September 1902 they were decisively defeated, losing half their number. 
The Bolivian commander, Colonel Rojas, issued a proclamation in which he called the rebels and their leaders cowards.
As a result, Plácido's ranks quickly swelled to at least 500 angry rubber tappers.{{sfn|Pedraja|2006|p=64}}

Rojas had lost men and was short of supplies. 
He made camp at Volta da Empresa and sent messengers to Puerto Alonso and [[Riberalta]] asking for fresh guns and ammunition.{{sfn|Pedraja|2006|p=65}}
Plácido de Castro surrounded the Bolivian camp but failed to achieve surprise in an attack on 5 October 1902 and instead settled into a siege, digging diagonal trenches to close in on the Bolivians.
He invited Rojas to surrender on 9 October.{{sfn|Pedraja|2006|p=65}}
Rojas held out for a few more days, then surrendered on 15 October and led his disarmed men back to Bolivia.{{sfn|Pedraja|2006|p=66}}
On 14 October 1902 the rebels captured some of the outer defences of Puerto Alonso and the armed Bolivian launch ''Rio Afua'', which they renamed the ''Independencia''.{{sfn|Scheina|2003|loc=PP30}}
Further successful fighting continued in the south against a column of Bolivian rubber tappers and a picket of poorly trained troops at [[Santa Rosa del Abuná]].{{sfn|Pedraja|2006|p=66}}

Plácido de Castro could not persuade his men to continue south to destroy the Bolivian base on the Orthon, and turned back towards Puerto Alonso.
Lino Romero had failed to organise for defence.
Plácido de Castro surrounded the town on 8 January 1903, and launched an attack on 15 January 1903 that soon petered out.{{sfn|Pedraja|2006|p=67}}
By now Plácido had 2,000 men under his command. 
They started to dig zigzag trenches to the Bolivian lines.
Eventually, with his forces exhausted and almost out of ammunition, Romero surrendered on 24 January 1903.{{sfn|Pedraja|2006|p=68}}
Plácido de Castro's leadership skills had played a key role in the success of the revolt, helped by supplies of food, ammunition and weapons from the great rubber barons of Acre.{{sfn|Senador Jorge Viana}}

==Later years==
[[File:Placido1.jpg|thumb|Plácido de Castro in 1907]]
The Brazilian government sent troops under General Olímpio da Silveira to take control.{{sfn|Sergio Lamarão|Inoã Carvalho Urbinati|p=2}}
Plácido de Castro went to Rio de Janeiro to report on the campaign to  [[José Paranhos, Baron of Rio Branco]]. 
On his journey he was acclaimed in [[Manaus]] and [[Belém]], and received with honour in Rio.
He declined an offer to become a colonel in the National Guard.{{sfn|Senador Jorge Viana}}
In August 1903 Plácido was made provisional commander of the army of Acre and president of the territory of Acre.{{sfn|Sergio Lamarão|Inoã Carvalho Urbinati|p=3}}
Plácido de Castro's views were those of a ''[[caudillo]]'' rather than a democrat.
He was not impressed by Brazil's lack of support for the revolt, and favoured an independent state of Acre.{{sfn|Hecht|Cockburn|2011|p=86}}
However, under the [[Treaty of Petrópolis]] of 17 November 1903 Brazil formally acquired Acre for two million pounds sterling, ceded some land in [[Mato Grosso]] and undertook to build the [[Madeira-Mamoré Railroad]]  to allow export of Bolivian products via the [[Amazon River]].{{sfn|Herói Brasileiro: Plácido de Castro}}
Plácido remained leader of Acre until February 1904.{{sfn|Sergio Lamarão|Inoã Carvalho Urbinati|p=3}}

After leaving office Plácido de Castro bought the Capatará rubber concession on credit, and also obtained property in Bolivia.
He became a major landowner, culminating with the purchase on credit of the great Bagaço rubber concession.
His rapidly acquired fortune earned him enemies.{{sfn|Senador Jorge Viana}}
In June 1906 he was appointed prefect of Alto Acre, one of the four departments of the territory of Acre.
He had to deal with various intrigues, including opposition by a former subordinate, Colonel Alexandrino José da Silva.{{sfn|Sergio Lamarão|Inoã Carvalho Urbinati|p=3}}
He resigned from his post due to a disagreement with the government.{{sfn|Carlos Fernandes}}

On 9 August 1908, as he was preparing to return to Rio Grande do Sul, he fell into an ambush prepared by José da Silva.{{sfn|Sergio Lamarão|Inoã Carvalho Urbinati|p=3}}
He was shot from behind, and died two days later.{{sfn|Herói Brasileiro: Plácido de Castro}}
His dying words were recorded as, "Death is a phenomenon as natural as life. He who knows how to live will know how to die. I only lament that having had so much occasion for glorious death, these 'heroes' have shot me in the back."{{sfn|Hecht|Cockburn|2011|p=293}}
His body was taken to [[Porto Alegre]] and buried in the Santa Casa cemetery.{{sfn|Herói Brasileiro: Plácido de Castro}}

==Legacy==
Plácido de Castro has become admired as a hero of Brazil.
The municipality of [[Plácido de Castro, Acre]], was created in 1963.{{sfn|Sergio Lamarão|Inoã Carvalho Urbinati|p=3}}
Rio Branco has a Praça Plácido de Castro.{{sfn|Marshall|Jenkins|Cleary|2009|loc=PT880}}
José Plácido de Castro was included in the [[Tancredo Neves Pantheon of the Fatherland and Freedom]] in [[Brasília]] on 17 November 2004 as the liberator of Acre.{{sfn|Eduardo Carneiro}}
The [[Rio Branco International Airport]] was renamed the Rio Branco-Plácido de Castro International Airport in 2009.{{sfn|Lei n˚11.917, de 9 de abril de 2009}}

'''Khalid bin Abdullah Al Saud''' (born 1937, [[Ta'if]], [[Saudi Arabia]]) ({{lang-ar|خالد بن عبدالله آل سعود}}) is a member of the [[House of Saud]]. He has extensive business interests, run through [[Mawarid Holding]], but is probably better-known as the owner of [[Juddmonte Farms]]. As such, he is one of the leading figures in the world of [[Thoroughbred horse racing|thoroughbred horseracing]] and the list of outstanding horses to have competed in Prince Khalid's racing-colours includes the greats: [[Dancing Brave]], [[Enable (horse)|Enable]], [[Frankel (horse)|Frankel]] and [[Arrogate]].

==Early life==
Prince Khalid is one of the sons of [[Abdullah bin Abdul-Rahman]] a younger half-brother of [[Ibn Saud|King Abdulaziz]].Prince Khalid is a half first cousin to all the sons of King Abdulaziz and the six siblings who have ruled modern Saudi Arabia in succession to their father the founder.&lt;ref name="sangster"&gt;Robinson, Patrick and Robinson, Nick.

She is therefore a full sister of the group of sons known as the [[Sudairi Seven]], who include [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|King Fahd]] and the present monarch, [[Salman of Saudi Arabia|King Salman]].

==Horseracing career==

===Development===

Although Prince Khalid's father had owned horses, he had not kept them for racing.&lt;ref name="owners"&gt;[http://www.britishhorseracing.com/goracing/racing/peopleinracing/owners/view.asp?item=001971 "Owners: Prince Khalid Abdullah"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040819224743/http://www.britishhorseracing.com/goracing/racing/peopleinracing/owners/view.asp?item=001971 |date=19 August 2004 }}, [[British Horseracing Authority]].

Even so, he did not start owning racehorses himself until the late 1970s.&lt;ref name="Ashforth interview"&gt;Ashforth, David. "Khalid Abdullah: Quiet passion of a charming prince who keeps plenty in reserve", ''[[The Racing Post]]'', 24 May 2002.

In 1977 Prince Khalid's first racing adviser, the former trainer [[Humphrey Cottrill]], bought for him four yearlings at the Newmarket sales.&lt;ref name="cottrill"&gt;"Humphrey Cottrill dies at 92", [[The Racing Post]], 1 September 1999.

However, Cottrill and the trainer [[Jeremy Tree]] had also paid $225,000 for a dark bay colt by [[In Reality]] at the [[Keeneland Sales]] of 1978, their single purchase, as [[Known Fact]], won the [[Middle Park Stakes]] in the autumn of 1979 and then, after [[Nureyev (horse)|Nureyev]]'s disqualification, the [[2,000 Guineas]] of 1980, following up his victory with a win in the [[Queen Elizabeth II Stakes]].&lt;ref name="Breeders' Cup Bios"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scott interview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="owners"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ashforth interview"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Patrick and Robinson, Nick.

The circle of trainers widened to include the yards of [[Roger Charlton]], [[Andre Fabre]], [[Henry Cecil]], [[Barry Hills]], [[John Gosden]], [[Pascal Bary]], [[Dermot Weld]] and others, as well as latterly [[Sir Michael Stoute]].

===Juddmonte Farms===

In 1982, Khalid bin Abdullah purchased Cayton Park Stud at [[Wargrave]] in [[Berkshire]], renaming it [[Juddmonte Farms]].  From the early 1980s he built up a collection of carefully selected mares, in the early days buying from [[Robert Sangster]].&lt;ref name="lightning strike"/&gt;  By 2011 these represented, according to Lord Grimthorpe in an interview given to the ''[[Financial Times]]'', "one of the greatest brood-mare bands in the history of breeding”.&lt;ref name="Breeding: it’s all about the pedigree"/&gt;

The British arm of the Juddmonte operations came to include Juddmonte Dullingham and Estcourt Estate in [[Gloucestershire]], as well as Side Hill Stud and Banstead Manor in [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]] in [[Suffolk]]. There, Prince Khalid stood a number of leading stallions, notably Dansili and Oasis Dream; in 2011 their nomination fee was £65,000 and £85,000 respectively for each mare in foal.&lt;ref name="Breeding: it’s all about the pedigree"/&gt;&lt;ref name="a short history"/&gt; Juddmonte also owns Ferrans Stud and New Abbey Stud in [[Ireland]], as well as Juddmonte Farm in [[Lexington, Kentucky#Horse racing and equestrian events|Lexington]], [[Kentucky]].

The studs in Britain and Ireland are managed by Philip Mitchell, who joined Juddmonte as General Manager of European Operations in 1988, while John Chandler handles arrangements in America. Humphrey Cottrill acted as his racing manager and adviser from 1977 to his retirement in 1982, when he was replaced by Grant Pritchard-Gordon, who was in turn succeeded by the current racing manager, [[Edward Beckett, 5th Baron Grimthorpe|Lord Grimthorpe]], in 1998.&lt;ref name="Breeders' Cup Bios"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scott interview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="a short history"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lord Grimthorpe"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, Richard.

Retrieved 12 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prince Khalid was responsible for the allocation of horses to trainers and for approval of mating lists. In a rare interview in 2010 he told ''[[The Racing Post]]'': "When I was at the sales I realised that it would be easier to buy horses and race them, but I got the feeling that this was not enough, that it would be more fun to do what people like the [[Aga Khan]] and [[Lord Howard de Walden]] did and build up your own families." He said that he had his stud book with him all the time.&lt;ref name="Scott interview"/&gt;

In 2011 the Juddmonte operation employed around 250 people and extended to 700-800 horses around the world, with a racing stock of about 250.  That year they bought just two yearlings while selling more than 100 horses.  In his ''[[Financial Times]]'' interview Lord Grimthorpe said Juddmonte was "not run as a commercial operation";&lt;ref name="Breeding: it’s all about the pedigree"/&gt; Prince Khalid once told The Racing Post, "It is still my only hobby".&lt;ref name="Scott interview"/&gt;

Agthe moved to Berlin and spent the next two years acquiring several former [[Volkseigener Betrieb|state owned companies]].&lt;ref name="agthe"/&gt;

The '''''Master of Business Communication''''' (MBC) is a specialized [[academic degree]] typically conferred by a business school. The degree incorporates many elements of the [[Master of Business Administration]] [[MBA]] degree with a specialized focus on [[corporate communications]], [[public relations]] and [[marketing communications]].

The degree typically requires three years of full-time study but may take longer when undertaken on a part-time basis. It is evident that some institutions are offering the degree in similar structure to the MBA.  The aim of the program is to educate on the interdisciplinary principles of [[business management]] as they apply to the corporate communicator.

Zaki is the founder of Nazaki Services Pvt Ltd,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nazaki.com|title=NAZAKI GROUP OF COMPANIES|author=|date=|work=Nazaki.com|access-date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a company in the Maldives to the extent that all local news media refer to him as Nazaki Zaki.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140714193931/http://www.haveeru.com.mv/ambassadors/39383 Malaysian king confers Dato' title to Nazaki Zaki] &lt;/ref&gt; While being a businessman, he was also a part-time politician in the opposition party MDP [[Maldivian Democratic Party]]. He is among the few political figures in the Maldives who had stood up against a corrupt government during the time when there was no freedom of speech in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100522031729/http://en.rsf.org/list-of-the-13-internet-enemies-07-11-2006,19603 LIST OF THE 13 INTERNET ENEMIES - MALDIVES] &lt;/ref&gt; The struggle that he and others had undergone has made a political impact within four to five years.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In 2007, Maldivians were able to speak openly against the government and the police without the fear of being arrested, beaten, or tortured.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} This was a complete change compared to 2003. In October 2008, the first Maldivian democratic presidential elections were held, where people voted for a change in government, causing the Maldivian Democratic Party presidential candidate [[Mohamed Nasheed]] to be the new incoming president.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} As government posts are decided by the president, Mohamed Zaki was appointed the new [[Maldives Ambassador to Malaysia]], Indonesia, Thailand and Brunei in 2008.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

During his youth, Zaki had struggled to earn money and support his family.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} However he had supported his wife (Nazima Asir) together with his five children and established one of the biggest companies in the Maldives.

His son [[Muad Mohamed Zaki]] has raised his political profile in the country after being one of the senior Maldivian Democratic Party member that was arrested in the military crackdown on peaceful protesters. The day of the crackdown was later labelled as Black Friday in the Maldives.

Both has moved on to give their support to a government that is based on national unity and Islam in the Maldives.

He has long-standing high political and business relations with the government led by President [[Abdulla Yameen]] and has given his support to the president's vision to develop the country. Zaki's political influence and credibility in the country has extended to the past two presidents before President Yameen. His backing of any president or political party has always been seen as a boost to their credibility in the eyes of many locals that respect him for his international achievements in life.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2384">The '''Navy Lighterage pontoon''' (NLP) was a type of [[Float (nautical)|pontoon]] developed in World War II by the [[US Navy]] and used by naval construction teams ([[Seabee (US Navy)|Seabee]]s) and specialized US Army combat engineers, on invasion beaches and shallow harbors or harbors where the facilities had been destroyed or did not exit, to construct docks, wharfs, barges, floating cranes and other floating units.

The concept of NLPs was first discussed in 1935{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}, but it was in 1940 that the US Navy took the idea seriously and began development, with testing taking place just before the US entered World War II.  The [[Dieppe Raid]] in early 1942 showed that the idea of seizing a port in the face of modern coastal defences was either costly or impossible. The US Navy saw the vital importance of being able to build their own port facilities and to deploy naval construction teams trained and dedicated for just that role. The US Army soon followed with their own units.

==Construction==
The NLPs were constructed of welded steel flotation units that were assembled like children's wooden block toys, connected by special angle-iron pieces, called stringers. The flotation boxes and stringers were held together by special iron wedge pins. The flotation blocks came in two types: The principal type of unit was a {{convert|5|x|5|x|7|ft|m|abbr=on}} rectangular prism; the majority of NLPs were constructed using these. The second type was similar but curved upward on one side, and these boxes were used to make [[Bow (ship)|bow]]s on the front of NLP barges when required.

'''''Newsday''''' is an American daily [[newspaper]] that primarily serves [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau]] and [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk]] counties and the New York City [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Queens]] on [[Long Island]], although it is also sold throughout the [[New York metropolitan area]]. As of 2009,{{update inline|date=October 2015}} its weekday circulation of 377,500 was the 11th-highest in the [[Newspapers in the United States|United States]], and the highest among suburban newspapers.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|last1=Arango|first1=Tim|last2=Pérez-Peña|first2=Richard|authorlink1=Tim Arango|authorlink2=Richard Pérez-Peña|title=3 Moguls in Talks to Buy Newsday|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/21/business/media/21paper.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, ''Newsday'' expanded to include [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]] and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] county news on its website. As of January 2014, Newsday's total average circulation was 437,000 on weekdays, 434,000 on Saturdays and 495,000 on Sundays.&lt;ref name="Feb 2014 SEC filing" /&gt;

The newspaper's headquarters is in [[Melville, New York]], in [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]].

==History==
Founded by [[Alicia Patterson]] and her husband, [[Harry Guggenheim]], the publication was first produced on September 3, 1940 from [[Hempstead, NY|Hempstead]].&lt;ref&gt;Arlen, A., Arlen, M.J. ''The Huntress: The Adventures, Escapades, and Triumphs of Alicia Patterson: Aviatrix, Sportswoman, Journalist, Publisher'' (Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, 2016) {{ISBN|9781101871133}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many years until a major redesign in the 1970s, ''Newsday'' copied the ''Daily News'' format of short stories and lots of pictures (Ironically, Patterson was fired as a writer at her father's ''Daily News'' in her early 20s, after getting the basic facts of a divorce wrong in a published report). After Patterson's death in 1963, Guggenheim became publisher and editor.

In 1967, Guggenheim turned over the publisher position to [[Bill Moyers]] and continued as president and editor-in-chief. But Guggenheim was disappointed by the liberal drift of the newspaper under Moyers, criticizing what he called the "left-wing" coverage of Vietnam War protests.&lt;ref name="time42770"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,909136,00.html|title=The Press: How Much Independence?

Guggenheim sold his majority share to the then-conservative [[Times-Mirror Company]] over the attempt of newspaper employees to block the sale, even though Moyers offered $10 million more than the Times-Mirror purchase price; Moyers resigned a few days later.&lt;ref name="time42770"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt51370"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0F12FC3F5D137B93C1A8178ED85F448785F9|title=Moyers Resigns Post at Newsday|date=May 13, 1970|work=New York Times|accessdate=February 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="raymont313"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/13/archives/newsday-employes-seek-to-block-sale-of-the-paper.html|title=Newsday Employes [sic] Seek to Block Sale of the Paper|last=Raymont|first=Henry|date=March 13, 1970|work=New York Times|accessdate=February 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Guggenheim, who died a year later, disinherited Moyers from his will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=$12 Million Left to Charity by Guggenheim|date=January 30, 1971|work=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the competing ''[[Long Island Press]]'' (not to be confused with the alternative weekly of the same name) ceased publication in 1977, ''Newsday'' launched a separate [[Queens, New York City|Queens]] edition, followed by a New York City edition dubbed ''New York Newsday''. In June 2000, Times Mirror merged with the [[Tribune Company]], partnering ''Newsday'' with the New York City television station [[WPIX]] (Channel 11), also owned by Tribune.

With the Times Mirror-Tribune merger, the newspaper founded by [[Alicia Patterson]] was now owned by the company that was founded by her great-grandfather, [[Joseph Medill]] — which owns the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and, until 1991, also owned her father's ''Daily News''. (Tribune sold the ''Daily News'' to British newspaper magnate [[Robert Maxwell]]. After Maxwell's death in 1992, his publishing empire collapsed and [[Mortimer Zuckerman]] purchased the ''Daily News''.) [[Chicago, Illinois]], real estate magnate [[Samuel Zell]] purchased Tribune in 2007.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt;

[[News Corporation]], headed by CEO [[Rupert Murdoch]], attempted to purchase ''Newsday'' for US$580 million in April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.newsday.com/business/ny-bznews0423,0,696524.story |title=''Newsday'' (April 23, 2008): "Murdoch tells LI officials deal for ''Newsday'' close", by Ellen Yan and James T.

==Editorial style==
Despite having a [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] format, ''Newsday'' is not known for being sensationalistic, as are other local daily tabloids, such as the New York ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' and the ''[[New York Post]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, John D., ''Sensationalism and the New York Press'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 1991) {{ISBN|0-231-07396-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamill, Pete, ''News Is a Verb: Journalism at the End of the Twentieth Century'' (New York: Ballantine Books, 1998) {{ISBN|0-345-42528-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the alternative weekly newspaper ''[[Long Island Press]]'' (which is not related to the defunct daily of the same name) wrote that ''Newsday'' has used its clout to influence local politics in [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau]] and [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk]] Counties.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Long Island Press]]'', "Game Over: How the Paper's Monopoly Control Has Warped its Coverage and Hurt Long Island", by Christopher Twarowski, December 30, 2004: "Numerous politicians in both counties, county workers, directors of community groups and other sources claim that 'Newsday' uses its position as Long Island's only daily paper to strong-arm county officials, nonprofit directors, local leaders and rival publications and even to influence pieces of legislation — often through fear, intimidation and other anti-competitive practices — to further its political or commercial agenda".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bill Moyers]] briefly served as publisher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/M/htmlM/moyesrbill/moyersbill.htm The Museum of Broadcast Communications: Moyer biography]&lt;/ref&gt; During the tenure of publisher [[Robert M. Johnson]] in the 1980s, Newsday made a major push into New York City. The paper's roster of columnists and critics has included [[Cathy Young]], [[Jimmy Breslin]], [[Barbara Garson]], [[Normand Poirier]], [[Murray Kempton]], [[Gail Collins (journalist)|Gail Collins]], [[Pete Hamill]], [[Sydney Schanberg]], [[Robert Reno]] (died 2012), [[Jim Dwyer (journalist)|Jim Dwyer]], sportswriter [[Mike Lupica]], music critic [[Tim Page (music critic)|Tim Page]], and television critic [[Marvin Kitman]]. The paper featured both [[advice column]]ists [[Ann Landers]] and [[Dear Abby]] for several years.  From 1985 to 2005, Michael Mandelbaum wrote a regular foreign affairs analysis column for Newsday. Noted writer and biographer [[Robert Caro]] was an investigative reporter. Its features section has included, among others, television [[reporter]]s [[Verne Gay]] and [[Diane Werts]], TV/film feature writer [[Frank Lovece]], and film critic [[Rafer Guzman]]. Newsday carries the syndicated columnist [[Froma Harrop]]. [[Pulitzer Prize]] winner [[Walt Handelsman]]'s editorial political cartoons animation are a nationally syndicated feature of Newsday. In the 1980s, a new design director, Robert Eisner, guided the transition into digital design and color printing. {{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

''Newsday'' created and sponsored a "Long Island at the Crossroads" advisory board in 1978, to recommend regional goals, supervise local government, and liaison with state and Federal officials.&lt;ref&gt;

It lasted approximately a decade.

On March 21, 2011, ''Newsday'' redesigned its front page, scrapping the [[nameplate (publishing)|nameplate]] and font used since the 1960s in favor of a sans-serif wordmark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsday.com/long-island/meet-the-new-newsday-1.2773390 "Meet the new Newsday"] ''Newsday'' (March 21, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Circulation==
In 2008, ''Newsday'' was ranked 10th in terms of newspaper circulation in the United States.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt;

A circulation scandal in 2004 revealed that the paper's daily and Sunday circulation had been inflated by 16.9% and 14.5%, respectively, in the auditing period September 30, 2002 to September 30, 2003.&lt;ref name=abc2&gt;[http://www.accessabc.com/press/press111604.htm Audit Bureau of Circulation, "ABC Releases ''Newsday'' Audit", November 16, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; The Audit Bureau of Circulation adjusted average weekday circulation to 481,816 from 579,599; average Saturday circulation to 392,649 from 416,830; and average Sunday circulation to 574,081 from 671,820, and instituted twice-yearly audits.&lt;ref name=abc2 /&gt;
 
On October 28, 2009, ''Newsday'' changed its web site to a [[Pay wall|paid-subscriber only model]]. Newsday.com would open its front page, classified ads, movie listings, and school closings to all site visitors, but access beyond this content would require a weekly fee – US$5 as of 2010.

McGrady's intention was to write a deliberately terrible book with a lot of sex, to illustrate the point that popular American literary culture had become mindlessly vulgar. The book fulfilled the authors' expectations and became a bestseller in 1969; they revealed the hoax later that year, further spurring the book's popularity.

The '''Office of the Ombudsman''' (in [[Maori language|Māori]]: ''Tari o te Kaitiaki Mana Tangata'') was established in 1962 under the Parliamentary Commissioner (Ombudsman) Act 1962. The term "[[Ombudsman]]" is Swedish and basically means "grievance person".&lt;ref name="ombudsman.parliament"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/about-us/history |title=History |publisher=Office of the Ombudsman |accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary role of the Ombudsman in [[New Zealand]] is to investigate complaints against government agencies. In 1983 the responsibilities were extended to include investigation of agencies that fail to provide information requested in accordance with the [[Official Information Act 1982|Official Information Act]]. The Ombudsman also has responsibility to protect [[whistleblowers]] and investigate the administration of prisons and other places of detention.

==History==
The first Ombudsman in New Zealand was [[Guy Powles]] who had a previous background as a lawyer, soldier, administrator and diplomat. He held the position of Ombudsman from 1962 until his retirement in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/about-us/past-ombudsmen |title=Past Ombudsmen |publisher=Office of the Ombudsman |accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his appointment, only three other countries had an Ombudsman - Sweden, Finland and Denmark.

The [http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1975/0009/latest/DLM430984.html Ombudsmen Act] came into force in 1975.  This allowed for the appointment of additional Ombudsmen in addition to the chief Ombudsman and extended the role to include local government agencies.

In 1983, the [http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1982/0156/latest/DLM64785.html Official Information Act] required government agencies to respond to requests for information (known as OIA requests)  and the Ombudsman was given the task of investigating complaints against [[Ministers of the Crown]] and central government agencies when requested information was not supplied in a timely manner. In 1988 the Ombudsman's powers were extended to decisions made by local government agencies as well.

In 2001, the [http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2000/0007/latest/DLM53466.html Protected Disclosures Act] (commonly known as the “whistle-blower” legislation) was passed.  This makes the Ombudsman responsible for "providing advice and guidance to any employee who has made, or is considering making, a disclosure about serious wrongdoing in their workplace (either public or private sector)".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/about-us/history History], Ombudsman official website&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 all crown entities were brought within the Ombudsman's jurisdiction under the [http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1975/0009/latest/DLM430984.html Ombudsmen Act] and Official Information Act.&lt;ref name="ombudsman.parliament" /&gt;

In 2007, the Office of the Ombudsman was designated as a [http://www.justice.govt.nz/policy/constitutional-law-and-human-rights/human-rights/international-human-rights-instruments/international-human-rights-instruments-1/procedures-relating-to-the-core-human-rights-instruments-of-the-united-nations/documents-and-other-information-relating-to-the-core-human-rights-instruments-ratified-by-new-zealand/documents-system-of-regular-visits-op-cat-national-preventive-mechanisms National Preventive Mechanism (NPM)] under the [http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1989/0106/latest/DLM192818.html Crimes of Torture Act 1989] (COTA).  This legislation establishes New Zealand’s human rights obligations under the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment [http://www.hrc.co.nz/international-human-rights-new/new-zealands-international-obligations/optional-protocol-to-the-convention-against-torture-opcat/ (“OPCAT”)] to "prevent torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment" by establishing a system of regular and independent visits to prisons and other places of detention.

=== Chief Ombudsmen ===
New Zealand's Chief Ombudsman (''Nga Kaitiaki Mana Tangata'' in [[Māori language|Māori]]) is appointed by the [[Governor-General of New Zealand]] on recommendation of the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. The Chief Ombudsman is assisted by others who have the title of Ombudsman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Who is the Ombudsman? |url= http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/about-us/who-is-the-ombudsman |publisher=Office of the Ombudsman |accessdate=8 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responsibilities ==
The Ombudsman's role is described in its Annual Report for 2012 as follows: "We investigate, review and inspect the administrative conduct of state sector agencies, and provide advice and guidance, in order to ensure people are treated fairly in New Zealand” and that “a high level of public trust in government is maintained”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/system/paperclip/document_files/document_files/466/original/annual_report_2011_-_2012.pdf Ombudsman's Annual Report 2011/12], p 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Official Information Act===
The guiding principle of the [[Official Information Act 1982|Official Information Act]] is that "information must be made available unless a good reason exists under the Acts for withholding it." The underlying purpose is "to increase the availability of official information to promote more effective public participation in the making and administration of laws and policies; to promote the accountability of Ministers of the Crown and government officials; and to protect sensitive information where necessary in the public interest or to preserve personal privacy." Requests for information must be answered within 20 working days although the time limit can be extended. If a Government agency requires more time to answer a particular request, they have to provide the reason for any such extension.&lt;ref name="justice.govt.nz"&gt;[http://www.justice.govt.nz/publications/global-publications/o/official-information-your-right-to-know/publication/ Official information: Your right to know], Ministry of Justice website&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act allows Government agencies to deny requests for information under certain circumstances. These include: the national security or defence of New Zealand; the maintenance of law and order; trade secrets and commercial confidentiality; personal privacy; and legal professional privilege.&lt;ref name="justice.govt.nz"/&gt; The Ombudsman's role is to ensure that government agencies provide information that is requested in accordance with the Act.

The agencies generating the most complaints tend to be ones that interact with and impact upon large numbers of New Zealanders.  In 2011/12, these agencies were the Department of Corrections, the Earthquake Commission, the Ministry of Social Development, the Department of Labour (Immigration New Zealand), the Accident Compensation Corporation, and Inland Revenue Department. In that year, 97% of complaints came from individual members of the public.  34% were from prisoners or prisoner advocates (not all against the Department of Corrections), and 63% were from other members of the public.  Only 3% of complaints were made by corporate entities and special interest groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/faq-s#How%20many%20complaints%20does%20the%20Ombudsman%20receive? FAQs], Official website of the Ombudsman&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of OIA complaints has been steadily increasing ever since the Act was passed. In 2012, the Ombudsman received 1,236 OIA complaints, an increase of 25 percent on 2010/11 numbers, and the highest number since the 2000 to 2001 period.&lt;ref name="Annual Report 2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/system/paperclip/document_files/document_files/466/original/annual_report_2011_-_2012.pdf |format=PDF |title=Annual Report 2012 |publisher=Office of the Ombudsman |page=40 |accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Private individuals made approximately three-quarters of all OIA complaints; the media made about 12% while Members of Parliament and political party research units accounted for 4%.&lt;ref name="Annual Report 2012"/&gt; 41% of OIA complaints were due to a partial or complete refusal to provide information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/system/paperclip/document_files/document_files/466/original/annual_report_2011_-_2012.pdf |format=PDF |title=Annual Report 2012 |publisher=Office of the Ombudsman |page=42 |accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Increase in complaints ====
In 2011/12 the Ombudsman received 10,636 complaints, an increase of 22% on the previous year's numbers. Dame Beverley told Parliament the Office of the Ombudsman was "in crisis, with a bulging backlog of cases due to lack of investigators".  Part of this was due to an increase in complaints about the Earthquake Commission and the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority and by 2011, the total number of complaints being received was double that provided for by the baseline funding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10785726 Bulging backlog creating a 'crisis' in Office of the Ombudsman], NZ Herald 15 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Dame Margaret said her staff were underpaid, overworked and were leaving - and "in some cases were literally being worked to death".&lt;ref name="nzherald.co.nz"&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11255003 Budget 2014: Funding crucial as busy watchdogs feel the strain], NZ Herald 15 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; She said her office was "sinking under the weight of the complaint burden" which was slowing down the resolution of complaints.

In 2013, the Ombudsman received 13,684 complaints, an increase of 29% on the previous year. The Ombudsman described this as "an unprecedented increase in demand for its services...for the second year in a row.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/ckeditor_assets/attachments/292/highest_ever_number_of_complaints_for_ombudsman.pdf Highest ever number of complaints for Ombudsman], Press release 15 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In response the Government provided extra funding in the budget in both 2013 and 2014. The increases enabled Dame Beverley to hire more investigators and she said her office should catch up on its backlog of complaints by 2015.&lt;ref name="nzherald.co.nz"/&gt;

==== Attempts to circumvent OIA ====
In 2012 Dame Beverley expressed concern at attempts by Government agencies to keep information secret by drafting laws to avoid the Official Information Act, referring in particular to new legislation on partial state asset sales, charter schools and changes to mining permits. The Ombudsman's Office argued at a select committee hearing that state assets associated with the Mixed Ownership Model Act would still be 51 per cent owned by the public and should remain subject to the Official Information Act (OIA).  Dame Beverley said there was an increasing number of officials in government who fail to understand the constitutional importance of the legislation and that this trend was 'reprehensible' and 'extremely dangerous'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10836994 Top-level alarm over secrecy trend], NZ Herald 28 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, the Ombudsman criticised the Ministry of Education over its response to requests for information about school closures in Christchurch. David McGee found the Ministry misled the Christchurch City Council by advising two school principals to withdraw their official requests "in order to receive a better response." McGee said: "Schools and parents should not have to ferret out information by making official information requests." The Ombudsman also expressed concerns that there may be a perception within the public sector that "some requests for information can only be processed efficiently by somehow removing them from the OIA context".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10854911 Ombudsman criticises Education Ministry over school closure requests], NZ Herald 18 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013 the Office of the Ombudsman announced it would conduct an own-motion investigation into the way the public service responds to requests made under the Official Information Act. It said it was receiving an increasing number of complaints by members of the public who felt "shut out". Constitutional lawyer [[Mai Chen]] said reluctance by Government departments to answer OIA requests raised concerns "about how well public servants understood a law intended to give balance to the 'David and Goliath' inequality between citizen and government".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10872519 Ombudsman to investigate OIA response], NZ Herald 21 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Labour's Claire Curren agreed on the need for an investigation saying: "There is an emerging crisis with our watchdog agencies", and this is contributing to a "paralysis of democracy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10872519 Ombudsman to investigate OIA response]&lt;/ref&gt;

The investigation began in December 2014 with over 63 state agencies required to participate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11375105 Government offices selected for OIA review], New Zealand Herald, 17 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Protecting whistleblowers ===
The Ombudsman is one of a number of agencies responsible for protecting '[[whistleblowers]]' – employees who report serious wrongdoing in their workplace under the [http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2000/0007/latest/DLM53466.html?search=ts_act%40bill%40regulation%40deemedreg_protected+disclosures+act_resel_25_h&amp;p=1 Protected Disclosures Act], which came into force in 2001. The Act applies to both public and private sector workplaces. "Serious wrongdoing" includes unlawful, corrupt or irregular use of public money or resources; conduct that poses a serious risk to public health, safety, the environment or the maintenance of the law; any criminal offence; and gross negligence or mismanagement by public officials.&lt;ref name="ombudsman.parliament_b"&gt;[http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/what-we-do/protecting-your-rights/protected-disclosures-whistle-blowing Protected disclosures/whistle-blowing], Official website of the Ombudsman&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act states that employers cannot take legal or disciplinary proceedings against an employee who makes a 'protected disclosure', or brings their concerns to an 'appropriate authority'. The Act also states that if an employer takes retaliatory action, the employee can initiate a personal grievance case under the Employment Relations Act.  The Human Rights Act may also be available to anyone who is victimised as a result of protected disclosures.&lt;ref name="ombudsman.parliament_b" /&gt;

Chief Ombudsman Dame Beverley Wakem says only 10 to 12 people a year ring her office about the Act and even fewer have used it to reveal information. She says the law could have been used to prevent the collapse of so many [http://www.nzherald.co.nz/finance-companies-in-freefall/news/headlines.cfm?c_id=1501786 finance companies] – which covers employees in such companies. She also can't understand why nobody used the legislation to raise concerns about safety practices at the [[Pike River Mine disaster|Pike River mine]]. Dame Beverley says she wants to find out how the Protected Disclosures Act could be used more effectively in such cases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/121808/whistleblower-law-little-known-shareholders-assn Whistleblower law little known], Radio New Zealand 26 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Preventing inhumane treatment ===

The Ombudsman is also part of "National Preventive Mechanisms" which administer [http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1989/0106/latest/DLM192818.html The Crimes of Torture Act] which establishes New Zealand’s international obligations under the United Nations Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture (OPCAT). OPCAT was established to ensure a system of regular visits by independent international and national bodies to prisons, police cells and mental health hospitals in order to prevent torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Countries that have signed up to OPCAT allow their performance to be monitored by the United Nations Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/what-we-do/protecting-your-rights/monitoring-places-of-detention Monitoring places of detention], Official website of the Ombudsman&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ombudsman appoints Prison Investigators to visit prisons and other places of detention in New Zealand and to conduct investigations after complaints. The inspectors are entitled to interview anyone they choose, including prisoners and staff, who may be in a position to provide relevant information about the treatment of detainees, their access to health care and other conditions of detention. In 2012, the inspectors visited 70 places of detention, and made 24 formal inspections.&lt;ref&gt;Ombudsman's [http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/system/paperclip/document_files/document_files/466/original/annual_report_2011_-_2012.pdf?1351806199 Annual Report 2012], p 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

From time to time, the Ombudsman also looks at systemic issues through “own motion” investigations. In 2011/12 the Ombudsmen completed a major investigation into the [http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/system/paperclip/document_files/document_files/456/original/own_motion_prisoner_health.pdf?1349735789 Provision, Access and Availability of Prisoner Health Services]. The main issues identified in this report were deficiencies in the management of mentally unwell prisoners; concerns with the management of at risk (potentially suicidal) prisoners; inadequate resourcing of dental services; inadequate recording of requests to access health services, waiting times and health related complaints; and no process in place for external accreditation of any of the prison health services. Following the investigation, the Ombudsmen made 21 suggestions for Corrections to consider, and 31 specific recommendations for improvement.&lt;ref&gt;Ombudsman's [http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/system/paperclip/document_files/document_files/466/original/annual_report_2011_-_2012.pdf?1351806199 Annual Report 2012], p 23-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legislative advocacy ===
From time to time the Ombudsman makes submissions to Parliament on proposed pieces of legislation. In 2010 a submission was made on the Law Commission's Issues Paper 18 [http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/system/paperclip/document_files/document_files/346/original/review_of_the_oia.pdf?1346369926 "The Public’s Right to Know"] in which the Ombudsman supported the Law Commission’s view that it would not be desirable to exclude certain classes or categories of information from the Ombudsman's jurisdiction. In 2012 the Ombudsman made submissions on the [http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/system/paperclip/document_files/document_files/344/original/mixed_ownership_model_bill.pdf?1346369921 Mixed Ownership Model Bill.]  Clauses 6 and 7 of the Bill would remove Mixed Ownership companies from being subject to the Ombudsman Act (OA) and Official Information Act (OIA). The Ombudsman's submission said Mixed Ownership companies will still perform the same functions they currently perform, and the Crown as majority shareholder, would continue to have the determinative voice on all decisions - so it was 'highly desirable' that the OA and OIA should continue to apply to them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/system/paperclip/document_files/document_files/344/original/mixed_ownership_model_bill.pdf?1346369921 Submission of the Ombudsmen on the Mixed Ownership Model Bill (13 April 2012)], para 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ombudsman also made a submission on the [http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/system/paperclip/document_files/document_files/339/original/corrections_amendment_bill.pdf?1346369904 Corrections Amendment Bill.] Dame Beverley opposed sections of the Bill which would remove responsibility for the health care of prisoners from prison doctors. She opposed sections which would allow Corrections to use mechanical restraints on prisoners for more than 24 hours and sections which would allow prison officers to conduct strip searches without authorisation from the prison manager. She also opposed sections which would make it an offence to drink water before a random drug test with the intention of diluting the resulting urine sample (known as waterloading). The Ombudsman said this section was potentially a breach of a prisoner’s right to access drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/system/paperclip/document_files/document_files/339/original/corrections_amendment_bill.pdf?1346369904 Corrections Amendment Bill], para 31 &amp; 32&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3750">'''Petr Kraus''' (born 10 November 1966) is a Czech entrepreneur, manager, and founder of Newton group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erudikon.cz/?p=lide_erudikonu-spravni_rada|title=Nadační fond Erudikon|first=solidpixels.|last=http://www.solidpixels.cz|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
In 1994, he and Antonín Koláček founded [[Newton Financial Management Group]], a company that focused on trading on the [[financial markets]] and related advisory services. In the 1990s, he took part in the restructuring and management of numerous industrial enterprises and [[financial institutions]], at home and abroad. The most important projects at the time included Všeobecný vzájemný penzijní fond ([[General Mutual Pension Fund]], today [[ING Pension Fund]]), the Otrokovice heat generation plant and the [[Newton Media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patria.cz/zpravodajstvi/2456315/svycarsky-soud-exmanazeri-mostecke-uhelne-jsou-vinni-a-pujdou-za-mrize.html|title=Švýcarský soud: Exmanažeři Mostecké uhelné jsou vinni a půjdou za mříže|first=Patria Online,|last=a.s.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kraus invested a significant amount of finances in educating and supporting university students. In 2003, he founded [[Newton College (Brno)|Newton College]]. In the framework of such efforts, he then initiated the establishment of the [[Erudikon Endowment Fund]] in 2005 to provide university access to those individuals whose life situation would otherwise make it impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erudikon.cz|title=Nadační fond Erudikon|first=solidpixels.|last=http://www.solidpixels.cz|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== MUS case ==
He ended close cooperation with [[mostecka uhelna spolecnost|MUS]] already in 2002; nevertheless, the Swiss courts found him guilty (verdict not final) from alleged money laundering. As a result of the Swiss charges and the re-opening of the MUS case by the Czech authorities in 2012, his current accounts were frozen and his assets, including the home in which he was living, were seized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zpravy.e15.cz/domaci/udalosti/exmanazeri-mus-maji-v-cesku-obstaveny-majetek-za-800-milionu-936671|title=Exmanažeři MUS mají v Česku obstavený majetek za 800 milionů|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the very beginning of the investigation, Kraus has argued that he, like the rest of the sentenced entrepreneurs and managers, saved [[mostecka uhelna spolecnost|MUS]] and thus it was absurd to criminalise their efforts. Even with regard to the fact that MUS is, thanks to the then successful restructuring, a stable and important company employing thousands of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zpravy.ihned.cz/c1-60034470-mostecka-uhelna-svycarsko-soud|title=Kauza Mostecká uhelná, dějství druhé: Soud si předvolal absentéry Koláčka a Klimeckého|first=|last=ČTK|date=9 June 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Sunday, 20 October 2013, he proclaimed the following about MUS on the [[Czech Television]] programme [[Otázky Václava Moravce]] [Question Time with Václav Moravec]: "This is a dispute about the form that the transformation of the Czech economy took. It is a dispute that should not be relegated to the offices of prosecutors, but aired out in the public domain to allow discussion on whether the process should have taken place as it had."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/domaci/246882-kraus-mus-jsme-nevytunelovali-ale-zachranili/

[[File:Shōzō Makino.jpg|thumb|Shōzō Makino sometime in the 1920s.]]
'''Shōzō Makino''' (マキノ省三, ''Makino Shōzō'', September 22, 1878, [[Kyoto]] – July 25, 1929) was a [[Japan]]ese [[film director]], [[film producer]] and businessman who is regarded as a pioneering director of [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese film]].{{cn|date=January 2013}} In addition, all four of his sons, including [[Masahiro Makino]] and [[Sadatsugu Matsuda]], went into the film business as either directors or producers, and his grandchildren include the actors [[Masahiko Tsugawa]] and [[Hiroyuki Nagato]]. Actress [[Yoko Minamida]] is a granddaughter-in-law.

==Career==
Makino was born in [[Kyoto]] on September 22, 1878.  His mother ran a theater{{Clarify|date=March 2013}}, and his association with movies began when the motion picture producer [[Einosuke Yokota]] of [[Yokota Shōkai]] asked for his help in filming [[jidaigeki|period films]]. Shozo discovered actor [[Matsunosuke Onoe]] working in an itinerant [[kabuki]] troupe and enlisted him into becoming Japan's first film star. He directed over 60 Matsunosuke films a year in the early 1910s, most if not all short films. 

In addition to creating the unique genre of the Japanese period film,{{Clarify|date=March 2013}} Makino also incorporated trick camera techniques and a myriad of other cinematic methods of expression into his films.{{cn|date=January 2013}} In 1919, he founded the [[Mikado Company]] and began to produce educational films. He later founded an independent production company, [[Makino Film Productions]], and from 1923, continued as a director and as producer. Makino Film Productions turned out many successful movies also made by several other directors and actors.{{cn|date=January 2013}}{{Clarify|date=March 2013}} 

In 1928, he directed the epic, ''[[Jitsuroku Chushingura]]'' (''True Record of the Forty-Seven Ronin''), which coincided with his 50th birthday. He died on July 25, 1929.

==Family==

He had a total of five children. Two of his sons, [[Sadatsugu Matsuda]] (1906–2003) and [[Masahiro Makino]] (1908–1993) were also film directors. Another, [[Mitsuo Makino]], was a film producer, and another [[Shinzō Makino]], also worked as a director (his wife was the actress [[Chikako Miyagi]]). Masahiro married the actress [[Yukiko Todoroki]] and their son, [[Masayuki Makino]], is the head of the [[Okinawa Actor's School]]. Shōzō's daughter, [[Tomoko Makino]], married the actor [[Kunitarō Sawamura]], and is the mother to actors [[Masahiko Tsugawa]] and [[Hiroyuki Nagato]], both of whom married famous actresses, [[Yukiji Asaoka]] and [[Yōko Minamida]] respectively. Kunitarō's brother and sister are the actors [[Daisuke Katō]] and [[Sadako Sawamura]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2907">The '''Society of Incorporated Accountants''', founded in 1885 as the '''Society of Accountants''', was a [[professional association]] of [[accountants]] in [[England]]. It was known from 1908 to 1954 as the '''Society of Incorporated Accountants and Auditors''', and from 1954 to 1957 as the Society of Incorporated Accountants.

==History==
The Society of Accountants was established in 1885, initially in reaction to the restrictive practices of the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales]] (ICAEW), founded in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.ac.uk/gh/ghinfo9.htm Records of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and its predecessor bodies at Guildhall Library], [[Guildhall Library]]&lt;/ref&gt; Members were known as 'Incorporated Accountants'.&lt;ref name=journal&gt;[http://www.icaew.com/en/library/subject-gateways/accounting-history/resources/accountancy-ancestors/incorporated%20accountants%20journal Accountancy Ancestors - Incorporated Accountants' Journal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001053959/http://www.icaew.com/en/library/subject-gateways/accounting-history/resources/accountancy-ancestors/incorporated%20accountants%20journal |date=2011-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, members were mainly elected by the Society's Council, but in 1889 examinations were introduced and the Society established itself as an examining body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icaew.com/en/library/subject-gateways/accounting-history/guides/knowledge-guide-to-icaew-examination-papers/society-of-incorporated-accountants-and-auditors-examinations Society of Incorporated Accountants and Auditors examinations]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1889 the Society began publishing a quarterly journal ''Incorporated Accountants' Journal'', which became a monthly in 1895 and was renamed ''Accountancy'' in 1938. The Society was housed at [[Two Temple Place]] from 1928 to 1959. In 1957 it merged with the ICAEW.&lt;ref name=journal/&gt;

{{Strategy}}
'''Strategic thinking''' is defined as a mental or thinking process applied by an individual in the context of achieving success in a [[game]] or other endeavor. As a [[cognitive]] activity, it produces [[thought]].

When applied in an organizational [[strategic management]] process, strategic thinking involves the generation and application of unique business insights and opportunities intended to create competitive advantage for a firm or organisation.&lt;ref name=ST-B-00/&gt;&lt;ref name=ST-B-01&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Strategic Thinking? by Rich Horwath|url=http://www.sculpturaconsulting.com/Articles_Samples/What_is_Strategic_Thinking.pdf|accessdate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ST-B-02/&gt; It can be done [[Individually rational|individually]], as well as [[Collaboration|collaboratively]] among key people who can positively alter an organization's future. Group strategic thinking may create more value by enabling a [[Proactivity|proactive]] and [[Creativity|creative]] [[dialogue]], where individuals gain other people's perspectives on critical and complex issues. This is regarded as a benefit in highly competitive and fast-changing business landscapes.&lt;ref name=ST-B-03/&gt;&lt;ref name=ST-B-04/&gt;&lt;ref name=ST-B-05/&gt;

==Overview==
Strategic thinking includes finding and developing a [[strategic foresight]] capacity for an [[organization]], by exploring all possible organizational futures, and challenging conventional thinking to foster [[decision making]] today.&lt;ref name=ST-B-25/&gt;&lt;ref name=ST-B-18/&gt; Recent [[strategic]] thought points ever more clearly towards the conclusion that the critical strategic question is not the conventional "What?",&lt;ref name="mdt"/&gt; but "Why?" or "How?".&lt;ref name="mdt"/&gt; The work of [[Mintzberg|Henry Mintzberg]]&lt;ref name=ST-RBK-17/&gt;&lt;ref name=ST-RBK-00/&gt; and other authors,&lt;ref name=ST-RBK-03/&gt;&lt;ref name="Graetz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Liedtka"/&gt; further support the conclusion; and also draw a clear distinction between strategic thinking and [[strategic planning]], another important strategic management thought process.&lt;ref name=ST-B-05/&gt;&lt;ref name=ST-RBK-05/&gt;

General [[Andre Beaufre]] wrote in 1963 that strategic thinking "is a mental process, at once abstract and rational, which must be capable of synthesizing both psychological and material data.  The strategist must have a great capacity for both analysis and synthesis; analysis is necessary to assemble the data on which he makes his diagnosis, synthesis in order to produce from these data the diagnosis itself—and the diagnosis in fact amounts to a choice between alternative courses of action."&lt;ref name="Beaufre1965"&gt;{{cite book
| last = Beaufre
| first = Andre
| year = 1965
| title = An Introduction to Strategy | publisher = Frederick A. Prager
| lccn = 65014177}}&lt;!--LCCN IS VALID.  See [[Talk:Strategic thinking#LCCN of An Introduction to Strategy]] before deleting--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no generally accepted definition for strategic thinking, no common agreement as to its role or importance, and no standardised list of key competencies of strategic thinkers.&lt;ref name=ST-RBK-06/&gt; There is also no consensus on whether strategic thinking is an uncommon [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]] or a common and observable [[Property (philosophy)|property]] of strategy. Most agree that traditional models of strategy making, which are primarily based on strategic planning, are not working.&lt;ref name=ST-RBK-07/&gt;&lt;ref name=ST-RBK-09/&gt;&lt;ref name=ST-B-20/&gt; Strategy in today's competitive business landscape is moving away from the basic ‘strategic planning’ to more of ‘strategic thinking’ in order to remain competitive.&lt;ref name=ST-B-19/&gt; However, both thought processes must work hand-in-hand in order to reap maximum benefit.&lt;ref name=ST-B-05/&gt; It has been argued that the real heart of strategy is the 'strategist'; and for a better strategy execution requires a strategic thinker who can discover novel, imaginative strategies which can re-write the rules of the competitive game; and set in motion the chain of events that will shape and "define the future".&lt;ref name=ST-RBK-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=ST-RBK-11/&gt;

== Strategic thinking vs. strategic planning ==
In the view of F. Graetz, strategic thinking and planning are “distinct, but interrelated and complementary thought processes” that must sustain and support one another for effective strategic management. Graetz's model holds that the role of strategic thinking is "to seek innovation and imagine new and very different futures that may lead the company to redefine its core strategies and even its industry". Strategic planning's role is "to realise and to support strategies developed through the strategic thinking process and to integrate these back into the business".&lt;ref name="Graetz" /&gt;&lt;!--p. 457--&gt;

[[Henry Mintzberg]] wrote in 1994 that strategic thinking is more about synthesis (i.e., "connecting the dots") than analysis (i.e., "finding the dots"). It is about "capturing what the manager learns from all sources (both the soft insights from his or her personal experiences and the experiences of others throughout the organization and the hard data from market research and the like) and then synthesizing that learning into a vision of the direction that the business should pursue." Mintzberg argued that strategic thinking cannot be systematized and is the critical part of strategy formation, as opposed to strategic planning exercises. In his view, strategic planning happens ''around'' the strategy formation or strategic thinking activity, by providing inputs for the strategist to consider and providing plans for controlling the implementation of the strategy after it is formed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hbr.org/1994/01/the-fall-and-rise-of-strategic-planning/ar/1 Henry Mintzberg. The Fall and Rise of Strategic Planning. Harvard Business Review. January 1994]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Jeanne Liedtka]], strategic thinking differs from [[strategic planning]] along the following dimensions of [[strategic management]]:&lt;ref name="Liedtka"/&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
!
!Strategic Thinking
!Strategic Planning
|-
!Vision of the Future
|Only the shape of the future can be predicted.
|A future that is predictable and specifiable in detail.
|-
!Strategic Formulation and Implementation'''
|Formulation and implementation are interactive rather than sequential and discrete.
|The roles of formulation and implementation can be neatly divided.
|-
!Managerial Role in Strategy Making
|Lower-level managers have a voice in strategy-making, as well as greater latitude to respond opportunistically to developing conditions.
|Senior executives obtain the needed information from lower-level managers, and then use it to create a plan which is, in turn, disseminated to managers for implementation.
|-
!Control
|Relies on self-reference – a sense of strategic intent and purpose embedded in the minds of managers throughout the organisation that guides their choices on a daily basis in a process that is often difficult to measure and monitor from above.
|Asserts control through measurement systems, assuming that organisations can measure and monitor important variables both  accurately and quickly.
|-
!Managerial Role in Implementation
|All managers understand the larger system, the connection between their roles and the functioning of that system, as well as the interdependence between the various roles that comprise the system.
|Lower-level managers need only know his or her own role well and can be expected to defend only his or her own turf.
|-
!Strategy Making
|Sees strategy and change as inescapably linked and assumes that finding new strategic options and implementing them successfully is harder and more important than evaluating them.
|The challenge of setting strategic direction is primarily analytic.
|-
!Process and Outcome
|Sees the planning process itself as a critical value-adding element.
|Focus is on the creation of the plan as the ultimate objective.
|}

== Strategic thinking competencies ==
Liedtka observed five “major attributes of strategic thinking in practice” that resemble competencies:&lt;ref name="Liedtka" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Liedtka2"&gt;[http://www.nsw.ipaa.org.au/content/docs/Course-Readings---Dip-Gov-Policy-Development/3%20Liedtka.pdf Liedktka Strategic Thinking-Can It Be Taught?-Long Range Planning-1998]&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Systems perspective'', refers to being able to understand implications of strategic actions. "A strategic thinker has a mental model of the complete end-to-end system of value creation, his or her role within it, and an understanding of the competencies it contains."&lt;ref name="Liedtka" /&gt;&lt;!--page 31--&gt;
# ''Intent focused'' which means more determined and less distractible than rivals in the marketplace. Crediting Hamel and Prahalad with popularising the concept, Liedtka describes strategic intent as "the focus that allows individuals within an organization to marshal and leverage their energy, to focus attention, to resist distraction, and to concentrate for as long as it takes to achieve a goal."&lt;ref name="Liedtka" /&gt;&lt;!--p. 31--&gt;
# ''Thinking in time'' means being able to hold past, present and future in mind at the same time to create better decision making and speed implementation. "Strategy is not driven by future intent alone. It is the gap between today’s reality and intent for the future that is critical."&lt;ref name="Liedtka" /&gt;&lt;!--p. 31--&gt; Scenario planning is a practical application for incorporating "thinking in time" into strategy making.&lt;ref name=ST-RBK-10/&gt;
# ''Hypothesis driven'', ensuring that both creative and critical thinking are incorporated into strategy making. This competency explicitly incorporates the scientific method into strategic thinking.&lt;ref name="Liedtka2"/&gt;
# ''Intelligent opportunism'', which means being responsive to good opportunities. "The dilemma involved in using a well-articulated strategy to channel organisational efforts effectively and efficiently must always be balanced against the risks of losing sight of alternative strategies better suited to a changing environment."&lt;ref name="Liedtka"/&gt; &lt;!--p. 32--&gt;

'''The Mint Las Vegas''' was a hotel and casino in downtown [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]].

The Mint was the sponsor of the [[Mint 400]], the largest [[Off-roading|off road]] race from the mid-1960s to the mid-1980s.

The Mint was made famous (or infamous) as the first night's stay in [[Hunter S. Thompson]] and [[Oscar Zeta Acosta|Oscar Acosta]]'s legendary 1971 weekend trip to Las Vegas, immortalized in Thompson's novel ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]].''

== History ==
The Mint opened in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.earlyvegas.com/downtown.html|title=Old Downtown Vegas |author= |date= |work= |publisher=earlyvegas.com |accessdate=2009-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Milton Prell]], who also owned the [[Sahara Hotel and Casino]] and the [[Aladdin, Las Vegas|Aladdin Hotel and Casino]] on the [[Las Vegas Strip]], was one of the original owners of The Mint. Prell and his associates had engaged a firm to use a computer to come up with a list of possible names for this new addition to downtown Las Vegas. They had been working late into the night in Prell's home, when his wife Debbie came into the room and suggested the place be named The Mint.

[[Del Webb]] assumed ownership around 1961 when he acquired other properties of Milton Prell.

On April 6, 1962, Sahara-Nevada Corporation – the operating group of the Sahara and Mint – announced plans for a 22-story hotel skyscraper addition to the Mint. The addition was expected to be completed within 16 months, at a cost of $5 million. The addition would be built on the Mint's north parking lot, and was to include 300 additional hotel rooms and suites. A six-story, {{convert|210000|sqft|abbr=on}} parking garage would be connected to the new hotel building, and would include more than 550 parking spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Skyscraper Hotel To Be Erected (page one)|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/las-vegas-sun-apr-07-1962-p-1/|accessdate=December 14, 2017|work=Las Vegas Sun|date=April 7, 1962|via=NewspaperArchive.com|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Skyscraper Hotel To Be Erected (page two)|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/las-vegas-sun-apr-07-1962-p-6/|accessdate=December 14, 2017|work=Las Vegas Sun|date=April 7, 1962|via=NewspaperArchive.com|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1962, the city planned to review the permit for the new tower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=City to Review Permit For Mint Tower|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/las-vegas-sun-may-09-1962-p-10/|accessdate=December 14, 2017|work=Las Vegas Sun|date=May 9, 1962|via=NewspaperArchive.com|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[groundbreaking]] ceremony was held for the tower in July 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Mint Goes Up 22 Stories On Fremont St|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/las-vegas-sun-jul-22-1962-p-45/|accessdate=December 14, 2017|work=Las Vegas Sun|date=July 22, 1962|via=NewspaperArchive.com|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction was still ongoing in July 1964, at which point the tower was planned to include 24 floors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wade|first=Dell|title=Parade of Progress|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/las-vegas-sun-jul-26-1964-p-25/|accessdate=December 14, 2017|work=Las Vegas Sun|date=July 26, 1964|via=NewspaperArchive.com|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction reached the 24th floor at the end of the year, with plans for an additional four floors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wade|first=Dell|title=Year of Progress, Recession, Plans|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/a-j-other-articles-clipping-jan-03-1965-425820/|accessdate=December 8, 2017|work=Las Vegas Sun|date=January 3, 1965|via=NewspaperArchive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hotel tower was ultimately built with 26 stories, and was [[topped out]] on March 20, 1965, with plans to open later that month.&lt;ref name=Topped/&gt; The new tower stood {{convert|290|ft|abbr=on}}, and was one of the [[List of tallest buildings in Nevada|tallest buildings in the state]] at the time, ranking only behind [[The Landmark Hotel and Casino]], which stood {{convert|297|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barrows|first=Jim|title=Landmark Tower May Finally Have Owner|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/a-j-other-articles-clipping-may-18-1966-420724/|accessdate=December 8, 2017|work=Las Vegas Sun|date=May 18, 1966|via=NewspaperArchive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Landmark Tower Talk in Progress|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/a-j-other-articles-clipping-may-26-1966-420776/|accessdate=December 8, 2017|work=Las Vegas Sun|date=May 26, 1966|via=NewspaperArchive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renovations were also done to the existing building, which included work to the Merri Mint Theatre, and expanded dining areas.&lt;ref name=Topped&gt;{{cite news|title=New Mint Hotel 'Topped Off'|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/a-j-other-articles-clipping-mar-21-1965-426931/|accessdate=December 8, 2017|work=Las Vegas Sun|date=March 21, 1965|via=NewspaperArchive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, The Mint was sold and became part of [[Binion's Horseshoe]].

==Shows==
[[Patsy Cline]] performed at the Mint Casino's "Merri-Mint Theater" from November 23 - December 28, 1962, three months before her fatal plane crash. She appeared with [[Tompall &amp; the Glaser Brothers]], and at one point developed "Vegas Throat" due to the dry desert heat. For several shows Patsy [[Lip sync|lip-synched]] to her records. [[The Wilburn Brothers]], with [[Loretta Lynn]] as part of their act, played the Merri-Mint for a couple of nights in October 1962. According to author Larry Jordan, in his book "[[Jim Reeves]]: His Untold Story," Reeves also played at the Mint Casino in the early-1960s. Peter Urquidi, "Man of Many Sounds", played the Top of the Mint for more than a decade until the early-1970s. Upstairs in the lounge was the Johnny Elvis Foster show ''For The Love Of Elvis''. The Memphis Sound also played at the Mint&lt;!-- Needs clarification: "for 3 months from February 1978 though May 1981" --&gt;. [[Sidney Fields]] of [[Abbott and Costello]] fame appeared on the same bill in a comedy act.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==Film history ==
The casino appears in the 1964 film ''[[Viva Las Vegas]]'' and in the 1971 [[James Bond]] film ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]''. The Mint can be seen in the background toward the end of the 1984 film ''[[Starman (film)|Starman]]''. The casino can also be seen several times towards the end of the 1987 [[U2]] [[music video]] "[[I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For]]", which was filmed entirely on [[Fremont Street]]. A computer-generated reconstruction of the casino can be seen in the 1998 film ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film)|Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas]]''. The Mint is also seen in music videos by [[Panic! at the Disco]] from their 2013 album, ''[[Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die!]]''

'''''The Wolf of Wall Street''''' is a 2013 American [[biographical film| biographical]] [[black comedy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10579726/The-Wolf-of-Wall-Street-is-the-modern-equivalent-of-a-Shakespeare-play.html|title=The Wolf of Wall Street is the modern equivalent of a Shakespearean history play|first=Philip|last=Horne|date=October 4, 2017|accessdate=October 4, 2017|website=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[crime film|crime]] film directed by [[Martin Scorsese]] and written by [[Terence Winter]], based on the [[The Wolf of Wall Street (book)|memoir of the same name]] by [[Jordan Belfort]]. It recounts Belfort's perspective on his career as a stockbroker in [[New York City]] and how his firm [[Stratton Oakmont]] engaged in rampant corruption and fraud on [[Wall Street]] that ultimately led to his downfall. [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] (who was also a producer) stars as Belfort, with [[Jonah Hill]] as his business partner and friend Donnie Azoff, [[Margot Robbie]] as his wife Naomi Lapaglia and [[Kyle Chandler]] as Patrick Denham, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent who tries to bring him down. [[Matthew McConaughey]], [[Rob Reiner]], [[Jon Favreau]], [[Joanna Lumley]] and [[Jean Dujardin]] also star. The film marks the [[Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio|director's fifth collaboration with DiCaprio]], after ''[[Gangs of New York]]'' (2002), ''[[The Aviator (2004 film)|The Aviator]]'' (2004), ''[[The Departed]]'' (2006) and ''[[Shutter Island (film)|Shutter Island]]'' (2010), as well as his second collaboration with Winter after the television series ''[[Boardwalk Empire]]'' (2010–14).

''The Wolf of Wall Street'' premiered in New York City on December 17, 2013, and was released in the United States on December 25, 2013, distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]]. The film was the first to be released entirely through [[digital distribution]]. It was a major commercial success, grossing more than $392 million worldwide during its original theatrical run to become Scorsese's highest-grossing film and the 17th-highest-grossing film of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2=worldwide&amp;yr=2013&amp;p=.htm|title=2013 Yearly Box Office Results|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was controversial for its morally ambiguous depiction of events, explicit sexual content, extreme profanity, depiction of hard drug use and the [[Animals in film and television|use of animals]] during production.

==Plot==
In 1987, [[Jordan Belfort]] procures a job as a Wall Street stockbroker for [[L.F. Rothschild]], employed under Mark Hanna, who quickly entices him with the sex and drugs fueled stockbroker culture and passes on his idea that a stockbroker's only goal is to make money for himself. Jordan soon finds his career terminated following [[Black Monday (1987)|Black Monday]] and takes a job at a [[Boiler room (business)|boiler room brokerage firm]] on Long Island that specializes in [[penny stock]]s. Thanks to his aggressive pitching style and the high commissions, Jordan makes a small fortune.

Jordan befriends his neighbor, Donnie Azoff, and the two found their own company. They recruit several of Jordan's friends, whom Jordan trains in the art of the "hard sell". The basic method of the firm is a [[pump and dump]] scam. To cloak this, Jordan gives the firm the respectable-sounding name of [[Stratton Oakmont]]. After an exposé in ''[[Forbes]]'', hundreds of ambitious young financiers flock to his company. Jordan becomes immensely successful and slides into a decadent lifestyle of prostitutes and drugs. He has an affair with a woman named Naomi Lapaglia. When his wife finds out, Jordan divorces her and marries Naomi. Meanwhile, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] begin investigating Stratton Oakmont. Jordan illegally makes $22 million in three hours upon securing the [[Initial public offering|IPO]] of [[Steve Madden (company)|Steve Madden]]. This brings him and his firm further to the attention of the FBI. To hide his money, Jordan opens a [[Swiss bank account]] with corrupt banker Jean-Jacques Saurel in the name of Naomi's Aunt Emma, who is a British national and thus outside the reach of American authorities. He uses the wife and in-laws of his friend Brad Bodnick, who have European passports, to smuggle the cash into Switzerland.

Donnie gets into a public brawl with Brad, and, while Donnie escapes, Brad is arrested. Brad does not say a word about Donnie or Jordan to the police. Jordan learns from his private investigator that the FBI is wiretapping his phones. Fearing for his son, Jordan's father advises him to leave Stratton Oakmont and lie low while Jordan's lawyer negotiates a deal to keep him out of prison. Jordan, however, cannot bear to quit and talks himself into staying in the middle of his farewell speech. Jordan, Donnie, and their wives are on a yacht trip to Italy when they learn that Aunt Emma has died of a heart attack. Jordan decides to travel to Switzerland immediately to settle the bank account. To bypass border controls, he orders his yacht captain to sail to Monaco, but the ship is capsized in a storm. After their rescue, the plane sent to take them to Geneva is destroyed when a seagull flies into the engine. Jordan takes this as a sign from God and decides to sober up.

Two years later, the FBI arrests Jordan because Saurel, arrested in Florida on an unrelated charge, has informed the FBI on Jordan. Since the evidence against him is overwhelming, Jordan agrees to gather evidence on his colleagues in exchange for leniency. Now fed up with Jordan's lifestyle, Naomi tells Jordan she is divorcing him and wants full custody of their children. Infuriated, Jordan hits Naomi twice, insults her as a "[[cunt]]" and tries to run off with his daughter Skylar in his car, but he ends up crashing in the driveway. The next morning, Jordan wears a wire to work but slips a note to Donnie warning him. Donnie keeps the note and rats out Jordan to the FBI. Jordan is arrested for breaching his co-operation deal. The FBI raids and shuts down Stratton Oakmont. Despite his breach, Jordan receives a reduced sentence for his testimony and serves three years in a minimum security prison. After his release, Jordan makes a living hosting seminars on sales technique.

===Development===
In 2007, [[Leonardo DiCaprio]]/[[Warner Bros.]] won a bidding war against [[Brad Pitt]]/[[Paramount Pictures]] for the rights to Jordan Belfort's memoir ''The Wolf of Wall Street'', and Martin Scorsese was considered to direct the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Pamela McClintock |url=https://variety.com/2007/film/news/scorsese-dicaprio-cry-wolf-1117961782/ |title=Scorsese, DiCaprio cry ‘Wolf’ |newspaper=Variety |date=2007-03-25 |accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hollywood Reporter" /&gt; During pre-production, Scorsese worked on the film's script before working on ''[[Shutter Island (film)|Shutter Island]]''. He describes having "wasted five months of [his] life" without getting a [[Green-light|green light]] on production dates by the Warner Bros. studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jerry |last=Saravia |title=Raging Bull of Cinema Part II|url=http://jerrysaravia.blogspot.com/2011/08/raging-of-bull-of-cinema-part-2.html |date=June 5, 2013 |accessdate=June 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan Belfort made $1 million on the movie rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Charlie Gasparino |url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/2013/03/12/wolf-wall-street-gets-1m-pay-day-for-movie-rights/ |title='Wolf of Wall Street' Gets $1M Pay Day for Movie Rights |publisher=Fox Business |date=2013-03-12 |accessdate=2014-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140217034106/http://www.foxbusiness.com/2013/03/12/wolf-wall-street-gets-1m-pay-day-for-movie-rights/ |archivedate=February 17, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Warner Bros. had offered [[Ridley Scott]] to direct the film, with Leonardo DiCaprio playing the male lead,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fleming |first=Mike |url=http://www.deadline.com/2010/07/ridley-scott-eyeing-reteam-with-leo-dicaprio-on-the-wolf-of-wall-street/ |title=Ridley Scott Eyeing Reteam With Leo DiCaprio On 'The Wolf Of Wall Street' |publisher=Deadline.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the studio eventually dumped the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fleming |first=Mike |url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/05/cannes-red-granite-acquires-leonardo-dicaprio-pic-the-wolf-of-wall-street/ |title=Cannes: Red Granite Acquires Leonardo DiCaprio Pic 'The Wolf Of Wall Street' |publisher=Deadline.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a green light was given by the [[Independent film|independent company]] [[Red Granite Pictures]] allowing no restrictions to the content development.

The FBI has issued subpoenas to several past and present employees of Red Granite Pictures in regards to allegations that US$155&amp;nbsp;million was diverted from the Malaysian wealth fund [[1MDB]] to help finance ''The Wolf of Wall Street''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/malaysias-1mdb-the-secret-money-behind-the-wolf-of-wall-street-1459531987|title=The Secret Money Behind 'The Wolf of Wall Street'|first1=Bradley|last1=Hope|first2=John R.

In the film, most of the real-life characters' names have been changed from Belfort's original memoir. Donnie Azoff is based on [[Danny Porush]].

Perlberg reported cheers from the audience at what he considered to be all the wrong moments—"When Belfort — a drug addict attempting to remain sober — rips up a couch cushion to get to his secret coke stash, there were cheers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/banker-pros-cheer-wolf-of-wall-street-2013-12|title=Banker Pros Cheer At Wolf Of Wall Street|publisher=Business Insider|date=19 December 2013|accessdate=12 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- 2nd ref shows [[WP:NOTABLE]] --&gt;&lt;ref name="vf"&gt;{{cite web|date=26 December 2013|author=Katey Rich|title=The Wolf of Wall Street Is Enraging Moviegoers, Thrilling Bankers, And Making Tons Of Cash|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/online/oscars/2013/12/the-wolf-of-wall-street-christmas-box-office|quote=meaning audiences liked it less than everything else currently in theaters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former [[Assistant United States Attorney]] who prosecuted the real Belfort criticized both the movie and the book on which it is based. He said he believes some of Belfort's claims were "invented", as for instance "[Belfort] aggrandized his importance and reverence for him by others at his firm." He strongly criticizes the film for not depicting the "thousands of [scam] victims who lost hundreds of millions of dollars", not accepting the filmmakers' argument that it would have detracted attention from the wrongdoers. Furthermore, he deplores the ending—"beyond an insult" to his victims—in which the real Belfort appears, while showing "a large sign advertising the name of Mr. Belfort's real motivational speaking company", and a positive depiction of Belfort uttering "variants of the same falsehoods he trained others to use against his victims".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cohen|first1=Joel M.|title=The Real Belfort Story Missing From 'Wolf' Movie|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/07/the-real-belfort-story-missing-from-wolf-movie/?_r=0|accessdate=9 November 2014|publisher=New York Times|date=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas Mellon Evans''' (September 8, 1910 – July 17, 1997) was a [[financier]] who was one of the early [[corporate raid]]ers in [[United States|American]] business&lt;ref&gt;[http://alumninet.yale.edu/classes/yc1964/remembrances/evans.htm Yale University reprint of January 5, 2011 Washington Post article]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a [[philanthropist]] and a prominent [[Thoroughbred]] racehorse owner and breeder who won the 1981 [[Kentucky Derby]] and [[Preakness Stakes]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1124494/index.htm Sports Illustrated - May 3, 1981]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pioneer takeover specialist==
Born James Evans in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], to Thomas Mellon Evans and Martha Jarnagin, his mother had his name changed to honor his recently deceased father in 1913. Evans's great-grandmother Elinor was the sister of Thomas Mellon, the father of the wealthy financier, [[Andrew W. Mellon]].&lt;ref&gt;''The White Sharks of Wall Street'': by Diana B. Henriques&lt;/ref&gt; Orphaned as a young boy, Thomas was sent to stay with his mother's relatives in [[Tennessee]] before returning to Pittsburgh to live with his mother's sister. She and her husband were affluent enough to provide Thomas with a quality education and he graduated from the [[Shady Side Academy]] private school in 1927 &lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NL8aAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KkoEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2691,5413670&amp;dq=thomas-mellon-evans+shady+side+academy&amp;hl=en Pittsburgh Press - June 17, 1927]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Yale University]] in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bx4cAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Wn0EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1958,3606813&amp;dq=thomas-mellon-evans+yale+university&amp;hl=en Sarasota Herald-Tribune - July 19, 1997]&lt;/ref&gt;

For a few years after finishing university, Thomas Evans held a clerical job at [[Gulf Oil]], owned at the time by the [[Mellon family]]. Ambitious, he saved as much money as he could from his salary and together with a small inheritance, set out on his own. In 1939, he was able to purchase the bankrupt H.K. Porter, Inc., a manufacturer of light-duty [[Locomotive|railroad locomotives]] that he would diversify into the steel, hardware, and construction material business before converting the company into a [[holding company|holding corporation]] that would, during Evans time, take over more than eighty U.S. companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.post-gazette.com/books/reviews/20000723review530.asp Pittsburgh Post-Gazette - July 23,2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among his major acquisitions was the 1959 takeover of [[Crane Co.]] of [[Chicago]], then a large valve and plumbing fixture manufacturer. In April 1959 Evans was appointed [[Chairman of the Board]] and [[Chief executive officer]] of the company.
&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/djreprints/access/110517107.html?dids=110517107:110517107&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Apr+29%2C+1959&amp;author=&amp;pub=Wall+Street+Journal&amp;desc=Crane+Co.+Names+Evans+Chairman%2C+Top+Officer+As+President+Resigns&amp;pqatl=google Wall Street Journal - April 29, 1959]&lt;/ref&gt; As of the end of 2011, his son Robert is Chairman of the Board of Crane Co.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ir.craneco.com/directors.cfm Crane.co website]&lt;/ref&gt; and remains the largest individual shareholder in the company.&lt;ref&gt;[https://finance.yahoo.com/q/mh?s=CR+Major+Holders Yahoo Finance - retrieved November 22, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

The July 23, 2000, edition of the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' said that Thomas Mellon Evans was "arguably one of the seminal figures of 20th-century business."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.post-gazette.com/books/reviews/20000723review530.asp ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'' - July 23,2000]&lt;/ref&gt; Evans' story was told by [[Diana B. Henriques]] in her book ''The White Sharks of Wall Street: Thomas Mellon Evans and the Original Corporate Raiders'' published by [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner]] in 2000 ({{ISBN|0684833999}} - Library of Congress Online Catalog).

==Buckland Farm==
In 1956, Evans bought a 495-acre cattle farm in [[Gainesville, Virginia]], and converted it to a Thoroughbred breeding operation under the name Buckland Farm.  The farm was managed and directed by Don M. Robertson, General Manager of the farm and a Vice President of its incorporation.  Robertson, a Central Kentucky native whose family heritage consisted of a long line of excellent Thoroughbred horsemen, chose the matches between stallions and mares for Buckland Farm.  It was Robertson who produced the winning bloodlines for the farm, including Pleasant Colony.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E7DE1F38F93BA25754C0A961958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print New York Times - July 18, 1997]&lt;/ref&gt; During Evans' years in racing, [[Horse trainer|trainers]] who conditioned his horses included [[John P. Campo|John Campo]],  [[Angel Cordero Jr.]], [[Leroy Jolley]], Ross Pearce, and Christopher Speckert.

In addition to [[Pleasant Colony]], Thomas Evans owned a number of [[Graded stakes race|stakes]] winners including  [[Pleasant Stage]], winner of the 1991 [[Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies]] and  [[American Champion Two-Year-Old Filly]], plus the 1992 [[American Champion Older Male Horse]], [[Pleasant Tap]].

Thomas Evans was a member of the Board of Directors of the [[National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame]] and a member of [[The Jockey Club]], the [[Thoroughbred Owners and Breeders Association]], and the Virginia Thoroughbred Association. In 1993, he was inducted into the Virginia Thoroughbred Association Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vabred.org/halloffame.cfm Virginia Thoroughbred Association Hall of Fame] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220054942/http://www.vabred.org/halloffame.cfm |date=2012-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sons Edward and Robert became significant owners and/or breeders of Thoroughbred racehorses, with Robert owning the [[2014 Belmont Stakes]] winner [[Tonalist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more-sports/no-triple-crown-tonalist-wins-belmont-california-chrome-5th-article-1.1821086|title=No Triple Crown as Tonalist wins Belmont; California Chrome 4th|website=NY Daily News|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drf.com/news/family-ties-run-deep-belmont-winner-tonalist-owner-evans|title=Family ties run deep for Belmont winner Tonalist, owner Evans|website=Daily Racing Form|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''upper echelons theory''' is a [[management theory]] published by [[Donald C. Hambrick]] and P. Mason in 1984.&lt;ref name="hm84"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.2307/258434| issn = 0363-7425| volume = 9| issue = 2| pages = 193–206| last1 = Hambrick| first1 = Donald C.| last2 = Mason| first2 = Phyllis A.| title = Upper Echelons: The Organization as a Reflection of Its Top Managers| journal = The Academy of Management Review| date = 1984| jstor=258434}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It states that organizational outcomes are partially predicted by managerial background characteristics of the top level management team.&lt;ref name="hm84"/&gt;

== History ==
[[Donald C. Hambrick]], a strategic management professor and P. Mason first published an article about the upper echelon perspective in 1984. The article is cited over 10,000 times &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Upper Echelons: The Organization as a Reflection of Its Top Managers|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=+%22Upper+Echelons%3A+The+Organization+as+a+Reflection+of+Its+Top+Managers%22&amp;btnG=&amp;as_sdt=1%2C5&amp;as_sdtp=|website=scholar.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several additional articles in this field of research have been published over the last decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carpenter|first1=Mason A.|last2=Geletkanycz|first2=Marta A.|last3=Sanders|first3=Wm. Gerard|title=Upper Echelons Research Revisited: Antecedents, Elements, and Consequences of Top Management Team Composition|journal=Journal of Management|date=23 June 2016|volume=30|issue=6|pages=749–778|doi=10.1016/j.jm.2004.06.001|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jm.2004.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Premise ==
The theory tries to explain a correlation between the organizational outcome and managerial background characteristics.

== Application fields ==
The theory is used in human resource management as a framework helping to hire new executives. In addition to that, the theory can be used to analyze other market competitors or listed companies and predict future strategic decisions of CEOs.

The newspaper was founded in 1996 to compete with well-established rivals including ''[[Oil &amp; Gas Journal]]'', ''[[Petroleum Intelligence Weekly]]'', and ''[[Offshore Engineer]]''. It covers all aspects of the upstream industry, but focuses especially on news related to business, policy and the sector's key players as well as the commercial side of the industry.  Coverage includes exploration, field development, contracts, company news, technological developments and the liquefied natural gas sector, as well as political and financial news which affects the exploration and production sector.&lt;ref name=nyt120604/&gt;&lt;ref name=lat070903&gt;

It provides breaking news and online feature articles written by a dedicated online editorial team, as well as giving access to digital versions of the newspaper in various formats.
