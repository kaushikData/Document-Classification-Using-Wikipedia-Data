'''Agham Kot''' ({{lang-ur|  اگهم کوٹ  }}) or is located in [[Hyderabad District, Pakistan|Hyderabad District]], [[Sindh]], [[Pakistan]].

It is also known as Agham. The Lohánas. Agham, or Agham-kot, lies about thirty miles south-east from [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]], and though now almost forgotten, it was formerly a place of some consequence. Its position is not very easily identified, and the name is rarely introduced into the maps. In Lt. Burton’s it seems to be entered under the name of "Angoomanoo," and in the Quartermaster-General’s map of 1850, under that of "Aghamama."The Beg-Lar Náma says it is on the Rain. The Tuhfatu-l Kirám mentions it among the towns on the Sánkra. Capt. McMurdo says it is on the Lohána Daryá; but he strangely fixes its site at Kalákot, seven miles to the west of Thatta.&lt;ref name="scribd"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/12364288/History-of-India |title=History of India|publisher=scribd.com|accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
It is also called [[Agham Lohana]]. In the [[Chachnama|Chach-nama]], we find
frequent mention of a chief under that name, who was governor of
Brahmanabad in the time of Chach. [[Lohana]] is the designation of
a powerful tribe, which at that period, under an apparent confusion
of terms, is said to have included both the Samma and Lakha clans.
It can merely mean that they were then in a position of comparative
subordination. Under all the vicissitudes the Lohanas have under-
gone, they still retain their credit, as well as their religion, and
constitute the most influential tribe in Sind, whether regarded as
merchants or officials. But, not confined within that narrow province, they have spread their ramifications beyond the western
borders of India, and are found dispersed throughout Afghanistan,
Buluchistan, and Arabia, exposed to inconveniences, insults, and
dangers of no ordinary kind, in pursuit of their darling object of
wealth, and final return to their native soil to enjoy the fruits of
their industry.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Riders on the Wind: Travels Through Pakistan|author=Rashid, S.|date=1992|publisher=Sang-e-Meel Publications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m1MgAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
As the town of Agham is mentioned as early as the time of
Muhammad Bin Qasim, we may presume that it derived its name from
the Lohana chieftain above-mentioned, who was the contemporary
and opponent of Ohach.

== "The Downfall of Sindh." ==

The Tdrikh-i TdUri (p.&amp;nbsp;51) refers this chronogram to the period
when Shah Husain plundered Thatta, on the ground of extravagant
joy having been evinced by its inhabitants upon the death of his
father, Shah Beg; but this is evidently a mistake, and is adopted
merely to accommodate his false chronology. &lt;br /&gt;
It is being considered that the famous ruler of Iran Nadir Shah or some say it Madad Shah raided the great state of Agham Kot and then they came to end. But in Chach-nama it is clearly written that Maharaja Chach raided Agham Kot and married widow of Maharaja Agham Luhana and aghamano near gulab laghari district badin.also wataya faqir and his mother live in agham kot or madad ali pathan ne ag di thi.

== The Death of Shah Beg Aryhun ==

Authorities differ greatly respecting the time and place of Shah
Beg's death. The Tarldtan-nama states that it occurred in Sha'ban,
926 H., not far from Chanduka, said in the Tdrilch-i Stud (MS. p.
196) to be thirty kos west of Bhakkar, and that the accession of
Mirza Shah Husain was celebrated where Shah Bog died.

Ffrishta says he died in 930 n., but mentions no place.

Mir Ma'sum (MS. p.&amp;nbsp;154) says, he died after leaving Bhakkar, on
his way to Gujrat, in the same page Agham is the particular spot
implied and that the words Shahr-SJia'Mii (" month of Sha'ban ")
represent the date of his death, i.e. 9 928 ir. (1522&amp;nbsp;A.D.). That very
night, he adds, Shah Husain was proclaimed his successor, and,
three years afterwards, Shah Beg's coffin wan convoyed to Mecca,
where a lofty tomb was erected over it. He mentions (MS. p.&amp;nbsp;171)
that Shah Husain's succession took place at Nawrpur, though he has
previously led us to suppose it was Agham.

The Tdrtth-i Tdhthrt (MS. p.&amp;nbsp;49) says that his death took place in
924 n. "some say it occurred in Multan, some in Kandahar."

The Tuhfatu-l Kiram (MS. p.&amp;nbsp;42) states that he died at Agham on
the 23rd of Sha'ban, 928 ir. It is mentioned that work also, that
this month represents tho date of his death. Tho author gives satis-
factory reasons why the reports just quoted from tho Tdrikh-i Tdluri
must necessarily be both incorrect.

Under those conflicting evidences, we may rust JiBsurred that the
chronogram is correct, and that Shah Beg Arghun, the conqueror of
Sind, died at Agham, on the 23rd of the month Sha'bun, 928 A, II.
(18 July 1522&amp;nbsp;A.D.)&lt;ref name="archive"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/historyofindiavo025028mbp/historyofindiavo025028mbp_djvu.txt |title=Full text of "The History Of India.Vol-I" |publisher=archive.org|accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prince Agham ==
{{main article|Agham Lohana}}
"[[Agham Lohana|Prince Agham]]" was the ruler of [[Mansura (Brahmanabad)|Brahmanabad]]. Further nothing is found about him in the history. Chach Of Alor battled Prince Agham and defeated him and became governor of Brahmanabad. Then he married widow of Prince Agham.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of India, as told by its own historians.

== Present Aghams ==
Nowadays Aghams, the descendants of Maharaja Agham live at different places in Sindh. One of those places is Village Jumo Khan Agham, a small city located about 4 kilometers from [[Ratodero]]. The compiler of this article Arsalan Jabbar Abro also belongs to Village Jumo Khan Agham.

'''Alur''' are an ethnic group who live in northwestern [[Uganda]] and northeastern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC). They are part of the larger [[Luo peoples|Luo]] group.

In Uganda, they live mainly in the [[Nebbi District|Nebbi]], [[Zombo District|Zombo]], and [[Arua District|Arua]] districts, in the DRC, they reside mostly north of [[Lake Albert (Africa)|Lake Albert]].

==Language==
Most members of the group speak [[Alur dialect|Alur]], a language closely related to [[Junam language |Dojunam]] [[Acholi language|Acholi]] and [[Adhola dialect|Adhola]].  Some Alur speak [[Lendu language|Lendu]] or [[Kebu language|Kebu]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}
Alur language dialects vary considerably. The highland Alur (Okoro) speak a slightly different dialect from the lowland Alur (Jonam), and it might be difficult to for a native highland Alur person to properly understand his lowland kinsman.

==Chiefdoms==
The Alur Kingdom is probably the only one that was unaffected by the Ugandan ban on traditional monarchies [[History of Uganda (1962–71)|in 1966]].&lt;ref name=jaluo&gt;http://www.jaluo.com/sigendniluo/ojangasego051103.html&lt;/ref&gt; All Alur Kings are referred to as "Rwoth", just like all Luo Chiefs and Kings. The current Alur King is Rwoth Phillip Rauni Olarker, whose coronation was in 2010.

When the Europeans arrived, the Alur people were organized in ten chiefdoms, namely: Angal, Juganda, Jukoth, Mukambu, War Palara, Panduru, Ukuru, Paidha, Padeo and Panyikano. Based on the royal spear head bearing tradition, the Ubimu of Alur tribe H.M Philip Olarker Rauni III is the supreme ruler of the entire Alur tribe, with his capital at Kaal Atyak Winam, Zombo district, Uganda.&lt;ref name=Aidan&gt;Aidan 1953: ''The Alur Society; a Study in Processes and Types of Domination''&lt;/ref&gt;

In Angal, the current chief is Rwoth Djalore Serge II. He took over from his late father Kamanda who died in 1998. All these sub tribes of the Alur descended directly from King Nyipir lineage.

==History, politics and clan life==
The largest Alur clan was the Ukuru clan, who counted ten thousand adult men in 1914, although Alur counted boys as young as fourteen years as men.

The Ukuru clan was founded in 1630 when Ngira, a member of the Aryak family migrated with a number of young men including his younger brother Ijira. They took over the territory from the indigenous Bantu inhabitants. The region was quickly alurized.&lt;ref name=Aidan/&gt;

The descendants of the original Bantu men now form the Abira family. Bantu maternal ancestry is very common in Ukuru. The Ukuru clan grew in competition with other clans. Some other clans where completely taken over providing the Ukuru clan with more food resources, women and men to defend their territory.&lt;ref name=Aidan/&gt;

Other clans were dominated from afar. In 1789 the Ukuru clan defeated the Panduru clan to become the most powerful Alur clan. For years the Ukuru clan was the most powerful, populous and largest Alur clan.&lt;ref name=Aidan/&gt;

Meanwhile, in the Ukuru clan, the Atyak family was losing his importance. For generations the Atyak family provided the Rwhoth, Chief. Alur society is strictly hierarchical. Men have a higher social standing, then women and the men themselves also have a strict hierarchy.&lt;ref name=Aidan/&gt;

Social rank depended on a lot of things – assertiveness, number of friends and family (allies), performance on male prestige tasks (war, patrols, hunting and fishing). Rank is in theory not heritability. But a men who had a high-ranking father had, as a rule, more brothers, cousins, and family and was better able to attract allies. But overall every man could reach a high status with the right mix of qualities.&lt;ref name=Aidan/&gt;

Every Alur men from sixteen years old could vote which men were to become the chief. Only a man who is already high-ranking could become a chief.&lt;ref name=Aidan/&gt;

The Alur have a tendency to choose young men as chiefs but if he is a good chief he stays chief for life. Alur clans are in fact a number of patrilineages living together. Most clans have around five patrilineages but the Ukuru clan has 11 patrilineages.&lt;ref name=Aidan/&gt;

These patrilineages can include large numbers of men, all descendants of the same man. The Parombo family (patrilineage) in the Ukuru clan, for example, include two thousand men in 1949. These patrilineages are not strictly fictional. The Alur are very serious about it and maintain a family tree. Of course, a certain level of flexibility has occurred but overall we can trust the picture the Alur paint over their patrilineages. By 1820 the other Patrilineages worked together to prevent an Atyak man from becoming Rwoth. This decline in Atyak power resulted in the rapid growth of other Patrilieages like the Parombo, Palei and The Aryek. In particular the Aryek family became politically important.&lt;ref name=Aidan/&gt;

High rank confers many advantages in Alur society. Expect respect and admiration high-ranking men had first choice in food, especially prestige food like meat and beer. High-ranking men typically had a large number of cattle and since the Alur paid the bride price in cattle high-ranking men had the most wives and thus children. The chief typically had the most children of every man in the clan. High-ranking men had three or more wives, average men two and low-ranking men typically one. As always there was flexibility since low-ranking men could be very successful in tending cattle and thus acquiring wives but then their rank typically rose.&lt;ref name=Aidan/&gt;

Men always stayed in the clan they were born in but women married men from other clans and moved there. Very few women married men from their own clan since the Alur had very strict rules about incest avoidances. Every man from your Patrilineages was un-marriageable no matter how long ago the common ancestor was. Since Alur fathers typically arranged marriages for their daughters outside the own clan only a specific request from a man from the own clan could keep an Alur woman in her own clan.&lt;ref name=Aidan/&gt;

==Day to day life==
Traditionally, the Alur live in grass-thatched huts. The homesteads in Alur clans lay in the central part of their territory. This helps keeps the territory under their control. The Alur were farmer-herders. The Alur grew (and grow) millet, cassava, maize, sweet potatoes, spinach, and pumpkins. They herded cattle, goats, and chickens. Goat and chicken were important sources of meat. Other important resources were salt, forest and wild animals all who were protected from other clans. In the drought season fishing was important. This sound paradox, but then the large herds of animals the Alur typically hunt as secondary sources of meat as not to exhaust their own goat and chicken numbers, moved away to greener pastures.&lt;ref name=Aidan/&gt;

In Alur society men did most of the work. They herded the domestic animals, grew the crops, built the huts, hunted, fished and dominated political life. The women were responsible for keeping house, rearing the children and cooking. Although at first glance it look like the men have more work but in fact the men have more pasture than women. Many of the men jobs are bound to strict times(they hunted in large groups just once a month for example) while the work women do is very monotonous. The sexes are segregated by the Alur. Wife and husband have their own hut. The men sleep alone and the women and children together. They also eat separately.&lt;ref name=Aidan/&gt;

Women and men also keep their space in social life and rarely mix. This behavior is not enforced by the men but it is in the women's best interest to minimize contact with men out fear of aggression and their husband's jealousy. Alur men are very close and social with men from their own clan. They hunt, farm, fish, go to war, herded, patrols, form coalitions against rivals together. Since Alur men stay in the clan they are born in and women move to the clan of their husband are the men by the Alur typically more social, have more friends and a wider social network than women. This is a very important factor for male dominance by the Alur. Land is not individual by the Alur. All men of a particular patrilineage can use land to plant crops to feed their families.&lt;ref name=Aidan/&gt;

==Famous Alur people==

* Chief Amula (1871–1942)
Amula was born in the aryek patrilineage as the son of Alworuna and acoamfa(2). The fortunes of the aryek family has been rising before amula birth(2). the first known aryek patriarch, Abok Ucweda had been an insigifant man in the politics of the Ukuru clan(2). The same couldn"t be said for some of his sons(2). Ugena had been chief for five years (1845–1850) before being deposed with help from his half-brother Nziri,amula paternal grandfather(2). Amula father Alworuna had been known to be the best warrior of the ukuru clan(2). Three brothers of Alworuna, Amatho, Kubi and Avur also managed to become powerful, respected man(2). Four of amula brothers, including his full brother Aryem also become powerful(2). Amula grew partially up in the distaster of the 1878 Ukuru-Panduru war which the ukuru clan lost and around 600 ukuru men died in a few days of intense fighting(2). Amula father Alworuna was burned alive by panduru forces led by their chief Ujuru(2). Amula uncle Amatho died trying avenge his brother death(2). Amula grew up to be a powerful man who rapidly rose in the social hierarchy from the age of fifteen(2). In 1890, at nineteen years old, he was elected as the chief of the Ukuru clan(2). He immediately began a war with the Panduru clan and managed to avenge his father's death(2). Afterwards he consolidated his hold on the Ukuru clan by entering into allegiances with other powerful patrilineage mainly with the Palei, Parombo and sections of the Patek patrilineage(2). He also could count on the support of many individual men(2). Amula proved to be a good chief, strong willed but compassionate(2). He was skillful in wars partly because of his ability to secure alliances with other clans(2). He was the voice of reason when the British arrived in 914, compelling the clan not to fight them(2). He was exiled by the British in 1917 for not rigidly following their orders but was allowed back in 1922(2). He died in 1942, still very popular and loved by the clan(2). As a chief, Amula had many wives and thus children(2). His son Jalusiga (1896–1978) succeeded him as chief although this was  British doing and no choice of the clan(2). Another son of his, Jalaure (born in 1888), acted as chief in his absence from 1917–1922(2).

==History==

Although a few Armenians lived in Abkhazia in the Middle Ages, significant Armenian immigration to Abkhazia began in the late 19th century when much of Abkhazia became depopulated due to the [[Circassian genocide|exodus of many Abkhaz]] of Muslim descent to the [[Ottoman Empire]] after the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] crackdown on the rebellion in Abkhazia; at the same time anti-Armenian pogroms started in Turkey and the attitude of the [[Sublime Porte|Porte]] towards its [[Armenians_in_the_Ottoman_Empire#Western_Armenia,_1829–1918|Armenian subjects]] became increasingly more brutal.&lt;ref name=landa&gt;Л.С.

Armenians made up a quarter of the Abkhaz army; twenty Armenians were awarded the title of Abkhazian Hero and 242 were killed in battle.

==Demography==

The earliest reliable records for Abkhazia are the Family Lists compiled in 1886 (published 1893 in Tbilisi), according to which the Sukhum District's population was 69,000 of which 28,000 were [[Abkhaz people|Abkhaz]]. The Armenians in that list totalled 1,090.

According to the [[Russian Empire Census|1897 census]] there were 58,697 people in Abkhazia who listed Abkhaz as their mother tongue.&lt;ref&gt;1-я Всеобщая перепись населения Российской Империи 1897 г. Кутаисская губерния. Спб: 1905. С. 32б retrieved from "АБХАЗИЯ-1992: ПОСТОКОММУНИСТИЧЕСКАЯ ВАНДЕЯ" by [[Svetlana Chervonnaya]].&lt;/ref&gt; There were about 1,500 Armenians in the Sukhumi district (Abkhazia) at that time; its total population was nearly 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gatchina3000.ru/brockhaus-and-efron-encyclopedic-dictionary/098/98427.htm Sukhum] in [[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary]] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian, Armenian and Georgian population grew faster than Abkhaz, due to the large-scale migration enforced especially during the rule of [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Lavrentiy Beria]].

'''Cape Verdean Creole''' is a [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]-based [[creole language]] spoken on the islands of [[Cape Verde]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Steve and Trina Graham |date=10 August 2004 |title=West Africa Lusolexed Creoles Word List File Documentation | url=http://www.sil.org/silesr/2004/silesr2004-012.htm#ST1 | publisher=[[SIL International]] | accessdate=August 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also called {{lang|kea|kriolu}} or {{lang|kea|kriol}} by its native speakers. It is the native creole language of virtually all Cape Verdeans and is used as a second creole language by the [[Cape Verdean diaspora]].

The creole has particular importance for [[creolistics]] studies since it is the oldest (still-spoken) creole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dulce Pereira|title = Crioulos de Base Portuguesa|publisher=Caminho|date = October 2006|ISBN = 978-972-21-1822-4|quote = o [crioulo] de Cabo Verde [é] o mais antigo que se conhece|page = 24|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the most widely spoken Portuguese-based creole language.

== Name ==
The current designation of this creole is Cape Verdean Creole. However, in everyday usage the creole is simply called {{lang|kea|kriolu}} ('Creole') by its speakers. The names Cape Verdean ({{lang|pt|cabo-verdiano}} in Portuguese, {{lang|kea|kabuverdianu}} in Cape Verdean Creole) and Cape Verdean creole ({{lang|pt|língua cabo-verdiana}} in Portuguese, {{lang|kea|língua kabuverdianu}} in the Sotavento dialect of Cape Verdean Creole and {{lang|kea|língua kabverdian}} in the Barlavento dialect) have been proposed for whenever the creole will be standardized.

== Origins ==
[[Image:0LivroET.jpg|left|thumb|200px|''[[Morna (music)|Mornas]] – cantigas crioulas'' by Eugénio Tavares,&lt;br&gt;one of the first books with creole texts.]]

The history of Cape Verdean Creole is hard to trace due to a lack of written documentation and to ostracism during the Portuguese administration of Cape Verde.

There are presently three theories about the formation of Creole.&lt;ref&gt;Santos, C., "Cultura e comunicação: um estudo no âmbito da sociolinguística"&lt;/ref&gt; The [[monogenetic theory of pidgins|monogenetic theory]] claims that the creole was formed by the Portuguese by simplifying the Portuguese language in order to make it accessible to African slaves. That is the point of view of authors like Prudent, Waldman, Chaudenson, Lopes da Silva. Authors like Adam and Quint argue that Creole was formed by African slaves using the grammar of Western African languages and replacing the African lexicon with the Portuguese one. Linguists like [[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky]] and [[Derek Bickerton|Bickerton]] argue that Creole was formed spontaneously, not by slaves from continental Africa, but by the population born in the islands, using the grammar with which all human beings are born; this would explain how creoles localized several miles away have [[language bioprogram theory#Syntactic similarities|similar grammatical structures]], even though they have a different lexical basis.

According to A. Carreira,&lt;ref&gt;Carreira, A. (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; Cape Verdean Creole was formed from a Portuguese [[pidgin]], on the island of Santiago, starting from the 15th century. That pidgin was then transported to the west coast of Africa by the ''[[lançados]]''. From there, that pidgin diverged into two [[proto-Creoles]], one that was the base of all Cape Verdean Creoles, and another that was the base of the [[Guinea-Bissau Creole]].

Cross referencing information regarding the settlement of each island with the linguistic comparisons, it is possible to conjecture some conclusions. The spreading of Cape Verdean Creole within the islands was done in three phases:&lt;ref&gt;Pereira, D. (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;
* In a first phase, the island of Santiago was occupied (2nd half of the 15th century), followed by Fogo (end of the 16th century).
* In a second phase, the island of São Nicolau was occupied (mostly in the 2nd half of the 17th century), followed by Santo Antão (mostly in the 2nd half of the 17th century).
* In a third phase, the remaining islands were occupied by settlers from the first islands: Brava was occupied by population from Fogo (mostly in the beginning of the 18th century), Boa Vista by population from São Nicolau and Santiago (mostly in the 1st half of the 18th century), Maio by population from Santiago and Boa Vista (mostly in the 2nd half of the 18th century), São Vicente by population from Santo Antão and São Nicolau (mostly in the 19th century), Sal by population from São Nicolau and Boa Vista (mostly in the 19th century).

In spite of Creole being the [[first language]] of nearly all the population in Cape Verde, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] is still the [[official language]]. As Portuguese is used in everyday life (at school, in administration, in official acts, in relations with foreign countries, etc.), Portuguese and Cape Verdean Creole live in a state of [[diglossia]].&lt;ref&gt;Duarte, D. A. (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this overall presence of Portuguese, a [[decreolization]] process occurs for all the different Cape Verdean Creole variants.

: Translation to Portuguese:
:: Aquela mulher com quem eu encontrei-me ontem estava preocupada porque ela esqueceu-se das suas crianças na escola, e quando ela foi procurá-las ela não as viu. Alguém lembrou-lhe que as suas crianças estavam a precisar de material para uma pesquisa, então ela foi encontrá-las na biblioteca a procurar o que elas queriam. Para agradecer a todos os que ajudaram-na, ela começou a falar, dizendo como ela estava contente do fundo do coração.
: Translation to English:
:: That woman with whom I met yesterday was worried because she forgot her children at school, and when she went to seek them she didn’t see them. Someone reminded her that her children were needing some material for a research, and so she found them at the library searching what they needed. To thank to everyone who helped her, she started speaking, telling how she was glad from the bottom of her heart.

In this text, several situations of decreolization / Portuguese intromission can be noted:
*''cú quêm'' / ''c’ quêm''{{spaced ndash}}Portuguese order of words ''com quem'';
*''encôntra'' / ''encontrá''{{spaced ndash}}Portuguese lexicon, in Creole it would be more commonly ''átcha'' / ''otchá'';
*''priocupáda''{{spaced ndash}}Portuguese lexicon, in Creole it would be more commonly ''fadigáda'';
*''púrqui'' / ''púrq’''{{spaced ndash}}Portuguese lexicon, in Creole it would be more commonly ''pamódi'' / ''pamód’'';
*''sês minínus'' / ''sês m’nín’s''{{spaced ndash}}Portuguese influence (plural marker on both words);
*''procurâ-’s'' / ''procurá-’s''{{spaced ndash}}Portuguese lexicon, in Creole it would be more commonly ''spiâ-’s'' / ''spiá-’s'';
*''olhâ-’s'' / ''olhá-’s''{{spaced ndash}}Portuguese phonetics (intromission of the phoneme {{IPA|/ʎ/}});
*''quí'' / ''qu’''{{spaced ndash}}Portuguese lexicon, the integrant conjunction in Creole is ''’mâ'';
*''sâ tâ pricisába'' / ''táva ta pr’cisá''{{spaced ndash}}Portuguese lexicon, in Creole it would be more commonly ''sâ tâ mestêba'' / ''táva tâ mestê'';
*''material'', ''pesquisa'', ''biblioteca''{{spaced ndash}}words pretty uncommon in a basilect; if they are Portuguese words used when speaking Creole they should be pronounced in Portuguese and written in italic or between quotation marks;
*''úqui'' / ''úq’''{{spaced ndash}}intromission of Portuguese ''o que'';
*''gradêci â'' / ''gradecê â''{{spaced ndash}}wrong preposition, the Portuguese preposition “''a''” does not exist in Creole;
*''fála''{{spaced ndash}}this form (from contemporary Portuguese ''falar'') is only used in São Vicente and Santo Antão, in the other islands the word is ''papiâ'' (from old Portuguese ''papear'');
*''cômu'' / ''côm’''{{spaced ndash}}intromission of Portuguese ''como'';
*''curaçãu''{{spaced ndash}}Portuguese phonetics (reduction of the phoneme {{IPA|/o/}} to {{IPA|/u/}} and Portuguese pronunciation {{IPA|/ɐ̃w/}} instead of Creole {{IPA|/õ/}});

As a consequence there is a continuum between [[basilect]]al and [[acrolect]]al varieties.

In spite of Creole not being officialized, there exists a governmental directive&lt;ref&gt;Resolução n.º 48/2005 (Boletim Oficial da República de Cabo Verde – 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; that puts forth the necessary conditions for the officialization of Creole. This [[Official language|officialization]] has not yet occurred, mostly because the language is not yet [[Standard language|standardized]], for several reasons:
* There is significant dialectal fragmentation. Speakers are reluctant to speak a variant that is not their own.
* Absence of rules to establish which is the right form (and also the right spelling) to be adopted for each word. For example, for the word corresponding to the Portuguese word ''algibeira'' (“pocket”), A. Fernandes&lt;ref&gt;Fernandes, A. N. Rodrigues (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; records the forms ''algibêra'', ''agibêra'', ''albigêra'', ''aljubêra'', ''alj’bêra'', ''gilbêra'', ''julbêra'', ''lijbêra''.
* Absence of rules to establish which are the lexical limits to be adopted. It is frequent for speakers of Creole, when writing, to join different grammatical classes.&lt;ref&gt;Pereira, D., «[http://caboverde.vozdipovo-online.com/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=38&amp;pop=1&amp;page=1&amp;Itemid=30 Pa Nu Skrebe Na Skola] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070918113801/http://caboverde.vozdipovo-online.com/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=38&amp;pop=1&amp;page=1&amp;Itemid=30 |date=18 September 2007 }}»&lt;/ref&gt; For ex.: ''pâm...'' instead of ''pâ m’...'' “for me to...”.
* Absence of rules to establish which are the grammatical structures to be adopted. It is not just about dialectal differences; even within a single variant there are fluctuations. For ex.: in the Santiago variant, when there are two sentences and one is subordinated to the other, there is a tense agreement in the verbs (''bú cría pâ m’ dába'' “you wanted me to give”{{spaced ndash}}both ''cría'' and ''dába'' are past tense), but some speakers do not practice it (''bú cría pâ m’ dâ''{{spaced ndash}}past then present{{spaced ndash}}or ''bú crê pâ m’ dába''{{spaced ndash}}present then past).
* The writing system ([[ALUPEC]]) has not been well accepted by all Creole users.
* The language levels (formal, informal, scientific, slang, etc.) are not well differentiated yet.

That is the reason why, each speaker when speaking (or writing) uses his/her own [[dialect]], his/her own [[sociolect]] and his/her own [[idiolect]].

To overcome these problems, some Creole advocates&lt;ref name="Veiga"&gt;Veiga, M. (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; propose the development of two standards: a North (Barlavento) standard, centered on the São Vicente variant, and a South (Sotavento) standard, centered on that of Santiago. If so, Creole would become a [[pluricentric language]]

There exists no complete translation of the Bible. However, the “Asosiason Kabuverdianu pa Traduson di Bíblia” was established with the goal of translating the entire Bible in Kabuverdianu-Sotaventu and Kabuverdianu-Barlaventu (see http://www.AKTB.org). They have translated approximately 40% of the [[New Testament]] in the Kabuverdianu-Sotaventu, and they have published Luke and Acts. The publication of Luke has won two awards in Cape Verde.  Sérgio Frusoni translated [[Bartolomeo Rossetti]]'s version of the [[Romanesco dialect|Romanesco Italian]] poem ''Er Vangelo Seconno Noantri'', which is a poem based on the [[Gospel#Canonical gospels|Four Gospels]]. Frusoni translated the poem in the São Vicente Creole, ''Vangêle contód d'nôs móda''.

== Writing system ==
{{Main|ALUPEC}}

The only writing system officially recognized by the authorities in Cape Verde is called [[ALUPEC]]. In spite of having been officially recognized by the government, the ALUPEC is neither officially nor mandatorily used, instead used only by enthusiasts.

In spite of being the only system officially recognized, the same law allows the use of alternative writing models, “as long as they are presented in a systematic and scientific way”. As not all users are familiarized with ALUPEC or the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]], in this article a slightly different system will be used to make it easier for the reader:
*The sound {{IPA|[s]}} will be represented in an etymological way (“'''s'''” when in Portuguese is “'''s'''”, “'''ss'''” when in Portuguese is “'''ss'''”, “'''c'''” when in Portuguese is “'''c'''”, “'''ç'''” when in Portuguese is “'''ç'''”) instead of ALUPEC always “'''s'''”.
*The sound {{IPA|[z]}} will be represented in an etymological way (“'''s'''” when in Portuguese is “'''s'''”, “'''z'''” when in Portuguese is “'''z'''”) instead of ALUPEC always “'''z'''”.
*The sound {{IPA|[tʃ]}} will be represented by “'''tch'''” instead of ALUPEC “'''tx'''”.
*The sound {{IPA|[ʃ]}} will be represented in an etymological way (“'''x'''” when in Portuguese is “'''x'''”, “'''ch'''” when in Portuguese is “'''ch'''”) instead of ALUPEC always “'''x'''”.
*The sound {{IPA|[ʒ]}} will be represented in an etymological way (“'''j'''” when in Portuguese is “'''j'''”, “'''g'''” when in Portuguese is “'''g'''”) instead of ALUPEC always “'''j'''”.
*The sound {{IPA|[k]}} will be represented in an etymological way (“'''c'''” when in Portuguese is “'''c'''”, “'''qu'''” when in Portuguese is “'''qu'''”) instead of ALUPEC always “'''k'''”.
*The sound {{IPA|[ɡ]}} will be represented in an etymological way (“'''g'''” when in Portuguese is “'''g'''”, “'''gu'''” when in Portuguese is “'''gu'''”) instead of ALUPEC always “'''g'''”.
*The nasality of the vowels will be represented by an “'''m'''” after the vowel, when this vowel is at the end of the word or before the letters “'''p'''” and “'''b'''”. In the other cases the nasality will be represented by the letter “'''n'''”.
*The words will always have a graphic accent. This will be an overwhelming use of accents, but it is the only way to effectively represent both the stressed syllable and vowel aperture.
*To show an elided vowel in certain variants an apostrophe '''’''' will be used.

== Vocabulary ==

The vocabulary of Cape Verdean Creole comes mainly from Portuguese. Although the several sources do not agree, the figures oscillate between 90 to 95% of words from Portuguese. The remaining comes from several languages from Western Africa ([[Mandinka language|Mandingo]], [[Wolof language|Wolof]], [[Fula language|Fulani]], [[Temne language|Temne]], [[Balanta language|Balanta]], [[Mandjak language|Mandjak]], etc.), and the vocabulary from other languages (English, French, [[Latin]]) is negligible.

== Phonology ==

Cape Verdean Creole's phonological system comes mainly from 15th-through-17th-century Portuguese. In terms of conservative features, Creole has kept the affricate consonants {{IPA|/dʒ/}} and {{IPA|/tʃ/}} (written “j” (in the beginning of words) and “ch”, in old Portuguese) which are not in use in today’s Portuguese, and the pre-tonic vowels were not reduced as in today’s European Portuguese. In terms of innovative features, the phoneme {{IPA|/ʎ/}} (written “lh” in Portuguese) has evolved to {{IPA|/dʒ/}} and the vowels have undergone several phonetic phenomena.

===Vowels===
There are eight oral vowels and their corresponding nasal counterparts, making a total of sixteen vowels:

====First-person singular====
The personal pronoun that represents the subject form of the first person singular has a variable pronunciation according to the islands.

This pronoun comes from the object form of the first person singular in Portuguese ''mim'', and it is phonetically reduced to the sound {{IPA|[m]}}.

This pronunciation is nowadays found in the Barlavento variants. In the Sotavento variants that consonant {{IPA|[m]}} was reduced to a simple nasality {{IPA|[ƞ]}}. For example: ''m’ andâ'' {{IPA|[ƞ ɐ̃ˈdɐ]}} ('I have walked'), ''m’ stâ tâ sintí'' {{IPA|[ƞ stɐ tɐ sĩˈti]}} ('I am feeling'), ''m’ labába'' {{IPA|[ƞ lɐˈbabɐ]}} ('I had washed'). Before plosive or affricate consonants this nasality becomes [[homorganic]] nasal of the following consonant. For ex.: ''m’ bêm'' {{IPA|[m bẽ]}} ('I came'), ''m’ têm'' {{IPA|[n tẽ]}} ('I have'), ''m’ tchigâ'' {{IPA|[ɲ tʃiˈɡɐ]}} ('I arrived'), ''m’ crê'' {{IPA|[ŋ kɾe]}} ('I want').

Speakers who are strongly influenced by the Portuguese language tend to pronounce this pronoun as a '''nasal vowel''' ''úm'' {{IPA|[ũ]}} instead of ''m’'' {{IPA|[m]}}.

Before some forms of the verb ''sêr'' this pronoun takes back its full form '''''mí''''' {{IPA|[mi]}}, in whatever variant: ''mí ê'' {{IPA|[mi e]}} (‘I am’), ''mí éra'' {{IPA|[mi ˈɛɾɐ]}} (‘I was’).

In this article, this pronoun is conventionally written ''m’'', no matter the variant.

== Grammar ==

Even though over 90% of Cape Verdean Creole words are derived from Portuguese, the grammar is very different, which makes it extremely difficult for an untrained Portuguese native speaker even to understand a basic conversation. On the other hand, the grammar shows a lot of similarities with other creoles, Portuguese-based or not (check [[syntactic similarities of creoles]]).

===Sentence structure===
The basic sentence structure in Creole is Subject{{spaced ndash}}Verb{{spaced ndash}}Object. Ex.:
*''Êl tâ cumê pêxi.'' “He eats fish.”

When there are two objects, the indirect object comes first while the direct object comes after, and the sentence structure becomes Subject{{spaced ndash}}Verb{{spaced ndash}}Indirect Object{{spaced ndash}}Direct Object. Ex.:
*''Êl tâ dâ pêxi cumída.'' “He gives food to the fish.”

A feature that makes Cape Verdean Creole closer to other creoles is the possibility of [[double negation]] (ex.: ''Náda m’ câ atchâ.'' liter. “Nothing I didn’t find.”), or sometimes even triple negation (ex.: ''Núnca ninguêm câ tâ bába lâ.'' liter. “Never nobody didn’t go there.”). Although double negation is common in Portuguese (e.g. "Nunca ninguém foi lá"), triple negation is a little bit uncommon.

===Nouns===

====Gender inflection====
Only the animated nouns (human beings and animals) have gender inflection. Ex.:
*''inglês'' / ''inglésa'' “Englishman / Englishwoman”
*''pôrcu'' / ''pórca'' “pig (male) / pig (female)”

In some cases the distinction between sexes is made putting the adjectives ''mátchu'' “male” and ''fémia'' “female” after the nouns. Ex.:
*''fídju-mátchu'' / ''fídju-fémia'' “son / daughter”
*''catchôrr’-mátchu'' / ''catchôrr’-fémia'' “dog (male) / dog (female)”

====Number inflection====
The nouns in Creole have number inflection (plural marks) only when they are well determined or known in the context. Ex.:
* ''Minínus dí Bía ê bêm comportádu.'' (“The children of Bia are well behaved.”)

When the noun refers to something in general that noun does not have number inflection. Ex.:
* ''Minínu devê ruspetâ alguêm grándi.'' (“Children must respect grown up people.”)

If in a sentence there are several grammatical categories, only the first bears the plural marker. Ex.:
* ''minínu'''s''''' (“boys”)
* ''nhâ'''s''' minína'' (“my girls”)
* ''minínu'''s''' bunítu'' (“beautiful boys”)
* ''nhâ'''s''' dôs minína buníta í simpática'' (“my two kind and beautiful girls”)

===Personal pronouns===
According to their function, the pronouns can be '''subject''' pronouns or '''object''' pronouns. Furthermore, in each of these functions, according to the position within the sentence the pronouns can be '''unstressed''' or '''stressed'''.

The '''unstressed''' subject pronouns generally bear the function of the subject and the come before the verb. Ex.:
*'''''Nú''' crê.'' “'''We''' want.”

The '''stressed''' subject pronouns bear the function of some kind of vocative and usually are separated from the verb ([[disjunctive pronoun]]s). Ex.:
*'''''Mí''', m’ stâ lí, í '''bô''', bú stâ lâ.'' “'''Me''', I am here, and '''you''', you are there.”

The object pronouns, as the name shows, bear the function of the object (direct or indirect). The '''unstressed''' object pronouns are used with the present-tense forms of verbs. Ex.:
*''M’ odjá-'''’l'''.'' “I have seen '''it'''.”
*''M’ tâ bejá-'''bu'''.'' “I kiss '''you'''.”

The '''stressed''' object pronouns are used with the past-tense forms of verbs, when they are the second pronoun in a series of two pronouns, and after prepositions ([[prepositional pronoun]]s). Ex.:
*''Ês tâ odjába-'''êl'''.'' “They saw '''it'''.”
*''Bú dâ-m’-'''êl'''.'' “You gave '''it''' to me.”
*''M’ stâ fártu dí '''bô'''!'' “I’m fed up of '''you'''!”

When there are two object pronouns, the indirect pronoun comes first while the direct pronoun comes after, and the sentence structure becomes Subject{{spaced ndash}}Verb{{spaced ndash}}Indirect Pronoun{{spaced ndash}}Direct Pronoun.

There are no reflexive pronouns. To indicate reflexivity, Creole uses the expression ''cabéça'' ("head") after the possessive determiner. Ex.:
*''Ês mordê sês cabéça.'' “They have bitten themselves.”

There are no reciprocal pronouns. To indicate reciprocity, Creole uses the expression ''cumpanhêru'' ("companion"). Ex.:
*''Ês mordê cumpanhêru.'' “They have bitten each other.”

===Verbs===
The verbs have only minimal inflection (two forms). They have the same form for all the persons, and the notions of tense, mood and aspect are expressed through the presence (or absence) of certain morphemes (called “'''verbal actualizers'''” by Veiga&lt;ref name="Veiga" /&gt;), as in the majority of creoles.

The verbs are generally reduced to two base forms, one for the '''present''', another for the '''past'''. The form for the '''present''' is the same to the form for the '''infinitive''' (exception: ''sêr'' “to be”), that in turn comes, in the majority of the verbs, from the infinitive in Portuguese but without the final ''r''. Ex.: ''cantâ'' {{IPA|/kɐ̃ˈtɐ/}} (from Portuguese ''cantar''), ''mexê'' {{IPA|/meˈʃe/}} (from Portuguese ''mexer''), ''partí'' {{IPA|/pɐɾˈti/}} (from Portuguese ''partir''), ''compô'' {{IPA|/kõˈpo/}} (from Portuguese ''compor''), ''*lumbú'' {{IPA|/lũˈbu/}} (from Portuguese ''lombo''). The form for the '''past''' is formed from the infinitive to which is joined the particle for the past ''~ba''. Ex.: ''cantába'' {{IPA|/kɐ̃ˈtabɐ/}}, ''mexêba'' {{IPA|/meˈʃebɐ/}}, ''partíba'' {{IPA|/pɐɾˈtibɐ/}}, ''compôba'' {{IPA|/kõˈpobɐ/}}, ''*lumbúba'' {{IPA|/lũˈbubɐ/}} (in the Barlavento variants, the particle for the past ''~va'' (or ''~ba'') is joined to the '''imperfective actualizer''', and not to the verb). It is noteworthy that the Upper Guinea creoles (Cape Verdean Creole and [[Guinea-Bissau Creole]]) put the past tense marker after the verbs, and not before like the majority of creoles (check [[syntactic similarities of creoles]]).

It is important to mention that in the Santiago variant, the stress goes back to before the last syllable in the present tense forms of the verbs. Therefore, we have: ''cánta'' {{IPA|/ˈkãtɐ/}} instead of ''cantâ'' {{IPA|/kɐ̃ˈtɐ/}}, ''mêxe'' {{IPA|/ˈmeʃe/}} or ''mêxi'' {{IPA|/ˈmeʃi/}} instead of ''mexê'' {{IPA|/meˈʃe/}}, ''pârti'' {{IPA|/ˈpɐɾti/}} instead of ''partí'' {{IPA|/pɐɾˈti/}}, ''cômpo'' {{IPA|/ˈkõpo/}} or ''cômpu'' {{IPA|/ˈkõpu/}} instead of ''compô'' {{IPA|/kõˈpo/}}, ''búmbu'' {{IPA|/ˈbũbu/}} instead of ''bumbú'' {{IPA|/bũˈbu/}}. In the pronominal forms, however, the stress remains on the last syllable: ''cantâ-m’'' {{IPA|/kɐ̃ˈtɐ̃/}}, ''mexê-bu'' {{IPA|/meˈʃebu/}}, ''partí-’l'' {{IPA|/pɐɾˈtil/}}, ''compô-nu'' {{IPA|/kõˈponu/}}, ''bumbú-’s'' {{IPA|/bũˈbuz/}}.

====Regular verbs====
As was said before, the regular verbs are reduced to a form for the present tense and a form for the past tense, and the notions of mood and aspect are expressed through verbal actualizers.

The following table shows a paradigm of the indicative mood with the verb ''dâ'' “to give” in the first-person singular:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! &amp;nbsp; ||Present Tense ||Past Tense
|-
|[[Perfective aspect]] ||''M’ dâ'' ||''M’ dába''
|-
|[[Imperfective aspect]] ||''M’ tâ dâ'' ||''M’ tâ dába''
|-
|[[Progressive aspect]] ||''M’ stâ tâ dâ'' ||''M’ stába tâ da''
|}

The '''perfective''' aspect of the '''present''' is used when the speech refers to present situations, but that are finished, that are complete. Ex.:
:''M’ dâ.'' {{IPA|[m dɐ]}} “I gave. / I have given.”
:It corresponds roughly, according to context, to the '''past tense''' or '''present perfect''' in English.

The '''imperfective''' aspect of the '''present''' is used when the speech refers to present situations, but that are not finished yet, that are incomplete. Ex.:
:''M’ tâ dâ.'' {{IPA|[m tɐ dɐ]}} “I give.”
:It corresponds roughly to the '''present tense''' in English.

The '''progressive''' aspect of the '''present''' is used when the speech refers to present situations that are happening in a continuous, uninterrupted way. Ex.:
:''M’ stâ tâ dâ.'' {{IPA|[m stɐ tɐ dɐ]}} “I am giving.”
:It corresponds roughly to the '''present continuous tense''' in English.
::&lt;small&gt;Note: Actually, this model doesn’t exist anymore. It has evolved to ''M’ stâ dâ.'' {{IPA|[n stɐ dɐ]}} in Brava Fogo and Maio, to ''M’ sâ tâ dâ.'' {{IPA|[n sɐ tɐ dɐ]}} in Santiago, to ''M’ tâ tâ dâ.'' {{IPA|[m tɐ tɐ dɐ]}} in Boa Vista, Sal and São Nicolau and to ''M’ ti tâ dá.'' {{IPA|[m ti tɐ da]}} in São Vicente and Santo Antão.&lt;/small&gt;

There is no specific form for the future. The '''future of the present''' may be expressed through three resources:
#Using the imperfective of the present but bearing the function of the future. Ex.: ''M’ tâ dâ manhã.'' {{IPA|[m tɐ dɐ mɐˈɲɐ̃]}} liter. “I give tomorrow.”
#Using the auxiliary verb “to go”. Ex.: ''M’ tâ bái dâ.'' {{IPA|[m tɐ baj dɐ]}} liter. “I go to give.”
#Using a periphrasis showing an eventuality. Ex.: ''M’ ál dâ. '' {{IPA|[m al dɐ]}} “I will give.”
:It corresponds roughly to the '''future tense''' in English.

The '''perfective''' aspect of the '''past''' is used when the speech refers to past situations that were finished, or complete. Ex.:
:''M’ dába.'' {{IPA|[m ˈdabɐ]}} “I had given.”
:It corresponds roughly to the '''past perfect''' in English.
::&lt;small&gt;Note: This form does not exist in the Barlavento variants.&lt;/small&gt;

The '''imperfective''' aspect of the '''past''' is used when the speech refers to past situations that were not finished yet, or incomplete. Ex.:
:''M’ tâ dába.'' {{IPA|[m tɐ ˈdabɐ]}} “I gave. / I used to give.”
:It corresponds roughly to the '''past tense''' in English.
::&lt;small&gt;Note: In the Barlavento variants the particle for the past is joined to the imperfective actualizer and not to the verb: ''M’ táva dâ.'' {{IPA|[m ˈtavɐ dɐ]}}. In São Nicolau, along with ''M’ táva dâ'' also subsists the older form ''M’ tá dába'' {{IPA|[m ta ˈdabɐ]}}.&lt;/small&gt;

The '''progressive''' aspect of the '''past''' is used when the speech refers to past situations that were happening in a continuous and uninterrupted way. Ex.:
:''M’ stába tâ dâ.'' {{IPA|[m ˈstabɐ tɐ dɐ]}} “I was giving.”
:It corresponds roughly to the '''past continuous tense''' in English.
::&lt;small&gt;Note: Actually, this model only exists in Brava and Fogo. It has evolved to ''M’ sâ tâ dába.'' {{IPA|[n sɐ tɐ ˈdabɐ]}} in Santiago and Maio and to ''M’ táva tâ dâ.'' {{IPA|[m ˈtavɐ tɐ dɐ]}} in Boa Vista, Sal, São Nicolau, São Vicente and Santo Antão.&lt;/small&gt;

There is no specific form for the future. The '''future of the past''' may be expressed through three resources:
#Using the imperfective of the past but bearing the function of the future. Ex.: ''M’ tâ dába manhã.'' {{IPA|[m tɐ ˈdabɐ mɐˈɲɐ̃]}} liter. “I gave tomorrow.”
#Using the auxiliary verb “to go”. Ex.: ''M’ tâ bába dâ.'' {{IPA|[m tɐ ˈbabɐ dɐ]}} liter. “I went to give.”
#Using a periphrasis showing an eventuality. Ex.: ''M’ ál dába. '' [m al {{IPA|ˈdabɐ]}} “I would give.”
:It corresponds roughly to the '''conditional''' in English.

The remaining moods{{spaced ndash}}subjunctive, conditional (not the same as “conditional” in English), eventual{{spaced ndash}}do not have different aspects, only present and past tense, except the injunctive (imperative) mood which has only the present tense.

====Irregular verbs====
There is a group of verbs that do not follow the paradigmatic model presented above. They are the '''auxiliary verbs''' ''sêr'' {{IPA|/seɾ/}} “to be”, ''stâ'' {{IPA|/stɐ/}} “to be”, ''têm'' {{IPA|/tẽ/}} “to have” and ''tenê'' {{IPA|/teˈne/}} “to have”, and the '''modal verbs''' ''crê'' {{IPA|/kɾe/}} “to want”, ''sabê'' {{IPA|/sɐˈbe/}} “to know”, ''podê'' {{IPA|/poˈde/}} “can”, ''devê'' {{IPA|/deˈve/}} “must” and ''mestê'' {{IPA|/mesˈte/}} “to need”.
: &lt;small&gt;Note.: The designation “auxiliary verbs” is not consensual.&lt;/small&gt;

There exist two registers for these verbs.

In the ''first register'' (in older speakers, in rural areas speakers or in speakers with little exposure to Portuguese) there are only two forms for the verbs: one for the present (''ê'' {{IPA|/e/}}, ''stâ'' {{IPA|/stɐ/}}, ''têm'' {{IPA|/tẽ/}}, ''tenê'' {{IPA|/teˈne/}}, ''crê'' {{IPA|/kɾe/}}, ''sabê'' {{IPA|/sɐˈbe/}}, ''podê'' {{IPA|/poˈde/}}, ''devê'' {{IPA|/deˈve/}}, ''mestê'' {{IPA|/mesˈte/}}) and one for the past (''éra'' {{IPA|/ˈɛɾɐ/}}, ''stába'' {{IPA|/stabɐ/}}, ''têmba'' /tẽ{{IPA|bɐ/}}, ''tenêba'' {{IPA|/teˈnebɐ/}}, ''crêba'' {{IPA|/kɾebɐ/}}, ''sabêba'' {{IPA|/sɐˈbebɐ/}}, ''podêba'' {{IPA|/poˈdebɐ/}}, ''devêba'' {{IPA|/deˈvebɐ/}}, ''mestêba'' {{IPA|/mesˈtebɐ/}}). However, on the contrary of regular verbs, when the base form is used alone it represents the '''imperfective aspect''' and not the '''perfective aspect'''. Therefore, ''mí ê'', ''m’ têm'', ''m’ crê'', ''m’ sabê'' mean “I am, I have, I want, I know”, and not “I’ve been, I’ve had, I’ve wanted, I’ve known”, as it would be expected. Parallelly, ''mí éra'', ''m’ têmba'', ''m’ crêba'', ''m’ sabêba'' mean “I was, I had, I wanted, I knew”, and not “I had been, I had had, I had wanted, I had known”, as would be expected.

In the ''second register'' (among younger speakers, in urban areas or in speakers with more exposure to Portuguese) the system has been enriched with other forms influenced by Portuguese. Therefore, we have:
*''ê'' {{IPA|/e/}}, ''stâ'' {{IPA|/stɐ/}}, ''têm'' {{IPA|/tẽ/}}, ''crê'' {{IPA|/kɾe/}}, ''sabê'' {{IPA|/sɐˈbe/}}, ''podê'' {{IPA|/poˈde/}}, ''devê'' {{IPA|/deˈve/}}, ''mestê'' {{IPA|/mesˈte/}} for the imperfective of the present;
*''fôi'' {{IPA|/foj/}}, ''stêvi'' {{IPA|/ˈst}}evi/, ''têvi'' {{IPA|/ˈte}}vi/, ''crís'' {{IPA|/kɾis/}}, ''sôbi'' {{IPA|/ˈso}}bi/, ''púdi'' {{IPA|/ˈpu}}di/ for the perfective of the present;
*''éra'' {{IPA|/ˈɛɾɐ/}}, ''stába'' {{IPA|/ˈstabɐ/}}, ''tínha'' {{IPA|/ˈtiɲɐ/}}, ''cría'' {{IPA|/ˈkɾiɐ/}}, ''sabía'' {{IPA|/sɐˈbiɐ/}}, ''pudía'' {{IPA|/puˈdiɐ/}}, ''divía'' {{IPA|/diˈviɐ/}}, ''mistía'' {{IPA|/misˈtiɐ/}} for the imperfective of the past;
*''sêrba'' {{IPA|/ˈseɾbɐ/}}, ''stába'' {{IPA|/ˈstabɐ/}}, ''têmba'' {{IPA|/ˈt}}ẽ{{IPA|bɐ/}}, ''crêba'' {{IPA|/ˈkɾebɐ/}}, ''sabêba'' {{IPA|/sɐˈbebɐ/}}, ''podêba'' {{IPA|/poˈdebɐ/}}, ''devêba'' {{IPA|/deˈvebɐ/}}, ''mestêba'' {{IPA|/mesˈtebɐ/}} for the perfective of the past;
:&lt;small&gt;Note.: Some authors&lt;ref&gt;Quint, N.{{spaced ndash}}2000&lt;/ref&gt; call these verbs “stative verbs” and to these verbs they add others: ''gostâ'', ''conxê'', ''merecê'', ''morâ'', ''tchomâ'', ''valê''. However that designation is contested: not all those verbs are in fact stative; not all those verbs are irregular (for ex. ''morâ''); some of those verbs are regular in some variants (''m’ tâ gostâ''{{spaced ndash}}imperfective of the present with ''tâ''), and irregulars in other variants (''m’ gostâ''{{spaced ndash}}imperfective of the present but '''without''' ''tâ'').&lt;/small&gt;

There is a parallelism between the pair of the verbs ''sêr'' / ''stâ'' “to be” and the pair of the verbs ''têm'' / ''tenê'' “to have”.
*The verb ''sêr'' is a copulative verb that expresses a permanent quality. Ex.:
::''Mí ê úm ómi.'' {{IPA|/mi e ũ ˈɔmi/}} “I am (I’ve always been and I will always be) a man.”
*The verb ''stâ'' is a copulative verb that expresses a temporary state. Ex.:
::''Êl stâ trísti.'' {{IPA|/el stɐ ˈtɾisti/}} “He is (in this precise moment) sad.”
*The verb ''têm'' is a possessive verb that expresses a permanent quality. Ex.:
::''M’ têm péli scúru.'' {{IPA|/m tẽ ˈpɛli ˈskuɾu/}} “I have (I had and I will always have) dark skin.”
*The verb ''tenê'' is a possessive verb that expresses a temporary possession. Ex.:
::''M’ tenê úm canéta nâ bôlsu.'' {{IPA|/m teˈne ũ kɐˈnɛtɐ nɐ ˈbolsu/}} “I have (in this precise moment) a pen in the pocket.”

|-

|}

:&lt;small&gt;Note.: The verbs ''stâ'' and ''tenê'' do not have the progressive aspect: forms like ''*m’ stâ tâ stâ'' or ''*m’ stâ tâ tenê'' do not exist. The verb ''tenê'' does not exist in the Barlavento variants. In São Vicente and Santo Antão the verb ''stâ'' has the form ''stód’'' for the infinitive, ''tâ'' for the imperfective of the present, ''tív’'' for the perfective of the present, and ''táva'' for the imperfective of the past.&lt;/small&gt;

====Passive====
Cape Verdean Creole has two '''voices'''. The '''active''' voice is used when the subject is explicit. The '''passive''' voice is used when the subject is indeterminate or unknown. There is also two forms for the passive. The form for the present is made with the infinitive to which is joined the particle ''~du''. The form for the past is made with the infinitive to which is joined the particle ''~da''. Ex.:
* ''Tâ papiádu inglês nâ Mérca.'' {{IPA|/tɐ pɐpiˈadu}} {{IPA|ĩˈɡlez}} {{IPA|nɐ ˈmɛɾkɐ/}} “English is spoken in America.”
* ''M’ inxinádu tâ andâ.'' {{IPA|/m ĩʃiˈnadu tɐ ɐ̃ˈdɐ/}} “I was taught to walk.”
* ''Úm vêz, tâ cumêda tchêu mídju.'' {{IPA|/ũ vez tɐ kuˈmedɐ tʃew ˈmidʒu/}} “Once, one used to eat a lot of corn.”
:&lt;small&gt;Note.: In the Barlavento variants the form for the past does not exist.&lt;/small&gt;

====Negative====
To negate a verb, the negative adverb ''câ'' {{IPA|/kɐ/}} is used after the subject and before any verbal actualizer. Ex.:
*''Nú câ tâ bebê.'' {{IPA|/nu kɐ tɐ beˈbe/}} “We don’t drink.”
*''Êl câ tâ odjába.'' {{IPA|/el kɐ tɐ oˈdʒabɐ/}} “He didn’t see.”
*''Bú câ bái.'' {{IPA|/bu kɐ baj/}} “You haven’t gone.”

In the Santo Antão variant, the negative adverb is ''n’'' {{IPA|/n/}}. Ex.:
*''Nô n’ dâ bibê.'' {{IPA|/no n dɐ biˈbe/}} “We don’t drink.”
*''Êl n’ dáva o’á.'' {{IPA|/el n davɐ oˈa/}} “He didn’t see.”
*''Bô n’ bé.'' {{IPA|/bo n bɛ/}} “You haven’t gone.”

In imperative sentences the negative adverb ''câ'' {{IPA|/kɐ/}} is always in the beginning. Ex.:
*''Câ bú bái!'' {{IPA|/kɐ bu baj/}} “Don’t go!” (you{{spaced ndash}}singular)
*''Câ nhôs fazê!'' {{IPA|/kɐ ɲoz fɐˈze/}} (Sotavento), ''Câ b’sôt’ fazê!'' {{IPA|/kɐ bzot fɐˈze/}} (Barlavento) “Don’t do!” (you-plural)

And in the Santo Antão variant:
*''N’ bô bé!'' /n bo {{IPA|bɛ/}} “Don’t go!” (you{{spaced ndash}}singular)
*''N’ b’sôt’ fezê!'' {{IPA|/n bzot feˈze/}} “Don’t do!” (you{{spaced ndash}}plural)

===Adjectives===
Adjectives in Creole almost always come after the noun. Only the animated nouns (human beings and animals) demand gender inflection in their adjectives. Ex.:
*''ómi fêiu'' / ''mudjêr fêia'' “ugly man / ugly woman”
*''bódi prêtu'' / ''cábra préta'' “black buck / black goat”

The adjectives for unanimated nouns have the same form as the masculine adjectives. Ex.:
*''bistídu bráncu'' “white dress”
*''camísa bráncu'' “white shirt”

In general the plural marker does not appear on adjectives since it comes in a preceding grammatical category.

===Determiners===
In Creole there are no definite articles. If it is absolutely necessary to determine the noun, the [[demonstrative]] determiners are used instead.

For the indefinite articles there are two forms, one for the singular, another for the plural:
*''úm…'' {{IPA|/ũ/}} “a, an (singular)”, ''úns…'' {{IPA|/ũz/}} “a, an (plural)”

The possessive determiners have number inflexion, but the plural refers to the objects possessed, and not to the owners. Ex.:
*''nhâ cárru'' “my car”
*''nhâs cárru'' “my cars”
*''nôs cárru'' can be either “our car” or “our cars”

The demonstrative determiners have only two degrees of proximity: close to the speaker (''êss'' “this, these”) and away from the speaker (''quêl'' “that”, ''quês'' “those”).
:&lt;small&gt;Note.: Only the São Vicente and Santo Antão Creoles make a phonetic distinction between the singular ''êss'' {{IPA|/es/}} (“this”) and the plural ''ês'' {{IPA|/eʒ/}} (“these”).&lt;/small&gt;

===Designatives===
Creole possesses a special grammatical category for presenting or announcing something. It appears in two forms, one to present something near, (''alí…'' {{IPA|/ɐˈli/}}) and another to present something far (''alâ…'' {{IPA|/ɐˈlɐ/}}). Ex.:
*''Alí nhâ fídju.'' “Here is my son.”
*''Alá-’l tâ bái.'' “There he goes.”

In spite of Cape Verde's small size, each island has developed its own way of speaking Creole. Each of these nine ways (there are 10 islands, one of which is uninhabited) is justifiably a different [[dialect]], but the scholars in Cape Verde usually call them “variants”. These variants can be classified into two branches: in the South there are the Sotavento Creoles, which comprise the [[Brava, Cape Verde|Brava]], [[Fogo, Cape Verde|Fogo]], [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago]] and [[Maio, Cape Verde|Maio]] variants; in the North there are the Barlavento Creoles, which comprise the [[Boa Vista, Cape Verde|Boa Vista]], [[Sal, Cape Verde|Sal]], [[São Nicolau, Cape Verde|São Nicolau]], [[São Vicente, Cape Verde|São Vicente]] and [[Santo Antão, Cape Verde|Santo Antão]] variants.

Since some [[Word|lexical]] forms of Cape Verdean Creole can be different according to each variant, the words and the sentences in this article will be presented in compromise model, a kind of “middle Creole”, in order to ease the understanding and in order not to favor any variant. Whenever it will be necessary the [[Phoneme#Notation|phonemic transcription]] (or sometimes the [[phonetic transcription]]) will be shown immediately after the word.

For the writing system, check the section [[Cape Verdean Creole#Writing system|Writing system]].

From a linguistic point of view, the most important variants are the Fogo, Santiago, São Nicolau and Santo Antão ones, and any deep study of Creole should approach at least these four. They are the only islands that have received slaves directly from the African continent, that possess the most conservative linguistic features, and that are the most distinct from each other.

From a social point of view, the most important variants are the Santiago and São Vicente ones, and any light study of Creole should approach at least these two. They are the variants of the two bigger cities ([[Praia]] and [[Mindelo]]), the variants with the greatest number of speakers, and the variants with a [[glottophagy|glottophagist]] tendency over the neighboring ones.

These variants have significant literature:
* Brava: Eugénio Tavares
* Fogo: [[Elsie Clews Parsons]]
* Santiago: Carlos Barbosa, Tomé Varela da Silva, Daniel Spínola
* São Vicente: Sérgio Frusoni, Ovídio Martins
* Santo Antão: Luís Romano Madeira de Melo

[[File:Sitzungszimmer SVP.jpg|thumb|A meeting room, in the [[Federal Palace of Switzerland]] in [[Bern]].]]

A '''conference hall''', '''conference room''', or '''meeting room''' is a [[room]] provided for singular events such as [[business conference]]s and [[meetings]]. It is commonly found at large [[hotel]]s and [[convention center]]s though many other establishments, including even hospitals,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1080217/jsp/nation/story_8913102.jsp "Rahul who? Challenge on home turf"], TAPAS CHAKRABORTY,  [[The Telegraph (Kolkata)|The Telegraph]], 16 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; have one.  Sometimes other rooms are modified for large conferences such as [[arena]]s or [[concert hall]]s. [[Aircraft]] have been fitted out with conference rooms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/sunday/story/273686.html "Air Force One INDIA"], [[The Indian Express]], Manu Pubby, February 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Conference rooms can be windowless for security purposes. An example of one such room is in the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]], known as the ''Tank''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=29671 "How Bush Decided on the Surge"], Fred Barnes, [[FrontPage Magazine]], January 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, the facility provides [[furniture]], [[overhead projector]]s, [[stage lighting]], and a [[sound reinforcement system|sound system]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conferences-uk.org.uk/conference_venues_uk.asp?venue=Albert%20Hall%20Conference%20Centre "Albert Hall Conference Centre"], Conferences-UK.org.uk, retrieved 17 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Smoking]] is normally [[smoking ban|prohibited]] in conference halls even when other parts of buildings permit smoking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.richmond.com/news/article_bbbf5e7f-73bf-5aae-80cc-13a59a3ce0d5.html "Bills to ban public smoking defeated"], [[Richmond Times-Dispatch|OLYMPIA MEOLA TIMES]], February 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the term 'conference hall' is used [[synonym]]ously with '[[conference center]]' as, for example, in '[[Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall]]'.

Some meeting rooms come equipped with booking management software, depending on the needs of the company that owns them.

Typically a medium to large office or post-secondary educational facility has smaller meeting rooms often called a conference room or a huddle room.

==Possible Setups==
{{Expand section|date=October 2017}}

Depending on the purpose of the meeting, [https://www.bird-office.com/en/place-rent/event/conference-room conference rooms] may be set up in various styles. Sometimes the furniture may even be moved easily before a meeting to accommodate the particular needs of each meeting. Commonly used styles include&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Conference &amp; Event Services|title=Meeting Room Set-ups and Styles|url=https://www.cmu.edu/conferences/facilities/meeting/uc/room-styles.html|website=Carnegie Mellon University|accessdate=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

The '''Corsican Assembly''' ({{lang-co|Assemblea di Corsica}}; {{lang-fr|L'Assemblée de Corse}}) is the [[unicameral]] legislative body of the [[territorial collectivity]] of [[Corsica]]. It has its seat at the {{lang|fr|Grand Hôtel d'Ajaccio et Continental}}, in the Corsican capital of [[Ajaccio]]. After the [[Corsican territorial election, 2017|2017 territorial elections]], the assembly will be expanded from 51 to 63 seats, with the executive council expanding from 9 to 11 members (including the president).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Morgane Rubetti|title=Corse : cinq questions pour comprendre les élections territoriales|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/2017/12/01/01002-20171201ARTFIG00034-corse-cinq-questions-pour-comprendre-les-elections-territoriales.php|newspaper=Le Figaro|date=1 December 2017|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Before 1975, Corsica was a ''{{lang|fr|[[department (country subdivision)|département]]}}'' of the [[regions of France|French region]] of {{lang|fr|[[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]]}}.

On 2 March 1982, a law was passed that gave Corsica the status of [[territorial collectivity]] (''{{lang|fr|collectivité territoriale}}''), abolishing the Corsican Regional Council which had existed before. Unlike the regional councils, the Corsican Assembly has [[executive (government)|executive]] powers over the island.

In 1992, three institutions were formed in the territorial collectivity of Corsica:
* The [[Executive Council of Corsica]], which exercises the type of executive functions held in other French regions by the Presidents of the Regional Councils. It ensures the stability and consistency needed to manage the affairs of the territory;
* The Corsican Assembly, a deliberative, [[unicameralism|unicameral]] [[legislature|legislative body]] with greater powers than the regional councils on the mainland;
* The [[Economic, Social and Cultural Council of Corsica]], an advisory body.

==Terminology==
Members of the Corsican Assembly were first called "territorial councillors" in reference to Corsica's status as a ''{{lang|fr|collectivité territoriale}}''. Members are now called "Councillors of the Corsican Assembly", or in unofficial and everyday speech, just "Councillors".

==Powers==
* Economic development
* Taxation
* Energy
* Environment
* Housing
* Education and training
* Language
* Transport
* Forestry and agriculture
* Culture
* Tourism
* Sports &amp; youth

==Composition==
There are 63 members of the Assembly, elected for a six-year term via a [[closed list|closed]] [[Party-list proportional representation|party list]] and [[two-round system|two rounds]] of voting. To pass beyond the first round, a candidate requires an [[absolute majority]], whereas in the second round a [[plurality (voting)|plurality]] is sufficient.

The list that wins in the first or second round automatically obtains three seats as a "premium to the majority". The other seats are distributed based on [[proportional representation]].

At the first meeting of Assembly Councillors after an election, the councillors elect an Assembly President in a plurality ballot. This is also a two round contest, with an absolute majority required to proceed to the second round. At the same time as the election of the President, the Assembly also elects the ten members that will make up the President's Committee (''{{lang|fr|bureau}}'').

In contrast to the executives of the regional councils, Assembly Councillors may not also be members of the Corsican Executive Council. Election to the executive requires resignation from the Assembly.

This article is about the [[demographics|demographic]] features of the [[population]] of the [[Marshall Islands]], including [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

The people of the [[Marshall Islands]] are of [[Micronesia]]n origin, which is traced to a combination of peoples who emigrated from [[Southeast Asia]] in the remote past. The matrilineal Marshallese culture revolves around a complex system of clans and lineages tied to land ownership.

Virtually all Marshallese are [[Christianity|Christian]], most of them [[Protestantism|Protestant]] (see [[Religion in the Marshall Islands]]). Other Christian denominations include [[Roman Catholicism]], the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), [[Salvation Army]], and [[Jehovah's Witness]]. There is also a small presence of the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]] and the  [[Bahá'í Faith]].

Both [[Marshallese language|Marshallese]] and [[English language|English]] are official languages. Marshallese is spoken by most of the urban population. Both the [[Nitijela]] (parliament) and national radio use Marshallese.

The [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] system provides [[education]] through grade 12, although admission to [[secondary school]] is selective. The elementary program employs a bilingual/bicultural curriculum. English is introduced in the first grade. There is two post-secondary institutions in the Marshall Islands—the [[College of the Marshall Islands]] and the [[University of the South Pacific]].

'''Disk Detective''' is the first [[NASA]] led and funded collaboration project with [[Zooniverse (citizen science project)|Zooniverse]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects&lt;/ref&gt; It is NASA’s largest [[crowdsourcing]] [[citizen science]] project &lt;ref&gt;http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-032 NASA-Sponsored 'Disk Detective' Lets Public Search for New Planetary Nurseries&lt;/ref&gt; aiming at engaging the general public in search of stars, which are surrounded by dust-rich [[circumstellar disks]], where planets usually dwell and are formed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scilogs.com/marketing_for_scientists/launching-disk-detective-a-new-citizen-science-website/ Launching Disk Detective: A New Citizen Science Website › Marketing For Scientists&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Second Open Government National Action Plan|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/12/06/united-states-releases-its-second-open-government-national-action-plan|publisher=The White House Blog|author=Sinai Nick and Smith Gayle|accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal investigator is [[Marc Kuchner]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.diskdetective.org/#/team Disk Detective: Team]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==
Disk Detective was launched in January 2014, and is expected to continue till 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Disk Detective|url=http://www.nasa.gov/content/disk-detective/#.VCHrTitdUpK|publisher=NASA|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public (aka the users) is invited to search through images captured by space agency's [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]] (WISE))&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA Releases New WISE Mission Catalog of Entire Infrared Sky|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/WISE/news/wise20120314.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other sky surveys: the Two Micron All Sky Survey ([[2MASS]]), the [[Digitized Sky Survey]] (DSS) and the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] (SDSS).

The images in Disk Detective have all been pre-selected to be extra bright at wavelengths where circumstellar dust emits thermal radiation. They are at [[mid-infrared]], near-infrared and optical wavelengths. Disks are not the only heavenly objects that appear bright at [[infrared]] wavelengths; [[Active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]], galaxies, asteroids and interstellar dust clouds also emit at these wavelengths.  Computer [[algorithm]]s can't distinguish the difference, so it is necessary to examine all images by "eye" to make sure that the selected candidates are stars with disks, and not other [[celestial objects]].

==Classification==

At Disk Detective website, the images are presented in animated forms which are called flip books. The users view a flip book and classify the target object based on simple criteria, such as whether it is round in DSS2 or 2MASS images, or the object is extended beyond circle in WISE images, if there is more than one object in the circle or if it's off the crosshairs.

The ideal target is classified as '''good candidate''', and further vetted by the advanced research group into a list of '''debris disk of interest''' (or '''DDOI''') candidates.

The selected disk candidates will eventually become the future targets for NASA's [[Hubble Space Telescope]] and its successor, the [[James Webb Space Telescope]]. They also will be the topic for future publications in the scientific literature.

==Seeking objects==
The disks that NASA's scientists at the [[Goddard Space Flight Centre]] aim to find are [[debris disks]], which are older than 5 million years; and [[Young Stellar Object]], or YSO disks, which are younger than 5 million years.

==Discoveries==
The project has so far discovered the first debris disk with a white dwarf companion ([[HD 74389]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Kuchner|first1=Marc J.|last2=Silverberg|first2=Steven M.|last3=Bans|first3=Alissa S.|last4=Bhattacharjee|first4=Shambo|last5=Kenyon|first5=Scott J.|last6=Debes|first6=John H.|last7=Currie|first7=Thayne|last8=Garcia|first8=Luciano|last9=Jung|first9=Dawoon|last10=Lintott|first10=Chris|last11=McElwain|first11=Michael|last12=Padgett|first12=Deborah L.|last13=Rebull|first13=Luisa M.|last14=Wisniewski|first14=John P.|last15=Nesvold|first15=Erika|last16=Schawinski|first16=Kevin|last17=Thaller|first17=Michelle L.|last18=Grady|first18=Carol A.|last19=Biggs|first19=Joseph|last20=Bosch|first20=Milton|last21=Cernohous|first21=Tadeás|last22=Luca|first22=Hugo A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11095">A '''diversion program''' in the criminal justice system is a form of [[Sentence (law)|sentence]]&lt;ref name="vicMag"&gt;[http://www.magistratescourt.vic.gov.au/home/criminal+diversion+program/ Criminal Justice Diversion Program], Australia, Magistrates Court of Victoria; see also the "[http://www.magistratescourt.vic.gov.au/home/criminal+proceedings/sentencing/ Community Correction Order.]" Accessed 2012-3-3.&lt;/ref&gt; in which the [[Offence (law)|criminal offender]] joins a rehabilitation program, which will help remedy the behavior leading to the original arrest, and avoid conviction and a [[criminal record]].  The programs are often run by a police department, court, a [[district attorney]]'s office, or outside agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diversion Program|url=http://county.pueblo.org/government/county/department/county-district-attorney/diversion-program|website=Pueblo, Colorado|publisher=Pueblo County, Colorado|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Problem-solving courts]] typically include a diversion component as part of their program. The purposes of diversion are generally thought to include relief to the courts, police department and [[probation]] office, better outcomes compared to direct involvement of the court system, and an opportunity for the offender to avoid prosecution by completing various requirements for the program.&lt;ref name="niagara"&gt;[http://www.jhs-niagara.ca/diversion.htm Diversion], The John Howard Society of Niagara, Canada. Accessed 2012-3-3.&lt;/ref&gt; These requirements may include:
*Education aimed at preventing future offenses by the offender
*[[Restitution]] to victims of the offense
*Completion of [[community service]] hours
*Avoiding situations for a specified period in the future that may lead to committing another such offense (such as contact with certain people)&lt;ref name="niagara" /&gt;

Diversion programs often frame these requirements as an alternative to court or police involvement or, if these institutions are already involved, further [[Prosecutor|prosecution]].  Successful completion of program requirements often will lead to a dropping or reduction of the charges while failure may bring back or heighten the penalties involved. Charges dismissed because of a diversion program will still lead to additional [[Criminal record|criminal history]] points under the [[United States Federal Sentencing Guidelines|US Sentencing Guidelines]] if there was a finding of [[guilt (law)|guilt]] by a court or the defendant pleaded guilty or otherwise admitted guilt in open court, provided that the deferred disposition was not a juvenile matter.&lt;ref name="sGL"&gt;[http://www.ussc.gov/Guidelines/2011_Guidelines/Manual_HTML/4a1_2.htm US Sentencing Guidelines, 4A1.2(f)], 2011 revision; and see note 9: "Diversionary Dispositions.—Section 4A1.2(f) requires counting prior adult diversionary dispositions if they involved a judicial determination of guilt or an admission of guilt in open court.  This reflects a policy that defendants who receive the benefit of a rehabilitative sentence and continue to commit crimes should not be treated with further leniency."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diversion and juvenile justice ==

Diversion has played a key role in improving outcomes and rehabilitating youthful offenders.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}  The concept of juvenile diversion is based on the theory that processing certain youth through the juvenile justice system may do more harm than good.&lt;ref name="jjBull"&gt;[https://www.ncjrs.gov/html/ojjdp/9909-3/div.html Diversion Programs: An Overview], Juvenile Justice Bulletin September 1999, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, Office of Justice Programs. Accessed 2012-3-3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Programs meant to divert [[Juvenile delinquency|juvenile delinquents]] are often fundamentally different from the programs meant for adults.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}  Many times youth will present with [[substance abuse]] and [[mental health]] issues which may be the underlying cause of such delinquency.

A Juvenile Diversion program has the ability to be used as an intervention strategy for first time offenders who have broken the law and found themselves in the juvenile justice system ("Juvenile Diversion Programs").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crimesolutions.gov/PracticeDetails.aspx?ID=37|title=Juvenile Diversion Programs|website=www.crimesolutions.gov|access-date=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many benefits to this program that include, avoiding the child from being influenced by more serious criminals in a juvenile detention center, allowing the courts to use resources that are needed for those juvenile delinquents who are an actual threat to the society, and getting the child help with drug addiction or family issues (Cocozza).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cocozza|first=Joseph J.|date=|title=Diversion From the Juvenile Justice System: The Miami-Dade Juvenile Assessment Center Post-Arrest Diversion Program|url=|journal=Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the United Kingdom==
Diversion can ensure that people with mental health problems who enter (or are at risk of entering) the criminal justice system are identified and provided with appropriate mental health services, treatment and any other support they need. In the UK, Centre for Mental Health has shown that such diversion represents good value for money, with well-designed intervention helping to reduce reoffending by a third.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.centreformentalhealth.org.uk/pdfs/Diversion_business_case.pdf |title=Diversion: the business case for action |publisher=Centre for Mental Health, Rethink and the Royal College of Psychiatrists |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103103811/http://www.centreformentalhealth.org.uk/pdfs/Diversion_business_case.pdf |archive-date=November 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The need for joined-up services was the focus of a Centre for Mental Health lecture in 2011, in which NHS Confederation chairman Sir Keith Pearson emphasised the need to use custody more effectively and divert those who need it into treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Mental Health, Criminal Justice and the Big Society: Everybody's Responsibility | url=http://www.centreformentalhealth.org.uk/criminal_justice/Centre_lecture_pearson.aspx |author=Keith Pearson JP |date=February 15, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402171049/http://www.centreformentalhealth.org.uk/criminal_justice/Centre_lecture_pearson.aspx |archive-date=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, the UK government pledged to roll out a national liaison and diversion service by 2014, with 101 sites were duly announced by the Department of Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wms/?id=2012-01-12a.22WS.1&amp;s=mental%20health#g22WS.2|title=Health and Criminal Justice Liaison and Diversion Programme: Hansard Written Answers|date=January 12, 2012|publisher=TheyWorkForYou|author=Burstow, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diversion has also been found to be a key element of a more effective approach for young adults in the criminal justice process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.centreformentalhealth.org.uk/news/2012_diversion_young_people_CJ-system.aspx |title=Diversion is a key element of a more effective approach for young adults in the criminal justice process |date= May 23, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231203746/http://www.centreformentalhealth.org.uk/news/2012_diversion_young_people_CJ-system.aspx |archive-date=December 31, 2012 |dead-url=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; A two-year UK pilot organised by the Centre for Mental health, with support and funding from the Department of Health the Youth Justice Board, looked into how to ensure that children and young people with mental health and other problems get the help they need as soon as they enter the youth justice system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.centreformentalhealth.org.uk/criminal_justice/youngpeople.aspx |title=Young people in the criminal justice system |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100911173236/http://www.centreformentalhealth.org.uk/criminal_justice/youngpeople.aspx |archive-date=September 11, 2010 |dead-url=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the United States==

The availability of diversion programs depends upon the jurisdiction, the nature of the crime (usually non-violent offences) and in many cases the exercise of prosecutorial discretion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Pre-Prosecution Diversion|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/criminal-law/what-pre-prosecution-diversion|website=ExpertLaw|publisher=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 ''[[The New York Times]]'' investigation revealed that some prosecutors charged substantial fees for, and received significant revenue from, diversion programs.&lt;ref name="NYTDiversion"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dewan|first1=Shaila|last2=Lehren|first2=Andrew W.|title=After a Crime, the Price of a Second Chance|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/12/us/crime-criminal-justice-reform-diversion.html|accessdate=1 January 2017|work=The New York Times|date=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those fees can operate as a barrier to impecunious defendants accessing diversion. Pleading guilty is often a prerequisite to access to a diversion program. This means that if a defendant proceeds to a diversion program, then fails to pay the fee for the program, the defendant can be brought back to court and proceed directly to conviction and sentencing.&lt;ref name="NYTDiversion"/&gt;

Some jurisdictions in the United States may provide diversion programs for [[drunk driving in the United States|drunk driving]] charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orangecountyfl.net/portals/0/resource%20library/jail/pretrial%20diversion%20information.pdf|title=Misdmeanor/DUI Pretrial diversion Information|date=May 2015|publisher=Orange County Corrections Department|accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such program is the Victim Impact Panel (VIP) administered by [[Mothers Against Drunk Driving]] (MADD) since 1982. MADD typically charges a $25 "[[:wikt:donation#English|donation]]" (which is defined as voluntary), even for court-mandated attendance; MADD reported $2,657,293 one year for such donations on its [[nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] [[tax exemption|tax exempt]] returns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Drinking And Driving War in America | first= Chris | last= Overbey | pages= 45–46 | publisher= [[Lulu (company)|Lulu]] | isbn= 978-1-4116-7022-8 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=NAjoNkPzQLoC&amp;pg=PA45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Florida, several counties offer a diversion program for veterans of the U.S. Armed Forces. Those who qualify and complete the program will have the criminal charge dismissed and can get the case expunged from their record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sao9.net/diversion-programs/ |title=Diversion Programs |publisher=Office of the State Attorney |accessdate=2017-05-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Culture of Pakistan}}
The major ethnic groups of [[Pakistan]] in numerical size include: [[Punjabis]], [[Pashtuns]], [[Sindhis]], [[Siddis]], [[Saraiki people|Saraikis]], [[Muhajir people|Muhajirs]], [[Baloch people|Baloch]], [[Hindkowans]], [[Chitrali people|Chitralis]], [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] and other smaller groups. Smaller ethnic groups, such as [[Kashmiri people|Kashmiris]], [[Kalash people|Kalash]], [[Burusho people|Burusho]], [[Khowar people|Khowar]], [[Palestinians|Falistinis]],[[Hazaras|Hazara]], [[Shina people|Shina]], [[Kalyu]] and [[Balti people|Balti]] are mainly found in the northern parts of the country.

Pakistan's census does not include the 1.7 million [[Afghans in Pakistan|citizens of Afghanistan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unhcrpk.org/unhcr-welcomes-new-government-policy-for-afghans-in-pakistan/|title=UNHCR welcomes new government policy for Afghans in Pakistan|publisher=unhcrpk.org |year=2016|location=Pakistan}}&lt;/ref&gt; who are mainly found in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] (KP) and [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]] (FATA) areas, with small numbers in the cities of [[Karachi]] and [[Quetta]]. Most of this group were born inside Pakistan in the last 30 years and are ethnic [[Pakhtuns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unhcrpk.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/VolRep_Summary_20161101_v1.pdf |date=November 2016 |title=Voluntary Repatriation Update |publisher=UNHCR |location=Pakistan |access-date=2017-11-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170220173655/http://unhcrpk.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/VolRep_Summary_20161101_v1.pdf# |archive-date=2017-02-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major ethnic groups==
[[Image:Ethnic Groups by Region.jpg|thumb|Ethnic Groups by Region]]

=== Sindhis ===
The [[Sindhis]] are an [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]] [[ethno-linguistic group]] who speak the [[Sindhi language]] and are native to the [[Sindh]] province of [[Pakistan]] which was previously a part of pre-[[Partition of India|partition]] [[British Raj|British India]]. Sindhis are predominantly [[Islam|Muslim]].

Sindhi Muslim culture is highly influenced by [[Sufi]] doctrines and principles. Some of the popular cultural icons are [[Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai]], [[Lal Shahbaz Qalandar]], [[Jhulelal (Hinduism)|Jhulelal]], [[Sachal Sarmast]] and Shambumal Tulsiani.[[Image:Ethnic Groups Urban Pakistan.jpg|thumb|Ethnic Groups in Urban Pakistan]]

===Punjabis===
Punjabis are numbered as 91 million and they are the largest ethnic group in Pakistan by population. The Punjabis found in Pakistan belong to groups known as biradaris. In addition, Punjabi society is divided into two divisions, the zamindar groups or qoums, traditionally associated with farming and the moeens, who are traditionally artisans. Some zamindars are further divided into groups such as the [[Punjabi Rajput|Rajputs]], [[Muslim Jats|Jats]], [[Punjabi Shaikh|Shaikhs]] or Muslim [[Khatri|Khatris]], [[Gujjar|Gujjars]], [[Awan (Pakistan)|Awans]], [[Arain|Arains]] and [[Syed|Syeds]].

===Pashtuns===
[[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]] or Pukhtuns (sometimes ''Pathans''), are Pakistan's second largest ethnic group that are native to the land principally northwest of the [[Indus River]] for the past five thousand years. They also reside in many major cities of Pakistan. They speak [[Pashto]], an Iranian language. They make up an estimated 30 million of Pakistan's total population.&lt;ref name=brookings&gt;Livingston, Ian S. and [[Michael E. O'Hanlon|Michael O'Hanlon]] (March 30, 2011).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5432">'''Feudal relief''' was a one-off "fine" or form of [[tax]]ation payable to an overlord by the heir of a feudal tenant to license him to take possession of his [[fief]], i.e. an [[Estate (law)|estate-in-land]], by inheritance. It is comparable to a [[Inheritance tax|death duty or inheritance tax]].

The equivalent duty at the lower levels of the feudal hierarchy was [[heriot]] (in England) or ''le droit du meilleur catel'' (in France).

==Etymology==
The word relief comes from the Latin verb ''levo'', to raise, lift up, elevate, with the addition of the Latin inseparable adverbial particle ''re-'', which has three distinct meanings: back, against and again. The Latin composite verb ''relevo'' results.&lt;ref&gt;Cassell's Latin Dictionary, revised by Marchant &amp; Charles, 260th. thousand&lt;/ref&gt; The term used in mediaeval Latin charters is ''Relevius''. The payment thus obtains an heir's "relief" by his being "re-elevated" or "lifted-up again" into the place of honour and privilege formerly occupied by his predecessor.

==Rationale==
As [[fief]]s were originally granted by [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]] as a reward for past service, there was no logical reason in feudal terms why the tenant's heir should take up the fief without himself having provided the king with some similar valuable past service. The payment of a fine for such "relief" can thus be seen within the logic of feudalism as payment in-lieu of such past service. Thus the right to inherit a fief was akin to a [[pre-emption right]]: the king would re-grant the fief to the heir in priority to a third party, so long as the heir paid his fine. This was a valuable right as the heir was more expert in the exploitation of the fief in question than of any other comparable estate of land, for example he was aware through experience of its optimal cropping rotation based on its differing soil-types and micro-climates, and he had available a local work-force loyal to his family.

==Example from Pipe Rolls==
The [[Pipe Roll]] was a class of parchment roll used by the [[Treasury]] to record financial receipts. The Pipe Roll of 6 Henry III (1222) contains the following entry:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Ricardus filius Willelmi de Scalariis II '''pro relevio suo''' de dimidia baronia...£...'' (''received from'' Richard son of William de Scalarius II '''for his relief''' concerning half a barony.....''the sum of £''...prob. £50)&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, 1960, op.cit. p.30, barony of Caxton, footnote 6&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Varieties of relief==
In the case of a [[English Feudal Baronies|feudal baron]], that is to say one who held ''per baroniam'', it is termed "baronial relief", set at £100. Following [[Magna Carta]] of 1215, the standard rates became one quarter of a year's profit of the estate payable by an under-tenant, and a full year's profit payable by a non-baronial [[tenant-in-chief]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, 9th. ed., vol. 14, "Knighthood"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rates Payable==
It is clear from the pre-eminent positioning in [[Magna Carta]](1215), of the clauses concerning the regulation of relief, that the question of the exaction of extortionate reliefs was one of the major complaints made by the barons to King John. These clauses, in order numbers 2 and 3 follow no other but a clause which promises the free election of bishops to the English church, an issue of paramount significance in the mediaeval world. There can be no better exposition of the charging structure than that given in the Charter itself, which is quoted as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Davis, G.R.C., Magna Carta, Published by the British Library Board, London, 4th. ed.,1982, p.24&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
(2)"If any earl, baron or other person who holds lands directly from the Crown for military service shall die, and at his death his heir shall be of full age and owe a Relief, the heir shall have his inheritance on payment of the ancient scale of Relief. That is to say, the heir or heirs of an earl shall pay £100 for the entire earl's barony, the heir or heirs of a knight 100 shillings at most for the entire [[knight's fee]] and any man that owes less shall pay less in accordance with the ancient usage of fees".
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
(3)"But if the heir of such a person is under age ''(i.e. 21)'' and a [[Ward (law)|ward]], when he comes of age he shall have his inheritance without Relief or fine".
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In summary therefore Magna Carta set feudal relief for earls (who all held ''per baroniam'' and were therefore themselves barons) at £100 and for knights  at 100 shillings ( i.e. £5) per [[knight's fee]], in both cases restoring the rates to their traditional levels. Although no mention appears to be made of the rates payable by barons for their baronies, it is known that the level set was  as for earls, £100.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, 1960, preface, vi&lt;/ref&gt;
The relative proportion of relief for barony and  knight's fee of 20:1 seems to imply that originally a barony consisted of, or was equivalent in some way, to 20 knight's fees.

'''Free-Form Select''' (with [[synonym]]s) is a technique in [[printmaking]], [[graphic design]] and [[image processing]].

The effect is to erase background colors or elements from a [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]] to create stand-alone objects. Today, this is done with [[graphics software]] ([[Computer graphics (computer science)|computer graphics]]) and computers rather than by cutting away parts with [[scissors]] or [[scalpel]]s.

Almost every modern graphics software includes this feature, such as [[CorelDRAW]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corel.com/servlet/Satellite/us/en/Content/1175283343002 referred to as "Vignette Frame"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adobe Photoshop]], [[GIMP]], and [[Paint (software)|Microsoft Paint]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]] only&lt;/ref&gt; The motif which is to be cut-out [[freehanded]] is defined by a border path around the motif.

[[File:OrangeOrange.jpg|thumb|Coloring is a core motif in a black-and-white image.]]
Free-Form Select is also understood in coloring parts of a black-and-white images and vice versa. Coloring a single object within a black-and-white environment is sometimes called [[Sin City#Style|Sin City]] effect.&lt;!-- http://www.youtube.com/user/techtopia#p/c/C21CEDCF8589E119/2/yfJLz3ACPK4 --&gt;

'''Gerontophobia''' is the [[Fear processing in the brain|fear]] of growing old, or a hatred or fear of the elderly. The term comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] γέρων – ''gerōn'', "old man"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dge%2Frwn γέρων], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and  φόβος – ''phobos'', "fear".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dfo%2Fbos φόβος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ageism==
Discriminatory aspects of [[ageism]] have been strongly linked to gerontophobia.&lt;ref&gt;Bunzel, J. H. "Note on the history of a concept-gerontophobia." Gerontologist 12:116-203.&lt;/ref&gt; This irrational fear or hatred of the elderly is associated with the fact that someday all young people will grow old and that old age is associated with death. This unwillingness to accept death manifests in feelings of hostility and discriminatory acts towards the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;Levin, J., &amp; Levin, W. C. (1980). Ageism, prejudice and discrimination against the elderly (p. 94). Belmont, Calif.: Wadsworth Pub. Co..&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Greeks]] have been present in southern [[Russia]] from the 6th century BC; those settlers assimilated into the indigenous populations. The vast majority of contemporary Russia's Greek minority populations are descendants of Medieval Greek refugees, traders, and immigrants (including farmers, miners, soldiers, and churchmen/bureaucrats) from the [[Byzantine Empire]], the [[Ottoman Balkans]], and [[Pontic Greeks]] from the [[Empire of Trebizond]] and [[Eastern Anatolia]] who settled mainly in southern Russia and the [[South Caucasus]] in several waves between the mid-15th century and the second [[Russo-Turkish War]] of 1828-29.

In former Soviet republics, about 70% are Greek-speakers who are mainly descendants of [[Pontic Greeks]] from the [[Pontic Alps]] region of northeast [[Anatolia]], 29% are Turkish-speaking Greeks ([[Urums]]) from [[Tsalka]] in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and 1% are Greek-speakers from [[Mariupol]] in [[Ukraine]].

==History==
===Ancient===
[[File:Greek colonies of the Northern Euxine Sea (Black Sea).svg|thumb|350x350px|Greek colonies in the north of the Black Sea, along with the modern place names]]
{{main|Greeks in pre-Roman Crimea}}
In [[Greek mythology]], various contacts with the part of the world that was later named Russia or the Soviet Union are recorded. The area was vaguely described as the [[Hyperborea]] ("beyond the [[North wind]]") and its mythical inhabitants, the Hyperboreans, were said to have lived blissfully under eternal sunshine. [[Medea]] was a princess of [[Colchis]], modern western [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and was entangled in the myth of [[Jason]] and the [[Golden Fleece]]. The [[Amazons]], a race of fierce female warriors, were placed by [[Herodotus]] in [[Sarmatia]] (modern [[Ukraine]]).
[[File:Bosporan Kingdom growth map-fr.svg|thumb|[[Bosporan Kingdom]]]]
In historical times, Greeks have lived in the present Black Sea region of Russia and the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] since long before the foundation of [[Kievan Rus']], the first Russian state. The Greek name of [[Crimea]] was [[Tauris]] and in mythology it was the home of the tribes who took Iphigenia prisoner in Euripides' play [[Iphigenia in Tauris]].

Trade relations with the [[Scythians]] led to the foundation of the first outposts between 750 and 500&amp;nbsp;BC during the Old [[Greek Diaspora]]. In the Eastern part of the Crimea the [[Bosporan kingdom]] was founded with Panticapaeum (modern [[Kerch]]) as its capital.

The Greeks had to fight off [[Scyth]]ian and [[Sarmatian]] (Alan) raiders who prevented them from progressing inland but retained the shores which became the wheat basket of the ancient Greek world.&lt;ref name=BlackSea/&gt; Following the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Taurica#Roman presence|the Roman conquest]] the provinces maintained active trading relations with the interior for centuries.&lt;ref name=BlackSea&gt;[http://www.blacksea-crimea.com/history1.html History of the Crimea]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UPI&gt;[http://www.nupi.no/cgi-win/Russland/etnisk_b.exe?Greek NUPI Centre for Russian Studies, Ethnic groups, Greeks]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval===
Black Sea trade became more important for [[Constantinople]] as Egypt and Syria were lost to Islam in the 7th century. Greek missionaries were sent among the steppe people, like the [[Alans]] and [[Khazars]]. Most notable were the [[Byzantine Greek]] monks [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]] from [[Thessalonica]] in [[Greek Macedonia]],  who later became known as the apostles of the Slavs.

Many Greeks remained in Crimea after the [[Bosporan kingdom]] fell to the [[Hun]]s and the [[Goth]]s, and [[Chersonesos Taurica|Chersonesos]] became part of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Orthodox monasteries continued to function, with strong links with the monasteries of [[Mount Athos]] in northern Greece.&lt;ref name=BlackSea/&gt;&lt;ref name=UPI/&gt;

Relations with the people from the [[Kievan Rus]] principality were stormy at first, leading to [[Rus'-Byzantine War (disambiguation)|several short lived conflicts]], but gradually raiding turned to trading and many also joined the Byzantine military, becoming its [[Varangians|finest soldiers]]. In 965&amp;nbsp;AD there were 16,000 Crimean Greeks in the joint Byzantine and [[Kievan Rus]] army which invaded [[Bulgaria]].

Subsequently, Byzantine power in the Black Sea region waned, but ties between the two people were strengthened tremendously in cultural and political terms with the baptism of [[Prince Vladimir]] of Kievan Rus in 988 and the subsequent [[Christianization of Kievan Rus'|Christianization]] of his realm.

The post as [[Metropolitan bishop]] of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] was, in fact, with few exceptions, held by a [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantine Greek]] all the way to the 15th century.&lt;ref name=BlackSea/&gt;&lt;ref name=UPI/&gt; One notable such prelate was [[Isidore of Kiev]].

===Tsarist Russia===
[[File:P.I. Melissino (Kursk gallery).jpg|thumb|160px|[[Pyotr Melissino]] (Petros Melissinos), General of the Artillery of the [[Russian Empire]]]]
[[File:Kapodistrias2.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Ioannis Kapodistrias]]]]

With the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in the 15th century, there was an exodus of Greeks to Italy and the West but especially to fellow-Christian Orthodox Russia. Between the fall of the [[Empire of Trebizond]] to the Ottomans in 1461 and the second [[Russo-Turkish War]] of 1828-29 there were several waves of refugee [[Pontic Greeks]] from the eastern [[Black Sea]] coastal districts, the [[Pontic Alps]], and [[Eastern Anatolia]] to southern Russia and Georgia (see also [[Greeks in Georgia]] and [[Caucasus Greeks]]). Together with the marriage of Greek Princess Sophia and Tsar [[Ivan III of Russia]], this provided a historical precedent for the Muscovite political theory of the [[Third Rome]], positing Moscow as the legitimate successor to Rome and Byzantium.

Greeks continued to migrate in the following centuries. Many sought protection in a country with a culture and religion related to theirs. Greek clerics, soldiers and diplomats found employment in Russia and Ukraine while Greek merchants came to make use of privileges that were extended to them in Ottoman-Russian trade.

Under [[Catherine the Great]], Russian armies reached the shores of the Black Sea, followed by the foundation of [[Odessa]] – greatly facilitating the settlement of Greeks, many thousands of whom were settled in the empire’s south under this empress. During the 1828-29 war against the [[Ottoman Empire]] and Russian occupation of [[Erzurum]] and [[Gümüşhane]] many thousands of [[Pontic Greeks]] of the highland regions of [[Eastern Anatolia]] welcomed or collaborated with the invading Russian imperial army. They followed the Russians back into southern Russia and Georgia following the withdrawal from northeastern Anatolia and were resettled by the Russian authorities in southern Georgia and southern Russia and Ukraine. These Greeks are often referred to as Russianized [[Pontic Greeks]], while those of Georgia and the [[South Caucasus]] province of [[Kars Oblast]] are usually referred to as [[Caucasus Greeks]].

There were over 500,000 Greeks in the [[Russian Empire]] prior to the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], between 150,000 and 200,000 of them within the borders of the present-day [[Russian Federation]].&lt;ref name=UPI/&gt;

There have been several notable Greeks from Russia like [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], diplomat of the Russian Empire who became the first head of state of Greece, and the painter [[Arkhip Kuindzhi]].

===Soviet Union===
{{see also|Deportation of the Soviet Greeks}}
In the early years after the [[October Revolution]] of 1917, there were contradictory trends in Soviet governmental policies towards ethnic Greeks. Greeks engaged in trade or other occupations that marked them as ''class enemies'' of the [[Bolshevik]] government - who constituted a large part of the whole - were exposed to a hostile attitude.&lt;ref name=UPI/&gt; This was exacerbated due to the participation of a regiment from Greece, numbering 24,000 troops, in Crimea among the forces intervening on the [[White Movement|White Russian]] side in the  [[Russian Civil War|Civil War of 1919]] &lt;ref name=Greeks&gt;{{el icon}} [http://www.sansimera.gr/archive/articles/show.php?id=382&amp;feature=Campaign_at_Ukraine The Campaign in the Ukraine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309004203/http://www.sansimera.gr/archive/articles/show.php?id=382&amp;feature=Campaign_at_Ukraine |date=2008-03-09 }}, at ''sansimera.gr&lt;/ref&gt;

About 50,000 Greeks emigrated between 1919 and 1924. After 1924 Soviet authorities pressed Greece to ''repatriate'' 70,000 Greeks from Russia, although few actually had ancestors who were citizens of the Greek state.&lt;ref name=UPI/&gt;

On the other hand, as with other ethnic nationalities, the early Bolsheviks under [[Vladimir Lenin]] and his immediate successors were willing to encourage ethnic culture manifestations of those ready to work within the new revolutionary regime.

In this framework, a [[Rumaiic]] ([[Pontic Greek]]) revival occurred in the 1920s. The [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] administration established a [[Greek-Rumaiic theater]], several magazines and newspapers and a number of Rumaiic language schools. The best Rumaiic poet [[Georgi Kostoprav]] created a Rumaiic poetic language for his work. Promoting the Rumaiic, as against the Demotic Greek of Greece, was in effect a way of promoting the separate identity of the Greeks in Russia. The same aim was served by the move away from Greek orthography and to writing Pontic in [[Cyrillic]].

However, official promotion of the Rumaiic did not go unchallenged. In the ''Πανσυνδεσμιακή Σύσκεψη'' (All-Union Conference) of 1926, organized by the Greek-Russian [[intelligentsia]], it was decided that [[Dimotiki|demotic]] should be the official language of the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elemedu.upatras.gr/eriande/synedria/synedrio3/praltika%2011/malkidis-karatzas.htm|script-title=el:ΟΨΕΙΣ ΤΗΣ ΕΚΠΑΙΔΕΥΣΗΣ ΚΑΙ ΤΗΣ ΚΟΙΝΩΝΙΑΣ ΤΩΝ ΕΛΛΗΝΩΝ|work=|accessdate=2011-01-15|language=el|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721084020/http://www.elemedu.upatras.gr/eriande/synedria/synedrio3/praltika%2011/malkidis-karatzas.htm|archivedate=2011-07-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different sources referring to this period differ in putting the emphasis on the positive or the negative aspects of the 1920s Soviet policy.

The [[Greek Autonomous District]] in Southern Russia existed in years 1930-1939. Its capital was [[Krymsk]]aya.
[[File:Греческая церковь Св. Елены и Константина.jpg|thumb|The [[Greek Church and Greek School (Taganrog)|Greek Church of Sts Constantine and Helena]] in [[Taganrog]] was shut down and demolished in 1938.]]
The policy underwent a sharp reversal in 1937. At the time of the [[Moscow Trials]] and the purges targeting various groups and individuals who aroused [[Joseph Stalin]]'s often unbased suspicions, policies towards ethnic Greeks became unequivocally harsh and hostile. Kostoprav and many other Rumaiics and Urums were killed, and a large percentage of the population was detained and transported to [[Gulag]]s or deported to remote parts of the Soviet Union.

Greek Orthodox churches, Greek-language schools and other cultural institutions were closed. During the "[[Grecheskaya Operatsiya]]" (Греческая Операция), i.e., ''Greek Operation''{{Cref|a}}, launched on Stalin's orders in December 1937, there were mass arrests of Greeks, especially but not only wealthy and self-employed, affecting some 50,000 Greeks out of an overall community of 450,000.

In the immediate aftermath of the World War II German invasion of the Soviet Union, ethnic Greeks were included in the 1941–1942 "preventive" deportations of Soviet citizens of "enemy nationality", together with ethnic Germans, Finns, Romanians, Italians, and others - even though Greece fought on the Allied side. The Greeks then suffered under Nazi occupation and when Crimea was liberated in 1944, most of the Greeks were exiled to [[Kazakhstan]], along with the [[Crimean Tatars]]. (Some of these Greeks, known as [[Urums]], spoke a variant of the [[Crimean Tatar language]] as the mother tongue they adopted during centuries of life in proximity to the Tartars).
[[File:Greek Annunciation Church. Rostov-on-Don.jpeg|thumb|The [[Annunciation Greek Orthodox Church, Rostov-on-Don|Annunciation Greek Orthodox Church]] in [[Rostov-on-Don]] was demolished in 1964.]]
In a further wave, about 100,000 [[Pontic Greeks]], including 37,000 in the Caucasus area alone, were deported to Central Asia in 1949 during [[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|Stalin's post-war deportations]].

At about the same time, the last major immigration occurred in the opposite direction, of Greeks going to Russia and the Soviet Union. After the end of the [[Greek civil war]] the defeated [[Greek Communist Party|Communist supporters]] became political refugees. Over 10,000 of them ended up in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;James Stuart Olson, Lee Brigance Pappas, Nicholas Charles Pappas, ''An Ethnohistorical Dictionary of the Russian and Soviet Empires'', 1994, {{ISBN|0313274975}}, p. 274&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[de-Stalinization]], Greeks were gradually allowed to return to their homes in the Black Sea region. Many have emigrated to Greece since the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=UPI/&gt;

A new attempt to preserve a sense of ethnic Rumaiic identity started in the mid-1980s. The Ukrainian scholar [[Andriy Biletsky (linguist)|Andriy Biletsky]] created a new Slavonic alphabet but, though a number of writers and poets make use of this alphabet{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}, the population of the region rarely uses it.&lt;ref&gt;Survey carried out in 2001–2004, organized by St. Petersburg State University&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Present ===
Many Greeks in the Soviet Union sought to emigrate to [[Greece]] in the final years before the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]. In 1990, 22,500 [[Pontian Greeks]] left the [[Soviet Union]], a dramatic increase from previous years. Figures for 1991 indicate that about 1,800 left every month, primarily from Central Asia and Georgia.&lt;ref name=Orientation&gt;[http://www.everyculture.com/Russia-Eurasia-China/Greeks-Orientation.html Greeks-Orientation]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today most Greeks in the former USSR speak [[Russian language|Russian]],&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ethnic Groups Worldwide: A Ready Reference Handbook|author=Levinson, D.|date=1998|publisher=Oryx Press|isbn=9781573560191|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uwi-rv3VV6cC|page=34|accessdate=2014-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedic Ethnography of Middle-East and Central Asia|author=Khanam, R.|date=2005|volume=1|publisher=Global Vision Publishing House|isbn=9788182200630|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q_189OeDwSMC|page=248|accessdate=2014-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a significant number speaking their traditional [[Pontic Greek]]. Pontian is a Greek dialect that derives from the ancient [[Ionic Greek]] dialect and resembles ancient Greek more than the modern "demotic" Greek language.

Until recently, the ban on teaching Greek in Soviet schools meant that Pontian was spoken only in a domestic context. Consequently, many Greeks, especially those of the younger generation, speak Russian as their first language.&lt;ref name=book/&gt;

Linguistically, Greeks are far from being unified. In Ukraine alone, there are at least five documented Greek linguistic groups, which are broadly categorized as the "[[Rumeíka|Mariupol dialect]]", a term derived from the city of [[Mariupol]], a traditional center of this community. Other Greeks in the [[Crimea]] speak [[Crimean Tatar language|Tatar]], and in regions such as [[Tsalka]] in Georgia there are numerous [[Urums|Turkophone Greeks]].&lt;ref name=book/&gt;

Greeks were permitted to teach their own language again during [[Perestroika]], and a number of schools are now teaching Greek. Because of their strongly [[philhellenic]] sentiments and ambitions to live in Greece, this is normally modern, [[Demotic Greek]] rather than Pontian.&lt;ref name=Orientation/&gt;

Cosmonaut [[Fyodor Yurchikhin]] has Greek Ancestry.

Close to 35% of the Russian Greeks live in the Caucasian province of [[Stavropol Krai]], mainly [[Caucasus Greeks]] and [[Pontic Greeks]]. The city of [[Yessentuki]] is regarded as the Greek cultural capital of Russia. Many of the famous Greek Russians, like [[Euclid Kyurdzidis]] hail from this city where Greeks constitute 5.7% (Up from 5.4% in 1989) of the total population. Greeks constitute 3% (2.9% in 1989) of the population in [[Zheleznovodsk]] City and 4.7% in Inozemtsevo (5.1% in 1989). But the majority of the Greeks live in the rural regions of Stavropol and major concentrations can be found in the rural districts of Andropovsky (3.3% in 2002, 2.1% in 1989), Mineralovodsky (3.8% in 2002, 3.4% in 1989) and Predgorny (16.0% in 2002, 12.2% in 1989).&lt;ref name="stavstat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stavstat.ru/perepis/vpn2002/nsn/Forms/web_view.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090927030842/http://www.stavstat.ru/perepis/vpn2002/nsn/Forms/web_view.aspx |archive-date=2009-09-27 |dead-url=yes |title=Территориальный орган Федеральной службы государственной статистики по Ставропольскому краю - Национальный состав населения |accessdate=2014-11-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the ethnic Greek population decreased in many provinces due to emigration, in the Stavropol province it actually rose from 26,828 in 1989 to 34,078 in 2002. A significant ethnic Greek population also exists in nearby [[Krasnodar Krai]].

[[Yanis Kanidis]], a man who rescued children in the [[Beslan hostage crisis]], was of Greek descent.

In recent years, many Russian émigrés of Greek descent who had left in the early 1990s have returned to Russia, often with their Greece-born children. The return emigration is largely due to the economic crisis that Greece has been experiencing since 2008.

The '''history of organized firefighting''' began in ancient Rome while under the rule of Augustus.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wHEGcPZZmHwC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=ancient+roman+fire+sale&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yqgq4pMZ7A&amp;sig=bGNPGAlSV3GHEi4IuqxuCjTiyIM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qvVyUJPNA-rY2AXvpoCQBQ&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=ancient%20roman%20fire%20sale&amp;f=false Ancient Rome: From the Early Republic to the Assassination of Julius Caeser,  M.

==Rome==

The first ever Roman fire brigade of which we have any substantial history was created by [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]]. Marcus Licinius Crassus was born into a wealthy Roman family around the year 115 BC, and acquired an enormous fortune through (in the words of Plutarch) "fire and rapine." One of his most lucrative schemes took advantage of the fact that Rome had no fire department. Crassus filled this void by creating his own brigade—500 men strong—which rushed to burning buildings at the first cry of alarm. Upon arriving at the scene, however, the fire fighters did nothing while their employer bargained over the price of their services with the distressed property owner. If Crassus could not negotiate a satisfactory price, his men simply let the structure burn to the ground, after which he offered to purchase it for a fraction of its value. Emperor Nero took the basic idea from Crassus and then built on it to form the ''[[Vigiles]]'' in AD 60 to combat fires using bucket brigades and pumps, as well as poles, hooks and even ballistae to tear down buildings in advance of the flames. The Vigiles patrolled the streets of Rome to watch for fires and served as a police force. The later brigades consisted of hundreds of men, all ready for action. When there was a fire, the men would line up to the nearest water source and pass buckets hand in hand to the fire.

Rome suffered a number of serious fires, most notably the fire on [[Great_Fire_of_Rome|19 July AD 64]] which eventually destroyed two thirds of Rome.

In [[Europe]], firefighting was quite rudimentary until the 17th century. In 1254, a royal decree of King [[Louis IX of France|Saint Louis]] of France created the so-called ''guet bourgeois'' ("burgess watch"), allowing the residents of Paris to establish their own night watches, separate from the king's night watches, to prevent and stop crimes and fires. After the [[Hundred Years' War]], the population of Paris expanded again, and the city, much larger than any other city in Europe at the time, was the scene of several great fires in the 16th century. As a consequence, King [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]] disbanded the residents' night watches and left the king's watches as the only one responsible for checking crimes and fires.

[[London]] suffered [[Early fires of London|great fires]] in 798, 982, 989, 1212 and above all in 1666 (the [[Great Fire of London]]). The Great Fire of 1666 started in a baker's shop on Pudding Lane, consumed about two square miles (5&amp;nbsp;km²) of the city, leaving tens of thousands homeless. Prior to this fire, London had no organized fire protection system. Afterwards, insurance companies formed private fire brigades to protect their clients’ property. Insurance brigades would only fight fires at buildings the company insured. These buildings were identified by [[fire insurance marks]]. 
The key breakthrough in firefighting arrived in the 17th century with the first fire engines. Manual pumps, rediscovered in Europe after 1500 (allegedly used in [[Augsburg]] in 1518 and in Nuremberg in 1657), were only [[force pump]]s and had a very short range due to the lack of hoses. [[Germany|German]] inventor [[Hans Hautsch]] improved the [[manual pump]] by creating the first [[suction and force pump]] and adding some flexible hoses to the pump. In 1672, [[Netherlands|Dutch]] artist and inventor [[Jan Van der Heyden]]'s workshop developed the [[fire hose]]. Constructed of flexible [[leather]] and coupled every 50 feet (15 m) with [[brass]] fittings. The length remains the standard to this day in mainland Europe whilst in the UK the standard length is either 23m or 25m. 
The [[fire apparatus|fire engine]] was further developed by the Dutch inventor, merchant and manufacturer, [[John Lofting]] (1659–1742) who had worked with Jan Van der Heyden in Amsterdam. Lofting moved to London in or about 1688, became an English citizen and patented (patent number 263/1690) the "Sucking Worm Engine" in 1690. There was a glowing description of the firefighting ability of his device in The London Gazette of 17 March 1691, after the issue of the patent. 
The British Museum has a print showing Lofting's fire engine at work in London, the engine being pumped by a team of men. In the print three fire plaques of early insurance companies are shown, no doubt indicating that Lofting collaborated with them in firefighting. A later version of what is believed to be one of his fire engines has been lovingly restored by a retired firefighter, and is on show in Marlow Buckinghamshire where John Lofting moved in 1700. Patents only lasted for fourteen years and so the field was open for his competitors after 1704. 
 
[[Richard Newsham]] of Bray in Berkshire (just 8 miles from Lofting) produced and patented an improved engine in 1721 (Royal Patent Office 1721 patent #439 and 1725 patent #479) and soon dominated the fire engine market in England. Pulled as a cart to the fire, these manual pumps were manned by teams of 4 to 12 men and could deliver up to 160 gallons per minute (12 L/s) at up to 120 feet (36 m). Newsham himself died in 1743 but his company continued making fire engines under other managers and names into the 1770s. The next major development in fire engine design in England was made by Hadley, Simpkin &amp; Lott co. in 1792 with a larger and much improved style of hand pumped engine which could be pulled to a fire by horses.

In 1631, [[Boston]]'s governor [[John Winthrop]] outlawed wooden chimneys and thatched roofs.&lt;ref name="FIR"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.firefightercentral.com/history/firefighting_in_colonial_america.htm|title=Firefighting In Colonial America|last=|first=|date=|website=Fire Fighter Central|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610030631/http://www.firefightercentral.com/history/firefighting_in_colonial_america.htm|archive-date=2007-06-10|dead-url=|accessdate=2007-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1648, the [[New Amsterdam]] governor [[Peter Stuyvesant]] appointed four men to act as fire wardens.&lt;ref name="FIR"/&gt; They were empowered to inspect all chimneys and to fine any violators of the rules. The city burghers later appointed eight prominent citizens to the "Rattle Watch" - these men volunteered to patrol the streets at night carrying large wooden rattles.&lt;ref name="FIR"/&gt; If a fire was seen, the men spun the rattles, then directed the responding citizens to form bucket brigades. On January 27, 1678 the first fire engine company went into service with its captain (foreman) Thomas Atkins.&lt;ref name="FIR"/&gt; In 1736 [[Benjamin Franklin]] established the [[Union Fire Company]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name="FIR"/&gt;

The United States did not have government-run fire departments until around the time of the [[American Civil War]]. Prior to this time, private fire brigades  competed with one another to be the first to respond to a fire because [[insurance company|insurance companies]] paid brigades to save buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013013408/http://www.afirepro.com/history.html|title=A Fire Pro - History of Fire Fighting|website=www.afirepro.com|access-date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Underwriters also employed their own [[Salvage Corps]] in some cities.  The first known female firefighter [[Molly Williams]] took her place with the men on the dragropes during the blizzard of 1818 and pulled the pumper to the fire through the deep snow.

On April 1 of 1853, Cincinnati, Ohio featured the first professional fire department made up of 100% full-time employees.

In 2015, 70 percent of firefighters in the United States were volunteer. Only 4% of calls were actual fires. 64% were medical aid. 8% were false alarms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfpa.org//~/media/files/news-and-research/fire-statistics/fact-sheets/usfireservicefactsheet.pdf The United States Fire Service Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern development==
The first fire brigades in the modern sense were created in [[France]] in the early 18th century. In 1699, a man with bold commercial ideas, [[François du Mouriez du Périer]] (grandfather of [[French Revolution]] general [[Charles François Dumouriez]]), solicited an audience with King [[Louis XIV]]. Greatly interested in Jan Van der Heyden's invention, he successfully demonstrated the new pumps and managed to convince the king to grant him the monopoly of making and selling "fire-preventing portable pumps" throughout the kingdom of France. François du Mouriez du Périer offered 12 pumps to the City of Paris, and the first Paris Fire Brigade, known as the ''Compagnie des gardes-pompes'' (literally the "[[Company (military unit)|Company]] of Pump Guards"), was created in 1716. François du Mouriez du Périer was appointed ''directeur des pompes de la Ville de Paris'' ("director of the City of Paris's pumps"), i.e. chief of the Paris Fire Brigade, and the position stayed in his family until 1760. In the following years, other fire brigades were created in the large French cities. Around that time appeared the current French word ''pompier'' ("firefighter"), whose literal meaning is "pumper." On March 11, 1733 the French government decided that the interventions of the fire brigades would be free of charge. This was decided because people always waited until the last moment to call the fire brigades to avoid paying the fee, and it was often too late to stop fires. From 1750 on, the French fire brigades became para-military units and received uniforms. In 1756 the use of a protective helmet for firefighters was recommended by King [[Louis XV]], but it took many more years before the measure was actually enforced on the ground.

In [[North America]], [[Jamestown, Virginia]] was virtually destroyed in a fire in January, 1608. There were no full-time paid firefighters in America until 1850. Even after the formation of paid fire companies in the United States, there were disagreements and often fights over territory. [[New York City]] companies were famous for sending runners out to fires with a large barrel to cover the hydrant closest to the fire in advance of the engines.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.windsorfire.com/a-brief-history-of-firefighting/|title=A Brief History of Firefighting - WindsorFire.com|date=2006-01-22|work=WindsorFire.com|access-date=2017-09-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often fights would break out between the runners and even the responding fire companies for the right to fight the fire and receive the insurance money that would be paid to the company that fought it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During the 19th century and early 20th century volunteer fire companies served not only as fire protection but as political machines. The most famous volunteer firefighter politician is [[Boss Tweed]], head of the notorious [[Tammany Hall]] political machine, who got his start in politics as a member of the Americus Engine Company Number 6 ("The Big Six") in New York City.

[[Napoleon Bonaparte]], drawing from the century-old experience of the ''gardes-pompes'', is generally attributed as creating the first "professional" firefighters, known as [[Sapeurs-Pompiers]] ("[[Sapper]]s-Firefighters"), from the [[French Army]]. Created under the Commandant of Engineers in 1810, the company was organized after a fire at the ballroom in the Austrian Embassy in Paris which injured several dignitaries.

In the UK, the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666 set in motion changes which laid the foundations for organised firefighting in the future. In the wake of the Great Fire, the City Council established the first fire insurance company, "The Fire Office", in 1667, which employed small teams of Thames [[watermen]] as firefighters and provided them with uniforms and arm badges showing the company to which they belonged.

However, the first organised municipal fire brigade in the world was established in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]], when the Edinburgh Fire Engine Establishment was formed in 1824, led by [[James Braidwood (firefighter)|James Braidwood]]. London followed in 1832 with the [[London Fire Brigade|London Fire Engine Establishment]].

On April 1, 1853, the [[Cincinnati Fire Department]] became the first full-time paid professional fire department in the United States, and the first in the world to use steam fire engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cincinnati-oh.gov/fire/about-fire/history/|title=History - Fire|website=City of Cincinnati}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first horse-drawn steam engine for fighting fires was invented in 1829, but not accepted in structural firefighting until 1860, and ignored for another two years afterwards. Internal combustion engine fire engines arrived in 1907, built in the United States, leading to the decline and disappearance of steam engines by 1925.

'''Hyperpersonal theory''' (HPT) is related and understood through [[computer-mediated communication]](CMC). Hyperpersonal theory is part of [[interpersonal communication]] theory meaning that the HPT suggests CMC due to the uses technological messages rather than [[face-to-face interaction]]s. According to Erin Schumaker (2013) the hyperpersonal theory represents how people communicate online rather than FtF.  The theory displays predictions on how people present themselves in a virtual environment. HPT demonstrates how individuals communicate uniquely, while representing themselves to others, how others interpret them, and how the interactions create a reciprocal spiral of FtF communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schumaker|first1=Erin|date=2013|title=Exploring the Hyperpersonal Model: Determining the inflated nature of feedback in computer-mediated communication|journal=Dissertation at Ohio State University|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Walther ==
Joseph Walther is noted to be the founder of this theory, however, he uses his finding to teach at the University of California, Santa Barbara. In his research he found "the hyperpersonal model of CMC proposes a set of concurrent theoretically based processes to explain how CMC may facilitate impressions and relationships online"&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{cite book|title=Processes and Functions|last1=Walther|first1=Joseph|location=Chapter 14|pages=443–471|accessdate=24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared to FtF relationships. The model Walther created has four main components that illustrate how CMC relates to message structure and reception:&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

# Effects due to receiver processes
# Effects among message senders
# Attributes of the channel
# Feedback effects

Effects due to receiver processes explains how communication could be misunderstood or exaggerated perceptions by the sender. By this, Walther explains that without FtF interactions and gesture cues, receivers fill in the missing information from the sender. The second component involves the sender. Walther illustrates that senders are able to avoid distractions of conversation with FtF interaction, allowing the sender to compose messages making themselves more desirable over text and online rather than the receiver being able to see their characteristics and gesture cues. Senders are able to disclose information while being able to provide only the information they want the receiver to know. The third component describes how CMC is the channel of the conversation. In this section, senders are able to take their time and craft messages or responses without conversation flow.  Senders are able to perfect messages through the channel without  communication interruptions. The fourth component involves feedback from CMC. It exemplifies behavioral conformation and overall impressions made by the receiver of the channel. The feedback effects component has been under study recently due to acknowledging if this component was enhancing the identity of the sender.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; These four components represent how CMC may effect how relationships online exceed offline relationships.

== Background ==
Orignination of the hyperpersonal theory model came from [[Joseph Walther]]. He is the Director of Center for Information Technology and Society at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Walther, according to the University of California, Santa Barbara says, "his teaching and research focus on [[computer-mediated communication]] (CMC) and social media in personal relationships, groups, educational settings, and inter-ethic conflict, topics on which he has contributed several original theories and numerous experiments and surveys".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comm.ucsb.edu/people/joe-walther|title=UC Santa Barbara Department of Communication|website=comm.ucsb.edu|accessdate=24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Computer-mediated communication ==
Computer-mediated communication, also known as CMC, relates to hyperpersonal theory model because it suggests that computer-mediated communication can turn hyperpersonal since they both lack the use of face-to-face communication. CMC "may be [[wikt:impersonal|impersonal]]".&lt;ref name=":023"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walther |first1=Joseph B. |title=Computer-Mediated Communication |journal=Communication Research |date=29 June 2016 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=3–43 |doi=10.1177/009365096023001001}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are now online friendships and virtual communities. CMC was "emerged as an unintended byproduct of linking large computers to one another for security and information redundancy".&lt;ref name=":023"/&gt; In doing so, operators found that the computers were able to send messages to other people, enabling computer-mediated communication. From this, researchers began to question whether CMC could replace traveling to events, such as business meetings, and indicate whether or not CMC might provide meetings more effective than FtF meetings.&lt;ref name=":023"/&gt; This is where researchers developed online behaviors vs personal interaction behaviors. They tested this by interactions through e-mail. Researchers then found that computer-mediated communication was more task-oriented rather than FtF conversations/meetings.

In contrast, Daft and Lengel's [[Media richness theory|Media Richness theory]] depict FtF interactions contain more richness than CMC. Daft and Lengel state, "messages should be communicated on channels with sufficient and appropriate media richness capacities."&lt;ref name=":423"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carlson|first=John|last2=Zmud|first2=Robert|date=April 1999|title=Channel Expansion Theory and the Experiential Nature of Media Richness Perceptions|url=|journal=The Academy of Management Journal|volume=42|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They continue to propose that "messages communicated on channels that are inappropriate to the equivocality of a situation and the richness of the information may be misinterpreted by recipients or may be otherwise ineffective"&lt;ref name=":423" /&gt; Whereas, Walther explains HPT represents how communication interpersonally online has enhanced society with new technologies, allowing people to create virtual communities. Walther enacted the finding and research of CMC when Daft and Lengel stated that management problems became too difficult and complex; stating that the richness of communication was lost when tying to convey adequate insight and understanding &lt;ref name=":023"/&gt; Walther explains that growing numbers of reports indicate that CMC interactions are sometimes just as interactive as FtF interactions.

== Uses of Hyperpersonal theory ==
Hyperpersonal theory Model describes how people use virtual communication, or [[computer-mediated communication]], rather than [[face-to-face communication]] (FtF). There are two directions Walther makes on the work of CMC and its interpersonal effects:&lt;ref name=":023"/&gt;

# To integrate theories and findings based on impersonal and interpersonal interactions in CMC, allowing favorable outcomes for certain contexts in HPT &lt;ref name=":023"/&gt;
# To view a new perspective on intimacy, solidarity, and liking via CMC, allowing HPT to surpass FtF interpersonal communication.&lt;ref name=":023"/&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Jiang, Bazarova, and Hancock ===
Jiang, Bazarova, and Hancock use Joseph Walther's hyperpersonal theory model to indicate the understandings of intimacy interpersonal relationships through CMC. In their study, the three researchers established "some online relationships tend to be more intimate than FtF relationships and CMC interactions are often rated as significantly more intimate than FtF counterparts. One approach to explain this phenomenon is the hyperpersoanl model, which highlights the cognitive and behavioral processes and CMC affordances that can contribute to greater online intimacy".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jiang|first=Crystal|last2=Bazarova|first2=Natalie|last3=Hancock|first3=Jeffrey|date=2010|title=The Disclosure–Intimacy Link in Computer-Mediated Communication: An Attributional Extension of the Hyperpersonal Model|url=|journal=Human Communication Research|volume=37|pages=58–77|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They depicted that people tend to "put their best foot forward"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; while engaging in CMC relationships. They found that CMC allows a person to self-present themselves. One thing they studied throughout this research was the context of online dating. Online dating allows a person to post a picture of themselves that they chose and avoid a less attractive photo of them. Jiang, Bazarova and Hancock discovered that "related to the sender's behavior in CMC, people appear to be more comfortable disclosing personal information in CMC than FtF".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Jiang, et al. argue this may lead to a "more positive hyperpersonal relationship”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Related theories ==

=== Daft &amp; Lengel's Media Richness Theory ===
Daft and Lengel's Media Richness theory first began in the setting of organizations to evaluate media channels within. The theory describes having a set of organizational communication channels with objectives that enable researchers to determine the capacity of rich information.&lt;ref name=":423"/&gt; According to Daft and Lengel, they believe communication channels such as email and phone recede the necessary abilities to convey messages that use rich information.&lt;ref name=":423"/&gt;

=== Kock's Media Naturalness and Channel Expansion Theory ===
[[Ned Kock]], is a researcher of the [[Media naturalness theory|Media Naturalness]] and [[Channel expansion theory|Channel Expansion theory]] (CET). In 2004, Kock originally argued that humans were not equipped to deal with CMC when compared to "richer" forms of communication like FtF interactions. He reasoned this by stating that people evolved in FtF communication and have not had time to evolve into being equally adequate CMC communicators. The Channel Expansion Theory (Carlson and Zmud 1999) essentially undercut Kock's view of evolutionary changes. CET illustrates how a person is able to develop certain perceptions of a new media channel.&lt;ref name=":423"/&gt; In contrast, in 2011, Kock revisits the issue of Media Naturalness in light of the Channel Expansion theory and, in turn, argues that Media Naturalness and CET can co-exist.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kock|first=Ned|last2=Garza|first2=Vanessa|date=April–June 2011|title=Media Naturalness and Compensatory Channel Expansion: A Study of Online and Face-to-Face Sections of the Same Course|url=|journal=International Journal of Distance Education Technologies|volume=9|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kock finally concludes that CMC interactions can achieve "positive effects" &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; when compared to an equivalent FtF interaction, in the case of distance learning.

== Critique ==
Walther describes some challenges to CMC research. His area of concern lies within three areas:&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt;

# Neglect of off-line comparisons in CMC
# New technologies
# Studying interpersonal communication

Walthers seeks to tell researchers not compare FtF communication with CMC due the fact they rely on different users and features.

According to Charles Soukup (2000), the problem with CMC communication lies within the multi-media aspects. Many researcher have lacked studying new technologies and multi-media outlets in today's society. Researchers are failing to see the new dimensions CMC has to offer, the researchers are relying too much on textual aspects of CMC rather than communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Soukup |first1=Charles |title=Building a Theory of Multi-Media CMC |journal=New Media &amp; Society |date=30 June 2016 |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=407–425 |doi=10.1177/1461444800002004002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Igala''' is a [[Volta–Niger languages|Volta–Niger]] language. It is spoken by the [[Igala people|Igala]] [[ethnic group]] of [[Nigeria]]. In 1989 an estimated 800,000 spoke Igala, primarily in [[Kogi State]], but also in fringe portions of [[Delta State]] (Ebu), [[Edo State]] and Anambra state. Dialects include Ebu, Idah, Imane, Ankpa, Dekina, [[Ogugu]], Ibaji and Ife.

The Igala is related to [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] with which it shares a previous common ancestor, it remains unclear when both language split, mutual intelligibility in modern times is only marginal, although the sound/tonal systems remain the same, akin to the relationship between the various daughter languages of the Romance or Slavic language families. 

The Agatu, [[Idoma people|Idoma]] and [[Basa languages|Bassa]] people use Igala for primary school. The Igala language, as well as Igala culture and tradition, has influenced other languages and cultures around the confluence of the Niger and Benue rivers.

[[File:ConstructionGuinée1904.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Forced labor: The construction of the [[Guinea|Guinée]] railway by African ''sujets'' of [[French West Africa]], c.1904.]]
The '''''Code de l'indigénat''''' ({{IPA-fr|kɔd də lɛ̃diʒena}}, ''Code of the indiginate'') was a set of laws creating, in practice, an inferior legal status for natives of French Colonies from 1887 until 1944–1947.&lt;ref&gt;The ''Code d'Indigénat'' was promulgated by the French government on 28 June 1881, and officially applied to all colonies during 1887.  It was officially abolished during 1946, but parts of it remained in force until independence during the early 1960s.  The ''senatus consulte'' of 14 July 1865 implemented many of the elements of the future Code d'Indigénat in [[Algeria]], and prior to 1887, other colonial subjects lived under similar conditions.&lt;/ref&gt;  Implemented first in Algeria, it was applied across the [[French colonial empires#Second French colonial empire|French Colonial Empire]] during 1887–1889.

==Theoretical basis==
French colonial policy is often contrasted with the British concept of [[indirect rule]] pioneered by [[Frederick Lugard]] of the [[British East Africa Company]] in [[Uganda]] and later the [[Royal Niger Company]] in what is now [[Nigeria]].{{by whom|date=November 2015}} Lugard devised a method of colonial administration which relied upon maintenance of pre-colonial chiefs and other political institutions, who were in turn subject to the authority of British representatives.

The French government, in contrast, published much about the [[Assimilation (French colonial)|assimilation]] of colonial subjects, with the goal of making their colonies integral parts of France, filled with African, Arab, or Asian ''Frenchmen''. This combined with a [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] tradition of centralizing government, has given weight to the argument that French colonial rule stood in stark contrast to other models. But only small areas of France's colonial possessions were ever afforded full rights as [[overseas department]]s of the French state.  Between 1865 and 1962, only 7,000 Algerians became French citizens,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.temoignages.re/article.php3?id_article=12652 Le Code de l’indigénat dans l’Algérie coloniale Temoignages December, 2005]: summary of quotations from academic sources&lt;/ref&gt; in a global empire which, during 1939, counted some 69 million subjects.

The ''Code de l'indigénat'' has been the topic of revised historical thinking about French colonial policy.&lt;ref&gt;Crowder, Michael: Indirect Rule: French and British Style Africa: Journal of the International African Institute, Vol. 34, No. 3 (Jul., 1964)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''indigénat'' is an example of ''Association'': French colonial indirect rule. It enabled an entire legal system by which the vast majority of colonial subjects were governed from the creation of the French Empire until the reforms following World War II. These laws were designed to be enforced by a system of administrative "[[Cercle (French colonial)|cercles]]": appointed indigenous authorities, religious courts, and native police carrying out the orders of often distant French administrators.

The abolition of the ''indigénat'', with its tax burdens, forced labor, and often arbitrary exercise of authority was a primary demand of the opposition to French colonialism.

==Creation in Algeria==
{{See also|French Algeria}}
Algeria saw the piecemeal development of a legal system which would later be formalised and exported around the globe.

The ''Indigénat'' was created first to solve specific problems of administering France's North African colonies during the early to mid-nineteenth century. In 1685, the French royal ''[[Code Noir]]'' decreed the treatment of subject peoples, but it was in Algeria during the 1830s and 1840s that the French government began actively to rule large subject populations. They quickly realized that not only was this impractical in areas without a French population, but French experiences with large groups of subject people had convinced many that both direct rule and eventual assimilation were undesirable.

In 1830, [[Algeria]] became the first modern French colony. The treaty whereby the [[Bey]] of [[Algiers]] capitulated to France stipulated that France undertook not to infringe the freedom of people or their religion. The term ''indigène'' ("native") was already in use in 1830 to describe locals who, whether [[Jewish]] or [[Muslim]], were not considered French prior to the royal decree of 24 February 1834. However, they still did not have full citizenship.

A royal ordinance of 1845 created three types of administration in Algeria. In areas where Europeans comprised a substantial part of the population, the ''colons'' elected mayors and councils for self-governing "full exercise" communes (''communes de plein exercice''). In the "mixed" communes, where Muslims were a large majority, government was exercised by officials, most of whom were appointed but some of whom were elected. These governments included representatives of the ''grands chefs'' (great chieftains) and a French administrator. The indigenous communes (''communes indigènes''), remote areas not adequately pacified, remained under the ''régime du sabre'', direct rule by the military.

The first ''Code de l'indigénat'' was implemented by the Algerian ''senatus consulte'' of 14 July 1865, under [[Napoleon III]], which changed the situation by allowing Algerian Jews and Muslims full citizenship on request. Its first article stipulated that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The Muslim indigenous is French; however, he will continue to be subjected to Muslim law. He may be admitted to serve in the terrestrial and marine Army. He may be called to functions and civil employment in Algeria. He may, on his demand, be admitted to enjoy the rights of a [[French citizenship|French citizen]]; in this case, he is subjected to the political and civil laws of France."&lt;ref&gt;''« L’indigène musulman est français ; néanmoins il continuera à être régi par la loi musulmane. Il peut être admis à servir dans les armées de terre et de mer. Il peut être appelé à des fonctions et emplois civils en Algérie. Il peut, sur sa demande, être admis à jouir des droits de citoyen français ; dans ce cas, il est régi par les lois civiles et politiques de la France » (article 1 of the 1865 [[Code de l'indigénat]])&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This was intended to promote [[Assimilation (French colonialism)|assimilation]], but as few people were willing to abandon their religious values, it had the opposite effect.&lt;ref&gt;Murray Steele, 'Algeria: Government and Administration, 1830-1914', ''Encyclopedia of African History'', ed. by Kevin Shillington, 3 vols (New York: Fitzroy Dearborn, 2005), I pp. 50-52 (at p. 51).&lt;/ref&gt; By 1870, fewer than 200 requests had been registered by Muslims, and 152 by [[History of the Jews in Algeria|Jewish Algerians]].&lt;ref name="Indigenous"&gt;[http://www.ldh-toulon.net/spip.php?article527  le code de l’indigénat dans l’Algérie coloniale] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314151739/http://www.ldh-toulon.net/spip.php?article527 |date=2007-03-14 }}, ''[[Algerian League for Human Rights|Human Rights League]]'' (LDH), March 6, 2005 - URL accessed on January 17, 2007 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1865 decree was then modified by the 1870 [[Adolphe Crémieux|Crémieux decrees]], which granted full [[French nationality]] to the Jews of Algeria, followed in 1889 by ''étrangers'' ("foreigners"). The opposition was keen to give the same right to Muslims, but the French settlers did not want to equip the natives with rights equal to their own, primarily for demographic reasons.{{what|date=October 2016}} Moreover, it was at Algeria's request that an 1889 Act restoring the ''droit du sol'' (French citizenship being awarded to anyone born in France) was not applied to Muslims.

In 1881, the ''Code de l'Indigénat'' formalised ''de facto'' [[discrimination]] by creating specific penalties for ''indigènes'' and organizing the seizure or appropriation of their lands.&lt;ref name="Indigenous"/&gt;

The Franco-Algerian philosopher Sidi Mohammed Barkat has described this legal limbo as: "Not truly inclusion nor in fact exclusion, but the indefinite hanging on for some future inclusion".&lt;ref&gt;

In practical terms, by continuing the fiction that the "indigenous is French", the ''Code de l'indigénat'' enabled French authorities to subject a large, alien population to their rule by legal separation and a practice of indirect institutions to supplement a tiny French governing force.

==Expanding empire 1887–1904==
While the ''Indigénat'' grew from circumstances of the colonial rule of North Africa, it was in sub-saharan Africa and Indochina that the code became formalised.  As French rule expanded during the "[[Scramble for Africa]]", the government found itself nominal ruler of some 50 million people, with only a tiny retinue of French officials. The [[Berlin Conference]] specified that territory seized must be ruled actively, or other powers were welcome to seize it. The ''Indigénat'' was the method by which France ruled all its territories in Africa, [[French Guiana|Guiana]], [[New Caledonia]], and [[Madagascar]] without having to extend the rights of Frenchmen to the people who lived there.

The protectorates ([[Tunisia]] and [[Morocco]] for example) were not affected.&lt;ref name="Bonora-Waisman"&gt;Camille Bonora-Waisman, ''France and the Algerian Conflict: Issues in Democracy and Political Stability, 1988–1995'', Ashgate Publishing, 2003, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In practice: Africa 1887–1946==
''See [[Jean Suret-Canale]]''&lt;ref&gt;For this section, see: Jean Suret-Canale. ''French Colonialism in Tropical Africa 1900–1945''. Trans. Pica Press (1971) pp.331-341&lt;/ref&gt;

===Punishment===
The ''commandant de cercle'', or in practice any caucasian man, was free to impose summary punishment under any of 34 (later 12) headings of infractions specified by the code, ranging from murder to 'disrespect' of France, its symbols, or functionaries. Punishment could range from fines, to 15 days in prison, to immediate execution.&lt;ref&gt;Le Vine, Victor T., ''Politics in Francophone Africa''. Lynne Rienner (2004) pp 48-51 {{ISBN|1-58826-249-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the statute stated that all punishments must be signed by the colonial governor, this was almost always done after the fact.  Corporal punishment was outlawed, but still used regularly. And while these powers were periodically reformed, in practice they became common and arbitrary. More than 1,500 infractions reported officially were punished by the ''indigénat'' in Moyen Congo during 1908–9 alone.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Phyllis: ''Leisure and Society in Colonial Brazzaville'' Cambridge University Press (1995)
pp 83-87 {{ISBN|0-521-52446-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taxes and forced labor===
Along with these punishments were a set of methods for extracting value from colonial subjects. In Africa, these included the ''[[corvée]]'' (forced labor for specific projects),&lt;ref&gt;Babacar Fall and Mohamed Mbodj, "Forced Labor and Migration in Senegal" in ''Forced Labor and Migration: Patterns of Movement within Africa'', edited by Abebe Zegeye and Shubi Ishemo (New York: Hans Zell Publishers, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Prestation'' (taxes paid in forced labor), ''Head Tax'' (often arbitrary monetary taxes, food and property requisitioning, market taxes), and the ''Blood Tax'' (forced conscription to the native [[Tirailleur]] units). All major projects in [[French West Africa]] in this period were performed by forced labor, including work on roads, mines, and in fields of private companies.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew, C. M. and Kanya-Forstner, A. S.: "French Business and the French Colonialists", ''The Historical Journal'', Vol. 19, No. 4 (Dec., 1976) Suret-Canale, Jean. 1966. "La Fin de la Chefferie en Guinée", ''Journal of African History'', Vol. VII, No. 3, pp. 459-493. retrieved at [http://www.guinee.net/bibliotheque/histoire/jscanale/finChefferie/chefferie.html Guinee.net], where example orders from Comandants de Cercle are quoted.&lt;/ref&gt;

Demands for taxes and forced labor varied according to the local ''cercle'', and in some areas, forced contract labor continued as a staple of the colonial economy, for example where private enterprises could not attract sufficient workers&lt;ref&gt;Jean Suret-Canele, pp.233, 247-248,253-256. Detailing forced contracts as long as two years (paid only at the end of contract) in Cote d'Ivoire, [[Congo Brazzaville]] and [[French Madagascar|Madagascar]] for cotton plantations, forestry, and public works&lt;/ref&gt; or for projects of colonial officials.&lt;ref&gt;Myron Echenberg, Jean Filipovich: "African Military Labour and the Building of the Office du Niger Installations, 1925–1950" in ''The Journal of African History'', Vol. 27, No. 3 (1986) Details the 1926 decree allowing long-term forced labor for the building of a vast irrigation system for a largely unpopulated area, which was never used.&lt;/ref&gt; In the inter-war period, the demand for forced labour increased massively: even the most well-intentioned officials often believed in 'forced modernization' (supposing that 'progress' would only result from coercion), while French-created 'Chiefs' also enjoyed tremendous coercive power. This resulted in enrichment for chiefs and the French, and harsh conditions for African labourers.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Klein. ''Slavery and Colonial Rule in French West Africa''. Cambridge University Press (1998) {{ISBN|0-521-59678-5}} pp.208-213.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plantations, forestry operations, and salt mines in Senegal continued to be operated by forced labor, mandated by the local commandant and provided by official chiefs through the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Babacar Fall, "Manifestations of Forced Labor in Senegal: as Exemplified by the Société des Salins du [[Sine-Saloum]] Kaolack 1943–1956" in ''Forced Labor and Migration: Patterns of Movement within Africa'', edited by Abebe Zegeye and Shubi Ishemo (New York: Hans Zell Publishers, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Forced agricultural production was common in sub-Saharan Africa from the nineteenth century until the Second World War, mandated sometimes by the central French government (rubber until 1920, rice during the Second World War), sometimes for profit (the cotton plantations of [[Compagnie Française d'Afrique Occidentale]] and [[Unilever]]), and sometimes on the personal whim of the local commandant, such as one official's attempt to introduce cotton into the Guinean highlands. Unlike the [[Congo Free State]], infamous for its nineteenth-century forced rubber cultivation by private fiat, the French government administration was bound legally to provide labor for its rubber concessionaires in [[French Equatorial Africa]] and settler-owned cotton plantations in [[Côte d'Ivoire]].&lt;ref&gt;Suret-Canele, pp.230-233&lt;/ref&gt;

===Native governance===
{{further information|Cercle (French colonial)}}
In addition, native sub-officials, such as the appointed local chiefs, made use of forced labor, compulsory crops, and taxes in kind at their discretion. As the enforcers of the ''indigénat'', they were also partly beneficiaries. Still, they themselves were very much subject to French authority when the French chose to exercise it.  It was only in 1924 that ''chefs du canton'' were exempted from the ''Indigénat'', and if they showed insubordination or disloyalty they could still, like all Africans, be imprisoned for as many as ten years for 'political offences' by French officials, subject to a signature of the Minister of Colonies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Crowder]]. ''Colonial West Africa: Collected Essays'', Routledge (1978) {{ISBN|0-7146-2943-X}}. pp142-143.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Courts===
[[File:Indigene court AOF 1920.jpg|thumb|right|A ''customary court'' in [[French West Africa]], c. 1920.  Note the native judges are wearing traditional French judges' hats.  A uniformed ''Guard de Cercle'' stands in the background.]]

In Africa, ''sujets'' were assigned to two separate court systems. After their creation by Governor-General [[Ernest Roume]] and Secretary General [[Martial Merlin]] during 1904, most legal matters were processed officially by the so-called ''customary courts''. These were either courts convened by village ''chefs du canton'' or some other French-recognized native authority, or else by Muslim [[Sharia]] courts. While Muslim courts had some real local relevance behind them, the French history of chief-creation was to replace traditional chiefs with Africans who would be dependent upon the French. Consequently, customary courts often served simply to increase the power of official chiefs. What was deemed customary differed from ''cercle'' to ''cercle'', with the Commandant relying upon his native sub-officials to interpret and formalize oral traditions of which the French had little knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;See Klein, pp. 132–137, 208–209, 237–240.  As the title indicates, Klein is concerned with the persistence of African slavery under French rule.  He argues that customary law and French-appointed chiefs allowed formal slavery to continue in some areas up to the 1920s, and the social relationship to survive through independence.&lt;/ref&gt; Civil cases which came to the attention of the French officials were tried by an administrator-judge in a ''tribunaux du premier degré'', for which the administrator-judge was an appointed African notable (other than local chief).

Matters deemed especially serious by the French officials, or matters for which the colonial power had any interest, were handled by a French administrator-judge. All criminal cases were handled by a ''tribunaux du premier degré'' directed by the ''chef du subdivision'' (the lowest post held by caucasians) with the assistance of two local notables and two caucasian officials, or (in practice) anyone the administrator-judge chose. These could be appealed to the ''tribunal criminal'' where the administrator-judge was the local ''Commandant du cercle'', and was not bound to heed the advice of even his own appointed assistants.&lt;ref&gt;Crowder, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond this, there was no functioning appeals process, though in theory, the colonies' governor had to sign off on all decisions which imposed punishments greater than those allowed for summary sentences. Historians examining the court records have found that governors were asked for approval after the fact, and in all but a minuscule number of cases signed off on whatever their commandants decided.&lt;ref&gt;Suret-Canale&lt;/ref&gt;

Those Africans who had obtained the status of French citizens (''[[Évolué]]'') or those born into the [[Four Communes]] of Senegal (''originaires'') were subject to a small French court system, operating under the [[Code Napoleon]] as practiced in France. The lack of an [[adversarial system]] (in French law, the judge is also the prosecutor) may have worked in France, but was hardly trusted by educated Africans.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} This may explain why French Africans' demand for access (promoted by politician [[Lamine Guèye (politician)|Lamine Guèye]]) to both local and French courts was so strong, and why so few who managed to meet the requirements of citizenship chose to pursue it, abandoning themselves to French justice.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Even ''originaires'' were not free from summary law.  During 1908, most African voters in Saint-Louis were eliminated from the rolls, and in the ''Decree of 1912'', the government said that only ''originaires'' who complied with the rigorous demands of those seeking French citizenship from the outside, would be able to exercise French rights.  Even then, ''originaires'' were subject to customary and arbitrary law if they stepped outside the Four Communes.  It was only through a protracted battle by Senegalese Deputy [[Blaise Diagne]], and his help recruiting thousands of Africans to fight in World War I, that legal and voting rights were restored to even the ''originaires'' with the [[Blaise Diagne|Loi Blaise Diagne]] of 29 September 1916.&lt;ref&gt;For Blaise Diagne, see:

===Becoming French===
see ''[[Évolué]]'' and [[Assimilation (French colonial)]]

===Resistance===
Resistance, while common, was usually indirect.  Huge population shifts occurred in France's African colonies, especially when large conscription or forced labor drives were implemented by particularly zealous officials&lt;ref&gt;Echenberg, Myron J.:  Paying the Blood Tax: Military Conscription in French West Africa, 1914–1929 in the Canadian Journal of African Studies / Revue Canadienne des Études Africaines, Vol. 9, No. 2 (1975), pp. 171-192&lt;/ref&gt; and when many African slaves were emancipated by the French authorities following French conquest.

Whole villages fled during the roadbuilding campaign during the 1920s and 30s, and colonial officials gradually relaxed the use of forced labor. Rober Delavignette (a former colonial official) documented the mass movement of some 100,000 [[Mossi people|Mossi]] people from [[French Upper Volta|Upper Volta]] to [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] to escape forced labor, while the investigative journalist [[Albert Londres]] claims the figures are closer to 600,000 ''sujets'' fleeing to Gold Coast and 2 million fleeing to [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref&gt;R.

== Le régime de l'indigénat ==

De fait, le régime d'indigénat est mis en place dès 1830 apparaît clairement comme une faveur faite aux vaincus algériens. Ces derniers ne sont pas tenus de respecter les lois françaises et ne dépendent pas de la juridiction française. Ils suivent la loi coranique et la justice est rendue selon la coutume coranique. Ceci reste valable jusqu'à l'abrogation du régime de l'indigénat en 1945. Pour être admis a la nationalité française pleine et entière, quand cela est possible, le musulman doit renoncer à suivre la loi coranique et s'engage à suivre la loi de la République. Il existait en effet de profondes différences entre les lois coraniques et le Code civil : polygamie, mariage arrangé, divorce uniquement possible pour le mari, inégalité homme/femme en matière d'héritage, notamment. Dès 1874, une liste d'infractions sanctionnables par la justice française est dressée à destination des indigènes : réunion sans autorisation ou acte irrespectueux, notamment. Dès les années 1860, le statut d'indigénat fait débat. Napoléon III qui rêvait d'un royaume arabe en Algérie était évidemment très mal considéré par les colons français. Après la chute de l'empire, la République tenta bien de simplifier les procédures de naturalisation et même d'évoquer une naturalisation en masse, mais ceci provoque de vives réactions des colons. Les autorités locales traineront d'ailleurs des pieds afin compliquer la tache aux musulmans candidats à la naturalisation française. Cette méthode porte ses fruits : entre 1865 et 1915, seulement 2396 musulmans d'Algérie sont naturalisés français. Les indigènes bénéficient du droit de vote limité. Ils participent ainsi notamment à l'élection des collèges musulmans des conseils municipaux. Ces derniers sont évidemment minoritaires au sein des conseils alors que la population musulmane est le plus souvent majoritaire au niveau démographique. Les musulmans représentent un cinquième du conseil jusqu’en 1919, puis un tiers. Après la [[Première Guerre mondiale]], la loi du 4 février 1919 réforme la procédure d'accès à la pleine nationalité. Cette réforme est décevante avec seulement 1204 musulmans d'Algérie naturalisés de 1919 à 1930. Lyautey qui suit de près les négociataions avec les colons note : « Je crois la situation incurable. Les colons agricoles français ont une mentalité de pur Boche, avec les mêmes théories sur les races inférieures destinées à être exploitées sans merci. Il n'y a chez eux ni humanité, ni intelligence. » (cité par Weil Patrick, ''Qu'est-ce qu'un Français'', Paris, Grasset, 2002, p.241)
--&gt;

==Dissolution of the Indigénat==
Some elements of the ''Indigénat'' were reformed over time.  The formal right of caucasian civilians to exercise summary punishment was eliminated by the decree of 15 November 1924.  This decree reduced the headings by which subjects could be summarily punished to 24; later this was further reduced to 12.  Maximum fines decreased from 25 francs to 15, and summary imprisonment was capped at five days. In practice, though, summary punishment continued at the discretion of local authorities. In French-controlled Cameroon, during 1935 there were 32,858 prison sentences for these 'administrative' offenses, compared to 3,512 for common law offenses.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Suret-Canele. French Colonialism in Tropical Africa 1900–1945. Trans. Pica Press (1971) p.333&lt;/ref&gt;

Head taxes had been increasing well above inflation from the First World War right through to the [[Great Depression|economic crisis of the 30s]], and reached their high point during the Second World War,&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Manning: Francophone Sub-Saharan Africa 1880–1985. Cambridge University Press (1988) pp.50-56&lt;/ref&gt; but it was decolonisation which saw a real drop in taxes paid without representation.

Gradually, the ''[[corvée]]'' system was reformed, both because of international criticism and popular resistance. In [[French West Africa]], the ''corvée'' had been formalised by the local decree of 25 November 1912. Duration and conditions varied, but as of 1926, all able-bodied men were required to work for no longer than eight days at a stint in Senegal, ten in Guinea and twelve in Soudan and Mauritania. Workers were supposed to be provided with food if working more than 5&amp;nbsp;km from home, but this was often ignored. In 1930, the [[Geneva Convention]] outlawed the ''corvée'', but France substituted a work tax (''Prestation'') by the Franch West Africa decree of 12 September 1930, whereby able-bodied men were assessed a high monetary tax, which they could pay via forced labor.

===Political moves===
It was, in fact, political processes which doomed the ''indigénat'' system.

The [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] government in the decrees of 11 March and 20 March 1937 created the first labor regulations on work contracts and the creation of trade unions, but these remained largely unenforced until the late 1940s.

The journalism of [[André Gide]] and [[Albert Londres]], the political pressure of the French left and groups like the [[League for Human Rights and Popular Aid]] put pressure on the colonial system, but it was the promises made at the [[Brazzaville Conference]] of 1944, the crucial role of the colonies for the [[Free French]] during the Second World War, and the looming [[Indochina War]] and the [[Malagasy Uprising]] which all made the new [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] reorient France to [[decolonization]]. The declaration at Brazzaville, more revolutionary for its discussion of the issue rather than any formal process, declared the "progressive suppression" of the code de l'indigénat, but only after the end of the war.

The small political representation from the colonies after the war made ending the indigénat as a primary goal, even though these men were drawn from the [[Évolué]] class of full French citizens.  The passage of the [[loi Lamine Guèye]] was the culmination of this process, and repealed the courts and labor laws of the Indigénat.

Legally, the Indigénat was dismantled in three phases. The ordinance of 7 May 1944 suppressed the summary punishment statutes, and offered citizenship to those who met certain criteria and would surrender their rights to native or Muslim courts.  This citizenship was labeled ''à titre personnel'': their (even future) children would still be subject to the Indigénat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mouvement-egalite.org/article.php?id_article=12 Le corps d’exception : questions à Sidi Mohammed Barkat] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927215956/http://www.mouvement-egalite.org/article.php?id_article=12 |date=September 27, 2007 }}, mouvement-egalite.org, 14 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  The loi Lamine Guèye of 7 April 1946 formally extended citizenship across the empire, indigènes included.  Third, the law of 20 September 1947 eliminated the two-tier court system and mandated equal access to public employment.

Applied in fact only very slowly, the abrogation of the ''code de l'indigénat'' only became real during 1962. At this date, most of the colonies had become independent and French law adopted the notion of double [[jus soli]]. Thus, any children of colonial parents born in French-ruled territory became French citizens.  All others were by then full citizens of their respective nations.

Full voting representation and full French legal, labor, and property rights were never offered to the entire sujet class. The [[Loi Cadre]] of 1956 extended more rights, including consultative 'legislatures' for the colonies within the [[French Union]].  Within three years, this was replaced by the referendum on the [[French Community]], in which colonies could vote for independence  The [[First Indochina War]] resulted in independence for the different regions of [[French Indochina]]. The [[Algerian War]] and the [[French Fifth Republic]] of 1958 resulted in independence for most of the rest of empire during the period 1959–1962. The [[Comoros]] Islands (except [[Mayotte]]) and [[Djibouti]] gained independence during the 1970s. Those parts of the empire that remained (Mayotte, [[New Caledonia]] and [[French Guiana]]) became legally parts of France, and only then was the category of French subject ended.

'''Kaba proper''' is a [[Bongo–Bagirmi language]] of [[Chad]] and the [[Central African Republic]]. It is one of several local languages that go by the names ''Kaba'' and ''Sara''.  There are three ISO codes, which ''Ethnologue'' acknowledges may be the same thing.

The '''Khatso people''', commonly known as the "[[Mongols]] in [[Yunnan]]", is a group of Mongols, mainly distributed in [[Tonghai County]] in the [[Yunnan Province]] of southwestern China. The Khatso people are descendants of the [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan]] army during the era of the [[Mongol Empire]].

Before the mid-13th century, Yunnan was held by many war-like independent states such as the [[Nanchao]] and [[Dali Kingdom]]s. The Mongol Empire under [[Möngke Khan]] conquered the Dali Kingdom in 1253.&lt;ref&gt;John Man ''Kublai Khan'', p.79&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1273, a [[Chinggisid]] prince received the viceroyalty over the area. [[Kublai Khan]] appointed the first governor, [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] Sayid Ajall, in Yunnan in 1273.&lt;ref&gt;John Man ''Kublai Khan'', p.80&lt;/ref&gt; Yunnan and [[Hunan]] were main bases for [[Mongol invasions|Mongol military operations]] to [[Indo-China]]. It was called Yunnan district with [[Kunming]] as the headquarters during the Yuan. After the expulsion of the Mongols from China in 1368, the [[Ming Dynasty]] destroyed the Yuan loyalists in Yunnan under [[Basalawarmi]] in 1381 and occupied it. In 1381, "Ming Dynasty troops routed the Yuan army by the shore of the [[Baishui River]]. The Mongol soldiers, their hopes to return to their homeland having been dashed, had no alternative but to settle down in the province."{{cn|date=October 2015}}

[[File:Xingmeng Township - P1360339.JPG|thumb|upright|Monument in Xingmeng Township, commemorating 750 years of history of Mongol people in Yunnan]]
There are about 5,400 Khatso people, whose culture is heavily influenced by the local [[Yi people|Yi culture]]. Khatso people speak the [[Katso language]] (a [[lingua franca]] of [[Yi language]] and [[Bai language]], which is also mixed with a few Mongolian words) to communicate inside the county and use [[Chinese language]] to outsiders.&lt;ref&gt;Jiang Ying, Zhao Yan-zhen etc, "New Problems for Kazhuo Young People in Their Mother Tongue Acquisition", ''Journal of Research on Education for Ethnic Minorities'', Beijing, 2008 (No.2), General No.85, Vol.19&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980s, village elders sent a delegation to [[Inner Mongolia]] to re-learn about their long lost [[Mongolian culture]]. They adopted customs similar to Mongols in the north gradually, and wrestling became their favorite sport when they saw how popular it was with other Mongols.{{cn|date=October 2015}}

'''Kurds in Sweden''' may refer to people born in or residing in the [[Sweden]] of [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] origin.

Most [[Kurdish people]] in Sweden live in the capital [[Stockholm]] or in [[Uppsala]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mobil.hd.se/skane/2012/01/08/stilla-protest-mot-massaker/|title=Stilla protest mot massaker|publisher=|accessdate=19 August 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120710102747/http://mobil.hd.se/skane/2012/01/08/stilla-protest-mot-massaker/|archivedate=10 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A majority of Kurdish political refugees choose Sweden as their host country and therefore they have a cultural presence in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.saradistribution.com/img/saradistr_press1.gif&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, 6 MPs in the Swedish parliament are of Kurdish descent. 

== Chronological Kurdish arrivals to Sweden ==

[[File:Chacalacadefresa.jpg|thumb| "Pacific demonstration" in [[Guatemala City]], on April 25, 2015 after the first corruption allegations against the Pérez Molina Administration.]]
'''''La Línea'' corruption case''' began in [[Guatemala]] on April 16, 2015, when the [[International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala]] ({{lang-es|Comisión Internacional Contra la Impunidad en Guatemala, CICIG}}) and State prosecutors accused a number of politicians in the administration of President [[Otto Pérez Molina]] of setting up a customs corruption ring with the help of high-ranking officials in the tax and customs administration. Several demonstrations ensued, calling for the resignation of Pérez Molina and his vice-president [[Roxana Baldetti]]. Among the accused were the retired captain [[Juan Carlos Monzón]],&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Baldetti resigned in early May, to the joy of thousands of demonstrators.

On 20 May 2015, the CICIG and Guatemalan Chief Prosecutor [[Thelma Aldana]] exposed another high-level corruption scandal, when they announced the Guatemalan Social Security Institute (Spanish: Instituto Guatemalteco de Seguridad Social) -IGSS investigation, which found that the board of directors plotted to award a renal facility service contract to an external company that did not comply with the minimal requirements and caused the death of numerous patients. Investigations from both entities showed that the contract had been granted by heavy bribes to some of the board members, specially IGSS President Juan de Dios Rodríguez, Pérez Molina's former private secretary. The board members were sent to prison. A few weeks later another corruption scandal broke when another of former Perez Molina's private secretaries went to jail accused of being involved in a high stakes case with energy company {{Interlanguage link multi|Jaguar Energy|es}}.

On 21 August 2015, prosecutors and the CICIG asked for the arrest of Baldetti and the impeachment of president [[Otto Pérez Molina]] for their involvement in "La Línea case".&lt;ref name=periodico21a/&gt; In a press conference, CICIG chief, Colombian prosecutor Iván Velazquez reported that during the procedures{{clarify|date=July 2016}} carried out on 16 April 2015, they discovered that the president and the vice president were the masterminds of La Linéa, not Juan Carlos Monzón. Furthermore, CICIG implied, the two might have been involved with the customs ring even before they were inaugurated on 14 January 2012.&lt;ref name=periodico21a&gt;

Events came to a climax during Baldetti's legal hearing. An intercepted phone conversation was played in which one could hear the voice of President Perez Molina asking the SAT director for personnel changes, allegedly to accommodate the smuggling network. A national strike was called after the release of that conversation. In the end, on September 1, Otto Pérez Molina was impeached and stripped of his immunity; he resigned September 2 and was in custody on the 3rd.&lt;ref name=Maldonado&gt;

== The "Sindicato" and the «Cofradía» ==

=== Moreno smuggling ring===
{{See also|Álvaro Arzú|Alfonso Portillo}}

[[File:Corte Suprema de Justicia .jpg|200px|thumb|Guatemala Supreme Court building]]

During [[Álvaro Arzú]]'s presidency (1996-2000) the smuggling ring was attacked when the National Prosecutor found evidence that implicated several high-ranking Army officers, among them general [[Luis Francisco Ortega Menaldo]], colonel Salán Sánchez, general [[Efraín Ríos Montt]], coronel Napoleón Rojas Méndez, major Byron Barrientos, and Mario Guillermo Ruiz Wong. Then-presidential candidate [[Alfonso Portillo]] was even mentioned.&lt;ref name=veliz/&gt; According to the legal proceedings that took place between 2000 and 2002, the ring controlled container transfers, import prices, and the type of merchandise that was to be moved; the ring would take control of the containers and would not release them until a hefty bribe was paid.&lt;ref name=veliz/&gt; None of these names immediately came to public light, and a middleman operator named Alfredo Moreno was accused of being the ringleader.  After Portillo's victory in the 2000 elections, the new Attorney General, Rodolfo González Rodas, dismantled the unit in charge of Moreno's case, allegedly due to the ring's connections to Portillo and Ríos Montt -leaders of Portillo's political party. Finally, in 2001, Alfredo Moreno paid a million quetzals jail bond and was released.

=== Perez Molina's presidency ===

[[File:Otto Perez Molina - Guatemala 2007 cropped.jpg|thumb|200px|Retired general [[Otto Pérez Molina]], [[president of Guatemala]] from 14 January 2012 to 3 September 2015.]]

Perez Molina was elected president in the 2011 general elections and shortly after his inauguration privatized the Empresa Portuaria Quetzal (English:Quetzal Harbor Enterprise) in [[Escuintla Department|Escuintla]], on Holy Wednesday of the first [[Holy Week processions in Guatemala|Holy Week]] under his tenure; the Holy Week is a highly respected holiday in Guatemala and his move prompted several complaints about its legality. Later, Baldetti appointed Claudia Méndez Asencio -a close friend of hers—as SAT Customs Chief. Only two months later, Perez Molina intervened in the Superintendencia de Administración Tributaria and placed military personnel in key points in customs, allegedly to increase tax collection and prevent smuggling.&lt;ref name=RodriguezP&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

When President Perez Molina took office in 2012, Vice President Baldetti Elías brought a retired general,  Luis Francisco Ortega Menaldo, to work with her in the vice president's office, thus acknowledging their close relationship. Ortega Menaldo has been considered the protégé of former president [[Carlos Manuel Arana Osorio]], since he had married Arana's daughter, and Arana and helped get Ortega to the upper ranks of military intelligence in the 1970s. Ortega Menaldo, then a captain, was trained in the Telecommunication Regional Center, a.k.a. "La Regional", during Arana's government (1970-1974). In 1980 he was appointed as chief of the newly created Department of Security and Special Investigations in the Public Finances Secretariat, which allegedly was the origin of the smuggling ring. When [[Vinicio Cerezo]] was elected president in 1985, then-Secretary of Defense, Héctor Gramajo, appointed him as chief of Military Intelligence in 1987 while general Manuel Callejas ― the "Cofradía"'s boss ― was appointed as Defense Chief of Staff. Gramajo used the criminal enterprise for support against the Army's hard-line officers many of whom worked closely with the extreme right-wing party "Movimiento de Liberación Nacional" - MLN - and thus stop coup d'état attempts against president Cerezo. With CIA help, Ortega Menaldo founded the Military Intelligence School in 1987, and worked closely with the [[DEA]].&lt;ref name=Solano22abril/&gt;

Thus, the two executive leaders ― Pérez Molina and Baldetti Elías ― bought an alliance to the main military groups that formed during the [[Guatemala Civil War]]: "Sindicato" and "Cofradía". But the presence of Luis Mendizábal ― owner of Emilio's boutique, the alleged ring headquarters ― confirmed that yet a third group also had a strong position in the government: that of retired general Marco Tulio Espinosa Contreras, an Air Force general, who raised his profile during the [[Alvaro Arzú]] presidency.&lt;ref name=Solano22abril/&gt;

Pérez Molina's government had faced with a constant fiscal deficit since 2012 and missed SAT's collection goals every single quarter; customs taxes dropped in 2013 from 15,800&amp;nbsp;million to 15,300&amp;nbsp;millon [[Quetzal (currency)|quetzals]] -Guatemalan currency, and was even lower in 2014; the same happened with sales taxes over imports. The fiscal gap in those years was as high as 7,000&amp;nbsp;millon of quetzals, which was covered by treasure bonds and international loans, increasing public debt. The financial crisis forced the Government to create new phone, cement and mining taxes to balance its budget for 2015.&lt;ref name=socialista&gt;

On September 2014, retired captain Byron Lima Oliva, who was already in prison with a 15-year sentence after being formally accused of being the material assassin of bishop [[Juan José Gerardi]], was accused by CICIG of being the one that in fact controlled the Pavoncito prison where he was committed, and practically had control of the whole Guatemalan jail system.&lt;ref name=jornada&gt;{{cite news|last=Martínez |first=Sanjuana |title=Enjuician en Guatemala a Byron Lima Oliva, el asesino del obispo Gerardi |location=Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México |newspaper=La Jornada |date=14 September 2014 |url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2014/09/14/politica/013n1pol |accessdate=30 April 2015 |language=es |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430225344/http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2014/09/14/politica/013n1pol |archivedate=April 30, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Investigations showed that Lima Oliva came and went as he pleased in armored SUVs with a police escort; when he was apprehended outside the prison and taken to the Supreme Court building to testify along with other accused, reportedly he said several times that he was a personal friend of president [[Otto Pérez Molina]]. It was not the first time he was captured outside his prison cell:  in February 2013 he was captured in a SUV outside prison.&lt;ref name=jornada/&gt; CICIG accused Lima Oliva of creating a multimillion-dollar empire by controlling the prisons and charging up to US$12,000 for selling prison transfers.&lt;ref name=jornada/&gt;

In early  April 2015, in discussions with the [[United Nations]] about extending CICIG's mandate for another two years, both Pérez Molina and Baldetti were adamant that the International Commission was no longer needed in Guatemala.&lt;ref name=Font&gt;{{cite web|last=Font |first=Juan Luis |website=Contrapoder |title=La agonía del Gobierno |accessdate=19 April 2015 |date=19 April 2015 |location=Guatemala |url=http://contrapoder.com.gt/2015/04/19/la-agonia-del-gobierno/ |language=es |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150420031156/http://contrapoder.com.gt/2015/04/19/la-agonia-del-gobierno/ |archivedate=April 20, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investigation ==
On April 16, the [[International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala]] (CICIG) accused a number of politicians within the administration of President [[Otto Pérez Molina]] of setting up a criminal network within the Tax and Customs Administration. At the time, the CICIG believed that the ''La Línea'' network was headed by Monzón Rojas (Baldetti's secretary) and Omar Franco (Chief Officer of SAT, the [[:es:Superintendencia de Administración Tributaria de Guatemala|''Superintendencia de Administración Tributaria de Guatemala'']]).&lt;ref name="Red de defraudación"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

From May 2014 to February 2015, this corruption ring handled at least 500 containers, which benefited from lower customs duties in exchange for very significant bribes, thanks to the ring's control of the customs offices at [[Puerto Quetzal]] and [[Santo Tomás de Castilla|Santo Tomás]], as well as at the central customs administration.&lt;ref name="Desmantelan"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the corruption ring, ''La Línea'' - "the (telephone) line" - came from the phone number, which any import company could call to ask for reduced customs duties. The network involved dozens of people within the tax and customs administration as well as in the [[Otto Pérez Molina]] administration itself.&lt;ref name="Desmantelan"/&gt;

=== Suspects ===

On the early morning of 16 April 2015, an operation with a total of 23&amp;nbsp;operatives with 250&amp;nbsp;Civil National Police officers, besides CICIG and public prosecutor officials, resulted in extensive information collection and 20&amp;nbsp;suspects captured, among them SAT personnel, customs agents and entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name=Gomez/&gt;

The captured suspects were:

* SAT personnel:
** Álvaro Omar Franco Chacón, SAT Chief Director;
** Sebastián Herrera Carrera, Human Resources manager;
** Anthony Segura Franco, SAT union general secretary;
** Karla Mireya Herrera España, Central Customs building manager;
** Gustavo Morales Pinzón, South division manager;
** José Rolando Gil Monterroso;
** Melvin Gudiel Alvarado, administrator; and
** Carlos Enrique Muñoz Roldán, former SAT Chief Director
* External ring:&lt;ref name=Gomez/&gt;
** Adolfo Sebastián Batz;
** Carlos Ixtuc Cuc;
** Geovanni Marroquín Navas;
** Julio César Aldana Sosa;

** Osama Ezzat Aziz Aranki;
** Byron Antonio Izquierdo;
** Francisco Javier Ortiz Arriaga;
** Julio Estuardo González de León;
** Herbert Francisco Cabrera;
** Miguel Ángel Lemus Aldana.

According to Iván Velásquez, CICIG's Chief Commissioner, the crime network had been under investigation since May 2014, when the CICIG got tips that there were connections between importers and customs officers, who found ways for the importers to pay fewer taxes. Telephone call information for "La Línea" was given to importers. "La Línea" operated mainly in the major harbors and in the central customs building.&lt;ref name=Gomez&gt;

"Eco"— voluntarily offered to testify, an offer which was initially opposed by the defense attorneys, who argued that there were three accused missing. The judge rejected their objection. González—who said that he was willing to have a face-to-face with any other accused—methodically exposed a series of data that seriously incriminated several of the accused:&lt;ref name=ecoep&gt;

On 29 September 2015 González continued testifying, and was cross-questioned by both prosecutors and defense attorneys, standing firm by his version of events and revealing more details:&lt;ref name=lahora29s&gt;

* 61% of the bribes were made in cash, while the remaining 39% was in charge of the external network.  
* González emphasized that he did not charge a penny for his services as "manager"; however, he did confess that he got 2% of the embezzled funds initially and 5% later on.
* González allegedly met former President Pérez Molina's daughter, whom he called "Lissett", daughter-in-law, "Luisa" and wife, Rosa Leal de Pérez; these women allegedly got government contracts for their company Grupo Pixel S.A..
* González was the link between SAT and Pérez Molina to keep control of "La Linea", per Juan Carlos Monzón's request.
* González kept personal and email contact with Baldetti, who was coded in his cell phones as "2" or "MyLine".
* Customs personnel were chosen by Javier Ortiz -a.k.a. "Teniente Jerez"-, and then González coordinated with SAT Human Resources manager to settle the appointments. All the appointed personnel had years of experience with customs and tax law.
* Claudia Méndez Asencio allegedly coordinated González' access to the SAT building eighth floor through a private elevator.
* While "La Linea" was operative, Pérez Molina, Baldetti Elías, Osama Aziz Aranki, Javier Ortiz —a.k.a. "Teniente Jerez"— and Juan Carlos Monzón all used cutting edge technology in untraceable phones.
* González used the same kind of phones to work at ''Siglo 21'', a newspaper that he controlled at the time.&lt;ref name=lahora29s/&gt;

González explained in detail how Roxana Baldetti's front companies worked, a version that remained unaltered across the lengthy questioning of lawyers and procesutors: González was hired to manage seven companies. Other companies controlled by Víctor Hugo Hernández, Juan Carlos Monzón's trusted employee. González explained that his job was to make sure that all these front companies had offices that reflected the capital that they allegedly had and the services that they were supposed to offer; he also looked for mock stockholders and board members that fit the profile for the supposed type of companies.&lt;ref name=elp30s&gt;

PROINVER was officially registered under Baldetti's name. González said that he did not control it, but that he cooperated with making projections for PROINVER's dividends, projections the corporation met, quarter after quarter. Baldetti was allegedly always on top of everything, setting up meetings with González and Hernández at the headquarters of her front companies.&lt;ref name=elp30s/&gt; Guatemalan newspaper ''Prensa Libre'' researched several of these companies and found the following:

{{quote box|align=center|width=80%|"The companies revealed by "Eco" [González] are: Publihaces, Publimerc, Corporación Urma, La Montaña Ecológica, Representaciones Alliancee, SA., Grupo Agro Industrial 2011, S.A. and Serpumer, S.A.  Of them, ''Prensa Libre'' found for in the government records.&lt;br /&gt;
González Álvarez said that he made forecasts and projections of what the companies should falsely report as profits every quarter, thus making Baldetti's economic profile believable.

The first capital injection occurred on 23 August 2013, when Herbert Arturo Jacobo Dubón, Grupo Agro Industrial 2011, S.A. president of the board, added capital for Q50 million. The company had been opened on 2 June 2011 with an initial capital of just Q5,000.

The second capital injection occurred on 10 April 2015, and it was for Representaciones Alliancee, S.A., whose Q5,000 initial capital increased to Q18 million.  The company was opened on 20 December 2006.  Since then, this company has purchased real estate linked to Baldetti and her family, among them a warehouse next to [[La Aurora International Airport]].

[...] The four companies that ''Prensa Libre'' found share attorneys, board members and addresses and are all located at Avenida La Reforma 1-50, El Reformador building, fifth floor, zone 9 de la [[Ciudad de Guatemala]].|''Prensa Libre''&lt;br /&gt;30 September 2015&lt;ref name=pl68&gt;

After "La Linea" was discovered on 16 April 2015, both Perez Molina's political party and Government began to break down. On Sunday 19 April 2015, Partido Patriota founder and presidential candidate [[Alejandro Sinibaldi]] quit the party along with tenths of majors and about 20 congress members, and it was speculated that he could run for a different party.&lt;ref name=RodriguezP/&gt; His reasons for quitting, according to Sinibaldi, were:

* The two contracts granted to Israeli company M Tarcic Engineering Ltd. for 137.8&amp;nbsp;million quetzals to "clean" [[Lake Amatitlán]].&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;{{cite news|last=Rodríguez |first=Manuel |title=Baldetti suspende plan para "limpiar" lago de Amatitlán |newspaper=Diario La Hora |location=Guatemala |language=es |date=30 March 2015 |accessdate=23 April 2015 |url=http://lahora.gt/baldetti-suspende-plan-para-limpiar-lago-de-amatitlan/ |quote=In early 2015, the Lake Amatitlan Authority commission granted in to exceptional events a contract to the Israeli company M.

However, after complains and legal actions from scientists, academia, politicians and environmentalists who all questioned the Israeli company contract, then-vicepresident Baldetti suspended the project on 30 March 2015, freezing both the payment to the company and any decontaminant pouring into the lake. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423211047/http://lahora.gt/baldetti-suspende-plan-para-limpiar-lago-de-amatitlan/ |archivedate=April 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "La Linea" case
* The hospital crisis that the country is submerged in
* The ill-advised interventions of the country's customs.&lt;ref name=Pos/&gt;

That afternoon Baldetti, freshly returned from South Korea, said in a press conference said that she was sorry to hear what had happened with Sinibaldi and that he and she ad always had some differences, but that she did not know how upset he was with her.&lt;ref name=Periodico19&gt;

At the same press conference, Baldetti emphasized that she was not part of the millionaire fraudulent ring;&lt;ref name=Periodico19/&gt; she showed videos from earlier in the year in which she was shown saying that the offices under her in the Government were already investigating structures like La Linea, at a time when Juan Carlos Monzón was her closest advisor. According to Baldetti, this was the first time that they had traveled abroad together and that it was her who told her now-former private secretary about the investigation against him and asked him to resign. Upset and bombarded with journalists' questions about her whereabouts which had been unknown for 48 hours, she turned around and left her own press conference.&lt;ref name=Periodico19/&gt;

In July 2015, after the Jaguar Energy scandal arrests, the alleged involvement of several members of Congress in bribes and money laundering, and presenting a detailed report on how the Guatemalan political parties' financing works—mostly related to illicit activitivies—CICIG demanded the Guatemalan Supreme Court take action. However, on 28 July 2015, the Supreme Court issued a statement in denounced the International Commission demands. In response, Guatemalan newspaper ''[[Diario La Hora]]'' reveals that the thirteen judges of the Supreme Court were designated thanks to the alliance between the official [[Partido Patriota]] and the main opposition party, [[Libertad Democrática Renovada]]. LIDER, a party that was almost positive that it was going to win the 2015 presidential elections.&lt;ref name=lahora28julio/&gt;

'''Largest Human Flag of India'''  was an event organised to form the world's largest human national flag in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. It was organised on 7 December 2014 by Rotary International in India with a slogan '''Rotary My Flag My India'''. More than 50,000 Indians gathered in YMCA Grounds, [[Chennai]] to form the world's largest human national flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tuesday, Dec 09, 2014 |url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/141207/nation-current-affairs/article/india-set-new-world-record-largest-human-flag |title=India set new world record for largest human flag |publisher=Deccanchronicle.com |date= |accessdate=2014-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''1999 Los Angeles Jewish Community Center shooting''' occurred on August 10, 1999, at around 10:50&amp;nbsp;a.m. [[Pacific Time Zone|PT]], when [[White supremacy|white supremacist]] Buford O. Furrow, Jr.  walked into the lobby of the North Valley Jewish Community Center in [[Granada Hills, Los Angeles, California|Granada Hills]] and opened fire with a [[semi-automatic pistol|semi-automatic]] weapon, firing 70 shots into the complex. The gunfire wounded five people: three children, a teenage counselor, and an office worker. Shortly thereafter, Furrow murdered a [[mail carrier]], fled the state, and finally surrendered to authorities.

==History==
Buford O'Neal Furrow, Jr. (born November 25, 1961) grew up in [[Lacey, Washington]] and graduated from [[Western Washington University]] in 1986 with a degree in engineering. During the 1980s, Furrow worked for [[Boeing]] and [[Northrop Grumman]]. In the 1990s, Furrow became involved with white supremacist [[Richard Girnt Butler]]'s movement and was part of the security detail at Butler's [[Hayden Lake, Idaho]] compound.&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Danny W.|title=The Phinehas Priesthood: Violent Vanguard of the Christian Identity Movement|date=2010|publisher=Praeger Security International|isbn=0313365369|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; Months prior to the shooting, Buford O. Furrow had been treated for mental illness while in the custody of the state of Washington.&lt;ref&gt;[[New York Times]], August 14, 1999 [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9804EEDD1339F937A2575BC0A96F958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all "Racist Shootings Test Limits Of Health System, and Laws"]&lt;/ref&gt;

He reportedly spent some time living with Debbie Mathews (the widow of [[Robert Jay Mathews]], the deceased neo-Nazi terrorist who founded [[The Order (white supremacist group)|The Order]]) whom he had met at the [[Aryan Nations]] headquarters in Idaho.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adl.org/backgrounders/an_phineas.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
On August 7, Furrow bought a used red Chevrolet van in [[Tacoma, Washington]] and loaded it with five [[rifle]]s, two pistols, 6,000 rounds of ammunition and a flak jacket.  Furrow considered attacking three Jewish institutions: the [[Skirball Cultural Center]], the [[American Jewish University]] and the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]]'s Museum of Tolerance, but security measures presented too much of a problem.&lt;ref name=time1&gt;"The Kids Got In The Way: All the warning signs were there, but still Buford Furrow got his hands on guns and went on a rampage." ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''. 154.8.

August 23, 1999. p32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furrow proceeded to drive again from [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] to the [[San Fernando Valley]] with the stated purpose of "killing Jews".  Three days later, Furrow  pulled off the freeway into the Granada Hills area of Los Angeles and made his way to the North Valley Jewish Community Center just before 11 a.m.  There were about 250 children playing outside&lt;ref name=SeattleTimes1&gt;"Suspect in L.A. Shootings Surrenders in Las Vegas -- He may be charged in second gun attack." ''[[The Seattle Times]]''. August 11, 1999. pA1.&lt;/ref&gt; when Furrow walked into the lobby carrying an [[Uzi]]-type [[submachine-gun]].&lt;ref&gt;"Separatist in fed court." ''[[United Press International]]''. August 31, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  He opened fire, spraying bullets from right to left, leaving smoke and more than 70 casings on the ground.  When he was done, a receptionist, a camp counselor and three boys were wounded.&lt;ref name=time1/&gt;

Furrow fled the scene in his van.  Twenty minutes later, he carjacked a woman's Toyota at gunpoint, left the van behind, and then dumped the Toyota at a Chatsworth motel.&lt;ref name=SeattleTimes1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Birm&gt;: "Manhunt; Police on suspect's trail after children are gunned down in school." ''[[Birmingham Mail|Birmingham Evening Mail]]''. August 11, 1999. p13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The shootings ended with the death of USPS postal worker Joseph Santos Ileto (born March 19, 1960) in [[Chatsworth, Los Angeles, California|Chatsworth]], a few miles away from the center. Ileto had just delivered mail to a home and was returning to his postal truck when Furrow asked Ileto to mail a letter for him.  As Ileto agreed, Furrow pulled out a [[Glock]] [[9mm]] handgun&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, Henry. "Slain Postman's Mother Can Sue Weapon Makers." ''Los Angeles Times'' 29 May 2004: B1.&lt;/ref&gt; and shot Ileto nine times.  Later, Furrow would confess that he murdered Ileto because he thought Ileto was Latino or Asian (Ileto was [[Filipino American]]), and because Ileto was a federal employee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apalc.org/iletoevent/iletomurder.php The Asian Pacific American Legal Center of Southern California].

Police found Furrow's abandoned van, where they discovered a cache of ammunition, rifle magazines, [[bulletproof vest]]s, homemade explosives, a Ranger Handbook, and freeze-dried food.  Two books by [[Richard Kelly Hoskins]], a Lynchburg, Virginia, leader of the [[Christian Identity]] movement were also found; a copy of the book ''War Cycles, Peace Cycles'',&lt;ref name=SeattleTimes1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Birm/&gt; and ''Vigilantes of Christendom: The Story of the [[Phineas Priesthood]]'', a book which according to the [[Anti-Defamation League]] justifies [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] and [[racism|racist]] acts of violence.&lt;ref&gt;Seper, Jerry. (August 13, 1999). "Close eye kept on U.S. hate groups: Monitors had large file on suspect." ''[[The Washington Times]]''. p12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furrow fled 275-miles in an $800 taxi ride from [[Los Angeles, California]] to [[Las Vegas, Nevada]],&lt;ref name=Newsweek1/&gt; ending the manhunt by walking into an FBI office to confess, saying "You're looking for me, I killed the kids in Los Angeles."  Furrow also stated that he wanted his shooting to be "a wakeup call to America to kill Jews."&lt;ref&gt;"Shooting suspect gives up White supremacist held in L.A. attack." ''[[The Florida Times-Union]]''. August 11, 1999. pA-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victims==
The injured included a 5-year-old boy, Benjamin Kadish, who was hit in the abdomen and leg, losing 50 percent of his blood; two 6-year-old boys, Joshua Stepakoff and James Zidell, a 16-year-old girl, Mindy Finkelstein, who was hit in her right thigh and shin; and 68-year-old receptionist Isabelle Shalometh, who was grazed on the arm and back.&lt;ref name=SeattleTimes1/&gt;

Joseph Ileto died of multiple gunshot wounds to the chest and one to the back of the head.  He was found dead in a driveway.&lt;ref name=CNN3/&gt; At Ileto's funeral, messages of condolence from numerous politicians were read by Congressman Brad Sherman.&lt;ref name=CNN4&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9908/15/california.shooting.01/index.html|date=August 15, 1999|title=Postal worker Joseph Ileto mourned as President Clinton sends condolences|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the five people injured in the shooting at the Community Center, all eventually recovered.&lt;ref name=CNN1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/LAW/01/24/furrow.plea.crim/|date=January 24, 2001|title=Furrow pleads guilty to shootings, will avoid death penalty, get life without parole|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benjamin Kadish, the 5-year-old boy, was the most seriously injured victim. Upon arriving at the Providence Holy Cross Medical Center, "He had no blood pressure, no pulse, so that would put you at the most critical condition you could possibly be in," according to the emergency room physician, but Kadish was eventually stabilized after six hours of surgery. Kadish was released from hospital on September 23, 1999, approximately one month after the shooting.&lt;ref name=CNN2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9909/23/jcc.shooting.victim.01/index.html|date=September 23, 1999|title=Boy who almost died in L.A. shooting goes home |publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
The shooting prompted a national movement, the Million Mom March, which culminated in dozens of marches across the U.S. on Mother's Day 2000, calling for common sense gun policy. The Southern California Regional Million Mom March, which was held at the birthplace of Los Angeles - Olvera Street - brought more than 10,000 "mothers and others" from five counties together demanding change and protection for children against gun violence. Marches were held in major cities, including the main March in Washington, D.C.

In 2004, on the fifth anniversary of the shootings, families of the victims and local officials called for stricter gun control and hate crime legislation.  Ismael Ileto, Joseph's brother, said: "We miss him very much ... and we cannot understand why someone would take the life of my brother. He was just doing his job when he was killed."&lt;ref name=hate1/&gt;   Ileto was honored by having a post office in [[Chino Hills, California]] named for him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://asianweek.com/2000_04_27/feature_topnewshistory.html AsianWeek: Main Feature: From News to History-Stories from the Pages of AsianWeek&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224171451/http://asianweek.com/2000_04_27/feature_topnewshistory.html |date=2007-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sentencing of Furrow==
Initially, Furrow pleaded not guilty to a federal charge of murder in killing Ileto and state charges of attempted murder for shooting the five people in the Jewish center, although he reportedly confessed to the shootings in interviews with detectives.&lt;ref name=CNN4/&gt;

Prosecutors in the case, who said Furrow admitted to his crimes stating they were motivated by racial hatred, promised to seek the death penalty if the case went to trial, which led to a lengthy legal battle with Furrow's defense team. The case was further complicated by defense claims that Furrow suffered from serious psychiatric problems.&lt;ref name=CTV1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1025815438621_21224638/|date=Jan 24, 2001|title=Hate killer enters guilty plea, avoids death penalty|publisher=CTV News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 24, 2001 Furrow pleaded guilty to all of the 16 felony counts against him (which include a  murder charge for the shooting of Ileto, six counts of civil rights violations and nine weapons charges). In exchange for pleading guilty, Furrow avoided a possible death sentence, but instead agreed to be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. According to the indictment, Furrow expressed no regrets for any of his crimes.&lt;ref name=CNN1/&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN5/&gt;

On March 26, 2001, at his sentencing hearing, Furrow was sentenced to two consecutive life terms, plus 110 additional years, without the possibility of parole and was ordered to pay $690,294.11 in restitution to victims' families and insurance companies. [[United States District Court]] Judge [[Nora Margaret Manella|Nora Manella]] excoriated Furrow during the proceeding, saying, "Your actions were a stark and brutal reminder that bigotry is alive, if not well."&lt;ref name=CNN5&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/LAW/03/26/buford.furrow/index.html|date=March 26, 2001|title=Jewish Center gunman gets 2 life sentences|publisher=CNN|author=Dree DeClamecy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 11, 2013, Miranda allegedly met LaFerrara at the [[Susquehanna Valley Mall]] parking lot in [[Hummels Wharf, Pennsylvania]]. After settling on payment, Miranda and LaFerrara then drove six miles to [[Sunbury, Pennsylvania|Sunbury]], a small city located about 100 miles northwest of [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Newlyweds Elytte And Miranda Barbour Killed A Man For Fun, Police Say|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/07/elytte-barbour-miranda-barbour-thrill-kill-newlyweds_n_4403626.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elytte Barbour told police that he hid under a blanket in the backseat waiting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://alaska-native-news.com/national_news/10141-former-north-pole-resident-says-she-killed-more-than-22-people-in-last-six-years.html |title=Former North Pole Resident Says She Killed More than 22 People in Last Six Years |publisher=Alaska Native News-News for the People of the Last Frontier |date=2014-02-18 |accessdate=2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; After she allowed LaFerrara into her vehicle, Miranda signaled to Elytte, who jumped out and wrapped a cord around LaFerrara's neck as Miranda stabbed him 20 times in their [[Honda CR-V]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=US newlyweds arrested after Craigslist murder|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10503632/US-newlyweds-arrested-after-Craigslist-murder.html|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=December 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; LaFerrara's body was discovered the next day, November 12, 2013, in a residential backyard in [[Sunbury, Pennsylvania|Sunbury]].

Police said after Miranda and Elytte dumped LaFerrara's body, the couple then bought bleach wipes, towels, and cleaning liquid to remove the blood from inside the vehicle and then went to dinner. According to the arrest [[affidavit]], Elytte said the couple killed LaFerrara because they just wanted to murder someone together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pennsylvania newlyweds just wanted to murder someone together: police|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/07/us-usa-crime-pennsylvania-idUSBRE9B605720131207|newspaper=Reuters|date=December 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to police, the Barbours initially denied even knowing LaFerrara, but police traced the last call from LaFerrara's phone to Miranda’s phone. As the investigation developed, the couple's stories allegedly changed from Miranda’s story of [[self-defense]] to a mutual confession to premeditated murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Van Olson|first=Cora|title=Police: Young 'couple just wanted to murder someone together'|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/blog/2013/12/11/police-young-couple-just-wanted-to-murder-someone-together/index.html|work=CrimeLibrary|accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The killing allegedly was a [[thrill killing]], timed for three weeks after the couple's wedding, police have said.

Miranda Barbour, 19, and Elytte Barbour, 22, had previously pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder charges that carried a possible [[capital punishment in the United States|death penalty]] upon conviction. They changed their pleas to guilty of [[second-degree murder]] at what was to have been a routine status conference in Northumberland County Court in Sunbury.

The use of terms and images referring to [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]/[[First Nations]] as the name or [[mascot]] for a sports team is a topic of public controversy in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. Since the 1960s, as part of the [[Native American civil rights|indigenous civil rights movements]], there have been a number of protests and other actions by Native Americans and their supporters. The protests target the prominent use of such names and images by professional franchises such as the [[Cleveland Indians]] (in particular their "[[Chief Wahoo]]" logo); and the [[Washington Redskins]] (the term "[[Redskin (slang)|redskin]]s" being defined in most American English dictionaries as "derogatory slang"). The year 2017 was marked by numerous professional sports player protests during the national anthem against racism and police brutality. As a result, criticism of the stereotyping of Native Americans as mascots also increased, including the decision to have the Washington Redskins host a game on Thanksgiving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0027-8378| last = Zirin| first = Dave| title = By Having the Washington R*dskins Host a Game on Thanksgiving, NFL Owners Show Their True Colors| magazine = The Nation| accessdate = November 24, 2017| date = November 17, 2017| url = https://www.thenation.com/article/by-having-the-washington-rdskins-host-a-game-on-thanksgiving-nfl-owners-show-their-true-colors/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes, such as the retirement of Native American names and mascots in a wide array of schools, have been made since the 1970s.

The issue is often discussed in the media only in terms of the offensiveness of certain terms, images, and performances to individuals of Native American heritage, which tends to reduce the problem to one of feelings and personal opinions. This prevents a fuller understanding of the history and context of the use of Native American names and images, and the reasons why sports teams should eliminate the utilization of such terms.&lt;ref name="King.2010"&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Native_American_Mascot_Controversy.html?id=GApQrXWeGLwC| editor=C.

Richard King| publisher=Scarecrow Press| location=Lanham, Maryland| year=2010| isbn=978-0-8108-6731-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social science research says that sports mascots and images, rather than being mere entertainment, are important symbols with deeper psychological and social effects.&lt;ref name="Freyberg.2008"&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Stephanie Fryberg|Stephanie A.

Defenders of the current usage often state their intention to honor Native Americans by referring to positive traits, such as fighting spirit and being aggressive, brave, stoic, dedicated, and proud; while opponents see these traits as being based upon stereotypes of Native Americans as savages.&lt;ref name="Davis.2010"&gt;{{cite journal| issn = 1068-3844| volume = 9| issue = 4| pages = 11–14| last = Davis| first = Laurel R.| title = The problems with Native American mascots| journal = Multicultural Education| accessdate = October 10, 2017|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ649928}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the social sciences recognize that all stereotypes, whether positive or negative, are harmful because they promote false or misleading associations between a group and an attribute, fostering a disrespectful relationship. The injustice of such stereotypes is recognized with regard to other racial or ethnic groups, thus mascots are morally questionable regardless of offense being taken by individuals.&lt;ref name="Morris.2015"&gt;{{cite journal| author=S.P. Morris| date=2015| title=The Trouble with Mascots| journal=Journal of the Philosophy of Sport| volume=42| issue=2| pages=287–297| doi=10.1080/00948705.2014.997740| url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00948705.2014.997740}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defenders of the [[status quo]] also state that the issue is not important, being only about sports, and that the opposition is nothing more than "[[political correctness]]", which change advocates argue ignores the extensive evidence of harmful effects of stereotypes and bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Native_American_Mascot_Controversy.html?id=GApQrXWeGLwC|editor=C.

Munson|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, Maryland|year=2010|isbn=978-0-8108-6731-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there has been a steady decline in the number of teams doing so, Native American images and nicknames nevertheless remain fairly common in American and Canadian sports, and may be found in use at all levels, from youth teams to professional sports franchises.

==History==
[[European American]]s have had a history of "playing Indian" that dates back to the [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial period]]. In the 19th century, fraternal organizations such as the [[Tammanies|Tammany Societies]] and the [[Improved Order of Red Men]] adopted the words and material culture of Native Americans in part to establish an aboriginal identity, while ignoring the dispossession and conquest of indigenous peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Deloria| first=Philip J.| year=1998| title=[[Playing Indian]]| location=New Haven| publisher=Yale University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://yalebooks.com/book/9780300080674/playing-indian| title=Playing Indian| publisher=Yale University Press| accessdate=January 6, 2016| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630090119/http://yalebooks.com/book/9780300080674/playing-indian| archivedate=June 30, 2016| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice spread to youth groups such as the [[Boy Scouts of America]] (BSA) (in particular, the [[Order of the Arrow]]) and many summer camps. University students in the late 19th and early 20th centuries adopted Indian names and symbols for their sports teams, not from authentic sources but rather as Native American life was imagined by European Americans.&lt;ref name="Spindel"&gt;{{cite book|last=Spindel|first=Carol|year=2002|title=Dancing at Halftime: Sports and the Controversy Over American Indian Mascots|location=New York|publisher=New York University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Dancing_at_Halftime.html?id=4p62ket04PgC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional team nicknames had similar origins. In professional baseball the team that is now the [[Atlanta Braves]] was founded as the Boston Red Stockings in 1871; becoming the [[History of the Boston Braves|Boston Braves]] in 1912. Their owner at that time, [[James E. Gaffney|James Gaffney]], was a member of New York City's political machine, [[Tammany Hall]], one of the societies formed to honor [[Tamanend]], a chief of the [[Lenape|Delaware]]. The team that moved to become the [[Washington Redskins]] in 1937 was originally also known as the Boston Braves since the [[American football|football]] and baseball teams played at [[Braves Field]]. After moving to [[Fenway Park]], home of the [[Boston Red Sox]], the team name was changed to the Boston Redskins in 1933, using a "red" identifier while retaining the Braves "Indian Head" logo. While defenders of the Redskins often cite coach [[William Henry Dietz]], who claimed Native American heritage, to justify the name; the use of Native American names and imagery by this [[National Football League|NFL]] team began in 1932 before hiring Dietz in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nfl/wasbos/bosskins.html|title=The Boston Redskins|accessdate=2013-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cleveland Indians]]' name originated from a request by club owner [[Charles Somers]] to baseball writers to choose a new name to replace the "Naps" following the departure of their star player [[Nap Lajoie]] after the 1914 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Baseball writers select "Indians" as the best name to apply to the former Naps |url= |newspaper=The Plain Dealer |location=Cleveland, Ohio |date=January 17, 1915 |access-date= |quote=With the going of Nap Lajoie to the Athletics, a new name had to be selected for the Cleveland American league club. President Somers invited the Cleveland baseball writers to make the selection. The title of Indians was their choice, it having been one of the names applied to the old National league club of Cleveland many years ago.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Indians" was chosen as it was one of the nicknames previously applied to the old [[Cleveland Spiders]] baseball club during the time when [[Louis Sockalexis]], a member of the [[Penobscot]] tribe of Maine, played for Cleveland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Looking Backwards |url= |newspaper=The Plain Dealer |location=Cleveland, Ohio |date=January 18, 1915}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the Boston Braves in the [[1914 World Series]] may have been another reason for adopting an Indian mascot. The story that the team is named to honor Sockalexis, as the first Native American to play [[Major League Baseball]], cannot be verified from historical documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=An Act of Honor or Exploitation? The Cleveland Indians' Use of the Louis Francis Sockalexis Story|first=Ellen|last=Staurowsky|journal=Sociology of Sports Journal|date=December 1998|volume=15 | issue = 4|page=299| url=https://doi.org/10.1123/ssj.15.4.299| accessdate=November 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The news stories published to announce the selection in 1915 make no mention of Sockalexis, but do make many racist and insulting references to Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://mlb.nbcsports.com/2014/03/18/the-cleveland-indians-louis-sockalexis-and-the-name/| title=The Cleveland Indians, Louis Sockalexis, and The Name| first=Joe| last=Posnanski| date=March 18, 2014| publisher=NBC Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stereotyping of Native Americans must be understood in the context of history which includes conquest, forced relocation, and organized efforts to eradicate native cultures, such as the [[Native American boarding schools|boarding schools]] of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which separated young Native Americans from their families in order to educate them as European Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/pi/oema/resources/policy/mascots-justif.pdf|title=APA Resolution Justifications|year=2005|publisher=American Psychological Association|accessdate=2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; As stated in an editorial by Carter Meland ([[Anishinaabe]] heritage) and David E. Wilkins ([[Lumbee]]) both professors of [[Native American studies|American Indian Studies]] at the [[University of Minnesota]]: "Since the first Europeans made landfall in North America, native peoples have suffered under a weltering array of stereotypes, misconceptions and caricatures. Whether portrayed as ''[[noble savage]]s'', ''[[Stereotypes about indigenous peoples of North America|ignoble savages]]'', ''teary-eyed [[Environmentalism|environmentalists]]'' or, most recently, simply as ''casino-rich'', native peoples find their efforts to be treated with a measure of respect and integrity undermined by images that flatten complex tribal, historical and personal experience into one-dimensional representations that tells us more about the depicters than about the depicted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Star Tribune|title=Stereotypes in sports, chaos in federal policy|author=Carter Meland and David E.

In the 1940s, the [[National Congress of American Indians]] (NCAI) created a campaign to eliminate negative stereotyping of Native American people in the media. Over time, the campaign began to focus on Indian names and mascots in sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hylton|first=J Gordon|title=BEFORE THE REDSKINS WERE THE REDSKINS: THE USE OF NATIVE AMERICAN TEAM NAMES IN THE FORMATIVE ERA OF AMERICAN SPORTS, 1857–1933|publisher=North Dakota law review|date=2010-01-01|volume=86|page=879| url=https://law.und.edu/_files/docs/ndlr/pdf/issues/86/4/86ndlr879.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NCAI maintains that teams with mascots such as the [[Braves]] and the [[Redskin (slang)|Redskin]]s perpetuate negative stereotypes of Native American people, and demean their native traditions and rituals: "Often citing a long held myth by non-Native people that "Indian" mascots "honor Native people," American sports businesses such as the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s [[Washington Redskins|Washington 'Redskins']] and [[Kansas City Chiefs|Kansas City 'Chiefs']], [[Major League Baseball|MLB]]'s [[Cleveland Indians|Cleveland 'Indians']] and [[Atlanta Braves|Atlanta 'Braves']], and the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]'s [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]], continue to profit from harmful stereotypes originated during a time when white superiority and segregation were commonplace."&lt;ref name="NCAI.2013"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ncai.org/resources/ncai_publications/ending-the-legacy-of-racism-in-sports-the-era-of-harmful-indian-sports-mascots| title=Ending the Legacy of Racism in Sports &amp; the Era of Harmful Indian Sports Mascots| accessdate=October 10, 2017| publisher=NCAI}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Policy Paper| url=http://www.ncai.org/attachments/policypaper_mijapmouwdbjqftjayzqwlqldrwzvsyfakbwthpmatcoroyolpn_ncai_harmful_mascots_report_ending_the_legacy_of_racism_10_2013.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Native mascots are also part of the larger issues of [[cultural appropriation]] and the violation of [[indigenous intellectual property]] rights, which includes all instances where non-natives use indigenous music, art, costumes, etc. in entertainment and commerce. It has been argued that harm to Native Americans occurs because the appropriation of Native culture by the majority society continues the systems of dominance and subordination that have been used to colonize, assimilate, and oppress indigenous groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Riley| first=Angela| title=Straight Stealing: Towards an Indigenous System of Cultural Property Protection| journal=Washington Law Review| volume=80| issue=69| date=2005| ssrn=703283}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some see the use of caricatures of Native Americans as sports mascots as contributing to their political and economic [[Social exclusion|marginalization]]. Where other minorities would be consulted, decisions impacting Native Americans, such as building the [[Dakota Access Pipeline]], are made while excluding Native concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/beyond-standing-rock-the-native-american-economic_us_58b6e21de4b0e5fdf619792b| author=Dedrick Asante-Muhammad| title=Beyond Standing Rock: The Native American Economic Experience| quote=The U.S. has gained far too much from the marginalization of Native Americans| date=March 1, 2017| publisher=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another incident cited as indicative of the misunderstanding of Native American legal status because of stereotyping is the [[Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl|Baby Veronica case]], in which a child was adopted by a white family without the consent of her father, and enrolled member of the [[Cherokee Nation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/the-washington-redhawks-culture-jam/| title=The Washington Redhawks Culture Jam: Jacqueline Keeler joins the show to talk native mascotry| host=Dave Zirin| publisher=The Nation| accessdate=December 20, 2017| date=December 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all Native Americans are united in total opposition to mascots. Steven Denson, director of diversity for [[Southern Methodist University]] and member of the [[Chickasaw]] nation, while not issuing a blanket endorsement, has nevertheless stated that there are acceptable ways to use Native American mascots if it is done in a respectful and tasteful manner. He states: "I believe it is acceptable if used in a way that fosters understanding and increased positive awareness of the Native-American culture. And it must also be done with the support of the Native-American community. There is a way to achieve a partnership that works together to achieve mutually beneficial goals."&lt;ref name="SMU"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/153383/nativeamerican_nicknamesmascots/index.html| title=Native-American Nicknames/Mascots|publisher=Red Orbit| date=June 2, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NCAI recognized the right of individual tribes to established relationships with teams which allowed them to retain their names.&lt;ref name="NCAI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncai.org/policy-issues/community-and-culture/anti-defamation-mascots|title=Anti-Defamation and Mascots|publisher=National Congress of American Indians|accessdate=12 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social sciences and education===

The harm done by the use of Native American mascots, particularly in an academic context, was stated by the Society of Indian Psychologists in 1999:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Stereotypical and historically inaccurate images of Indians in general interfere with learning about them by creating, supporting and maintaining oversimplified and inaccurate views of indigenous peoples and their cultures. When stereotypical representations are taken as factual information, they contribute to the development of cultural biases and prejudices, (clearly a contradiction to the educational mission of the University.) In the same vein, we believe that continuation of the use of Indians as symbols and mascots is incongruous with the philosophy espoused by many Americans as promoting inclusivity and diversity.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aiansip.org/uploads/SIP_Indian_Mascot_Position_Statement.pdf| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031052230/http://aiansip.org/uploads/SIP_Indian_Mascot_Position_Statement.pdf| archive-date=October 31, 2015|title=Society of Indian Psychologists|date=January 27, 1999|accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sports mascots have been cited as an example of [[Microaggression theory|microaggressions]], the everyday insults that members of marginalized minority groups are subject to in the comments and actions of other groups in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Microaggressions and Marginality: Manifestation, Dynamics, and Impact| author=Derald Wing Sue| publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons| date=2010| page=384| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7WZxpPnnjzkC&amp;pg=PA114&amp;lpg=PA114&amp;dq=sports+mascot+microaggression&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YeoTsr0Vy-&amp;sig=nl35tZtC0zkDMsBstdFa5ut4YiY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAmoVChMIrq2r2pqJxwIVAvMeCh2STAyE#v=onepage&amp;q=sports%20mascot%20microaggression&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) issued a resolution "Recommending the Immediate Retirement of American Indian Mascots, Symbols, Images, and Personalities by Schools, Colleges, Universities, Athletic Teams, and Organizations" due to the harm done by creating a hostile environment, the negative impact on the self-esteem of American Indian children, and discrimination that may violate civil rights. It also impacts non-natives by reinforcing mainstream stereotypes, preventing learning about Native American culture. The APA states that stereotyping is disrespectful of the beliefs, traditions and values of Native Americans.&lt;ref name=APA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/pi/oema/resources/indian-mascots.aspx|title=Summary of the Resolution Recommending Retirement of American Indian Mascots|publisher=American Psychological Association|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar resolutions have been adopted by the North American Society for the Sociology of Sport,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nasss.org/nasss-native-american-imagery-resolution/| title=NASSS Native American Imagery Resolution| date=October 28, 2005| publisher=North American Society for the Sociology of Sport| accessdate=February 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[American Sociological Association]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asanet.org/about/Council_Statements/use_of_native_american_nicknames_logos_and_mascots.cfm |title=Statement by the Council of the American Sociological Association on Discontinuing the Use of Native American Nicknames, Logos and Mascots in Sport |publisher=American Sociological Association |date=March 6, 2007 |accessdate=2013-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221184942/http://asanet.org/about/Council_Statements/use_of_native_american_nicknames_logos_and_mascots.cfm |archivedate=February 21, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[American Counseling Association]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.counseling.org/docs/resolutions/resolutions-2001-present.pdf?sfvrsn=2 |publisher=American Counseling Association |title=Opposition to Use of Stereotypical Native American Images as Sports Symbols and Mascots |year=2001 |accessdate=2013-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130915125336/http://counseling.org/docs/resolutions/resolutions-2001-present.pdf?sfvrsn=2 |archivedate=2013-09-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[American Anthropological Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/rdcms-aaa/files/production/public/FileDownloads/pdfs/issues/press/upload/Sports-Mascot-Resolution-Release-Final.pdf |title=AAA Calls on Sports Organizations to Denounce Inappropriate American Indian Mascots |date=March 25, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161204135245/http://s3.amazonaws.com/rdcms-aaa/files/production/public/FileDownloads/pdfs/issues/press/upload/Sports-Mascot-Resolution-Release-Final.pdf |archivedate=December 4, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2005 report on the status of Native American students, the [[National Education Association]] included the elimination of Indian mascots and sports team names as one of its recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A Report on the Status of American Indians and Alaska Natives in Education|first=|author=Trujillo, Octaviana (Ph.D.)|author2=Alston, Denise (Ph.D.)|year=2005|publisher=National Education Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, the [[Robert Wood Johnson Foundation]] announced it would no longer consider teams with racist mascots, such as the Kansas City and Washington football teams, for its annual RWJF Sports Award, which recognizes organizations that contribute to public health through sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/05/07/kansas-city-chiefs-washington-redskins-racist-mascots-football-rwjf-sports-award-column/584858002/| title=Robert Wood Johnson Foundation: We honored sports teams with racist mascots.

Social science research gives weight to the perceptions of those directly affected. In particular, studies support the view that sports mascots and images are not trivial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fryberg |first=Stephanie A.|title=Of Warrior Chiefs and Indian Princesses: The Psychological Consequences of American Indian Mascots|work=Basic and applied social psychology|date=September 2008|volume=30 | issue = 3|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stereotyping directly affects academic performance and self-esteem, which contribute to all of the other issues faced by Native Americans, including suicide, unemployment, and poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/opinion/sunday/intelligence-and-the-stereotype-threat.html|title=It's Not Me, It's You|first=ANNIE|last=MURPHY PAUL|date=October 6, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=2013-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; European Americans exposed to mascots are more likely to believe not only that stereotypes are true, but that Native Americans have no identity beyond these stereotypes.&lt;ref name="bias"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chaney|first=John| title=Do American Indian Mascots = American Indian People?

===Civil rights===

The [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) passed a resolution calling for the end of the use of Native American names, images, and mascots in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aistm.org/naacp_1999_resolution.htm |title=NAACP 1999 Resolution |accessdate=2013-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128103322/http://www.aistm.org/naacp_1999_resolution.htm |archivedate=2012-11-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights|U.S. Commission on Civil Rights]] released an advisory opinion calling for an end to the use of Native American images and team names by non-Native schools. While recognizing the right to freedom of expression, the commission also recognizes those Native Americans and civil rights advocates that maintain these mascots, by promoting stereotypes, may violate anti-discrimination laws. When found in educational institutions, mascots may also create a hostile environment inconsistent with learning to respect diverse cultures, but instead teach that stereotypes that misrepresent a minority group are permissible. Those schools that claim that their sports imagery stimulate interest in Native American culture have not listened to Native groups and civil rights leaders who point out that even purportedly positive stereotypes both present a false portrayal of the past and prevent understanding of contemporary Native people as fellow Americans.&lt;ref name=USCCR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usccr.gov/press/archives/2001/041601st.htm |title=Statement of the United States Commission on Civil Rights on the use of Native American images and nicknames as sports symbols |accessdate=2016-12-10|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a report issued in 2012, a [[United Nations]] expert on Human Rights of Indigenous Peoples cited the continued use of Native American references by sports team as a part of the stereotyping that "obscures understanding of the reality of Native Americans today and instead help to keep alive racially discriminatory attitudes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=14497&amp;LangID=E |title=USA: 'Redskins' Team mascot hurtful reminder of past suffering of Native Americans – UN rights expert |publisher=United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413145318/http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=14497&amp;LangID=E |archivedate=2014-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Justice Murray Sinclair, the head of Canada's [[Truth and reconciliation commission|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] said in 2015 "sports teams with offensive names, such as Redskins and cartoonish aboriginal-looking mascots have no place in a country trying to come to grips with racism in its past".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Stop using offensive indigenous mascots in sports, Justice Murray Sinclair says| url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/11/15/stop-using-offensive-indigenous-mascots-in-sports-justice-murray-sinclair-says.html| first=Chinta| last=Puxley| publisher=The Toronto Star| date=November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legal remedies====
While all advocates for elimination of Native mascots agree that the practice is morally wrong, many do not find a basis for legal remedy. Civil rights law in the United States reflect the difference between the experience of racism by [[African American]]s and Native Americans. The effects of slavery continued after emancipation in the form of discrimination that insured a continued source of cheap labor. What European Americans wanted from Native Americans was not labor but land, and many were willing to have native people themselves assimilate. Continued discrimination came to those who refused to do so, but asserted their separate identity and rights of sovereignty. The [[Cultural appropriation|appropriation]] of native cultures is therefore seen as discriminatory practice by some but is not understood as such by those that think of assimilation as a positive process. The difference is reflected in the continued popularity of Native Americans as mascots when similar usage of the names and images of any other ethnic group, in particular [[African American]]s, would be unthinkable, and the continued claim that the stereotype of the "noble savage" honors Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|volume=56 |journal=UCLA Law Review |page=591 |title=Red: Racism and the American Indian |last=Berger |first=Bethany R. |year=2009 |url=http://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/56-3-2.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423112932/http://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/56-3-2.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, the [[Michigan Department of Civil Rights]] (MDCR) filed a complaint with the [[United States Department of Education|US Department of Education]]'s [[Office for Civil Rights]] (OCR). MDCR's complaint asserted that new research clearly establishes that use of American Indian imagery negatively impacts student learning, creating an unequal learning environment in violation of Article VI of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].&lt;ref name=MDCR&gt;{{cite web|title=Michigan Department of Civil Rights: Continued Use of American Indian Mascots Hurts Student Achievement |url=http://www.michigan.gov/mdcr/0,4613,7-138--294605--,00.html |publisher=State of Michigan |accessdate=23 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218160526/http://www.michigan.gov/mdcr/0%2C4613%2C7-138--294605--%2C00.html |archivedate=18 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, the OCR dismissed the case on the basis that the legal standard required not only harm, but the intent to do harm, which was not established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.freep.com/article/20130603/NEWS06/306030121/indian-mascot-ban-tossed-michigan| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605075801/http://www.freep.com/article/20130603/NEWS06/306030121/indian-mascot-ban-tossed-michigan| archive-date=June 5, 2013|title=Feds toss Michigan complaint to ban Indian mascots for sports teams|date=June 3, 2013|newspaper=The Detroit Free Press|first=Lori|last=Higgins|accessdate=December 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A legal claim of discrimination rests upon a group agreeing that a particular term or practice is offensive, thus opponents of mascot change often point to individuals claiming Native American heritage who say they are not offended. This raised the difficulty of [[Native American identity in the United States]], also an evolving controversy.&lt;ref name="Morris.2015"/&gt;

===Religious organizations===

In 1992, the [[Central Conference of American Rabbis]] issued a resolution calling for the end of sports teams names that promote racism, in particular the Atlanta Braves and the Washington Redskins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccarnet.org/rabbis-speak/resolutions/1992/racism-1992/|title=Resolution Adopted by the CCAR: Racism|year=1992|accessdate=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist Association]] passed a resolution to establish relationships with groups working to end the use of Indian images and symbols for sports and media mascots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.uua.org/statements/resolution-establish-formal-relationships-national-coalition-racism-sports-and-media| title=Resolution to Establish Formal Relationships with the National Coalition on Racism in Sports and Media| accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the [[United Methodist Church]] also passed a resolution condemning the use of Native American team names and sports mascots, which was highlighted in a meeting of the Black caucus of that organization in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content3.aspx?c=lwL4KnN1LtH&amp;b=5765541&amp;ct=3722449| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204042505/http://www.umc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content3.aspx?c=lwL4KnN1LtH&amp;b=5765541&amp;ct=3722449| archivedate=February 4, 2014|title=Black caucus joins Native American mascot fight|date=April 4, 2007|accessdate=December 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://umc-gbcs.org/faith-in-action/native-american-mascots-must-go |title=Native American mascots must go: Time to remove them is long passed |author=Rev.

A group of sixty-one religious leaders in Washington, D.C. sent a letter to NFL Commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] and Redskin's owner [[Daniel Snyder]] stating their moral obligation to join the "Change the Mascot" movement due to the offensive and inappropriate nature of the name which causes pain whether or not that is intended.&lt;ref name="faith"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/documents/local/letter-to-goodell-and-snyder/695/|title=Letter to Goodell and Snyder|newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/faith-leaders-urge-redskins-owner-dan-snyder-and-nfl-to-change-teams-name/2013/12/05/e1dad2be-5dd3-11e3-be07-006c776266ed_story.html|title=Faith leaders urge Redskins owner Dan Snyder and NFL to change team's name|first=Theresa|last=Vargas|date=December 5, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the Indian Affairs Committee of the Baltimore Yearly Meeting of the [[Quakers|Society of Friends]] approved a formal statement condemning the name of the Washington football team, stating that "the NFL has violated its core principles for decades by allowing the team playing in Washington, D.C., to carry the name 'redskins,' a racist epithet that insults millions of Native Americans.

Redskin's spokesman [[Tony Wyllie]] offered a response, saying, "We respect those who disagree with our team's name, but we wish the United Church of Christ would listen to the voice of the overwhelming majority of Americans, including Native Americans, who support our name and understand it honors the heritage and tradition of the Native American community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/churches-propose-a-boycott-of-redskins-unless-the-team-change-its-name/2014/03/01/488669bc-a189-11e3-b8d8-94577ff66b28_story.html|title=Churches propose a boycott of Redskins unless the team changes its name|first=Carol|last=Morello|date=March 1, 2014|newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its annual meeting in June 2014, the membership of the UCC also passed a resolution supporting the boycott.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nativenewsonline.net/currents/united-church-christ-central-atlantic-conference-passes-resolution-calling-washington-nfl-team-name-change-calls-member-boycott/|title=UCC Central Atlantic Conference Passes Resolution Calling for Washington NFL Team Name Change &amp; Calls for Member Boycott|date=June 15, 2014|publisher=Native News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/redskins/2014/06/14/church-of-christ-boycott-washington-redskins-name/10524269/|title=Church group latest to boycott Redskins over name|first=Erik|last=Brady|date=June 14, 2014|newspaper=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution and boycott was passed by the National Synod of the UCC in June, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.19actionnews.com/story/29433519/cleveland-church-calling-on-the-washington-redskins-to-change-its-name-logo| title=Cleveland church calls on Washington Redskins to change name, logo| date=June 29, 2015| first=Scott| last=Taylor| publisher=19 Action News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The topic became an issue on a national level in the twenty-first century, with a hearing before the US Senate Committee on Indian Affairs in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indian.senate.gov/hearings/hearing.cfm?hearingID=e655f9e2809e5476862f735da16ba74a| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121212132533/http://www.indian.senate.gov/hearings/hearing.cfm?hearingID=e655f9e2809e5476862f735da16ba74a|archive-date=December 12, 2012| title=OVERSIGHT HEARING on Stolen Identities: The Impact of Racist Stereotypes on Indigenous People|date=May 5, 2011|accessdate=December 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a symposium at the Smithsonian [[National Museum of the American Indian]] in 2013.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian Institution"/&gt; In November, 2015 President Obama, speaking at the White House Tribal Nations Conference, stated "Names and mascots of sports teams like the Washington Redskins perpetuate negative stereotypes of Native Americans" and praised [[Adidas]] for a new initiative to help schools change names and mascots by designing new logos and paying for part of the cost of new uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/259331-obama-teams-should-drop-native-american-mascots| date=November 5, 2015| title=Obama: Teams should drop Native American mascots| first=Jordan| last=Fabian| publisher=The Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainstream opinion reflects the function of identification with a sports team in both individual and group psychology. There are many benefits associated with sports fandom, both private (increased self-esteem) and public (community solidarity). The activity of viewing sporting events provide shared experiences that reinforce personal and group identification with a team. The name, mascot, cheerleaders, and marching band performances reinforce and become associated with these shared experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.athleticinsight.com/Vol5Iss2/FanDevelopment.htm| title=The Social Psychology of the Creation of a Sports Fan Identity: A Theoretical Review of the Literature| author=Beth Jacobson |publisher=Athletic Insight - The Online Journal of Sports Psychology| date=2003| accessdate=January 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Snyder explicitly invokes these associations with family, friends, and an 81-year tradition as being the most important reasons for keeping the Redskins name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Letter from Washington Redskins owner Dan Snyder to fans| date= October 9, 2013| publisher=The Washington Post| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/letter-from-washington-redskins-owner-dan-snyder-to-fans/2013/10/09/e7670ba0-30fe-11e3-8627-c5d7de0a046b_story.html| accessdate=January 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When self-esteem becomes bound to the players and the team, there are many beneficial but also some unfortunate consequences, including denial or rationalization of misbehavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-psychology-of-why-sports-fans-see-their-teams-as-extensions-of-themselves/2015/01/30/521e0464-a816-11e4-a06b-9df2002b86a0_story.html| title=The psychology of why sports fans see their teams as extensions of themselves| author=Eric Simons | date=January 30, 2015| publisher=The Washington Post| accessdate=December 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for some, the identity being expressed is one of supremacy, with the defense of native mascots clearly racist.&lt;ref name="Banks.1993"/&gt;

Some individuals who support the use of Native American mascots state that they are meant to be respectful, and to pay homage to Native American people. Many have made the argument that Native American mascots focus on bravery, courage and fighting skills rather than anything derogatory. Karl Swanson, then vice-president of the Washington Redskins professional football team, declared in the magazine ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' that his team's name "symbolizes courage, dignity, and leadership", and that the "Redskins symbolize the greatness and strength of a grand people".&lt;ref name="bar"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Emert| first=Phyllis Raybin| year=2003| url=http://www.njsbf.org/images/content/1/1/11134/Respect%20Winter%202003.pdf| title=Native American Mascots: Racial Slur or Cherished Tradition?| journal=Respect (newsletter)| publisher=New Jersey State Bar Foundation| volume=2| issue=2 (Winter 2003)| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103052217/http://www.njsbf.org/images/content/1/1/11134/Respect%20Winter%202003.pdf| archivedate=2011-01-03| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many note that the behavior of fans at games is not respectful. [[Richard Lapchick]], director emeritus of Northeastern University's Center for the Study of Sport in Society, in an article: "Could you imagine people mocking African Americans in [[Blackface|black face]] at a game? Yet go to a game where there is a team with an Indian name and you will see fans with [[Body painting|war paint]] on their faces. Is this not the equivalent to black face?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=lapchick/050825&amp;num=0|title=Mascots are a matter of respect|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others claim Native American mascots help promote the culture to those who might be unaware of its significance. [[Chief Illiniwek]], the former athletic symbol for the [[University of Illinois]], became the subject of protest in 1988.&lt;ref name="Spindel"/&gt; In 1990 the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois called the mascot a dignified symbol: "His ceremonial dance is done with grace and beauty. The Chief keeps the memory of the people of a great Native American tribe alive for thousands of Illinoisans who otherwise would know little or nothing of them. However, the tribal costume was not of the [[Illinois Confederation]], but that of the [[Lakota people|Lakota tribe]]. The [[Peoria (tribe)|Peoria Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma]] is the closest living descendants of the Illiniwek Confederacy. In response to requests by former Chief Illiniwek portrayer's to bring back occasional performances, Peoria Chief John P. Froman reaffirmed the tribe's position that Chief (Illiniwek) "was not in any way representative of Peoria culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2013-05-07/updated-peoria-tribe-leader-doesnt-back-chief-return.html| title=Peoria tribe leader doesn't back Chief return| date=May 7, 2013| author=Christine Des Garennes| publisher=News-Gazette| accessdate=June 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative columnists often assert that outrage over mascots is manufactured by white liberals, rather than being the authentic voice of Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/redskins-manufactured-controversy-9395|title=Redskins: A Manufactured Controversy|author=W.

====Other team names and ethnic groups====
Many argue there is a double standard in Native Americans being so frequently used as a sports team name or mascot when the same usage would be unthinkable for other racial or ethnic group. One current exception is the [[Coachella Valley High School]] "Arabs"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/11/07/arab-team-mascot-ethnic-slur/3461059/|title=California high school's Arab mascot draws ire|date=November 7, 2013|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has also been the subject of controversy, resulting in the retirement of its more cartoonish representations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.desertsun.com/story/news/education/2014/09/09/mighty-arab-coachella-valley-high/15368751/|title='Mighty Arab' takes its place at Coachella Valley High|first=Brett|last=Kelman|newspaper=The Desert Sun|date=September 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents also see this argument as a false equivalency, because it ignores systemic inequality, and serves to discount the Native American voice by saying that if one group isn't hurt by a particular portrayal, then no group has the right to be hurt, regardless of vastly different backgrounds, treatment, and social positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2008/10/05/notre-dames-fighting-irish-mascot|title=Sociological Images| author=Gwen Sharp, PhD| date=October 5, 2008| publisher=The Society Pages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Commission on Civil Rights|U.S. Commission on Civil Rights]] call for an end to the use of Native American mascots was only for non-native schools.&lt;ref name=USCCR/&gt; In cases where universities were founded to educate Native Americans, such mascots may not be examples of [[cultural appropriation]] or stereotyping. Examples include the [[Haskell Indian Nations Fighting Indians|Fighting Indians]] of the [[Haskell Indian Nations University]] and the [[University of North Carolina at Pembroke]] (UNCP), which continues to have a substantial number of native students, and close ties to the [[Lumbee]] tribe.

====Financial impact of change====
Many supporters of Native American mascots feel that the financial cost of changing mascots would far outweigh the benefits. Sales of merchandise with team mascots and nicknames ranging from T-shirts to beer cozies generate millions of dollars in sales each year, and teams contend that a change in team mascots would render this merchandise useless.&lt;ref name="bar"/&gt; The cost of removing images from uniforms and all other items, which must be paid out of local school funds, is a greater factor for secondary schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mailtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20120518/NEWS/205180322|title=State bans Native American mascots|date=May 18, 2012|first=Sanne|last=Specht|newspaper=Mail Tribune|accessdate=February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents feel that despite the cost of a change in team mascots, it should be done to prevent what they believe is racial stereotyping. [[Clyde Bellecourt]], when director of the [[American Indian Movement]] stated: "It's the behavior that accompanies all of this that's offensive. The rubber [[Tomahawk (axe)|tomahawks]], the chicken [[War bonnet|feather headdresses]], people wearing [[Body painting|war paint]] and making these ridiculous [[Battle cry|war whoops]] with a tomahawk in one hand and a beer in the other; all of these have significant meaning for us. And the psychological impact it has, especially on our youth, is devastating."&lt;ref name="bar"/&gt;

A study done by the [[Emory University]] [[Goizueta Business School]] indicates that the growing unpopularity of Native American mascots is a financial drain for professional teams, losing money compared to more popular animal mascots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.emory.edu/sportsmarketing/2013/12/19/the-financial-impact-of-mascots-on-sports-brands/?_ga=1.256951951.500422532.1397069844b|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020044121/https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/esma/2013/12/19/the-financial-impact-of-mascots-on-sports-brands/?_ga=1.256951951.500422532.1397069844b| archivedate=October 20, 2014| title=The Financial Impact of Mascots on Sports Brands|publisher=Emory University|date=December 19, 2013|accessdate=April 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Public opinion surveys====
{{see also|Washington Redskins name opinion polls}}
A survey conducted in 2002 by [[Harris Insights &amp; Analytics|The Harris Poll]] for [[Sports Illustrated]] (SI) found that 81 percent of Native Americans who live outside traditional Indian reservations and 53 percent of Indians on reservations did not find the images discriminatory. The authors of the article concluded that "Although most Native American activists and tribal leaders consider Indian team names and mascots offensive, neither Native Americans in general nor a cross section of U.S. sports fans agree". According to the article, "There is a near total disconnect between Indian activists and the Native American population on this issue." An Indian activist commented on the results saying "that Native Americans' self-esteem has fallen so low that they don't even know when they're being insulted".&lt;ref name=PriceWoo&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.si.com/vault/2002/03/04/8100154/the-indian-wars-the-campaign-against-indian-nicknames-and-mascots-presumes-that-they-offend-native-americansbut-do-they-we-took-a-poll-and-you-wont-believe-the-results| author = S.L. Price| title = The Indian Wars| work = Sports Illustrated| date = March 4, 2002| pages=66–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after the SI article, a group of five social scientists experienced in researching the mascot issue published a journal article arguing against the validity of this survey and its conclusions. First they state that "The confidence with which the magazine asserts that a 'disconnect' between Native American activists and Native Americans exists on this issue belies the serious errors in logic and accuracy made in the simplistic labeling of Native Americans who oppose mascots as 'activists.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://jss.sagepub.com/content/26/4/381|title=Of Polls and Race Predudice|doi=10.1177/0193732502238255|journal=Journal of Sport and Social Issues|date=November 2002|volume=26|issue=4|page=381|author1=C.

More recent surveys, rather than addressing the larger issue, have targeted the controversy over the name of the Washington Redskins, asking if the word is offensive or if it should be changed. By a large majority (71–89 percent), public opinion has maintained that the name should not change. However, more than half (53–59 percent) agree that "redskin" is not an appropriate term for Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=b41b9bde-1b19-40f7-af86-0b585eb8df03| title=Results of SurveyUSA News Poll #20802| date=October 15, 2013| accessdate=November 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/page/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/06/25/National-Politics/Polling/release_246.xml?44|title=Should the Washington Redskins change their name?|date=July 30, 2013|accessdate=October 16, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wusa9.com/longform/sports/nfl/2014/09/25/nfl-washington-redskins-name-survey-dc-maryland-virginia-response/16098841/|title=DC Speaks: Keep Redskins name|author=Greg Cohen|publisher=WUSA|date=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The survey most frequently cited by opponents of change as definitive of Native American opinion was performed in 2004 as part of the [[National Annenberg Election Survey]]. Among other questions regarding election year issues, respondents who identified themselves as being Native American were asked: "The professional football team in Washington calls itself the Washington Redskins. As a Native American, do you find that name offensive or doesn't it bother you?" In response, ninety percent replied that the name did not bother them, while nine percent said that it was offensive, and one percent would not answer.&lt;ref name="Annenberg.20140927"&gt;{{cite web |author=Kathleen Hall Jamieson Ph.D. |title=Most Indians Say Name of Washington "Redskins" Is Acceptable While 9 Percent Call It Offensive |url=http://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/most-indians-say-name-of-washington-redskins-is-acceptable-while-9-percent-call-it-offensive/ |website=The Annenberg Public Policy Center |accessdate=September 27, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014154005/http://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/most-indians-say-name-of-washington-redskins-is-acceptable-while-9-percent-call-it-offensive/ |archivedate=October 14, 2013 |deadurl=no |date=September 24, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The methods used in this survey and the conclusions that can be drawn from it have been criticized by social scientists,&lt;ref name="too"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Charles Springwood|title='I'm Indian Too!': Claiming Native American Identity, Crafting Authority in Mascot Debates|publisher=Journal of Sport and Social Issues|date=February 2004|volume=28|page=56|issue=1|doi=10.1177/0193732503261477}}&lt;/ref&gt; Native American scholars&lt;ref name="ClarkD.2005"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Indigenous Voice and Vision as Commodity in a Mass-Consumption Society: The Colonial Politics of Public Opinion Polling|author=D.

A flaw unique to polls of Native Americans is they rely upon self-identification to select the target population. In an editorial in the [[The Herald-Times|Bloomington Herald Times]], Steve Russell (an enrolled [[Cherokee]] citizen and associate professor of criminal justice at [[Indiana University]]), states that both SI and Annenberg's samples of "self-identified Native Americans&amp;nbsp;... includes plenty of people who have nothing to do with Indians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iupui.edu/~mstd/e320/amerind/flap.html|title=Some collected materials about the NCAA's decision to ban Indian sports mascots from the Indianapolis area|accessdate=January 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals claiming to be Native American when they are not is well known in academic research, and people claiming Indian identity specifically to gain authority in the debate over sports mascots has been criticised.&lt;ref name="too" /&gt;

At the Center for Indigenous Peoples Studies at [[California State University]], San Bernardino a survey has conducted of 400 individuals whose identity as Native American was verified, finding that 67% agreed with the statement that "Redskins" is offensive and racist. The response from non-natives was almost the opposite, with 68% responding that the name is not offensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/lindseyadler/native-americans-offended-by-racial-slur|title=New Study Finds 67% Of Native Americans Find Redskins Name Offensive|publisher=Buzzfeed.com|date=June 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cips.csusb.edu/docs/PressRelease.pdf|title=Survey on Redskins team name found most American Indians believe it to be offensive and racist.|accessdate=June 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--As in the lead section, this is a summary of the sections that follow, and thus does not include references for each statement.--&gt;

While protests began in the 1970s, national attention to the issue did not occur until widespread television coverage of college and professional games brought the behaviour of some fans to the attention of Native Americans. The appearance of the [[Atlanta Braves]] in the [[1991 World Series]] and the [[Washington Redskins]] at the 1992 [[Super Bowl XXVI|Super Bowl]] prompted the largest response because the games were played in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], which has a large Native American population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://miamioh.edu/about-miami/diversity/miami-tribe-relations/mascot-story/native-mascots/index.html| title=Native Mascots Become a National Controversy | publisher=Miami University of Ohio| accessdate=December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documents most often cited to justifying the elimination of Native mascots are the advisory opinion by the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights]] in 2001 and a resolution by the [[American Psychological Association]] in 2005.&lt;ref name=APA/&gt;&lt;ref name=USCCR/&gt; Neither of these documents refer to subjective perceptions of offensiveness, but to scientific evidence of harms and legal definitions of discrimination. However, the issue is often discussed in the media in terms of feelings and opinions, and prevents full understanding of the history and context of the use of Native American names and images and why their use by sports teams should be eliminated.&lt;ref name="handbook"&gt;{{cite book|editor=C. Richard King|title=The Native American Mascot Controversy: A Handbook|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, Maryland|year=2010|isbn=978-0-8108-6731-4|page=1| chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual school districts have responded to complaints by local Native American individuals and tribes, or have made changes due to an increased awareness of the issue among educators and students. New Native mascots have not been proposed in recent decades, or are withdrawn before becoming official due to public opposition. For example, in 2016 when one of the teams in the [[National College Prospects Hockey League]] (NCPHL) was announced as the Lake Erie Warriors with a caricature Mohawk logo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/07/28/social-media-blasts-lake-erie-warriors-over-racist-logo-165302| title=Social Media Blasts Lake Erie Warriors Over Racist Logo| first=Vincent| last=Schilling| date=July 28, 2016| publisher=Indian Country Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was immediate changed to the Lake Erie Eagles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.uni-watch.com/2016/07/30/lake-erie-warriors-renamed-lake-erie-eagles-probably/ |title=Lake Erie Warriors Renamed Lake Erie Eagles (probably)| first=Paul| last=Lukas| date=July 30, 2016| publisher=Uni-Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal and administrative action===
{{main|Native American mascot laws and regulations}}
Statewide laws or school board decisions regarding team names and mascots have passed in states with significant Native American populations; including California (2015),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB30| title=AB-30 School or athletic team names: California Racial Mascots Act. | accessdate=September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colorado (2014),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://coloradopolitics.com/995638-american-indian-mascot-bill-dies-committee/

In the original law, a single individual could file a complaint with the burden of proof on the school to defend their mascot, in the new law a petition signed by 10% of the school district residents is needed, and the petitioners need to prove discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wislawjournal.com/2013/11/17/opponents-urge-walker-to-veto-mascots-bill/|title=Opponents urge Walker to veto mascots bill|date=November 17, 2013|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Wisconsin Law Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cdcgamingreports.com/menominee-leader-criticizes-wis-school-mascot-law/|title=Menominee leader criticizes Wis. school mascot law|first=TODD|last=RICHMOND|publisher=Associated Press|date=February 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.wrn.com/2015/03/sokoagan-chair-changes-to-mascot-law-a-mockery-of-indigenous-people/| title=Sokaogon chair: changes to mascot law 'a mockery of indigenous people'| date=March 5, 2015| first=Bob| last=Hague| publisher=Wisconsin Radio Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secondary schools and youth leagues===
[[Secondary schools]] in both the United States and Canada have had histories similar to colleges, some changing voluntarily while others maintain their current mascots.

An analysis of a database in 2013 indicates that there are currently more than 2,000 high schools with mascots that reference Native American culture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Munguia|first1=Hayley|title=The 2,128 Native American Mascots People Aren't Talking About|url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-2128-native-american-mascots-people-arent-talking-about/|website=fivethirtyeight.com|accessdate=6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared to around 3,000 fifty years ago.&lt;ref name="NCAI"/&gt; While 28 high schools dropped the name "Redskins" in the 25 years between 1988 and mid-2013, 14 schools changed the name in the years since.

====Canada====
The Department of Educational Foundations at the [[University of Saskatchewan]] passed a resolution calling for the retirement of all school mascots and logos that depict [[First Nations]] people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/staff-at-saskatchewan-university-calls-for-end-of-first-nations-logos-mascots-1.1546812|title=Staff at Saskatchewan university calls for end of First Nations logos, mascots|publisher=CTVNews.ca|date=November 16, 2013|accessdate=January 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to moving to changing their own mascots, school boards in Ontario are also considering a ban on students wearing any articles bearing offensive names or logos, be they professional or local teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/yourtoronto/education/2016/02/24/school-boards-onside-with-move-to-ban-racist-logos.html| title=School boards onside with move to ban 'racist logos'| first=Kristin| last=Rushowy| date=February 24, 2016| publisher=The Toronto Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ian Champeau, an [[Ojibway]] man in [[Ottawa]], Ontario, filed a human rights complaint against the Nepean Redskins Football Club on behalf of his five-year-old daughter in an effort to get the team to change its name. "How are they going to differentiate the playing field from the school yard? What's going to stop them from calling my daughter a redskin in the school yard? That's as offensive as using the [[Nigger#The N-word euphemism|n-word]]." [[Assembly of First Nations]] National Chief [[Shawn Atleo]] said he supports the move because the word ''Redskin'' is "offensive and hurtful and completely inappropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/09/04/redskins-human-rights-complaint-a-tribe-called-red_n_3866220.html|title=Nepean Redskins Human Rights Complaint: A Tribe Called Red Member Takes Football To Tribunal| publisher=HuffPost Canada Music| first=Jason| last=MacNeil| date=September 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team was changed to the "Nepean Eagles", chosen from 70 suggestions submitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sunnewsnetwork.ca/sunnews/sports/archives/2014/01/20140114-112929.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213035125/http://www.sunnewsnetwork.ca/sunnews/sports/archives/2014/01/20140114-112929.html| archivedate=February 13, 2015||title=Nepean Redskins says changing its 'controversial' name to cost about $100Gs|date=January 14, 2014|publisher=Sun News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niigaan Sinclair ([[Anishinaabe]]), a writer and assistant professor at the [[University of Manitoba]], applauded the decision and contrasted it to the decision of [[Daniel Snyder]], the Washington team owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/breakingnews/no-honour-in-native-names-238687531.html|title=No 'honour' in native names|first=Niigaan|last=Sinclair|date=January 4, 2014|newspaper=Winnipeg Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the Swift Current Indians baseball club became the [[Swift Current 57's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://globalnews.ca/news/3173209/swift-current-baseball-team-changes-name-from-indians-to-57s/ |title=Swift Current baseball team changes name from "Indians" to "57's" |last=Huffman |first=Alexa |date=January 10, 2017 |work=Global News |access-date=February 28, 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301093515/http://globalnews.ca/news/3173209/swift-current-baseball-team-changes-name-from-indians-to-57s/ |archivedate=March 1, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014 the [[Nez Perce people|Nez Perce Tribal Executive Committee]] sent a letter to two northern Idaho school districts with American Indian mascots asking that they be changed. The mascots are the Sacajawea Junior High Braves in [[Lewiston School District|Lewiston]] and the [[Nezperce, Idaho|Nezperce]] High School Indians. The school officials state that they will have meetings and gather public opinions before making a decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/world/57451183-68/board-district-lewiston-mascot.html.csp|title= At request of American Indians, Idaho schools eye mascot name change|author=The Associated Press|date=January 26, 2014|publisher=The Salt Lake Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the media coverage of the Washington Redskins, high schools with the name Redskins have received particular attention, including three which have a majority of Native American students. Advocates for the name conclude that because some Native Americans use the name to refer to themselves, it is not insulting.&lt;ref name=Spoken&gt;{{cite web|first=Rick |last=Reilly |title=Have the people spoken? |url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9689220/redskins-name-change-not-easy-sounds/ |website=ESPN |accessdate=October 15, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130919035546/http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9689220/redskins-name-change-not-easy-sounds |archivedate=September 19, 2013 |deadurl=no |date=September 18, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the principal of one of these, [[Red Mesa High School]] in [[Teec Nos Pos, Arizona]], said that use of the word outside American Indian communities should be avoided because it could perpetuate "the legacy of negativity that the term has created."&lt;ref name="Michelle Peirano"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cronkitenewsonline.com/2013/05/in-debate-over-redskins-name-is-the-r-word-for-racism-or-respect/|title=In debate over Redskins name, is the 'R-word' for racism or respect?|date=May 1, 2013|first=Michelle|last=Peirano|newspaper=Cronkite News|accessdate=2014-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relationships with tribes to retain Native names have been established at the high school level. [[Arapahoe High School (Centennial, Colorado)]] now uses a logo provided by the [[Arapaho]] Tribe of Wyoming, which initially included an agreement that the image would not be placed on the gym floor or any article of clothing. The latter provision has not always been observed, but the logo does not appear on the team uniforms. The agreement also includes tribal participation in school events. A similar agreement has been worked out between the Northern Arapahoe Tribe and the Strasburg High School " Indians" in [[Strasburg, Colorado]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/05/14/indian-mascot-at-hs-gets-blessing-from-tribe-and-without-cultural-controversy-im-honored| title= Indian mascot at HS gets blessing from tribe — and without cultural controversy: ‘I’m honored’ | date=May 14, 2018| author=Dave Urbanski| publisher=KCNC-TV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was discussion about the "Indians" name at El Reno High School, [[El Reno, Oklahoma]] when a Native American student was not allowed to wear a beaded [[Square academic cap|mortarboard]] at graduation. The result was the signing of a Spirit Charter with the Cheyenne &amp; Arapaho Tribes to retain the name while agreeing to avoid any derogatory or disrespectful Native American references, including the wearing of Native American regalia by non-natives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.elrenops.org/| title=El Reno Public Schools| accessdate=February 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.koco.com/article/native-american-tribes-give-blessing-for-el-reno-high-schools-mascot/8777394| title=Native American tribes give blessing for El Reno High School’s mascot| date=February 13, 2017| author=Patrina Adger| publisher=KOCO-TV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local controversy may continue after a name change. [[Park High School (Cottage Grove, Minnesota)|Park High School]], in [[Cottage Grove, Minnesota]] changed from the Indians to the Wolfpack in 1994. 
An "Indian Head" mosaic in the main hallway created in 1965 has become the subject of current contention between Native Americans and their supporters who want it removed, and others in the community who consider it a work of art and part of the school's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.swcbulletin.com/news/education/4404789-fate-park-indian-head-mosaic-divides-community#.Wog-F2xsvzQ.facebook| title=Fate of Park Indian head mosaic divides community| author=William Loeffler| date=February 16, 2018| accessdate=February 16, 2018| newspaper=South Washington County Bulletin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colleges and universities===
[[File:Ticket Washington vs Stanford 1930 side1.jpg|right|thumb|250px|1930 football ticket stub depicting the former Stanford Indian mascot]]
Some college teams voluntarily changed their names and mascots. [[Stanford University]] had "The Stanford Indian" as its mascot from 1930 to 1972. Today Stanford's athletic team identity is built around the "[[Stanford Cardinal]]", reflecting the primary [[school colors|school color]] that has been used from the earliest days, while the unofficial mascot shown on its primary logo is the [[Stanford Tree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Color: Stanford Identity Toolkit|url=http://identity.stanford.edu/color.html|accessdate=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another early change was the "[[Saltine Warrior#Mascot|Saltine Warrior]]" that represented [[Syracuse University]] from 1931 until 1978. After a brief attempt to use a Roman warrior, the mascot became [[Otto the Orange]] for the school color. [[Miami University]] began discussion regarding the propriety of the Redskins name and images in 1972, and changed its team nickname to [[Miami RedHawks|RedHawks]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miami.muohio.edu/about-miami/diversity/miami-tribe-relations/mascot-story/index.html|title=Mascot Story|accessdate=February 5, 2013|publisher=Miami University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the team name of [[Eastern Michigan University]] changed from the [[Hurons]] to the Eagles in 1991, the change remained controversial as some students and alumni sought to restore it. In 2012, the university president brought back the Hurons logo, which was placed inside a flap of the band uniforms, along with another historic logo, with the stated intent of recognizing the past. However, the return of the Hurons logo has prompted protests from Native Americans at the university and in the local community, who state that the old mascot promotes stereotypes and hostility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2015/06/16/eastern-michigan-university-hurons-logo/28797179/| title=Native Americans rally against Hurons logo at EMU| first=Kim| last=Kozlowski| newspaper=The Detroit News| date=June 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2015/06/16/huron-logo-emu/28828217/| title=Community wants logo off EMU band uniforms| first=David| last=Jesse| newspaper=Detroit Free Press |date=June 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marquette University]] changed their team name from the Warriors to the Golden Eagles in 1994. The school's president stated: "We live in a different era than when the Warriors nickname was selected in 1954. The perspective of time has shown us that our actions, intended or not, can offend others. We must not knowingly act in a way that others will believe, based on their experience, to be an attack on their dignity as fellow human beings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gomarquette.com/genrel/051105aaa.html|title=Trustees announce new nickname selection process|date=May 11, 2005|publisher=Marquette University|accessdate=January 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1994, [[St. John's University (New York)]] changed the name of its athletic teams from the Redmen to the Red Storm after the university was pressured by American Indian groups who considered the term "Redmen" a slur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/09/nyregion/use-of-indians-as-mascots-to-be-subject-of-an-inquiry.html|title=Use of Indians As Mascots To Be Subject Of an Inquiry|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 9, 1998|accessdate=February 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2002, The Strategic Planning Committee of [[Stonehill College]] determined that the then-current mascot, the chieftain, was disrespectful to American Indians and decided that it would be changed. After discussion, the mascot was changed to the Skyhawk in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stonehillskyhawks.com/Why_A_Skyhawk|title=Why a Skyhawk?|accessdate=October 20, 2014|publisher=Stonehill College}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Jim Seavey, associate director of athletics, stated: "Twelve years ago, the college discarded the logo that depicted the Indian with the headdress and feathers and stuff. We really did not have anything to represent our identity that we were comfortable with. We felt&amp;nbsp;... that it wasn't appropriate to have a physical representation of a Native American as our mascot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2005/02/27/digging_for_new_name_sends_stonehill_to_web/|title=Digging for new name sends Stonehill to Web|first=Emily|last=Sweeney|date=February 27, 2005|newspaper=The Boston Globe|accessdate=January 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, teams that are not directly affected by this controversy have issued their opinions. The [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lssaa.wisc.edu/aisas/policy07.html |title=University Of Wisconsin Athletic Department Policy On Native American Logos And Names |accessdate=February 5, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221010322/http://www.lssaa.wisc.edu/aisas/policy07.html |archivedate=February 21, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of Iowa]] have both refused to schedule non-conference games against schools with Native American mascots. The University of Iowa's own nickname, "Hawkeyes", has Native American origins (Iowa is the "[[Hawkeye State]]"), although the team uses a [[hawk]] as its symbol rather than an Indian.

Although [[Dartmouth College]] had not used an Indian mascot for many years, [[Yale University]] printed a program for the 2016 game commemorating its 100th game against Dartmouth showing historical program covers featuring depictions of Native Americans that are now viewed as racist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2016/10/10/football-programs-criticized-for-racist-imagery/| title=Football programs criticized for racist imagery| first=Manasa| last=Rao| date=October 10, 2016| publisher=Yale Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Florida State Seminoles]] of [[Florida State University]] use names and images associated with the [[Seminole]] people but this use is officially sanctioned by the [[Seminole Tribe of Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wieberg|first=Steve|title=NCAA allowing Florida State to use its Seminole mascot|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/2005-08-23-fsu-mascot-approved_x.htm|publisher=USAToday|accessdate=November 21, 2011|date=August 23, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====National Collegiate Athletic Association====
{{main|NCAA Native American mascot decision}}
The [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) distributed a "self evaluation" to 31 colleges in 2005, for teams to examine the use of potentially offensive imagery with their mascot choice. Subsequently, 19 teams were cited as having potentially "hostile or abusive" names, mascots, or images, that would be banned from displaying them during post-season play, and prohibited from hosting tournaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.ncaa.org/static/champion/where-pride-meets-prejudice/index.php| title=Where Pride Meets Prejudice| first=Amy| last=Schwarb| publisher=National Collegiate Athletic Association| accessdate=December 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the colleges previously using Native American imagery changed except for those granted waivers when they obtained official support from individual tribes based upon the principle of [[Tribal sovereignty in the United States|tribal sovereignty]].&lt;ref name="NCAI"/&gt;

[[San Diego State University]] (SDSU) was not cited by the NCAA in 2005 due to a decision that the Aztecs were not a Native American tribe with any living descendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://legacy.sandiegouniontribune.com/uniontrib/20050806/news_1s6mascots.html| title=NCAA puts limited ban on Indian mascots: Postseason policy doesn't hit Aztecs| first=Brent| last=Schrotenboer| date=August 6, 2005| publisher=San Diego Union-Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in February 2017 the SDSU Native American Student Alliance (NASA) supported removal of the mascot, calling its continued use "institutional racism" in its official statement to the Committee on Diversity, Equity and Outreach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thedailyaztec.com/81677/news/native-american-student-alliance-proposes-removal-of-aztec-mascot/| title=Native American Student Alliance proposes removal of Aztec mascot| author=Allyson Myers| date=February 27, 2017| publisher=The Daily Aztec}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwEYVqMcYGJOOF8xb0FxVFFwR0NqQldPN1BzbVR0aTRyZ1Fz/view| title=NASA 2016-2017 Mascot Statement| accessdate=February 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although that resolution was rejected by the SDSU Associated Students, the University Senate, which represents the administration, faculty, staff and students, has voted to phase out the human depiction of the Aztec Warrior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://timesofsandiego.com/sports/2017/11/08/no-more-aztec-warrior-sdsu-university-senate-votes-to-retire-mascot/| title=No More Aztec Warrior?

Few professional teams using Native names and imagery remain, several changing when they moved to other cities, while others went out of business. The [[Atlanta Hawks]] were originally the [[Quad Cities|Tri-Cities]] Blackhawks (using an "Indian" logo),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nba/tri/tricities.html |title=Tri-Cities Blackhawks (1946–1951) |accessdate=November 14, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120054903/http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nba/tri/tricities.html |archivedate=January 20, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Los Angeles Clippers|Clippers]] were originally the [[Buffalo Braves]]. The [[Golden State Warriors]] eliminated Native American imagery in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/uniforms_warriors.html|title=Going Retro: Golden State Warriors|publisher=NBA|accessdate=February 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The [[United States national rugby league team]] was known as the Tomahawks until 2015, when [[USA Rugby League]] replaced the [[American National Rugby League]] as the sport's governing body in the U.S. and chose the simpler Hawks as the new name for the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.usarl.com/2015/05/hawks-swoop-in-for-new-usa-national-team-name/| title=Hawks swoop in for new USA National Team Name| accessdate=December 9, 2016| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529173837/http://www.usarl.com/2015/05/hawks-swoop-in-for-new-usa-national-team-name/| archivedate=May 29, 2015| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Atlanta Braves====
The [[Atlanta Braves]] remain the home of the [[tomahawk chop]] (although it began at [[Florida State University]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.mlb.com/atl/video/v21042257/this-is-why-we-chop-the-history-of-the-tomahawk-chop|title=The history of the tomahawk chop| accessdate=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The logo has changed through the years from an Indian in full headdress to an Indian with a [[Mohawk hairstyle]] and single feather (described as either laughing or shouting), then to the Braves name in script over a tomahawk. The mascot [[Chief Noc-A-Homa]] was replaced in 1986 by a baseball-headed "Homer the Brave",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://lastwordonbaseball.com/2017/01/19/homer-braves-alternative-mascot/| title=Homer is a Fraud: A Look at Braves Alternative Mascot Ideas

====Chicago Blackhawks====
{{main|Chicago Blackhawks name and logo controversy}}
Native American rights advocate [[Suzan Shown Harjo]] ([[Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes|Cheyenne]] and Hodulgee [[Muscogee (Creek) Nation|Muscogee]]) says the Blackhawks have escaped the scrutiny given to other teams using Native imagery because [[Ice hockey|hockey]] is not a cultural force on the level of [[American football|football]]. But she says national American Indian organizations have called for an end to all Indian-related mascots and that she found the hockey team's name and Indian head symbol to be offensive. "It lacks dignity," she said. "There's dignity in a school being named after a person or a people. There's dignity in a health clinic or hospital. There's nothing dignified in something being so named (that is used for) recreation or entertainment or fun." The National Congress of American Indians also opposes the Blackhawks' logo, as it does all Native American mascots.&lt;ref name=Keilman.2013&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-06-19/news/ct-met-indian-mascots-20130619_1_american-indians-black-hawk-mascots| title=Protests rare over Blackhawks' name, logo: While critics say use of Indian mascots perpetuates outdated image, hockey club says it has mutually beneficial ties with local community| date=June 19, 2013| first=John| last=Keilman| newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cleveland Indians====
{{main|Cleveland Indians name and logo controversy}}
[[File:Vizquel96.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Former Cleveland Indians player [[Venezuelan people|Venezuelan]] [[Omar Vizquel]] wearing a baseball cap showing the image of the Cleveland Indians mascot, [[Chief Wahoo]]]]
Native Americans used the occasion of the 175th anniversary of the founding of Cleveland in 1971 to protest the history of native mistreatment by non-natives, from massacres to Chief Wahoo.&lt;ref name=oakley.1971&gt;{{cite news|last=Oakley|first=Don|title=Dilemmas Dog Indians|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2rhQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ltAMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5731,2180138&amp;dq=chief+wahoo+protest&amp;hl=en|accessdate=June 7, 2013|newspaper=The Portsmouth Times|date=August 21, 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protests have continued on Opening Day of the baseball season each year since 1973.&lt;ref name=cnn.2012&gt;{{cite news|last=Siek|first=Stephanie|title=New baseball season brings fresh protests against Cleveland Indians mascot|url=http://inamerica.blogs.cnn.com/2012/04/06/new-baseball-season-brings-fresh-protests-against-cleveland-indians-mascot/|accessdate=June 8, 2013|publisher=CNN|date=April 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chief Wahoo is part of an exhibit at the [[Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia]] maintained by [[Ferris State University]] in Michigan. For Dr. David Pilgrim, a sociology professor at Ferris State and an expert in racial imagery, the symbol is a "red Sambo" that hardly differs from the caricatures of blacks popular in the Jim Crow era in which Wahoo was created, when such depictions of minority races were popularly used to inflame prejudice and justify discriminatory laws and behavior. Pilgrim explains how the exaggerated features serve their discriminatory purpose by emphasizing the differences of the depicted race, thereby reinforcing the idea that the caricaturized race is inferior.

The team's Vice President of Public Relations has defended the use of Chief Wahoo, saying that fans only associate Wahoo with baseball.&lt;ref name=Pattakos.2012&gt;{{cite news|last=Pattakos|first=Peter|title=The Curse of Chief Wahoo: Are we paying the price for embracing America's last acceptable racist symbol?|url=http://www.clevescene.com/gyrobase/the-curse-of-chief-wahoo/Content?oid=2954423&amp;showFullText=true|accessdate=May 17, 2013|newspaper=The Cleveland Scene|date=April 25, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120062629/http://www.clevescene.com/gyrobase/the-curse-of-chief-wahoo/Content?oid=2954423&amp;showFullText=true|archivedate=January 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the team in the 2016 season led to renewed attention,&lt;ref name="Jerry Howarth"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edwards|first1=Peter|title=Jerry Howarth refuses to say Cleveland team name|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/baseball/2016/10/11/jerry-howarth-refuses-to-say-cleveland-team-name.html|website=Toronto Star|date=October 11, 2016|accessdate=October 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/architect-douglas-cardinal-files-human-rights-complaint-against-use-of-cleveland-s-name-logo-1.3806662| title=Architect Douglas Cardinal files human rights complaint against use of Cleveland's name, logo: Major League Baseball 'does not give baseball teams license for such wanton discrimination,' lawyer says| publisher=CBC News| date=October 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.nationalpost.com/sports/mlb/activist-in-court-today-to-bar-cleveland-indians-from-using-name-and-chief-wahoo-logo-in-ontario| title=Cleveland Indians can use name and 'Chief Wahoo' logo during ALCS games in Toronto, judge rules| first=Joseph| last=Brean| date=October 17, 2016| publisher=National Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/10/cleveland-indians-native-americans-rally-logo-161025193242211.html| title=Cleveland Indians: Native Americans rally against logo| date=October 25, 2016| publisher= Aljaxeera}}&lt;/ref&gt; with pressure from current MLB Commissioner [[Rob Manfred]] that there should be progress towards elimination of the logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/12/sports/commissioner-starts-to-press-cleveland-indians-about-logo.html| title=Commissioner Starts to Press Cleveland Indians About Logo| author=David Waldstein | date=April 12, 2017| newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Edmonton Eskimos====
{{further|Edmonton Eskimos#Origins of the name}}
In part because they do not use any native imagery, the Eskimos are rarely mentioned with regard to the controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/washington-redskins-fight-could-put-pressure-on-edmonton-eskimos-1.2680161|title=Washington Redskins fight could put pressure on Edmonton Inuit|first=Matt|last=Kwong|publisher=CBC|date=June 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However [[Natan Obed]], the President of [[Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami]], Canada's national Inuit organization, has stated that "''Eskimo'' is not only outdated, it is now largely considered a derogatory term" and is a "relic of colonial power".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/attention-edmonton-eskimos-inuit-are-not-mascots/article27512855/|title=Attention Edmonton Eskimos: Inuit are not mascots| first=Natan| last=Obed| newspaper=The Globe and Mail| date=November 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The editorial board of the Toronto Star sees a name change as the inevitable result of social evolution, and reflecting respect for indigenous peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorials/2017/11/26/edmontons-eskimos-should-get-with-the-times-and-change-their-name.html| title=Edmonton’s Eskimos should get with the times and change their name| author=Star Editorial Board| newspaper=Toronto Star| date=November 26, 2017| accessdate=November 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kansas City Chiefs====

In 1963 the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] adopted a name referring to Native Americans, when the Dallas Texans (AFL) relocated. The team was named in honor of Kansas City mayor [[Harold Roe Bartle]] who was instrumental in bringing the Texans to [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. Bartel earned his nickname as founder of a [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]] honor camping society, [[Tribe of Mic-O-Say]], in which he was "Chief" Lone Bear. In 1989 the Chiefs switched from [[Warpaint (mascot)|Warpaint]], a [[Pinto horse]] ridden by a man in a feathered headdress, to their current mascot [[K. C. Wolf]]. Warpaint returned in 2009, but is ridden by a [[Cheerleading|cheerleader]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcchiefs.com/cheerleaders/warpaint.html|title=Warpaint|publisher=Kansas City Chiefs|accessdate=November 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the appearance of photographs of fans attending an October 2013 game wearing feathers and warpaint—and doing the tomahawk chop—in the ''[[Kansas City Star]]'', numerous Native Americans submitted complaints to the publication. One caller, who was especially upset that the photographs were published on [[Columbus Day]], described the images as a "mockery" and "racist". Writing for the ''Star'''s "Public Editor" column, Derek Donovan explained that he found the complaints "reasonable" and suggested that the newspaper depict "other colorful, interesting people in the crowds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kansascity.com/2013/10/27/4577055/fans-indian-dress-is-problematic.html|title=Chiefs fans' 'Indian' dress is problematic|date=October 27, 2013|first=DEREK|last=DONOVAN|newspaper=The Kansas City Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Kansas City Star'' reported in early August 2014 that the team's management is planning discussions with some Native American groups to find a non-confrontational way to eliminate, or at least reduce, offensive behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kansascity.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/sam-mellinger/article1161612.html|title= To avoid a cultural free-for-all, Chiefs form alliance with American Indian groups|first=SAM|last=MELLINGER|newspaper=The Kansas City Star|date=August 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amanda Blackhorse, the lead plaintiff in the trademark case against the Washington Redskins, thinks the real solution is a name change for the Chiefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kansascity.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/sam-mellinger/article618354.html|title= Woman behind fight against Washington's NFL nickname says Chiefs should be on guard|first=SAM|last=MELLINGER|newspaper=The Kansas City Star|date=June 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Native Americans in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] picketed at the game between the Chiefs and the [[Arizona Cardinals]], and have asked the Cardinals' management to bar "[[Redface]]", the wearing of headdresses and face paint, protesting what they perceive to be a mockery of Native American culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/valleyfever/2014/12/native_americans_calling_on_arizona_cardinals_to_make_policy_against_headdr.php| title=Native Americans Calling on Arizona Cardinals to Make Policy Against Headdresses, Redface| first=Matthew| last=Hendley| date=December 10, 2014| publisher=Phoenix New Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; A protest took place in Minnesota when the Chiefs played the Vikings on October 18, 2015.

On June 18, 2014, the [[Trademark Trial and Appeal Board]] voted to cancel the team's trademarks in a two to one decision that held that the term "redskins" is disparaging to a "substantial composite of Native Americans."&lt;ref name=BelsonK.20140618&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nyti.ms/1l2Wela|title=U.S. Patent Office Cancels Redskins Trademark Registration|author1=Ken Belson|author2=Edward Wyatt|date=June 18, 2014|newspaper=The New York Times| accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GormanD.20140801&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.inta.org/INTABulletin/Pages/UNITEDSTATESInaSplitDecisiontheTTABAffirmsCancellationofREDSKINSTrademarks.aspx| title=UNITED STATES: In a Split Decision, the TTAB Affirms Cancellation of REDSKINS Trademarks| work=INTA Journal| publisher=International Trademark Association| author=Danielle Gorman| date=August 1, 2014| volume=69| issue=14| accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on June 19, 2017 in a separate case ([[Matal v.

In response to the possibility that the team could return to the District of Columbia in a new stadium, a coalition of nine civil rights organizations issued a statement in August, 2018 that such a move should not be made "unless the team agrees to drop the “R-word” racial slur as its mascot."&lt;ref name="NAACP.2018"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.naacp.org/latest/leading-national-civil-rights-racial-justice-organizations-announce-joint-opposition-washington-nfl-team-locating-new-stadium-district-columbia/| title=Leading National Civil Rights and Racial Justice Organizations Announce Joint Opposition to Washington NFL Team Locating New Stadium in District of Columbia| date=August 24, 2018| website=NAACP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other issues==

===Stereotyping by rival fans===
In addition to the behavior of the teams that have Native American names or mascots, their rivals often invoke racist stereotypes.

In December 2013 when the Washington Redskins played the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] an employee of a [[Sonic Drive-In]] in Missouri placed a message outside that used [[scalping]], [[Indian reservation|reservations]] and [[Whisky|whiskey]] to disparage the "Redskins". It was quickly removed with the owner's apologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2520773/Sonic-Drive-restaurant-upsets-racist-sign-scalp-Washington-Redskins.html|title=Fast food restaurant upsets customers with racist sign promising that the Kansas City Chiefs would 'scalp' the Washington Redskins|publisher=Daily Mail|first=Sara|last=Malm|date=9 December 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rubber severed "Indian" head impaled on a knife has been used by a sports fan in [[Philadelphia]] to taunt rival teams with Native American mascots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nativeappropriations.com/2010/06/thanks-for-the-severed-head-youve-proved-my-point.html|title=Thanks for the severed head.

It was quickly condemned by both university presidents, who agreed that anyone wearing the shirt at a game would be ejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.wwmt.com/news/features/top-stories/stories/WMU-CMU-presidents-offer-swift-action-following-t-shirt-controversy-59232.shtml#.VHacPtab2Q4| title=WMU, CMU presidents offer swift action following t-shirt controversy| date=November 22, 2014| publisher=WWMT-TV}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of the [[University of North Dakota]] changing their nickname from the Fighting Sioux to the [[North Dakota Fighting Hawks|Fighting Hawks]], students at rival [[North Dakota State University]] (NDSU) continue to chant "Sioux suck shit" whenever their football team makes a first down. The NDSU president, along with the presidents of the student body and faculty senates, have called for an end to the practice, which they describe as hateful, and coming from a misplaced sense of tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.grandforksherald.com/news/4138709-ndsu-president-calls-end-hateful-sioux-chant-bison-football-games#.WAWqJt0tDBY.facebook| title=NDSU president calls for end of 'hateful' Sioux chant at Bison football games| author=Patrick Springer | date=October 17, 2016| publisher=Grand Forks Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some NDSU fans also wear T-shirts with graphics depicting variations on the "Sioux suck" theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/11/19/offensive-t-shirt-shows-ndsu-fans-cant-let-go-sioux-suck-chant-lives-166519| title=Offensive T-Shirt Shows NDSU Fans Can’t Let Go: ‘Sioux Suck’ Chant Lives On| author=Konnie LeMay| date=November 19, 2016| publisher=Indian Country TodayN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Varying degrees of offensiveness===
To further complicate this controversy, many feel that there are varying levels of offensiveness with team names and mascots. The nature and degree of stereotyping varies depending upon the name of the team, the logo, the mascot, and the behavior of fans. The greatest offense is taken when the logo and mascot are caricatures viewed as insulting, such as the [[Cleveland Indians]]' [[Chief Wahoo]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/news/features/index.cfm?recnum=5437|title=Coalition Of Religious Investors Fight Baseball Team Logo|date=July 10, 1997|accessdate=January 18, 2013|publisher=Catholic Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt; the name of the team is often regarded as a racial slur, such as [[redskin (slang)|Redskins]] or [[Squaw]]s;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dodgecountynews.com/archives/7311-Squaws-are-region-runner-upshost-first-round-of-state-Friday.html| title=Squaws are region runner-ups:host first round of state Friday| date=February 15, 2017 | accessdate=March 6, 2017| publisher=The Dodge County News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the behavior of the mascot or fans is based upon popular images of Indians which trivialize authentic native cultures; such as the tomahawk chop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.sbnation.com/mlb/2013/5/1/4292152/yeah-the-tomahawk-chop-bugs-me-heres-why| title=Yeah, the "Tomahawk Chop" bugs me. Here's why| first=Mike| last=Bates| date=May 1, 2013| publisher=SBNation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practices of individual schools and teams have changed in response to the controversy. A local example is [[Washington High School (Sioux Falls, South Dakota)|Washington High School]] in [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota]]. Many Native American images have been removed, and the "Warriors" nickname is now claimed to be generic. The school now has a "circle of courage" logo with eagle feathers and has also "updated" the murals of Chief [[Hollow Horn Bear]] in the gym. Duane Hollow Horn Bear, the chief's great-grandson, who teaches Lakota language and history at [[Sinte Gleska University]] in Mission, stated: "We had no objection to their utilizing those pictures as long as my great-grandfather was represented with honor and dignity." However, not all Native Americans are happy with the presence of any such images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.argusleader.com/story/opinion/columnists/stu-whitney/2015/01/17/whitney-sioux-falls-team-indian-nickname/21925163/| title=Does Washington High have nickname problem?| first=Stu| last=Whitney| date=January 17, 2015| publisher=Argus Leader}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teams outside the Americas===
{{further|List of sports team names and mascots derived from indigenous peoples}}
Native American names and images are used by teams in other countries, generally those playing American-style sports and copying the imagery of American teams. Several are in countries that also have a tradition of [[Native American hobbyism in Germany|Native American hobbyists]] often associated with the popularity of the stories written by German author [[Karl May]].&lt;ref name="NYTimes.2018.05.07"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/07/sports/native-american-mascots-europe.html| title=Tomahawk Chops and Indian Mascots: In Europe, Teams Don’t See a Problem| author=Andrew Keh| newspaper=The New York Times| date=May 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notes Africaines, Volume 81 (1959), pages 13-17&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Nyamakala'' originally implied any talented people, but as slavery, social differentiation and stratification increased with Islamic religious violence called [[jihad]]s, and later the colonial rule, their status fell to a lowly level below the nobles and free people.&lt;ref name="Alexander2010p79"/&gt; ''Nyama'' in the traditional Mandinka society implies "vital force", while ''Kala'' connotes "handle". Thus, any type of occupation that handled vital force of nature, were a Nyamakala.&lt;ref name="Alexander2010p79"/&gt; In its historic contexts, state Charles Bird, Martha Kendall and Kalilou Tera, ''Nyama'' has implied different meanings. In one, it connotes notions of "evil or satanic force, dangerous, polluting, energizing, imperfect self control" and in others it is "morally neutral or energizing".  In yet another context, ''Nyama'' implies "refuse, garbage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Charles Bird|author2=Martha Kendall|author3=Kalilou Tera|editor=David C. Conrad and Barbara E.

Among Mandinka, the ''Nyamakala'' occupational castes included ''Jeli'' or ''Jeliyu'' (musicians, griots), ''Numu'' (carpenters, smiths), ''Garanke'' (leather workers, weavers) and ''Fune'' or ''Finah'' (singers specializing in Islamic praise).&lt;ref name="Alexander2010p79"/&gt; The specific castes had different terms in other ethnic groups of West Africa. For example, among the Soninke people, the griots were called ''Gesere'', the smiths ''Tage'' and the carpenter caste was called ''Sake''.&lt;ref name="Alexander2010p79"/&gt;

Some scholars such as Vaughn state that while ''Nyamakala'' have been castes of West Africa, it necessarily does not mean imply a generic and uniform "caste system" because the social stratification in Africa was very complex with the inclusion of slaves, race and religious elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=JH Vaughn|title= Social Stratification in Africa| editor= Arthur Tuden and Leonard Plotnicov | publisher= Free Press| chapter= Caste System in the Western Sudan| isbn=978-0029327807|year=197|pages=59–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marguerite Dupire (1985), A Nomadic Caste: The Fulani Woodcarvers Historical Background and Evolution, Anthropos, Bd. 80, H. 1./3.

{{Distinguish|Pomaks}}
'''Pomors''' or '''Pomory''' ({{lang-rus|Помо́ры|p=pɐˈmorɨ}}, ''Seasiders'') are Russian settlers, primarily from [[Veliky Novgorod|Novgorod]], and their descendants  living on the [[White Sea]] coasts and the territory whose southern border lies on a watershed which separates the [[White Sea]] river basin from the basins of rivers that flow south.

==History==
As early as the 12th century, explorers from [[Novgorod]] entered the White Sea through the [[Northern Dvina]] and [[Onega River|Onega]] estuaries and founded settlements along the sea coasts of [[Bjarmaland]]. [[Kholmogory, Arkhangelsk Oblast|Kholmogory]] served as their chief town until the rise of [[Arkhangelsk]] in the late 16th century. From their base at [[Kola (town)|Kola]], they explored the [[Barents Region]] and the [[Kola peninsula]], and [[Novaya Zemlya]]. 

Later the Pomor discovered and maintained the [[Northern Sea Route]] between Arkhangelsk and [[Siberia]]. With their ships ([[koch (boat)|''koches'']]), the Pomors penetrated to the trans-[[Ural Mountains|Ural]] areas of Northern Siberia, where they founded the settlement of [[Mangazeya]] east of the [[Yamal Peninsula]] in the early 16th century. Tatyana Bratkova has reported that some historians speculate that in the early 17th century, Pomors settled the isolated village of [[Russkoye Ustye]] in the [[river delta|delta]] of the [[Indigirka]], in north-eastern [[Sakha Republic|Yakutia]].&lt;ref&gt;Tatyana Bratkova [http://magazines.russ.ru/novyi_mi/1998/4/brat.html "Russkoye Ustye"]. ''[[Novy Mir]],'' 1998, no. 4 {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Malye Korely.jpg|thumb|Malye Korely, a 17th-century Pomor village, 28 km east of Arkhangelsk]]

The name of the Pomors derives from the ''Pomorsky'' (literally, "maritime") coast of the White Sea (between [[Onega (town)|Onega]] and [[Kem, Russia|Kem]]), having the root of ''more'' ({{lang|ru|море}}, meaning "sea"; derived from an [[Indo-European root]]). The same root appears in the toponym [[Pomerania]] (Polish: ''Pomorze'', German: ''Pommern'').

The term ''Pomor,'' which in the 10th-12th centuries meant "a person who lived near sea", gradually was extended into one to apply to this population living relatively far away from the sea. Finally in the 15th century, the people became disconnected from the sea.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} The sea was not a major part of economy of this region.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} &lt;!-- surely the Pomory kept fishing and building their fishing boats way into the 20th century!? --&gt; At the same time, people began using the term Pomor'e to refer to a territory of practically the whole European Russian North, including the [[Murmansk]], [[Arkhangelsk]] and [[Vologda]] regions; and [[Karelia]] and [[Komi Republic|Komi]] republics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pomor-rus.org/eng/pomory_english.htm  Pomors and Pomor'e]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The traditional livelihoods of the Pomor based on the sea included animal hunting, [[whaling]] and fishing; in [[tundra]] regions they practiced [[reindeer]] herding. The Pomor [[Pomor trade|traded by sea]] in corn and fish with Northern [[Norway]], which became important to both sides. This trade was so intensive that a kind of Russian-Norwegian [[pidgin language]] ''Moja på tvoja'' (or [[Russenorsk]]) developed on the North Norwegian coast that was used from 1750–1920. 

[[File:Крестьяне-деревни-Юромы.jpg|thumb|left|Pomor village, early 20th century]]

In the 12-15th centuries, Pomor'e was considered an extensive colony of the state of [[Great Novgorod]]. By the early 16th century the annexation of Pomor'e by [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Moscow]] was completed. In the 17th century, in 22 Pomor'e districts the great bulk of the population consisted of free peasants. A portion of the land belonged to monasteries and to the Stroganov merchants. There were no landlords in Pomor'e. The population of Pomor'e districts was engaged in fishing, mica and salt production (Sol'-Kamskay, Sol'- Vychegodskay, Tot'ma, etc.) and other enterprises. [[File:Церковь в деревне Матигоры у Холмогор.jpg|thumb|A 17th-century Pomor church near [[Kholmogory]]]]

Although in the 21st century, some people identify as "Pomor" or of "Pomor origin", this is a new phenomenon.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} &lt;!-- Why new? Surely Lomonosov's parents could call themselves "Pomors" - just as they would also call themselves Russians, of course. --&gt; The Russian ''[[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary]],'' in its 1890-1907 edition, classified Pomors as Great Russians or referred to them as Russian traders and trappers of the North. To date, no encyclopedia or encyclopedic dictionary refers to the Pomor as a separate ethnic group.

In the 2002 [[Russian Census (2002)|census]], respondents had the option to identify as "Pomors", this group being tabulated by the census as a subgroup of the [[Russians|Russian]] ethnicity. However, only 6,571 persons did so, almost all of them in [[Arkhangelsk Oblast]] (6,295) and [[Murmansk Oblast]] (127).

Like most other Russians, Pomors have traditionally been [[Orthodox Christians]] in faith. Prior to the [[Revolution of 1917]] a large percentage of Russians from Pomorje (or Pomors) were practicing [[Old Believers]].

==Notable Pomor==

*[[Yerofey Khabarov]],{{cn|date=October 2015}} born in [[Veliky Ustyug]]

==Present day use of the name==
One of the three universities of Arkhangelsk was named the Pomor State University (now merged into [[Northern (Arctic) Federal University]]).
In line with the current Russian trend towards amalgamating the least populated or poorest [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subjects]] into larger entities, a merger of Arkhangelsk and Murmansk Oblasts, the [[Komi Republic]], and the [[Nenets Autonomous Okrug]] has been [[Federal subjects of Russia#Mergers|proposed]], one of the possible names of this new territory being the Pomor Krai{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}.

==The Pomortsy==
The Pomors should not be confused with the [[Pomortsy]]: members of an [[Old Believer]] group which arose in the late 17th century in northern Russia, and have since been represented by small communities throughout Russia and adjacent countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7435">'''Pwo''' is a [[sacred]] [[initiation ritual]], in which students of [[Polynesian navigation|traditional navigation]] in the [[Caroline Islands]] in [[Micronesia]] become master navigators and are initiated in the associated secrets. Many islanders in the area indicate that this ceremony originated on the island of [[Pollap]], or nearby islands.

The ''Pwo'' today is having a comeback in importance.  In the days before [[World War II]], it was common to have ''Pwo'' take place.  After WWII, through [[westernization]] and the influence of [[Missionary|missionaries]] traditional practices including ''Pwo'' started to be abandoned.  [[Mau Piailug]], famous for helping [[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiians]] regain their traditional navigation skills, was the last person to go through ''Pwo'', in 1951.  For thirty-nine years, the ceremony lay dormant.  Then, in May 1990, ''Pwo'' again took place.  This time Urupiy, a master navigator, with help of an American documentary [[Anthropology|anthropologist]], [[Eric Metzgar]], conducted the ''Pwo'' for his son and four other students on the island of [[Lamotrek]].  This event was subsequently made into the film ''Spirits of the Voyage''.

On March 18, 2007, Piailug presided over the first Pwo ceremony for navigators on the island of [[Satawal]] in 56 years. At the event five native Hawaiians and eleven others were inducted into Pwo as master navigators. The [[Polynesian Voyaging Society]] presented Piailug a [[Outrigger canoe|double-hulled canoe]], the ''[[Alingano Maisu]]'', as a gift for his key role in reviving traditional [[wayfinding]] navigation in [[Hawaii]].

Then on March 2008, Piailug presided the Pwo ceremony for Maori navigator [[Hector Busby|Hekenukumai Nga Iwi Busby]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maoritelevision.com/programmes/news/native_affairs/episodes/2008/NativeAffairs%20Ep5-The%20Navigator-260508.htm Maori Television "The Navigator"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604225007/http://www.maoritelevision.com/programmes/news/native_affairs/episodes/2008/NativeAffairs%20Ep5-The%20Navigator-260508.htm |date=June 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

“First of all, ''ppwo'' is the esoteric art of navigation ... Secondly, those who are adept at the esoteric art of navigation are also called ''ppwo''.  Thirdly, initiating others in this esoteric art of navigation is also known as ''ppwo'' ...

The most important event in a young navigator's life, it not only marked his passage into manhood, but also gained him entrance to a select and privileged class and gave him the right to learn secret, mystical, navigational lore.

"...the notion of performing the ''pwo'' rites gradually gained acceptance and in May 1990, for the first time in over forty years, a few individuals who had been studying and practicing traditional navigational techniques for many years were 'graduated' on Lamotrek and officially recognized by the community-at-large."

"...the name for the island, Pwollap, supposedly means the center, or origin, of navigation:  ''ppwo'' means "to be initiated as a navigator" and ''lap'' means "big" or "important." This belief is a source of considerable pride for the island, and Pulapese derive self-esteem from knowing that Puluwat and other islanders acknowledge that navigation originated on Pulap."

"The last ''pwo'' ceremony had been performed on Satawal about forty years earlier, between 1950-1952.  Since then this navigator rite of passage had come closer and closer to extinction with the demise of master navigators qualified to transmit the restricted navigational knowledge and chants which, by ancient custom, were only to be taught after apprentices were initiated in the ''pwo'' ceremony."

"''Pwo'' is the equivalent to a graduate doctorate degree in knowledge of traditional navigation and involves additional instruction in the more esoteric-related aspects of traditional navigation such as chants for calling upon patron spirits."

'''''QuestaGame''''', launched in 2014 in Canberra, Australia, is a [[mobile app]] game for photographing and identifying fauna, flora, and fungi. Sightings are verified by experts and gain points for players. The game leverages [[citizen science]] to help document species occurrences, adding data to databases such as [[Atlas of Living Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://collections.ala.org.au/public/show/dp52|title=QuestaGame - Atlas of Living Australia|last=Australia|first=Atlas of Living|website=collections.ala.org.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mywildaustralia.wordpress.com/tag/QuestaGame/|title=QuestaGame – My Wild Australia|website=mywildaustralia.wordpress.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-05-28/kids-citizen-scientists-new-app-feed-aust-species-database/8557814|title=Kids sign up as citizen scientists with new app that feeds Australian species database|date=2017-05-28|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-08-12|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.discoverycircle.org.au/QuestaGame-a-fun-game-to-engage-kids-to-engage-with-nature/|title=QuestaGame: a fun game to engage kids to engage with nature - Discovery Circle|website=www.discoverycircle.org.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ranger Vision is a classroom version.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ranger.vision/the-product|title=The Product|website=Ranger Vision|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
To play the game, players submit sightings and/or identify the sightings of other players.&lt;ref name=QBbasics&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://QuestaGame.com/thebasics/|title=Quick Guide - How to Play|website=questagame.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game defines sightings as documentation of a wild (not captive or domesticated) living organism. Players earn gold and increase their species collections, which are recorded on a leaderboard. Players can use gold to purchase better "equipment" and "supplies." The level of equipment rating determines the speed and detail that sightings are identified by other players, while supplies allow players to join and create quests.&lt;ref name=QBfaq&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://questagame.com/faq/|title=QuestaGame Frequently Asked Questions|website=questagame.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Players can join clans and compete with others in quests and challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scienceweek.net.au/the-great-australian-biodiversity-challenge-and-other-nature-events/|title=The Great Australian Biodiversity Challenge and other nature events|website=National Science Week|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many clans join together to form tribes.&lt;ref name=QBfaq/&gt;

===Species identification model===
The founder of QuestaGame, Andrew Robinson, advocates for "collective intelligence," where the knowledge of humans is used for species identification, rather than [[automated species identification]] through [[machine learning]].&lt;ref name=robinson2016&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/questanotes/QuestaGame-now-rewards-wildlife-expertise-with-pays-to-know-program-2056876ccfa6|title=QuestaGame Now Rewards Wildlife Expertise with “Pays-to-Know” Program|last=Robinson|first=Andrew|date=2016-11-20|website=Medium|access-date=2018-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson describes QuestaGame's “Pays-to-Know” program, which results in earnings going to a scientific institution of the experts' choice, as a means to leverage the value of environmental knowledge and possibly help to create meaningful jobs.&lt;ref name=robinson2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=bioexpertise&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://QuestaGame.com/a-guide-to-the-bio-expertise-engine/|title=Welcome to our new Bio-Expertise Engine|website=QuestaGame.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===World BioQuest===
In 2017 QuestaGame reported results from its World BioQuest 20-22 May 2017: 11,646 observations, 2,440 photos, 9,403 identifications and 689 species.&lt;ref name=bioquest&gt;{{cite web |title=First Ever World BioQuest Results |url=https://questagame.com/world-bioquest-competition-results |website=QuestaGame |publisher=QuestaGame |accessdate=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winning World BioQuest Champion was a player named Austin. The highest scoring single sighting was an image of a stick insect (''[[Onchestus gorgus]]''), by QuestaGamer Ben Revell. The stick insect was identified by Dr. Paul Brock of the Natural History Museum, London, as the first photographic record of the species on major biodiversity databases. "Best Photo" was a Brown Tree Snake (''[[Boiga irregularis]]'') by Ben Revell.

==Distribution==
In Raoping County, Hakka is spoken in the north, including the towns of Shangshan, Shangrao, Raoyang, Jiucun, Jianrao, and Xinfeng, as well as some villages in Hanjiang Forest Farm. As of 2005, there are 190,000 Hakka speakers in Raoping County (19% of the county's population).&lt;ref name="Raoping Xianzhi"/&gt;

Late communism produced sizable, specific middle classes of relatively well-educated professionals, technicians and even highly skilled blue-collar workers. [...] These classes had no attachment whatsoever to Marxist-Leninist ideology, while they became attracted to the Western way of life. Many members of the ruling 'nomenklatura' shared the same sentiments, as Western consumerism and individualism seemed more attractive to them than communist collective Puritanism. There were two very important consequences of this, one economic, and the second political. The economic one was the attractiveness of consumerism [...].

The '''Revolutions of 1989''' formed part of a [[revolutionary wave]] in the late 1980s and early 1990s that resulted in the end of communist rule in [[Central and Eastern Europe]] and beyond.

One feature common to most of these developments was the extensive use of campaigns of [[civil resistance]], demonstrating popular opposition to the continuation of [[one-party rule]] and contributing to the pressure for change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = Adam Roberts (scholar) | first = Adam | last = Roberts | title = Civil Resistance in the East European and Soviet Revolutions | publisher = Albert Einstein Institution | year = 1991 | ISBN = 1-880813-04-1 | format = [[Portable document format|PDF]] | url = http://www.aeinstein.org/organizationse3a7.html | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110130071418/http://www.aeinstein.org/organizationse3a7.html | archivedate = 30 January 2011 | df = dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Romania was the only [[Eastern Bloc]] country whose citizens overthrew its [[Communist regime]] violently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Sztompka | first = Piotr | author-link = Piotr Sztompka | chapter = Preface | title = Society in Action: the Theory of Social Becoming | publisher = University of Chicago Press | ISBN = 0-226-78815-6 | url = https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;vid=ISBN0226788156&amp;id=sdSw3FgVOS4C&amp;pg=PP16 | page = x}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Protests in Tiananmen Square]] (April–June 1989) failed to stimulate major political changes in [[China]], but [[tank man|influential images]] of courageous defiance during that protest helped to precipitate events in other parts of the globe. On 4 June 1989, the trade union [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] won an overwhelming victory in a [[Polish legislative election, 1989|partially free election in Poland]], leading to the peaceful fall of Communism in that country in the summer of 1989. Also in June 1989, Hungary began dismantling its section of the physical [[Iron Curtain]], leading to an exodus of East Germans through Hungary, which destabilised East Germany. This led to mass demonstrations in cities such as [[Leipzig]] and subsequently to the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in November 1989, which served as the symbolic gateway to [[German reunification]] in 1990.

The [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union dissolved]] in December 1991, resulting in eleven new countries ([[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Belarus]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Moldova]], [[Russia]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Uzbekistan]]) which had declared their independence from the Soviet Union in the course of the year while the [[Baltic states]] ([[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]) [[Occupation of the Baltic states|regained]] their independence in September 1991. The rest of the Soviet Union, which constituted the bulk of the area, became the [[Russian Federation]] in December 1991. [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]] and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] abandoned Communism between 1990 and 1992. By 1992, Yugoslavia had split into five successor states, namely [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Croatia]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Slovenia]] and the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], which was later renamed [[Serbia and Montenegro]] in 2003 and eventually split in 2006 into two states, namely [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]]. Serbia was then further split with the breakaway of the [[International recognition of Kosovo|partially recognised]] state of [[Kosovo]] in 2008. [[Czechoslovakia]] dissolved three years after the end of Communist rule, splitting peacefully into the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.cecl.gr/RigasNetwork/databank/Constitutions/Yugoslavia.html | publisher = CECL |date=1992-04-27 | accessdate = 2013-08-12 | place = [[Greece|GR]] | title = Constitution | contribution = Yugoslavia}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The impact of these events made itself felt in several [[Socialist countries]]. Communism was abandoned in countries such as [[People's Republic of Kampuchea#Transition and State of Cambodia (1989–1992)|Cambodia]] (1991), [[People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia|Ethiopia]] (1990), [[People's Republic of Mongolia|Mongolia]] (which in 1990 [[Mongolian legislative election, 1990|democratically re-elected]] a Communist government that ran the country until [[Mongolian legislative election, 1996|1996]]) and [[South Yemen]] (1990).

During the adoption of varying forms of [[market economy]], there was a [[1990s#Economics|general decline in living standards]] for many former Communist countries.&lt;ref name="Living standards CR"&gt;{{cite book|title= Vývoj vybraných ukazatelů životní úrovně v České republice v letech 1993&amp;nbsp;– 2008| year = 2009 | publisher= Odbor analýz a statistiky. Ministerstvo práce a sociálních věcí ČR |location= Praha|url= http://www.mpsv.cz/files/clanky/7421/ukazatele_zivotni_urovne.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political reforms were varied, but in only four countries were Communist parties able to retain a monopoly on power, namely China, [[Cuba]], [[Laos]] and [[Vietnam]] ([[North Korea]] went through a [[Constitution of North Korea#2009 Songun Constitution|constitutional change]] in 2009 that made it nominally no longer Communist, but still ''de facto'' organised on [[Stalinist]] lines). Many communist and socialist organisations in the West turned their guiding principles over to [[social democracy]] and [[democratic socialism]]. Communist parties in [[Italy]] and [[San Marino]] suffered and the [[Mani Pulite|reformation of the Italian political class]] took place in the early 1990s. In [[South America]], the [[Pink tide]] had instead begun, starting with [[Venezuela]] in 1999 and sweeping through the early 2000s. The [[Politics of Europe|European political landscape]] changed drastically, with several former Eastern Bloc countries joining [[NATO]] and the [[European Union]], resulting in stronger economic and social integration with Western Europe and the [[United States]].

[[File:Kolejka.jpeg|thumb|Queue waiting to enter a store, a typical view in [[History of Poland (1945–1989)|Poland in the 1980s]]]]
[[Socialism]] had been gaining momentum among working class citizens of the world since the 19th century. These culminated in the early 20th century when several [[State (polity)|states]] and [[colonies]] formed their own [[communist parties]]. Many of the countries involved had [[hierarchical structure]]s with [[monarchic]] governments and [[aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] social structures with an established [[nobility]]. Socialism was undesirable within the circles of the [[ruling class]]es (which had begun to include industrial business leaders) in the late 19th/early 20th century states; as such, [[communism]] was repressed. Its champions suffered persecution while people were discouraged from adopting it. This had been the practice even in states which identified as exercising a multi-party system.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 saw the first [[communist state]] in the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR), when the [[Bolsheviks]] overthrew the [[Russian Provisional Government|provisional government]].

During the period between the world wars, communism had been on the rise in many parts of the world, especially in towns and cities. This led to a series of purges in many countries to stifle the movement. Violent resistance to this repression led to an increase in support for communism in Central and Eastern Europe.

In the early stages of [[World War II]], both Nazi Germany and the USSR invaded and occupied the countries of Eastern Europe after the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]]. Germany then turned against and invaded the USSR: the battles of this [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] were the largest in history. The USSR joined with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and in conferences at [[Tehran Conference|Tehran]] and [[Yalta Conference|Yalta]], the Allies agreed that Central and Eastern Europe would be in the "Soviet sphere of political influence.". The USSR fought the Germans to a standstill and finally began driving them back, reaching Berlin before the end of the war. Nazi ideology was violently [[anti-communist]], and the Nazis brutally suppressed communist movements in the countries it occupied. Communists played a large part in the [[Resistance during World War II|resistance to the Nazis]] in these countries. As the Soviets forced the Germans back, they assumed temporary control of these devastated areas.

After World War II, the Soviets ensured that communists loyal to Moscow took power in the countries it occupied. The Soviets retained troops throughout these territories. The [[Cold War]] saw these states, bound together by the [[Warsaw Pact]], have continuing tensions with the capitalist west, bound together by [[NATO]]. The [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|Chinese Revolution]] established communism in [[China]] in 1949.

During the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], a spontaneous nationwide anti-authoritarian revolt, the Soviet Union invaded Hungary to assert control. Similarly, in 1968, the USSR repressed the [[Prague Spring]] by organizing the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]].

=== Emergence of Solidarity in Poland ===
{{main|Solidarity (Polish trade union)}}
Labour turmoil in Poland during 1980 had led to the formation of the independent [[trade union]], [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]], led by [[Lech Wałęsa]], which over time became a political force. On 13 December 1981, Polish Prime Minister [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]] started a crackdown on Solidarity by declaring [[martial law in Poland]], suspending the union, and temporarily imprisoning all of its leaders.

=== Mikhail Gorbachev ===
{{main|Mikhail Gorbachev|Perestroika|Glasnost|Democratisation in the Soviet Union}}
Although several Eastern bloc countries had attempted some abortive, limited economic and political reform since the 1950s (e.g. the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] and [[Prague Spring]] of 1968), the ascension of reform-minded Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in 1985 signaled the trend toward greater liberalization. During the mid-1980s, a younger generation of Soviet [[apparatchiks]], led by Gorbachev, began advocating fundamental reform in order to reverse years of [[Brezhnev stagnation]]. After decades of growth, the Soviet Union was now facing a period of severe economic decline and needed Western technology and credits{{clarify|date=March 2017}} to make up for its increasing backwardness. The costs of maintaining its military, the [[KGB]], subsidies to foreign client states etc., further strained the moribund [[Soviet economy]].

The first signs of major reform came in 1986 when Gorbachev launched a policy of ''[[glasnost]]'' (openness) in the Soviet Union, and emphasized the need for ''[[perestroika]]'' (economic restructuring). By the spring of 1989, the Soviet Union had not only experienced lively media debate, but had also held its first multi-candidate elections in the newly established [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union|Congress of People's Deputies]]. While glasnost ostensibly advocated openness and political criticism, these were only permitted within a narrow spectrum dictated by the state. The general public in the [[Eastern bloc]] was still subject to [[secret police]] and political repression.

Gorbachev urged his Central and Southeast European counterparts to imitate ''perestroika'' and ''glasnost'' in their own countries. However, while reformists in Hungary and Poland were emboldened by the force of liberalization spreading from the east, other [[Eastern bloc]] countries remained openly skeptical and demonstrated aversion to reform. Believing Gorbachev's reform initiatives would be short-lived, hardline communist rulers like [[East Germany]]'s [[Erich Honecker]], Bulgaria's [[Todor Zhivkov]], Czechoslovakia's [[Gustáv Husák]] and Romania's [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] obstinately ignored the calls for change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://countrystudies.us/romania/75.htm | contribution = Romania – Soviet Union and Eastern Europe | place = US | publisher = Library of Congress | title = Country studies}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "When your neighbor puts up new wallpaper, it doesn't mean you have to too," declared one East German politburo member.&lt;ref name = "Steele" /&gt;

== Leadup to revolution ==
By the late 1980s, people in the [[Caucasus]] and [[Baltic states]] were demanding more autonomy from [[Moscow]], and the Kremlin was losing some of its control over certain regions and elements in the [[Soviet Union]]. In November 1988, the [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic]] issued a [[Estonian Sovereignty Declaration|declaration of sovereignty]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-11-17/news/mn-458_1_soviet-union|title=Parliament in Estonia Declares 'Sovereignty'|work=latimes}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would eventually lead to other states making similar declarations of autonomy.

The [[Chernobyl disaster]] in April 1986 had major political and social effects that catalyzed or at least partially caused the revolutions of 1989. One political result of the disaster was the greatly increased significance of the new Soviet policy of [[glasnost]].&lt;ref name="ShlyGlasnost"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00139157.1992.9931445 |title=Chernobyl andGlasnost: The Effects of Secrecy on Health and Safety |year=1992 |last1=Shlyakhter |first1=Alexander |last2=Wilson |first2=Richard |journal=Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development |volume=34 |issue=5 |pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PetrynaSarc"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1525/can.1995.10.2.02a00030 |title=Sarcophagus: Chernobyl in Historical Light |year=1995 |last1=Petryna |first1=Adriana |journal=Cultural Anthropology |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is difficult to establish the total economic cost of the disaster. According to Gorbachev, the Soviet Union spent 18 billion rubles (the equivalent of US$18 billion at that time) on containment and decontamination, virtually bankrupting itself.&lt;ref name="GorbachevBoC"&gt;Gorbachev, Mikhail (1996), interview in Johnson, Thomas, ''{{YouTube|dd-QBnAd5qY|The Battle of Chernobyl}}'', [film], Discovery Channel, retrieved 19 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regime changes outside of Eastern Europe ==
{{see also|Third Wave Democracy}}
In February 1986, in one of the first peaceful, mass-movement revolutions against a dictatorship, the [[People Power Revolution]] in the [[Philippines]] peacefully overthrew dictator [[Ferdinand Marcos]] and inaugurated [[Cory Aquino]] as president.

The [[domino effect]] of the revolutions of 1989 affected other regimes as well. The [[South Africa]]n [[apartheid]] regime and [[Pinochet]]'s [[military dictatorship]] in Chile were gradually dismantled during the 1990s as the West withdrew their funding and diplomatic support. [[Argentina]], [[Ghana]], [[Indonesia]], [[Nicaragua]], [[South Korea]], [[Suriname]], [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan), and [[North Yemen|North]] and [[South Yemen]], among many others, elected democratic governments.

Exact tallies of the number of democracies vary depending on the criteria used for assessment, but by some measures by the late 1990s there were well over 100 democracies in the world, a marked increase in just a few decades.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

== Solidarity's impact grows ==
{{main|Solidarity (Polish trade union)}}
[[File:WieczorWroclawia20marca1981.jpg|thumb|20–21 March 1981, issue of ''Wieczór Wrocławia'' (''This Evening in [[Wrocław]]'') shows blank spaces remaining after the government censor pulled articles from page 1 (right, "What happened at [[Bydgoszcz]]?") and from the last page (left, "Country-wide strike alert"), leaving only their titles as the printers—[[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity-trade-union]] members—decided to run the newspaper with blank spaces intact and the bottom of page 1 of this master copy bears the hand-written Solidarity confirmation of that decision]]

Throughout the mid-1980s, [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] persisted solely as an underground organization, supported by the Catholic Church. However, by the late 1980s, Solidarity became sufficiently strong to frustrate [[Wojciech Jaruzelski|Jaruzelski's]] attempts at reform, and [[1988 Polish strikes|nationwide strikes in 1988]] forced the government to open dialogue with Solidarity. On 9 March 1989, both sides agreed to a [[bicameral legislature]] called the [[National Assembly (Poland)|National Assembly]]. The already existing [[Sejm]] would become the lower house. The Senate would be elected by the people. Traditionally a ceremonial office, the presidency was given more powers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.2facts.com Poland:Major Political Reform Agreed], ''Facts on File World News Digest'', 24 March 1989. Facts on File News Services. 6 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Polish Round Table Agreement]]).

By 1989, the Soviet Union had repealed the [[Brezhnev Doctrine]] in favor of non-intervention in the internal affairs of its [[Warsaw Pact]] allies, termed the [[Sinatra Doctrine]] in a joking reference to the [[Frank Sinatra]] song "[[My Way (song)|My Way]]". Poland became the first Warsaw Pact country to break free of Soviet domination.

== National political movements ==
=== China ===
{{main|Tiananmen Square protests of 1989}}
New Chinese leader [[Deng Xiaoping]] (1982–1987) developed the concept of [[socialism with Chinese characteristics]] and local [[Socialist market economy|market economy]] around 1984, but the policy stalled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | date = 3 February 2012 | url = http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90780/7719657.html | title = 'Market fundamentalism' is unpractical | newspaper = People's Daily | publisher = Central Committee of the Communist Party | place = [[China|CN]] | accessdate = 13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Chinese student demonstrations, which directly preceded the Beijing protests of 1989, took place in December 1986 in [[Hefei]]. The students called for campus elections, the chance to study abroad and greater availability of Western pop culture. Their protests took advantage of the loosening political atmosphere and included rallies against the slow pace of reform. [[Hu Yaobang]], a protégé of Deng Xiaoping and a leading advocate of reform, was blamed for the protests and forced to resign as the CCP general secretary in January 1987. In the "Anti Bourgeois Liberalization Campaign", Hu would be further denounced.

The Tiananmen Square protests were sparked by the death of Hu Yaobang on 15 April 1989. By the eve of Hu's state funeral, some 100,000 students had gathered at [[Tiananmen Square]] to observe it; however, no leaders emerged from the [[Great Hall of the People|Great Hall]]. The movement lasted for seven weeks.&lt;ref name= "Zhao153"&gt;{{Citation | first = Dingxin | last = Zhao | title = The Power of Tiananmen: State-Society Relations and the 1989 Beijing Student Movement | place = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | year = 2001 | ISBN = 0-226-98260-2 | page = 153}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gorbachev's visit to China on 15 May during the protests brought many foreign news agencies to Beijing, and their sympathetic portrayals of the protesters helped galvanize a spirit of liberation among the Central, South-East and Eastern Europeans who were watching. The Chinese leadership, particularly Communist Party general secretary [[Zhao Ziyang]], having begun earlier than the Soviets to radically reform the economy, was open to political reform, but not at the cost of a potential return to the disorder of the [[Cultural Revolution]].

The movement lasted from Hu's death on 15 April until tanks rolled into Tiananmen Square on 4 June 1989. In Beijing, the military response to the protest by the PRC government left many civilians in charge of clearing the square of the dead and severely injured. The exact number of casualties is not known and many different estimates exist.

On 7 July 1989, President Mikhail Gorbachev implicitly renounced the use of force against other Soviet-bloc nations. Speaking to members of the 23-nation Council of Europe, Mr. Gorbachev made no direct reference to the so-called [[Brezhnev Doctrine]], under which Moscow has asserted the right to use force to prevent a Warsaw Pact member from leaving the Communist fold, but stated 'Any interference in domestic affairs and any attempts to restrict the sovereignty of states—friends, allies or any others—are inadmissible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/07/world/gorbachev-spurns-the-use-of-force-in-eastern-europe.html?scp=714&amp;sq=Hungary&amp;st=nyt&amp;gwh=8324637C96A56F9E0671EC017DB71D98 | work=The New York Times | first=James M. | last = Markham | title=Gorbachev spurns the use of force in Eastern Europe | date=7 July 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lech Walesa George H Bush.PNG|thumb|Solidarity Chairman [[Lech Wałęsa]] (center) with President [[George H. W. Bush]] (right) and Barbara Bush (left) in Warsaw, July 1989]]
A [[1988 Polish strikes|wave of strikes]] hit Poland in April and May 1988, and a second wave began on 15 August that year when a strike broke out at the [[July Manifesto]] coal mine in [[Jastrzębie-Zdrój]], the workers demanding the re-legalisation of [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]]. Over the next few days, sixteen other mines went on strike followed by a number of shipyards, including on 22 August, the [[Gdansk Shipyard]], famous as the epicentre of the [[History of Solidarity|1980 industrial unrest]] that spawned Solidarity.{{Sfn | Wałęsa | 1991 | p = 151}} On 31 August 1988 [[Lech Wałęsa]], the leader of Solidarity, was invited to Warsaw by the Communist authorities, who had finally agreed to talks.{{Sfn | Wałęsa | 1991 | p = 157}} On 18 January 1989 at a stormy session of the Tenth Plenary Session of the ruling [[Polish United Workers' Party|United Workers' Party]], General [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]], the First Secretary, managed to get party backing for formal negotiations with Solidarity leading to its future legalisation, although this was achieved only by threatening the resignation of the entire party leadership if thwarted.{{Sfn | Wałęsa | 1991 | p = 174}} On 6 February 1989 formal Round Table discussions began in the Hall of Columns in Warsaw. On 4 April 1989 the historic [[Polish Round Table Agreement|Round Table Agreement]] was signed legalising Solidarity and setting up partly free [[Polish legislative election, 1989|parliamentary elections]] to be held on 4 June 1989 (incidentally, the day following the midnight crackdown on Chinese protesters in Tiananmen Square). A political earthquake followed. The victory of Solidarity surpassed all predictions. Solidarity candidates captured all the seats they were allowed to compete for in the [[Sejm]], while in the [[Senate of Poland|Senate]] they captured 99 out of the 100 available seats (with the one remaining seat taken by an independent candidate). At the same time, many prominent Communist candidates failed to gain even the minimum number of votes required to capture the seats that were reserved for them.

On 15 August 1989, the Communists' two longtime coalition partners, the [[United People's Party (Poland)|United People's Party]] (ZSL) and the [[Democratic Party (Poland)|Democratic Party]] (SD), broke their alliance with the PZPR and announced their support for Solidarity. The last Communist Prime Minister of Poland, General [[Czesław Kiszczak]], said he would resign to allow a non-Communist to form an administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/15/world/poland-s-premier-offering-to-yield-to-non-communist.html?scp=187&amp;sq=Poland&amp;st=nyt&amp;gwh=1619ADC23679717BAA7BEEB89D42F7C7 | work=The New York Times | first=John | last=Tagliabue | title=Poland's premier offering to yield to non-Communist | date=15 August 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Solidarity was the only other political grouping that could possibly form a government, it was virtually assured that a Solidarity member would become prime minister. On 19 August 1989, in a stunning watershed moment, [[Tadeusz Mazowiecki]], an anti-Communist editor, Solidarity supporter, and devout Catholic, was nominated as Prime Minister of Poland and the Soviet Union voiced no protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/20/weekinreview/a-new-orbit-poland-s-break-leads-europe-and-communism-to-a-threshold.html?scp=825&amp;sq=Hungary&amp;st=nyt&amp;gwh=6C7A9946FB31BA34FCA893628C2ECB2B | work= The New York Times | first=R.

Following Poland's lead, Hungary was next to switch to a non-Communist government. Although Hungary had achieved some lasting economic reforms and limited political liberalization during the 1980s, major reforms only occurred following the replacement of [[János Kádár]] as General Secretary of the Communist Party on 23 May 1988 with [[Károly Grósz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/23/world/hungarian-party-replaces-kadar-with-his-premier.html?scp=135&amp;sq=Hungary&amp;st=nyt&amp;gwh=E283E53C9144CEB5DC839A7740A35E80 | work=The New York Times | first=Henry | last=Kamm | title=Hungarian Party replace Kadar with his premier | date= 23 May 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 November 1988 [[Miklós Németh]] was appointed Prime Minister.

Mass demonstrations on 15 March, the National Day, persuaded the regime to begin negotiations with the emergent non-Communist political forces. [[Hungarian Round Table Talks|Round Table talks]] began on 22 April and continued until the Round Table agreement was signed on 18 September. The talks involved the Communists (MSzMP) and the newly emerging independent political forces [[Fidesz – Hungarian Civic Union|Fidesz]], the [[Alliance of Free Democrats]] (SzDSz), the [[Hungarian Democratic Forum]] (MDF), the [[Independent Smallholders, Agrarian Workers and Civic Party|Independent Smallholders' Party]], the [[National Peasant Party (Hungary)|Hungarian People's Party]], the Endre Bajcsy-Zsilinszky Society, and the Democratic Trade Union of Scientific Workers. At a later stage the [[Democratic Confederation of Free Trade Unions]] and the [[Christian Democratic People's Party (Hungary)|Christian Democratic People's Party]] (KDNP) were invited.{{Sfn | Falk | 2003 | p = 147}} It was at the talks that a number of Hungary's future political leaders emerged, including [[László Sólyom]], [[József Antall]], [[György Szabad]], [[Péter Tölgyessy]] and [[Viktor Orbán]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = József | last = Bayer | contribution-url =  http://www.europainstitut.hu/pdf/bayer22.pdf | contribution = The Process of Political System Change in Hungary | title = Schriftenreihe | publisher = Europa Institutes | place = Budapest, [[Hungary|HU]] | year = 2003 | page = 180}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 May 1989, the first visible cracks in the [[Iron Curtain]] appeared when [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]] began [[Removal of Hungary's border fence with Austria|dismantling its {{convert |240|km| adj =on}} long border fence with Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Stokes | first = G | title = The Walls Came Tumbling Down | page = 131 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | year = 1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This increasingly destabilized the [[East Germany|GDR]] and [[Czechoslovakia]] over the summer and autumn as thousands of their citizens illegally crossed over to the West through the Hungarian-Austrian border.

The Round Table agreement of 18 September encompassed six draft laws that covered an overhaul of the [[Constitution of Hungary|Constitution]], establishment of a [[Constitutional Court of Hungary|Constitutional Court]], the functioning and management of political parties, multiparty elections for National Assembly deputies, the penal code and the law on penal procedures (the last two changes represented an additional separation of the Party from the state apparatus).{{Sfn | Heenan | Lamontagne | 1999 | p = 13}}{{Sfn | De Nevers | 2003 | p = 130}} The electoral system was a compromise: about half of the deputies would be elected proportionally and half by the majoritarian system.{{Sfn | Elster | Offe | Preuss | 1998 | p = 66}} A weak presidency was also agreed upon, but no consensus was attained on who should elect the president (parliament or the people) and when this election should occur (before or after parliamentary elections). On 7 October 1989, the Communist Party at its last congress re-established itself as the [[Hungarian Socialist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/08/world/communist-party-in-hungary-votes-for-radical-shift.html?scp=28&amp;sq=Hungary&amp;st=nyt&amp;gwh=8A34A86DC90090167E32320BB95CB02F | work = The New York Times | first=Henry | last=Kamm | title=Communist party in Hungary votes for radical shift | date=8 October 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a historic session from 16 to 20 October, the parliament adopted legislation providing for multi-party parliamentary elections and a direct presidential election, which took place on [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 1990|March 24, 1990]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/19/world/hungary-purges-stalinism-from-its-constitution.html?scp=61&amp;sq=Hungary&amp;st=nyt&amp;gwh=142906DE0FC1FFA303D77A84282021BB | work = The New York Times | title = Hungary Purges Stalinism From Its Constitution | date= 19 October 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation transformed Hungary from a [[People's Republic]] into the [[Republic of Hungary]], guaranteed human and civil rights, and created an institutional structure that ensured separation of powers among the judicial, legislative, and executive branches of government.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/20/world/hungary-legalizes-opposition-groups.html?scp=68&amp;sq=Hungary&amp;st=nyt&amp;gwh=57F88FEB3671803C0BA623ABE2583F4C | work=The New York Times | title=Hungary legalizes opposition groups | date= 20 October 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 October 1989, on the 33rd anniversary of the 1956 Revolution, the Communist regime in Hungary was formally abolished.

=== East Germany ===
{{main|Die Wende|German reunification|Peaceful Revolution}}
[[File:BerlinWall-BrandenburgGate.jpg|thumb|[[Berlin Wall]] at the [[Brandenburg Gate]], 10 November 1989]]
On 2 May 1989, Hungary started dismantling its barbed-wire border with [[Austria]], opening a large hole through the Iron Curtain to the West that was used by a growing number of East Germans. By the end of September 1989, more than 30,000 East Germans had escaped to the West before the GDR denied travel to Hungary, leaving the CSSR ([[Czechoslovakia]]) as the only neighboring state where East Germans could escape to. Thousands of East Germans tried to reach the West by occupying the West German diplomatic facilities in other Central and Eastern European capitals, notably the [[Prague Embassy]] and the Hungarian Embassy where thousands camped in the muddy garden from August to November waiting for German political reform. The GDR closed the border to the CSSR on 3 October, thereby isolating itself from all neighbors. Having been shut off from their last chance for escape, an increasing number of East Germans participated in the [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany|Monday demonstrations]] in Leipzig on 4, 11, and 18 September, each attracting 1,200 to 1,500 demonstrators; many were arrested and beaten. However, the people refused to be intimidated. On 25 September, the protests attracted 8,000 demonstrators.

After the fifth successive Monday demonstration in Leipzig on 2 October attracted 10,000 protesters, [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party]] (SED) leader [[Erich Honecker]] issued a ''shoot and kill'' order to the military.&lt;ref name = "Pritchard"&gt;{{cite book|title=Reconstructing education: East German schools and universities after unification| first = Rosalind MO | last = Pritchard|page =10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communists prepared a huge police, militia, [[Stasi]], and work-combat troop presence and there were rumors a Tiananmen Square-style massacre was being planned for the following Monday's demonstration on 9 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Germany, 1918–2000: the divided nation| first =Mary | last = Fulbrook|page = 256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 and 7 October, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] visited East Germany to mark the 40th anniversary of the German Democratic Republic, and urged the East German leadership to accept reform. A famous quote of his is rendered in German as "Wer zu spät kommt, den bestraft das Leben" ("He who is too late is punished by life"). However, Honecker remained opposed to internal reform, with his regime even going so far as forbidding the circulation of Soviet publications that it viewed as subversive.

In spite of rumors that the Communists were planning a massacre on 9 October, 70,000 citizens demonstrated in Leipzig that Monday, and the authorities on the ground refused to open fire. This victory of the people facing down the Communists' guns encouraged more citizens to take to the streets. The following Monday, 16 October, 120,000 people demonstrated on the streets of Leipzig.

[[Erich Honecker]] had hoped that the [[Group of Soviet Forces in Germany|Soviet troops]] stationed in the [[East Germany|GDR]], as by the [[Warsaw Pact]], would restore the communist government and suppress the civilian protests. By 1989 the [[Government of the Soviet Union|Soviet government]] deemed it impractical for the Soviet Union to [[Sinatra Doctrine|continue asserting its control]] over the [[Eastern Bloc]], and so it took a neutral stance regarding the events happening in East Germany. Soviet troops stationed in eastern Europe were under strict instructions from the Soviet leadership not to intervene in the political affairs of the Eastern Bloc nations and had to remain in their barracks. Faced with ongoing civil unrest, the SED deposed Honecker on 18 October and replaced him with the number-two-man in the regime, [[Egon Krenz]]. However, the demonstrations kept growing and on Monday 23 October the Leipzig protesters numbered 300,000 and remained as large the following week. The border to Czechoslovakia was opened again on 1 November, but the Czechoslovak authorities soon let all East Germans travel directly to West Germany without further bureaucratic ado, thus lifting their part of the Iron Curtain on 3 November. On 4 November the authorities decided to authorize a demonstration in Berlin and were faced with the [[Alexanderplatz demonstration]] where half a million citizens converged on the capital demanding freedom in the biggest protest the GDR ever witnessed. Unable to stem the ensuing flow of refugees to the West through Czechoslovakia, the East German authorities eventually caved in to public pressure by allowing East German citizens to enter West Berlin and West Germany directly, via existing border points, on 9 November 1989, without having properly briefed the border guards. Triggered by the erratic words of regime spokesman [[Günter Schabowski]] in a TV press conference, stating that the planned changes were in effect "immediately, without delay," hundreds of thousands of people took advantage of the opportunity. The guards were quickly overwhelmed by the growing crowds of people demanding to be let out into West Berlin. After receiving no feedback from their superiors, the guards, unwilling to use force, relented and opened the gates to West Berlin. Soon new crossing points were forced open in the [[Berlin Wall]] by the people, and sections of the wall were literally torn down as this symbol of oppression was overwhelmed. The bewildered guards were unaware of what was happening and meekly stood by as the East Germans took to the wall with hammers and chisels.

On 13 November, GDR Prime Minister [[Willi Stoph]] and his entire cabinet resigned. A new government was formed under a considerably more liberal Communist, [[Hans Modrow]]. On 1 December, the [[Volkskammer]] removed the SED's leading role from the constitution of the GDR. On 3 December Krenz resigned as leader of the SED; he resigned as head of state three days later. On 7 December Round Table talks opened between the SED and other political parties. On 16 December 1989, the SED was dissolved and refounded as the [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|SED-PDS]], abandoning Marxism-Leninism and becoming a mainstream democratic socialist party.

On 15 January 1990, the Stasi's headquarters was stormed by protesters. Modrow became the de facto leader of East Germany until free elections were held on 18 March 1990—the first held in that part of Germany since 1933. The SED, renamed the [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|Party of Democratic Socialism]], was heavily defeated. [[Lothar de Maizière]] of the East German Christian Democratic Union became Prime Minister on 4 April 1990 on a platform of speedy [[German reunification|reunification]] with the West. The two Germanies were reunified on 3 October 1990.

The Kremlin's willingness to abandon such a strategically vital ally marked a dramatic shift by the Soviet superpower and a fundamental paradigm change in international relations, which until 1989 had been dominated by the East-West divide running through Berlin itself. The last Russian troops left the territory of the former GDR, now part of a reunited [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]], on 1 September 1994.

=== Czechoslovakia ===
{{main|Velvet Revolution}}
[[File:Prague November89 - Wenceslas Monument.jpg|thumb|Protests beneath the monument in [[Prague]]'s [[Wenceslas Square]]]]
[[File:Bratislava Slovakia 213.JPG|thumb|upright=0.75|Memorial of the [[Velvet Revolution]] in [[Bratislava]] ([[SNP Square (Bratislava)|Námestie SNP]]), [[Slovakia]]]]
The "Velvet Revolution" was a non-violent revolution in Czechoslovakia that saw the overthrow of the Communist government. On 17 November 1989 (Friday), riot police suppressed a peaceful student demonstration in Prague, although controversy continues over whether anyone died that night. That event sparked a series of popular demonstrations from 19 November to late December. By 20 November the number of peaceful protesters assembled in Prague had swelled from 200,000 the previous day to an estimated half-million. Five days later, the Letná Square protest held 800,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.denik.cz/z_domova/demonstrace-na-letne-pred-25-lety-urychlily-kapitulaci-komunistu-20141123.html | title = Demonstrace na letne pred 25 lety urychlily kapitulaci komunistu | language = cs| place = [[Czhec|CZ]] | newspaper = Denik}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 November, the entire Communist Party leadership, including general secretary [[Miloš Jakeš]], resigned. A two-hour general strike, involving all citizens of Czechoslovakia, was successfully held on 27 November.

With the collapse of other Communist governments, and increasing street protests, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia announced on 28 November 1989 that it would relinquish power and dismantle the single-party state. Barbed wire and other obstructions were removed from the border with West Germany and Austria in early December. On 10 December, President [[Gustáv Husák]] appointed the first largely non-Communist government in Czechoslovakia since 1948, and resigned. [[Alexander Dubček]] was elected speaker of the federal parliament on 28 December and [[Václav Havel]] the President of Czechoslovakia on 29 December 1989. In June 1990 Czechoslovakia held its first democratic elections since 1946. On 27 June 1991 the last Soviet troops were withdrawn from Czechoslovakia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=20 Years After Soviet Soldiers Left the Czech Republic, Russians Move In|url = https://blogs.wsj.com/emergingeurope/2011/06/28/soviet-soldiers-left-czechoslovakia-20-years-ago-ordinary-well-off-russians-to-move-in/ | newspaper= The Wall Street Journal|date=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bulgaria ===
In October and November 1989, demonstrations on ecological issues were staged in Sofia, where demands for political reform were also voiced. The demonstrations were suppressed, but on 10 November 1989 (the day after the Berlin Wall was breached) Bulgaria's long-serving leader [[Todor Zhivkov]] was ousted by his Politburo. He was succeeded by a considerably more liberal Communist, former foreign minister [[Petar Mladenov]]. Moscow apparently approved the leadership change, as Zhivkov had been opposed to Gorbachev's policies. The new regime immediately repealed restrictions on free speech and assembly, which led to the first mass demonstration on 17 November, as well as the formation of anti-communist movements. Nine of them united as the [[Union of Democratic Forces (Bulgaria)|Union of Democratic Forces]] (UDF) on 7 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.sds.bg/about/history | title = History of the UDF | language = bg | publisher = SDS | place = [[Bulgaria|BG]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UDF was not satisfied with Zhivkov's ouster, and demanded additional democratic reforms, most importantly the removal of the constitutionally mandated leading role of the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]].

Mladenov announced on 11 December 1989 that the Communist Party would abandon its monopoly on power, and that multiparty elections would be held the following year. In February 1990, the Bulgarian legislature deleted the portion of the constitution about the "leading role" of the Communist Party. Eventually, it was decided that a round table on the Polish model would be held in 1990 and elections held by June 1990. The round table took place from 3 January to 14 May 1990, at which an agreement was reached on the transition to democracy. The Communist Party abandoned Marxism–Leninism in April 1990 and renamed itself as the [[Bulgarian Socialist Party]]. In June 1990 the first free elections since 1931 were held, won by the Bulgarian Socialist Party.

=== Romania ===
{{main|Romanian Revolution}}
After having suppressed the [[Braşov Rebellion]] in 1987, [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] was re-elected for another five years as leader of the [[Romanian Communist Party]] (PCR) in November 1989, signalling that he intended to ride out the anti-Communist uprisings sweeping the rest of Europe. As Ceauşescu prepared to go on a state visit to Iran, his [[Securitate]] ordered the arrest and exile of a local Hungarian [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] minister, [[László Tőkés]], on 16 December, for sermons offending the regime. Tőkés was seized, but only after serious rioting erupted. [[Timişoara]] was the first city to react on 16 December and civil unrest continued for five days.

Returning from Iran, Ceauşescu ordered a mass rally in his support outside Communist Party headquarters in Bucharest on 21 December. However, to his shock the crowd booed and jeered him as he spoke. Years of repressed dissatisfaction boiled to the surface throughout the Romanian populace and even among elements in Ceauşescu's own government, and the demonstrations spread throughout the country.

At first the security forces obeyed Ceauşescu's orders to shoot protesters. However, on the morning of 22 December, the Romanian military suddenly changed sides. This came after it was announced that defense minister [[Vasile Milea]] had committed suicide after being unmasked as a traitor. Believing Milea had actually been murdered, the rank-and-file soldiers went over virtually ''en masse'' to the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cornel|first=Ban|title=Sovereign Debt, Austerity, and Regime Change: The Case of Nicolae Ceausescu’s Romania|date=November 2012|publisher=East European Politics &amp; Societies|page=34|url=http://0-web.a.ebscohost.com.libraries.colorado.edu/ehost/detail/detail?sid=b54ec8d0-8831-43ba-93d1-3f55b98fb916%40sessionmgr4002&amp;vid=0&amp;hid=4112&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=aph&amp;AN=83866105|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160518013101/http://0-web.a.ebscohost.com.libraries.colorado.edu/ehost/detail/detail?sid=b54ec8d0-8831-43ba-93d1-3f55b98fb916%40sessionmgr4002&amp;vid=0&amp;hid=4112&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=aph&amp;AN=83866105|dead-url=yes|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Army tanks began moving towards the Central Committee building with crowds swarming alongside them. The rioters forced open the doors of the Central Committee building in an attempt to capture Ceauşescu and his wife, [[Elena Ceauşescu|Elena]], coming within a few meters of the couple. However, they managed to escape via a helicopter waiting for them on the roof of the building. The revolution resulted in 1,104 deaths. Unlike its kindred parties in the Warsaw Pact, the PCR simply melted away; no present-day Romanian party claiming to be its successor has ever been elected to the legislature since the change of system.

Although elation followed the flight of the Ceauşescus, uncertainty surrounded their fate. On Christmas Day, Romanian television showed the Ceauşescus facing a hasty trial, and then undergoing [[summary execution]]. An interim [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]] Council led by [[Ion Iliescu]] took over and announced elections for April 1990, the first free elections held in Romania since 1937. However, they were postponed until 20 May 1990. Over 1,000 people died during the Romanian Revolution, out of which 100 where children and the youngest was only one month. The Romanian dictator, Nicolae Ceauşescu, and his wife, Elena Ceauşescu, were executed by firing squad after a very brief trial. The Romanian Revolution was the bloodiest of the revolutions of 1989.

=== Mongolia ===
{{main|Mongolian Revolution of 1990}}
Mongolia declared independence in 1911 after the collapse of the [[Qing dynasty]]. The [[Mongolian People's Party]] [[Outer Mongolian Revolution of 1921|took power]] in 1921 and the party renamed itself the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Constitutions of the Communist World|editor-first=William B.|editor-last=Simons|publisher=BRILL|year=1980|ISBN=9028600701|pages=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the years, Mongolia was closely aligned with the Soviet Union. After [[Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal]] left in 1984, the new leadership under [[Jambyn Batmönkh]] implemented economic reforms, but failed to appeal to those who, in late 1989, wanted broader changes,&lt;ref name="Kaplonski" /&gt; which led to the "Mongolian Revolution", a democratic [[Nonviolent revolution|peaceful]] revolution that started with demonstrations and [[hunger strike]]s that ended 70-years of [[socialism]] and eventually moved towards democracy. It was spearheaded by mostly younger people demonstrating on [[Sükhbaatar Square]] in the capital [[Ulaanbaatar]]. It ended with the [[authoritarian]] government resigning without bloodshed. Some of the main organizers were [[Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj]], [[Sanjaasürengiin Zorig]], [[Erdeniin Bat-Üül]], and [[Bat-Erdeniin Batbayar]].

During the period of the morning of 10 December 1989, the first public demonstration occurred in front of the Youth Cultural Center in the capital of Ulaanbaatar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=G.|first=Dari|title=

The protesters called for Mongolia to adopt [[perestroika]] and [[glasnost]]. Dissident leaders demanded free elections and economic reform, but within the context of a "human democratic socialism".&lt;ref name="Kaplonski"/&gt; The protesters injected a nationalist element into the protests by using traditional [[Mongolian script]]&amp;mdash;which most Mongolians could not read&amp;mdash;as a symbolic repudiation of the political system which had imposed the [[Mongolian Cyrillic alphabet]]. In late December 1989, demonstrations increased when news came of [[Garry Kasparov]]'s interview to ''[[Playboy]]'', suggesting that the Soviet Union could improve its economic health by selling Mongolia to China.&lt;ref name="Kaplonski"&gt;{{cite book|title=Truth, History, and Politics in Mongolia: The Memory of Heroes|first=Christopher|last=Kaplonski|year=2004|publisher=Psychology Press|pages=51, 56, 60, 64–65, 67, 80–82|ISBN=1134396732}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 January 1990, the protesters, having grown from three hundred to some 1,000, met on square in front of Lenin Museum which was named as Freedom Square since then in [[Ulaanbaatar]]. A demonstration on [[Sükhbaatar Square]] on 21 January (in weather of -30&amp;nbsp;C) followed. Protesters carried banners alluding to Chinggis Khaan (also referred to [[Genghis Khan]]), rehabilitating a figure which Soviet schooling neglected to praise.&lt;ref name="Fineman"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-01-24/news/mn-609_1_rock-music/2|title=Mongolia Reform Group Marches to Rock Anthem|first=Mark|last=Fineman|date=1990-01-24|accessdate=2012-12-26|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|quote=Mongolia-watchers in Beijing said that... the democracy movement is rooted more in nationalism than in dissent....

Opposition parties were not able to nominate enough candidates. The opposition nominated 346 candidates for the 430 seats in the Great Hural (upper house). The [[Mongolian People's Party|Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party]] MPRP won 357 seats in the Great Hural and 31 out of 53 seats in the Small Hural (which was later abolished) as well.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Staisch, Werner M. Prohl, ''Dschingis Khan lächelt'', Bonn 1998, p.38ff&lt;/ref&gt; The MPRP enjoyed a strong position in the countryside. The [[State Great Khural]] first met on 3 September 1990 and elected a president (MPRP), vice president ([[Mongolian Social Democratic Party|Social Democrat]]) who was also a chairman of the Baga Hural, prime minister (MPRP), and 50 members to the Baga Hural (lower house). In November 1991, the People's Great Hural began discussion on a new constitution, which entered into force on 12 February 1992. In addition, the new constitution restructured the legislative branch of government, creating a unicameral legislature, the State Great Hural (SGH). The MPRP retained its majority, but lost the 1996 elections. The final Russian troops, which had stationed in Mongolia in 1966, fully withdrew in December 1992.

=== Yugoslavia ===
{{main|Breakup of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav Wars}}
The [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] was not a part of the Warsaw Pact but pursued [[Titoism|its own version of "Communism"]] under [[Josip Broz Tito]]. It was a multi-ethnic state which Tito was able to maintain through a doctrine of "[[Brotherhood and unity]]", but tensions between ethnicities began to escalate with the so-called [[Croatian Spring]] of 1970–71, a movement for greater [[Socialist Republic of Croatia|Croatia]]n autonomy, which was suppressed. In 1974 there followed constitutional changes, and the [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution]] devolved some of the federal powers to the constituent republics and provinces. After Tito's death in 1980 ethnic tensions grew, first in Albanian-majority [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo|SAP Kosovo]] with the [[1981 protests in Kosovo]]. In the late 1980s [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|Serbia]]n leader [[Slobodan Milošević]] used the Kosovo crisis to stoke up Serb nationalism and attempt to consolidate and dominate the country, which alienated the other ethnic groups.{{Citation needed |date=August 2015}}

Parallel to the same process, [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia|SR Slovenia]] witnessed a policy of gradual liberalization since 1984, somewhat similar to the Soviet Perestroika. This provoked tensions between the [[League of Communists of Slovenia]] on one side, and the central Yugoslav Party and the [[Yugoslav People's Army|federal army]] on the other side. By the late 1980s, many civil society groups were pushing towards democratization, while widening the space for cultural plurality. In 1987 and 1988, a series of clashes between the emerging civil society and the Communist regime culminated with the so-called [[Slovene Spring]], a mass movement for democratic reforms. The [[Committee for the Defence of Human Rights]] was established as the platform of all major non-Communist political movements. By early 1989, several anti-Communist political parties were already openly functioning, challenging the hegemony of the Slovenian Communists. Soon, the Slovenian Communists, pressured by their own civil society, came into conflict with the Serbian Communist leadership.{{Citation needed |date=August 2015}}

In January 1990, an extraordinary Congress of the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] was called in order to settle the disputes among its constituent parties. Faced with being completely outnumbered, the Slovenian and Croatian Communists walked out of the Congress on 23 January 1990, thus effectively bringing to an end the Yugoslav Communist Party. Both parties of the two western republics negotiated free multi-party elections with their own opposition movements.

On 8 April 1990, the democratic and anti-Yugoslav [[DEMOS coalition]] won the [[Slovenian parliamentary election, 1990|elections in Slovenia]], while on 24 April 1990 the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 1990|Croatian elections]] witnessed the landslide victory of the nationalist [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ) led by [[Franjo Tuđman]]. The results were much more balanced in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina parliamentary election, 1990|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Macedonian parliamentary election, 1990|Macedonia]] in November 1990, while the [[Serbian parliamentary election, 1990|parliamentary]] and [[Serbian presidential election, 1990|presidential]] elections of December 1990 in Serbia and [[Montenegrin parliamentary election, 1990|Montenegro]] consolidated the power of Milošević and his supporters. Free elections on the level of the federation were never carried out.

The Slovenian and Croatian leaderships started preparing plans for secession from the federation, while the [[Serbs of Croatia]] organized the so-called [[Log Revolution]], an insurrection that would lead to the creation of the breakaway region of [[SAO Krajina]]. In the [[Slovenian independence referendum, 1990|Slovenian independence referendum]] on 23 December 1990, 88.5% of residents voted for independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/sei/documents/slovenian3.pdf |publisher=Sussex |place=UK |format=PDF |title=Slovenian Referendum Briefing No. 3 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218000730/http://www.sussex.ac.uk/sei/documents/slovenian3.pdf |archivedate=18 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Croatian independence referendum, 1991|Croatian independence referendum]] on 2 May 1991, 93.24% voted for independence.

The escalating ethnic and national tensions were exacerbated by the drive for independence and led to the following [[Yugoslav wars]]:
* [[Ten-Day War|War in Slovenia]] (1991)
* [[Croatian War of Independence]] (1991–1995)
* [[Bosnian War]] (1992–1995)
* [[Kosovo War]] (1998–1999), including the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]].

In addition, the [[insurgency in the Preševo Valley]] (1999–2001) and the [[insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia]] (2001) are also often discussed in the same context.{{Sfn | Judah |  2011}}{{Sfn | Naimark | Case | 2003 | p = xvii}}{{Sfn | Rogel | 2004 | pp = 91–92}}

In the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania]], [[Enver Hoxha]], who led Albania for four decades, died on 11 April 1985. His successor, [[Ramiz Alia]], began to gradually open up the regime from above. In 1989, the first revolts started in [[Shkodra]] and spread in other cities. Eventually, the existing regime introduced some liberalization, including measures in 1990 providing for freedom to travel abroad. Efforts were begun to improve ties with the outside world. March 1991 elections—the first free elections in Albania since 1923, and only the third free elections in the country's history—left the former Communists in power, but a general strike and urban opposition led to the formation of a coalition cabinet including non-Communists. Albania's former Communists were routed in elections held in March 1992, amid economic collapse and social unrest.

== Malta Summit ==
[[File:Bush and Gorbachev at the Malta summit in 1989.gif|thumb|[[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and President [[George H. W. Bush]] on board the Soviet cruise ship ''Maxim Gorky'', [[Marsaxlokk Harbour]]]]
The [[Malta Summit]] consisted of a meeting between U.S. President George H. W. Bush and U.S.S.R. leader Mikhail Gorbachev, taking place between 2–3 December 1989, just a few weeks after the fall of the Berlin Wall, a meeting which contributed to the end of the [[Cold War]]{{citation needed| date=December 2010}} partially as a result of the broader pro-democracy movement. It was their second meeting following a meeting that included then President Ronald Reagan, in New York in December 1988.

== Election chronology in Central/Eastern Europe and Central Asia ==
Between June 1989 and April 1991, every Communist or former Communist Central and Eastern European or Asian country—and in the case of the USSR and Yugoslavia every constituent republic—held competitive parliamentary elections for the first time in many decades.

== Dissolution of the Soviet Union ==
{{Eastern Bloc sidebar}}
{{main|Dissolution of the Soviet Union}}
[[File:Image0 ST.jpg|thumb|Tanks in Moscow's [[Red Square]] during the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|1991 coup attempt]]]]
On 1 July 1991, the Warsaw Pact was officially dissolved at a meeting in Prague. At a summit later that same month, Gorbachev and Bush declared a US–Soviet strategic partnership, decisively marking the end of the Cold War. President Bush declared that US–Soviet cooperation during the 1990–1991 [[Gulf War]] had laid the groundwork for a partnership in resolving bilateral and world problems.

As the Soviet Union rapidly withdrew its forces from Central and Southeast Europe, the spillover from the 1989 upheavals began reverberating throughout the Soviet Union itself. Agitation for self-determination led to first Lithuania, and then Estonia, Latvia and Armenia declaring independence. However, the Soviet central government demanded the revocation of the declarations and threatened military action and economic sanctions. The government even went as far as controversially sending [[Red Army]] troops to the streets of the Lithuanian capital, [[Vilnius]], to [[January Events (Lithuania)|suppress the separatist movements]] in January 1991, causing the deaths of 14 people.

Disaffection in other Soviet republics, such as Georgia and Azerbaijan, was countered by promises of greater decentralization. More open elections led to the election of candidates opposed to Communist Party rule.

''Glasnost'' had inadvertently released the long-suppressed national sentiments of all peoples within the borders of the multinational Soviet state. These nationalist movements were further strengthened by the rapid deterioration of the Soviet economy, whose ramshackle foundations were exposed with the removal of Communist discipline. Gorbachev's reforms had failed to improve the economy, with the old Soviet [[planned economy|command structure]] completely breaking down. One by one, the constituent republics created their own economic systems and voted to subordinate Soviet laws to local laws. In 1990, the Communist Party was forced to surrender its seven-decade monopoly of political power when the Supreme Soviet rescinded the clause in the Soviet Constitution that guaranteed its sole authority to rule. Gorbachev's policies caused the Communist Party to lose its grip over the media. Details of the Soviet Union's past were quickly being declassified. This caused many to distrust the 'old system' and push for greater autonomy and independence.

After a referendum confirmed the preservation of the Soviet Union but in a looser form, a group of Soviet hard-liners represented by Vice-President [[Gennadi Yanayev]] launched [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|a coup attempting to overthrow Gorbachev]] in August 1991. [[Boris Yeltsin]], then president of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]], rallied the people and much of the army against the coup and the effort collapsed. Although restored to power, Gorbachev's authority had been irreparably undermined. Gorbachev resigned as General Secretary of the Communist Party following the coup, and the Supreme Soviet dissolved the Party and banned all Communist activity on Soviet soil. Just a few weeks later, the government granted the Baltic states their independence on 6 September.

Over the next three months, one republic after another declared independence, mostly out of fear of another coup. Also during this time, the Soviet government was rendered useless as the new Russian government began taking over what remained of it, including the Kremlin. The penultimate step came on 1 December, when voters in the second most powerful republic, Ukraine, overwhelmingly voted to secede from the Soviet Union in a referendum. This ended any realistic chance of keeping the Soviet Union together. On 8 December, Yeltsin met with his counterparts from Ukraine and Belarus and signed the [[Belavezha Accords]], declaring that the Soviet Union had ceased to exist. Gorbachev denounced this as illegal, but he had long since lost any ability to influence events outside of Moscow.

Two weeks later, 11 of the remaining 12 republics—all except Georgia—signed the [[Alma-Ata Protocol]], which confirmed the Soviet Union had been effectively dissolved and replaced by a new voluntary association, the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]]. Bowing to the inevitable, Gorbachev resigned as Soviet president on 25 December, and the Supreme Soviet ratified the Belavezha Accords the next day, legally dissolving itself and the Soviet Union as a political entity. By the end of 1991, the few Soviet institutions that hadn't been taken over by Russia had dissolved. The Soviet Union was officially disbanded, breaking up into fifteen constituent parts, thereby ending the world's largest and most influential Socialist state, and leaving to China that position. A [[1993 Russian constitutional crisis|constitutional crisis]] dissolved into violence in Moscow as the [[Russian Army]] was called in to reestablish order.

=== Baltic states ===
{{main|Singing Revolution}}
[[File:1989 08 23 Baltijoskelias14.jpg|thumb|[[Baltic Way]] was a [[human chain]] of approximately two million people dedicated to liberating the [[Baltic Republics]] from the [[Soviet Union]].]]
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania implemented democratic reforms and achieved independence from the Soviet Union.

The Singing Revolution is a commonly used name for events between 1987 and 1991 that led to the restoration of the independence of [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic|Estonia]], [[Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic|Latvia]] and [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic|Lithuania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Thomson | first=Clare | title=The Singing Revolution: A Political Journey through the Baltic States | location= London  | publisher= Joseph | year= 1992 | isbn= 0-7181-3459-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Ginkel | first=John |date=September 2002 | title=Identity Construction in Latvia's "Singing Revolution": Why inter-ethnic conflict failed to occur | journal=Nationalities Papers | volume=30| issue=3| pages=403–33 | doi = 10.1080/0090599022000011697}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by an Estonian activist and artist, [[Heinz Valk]], in an article published a week after the 10–11 June 1988 spontaneous mass night-singing demonstrations at the [[Tallinn Song Festival Grounds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nI73PdnqQlcC&amp;pg | title = Between Utopia and Disillusionment | first = Henri | last = Vogt | p = 26 | ISBN = 1-57181-895-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Estonia [[Estonian Sovereignty Declaration|declared its sovereignty]] from the Soviet Union on 16 November 1988. Lithuania followed on 18 May 1989 and Latvia on 28 July 1989. [[Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania|Lithuania declared full independence]] on 11 March 1990 and on 30 March, Estonia announced the start of a transitional period to independence, [[On the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of Latvia|followed by Latvia]] on 4 May. These declarations were met with force from the Soviet Union in early 1991, in confrontations known as the [[January Events (Lithuania)|"January Events" in Lithuania]] and "[[The Barricades]]" in Latvia. The Baltic states contended that their incorporation into the Soviet Union had been illegal under both international law and their own law, and they were reasserting an independence that still legally existed.

Soon after the launching of the August coup, Estonia and Latvia declared full independence. By the time the coup was foiled, the USSR was no longer unified enough to mount a forceful resistance, and it recognized the independence of the Baltic states on 6 September.

=== Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova ===
* {{flag|Belarus|1991}} declared full independence from the USSR on August 25, 1991. The main political changes of the early 1990s were driven by the [[Belarusian Popular Front]] and its fraction in the [[Supreme Soviet of Belarus]]. A few years later, a new postcommunist leader, [[Alexander Lukashenko]], has obtained power. After a short period he increased his power as a result of two controversial referenda (1995–96) and has been criticized for [[Human rights in Belarus|repressing political opposition]] ever since.
* {{flag|Moldova}} participated in the [[War of Transnistria]] between Moldova and Russian-connected forces. Communists came back to power in a 2001 election under [[Vladimir Voronin]], but faced [[2009 Moldova civil unrest|civil unrest]] in 2009 over accusations of rigged elections.
* {{flag|Ukraine}} [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine|declared its independence]] in August 1991. Presidencies of former Communists [[Leonid Kravchuk]] and [[Leonid Kuchma]] were followed by the [[Orange Revolution]] in 2004, in which Ukrainians elected [[Viktor Yushchenko]] (also former member of [[CPSU]]).

=== Transcaucasia ===
[[File:April9victims.jpg|thumb|Photos of 9 April 1989 victims of the [[Tbilisi massacre]] on a billboard in [[Tbilisi]]]]
* {{flag|Georgia|1990}} and the [[North Caucasus]] have been marred by ethnic and sectarian violence since the collapse of the USSR. In April 1989 the [[Soviet Army]] [[April 9 tragedy|massacred]] demonstrators in [[Tbilisi]]. By November 1989, the [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Georgian SSR]] officially condemned the Russian invasion in 1921. Democracy activist [[Zviad Gamsakhurdia]] served as president from 1991 to 1992. Russia aided break-away republics in wars in [[1991-1992 South Ossetia War|South Ossetia]] and [[War in Abkhazia (1992-1993)|Abkhazia]] during the early 1990s, conflicts that have periodically reemerged, and Russia has accused Georgia of supporting Chechen rebels during the [[First Chechen War|Chechen wars]]. A coup d'état installed former Communist leader [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] as President of Georgia until the [[Rose Revolution]] in 2003.
* {{flag|Armenia}}'s independence struggle included violence as the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]] was fought between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Armenia became increasingly militarized (with the ascendancy of Kocharian, a former president of Nagorno-Karabakh, often viewed as a milestone), while elections have since been increasingly controversial, and government corruption became more rife. After Kocharyan, notably, [[Serzh Sargsyan]] ascended to power. Sargsyan is often noted as the "founder of the Armenian and Karabakh militaries" and was, in the past, defense minister and national security minister.
* {{flag|Azerbaijan}}'s [[Azerbaijani Popular Front Party|Popular Front Party]] won first elections with the self-described pro-Western, populist nationalist Elchibey. However, Elchibey planned to end Moscow's advantage in the harvesting of Azeri oil and build much stronger links with Turkey and Europe, and as a result was overthrown by former Communists in a coup backed by Russia and Iran (which viewed the new country as a compelling threat, with territorial ambitions within Iranian borders and also being a strong economic rival).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Curtis|first1=Glenn E.|title=Azerbaijan: A Country Study|date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mutallibov rose to power, but he was soon destabilized and eventually ousted due to popular frustration with his perceived incompetence, corruption and improper handling of the war with Armenia. Azerbaijani KGB and Azerbaijani SSR leader [[Heydar Aliyev]] captured power and remained president until he transferred the presidency to his son in 2003. The [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]] was fought between Armenia and Azerbaijan, and has largely defined the fates of both countries. However, unlike Armenia, which remains a strong Russian ally, Azerbaijan has begun, since Russia's 2008 war with Georgia, to foster better relations with Turkey and other Western nations, while lessening ties with Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nagorno-Karabakh profile|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-18270325|website=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chechnya ===
[[File:Evstafiev-chechnya-women-pray.jpg|thumb|[[Chechen people|Chechen]] women praying in [[Grozny]], December 1994]]
In [[Chechnya]], using tactics partly copied from the Baltics, anti-Communist coalition forces led by former Soviet general [[Dzhokhar Dudayev]] staged a largely bloodless revolution, and ended up forcing the resignation of the Communist republican president. Dudayev was elected in a landslide in the following election and in November 1991 he proclaimed [[Checheno-Ingushetia]]'s independence as the Republic of Ichkeria. Ingushetia voted to leave the union with Chechnya, and was allowed to do so (thus it became the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria). Due to his desire to exclude Moscow from all oil deals, Yeltsin backed a failed coup against him in 1993. In 1994, Chechnya, with only marginal recognition (one country: Georgia, which was revoked soon after the coup landing Shevardnadze in power), was invaded by Russia, spurring the [[First Chechen War]]. The Chechens, with considerable assistance from the populations of both former-Soviet countries and from Sunni Muslim countries repelled this invasion and a peace treaty was signed in 1997. However, Chechnya became increasingly anarchic, largely due to the both political and physical destruction of the state during the invasion, and general Shamil Basaev, having evaded all control by the central government, conducted raids into neighboring Dagestan, which Russia used as pretext for reinvading Ichkeria. Ichkeria was then reincorporated into Russia as Chechnya again, though insurgency continues.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rbc.ru/politics/12/05/2017/5915d8799a794757ef77f42e&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Central Asia ===
* {{flag|Kazakhstan|1991}}'s independence struggle began with the [[Jeltoqsan]] uprising in 1986. Former Communist leader [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] has been in power since 1990 when he started serving as [[Kazakh SSR|President of Kazakh SSR]].
* {{flag|Kyrgyzstan|1991}}'s [[Askar Akayev]] retained power until the [[Tulip Revolution]] in 2005.
* {{flag|Tajikistan|1991}}'s [[Rahmon Nabiyev]] retained power, which led to the [[civil war in Tajikistan]]. [[Emomalii Rahmon]] has succeeded Nabiyev and has retained power since 1992.
* {{flag|Turkmenistan|1991}}'s [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] retained power until his death in 2006 and was criticized as one of the world's most totalitarian and repressive leaders, maintaining his own [[cult of personality]].
* {{flag|Uzbekistan}}'s [[Islam Karimov]] retained power until his death in 2016, and was widely criticized for repressing the political opposition throughout his tenure.

=== Post-Soviet conflicts ===
Russia was involved in a number of conflicts, including the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]], the [[War of Transnistria]], the [[1991–1992 South Ossetia War]], the [[First Chechen War]], the [[War in Abkhazia (1992–1993)|War in Abkhazia]], the [[Ossetian–Ingush conflict]], and the [[2014 Crimean Crisis|Crimea]] and [[War in Donbass|Donbass]] conflicts in Ukraine.

== Political reforms ==
{{main|Decommunization}}
Decommunization is a process of overcoming the legacies of the [[Communist state]] establishments, culture, and psychology in the post-Communist states.

Decommunization was largely limited or non-existent. Communist parties were not outlawed and their members were not brought to trial. Just a few places even attempted to exclude members of communist secret services from decision-making. In a number of countries the Communist party simply changed its name and continued to function.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icer.it/docs/wp2000/Pejovich162000.pdf After Socialism: where hope for individual liberty lies]. Svetozar Pejovich.&lt;/ref&gt;

In several European countries, however, endorsing or attempting to justify crimes committed by Nazi or Communist regimes will be punishable by up to 3 years of imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.annefrank.org/content.asp?PID=888&amp;LID=2|title=This page does not / no longer exist|author=Anne Frank Stichting|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic reforms ==
State run enterprises in socialist countries had little or no interest in producing what customers wanted which resulted in shortages of goods and services.&lt;ref name="aslund"/&gt; In the early 1990s, the general view was that there was no precedent for moving from socialism to capitalism",&lt;ref name="Havrylyshyn"/&gt; and only some elderly people remembered how a market economy worked. As result the view that Central, Southeastern and Eastern Europe would stay poor for decades was common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=The world after 1989: Walls in the mind |work=The Economist | date=5 November 2009 | url=http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?story_id=14793753 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a temporary fall of output in the official economy and an increase in black market economic activity.&lt;ref name="aslund"/&gt;
Countries implemented different reform programs. One example, generally regarded as successful was the "shock therapy" [[Balcerowicz Plan]] in Poland. Eventually the official economy began to grow.&lt;ref name="aslund"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Myth of Output Collapse after Communism | author=Anders Aslund | date=1 December 2000 | url=http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=611 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, President Yeltsin's government invited [[Vladimir Bukovsky]] to serve as an expert to testify at the [[CPSU]] trial by [[Constitutional Court]] of Russia, where the Communists were suing Yeltsin for banning their party. The respondent's case was that the [[CPSU]] itself had been an unconstitutional organization. To prepare for his testimony, Bukovsky requested and was granted access to a large number of documents from Soviet archives (then reorganized into [[TsKhSD]]). Using a small handheld scanner and a laptop computer, he managed to secretly scan many documents (some with high [[security clearance]]), including [[KGB]] reports to the [[Central Committee]], and smuggle the files to the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = JHU | contribution-url = http://psi.ece.jhu.edu/~kaplan/IRUSS/BUK/GBARC/buk.html | contribution = Soviet Archives | title = Info-Russ}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The event that many expected would be another [[Nuremberg Trial]] and the beginnings of reconciliation with the Communist past, ended up in half-measures: while the CPSU was found unconstitutional, the Communists were allowed to form new parties in the future. Bukovsky expressed his deep disappointment with this in his writings and interviews: "Having failed to finish off conclusively the Communist system, we are now in danger of integrating the resulting monster into our world. It may not be called Communism anymore, but it retained many of its dangerous characteristics... Until the Nuremberg-style tribunal passes its judgment on all the crimes committed by Communism, it is not dead and the war is not over."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.frontpagemag.com./Articles/Printable.asp?ID=1589 | title = The Cold War and the War Against Terror | first = Jamie | last = Glazov | newspaper = Front Page | date = 1 July 2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretations ==
The events caught many by surprise. [[Predictions of Soviet collapse|Predictions of the Soviet Union's impending demise]] had been often dismissed.&lt;ref name="melt"&gt;{{cite news|first=Ian|last=Cummins|title=The Great MeltDown|work=The Australian|date=23 December 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bartlomiej Kaminski's book ''The Collapse of State Socialism'' argued that the state Socialist system has a lethal paradox, saying that "policy actions designed to improve performance only accelerate its decay".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/47325/robert-legvold/the-collapse-of-state-socialism | title = The Collapse of State Socialism | newspaper = Foreign Affairs}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 1989, revolts had spread from one capital to another, ousting the regimes imposed on Central, South-East and Eastern Europe after World War II. Even the isolationist Stalinist regime in Albania was unable to stem the tide. Gorbachev's abrogation of the [[Brezhnev Doctrine]] was perhaps the key factor that enabled the popular uprisings to succeed. Once it became evident that the feared Soviet Army would not intervene to crush dissent, the Central, South-East and Eastern European regimes were exposed as vulnerable in the face of popular uprisings against the one-party system and power of [[secret police]].

[[Coit D. Blacker]] wrote in 1990 that the Soviet leadership "appeared to have believed that whatever loss of authority the Soviet Union might suffer in Central and South-East Europe would be more than offset by a net increase in its influence in western Europe."&lt;ref name="fa90"&gt;{{Citation | first = Coit D | last = Blacker | title = The Collapse of Soviet Power in Europe | journal = Foreign Affairs | year = 1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it is unlikely that Gorbachev ever intended for the complete dismantling of Communism and the Warsaw Pact. Rather, Gorbachev assumed that the Communist parties of Central and South-East Europe could be reformed in a similar way to the reforms he hoped to achieve in the CPSU. Just as ''perestroika'' was aimed at making the Soviet Union more efficient economically and politically, Gorbachev believed that the [[Comecon]] and Warsaw Pact could be reformed into more effective entities. However, [[Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev|Alexander Yakovlev]], a close advisor to Gorbachev, would later state that it would have been "absurd to keep the system" in Central and South-East Europe. Yakovlev had come to the conclusion that the Soviet-dominated Comecon could not work on non-market principles and that the Warsaw Pact had "no relevance to real life."&lt;ref name="Steele"&gt;{{Citation | last = Steele | first = Jonathan | title = Eternal Russia: Yeltsin, Gorbachev and the Mirage of Democracy | place = Boston | publisher = Faber | year = 1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
When the country club and course opened {{Time ago|1926}} in 1926, it was known as the [[Los Angeles Athletic Club]] Golf Course. [[William P. Bell]] helped Thomas in the design and planning of the course. They were in charge of assembling a labor force to build the course from scratch in the Santa Monica Canyon. In 1927 dollars, the entire country club and golf course cost $243,827.63 to build; at the time, it was one of the most expensive in golf history. Golf Course Histories posted on its website aerial comparisons dating back to 1927; notably, the famed 10th hole lacked greenside bunkers.&lt;ref&gt;http://golfcoursehistories.com/Riv.html&lt;/ref&gt; The course has been modified a few times, most notably in 1992 when [[Ben Crenshaw]] and Bill Coore redesigned the bunkers to look as they did when the course opened.

The country club prospered in the 1930s. It hosted the [[dressage]] [[Equestrian at the 1932 Summer Olympics|equestrian]] and the riding part of the [[Modern pentathlon at the 1932 Summer Olympics|modern pentathlon]] events for the [[1932 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1932/1932s.pdf 1932 Summer Olympics official report.] pp. 73-4, 572.&lt;/ref&gt; The Riviera Equestrian Center was where prominent riders like [[Egan Merz]] trained younger people like [[Elizabeth Taylor]] how to ride; Taylor, then a child star, was preparing for her role in the movie ''[[National Velvet]]''.

The movie ''[[Pat and Mike]]'', starring [[Katharine Hepburn]] and [[Babe Zaharias]], was filmed at Riviera, as was ''The Caddy'', starring [[Jerry Lewis]] and [[Dean Martin]], with a cameo appearance by [[Ben Hogan]], and ''[[Follow the Sun (film)|Follow the Sun]]'', about Hogan, starring [[Glenn Ford]] and [[Anne Baxter]]. The club has had many famous members, which included [[Humphrey Bogart]], [[Glen Campbell]], [[Vic Damone]], [[Peter Falk]], [[Jack Ging]], [[Dean Martin]], [[Gregory Peck]], [[Walt Disney]], [[Hal Roach]], [[Douglas Fairbanks]], and [[Mary Pickford]]. The actor [[Conrad Veidt]] died suddenly of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in 1943 while playing golf at The Riviera Country Club.&lt;ref&gt;Conrad Veidt Obituary, Los Angeles Times 1943&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Willie Hunter (golfer)|Willie Hunter]], the 1921 [[British Amateur]] champion and six-time PGA Tour winner, served as the head professional from 1936 to 1964. His son Mac Hunter held the head pro job from 1964 to 1973. Willie Hunter helped save the course from severe flooding in 1939, and helped rescue the club from bankruptcy during [[World War II]].
The 1927 movie Spring Fever was filmed there, called the Oakmont Country Club in the movie.

==PGA Tour==
Riviera hosted the Los Angeles Open in 1929 and 1930, then nine consecutive years from 1945 through 1953. It returned {{nowrap|in [[1973 PGA Tour|1973]],&lt;ref name=sfgtrerg&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gxonAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=HOEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6759%2C1025537|work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=Associated Press |last=Grimsley |first=Will |title=Stars 'financing' golf tour |date=January 5, 1973 |page=5B}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} where it has remained, with the exception of 1983 and 1998, for a total of 55 times through 2018. &lt;!-- 54 thru 2017 --&gt;

The course is well known for [[Ben Hogan]], and the course has been called "Hogan's Alley"&lt;ref name=sfgtrerg/&gt; (a moniker shared with [[Colonial Country Club (Fort Worth)|Colonial Country Club]] in [[Texas]]). In the 1940s, Hogan won the L.A. Open three times and finished second once. Other notable winners at Riviera include [[Sam Snead]], [[Byron Nelson]], [[Hale Irwin]], [[Tom Watson (golfer)|Tom Watson]], [[Johnny Miller]], [[Ben Crenshaw]], [[Bubba Watson]], [[Mark Calcavecchia]], [[Fred Couples]], [[Corey Pavin]], [[Craig Stadler]], [[Nick Faldo]], [[Ernie Els]], [[Mike Weir]], and [[Phil Mickelson]]. Hogan also won the 1948 U.S. Open at Riviera, and Irwin also won the 1998 U.S. Senior Open. [[Hal Sutton]] won the 1983 PGA, and [[Steve Elkington]] won the 1995 PGA.

More recent winners at Riviera include [[Rory Sabbatini]] in 2006,&lt;ref name=shoschr&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tdNYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ivADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6837%2C4492368 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=Associated Press |title=Sabbatini holds off Scott's charge |date=February 20, 2006 |page=D3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Charles Howell III]], who won in 2007 in a sudden-death playoff against [[Phil Mickelson]].&lt;ref name=thrstnh&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=611WAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=n_ADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2270%2C4366885 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=Associated Press  |title=Thirstin' Howell III sips from Nissan cup |date=February 19, 2007 |page=D6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thrslts&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6l1WAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=n_ADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6657%2C4360453 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=Associated Press  |title=PGA Tour at Los Angeles |date=February 19, 2007 |page=D5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the first as the Northern Trust Open, Mickelson hung on for a two-shot win over [[Jeff Quinney]] to win for the first time at Riviera. This win gave Mickelson at least one win in every [[West Coast Swing]] event.

Notable exceptions to the list of winners are [[Jack Nicklaus]] and [[Tiger Woods]]. Nicklaus' best finish was at age 38 in [[1978 PGA Tour|1978]], two strokes back as solo runner-up after an uncharacteristic stumble late in the final round.&lt;ref name=nllap&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=k65VAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7uEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5302%2C5511349 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=wire services |title=Nicklaus loses the L.A.

'''Bolded years''' are [[Men's major golf championships|major championships]] on the [[PGA Tour]].

==General information==
The greens at Riviera are ''[[Poa annua]]'', common for the West, but the fairways and rough are [[Pennisetum clandestinum|Kikuyu]] grass.&lt;ref name=hisrrc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.therivieracountryclub.com/club/scripts/library/view_document.asp?DN=FULLHISTORY&amp;GRP=21051&amp;NS=PUBLIC |publisher=Riviera Country Club |title=Club History |accessdate=February 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=loknl&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pga.com/news/local-knowledge/riviera-country-club-2014-local-knowledge |publisher=PGA.com |last=Kim |first=John |title=Local Knowledge: 2014 Northern Trust Open at Riviera |date=February 10, 2014 |accessdate=February 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gmlas &gt;{{cite web |url=http://grounds-mag.com/mag/grounds_maintenance_livingand_succeedingwith_kikuyugrass/ |work=Grounds Maintenance |last=Cockerham |first=Stephen T. |agency=(University of California-Riverside) |title=Living and succeeding with kikuyugrass |date= |accessdate=February 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A tough, dense pasture grass imported from [[Africa]], it had been used at a nearby [[polo]] field in the 1930s and was also planted on hillsides to prevent erosion. Over the years, it gradually invaded the course and became the dominant species. Kikuyu provides optimal lies on close-mown fairways, but is very challenging in the spongy rough.&lt;ref name=hisrrc/&gt;&lt;ref name=loknl/&gt;

Guests at Riviera must play the course with a member. For the [[dress code]], [[denim]] is not allowed; a collared shirt and either Bermuda shorts or slacks are required.

==The course==
The course is a [[Par (score)|par]] 71, at a length of {{convert|7013|yd}} from the back tees (which has been lengthened to {{convert|7322|yd}} for Tour play), {{convert|6531|yd}} from the middle tees, and {{convert|5907|yd}} from the forward tees. The men's [[slope rating]]s are 74.6/135 and 72.2/130 for the back and middle tees, respectively. The ladies' slope rating is 74.3/142 for the forward tees.&lt;ref name=rccslope/&gt;

The course record for competitive play is 61, ten under par, shot by [[Ted Tryba]] in [[1999 PGA Tour|1999]] in the third round of the Nissan Open, and included a bogey on 18.&lt;ref name=tsrmk/&gt;&lt;ref name=tlptanop/&gt; Tryba was the runner-up that year to [[Ernie Els]].&lt;ref name=ehotwno&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=a9VYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=E_IDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5485%2C2503841 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |title=Els holds on to win Nissan Open by 2 |date=February 22, 1999 |page=C2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The course record for the lowest nine holes is 28 (seven under par on the front nine), shot by [[Andrew Magee]] in the opening round in [[1991 PGA Tour|1991]] (followed by a 38 on the back nine for a 66).&lt;ref name=mgshmm&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-02-23/sports/sp-1297_1_andrew-magee |work=Los Angeles Times |last=Hudson |first=Maryann |title=Magee says his mind matters |date=February 23, 1991 |accessdate=February 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the tournament four strokes back, tied for eighth.&lt;ref name=swhalopw&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KFNWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zesDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7116%2C6105109 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon)|agency=Los Angeles Times |last=Florence |first=Mal |title=Schulz waits out LA Open win|date=February 25, 1991 |page=2B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Front nine===
[[Image:RivieraCountryClub9th.jpg|thumb|9th hole in 2006]]
The first hole, a short Par-5, is an easy beginning hole. The tee is elevated {{convert|75|ft}} above the [[Golf course#Fairway and rough|fairway]], tempting players to hit driver but out of bounds on the left side and a barranca crossing the fairway make players cautious. Scores range from eagle to double bogey. The second hole is a long par four that plays uphill and into the wind. It's the number one [[golf handicap|handicap]] hole. The third hole is a medium-length Par-4 that also plays into a breeze.

The fourth hole is a very long Par-3, which Hogan called the "best par three in America." The par four fifth hole plays into the wind and is almost on the side of the hill. The par three sixth hole is world-famous for having a [[Hazard (golf)|bunker]] in the middle of the green. If a player is on the wrong side of the green, they will have to make a tough decision to either putt around or chip over the bunker.

The narrow fairway at the seventh hole, a par four, is difficult to hit. The eighth hole, a long par four, has two fairways separated by a dry ditch. The ninth, a long, uphill Par-4, is known for its well-placed fairway bunkers.

===Back nine===
The tenth hole is a very short, 315 yard Par-4 known as a risk-reward hole. Longer hitters can try to drive the green but an accurate drive will be needed since several bunkers surround the green. The 11th hole is a long Par-5 where [[eucalyptus]] trees and a barranca come into play. The 12th is a long Par-4, often into the wind, that plays to a narrow green surrounded by the barranca, bunkers and trees. One, Bogey's Tree, is named after [[Humphrey Bogart]].

The 13th hole is a tough driving hole, with the barranca on the left side and eucalyptus along the right. The 14th is an easy Par-3 with the largest green on the golf course but the green is multi-tiered, which makes putting difficult. The 15th hole is a [[Golf course#Fairway and rough|dogleg]] Par-4 to the right that features another large green but it's two-tiered so golfers must make sure their ball is on the proper tier. This hole plays into the [[Sea breeze|breeze]] of the [[Pacific Ocean]] so it's a pivotal hole in the tournament.

The 16th hole is the last Par-3 on the course and can yield birdies, however players will need to hit the small green that is surrounded by bunkers. The 17th hole is a long, uphill Par-5 that is the longest hole on the course. The final 18th hole is a world-famous Par-4. The tee shot is blind and the ball must find the fairway to have any chance of reaching the green, which is surrounded by a natural amphitheater with a beautiful view of the [[Country club|clubhouse]].

'''Ronald 'Ronnie' Shelton''' (1 October 1961 – 25 September 2018), better known as '''West Side rapist''', was an American convicted serial rapist. He was convicted of raping over 30 women in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], over a 6 year period.&lt;ref name="Death" /&gt; He may have raped up to 50 women.&lt;ref name="NCJRS"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/134597NCJRS.pdf |title=Violent Crime Scene Analysis: Modus Operandi, Signature, and Staging |last1=Douglas |first1=John E. |last2=Munn |first2=Corinne |date=February 1992 |website=NCJRS.org |access-date=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shelton was caught on video using an ATM with his victims' bank cards.&lt;ref name="WKYC"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.wkyc.com/article/news/local/cleveland/convicted-cleveland-rapist-ronnie-shelton-dies-in-prison/95-598721625 |title=Convicted Cleveland rapist Ronnie Shelton dies in prison |last=Serino |first=Danielle |date=27 September 2018 |work=WKYC |access-date=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the subject of the book ''Unfinished Murder: The Pursuit of a Serial Rapist'' by [[James Neff]].&lt;ref name="Neff2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Neff|title=Unfinished Murder: The Pursuit of a Serial Rapist|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cqi4BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1|date=7 April 2015|publisher=Open Road Media|isbn=978-1-5040-0734-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crimes==
Shelton's ''[[modus operandi]]'' was to break into victims' homes wearing something to obscure his face.&lt;ref name="Douglas" /&gt; He would initially tell victims he was going to rob them, but then rape them.&lt;ref name="Douglas" /&gt; He would insist victims not look at him and threaten them if they reported him to police.&lt;ref name="Douglas" /&gt; His language and pattern of sexual assaults helped link his crimes.&lt;ref name="NCJRS" /&gt;

==Death==

At 4:30pm on 25 September 2018, six days before his 57th birthday, Shelton jumped from the top of a prison building, suffering a skull fracture upon impact with the concrete below. He was pronounced dead at 8:15pm at nearby [[MetroHealth Medical Center]].

'''The Ruckus Society''' is a nonprofit organization that sponsors skill-sharing and non-violent [[direct action]] training, strategy &amp; consultation for activists and organizers from frontline and impacted communities working on [[social justice]], [[human rights]], [[migrant rights]], [[workers rights]] and [[environmental justice]]. It was founded by [[Mike Roselle]] and [[Twilly Cannon]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newleftreview.org/II/10/john-sellers-raising-a-ruckus|title=Raising a Ruckus.|last=Sellers|first=John|year=2001|website=New Left Review|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
In an interview with John Sellers, former executive director and current president of The Ruckus Society, stated that [[Mike Roselle|Roselle]] and [[Twilly Cannon|Cannon]] founded The Ruckus Society in the mid 1990s based on the "direct-action model" they learned from [[Greenpeace]].

The name of the organization, explains Sellers, is not an acronym but refers to the term "ruckus", meaning "a loud, angry interruption, a hullabaloo, a disruption."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Ruckus Society's mission is to provide training in classic nonviolent direct action and [[civil disobedience]] tactics in the context of community-driven campaigns, including creative resistance, urban rappelling, media &amp; communications, and blockades with and without gear.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Graduate-School-for-Protesters-D-C-is-next-for-2789439.php|title=Graduate School for Protesters / D.C. is next for the Ruckus Society and its well-trained troublemakers|last=Wells|first=Janet|date=April 8, 2000|work=SFChronicle.com|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization consists of a small core group of staff members, and a larger team of volunteers in close contact with the leadership.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newleftreview.org/II/17/tom-mertes-grass-roots-globalism|title=Grass-Roots Globalism: Reply to Michael Hardt|last=Mertes|first=Tom|year=2002|website=New Left Review|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the organization had a staff of four full-time employees, roughly thirty volunteers, over 120 people acting as trainers, and over 2,000 graduates of their training opportunities.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Volunteers designs custom trainings and camps based on the specific needs and campaigns of the activists, and use popular education techniques to allow participants to discover the direct action knowledge they already possess. According to leadership, The Ruckus Society provides, "non-violence training, media training, direct action planning and strategy, and scouting."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Services and collaborations==
The Ruckus Society has co-sponsored projects including the [[Not Your Soldier Project]] (NYS), a [[counter-recruitment]] effort with the [[War Resisters League]], and the [[Indigenous Peoples' Power Project]] (IP3), bringing together indigenous youth organizers from all over the country.

In 2006, Ruckus teamed up with [[Working Assets]] for an Election Protection project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.workingassets.com/election_protection.cfm |title=Working Assets |publisher=Working Assets |date= |accessdate=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with [[Global Exchange]] and [[Rainforest Action Network]], they worked against [[Ford Motor Company]] and later other auto-manufacturers.

The Ruckus Society is a member of numerous coalitions efforts, and have performed actions for [[Wal-Mart Watch]] and others. The group has provided training to [[Greenpeace]], [[Patagonia (clothing)|Patagonia, Inc.]], the [[California Faculty Association]], United Students Against Sweatshops, [[Students for Bhopal]], [[Student/Farmworker Alliance]], the [[Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition]], [[Students for a Free Tibet]] and [[Detroit Summer]].

The Ruckus Society helped bottomline organizing for the US Social Forum in Detroit in 2010 and hosted a Migrant Rights Action Camp with NDLON at the Highlander Center in 2011.

==Leadership==
[[John Sellers (activist)|John Sellers]] was the executive director of the organization for 8 years, through the [[World Trade Organization]] protests in [[Seattle]] in 1999, the creation of [http://www.ruckus.org/article.php?list=type&amp;type=42 IP3] and [http://www.notyoursoldier.org NYS] and his own $2 million bail. [[Adrienne Maree Brown]] came on as executive director in 2006, the first woman of color to lead the organization.

The organization created a co-directorship model in 2010 and in 2013 hired a third co-director. Leadership in the organization comes from the network of trainers and the many movements from which they come.{{Citation needed|reason=This is not reflected in the Ruckus Society website.|date=August 2018}}

==Impact==
The Ruckus Society is made up of three staff and a network of over 150 action trainers and strategists located primarily in the United States but also distributed throughout the world.

As a movement support organization, The Ruckus Society has trained thousands of organizers and activists throughout the years in non-violent direct action and creative resistance, including those in environmental justice, migrant rights, education justice, forest defense, indigenous rights, workers rights, youth and criminal justice, and eviction defense.

== Funding ==
According to research conducted by social movement scholar Edouard Morena, "over 95 per cent of the Ruckus Society's revenues come from 'direct public support'" and private grants, not governmental grants. This type of funding includes donations for individuals, foundations, and other organizations.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morena|first=Edouard|date=June 2006|title=Funding and the Future of the Global Justice Movement|journal=Development|volume=49|issue=2|pages=29–33|doi=10.1057/palgrave.development.1100254}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the organization had a budget of $370,000.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Major funders of The Ruckus Society have included the [[Turner Foundation]], the [[Ben and Jerry's Foundation]], and the Ecology Center Inc.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Criticism==
In its early years, The Ruckus Society was criticized for being composed of largely privileged white activists, which has been acknowledged. This led the leadership to attempt to diversify its causes and leadership.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since the mid-2000s The Ruckus Society has collaborated with numerous groups representing Indigenous environmental concerns, migrant rights, and Detroit-based environmental groups.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The organization has also been critiqued for its lack of transparency around funding sources. This has prompted attempts at investigating the sources of their funding.&lt;ref name="human_events"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://proxy.lib.umich.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/235924974?accountid=14667|title=Ruckus society 'anarchists' promoting high-tech havoc|last1=Boggs|first1=Luke|date=17 June 2002|accessdate=30 August 2018|publisher=Human Events Publishing|agency=Human Events}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ruckus Society has been the target of conservative outlets who describe the group as violent anarchists, and as being responsible for training criminal activists who participate in vandalism and destruction of private property.&lt;ref name="human_events" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.activistfacts.com/organizations/188-ruckus-society/|title=Ruckus Society {{!}} Funding sources, staff profiles, and political agenda {{!}} Activist FactsActivist Facts|work=Activist Facts|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ryasna''' ({{lang-ru|рясна}}) was a part of a woman’s [[headgear]], hanging from a [[diadem]] or as a [[Temple ring|temporal pendant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Merriman|first=Philippa|title=Silver|year=2009|publisher=The British Museum|location=UK|isbn=978-0-674-03094-7|pages=47|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MKnYTmgwubMC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=ryasna+russian+decoration&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dGv2U6qiGsGUyAT5yYLwBg&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=ryasna%20russian%20decoration&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a sign of family's prosperity common in 11th-13th centuries in [[Kievan Rus’]], made in the shape of a chain linking golden, silver or copper pieces, [[medallion]]s, used as a suspension for a [[kolt]] or a similar [[pendant]].

==Design==
Ancient [[Rus' (region)|Rus']] ryasnas were designed to hang down from each side of the [[kokoshnik]], reaching the woman's shoulders with the kolt reaching her chest. The design was in the form of a [[rain chain]] and the imagery portrayed always had the same theme: [[sky]] and fertile agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibliotekar.ru/rusYazRusi/24.htm Ancient Rus']&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3097">'''Sada-e-Umeed''' (call of hope) is an Organization for children with disabilities in [[Khanewal]], Pakistan. Khanewal, a Christian colony founded in 1970, is 500 kilometers south of [[Islamabad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = UCANews.com March 5, 2002| url= http://www.ucanews.com/1997/05/07/christians-pledge-to-move-from-institutional-to-prophetic-church/?key=khanewal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an initiative of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Multan]].

Two [[Little Sisters of Jesus]], Sister Cecilia, a Belgian missionery, and Pakistani Sister Zeenat started the project in 1995 and handed it over to laypeople after 10 years. A Catholic priest and nun currently sit on its board of directors.

On December 3, 2008, Sister Cecilia asked 200 people at a function marking the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, to be more generous with their time and money.

The program included a puppet show, speeches, tableaus and singing by handicapped children. The performers were mainly from rehabilitation centers under the Sada-e-Umeed organization.

The organization runs a primary school and three centers for handicapped children in the Punjab province. The primary school for Inclusive Education was formed for special children, dropouts, overage youths and slow learners. Nabila Mushtaq is the principal of the Sada-e-Umeed primary school.

Three of the original six centers had to shut down in 2007 for lack of funds. Aamir Younis is the executive director of the organization. The other three stayed open but had to close their residential facilities and now serve 150 children and youths up to the age of 24. They provide rehabilitation services and basic skills training for youngsters who are not able to attend regular school.

The Catholic Church does not assist them financially and even the [[Catholic Relief Services]] stopped assistance in 2005. The centers are housed in rented buildings and depend on donations from local donors and foreign benefactors, but carry an operating deficit.

Each center needs at least 3,000 rupees (US$38) for rent and utilities per month. Additional funds are required for center workers to travel to remote villages to visit homes with disabled children and provide them physiotherapy, take them to hospitals for medical checkups and help parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Program For Disabled Children Cut By Half UCANews 10 December 2008| url= http://www.ucanews.com/2008/12/10/program-for-disabled-children-cut-by-half-for-lack-of-funds/?key=pakistan+priest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The centers are located in a troubled area. In 1997, 16 churches and hundreds of houses of Christians were ransacked, looted, burnt, and destroyed in Khanewal district of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Multan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = UCANews.com May 7, 1997

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5494">The '''Science Fiction Research Association''' ('''SFRA'''), founded in 1970, is the oldest, non-profit professional organization committed to encouraging, facilitating, and rewarding the [[science fiction studies|study]] of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] literature, film, and other media.  The organization’s international membership includes academically affiliated scholars, librarians, and archivists, as well as authors, editors, publishers, and readers.  In addition to its facilitating the exchange of ideas within a network of science fiction and fantasy experts, SFRA holds an annual conference for the critical discussion of science fiction and fantasy where it confers a number of awards, and it produces the quarterly publication, ''SFRA Review'', which features reviews, review essays, articles, interviews, and professional announcements.

==Conferences==
The SFRA hosts an annual scholarly conference, which meets in a different location each year.  Meetings have been held predominately in the United States in such places as New York, New York (1970), Lawrence, Kansas (1982, 2008), Las Vegas, Nevada (2005), and Atlanta, Georgia (2009).  However, its meetings have been held elsewhere when possible including the cities of St. Anne de Bellevue, Province of Quebec (1992), New Lanark, Scotland (2002), Guelph, Ontario (2003), Lublin, Poland (2011), and Detroit, Michigan (2012).

The 2012 SFRA Conference's theme was "Urban Apocalypse, Urban Renaissance:
Science Fiction and Fantasy Landscapes." Its Guest of Honor was Eric Rabkin, Arthur F. Thurnau Professor of English Language and Literature at the [[University of Michigan]] in Ann Arbor, and the guest speakers included Professor Steven Shaviro of Wayne State University and writers [[Saladin Ahmed]], [[Sarah Zettel]] (aka C.L. Anderson), and [[Minister Faust]].

==Awards==
The SFRA presents the following awards at its annual conference:

#[[Pilgrim Award]] - The Pilgrim Award, created in 1970 and named for [[J. O. Bailey]]'s pioneering book, ''Pilgrims through Space and Time'', honors lifetime contributions to SF and fantasy scholarship.
#[[SFRA Pioneer Award|Pioneer Award]] - The Pioneer Award, first given in 1990, recognizes the writer or writers of the best critical essay-length work of the year.
#[[Thomas D. Clareson Award for Distinguished Service|Clareson Award]] - The Thomas D. Clareson Award for Distinguished Service, first given in 1996, recognizes an individual for outstanding service activities, which may include promotion of SF teaching and study, editing, reviewing, editorial writing, publishing, organizing meetings, mentoring, and leadership in SF/fantasy organizations.
#[[Mary Kay Bray Award]] - The Mary Kay Bray Award, first given in 2002 and established in honor of the late scholar for whom it is named, recognizes the best essay, interview, or extended review to appear in the ''SFRA Review'' in a given year.
#[[Graduate Student Paper Award]] - The Graduate Student Paper Award, first given in 1999, recognizes the most outstanding scholarly essay read by a graduate student at the SFRA's annual conference.

A '''slowdown''' ([[British English|UK]]: '''go-slow'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cambridge Business English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XnAEiEaSPikC&amp;pg=PA786|date= 2011|publisher=CUP|isbn=978-0-521-12250-4|page=786| quote = ''slowdown'' [...] US (UK ''go-slow'') [...] a period when an organization's employees work more slowly and less effectively}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an [[industrial action]] in which employees perform their duties but seek to reduce [[productivity]] or efficiency in their performance of these duties.  A slowdown may be used as either a prelude or an alternative to a strike, as it is seen as less disruptive as well as less risky and costly for workers and their union.  Striking workers usually go unpaid and risk being replaced, so a slowdown is seen as a way to put pressure on management while avoiding these outcomes.  Other times slowdowns are accompanied by intentional sabotage on the part of workers to provide further disruption.

Nonetheless, workers participating in a slowdown are often punished, sometimes by firing and other times by law.

== Examples ==

At [[Ford]]'s plant in [[Dagenham]], UK, during the 1970s, workers introduced a slowdown after Ford management increased the [[production line]] speed from 18 to 21 feet per minute.  This was a second speed increase, and workers felt that this was unfair.  After a go-slow by production line staff, Ford management reduced the line speed back to 18 feet per minute.&lt;ref&gt;BBC Documentary "Ford's Dagenham Dream", broadcast Sun 6 Jun 2010 23:00 BBC Four&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, [[Qantas]] engineers introduced an unusual slowdown where right-handed engineers used only their left hands to operate essential tools.&lt;ref&gt;''The Age'' - "Qantas engineers pledge whacky, wrong-handed strike action", Gabrielle Costa, July 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rule-book slowdown==
Another form of slowdown is known as the rule-book slowdown. This refers to the "rule books" that govern workers' actions, usually either for safety or quality purposes. In practice, many rules are loosely interpreted in the interest of efficiency. A union seeking to employ a slowdown tactic may take advantage of these common rule oversights by having workers "work to rule", obeying each and every rule to the fullest extent, which consequently will greatly reduce productivity. 

This has the advantage of allowing workers and unions to claim that no malfeasance is being committed, since they are doing only what the management's rules actually require them to do. For instance, many subways are required to keep doors open for a certain amount of time at each stop, whereas in practice doors are often closed sooner. Likewise, a bus driver typically may take the same liberties with traffic law that drivers do, and are often overloaded with passengers, while an experienced pilot can safely fly in some inclement weather.  In a "rule-book" slowdown, the bus driver may drive more slowly and conservatively and with a proper passenger load, while the pilot may refuse to fly in mildly inclement weather.

Slowdowns are related to but can be distinguished from [[work-to-rule]], another action in which workers refuse to perform more than their required duties.

'''Sri Lankan Gypsy people''' are an ethnic group from [[Sri Lanka]] who trace their origins in India (Telugu areas of present Telugu land) centuries ago. They are the only nomadic group of people living in Ceylon and are known as the Ahikuntakas otherwise called Kuravans. They live in small palmyra huts for two or three days in one place. They mostly speak [[Telugu language|Telugu]], also known as [[Sri Lankan Gypsy Telugu]], a [[Dravidian language]] natively spoken in [[India]]. Various governments, [[NGO]]s and [[missionary]] societies have made attempts to settle them down, and thus some are settled in villages. Amongst the majority [[Sinhalese language|Sinhalese]] speakers they are known as ''ahikuntaka'', while amongst the minority [[Sri Lankan Tamils]] and [[Sri Lankan Moors|Muslims]] they are known as ''[[Kuravar]]''. Some make their living by [[fortune telling]], [[snake charming]] and using monkeys and dogs in performances. Those who are settled in resettlement villages are [[Subsistence agriculture|subsistence farmers]] and farm hands to other farmers. They also speak Sinhalese or [[Tamil language|Tamil]] based on their area of settlement. Most seem to be settled in the eastern [[Batticaloa district]].

==History==
[[File:Asian Family in Brazil.jpg|thumb|right|The great-grandchildren of these Japanese-Brazilian (''Nipo-brasileiros'') immigrants would be called ''Yonsei''.]]
The earliest organized group of Japanese emigrants settled in [[Mexico]] in 1897,&lt;ref name="mofa-Mexico"&gt;Ministry of Foreign Affairs: [http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/latin/mexico/index.html  ''Japan-Mexico Foreign Relations'']&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the four largest populations of Japanese and descendants of Japanese immigrants live in [[Brazil]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and [[Peru]].

''Yonsei'' is a term used in geographic areas outside Japan to specify the child of at least one ''Sansei'' (third generation) parent, who is the child of at least one ''Nisei'' (second generation), who is the child of at least one ''Issei'' parent. An Issei is a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] person who emigrated from Japan. Typically, if a person is ''Yonsei,'' more than one of his or her great-grandparents were born in Japan.

===American ''Yonsei''===
{{main|Japanese Americans}}
The term [[Yonsei Japanese American|''Yonsei'' Japanese American]] refers generally to ''Yonsei'' citizens of the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Murakami-Tsuda, Vicky. [http://www.discovernikkei.org/forum/en/node/1707 "A Yonsei's Reflections…on Unearthing My Family's Values,"] Discover Nikkei. June 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; but the term's usage is flexible—describing both ''emigrant'' and ''immigrant'' experiences. Most of the interned [[Japanese Peruvians|Japanese-Peruvian]] ''Nisei'' who were deported from Peru during World War II became naturalized American citizens; but they considered their naturalized children as ''Sansei,'' meaning three generations away from the emigrants who had sailed to South America at the turn of the century. From this perspective, the sons and daughters of these formerly stateless refugees would be ''Yonsei,'' even as offspring of parents who would be otherwise categorized as ''Issei'' or "first generation" immigrants would also be called ''Nisei.''&lt;ref&gt;Higashide, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ORE5wfUNdccC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=Adios+to+Tears:+The+Memoirs+of+a+Japanese-Peruvian+Internee+in+U.S.+Concentration+Camps&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=0_1#PPA222,M1  p. 222.]&lt;/ref&gt;

(2002). "Making Yonsei" in Okamura Jonathan (ed.) [https://books.google.com/books?id=lE0OAAAACAAJ ''The Japanese American Contemporary Experience in Hawaii.''] Honolulu: [[University of Hawaii Press]]. {{ISBN|0-8248-2687-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which she compares and contrasts the ''yonsei'' generation with previous Hawaiian Japanese generations.&lt;ref name="Okamura-138"/&gt;

The ''yonsei'' differ from previous generation of Japanese-Americans in that the overt discrimination, World War II and the internment camps which overshadowed the lives of previous generations are concepts unrelated to their daily existence.&lt;ref name="Armbruster"&gt;Armbruster, Shirley. (1998-3-1). "Melding into the melting pot Third-generation Japanese-Americans who intermarry want their children to remember and honor their heritage", ''[[The Fresno Bee]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a lack of obvious struggles or difficulties faced by previous generations of Japanese-Americans, the ''yonsei'' are sometimes called the "spoiled generation".&lt;ref&gt;Okamura. (2008). p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''yonsei'' generation in Hawai'i can be compared to white Americans in the continental U.S. The ''yonsei'' have an equal, if not higher, educational, economic and political status as their continental white counterparts, and also have a low immigration rate, as Japanese immigration has declined since 1965.&lt;ref name="Ishikawa"&gt;Ishikawa, Juri (2006). ''Yonsei Japanese American Women in Hawai'i'' quoted in Okamura, Jonathan Y. (2008). ''Ethnicity and Inequality in Hawai'i'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=mmqx_G9qzScC&amp;pg=PA144&amp;lpg=PA143#PPA144,M1 p.144.]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, intermarriage with non-Japanese became common in the Japanese American community in the 1960s. Intermarriage among Japanese Americans was at approximately 50% by the 1970s, and at 70% in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Armbruster"/&gt; This cultural distance from the original homeland results in a "symbolic" expression of ethnicity seen in both the continental white and the Hawaiian ''yonsei'' groups. Outside of the continental white population, the ''yonsei'' of Hawai'i are one of the few U.S. ethnic groups that express their ethnicity in a "symbolic" way.&lt;ref name="Ishikawa"/&gt;

While members of the ''sansei'' and ''yonsei'' generation may visit Japan, they tend to see this activity only as tourism. Japanese cultural structure is generally not present among the ''yonsei'' generation.&lt;ref&gt;Okamura. (2008). p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2006 study of ''yonsei'' women in Hawai'i, this generation of Japanese-Americans tends to assert their ethnicity in such "symbolic" ways as the celebration of holidays and ceremonies associated with Japan, eating ethnic foods, and the use of Japanese middle-names. The study noted that the ''yonsei'' generation considered its ethnicity to be less important than did previous generations of Japanese-Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Ishikawa (2006). [https://books.google.com/books?id=mmqx_G9qzScC&amp;pg=PA143&amp;lpg=PA143 p.143-144.]&lt;/ref&gt; Cheryl Lynn Sullivan, an ethnic research who specializes in the Japanese-American community of California, wrote, "It is common in the Japanese American community not to consider yonsei Japanese American -- they are 'just plain Americans.' This is especially true of children who are the offspring of Japanese American-Euro-American marriages."&lt;ref name="Armbruster"/&gt; Others celebrate their ancestry in cultural exchanges based around youth and sports events, e.g. [http://www.yonseiyouth.com/ Yonsei Basketball Association].

According to a 2011 columnist in ''The Rafu Shimpo'' of Los Angeles, "Younger Japanese Americans are more culturally American than Japanese" and "other than some vestigial cultural affiliations, a ''Yonsei'' or ''Gosei'' is simply another American."&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, George Toshio. [http://rafu.com/news/2011/02/itns-ja-newspapers/  "Into the Next Stage: Japanese American Newspapers: Over and Out?"] ''Rafu Shimpo'' (US). February 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Different organizations were created within the Japanese American community in order for the children of these Japanese American families to have a place where they could partake in different extracurricular activities, such as basketball, golf, baseball, etc. One such organization was the Yonsei Basketball Association, which was created in 1993 by Frank Kiyomura. Its mission statement is, "Our program was founded with a goal of providing a cultural exchange program for Fourth Generation Japanese-American youth from Southern California. We want to provide an opportunity for all participants to experience their heritage and cultural roots. In addition, we hope to provide a goodwill exchange of ideas and cultures by living with local Japanese families." Every year they give out scholarships to selected children from the Japanese American community and assemble both a boys' and girls' team together to send and play in a tournament in Japan.&lt;ref name="yonseibasketball"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yonseibasketball.org/|title=Yonsei Basketball Association &amp;#124;|publisher=yonseibasketball.org|accessdate=2014-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Japanese diaspora}}
The term ''[[Japanese diaspora|Nikkei]]'' (日系) was coined by a multinational group of sociologists and encompasses all of the world's Japanese immigrants across generations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discovernikkei.org/en/what/ "What is Nikkei?"] Japanese American National Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;   The collective memory of the ''Issei'' and older ''Nisei'' was an image of Meiji Japan from 1870 through 1911, which contrasted sharply with the Japan that newer immigrants had more recently left. These differing attitudes, social values and associations with Japan were often incompatible with each other.&lt;ref name="mclellan37"&gt;McLellan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NMm024458s4C&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=sansei+japanese+canadians&amp;lr=&amp;sig=ACfU3U19eRSR_W-IdoJTjJaAuhIOi6ihOA#PPA37,M1  p. 37.]&lt;/ref&gt;  In this context, the significant differences in life experiences and opportunities has done little to mitigate the gaps which separated generational perspectives amongst their children and grandchildren.

The ''Yonsei,'' their parents, their grandparents, and their children are changing the way they look at themselves and their pattern of accommodation to the non-Japanese majority.&lt;ref&gt;McLellan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NMm024458s4C&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=sansei+japanese+canadians&amp;lr=&amp;sig=ACfU3U19eRSR_W-IdoJTjJaAuhIOi6ihOA#PPA68,M1  p. 68.]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are currently just over one hundred thousand [[Japanese community in the United Kingdom|British Japanese]], mostly in [[London]]; but unlike other ''[[Japanese diaspora|Nikkei]]'' communities elsewhere in the world, these Britons do not conventionally parse their communities in generational terms as ''Issei,'' ''Nisei,'' or ''Sansei.'' Usually in Britain, there are only Issei and Nisei anyway, since Nisei almost always marry non-Japanese, and Issei to a lesser extent.&lt;ref&gt;Itoh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VBijCPLvWyUC&amp;pg=PA187&amp;dq=keiko+itoh++united+kingdom&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA7,M1  p. 7.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of ''yonsei'' who have earned some degree of public recognition has continued to increase over time; but the quiet lives of those whose names are known only to family and friends are no less important in understanding the broader narrative of the ''nikkei.'' Although the names highlighted here are over-represented by ''sansei'' from North America, the Latin American member countries of the [[Pan American Nikkei Association]] (PANA) include [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Mexico]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]], [[Uruguay]], in addition to the English-speaking [[United States]] and [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;National Association of Japanese Canadians: [http://www.najc.ca/thenandnow/relations_pana.php PANA] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218195725/http://www.najc.ca/thenandnow/relations_pana.php |date=February 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
