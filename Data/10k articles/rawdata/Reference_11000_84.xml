It is included in most [[Windows Server]] [[operating system]]s as a set of [[Process (computing)|processes]] and [[Windows service|services]].{{r|DSA-MSDN|WI4}} Initially, Active Directory was only in charge of centralized domain management. Starting with [[Windows Server 2008]], however, Active Directory became an umbrella title for a broad range of directory-based identity-related services.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A server running Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) is called a [[domain controller]]. It [[authentication|authenticates]] and [[authorization|authorizes]] all users and computers in a Windows domain type network—assigning and enforcing security policies for all computers and installing or updating software. For example, when a user [[login|logs into]] a computer that is part of a Windows domain, Active Directory checks the submitted password and determines whether the user is a [[system administrator]] or normal user.&lt;ref name="adw2k3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc780036(WS.10).aspx#w2k3tr_ad_over_qbjd|title=Active Directory on a Windows Server 2003 Network|date=13 March 2003|work=Active Directory Collection|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=25 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, it allows management and storage of information, provides authentication and authorization mechanisms, and establishes a framework to deploy other related services: Certificate Services, [[Active Directory Federation Services]], Lightweight Directory Services and [[Active Directory Rights Management Services|Rights Management Services]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://support.rackspace.com/how-to/installing-active-directory-on-windows-server-2012/|title=Install Active Directory Domain Services on Windows Server 2008 R2 Enterprise 64-bit.|last=|first=|date=2016-04-27|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Active Directory uses [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol]] (LDAP) versions 2 and 3, Microsoft's version of [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]], and [[Domain Name System|DNS]].{{TOC limit}}

==History==
Active Directory, like many information-technology efforts, originated out of a [[Democratization#Design|democratization of design]] using [[Request for Comments]] or RFCs. The [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF), which oversees the RFC process, has accepted numerous RFCs initiated by widespread participants. Active Directory incorporates decades of communication technologies into the overarching Active Directory concept then makes improvements upon them.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} For example, LDAP underpins Active Directory. Also [[X.500]] directories and the [[Organizational Unit]] preceded the Active Directory concept that makes use of those methods. The LDAP concept began to emerge even before the founding of Microsoft in April 1975, with RFCs as early as 1971. RFCs contributing to LDAP include RFC 1823 (on the LDAP API, August 1995),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1823.txt|title=The LDAP Application Program Interface|accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;RFC 2307, RFC 3062, and RFC 4533.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2307.txt|title      =An Approach for Using LDAP as a Network Information Service|accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3062.txt|title=LDAP Password Modify Extended Operation|accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4533.txt|title=The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Content Synchronization Operation|accessdate= 2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft previewed Active Directory in 1999, released it first with [[Windows 2000]] Server edition, and revised it to extend functionality and improve administration in [[Windows Server 2003]]. Additional improvements came with subsequent versions of [[Windows Server]]. In [[Windows Server 2008]], additional services were added to Active Directory, such as [[Active Directory Federation Services]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.computerperformance.co.uk/Longhorn/longhorn_new_features.htm|title = Windows Server 2008 - New Features|date = |accessdate = |website = ComputerPerformance.co.uk|publisher = Computer Performance Ltd|last = Thomas|first = Guy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The part of the directory in charge of management of domains, which was previously a core part of the operating system,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; was renamed Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS) and became a server role like others.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2006.11.futureofwindows.aspx|title = The Future Of Windows: Directory Services in Windows Server "Longhorn"|date = November 2006|accessdate = |website = [[TechNet Magazine]]|publisher = [[Microsoft]]|last = Hynes|first = Byron}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Active Directory" became the umbrella title of a broader range of directory-based services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn268294.aspx|title = What's New in Active Directory in Windows Server|date = |accessdate = |website = Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows Server 2012 Tech Center|publisher = [[Microsoft]]|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bryon Hynes, everything related to identity was brought under Active Directory's banner.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Active Directory Services==
Active Directory Services consist of multiple directory services. The best known is Active Directory Domain Services, commonly [[abbreviation|abbreviated]] as AD DS or simply AD.&lt;ref&gt;[https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd578336%28v=ws.10%29.aspx Active Directory Services technet.microsoft.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domain Services===
Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) is the cornerstone of every [[Windows domain]] network. It stores information about members of the domain, including devices and users, [[authentication|verifies their credentials]] and [[authorization|defines their access rights]]. The server (or the cluster of servers) running this service is called a [[domain controller]]. A domain controller is contacted when a user logs into a device, accesses another device across the network, or runs a line-of-business [[Metro-style app]] [[sideloading|sideloaded]] into a device.

Other Active Directory services (excluding [[#ADAM|LDS]], as described below) as well as most of Microsoft server technologies rely on or use Domain Services; examples include [[Group Policy]], [[Encrypting File System]], [[BitLocker]], [[Domain Name Services]], [[Remote Desktop Services]], [[Exchange Server]] and [[SharePoint Server]].

==={{anchor|ADAM}} Lightweight Directory Services===
Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (''AD LDS''), formerly known as ''Active Directory Application Mode'' (ADAM),&lt;ref name="Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa705886(VS.85).aspx | title=AD LDS | accessdate=28 April 2009 | publisher=Microsoft }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a light-weight implementation of AD DS.&lt;ref name="Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services versus AD DS"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc755080(v=ws.10).aspx | title=AD LDS versus AD DS | accessdate=25 February 2013 | publisher=Microsoft }}&lt;/ref&gt; AD LDS runs as a [[Windows service|service]] on [[Windows Server]]. AD LDS shares the code base with AD DS and provides the same functionality, including an identical [[API]], but does not require the creation of domains or domain controllers. It provides a ''Data Store'' for storage of directory data and a ''[[Directory (database)|Directory Service]]'' with an LDAP ''Directory Service Interface''. Unlike AD DS, however, multiple AD LDS instances can run on the same server.

===Certificate Services===
Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) establishes an on-premises [[public key infrastructure]]. It can create, validate and revoke [[public key certificate]]s for internal uses of an organization. These certificates can be used to encrypt files (when used with [[Encrypting File System]]), emails (per [[S/MIME]] standard), and network traffic (when used by [[virtual private network]]s, [[Transport Layer Security]] protocol or [[IPSec]] protocol).

AD CS predates Windows Server 2008, but its name was simply Certificate Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zacker|first1=Craig|editor1-last=Harding|editor1-first=Kathy|editor2-last=Jean|editor2-first=Trenary|editor3-last=Linda|editor3-first=Zacker|title=Planning and Maintaining a Microsoft Windows server 2003 Network Infrastructure|date=2003|publisher=Microsoft Press|location=Redmond, WA|isbn=0-7356-1893-3|pages=11–16&lt;!--This is a single page's number!--&gt;|chapter=11: Creating and Managing Digital Certificates}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AD CS requires an AD DS infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Active Directory Certificate Services Overview|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc731564%28v=ws.10%29.aspx|website=[[Microsoft TechNet]]|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federation Services===
{{Main article|Active Directory Federation Services}}
Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) is a [[single sign-on]] service. With an AD FS infrastructure in place, users may use several web-based services (e.g. [[internet forum]], [[blog]], [[online shopping]], [[webmail]]) or network resources using only one set of credentials stored at a central location, as opposed to having to be granted a dedicated set of credentials for each service. AD FS's purpose is an extension of that of AD DS: The latter enables users to authenticate with and use the devices that are part of the same network, using one set of credentials. The former enables them to use the same set of credentials in a different network.

As the name suggests, AD FS works based on the concept of [[federated identity]].

AD FS requires an AD DS infrastructure, although its federation partner may not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Step 1: Preinstallation Tasks|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc771806%28v=ws.10%29.aspx|website=[[Microsoft TechNet|TechNet]]|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rights Management Services===
{{Main article|Active Directory Rights Management Services}}
'''Active Directory Rights Management Services''' ('''AD RMS''', known as '''Rights Management Services''' or '''RMS''' before [[Windows Server 2008]]) is a server software for [[information rights management]] shipped with [[Windows Server]]. It uses encryption and a form of selective functionality denial for limiting access to documents such as corporate [[e-mail]]s, [[Microsoft Word]] documents, and [[web page]]s, and the operations authorized users can perform on them.

==Logical structure==
As a directory service, an Active Directory instance consists of a database and corresponding [[executable code]] responsible for servicing requests and maintaining the database. The executable part, known as Directory System Agent, is a collection of [[Windows service]]s and [[process (computing)|processes]] that run on Windows 2000 and later.&lt;ref name=DSA-MSDN&gt;{{cite web|title=Directory System Agent|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms675902%28v=vs.85%29.aspx|work=[[MSDN#Library|MSDN Library]]|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objects in Active Directory databases can be accessed via LDAP, ADSI (a [[component object model]] interface), [[messaging API]] and [[Security Accounts Manager]] services.&lt;ref name=WI4&gt;{{cite book |title=Microsoft Windows Internals: Microsoft Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, and Windows 2000|last=Solomon |first=David A. |last2=Russinovich |first2=Mark |authorlink2=Mark Russinovich |date=2005 |publisher=[[Microsoft Press]] |location=Redmond, Washington |isbn=0-7356-1917-4 |page=840 |edition=4th |authorlink=David A. Solomon |chapter=Chapter 13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Objects===
[[File:Publishing Company Network Diagram.png|thumb|A simplified example of a publishing company's internal network.  The company has four groups with varying permissions to the three shared folders on the network.]]Active Directory structures are arrangements of information about [[Object (computing)|objects]]. The objects fall into two broad categories: resources (e.g., printers) and [[security principal]]s (user or computer accounts and groups). Security principals are assigned unique [[security identifier]]s (SIDs).

Each object represents a single entity—whether a user, a computer, a printer, or a group—and its attributes. Certain objects can contain other objects. An object is uniquely identified by its name and has a set of attributes—the characteristics and information that the object represents— defined by a [[database schema|schema]], which also determines the kinds of objects that can be stored in Active Directory.

The [[schema object]] lets administrators extend or modify the schema when necessary. However, because each schema object is integral to the definition of Active Directory objects, deactivating or changing these objects can fundamentally change or disrupt a deployment. Schema changes automatically propagate throughout the system. Once created, an object can only be deactivated—not deleted. Changing the schema usually requires planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Windows Server 2003: Active Directory Infrastructure|year=2003|publisher=Microsoft Press|pages=1–8–1–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forests, trees and domains===
The Active Directory framework that holds the objects can be viewed at a number of levels. The forest, tree, and domain are the logical divisions in an Active Directory network.

Within a deployment, objects are grouped into domains. The objects for a single domain are stored in a single database (which can be replicated). Domains are identified by their [[Domain Name System|DNS]] name structure, the [[namespace]].

A domain is defined as a logical group of network objects (computers, users, devices) that share the same Active Directory database.

A tree is a collection of one or more domains and domain trees in a contiguous namespace, and is linked in a transitive trust hierarchy.

At the top of the structure is the ''forest.'' A forest is a collection of trees that share a common global catalog, directory schema, logical structure, and directory configuration. The forest represents the security boundary within which users, computers, groups, and other objects are accessible.

====Organizational units====
The objects held within a domain can be grouped into [[Organizational Unit]]s (OUs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Organizational Units | url = https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc978003.aspx | work = Distributed Systems Resource Kit ([[Microsoft TechNet|TechNet]]) | publisher = Microsoft | quote = An organizational unit in '''Active Directory''' is analogous to a directory in the file system | year = 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; OUs can provide hierarchy to a domain, ease its administration, and can resemble the organization's structure in managerial or geographical terms. OUs can contain other OUs—domains are containers in this sense. Microsoft recommends using OUs rather than domains for structure and to simplify the implementation of policies and administration. The OU is the recommended level at which to apply [[group policies]], which are Active Directory objects formally named Group Policy Objects (GPOs), although policies can also be applied to domains or sites (see below). The OU is the level at which administrative powers are commonly delegated, but delegation can be performed on individual objects or attributes as well.

Organizational units do not each have a separate namespace; e.g. user accounts with an identical username (sAMAccountName) in separate OUs within a domain are not allowed, such as "fred.staff-ou.domain" and "fred.student-ou.domain", where "staff-ou" and "student-ou" are the OUs. This is because sAMAccountName, a user object attribute, must be unique within the domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
        | title      = sAMAccountName is always unique in a Windows domain… or is it?
        | url        = http://blog.joeware.net/2012/01/04/2357/
        | publisher  = Joeware
        | date       = 4 January 2012
        | accessdate = 18 September 2013
        | quote       = examples of how multiple AD objects can be created with the same sAMAccountName}}
&lt;/ref&gt; However, two users in different OUs can have the same Common Name (CN), the name under which they are stored in the directory itself.

In general the reason for this lack of allowance for duplicate names through hierarchical directory placement, is that Microsoft primarily relies on the principles of [[NetBIOS]], which is a flat-file method of network object management that for Microsoft software, goes all the way back to [[Windows NT 3.1]] and [[MS-DOS]] [[LAN Manager]]. Allowing for duplication of object names in the directory, or completely removing the use of NetBIOS names, would prevent backward compatibility with legacy software and equipment. However, disallowing duplicate object names in this way is a violation of the LDAP RFCs on which Active Directory is supposedly based.

As the number of users in a domain increases, conventions such as "first initial, middle initial, last name" ([[Name order|Western order]]) or the reverse (Eastern order) fail for common [[family names]] like ''Li (李)'', ''Smith'' or ''Garcia''. Workarounds include adding a digit to the end of the username. Alternatives include creating a separate ID system of unique employee/student id numbers to use as account names in place of actual user's names, and allowing users to nominate their preferred word sequence within an [[acceptable use policy]].

Because duplicate usernames cannot exist within a domain, account name generation poses a significant challenge for large organizations that cannot be easily subdivided into separate domains, such as students in a public school system or university who must be able to use any computer across the network.

=====Shadow groups=====
[[File:Active directory - OUs can not be given rights to objects.png|thumb|In Active Directory, organizational units (OUs) cannot be assigned as owners or trustees. Only groups are selectable, and members of OUs cannot be collectively assigned rights to directory objects.]]
In Microsoft's Active Directory, OUs do not confer access permissions, and objects placed within OUs are not automatically assigned access privileges based on their containing OU. This is a design limitation specific to Active Directory. Other competing directories such as Novell [[Novell eDirectory|NDS]] are able to assign access privileges through object placement within an OU.

Active Directory requires a separate step for an administrator to assign an object in an OU as a member of a group also within that OU. Relying on OU location alone to determine access permissions is unreliable, because the object may not have been assigned to the group object for that OU.

A common workaround for an Active Directory administrator is to write a custom [[PowerShell]] or [[Visual Basic]] script to automatically create and maintain a ''user group'' for each OU in their directory. The scripts are run periodically to update the group to match the OU's account membership, but are unable to instantly update the security groups anytime the directory changes, as occurs in competing directories where security is directly implemented into the directory itself. Such groups are known as ''Shadow Groups''. Once created, these shadow groups are selectable in place of the OU in the administrative tools.

Microsoft refers to shadow groups in the Server 2008 Reference documentation, but does not explain how to create them. There are no built-in server methods or console snap-ins for managing shadow groups.&lt;ref&gt;Microsoft Server 2008 Reference, discussing shadow groups used for fine-grained password policies: https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc770394%28WS.10%29.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

The division of an organization's information infrastructure into a hierarchy of one or more domains and top-level OUs is a key decision. Common models are by business unit, by geographical location, by IT Service, or by object type and hybrids of these. OUs should be structured primarily to facilitate administrative delegation, and secondarily, to facilitate group policy application. Although OUs form an administrative boundary, the only true security boundary is the forest itself and an administrator of any domain in the forest must be trusted across all domains in the forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Specifying Security and Administrative Boundaries | url = https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc755979(WS.10).aspx | publisher = Microsoft Corporation | quote = However, service administrators have abilities that cross domain boundaries. For this reason, the forest is the ultimate security boundary, not the domain. | date = 23 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partitions===
The Active Directory database is organized in ''partitions'', each holding specific object types and following a specific replication pattern. Microsoft often refers to these partitions as 'naming contexts'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
        | title      = Active Directory Replication Traffic
        | url        = https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb742457.aspx
        | publisher  = Microsoft Corporation
        | author     = Andreas Luther
        | quote      = The Active Directory is made up of one or more naming contexts or partitions.
        | accessdate =26 May 2010    }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'Schema' partition contains the definition of object classes and attributes within the Forest. The 'Configuration' partition contains information on the physical structure and configuration of the forest (such as the site topology). Both replicate to all domains in the Forest.  The 'Domain' partition holds all objects created in that domain and replicates only within its domain.

==Physical structure==
''Sites'' are physical (rather than logical) groupings defined by one or more [[Internet Protocol|IP]] subnets.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; AD also holds the definitions of connections, distinguishing low-speed (e.g., [[Wide area network|WAN]], [[Virtual private network|VPN]]) from high-speed (e.g., [[local area network|LAN]]) links. Site definitions are independent of the domain and OU structure and are common across the forest. Sites are used to control network traffic generated by replication and also to refer clients to the nearest [[domain controller]]s (DCs). [[Microsoft Exchange Server|Microsoft Exchange Server 2007]] uses the site topology for mail routing. Policies can also be defined at the site level.

Physically, the Active Directory information is held on one or more peer [[domain controller]]s, replacing the [[Windows NT|NT]] [[Primary Domain Controller|PDC]]/[[Backup Domain Controller|BDC]] model. Each DC has a copy of the Active Directory. Servers joined to Active Directory that are not domain controllers are called Member Servers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; A subset of objects in the domain partition replicate to domain controllers that are configured as global catalogs. Global catalog (GC) servers provide a global listing of all objects in the Forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Global Catalog servers replicate to themselves all objects from all domains and hence, provide a global listing of objects in the forest. However, to minimize replication traffic and keep the GC's database small, only selected attributes of each object are replicated. This is called the partial attribute set (PAS). The PAS can be modified by modifying the schema and marking attributes for replication to the GC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Active Directory is fully integrated with DNS and requires [[TCPIP|TCP/IP]]—DNS. To be fully functional, the DNS server must support [[SRV record|SRV resource records]], also known as service records.

===Replication===
Active Directory synchronizes changes using ''[[multi-master replication]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

        | title     = Directory data store
        | url       = https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc736627(WS.10).aspx

        | title     = What Is the Active Directory Replication Model?

    }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Knowledge Consistency Checker'' (KCC) creates a replication topology of ''site links'' using the defined ''sites'' to manage traffic. Intrasite replication is frequent and automatic as a result of change notification, which triggers peers to begin a pull replication cycle. Intersite replication intervals are typically less frequent and do not use change notification by default, although this is configurable and can be made identical to intrasite replication.

Each link can have a 'cost' (e.g., [[Digital Signal 3|DS3]], [[Digital Signal 1|T1]], [[ISDN]] etc.) and the KCC alters the site link topology accordingly. Replication may occur transitively through several site links on same-protocol ''site link bridges'', if the cost is low, although KCC automatically costs a direct site-to-site link lower than transitive connections. Site-to-site replication can be configured to occur between a ''bridgehead server'' in each site, which then replicates the changes to other DCs within the site. Replication for Active Directory zones is automatically configured when DNS is activated in the domain based by site.

Replication of Active Directory uses [[Remote Procedure Call]]s (RPC) over IP (RPC/IP). Between Sites [[SMTP]] can be used for replication, but only for changes in the Schema, Configuration, or Partial Attribute Set (Global Catalog) GCs. SMTP cannot be used for replicating the default Domain partition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Implementation==
In general, a network utilizing Active Directory has more than one licensed Windows server computer. Backup and restore of Active Directory is possible for a network with a single domain controller,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb727048.aspx |title=Active Directory Backup and Restore |work=[[Microsoft TechNet|TechNet]] |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Microsoft recommends more than one domain controller to provide automatic [[failover]] protection of the directory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AD DS: All domains should have at least two functioning domain controllers for redundancy |work=[[Microsoft TechNet|TechNet]] |url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd378865%28v=ws.10%29.aspx |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domain controllers are also ideally single-purpose for directory operations only, and should not run any other software or role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |quote=Whenever possible, your domain controllers should run on dedicated servers (physical or virtual). |title=10 tips for effective Active Directory design |first=Brien |last=Posey |work=[[TechRepublic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=23 August 2010 |url=http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/10-things/10-tips-for-effective-active-directory-design |accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain Microsoft products such as SQL Server&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=You may encounter problems when installing SQL Server on a domain controller (Revision 3.0) |work=Support |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2032911 |date=7 January 2013 |accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |quote=For security and performance reasons, we recommend that you do not install a standalone SQL Server on a domain controller. |work=Microsoft SQL Server blog |title=Can I install SQL Server on a domain controller? |last=Degremont |first=Michel |url=http://blogs.technet.com/b/mdegre/archive/2011/07/01/can-i-install-sql-server-on-a-domain-controller.aspx |date=30 Jun 2011 |accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Exchange&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Installing Exchange on a domain controller is not recommended |work=[[Microsoft TechNet|TechNet]] |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=22 March 2013 |url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms.exch.setupreadiness.warninginstallexchangerolesondomaincontroller%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx |accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; can interfere with the operation of a domain controller, necessitating isolation of these products on additional Windows servers.

Physical hardware costs for the many separate servers can be reduced through the use of [[virtualization]], although for proper failover protection, Microsoft recommends not running multiple virtualized domain controllers on the same physical hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |quote=You should attempt to avoid creating potential single points of failure when you plan your virtual domain controller deployment.frank |title=Running Domain Controllers in Hyper-V |work=[[Microsoft TechNet|TechNet]] |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/d2cae85b-41ac-497f-8cd1-5fbaa6740ffe%28v=ws.10%29#bkmk1_planning_to_virtualize_domain_controllers |at=Planning to Virtualize Domain Controllers |accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Database==
The Active-Directory [[database]], the ''directory store'', in Windows 2000 Server uses the [[Microsoft JET Blue|JET Blue]]-based [[Extensible Storage Engine]] (ESE98) and is limited to 16 terabytes and 2 billion objects (but only 1 billion security principals) in each domain controller's database. Microsoft has created NTDS databases with more than 2 billion objects.&lt;ref name="blogs.technet.com"&gt;
{{cite web|author=efleis |url=http://blogs.technet.com/efleis/archive/2006/06/08/434255.aspx |title=Large AD database? Probably not this large |publisher=Blogs.technet.com |date=8 June 2006 |accessdate=20 November 2011}}
&lt;/ref&gt; (NT4's [[Security Account Manager]] could support no more than 40,000 objects). Called NTDS.DIT, it has two main tables: the ''data table'' and the ''link table''.  Windows Server 2003 added a third main table for [[security descriptor]] single instancing.&lt;ref name="blogs.technet.com"/&gt;

Programs may access the features of Active Directory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Berkouwer | first=Sander| title=Active Directory basics | url=http://www.veeam.com/wp-active-directory-basics.html | publisher=[[Veeam Software]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; via the [[Component Object Model|COM interfaces]] provided by ''Active Directory Service Interfaces''.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa772170%28VS.85%29.aspx Active Directory Service Interfaces], Microsoft&lt;/ref&gt;

==Single server operations==
[[FSMO|Flexible Single Master Operations Roles]] (FSMO, pronounced "fizz-mo") operations are also known as operations master roles. Although domain controllers allow simultaneous updates in multiple places, certain operations are supported only on a single server. These operations are performed using the roles listed below:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!width="140px"| Role name
!width="140px"| Scope
! Description
|-
| Schema Master
| 1 per forest
| Schema modifications
|-
| Domain Naming Master
| 1 per forest
| Addition and removal of domains if present in root domain
|-
| PDC Emulator
| 1 per domain
| Provides backwards compatibility for NT4 clients for PDC operations (like password changes).  The PDC runs domain specific processes such as the Security Descriptor Propagator (SDP), and is the master time server within the domain. It also handles external trusts, the DFS consistency check, holds current passwords and manages all GPOs as default server.
|-
| RID Master
| 1 per domain
| Allocates pools of unique identifiers to domain controllers for use when creating objects
|-
| Infrastructure Master
| 1 per domain/partition
| Synchronizes cross-domain group membership changes.  The infrastructure master should not be run on a global catalog server (GCS) unless all DCs are also GCs, or the environment consists of a single domain.

The ''Infrastructure Master'' role as described above is only for the domain partition (default naming context), ''netdom query fsmo'' and ''ntdsutil'' will only query the domain partition. However, every application partition, including Forest and Domain-level DNS domain zones has its own Infrastructure Master. The holder of this role is stored in the ''fSMORoleOwner'' attribute of the ''Infrastructure'' object in the root of the partition, it can be modified with ''ADSIEdit'', for example one can modify the ''fSMORoleOwner'' attribute of the ''CN=Infrastructure,DC=DomainDnsZones,DC=yourdomain,DC=tld'' object to ''CN=NTDSSettings,CN=Name_of_DC,CN=Servers,CN=DRSite,CN=Sites,CN=Configuration,DC=Yourdomain,DC=TLD''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/b77a7e5c-590e-4d23-a9cb-8c4c0f403baf/forestdnszones-and-domaindnszones-have-wrong-infrastructure-role-record?forum=winserverDS TechNet: ForestDNSZones and DomainDNSZones have wrong infrastructure role record]&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

==Trusting==
To allow users in one domain to access resources in another, Active Directory uses trusts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
        | title     = Domain and Forest Trusts Technical Reference
        | url       = https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc738955(WS.10).aspx
        | publisher = Microsoft Corporation
        | date      = 28 March 2003
        | quote     = Trusts enable [...] authentication and [...] sharing resources across domains or forests}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trusts inside a forest are automatically created when domains are created. The forest sets the default boundaries of trust, and implicit, transitive trust is automatic for all domains within a forest.

===Terminology===
;One-way trust
:One domain allows access to users on another domain, but the other domain does not allow access to users on the first domain.
;Two-way trust
:Two domains allow access to users on both domains.
;Trusted domain
:The domain that is trusted; whose users have access to the trusting domain.
;Transitive trust
:A trust that can extend beyond two domains to other trusted domains in the forest.
;Intransitive trust
:A one way trust that does not extend beyond two domains.
;Explicit trust
:A trust that an admin creates. It is not transitive and is one way only.
;Cross-link trust
:An explicit trust between domains in different trees or in the same tree when a descendant/ancestor (child/parent) relationship does not exist between the two domains.
;Shortcut
:Joins two domains in different trees, transitive, one- or two-way.
;Forest trust
:Applies to the entire forest. Transitive, one- or two-way.
;Realm
:Can be transitive or nontransitive (intransitive), one- or two-way.
;External
:Connect to other forests or non-AD domains. Nontransitive, one- or two-way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
        | title      =Domain and Forest Trusts Work

        | quote       = Defines several kinds of trusts. (automatic, shortcut, forest, realm, external)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;PAM trust
:A one-way trust used by [[Microsoft Identity Manager]] from a (possibly low-level) production forest to a ([[Windows Server 2016]] functionality level) 'bastion' forest, which issues time-limited group memberships.&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-identity-manager/pam/privileged-identity-management-for-active-directory-domain-services Microsoft Identity Manager: Privileged Access Management for Active Directory Domain Services]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/33363.mim-2016-privileged-access-management-pam-faq.aspx TechNet: MIM 2016: Privileged Access Management (PAM) - FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Forest trusts====
Windows Server 2003 introduced the ''forest root trust''. This trust can be used to connect Windows Server 2003 forests if they are operating at the 2003 forest functional level. Authentication across this type of trust is [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]]-based (as opposed to [[NTLM]]).

Forest trusts are transitive for all the domains  the trusted forests.  However, forest trusts are ''not'' transitive '''between''' forests.

'''Example''':  Suppose that a two-way transitive forest trust exists between the forest root domains in Forest A and Forest B, and another two-way transitive forest trust exists between the forest root domains in Forest B and Forest C. Such a configuration lets users in Forest B access resources in any domain in either Forest A or Forest C, and users in Forest A or C can access resources in any domain in Forest B. However, it does ''not'' let users in Forest A access resources in Forest C, or vice versa. To let users in Forest A and Forest C share resources, a two-way transitive trust must exist between both forests.

==Management solutions==
Microsoft Active Directory management tools include:
*Active Directory Users and Computers, 
*Active Directory Domains and Trusts, 
*Active Directory Sites and Services, 
*ADSI Edit, 
*Local Users and Groups, 
*Active Directory Schema snap-ins for [[Microsoft Management Console]] (MMC),

These management tools may not provide enough functionality for efficient workflow in large environments. Some third-party solutions extend the administration and management capabilities. They provide essential features for a more convenient administration processes, such as automation, reports, integration with other services, etc.

==Unix integration==
Varying levels of interoperability with Active Directory can be achieved on most [[Unix-like]] operating systems  (including [[Unix]], [[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]] or Java and Unix-based programs) through standards-compliant LDAP clients, but these systems usually do not interpret many attributes associated with Windows components, such as [[Group Policy]] and support for one-way trusts.

Third parties offer Active Directory integration for Unix-like platforms, including:

The schema additions shipped with [[Windows Server 2003 R2]] include attributes that map closely enough to RFC 2307 to be generally usable. The reference implementation of RFC 2307, nss_ldap and pam_ldap provided by PADL.com, support these attributes directly. The default schema for group membership complies with RFC 2307bis (proposed).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.padl.com/~lukeh/rfc2307bis.txt |title=RFC 2307bis |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927182939/http://www.padl.com/~lukeh/rfc2307bis.txt |archivedate=27 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Windows Server 2003 R2 includes a [[Microsoft Management Console]] snap-in that creates and edits the attributes.

An alternative option is to use another directory service as non-Windows clients authenticate to this while Windows Clients authenticate to AD. Non-Windows clients include [[389 Directory Server]] (formerly Fedora Directory Server, FDS), ViewDS Identity Solutions - ViewDS v7.2 [[XML Enabled Directory]]  and Sun Microsystems [[Sun Java System Directory Server]]. The latter two both being able to perform two-way synchronization with AD and thus provide a "deflected" integration.

Another option is to use [[OpenLDAP]] with its ''translucent'' overlay, which can extend entries in any remote LDAP server with additional attributes stored in a local database. Clients pointed at the local database see entries containing both the remote and local attributes, while the remote database remains completely untouched.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Administration (querying, modifying, and monitoring) of Active Directory can be achieved via many scripting languages, including [[PowerShell]], [[VBScript]], [[JavaScript|JScript/JavaScript]], [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], and [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Active Directory Administration with Windows PowerShell|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd378937%28WS.10%29.aspx|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using Scripts to Search Active Directory|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/library/ee692830.aspx|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ITAdminTools Perl Scripts Repository|url=http://www.itadmintools.com/2011/09/itadmintools-perl-script-repository.html|publisher=ITAdminTools.com|accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Win32::OLE|url=https://metacpan.org/module/Win32::OLE|publisher=Perl Open-Source Community|accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free and non-free AD administration tools can help to simplify and possibly automate AD management tasks.

Also since October 2017 Amazon [[Amazon Web Services|AWS]] offers integration with Microsoft Active Directory.&lt;ref&gt;https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/introducing-aws-directory-service-for-microsoft-active-directory-standard-edition/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AtlasMira1967 Cover.JPG|thumb|The Russian cover of the second 1967 edition]]
'''The World Atlas''' ({{lang-ru|Атлас мира|translit=Atlas mira||lit=Atlas of the World}}) is the Soviet and later Russian atlas of the world.

== Predecessors ==
Initially Russian [[cartography]] could not glory in original work: the ''Atlas Marksa'' (1905), for example, was merely a translation of German ''Neuer Handatlas'' by Debes. The large ''Atlas Mira'' (1st Russian edition, 1954), with some 200,000 names meant a very special{{peacock-term|date=April 2018}} achievement. An English editions later followed (''The World Atlas'', 2nd ed., 1967). A similar Soviet project ''Bolshoi Sovietskii Atlas Mira'', which was intended to be the most comprehensive atlas of modern times, remained, however, incomplete due to WWII; only two out of three planned volumes (1937/39) were published.

== Editions ==
{{cleanup|section|reason=Section needs references, tone cleanup, and wikifying|date=October 2018}}
=== First Edition ===
{{Expand section|date=August 2017}}
The first edition was made in 1954. Contains 283 pages of maps with a separated book of geographical index carries 205000 items that cover all of the maps. 

On the first page of the atlas is a vignette with a world map inside a five-pointed star, prominently depicting the Soviet Union. Thereafter is the title page, on the reverse side the decision of the Council of Ministers of the USSR to publish the atlas, a page with the names of the editorial board, a page with the other editors, a preface of two pages and the table of contents in two pages.

First in the map section are two pages with a key to map symbols – also given as a separate sheet. Thereafter are the 283 pages with maps and finally a page with more names of collaborators, technical information and at the end the number of copies printed (25,000).
Many maps are on a double page, with a total width of 63 cm. The reverse side of the left-hand page which comes first in leafing through atlas – the 'title side' – usually has a scheme with the current map and the adjacent sheets. A map is printed on the reverse side of almost all right-hand pages. Some maps are even wider than 63 cm and therefore have a foldout; see the table of contents.

The index, a separate volume, has a title page, a preface of two pages, a page on how to use the index, and a page with the abbreviations used. Thereafter is the actual index of 545 pages. In the end are 14 pages with translations of non-Russian geographical terms and words that occur in place names.

After the key to map symbols the map section has 5 pages of world maps, 3 pages with historical maps, 76 pages with maps of the Soviet Union en 53 pages with maps of Western Europe – meaning in this case the part of Europe that is outside the Soviet Union. The non-Soviet part of Asia – here also named 'foreign Asia' – covers 53 pages, Africa 18, the Americas 57 and Australia-Oceania 12. In the end are 6 pages with maps of the Atlkantic Ocean, the mediterranean Sea and the Polar regions. See also the list of map names in transliteration and translation.

Most sections start with a physical map – with contour lines and hypsometric coloring – a political map and a map of the communications in the region in question. The rest of each section consists of physical maps at a larger scale; see the list of maps, inset maps and scale.
On the reverse sides of many right-hand pages are enlargements of regions on the 'main map'. Contrary to the main maps, on these maps the relief is often indicated with shading, which gives a more spatial effect. In the section on the Soviet Union each Union Republic has a map of its administrative subdivision in political coloring. A political map is sometimes also given for other regions. On some maps the forests are indicated; details can be found in the list of types of maps.

The size of the atlas is considerable and so is the number of maps. Many regions are therefore depicted in detail, often at a scale of 1:5,000,000, 1:2,500,000 or 1:1,250,000. This has been done in particular for the Soviet Union itself and the 'friendly' states in the world – Eastern Europe, China – but also for Western Europe and the United States. Remarkably these detailed maps are missing for Yugoslavia and the Netherlands. The environs of metropoles are sometimes given in (inset) maps at a scale of 1:250,000. Curiously, for the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe and China these city maps are absent.

In the preface (see also the English translation) account is given of the composition of the atlas. There is also an overview and account of the map projections used in the atlas.

=== Second Edition ===

A masterpiece{{peacock-term|date=April 2018}} of cartography, this Soviet atlas was published in Moscow in 1967 by the Chief Directorate of Geodesy and Cartography under the Council of Ministers of the USSR (GUGK; {{lang-ru|Главное управление геодезии и картографии (ГУГК) при Совете министров СССР}}). 
     
This was the second edition of ''The World Atlas'', first published in 1954. Although a lot of other atlases were published during the years in the Soviet Union under the name "Atlas Mira" (including pocket atlases), this one is the biggest and most detailed and might be probably denoted as "Great Atlas of the World" to distinguish it from all other smaller editions. Still on the cover it simply reads ''The World Atlas'' below the coat of arms of the Soviet Union in relief. It was published simultaneously in Russian and English in 25,000 copies and was priced at 42 [[Soviet rubles]]. Special cartographic paper and special cartographic offset ink were used. The Atlas was dedicated to the 50th anniversary of the [[October Revolution]]. The Atlas has a full 250 pages of colour maps, majority of them physical, the index being a separate book, comprising some 200,000 entries. The size of the Atlas is {{convert|55|x|32|cm}}. 
     
The maps in the Atlas are arranged in groups starting with general world maps, maps of the Soviet Union and maps of the continents. The world maps are in the 1:50,000,000 scale. The Soviet Union is treated basically as a separate continent with its own physical, political, transportation and time zone maps. It is mentioned in the preface that the number of the maps of the Soviet Union is decreased compared to the previous edition, because of the interim publishing of a separate atlas specifically dedicated to the Soviet Union. For each continent there is a general physical map as an introduction (1:10,000,000 to 1:25,000,000), followed by political and communications maps. This is followed by a number of general regional maps (1:1,500,000 to 1:750,000) and supplemented for important areas by large scale maps (1:250,000 to 1:750,000). 18 different colours are used from deep blue for the ocean deeps to dark brown and white for the highest mountains and glaciers. Relief shading is used for delineating relief along with contour lines. All scales are metric. Tint for elevation is predominately used in larger scale maps: 1:1,500,000 and higher. The shadows and colours combined give an almost stereo impression, the relief popping up out of the pages. Many major cities in the world are shown on separate maps or insets, typically in 1:250,000 scale as well as important areas like the [[Panama Canal]] or [[Palestinian territories|Palestine]], along with detailed maps of small islands in the world oceans.

=== Third edition ===
{{Expand section|date=August 2017}}
The third edition was made in 1999 by the Federal Service of Geodesy and Cartography of Russia. As a revised and updated world atlas since it first published in 1954, this atlas which combined maps and index into one volume is the only world atlas that guaranteeing that users will find the most current geographic information. That is the most authoritative atlas on the market only in both Russian and English. 
Providing the finest global coverage available, this Atlas is not only the best-selling volume of its size and price, but also the benchmark by which all other atlases are measured.
This atlas in third edition bringing each featured landscape to life with detailed terrain models and color schemes and offering maps of unsurpassed quality, this atlas features the main atlas, and an easy-to-reference index of all 240,000 place names.
All maps enjoy a full double-page spread, with continents broken down into 286 pages of carefully selected maps.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4713">'''Author name disambiguation''', also called '''personal disambiguation''' or '''disambiguation of people's names''', is a type of [[disambiguation]] and [[record linkage]] applied to the names of individual people. The process could, for example, distinguish individuals with the name "[[John Smith (disambiguation)|John Smith]]".

An editor may apply the process to scholarly documents where the goal is to find all mentions of the same author and cluster them together. Authors of scholarly documents often share names which makes it hard to distinguish each author's work. Hence, author name disambiguation aims to find all publications that belong to a given author and distinguish them from publications of other authors who share the same name.

==Methods==
Typical approaches for author name disambiguation rely on information about the authors such as their affiliations, email addresses, year of publication, co-authors, topic information to distinguish between authors. This information can be used to train a [[machine learning]] classifier to decide whether two author mentions refer to the same author or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference

 | doi = 10.1145/1555400.1555408
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other approaches use heuristics to distinguish between authors.

Research use various algorithms to do disambiguation.&lt;ref name="MannYarowsky2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mann|first1=Gideon S.|last2=Yarowsky|first2=David|title=Unsupervised personal name disambiguation|volume=4|year=2003|pages=33–40|doi=10.3115/1119176.1119181}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Two supervised learning approaches for name disambiguation in author citations|journal=IEEE Xplore|date=27 September 2004|doi=10.1109/JCDL.2004.240051}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HuangErtekin2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huang|first1=Jian|last2=Ertekin|first2=Seyda|last3=Giles|first3=C.

Lee|title=Online Person Name Disambiguation with Constraints|year=2015|pages=37–46|doi=10.1145/2756406.2756915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
There are multiple reasons that cause author names to be ambiguous, among which: individuals may publish under multiple names for variety of reasons including different spelling, misspelling, name change due to marriage, or the use of middle names and initials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | authorlink = Smalheiser, Neil R and Torvik, Vetle I
 | title = Author name disambiguation
 | journal = [[Annual Review of Information Science and Technology]]
 | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aris.2009.1440430113/full
 | accessdate = 2015-04-20
 | doi = 10.1002/aris.2009.1440430113
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Motivations for disambiguating individuals include identifying inventors from patents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morrison|first1=Greg|last2=Riccaboni|first2=Massimo|last3=Pammolli|first3=Fabio|title=Disambiguation of patent inventors and assignees using high-resolution geolocation data|journal=Scientific Data|date=16 May 2017|volume=4|pages=170064|doi=10.1038/sdata.2017.64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar issues==
Author name disambiguation is only one record linkage problem in the scholarly data domain. Closely related, and potentially mutually beneficial problems include: organisation (affiliation) disambiguation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference
 | author1-first = Ziqi | author1-last = Zhang |  author2-first = Andrea | author2-last = Nuzzolese | first3 = Anna Lisa | last3 = Gentile

}}&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as conference or publication venue disambiguation, since data publishers often use different names or aliases for these entities.

[[File:BenetsReadersEncyclopedia.jpg|thumb|First edition]]
'''''Benet's Reader's Encyclopedia''''' is a reference work devoted to world literature. The first volume appeared in 1948, edited by Pulitzer Prize-winner [[William Rose Benét]], older brother of the writer [[Stephen Vincent Benét]]. It was based on [[Ebenezer Cobham Brewer]]'s classic ''[[Dictionary of Phrase and Fable]]'', and offered a compendium of curious information (such as "[[Aani]]. In Egyptian mythology, the dog-headed ape sacred to the god [[Thoth]]"). The second edition appeared in 1965, and added illustrations.

More widely available is the third edition, edited by Katherine Baker Siepmann and published in 1987.  While this edition no longer mentions such arcane figures as Aani, it offers substantial background on a wide variety of literary figures and increased the international scope of the volume.  [[Jeppe Aakjaer]], for instance, appears as a novelist who "was intensely concerned with social misery and the need for reform," though he is "best known" for his "lyric poetry, in which he celebrates the courage of the peasants and the beauties of his native [[Jutland]]."

In 1996, the fourth edition of this useful reference work appeared. The fifth and to date most recent edition was released in December 2008.

Franklin earned the title of "The First American" for his early and indefatigable campaigning for [[Thirteen Colonies|colonial unity]], initially as an author and spokesman in London for several colonies. As the first [[United States Ambassador to France]], he exemplified the emerging American nation.&lt;ref&gt;H.W. Brands, ''The First American: The Life and Times of Benjamin Franklin'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin was foundational in defining the American ethos as a marriage of the practical values of thrift, hard work, education, community spirit, self-governing institutions, and opposition to authoritarianism both political and religious, with the scientific and tolerant values of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. In the words of historian [[Henry Steele Commager]], "In a Franklin could be merged the virtues of [[Puritanism]] without its defects, the illumination of the Enlightenment without its heat."&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson 2003, p. 491&lt;/ref&gt; To [[Walter Isaacson]], this makes Franklin "the most accomplished American of his age and the most influential in inventing the type of society America would become."&lt;ref&gt;Walter Isaacson, ''Benjamin Franklin'' (2003), p. 492&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin became a successful newspaper editor and printer in Philadelphia, the leading city in the colonies, publishing the ''[[Pennsylvania Gazette]]'' at the age of 23.&lt;ref&gt;H.W. Brands. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=B2bPCEbMAvwC&amp;pg=PA390 The First American: The Life and Times of Benjamin Franklin]''. (2010). p. 390.&lt;/ref&gt; He became wealthy publishing this and ''[[Poor Richard's Almanack]]'', which he authored under the [[pseudonym]] "Richard Saunders". After 1767, he was associated with the ''[[Pennsylvania Chronicle]]'', a newspaper that was known for its revolutionary sentiments and criticisms of British policies.

He pioneered and was first president of [[Academy and College of Philadelphia]] which opened in 1751 and later became the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. He organized and was the first secretary of the [[American Philosophical Society]] and was elected president in 1769. Franklin became a national hero in America as an agent for several colonies when he spearheaded an effort in London to have the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] repeal the unpopular [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]]. An accomplished diplomat, he was widely admired among the French as American minister to Paris and was a major figure in the development of positive [[France–United States relations|Franco-American relations]]. His efforts proved vital for the [[American Revolution]] in securing shipments of crucial munitions from France.

He was promoted to deputy postmaster-general for the British colonies in 1753, having been Philadelphia postmaster for many years, and this enabled him to set up the first national communications network. During the [[American Revolution|revolution]], he became the first [[United States Postmaster General]]. He was active in community affairs and colonial and state politics, as well as national and international affairs. From 1785 to 1788, he served as [[Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania#Presidents of Council|governor of Pennsylvania]]. He initially owned and dealt in slaves but, by the 1750s, he argued against [[slavery]] from an economic perspective and became one of the most prominent [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]].

His colorful life and legacy of scientific and political achievement, and his status as one of America's most influential Founding Fathers, have seen Franklin honored more than two centuries after his death on [[Franklin half dollar|coinage]] and the [[United States one hundred-dollar bill|$100 bill]], [[USS Benjamin Franklin (SSBN-640)|warships]], and [[List of places named for Benjamin Franklin|the names of many towns]], counties, educational institutions, and corporations, as well as countless [[Benjamin Franklin in popular culture|cultural references]].

==Ancestry==
Benjamin Franklin's father, [[Josiah Franklin]], was a [[tallow]] [[Chandlery|chandler]], a [[soaper]] and [[candle]]maker. Josiah was born at [[Ecton, Northamptonshire]], England on December 23, 1657, the son of blacksmith and farmer Thomas Franklin, and Jane White. Benjamin's father and all four of his grandparents were born in [[England]]. Josiah had seventeen children with his two wives. He married his first wife, Anne Child, in about 1677 in Ecton and immigrated with her to [[Boston]] in 1683; they had three children before immigrating, and four after. Following her death, Josiah was married to Abiah Folger on July 9, 1689 in the [[Old South Meeting House]] by [[Samuel Willard]]. Benjamin, their eighth child, was Josiah Franklin's fifteenth child and tenth and last son.

Abiah Folger was born in [[Nantucket, Massachusetts]], on August 15, 1667, to [[Peter Folger (Nantucket settler)|Peter Folger]], a miller and schoolteacher, and his wife, [[Mary Morrell Folger]], a former [[indentured servant]]. She came from a Puritan family that was among the first Pilgrims to flee to [[Massachusetts]] for [[freedom of religion|religious freedom]], when [[Charles I of England|King Charles I of England]] began persecuting Puritans. They sailed for Boston in 1635. Her father was "the sort of rebel destined to transform colonial America."&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson 2003, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; As [[court clerk|clerk of the court]], he was jailed for disobeying the local magistrate in defense of middle-class shopkeepers and artisans in conflict with wealthy landowners. Ben Franklin followed in his grandfather's footsteps in his battles against the wealthy [[William Penn|Penn]] family that owned the [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania Colony]].

==Early life in Boston==
[[File:Benjamin Franklin Birthplace 2.JPG|thumb|upright|Franklin's birthplace on [[Milk Street, Boston|Milk Street]], Boston, Massachusetts]]
[[File:Benjamin Franklin Birthplace.jpg|thumb|upright|Franklin's birthplace site directly across from the [[Old South Meeting House]] is commemorated by a [[bust (sculpture)|bust]] atop the second floor facade of this building.]]

Benjamin Franklin was born on [[Milk Street, Boston|Milk Street]], in [[Boston]], [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]], on January 17, 1706,&lt;ref name="Engber" /&gt;&lt;ref name="calendar group=Note"&gt;Contemporary records, which used the Julian calendar and the [[New Year#Historical Christian new year dates|Annunciation Style]] of enumerating years, recorded his birth as January 6, 1705. The provisions of the British [[Calendar (New Style) Act 1750]], implemented in 1752, altered the official British dating method to the Gregorian calendar with the start of the year on January 1 (it had been March 25). These changes resulted in dates being moved forward 11 days, and for those between January 1 and March 25, an advance of one year. For a further explanation, see: [[Old Style and New Style dates]].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Infant baptism|baptized]] at Old South Meeting House. He was one of seventeen children born to [[Josiah Franklin]], and one of ten born by Josiah's second wife, Abiah Folger; the daughter of [[Peter Foulger]] and [[Mary Morrill]]. Among Benjamin's siblings were his older brother [[James Franklin (printer)|James]] and his younger sister [[Jane Mecom|Jane]].

Josiah wanted Ben to attend school with the clergy, but only had enough money to send him to school for two years. He attended [[Boston Latin School]] but did not graduate; he continued his education through voracious reading. Although "his parents talked of the church as a career"&lt;ref name="autobio"&gt;{{cite book |last= Franklin |first= Benjamin |authormask= 2 |title= Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=qW4VAAAAYAAJ |accessdate=February 1, 2011 |series= Macmillan's pocket English and American classics |origyear= 1771 |year= 1901 |publisher=Macmillan |location= New York |page= vi |chapter= Introduction}}&lt;!-- Note: the introduction of this edition is the source for this quote; please do not change the edition without verifying the quote remains sourced. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; for Franklin, his schooling ended when he was ten. He worked for his father for a time, and at 12 he became an [[apprenticeship|apprentice]] to his brother James, a printer, who taught Ben the printing trade. When Ben was 15, James founded ''[[The New-England Courant]]'', which was [[History of American newspapers|the first truly independent newspaper in the colonies]].

When denied the chance to write a letter to the paper for publication, Franklin adopted the pseudonym of "[[Silence Dogood]]", a middle-aged widow. Mrs. Dogood's letters were published, and became a subject of conversation around town. Neither James nor the ''Courant'''s readers were aware of the ruse, and James was unhappy with Ben when he discovered the popular correspondent was his younger brother. Franklin was an advocate of free speech from an early age. When his brother was jailed for three weeks in 1722 for publishing material unflattering to the governor, young Franklin took over the newspaper and had Mrs. Dogood (quoting ''[[Cato's Letters]]'') proclaim: "Without freedom of thought there can be no such thing as wisdom and no such thing as public liberty without freedom of speech."&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, (2003) p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin left his apprenticeship without his brother's permission, and in so doing became a [[fugitive from justice|fugitive]].&lt;ref name="vandoren"&gt;Carl Van Doren, ''Benjamin Franklin''. (1938).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philadelphia==

At age 17, Franklin ran away to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, seeking a new start in a new city. When he first arrived, he worked in several printer shops around town, but he was not satisfied by the immediate prospects. After a few months, while working in a printing house, Franklin was convinced by Pennsylvania Governor [[Sir William Keith, 4th Baronet|Sir William Keith]] to go to London, ostensibly to acquire the equipment necessary for establishing another newspaper in Philadelphia. Finding Keith's promises of backing a newspaper empty, Franklin worked as a [[typesetter]] in a printer's shop in what is now the [[St Bartholomew-the-Great|Church of St Bartholomew-the-Great]] in the [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]] area of London. Following this, he returned to Philadelphia in 1726 with the help of Thomas Denham, a merchant who employed Franklin as clerk, shopkeeper, and bookkeeper in his business.&lt;ref name="vandoren"/&gt;

===Junto and library===
[[File:Franklin - ita, 1825 - 766672 R.jpeg|thumb|upright|''La scuola della economia e della morale'' (1825)]]
In 1727, Benjamin Franklin, then 21, created the [[Junto (club)|Junto]], a group of "like minded aspiring artisans and tradesmen who hoped to improve themselves while they improved their community." The Junto was a discussion group for issues of the day; it subsequently gave rise to many organizations in Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;On the importance of the Junto see Michael D. Mumford, "Social innovation: ten cases from Benjamin Franklin." ''Creativity research journal'' (2002) 14#2 pp. 253–66.&lt;/ref&gt; The Junto was modeled after English coffeehouses that Franklin knew well, and which had become the center of the spread of Enlightenment ideas in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;David Waldstreicher, ed., '' A Companion to Benjamin Franklin'' (2011) p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Leo Lemay, ''The Life of Benjamin Franklin, Volume 2: Printer and Publisher, 1730–1747'' (2005) pp. 92–94, 123&lt;/ref&gt;

Reading was a great pastime of the Junto, but books were rare and expensive. The members created a library initially assembled from their own books after Franklin wrote:

{{quote|A proposition was made by me that since our books were often referr'd to in our disquisitions upon the inquiries, it might be convenient for us to have them altogether where we met, that upon occasion they might be consulted; and by thus clubbing our books to a common library, we should, while we lik'd to keep them together, have each of us the advantage of using the books of all the other members, which would be nearly as beneficial as if each owned the whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Stuart A.P.|title=The library: an illustrated history|date=2009|publisher=[[Skyhorse Pub.]]|location=New York|isbn=978-1602397064}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This did not suffice, however. Franklin conceived the idea of a [[subscription library]], which would pool the funds of the members to buy books for all to read. This was the birth of the [[Library Company of Philadelphia]]: its charter was composed by Franklin in 1731. In 1732, Franklin hired the first American librarian, [[Louis Timothee]]. The Library Company is now a great scholarly and [[Library#Research library|research library]].&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Barton Korty, "Benjamin Franklin and eighteenth-century American libraries." ''Transactions of the American Philosophical Society'' (1965): 1–83. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1006049 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newspaperman===
Upon Denham's death, Franklin returned to his former trade. In 1728, Franklin had set up a printing house in partnership with [[Hugh Meredith]]; the following year he became the publisher of a newspaper called ''[[Pennsylvania Gazette|The Pennsylvania Gazette]]''. The ''Gazette'' gave Franklin a forum for agitation about a variety of local reforms and initiatives through printed essays and observations. Over time, his commentary, and his adroit cultivation of a positive image as an industrious and intellectual young man, earned him a great deal of social respect. But even after Franklin had achieved fame as a scientist and statesman, he habitually signed his letters with the unpretentious 'B. Franklin, Printer.'&lt;ref name="vandoren"/&gt;

[[File:Franklin the printer.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|left|Benjamin Franklin (center) at work on a [[printing press]]. Reproduction of a Charles Mills painting by the [[Detroit Publishing Company]].]]

In 1732, Ben Franklin published the first [[German language|German-language]] newspaper in America – ''Die Philadelphische Zeitung'' – although it failed after only one year, because four other newly founded German papers quickly dominated the newspaper market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://german.about.com/library/weekly/aa071299.htm|title=German Newspapers in the US and Canada|publisher=|accessdate=October 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin printed Moravian religious books in German. Franklin often visited [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]] staying at the [[Moravian Sun Inn]].&lt;ref&gt;John B. Frantz, "Franklin and the Pennsylvania Germans." ''Pennsylvania History'' (1998): 21–34. [https://journals.psu.edu/index.php/phj/article/viewFile/25467/25236 online]&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1751 pamphlet on demographic growth and its implications for the colonies, he called the [[Pennsylvania Dutch|Pennsylvania Germans]] "Palatine Boors" who could never acquire the "Complexion" of the English settlers and referred to "Blacks and Tawneys" as weakening the social structure of the colonies. Although Franklin apparently reconsidered shortly thereafter, and the phrases were omitted from all later printings of the pamphlet, his views may have played a role in his political defeat in 1764.&lt;ref&gt;Philip. Gleason, "Trouble in the Colonial Melting Pot." ''Journal of American Ethnic History'' (2000) 20#1 pp. 3–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin saw the printing press as a device to instruct colonial Americans in moral virtue. In ''Benjamin Franklin's Journalism'', Ralph Frasca argues he saw this as a service to God, because he understood moral virtue in terms of actions, thus, doing good provides a service to God. Despite his own moral lapses, Franklin saw himself as uniquely qualified to instruct Americans in morality. He tried to influence American moral life through construction of a printing network based on a chain of partnerships from the Carolinas to New England. Franklin thereby invented the first newspaper chain. It was more than a business venture, for like many publishers since, he believed that the press had a public-service duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frasca | first1 = Ralph | year = 1997 | title = Benjamin Franklin's Journalism | url = | journal = [[Fides et Historia]] | volume = 29 | issue = 1| pages = 60–72 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Coat of Arms of Benjamin Franklin.svg|thumb|upright|Coat of Arms of Benjamin Franklin]]

When Franklin established himself in Philadelphia, shortly before 1730, the town boasted two "wretched little" news sheets, [[Andrew Bradford]]'s ''The American Weekly Mercury'', and [[Samuel Keimer]]'s ''Universal Instructor in all Arts and Sciences, and Pennsylvania Gazette''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/225/index.html#7 Elizabeth Christine Cook, ''Colonial and Revolutionary Literature; Early National Literature, Part I. Colonial Newspapers and Magazines, 1704–1775'' (1917)]&lt;/ref&gt; This instruction in all arts and sciences consisted of weekly extracts from ''Chambers's Universal Dictionary''. Franklin quickly did away with all this when he took over the ''Instructor'' and made it ''The Pennsylvania Gazette''. The ''Gazette'' soon became Franklin's characteristic organ, which he freely used for satire, for the play of his wit, even for sheer excess of mischief or of fun. From the first, he had a way of adapting his models to his own uses. {{anchor|The Busy-Body}}{{anchor|The Busybody}}The series of essays called "The Busy-Body", which he wrote for Bradford's ''American Mercury'' in 1729, followed the general [[Joseph Addison|Addisonian]] form, already modified to suit homelier conditions. The thrifty Patience, in her busy little shop, complaining of the useless visitors who waste her valuable time, is related to the ladies who address Mr. Spectator. The Busy-Body himself is a true Censor Morum, as [[Isaac Bickerstaff]] had been in the ''Tatler''. And a number of the fictitious characters, Ridentius, Eugenius, Cato, and Cretico, represent traditional 18th-century classicism. Even this Franklin could use for contemporary satire, since Cretico, the "sowre Philosopher", is evidently a portrait of Franklin's rival, [[Samuel Keimer]].&lt;ref&gt;Cook, ''Colonial and Revolutionary Literature; Early National Literature, Part I. Colonial Newspapers and Magazines, 1704–1775'' (1917)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Pennsylvania Gazette'', like most other newspapers of the period, was often poorly printed. Franklin was busy with a hundred matters outside of his printing office, and never seriously attempted to raise the mechanical standards of his trade. Nor did he ever properly edit or collate the chance medley of stale items that passed for news in the ''Gazette.'' His influence on the practical side of journalism was minimal. {{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} On the other hand, his advertisements of books show his very great interest in popularizing secular literature. Undoubtedly his paper contributed to the broader culture that distinguished Pennsylvania from her neighbors before the Revolution. Like many publishers, Franklin built up a book shop in his printing office; he took the opportunity to read new books before selling them. {{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Franklin had mixed success in his plan to establish an inter-colonial network of newspapers that would produce a profit for him and disseminate virtue.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Frasca, ''Benjamin Franklin's Printing Network: Disseminating Virtue in Early America'' (2006) {{ISBN|978-0826216144}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], in 1731. After the second editor died, his widow Elizabeth Timothy took over and made it a success, 1738–46. She was one of the colonial era's first woman printers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baker | first1 = Ira L. | year = 1977 | title = Elizabeth Timothy: America's First Woman Editor | url = | journal = Journalism Quarterly | volume = 54 | issue = 2| pages = 280–85 | doi=10.1177/107769907705400207}}&lt;/ref&gt; For three decades Franklin maintained a close business relationship with her and her son Peter who took over in 1746.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Frasca, "'The Partnership at Carolina Having succeeded, was Encourag'd to Engage in Others': The Genesis of Benjamin Franklin's Printing Network", ''Southern Studies: An Interdisciplinary Journal of the South'' (2006), Vol. 13 Issue 1/2, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–23.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Gazette'' had a policy of impartiality in political debates, while creating the opportunity for public debate, which encouraged others to challenge authority. Editor Peter Timothy avoided blandness and crude bias, and after 1765 increasingly took a patriotic stand in the growing crisis with Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = Jeffery A. | year = 1993 | title = Impartiality and Revolutionary Ideology: Editorial Policies of the 'South-Carolina Gazette,' 1732–1735 | url = | journal = Journal of Southern History | volume = 49 | issue = 4| pages = 511–26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Franklin's ''Connecticut Gazette'' (1755–68) proved unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frasca | first1 = Ralph | year = 2003 | title = 'I am now about to establish a small Printing Office&amp;nbsp;... at Newhaven': Benjamin Franklin and the First Newspaper in Connecticut | url = | journal = Connecticut History | volume = 44 | issue = 1| pages = 77–87 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freemasonry===
In 1730 or 1731, Franklin was initiated into the local [[Masonic lodge]]. He became a [[Grand Master (Masonic)|Grand Master]] in 1734, indicating his rapid rise to prominence in Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=HC&gt;[[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]], ''Mysteries of the Freemasons: America'', video documentary, August 1, 2006, written by Noah Nicholas and Molly Bedell&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=freemasonry&gt;{{cite web| url=http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/franklin_b/franklin_b.html|title=Freemasonry Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon website |publisher=Freemasonry.bcy.ca|accessdate=September 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, he edited and published the first Masonic book in the Americas, a reprint of [[James Anderson (Freemason)|James Anderson]]'s ''[[Constitutions of the Free-Masons]]''.

===Common-law marriage to Deborah Read===
{{double image|right|Deborah ReadFranklin.jpg|160|Sarah Franklin Bache1793.jpg|160|[[Deborah Read|Deborah Read Franklin]]&lt;br /&gt;(c. 1759). Common-law wife of Benjamin Franklin|[[Sarah Franklin Bache]] (1743–1808). Daughter of Benjamin Franklin and Deborah Read}}

At age 17 in 1723, Franklin proposed to 15-year-old [[Deborah Read]] while a boarder in the Read home. At that time, Read's mother was wary of allowing her young daughter to marry Franklin, who was on his way to London at Governor [[Sir William Keith, 4th Baronet|Sir William Keith's]] request, and also because of his financial instability. Her own husband had recently died, and she declined Franklin's request to marry her daughter.&lt;ref name="vandoren"/&gt;

While Franklin was in London, his trip was extended, and there were problems with Sir William's promises of support. Perhaps because of the circumstances of this delay, Deborah married a man named John Rodgers. This proved to be a regrettable decision. Rodgers shortly avoided his debts and prosecution by fleeing to [[Barbados]] with her [[dowry]], leaving her behind. Rodgers's fate was unknown, and because of [[bigamy]] laws, Deborah was not free to remarry.

Franklin established a [[common-law marriage]] with Deborah Read on September 1, 1730. They took in Franklin's recently acknowledged young illegitimate son [[William Franklin|William]] and raised him in their household. They had two children together. Their son, [[Francis Folger Franklin]], was born in October 1732 and died of [[smallpox]] in 1736. Their daughter, [[Sarah Franklin Bache|Sarah "Sally" Franklin]], was born in 1743 and grew up to marry [[Richard Bache]], have seven children, and look after her father in his old age.

Deborah's fear of the sea meant that she never accompanied Franklin on any of his extended trips to Europe, and another possible reason why they spent so much time apart is that he may have blamed her for preventing their son Francis from being vaccinated against the disease that subsequently killed him.&lt;ref&gt;Coss, Stephen. [http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/benjamin-franklin-estranged-wife-nearly-two-decades-180964400/ "What Led Benjamin Franklin to Live Estranged From His Wife for Nearly Two Decades?"], ''[[Smithsonian Magazine]]'' (September 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Deborah wrote to him in November 1769 saying she was ill due to "dissatisfied distress" from his prolonged absence, but he did not return until his business was done.&lt;ref&gt;November 1769 [http://franklinpapers.org/franklin/framedVolumes.jsp?vol=16&amp;page=230a Letter] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180615055537/http://franklinpapers.org/franklin/framedVolumes.jsp?vol=16&amp;page=230a |date=June 15, 2018 }} from Deborah Read to Ben Franklin, ''franklinpapers.org''&lt;/ref&gt; Deborah Read Franklin died of a stroke in 1774, while Franklin was on an extended mission to England; he returned in 1775.

===William Franklin===
{{see also|William Franklin}}
[[File:WilliamFranklin.jpeg|thumb|upright|[[William Franklin]]]]

In 1730, 24-year-old Franklin publicly acknowledged the existence of his son William, who was deemed "illegitimate," as he was born out of wedlock, and raised him in his household. His mother's identity is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Skemp SL. ''William Franklin: Son of a Patriot, Servant of a King'', Oxford University Press US, 1990, {{ISBN|0195057457}}, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated in Philadelphia. Beginning at about age 30, William studied law in London in the early 1760s. He fathered an illegitimate son, [[William Temple Franklin]], born February 22, 1762. The boy's mother was never identified, and he was placed in foster care. Later in 1762, William married Elizabeth Downes, daughter of a [[plantation|planter]] from [[Barbados]]. After William passed the bar, his father helped him gain an appointment in 1763 as the last [[List of colonial governors of New Jersey|Royal Governor]] of New Jersey.

A [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]], William and his father eventually broke relations over their differences about the American Revolutionary War. The elder Franklin could never accept William's position. Deposed in 1776 by the revolutionary government of New Jersey, William was arrested at his home in [[Perth Amboy]] at the [[Proprietary House]] and imprisoned for a time. The younger Franklin went to New York in 1782, which was still occupied by British troops. He became leader of the Board of Associated Loyalists—a quasi-military organization, headquartered in New York City.

He settled in London, never to return to North America. In the preliminary peace talks in 1782 with Britain, "...&amp;nbsp;Benjamin Franklin insisted that loyalists who had borne arms against the United States would be excluded from this plea (that they be given a general pardon). He was undoubtedly thinking of William Franklin."&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt;

===Success as an author===
[[File:The General Magazine and Historical Chronicle Vol 1, January, 1741.jpg|thumb|upright|Franklin's ''The General Magazine and Historical Chronicle'' (Jan. 1741)]]

In 1733, Franklin began to publish the noted ''[[Poor Richard's Almanack]]'' (with content both original and borrowed) under the pseudonym Richard Saunders, on which much of his popular reputation is based. Franklin frequently wrote under pseudonyms. Although it was no secret that Franklin was the author, his Richard Saunders character repeatedly denied it. "Poor Richard's Proverbs", adages from this almanac, such as "A penny saved is twopence dear" (often misquoted as "A penny saved is a penny earned") and "Fish and visitors stink in three days", remain common quotations in the modern world. Wisdom in folk society meant the ability to provide an apt adage for any occasion, and Franklin's readers became well prepared. He sold about ten thousand copies per year—it became an institution.{{sfn|Van Doren|1938|p=109}} In 1741 Franklin began publishing ''The General Magazine and Historical Chronicle for all the British Plantations in America'', the first such monthly magazine of this type published in America.

In 1758, the year he ceased writing for the Almanack, he printed ''Father Abraham's Sermon'', also known as ''[[The Way to Wealth]]''. Franklin's [[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin|autobiography]], begun in 1771 but published after his death, has become one of the classics of the genre.

==Inventions and scientific inquiries==
{{Further|Social contributions and studies by Benjamin Franklin}}
Franklin was a prodigious inventor.

===Electricity===

Franklin started exploring the phenomenon of [[electricity]] in 1746 when he saw some of [[Archibald Spencer]]'s lectures using static electricity for illustrations.&lt;ref name=EncyColonial&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/science-and-medicine |title= Science and Medicine |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016 |website= Colonial America Reference Library |publisher= Encyclopedia.com |access-date=February 27, 2017 |quote= Franklin's interest in electricity originated when he saw a traveling scientific lecturer, Archibald Spencer, perform an "electricity show" in Boston, Massachusetts. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin proposed that "vitreous" and "resinous" electricity were not different types of "[[Aether theories|electrical fluid]]" (as electricity was called then), but the same "fluid" under different pressures.

In recognition of his work with electricity, Franklin received the [[Royal Society]]'s [[Copley Medal]] in 1753, and in 1756 he became one of the few 18th-century Americans elected as a Fellow of the Society. He received honorary degrees from [[Harvard]] and [[Yale]] universities (his first).{{sfn|Va Doren|1938|p=168}} The [[centimetre–gram–second system of units|cgs]] unit of electric charge has been named after him: one ''franklin'' (Fr) is equal to one [[statcoulomb]].

Franklin advised Harvard University in its acquisition of new electrical laboratory apparatus after the complete loss of its original collection, in a fire which destroyed the original [[Harvard Hall]] in 1764. The collection he assembled would later become part of the [[Harvard Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments]], now on public display in its [[Harvard Science Center|Science Center]].&lt;ref name="Tomase"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tomase|first1=Jennifer|title='A How-To Guide' explores Ben Franklin's 'can-do' legacy|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/2006/06.01/10-franklin.html|accessdate=2016-08-09|work=Harvard University Gazette|date=June 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin briefly investigated [[electrotherapy]], including the use of the [[electric bath (electrotherapy)|electric bath]].  This work led to the field becoming widely known.&lt;ref&gt;* Schiffer, Michael B, ''Draw the Lightning Down: Benjamin Franklin and Electrical Technology in the Age of Enlightenment'', pp. 136-137, 301, University of California Press, 2006 {{ISBN|0520248295}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kite experiment and lightning rod====

[[File:BEP-JONES-Franklin and Electricity.jpg|thumb|left|''Franklin and Electricity'' vignette [[Art and engraving on United States banknotes|engraved]] by the [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing|BEP]] (c. 1860)]]

In 1750,{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} he published a proposal for an experiment to prove that [[lightning]] is electricity by [[Kite experiment|flying a kite in a storm]] that appeared capable of becoming a lightning storm. On May 10, 1752, [[Thomas-François Dalibard]] of France conducted Franklin's experiment using a {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} iron rod instead of a kite, and he extracted electrical sparks from a cloud. On June 15 Franklin may possibly have conducted his well-known kite experiment [[St. Stephen's Episcopal Church (Philadelphia)|in Philadelphia]], successfully extracting sparks from a cloud. Franklin described the experiment in the ''[[Pennsylvania Gazette]]'' on October 19, 1752,&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Franklin, [http://franklinpapers.org/franklin/framedVolumes.jsp?vol=4&amp;page=360a "The Kite Experiment"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171102183234/http://franklinpapers.org/franklin/framedVolumes.jsp?vol=4&amp;page=360a |date=November 2, 2017 }}, printed in ''[[The Pennsylvania Gazette]]'', October 19, 1752.

Retrieved February 6, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Priestley]] published an account with additional details in his 1767 ''History and Present Status of Electricity''. Franklin was careful to stand on an insulator, keeping dry under a roof to avoid the danger of [[electric shock]].{{sfn|Van Doren|1938|p=159}} Others, such as Prof. [[Georg Wilhelm Richmann]] in [[Russia]], were indeed electrocuted in performing lightning experiments during the months immediately following Franklin's experiment.

In his writings, Franklin indicates that he was aware of the dangers and offered alternative ways to demonstrate that lightning was electrical, as shown by his use of the concept of [[ground (electricity)|electrical ground]]. Franklin did not perform this experiment in the way that is often pictured in popular literature, flying the kite and waiting to be struck by lightning, as it would have been dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mos.org/sln/toe/kite.html ''Franklin's Kite''], Museum of Science, Boston.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead he used the kite to collect some electric charge from a storm cloud, showing that lightning was electrical.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} On October 19 in a letter to England with directions for repeating the experiment, Franklin wrote:

{{quote|When rain has wet the kite twine so that it can conduct the electric fire freely, you will find it streams out plentifully from the key at the approach of your knuckle, and with this key a phial, or [[Leyden jar]], may be charged: and from electric fire thus obtained spirits may be kindled, and all other electric experiments [may be] performed which are usually done by the help of a rubber glass globe or tube; and therefore the sameness of the electrical matter with that of lightening completely demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, A., ''History of Science, Technology, and Philosophy in the Eighteenth Century''. New York, 1939. p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Franklin's electrical experiments led to his invention of the [[lightning rod]]. He said that conductors with a sharp&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/14/science/lightning-rods-franklin-had-it-wrong.html |title=''Lightning Rods: Franklin Had It Wrong'' |accessdate=2018-03-16 |work=New York Times |date=1983-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than a smooth point could discharge silently, and at a far greater distance. He surmised that this could help protect buildings from lightning by attaching "upright Rods of Iron, made sharp as a Needle and gilt to prevent Rusting, and from the Foot of those Rods a Wire down the outside of the Building into the Ground;&amp;nbsp;... Would not these pointed Rods probably draw the Electrical Fire silently out of a Cloud before it came nigh enough to strike, and thereby secure us from that most sudden and terrible Mischief!" Following a series of experiments on Franklin's own house, lightning rods were installed on the Academy of Philadelphia (later the [[University of Pennsylvania]]) and the Pennsylvania State House (later Independence Hall) in 1752.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=''Benjamin Franklin and Lightning Rods'' |volume=59 |page=42 |author=Krider, Philip |journal=Physics Today |date=January 2006|doi=10.1063/1.2180176 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Population studies===
Franklin had a major influence on the emerging science of [[demography]], or population studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Dr. Alan Houston| title=Benjamin Franklin and the Politics of Improvement| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dMN9VEhrTxwC&amp;pg=PA106| year=2008| publisher=Yale U.P.| pages=106–41| isbn=978-0300152395}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Malthus]] is noted for his rule of population growth and credited Franklin for discovering it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=I.

In the 1730s and 1740s, Franklin began taking notes on population growth, finding that the American population had the fastest growth rate on earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=J. A. Leo Lemay| title=The Life of Benjamin Franklin, Volume 3: Soldier, Scientist, and Politician, 1748–1757| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NL5bcRP5aRAC&amp;pg=PA245| year=2008| publisher=U. of Pennsylvania Press| page=245| isbn=978-0812241211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emphasizing that population growth depended on food supplies—a line of thought later developed by [[Thomas Malthus]]—Franklin emphasized the abundance of food and available farmland in America. He calculated that America's population was doubling every twenty years and would surpass that of England in a century.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson 2003, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; In 1751, he drafted "Observations concerning the Increase of Mankind, Peopling of Countries, &amp;c." Four years later, it was anonymously printed in Boston, and it was quickly reproduced in Britain, where it influenced the economist [[Adam Smith]] and later the demographer [[Thomas Malthus]]. Franklin's predictions alarmed British leaders who did not want to be surpassed by the colonies, so they became more willing to impose restrictions on the colonial economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Owen Aldridge | first1 = Alfred | year = 1949 | title = Franklin as Demographer | journal = Journal of Economic History | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 25–44 | jstor=2113719}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin was also a pioneer in the study of slave demography, as shown in his 1755 essay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=George William Van Cleve| title=A Slaveholders' Union: Slavery, Politics, and the Constitution in the Early American Republic| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dgp26Y2KzxUC&amp;pg=PA148| year= 2010| publisher=U. of Chicago Press| page=148| isbn=978-0226846699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atlantic Ocean currents===
As deputy postmaster, Franklin became interested in the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic Ocean]] circulation patterns. While in England in 1768, he heard a complaint from the Colonial Board of Customs: Why did it take British packet ships carrying mail several weeks longer to reach New York than it took an average merchant ship to reach [[Newport, Rhode Island]]? The merchantmen had a longer and more complex voyage because they left from London, while the packets left from [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] in Cornwall.

Franklin put the question to his cousin Timothy Folger, a [[Nantucket]] whaler captain, who told him that merchant ships routinely avoided a strong eastbound mid-ocean current. The mail packet captains sailed dead into it, thus fighting an adverse current of {{convert|3|mph|km/h|0}}. Franklin worked with Folger and other experienced ship captains, learning enough to chart the current and name it the [[Gulf Stream]], by which it is still known today.

Franklin published his Gulf Stream chart in 1770 in England, where it was completely ignored. Subsequent versions were printed in France in 1778 and the U.S. in 1786. The British edition of the chart, which was the original, was so thoroughly ignored that everyone assumed it was lost forever until Phil Richardson, a [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution|Woods Hole oceanographer]] and Gulf Stream expert, discovered it in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque Nationale]] in Paris in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Philip L. Richardson (February 8, 1980), "Benjamin Franklin and Timothy Folger's first printed chart of the Gulf Stream", ''Science'', vol. 207, no. 4431, pp. 643–45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philly.com/philly/news/special_packages/inquirer/How_Franklin_s_chart_resurfaced.html "How Franklin's chart resurfaced"], ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'', posted December 18, 2005, accessed November 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This find received front-page coverage in ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;John N. Wilford, "Prints of Franklin's chart of Gulf Stream found", ''New York Times'' (N.Y., N.Y.), pp. A1, B7 (February 6, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

It took many years for British sea captains to adopt Franklin's advice on navigating the current; once they did, they were able to trim two weeks from their sailing time.&lt;ref&gt;1785: Benjamin Franklin's "Sundry Maritime Observations,"
 The Academy of Natural Sciences, April 1939&amp;nbsp;m&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/library/readings/gulf/gulf.html ''1785: Benjamin Franklin's 'Sundry Maritime Observations' ''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002000344/http://www.oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/library/readings/gulf/gulf.html |date=October 2, 2008 }} NOAA Ocean Explorer.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1853, the oceanographer and cartographer [[Matthew Fontaine Maury]] noted that while Franklin charted and codified the Gulf Stream, he did not discover it:

{{quote|Though it was Dr. Franklin and Captain Tim Folger, who first turned the Gulf Stream to nautical account, the discovery that there was a Gulf Stream cannot be said to belong to either of them, for its existence was known to [[Peter Martyr d'Anghiera]], and to [[Sir Humphrey Gilbert]], in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Source: ''Explanations and Sailing Directions to Accompany the Wind and Current Charts'', 1853, p. 53, by [[Matthew Fontaine Maury]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Wave theory of light===
Franklin was, along with his contemporary [[Leonhard Euler]], the only major scientist who supported [[Christiaan Huygens]]'s [[wave theory of light]], which was basically ignored by the rest of the [[scientific community]]. In the 18th century [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] [[corpuscular theory of light|corpuscular theory]] was held to be true; only after [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Young's]] well-known [[slit experiment]] in 1803 were most scientists persuaded to believe Huygens's theory.&lt;ref&gt;Jogn Gribbin, "In search of Schrödinger's cat", Black Swan, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meteorology===
On October 21, 1743, according to popular myth, a storm moving from the southwest denied Franklin the opportunity of witnessing a [[lunar eclipse]]. Franklin was said to have noted that the [[prevailing winds]] were actually from the northeast, contrary to what he had expected. In correspondence with his brother, Franklin learned that the same storm had not reached Boston until after the eclipse, despite the fact that Boston is to the northeast of Philadelphia. He deduced that storms do not always travel in the direction of the prevailing wind, a concept that greatly influenced [[meteorology]].&lt;ref&gt;Heidorn, Keith C. Heidorn, PhD. [http://www.islandnet.com/~see/weather/almanac/arc2003/alm03oct.htm ''Eclipsed By Storm''.] The Weather Doctor. October 1, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Icelandic volcanic eruption of [[Laki]] in 1783, and the subsequent harsh European winter of 1784, Franklin made observations connecting the causal nature of these two separate events. He wrote about them in a lecture series.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dartmouth.edu/~volcano/Fr373p77.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traction kiting===
Though Benjamin Franklin has been most noted kite-wise with his lightning experiments, he has also been noted by many for his using kites to pull humans and ships across waterways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/34193/34193-h/34193-h.htm| title= The True Benjamin Franklin| first= Sydney George| last= Fisher| year=1903 |publisher=J.

Lippincott Company| location=Philadelphia| edition=5|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[George Pocock (inventor)|George Pocock]] in the book ''A TREATISE on The Aeropleustic Art, or Navigation in the Air, by means of Kites, or Buoyant Sails''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oMo-DVp_ypUC| title= A TREATISE on The Aeropleustic Art, or Navigation in the Air, by means of Kites, or Buoyant Sails| first=George| last=Pocock| page=9| publisher=Longmans, Brown, and Co.| location=London| year=1851}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted being inspired by Benjamin Franklin's traction of his body by kite power across a waterway. In his later years he suggested using the technique for pulling ships.

===Concept of cooling===
Franklin noted a principle of [[refrigeration]] by observing that on a very hot day, he stayed cooler in a wet shirt in a breeze than he did in a dry one. To understand this phenomenon more clearly Franklin conducted experiments. In 1758 on a warm day in [[Cambridge]], England, Franklin and fellow scientist [[John Hadley (chemist)|John Hadley]] experimented by continually wetting the ball of a mercury [[thermometer]] with [[diethyl ether|ether]] and using [[bellows]] to evaporate the ether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historycarper.com/resources/twobf3/letter1.htm |title=The Writings of Benjamin Franklin: London, 1757–1775 |publisher=Historycarper.com |accessdate=September 14, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128075748/http://www.historycarper.com/resources/twobf3/letter1.htm |archivedate=January 28, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; With each subsequent [[evaporation]], the thermometer read a lower temperature, eventually reaching {{convert|7|F}}. Another thermometer showed that the room temperature was constant at {{convert|65|F}}. In his letter ''[[Cooling by Evaporation]]'', Franklin noted that, "One may see the possibility of freezing a man to death on a warm summer's day."

===Temperature's effect on electrical conductivity===
According to [[Michael Faraday]], Franklin's experiments on the non-conduction of ice are worth mentioning, although the law of the general effect of liquefaction on electrolytes is not attributed to Franklin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Faraday |first=Michael |title=Experimental researches in electricity |url=https://books.google.com/?id=XuITAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=non-conduction+of+ice#v=onepage&amp;q=non-conduction%20of%20ice |page=v |volume=2 |year=1839 |publisher=R. &amp; J.E. Taylor |quote=...&amp;nbsp;Franklin's experiments on the non-conduction of ice&amp;nbsp;...}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as reported in 1836 by Prof. A. D. Bache of the University of Pennsylvania, the law of the effect of heat on the conduction of bodies otherwise non-conductors, for example, glass, could be attributed to Franklin. Franklin writes, "...&amp;nbsp;A certain quantity of heat will make some bodies good conductors, that will not otherwise conduct&amp;nbsp;..." and again, "...&amp;nbsp;And water, though naturally a good conductor, will not conduct well when frozen into ice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Thomas P. |title=Journal of the Franklin Institute of the State of Pennsylvania |url=https://books.google.com/?id=zV9DAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PP7&amp;dq=Thomas+P.+Jones+1836+Journal+of+the+Franklin+Institute+vol.xvii |pages=182–83 |year=1836 |quote=In the fourth series of his electrical researches, Mr. Faraday&amp;nbsp;... |publisher=Pergamon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1772 letter to [[Joseph Priestley]], Franklin lays out the earliest known description of the Pro &amp; Con list,&lt;ref name="decisions"&gt;{{cite book |last=Franklin |first=Benjamin |authorlink=Benjamin Franklin |year=1975 |origyear=1772 |chapter=To Joseph Priestley |editor-last=Willcox |editor-first=William Bradford |title=The papers of Benjamin Franklin: January 1 through December 31, 1772 |volume=19 |location=New Haven |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |pages=299–300 |isbn=978-0300018653 |oclc=310601 |chapterurl=http://franklinpapers.org/yale?vol=19&amp;page=299a |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; a common [[decision-making]] technique, now sometimes called a [[decisional balance sheet]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;my Way is, to divide half a Sheet of Paper by a Line into two Columns, writing over the one ''Pro'', and over the other ''Con''. Then during three or four Days Consideration I put down under the different Heads short Hints of the different Motives that at different Times occur to me for or against the Measure. When I have thus got them all together in one View, I endeavour to estimate their respective Weights; and where I find two, one on each side, that seem equal, I strike them both out: If I find a Reason ''pro'' equal to some two Reasons ''con'', I strike out the three. If I judge some two Reasons ''con'' equal to some three Reasons ''pro'', I strike out the five; and thus proceeding I find at length where the Ballance lies; and if after a Day or two of farther Consideration nothing new that is of Importance occurs on either side, I come to a Determination accordingly.&lt;ref name="decisions" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Oil on water===
While traveling on a ship, Franklin had observed that the wake of a ship [[storm oil|was diminished]] when the cooks scuttled their greasy water. He studied the effects on a large pond in [[Clapham Common]], London. "I fetched out a cruet of oil and dropt a little of it on the water&amp;nbsp;... though not more than a teaspoon full, produced an instant calm over a space of several yards square." He later used the trick to "calm the waters" by carrying "a little oil in the hollow joint of my cane".&lt;ref&gt;*W. Gratzer, Eurekas and Euphorias, pp. 80–81&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical endeavors==
[[File:Glassharmonica.png|thumb|[[Glass harmonica]]]]

Franklin is known to have played the violin, the [[harp]], and the guitar. He also composed music, notably a [[string quartet]] in [[classical period (music)|early classical style]]. While he was in London, he developed a much-improved version of the [[glass harmonica]], in which the glasses rotate on a shaft, with the player's fingers held steady, instead of the other way around. He worked with the London glassblower Charles James to create it, and instruments based on his mechanical version soon found their way to other parts of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, Thomas. [http://www.finkenbeiner.com/gh.html ''The Glassharmonica''.] GFI Scientific.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joesph Haydn]] (a fan of Franklin's enlightened ideas) had a glass harmonica in his instrument collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robin |last=Watefield |author-link=Robin Waterfield |title=Hidden Depths: The Story of Hypnosis: The Story of Hypnosis |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=JtJ5F1cr8WEC&amp;pg=PA67 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |date=1 August 2003 |page=67 |isbn=9781135403676}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Beethoven]] wrote a sonata for the glass harmonica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/feb/25/news/mn-30005 |title='Armonicists' Debate Source of Beethoven's Maladies |first=Richard |last=Benke |date=25 February 2001 |access-date=21 August 2018 |newspaper=[[LA Times]] |location=Corrales, N.M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1983/1129/112916.html |title=Franklin invented it, Mozart wrote for it: the 'armonica' returns |last=Carmel |first=Jeffrey J. |date=22 November 1983 |access-date=21 August 2018 |work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chess==
Franklin was an avid [[chess]] player. He was playing chess by around 1733, making him the first chess player known by name in the American colonies.&lt;ref name="McCraryChessandFranklin"&gt;John McCrary, [http://www.benfranklin300.org/_etc_pdf/Chess_John_McCrary.pdf ''Chess and Benjamin Franklin-His Pioneering Contributions''] ([[PDF]]).

Retrieved December 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He and a friend also used chess as a means of learning the [[Italian language]], which both were studying; the winner of each game between them had the right to assign a task, such as parts of the Italian grammar to be learned by heart, to be performed by the loser before their next meeting.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Temple Franklin]], ''Memoirs of the Life and Writings of Benjamin Franklin'', reprinted in Knight, ''Chess Pieces'', pp. 136–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin was able to play chess more frequently against stronger opposition during his many years as a civil servant and diplomat in England, where the game was far better established than in America. He was able to improve his playing standard by facing more experienced players during this period. He regularly attended [[Old Slaughter's Coffee House]] in London for chess and socializing, making many important personal contacts. While in Paris, both as a visitor and later as ambassador, he visited the famous [[Café de la Régence]], which France's strongest players made their regular meeting place. No records of his games have survived, so it is not possible to ascertain his playing strength in modern terms.&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Chess in Fifty Moves'', by Bill Price, Firefly Books (U.S.) Inc., Buffalo, New York, 2015, {{ISBN|978-1770855298}}, pp. 90–95&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin was inducted into the [[World Chess Hall of Fame|U.S. Chess Hall of Fame]] in 1999.&lt;ref name="McCraryChessandFranklin"/&gt; The Franklin Mercantile Chess Club in Philadelphia, the second oldest chess club in the U.S., is named in his honor.

==Public life==

===Early steps in Pennsylvania===
[[File:Benjamin Franklin - Join or Die.jpg|thumb|''[[Join, or Die]]'': This political cartoon by Franklin urged the colonies to join together during the [[French and Indian War]] ([[Seven Years' War]]).]]

In 1736, Franklin created the [[Union Fire Company]], one of the first [[Volunteer fire department|volunteer firefighting companies]] in America. In the same year, he printed a new currency for [[New Jersey]] based on innovative anti-[[counterfeit]]ing techniques he had devised. Throughout his career, Franklin was an advocate for [[Banknote|paper money]], publishing ''A Modest Enquiry into the Nature and Necessity of a Paper Currency'' in 1729, and his printer printed money. He was influential in the more restrained and thus successful monetary experiments in the Middle Colonies, which stopped [[deflation]] without causing excessive inflation. In 1766 he made a case for paper money to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|British House of Commons]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Kenneth Galbraith]]. (1975). ''Money: Where It Came, Whence It Went'', pp. 54–54. Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

As he matured, Franklin began to concern himself more with public affairs. In 1743, he first devised a scheme for [[The Academy and College of Philadelphia|The Academy, Charity School, and College of Philadelphia]]. However, the person he had in mind to run the academy, Rev. [[Richard Peters (priest)|Richard Peters]], refused and Franklin put his ideas away until 1749, when he printed his own pamphlet, ''Proposals Relating to the Education of Youth in Pensilvania.''&lt;ref name="MontgomeryHistory"&gt;{{cite book | title=A History of the University of Pennsylvania from Its Foundation to A.D. 1770 | publisher=George W. Jacobs &amp; Co. | author=Montgomery, Thomas Harrison | year=1900 | location=Philadelphia | lccn=00003240}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|30}} He was appointed president of the Academy on November 13, 1749; the Academy and the Charity School opened on August 13, 1751.

In 1743, Franklin founded the [[American Philosophical Society]] to help scientific men discuss their discoveries and theories. He began the electrical research that, along with other scientific inquiries, would occupy him for the rest of his life, in between bouts of politics and moneymaking.&lt;ref name="vandoren"/&gt;

In 1747, Franklin (already a very wealthy man) retired from printing and went into other businesses.&lt;ref&gt;James N. Green, "English Books and Printing in the Age of Franklin", in ''The Colonial Book in the Atlantic World'' (2002), 257.&lt;/ref&gt; He created a partnership with his foreman, [[David Hall (publisher)|David Hall]], which provided Franklin with half of the shop's profits for 18 years. This lucrative business arrangement provided leisure time for study, and in a few years he had made discoveries that gave him a reputation with educated persons throughout Europe and especially in France.

[[File:PennsylvaniaHospitalWilliamStrickland.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|[[Pennsylvania Hospital]] by [[William Strickland (architect)|William Strickland]], 1755]]

Franklin became involved in Philadelphia politics and rapidly progressed. In October 1748, he was selected as a councilman, in June 1749 he became a [[Justice of the Peace]] for Philadelphia, and in 1751 he was elected to the [[Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly|Pennsylvania Assembly]]. On August 10, 1753, Franklin was appointed deputy postmaster-general of [[British North America]], ([[Benjamin Franklin#Postmaster|see below]]). His most notable service in domestic politics was his reform of the postal system, with mail sent out every week.&lt;ref name="vandoren"/&gt;

In 1751, Franklin and [[Thomas Bond (physician)|Dr. Thomas Bond]] obtained a charter from the Pennsylvania legislature to establish a hospital. [[Pennsylvania Hospital]] was the first hospital in what was to become the United States of America.

In 1752, Franklin organized the [[Philadelphia Contributionship]], the first [[homeowner's insurance]] company in what would become the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Landers|first1=Jackson|title=In the Early 19th Century, Firefighters Fought Fires ... and Each Other|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/early-19-century-firefighters-fought-fires-each-other-180960391/|accessdate=10 December 2017|work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]|date=September 27, 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McGuire|first1=Virginia|title=What Are Those Little Shields Above the Doorways of Philadelphia Homes?|url=http://www.phillymag.com/property/2013/05/03/the-storied-fire-marks-of-philadelphia/|accessdate=10 December 2017|work=[[Philadelphia (magazine)|Philadelphia]]|publisher=[[Metrocorp]]|date=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1757 UPenn Seal.png|thumb|upright|Seal of the College of Philadelphia]]

Between 1750 and 1753, the "educational triumvirate"&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, Neil C., ''Pursuing Happiness: The Organizational Culture of the Continental Congress'', Nonagram Publications, {{ISBN|978-1480065505}}, 2013, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; of Dr. Benjamin Franklin, the American [[Samuel Johnson (American educator)|Dr. Samuel Johnson]] of [[Stratford, Connecticut]], and the immigrant Scottish schoolteacher [[William Smith (Episcopal priest)|Dr. William Smith]] built on Franklin's initial scheme and created what [[James Madison (bishop)|Bishop James Madison]], president of the [[College of William &amp; Mary]], called a "new-model"&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Horace Wemyss, ''The Life and Correspondence of the Rev. Wm. Smith, D.D.'', Philadelphia, 1880, Volume 1: pp. 566–67.&lt;/ref&gt; plan or style of American college. Franklin solicited, printed in 1752, and promoted an American textbook of [[ethics|moral philosophy]] from the American [[Samuel Johnson (American educator)|Dr. Samuel Johnson]] titled ''Elementa Philosophica''&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Johnson, ''Elementa philosophica: containing chiefly, Noetica, or things relating to the mind or understanding: and Ethica, or things relating to the moral behaviour. Philadelphia'', Printed by B. Franklin and D. Hall, at the new-printing-office, near the market, 1752&lt;/ref&gt; to be taught in the new colleges to replace courses in denominational divinity.

In June 1753, Johnson, Franklin, and Smith met in Stratford.&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, pp. 163–274&lt;/ref&gt; They decided the new-model college would focus on the professions, with classes taught in English instead of Latin, have subject matter experts as professors instead of one tutor leading a class for four years, and there would be no religious test for admission.&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson went on to found King's College (now [[Columbia University]]) in New York City in 1754, while Franklin hired Smith as Provost of the College of Philadelphia, which opened in 1755. At its first commencement, on May 17, 1757, seven men graduated; six with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] and one as [[Master of Arts]]. It was later merged with the University of the State of Pennsylvania to become the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. The College was to become influential in guiding [[:Template:Founding Documents of America|the founding documents of the United States]]: in the [[Continental Congress]], for example, over one third of the college-affiliated men who contributed the ''[[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]'' between September 4, 1774, and July 4, 1776, were affiliated with the College.&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, p. 308&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1753, both [[Harvard University|Harvard]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harvard.edu/honorary-degrees Honorary Degrees] Harvard University.

[[File:Sketch of Tun Tavern in the Revolutionary War.jpg|thumb|Sketch of the original [[Tun Tavern]]]]

In 1754, he headed the Pennsylvania delegation to the [[Albany Congress]]. This meeting of several colonies had been requested by the [[Board of Trade]] in England to improve relations with the Indians and defense against the French. Franklin proposed a broad [[Albany Plan|Plan of Union]] for the colonies. While the plan was not adopted, elements of it found their way into the [[Articles of Confederation]] and the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]].

In 1756, Franklin received an honorary [[master of arts]] degree from the [[College of William and Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=College of William and Mary |first=College of William and Mary |date=1874 |title=The History of the College of William and Mary |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VfaiLj00yFYC&amp;pg=PA48 |location=Richmond, VA |publisher=J. W. Randolph &amp; English |page=148|isbn=9781429043335 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1756, Franklin organized the Pennsylvania Militia (see "Associated Regiment of Philadelphia" under heading of Pennsylvania's 103rd Artillery and [[111th Infantry Regiment (United States)|111th Infantry Regiment]] at [[Continental Army]]). He used [[Tun Tavern]] as a gathering place to recruit a regiment of soldiers to go into battle against the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] uprisings that beset the American colonies. Reportedly Franklin was elected "Colonel" of the Associated Regiment but declined the honor.

===Decades in London===
From the mid 1750s to the mid 1770s, Franklin spent much of his time in London. Officially he was there on a political mission, but he used his time to further his scientific explorations as well, meeting many notable people.

In 1757, he was sent to England by the Pennsylvania Assembly as a colonial agent to protest against the political influence of the [[Penn family]], the [[proprietary colony|proprietors of the colony]]. He remained there for five years, striving to end the proprietors' prerogative to overturn legislation from the elected Assembly, and their exemption from paying taxes on their land. His lack of influential allies in [[Whitehall]] led to the failure of this mission.

[[File:US-Colonial (PA-115)-Pennsylvania-18 Jun 1764.jpg|thumb|left|Pennsylvania colonial currency printed by Franklin in 1764]]

At this time, many members of the Pennsylvania Assembly were feuding with [[List of colonial governors of Pennsylvania#Proprietors|William Penn's heirs]], who controlled the colony as proprietors. After his return to the colony, Franklin led the "anti-proprietary party" in the struggle against the Penn family, and was elected [[Speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives|Speaker of the Pennsylvania House]] in May 1764. His call for a change from proprietary to royal government was a rare political miscalculation, however: Pennsylvanians worried that such a move would endanger their political and religious freedoms. Because of these fears, and because of political attacks on his character, Franklin lost his seat in the October 1764 Assembly elections. The anti-proprietary party dispatched Franklin to England again to continue the struggle against the Penn family proprietorship. During this trip, events drastically changed the nature of his mission.&lt;ref name="ANB"&gt;J. A. Leo Lematy, "Franklin, Benjamin". ''[[American National Biography]] Online'', February 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

In London, Franklin opposed the [[Stamp Act 1765|1765 Stamp Act]]. Unable to prevent its passage, he made another political miscalculation and recommended a friend to the post of stamp distributor for Pennsylvania. Pennsylvanians were outraged, believing that he had supported the measure all along, and threatened to destroy his home in Philadelphia. Franklin soon learned of the extent of colonial resistance to the Stamp Act, and he testified during the House of Commons proceedings that led to its repeal.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Charles Hoffer, ''Benjamin Franklin Explains the Stamp Act Protests to Parliament, 1766'' (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Benjamin Franklin 1767.jpg|thumb|upright|Franklin in London, 1767, wearing a blue suit with elaborate gold braid and buttons, a far cry from the simple dress he affected at the [[Court (royal)|French court]] in later years. Painting by [[David Martin (artist)|David Martin]], displayed in the [[White House]].]]

With this, Franklin suddenly emerged as the leading spokesman for American interests in England. He wrote popular essays on behalf of the colonies. [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Massachusetts]] also appointed him as their agent to the Crown.&lt;ref name="ANB" /&gt;

Franklin lodged in a house in Craven Street, just off [[Strand, London|The Strand]] in [[central London]]. During his stays there, he developed a close friendship with his landlady, Margaret Stevenson, and her circle of friends and relations, in particular her daughter Mary, who was more often known as Polly. Their house, which he used on various lengthy missions from 1757 to 1775, is the only one of his residences to survive. It opened to the public as the [[Benjamin Franklin House]] museum in 2006.

Whilst in London, Franklin became involved in radical politics. He belonged to a [[gentleman's club]] (which he called "the honest Whigs"), which held stated meetings, and included members such as [[Richard Price]], the minister of [[Newington Green Unitarian Church]] who ignited the [[Revolution Controversy]], and [[Andrew Kippis]].&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Wu, ''William Hazlitt (1737-1820), the Priestley Circle, and "The Theological Repository:" A Brief Survey and Bibliography'', The Review of English Studies New Series, Vol. 56, No. 227 (Nov., 2005), pp. 758–766, at p. 762. Published by: Oxford University Press {{jstor|3661246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1756, Franklin had become a member of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures &amp; Commerce (now the [[Royal Society of Arts]] or RSA), which had been founded in 1754 and whose early meetings took place in [[English coffeehouses in the 17th and 18th centuries|Covent Garden coffee shops]]. After his return to the United States in 1775, Franklin became the Society's Corresponding Member, continuing a close connection. The RSA instituted a [[Benjamin Franklin Medal (Royal Society of Arts)|Benjamin Franklin Medal]] in 1956 to commemorate the 250th anniversary of his birth and the 200th anniversary of his membership of the RSA.

The study of [[natural philosophy]] (what we would call science) drew him into overlapping circles of acquaintance. Franklin was, for example, a corresponding member of the [[Lunar Society of Birmingham]], which included such other scientific and industrial luminaries as [[Matthew Boulton]], [[James Watt]], [[Josiah Wedgwood]] and [[Erasmus Darwin]]; on occasion he visited them.

In 1759, the [[University of St Andrews]] awarded Franklin an [[honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] in recognition of his accomplishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/inde/learn/historyculture/people-franklin-resume.htm|title=Benjamin Franklin's Resume – Independence National Historical Park (U.S. National Park Service)|website=www.nps.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also awarded an honorary doctorate by [[Oxford University]] in 1762. Because of these honors, Franklin was often addressed as "Dr. Franklin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Benjamin-Franklin|title=Benjamin Franklin – American author, scientist, and statesman|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin also managed to secure an appointed post for his illegitimate son, [[William Franklin]], by then an attorney, as [[Governor of New Jersey|Colonial Governor of New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="vandoren"/&gt;

While living in London in 1768, [[Benjamin Franklin's phonetic alphabet|he developed a phonetic alphabet]] in ''A Scheme for a new Alphabet and a Reformed Mode of Spelling''. This reformed alphabet discarded six letters Franklin regarded as redundant (c, j, q, w, x, and y), and substituted six new letters for sounds he felt lacked letters of their own. This alphabet never caught on, and he eventually lost interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omniglot.com/writing/franklin.htm ''Benjamin Franklin's Phonetic Alphabet''.] Omniglot.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Travels around Britain and Ireland===
Franklin used London as a base to travel. In 1771, he made short journeys through different parts of England, staying with [[Joseph Priestley]] at [[Leeds]], [[Thomas Percival]] at [[Manchester]] and [[Erasmus Darwin]] at [[Lichfield]].&lt;ref name="sparks"&gt;Sparks, Jared. [http://www.ushistory.org/franklin/biography/chap05.htm ''Life of Benjamin Franklin''.] US History.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Scotland, he spent five days with [[Henry Home, Lord Kames|Lord Kames]] near [[Stirling]] and stayed for three weeks with [[David Hume]] in Edinburgh. In 1759, he visited [[Edinburgh]] with his son, and recalled his conversations there as "the ''densest'' happiness of my life".&lt;ref&gt;Buchan, James. ''Crowded with Genius: The Scottish Enlightenment: Edinburgh's Moment of the Mind''. HarperCollins Publishers. 2003. p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1759, the [[University of St Andrews]] awarded him an honorary Doctor of Laws degree. From then he was known as "Doctor Franklin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gaustad|first=Edwin S|title=Benjamin Franklin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yrnUhKvBumAC&amp;pg=PA41|accessdate=May 1, 2016|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=40|isbn=978-0199709366}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October of the same year he was granted [[Freedom of the City|Freedom of the Borough]] of [[St Andrews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.katekennedyclub.org.uk/news.aspx#19 |title=The Kate Kennedy Club |publisher=The Kate Kennedy Club |accessdate=September 21, 2009|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090327111941/http://katekennedyclub.org.uk/news.aspx |archivedate= March 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He had never been to Ireland before, and met and stayed with [[Wills Hill, 1st Marquess of Downshire|Lord Hillsborough]], who he believed was especially attentive. Franklin noted of him that "all the plausible behaviour I have described is meant only, by patting and stroking the horse, to make him more patient, while the reins are drawn tighter, and the spurs set deeper into his sides."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/?id=BL1VXdTbDucC&amp;pg=PR21 |title= Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin  |editor=Nathan Haskell Dole |year=  2003|accessdate=September 21, 2009|isbn=978-0766143753}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Dublin]], Franklin was invited to sit with the members of the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] rather than in the gallery. He was the first American to receive this honor.&lt;ref name="sparks" /&gt; While touring Ireland, he was moved by the level of poverty he saw. Ireland's economy was affected by the same trade regulations and laws of Britain that governed America. Franklin feared that America could suffer the same effects should Britain's "colonial exploitation" continue.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/benfranklin/exp_worldly_ireland.html ''Benjamin Franklin''.] PBS.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visits to Europe===
Franklin spent two months in German lands in 1766, but his connections to the country stretched across a lifetime. He declared a debt of gratitude to German scientist [[Otto von Guericke]] for his early studies of electricity. Franklin also co-authored the first [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (Prussia–United States)|treaty of friendship]] between Prussia and America in 1785.

In September 1767, Franklin visited Paris with his usual traveling partner, [[John Pringle (physician)|Sir John Pringle]]. News of his electrical discoveries was widespread in France. His reputation meant that he was introduced to many influential scientists and politicians, and also to [[Louis XV of France|King Louis XV]].&lt;ref name="isaacson"&gt;Isaacson, Walter. ''Benjamin Franklin: An American Life''. Simon &amp; Schuster. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defending the American cause===
One line of argument in Parliament was that Americans should pay a share of the costs of the [[French and Indian War]], and that therefore taxes should be levied on them. Franklin became the American spokesman in highly publicized testimony in Parliament in 1766. He stated that Americans already contributed heavily to the defense of the Empire. He said local governments had raised, outfitted and paid 25,000 soldiers to fight France—as many as Britain itself sent—and spent many millions from American treasuries doing so in the [[French and Indian War]] alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=James A.

In 1773, Franklin published two of his most celebrated pro-American satirical essays: [[s:Rules By Which A Great Empire May Be Reduced To A Small One|"Rules by Which a Great Empire May Be Reduced to a Small One"]], and "An Edict by the King of Prussia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.historycarper.com/resources/twobf3/pa-1773.htm| title=reprinted on The History Carper| last=Franklin| first=Benjamin| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060103051246/http://www.historycarper.com/resources/twobf3/pa-1773.htm| archivedate=January 3, 2006| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hutchinson letters leak===
{{main|Hutchinson Letters Affair}}
In 1772, Franklin obtained private letters of [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]] and [[Andrew Oliver]], governor and lieutenant governor of the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]], proving that they had encouraged the Crown to crack down on Bostonians. Franklin sent them to America, where they escalated the tensions. The letters were finally [[News leak|leaked]] to the public in the ''[[Boston Gazette]]'' in mid-June 1773,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bailyn|first=Bernard|title=The Ordeal of Thomas Hutchinson|location=Cambridge, MA|year=1974|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0674641600|oclc=6825524}}, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; causing a political firestorm in Massachusetts and raising significant questions in England.&lt;ref name=Penegar29&gt;{{cite book|last=Penegar|first=Kenneth|title=The Political Trial of Benjamin Franklin|publisher=Algora Publishing|year=2011|isbn=978-0875868493|location=New York|oclc=696296728}}, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; The British began to regard him as the fomenter of serious trouble. Hopes for a peaceful solution ended as he was systematically ridiculed and humiliated by [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor-General]] [[Alexander Wedderburn, 1st Earl of Rosslyn|Alexander Wedderburn]], before the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] on January 29, 1774. He returned to Philadelphia in March 1775, and abandoned his accommodationist stance.&lt;ref&gt;Sheila L. Skemp, ''The Making of a Patriot: Benjamin Franklin at the Cockpit'' (Oxford University Press; 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coming of revolution===
In 1763, soon after Franklin returned to Pennsylvania from England for the first time, the western frontier was engulfed in a bitter war known as [[Pontiac's Rebellion]]. The [[Paxton Boys]], a group of settlers convinced that the Pennsylvania government was not doing enough to protect them from [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] raids, murdered a group of peaceful [[Susquehannock]] Indians and marched on Philadelphia. Franklin helped to organize a local [[militia]] to defend the capital against the mob. He met with the Paxton leaders and persuaded them to disperse. Franklin wrote a scathing attack against the [[racism|racial prejudice]] of the Paxton Boys. "If an ''Indian'' injures me", he asked, "does it follow that I may revenge that Injury on all ''Indians''?"&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, Benjamin. [http://www.historycarper.com/resources/twobf3/massacre.htm "A Narrative of the Late Massacres&amp;nbsp;..."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427070508/http://www.historycarper.com/resources/twobf3/massacre.htm |date=April 27, 2006 }} reprinted on The History Carper.&lt;/ref&gt;

He provided an early response to British surveillance through his own network of [[Surveillance art|counter-surveillance and manipulation]]. "He waged a public relations campaign, secured secret aid, played a role in privateering expeditions, and churned out effective and inflammatory propaganda."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Crews| first= Ed| title= Spies and Scouts, Secret Writing, and Sympathetic Citizens| journal= Colonial Williamsburg Journal| url=http://www.history.org/foundation/journal/Summer04/spies.cfm| date= Summer 2004| accessdate=April 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time Franklin arrived in Philadelphia on May 5, 1775, after his second mission to Great Britain, the [[American Revolution]] had begun—with fighting between colonials and British at [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Lexington and Concord]]. The New England militia had trapped the main British army in Boston. The Pennsylvania Assembly unanimously chose Franklin as their delegate to the [[Second Continental Congress]]. In June 1776, he was appointed a member of the [[Committee of Five]] that drafted the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. Although he was temporarily disabled by [[gout]] and unable to attend most meetings of the Committee, Franklin made several "small but important"&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, pp. 311–12&lt;/ref&gt; changes to the draft sent to him by [[Thomas Jefferson]].

At the signing, he is quoted as having replied to a comment by [[John Hancock]] that they must all hang together: "Yes, we must, indeed, all hang together, or most assuredly we shall all hang separately."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

===Postmaster===
&lt;!--The 'Franklin on US Postage' section links to this section/image file. --&gt;
[[File:Franklin SC1 1847.jpg|thumb|upright|First issue of Benjamin Franklin on US [[Benjamin Franklin#Franklin on U.S. Postage|postage stamp]], issue of 1847]]

Well known as a printer and publisher, Franklin was appointed postmaster of Philadelphia in 1737, holding the office until 1753, when he and publisher [[William Hunter (publisher)|William Hunter]] were named deputy postmasters–general of British North America, the first to hold the office. ([[Postmaster General of the United Kingdom#Two Postmasters General|Joint appointments]] were standard at the time, for political reasons.) Franklin was responsible for the British colonies from Pennsylvania north and east, as far as the [[Newfoundland (island)|island of Newfoundland]]. A post office for local and outgoing mail had been established in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]], by local stationer Benjamin Leigh, on April 23, 1754, but service was irregular. Franklin opened the first post office to offer regular, monthly mail in what would later become Canada, at Halifax, on December 9, 1755. Meantime, Hunter became postal administrator in [[Colonial Williamsburg|Williamsburg]], [[Virginia]] and oversaw areas south of [[Annapolis]], [[Maryland]]. Franklin reorganized the service's accounting system, then improved speed of delivery between Philadelphia, New York and Boston. By 1761, efficiencies led to the first profits for the colonial post office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historymuseum.ca/cmc/exhibitions/cpm/chrono/ch1753ae.shtml "1753 Benjamin Franklin"], Stéphanie Ouellet, in A Chronology of Canadian Postal History, National Museum of History, Ottawa.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the lands of [[New France]] were ceded to the British under the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763, the new British [[Province of Quebec (1763–91)|province of Quebec]] was created among them, and Franklin saw mail service expanded between [[Montreal]], [[Trois-Rivières]], [[Quebec City]], and New York. For the greater part of his appointment, Franklin lived in England (from 1757 to 1762, and again from 1764 to 1774)—about three-quarters of his term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historymuseum.ca/cmc/exhibitions/cpm/chrono/chs1760e.shtml#yr-1774 "1760–1840 Planting the Imperial Postal System in British North America"], A Chronology of Canadian Postal History, National Museum of History, Ottawa.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, his sympathies for the rebel cause in the American Revolution led to his dismissal on January 31, 1774.

On July 26, 1775, the [[Second Continental Congress]] established the [[United States Postal Service|United States Post Office]] and named Benjamin Franklin as the first [[United States Postmaster General]]. Franklin had been a postmaster for decades and was a natural choice for the position.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Isaacson. ''Benjamin Franklin: an American life'', pp. 206–09, 301&lt;/ref&gt; He had just returned from England and was appointed chairman of a Committee of Investigation to establish a postal system. The report of the Committee, providing for the appointment of a postmaster general for the 13 American colonies, was considered by the Continental Congress on July 25 and 26. On July 26, 1775, Franklin was appointed Postmaster General, the first appointed under the Continental Congress. It established a postal system that became the United States Post Office, a system that continues to operate today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blmailus1.htm#CONGRESS |title=History of the United States Postal Systems |publisher=Inventors.about.com |accessdate=June 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Friedrich Christoph Schlosser]] remarked at the time, with ample hyperbole, that "Such was the number of portraits, busts and medallions of him in circulation before he left Paris, that he would have been recognized from them by any adult citizen in any part of the civilized world."&amp;nbsp;– {{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Franklin, Benjamin}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In December 1776, Franklin was dispatched to France as [[commissioner]] for the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdl.library.upenn.edu/1017/d/ead/upenn_rbml_MsColl900 Benjamin Franklin papers], [http://www.library.upenn.edu/kislak/ Kislak Center for Special Collections], Rare Books and Manuscripts, University of Pennsylvania&lt;/ref&gt; He took with him as secretary his 16-year-old grandson, [[William Temple Franklin]]. They lived in a home in the Parisian suburb of [[Passy]], donated by [[Jacques-Donatien Le Ray de Chaumont]], who supported the United States. Franklin remained in France until 1785. He conducted the affairs of his country toward the French nation with great success, which included securing a critical military alliance in 1778 and negotiating the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]].

Among his associates in France was [[Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau]]—a French Revolutionary writer, orator and statesman who in early 1791 would be elected president of the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.isthisjefferson.org/DLP_D04.html?zoom_highlight=Franklin The Book in the Painting: De la Caisse d'Escompte]." [http://www.isthisjefferson.org/DLP_D04.html?zoom_highlight=Franklin isthisjefferson.org] Accessed February 1, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1784, Franklin met with Mirabeau and contributed anonymous materials that the Frenchman used in his first signed work: ''Considerations sur l'ordre de Cincinnatus''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/cihm_39568#page/n3/mode/2up  ''Considerations sur l'ordre de Cincinnatus''], December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The publication was critical of the [[Society of the Cincinnati]], established in the United States. Franklin and Mirabeau thought of it as a "noble order", inconsistent with the [[egalitarian]] ideals of the new republic.&lt;ref&gt;Van Doren, Carl. ''Benjamin Franklin'' (The Viking Press: New York). 1938. pp. 709–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his stay in France, Benjamin Franklin was active as a [[freemasonry|Freemason]], serving as Venerable Master of the Lodge [[Les Neuf Sœurs]] from 1779 until 1781. He was the 106th member of the Lodge. In 1784, when [[Franz Mesmer]] began to publicize his theory of "[[animal magnetism]]" which was considered offensive by many, [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] appointed a commission to investigate it. These included the chemist [[Antoine Lavoisier]], the physician [[Joseph-Ignace Guillotin]], the astronomer [[Jean Sylvain Bailly]], and Benjamin Franklin.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Stephan A.

[[File:Libertas Americana silver medallion 1783.jpg|thumb|While in France Franklin designed and commissioned [[Augustin Dupré]] to engrave the medallion ''"Libertas Americana"'' minted in Paris in 1783.]]

Franklin's advocacy for religious tolerance in France contributed to arguments made by French philosophers and politicians that resulted in [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]]'s signing of the [[Edict of Versailles]] in November 1787. This edict effectively nullified the [[Edict of Fontainebleau]], which had denied non-Catholics civil status and the right to openly practice their faith.&lt;ref&gt;[http://booking-help.org/book_338_glava_314_Edict_of_Versailles_%281787%29.html "Edict of Versailles (1787)"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714094231/http://booking-help.org/book_338_glava_314_Edict_of_Versailles_(1787).html |date=July 14, 2012 }}, ''Encyclopedia of the Age of Political Ideals'', downloaded January 29, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin also served as American minister to Sweden, although he never visited that country.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} He negotiated a [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (United States–Sweden)|treaty]] that was signed in April 1783. On August 27, 1783, in Paris, Franklin witnessed the world's first hydrogen [[balloon (aircraft)|balloon]] flight.&lt;ref name="EcceF"&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/?id=5_7IRHZGyzMC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=%22jacques+charles%22+%22Eccentric+France%22&amp;q=%22jacques%20charles%22%20%22Eccentric%20France%22 |title=Eccentric France: Bradt Guide to mad, magical and marvellous France| author=Piers Letcher&amp;nbsp;– Jacques Charles |year= 2003|accessdate=March 17, 2010| isbn=978-1841620688}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Robert brothers#First hydrogen balloon|Le Globe]]'', created by professor [[Jacques Charles]] and [[Robert brothers|Les Frères Robert]], was watched by a vast crowd as it rose from the [[Champ de Mars]] (now the site of the [[Eiffel Tower]]).&lt;ref name="Sci&amp;Soc"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.scienceandsociety.co.uk/results.asp?image=10447673 |title=Science and Society, Medal commemorating Charles and Robert's balloon ascent, Paris, 1783 |publisher=Scienceandsociety.co.uk |accessdate=March 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin became so enthusiastic that he subscribed financially to the next project to build a manned hydrogen balloon.&lt;ref name="Fid Green"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.fiddlersgreen.net/models/Aircraft/Balloon-Charles.html |title=Fiddlers Green, History of Ballooning, Jacques Charles |publisher=Fiddlersgreen.net |accessdate=June 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 1, 1783, Franklin was seated in the special enclosure for honoured guests when ''[[Robert brothers#First manned hydrogen balloon flight|La Charlière]]'' took off from the [[Jardin des Tuileries]], piloted by Jacques Charles and [[Robert brothers|Nicolas-Louis Robert]].&lt;ref name="EcceF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FAI"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fai.org/ballooning/newsletter/pr00-02.htm |title=Federation Aeronautique Internationale, Ballooning Commission, Hall of Fame, Robert Brothers |publisher=Fai.org |accessdate=March 17, 2010| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080516222023/http://www.fai.org/ballooning/newsletter/pr00-02.htm |archivedate=May 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constitutional Convention===
[[File:Franklin's return to Philadelphia 1785 cph.3g09906.jpg|thumb|''Franklin's return to Philadelphia, 1785'', by [[Jean Leon Gerome Ferris]]]]

When he returned home in 1785, Franklin occupied a position only second to that of [[George Washington]] as the champion of American independence. Le Ray honored him with a commissioned portrait painted by [[Joseph Duplessis]], which now hangs in the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in Washington, D.C. After his return, Franklin became an [[abolitionism|abolitionist]] and freed his two slaves. He eventually became president of the [[Pennsylvania Abolition Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/benfranklin/l3_citizen_abolitionist.html ''Citizen Ben, Abolitionist''], PBS&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1787, Franklin served as a delegate to the [[Philadelphia Convention]]. He held an honorary position and seldom engaged in debate. He is the only Founding Father who is a signatory of all four of the major documents of the founding of the United States: the Declaration of Independence, the [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|Treaty of Alliance]] with France, the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] and the [[United States Constitution]].

In 1787, a group of prominent ministers in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]], proposed the foundation of a new college named in Franklin's honor. Franklin donated £200 towards the development of Franklin College (now called [[Franklin &amp; Marshall College]]).

Between 1771 and 1788, he finished his [[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin|autobiography]]. While it was at first addressed to his son, it was later completed for the benefit of mankind at the request of a friend.

Franklin strongly supported the right to [[freedom of speech]]:

{{quote|In those wretched countries where a man cannot call his tongue his own, he can scarce call anything his own. Whoever would overthrow the liberty of a nation must begin by subduing the freeness of speech&amp;nbsp;...

Without freedom of thought there can be no such thing as wisdom, and no such thing as public liberty without freedom of speech, which is the right of every man&amp;nbsp;...|[[Silence Dogood]] no. 8, 1722&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Coffman |editor1-first=Steve |title=Words of the Founding Fathers: Selected Quotations of Franklin, Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison and Hamilton, with Sources |year=2012 |publisher=McFarland |location=Jefferson, N.C. |isbn=978-0786458622| page=97| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PsFnB7FA11YC&amp;pg=PA97#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===President of Pennsylvania===
[[File:FRANKLIN, Benjamin (signed check).jpg|thumb|Franklin autograph check signed during his Presidency of Pennsylvania]]

Special balloting conducted October 18, 1785, unanimously elected Franklin the sixth [[Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania#Presidents of Council|president]] of the [[Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania|Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania]], replacing [[John Dickinson (Pennsylvania and Delaware)|John Dickinson]]. The office was practically that of [[List of Governors of Pennsylvania|governor]]. Franklin held that office for slightly over three years, longer than any other, and served the constitutional limit of three full terms. Shortly after his initial election he was reelected to a full term on October 29, 1785, and again in the fall of 1786 and on October 31, 1787. In that capacity he served as host to the Constitutional Convention of 1787 in Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;Brands, ''The First American'', pp. 654–55, 694&lt;/ref&gt;

==Virtue, religion, and personal beliefs==
[[File:Benjamin Franklin (1706–1790) MET DT2883.jpg|thumb|upright|A bust of Franklin by [[Jean-Antoine Houdon]]]]

Like the other advocates of [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]], Franklin emphasized that the new republic could survive only if the people were virtuous. All his life he explored the role of civic and personal virtue, as expressed in ''Poor Richard's'' [[aphorism]]s. Franklin felt that organized religion was necessary to keep men good to their fellow men, but rarely attended religious services himself.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, ''Autobiography'', ed. Lemay, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; When Franklin met [[Voltaire]] in Paris and asked his fellow member of the Enlightenment vanguard to bless his grandson, Voltaire said in English, "God and Liberty", and added, "this is the only appropriate benediction for the grandson of Monsieur Franklin."&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, 2003, p. 354&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pedro Américo - Voltaire abençoando o neto de Franklin em nome de Deus e da Liberdade.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|''Voltaire blessing Franklin's grandson, in the name of God and Liberty'', by [[Pedro Américo]]]]

Franklin's parents were both pious [[Puritan]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, 2003, pp.&amp;nbsp;5–18&lt;/ref&gt; The family attended the [[Old South Church]], the most liberal Puritan congregation in Boston, where Benjamin Franklin was baptized in 1706.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Old South Church |url=http://www.oldsouth.org/history.html |title=Isaacson, 2003, p. 15 |publisher=Oldsouth.org |accessdate=September 21, 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080531090015/http://www.oldsouth.org/history.html |archivedate = May 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin's father, a poor [[chandlery|chandler]], owned a copy of a book, ''Bonifacius: Essays to Do Good'', by the Puritan preacher and family friend [[Cotton Mather]], which Franklin often cited as a key influence on his life.&lt;ref&gt;"If I have been", Franklin wrote to Cotton Mather's son seventy years later, "a useful citizen, the public owes the advantage of it to that book." in Isaacson, 2003, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin's first pen name, Silence Dogood, paid homage both to the book and to a widely known sermon by Mather. The book preached the importance of forming voluntary associations to benefit society. Franklin learned about forming do-good associations from Cotton Mather, but his organizational skills made him the most influential force in making voluntarism an enduring part of the American ethos.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, 2003, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin formulated a presentation of his beliefs and published it in 1728.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Franklin| first = Benjamin| title = Articles of Belief and Acts of Religion| work = Benjamin Franklin Papers| publisher = franklinpapers.org| date = November 20, 1728| url = http://franklinpapers.org/franklin/yale;jsessionid=9379F5D050E36AA9D1F95700EE223865?d=-363718316&amp;d=1379669530&amp;vol=1&amp;page=101a| accessdate = December 24, 2010| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110726104638/http://franklinpapers.org/franklin/yale;jsessionid=9379F5D050E36AA9D1F95700EE223865?d=-363718316&amp;d=1379669530&amp;vol=1&amp;page=101a| archive-date = July 26, 2011| dead-url = yes| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It did not mention many of the Puritan ideas regarding salvation, the [[divinity of Jesus]], or indeed much religious dogma.

[[File:Benjamin Franklin by Hiram Powers.jpg|thumb|Benjamin Franklin by Hiram Powers]]
It was Ben Franklin who, at a critical impasse during the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]] in June 1787, attempted to introduce the practice of daily common prayer with these words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;In the beginning of the contest with G. Britain, when we were sensible of danger we had daily prayer in this room for the Divine Protection. Our prayers, Sir, were heard, and they were graciously answered. All of us who were engaged in the struggle must have observed frequent instances of a Superintending providence in our favor.&amp;nbsp;... And have we now forgotten that powerful friend? or do we imagine that we no longer need His assistance. I have lived, Sir, a long time and the longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth—that God governs in the affairs of men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without his aid? We have been assured, Sir, in the sacred writings that "except the Lord build they labor in vain that build it." I firmly believe this; and I also believe that without his concurring aid we shall succeed in this political building no better than the Builders of Babel:&amp;nbsp;... I therefore beg leave to move—that henceforth prayers imploring the assistance of Heaven, and its blessings on our deliberations, be held in this Assembly every morning before we proceed to business, and that one or more of the Clergy of this City be requested to officiate in that service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Michael E.

The motion met with resistance and was never brought to a vote.&lt;ref&gt;[[Clinton Rossiter|Rossiter, Clinton]]. 1787. ''The Grand Convention'' (1966), pp. 184–85&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin was an enthusiastic supporter of the evangelical minister [[George Whitefield]] during the [[First Great Awakening]]. Franklin did not subscribe to Whitefield's theology, but he admired Whitefield for exhorting people to worship God through good works. Franklin published all of Whitefield's sermons and journals, thereby earning a lot of money and boosting the Great Awakening.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, 2003, pp. 107–13&lt;/ref&gt;

When he stopped attending church, Franklin wrote in his autobiography:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;Sunday being my studying day, I never was without some religious principles. I never doubted, for instance, the existence of the Deity; that He made the world, and governed it by His providence; that the most acceptable service of God was the doing good to man; that our souls are immortal; and that all crime will be punished, and virtue rewarded, either here or hereafter.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Franklin Benjamin [http://www.ushistory.org/franklin/autobiography/singlehtml.htm "Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905094326/http://ushistory.org/franklin/autobiography/singlehtml.htm |date=September 5, 2008 }} Section 2 reprinted on UShistory.org.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.hanover.edu/courses/excerpts/111frank2.html |title=Benjamin Franklin |publisher=History.hanover.edu |accessdate=September 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Franklin retained a lifelong commitment to the Puritan virtues and political values he had grown up with, and through his civic work and publishing, he succeeded in passing these values into the American culture permanently. He had a "passion for virtue".&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, p. 485&lt;/ref&gt; These Puritan values included his devotion to egalitarianism, education, industry, thrift, honesty, temperance, charity and community spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, 2003, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

The classical authors read in the Enlightenment period taught an abstract [[Republicanism in the United States|ideal of republican government]] based on hierarchical social orders of king, aristocracy and commoners. It was widely believed that English liberties relied on their balance of power, but also hierarchal deference to the privileged class.&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, 1992, pp. 273–74, 299–300&lt;/ref&gt; "Puritanism&amp;nbsp;... and the epidemic evangelism of the mid-eighteenth century, had created challenges to the traditional notions of social stratification"&lt;ref name="Bailyn303" /&gt; by preaching that the Bible taught all men are equal, that the true value of a man lies in his moral behavior, not his class, and that all men can be saved.&lt;ref name="Bailyn303"&gt;Bailyn, 1992, p. 303&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin, steeped in Puritanism and an enthusiastic supporter of the evangelical movement, rejected the salvation dogma, but embraced the radical notion of egalitarian democracy.

Franklin's commitment to teach these values was itself something he gained from his Puritan upbringing, with its stress on "inculcating virtue and character in themselves and their communities."&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, 2003, pp. 10, 102, 489&lt;/ref&gt; These Puritan values and the desire to pass them on, were one of Franklin's quintessentially American characteristics, and helped shape the character of the nation. Franklin's writings on [[virtue]] were derided by some European authors, such as Jackob Fugger in his critical work ''Portrait of American Culture''. [[Max Weber]] considered Franklin's ethical writings a culmination of the [[Protestant work ethic|Protestant ethic]], which ethic created the social conditions necessary for the birth of [[capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Max ''The Protestant Ethic and the "Spirit of Capitalism"'', (Penguin Books, 2002), translated by Peter Baehr and Gordon C. Wells, pp. 9–11&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Franklin's notable characteristics was his respect, tolerance and promotion of all churches. Referring to his experience in Philadelphia, he wrote in [[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin|his autobiography]], "new Places of worship were continually wanted, and generally erected by voluntary Contribution, my Mite for such purpose, whatever might be the Sect, was never refused."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; "He helped create a new type of nation that would draw strength from its religious pluralism."&lt;ref name="Isaacson 2003 p 93ff"&gt;Isaacson,2003 pp. 93ff&lt;/ref&gt; The evangelical revivalists who were active mid-century, such as Franklin's friend and preacher, George Whitefield, were the greatest advocates of religious freedom, "claiming liberty of conscience to be an 'inalienable right of every rational creature.'"&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, 1992, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; Whitefield's supporters in Philadelphia, including Franklin, erected "a large, new hall, that&amp;nbsp;... could provide a pulpit to anyone of any belief."&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, 2003, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin's rejection of dogma and doctrine and his stress on the God of ethics and morality and [[civic virtue]] made him the "prophet of tolerance."&lt;ref name="Isaacson 2003 p 93ff"/&gt; Franklin composed "A Parable Against Persecution", an apocryphal 51st chapter of Genesis in which God teaches Abraham the duty of tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mOEjB0Pdq8oC&amp;pg=PA109|title=The Political Thought of Benjamin Franklin|isbn=978-0872206830|last1=Franklin|first1=Benjamin|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he was living in London in 1774, he was present at the birth of [[General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches|British Unitarianism]], attending the inaugural session of the [[Essex Street Chapel]], at which [[Theophilus Lindsey]] drew together the first avowedly [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] congregation in England; this was somewhat politically risky, and pushed religious tolerance to new boundaries, as a denial of the doctrine of the [[Trinity]] was illegal until [[Doctrine of the Trinity Act 1813|the 1813 Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unitarian.org.uk/support/doc-EssexHall1.shtml |title=Chapter 2, ''The History of Essex Hall'' by Mortimer Rowe B.A., D.D.

Although Franklin's parents had intended for him to have a career in the Church,&lt;ref name="autobio" /&gt; Franklin as a young man adopted the Enlightenment religious belief in [[deism]], that God's truths can be found entirely through nature and reason.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, 2003, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; "I soon became a thorough Deist."&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, Benjamin.

After the disillusioning experience of seeing the decay in his own moral standards, and those of two friends in London whom he had converted to Deism, Franklin turned back to a belief in the importance of organized religion, on the pragmatic grounds that without God and organized churches, man will not be good.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, 2003, pp. 46, 486&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, because of his proposal that [[Christian prayer|prayers]] be said in the [[Constitutional Convention of 1787]], many have contended that in his later life Franklin became a [[piety|pious]] Christian.&lt;ref name="Pious"&gt;{{cite book| author=Henry Louis Mencken, George Jean Nathan| url=https://books.google.com/?id=LqJUonES6m8C&amp;q=benjamin+franklin+identify+christian+religion&amp;dq=benjamin+franklin+identify+christian+religion| title=The American Mercury, Volume 8| publisher=Garber Communications| quote=It is well known that in his youth Benjamin Franklin was a thorough-going Deist, but because he proposed that prayers be said in the Constitution Convention of 1787 many have contended that in later life he became a pious Christian.| date=October 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Faith"&gt;{{cite book| author=Ralph Frasca| url=https://books.google.com/?id=CY2UVzcU5l0C&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=benjamin+franklin+christian+or+deist#v=onepage| title=Benjamin Franklin's Printing Network: Disseminating Virtue in Early America| publisher=[[University of Missouri Press]]| quote=Despite being raised a Puritan of the Congregationalist stripe by his parents, who "brought me through my Childhood piously in the Dissenting Way", Franklin recalled, he abandoned that denomination, briefly embraced deism, and finally became a non-denominational Protestant Christian. |year= 2009| isbn=978-0826264923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to David Morgan,&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, David T. "Benjamin Franklin: Champion of Generic Religion". ''The Historian''. 62#4 2000. pp. 722+&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin was a proponent of religion in general. He prayed to "Powerful Goodness" and referred to God as "the infinite". [[John Adams]] noted that Franklin was a mirror in which people saw their own religion: "The [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] thought him almost a Catholic. The [[Church of England]] claimed him as one of them. The [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]] thought him half a Presbyterian, and the [[Quakers|Friends]] believed him a wet Quaker." Whatever else Franklin was, concludes Morgan, "he was a true champion of generic religion." In a letter to Richard Price, Franklin stated that he believed that religion should support itself without help from the government, claiming, "When a Religion is good, I conceive that it will support itself; and, when it cannot support itself, and God does not take care to support, so that its Professors are oblig'd to call for the help of the Civil Power, it is a sign, I apprehend, of its being a bad one."&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Franklin to Richard Price, October 9, 1780 ''Writings'' 8:153–54&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1790, just about a month before he died, Franklin wrote a letter to [[Ezra Stiles]], president of [[Yale University]], who had asked him his views on religion:

{{quote|As to [[Jesus of Nazareth]], my Opinion of whom you particularly desire, I think the System of Morals and his Religion, as he left them to us, the best the world ever saw or is likely to see; but I apprehend it has received various corrupt changes, and I have, with most of the present [[English Dissenters|Dissenters in England]], some Doubts as to his divinity; tho' it is a question I do not dogmatize upon, having never studied it, and I think it needless to busy myself with it now, when I expect soon an Opportunity of knowing the Truth with less Trouble. I see no harm, however, in its being believed, if that belief has the good consequence, as it probably has, of making his doctrines more respected and better observed; especially as I do not perceive that the Supreme takes it amiss, by distinguishing the unbelievers in his government of the world with any particular marks of his displeasure.&lt;ref name="vandoren"/&gt;}}

On July 4, 1776, Congress appointed a three-member committee composed of Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and John Adams to design the [[Great Seal of the United States]]. Franklin's proposal (which was not adopted) featured the motto: "Rebellion to Tyrants is Obedience to God" and a scene from the [[Book of Exodus]], with [[Moses]], the [[Israelites]], the [[Pillar of Fire (theophany)|pillar of fire]], and [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] depicted as [[Pharaohs in the Bible#Pharaoh of the Exodus|pharaoh]]. The design that was produced was never acted upon by Congress, and the Great Seal's design was not finalized until a third committee was appointed in 1782.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/27807.pdf The Great Seal of the United States]" (July 2003).

[[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] ([[Oxford University Press]], 2006), pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thirteen Virtues===
[[File:Franklin bust at Columbia University IMG 0924.JPG|thumb|Franklin bust in the [[Archives]] Department of [[Columbia University]] in New York City]]

Franklin sought to cultivate his character by a plan of 13 virtues, which he developed at age 20 (in 1726) and continued to practice in some form for the rest of his life. His [[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin|autobiography]] lists his 13 virtues as:

# "[[Temperance (virtue)|Temperance]]. Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation."
# "[[Silence]]. Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself; avoid trifling conversation."
# "[[Order (virtue)|Order]]. Let all your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time."
# "Resolution. Resolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what you resolve."
# "[[Frugality]]. Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself; i.e., waste nothing."
# "[[Industry]]. Lose no time; be always employ'd in something useful; cut off all unnecessary actions."
# "[[Sincerity]]. Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly, and, if you speak, speak accordingly."
# "[[Justice]]. Wrong none by doing injuries, or omitting the benefits that are your duty."
# "[[Moderation]]. Avoid extremes; forbear resenting injuries so much as you think they deserve."
# "[[Cleanliness]]. Tolerate no uncleanliness in body, clothes, or habitation."
# "[[Tranquility]]. Be not disturbed at trifles, or at accidents common or unavoidable."
# "[[Chastity]]. Rarely use [[Human sexuality|venery]] but for health or offspring, never to dullness, weakness, or the injury of your own or another's peace or reputation."
# "[[Humility]]. Imitate Jesus and [[Socrates]]."

Franklin did not try to work on them all at once. Instead, he would work on one and only one each week "leaving all others to their ordinary chance." While Franklin did not live completely by his virtues, and by his own admission he fell short of them many times, he believed the attempt made him a better man contributing greatly to his success and happiness, which is why in his autobiography, he devoted more pages to this plan than to any other single point; in his autobiography Franklin wrote, "I hope, therefore, that some of my descendants may follow the example and reap the benefit."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushistory.org/franklin/autobiography/page38.htm ''Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin page 38 forward''] by Benjamin Franklin&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slavery==
Franklin owned as many as seven slaves, two males who worked in his household and his shop. Franklin posted paid ads for the sale of slaves and for the capture of runaway slaves and allowed the sale of slaves in his general store. Franklin profited from both the international and domestic slave trade, even criticizing slaves who had run off to join the [[British Army]] during the colonial wars of the 1740s and 1750s. Franklin, however, later became a "cautious abolitionist" and became an outspoken critic of landed gentry slavery. In 1758, Franklin advocated the opening of a school for the education of black slaves in Philadelphia. Franklin took two slaves to England with him, Peter and King, and King left his service there in 1756: by 1758 he was working for "a lady in Suffolk".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Benjamin Franklin: An American Life|last = Isaacson|first = Walter|publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster|year = 2003|isbn = |location = New York|chapter = Chapter Eight}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether Franklin could have compelled King's return is open to doubt in the light of earlier English [[Common Law]] decisions and [[Slavery at common law#Shanley v Harvey|the subsequent case of Shanley v Harvey]], but in fact he did not do so.

After returning from England in 1762, Franklin became more anti-slavery. By 1770, Franklin had freed his slaves and attacked the system of slavery and the [[international slave trade]]. Franklin, however, refused to publicly debate the issue of slavery at the [[1787 Constitutional Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;Waldstreicher, David. "Benjamin Franklin, Slavery, and the Founders: On the dangers of reading backwards." Common-place.org. 04, no. 4 (July 2004). http://common-place.org/book/benjamin-franklin-slavery-and-the-founders-on-the-dangers-of-reading-backwards/&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin tended to take both sides of the issue of slavery, never fully divesting himself from the institution.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffer (2011), pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Waldstreicher (2004), pp. xii, xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

In his later years, as Congress was forced to deal with the issue of slavery, Franklin wrote several essays that stressed the importance of the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition of slavery]] and of the integration of blacks into American society. These writings included:

* ''[[s:An Address to the Public|An Address to the Public]]'' (1789)
* ''[[s:A Plan for Improving the Condition of the Free Blacks|A Plan for Improving the Condition of the Free Blacks]]'' (1789)
* ''Sidi Mehemet Ibrahim on the Slave Trade'' (1790)&lt;ref&gt;Myra Jehlen, Michael Warner, editors, ''The English Literatures of America, 1500–1800'', Psychology Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LAYDAZmrKkgC&amp;pg=PA891 p. 891] 1997, {{ISBN|0415919037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1790, [[Quakers]] from New York and Pennsylvania presented their petition for abolition to Congress. Their argument against slavery was backed by the [[Pennsylvania Abolitionist Society]] and its president, Benjamin Franklin.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Franklin for The Pennsylvania Abolition Society to the United States Congress, ''The memorial of the Pennsylvania Society for promoting the Abolition of Slavery, the relief of free Negroes unlawfully held in bondage, and the Improvement of the Conditions of the African Race'' (February 3, 1790)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[File:Philly 2010 transit 071.JPG|thumb|The grave of Benjamin Franklin, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]

Franklin suffered from obesity throughout his middle-aged and later years, which resulted in multiple health problems, particularly [[gout]], which worsened as he aged. In poor health during the signing of the US Constitution in 1787, he was rarely seen in public from then until his death.

Benjamin Franklin died from [[Pleurisy|pleuritic attack]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Isaacson| first=Walter| title=Benjamin Franklin: an American life| year=2003| publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster| location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- nothing is mentioned about pleurisy in the Timeline:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.benfranklin300.org/etc_timeline_1.htm|title=Franklin &amp; Marshall College – ''Ben Franklin: A Timeline''|publisher=|accessdate=October 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; at his home in Philadelphia on April 17, 1790, at age 84. His death is described in the book ''The Life of Benjamin Franklin'', quoting from the account of Dr. John Jones:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;when the pain and difficulty of breathing entirely left him, and his family were flattering themselves with the hopes of his recovery, when an imposthume, which had formed itself in his lungs, suddenly burst, and discharged a quantity of matter, which he continued to throw up while he had power; but, as that failed, the organs of respiration became gradually oppressed; a calm, lethargic state succeeded; and on the 17th instant (April 1790), about eleven o'clock at night, he quietly expired, closing a long and useful life of eighty-four years and three months.&lt;ref&gt;Sparks, pp. 529–30.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Approximately 20,000 people attended his funeral. He was interred in [[Christ Church Burial Ground]] in Philadelphia. In 1728, aged 22, Franklin wrote what he hoped would be his own epitaph:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Body of B. Franklin Printer; Like the Cover of an old Book, Its Contents torn out, And stript of its Lettering and Gilding, Lies here, Food for Worms. But the Work shall not be wholly lost: For it will, as he believ'd, appear once more, In a new &amp; more perfect Edition, Corrected and Amended By the Author.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/treasures/franklin-epitaph.html ''Benjamin Franklin: In His Own Words''.] Library of Congress.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Franklin's actual grave, however, as he specified in his final will, simply reads "Benjamin and Deborah Franklin".&lt;ref&gt;[http://sln.fi.edu/franklin/family/lastwill.html ''The Last Will and Testament of Benjamin Franklin''.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821230120/http://sln.fi.edu/franklin/family/lastwill.html |date=August 21, 2009 }} The Franklin Institute Science Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Benjamin Franklin National Memorial.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Marble memorial statue, [[Benjamin Franklin National Memorial]]]]A signer of both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, Franklin is considered one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]]. His pervasive influence in the early history of the nation has led to his being jocularly called "the only President of the United States who was never President of the United States."&lt;ref&gt;[[Everything You Know Is Wrong|Firesign Theater quote, meant humorously but poignantly.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin's likeness is ubiquitous. Since 1928, it has adorned American [[United States one hundred-dollar bill|$100 bills]], which are sometimes referred to in slang as "Benjamins" or "Franklins." From 1948 to 1963, Franklin's portrait was on the [[Franklin half dollar|half dollar]]. He has appeared on a [[United States fifty-dollar bill|$50 bill]] and on several varieties of the $100 bill from 1914 and 1918. Franklin appears on the $1,000 Series EE [[Treasury security#Savings bond|Savings bond]]. Philadelphia's [[Benjamin Franklin Parkway]] (a major thoroughfare) and [[Benjamin Franklin Bridge]] (the first major bridge to connect Philadelphia with New Jersey) are named in his honor.

In 1976, as part of a [[United States Bicentennial|bicentennial]] celebration, [[United States Congress|Congress]] dedicated a {{convert|20|ft|adj=on|0}} marble statue in Philadelphia's [[Franklin Institute]] as the [[Benjamin Franklin National Memorial]]. Many of Franklin's personal possessions are also on display at the Institute, one of the few national memorials located on [[property|private property]].

In London, his house at 36 Craven Street, which is the only surviving former residence of Benjamin Franklin, was first marked with a [[blue plaque]] and has since been opened to the public as the [[Benjamin Franklin House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.benjaminfranklinhouse.org/site/sections/default.htm |title=Benjamin Franklin House |publisher=Benjamin Franklin House. |accessdate=September 21, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217063307/http://www.benjaminfranklinhouse.org/site/sections/default.htm |archive-date=February 17, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, workmen restoring the building dug up the remains of six children and four adults hidden below the home. ''[[The Times]]'' reported on February 11, 1998:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Initial estimates are that the bones are about 200 years old and were buried at the time Franklin was living in the house, which was his home from 1757 to 1762 and from 1764 to 1775. Most of the bones show signs of having been dissected, sawn or cut. One skull has been drilled with several holes. Paul Knapman, the Westminster Coroner, said yesterday: "I cannot totally discount the possibility of a crime. There is still a possibility that I may have to hold an inquest.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Friends of Benjamin Franklin House (the organization responsible for the restoration) note that the bones were likely placed there by [[William Hewson (surgeon)|William Hewson]], who lived in the house for two years and who had built a small anatomy school at the back of the house. They note that while Franklin likely knew what Hewson was doing, he probably did not participate in any dissections because he was much more of a physicist than a medical man.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.benjaminfranklinhouse.org/site/sections/news/pdf/Issue2.pdf ''The Craven Street Gazette''] ([[PDF]]), Newsletter of the Friends of Benjamin Franklin House, Issue 2, Autumn 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

The trust began in 1785 when the French mathematician [[Charles-Joseph Mathon de la Cour]], who admired Franklin greatly, wrote a friendly [[parody]] of Franklin's "Poor Richard's Almanack" called "Fortunate Richard". The main character leaves a smallish amount of money in his will, five lots of 100 ''[[French livre|livres]]'', to collect interest over one, two, three, four or five full centuries, with the resulting astronomical sums to be spent on impossibly elaborate utopian projects.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Price. ''Observations on the Importance of the American Revolution, and the Means of Making it a Benefit to the World. To which is added, a Letter from M. Turgot, late Comptroller-General of the Finances of France: with an Appendix, containing a Translation of the Will of M. Fortuné Ricard, lately published in France.'' London: T. Cadell, 1785.&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin, who was 79 years old at the time, wrote thanking him for a great idea and telling him that he had decided to leave a bequest of 1,000&amp;nbsp;pounds each to his native Boston and his adopted Philadelphia. By 1990, more than $2,000,000 had accumulated in Franklin's Philadelphia trust, which had loaned the money to local residents. From 1940 to 1990, the money was used mostly for mortgage loans. When the trust came due, Philadelphia decided to spend it on scholarships for local high school students. Franklin's Boston trust fund accumulated almost $5,000,000 during that same time; at the end of its first 100 years a portion was allocated to help establish a [[Vocational school|trade school]] that became the [[Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology|Franklin Institute of Boston]], and the whole fund was later dedicated to supporting this institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mathsci.appstate.edu/~sjg/class/1010/wc/finance/franklin1.html |title=Excerpt from Philadelphia Inquirer article by Clark De Leon |publisher=Mathsci.appstate.edu |date=February 7, 1993 |accessdate=September 21, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510050913/http://www.mathsci.appstate.edu/~sjg/class/1010/wc/finance/franklin1.html |archive-date=May 10, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfit.edu/aboutus/history.php |title=History of the Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology |publisher=Bfit.edu |accessdate=September 21, 2009| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080731130624/http://www.bfit.edu/aboutus/history.php| archivedate = July 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Franklin on U.S. postage===
[[File:Benjamin Franklin 1861 Issue-1c.jpg|thumb|left|upright|&lt;center&gt;Issue of 1861&lt;/center&gt;]]
[[File:Benjamin Franklin2 1895 Issue-1c.jpg|thumb|upright=.85|&lt;center&gt;Issue of 1895&lt;/center&gt;]]
Benjamin Franklin is a prominent figure in American history comparable to Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln, and as such he has been honored on U.S. postage stamps many times. The image of Franklin, the first [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General]] of the United States, occurs on the face of U.S. postage more than any other notable American save that of [[George Washington]].&lt;ref name="Scotts"&gt;Scotts Specialized Catalogue of United States Stamps&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin appeared on the first U.S. postage stamp [[Benjamin Franklin#Postmaster|(displayed above)]] issued in 1847. From 1908 through 1923 the U.S. Post Office issued a series of postage stamps commonly referred to as the [[Washington-Franklin Issues]] where, along with George Washington, Franklin was depicted many times over a 14-year period, the longest run of any one series in U.S. postal history. Along with the regular issue stamps Franklin however only appears on a few [[:File:Ben Franklin 250th 1956 issue-3c.jpg|commemorative stamps]]. Some of the finest portrayals of Franklin on record can be found on the engravings inscribed on the face of U.S. postage.&lt;ref name="Scotts"/&gt;{{clear}}[[File:Benjamin Franklin 2-Big-Bens 1918 Issue.jpg|alt=Benjamin Franklin 2-Big-Bens 1918 Issue|thumb|center|upright=1.6|&lt;center&gt;Issue of 1918&lt;/center&gt;]]

===Bawdy Ben===
"[[Advice to a Friend on Choosing a Mistress]]" is a letter written by Benjamin Franklin, dated June 25, 1745, in which Franklin gives advice to a young man about channeling sexual urges. Due to its licentious nature, the letter was not published in collections of Franklin's papers during the nineteenth century. Federal court decisions from the mid-to-late twentieth century cited the document as a reason for overturning obscenity laws, using it to make a case against censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Carl Japikse, ed.|title=Fart Proudly: Writings of Benjamin Franklin You Never Read in School|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z8I3bAlV25kC&amp;pg=PA8|year=2003|publisher=Frog Books|page=8|isbn=978-1583940792}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exhibitions===
[[File:2012-07 ncc 04.JPG|thumb|Life-size bronze statue of Benjamin Franklin (seated) in the [[National Constitution Center]], Philadelphia]]
"The Princess and the Patriot: [[Yekaterina Vorontsova-Dashkova|Ekaterina Dashkova]], Benjamin Franklin and the Age of Enlightenment" exhibition opened in Philadelphia in February 2006 and ran through December 2006. Benjamin Franklin and Dashkova met only once, in Paris in 1781. Franklin was 75, and Dashkova was 37. Franklin invited Dashkova to become the first woman to join the American Philosophical Society; she was the only woman so honored for another 80 years. Later, Dashkova reciprocated by making him the first American member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]].

===Places and things named after Benjamin Franklin===
{{Further|List of places named for Benjamin Franklin}}
&lt;!-- This list is not intended to be comprehensive. To prevent this list from becoming too long, please consider adding additional places named for Franklin to the separate article titled "List of places named for Benjamin Franklin" as noted at the top of this section --&gt;

As a founding father of the United States, Franklin's name has been attached to many things. Among these are:
* The [[State of Franklin]], a short-lived independent state formed during the American Revolutionary War
* [[County (United States)|Counties]] in at least 16 U.S. states
* The [[Franklin Institute Awards]] (presented by the [[Franklin Institute]]) for significant contributions in the fields of science and engineering.
* Several major landmarks in and around [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, Franklin's longtime home, including:
** [[Franklin and Marshall College]] in nearby [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]]
** [[Franklin Field]], a [[American football|football]] field once home to the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] of the [[National Football League]] and the home field of the [[Penn Quakers football|University of Pennsylvania Quakers]] since 1895
** The [[Benjamin Franklin Bridge]] across the [[Delaware River]] between Philadelphia and [[Camden, New Jersey]]
* Several [[US Navy]] ships have been named the {{USS|Franklin}} or the {{USS|Bonhomme Richard}}, the latter being a French translation of his penname "Poor Richard". Two aircraft carriers, {{USS|Franklin|CV-13}} and {{USS|Bon Homme Richard|CV-31}}, were simultaneously in commission and in operation during World War II, and Franklin therefore had the distinction of having two simultaneously operational US Navy warships named in his honor. The [[French ship Franklin (1797)|French ship ''Franklin'' (1797)]] was also named in Franklin's honor.
* [[CMA CGM Benjamin Franklin|CMA CGM ''Benjamin Franklin'']], a Chinese-built French owned [[Explorer-class container ship]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/01/31/news/economy/china-container/index.html|title=This is the biggest container ship ever to dock in the U.S.|first1=Rebecca|last1=Wright|first2=Matt|last2=Rivers|date=January 31, 2016|work=[[CNNMoney]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4886">[[Domain Name System]] Blocking, or DNS Blocking is a strategy for making it difficult for users to locate specific domains or web sites on the [[Internet]]. It was first introduced in 1997 as a means to block [[spam email]] from known [[IP address]]es.&lt;ref&gt;What is a DNSBL?, http://whatismyipaddress.com/dnsbl-blacklist&lt;/ref&gt; However, DNS blocking should not be the only line of defense against spam email.&lt;ref&gt;How Useful Are Dns Block Lists?, http://www.articledashboard.com/Article/How-Useful-Are-DNS-Block-Lists/337523, Retrieved June 10, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

DNS blocking can also be applied for outgoing requests as well. Instead of returning the valid IP address of a requested site (for example, instead of 198.35.26.96 being returned by the DNS when "www.wikipedia.org" is entered into a browser,&lt;ref&gt;Hostname to IP Address Lookup, http://www.lookips.com/hostname-ip/www.wikipedia.org&lt;/ref&gt; if this IP were on a block list, the DNS might reply that the domain is unknown or with a different IP address that directs to a site with a page stating that the requested domain is not permitted). The latter case where the user is redirected to another destination would be considered [[DNS Spoofing]], otherwise known as "DNS Poisoning".&lt;ref&gt;DNS Poisoning - Is it effective?, http://www.watchdoginternational.net/index.php/filtering-technology/56-dns-poisoning-dummy-web-servers/56-isp-dns-poisoning-, Retrieved June 10, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; DNS blocking can be applied to individual servers/IP address, or entire blocks of IP addresses.

== Proposed Legislation ==
In addition to its technical impact, DNS Blocking also has many social and political implications. Free speech and due process are key concerns regarding DNS blocking, particularly in the United States. DNS Blocking was proposed to be mandated by the [[Stop Online Piracy Act]] (SOPA) and the [[PROTECT IP Act]] (PIPA).&lt;ref&gt;Internet society opposes stop online piracy act. (2011). Wireless News, , n/a. http://search.proquest.com/docview/912231747&lt;/ref&gt; It is a technique that essentially breaks the fundamental architecture of the internet. The goal for its use as intended by SOPA and PIPA is to prevent users from intentionally or unintentionally access web sites and web services that are known to host copyrighted material without authorization.

According to an article in Network World magazine, "Just about universally, the people responsible for the technical development and operation of the Internet have
said that the DNS-blocking proposals would break vital Internet technology while at the same time being entirely
ineffectual against people who are serious about violating copyright laws and largely ineffectual against those
who do so casually." &lt;ref&gt;Bradner, S. (2012). Science, technology and politicians. Network World (Online), , n/a. http://search.proquest.com/docview/917191332&lt;/ref&gt; They go on to claim that politicians who support this type of legislation are motivated by pressure from lobbyists and donors to their campaigns. These lobbyists and donors are often affiliated with special interest groups such as the [[MPAA]] and [[RIAA]].

== Criticism==
Google's chairman, Eric Schmidt, is quoted saying "I would be very, very careful if I were a government about arbitrarily [implementing] simple solutions to complex problems" in reference to DNS blocking and the PIPA bill.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, M. J. (2012). Copyright bill causes stir on foreign website blocking. Informationweek - Online, , n/a. http://search.proquest.com/docview/916010996&lt;/ref&gt; Experts claim that users could get around DNS blocking by using foreign search engines and foreign DNS servers. In fact, within two months of the legislation being introduced there were browser plug-ins released that enable users to resolve blocked domains.&lt;ref&gt;Firefox Add-On Bypasses SOPA DNS Blocking, http://torrentfreak.com/firefox-add-on-bypasses-sopa-dns-blocking-111220/, Retrieved June 10, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous industry experts have concerns regarding the effect of DNS blocking on the security of the Internet. A former Bush administration Department of Homeland Security policy director claimed that altering the Domain Name System "would do great damage to internet security." &lt;ref&gt;Rep. Smith Waters Down SOPA, DNS Redirects Out, https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/01/dns-sopa-provision/, Retrieved June 11, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''De revolutionibus orbium coelestium''''' (''On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres'') is the seminal work on the [[Copernican heliocentrism|heliocentric theory]] of the [[Renaissance]] astronomer [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] (1473–1543). The book, first printed in 1543 in [[Nuremberg]], [[Holy Roman Empire]], offered an alternative model of the universe to [[Ptolemy]]'s [[Ptolemaic system|geocentric system]], which had been widely accepted since ancient times.

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2017}}
[[File:De Revolutionibus manuscript p9b.jpg|thumb|left|190px|[[Heliocentric model]] of the [[solar system]] in [[Copernicus]]' [[manuscript]]]]
Copernicus initially outlined his system in a short, untitled, anonymous [[manuscript]] that he distributed to several friends, referred to as the ''[[Commentariolus]]''. A physician's library list dating to 1514 includes a manuscript whose description matches the ''Commentariolus'', so Copernicus must have begun work on his new system by that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gingerich|2004|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most historians believe that he wrote the ''Commentariolus'' after his return from Italy, possibly only after 1510. At this time, Copernicus anticipated that he could reconcile the motion of the Earth with the perceived motions of the planets easily, with fewer motions than were necessary in the ''[[Alfonsine Tables]]'', the version of the Ptolemaic system current at the time.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} In particular, the heliocentric Copernican model made use of the Urdi Lemma developed in the 13th century by [[Mu'ayyad al-Din al-'Urdi]], the first of the Maragha astronomers to develop a non-[[Geocentric model|Ptolemaic model]] of planetary motion.&lt;ref&gt;Saliba (1979).&lt;/ref&gt;

Observations of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] by [[Bernhard Walther]] (1430–1504) of [[Nuremberg]], a pupil of [[Regiomontanus]], were made available to [[Copernicus]] by [[Johannes Schöner]], 45 observations in total, 14 of them with [[longitude]] and [[latitude]]. Copernicus used three of them in ''De revolutionibus'', giving only longitudes, and erroneously attributing them to Schöner.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Copernicus' values differed slightly from the ones published by Schöner in 1544 in ''Observationes XXX annorum a I. Regiomontano et B. Walthero Norimbergae habitae, [4°, Norimb. 1544].''

A manuscript of ''De revolutionibus'' in Copernicus' own hand has survived. After his death, it was given to his pupil, [[Georg Joachim Rheticus|Rheticus]], who for publication had only been given a copy without annotations. Via Heidelberg, it ended up in Prague, where it was rediscovered and studied in the 19th century. Close examination of the manuscript, including the different types of paper used, helped scholars  construct an approximate timetable for its composition. Apparently Copernicus began by making a few astronomical observations to provide new data to perfect his models.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} He may have begun writing the book while still engaged in observations. By the 1530s a substantial part of the book was complete, but Copernicus hesitated to publish.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In 1539 [[Georg Joachim Rheticus]], a young mathematician from [[Wittenberg]], arrived in [[Frombork|Frauenburg]] (Frombork) to study with him. Rheticus read Copernicus' manuscript and immediately wrote a non-technical summary of its main theories in the form of an open letter addressed to Schöner, his astrology teacher in Nürnberg; he published this letter as the ''[[Narratio Prima]]'' in Danzig in 1540. Rheticus' friend and mentor [[Achilles Gasser]] published a second edition of the ''Narratio'' in Basel in 1541. Due to its friendly reception, Copernicus finally agreed to publication of more of his main work—in 1542, a treatise on [[trigonometry]], which was taken from the second book of the still unpublished ''De revolutionibus''. Rheticus published it in Copernicus' name.

Under strong pressure from Rheticus, and having seen that the first general reception of his work had not been unfavorable, Copernicus finally agreed to give the book to his close friend, Bishop [[Tiedemann Giese]], to be delivered to Rheticus in [[Wittenberg]] for printing by [[Johannes Petreius]] at [[Nürnberg]] (Nuremberg). It was published just before Copernicus' death, in 1543.

The book is dedicated to [[Pope Paul III]] in a preface that argues that mathematics, not physics, should be the basis for understanding and accepting his new theory.

''De revolutionibus'' is divided into six "books" (sections or parts), following closely the layout of Ptolemy's ''[[Almagest]]'' which it updated and replaced:&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|title=History of the planetary systems from Thales to Kepler|year=1906|first=John L E|last=Dreyer|page=342|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofplaneta00dreyuoft|ref=harv}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
* Book I chapters 1–11 are a general vision of the heliocentric theory, and a summarized exposition of his [[cosmology]]. The world (heavens) is spherical, as is the earth, and the land and water make a single globe. The celestial bodies, including the earth, have regular circular and everlasting movements. The earth rotates on its axis and around the sun. Answers to why the ancients thought the earth was central. The order of the planets around the sun and their periodicity. Chapters 12-14 give theorems for [[Chord (geometry)|chord]] geometry as well as a table of chords.
* Book II describes the principles of spherical astronomy as a basis for the arguments developed in the following books and gives a comprehensive catalogue of the fixed stars.
* Book III describes his work on the precession of the equinoxes and treats the apparent movements of the [[Sun]] and related phenomena.
* Book IV is a similar description of the [[Moon]] and its orbital movements.
* Book V explains how to calculate the positions of the [[Planet|wandering star]]s based on the heliocentric model and gives tables for the five planets.
* Book VI deals with the digression in latitude from the ecliptic of the five planets.

Copernicus argued that the universe comprised eight spheres. The outermost consisted of motionless, fixed stars, with the Sun motionless at the center. The known planets revolved about the Sun, each in its own sphere, in the order: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn. The Moon, however, revolved in its sphere around the Earth. What appeared to be the daily revolution of the Sun and fixed stars around the Earth was actually the Earth's daily rotation on its own axis.

Copernicus adhered to one of the standard beliefs of his time, namely that the motions of celestial bodies must be composed of uniform circular motions. For this reason, he was unable to account for the observed apparent motion of the planets without retaining a complex system of [[epicycle]]s similar to those of the Ptolemaic system.
Despite Copernicus' adherence to this aspect of ancient astronomy, his radical shift from a [[geocentric model|geocentric]] to a heliocentric cosmology was a serious blow to [[Aristotle]]'s science—and helped usher in the [[Scientific Revolution]].

==''Ad lectorem''==
[[File:De revolutionibus 1617 Astronomia instaurata.png|thumb|200px|Title page, 3rd ed., [[Amsterdam]], [[Nicolaus Mulerius]], publisher, 1617]]

[[Rheticus]] left [[Nürnberg]] to take up his post as professor in [[Leipzig]]. The [[Lutheran]] preacher [[Andreas Osiander]] had taken over the task of supervising the printing and publication. In an effort to reduce the controversial impact of the book Osiander added his own unsigned letter ''Ad lectorem de hypothesibus huius operis'' (''To the reader concerning the hypotheses of this work'')&lt;ref&gt;Wallis's translation ([[#CITEREFCopernicus1952|1952]], p.505)&lt;/ref&gt; printed in front of Copernicus' preface which was a dedicatory letter to Pope Paul III and which kept the title "Praefatio authoris" (to acknowledge that the unsigned letter was not by the book's author).

Osiander's letter stated that Copernicus' system was mathematics intended to aid computation and not an attempt to declare literal truth:
{{quote|it is the duty of an astronomer to compose the history of the celestial motions through careful and expert study. Then he must conceive and devise the causes of these motions or hypotheses about them. Since he cannot in any way attain to the true causes, he will adopt whatever suppositions enable the motions to be computed correctly&amp;nbsp;... The present author has performed both these duties excellently. For these hypotheses need not be true nor even probable. On the contrary, if they provide a calculus consistent with the observations, that alone is enough&amp;nbsp;... For this art, it is quite clear, is completely and absolutely ignorant of the causes of the apparent [movement of the heavens]. And if any causes are devised by the imagination, as indeed very many are, they are not put forward to convince anyone that they are true, but merely to provide a reliable basis for computation. However, since different hypotheses are sometimes offered for one and the same&amp;nbsp;... the astronomer will take as his first choice that hypothesis which is the easiest to grasp. The philosopher will perhaps rather seek the semblance of the truth. But neither of them will understand or state anything certain, unless it has been divinely revealed to him&amp;nbsp;... Let no one expect anything certain from astronomy, which cannot furnish it, lest he accept as the truth ideas conceived for another purpose, and depart this study a greater fool than when he entered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Legal Modernism|author=David Luban|publisher=University of Michigan|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
As even Osiander's defenders point out, the ''Ad lectorem'' "expresses views on the aim and nature of scientific theories at variance with Copernicus' claims for his own theory".&lt;ref name="Wrightsman"&gt;''Andreas Osiander's Contribution to the Copernican Achievement'', by Bruce Wrightsman, Section VII, The Copernican Achievement, ed. Robert S. Westman, University of California Press, Los Angeles, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

Many view Osiander's letter as a betrayal of science and Copernicus, and an attempt to pass his own thoughts off as those of the book's author. An example of this type of claim can be seen in the ''Catholic Encyclopedia'', which states "Fortunately for him [the dying Copernicus], he could not see what Osiander had done. This reformer, knowing the attitude of Luther and Melanchthon against the heliocentric system&amp;nbsp;... without adding his own name, replaced the preface of Copernicus by another strongly contrasting in spirit with that of Copernicus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nicolaus Copernicus|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04352b.htm|publisher=Catholic Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Osiander's motives behind the letter have been questioned by many, he has been defended by historian Bruce Wrightsman, who points out he was not an enemy of science. Osiander had many scientific connections including "Johannes Schoner, Rheticus's teacher, whom Osiander recommended for his post at the Nurnberg Gymnasium; Peter Apian of Ingolstadt University; Hieronymous Schreiber...Joachim Camerarius...Erasmus Reinhold...Joachim Rheticus...and finally, Hieronymous Cardan."&lt;ref name="Wrightsman"/&gt;

The historian Wrightsman put forward that Osiander did not sign the letter because he "was such a notorious [Protestant] reformer whose name was well-known and infamous among Catholics",&lt;ref name="Wrightsman"/&gt; so that signing would have likely caused negative scrutiny of the work of Copernicus (a loyal Catholic canon and scholar). Copernicus himself had communicated to Osiander his "own fears that his work would be scrutinized and criticized by the 'peripatetics and theologians',"&lt;ref name="Wrightsman"/&gt; and he had already been in trouble with his bishop, [[Johannes Dantiscus]], on account of his former relationship with his mistress and friendship with Dantiscus's enemy and suspected heretic, Alexander Scultetus. It was also possible that Protestant Nurnberg could fall to the forces of the [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor]] and since "the books of hostile theologians could be burned...why not scientific works with the names of hated theologians affixed to them?&lt;ref name="Wrightsman"/&gt;" Wrightsman also holds that this is why Copernicus did not mention his top student, Rheticus (a Lutheran) in the book's dedication to the Pope.&lt;ref name="Wrightsman"/&gt;

Osiander's interest in astronomy was theological, hoping for "improving the chronology of historical events and thus providing more accurate apocalyptic interpretations of the Bible... [he shared in] the general awareness that the calendar was not in agreement with astronomical movement and therefore, needed to be corrected by devising better models on which to base calculations." In an era before the telescope, Osiander (like most of the era's mathematical astronomers) attempted to bridge the "fundamental incompatibility between Ptolemaic astronomy and Aristotlian physics, and the need to preserve both", by taking an 'instrumentalist' position. Only the handful of "Philosophical purists like the [[Averroism|Averroists]]... demanded physical consistency and thus sought for realist models."&lt;ref name="Wrightsman"/&gt;

Copernicus was hampered by his insistence on preserving the idea that celestial bodies had to travel in perfect spheres – he "was still attached to classical ideas of circular motion around deferents and epicycles, and spheres."&lt;ref name="Tobin"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Life and Science of Léon Foucault: The Man who Proved the Earth Rotates|author=William Tobin|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was particularly troubling concerning the Earth because he "attached the Earth's axis rigidly to a Sun-centered sphere. The unfortunate consequence was that the terrestrial rotation axis then maintained the same inclination with respect to the Sun as the sphere turned, eliminating the seasons."&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt; To explain the seasons, he had to propose a third motion, "an annual contrary conical sweep of the terrestrial axis".&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt; It was not until the [[Great Comet of 1577]], which moved as if there were no spheres to crash through, did the idea come under question. In 1609, [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] fixed Copernicus' theory by stating that the planets orbit the sun not in circles, but ellipses. Only after Kepler's refinement of Copernicus' theory was the need for deferents and epicycles abolished.

In his work, Copernicus "used conventional, hypothetical devices like epicycles...as all astronomers had done since antiquity. ...hypothetical constructs solely designed to 'save the phenomena' and aid computation".&lt;ref name="Wrightsman"/&gt; Ptolemy's theory contained a hypothesis about the epicycle of Venus that was viewed as absurd if seen as anything other than a geometrical device (its brightness and distance should have varied greatly, but they don't). "In spite of this defect in Ptolemy's theory, Copernicus' hypothesis predicts approximately the same variations."&lt;ref name="Wrightsman"/&gt; Because of the use of similar terms and similar deficiencies, Osiander could see "little technical or physical truth-gain"&lt;ref name="Wrightsman"/&gt; between one system and the other. It was this attitude towards technical astronomy that had allowed it to "function since antiquity, despite its inconsistencies with the principles of physics and the philosophical objections of [[Averroism|Averroists]]."&lt;ref name="Wrightsman"/&gt;

Writing ''Ad lectorem'', Osiander was influenced by [[Pico della Mirandola]]'s idea that humanity "orders [an intellectual] cosmos out of the chaos of opinions."&lt;ref name="Wrightsman"/&gt; From Pico's writings, Osiander "learned to extract and synthesize insights from many sources without becoming the slavish follower of any of them."&lt;ref name="Wrightsman"/&gt; The effect of Pico on Osiander was tempered by the influence of [[Nicholas of Cusa]]'s and his idea of ''coincidentia oppositorum''. Rather than having Pico's focus on human effort, Osiander followed Cusa's idea that understanding the Universe and its Creator only came from divine inspiration rather than intellectual organization. From these influences, Osiander held that in the area of philosophical speculation and scientific hypothesis there are "no heretics of the intellect", but when one gets past speculation into truth-claims the Bible is the ultimate measure. By holding Copernicianism was mathematical speculation, Osiander held that it would be silly to hold it up against the accounts of the Bible.

Pico's influence on Osiander did not escape Rheticus, who reacted strongly against the ''Ad lectorem''. As historian Robert S. Westman puts it, "The more profound source of Rheticus's ire however, was Osiander's view of astronomy as a disciple fundamentally incapable of knowing anything with certainty. For Rheticus, this extreme position surely must have resonated uncomfortably with Pico della Mirandola's attack on the foundations of divinatory astrology."&lt;ref name="Westman"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Copernican Question: Prognostication, Skepticism, and Celestial Order|author=Robert S. Westman|publisher=University of California Press|year=2011|location=Los Angeles, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Disputations'', Pico had made a devastating attack on astrology. Because those who were making astrological predictions relied on astronomers to tell them where the planets were, they also became a target. Pico held that since astronomers who calculate planetary positions could not agree among themselves, how were they to be held as reliable? While Pico could bring into concordance writers like Aristotle, Plato, Plotinus, Averroes, Avicenna, and Aquinas, the lack of consensus he saw in astronomy was a proof to him of its fallibility alongside astrology. Pico pointed out that the astronomers' instruments were imprecise and any imperfection of even a degree made them worthless for astrology, people should not trust astrologists because they should not trust the numbers from astronomers. Pico pointed out that astronomers couldn't even tell where the sun appeared in the order of the planets as they orbited the earth (some put it close to the moon, others among the planets). How, Pico asked, could astrologists possibly claim they could read what was going on when the astronomers they relied on could offer no precision on even basic questions?

As Westman points out, to Rheticus "it would seem that Osiander now offered new grounds for endorsing Pico's conclusions: not merely was the disagreement among astronomers grounds for mistrusting the sort of knowledge that they produced, but now Osiander proclaimed that astronomers might construct a world deduced from (possibly) false premises. Thus the conflict between Piconian skepticism and secure principles for the science of the stars was built right into the complex dedicatory apparatus of ''De Revolutionibus'' itself."&lt;ref name="Westman"/&gt; According to the notes of [[Michael Maestlin]], "Rheticus...became embroiled in a very bitter wrangle with the printer [over the Ad lectorem]. Rheticus...suspected Osiander had prefaced the work; if he knew this for certain, he declared, he would rough up the fellow so violently that in future he would mind his own business."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glasgow University Library Special Collections Department, Book of the Month, Nicolaus Copernicus De Revolutionibus Nuremberg: 1543 Sp Coll Hunterian Cz.1.13 |url=http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/exhibns/month/apr2008.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424101945/http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/exhibns/month/apr2008.html |archivedate=2013-04-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Objecting to the ''Ad lectorem'', [[Tiedemann Giese]] urged the Nuremberg city council to issue a correction, but this was not done, and the matter was forgotten. [[Jan Brożek|Jan Broscius]], a supporter of Copernicus, also despaired of the ''Ad lectorem'', writing "Ptolemy's hypothesis is the earth rests. Copernicus' hypothesis is that the earth is in motion. Can either, therefore, be true?&amp;nbsp;... Indeed, Osiander deceives much with that preface of his&amp;nbsp;... Hence, someone may well ask: How is one to know which hypothesis is truer, the Ptolemaic or the Copernican?"&lt;ref name="Wrightsman"/&gt;

Petreius had sent a copy to [[Hieronymus Schreiber]], an astronomer from Nürnberg who had substituted for Rheticus as professor of mathematics in Wittenberg while Rheticus was in Nürnberg supervising the printing.  Schreiber, who died in 1547, left in his copy of the book a note about Osiander's authorship. Via [[Michael Mästlin]], this copy came to Johannes Kepler, who discovered what Osiander had done&lt;ref&gt;Edward Rosen: ''Three Copernican Treatises: The Commentariolus of Copernicus, The Letter Against Werner, The Narratio Prima of Rheticus'', Dover Publications, 2004, {{ISBN|0-486-43605-5}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ceSnipu4MykC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=jerome+schreiber&amp;sig=aJ7m5S_Jn2_PvyMaQZ9I7tUB0G4 p. 24].&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Koestler|1959|p=169}} and methodically demonstrated that Osiander had indeed added the foreword.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Westman, "Three Responses to Copernican Theory", in Robert Westman, ed., ''The Copernican Achievement'', 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; The most knowledgeable astronomers of the time had realized that the foreword was Osiander's doing.

Owen Gingerich&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|first=O.|last=Gingerich|title=The book nobody read|publisher=Heinemann, London|year=2004|pages=159–164|ref=harv}}
&lt;/ref&gt; gives a slightly different version: Kepler knew of Osiander's authorship since he had read about it in one of Schreiber's annotations in his copy of ''De Revolutionibus''; Maestlin learned of the fact from Kepler. Indeed, Maestlin perused Kepler's book, up to the point of leaving a few annotations in it. However, Maestlin already suspected Osiander, because he had bought his ''De revolutionibus'' from the widow of [[Philipp Apian]]; examining his books, he had found a note attributing the introduction to Osiander.

[[Johannes Praetorius]] (1537–1616), who learned of Osiander's authorship from Rheticus during a visit to him in [[Kraków]], wrote Osiander's name in the margin of the foreword in his copy of ''De revolutionibus''.

All three early editions of ''De revolutionibus'' included Osiander's foreword.

==Reception==
Even before the 1543 publication of ''De revolutionibus'', rumors circulated
about its central theses. [[Martin Luther]] is quoted as saying in 1539:

&lt;blockquote&gt;People gave ear to an upstart astrologer who strove to show that the earth revolves, not the heavens or the firmament, the sun and the moon&amp;nbsp;... This fool wishes to reverse the entire science of astronomy; but sacred Scripture tells us [Joshua 10:13] that Joshua commanded the sun to stand still, and not the earth.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[Thomas Kuhn]], ''[[The Copernican Revolution (book)|The Copernican Revolution]]'', Cambridge, Massachusetts, Harvard University Press, 1957, p.&amp;nbsp;191.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When the book was finally published, demand was low, with an initial print run of 400 failing to sell out.&lt;ref name="BallParacelsus"&gt;Philip Ball, ''The Devil's Doctor: Paracelsus and the World of Renaissance Magic and Science'', {{ISBN|978-0-09-945787-9}}, p.&amp;nbsp;354.&lt;/ref&gt; Copernicus had made the book extremely technical, unreadable to all but the most advanced astronomers of the day, allowing it to disseminate into their ranks before stirring great controversy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Kuhn]], ''The Copernican Revolution'', p.&amp;nbsp;185.&lt;/ref&gt; And, like Osiander, contemporary mathematicians and astronomers encouraged its audience to view it as a useful mathematical fiction with no physical reality, thereby somewhat
shielding it from accusations of blasphemy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Kuhn]], ''The Copernican Revolution'', pp.&amp;nbsp;186–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among some astronomers, the book "at once took its place as a worthy successor to the ''Almagest'' of Ptolemy, which had hitherto been the Alpha and Omega of astronomers".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dreyer|1906|p=345}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erasmus Reinhold]] hailed the work in 1542 and by 1551 had developed the ''[[Prutenic Tables]]'' ("Prussian Tables"; {{lang-la|Tabulae prutenicae}}; {{lang-de|Preußische Tafeln}}) using Copernicus' methods. The ''Prutenic Tables'', published in 1551, were used as a basis for the [[Gregorian calendar|calendar reform]] instituted in 1582 by [[Pope Gregory XIII]]. They were also used by sailors and maritime explorers, whose 15th-century predecessors had used [[Regiomontanus]]' ''Table of the Stars''. In England, [[Robert Recorde]], [[John Dee]], [[Thomas Digges]] and [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] were among those who adopted his position; in Germany, [[Christian Wurstisen]], [[Christoph Rothmann]] and [[Michael Mästlin]], the teacher of [[Johannes Kepler]]; in Italy, [[Giambattista Benedetti]] and [[Giordano Bruno]] whilst [[Franciscus Patricius]] accepted the rotation of the earth. In Spain, rules published in 1561 for the curriculum of the [[University of Salamanca]] gave students the choice between studying Ptolemy or Copernicus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Deming |first=David |year=2012 |title=Science and Technology in World History, Volume 3: The Black Death, the Renaissance, the Reformation and the Scientific Revolution |ISBN=9780786461721 |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company |page=138 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lXGEXih4yLYC&amp;pg=PA138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gilbert |first=William |year=1998 |title=The Renaissance and The Reformation |oclc=817744956 |publisher=Carrie |chapter=Chapter 23: The Beginning of the Scientific Revolution |url=http://vlib.iue.it/carrie/texts/carrie_books/gilbert/index.html |chapterurl=http://vlib.iue.it/carrie/texts/carrie_books/gilbert/23.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of those students, [[Diego de Zúñiga]], published an acceptance of Copernican theory in 1584.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dreyer|1906|pp=346–352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Very soon, nevertheless, Copernicus' theory was attacked with Scripture and with the common Aristotelian proofs. In 1549 [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]], Luther's principal lieutenant, wrote against Copernicus, pointing to the theory's apparent conflict with Scripture and advocating that "severe measures" be taken to restrain the impiety of Copernicans.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Kuhn]], ''The Copernican Revolution'', p.&amp;nbsp;192. Kuhn writes that Melanchthon emphasized Ecclesiastes 1:4-5 ("The earth abideth forever&amp;nbsp;... the sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose").&lt;/ref&gt;
The works of Copernicus and [[Diego de Zúñiga|Zúñiga]]—the latter for asserting that ''De revolutionibus'' was compatible with Catholic faith—were placed on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|Index of Forbidden Books]] by a decree of the Sacred Congregation of March 5, 1616 (more than 70 years after Copernicus' publication):

&lt;blockquote&gt;This Holy Congregation has also learned about the spreading and acceptance by many of the false Pythagorean doctrine, altogether contrary to the Holy Scripture, that the earth moves and the sun is motionless, which is also taught by Nicholaus Copernicus' ''De revolutionibus orbium coelestium'' and by Diego de Zúñiga's ''In Job''&amp;nbsp;... Therefore, in order that this opinion may not creep any further to the prejudice of Catholic truth, the Congregation has decided that the books by Nicolaus Copernicus [''De revolutionibus''] and Diego de Zúñiga [''In Job''] be suspended until corrected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?MODO=PAGINA&amp;VOLPAG=19-323 Original Latin text] and an [https://web.archive.org/web/20070930013053/http://astro.wcupa.edu/mgagne/ess362/resources/finocchiaro.html#indexdecree English translation]. Also mentioned by W. R. Shea and M. Artigas in ''[https://www.scribd.com/doc/20142387/Galileo-in-Rome-W-R-Shea-M-Artigas Galileo in Rome] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091119182243/http://www.scribd.com/doc/20142387/Galileo-in-Rome-W-R-Shea-M-Artigas |date=2009-11-19 }}'' (2003), pp.&amp;nbsp;84–85, {{ISBN|0-19-516598-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''De revolutionibus'' was not formally banned but merely withdrawn from circulation, pending "corrections" that would clarify the theory's status as hypothesis. Nine sentences that represented the heliocentric system as certain were to be omitted or changed. After these corrections were prepared and formally approved in 1620 the reading of the book was permitted.&lt;ref name="cath-encyc"&gt;"[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04352b.htm Nicolaus Copernicus]", ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]].''&lt;/ref&gt; But the book was never reprinted with the changes and was available in Catholic jurisdictions only to suitably qualified scholars, by special request.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} It remained on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|Index]] until 1758, when [[Pope Benedict XIV]] (1740–58) removed the uncorrected book from his revised Index.&lt;ref name="cath-encyc2"&gt;"[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04352b.htm Benedict XIV]", ''Catholic Encyclopedia''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Census of copies==
[[Arthur Koestler]] described ''De revolutionibus'' as "''The Book That Nobody Read''" saying the book "was and is an all-time worst seller", despite the fact that it was reprinted four times.{{Sfn|Koestler|1959|p=194}} [[Owen Gingerich]], a writer on both Nicolaus Copernicus and [[Johannes Kepler]], disproved this after a 35-year project to examine every surviving copy of the first two editions. Gingerich showed that nearly all the leading mathematicians and astronomers of the time owned and read the book; however, his analysis of the [[marginalia]] shows that they almost all ignored the [[cosmology]] at the beginning of the book and were only interested in Copernicus' new [[equant]]-free models of [[planetary motion]] in the later chapters. Also, [[Nicolaus Reimers]] in 1587 translated the book into German.

Gingerich's efforts and conclusions are recounted in ''The Book Nobody Read'', published in 2004 by Walker &amp; Co. His census&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gingerich|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; included 276 copies of the first edition (by comparison, there are 228 extant copies of the [[First Folio]] of [[Shakespeare]]) and 325 copies of the second.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gingerich|2004|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research behind this book earned its author the Polish government's [[Order of Merit of Poland|Order of Merit]] in 1981. Due largely to  Gingerich's scholarship, ''De revolutionibus'' has been researched and catalogued better than any other first-edition historic text except for the original [[Gutenberg Bible]].&lt;ref name="DeMarco"&gt;Peter DeMarco.

One of the copies now resides at the [[Archives of the University of Santo Tomas]] in the [[Miguel de Benavides Library]]. In January 2017, a second-edition copy was stolen as part of a heist of rare books from [[Heathrow Airport]] and remains unrecovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McNearney |first=Allison |date=8 April 2017 |title=The Mystery of the $2.5 Million Rare Book Heist |website=thedailybeast.com |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/04/08/the-mystery-of-the-2-5-million-rare-book-heist.html |quote=[Alessandro Meda] Riquier was the owner of several of the most noteworthy tomes that were taken in the heist. The most expensive book was a second edition of Copernicus's ''On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres'' from 1566 in which the astronomer introduced his revolutionary theory that the sun—not the Earth—is the center of the universe. That book alone is worth over $250,000.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2441">'''Ernst Wilhelm Moes''' (1864 &amp;ndash; 1912), was a Dutch art historian and director of the print cabinet for the [[Rijksmuseum]].

==Biography==
According to the [[NNBW]] he studied art at the University of Amsterdam and became a print collector while still a student, specialized in Amsterdam history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historici.nl/Onderzoek/Projecten/BWN/lemmata/bwn2/moes Ernst Wilhelm Moes] on [[historici.nl]]&lt;/ref&gt; To simplify his research, from 1885 he became a volunteer at the Amsterdam auction house of [[Frederik Muller]].&lt;ref name=RKD&gt;[https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/436308 Ernst Wilhelm Moes] in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896 he published his first work on the history of the Amsterdam publishing industry. His ''Iconographia'', a comprehensive guide to portraits of Dutch people, was published by [[Frederik Muller &amp; Co]]. In 1898 he began work as assistant to [[Philip van der Kellen]] in the Amsterdam Rijksmuseum and from 1903 until his death by tuberculosis he was the head of the print cabinet of the museum. From 1907 until 1911 he was a member of [[Teylers Tweede Genootschap]]. 
He worked together with [[Abraham Bredius]] on the magazine [[Oud Holland]], and Bredius wrote his obituary.&lt;ref&gt;A. Bredius, 'In memoriam Ernst Wilhelm Moes', Oud-Holland 31 (1913), p. 1-3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Heim, François-Joseph - Louis-Philippe Opening the Galerie des Batailles - 1837.jpg|thumb|right|Louis-Philippe opening the ''Galerie des Batailles'', 10 June 1837 (painted by [[François-Joseph Heim]])|300px]]
[[File:Schlachtengalerie Decke.jpg|thumb|300px|Central part of the ceiling of the Galerie des Batailles]]
The '''Galerie des Batailles''' (''Gallery of Battles'') is a 120 metre long and 13 metre wide (390&amp;nbsp;ft. x 43&amp;nbsp;ft.) gallery occupying the first floor of the aile du Midi of the [[Palace of Versailles]], joining onto the [[Grand appartement de la reine|grand]] and [[Petit appartement de la reine|petit]] 'appartements de la reine'. It is an epigone of the ''Grande galerie'' of the [[Louvre]] and was intended to glorify French military history from the [[Battle of Tolbiac]] (traditionally dated 496) to the [[Battle of Wagram]] (5–6 July 1809).

== History ==
Its creation was the idea of [[Louis-Philippe I, King of the French]] and it replaced apartments which had been occupied in the 17th and 18th centuries by
* [[Louis XIV]]'s brother [[Philippe I, Duke of Orléans]] and his second wife, [[Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate]]
* [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans]] (regent during [[Louis XV]]'s minority) and his wife
* the regent's son [[Louis d'Orléans, Duke of Orléans]]
* [[Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony (1731–1767)]] as dauphine
* [[Charles X of France]], whilst comte d’Artois
* [[Princess Élisabeth of France]]

The architects [[Pierre-François-Léonard Fontaine]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://lhistoire.over-blog.net/article-10789296.html Histoire de Versailles].&lt;/ref&gt; and Frédéric Nepveu created a solemn decorative scheme for it, with a wide cornice supporting a coffered painted ceiling with entablatures supported by Corinthian columns along the length of the gallery. 13 bronze tablets on the wall are inscribed with the names of princes, admirals, constables, marshals and warriors killed or wounded whilst fighting for France. There are also busts placed on supports against the columns and between the paintings.

The main contents of the rooms, however, were envisaged as the vast paintings showing major military events in French history, some already in existence but mostly specially commissioned for the Galerie. While a number of them were of questionable quality, a few masterpieces, such as the ''Battle of Taillebourg'' by [[Eugène Delacroix]], were displayed here.

'''Hannah White''' (born Hannah Elizabeth Gwillim White on 30 March 1983 in Berkshire, England) is a broadcaster, sailor, and adventurer. She is best known as the [[Guinness World Records]] holder for fastest person to cross the [[English Channel]] and her television show 'Go Hard or Go Home'.

==Personal life==
The younger of two children, White grew up in Newbury, Berkshire and was educated at the [[Godolphin School]] in Salisbury.&lt;ref name = "fastest"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Taylor |first1=Jeremy |title=ME AND MY MOTOR: HANNAH WHITE, FASTEST WOMAN TO SAIL ACROSS THE CHANNEL |url=https://www.driving.co.uk/news/interview/mamm/motor-hannah-white/ |accessdate=10 September 2018 |publisher=The Sunday Times |date=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Having married a Suffolk farmer,&lt;ref name = "fastest"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sailor Hannah White has her eye on the Women’s World Speed Sailing record |url=https://www.countryandtownhouse.co.uk/culture/womens-world-speed-sailing-record-hannah-white/ |website=countryandtownhouse.co.uk |accessdate=10 September 2018 |date=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; she now lives in Suffolk with him and they have a daughter together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=hannahwhiteuk|number=884087830145781760|date=9 July 2017|title=We are finally emerging from the newborn baby bubble!

==Career==

===Sailing===
Having first been introduced to sailing at the age of 15 by the family of one of her school friends, White's first ever [[Cowes Week]] was a frustrating experience with her feeling, due to her novice status, like she was "always getting in the way and in the wrong place”. However, this, alongside a genuine passion for being 'on the water' was her first step on her sailing career. She finished second place finish in the solo trans-Atlantic race, the [[OSTAR]], in 2009. A 3200&amp;nbsp;nm race following the historical North Atlantic route from Plymouth, UK to Newport, USA she completed the race in 20days 22mins, missing out on the under 35-foot world record by just a few minutes but being awarded the prestigious media award for the OSTAR, as voted for by the public. In total, White made two solo attempts to cross the Atlantic between 2005 (in this year as the youngest ever female competitor) and 2009, one of which was successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Laven |first1=Kate |title=Hannah White hopes to finish OSTAR after failure last time |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/sailing/5378592/Hannah-White-hopes-to-finish-OSTAR-after-failure-last-time.html |accessdate=10 September 2018 |date=24 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2015, she became the new [[Guinness World Records]] holder for the fastest crossing of the English Channel in a single-handed dinghy by doing so in 3 hours, 44 minutes and 39 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=LAND ROVER GLOBAL AMBASSADOR, HANNAH WHITE, SECURES GUINNESS WORLD RECORDSTM TITLE FOR FASTEST CROSSING OF THE ENGLISH CHANNEL IN A SINGLE-HANDED DINGHY |url=https://www.landrover.co.uk/explore-land-rover/news/hannah-white-secures-guinness-world-record.html |website=landrover.co.uk |accessdate=10 September 2018 |date=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ADVENTURER HANNAH WHITE SETS WORLD RECORD FOR ENGLISH CHANNEL CROSSING |url=https://www.spencer-ogden.com/spencerogdenannouncements/adventurer-hannah-white-sets-world-record-for-english-channel-crossing-51565159852 |website=spencer-ogden.com |accessdate=10 September 2018 |date=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Broadcasting==

===Sailing===
During her professional racing career, White featured heavily in the local press, frequently working for BBC local radio and ITV Meridian, covering maritime and sailing events.

In 2010, White was part of the commentary team for the Olympic test event, [[Sail for Gold]] in Weymouth. In 2011, White became the lead presenter for the [[World Match Racing Tour]], broadcasting to over 180 countries worldwide. The live coverage for Monsoon Cup in Malaysia was nominated for a National RTS Award for best live event.

At the end of 2011, White joined the [[Volvo Ocean Race]] as Master of Ceremonies and Presenter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Adam |first1=Shabana |title=INTERVIEW: Sailing Enthusiast Turned Broadcaster Hannah White |url=https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/travel/Hannah+White+interview-250165.html |website=femalefirst.co.uk |accessdate=10 September 2018 |date=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commentating on racing, and MC’ing prize givings, race days arrival and departure ceremonies to 2.9 million people around the world. Average live audiences on In-Port race days were 43,882.
 
White was co-presenter and commentator for the Sailing Venue, Weymouth at the London [[2012 Olympic Games]].

===Go Hard or Go Home===
Aired in January 2014, Go Hard or Go Home was produced by Channel 5 and focused on the members of the British public which White choose to train for athletic challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fletcher |first1=Alex |title='Go Hard or Go Home': Channel 5 launches adventure challenge series |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/news/a501161/go-hard-or-go-home-channel-5-launches-adventure-challenge-series/ |website=digitalspy.com |accessdate=10 September 2018 |date=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hortus Malabaricus''''' (meaning "Garden of Malabar") is a comprehensive treatise that deals with the properties of the flora of the [[Western Ghats]] region principally covering the areas now in the [[India]]n states of [[Kerala]], [[Karnataka]] and the union territory of [[Goa]].

==History==
Written in [[Latin]], it was compiled over a period of nearly 30 years and published in [[Amsterdam]] during 1678–1693.&lt;ref name="BHL707"&gt;{{cite book |last=Reede tot Drakestein |first=Hendrik van |title=Hortus Indicus Malabaricus :continens regni Malabarici apud Indos cereberrimi onmis generis plantas rariores, Latinas, Malabaricis, Arabicis, Brachmanum charactareibus hominibusque expressas ... |publisher=Amstelaedami :sumptibus Johannis van Someren, et Joannis van Dyck |year=1678–1703 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/707 |accessdate=2008-09-09 |language=Latin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was conceived by [[Hendrik van Rheede]], who was the Governor of [[Dutch Malabar]] at the time. The book has been translated into [[English language|English]] and [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]] by [[K. S. Manilal]] and published by the University of Kerala.&lt;ref name="hindumal"&gt;{{cite news

[[File:HortusMalabaricus.jpg|thumb|225px|Frontispiece of volume 1.]]

==About ==
The ''Hortus Malabaricus'' comprises 12 volumes of about 200 pages each, with 794 copper plate engravings. The first of the 12 volumes of the book was published in 1678, and the last in 1693. It is believed to be the earliest comprehensive printed work on the flora of [[Asia]] and the [[tropics]].

Mentioned in these volumes are plants of the [[Malabar Coast|Malabar region]] which in his time referred to the stretch along the [[Western Ghats]] from [[Goa]] to [[Kanyakumari district|Kanyakumari]]. The book gives a detailed account of the flora of [[Kerala]], along with sketches and detailed descriptions. Over 742 different plants and their indigenous science are considered in the book. The book also employs a system of classification based on the traditions adopted by the practitioners of that region. Apart from Latin, the plant names have been recorded in other languages including [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]], [[Konkani language|Konkani]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], English.
The comprehensive nature of the book is noted by T. Whitehouse in his 1859 ''Historical Notices of Cochin on the Malabar Coast'':&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/SomeHistoricalNotesOfCochinOnTheMalabarCoast/some%20historical%20notes%20of%20cochin%20on%20the%20malabar%20coast#page/n0/mode/2up  rchive.org: ''Historical Notices of Cochin on the Malabar Coast''; Reverend T. Whitehouse; Cottayam C M Press, Kerala; 1859.]&lt;/ref&gt; 
:{{quote|''All the country around was diligently searched by the natives best acquainted with the habitats of plants; and fresh specimens were brought to Cochin where the Carmelite Mathaeus sketched them, with such striking accuracy, that there was no difficulty in identifying each particular species when you see his drawings. Names of each species is written in Malayalam as well as Konkani (Then known as Brahmananchi Bhas) A description of each plant was written in Malayalam and thence translated into Portuguese, by a resident at Cochin, named Emmanuel Carneiro. The Secretary to Government, Herman Van Douep, further translated it into Latin, that the learned in all the countries of Europe might have access to it. The whole seems then to have passed under the supervision of another learned individual named Casearius, who was probably a Dutch Chaplain and a personal friend of Van Rheede. A book of its size, on which such care was expended, must have consumed a fortune before its publication, and confers honour, both on those who compiled it and the place where it was compiled.''}}

Several species of plants have their [[type (biology)|type]] illustrations in this work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = N. C. | last1 = Majumdar | first2 = D. N.

==Contributors==
[[Hendrik van Rheede]] is said to have taken a keen personal interest in the compilation of the ''Hortus Malabaricus''. The work was edited by a team of nearly a hundred including:
* The physician [[Itty Achudan|Itti Achuden]] and the Brahmins Ranga Bhat, Vinayaka Pandit and Appu Bhat.
* Professors of medicine and botany
* Amateur botanists, such as Arnold Seyn, [[Theodorus Janssonius van Almeloveen|Theodore Jansson of Almeloveen]], [[Paul Hermann (botanist)|Paul Hermann]], Johannes Munnicks, Joannes Commelinus, Abraham a Poot.
*Technicians, illustrators and engravers, together with the collaboration of [[Dutch East India Company]] officials, and clergymen including D. John Caesarius and the [[Discalced Carmelite]] Mathaeus of St. Joseph’s Monastery at [[Varapuzha]].

Van Rheede was also assisted by the King of Cochin and the ruling [[Zamorin]] of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]]. Prominent among the Indian contributors was the [[Ezhava]] physician [Itty Achudan|Itti Achuden]], a ''Thiyya Vaidyan'' of the Mouton Coast of Malabar whose contribution was examined by three Brahmins named Ranga Bhat, Vinayaka Pandit and Appu Bhat.&lt;ref name="ittiachuden"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Indigenous Knowledge and the Significance of South-West India for Portuguese and Dutch Constructions of Tropical Nature |first=Richard |last=Grove |journal=[[Modern Asian Studies]] | volume = 30 | issue = 1 |date=Feb 1996 | pages = 121–143 |jstor=312903 | doi=10.1017/s0026749x00014104}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ethnomedical]] original information in the work was provided by Itti Achuden and the three Brahmins, working on it for two continuous years morning and evening. Their certificate to this effect is given in the first volume of the book. A grand memorial to them is erected in Kochi.

Professor [[K. S. Manilal]] (b. 1938) has worked over 35 years on the research, translations, and annotations of the ''Hortus Malabaricus''. The effort has brought the main contents of the book to Malayalam and English-speaking scholars. It had largely remained inaccessible previously to them, because of the entire text being untranslated into the [[English language]] and [[Malayalam language]].&lt;ref name="firstwrd"&gt;{{cite web

'''''If I Did It''''', retitled '''''If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer''''' in later issues, is a book by [[ghostwriter]] [[Pablo Fenjves]] and by [[O. J. Simpson]], in which Simpson puts forth a "hypothetical" description of the murders of [[Nicole Brown Simpson]] and [[Ronald Goldman]]. Simpson's former manager, Norman Pardo, claimed that Simpson was not involved in writing the book, but rather accepted, against Pardo's advice, $600,000 from the [[ReganBooks]] and [[News Corporation]] to say he had written it and to conduct an interview.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news| work=Huffington Post|url= http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/5505227|author=Buxton, Ryan|date=June 17, 2014|title=O.J.Simpson's Former Manager Norman Pardo Says O.J.

Simpson Manager: He Didn't Even Write 'If I Did It'!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simpson was acquitted of the murders in a criminal trial ([[O. J. Simpson murder case|''California v. Simpson'']]) but later was found financially liable in a [[O. J. Simpson#Wrongful death civil trial|civil trial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/index/nns0.htm |title=Index of Civil Trial Reports|work= [[USA Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the original release of the book was cancelled shortly after it was announced in November 2006,&lt;ref name="IDidIt"&gt;{{cite book|title=If I Did It|edition=First|publisher=Regan Books/HarperCollins|authors=Simpson, O.J.; Fenjves, Pablo (Ghostwriter); Tobiassen, Kris (Designer)|date=2006|isbn=978-0-06-123828-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 400,000 physical copies of the original book were printed, and by June 2007, copies of it had been leaked online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2007/06/19/oj-did-it-leaked-online/ |title=OJ 'Did It' Manuscript Leaked Online |publisher=TMZ.com |accessdate=January 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was originally due to be published by ReganBooks, an imprint of [[HarperCollins]], which was headed by editor and publisher [[Judith Regan]]. The television network [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], which was a sister to HarperCollins via News Corporation at the time, was to also broadcast an interview special with Simpson to promote the book, entitled ''O. J. Simpson: If I Did It, Here's How It Happened''. However, following objections to the special by several Fox station owners, the special was also canceled. Footage from the interview was aired for the first time during a subsequent Fox special, ''O. J. Simpson: The Lost Confession?'', which aired in March 2018.

In August 2007, a [[Florida]] bankruptcy court awarded the rights to the book to the Goldman family to partially satisfy the civil judgment. The book's title was changed to '''''If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer''''', and this version was published by Beaufort Books, a New York City publishing house owned by parent company Kampmann &amp; Company/[[Midpoint Trade Books]]. Comments were added to the original manuscript by the Goldman family, Fenjves, and journalist [[Dominick Dunne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beaufortbooks.com/books.php?id=53 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20080511155407/http://www.beaufortbooks.com/books.php?id=53 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 11, 2008 |title=If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer |accessdate=January 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new cover design printed the word "If" greatly reduced in size compared with the other words, and placed inside the word "I".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=If I Did It Confessions of the Killer | authors=The Goldman Family (Author), Dominick Dunne (Afterword), Pablo F.

== Authorship ==
Norman Pardo, Simpson's former manager, told ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' that the book was written by a [[ghostwriter]] without Simpson's involvement. Rather, Simpson had accepted, against Pardo's advice, $600,000 from the publisher [[ReganBooks]] and its parent company [[News Corporation]] to say he had written the book and to conduct an associated television interview on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]].&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;  Pardo told the ''Huffington Post'' that Simpson had rationalized:&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Hey, they offered me $600,000 not to dispute that I [wrote] the book." He said, "That's cash." I said, "They're going to think you wrote it." He said, "So? Everybody thinks I'm a murderer anyway. They're not going to change their mind just because of a book."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The book's ghostwriter and [[O.J. Simpson murder case|1995 trial]] witness, [[Pablo Fenjves]], responded to the claim, saying the book is "based on extensive discussions with Simpson."&lt;ref name="Burghart" /&gt;

== Content ==
{{Expand section|date=April 2015}}
The first part of the ''If I Did It'' manuscript details Simpson's early relationship and marriage with [[Nicole Brown Simpson]]. The latter part of the manuscript describes details of the events on June 12, 1994, and about the murders as they could have occurred if Simpson had committed them. However, Simpson's attorney said that there is "only one chapter that deals with their deaths and that chapter, in my understanding, has a disclaimer that it's complete [[fiction]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[File:If I Did It.jpg|thumb|Original first release cover]]
The book was unofficially announced in the ''[[National Enquirer]]'' in late October 2006,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebookstandard.com/bookstandard/news/author/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003286768 No Juice-y Book, Lawyer Says] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202041421/http://www.thebookstandard.com/bookstandard/news/author/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003286768 |date=February 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but this was immediately denied by Simpson's lawyer. The book was then formally announced some weeks later in mid-November 2006 for release on November 30. Intense public criticism led to the cancellation of the book's publication and a related television interview, both from divisions of News Corporation (Fox and [[HarperCollins]], of which ReganBooks was an imprint). According to a ''[[Newsweek]]'' story, all 400,000 printed copies were recalled for "pulping", except for one, locked away in a vault at News Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16610772/site/newsweek/print/1/displaymode/1098/ |title=O.J.

=== Pre-publication controversy ===
''If I Did It'' ignited a storm of pre-publication controversy, largely due to the perception that Simpson was trying to profit from the two deaths for which his [[civil suit]] verdict had found him liable. "This is not about being heard. This is about trying to cash in, in a pathetic way, on some notoriety," said Sara Nelson, editor-in-chief of ''[[Publishers Weekly]]''.&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt; [[Patricia Schroeder]], president and chief executive of the [[Association of American Publishers]], felt that the book would "stir an awful lot of debate and make the culture take a real look at itself, and that may not be unhealthy".&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt;

Denise Brown, sister of murder victim Nicole Brown Simpson, expressed her hope that the publisher would take "full accountability for promoting the wrongdoing of criminals and leveraging this forum and the actions of Simpson to commercialize abuse."&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt; She went on to say that Simpson's two children would be "exposed to [his] inexplicable behavior and we will provide them with our love and support during this time. It's unfortunate that [O.J.] Simpson has decided to awaken a nightmare that we have painfully endured and worked so hard to move beyond." The proposed book also outraged the family of [[Ron Goldman]], who criticized the publisher for "helping a murderer get his voice out there."&lt;ref name="Daily"&gt;{{cite news

Fred Goldman, Ron's father, was awarded $33.5 million by a jury in 1997 for the [[wrongful death]] of his son. However, Simpson never paid this judgment due to a [[California]] law that prevents [[pension]]s from being used to satisfy judgments, and the fact that the bulk of his income comes from his [[National Football League|NFL]] pension. Goldman described the book and television interview as "an all-time low" and "morally reprehensible to me ... to think you are willing to give somebody airtime about how they would murder two people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=== Fox television interview ===
Fox, a U.S. television network that was a sister to HarperCollins via News Corporation at the time, was to air a related, two-part, taped interview with Simpson, conducted by Regan, in which Simpson describes how he would have committed the 1994 slayings of Nicole and Goldman, "if he were the one responsible". The interview was scheduled to air on November 27 and November 29, 2006, timed to coincide with the book's release. The program was being produced under Fox's alternative programming department, headed by [[Mike Darnell]], and not under the auspices of [[Fox News Channel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

"The men who lied and cheated and beat me – they were all there in the room," she said. "And the people who denied it, they were there, too.

On November 21, 2006, Denise Brown accused Fox of trying to stop the Goldman and Brown families from criticizing the project by offering millions of dollars for their silence surrounding the project: "They wanted to offer us millions of dollars. Millions of dollars for, like, 'Oh, I'm sorry' money. But they were still going to air the show," Brown said. "We just thought, 'Oh my God.' What they're trying to do is trying to keep us quiet, trying to make this like hush money, trying to go around the civil verdict, giving us this money to keep our mouths shut."&lt;ref name="Post1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/21/AR2006112100316.html |title=O.J.

Due to the change in phrasing, these comments were interpreted by many as being a form of [[confession]], which stirred strong reactions in print media and the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = OJ Simpson lost interview | url = https://www.9news.com.au/world/2018/03/12/16/18/oj-simpson-lost-confession-2006-interview-video | publisher = 9News | date = 12 March 2018 | accessdate = March 12, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Snierson |first1=Dan |title=O.J.

== Republication ==
On August 14, 2007, it was reported that a literary agent for the Goldman family, Sharlene Martin, had made a deal to publish the book with the new subtitle "Confessions of the Killer".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/books/08/14/simpsonbook.ap/index.html "O.J. Simpson's 'If I Did It' to be published."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814193254/http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/books/08/14/simpsonbook.ap/index.html |date=2007-08-14 }} CNN, 2007-08-14. Retrieved on 2007-08-14.&lt;/ref&gt; All of the original text was to remain intact, with the addition of "key commentary." This version of the book was released about a month later, on September 13, 2007. Some of the proceeds benefit the Ronald Lyle Goldman Justice Foundation, which was planned in 1995 to fund civil legal action against Simpson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tech.mit.edu/V115/N48/nb2.48w.html Goldman Family Moves Towards Civil Suit against Simpson."] ''The Tech Online Edition'', 1995-10-13. Retrieved on 2007-08-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2007, a Canadian publisher, Barclay Road Inc., expressed interest in publishing the book. Barclay Road CEO Herbert Becker said that public opinion turned against the book without anybody's really knowing its contents. He said his company would look into obtaining the rights to the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=CBC Arts |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2007/02/07/simpson-montreal-pub.html |title=Barclay Road Inc., Montreal-based Publisher looks to publish If I did It |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=February 7, 2007 |accessdate=January 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transfer of rights ===
In June 2007, a federal judge ruled that Fred Goldman, Ron Goldman's father, could pursue the publishing rights to Simpson's book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.cnn.com/2007/LAW/06/15/oj.book/index.html |title=Victim's dad can seek rights to O.J.

=== Lawsuits ===
Fred Goldman sued Lorraine Brooke Associates, a [[shell corporation]], for the publishing rights after it filed for bankruptcy. After Goldman purchased the rights from the court-appointed bankruptcy trustee,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

{{History of Fiji}}

The '''Instruments of Independence''' is a legal document that established [[Fiji]]'s independence from the [[United Kingdom]] in 1970, when it was handed over by [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] on behalf of the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British Monarch]] on 10 October.

The document is currently missing. The [[Prime Minister of Fiji|Prime Minister]]'s Office is unsure whether they hold the document, and [[Fiji Museum]] Director [[Sagale Buadromo]] told the [[Fiji Live]] news service on 26 January 2006 that it was not and had never been in their possession.

Government Archivist [[Setareki Tale]] said it was possible that the then-[[Governor-General of Fiji|Governor-General]], [[Sir]] [[Robert Sidney Foster]], had returned the document to the [[United Kingdom]] - but that was only conjecture. The British [[High Commission]] might be asked to help in the search for the document, government sources said.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2400">The '''International Protein Index''' ('''IPI''') is a defunct [[protein]] [[database]] launched in 2001 by the [[European Bioinformatics Institute]] (EBI), and closed in 2011. Its purpose was to provide the [[proteomics]] community with a resource that enables
* [[Accession number (bioinformatics)|accession numbers]] from a variety of [[bioinformatics]] databases to be mapped
* a complete set of proteins for a species i.e. a reference set

In its last version, the IPI contained the complete reference sets for six animal species: ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' (human), ''[[Mus musculus]]'' (mouse), ''[[Rattus norvegicus]]'' (rat), ''[[Bos taurus]]'' (cattle), ''[[Gallus gallus]]'' (chicken) and ''[[Danio rerio]]'' (zebrafish); and one plant species: ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' (thale cress). The human, mouse and rat datasets were the first to be developed, combining information taken from the [[Swiss-Prot]], [[TrEMBL]], [[Ensembl]] and [[RefSeq]] databases.&lt;ref name="IPIref"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kersey PJ, Duarte J, Williams A, Karavidopoulou Y, Birney E, Apweiler R |title=The International Protein Index: an integrated database for proteomics experiments |journal=[[Proteomics (journal)|Proteomics]] |volume=4 |issue=7 |pages=1985–8 |date=July 2004 |pmid=15221759 |doi=10.1002/pmic.200300721 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2001, when the IPI was launched, databases cataloguing human genes varied greatly and had few links between them. Since then, much more data has been produced giving a more complete picture and databases have collaborated to synchronize data. Currently many model organisms have a reference set of genes/proteins which are catalogued in [[Ensembl]]/[[UniProt]] respectively, as well as other species specific databases. Because of this redundancy, the IPI was retired in 2011. EBI advised users of its services to employ [https://www.uniprot.org UniProtKB] accession numbers as their protein identifiers.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Kim Ung-yong was born on March 8, 1962 in [[Seoul]], South Korea. His father was a physics professor and his mother was a medical professor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By the time he was one year old, Kim had learned both the [[Hangul|Korean alphabet]] and 1,000 [[Chinese characters|Chinese character]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s by studying the ''[[Thousand Character Classic]]'', a [[6th-century]] Chinese poem.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sporbiz.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=40824|title=김웅용 교수 누구? ‘천재소년’ 8세때 NASA 스카우트|last=Yoon|first=Sa-rang|date=2016-08-04|work=Korea Sports Economy|access-date=2018-01-10|language=ko|trans-title=Who is Professor Kim Ung-yong? 'Genius boy' recruited by NASA at age 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; At three years old, he was able to solve [[calculus]] problems, and he also published a best-selling book of his essays in [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]], as well as his [[calligraphy]] and illustrations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By the age of five, Kim could speak Korean, English, [[French language|French]], German and [[Japanese language|Japanese]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; That year, he enrolled at [[Grant High School (Los Angeles)|Grant High School]] in [[Los Angeles]] after an article was published about him in ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' magazine that caught the attention of the school.&lt;ref name="WashPost1967"&gt;{{cite news|url=|title=Korean genius, 4, poses problem for high school|last=|first=|date=1967-04-10|newspaper=The Washington Post|access-date=|agency=Associated Press|page=B5: 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also audited a [[physics]] class at [[Hanyang University]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Fuji TV appearance ===
At the age of five, Kim appeared on [[Fuji Television]] in [[Japan]] and shocked the audience by solving [[Differential equation|differential equations]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He appeared on Japanese television again on November 5, when he solved complicated differential and integral calculus problems.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

=== NASA and education ===
When he was eight years old, Kim went to study nuclear physics at the [[University of Colorado]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After graduating with a [[master's degree]], he went to work for [[NASA]], where he worked for ten years. In 2010, Kim said of his years at NASA, "At that time, I led my life like a machine―I woke up, solved the daily assigned equation, ate, slept, and so forth. I really didn't know what I was doing, and I was lonely and had no friends."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20101006000616|title=‘Record IQ is just another talent’|last=Hwang|first=Jurie|date=2010-10-06|work=The Korea Herald|access-date=2018-01-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon returning to South Korea, Kim was required to formally complete South Korean schooling in order to get a job. He earned his elementary, middle, and high school degrees in just two years.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He later enrolled in [[Chungbuk National University]] where he studied [[civil engineering]] and earned a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Adulthood===
{{As of|2007}}, he served as adjunct faculty at [[Chungbuk National University]]. On March 14, 2014, he became associate professor in Shinhan University, and became vice president of North Kyeong-gi Development Research Center.

In 2010, Kim criticized the idea that he is a "failed genius" and additionally said, "Some think people with a high IQ can be omnipotent, but that's not true. Look at me, I don't have musical talent, nor am I excelling in sports. [...] Society should not judge anyone with unilateral standards – everyone has different learning levels, hopes, talents, and dreams and we should respect that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1045559|title=Intelligence quotient: The world’s smartest people|last=Hussaini|first=Ambreen Shehzad|newspaper=Dawn|date=September 28, 2013|accessdate=September 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2010/10/10/life-in-the-high-iq-lane/|title=Life in the high IQ lane|last=Jurie|first=Hwang|newspaper=The Star|date=October 10, 2010|accessdate=September 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== IQ ==
At age four, Kim scored over 200 on an [[IQ test]] normally given to seven-year-olds.&lt;ref name="WashPost1967" /&gt;{{Dubious |Contemporary IQ tests were not validated for such high scores |reason=The standard scoring tables of the Stanford-Binet IQ test and Wechsler test at that time did not go up to IQ scores that high, so let's discuss on talk page |date=November 2013}}

The '''Korherr Report''' is a 16-page document on the progress of [[the Holocaust]] in German-controlled Europe. It was delivered to [[Heinrich Himmler]] in January 1943 by the chief inspector of the statistical bureau of the ''[[SS]]'' and professional statistician Dr [[Richard Korherr]] under the title ''die Endlösung der Judenfrage'', in English the ''[[Final solution|Final Solution to the Jewish Question]]''.&lt;ref name=Korherr&gt;Richard Korherr, [http://www.ns-archiv.de/verfolgung/korherr/faksimile-lang/ '' DIE ENDLÖSUNG DER EUROPÄISCHEN JUDENFRAGE''], Der Inspekteur für Statistik beim Reichsführer SS, Berlin, 1943. NS-Archiv.de in German.&lt;/ref&gt; Korherr, commissioned by Himmler calculated that, from 1937 to December 1942, the number of Jews in Europe had fallen by 4&amp;nbsp;million. Between October 1939 and December 31, 1942 (see, page 9 of the Report), 1.274&amp;nbsp;million Jews had been "processed" at the camps of [[General Government]] and 145,000 at the camps in ''[[Warthegau]]'' (location of [[Kulmhof]]).

The decrease of Soviet Russian Jews from the territories overrun in [[Operation Barbarossa]] was not included due to lack of statistical data. The summaries came from the [[RSHA]] office receiving all ''SS'' reports about the so-called "already evacuated" Jews. Their "special treatment" was removed from the document on the request of Himmler who intended to share it with Hitler, and replaced by Korherr with "processed".&lt;ref name="holocaustresearch"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/holoprelude/korherr.html |title=The Richard Korherr Report |publisher=Holocaust Education &amp; Archive Research Team |work=Holocaust Research Project.org |year=2009 |accessdate=16 March 2014 |author=Chris Webb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance ==
The initial report, sixteen pages long, was submitted on March 23, 1943. On Himmler's request an abridged version, six-and-a-half pages long, was updated to March 31, 1943.&lt;ref name="Friedl"&gt;{{cite book |title=Nazi Germany and the Jews: The Years of Extermination, 1939-1945 |first=Saul |last=Friedländer |author-link=Saul Friedländer |chapter=Chapter 7: March 1943 – October 1943 |page=9 |url=https://erenow.com/ww/nazi-germany-and-the-jews/9.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full report summarized how many [[Jews]] remained in Germany, Austria and Europe; detailed the numbers of Jews detained in the [[Nazi concentration camps]]; how many Jews had died natural deaths since 1933; and how many Jews had been evacuated to the eastern territories.&lt;ref name=Korherr/&gt;
[[Himmler]] accepted the full report on a confidential basis, but for the abridged estimate, made Korherr change the word "''[[Sonderbehandlung]]''" or "special treatment," to the word "''durchgeschleust''" or "processed."&lt;ref name=Himmler&gt;Richard Korherr, [http://www.ns-archiv.de/verfolgung/korherr/anweisung-himmler.php ''Anweisung Himmler an Korherr''], Der Reichsführer-SS, Feld-Kommandostelle 10.4.1943&lt;/ref&gt; The report calculated that, from 1937 to December 1942, the number of Jews in Europe had fallen by 4 million.&lt;ref name=Korherr/&gt;

Korherr ascribed this fall to "emigration, partially due to the excess mortality of the Jews in Central and Western Europe, partially due to the evacuations especially in the more strongly populated Eastern Territories, which are here counted as ongoing."&lt;ref name=Korherr/&gt;

By way of explanation, Korherr added that 

&lt;blockquote&gt;It must not be overlooked in this respect that of the deaths of Soviet Russian Jews in the occupied Eastern territories only a part was recorded, whereas deaths in the rest of European Russia and at the front are not included at all. In addition there are movements of Jews inside Russia to the Asian part which are unknown to us. The movement of Jews from the European countries outside the German influence is also of a largely unknown order of magnitude. On the whole European Jewry should since 1933, i.e. in the first decade of National Socialist German power, have lost almost half of its population.&lt;ref name=Korherr/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Post-war==
Korherr denied all knowledge of the Holocaust, saying that he had "only heard about exterminations after the collapse in 1945."&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Klee,  '' Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich,.'' Aktualisierte Ausgabe Frankfurt/M 2005, S. 331.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter he sent to the German magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' in July 1977, Korherr said that he had not written the report on Himmler's order"&lt;ref name=Spiegel1977&gt;Der Spiegel,  ''Der SPIEGEL'', Nr. 31, 25. Juli 1977, S. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the 

&lt;blockquote&gt;statement that I had mentioned that over a million Jews had died in the camps of the [[General Government|Generalgouvernement]] and the [[Warthegau]] through special treatment is also inaccurate. I must protest against the word 'died' in this context.  It was the very word '[[Sonderbehandlung]]' ['special treatment'] that led me to call the RSHA by phone and ask what this word meant. I was given the answer that these were Jews who were settled in the [[Lublin Reservat|Lublin district]].&lt;ref name=Spiegel1977/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Kulturkampf''''' ({{IPA-de|kʊlˈtuːɐ̯kampf|lang|De-Kulturkampf.ogg}}, "culture struggle") is a German term referring to the conflict
between the German imperial government and the Roman Catholic Church from about 1872 to 1886, predominantly over the control of educational and ecclesiastical appointments.&lt;ref&gt;Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language, 1989, "Kulturkampf" p. 796.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia Britannica: ''Kulturkampf, (German: "culture struggle"), the bitter struggle (c. 1871–87) on the part of the German chancellor Otto von Bismarck to subject the Roman Catholic church to state controls''.&lt;/ref&gt; More rarely, the term is used by extension to refer to the power struggles between emerging constitutional democratic nation states and the [[Roman Catholic Church]] over the place and role of religion in modern polity, usually in connection with [[secularization]] campaigns.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The term Kulturkampf entered many languages, e.g.: French: le Kulturkampf, Spanish: el Kulturkampf, Italian: il Kulturkampf.&lt;ref&gt;Dittrich, Lisa in: Antiklerikalismuns in Europa: Öffentlichkeit und Säkularisierung in Frankreich, Spanien und Deutschland (1848–1914), Vandenhoek &amp; Ruprecht, Göttingen, 1914, {{ISBN|9783525310236}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It first appeared c. 1840 in an anonymous review of a publication by Swiss-German liberal Ludwig Snell on "The Importance of the Struggle of Liberal Catholic Switzerland with the Roman Curia". But it only gained wider currency after liberal member of the Prussian parliament, [[Rudolph Virchow]], used it in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;Ruppert, Stefan in: Kirchenkampf und Kulturkampf: Historische Legitimation, politische Mitwirkung und wissenschaftliche Begleitung durch die Schule Emil Ludwig Richter, Mohr Siebeck, Tübingen, 2002, {{ISBN|978-3-16-147868-0}}, p. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Borutta 2011, p. 11"&gt;Borutta, Manuel in: Antikatholizismus. Deutschland und Italien im Zeitalter der europäischen Kulturkämpfe, Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, Göttingen, 2011, p. 11, {{ISBN|978-3-525-36849-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary socio-political discussion, the term Kulturkampf (see also [[culture war]]) is often used to describe any conflict between secular and religious authorities or deeply opposing values, beliefs between sizable factions within a nation, community, or other group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/american/kulturkampf |title=Kulturkampf – Definition, meaning &amp; more – Collins Dictionary |accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Under the influence of ascending new philosophies and ideologies such as the [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]], [[Scientific realism|realism]], [[positivism]], [[materialism]], [[nationalism]], [[secularism]] and [[liberalism]], the role of religion in society and the relationship between society and church underwent profound changes in the 18th and 19th centuries. Many countries endeavoured to strip the church of worldly powers, reduce the duties of the church to spiritual affairs by secularising the public sphere and by [[separation of church and state]] and to assert the supremacy of the state, especially in education.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Clark, ''Iron Kingdom'' (2006) pp 412-19&lt;/ref&gt; Róisín Healy argues that across Europe, the Kulturkampf operated mainly on state-level and was found "especially in strongholds of liberalism, anti-clericalism, and anti-Catholicism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Róisín Healy |title=The Jesuit Specter in Imperial Germany |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=om6MiDM8sNQC&amp;pg=PA57 |year=2003 |publisher=BRILL |page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:IX. Piusz pápa.jpg|thumb|200px|Pope Pius IX (ca. 1878)]]

The Catholic Church resisted this development which it portrayed as an attack on religion and sought to maintain and even strengthen its strong role in state and society.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Atkin and Frank Tallett, ''Priests, Prelates and People: A History of European Catholicism since 1750'' (Oxford UP, 2003) pp 128, 193&lt;/ref&gt;
With the growing influence of enlightenment and after having lost much of its wealth, power and influence in the [[mediatisation]] and [[secularization]] of the early 19th century the church had been in a state of decline.&lt;ref&gt;Franz, Georg in: Kulturkampf. Staat und katholische Kirche in Mitteleuropa von der Säkularisation bis zum Abschluss des preußischen Kulturkampfes, Munich 1954, ASIN: B0027NO7I4 , p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Keith in: The Dynamics of Political Reform in Northern Europe 1780–1920, Political and Legal Perspectives, Leuven University Press, {{ISBN|9789058678256}}, p.154&lt;/ref&gt;
The papacy at this time was at a weak point in its history, having just lost all its territories to Italy, with the pope a [[prisoner in the Vatican|"prisoner" in the Vatican]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Roland Sarti |title=Italy: A Reference Guide from the Renaissance to the Present |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xhoLorFC1iwC&amp;pg=PA462 |year=2009 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |page=462}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The church strove to revert its waning influence and to keep sway in such matters as e. g. marriage, family and education and initiated a Catholic revival by founding associations, papers, schools, social establishments or new orders and encouraging religious practices such as [[pilgrimage]]s, mass assemblies, the devotion of [[Marian devotions|Virgin Mary]] or the sacred heart of Jesus and the veneration of [[relic]]s;&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Frances in : History of the Christian Church, Vol. 6: The Church in the 19th. Century, I.B.Tauris, London, 2008, {{ISBN|9781850438991}}&lt;/ref&gt; the pope himself became an object of devotion.&lt;ref&gt;Dittrich, Lisa in: Antiklerikalismuns in Europa: Öffentlichkeit und Säkularisierung in Frankreich, Spanien und Deutschland (1848–1914), Vandenhoek &amp; Ruprecht, Göttingen, 1914, {{ISBN|9783525310236}}, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the extraordinary proliferation of religious orders, the 19th. century also witnessed the rise of countless Catholic associations and organisations, especially in Germany and in France.&lt;ref name="Dittrich 1914 p. 55"&gt;Dittrich, Lisa in: Antiklerikalismuns in Europa: Öffentlichkeit und Säkularisierung in Frankreich, Spanien und Deutschland (1848–1914), Vandenhoek &amp; Ruprecht, Göttingen, 1914, {{ISBN|9783525310236}}, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Catholic [[propaganda]] including the interpretation of daily events was spread through local and national Catholic newspapers prominent in all western European nations as well as through organized missions and groups dedicated to pious literature.&lt;ref&gt;Ruppert, Stefan in: Kirchenkampf und Kulturkampf: Historische Legitimation, politische Mitwirkung und wissenschaftliche Begleitung durch die Schule Emil Ludwig Richter, Mohr Siebeck, Tübingen, 2002, {{ISBN|978-3-16-147868-0}}, p.6-8&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th. century, the Catholic Church promulgated a series of contentious [[dogma]]s and [[encyclical]]s: In

* 1832, in the [[encyclical]] [[Mirari vos]], Pope [[Gregory XVI]] condemned liberalism, [[freedom of the press|free press]] and [[free thought]].

Under the leadership of his successor, Pope [[Pius IX]], in

* 1854, the church proclaimed Mary's [[immaculate conception]]. In
* 1864, the Vatican published the encyclical [[Quanta cura]] and [[Syllabus of Errors]]; in
* 1870, the [[First Vatican Council]] declared the [[dogma]] of [[Papal infallibility]].

With its "Syllabus of Errors" of 1864, the Catholic Church launched an assault on the new ideologies condemning 80 philosophical and political statements, mainly the foundations of the modern nation state, as false. It outright rejected such concepts as [[freedom of religion]], [[free thought]], [[separation of church and state]], [[civil marriage]], [[Popular sovereignty|sovereignty of the people]], [[democracy]], [[liberalism]] and [[socialism]], [[reason]] as the sole base of human action and in general condemned the idea of conciliation with [[progress (history)|progress]]. The announcements included an index of forbidden books.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Atkin, and Frank Tallett. ''Priests, Prelates and People: A History of European Catholicism, 1750 to the Present'' (2003). pp 104-6&lt;/ref&gt;

A profound change was the gradual reorganization of the Catholic Church and its expansive use of the media. The popes worked to increase their control of the Church. Heavily criticized by European governments, it was centralized and streamlined with a strict hierarchy, the bishops sought direction from the Vatican and the needs and views of the international church were given priority over the local ones. Opponents of the new hierarchical church organization pejoratively called it [[ultramontanism]].&lt;ref&gt;Healy, Roisin in: The Jesuit Spectre in Imperial Germany, Brill Academic Publishers, Boston, 2003, {{ISBN|0391041940}}, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Grew, Raymond in: "Liberty and the Catholic Church in 19th. century Europe", Freedom and Religion in the 19th. Century, edited by Richard Helmstadter, Stanford University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|9780804730877}}, p. 198-200&lt;/ref&gt;

In view of the church's opposition to enlightenment, liberal reforms and the revolutions of the 18th/19th centuries, these dogmas and the church's expressed insistence on [[papal primacy]] angered the liberal-minded all across Europe, even among some Catholics, adding fuel to the heated debates.&lt;ref name="Robbins 1920, p. 178" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dittrich, Lisa in: Antiklerikalismuns in Europa: Öffentlichkeit und Säkularisierung in Frankreich, Spanien und Deutschland (1848–1914), Vandenhoek &amp; Ruprecht, Göttingen, 1914, {{ISBN|9783525310236}}, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;

The dogmas represented a threat to the secularized state as they reaffirmend that the fundamental allegiance of Catholics was not to their nation-state, but to the Gospel and the Church and that the pope's teaching was absolutely authoritative and binding on all the faithful. Secular politicians even wondered whether "Catholicism and allegiance to the modern liberal state were not mutually exclusive". British Prime Minister [[William Gladstone|Gladstone]] wrote in 1874 that the teaching on papal infallibility compromised the allegiance of faithful English Catholics. For European liberalism, the dogmas were a declaration of war against the modern state, science and spiritual freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Bucheim, Karl in: Geschichte der christlichen Parteien in Deutschland. Kösel, Munich, 1953, ASIN B0000BGX87, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="unamsanctamcatholicam.com" /&gt;

The pope's handling of dissent of the dogmas, e. g. by excommunication of critics or demanding their removal from schools and universities, was considered as  "epitome of papal authoritarianism".&lt;ref&gt;Healy, Roisin in: ''The Jesuit Spectre'' in Imperial Germany, Brill Academic Publishers, Boston, 2003, {{ISBN|0391041940}}, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;
In direct response to the Vatican's announcements, Austria passed the so-called May-Laws for [[Cisleithania]] in 1868, restricting the Concordat of 1855, and then cancelled the concordat altogether in 1870.
Saxony and Bavaria withheld approval to publish the papal infallibility; Hesse and Baden even denied any legal validity. France refused to publish the doctrines altogether; Spain forbade publication of Syllabus of Errors in 1864.&lt;ref&gt;Dittrich, Lisa in: Antiklerikalismuns in Europa: Öffentlichkeit und Säkularisierung in Frankreich, Spanien und Deutschland (1848–1914), Vandenhoek &amp; Ruprecht, Göttingen, 1914, {{ISBN|9783525310236}}, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kulturkampf in Germany ==

=== Background ===
[[File:094 leuchtkugeln nr 12.jpg|thumb|300 px|Anti-Catholic caricature in the Munich ''Leuchtkugeln'', 1848. A warning not to rejoice yet. The Catholic cleric as a fox and blind passenger on the wagon of progress, in order to later reverse the course of history.]]
By the mid-nineteenth century, liberal policies had also come to dominate Germany and the separation of church and state became a prominent issue.&lt;ref&gt;Pflanze, Otto, in: Bismarck and the Development of Germany, Volume II, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|0-691-05587-4}}, p 199-200&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iván T. Berend in: An Economic History of 19th-century Europe, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-1-107-03070-1}}, p 93&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kulturkampf in Germany is usually framed by the years 1871 and 1878 with the Catholic Church officially announcing its end in 1880 but the struggle in Germany had been an ongoing matter without definite beginning and the years 1871 to 1878 only mark its culmination in Prussia and Germany. In the wake of other European countries, most German states had taken first steps of secularisation well before unification. Predominantly Catholic Baden was at the forefront curbing the power of the Catholic Church (1852–1854 Baden Church Dispute) and (1864–1876 Kulturkampf Baden, see [[:de:Badischer Kulturkampf]]).&lt;ref name="Healy 2003, p. 57"&gt;Healy, Roisin in: The Jesuit Spectre in Imperial Germany, Brill Academic Publishers, Boston, 2003, {{ISBN|0391041940}}, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de Gruyter, Walter in: Theologische Realenzykolpädie, Vol. 1, Berlin-New York, 1993, p. 101, {{ISBN|3-11 013898-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples are Prussia (1830s, 1850, 1859 and 1969), Württemberg (1859/1862), Bavaria (1867, see [[:de:Bayerischer Kulturkampf]]), Hesse-Nassau or Hesse-Darmstadt.

In the 1837 Kölner Wirren ([[Cologne Confusion]]; [[:de:Kölner Wirren|article in German]]) of legal and policy issues regarding the children of mixed Protestant-Catholic marriages,&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, Michael in: From Reich to State. The Rhineland in the Revolutionary Age, Cambridge University Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-521-82443-5}}, p. 248-249&lt;/ref&gt; Prussia's final settlement was considered a defeat for the state as it had given in to demands of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;Ruppert, Stefan in: Kirchenkampf und Kulturkampf: Historische Legitimation, politische Mitwirkung und wissenschaftliche Begleitung durch die Schule Emil Ludwig Richter, Mohr Siebeck, Tübingen, 2002, {{ISBN|978-3-16-147868-0}}, p.13&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1850, Prussia again had a dispute with the church about civil marriage and primary schools&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Keith in: The Dynamics of Political Reform in Northern Europe 1780–1920, Political and Legal Perspectives, Leuven University Press, {{ISBN|9789058678256}}, p.150-175&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1852, it issued decrees against the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]].
As in many European countries, Jesuits were being banned or heavily restricted in many of the German states e. g. in Saxony (1831) and even in Catholic ones such as Bavaria (1851), Baden (1860) or Württemberg (1862).&lt;ref&gt;Healy, Roisin in: The Jesuit Spectre in Imperial Germany, Brill Academic Publishers, Boston, 2003, {{ISBN|0391041940}}, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

Not to be left out, the German areas to the [[Left Bank of the Rhine|west of the Rhine]] had already gone through a process of separation of church and state in line with a radical secularization after annexation by revolutionary and Napoleonic France in 1794. After their return to Germany in 1814, many if not most of the changes were kept in place.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, Michael in: From Reich to State. The Rhineland in the Revolutionary Age, Cambridge University Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-521-82443-5}}, p. 259-264&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Vormärz]]-years, Catholic publications usually portrayed revolutions as negative and dangerous to the existing order as well as to the interests of the Catholic Church. Most of them considered a viable Catholicism to be necessary for the very health of society and state and to be the only true and effective protection against the scourge of revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, Bernhard in: Katholiken auf die Barrikaden? Europäische Revolutionen und deutsche katholische Presse 1815–1848, Reihe B: Forschungen, Vol. 84., Ferdinand Schöningh, Paderborn, 1998, {{ISBN|978-3-506-79989-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The unsuccessful [[German revolutions of 1848–49]], which the Catholic Church had opposed, produced no democratic reforms and attempts to radically disentangle state-church relationships failed.  In the [[Frankfurt Parliament|revolutionary parliament]], many prominent representatives of political Catholicism took the side of the extreme right-wingers. In the years following the revolution, Catholicism became increasingly politicised due to the massive anti-modernist and anti-liberal policies of the Vatican.

In the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866 and [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870 the Catholic Church sided against Prussia and it was an outspoken opponent of German unification under Prussia (as well as of Italy's unification).

The Catholic dogmas and doctrines announced in 1854, 1864 and 1870 were perceived in Germany as direct attacks on the modern nation state.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Keith in: ''The Dynamics of Political Reform in Northern Europe 1780–1920, Political and Legal Perspectives,'' Leuven University Press, {{ISBN|9789058678256}}, p.158-161&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Bismarck, the [[National Liberal Party (Germany)|Liberals]] and the [[Free Conservative Party|Conservatives]] representing orthodox Protestants found the Centre Party's support of the pope highly provocative. Many Catholics shared these sentiments, especially against the pope's declared infallibility and the majority of Catholic German bishops deemed the definition of the dogma as "'unpropitious' in light of the situation in Germany". While most Catholics eventually reconciled themselves to the doctrine, some founded the small breakaway [[Old Catholic Church]]. 

According to the Bavarian head of government, [[Chlodwig, Prince of Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst|Hohenlohe]], the dogma of infallibility compromised the Catholic's loyalty to the state.&lt;ref&gt;Healy, Roisin in: ''The Jesuit Spectre in Imperial Germany,'' Brill Academic Publishers, Boston, 2003, {{ISBN|0391041940}}, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; He sent a circular to all the diplomatic representatives of the Bavarian Kingdom saying, "The only dogmatic thesis which Rome desires to have decided by the Council, and which the Jesuits in Italy and Germany are now agitating, is the question of the Infallibility of the Pope. This pretension once become a dogma, will have a wider scope than the purely spiritual spheres, and will become evidently a political question: for it will raise the power of the Sovereign Pontiff, even in temporal matters, above all the princes and peoples of Christendom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Life of His Holiness Pope Leo XIII: Vicar of Jesus Christ and Bishop of Rome|author=Richard Henry Clarke|year=1903|publisher=P.W.

The liberal majorities in the Imperial Diet and the Prussian parliament as well as liberals in general regarded the Church as backward, a hotbed for [[reactionary|reactionaries]], enemies of progress and cast monastic life as the epitome of a backward Catholic medievalism. They were alarmed by the dramatic rise in the numbers of monasteries, convents and clerical religious groups in an era of widespread religious revival. The Diocese of Cologne, for example, saw a tenfold increase of monks and nuns between 1850 and 1872. Prussian authorities were particularly suspicious of the spread of monastic life among the Polish and French minorities.&lt;ref&gt;Gross, ''The War Against Catholicism'', pp. 128-131, Univ. of Michigan Press 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
The Church, in turn, saw the [[National Liberal Party (Germany)|National-Liberals]] its worst enemy, accusing them of spearheading the war against Christianity and the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;Winkler, Heinrich in: Der lange Weg nach Westen: Deutsche Geschichte vom Ende des Alten ..., Vol 1, Beck Verlag, Munich, 2002, p. 218, {{ISBN|3406460011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At unification in 1871, the new German Empire included 25.5&amp;nbsp;million Protestants (62% of the population) and 15 million Catholics (36.5% of the population). Although a minority in the empire, Catholics were the majority in the states of [[Bavaria]], [[Baden]], and [[Alsace-Lorraine]] as well as in the four Prussian Provinces of [[West Prussia]], [[Province of Posen|Posen]], [[Rhine Province|Rhineland]], [[Westphalia]] and in the Prussian [[Regierungsbezirk|region]] of [[Upper Silesia]]. Since the [[Thirty Years' War]] the population was generally segregated along religious lines and rural areas or towns were overwhelmingly if not entirely of the same religion. Education was also separate and usually in the hands of the churches. There was little mutual tolerance, interaction or intermarriage. Protestants in general were deeply distrustful of the Catholic Church.
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R29818, Otto von Bismarck.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bismarck c. 1875]]
Unification had been achieved through many obstacles with strong opponents. These were the European powers of France and Austria, both Catholic nations, and the Catholic Church itself, the three of which Bismarck perceived as  "Coalition of Catholic Revenge". For Bismarck, the empire was very fragile and its consolidation was an important issue. Biographer Otto Pflanze emphasizes, "Bismarck's belief in the existence of a widespread Catholic conspiracy that posed a threat to both his German and European policies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Otto Pflanze |title=Bismarck and the Development of Germany, Volume II: The Period of Consolidation, 1871–1880 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kT0ABAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA189 |year=1990 |publisher=Princeton UP |page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a Protestant empire, the Catholic Church was to lose its good standing which it had enjoyed for centuries in the Catholic-dominated Holy Roman Empire and which it would have continued to enjoy in a German empire united under Austrian auspices. Thus, in 1870, on the eve of unification, the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Center Party]] was explicitly founded to defend the position of the church in the new empire.

Bismarck was highly concerned that many major members and supporters of this new party were not in sympathy with the new empire: the [[House of Hanover]], the ethnic minority of the Poles, the southern German states. In 1871, the predominantly Catholic states of Southern Germany had only reluctantly joined the empire, increasing the overall share of the Catholic population to 36.5%. Among this Catholic share was Germany's largest ethnic minority, well over 2 million Poles in the east of Prussia, who under Prussia and Germany suffered discrimination and oppression.&lt;ref&gt;''Wielka historia Polski'' t. 4 Polska w czasach walk o niepodległość (1815–1864). Od niewoli do niepodległości (1864–1918) Marian Zagórniak, Józef Buszko 2003 page 186&lt;/ref&gt; Bismarck regarded the new Centre Party not only as an illegal mixup of politics and religion and the church's "long arm" but also as a unifying force for [[Catholic Germans]] and Poles and thus a threat to the consolidation of the empire. He feared that the Centre Party would frustrate his broader political agendas and he accused the Catholic priests of fostering Polish nationalism as had been done openly in the provinces of Posen and Upper Silesia.&lt;ref name="Robbins 1920, p. 178"&gt;Robbins, Keith in: The Dynamics of Political Reform in Northern Europe 1780–1920, Political and Legal Perspectives, Leuven University Press, {{ISBN|9789058678256}}, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pflanze, Otto, in: Bismarck and the Development of Germany, Volume II, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|0-691-05587-4}}, p 199&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arlinghouse, Francis in: The Kulturkampf and European Diplomacy 1871–1875 in The Catholic Historical Review 28/3, 1942, p. 342&lt;/ref&gt;

The Liberals regarded the Catholic Church as a powerful force of reaction and anti-modernity, especially after the proclamation of papal infallibility in 1870 and the tightening control of the Vatican over the local bishops.&lt;ref&gt;Lamberti, (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; The renewed vitality of Catholicism in Germany with its mass gatherings also attracted Protestants – even the heir to the Prussian throne, with the king's approval, attended one.&lt;ref name="books.google"&gt;Gross, Michael B., [https://books.google.com/books?id=fnCzk2fI9Z4C&amp;dq The war against Catholicism: liberalism and the anti-Catholic imagination in nineteenth-century Germany], p. 75, University of Michigan Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
Antiliberalism, anticlericalism and anti-Catholicism became powerful intellectual forces of the time and the antagonism between Liberals and Protestants on one side and the Catholic Church on the other was fought out through mud-slinging in the press. A wave of anti-Catholic, anticlerical and antimonastic pamphleteering in the liberal press&lt;ref name="books.google" /&gt; was answered by antiliberal preaching and propaganda in Catholic newspapers and vice versa.

For these reasons, the government sought to wean the Catholic masses away from the hierarchy and the Centre Party and the liberal's demands to curb the power of the churches meshed well with Bismarck's main political objective to crush the Centre Party.
According to historian Anthony J. Steinhoff, "Bismarck's plan to disarm political Catholicism delighted liberal politicians, who provided the parliamentary backing for the crusade. Yet, the phrase the left-liberal Rudolf Virchow coined for this struggle, the Kulturkampf, suggests that the liberals wanted to do more than prevent Catholicism from becoming a political force. They wanted victory over Catholicism itself, the long-delayed conclusion of the Reformation".&lt;ref name="Anthony J. Steinhoff 2008 p 294"&gt;Anthony J. Steinhoff, "Christianity and the creation of Germany," in Sheridan Gilley and Brian Stanley, eds. ''Cambridge History of Christianity: Volume 8: 1814–1914''  (2008) p 294&lt;/ref&gt;

At least since 1847 and in line with the Liberals, Bismarck had also been of the professed opinion, that state and church should be completely separated and "the sphere of the state had to be made secure against the incursions by the church",&lt;ref&gt;Pflanze, Otto, in: Bismarck and the Development of Germany, Volume II, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|0-691-05587-4}}, p 201&lt;/ref&gt;  although his ideas were not as far-reaching as in the United States or in Great Britain. He had in mind the traditional position of the Protestant church in Prussia and provoked considerable resistance from conservative Protestants. This became clear in a heated debate with Prussian culture minister von Mühler in 1871 when Bismarck said: "Since you stopped my plans in the Protestant church, I have to go via Rome".&lt;ref&gt;Rumschöttel, Prof. Dr. Hermann in: Bismarcks Kulturkampf. Motive und Gegner, Presentation at Sommerakademie St. Bonifaz 2013 –Kulturkampf in Bayern- http://sankt-bonifaz.de/fileadmin/images-bonifaz/redakteur/colloquium/docs/neu-Rumsch%C3%B6ttel_Bismarck-2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1871 at Bad Ems, Bismarck revealed his intention to fight against the Centre Party, to separate state and church, to transfer school inspection to laymen, to abolish religious instruction from schools and to transfer religious affairs to the minister of justice.&lt;ref&gt;Pflanze, Otto, in: Bismarck and the Development of Germany, Volume II, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|0-691-05587-4}}, p 200-201&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 January 1872, liberal [[Adalbert Falk]] replaced conservative Heinrich von Mühler as Prussian minister for religion, education and health. In Bismarck's mind, Falk was "to re-establish the rights of the state in relation to the church". Yet, unlike Bismarck, whose main motivation for the Kulturkampf was the political power struggle with the Centre Party, Falk, a lawyer, was a strong proponent of state authority having in mind the legal aspects of state-church relationships. Falk became the driving force behind the Kulturkampf laws. Although Bismarck publicly supported Falk, he doubted the success of his laws and was unhappy with his lack of political tact and sensitivity. The differences in their attitudes concerning the Kulturkampf eventually put the two politicians at odds with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz15511.html |title=Falk, Adalbert – Deutsche Biographie |first=Deutsche |last=Biographie |accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Adalbert-Falk |title=Adalbert Falk – Prussian official |accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With this background and the determination of church and state, the Kulturkampf in Germany acquired an additional edge as it gathered in intensity and bitterness.

=== Timeline and laws enacted during the Kulturkampf ===
[[File:Kladderadatsch 1875 - Zwischen Berlin und Rom.png|thumb|300px|"Between Berlin and Rome", with Bismarck on the left and the Pope on the right, from the German satirical magazine ''[[Kladderadatsch]]'', 1875. Pope: "Admittedly, the last move was unpleasant for me; but the game still isn't lost. I still have a very beautiful secret move." Bismarck: "That will also be the last one, and then you'll be mated in a few moves – at least in Germany."]]
From 1871 to 1876, the Prussian state parliament and the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|federal legislature (''Reichstag'')]], both with liberal majorities, enacted 22 laws in the context of the Kulturkampf. They were mainly directed against clerics: bishops, priests and religious orders ([[anti-clerical]]) and enforced the supremacy of the state over the church.&lt;ref&gt;Pflanze, Otto, in: Bismarck and the Development of Germany, Volume II, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|0-691-05587-4}}, p 202&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kath.de"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kath.de/kurs/kg/18.htm |title=www.kath.de Kirchengeschichte – Der Kulturkampf |accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While several laws were specific to the Catholic Church (Jesuits, congregations etc.) the general laws affected both Catholic and Protestant churches.
In an attempt to overcome increasing resistance by the Catholic Church and its defiance of the laws, new regulations increasingly went beyond state matters referring to the purely internal affairs of the church. Even many liberals saw them as an encroachment on civil liberties, compromising their own credo.&lt;ref&gt;Pflanze, Otto, in: Bismarck and the Development of Germany, Volume II, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|0-691-05587-4}}, p 206&lt;/ref&gt;

Constitutionally, education and regulation of religious affairs were vested in the federal states and the leading actor of the Kulturkampf was [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], Germany's largest state. But some of the laws were also passed by the Reichstag and applied to all of Germany. In general, the laws did not affect the press and associations including Catholic ones.&lt;ref name="kath.de" /&gt;

The major Kulturkampf laws were:

==== 1871 ====
* 8 June 1871, fusion of Catholic and Protestant sections in the Prussian Ministry of Culture (responsible for religious matters). The Catholic section had been installed in 1840. The reason given for the merger was, that "the exclusively political attitude of equal justice to all" was to be adopted and that for that purpose one ecclesiastical department was required.&lt;ref&gt;Pflanze, Otto, in: Bismarck and the Development of Germany, Volume II, Princeton University Press, 1971, {{ISBN|0-691-05587-4}}, p 200&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The War between Prussia and Rome in: Quarterly Review, John Murray, London, 1874, Vol. 136, p. 311&lt;/ref&gt; The merger was also a precondition for the School Supervision Act of the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Geschichte der CDU (History of the Christian Democratic Party of Germany) in: http://www.kas.de/wf/de/71.8617/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926131524/http://www.kas.de/wf/de/71.8617/ |date=2015-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 10 December 1871, Empire, [[Pulpit Law]] (Kanzelparagraph) passed at the initiative of Bavaria and meant to curb what was considered the misuse of religious sermons for political agitation from the pulpit.&lt;ref name="Robbins 1920, p. 178" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lougee, Robert W., [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3161311 The ''Kulturkampf'' and Historical Positivism], pp. 219–220, Church History, Vol. 23, No. 3, Sep., 1954, Cambridge Univ.&lt;/ref&gt; The law read:&lt;ref&gt;see [http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/sub_document.cfm?document_id=669 text] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703004617/http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/sub_document.cfm?document_id=669 |date=2015-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Thomas Vormbaum |author2=Michael Bohlander |title=A Modern History of German Criminal Law |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8h24BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA133 |year=2013 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any cleric or other minister of religion shall be punished with imprisonment or incarceration of up to two years if he, while exercising his occupation or having his occupation exercised, makes state affairs the subject of announcements or discussion either in public before a crowd, in a church, or before any number of people in some other place designated for religious gatherings in such a way that it endangers the public peace.

==== 1872 ====
* 22 January 1872, [[Adalbert Falk]] became Prussian minister for spiritual, educational and health matters
* 11 March 1872, Prussian [[:de:Schulaufsichtsgesetz|School Supervision Act]]. This legislation was at the heart of the Kulturkampf, abolishing church oversight of the Prussian primary school system (Catholic and Protestant), excluding the clergy from education and eliminating its influence in curricular matters.&lt;ref name="unamsanctamcatholicam.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unamsanctamcatholicam.com/history/79-history/394-kulturkampf.html |title=Understanding the Kulturkampf |last=Boniface |accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a milestone for liberalism, as placing education into the hands of the government had always been at the top of its agenda. It was to ensure an open-minded and neutral education as the prerequisite for a progressive society. In the eyes of Bismarck, this law was necessary after the church, putting itself in opposition to the state, used the schools to incite the young against the government.
* On April 1872, the Vatican rejected Gustav Adolf, [[Gustav Adolf, Cardinal Prince of Hohenlohe-Schillingfürst|Cardinal Prince of Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst]] as German ambassador to the [[Holy See]]. Schillingsfürst had been critical of the infallibility dogma but eventually accepted the decision of the council. Therefore, Bismarck took him for a suitable mediator. In response to the rejection, the diplomatic mission was left vacant and Prussia suspended relations with the Vatican in December 1872.
* 4 July 1872, Empire, [[Jesuits Law (1872)|Jesuit Law]] banning of the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] who were seen as the emissaries of Rome and the spearhead of ultramontanism. By acknowledging the supremacy of Papal authority, the Jesuits were accused of contesting the secular authority. The law allowed for the dissolution of all Jesuit chapters and expulsion of its members. The following year the law was extended to closely related orders: the Redemptorists, Lazarists, Fathers of the Holy Ghost, and the Ladies of the Sacred Heart. Continued and increasing Church resistance and contempt of the 1871/1872 laws led to changes in the constitution and the enactment of further laws. In order to facilitate these laws, the Prussian Constitution was amended.
* 20 September 1872, at a conference in Fulda the Prussian bishops protested against the regulations hostile to the church.
* 23 December 1872, in an address to his cardinals, the pope denounced the new laws as persecution of the church.

==== 1873 ====
[[File:Rudolf Virchow by Hugo Vogel, 1861.JPG|thumb || 150px|Rudolf Virchow, 1861]]
* 17 January 1873, the term "Kulturkampf" came into play. Debating the law on education conditions for the employment of clerics, a [[German Progress Party|Progressive]] deputy in the Prussian legislature – the distinguished medical scientist and pioneer of public health methods, [[Rudolf Virchow]] said: "Ich habe die Überzeugung, es handelt sich hier um einen großen Kulturkampf." (I am of the conviction that this is about a great cultural struggle)&lt;ref name="Catholic Dict"&gt; {{cite book |author= |coauthors= |title=New Catholic Dictionary |year=1910 |editor= |pages= |chapter=Kulturkampf |chapterurl=http://www.catholic-forum.com/SAINTS/ncd04572.htm |publisher= |location= |id= |url=http://www.catholic-forum.com/SAINTS/indexncd.htm |accessdate= |quote=It was the distinguished liberal politician and scientist, Professor Rudolph Virchow, who first called it the Kulturkampf, or struggle for civilization. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825052022/http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/indexncd.htm |archivedate=2013-08-25 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Winkler, Heinrich August in: Der lange Weg nach Westen. Deutsche Geschichte 1806–1933, Munich 2000, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; He repeated this term in a call for a vote by the [[German Progress Party]] on 23 March 1873. It was ironically picked up and derided in the Catholic press and enthusiastically defended in the liberal.&lt;ref&gt;Bachem, Karl in: 'Vorgeschichte, Geschichte und Politik der Deutschen Zentrumspartei, Vol. III, 1927, p. 268–269&lt;/ref&gt;
* 30 January 1873, while the laws were being debated in parliament, the Prussian bishops submit a protest against the planned legislation and in a memorial, they announced their opposition to the new laws.
* 5 April 1873, Prussia, Amendment of Sections 15, 16 and 18 of the Prussian Constitution
:In section 15 the sentence "The Protestant and the Roman Catholic Church, as well as every other religious community, regulates and administers its affairs independently" is supplemented by "but remain subject to the laws of the state and its legally regulated superintendence". It is added, that the same applies to the possession or beneficial use of institutions for religion, teaching, charity, endowments and funds.
:Section 16, regarding the unrestricted dealings of religious communities with their seniors and public announcements according to general regulations was cancelled.
:Section 18 cancelled the state's right to appoint, nominate, elect or confirm clerics for a post. But the amendment added, that the state could regulate the minimum education required for clerical posts, the appointment and dismissal of clergymen and servicemen of religion, and define the limits of ecclesiastical disciplinary measures.
* On 2 May 1873, the bishops issued a common pastoral letter explaining to the faithful the necessity to unanimously and passively resist these laws.
[[File:Ludwig Windthorst 1872 JS.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Ludwig Windthorst]], 1872]]
* '''May Laws'''
:The May Laws (''Maigesetze''), or [[Falk Laws]], were a set of laws passed by the Prussian parliament in the years 1873, 1874 and 1875.

:Four laws passed in 1873 were enacted on 11/12/13/14 May 1873:

:1. Law on [[religious disaffiliation]] allowing a person to sever his connection with the church by simple declaration before a justice of the peace. This declaration freed him from all civil effects of belonging to a church, especially ecclesiastical burthens and dues.

:2. Law on ecclesiastical disciplinary measures restricting the exercise of ecclesiastical punishments and means of discipline directed against the life, property, freedom or honour of citizens. This included the infliction of the great excommunication if proclaimed with the name of the guilty, because of possible disturbances of civil and social intercourse. Thus, disciplinary measures were almost totally restricted to the spiritual realm (see state [[Monopoly on violence]]).

:3. Ecclesiastical disciplinary law concerning ecclesiastical power of discipline and the establishment of The Royal Court of Justice for Ecclesiastical Affairs. This subordinated the Catholic Church to state jurisdiction not only in external but also in internal matters.&lt;ref&gt;Geschichte der CDU in: http://www.kas.de/wf/de/71.8617/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926131524/http://www.kas.de/wf/de/71.8617/ |date=2015-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The law regulated the exercise of disciplinary power by church authorities against their officers for special violation of their duties. Members of the court had to be Germans residing in Germany. Bodily chastisement by the Church was entirely forbidden, fines were limited to maximum amounts, restrictions of freedom could only consist in banishment to a church institution within Germany no longer than 3 months and not against the will of the person concerned. On the other hand, the new court also was given jurisdiction over ecclesiastical officers in violation of state laws.
:With this law, the German clergy was to be exempt from any juridical body outside of the nation. Hence, judgments of the Holy See or the Roman Rota would not be binding upon them. The highest court was made up of Prussian ecclesiastics, all appointed with the permission of Prussian civil authorities. The Church's juridical and punitive powers were restricted by allowing clerics, e. g. those punished by the Church for not resisting the Kulturkampf laws, to appeal to the Royal Court of Justice for Ecclesiastical Affairs. Bishops in defiance of this law could be deposed.

:4. Education standards and civic registry law concerning the education and appointment of priests. Regarding the Protestant Church, these regulations had already been in force for a long time. All men intended for priesthood needed a graduate degree ([[Abitur]]) from a German {{lang|de|gymnasium}} and study 3 years of theology at a German university.
:All appointments of clerics had to be approved by the state. Herewith, training and appointment of the clergy came under state supervision. The traditional regimen of clerical study was to be replaced by a modern education in a liberal German institution, thus ensuring that candidates to the priesthood were imbued with the spirit of secularism. Furthermore, ecclesiastical offices could only be filled with the permission of the highest civil authority in each province, essentially reviving the ancient practice of lay investiture.&lt;ref name="unamsanctamcatholicam.com" /&gt;

* 26 May 1873, the bishops issued another pastoral letter calling on the faithful to resist the new laws and informed the Prussian government that they would not cooperate in their execution. Parish councils declined to elect new pastors or accept parish administrators. Exiled or imprisoned bishops used underground networks. The bishops of Münster and Paderborn refused the Kulturexamen for their seminaries and appointed priests without notifying authorities. Clergy obeying the mandate of the bishops immediately became subject to the punishments prescribed by the laws. Fines were imposed in hundreds of cases and the clerics resisted to pay at which, in turn, the government resorted to force, either by confiscation or imprisonment of up to two years.&lt;ref name="newadvent.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08703b.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Kulturkampf |accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 21 November 1873, in his encyclical [[Etsi multa]] on the persecution of the Church in Italy, Germany, and Switzerland, the pope wrote of Germany "No wonder, then, that the former religious tranquility has been gravely disturbed in that Empire by this kind of law and other plans and actions of the Prussian government most hostile to the Church. But who would wish to falsely cast the blame of this disturbance on the Catholics of the German Empire!"&lt;ref name="Robbins 1920, p. 180"&gt;Robbins, Keith in: The Dynamics of Political Reform in Northern Europe 1780–1920, Political and Legal Perspectives, Leuven University Press, {{ISBN|9789058678256}}, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that [[Anticlericalism and Freemasonry|Freemasonry]] was the motivating force behind the ''Kulturkampf''.&lt;ref name="synagogue"&gt;"Some of you may perchance wonder that the war against the Catholic Church extends so widely. Indeed each of you knows well the nature, zeal, and intention of sects, whether called Masonic or some other name. When he compares them with the nature, purpose, and amplitude of the conflict waged nearly everywhere against the Church, he cannot doubt but that the present calamity must be attributed to their deceits and machinations for the most part. For from these the synagogue of Satan is formed which draws up its forces, advances its standards, and joins battle against the Church of Christ." Para 28, [http://www.ewtn.com/library/encyc/p9etsimu.htm Etsi Multa] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060403171135/http://ewtn.com/library/ENCYC/P9ETSIMU.HTM |date=2006-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1874 ====
* 9 March 1874: Prussian [[Civil registry|Civil Registry Law]] (birth, [[Civil marriage|marriage]], death). The same law was passed for the whole empire on 6 February 1875.
* 4 May 1874: Empire, Expatriation Law: meant to curb the exercise of church duties by clerics without the required consent of authorities. The law stipulated, that in such cases, after a final conviction, a cleric would be banned from his parish or sent to another place within the empire and, in case of reoccurrence, that the cleric would be expatriated and expelled.
* 20 May 1874: Prussian Law on the administration of vacant bishoprics. According to the law of 11 May 1873, administrators were to be elected for vacant bishoprics, authorizing laymen to assume administrative responsibilities at the parish level. This additional law stipulated that should an administrator not be elected according to the law, the property would be managed by a state superintendent.
* On July 13, 1874, in the town of [[Bad Kissingen]], [[Eduard Kullmann]] attempted to [[assassinate]] Bismarck with a [[pistol]], but only hit his hand. Kullmann cited church laws as the reason for his attempt; he was sentenced to 14 years of ''Zuchthaus'' (correctional facilities with harsh forced labor). The assassination attempt led to an intensification of the Kulturkampf measures.

==== 1875 ====
* 5 February 1875, the encyclical, [[Quod Nunquam]] declared that the May Laws were invalid, "insofar as they totally oppose the divine order of the Church". The Catholic newspaper ''Westfälischer Merkur'' was the first to publish the whole text on the 18th of the same month in Germany. All the following papers publishing the encyclical were confiscated.&lt;ref name="Robbins 1920, p. 180" /&gt;
* 22 April 1875, the Prussian Payment Law (Breadbasket Law) stopped government subsidies and payments for the Catholic bishoprics and clerics unless they signed a declaration of adherence to all laws.
* 31 May 1875, Prussian Congregations Law dissolving all orders within 6 months except those involved in care for the infirm. For teaching orders, the time could be extended.
* 20 June 1875, Prussian Church Finances Administration Law providing for a representation and a council elected by the parish for the administration of property.
* 4 July 1875, Prussian Old-Catholic Church Entitlement Law giving Old-Catholic communities of a certain size the right to use Catholic churches and cemeteries.

==== 1876 ====
The last two laws passed in 1876 were of no practical importance.
* 26 February 1876, the possible punishment for violation of the pulpit law was extended to publications.
* 7 June 1876, the State Supervision Act provided for government supervision of all church assets in the Catholic dioceses in Prussia.

=== Mitigation and Peace Laws ===
[[File:Leo XIII..jpg|thumb|Pope Leo XIII (c. 1898)]]
The political situation in Europe was very volatile. Initially perceived as a possible enemy hostile to German unification under Prussian leadership, Austria and Germany very quickly became friends and formed the [[Dual Alliance (1879)|Dual Alliance]] in 1879. The possibility of a war with France or Russia also became more remote. Therefore, social and economic problems moved to the fore and Bismarck's attention gradually turned to other topics he deemed more threatening such as the increasing popularity of the [[Socialism|socialists]] or more important such as questions of import duties. In these matters, he could either not rely on the support of the liberals to pursue his goals or they were not sufficient to form a majority.
Bismarck had not been comfortable with the increasing ferocity of the Kulturkampf. Concerning the rise of the Centre Party, the laws had proven to be greatly ineffective and even counterproductive. He soon realized that they were of no help battling the Centre Party and as far as separation of state and church was concerned, he had achieved more than he wanted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Christopher |last=Clark |title=Iron Kingdom: The Rise and Downfall of Prussia, 1600–1947 |year=2006 |pages=568–576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to garner support for his [[Anti-Socialist Laws]] and protective trade tariffs,
Bismarck turned his back on the liberals in search of new alliances. The death of Pius IX on 7 February 1878 opened the door for a settlement with the Catholic Church. The new pope, [[Pope Leo XIII|Leo XIII]] was pragmatic and conciliatory and expressed his wish for peace in a letter to the Prussian king on the very day of his election followed by a second letter in a similar vein that same year.

Bismarck and the Pope entered into direct negotiations without the participation of the Church or the Reichstag, yet initially without much success. It came to pass that Falk, vehemently resented by Catholics, resigned on 14 July 1879, which could be read as a peace offering to the Vatican. A decisive boost only came in February 1880, when the Vatican unexpectedly agreed to the civic registry of clerics. As the Kulturkampf slowly wound down the talks lead to a number of so-called mitigation and peace laws which were passed until 1887.&lt;ref name="Robbins 1920, p. 180" /&gt;

* July 1880, the First Mitigation Law reallowed government payments to Prussian dioceses and freed the bishops from swearing allegiance to the Prussian laws. Hereupon, four new bishops were reinstated where seats had been left vacant after the death of former bishops. Catholic associations involved in the care of the infirm were readmitted.
* 1882 resumption of diplomatic relations between Prussia (not Germany) and the Vatican, which had been cut in 1872
* 31 May 1882, the Second Mitigation Law allowed the waiver of government exams for clerics
* July 1883, the Third Mitigation Law legalized all religious actions of bishops and in certain cases, the king could pardon deposed bishops. 280 expelled clerics were pardoned.

On 29 September 1885, as another sign of peace, Bismarck proposed the Pope as arbiter in a dispute with Spain about the [[Caroline Islands]] and accepted his verdict in favour of Spain. In gratitude but to the great horror of Catholics, the Pope awarded Bismarck the [[Supreme Order of Christ]], the highest order of chivalry to be granted by the Holy See. Bismarck was the only Protestant ever to receive this award.

After further negotiations between Prussia and the Vatican, the Prussian parliament passed 2 additional laws amending some of the Kulturkampf laws.
* 21 May 1886, the First Peace Law amended some of the regulations in the education standards and civic registry law of 11 May 1873 and state exams for clerics (waiver in Second Mitigation Law of 31 May 1882) were totally abolished. Episcopal-theological academies and seminaries, as well as theological studies at these institutions, were readmitted. Students were allowed to be quartered in Catholic boarding houses (Konvikts). The state acknowledged papal disciplinary powers and abolished The Royal Court of Justice for Ecclesiastical Affairs
* 26 April 1887, the Second Peace Law readmitted all orders except the Jesuits to Prussia
On 23 May 1887, the Pope declared "The struggle which damaged the church and was of no good to the state is now over". The Mitigation and Peace Laws restored the inner autonomy of the Catholic church while leaving key regulations and the laws concerning separation of church and state in place (civic marriage, civic registry, religious disaffiliation, government school supervision, civic registry of clerics, ban of Jesuits, pulpit law, state supervision of church assets, constitutional amendments and the Catholic section in the Ministry of Culture was not reintroduced).

The respective opposing parties in the Reichstag harshly criticized the concessions made by the Vatican and the Prussian government.
Windthorst and the Centre Party were dismayed at being sidelined and not being consulted about the concessions the pope made, e. g. about the ban on Jesuits or the civil registry of clerics. None of the party's major demands were met. Instead, the pope even sided with Bismarck on non-religious issues and pressured the Centre Party to support Bismarck or at least abstain, e. g. in the matter of the hotly debated Septennat 1887 (7-year military budget).
Many Liberals, especially Falk, objected to the concessions Bismarck made to the Church.

The growth of the Centre Party has been considered a major setback for Bismarck although never publicly conceded. Yet, in spite of strong Catholic representation in the Reichstag, the political power and influence of the Church in the public sphere and its political power was greatly reduced.

Although Germany and the Vatican were officially at peace after 1878, religious conflicts and tensions continued. At the turn of the century, [[Pope Pius X]] announced the encyclical [[Pascendi dominici gregis]], mounting new attacks on historical criticism of biblical texts and any accommodation of Catholicism to modern philosophy, sociology or literature. As of 1910, clerics had to take an oath against all forms of modernism, a requirement later extended to teachers of Catholic religion at schools and professors of Catholic theology resulting in intense political and public debates and new conflicts with the state.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Keith in: The Dynamics of Political Reform in Northern Europe 1780–1920, Political and Legal Perspectives, Leuven University Press, {{ISBN|9789058678256}}, p. 180-181&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects of the laws, contemporary criticism and long-term results ===

The abolishment of the Catholic section of the Prussian Ministry of ecclesiastical and educational affairs deprived Catholics of their voice at the highest level. The system of strict government supervision of schools was applied only in Catholic areas; the Protestant schools were left alone. The school politics also alienated Protestant conservatives and churchmen.&lt;ref&gt;Lamberti, (2001) p 177&lt;/ref&gt;

The British ambassador [[Odo Russell, 1st Baron Ampthill|Odo Russell]] reported to London in October 1872 how Bismarck's plans were backfiring by strengthening the ultramontane (pro-papal) position inside German Catholicism:
:The German Bishops who were politically powerless in Germany and theologically in opposition to the Pope in Rome – have now become powerful political leaders in Germany and enthusiastic defenders of the now infallible Faith of Rome, united, disciplined, and thirsting for martyrdom, thanks to Bismarck's uncalled for antiliberal declaration of War on the freedom they had hitherto peacefully enjoyed.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Edward Crankshaw, ''Bismarck'' (1981) pp 308-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly all German bishops, clergy and laymen rejected the legality of the new laws and were defiantly facing the increasingly heavy penalties, trials and imprisonments. As of 1878, only three of eight Prussian dioceses still had bishops, some 1,125 of 4,600 parishes were vacant, and nearly 1,800 priests ended up in jail or in exile, nearly half the monks and nuns had left Prussia, a third of the monasteries and convents were closed. Between 1872 and 1878, numerous Catholic newspapers were confiscated, Catholic associations and assemblies were dissolved, and Catholic civil servants were dismissed merely on the pretence of having Ultramontane sympathies. Thousands of laypeople were imprisoned for assisting priests to evade the punitive new laws.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;Helmstadter, Richard J., [https://books.google.com/books?id=aw_1aaE0Fb4C&amp;pg Freedom and religion in the nineteenth century], p. 19, Stanford Univ. Press 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steinhoff, "Christianity and the creation of Germany," (2008) p 295&lt;/ref&gt;

The general ideological enthusiasm among the liberals for the Kulturkampf&lt;ref name="PI1"&gt;"Liberals were the most enthusiastic champions of the general policy, because it satisfied a tradition of passionate anti-clericalism. Virchow meant Kulturkampf as a term of praise, signifying the liberation of public life from sectarian impositions (though the term was later taken up by Catholic leaders in a spirit of bitter derision)."

Apart from the outspoken criticism of the Kulturkampf Laws by the Catholic Church and the Centre Party, there were also a number of Liberals and Protestants who voiced concern at least at the so-called "Kampfgesetze" (battle laws). "Unease concerning the effects of his programme continued to spread among all but the most bigoted priest-haters and the most doctrinaire liberals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gordon A. Craig |title=Germany, 1866–1945 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mbP-PWnoHnIC&amp;pg=PA75 |year=1978 |publisher=Oxford UP |pages=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Such noted critics outside the Catholic camp were [[Friedrich Heinrich Geffcken]], [[Emil Albert Friedberg]] or [[Julius von Kirchmann]]. Although they were proponents of state superiority, they regarded some of the laws as either ineffective or as interference in internal church affairs and not consistent with liberal values. Geffcken wrote that "with the intention to emancipate the laity from the hierarchy, the main body of the Catholics was brought in phalanx into the hands of leaders from which it was to be wrested. But the state cannot fight at length against a third of the population, it has no means to break such a passive resistance supported and organized by religious fanaticism. If a statesman desists from the correctness of a measure it only matters that he has the power to enforce it."
Even Bismarck – who initially saw a variety of tactical political advantages in these measures, e. g. for his suppressive policies against the Polish population – took pains to distance himself from the rigors of their enforcement."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0377/is_n125/ai_18798593 A Supreme Court in the culture wars] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311012430/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0377/is_n125/ai_18798593 |date=2007-03-11 }} by Jeremy Rabkin in the Fall edition of the Public Interest&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kulturkampf law considered the harshest and with no equivalent in Europe was the Expatriation Law. Passed by a liberal majority in parliament, it stipulated banishment as a punishment that all civilized peoples considered the harshest beyond the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;Ruppert, Stefan in: Kirchenkampf und Kulturkampf: Historische Legitimation, politische Mitwirkung und wissenschaftliche Begleitung durch die Schule Emil Ludwig Richter, Mohr Siebeck, Tübingen, 2002, {{ISBN|978-3-16-147868-0}}, p.257 – 263&lt;/ref&gt;

As to the Centre Party, these measures did not have the effect that Bismarck had in mind. In the state elections of November 1873, it grew from 50 to 90 seats and in the Reichstag elections from 63 to 91. The number of Catholic periodicals also increased; in 1873 there were about 120.&lt;ref name="newadvent.org" /&gt;

The Kulturkampf gave secularists and socialists an opportunity to attack all religions, an outcome that distressed the Protestant leaders and especially Bismarck himself, who was a devout pietistic Protestant.&lt;ref name="Christopher Clark (2006) pp 568-576"&gt;Christopher Clark, ''Iron Kingdom: The Rise and Downfall of Prussia, 1600–1947'' (2006) pp. 568–576&lt;/ref&gt;

In the face of systematic defiance, the Bismarck government increased the penalties and its attacks, and were challenged in 1875 when a papal encyclical declared that the entire ecclesiastical legislation of Prussia was invalid, and threatened to excommunicate any Catholic who obeyed. There was no violence, but the Catholics mobilized their support, set up numerous civic organizations, raised money to pay fines and rallied behind their church and the Center Party.

To Bismarck's surprise, the Conservative Party especially the Junkers from his own landowning class in East Prussia sided with the Catholics.  They were Protestants and did not like the Pope, but they had much in common with the Center Party. The Conservatives controlled their local schools and did not want bureaucrats from Berlin to take them over. They were hostile to the liberals, being fearful of free trade that would put them in competition with the United States and other grain exporters, and disliking their secular views. In the Prussian legislature, they sided with the Center Party on the school issue. Bismarck was livid, and he resigned the premiership of Prussia (while remaining Chancellor of the German Empire), telling an ally, "in domestic affairs I have lost the ground that is for me acceptable through the unpatriotic treason of the Conservative Party in the Catholic question." Indeed, many of Bismarck's conservative friends were in opposition. So too was Kaiser William I, who was King of Prussia; he was strongly opposed to the civil marriage component of the Kulturkampf.&lt;ref&gt;Edgar Feuchtwangler, ''Bismarck'' (2000) pp 186-87&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kulturkampf made Catholics more resolute; they responded not with violence but with votes, and as the newly formed Center Party became a major force in the Imperial Parliament, it gained support from non-Catholic minorities who felt threatened by Bismarck's centralization of power.&lt;ref name="Christopher Clark (2006) pp 568-576" /&gt;
In the long run, the most significant result was the mobilization of the Catholic voters through the Center Party, and their insistence on protecting their church. Historian Margaret Anderson says:
:The effort was perceived, and not only by its opponents, as aiming at nothing less than the forcible assimilation of the Catholic Church and its adherents to the values and norms of the empire's Protestant majority....[it led] Catholics – young and old, male and female, cleric and lay, big men and small – to cleave to their priests and defy the legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Lavinia Anderson, ''Practicing democracy: Elections and political culture in Imperial Germany'' (Princeton University Press, 2000) p 107.&lt;/ref&gt;
After the Center party had doubled its popular vote in the elections of 1874, it became the second largest party in the national parliament, and remained a powerful force for the next 60 years. It became difficult for Bismarck to form a government without their support.&lt;ref name="Christopher Clark (2006) pp 568-576" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hajo Holborn, ''A History of Modern Germany: 1840–1945'' (1969), 258–260&lt;/ref&gt;
From the decades-long experience in battling against the Kulturkampf, the Catholics of Germany, says Professor Margaret Anderson, learned democracy. She states that the clergy:
:Acquired a pragmatic, but nonetheless real, commitment to democratic elections, parliamentary procedures, and party politics – commitments in which they schooled their flock, by their practice as much as by their preaching."&lt;ref&gt;Anderson,  ''Practicing Democracy (2000) p 150&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anti-Polish aspect of Kulturkampf ===

The Poles had already suffered from discrimination and numerous oppressive measures in Germany long before unification. These measures were intensified after the [[German Empire]] was formed&lt;ref&gt;History 1871–1939 Warszawa 2000 dr.Anna Radziwił prof.dr.hab Wojciech Roszkowski page 80&lt;/ref&gt; and Bismarck was known to be particularly hostile towards the Poles.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Jerzy Zdrada – Historia Polski 1795–1918 Warsaw Wydawnictwo Naukowe PWN 2007; pages 268, 273-291, 359-370&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Andrzej Chwalba – Historia Polski 1795–1918 Wydawnictwo Literackie 2000 Kraków pages 175-184, 307-312&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher Clark]] argues that Prussian policy changed radically in the 1870s in the face of highly visible Polish support for France in the Franco-Prussian war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Christopher Clark |title=Iron Kingdom: The Rise and Downfall of Prussia, 1600–1947 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eEOLV_TtNfQC&amp;pg=PT699 |year=2007 |publisher=Penguin |pages=579–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polish demonstrations made clear the Polish nationalist feeling, and calls were also made for Polish recruits to desert from the [[Prussian Army]] – though these went unheeded. Bismarck was outraged, telling the Prussian cabinet in 1871: From the Russian border to the Adriatic Sea we are confronted with the combined propaganda of Slavs, ultramontanes, and reactionaries, and it is necessary openly to defend our national interests and our language against such hostile actions.&lt;ref&gt;(in English) Jarmila Kaczmarek, Andrzej Prinke (2000).

Not an adamant supporter of the Liberal's general Kulturkampf goals, Bismarck did recognize the potential in some of them for subduing Polish national aspirations and readily made use of it. While the Liberals main objective was the separation of state and church as essential for a democratic and liberal society, Bismarck saw its use in separating the Polish population from the only supporter and guardian of its national identity.
Prussian authorities imprisoned 185 priests and forced hundreds of others into exile. Among the imprisoned was the [[Primate of Poland]] Archbishop [[Mieczysław Halka Ledóchowski|Mieczysław Ledóchowski]]. A large part of the remaining Catholic priests had to continue their service in hiding from the authorities. Although most of the 185 imprisoned were finally set free by the end of the decade, those who were released emigrated.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
The official end of the Kulturkampf had little influence on the policies of Germanization which continued in the Polish-inhabited parts of the country.&lt;ref name="Kaczmarek_Prinke" /&gt;

== Kulturkampf in Switzerland ==

Around the same time as in Germany, a Kulturkampf was also raging in Switzerland with roots dating back to the 1830 and well beyond to the era of enlightenment and the [[Helvetic Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Franz Xaver Bischof in: Historisches Lexikon der Schweiz (German), http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D17244.php {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818175631/http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D17244.php |date=2017-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, it was in the Swiss context that the term "Kulturkampf" first appeared in a publication.&lt;ref name="Borutta 2011, p. 11" /&gt;
The 1830s were years of liberal [[Restoration and Regeneration in Switzerland|regeneration]] and 12 cantons with liberal majorities enacted new constitutions with radical changes in the relationship between state and churches, especially putting education under government control.

These changes mainly affected the Catholic Church and its clerics resisted the new regulations. On 2 January 1834, at a meeting in Baden, the cantons of Lucerne, Bern, Zug, Solothurn, Basel-Landschaft, St. Gall, Aargau and Thurgau passed the "Resolution of Baden" (see [[:de:Badener Artikel]]) to assert the demands of the state. A conservative backlash 1839 in Zurich ([[Züriputsch]]) and 1841 in Lucerne (in connection with the Aargau monastery dispute), the violent repression of the liberals in Valais by the [[Ultramontanes]] and the appointment of Jesuits to secondary schools in Lucerne led to the establishment of [[Freischar]] (rebel) forces in various liberal cantons. This in turn prompted the conservative cantons, initially secret, to form the "Sonderbund" (Special Union) in December 1845. In July 1847 the Federal Diet voted to dissolve the Sonderbund, amend the constitution and to expel the Jesuits which led to protests not only by the Vatican but also from the big conservative European powers of France, Russia, pre-revolutionary Prussia and Austria. The liberals had the undisguised support of England. The [[Sonderbund War]] broke out on 3. November 1847 and lasted until the surrender of the last conservative canton, Valais, on 29. November. Liberal constitutions were installed in all cantons. With revolutions breaking out in France and Germany threats by these powers remained empty.

The years from 1830 to the end of the Sonderbundwar are considered the first phase of the Swiss Kulturkampf. A second phase started with various disputes and conflicts in the 1870s.

Walter Munzinger, unhappy with the dogma of [[papal infallibility]], organized the first Swiss convention of Catholics in Solothurn on 18 September 1871 for like-minded Catholics. This convention is considered the beginning of the [[Christian Catholic Church of Switzerland]], a member church of the [[Union of Utrecht (Old Catholic)|Union of Utrecht]] of [[Old Catholic Church]]es.

One of the disputes was about the town priest of Geneva, Gaspar Mermillod, who assumed the powers of the bishop for the local Catholics without the approval of the government. Despite the protest of the state council Mermillod continued to execute these powers; as a result, he was deposed on 20 September 1872. On 16 January, the Roman Curia appointed Mermillod as [[Apostolic vicariate|vicar apostolic]] for the [[Canton of Geneva]]. In response, the [[Swiss Federal Council]] expelled him. After pope [[Pius IX]] called these proceedings by the Swiss authorities "disgraceful" in an [[encyclical]] of 20 November 1873, the Federal Council broke off diplomatic relations with the Vatican on 12 December 1873.

After the Council of 1870, bishop Eugène Lachat of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Basel|Diocese of Basel]] proclaimed the dogma of papal infallibility in his diocese even though the respective cantons (Solothurn, Lucerne, Zug, Bern, Aargau, Thurgau and Basel-Landschaft) had expressly forbidden him to do so. Two priests in Lucerne and Starrkirch did not acknowledge the new dogma. Lachat deposed and excommunicated them. Thereupon, the cantons Solothurn, Bern, Aargau, Thurgau and Basel-Landschaft deposed the bishop on 29 January 1873 and when the cathedral chapter refused to appoint an interim bishop, on 21 December 1874 they dissolved the diocese of Basel and liquidated Lachat's assets. Lachat moved his office from Solothurn to Lucerne. 97 clerics in the predominantly Catholic part of the canton Berne (today canton Jura) protested against the deposition of the bishop and the dissolution of the diocese. They proclaimed Lachat to be their rightful bishop at which the Federal Council deposed them. Rioting in several villages of the Jura region was quelled by force and military occupation; the 97 clerics were expelled in January 1874. The federal government rescinded this ordinance in 1875 but supremacy over the church by the canton of Berne was confirmed in a [[plebiscite]].

In 1874, Switzerland enacted the second federal constitution which was accepted in a plebiscite. Except for the following restrictions, for the first time, this constitution allowed complete freedom of religion.
* Section 50 stipulated that new dioceses require the consent of the government. This regulation remained in place until 2001.
* Sections 51 and 52 outlawed the Jesuits and the (re-)establishment of monasteries. These regulations remained in place until 1973.
* Section 75 stipulated that clerics could not be voted into the National Council (federal parliament). This did not apply to the Council of States (upper house). The regulation was quietly dropped in a revision of the constitution in 1999.

In December 1874, the [[University of Bern]] established a faculty for Catholic theology with the aim to train liberal-minded Catholic priests for the Jura region.

== Kulturkampf in Austria ==

The Kulturkampf in Austria has roots dating back to the 18th. century. Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] launched a religious policy later called "[[Josephinism]]" advocating the supremacy of the state in religious matters. This resulted in far-reaching state control over the Catholic Church in Austria including e. g. the reorganization of dioceses, regulating the number of masses, the transfer of many schools into government hands, state-controlled seminaries, limiting the number of clerics and dissolving numerous monasteries. Protests of [[Pope Pius VI]] and even his visit to Vienna in 1782 were to no avail.
In the concordat of 1855, the culmination of Catholic influence in Austria, many of the Catholic Church's previous rights taken away under Joseph II were restored (marriage, partial control of censorship, elementary and secondary education, full control of clergy and religious fund.

In 1886 and 1869, after sanctioning the December constitution, the new cabinet appointed by emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Francis Joseph]] undid parts of the concordat with several liberal reforms enacted in the so-called May Laws. Against strong protests from the Catholic Church, the laws of 25 May 1868 and 14 May 1869 restored civil marriage, passed primary and secondary education into government hands, installed interconfessional schools and regulated interconfessional relations (e. g. mixed marriages, faith of children including option of free choice).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/concordat-of-1855 |title=concordat of 1855 – Austrian religious history |accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aeiou.at/aeiou.encyclop.k/k629588.htm;internal&amp;action=_setlanguage.action?LANGUAGE=en |title=Konkordat |accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a secret consistory, [[Pope Pius IX]] condemned the constitution of 1867 and the May laws as "leges abominabiles". In a pastoral letter on 7 September 1868, bishop [[Franz-Josef Rudigier]] called for resistance to these May laws. The letter was confiscated and he had to appear before court on 5 June 1869 which, for the first time, lead to public demonstrations of the Catholic population. On 12 July 1869, the bishop was sentenced to a jail term of two weeks, but pardoned by the emperor.

The May laws provoked a serious conflict between state and church. Austria abrogated the concordat of 1855 in 1870 after the promulgation of papal infallibility and abolished it in altogether in 1874. In May 1874, the Religious Act was officially recognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kath.net/news/22570 |title='Heroischer Tugendgrad' für Bischof Rudigier |accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kulturkampf in Italy ==

The Kulturkampf in Italy is a very early example of the struggles between states and the Catholic Church; Italian liberals and democrats contributed substantially to the secularist project of modernity and had a strong effect on its own history.

[[Piedmont]] had a similar role in the unification of Italy as Prussia in Germany and it had been at the forefront in the struggle against the Catholic Church as far back as the 17th century under [[Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia|Victor Amadeus]]. The Church rejected an edict of 1694 tolerating the [[Waldensians]]. In the ensuing dispute, Amadeus prohibited the publication of the pope's decree and many dioceses remained vacant. Amadeus demanded secular approval of clerical postings (bishops, priests, monasteries) and for ecclesiastical acts. Repeated negotiations brought no results, all the while the Vatican pronounced excommunications on secular officials and Amadeus countered with severe measures against clerics. The acquisition of Sardinia in 1720 added more issues about Church rights on the island. It was only under the following pope, [[Pope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]] that negotiations were taken up again and an agreement was found in 1727 in which the Church relinquished some its previous rights. Under Amadeus’ successor, [[Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia|Charles Emmanuel]], the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] continued to press the Church hard for further concessions concerning ecclesiastical jurisdiction and taxation up to 1750.

As a result of the [[revolutions of 1848]], King [[Charles Albert]] granted the Kingdom a constitution, summoned a liberal cabinet and assumed the leadership for the [[Italian unification|unification of Italy]]. That same year the Jesuits were banned, as in most Italian states, and a liberal school law was enacted. In 1849, the archbishops of Turin and Sassari were imprisoned. In 1850, ecclesiastical immunities were lifted and ecclesiastical jurisdiction further restricted. 1851 saw the introduction of regulated theological instruction, 1852 the introduction of civil marriage. In 1853 the office of the Apostolic royal steward was secularized. Laws of 1854 banned monasteries, of 1855 the Ecclesiastical Academy of Superga and as of 1856, regulations followed concerning priests and parish administration and the confiscation of Church lands.
As of 1852, these policies were enacted under the liberal prime minister of the kingdom, [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour]] who pursued Italian unification with the aim of Rome as the capital.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12076b.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Piedmont |accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1860, the Kingdom of Sardinia annexed all the Church territories ([[Romagna]], [[Marche]] and [[Umbria]]) except the Patrimonium Petri and Rome itself which was protected by French troops, The pope excommunicated the "thieves of Church state" [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel]] proclaimed the Kingdom of Italy and became its first King. Cavour made an offer to the pope, to guarantee the Church's sovereignty and far-reaching privileges in turn for the Church to give up the city of Rome. Pius IX declined. In 1861, Cavour submitted another offer, adding a regular payment to the pope and the king giving up his right to appoint bishops. Again, the pope declined.

When the French pulled their troops out of Rome due to the Franco-Prussian war, Italy, encouraged by the German envoy von Arnim, seized the remaining Church territory and the city on 20 September 1870 after which Rome became the Italian capital. The Vatican resisted any recognition of the Italian state until 1929.
Through the years, the anti-church laws of Piedmont and Sardinia were extended to every expansion and eventually taken over by the new Italian state.

In 1887, under prime minister Crispi, Italy added the abolishment of church tithes; in 1888 it passed a law making access to primary school religious instruction more difficult, in 1889 the pulpit law was added to the criminal code and the law on the "opere pie", putting control of a vast network of endowments and trust funds financing both religious and charitable works into public authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pollard |first=John |title=Catholicism in Modern Italy: Religion, Society and Politics Since 1861, Routledge |date=2008 |isbn=978-0-203-89319-7 |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

and every attempt to reform schools was met with fierce resistance by the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=Galloy139&gt;{{cite book |last=Galloy, Denise |first=Hayt, Franz |title=La Belgique: des Tribus Gauloises à l'État Fédéral |year=2006 |publisher=De Boeck |location=Brussels |isbn=2-8041-5098-4 |edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The struggle reached a pivotal point under the liberal government of [[Walthère Frère-Orban]] (see [[:nl:Regering-Frère-Orban II]]). From 1879 to 1884 there was a political crisis over state control of education and religious courses in public (see [[First School War]]). On 1 June 1879, Frère-Orban passed an Education Act secularizing primary education.
The new law imposed recognized diplomas for teachers, stipulated state supervision of all schools and stripped Catholicism of its status as the basis of education. Religious instruction in schools was possible outside the curriculum on request of parents. Municipalities were required to supply at least one neutral school and founding or subsidising private schools were banned. A new law on secondary schools was in the same vein. It was to guarantee parents the freedom of choice between religious and neutral schools.&lt;ref name=Galloy139 /&gt; By 1883, 3,885 secular schools had opened across the country.

To the Catholic Church, this was a declaration of all-out war. It called for a boycott of these new schools and it managed to mobilise almost the entire Catholic camp. Staff and supporters of public schools and parents who sent their children were denied communion and in effect excommunicated. The government cut diplomatic relations with the Vatican and measures against rebellious civil servants and clergy added fire to the heat. The Church required priests to establish Catholic schools in every parish and attendance of Catholic schools rose from 13 percent to over 60 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cook |first=Bernard A. |title=Belgium: a history |year=2004 |publisher=Peter Lang |location=New York |isbn=0-8204-5824-4 |page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In part due to this conflict, the liberals lost the [[Belgian general election, 1884|elections in 1884]]. The Catholic government under [[Jules Malou]] amended the Education Law providing public support for religious schools as well and, in 1895, religious education became compulsory in all schools.&lt;ref name=Galloy139 /&gt; From then on, with changing majorities in parliament, regulations were made either more in favour of the Church or more in favour of the Liberals, each time to the dissatisfaction of the opposition. The struggle resulted in the development of two opposing school systems: the so-called religious "free schools" and the government schools. The dispute remained unsolved and broke out again in the 1950s ([[Second School War]]).&lt;ref&gt;Pierce, Julian in: "The School Question in Belgium", ''Elementary School Journal'' (1921) 22#4 pp. 290–297 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/993691 in JSTOR] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202024938/https://www.jstor.org/stable/993691 |date=2017-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Witte, Els, Craeybeckx, Jan, Meynen, Alain in: Political History of Belgium: From 1830 Onwards, ASP Brussels, 2009, {{ISBN|9789054875178}}, p. 89–92&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary use of the term "Kulturkampf" ==
=== United States ===
In the late 19th century, cultural wars arose over issues of prohibition and education in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Jensen, ''The Winning of the Midwest: Social and Political conflict, 1888–1896'' (1971) [https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Winning_of_the_Midwest_Social_and_Po.html?id=XpCgCNZwpvoC online] ch 3-5&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bennett Law]] was a highly controversial state law passed in Wisconsin in 1889 that required the use of English to teach major subjects in all public and private elementary and high schools. Because Wisconsin German Catholics and Lutherans each operated large numbers of parochial schools where German was used in the classroom, it was bitterly resented by [[German-American]] (and some Norwegian) communities. Although the law was ultimately repealed, there were significant political repercussions, with the Republicans losing the governorship and the legislature, and the election of Democrats to the Senate and House of Representatives.&lt;ref&gt;William Foote Whyte, [http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/u/?/wmh,5642 "The Bennett Law Campaign in Wisconsin,"] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120709114033/http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/u/?/wmh,5642 |date=2012-07-09 }} ''Wisconsin Magazine of History'', 10: 4 (1926–1927).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger E. Wyman, "Wisconsin ethnic groups and the election of 1890." The Wisconsin Magazine of History (1968): 269-293. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4634354 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the terms "[[culture war]]" and "culture wars" refer to conflict in the late 20th and early 21st centuries between religious [[social conservative]]s and secular [[liberalism|social liberals]].&lt;ref&gt;Morris P. Fiorina, Samuel J. Abrams, and Jeremy C. Pope, ''Culture war?'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; This theme of "culture war" was the basis of [[Patrick Buchanan]]'s keynote speech at the [[1992 Republican National Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;see [http://buchanan.org/blog/1992-republican-national-convention-speech-148 August 17, 1992 Buchanan Speech] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141005032823/http://buchanan.org/blog/1992-republican-national-convention-speech-148 |date=October 5, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "culture war" by 2004 was in common use in the United States by both liberals and conservatives.

Throughout the 1980s, there were battles in Congress and the media regarding federal support for the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] and the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] that amounted to a war over high culture between neoconservatives and paleoconservatives.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Jensen, "The Culture Wars, 1965–1995: A Historian`s Map." ''Journal of Social History'' (Oct 1995), 17-36. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3789064 in JSTOR] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313221140/http://www.jstor.org/stable/3789064 |date=2016-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] referenced the term in the Supreme Court case ''[[Romer v. Evans]]'', [[judicial citation|517 U.S. 620]] (1996), saying "The Court has mistaken a ''Kulturkampf'' for a fit of spite."  The case concerned an amendment to the [[Colorado]] state constitution that prohibited any subdepartment from acting to protect individuals on the basis of sexual orientation. Scalia believed that the amendment was a valid move on the part of citizens who sought "recourse to a more general and hence more difficult level of political decision making than others."  The majority disagreed, holding that the amendment violated the Equal Protection clause of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].

=== Israel ===
The term, translated to [[Hebrew]], (Milhemet Tarbut, ''מלחמת תרבות'') is also frequently used, with similar connotations, in the political debates of [[Israel]]—having been introduced by Jews who fled Nazi Germany in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;"Secular and Ultra Orthodox Knesset Members threaten 'Culture War'", Israeli National News, May 11, 2013 [http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/173639] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105161535/http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/173639 |date=2013-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Macquarie Dictionary''''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|k|w|ɒr|i}}) is a [[dictionary]] of [[Australian English]]. It is generally held by universities and the legal profession to be the authoritative source on [[Australian English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unimelb.libguides.com/content.php?pid=130967&amp;sid=1123371|publisher=[[University of Melbourne]]|title=Reference|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103005711/http://unimelb.libguides.com/content.php?pid=130967&amp;sid=1123371|archivedate=2015-01-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also pays considerable attention to [[New Zealand English]]. Originally it was a publishing project of Jacaranda Press, a Brisbane educational publisher, for which an editorial committee was formed, largely from the Linguistics department of [[Macquarie University]] in [[Sydney]], Australia.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Story of Australian English|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gPR4CAAAQBAJ|publisher = NewSouth|date = 2015-03-01|isbn = 9781742241906|first = Kel|last = Richards}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now published by Macquarie Dictionary Publishers an imprint of Pan Macmillan Australia Pty Ltd. In October 2007 it moved its editorial office away from Macquarie University to the [[University of Sydney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Macquarie Dictionary, uni split amicably|url = http://www.smh.com.au/national/macquarie-dictionary-uni-split-amicably-20070326-4bx.html|website = The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate = 2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first seven editions of the ''Macquarie Dictionary'' were edited by lexicographer [[Susan Butler]], who joined the project in 1970 as a research assistant, and was its chief editor by the time the first edition was published in 1981. Butler announced her retirement as the ''Macquarie'''s editor in March 2018 after 48 years with the publisher.&lt;ref name="wordforword"&gt;{{cite web |title=Take a bow, Sue Butler |url=https://www.macquariedictionary.com.au/podcast/article/506/ |website=Word for Word |publisher=Macquarie Dictionary |accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First Edition ===
The original version of the ''Macquarie Dictionary'' was based on Hamlyn's ''[[Encyclopedic World Dictionary]]'' of 1971, which in turn was based on [[Random House]]'s ''[[American College Dictionary]]'' of 1947,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Routledge Handbook of Forensic Linguistics|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=j4nFBQAAQBAJ|publisher = Routledge|date = 2010-03-30|isbn = 9781136998720|first = Malcolm|last = Coulthard|first2 = Alison|last2 = Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was based on the 1927 ''[[Century Dictionary|New Century Dictionary]]'', which was based on ''[[The Imperial Dictionary of the English Language]]'', which itself was based on Noah Webster's ''[[American Dictionary of the English Language]]'' second edition of 1841.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Since its first publication in 1981,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; its use has grown so that over time, it has come to rival longer-established dictionaries from elsewhere in the English-speaking world as a standard authority on the English language within Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Handbook of World Englishes|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PpeXINCnDbIC|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons|date = 2009-02-17|isbn = 9781405188319|first = Braj|last = Kachru|first2 = Yamuna|last2 = Kachru|first3 = Cecil|last3 = Nelson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second Edition ===
The second edition was published in 1991 and it introduced encyclopedic content to many entries.[[File:Photo of Macquarie Dictionary Fourth Edition.jpg|alt=The Macquarie Dictionary Fourth Edition.|thumb|157x157px|The ''Macquarie Dictionary'' Fourth Edition.]][[File:Photo of Macquarie Dictionary Fifth Edition.JPG|alt=The Macquarie Dictionary Fifth Edition.|thumb|155x155px|The ''Macquarie Dictionary'' Fifth Edition.]]

=== Third Edition ===
The third edition, published in 1997, made use of an inhouse corpus of Australian writing, Ozcorp, to add a large number of examples of Australian usage, to give some of the flavour of an historical dictionary. This edition also gave a good coverage of English in Asia.

=== Fourth Edition ===
The fourth edition, published in 2005, increases the number of citations, includes etymologies for many phrases and pays particular attention to Australian regionalisms.

=== Fifth Edition ===
The fifth edition was published on October 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = News {{!}} The University of Sydney|url = http://sydney.edu.au/news/84.html?newsstoryid=4038|website = sydney.edu.au|accessdate = 2015-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and places particular emphasis on words relating to the environment and [[climate change]].

=== Sixth Edition ===
The sixth edition was published on October 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Macquarie update: new words for a new age|url = http://www.illawarramercury.com.au/story/1821410/macquarie-update-new-words-for-a-new-age/|website = Illawarra Mercury|accessdate = 2015-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and includes an update of new words and senses as well as words and phrases from other varieties of English which impinge on Australian English such as British English, American English and English in Southeast Asia, China and India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Macquarie Dictionary Seventh Edition|url =  http://www.panmacmillan.com.au/9781876429898|website = Pan Macmillan|accessdate = 2017-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Seventh Edition ===
The seventh edition of the ''Macquarie Dictionary'' was published on 28 February 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Macquarie Dictionary Seventh Edition|url =  http://www.panmacmillan.com.au/9781742619811|website = Pan Macmillan|accessdate = 2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a foreword by [[Kate Grenville]], this latest edition includes thousands of new words and senses along with Australian regionalisms and a collection of words from the Australian experience in WW1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Macquarie Dictionary Seventh Edition|url =  http://www.panmacmillan.com.au/9781742619811|website = Pan Macmillan|accessdate = 2017-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Preferred spellings ===
The dictionary records standard Australian English spelling, which is closer to [[British English|British]] spelling than [[American English|American]] spelling, with spellings like ''colour'', ''centre'', ''defence'' and ''practice/practise'' (noun/verb). It gives ''-ise'' spellings first, listing ''-ize'' spellings as acceptable variants, unlike the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' and some other dictionaries of British English, which continue to prefer ''-ize'' to ''-ise'' in spite of the opposite tendency amongst the British general public (see [[Oxford spelling]]). ''Labour'', however, is sometimes spelt ''labor'', especially in reference to the Australian political party.

One difference from British usage is the word ''program'' which the ''Macquarie Dictionary'' gives as the preferred spelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.macquariedictionary.com.au/features/word/search/program/ |title=Macquarie Dictionary Search Word program |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2014 |website=/www.macquariedictionary.com.au |publisher= Macmillan Publishers Group Australia  |access-date=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Museum of the American Indian Act''' ('''NMAI''') was enacted on November 28, 1989, as Public Law 101-185. The law established the [[National Museum of the American Indian]] as part of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. The law also required the Secretary of the Smithsonian to prepare an inventory of all Indian and Native Hawaiian human remains and funerary objects in Smithsonian collections, as well as expeditiously return these items upon the request of culturally affiliated [[federally recognized Indian tribes]] and Native Hawaiian organizations.

==The Smithsonian Institution==
The NMAI expands the Smithsonian Institution by authorizing erection of a new museum on the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] to house Native American artifacts from the [[Heye Foundation|Heye Foundation's]] Museum of the American Indian. As part of a legal compromise regarding the Heye Foundation's [[New York (state)|New York]] state charter, the George Gustave Heye Center of the National Museum of the American Indian was also created by the NMAI in the [[Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House]] in [[New York City]].

The purpose of the NMAI is threefold:

*To advance the study of Native Americans
*To collect, preserve, and exhibit Native American objects
*To provide for Native American research and study programs

==Inventory and return==
Prior to enactment of the NMAI, representatives of the [[Native American Rights Fund]] and the Association for Native American Affairs told Congressional staffers that they would oppose the bill if repatriation provisions were not included. At an August, 1989, meeting in Santa Fe, NM, Secretary of the Smithsonian [[Robert McCormick Adams, Jr.]], agreed that the Smithsonian would abide by new repatriation provisions.&lt;ref&gt;McKeown, C.T., In the Smaller Scope of Conscience: the Struggle for National Repatriation Legislation, 1986-1990 (2012) [[University of Arizona Press]] {{ISBN|9780816526871}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the law, the Secretary of the Smithsonian is required to inventory Indian and Native Hawaiian human remains and funerary objects in the possession or control of the Smithsonian Institution and return them upon request by a descendant or culturally affiliated Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization. These items are housed primarily in the National Museum of Natural History, National Museum of the American Indian, and National Museum of American History.

The Smithsonian had amassed a huge collection of Native American items including:

*4,000 Native American remains collected under a 1867 order by the [[Surgeon General of the United States Army]] to [[United States Army|Army]] medical officers to send skeletal remains of Native Americans to the [[National Museum of Health and Medicine|Army Medical Museum]]. These remains were transferred to the Smithsonian Institution beginning in 1898.   
*Another 14,000 Native American remains were obtained through archaeological excavations, individual donations, and museum donations.
*The acquisition of the Heye Foundation's collections added 800,000 artifacts to the Smithsonian's Native American collections.

==Return criteria==
The 1989 act applied only to the return of Indian and Native Hawaiian human remains and funerary objects. The NMAI was amended in 1996 to include additional categories derived from the [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]] enacted in 1990, with similar definitions:

*Human remains
*Associated funerary objects
*Unassociated funerary objects
*Sacred objects
*Objects of cultural patrimony

The 1996 amendment also established specific deadlines for the Smithsonian to complete its summary and inventory tasks. The National Museum of Natural History posted summaries of its cultural affiliation case reports on its website. By 2007, the remains of 18,568 individuals had been identified. Of these, remains representing 5,435 individuals (29%) had been offered for repatriation to lineal descendants or culturally affiliated Indian tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations. By 1996, the National Museum of the American Indian had identified the remains of 524 individuals in its collection, of which 227 (41%) had already been repatriated.&lt;ref&gt;McKeown, C.T., Repatriation, Handbook of North American Indians, volume 2, 2008.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==GAO Report on Repatriation==
In 2011, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) completed a study of the extent to which the Smithsonian had fulfilled the repatriation requirements of the NMAI Act.&lt;ref&gt;Government Accountability Office, Smithsonian Institution: Much Work Still Needed to Identify and Repatriate Indian Human Remains and Objects, GAO-11-505 (May 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The GAO found that while the Smithsonian had inventoried, identified, and returned thousands of Indian human remains, at the current pace it may take decades more for it to complete the process. The GAO suggested that Congress consider ways to expedite the process including, but not limited to, directing the Smithsonian to make cultural affiliation determinations as efficiently and effectively as possible. The GAO also recommended certain administrative changes to enhance oversight of the process.

'''Panyathai''' was a [[Thailand|Thai]] [[online encyclopedia]] started on 1 December 2006 with 80 articles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=เปิดตัว “คลังปัญญาไทย” เว็บไซต์สารานุกรมไซเบอร์ฉลองปีมหามงคล|url=http://www.manager.co.th/QOL/ViewNews.aspx?NewsID=9490000148305&amp;Keyword=%c7%d4%a1%d4%be%d5%e0%b4%d5%c2|accessdate=6 September 2017|work=MGR Online|date=2006-12-01|format=Press Release}}&lt;/ref&gt; mainly in [[Thai language|Thai]]. Established in honor of King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]], the [[site plan]] was to have at least 80,000 articles by 5 December 2007, the king's 80th birthday. It contained some English content, mostly providing information about royal projects.

The articles came from two different sources:

The '''Peggy Guggenheim Collection''' is a [[modern art]] museum on the [[Grand Canal of Venice|Grand Canal]] in the [[Dorsoduro]] ''sestiere'' of [[Venice]], Italy. It is one of the most visited attractions in Venice. The collection is housed in the Palazzo Venier dei Leoni, an 18th-century palace, which was the home of the American heiress [[Peggy Guggenheim]] for three decades. She began displaying her private collection of [[modern art]]works to the public seasonally in 1951.  After her death in 1979, it passed to the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation]], which opened the collection year-round from 1980.

The collection includes works of prominent Italian [[futurism|futurist]]s and American [[modernism|modernist]]s working in such genres as [[Cubism]], [[Surrealism]] and [[abstract expressionism]]. It also includes sculptural works. In 2017, [[Karole Vail]], a granddaughter of Peggy Guggenheim, was appointed Director of the collection, succeeding Philip Rylands, who led the museum for 37 years.

==Collection==
The collection is principally based on the personal art collection of [[Peggy Guggenheim]], a former wife of artist [[Max Ernst]] and a niece of the mining magnate, [[Solomon R. Guggenheim]].  She collected the artworks mostly between 1938 and 1946, buying works in Europe "in dizzying succession" as World War II began, and later in America, where she discovered the talent of [[Jackson Pollock]], among others.&lt;ref name=Priceless&gt;Walsh, John. [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/the-priceless-peggy-guggenheim-1806124.html "The Priceless Peggy Guggenheim"], ''The Independent'', October 21, 2009, accessed March 12, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  The museum "houses an impressive selection of [[modern art]].  Its picturesque setting and well-respected collection attract some 400,000 visitors per year",&lt;ref name=Priceless/&gt; making it "the most-visited site in Venice after the [[Doge's Palace]]".&lt;ref name=GLawsuit&gt;Penketh, Anne. [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/may/19/peggy-guggenheim-venice-art-collection-grandchildren-revive-feud-suing "Peggy Guggenheim's family revive feud by suing foundation over art collection"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 19 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Works on display include those of prominent Italian futurists and American modernists.  Pieces in the collection embrace Cubism, Surrealism and [[abstract expressionism]].&lt;ref name=collections /&gt; During Peggy Guggenheim's 30-year residence in Venice, her collection was seen at her home in the Palazzo Venier dei Leoni and at special exhibitions in Amsterdam (1950), Zürich (1951), London (1964), Stockholm (1966), Copenhagen (1966), New York (1969) and Paris (1974).&lt;ref&gt;Decker, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[File:Peggy, Marseille37.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Peggy Guggenheim, Marseille, 1937]]
Among the artists represented in the collection are, from Italy, [[Giorgio de Chirico|De Chirico]] (''The Red Tower, The Nostalgia of the Poet'') and [[Gino Severini|Severini]] (''Sea Dancer''); from France, [[Georges Braque|Braque]] (''The Clarinet''),  [[Jean Metzinger|Metzinger]] (''[[Au Vélodrome]]''), [[Albert Gleizes|Gleizes]] (''[[Woman with Animals]]''), [[Marcel Duchamp|Duchamp]] (''Sad Young Man on a Train''), [[Fernand Léger|Léger]] (''Study of a Nude'' and ''Men in the City'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim-venice.it/inglese/collections/artisti/biografia.php?id_art=98|title=Fernand Léger|publisher=Museum's official website}} A third work that Guggenheim had purchased was never exhibited, as it was suspected to be a fraud. In February 2014, researchers concluded that the piece was a fake after "they detected faint signatures of Cold war-era nuclear bombs in the canvas that reveal the painting was created after Léger's death", in 1959.  Gannon, Megan.

In addition to the permanent collection, the museum houses 26 works on long-term loan from the [[Gianni Mattioli]] Collection, including images of Italian futurism by artists including  [[Umberto Boccioni|Boccioni]] (''Materia'', ''[[Dynamism of a Cyclist]]''), [[Carlo Carrà|Carrà]] (''Interventionist Demonstration''), [[Luigi Russolo|Russolo]] (''The Solidity of Fog'') and Severini (''Blue Dancer''), as well as works by [[Giacomo Balla|Balla]], [[Fortunato Depero|Depero]], [[Ottone Rosai|Rosai]],  [[Mario Sironi|Sironi]] and [[Ardengo Soffici|Soffici]].&lt;ref name=collections/&gt; In 2012, the museum received 83 works from the Rudolph and Hannelore Schulhof Collection, which has its own gallery within in the building.&lt;ref&gt;Pia Catton (September 19, 2012), [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443816804578004632306739610 From a Long Island Home, Art for Many Collectors] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ruiz, McGivern"&gt;Ruiz, Cristina and Hannah McGivern.

==Building and Venice Biennale==
[[Image:PeggyGuggenheimEntrance.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance to Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Palazzo Venier dei Leoni]]
The collection is housed in the Palazzo Venier dei Leoni, which Peggy Guggenheim purchased in 1949.&lt;ref name=Priceless/&gt;  Although sometimes mistaken for a modern building,&lt;ref&gt;Lauritzen and Zielcke, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; it is an 18th-century palace designed by the Venetian architect Lorenzo Boschetti.&lt;ref name=vail&gt;Vail, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; The building was unfinished, and has an unusually low elevation on the Grand Canal. The museum's website describes it thus:

{{quote|Palazzo Venier dei Leoni's long low façade, made of Istrian stone and set off against the trees in the garden behind that soften its lines, forms a welcome "caesura" in the stately march of Grand Canal palaces from the [[Gallerie dell'Accademia|Accademia]] to the [[Santa Maria della Salute|Salute]].&lt;ref name=palace/&gt;|}}

The palazzo was Peggy Guggenheim's home for thirty years.&lt;ref name=vail/&gt; In 1951, the palazzo, its garden, now called the Nasher Sculpture Garden, and her art collection were opened to the public from April to October for viewing.&lt;ref&gt;Vail, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;  Her collection at the palazzo remained open during the summers until her death in [[Camposampiero]], northern Italy, in 1979; she had donated the palazzo and the 300-piece collection to the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation]] in 1976.&lt;ref name=Priceless/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Messer (Nicolini introduction), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;  The foundation, then under the direction of Peter Lawson-Johnston, took control of the palazzo and the collection in 1979&lt;ref&gt;Tacou-Rumney, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; and re-opened the collection there in April 1980 as the Peggy Guggenheim Collection.

After the Foundation took control of the building in 1979, it took steps to expand gallery space; by 1985, "all of the rooms on the main floor had been converted into galleries ... the white [[Istrian]] stone facade and the unique canal terrace had been restored" and a protruding arcade wing, called the barchessa, had been rebuilt by architect Giorgio Bellavitis.&lt;ref name=VeniceArch&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/guggenheim-foundation/architecture/venice "Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Venice"], The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, accessed April 3, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1985, the museum has been open year-round.&lt;ref name=palace&gt;[http://www.guggenheim-venice.it/inglese/museum/palazzo.html "The Palace"], Peggy Guggenheim Collection, accessed 10 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1993, apartments adjacent to the museum were converted to a garden annex, a shop and more galleries.&lt;ref name=VeniceArch/&gt; In 1995, the Nasher Sculpture Garden was completed, additional exhibition rooms were added, and a café was opened.&lt;ref name=VeniceArch/&gt; A few years later, in 1999 and in 2000, the two neighboring properties were acquired.&lt;ref name=VeniceArch/&gt; In 2003, a new entrance and booking office opened to cope with the increasing number of visitors, which reached 350,000 in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Decker, pp. 139–140&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1993, the museum has doubled in size, from 2,000 to 4,000 square meters.&lt;ref name=Priceless/&gt;

Since 1985, the United States has selected the foundation to operate the U.S. Pavilion of the [[Venice Biennale]], an exhibition held every other summer. In 1986, the foundation purchased the Palladian-style pavilion, built in 1930.&lt;ref name=Priceless/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.guggenheim-venice.it/inglese/pavilion/index.php |title=US Pavilion |work=Peggy Guggenheim Collection |publisher=The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation |accessdate=October 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management and attendance==
Philip Rylands led the museum for 37 years after Peggy Guggenheim's death, until 2017.&lt;ref name=Directors&gt;[https://www.guggenheim.org/press-release/the-solomon-r-guggenheim-foundation-appoints-karole-p-b-vail-to-lead-the-peggy-guggenheim-collection "The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation Appoints Karole P.B. Vail to Lead the Peggy Guggenheim Collection"], Guggenheim.org, June 8, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed the first Director of the collection in 2000,&lt;ref name=rylands&gt;[http://www.artforbusiness.it/forum2008/eng/rylands.html "Philip Rylands"], Art for Business, accessed 10 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2017 he became Director Emeritus.&lt;ref name=Directors/&gt; In 2017, Peggy Guggenheim's granddaughter, [[Karole Vail|Karole P.B. Vail]], succeeded Rylands after having been a curator at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] in New York since 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Gareth. [http://theartnewspaper.com/news/museums/peggy-guggenheim-s-granddaughter-takes-the-reins-at-the-late-collector-s-venetian-museum "Peggy Guggenheim’s granddaughter takes the reins at the late collector’s Venetian museum"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170611083413/http://theartnewspaper.com/news/museums/peggy-guggenheim-s-granddaughter-takes-the-reins-at-the-late-collector-s-venetian-museum/ |date=2017-06-11 }}, ''[[The Art Newspaper]]'', June 8, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.guggenheim.org/staff/karole-vail "Karole Vail"], Guggenheim.org, accessed 30 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2012, the collection was the most visited art gallery in Venice and the 11th most visited in Italy.&lt;ref name=rylands/&gt;

==Lawsuits==
Since 1992, Peggy Guggenheim's grandson, Sandro Rumney, together with his children and some cousins, have raised several disputes with the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation. The disputes concern, in part, the difference in language between Guggenheim's unconditional 1976 deed of gift to the foundation, a 1969 letter, and a 1972 version of her will. The courts have found the deed binding.&lt;ref&gt;Ruiz, Cristina. [http://theartnewspaper.com/news/museums/guggenheim-s-latest-show-reignites-row "Peggy Guggenheim's great-grandchildren say New York exhibition violates her legacy"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170624090016/http://theartnewspaper.com/news/museums/guggenheim-s-latest-show-reignites-row/ |date=2017-06-24 }}, ''The Art Newspaper'', April 20, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, Rumney and two other grandsons, sued the foundation in Paris claiming, among other things, that the modernization of the collection did not comply with the letter and spirit of her wishes. In 1994, the court dismissed the claims and ordered the grandsons to pay the foundation court costs.&lt;ref name=VF2017&gt;Esterow, Milton. [http://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/01/the-legal-battle-over-peggy-guggenheim-art-collection "The Bitter Legal Battle over Peggy Guggenheim’s Blockbuster Art Collection"], ''Vanity Fair'', January 5, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the gift of approximately 80 works to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation by Hannelore and Rudolph Schulhof (a former trustee of the foundation) in 2012, some works collected by Guggenheim were removed from the Palazzo to make room for the display of the new works. The Schulhofs' names were inscribed alongside Guggenheim's at both entrances of the museum. Their son, Michael P. Schulhof, has been a trustee of the Guggenheim foundation since 2009. In 2014, several French descendants of Peggy Guggenheim, led by Rumney, sued the foundation for violating her will and agreements with the foundation, which they said require that her collection "remain intact and on display". They also claimed that the resting place of her ashes in the gardens of the Palazzo has been desecrated by the display of sculptures nearby, among other things. The lawsuit requested that the founder's bequest be revoked or that the collections, gravesite and signage be restored.&lt;ref name="Ruiz, McGivern" /&gt; Other descendants of Peggy Guggenheim supported the foundation's position.&lt;ref name=GLawsuit/&gt; In 2014, the court dismissed the claims and awarded the foundation legal fees. The court noted that the descendants had attended some of the parties held in the gardens by the foundation. In 2015, the Paris Court of Appeal dismissed the lawsuit and awarded the foundation additional legal fees.&lt;ref name=VF2017/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carvajal, Doreen. [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/09/23/peggy-guggenheims-kin-lose-bid-to-challenge-how-her-collection-is-displayed/ "Peggy Guggenheim’s Kin Lose Bid to Challenge How Her Collection Is Displayed"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 23, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Rumney stated his intention to continue to appeal.&lt;ref name=VF2017/&gt;

A '''reverse dictionary''' is a [[dictionary]] organized in a non-standard order (usually referring to being in a so-called "reverse" order) that provides the user with information that would be difficult to obtain from a traditionally alphabetized dictionary. There are two principal types of reverse dictionaries: reverse ''word'' dictionaries, and reverse ''concept'' dictionaries ([[conceptual dictionary]]). This article discusses reverse word dictionaries; see [[conceptual dictionary]] for reverse concept dictionaries.

Reverse dictionaries were historically difficult to produce before the advent of the electronic computer, but have become more common since 1974, when the first computer sorted reverse dictionary was published: Stahl and Scavnicky's ''A Reverse Dictionary of the Spanish Language''.&lt;ref name=stahl1974/&gt; A form of ''reverse dictionary'' is the ''suffix (word-listing) dictionary''.

==Definition==
The reverse word dictionary is a dictionary where the word entries in the dictionary are not alphabetized in the same manner as a traditional dictionary.  For example, ''A Reverse Dictionary of the Spanish Language''&lt;ref name=stahl1974&gt;Stahl, Fred A., Scavnicky, Gary E. A., ''A Reverse Dictionary of the Spanish Language'', University of Illinois Press, Urbana, IL,1974.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Walker's [[Rhyming]] Dictionary''&lt;ref&gt;Walker, John, ''The rhyming dictionary of the English language: in which the whole language is arranged according to its terminations ...'', Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; are reverse dictionaries, the organization of which is based upon sorting each entry word upon its last letter and the subsequent letters proceeding toward the beginning of that word. Consequently, in these reverse dictionaries all words that have the same [[suffix]] appear in order in the dictionary.  Such a reverse dictionary would be useful for linguists and poets who might be looking for words ending with a particular suffix, or by an anthropologist or forensics specialist examining a damaged text (e.g. a stone inscription, or a burned document) that had only the final portion of a particular word preserved. Reverse dictionaries of this type have been published for most major [[alphabet]]ical languages (see numerous examples listed below). By way of contrast, in a standard dictionary words are organized such that words with the same prefix appear in order, since the sorting order is starting with the first letter of the entry word and subsequent letters proceeding toward the end of that word.

==Applications==
Applications of reverse word dictionaries include:
* Simple rhyme dictionaries, to the extent that spelling predicts pronunciation.
* Finding words with a given [[suffix]] (i.e., meaningful ending), like ''-ment.''
* Finding words with the same ending as a given word, even if the sequence is not meaningful.
* Setting or solving [[word puzzle]]s, such as ''[[-gry]]'' or the earlier ''-dous'' puzzle (find words ending in some way), or [[crossword|crossword puzzles]].

==Construction==
Reverse word dictionaries are straightforward to construct, by simply sorting based on reversed words. This was labor-intensive and tedious before the advent of electronic computers, but is now straightforward. For example, using [[Perl]] and [[sort (Unix)|sort]] allows the following [[one-liner program]] to produce a reverse dictionary of the file "dict":
&lt;source lang="bash"&gt;
&lt; dict \
    perl -nle 'print scalar reverse $_' |\
    sort |\
    perl -nle 'print scalar reverse $_'
&lt;/source&gt;

Some sort utilities can sort on a reversed version of the sort key,&lt;ref&gt;http://billposer.org/Software/msort.html&lt;/ref&gt; making it easy to generate reverse dictionaries on the fly if the dictionary data is available in electronic form.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5083">'''Robert E. Lee Taylor, Jr.''' (June 8, 1913 &amp;ndash; July 2, 2009) was an [[United States|American]] publisher and chairman of the ''[[Philadelphia Bulletin]]'' in the years leading up to the paper's demise. He was jailed in 1963 for his refusal to testify before a grand jury about his paper's reporting, and was released after the [[Pennsylvania Supreme Court]] ruled that his actions were protected under the state's [[Shield laws in the United States|shield law]].

==Early life and education==
Taylor was born in [[Norfolk, Virginia]] and grew up in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]. He attended [[Princeton University]], graduating in 1935. Taylor started work at the ''Philadelphia Bulletin'' after graduating from college — where his uncle Robert McLean was publisher, and owned the paper together with his brothers and sisters — and worked at the paper for nearly 40 years, other than during [[World War II]], when he served in the [[United States Navy]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;Perez-Pena, Richard. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/07/business/media/07taylor.html "Robert E. L. Taylor, Philadelphia Newsman, Dies at 96"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 7, 2009. Accessed July 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Philadelphia Bulletin==
As the paper's president in 1963, he and other staff members at the Bulletin were ordered to testify before a [[grand jury]] investigating municipal corruption and demanded details of the sources for the paper's stories. Upon refusing, Taylor and city editor Earl Selby were held in jail for [[contempt of court]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; By a 6&amp;ndash;1 vote, the [[Supreme Court of Pennsylvania]] overturned the sentences to five days in jail and a fine of $1,000, ruling that the state's 1937 [[Shield laws in the United States|shield law]] covered documents and individuals. In his majority opinion, Chief Justice [[John C. Bell, Jr.]] stated that in cases where there is a doubt, "the statute must be liberally construed in favor of the newspaper and the media".&lt;ref&gt;Weart, William G.

Accessed July 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1964, McClean stepped down as publisher, having served in that position since 1961, with Taylor succeeding him as publisher and keeping his post as the paper's president.&lt;ref&gt;via ''[[Associated Press]]''. [https://www.nytimes.com/1964/03/10/archives/mclean-quits-as-publisher-of-the-philadelphia-bulletin.html "McLean Quits as Publisher Of The Philadelphia Bulletin"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 10, 1964. Accessed July 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the Bulletin's daily circulation of 700,000 made it the city's largest and one of the largest of all afternoon papers nationwide. The ascendancy of ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' combined with the loss of popularity of afternoon papers led to a significant drop in both advertisers and readership.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; McLean stepped down as chairman after 61 years at the paper in April 1975, and Taylor was named as his successor as chairman and chief executive officer, with William L. McLean 3rd named editor and publisher to succeed Taylor.&lt;ref&gt;Staff.

Accessed July 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In his role as chairman, he oversaw the paper's sale in 1981.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; The paper ceased publication as of January 29, 1982, after 135 years in business, having dominated its market for most of its life.&lt;ref&gt;Staff.

==Personal==
Taylor died at age 96 on July 2, 2009, at his home in [[Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania]]. He was survived by two daughters, a son, six grandchildren and one great-grandchild. His two marriages, to Leonore McAlpin Shiland and Jane Matthews Jackson, both ended with the death of his spouse.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

'''Russian Science Citation Index''' (Russian: Российский индекс научного цитирования (РИНЦ)) is a [[bibliographic database]] of [[scientific publication]]s in Russian. It accumulates more than 13 million publications of Russian authors, as well as information about citing these publications from more than 5000 Russian journals. The Russian Science Citation Index has been developed since 2005 by the Scientific Electronic Library eLIBRARY.RU. The information-analytical system Science Index is a search engine of this database; it offers a wide range of services for authors, research institutions and scientific publishers. It is designed not only for operational search for relevant bibliographic information, but is also as a powerful tool to assess the impact and effectiveness of research organizations, scientists, and the level of scientific journals, etc.

== Purpose ==
From 5000 Russian scientific journals only about 500 are presented in foreign databases (i.e. not more than 10%). Those are mainly translated journals. So far, the vast majority of Russian scientific publications remain "invisible" and not available online.  Russian Science Citation Index makes it real to objectively compare Russian journals with  the best international journals and brings them closer to researchers all over the world.

== Functionality ==
In Russia, this database is one of the main sources of information for evaluating the effectiveness of organizations involved in research. It allows to appraise: 
* Scientific capacity and effectiveness of research, and
* Publication activity
through the following indicators:
* The number of publications (including foreign scientific and technical journals, and local publications from the list of [[Higher Attestation Commission]]) of researchers from a particular scientific organization, divided by the number of researchers,
* The number of publications (registered in the Russian Science Citation Index) of researchers from a particular scientific organization, divided by the number of researchers, and
* Citation of researchers (registered in the Russian Science Citation Index) from a particular scientific organization, divided by the number of researchers.

'''Samuel S. Fleisher Art Memorial''', also known as '''Church of the Evangelists''' and '''St. Martin's College for Indigent Boys''', is a set of four buildings with a history that unites idealism or religious beliefs, service to the poor, and art.  Formerly an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] church in the working-class [[Bella Vista, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Bella Vista]] neighborhood of [[South Philadelphia]], it is best known as the home of the ''Graphic Sketch Club'' founded by Samuel S. Fleisher, which offers free art lessons to children and adults.

The four buildings include a [[campanile]] built in 1857, a basilica built 1884-1886, St. Martin's College built in 1906, and two rowhouses built in the 1850s.
Since Fleisher's death in 1944, his trust, which owns the buildings, has been administered by the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].  The Art Memorial was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1982 and is located at 711-721 Catharine St. in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].

==Church of the Evangelists==
[[File:Pulpit Fleisher Memorial.JPG|thumb|left|Pulpit in the church]]
The Church of the Evangelists was established as a mission church for the poor of Catherine Street in 1837, by Episcopalians named William Welsh and [[Horace Binney]], among others.  A church building was constructed in 1857 which includes the [[campanile]] which still stands. The church's viability became a concern by 1880, possibly because of the influx of non-Episcopal immigrants to the neighborhood.&lt;ref name="arch"/&gt;

Henry Robert Percival, a well-known [[high church]] Episcopal priest, revived the fortunes of the Church of the Evangelists when he was appointed rector about 1880.&lt;ref name="arch"&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.dot7.state.pa.us/ce/SelectWelcome.asp| title = National Historic Landmarks &amp; National Register of Historic Places in Pennsylvania| publisher = CRGIS: Cultural Resources Geographic Information System| format = Searchable database}} ''Note:'' This includes {{cite web| url = {{NRHP-PA|H000814_01H.pdf}}| title = National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: Samuel S. Fleisher Art Memorial| accessdate = 2012-05-14| author = Trina Vaux | format = PDF| date= June 1, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://anglicanhistory.org/usa/percival/index.html Henry Robert Percival]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Unfinished ornament Fleisher.JPG|thumb|left|Unfinished exterior decoration]]
The well-connected Percival had traveled in Italy and had "a sensibility which combined Italian and [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholic]] romanticisms."&lt;ref name="arch"/&gt; He wished to rebuild the church based on the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] models of [[St. Mark's Basilica]] in Venice, the [[Piazza dei Miracoli|Cathedral of Pisa]] and the [[Orvieto Cathedral]].  The 1884 design by the firm [[Frank Furness|Furness and Evans]] was in actuality based on [[Basilica di San Zeno|San Zeno Maggiore]] in [[Verona]].&lt;ref name="arch"/&gt;

[[Fresco]]s in the church were painted by [[Robert Henri]], [[Nicola D'Ascenzo]], and by local parishioners. Much of the interior decorative work was left unfinished. The influences on the architecture include "Italy, [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]], the [[ecclesiological movement]], and the pageantry of medieval Christianity."&lt;ref name="arch"/&gt;  James van Trump is more critical, stating that "a rather self-conscious coterie of late nineteenth century Philadelphia haute bourgeoisie, 'engaged', one might say in being 'Catholic', cultivated, and artistic."&lt;ref name="arch"/&gt;

While the church's original [[Wurlitzer]] pipe organ has fallen into disrepair, it remains in the sanctuary and is the last such factory-installed organ in Philadelphia in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Beck |first=Tom |date=September 21, 2018 |title=The hidden musical gem in the sanctuary of the Fleisher Art Memorial|url=https://southphillyreview.com/the-hidden-musical-gem-in-the-sanctuary-of-the-fleisher-art-memorial-8531ca90e94c |work=South Philly Review |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|access-date=2018-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Percival retired on account of illness in the 1890s, the church's fortunes declined. St. Martin's College for Indigent Boys was built in 1906, perhaps in an effort to fight the decline and better connect with the non-Episcopalian neighborhood.&lt;ref name="arch"/&gt;

==Art school==
Samuel Stewart Fleisher, the son of German Jewish immigrants, became vice-president of the family business after graduating from the [[Wharton School of Business]]. By that time the family business, the Fleisher Yarn Company, was a major manufacturer of hand-knitting yarns and worsted fabric. Fleisher was extraordinarily concerned for the welfare of the company's workers, their children, and others who lived in the neighborhood.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

{{Quote|Thousands of young people toil during the day whose lives are unavoidably cast upon a background of routine and sameness—the world’s work must be done—to them should be offered pastures where beauty and inspiration may be gathered, places where rich and poor alike may give expression to their finer emotions—playgrounds for the soul.|Samuel S. Fleisher&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;}}

Fleisher started offering free art classes to children in 1898 in the Jewish Union building at 422 Bainbridge Street. Later known as the Graphic Sketch Club, the institution gave free, non-competitive, collaborative classes to both children and adults without discrimination by race or nationality.  In 1906 it moved to a larger building at 740 Catharine Street, then in 1916 it moved across the street to Saint Martin's College for Indigent Boys. The church was purchased and converted into an art gallery in 1922.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;[http://www.fleisher.org/about/fleisher-bio.php History of Fleisher] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210133845/http://www.fleisher.org/about/fleisher-bio.php |date=2012-02-10 }}, accessed May 14, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, Fleisher died and left his estate in trust to the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] to continue the Graphic Sketch Club, which was renamed the Samuel S. Fleisher Art Memorial.  In 1983 it became a formally independent non-profit corporation with a separate board of trustees, but it is still managed by the Philadelphia Museum of Art.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

'''SeaLifeBase''' is a global online [[database]] of information about [[marine life]]. It aims to provide key information on the taxonomy, distribution and ecology of all marine [[species]] in the world apart from [[finfish]].&lt;ref name=FIN /&gt; SeaLifeBase is in partnership with the [[WorldFish Center]] in Malaysia and the  [[UBC Fisheries Centre]] at the University of British Columbia.&lt;ref name=FIN&gt;[http://www.fin.ph/current/7-sealifebase-slb.html SeaLifeBase (SLB ] FishBase Information and Research Group (FIN). Retrieved 22 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel Pauly]] is the principal investigator and it is coordinated by Maria Lourdes D. Palomares. {{As of|2016|10}}, it included descriptions of 74,000 species, 47,700 [[common name]]s, 12,400 pictures, and references to 31,700 works in the [[scientific literature]].&lt;ref&gt;According to the [http://www.sealifebase.org/ SeaLifeBase] web page, accessed 29 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; SeaLifeBase complements [[FishBase]], which provides parallel information for finfish.

==History==
The origins of SeaLifeBase go back to the 1970s, when the fisheries scientist [[Daniel Pauly]] found himself struggling to test a hypothesis on how the growing ability of fish was affected by the size of their gills.&lt;ref name=Bakun&gt;Bakun A (2011) [https://books.google.com/books?id=baUySByM5DIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Ecosystem+Approaches+to+Fisheries:+A+Global+Perspective&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=yQwwTunjOY6emQXOn5j_CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "The oxygen constraint"] Pages 11–23. In: Villy Christensen and Jay Maclean (Eds.) ''Ecosystem Approaches to Fisheries: A Global Perspective'', Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-13022-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Hypotheses, such as this one, could be tested only if large amounts of empirical data were available.&lt;ref name="Palomares and Bailly"&gt;Palomares MLD and Bailly N (2011) [https://books.google.com/books?id=baUySByM5DIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Ecosystem+Approaches+to+Fisheries:+A+Global+Perspective&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=yQwwTunjOY6emQXOn5j_CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Organizing and disseminating marine biodiversity information: the Fishbase and SeaLifeBase story"] Pages 24–46. In: Villy Christensen and Jay Maclean (Eds.) ''Ecosystem Approaches to Fisheries: A Global Perspective'', Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-13022-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, [[fisheries management]] used analytical models which required estimates for fish growth and [[Fish mortality|mortality]].&lt;ref&gt;Monro JL (2011) [https://books.google.com/books?id=baUySByM5DIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Ecosystem+Approaches+to+Fisheries:+A+Global+Perspective&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=yQwwTunjOY6emQXOn5j_CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Assessment of exploited stock of tropical fishes: an overview"] Pages 171–188. In: Villy Christensen and Jay Maclean (Eds.) ''Ecosystem Approaches to Fisheries: A Global Perspective'', Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-13022-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Pauly believed that the only practical way fisheries managers could access the volume of data they needed was to assemble all the data available in the published literature into some central repository.&lt;ref name="Palomares and Bailly" /&gt; This would mean that when a new hypothesis needs to be tested, the available data will already be there in a validated and accessible form, and there will be no need create a new dataset and then have to validate it.&lt;ref&gt;Froese R (2011) [https://books.google.com/books?id=baUySByM5DIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Ecosystem+Approaches+to+Fisheries:+A+Global+Perspective&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=yQwwTunjOY6emQXOn5j_CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "The science in FishBase"] Pages 47–54. In: Villy Christensen and Jay Maclean (Eds.) ''Ecosystem Approaches to Fisheries: A Global Perspective'', Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-13022-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Pauly recruited [[Rainer Froese]], and the beginnings of a software database along these lines was encoded in 1988. This database, initially confined to tropical fish, became the prototype for [[FishBase]]. FishBase was extended to cover all [[finfish]], and is now the largest online database for fish in the world.&lt;ref name="Palomares and Bailly" /&gt;

Given FishBase's success, there was naturally a demand for a database covering forms of aquatic life other than finfish. This resulted, in 2006, in the birth of SeaLifeBase.&lt;ref name="Palomares and Bailly" /&gt; The long-term goal of the project is develop an information system modelled on [[FishBase]], but including all forms of aquatic life, both marine and freshwater, apart from the finfish which FishBase specialises in. Altogether, there are about are 300,000 known species in this category&lt;ref name=home&gt;[http://www.sealifebase.org/ SeaLifeBase - home page] Accessed 23 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Shorter Oxford English Dictionary''''' ('''''SOED''''') is an [[English language]] [[dictionary]] published by the [[Oxford University Press]].  The SOED is a two-volume [[abridgement]] of the twenty-volume ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (''OED'').   

==Print Editions==
===Prequel===
The first editor, William Little, worked on the book from 1902 until his death in 1922.  The dictionary was completed by H. W. Fowler, Jessie Coulson, and C. T. Onions. An abridgement of the complete work was contemplated from 1879, when the [[Oxford University Press]] took over from the [[Philological Society]] on what was then known as ''A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles''.  However, no action was taken until 1902, when the work was begun by William Little, a fellow of [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford]]. He laboured until his death in 1922, at which point he had completed "A" to "T" and "V". The remaining letters were completed by [[Henry Watson Fowler]] ("U", "X", "Y", and "Z") and Mrs. E. A. Coulson (Jessie Coulson) ("W") under the direction of [[Charles Talbut Onions]], who succeeded Little as editor. Onions wrote that ''SOED'' was "to present in miniature all the features of the principal work" and to be "a quintessence of those vast materials" in the complete OED.

===First Edition===
The first edition was published in February 1933. It was reprinted in March and April of that year and again in 1934.

===Fourth Edition===
The New SOED was prepared under the editorship of [[Lesley Brown (editor)|Lesley Brown]] 1980-1993 and was the first complete revision of the dictionary and should be considered a re-abridgement of the SOED and its supplements.  The whole text was completely revised for the Fourth Edition, which was published in 1993 as the ''New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary''.  The book attempted to include all English words which had substantial currency after 1700, plus the vocabulary of [[Shakespeare]], [[John Milton]], [[Edmund Spenser]] and the [[King James Version]].&lt;ref&gt;Oxford University Press, ''The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'', Fourth Edition, 1993, Preface&lt;/ref&gt; As a historical dictionary, it includes obsolete words if they are used by major authors and earlier meanings where they explain the development of a word. Headwords are traced back to their earliest usage. Includes 97,600 headwords, 25,250 variant spellings, 500,000 definitions, 87,400 illustrative quotations and 7,333 sources of quotations (including 5,519 individual authors).

===Sixth Edition===
On 21 September 2007, the Sixth Edition appeared. The dictionary now includes 600,000 words, phrases, and definitions, covering global English-speaking regions and 2500 new words and meanings from Oxford Dictionaries and Oxford English Corpus. As previously, the vocabulary includes entries in general English from 1700 to the present day and in earlier major literary works. The dictionary includes 80,000 quotations illustrating the use of words, thousands of newly discovered antedatings based on the continuing research for the OED, 2,500 new words and senses, thousands of antedatings of existing words from Oxford English Dictionary and Oxford English Corpus, many new quotations from recent authors, and a complete review of spelling forms and defining vocabulary. 

16,000 words lost their hyphen.&lt;ref name=SOED6preface/&gt; Angus Stevenson, the editor of the Shorter OED, stated the reason: "People are not confident about using hyphens anymore, they're not really sure what they are for." Its researchers reviewed a corpus of 2 billion words (in newspapers, books, web sites and blogs from 2000). Bumble-bee is now bumblebee, ice-cream is ice cream and pot-belly is pot belly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20925013/ |date=September 23, 2007 |last=Reuters |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007225223/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20925013/ |archivedate=2007-10-07 |publisher=MSNBC, |title=Hyphens perish as English marches on |accessdate=2007-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUSHAR15384620070921?sp=true Reuters, Thousands of hyphens perish as English marches on (Retrieved 18 May 2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Iraq demo in london.jpg|thumb|300px|The original display, which ''State Britain'' recreates.]]
'''State Britain''' is an [[Installation art|installation]] artwork by [[Mark Wallinger]] displayed in [[Tate Britain]] in January 2007. It is a recreation from scratch of a protest display about the treatment of Iraq, set up by [[Brian Haw]] outside [[Houses of Parliament|Parliament]] and eventually confiscated by the police. Haw's display contained several hundred items donated by members of the public. As well as continuing the protest, Wallinger's recreation in a different context also brings up questions of authenticity. Wallinger won the [[Turner Prize]] in 2007 for this piece.&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, Charlotte. [http://arts.guardian.co.uk/turnerprize2007/story/0,,2221321,00.html "Bear man walks away with Turner Prize"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 3 December 2007. Retrieved 3 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

''State Britain'' is a meticulous recreation of a 40-metre long display which had originally been situated around peace campaigner [[Brian Haw|Brian Haw's]] protest outside the [[Houses of Parliament]] against policies towards [[Iraq]].

[[Image:Abby Jackson. Foreign Policy 2000.jpg|thumb|''Foreign Policy 2000'' by [[Abby Jackson]], one of the images in Haw's display recreated by [[Mark Wallinger]] in ''State Britain''.]]

The original display consisted of over 600 items, many donations from the public, including paintings, placards, photos of families, banners, posters, graffiti, traffic cones, tarpaulins, temporary fencing and toys. These included a poster, "Blair Lies, Kids Die!", a banner, "Baby Killers", photos of babies maimed and burnt in missile attacks, a statement that parliament spent seven hours discussing the war in Iraq and 700 hours discussing fox-hunting, and a white teddy bear holding a sign, "Bears against bombs".&lt;ref name=januszczak&gt;Januszczak, Waldemar [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2101-2551422.html "What do we want?"] ''The Sunday Times'', 21 January 2007.

The original display, apart from a three-metre section, was confiscated by the police under the [[Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005]], which prohibits unauthorised protests in a specified "exclusion zone" around Parliament.

State Britain was meticulously researched and recreated by project lead Michelle Sadgrove (Pilkington) at Mike Smith Studio who sourced 15 artists from varying backgrounds and skillsets to work alongside her over a period of 6 months, exploring participant observation and using hundreds of photographs to match each item to the original protest display.  In all, over one thousand five hundred objects were created or sourced for the piece. It cost [[Tate Britain]] £90,000 as part of their exhibition programme and was installed inside the Duveen Hall of [[Tate Britain]] in January 2007. Signs at all the entrances to the hall warn that the exhibit contains images of extreme human suffering.  Michelle has since led teams of technicians installing the work at Mac/Val Paris, Aargauer Kunsthaus, Switzerland, Der Kunstverein Seit 1817 Hamburg, Museum De Pont Tilburg Netherlands and ZKM Karlsruhe Germany.

''The Sunday Times'' saw the show as more indication that the arts establishment had turned against the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government. It contrasted Tate director [[Nicholas Serota|Sir Nicholas Serota]]'s endorsement of Wallinger's show with the private tour of [[Tate Modern]] Serota had given to [[Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] in 2000.&lt;ref name=bomb/&gt; At that time Blair's government had courted [[Young British Artists]] such as [[Tracey Emin]] and [[Damien Hirst]] to help "modernise" Britain.&lt;ref name=bomb/&gt;

''State Britain'' was curated in collaboration with Wallinger by Tate curator, Clarrie Wallis.&lt;ref name=pressrelease&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/about/pressoffice/pressreleases/2007/8401.htm "State Britain by Mark Wallinger"] Tate press release, 15 January 2007. Accessed 3 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It was on show until 27 August 2007.

Wallinger was shortlisted for the [[Turner Prize]] on 8 May 2007 for ''State Britain'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6634501.stm "Anti-war art on Turner shortlist, BBC"] Accessed 8 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and announced the winner on 3 December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Nigel. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/12/03/baturner104.xml "Mark Wallinger wins 2007 Turner Prize"], ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', 3 December 2007. Retrieved 4 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exclusion zone==
The Tate press release on the exhibition mentioned that the [[Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005]] prohibited "unauthorised demonstrations within a one kilometre radius of Parliament Square" and that this radius passed through the Duveen Hall, bisecting Wallinger's exhibit.&lt;ref name=pressrelease/&gt; Wallinger marked this on the floor with a black line running through the Tate. Initial press reports dwelt on the potential dangers of this infringement, speculating that the police might even remove the half of the exhibit on the "wrong side of the line".&lt;ref name=teeman&gt;Teeman, Tim [http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,14936-2548700.html "State Britain"] ''The Times'', 16 January 2007. Accessed online 3 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]] of the [[Stuckism|Stuckists]] pointed out the exclusion zone ended at Thorney Street, 300 yards before the Tate.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, Charles [https://www.theguardian.com/letters/story/0,,1993865,00.html "As we like it"] ''The Guardian'' 19 January 2007. Accessed online 3 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The one kilometre radius is the maximum possible, but not actual, area of the designated zone, which is mapped out by particular streets.

==Critiques==
[[Image:brian-haw.jpg|thumb|[[Brian Haw]]]]
A few days before the opening of the exhibit, Brian Haw said he knew nothing about it, but that "What we had ... were pieces of art."&lt;ref name=bomb/&gt; He was invited to view the work while it was being installed and was pleased with the result.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Maev [http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1991288,00.html "Tate's anti-war display crosses legal line into no-protest zone"] ''[[The Guardian]]'', 16 January 2007. Accessed 4 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Tim Teeman commented that Wallinger created the exhibit not only to bring what he perceives as a dangerous erosion of civil liberties to light, but also to examine whether the installation was art or politics; Teeman concluded that it was obviously both.&lt;ref name=teeman/&gt; [[Waldemar Januszczak]] commented on "a cheeky intervention that raises lots of interesting questions," but that these were about "issues of originality and authenticity", rather than the original political intent of the display.&lt;ref name=januszczak/&gt; [[Edward Lucie-Smith]] called it "official art" and considered that Haw, not Wallinger, should receive the credit.&lt;ref&gt;Lucie-Smith, Edward [http://www.stuckism.com/Tate/WallingerStateBritain.html "Edward Lucie-Smith exclusive post to this site (17.1.06)"] stuckism.com.

A '''strike notice''' (or '''notice to strike''') is a document served by members of a [[trade union]] or an analogous body of workers to an employer or negotiator stating an intent to commit an upcoming [[strike action]]. The document largely contains:

* an overview of [[Grievance (labour)|grievances]] and conditions
* a statement that negotiations with the employer have failed
* an intended time and duration for the strike
* advice to prepare for the impact of the strike and return to the negotiating table at the earliest

A strike notice is usually issued to an employer or negotiators after union leadership and participating workers have agreed on the set terms of a strike action. In contrast, a [[wildcat strike action]] usually involves workers going on strike without the approval of union leadership or the serving of a notice. 

Strike notices are often legally required of public sector workers or unions within a specific period (i.e., 10 days before the intended strike action commencement).

'''''The Kite''''' ({{lang-fr|Le Cerf-volant}}, {{lang-ar|Tayyara men wara}} – طيّارة من ورق) is a 2003 [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] [[film]] by the director [[Randa Chahal Sabag]]. It tells the story of a fifteen-year-old Lebanese girl, from a [[Druze]] community, who is forced to marry her cousin across the Israeli border, but finds herself in love with an Israeli soldier. ''Le Cerf-volant'' was Sabag's most commercially and critically successful movie, and her last; she died in 2008.&lt;ref name="DailyStar"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Culture/Art/2008/Aug-27/120313-award-winning-filmmaker-randa-chahal-sabag-passes-away-in-paris.ashx | title=Award-winning filmmaker Randa Chahal Sabag passes away in Paris | publisher=The Daily Star | date=27 August 2008 | accessdate=12 December 2014 | author=Quilty, Jim}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was Lebanon's [[List of Lebanese submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|official submission]] for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[76th Academy Awards]].&lt;ref name="nitrate"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nitrateonline.com/2004/rkite.html | title=The Kite | publisher=Nitrate Online | date=16 January 2004 | accessdate=12 December 2014 | author=Lybarger, Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it never received a theatrical release in the United States, the film was released to DVD in 2009 by [[First Run Features]].&lt;ref name="IFC"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ifc.com/fix/2009/04/the-kite-on-dvd | title=A Tragicomedy, Split Down Its Center | publisher=IFC | date=14 April 2009 | accessdate=12 December 2014 | author=Atkinson, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Plot==
The Kite is set in a village called [[Deir Mimas]] over the border of the pre-occupied territories in southern Lebanon (occupied by [[Israel]]). The 16-year-old Lebanese girl Lamia ([[Flavia Bechara]]) lives with her family in the village. Her family had promised to marry her off to her cousin Samy (Edmond Haddad), who lives on the Israeli side. Lamia's mother, Amira (Randa Asmar) was dejected and unwilling to send her daughter away because that meant that Lamia could never come back because of the tense political situation at the border.

Lamia, too, is completely reluctant to agree to the marriage because she has never seen him nor does she love him. She is simply a naïve young teenager who has no idea about marriage. Similarly, Samy was not much interested in marrying his cousin either; however, he agreed to the marriage because he thought it would help Lamia escape her village.

To conduct the wedding, since there is a [[No man's land|no-man's land]] between the Lebanon side and Israel side, they communicate with each other through megaphones and can only see each other through binoculars. Before the marriage, Lamia had to get a pass from the authorities to cross the border. The day of the wedding, the entire village gathers at the border gates to witness Lamia being sent across the border. On the Israeli side, people wave a white flag as a signal to start. Lamia hugs her family and starts her long walk towards the Israeli border in her majestic wedding gown and a lone bouquet. She keeps looking back, knowing that she may never return.

Meanwhile, the movie reveals that an Israeli soldier, Youssef (Maher Bsaibes), stationed at the border is in love with Lamia. After Lamia comes to live in Samy's house, she barely eats or sleeps or talks; this goes on for 20 days. Later, during an argument with her husband, Lamia tells him that she loves someone else, who turns out to be Youssef. Samy's family gets frustrated with Lamia and takes her to the border so that she can talk to her mother. Lamia is given binoculars, but instead of looking at her mother, she turns to look at Youssef and exchanges smiles with him. Both families fume at this and her binoculars are taken away.

Because of her continuous unpleasant behavior, Lamia becomes unwanted in Samy's house and she is forced to go back. Samy warns Lamia that no one else would want her anymore if he divorces her and she would be alone forever. Lamia faces a great dilemma because she does not want to be with her husband but she does not want to go back either (because of Youssef).

Unfortunately, Lamia returns to Deir Mimas, to her and the soldier's utter disappointment. She becomes a subject of insult in her home village, which is seen when a shop-owner does not accept money from her, calling it "money of dishonor".

The ending of the movie has been purposely left vague and open to interpretation. It appears like a dream or surreal scene where Lamia magically crosses the fence of the border and finally gets to be with Youssef.

==Reception==
''The Kite'' was Sabag's biggest commercial and critical success,&lt;ref name="DailyStar"/&gt; with generally positive reviews. Nitrate Online described it as a story of "life and love in the middle of conflict" with a "refreshingly original appeal that crosses some formidable barriers",&lt;ref name="nitrate"/&gt; while Strictly Film School called it a "poignant, humorous, and exquisitely realized" film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.filmref.com/journal2004.html#kite | title=Notes from Human Rights Watch International Film Festival 2004 at the Walter Reade. | publisher=Filmref.com | date=2004 | accessdate=12 December 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141227125240/http://www.filmref.com/journal2004.html#kite | archivedate=27 December 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Less than a year after Sabag's death, when the film was out on DVD, [[Michael Atkinson (writer)|Michael Atkinson]] described it on [[IFC (U.S. TV network)|IFC.com]] as a "tragicomedy" and "[[Absurdism|absurdist]]" film, and wrote that the director's tone was "gentle and generous", except for a single scene involving the discovery of an aborted fetus which he described as "tasteless". Atkinson added that Sabag considered the points of view of each character in the film, even that of the Israeli officers.&lt;ref name="IFC"/&gt;

When Sabag won the Silver Lion, the [[Beirut]]-based ''[[The Daily Star (Lebanon)|Daily Star]]'' called the occasion "a triumph for Lebanese film". The [[World Press Review]] described this kind of reception as "a radical departure from the hostile press the controversial filmmaker (Sabag) once received".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://worldpress.org/Mideast/1803.cfm# | title=Lebanese Filmmaker: Randa Chahal Sabbag | author=Hoang, Mai | journal=World Press Review |date=March 2004  | volume=51 | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cineuropa said that despite the subject of the story being tragic, Sabag tried to deal with it using irony and managed to "triumph life, love and imagination" at the end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cineuropa.org/nw.aspx?t=newsdetail&amp;l=en&amp;did=36913 | title=In Competition - The Kite | publisher=Cineuropa | date=30 August 2003 | accessdate=14 December 2014 | author=Menzione, Paolo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both male and female critics on the French film blog ''L'Oil sur L'Ecran'' gave it 4 out of 5 stars, with one of them noting that the film was reminiscent of [[Elia Suleiman]]'s 2002 film ''[[Divine Intervention (film)|Divine Intervention]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{link language|fr}} {{cite web | url=http://films.blog.lemonde.fr/2005/03/29/2005_03_cerf_volant/ | title=" Le cerf-volant " (2003) de Randa Chahal Sabag | publisher=L'Oeil sur L'Ecran | date=29 March 2005 | accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The QI Book of the Dead''''' (sold as ''The Book of the Dead'' in the United States) is the fourth title in a series of books based on the intellectual British [[panel game]] ''[[QI]]'', written by series-creator [[John Lloyd (writer)|John Lloyd]] and head-researcher [[John Mitchinson (researcher)|John Mitchinson]]. It is a book of "quite interesting" [[obituary|obituaries]].

==Publication history==
''The QI Book of the Dead'' was first published by [[Faber and Faber]] in hardback on 5 November 2009.&lt;ref name="BCG"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Ian|url=http://www.comedy.org.uk/guide/tv/qi/buy/|title='QI' Merchandise|publisher=British Comedy Guide|accessdate=14 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of the book originated before the television series ''QI'' was broadcast. Mitchinson wrote in an article for the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper that, "It first appeared on one of our "how to make life more interesting" lists at a time when [[Stephen Fry]]'s erudite put-downs and the [[anteater]] impressions of [[Alan Davies]] weren't even gleams in Lloyd's eye."&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mitchinson|first=John|authorlink=John Mitchinson (researcher)|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/qi/6636935/QI-Book-of-the-Dead---exclusive-extracts-from-the-brains-behind-the-tv-show.html|title=QI Book of the Dead - exclusive extracts from the brains behind the tv show|publisher=''[[Daily Telegraph]]''|date=24 November 2009|accessdate=24 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The book is divided into 10 chapters, covering 68 different people.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; However, instead of dividing the chapters into subjects normally found in such books, like "Royalty", "Scientists" and "Sportsmen", ''The QI Book of the Dead'' uses "more diverting categories". Examples include "There's Nothing Like a Bad Start in Life", covering people who had bad childhoods; "Man Cannot Live by Bread Alone", about people with unusual diets; and "Is That All There Is?" about people interested in [[Afterlife|life after death]].&lt;ref name="BCG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt;

==Reception==
Ian Wolf for the [[British Comedy Guide]] was mostly positive with his review, saying: "''The QI Book of the Dead'' is definitely an enjoyable read, and makes for a great gift idea. For one thing, it allows us to look back and learn on the mistakes of our ancestors. Amongst those ancestors are [[Confucius]] and [[Nefertiti]], whom everyone in the world is related to... interesting, isn't it!"&lt;ref name="BCG review"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Ian|url=http://www.comedy.org.uk/guide/tv/qi/special/book_of_the_dead_review/|title=The QI Book of the Dead Review|publisher=[[British Comedy Guide]]|date=1 December 2009|accessdate=1 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Wolf also wrote that the book made mistakes. He wrote that the book wrongly claimed that [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|Lord Shelburne]] was [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], when in fact he was [[First Lord of the Treasury]], with the title of "Prime Minister" not being used to describe the leader of the British government until a century after Shelburne died by [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]].&lt;ref name="BCG review"/&gt;

[[File:Whitaker's 2018.jpg|thumb|right|Front cover]]

'''''Whitaker's''''' is a [[almanac|reference book, published annually]] in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name ="American Political Science Review 1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="The Burlington Magazine 1915"/&gt; The book was originally published by J Whitaker &amp; Sons from 1868 to 1997, then by [[The Stationery Office]] until 2003, and then by [[A &amp; C Black]] which became a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Bloomsbury Publishing]] in 2011. The 150th edition of ''Whitaker's'' was published on 16 November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bloomsbury.com/uk/whitakers-2018-9781472935021/|title=Whitaker's 2018|last=Bloomsbury.com|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First publication==
[[Joseph Whitaker (publisher)|Joseph Whitaker]] began preparing his Almanack in the autumn of 1868. He postponed publication of the first edition on learning of the resignation of [[Benjamin Disraeli]] on 1 December 1868, so that he could include details of the new [[First Gladstone Ministry|Gladstone administration]]. At the same time, Whitaker continued to expand the information so that the initially planned 329 pages grew to 370. The first edition of the Almanack appeared on 23 December 1868,&lt;ref&gt;"Whitaker's Almanack" (advertisement), ''The Times'', 21 December 1868, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; priced at 1 [[Shilling (British coin)|shilling]], introduced by a short editorial piece written by Joseph Whitaker. It began "The Editor does not put forward this Almanack as perfect: yet he ventures to think that he has succeeded in preparing a work which will commend itself to those who desire to see improvement in this direction." It concluded by inviting critics to suggest ways in which improvements could be made.&lt;ref&gt;"Advertisement", "An Almanack For the Year of Our Lord 1869. By Joseph Whitaker.", J. Whitaker, 1868, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[The Guardian|Manchester Guardian]]'', reviewing the first edition, described it as "the largest of the cheap almanacks" to appear, and noted it contained a great deal more valuable information than other such works.&lt;ref&gt;"Almanacks", ''Manchester Guardian'', 27 December 1868, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the 2014 edition became the first to be published under the new simpler branding of "''Whitaker's''".

==Content==
''Whitaker's Almanack'' consists of articles, lists and tables on a wide range of subjects including [[education]], the [[peerage]], [[government]] departments, health and social issues, and the [[Social environment|environment]].

The largest section is the countries directory, which includes recent [[history]], [[politics]], economic information and culture overviews. Each edition also features a selection of critical essays focusing on events of the previous year. Extensive [[Astronomy|astronomical]] data covering the forthcoming year is published at the rear of the book.

''Whitaker's Almanack'' is not an [[encyclopaedia]] but more of a [[yearbook]] of contemporary matters and a directory of various establishments in the [[UK]] (such as clubs, public bodies and [[universities]]).

Whitaker's was prized enough that [[Winston Churchill]] took a personal interest in the continued publication of the book after its [[headquarters]] were destroyed in [[The Blitz]]; a copy is also sealed in [[Cleopatra's Needle (London)|Cleopatra's Needle]] on the north bank of the [[River Thames]].

==Formats==
Each year the ''Almanack'' is published in two formats – the Standard Edition and a shortened Concise Edition. In previous years, a larger-format of the Standard Edition, [[Bookbinding|bound]] in [[leather]], was produced for [[libraries]]. Both editions were redesigned in 1993 and 2004 to increase the page size and improve legibility.

==Editors==
The ''Almanack'''s current Executive Editor is Ruth Northey, whilst former editor Hilary Marsden continues to contribute.

===Editors since 1868===
There have been nine editors since 1868:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |edition= Facsimile|title= Whitaker's Almanack 1900|url= |accessdate= |year= 1999|publisher= [[The Stationery Office]]|location= London|isbn= 0-11-702247-0|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |authorlink= |title= Whitaker's Almanack 2016|url= http://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/whitakers-2016-9781472909305/|accessdate= |year= |publisher=[[A &amp; C Black]] |location= London|isbn= 978-1-4729-0930-5|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Whitaker's Almanack" the space devoted last year to "The World's Peace" and " Proceedings of the Hague Tribunal " has this year been given up to an account of the origins of "The Great War", which we commend to our readers' attention. We note with approval the omission of the Emperor William's and the Crown Prince's name, with those of other belligerents, from the list of [[Order of the Garter|Knights of the Garter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Wulfsen horse burial'''  is an [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval]] [[horse burial]], consisting of three [[horse]]s, that was discovered in 1974 in a [[Saxons|Saxon]] [[grave field]] in the village of [[Wulfsen]], in the German district of [[Harburg, Hamburg|Harburg]]. The [[Feature (archaeology)|find]] was [[Rescue archaeology|rescued]] as a [[varnish profile]], which is on display in the permanent exhibition of the [[Archäologisches Museum Hamburg|Archaeological Museum Hamburg]] in [[Harburg, Hamburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Topic Death, Show case no. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Articus"&gt;{{cite book | last1 =Articus | first1 =Rüdiger  | last2 =Brandt | first2 =Jochen | last3 =Först | first3 =Elke | last4 =Krause | first4 =Yvonne | last5 =Merkel | first5 =Michael | last6 =Mertens | first6 =Kathrin | last7 =Weiss | first7 =Rainer-Maria | title =Archaeological Museum Hamburg Helms-Museum: A short guide to the Tour of the Times | series = Archaeological Museum Hamburg publication | volume =103 | edition = | year =2013 | location = Hamburg | pages =158 | isbn =978-3-931429-24-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery ==
The [[archaeological site]] was located on the northeastern escarpment of a sand pit near Wulfsen. In summer of 1974 a [[fossil]] collector observed a discoloration of the soil, which he considered of archaeological interest. He reported his observation to the Museum of the Principality of Lüneburg, which forwarded the message to the Helms-Museum in Hamburg-Harburg being the archaeological authority for the region. An [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] was conducted on the already disturbed burial site, which unearthed 35 human burials and the horse burial, containing the three horses. Due to the sandy soil, preservation of the burials was relatively poor. In total 26 older burials, oriented in north-south direction and nine younger burials oriented in east-west direction were excavated. Except for two [[arrowhead]]s in a young person's [[grave]], no other [[grave goods]] were observed.&lt;ref name="Ahrens"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ahrens | first = Claus | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =  Ein neues spätsächsisches Gräberfeld mit Dreifach-Pferdebestattung bei Wulfsen, Kreis Harburg | journal = Hammaburg N.F. | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 119–124 | publisher = | location = | year = 1975 | language = German | url = | jstor = | issn = 0173-0886  | doi = | id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Horse burial ==
The three horses were buried in a steep-walled pit of {{Convert|230|cm|in}} by {{Convert|240|cm|in}}. The bodies of the animals were fully decomposed, only [[bone]]s and [[teeth]] remaining, but the bones were very brittle and fragile. Offerings or grave goods such as [[bridle]]s were not detected. All the horses were lying on their left side, orientated in south–north direction. Their heads were placed in an upright posture on an elevated part of the pit. The middle horse was lying with its [[abdomen]] in a [[ventral]] position. The [[leg]]s of the middle and eastern animal were sharply [[Flexion|flexed]]. The legs of the western horse were lying in a half-[[Extension (kinesiology)|extended]] position; it occupied about half of the pit's space. By use of a working platform, the bones were carefully exposed and soaked with cold [[glue]], the pit was then laminated with [[lacquer]] and [[crêpe paper]]. The single bones were further secured with wires and pins. Then the pit was filled with a construction [[foam]], secured in a wooden crate and recovered as a block. The entire object consists of a prepared sand layer of about {{Convert|3|mm|in}} to {{Convert|4|mm|in}} millimeters thickness with the embedded bone.&lt;ref name="Ahrens"/&gt; The poor preservation of the bones complicated [[Zoology|zoological]] investigations. The western horse was likely a [[mare]], the others [[stallion]]s. Their [[withers]] has been between {{Convert|130|cm|in}} and {{Convert|140|cm|in}}, which is relatively small compared to today's standards, but was average for those days. The ages of the animals have been determined between five and seven years.&lt;ref name="Reichenstein"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Reichenstein | first = Hans | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Bemerkungen zu der Pferdebestattung von Wulfsen aus zoologisch-haustierkundlicher Sicht | journal = Hammaburg N.F. | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 125–126 | publisher = | location = | year = 1975 | language = German | url = | jstor = | issn = 0173-0886  | doi = | id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretation ==
[[Image:Lego Wulfsen horse burial.jpg|thumb|The excavation of the Wulfsen horse burial as a [[LEGO]] miniature]]
Based on evidence such as mortuary practice, the geographical orientation of remains and their grave goods, the burial was dated to 700–800&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref name="Ahrens"/&gt; The younger burials especially are dated to a period shortly before the wide [[Christianization]] of the region, which resulted in fundamental changes of burial practices. The [[horse burial]] could not be clearly assigned to one of the warrior's graves, therefore it is unclear whether was an individual burial of the animals or it was an addition to one of the human interments. Funerals of animals, especially of individual horses are well known from many grave fields of the Early Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="Ahrens"/&gt; Similar burial sites have been found in [[Suffolk]], England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.angelcynnreenactmentsociety.org.uk/home/anglo-saxon-horseman-s-grave-in-suffolk| title = Anglo Saxon Horseman's Grave in Suffolk| work = Angelcynn Re-Enactment Society  | accessdate = 2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Triple horse burials, for example, were discovered near [[Griefstedt]] ([[Sömmerda (district)]]) in [[Thuringia]] and [[Beckum, Germany|Beckum]] ([[Warendorf (district)]]) in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], but for north-eastern Lower-Saxony it is unprecedented.&lt;ref name="Ahrens"/&gt;

A [[LEGO]] miniature of the excavation of Wulfsen horse burial was built in 2013 for the special exhibition ''LEGO Zeitreise'' (LEGO time travel) of Archäologische Museum Hamburg.
