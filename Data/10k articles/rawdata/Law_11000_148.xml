{{United Kingdom constitutional formation}}
The '''Acts of Union''' were two [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]]: the '''Union with Scotland Act 1706''' passed by the [[Parliament of England]], and the '''Union with England Act''' passed in 1707 by the [[Parliament of Scotland]]. They put into effect the terms of the [[Treaty of Union]] that had been agreed on 22 July 1706, following negotiation between commissioners representing the parliaments of the two countries. By the two Acts, the [[Kingdom of England]] and the [[Kingdom of Scotland]]{{mdash}}which at the time were separate [[sovereign state|states]] with separate legislatures, but [[Personal union|with the same monarch]]{{mdash}}were, in the words of the Treaty, "United into One Kingdom by the Name of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]".&lt;ref&gt;Article I of the Treaty of Union&lt;/ref&gt;

The two countries had shared a monarch since the [[Union of the Crowns]] in 1603, when [[King James VI of Scotland]] inherited the English throne from his [[double first cousin]] twice removed, [[Queen Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]]. Although described as a Union of Crowns, until 1707 there were in fact two separate Crowns resting on the same head (as opposed to the implied creation of a single Crown and a single Kingdom, exemplified by the later [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]). Prior to the Acts of Union there had been three previous attempts (in 1606, 1667, and 1689) to unite the two countries by Acts of Parliament, but it was not until the early 18th century that both political establishments came to support the idea, albeit for different reasons.

The Acts took effect on 1 May 1707. On this date, the Scottish Parliament and the English Parliament united to form the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], based in the [[Palace of Westminster]] in London, the home of the English Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Act of Union 1707|Act of Union 1707]], Article 3&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the Acts are referred to as the '''Union of the Parliaments'''. On the Union, the historian [[Simon Schama]] said "What began as a hostile merger, would end in a full partnership in the most powerful going concern in the world ... it was one of the most astonishing transformations in European history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Britannia Incorporated|series= A History of Britain |serieslink= Simon Schama's A History of Britain |credits= [[Simon Schama]] (presenter) |network= [[BBC One]] |airdate= 22 May 2001 |number=10 |minutes=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical background ==
[[File:Union flag 1606 (Kings Colors).svg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|The first [[Union flag]], created by James VI and I. A separate version was used in Scotland during the 17th century.]]
=== Pre-1707 attempts at Union ===
Despite attempts by [[Edward_I_of_England|Edward I]] to conquer [[Scotland]] in the late 13th and early 14th centuries, the two countries were entirely separate. However, when [[Elizabeth_I_of_England|Elizabeth I]] became Queen of England in 1558, a union became increasingly likely as she neither married or had children. From 1558 onwards, her heir was her Catholic cousin [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] who pledged herself to a peaceful union between the two kingdoms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abdn.ac.uk/historic/actsofunion/panel2.php ABDN.ac.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1567, Mary was forced to abdicate as Queen of Scots and replaced by her infant son [[James VI and I]], who was brought up as a Protestant and became heir to the English throne. After Elizabeth died in 1603, the two Crowns were held in personal union by James and his Stuart successors but England and Scotland remained separate entities.

==== 1603–1639 ====
When James became King of England in 1603, the creation of a unified Church of Scotland and England governed by bishops was the first step in his vision of a centralised, Unionist state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stephen|first1=Jeffrey|title=Scottish Nationalism and Stuart Unionism|journal=Journal of British Studies|date=January 2010|volume=49|issue=1, Scottish Special|pages=55–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his accession, he announced his intention to unite the two realms so he would not be "guilty of bigamy;" he used the [[royal prerogative in the United Kingdom|royal prerogative]] to take the title "King of Great Britain"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor-last=Larkin |editor-first=James F.|editor2-last=Hughes |editor2-first=Paul L.|title=Stuart Royal Proclamations: Volume I |location= |publisher=Clarendon Press |year=1973 |page=19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and give a British character to his court and person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=R. |last=Lockyer |title=James VI and I |location=London |publisher=Addison Wesley Longman |year=1998 |pages=51–52 |isbn=978-0-582-27962-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:The Signing of the National Covenant in Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|left|Scottish opposition to Stuart attempts to impose religious union led to the 1638 National Covenant]]
The 1603 [[Union of England and Scotland Act 1603|Union of England and Scotland Act]] established a joint Commission to agree terms but the [[English Parliament]] was concerned this would lead to the imposition of an [[absolute monarchy|absolutist]] structure similar to that of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Lockyer, ''op. cit.'', pp. 54–59&lt;/ref&gt; James dropped his policy of a speedy union, the topic disappeared from the legislative agenda while attempts to revive it in 1610 were met with hostility.&lt;ref&gt;Lockyer, ''op. cit.'', p.59&lt;/ref&gt; 

This did not mean James abandoned the idea; 17th-century religion and politics were closely linked and he viewed a unified Church of Scotland and England as the first step towards a centralised, Unionist state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stephen|first1=Jeffrey|title=Scottish Nationalism and Stuart Unionism|journal=Journal of British Studies|date=January 2010|volume=49|issue=1, Scottish Special|pages=55–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem was that the two churches were very different in both structure and doctrine; Scottish bishops presided over Presbyterian structures but were doctrinal [[Calvinists]] who viewed many [[Church of England]] practices as little better than Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McDonald|first1=Alan|title=The Jacobean Kirk, 1567–1625: Sovereignty, Polity and Liturgy|date=1998|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1859283738|pages=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; The religious policies followed by James and his son [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] were intended as precursors to political union; resistance to this concept led to the 1638 [[Covenanter|National Covenant]] in Scotland and the 1639-1651 [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]].

==== 1639–1670 ====
{{Main article|Scotland under the Commonwealth}}
[[File:The Solemn League And Covenant.jpg|thumb|left|The 1643 [[Solemn League and Covenant]] between England and Scotland]]
The 1639–1640 [[Bishops' Wars]] confirmed the primacy of the Presbyterian [[Church of Scotland]] or kirk and established a [[Covenanter]] government in Scotland. The Scots remained neutral when the [[First English Civil War]] began in 1642, but grew concerned as to the impact of Royalist victory on Scotland after Parliamentary defeats in the first year of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kaplan |first1=Lawrence |title=Steps to War: The Scots and Parliament, 1642-1643 |journal=Journal of British Studies |date=May 1970 |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=50–70 |jstor=175155 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious union with England was also seen as the best way to preserve a Presbyterian kirk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robertson|first1=Barry|title=Royalists at War in Scotland and Ireland, 1638–1650|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1317061069 |page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The 1643 [[Solemn League and Covenant]] provided Scottish military support for the [[Parliament_of_England|English Parliament]] in return for a religious union between the [[Church of England]] and the kirk. While it referred repeatedly to 'union' between England, Scotland, and Ireland, it did not explicitly commit to political union which had little support even among their English supporters.
[[File:Cromwell at Dunbar Andrew Carrick Gow.jpg|thumb|right|[[Battle of Dunbar (1650)]]; Scotland was incorporated into the Commonwealth after defeat in the Anglo-Scots War.]]
Even religious union was fiercely opposed by the Episcopalian majority in the Church of England and [[Independent_(religion)|Independents]] like [[Oliver Cromwell]]. The Scots and English Presbyterians came to see the Independents who dominated the [[New Model Army]] as a bigger threat than the Royalists and when [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] surrendered in 1646, they agreed to restore him to the English throne. Both Royalists and Covenanters agreed the '''institution''' of monarchy was divinely ordered but disagreed on the nature and extent of Royal authority versus that of the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Tim|title=Rebellion: Britain's First Stuart Kings, 1567-1642|date=2015|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0198743118|pages=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Flag of The Commonwealth.svg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|[[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]]-era flag depicting the union between England and Scotland]]
After defeat in the 1647–1648 [[Second English Civil War]], Scotland was occupied by English troops which were withdrawn once the so-called [[Engagers]] whom Cromwell held responsible for the war had been replaced by the Kirk Party. In December 1648, [[Pride's Purge]] confirmed Cromwell's political control in England by removing Presbyterian MPs from Parliament and executing Charles in January 1649. Despite this, in February, the Kirk Party proclaimed [[Charles_II_of_England|Charles II]] King of Scotland and Great Britain; and agreed to restore him to the English throne. 

Defeat in the 1649–1651 [[Third_English_Civil_War|Third English Civil War or Anglo-Scottish War]] resulted in Scotland's incorporation into the [[Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland]], largely driven by Cromwell's determination to break the power of the kirk, which he held responsible for the Anglo-Scottish War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morrill|first1=John|title=Oliver Cromwell and the English Revolution|date=1990|publisher=Longman|isbn=978-0582016750|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1652 [[Tender of Union]] was followed on 12 April 1654 by ''An Ordinance by the Protector for the Union of England and Scotland,'' creating the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constitution.org/eng/conpur098.htm Constitution.org]&lt;/ref&gt; It was ratified by the [[Second Protectorate Parliament]] on 26 June 1657, creating a single Parliament in Westminster, with 30 representatives each from Scotland and Ireland added to the existing English members.&lt;ref&gt;The 1657 Act's long title was ''An Act and Declaration touching several Acts and Ordinances made since 20 April 1653, and before 3 September 1654, and other Acts''&lt;/ref&gt; 

While it established free trade within the Commonwealth, the economic benefits were diminished by the heavy taxation needed to fund the army.&lt;ref name="parliament.uk"&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/tk_02_cromwell.html Parliament.uk] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012160340/http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/tk_02_cromwell.html |date=12 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Scotland, Union was associated with military occupation, in England with heavy taxes and had little popular support in either country. It was dissolved by the 1660 [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of Charles II despite a petition by Scottish members of the Commonwealth [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] for its continuance. 

The Scottish economy was badly damaged by the English [[Navigation Acts]] of 1660 and 1663 and wars with the Dutch Republic, its major export market. An Anglo-Scots Trade Commission was set up in January 1668 but the English had no interest in making concessions, as the Scots had little to offer in return. In 1669, Charles II revived talks on political union; his motives were to weaken Scotland's commercial and political links with the Dutch, still seen as an enemy and complete the work of his grandfather James I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=MacIntosh |first1=Gillian |title=Scottish Parliament under Charles II, 1660-1685 |date=2007 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |isbn=978-0748624577 |pages=79–87 passim}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continued opposition in both England and Scotland meant that by the end of 1669, negotiations between Commissioners ground to a halt.&lt;ref&gt;C. Whatley, ''op. cit.'', p.95&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1670–1707 ====
Following the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, a [[Convention of the Estates of Scotland|Scottish Convention]] met in Edinburgh in April 1689 to agree a new constitutional settlement; during which the Scottish Bishops backed a proposed union in an attempt to preserve Episcopalian control of the kirk. [[William III of England|William]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary]] were supportive of the idea but it was opposed both by the Presbyterian majority in Scotland and the English Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lynch|first1=Michael|title=Scotland: a New History|date=1992|publisher=Pimlico Publishing|isbn=978-0712698931|page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Episcopacy in Scotland was abolished in 1690, alienating a significant part of the political class; it was this element that later formed the bedrock of opposition to Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Tim|title=Revolution: The Great Crisis of the British Monarchy, 1685-1720|date=2007|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0141016528|pages=404–406}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 1690s were a time of economic hardship in Europe as a whole and Scotland in particular, a period now known as the [[Seven ill years]] which led to strained relations with England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=C. |last=Whatley |title=The Scots and the Union |location=Edinburgh |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |year=2006 |page=91 |isbn=978-0-7486-1685-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1698, the [[Company of Scotland|Company of Scotland Trading to Africa and the Indies]] received a charter to raise capital through public subscription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mitchison|first1=Rosalind|title=A History of Scotland|date=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415278805|pages=301–2|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Company invested in the [[Darién scheme]], an ambitious plan funded almost entirely by Scottish investors to build a colony on the [[Isthmus of Panama]] for trade with East Asia.&lt;ref name=Richards2004p79&gt;E. Richards, ''Britannia's Children: Emigration from England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland since 1600'' (Continuum, 2004), {{ISBN|1852854413}}, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme was a disaster; the losses of over £150,000 severely impacted the Scottish commercial system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mitchison|first1=Rosalind|title=A History of Scotland|date=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415278805|page=314|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The financial losses incurred have often been suggested as one of the drivers behind Union.

=== Treaty and passage of the Acts of 1707 ===
[[File:Articles of Union 1707.jpg|thumb|left|"Articles of Union otherwise known as Treaty of Union", 1707]]
Deeper political integration had been a key policy of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] from the time she acceded to the throne in 1702. Under the aegis of the Queen and her ministers in both kingdoms, the parliaments of England and Scotland agreed to participate in fresh negotiations for a union treaty in 1705.

Both countries appointed 31 commissioners to conduct the negotiations. Most of the Scottish commissioners favoured union, and about half were government ministers and other officials. At the head of the list was Queensberry, and the [[Lord Chancellor of Scotland]], the [[Earl of Seafield]].&lt;ref name="commissioners"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/04_01_commissioners.html | title = The commissioners | publisher = UK Parliament website | year = 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090619224021/http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/04_01_commissioners.html | archivedate = 19 June 2009 | accessdate = 5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English commissioners included the [[Lord High Treasurer]], the [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin|Earl of Godolphin]], the [[Lord Keeper of the Great Seal|Lord Keeper]], [[William Cowper, 1st Earl Cowper|Baron Cowper]], and a large number of Whigs who supported union. Tories were not in favour of union and only one was represented among the commissioners.&lt;ref name="commissioners"/&gt;

Negotiations between the English and Scottish commissioners took place between 16 April and 22 July 1706 at the [[Cockpit-in-Court|Cockpit]] in London. Each side had its own particular concerns. Within a few days, England gained a guarantee that the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian]] dynasty would succeed Queen Anne to the Scottish crown, and Scotland received a guarantee of access to colonial markets, in the hope that they would be placed on an equal footing in terms of trade.&lt;ref name="negotiations"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/04_02_course.html | title = The course of negotiations | publisher = UK Parliament website | year = 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090721014514/http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/04_02_course.html | archivedate = 21 July 2009 | accessdate = 5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After negotiations ended in July 1706, the acts had to be ratified by both Parliaments. In Scotland, about 100 of the 227 members of the [[Parliament of Scotland]] were supportive of the [[Court Party]]. For extra votes the pro-court side could rely on about 25 members of the [[Squadrone Volante (Scotland)|Squadrone Volante]], led by the [[James Graham, 1st Duke of Montrose|Marquess of Montrose]] and the [[Duke of Roxburghe]]. Opponents of the court were generally known as the [[Country Party (Britain)|Country party]], and included various factions and individuals such as the [[Duke of Hamilton]], [[Lord Belhaven]] and [[Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun]], who spoke forcefully and passionately against the union. The Court party enjoyed significant funding from England and the Treasury and included many who had accumulated debts following the [[Darien Disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/05_ratification.html | title = Ratification | publisher = UK parliament website | year = 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090619224031/http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/05_ratification.html | archivedate = 19 June 2009 | accessdate = 5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Scotland, the [[James Douglas, 2nd Duke of Queensberry|Duke of Queensberry]] was largely responsible for the successful passage of the Union act by the [[Scottish Parliament]]. In Scotland, he received much criticism from local residents, but in England he was cheered for his action. He had received around half of the funding awarded by the Westminster treasury for himself. In April 1707, he travelled to London to attend celebrations at the royal court, and was greeted by groups of noblemen and gentry lined along the road. From [[Chipping Barnet|Barnet]], the route was lined with crowds of cheering people, and once he reached London a huge crowd had formed. On 17 April, the Duke was gratefully received by the Queen at [[Kensington Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/08_union.html | title = 1 May 1707 – the Union comes into effect | publisher = UK Parliament website | year = 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090619224036/http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/08_union.html | archivedate = 19 June 2009 | accessdate = 5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political motivations ==
[[File:QueenAnne1702.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Queen Anne in 1702, the year she became queen, from the school of [[John Closterman]]]]

The Acts of Union should be seen within a wider European context of increasing state centralisation during the late 17th and early 18th centuries. This included the monarchies of France, Sweden, Denmark and Spain. While there were exceptions such as the [[Dutch Republic]] or the [[Republic of Venice]], the trend was clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Munck |first1=Thomas |title=Seventeenth-Century Europe: State, Conflict and Social Order in Europe 1598-1700 |date=2005 |publisher=Palgrave |isbn=978-1403936196 |pages=429–431}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The dangers of the monarch using one Parliament against the other became apparent in the wars of 1647 and 1651 and resurfaced during the [[Exclusion Crisis]]. English resistance to the Catholic [[James II of England|James]] succeeding his brother Charles resulted in him being sent to Edinburgh in 1681 as [[Lord High Commissioner to the Parliament of Scotland|Lord High Commissioner]]. In August, the Scottish Parliament passed the Succession Act, confirming the divine right of kings, the rights of the natural heir 'regardless of religion,' the duty of all to swear allegiance to that king and the independence of the Scottish Crown. It then went beyond ensuring James's succession to the Scottish throne by explicitly stating the aim was to make his exclusion from the English throne impossible without '...the fatall and dreadfull consequences of a civil war.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jackson |first1=Clare |title=Restoration Scotland, 1660-1690: Royalist Politics, Religion and Ideas |date=2003 |publisher=Boydell Press |isbn=978-0851159300 |pages=38–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The issue reappeared during the 1688 [[Glorious Revolution]]. Contrary to what is often assumed, the English Parliament generally supported the replacement of James with his Protestant daughter [[Mary II]] but strongly resisted making her Dutch husband [[William III &amp; II]] joint ruler. They only gave way when he threatened to return to the Netherlands and Mary refused to rule without him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Horwitz |first1=Henry |title=Parliament, Policy and Politics in the Reign of William III. |date=1986 |publisher=MUP |isbn=978-0719006616 |pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Scotland, conflict over control of the kirk between Presbyterians and Episcopalians and William's position as a fellow Calvinist put him in a much stronger position. Originally, William insisted on retaining Episcopacy in the kirk and the Committee of the Articles, an unelected body that controlled what legislation Parliament could debate. Both of these would have given the Crown far greater control than in England but he withdrew his demands due to the 1689-1692 Jacobite Rising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lynch|first1=Michael|title=Scotland, A New History|date=1992|publisher=Vintage|isbn=978-0712698931|pages=300–303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== English perspective ===
The English purpose was to ensure that Scotland would not choose a monarch different from the one on the English throne. The two countries had shared a king for much of the previous century, but the English were concerned that an independent Scotland with a different king, even if he were a Protestant, might make alliances against England. The English succession was provided for by the English [[Act of Settlement 1701]], which ensured that the monarch of England would be a Protestant member of the [[House of Hanover]]. Until the Union of Parliaments, the Scottish throne might be inherited by a different successor after [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]: the Scottish [[Act of Security 1704]] granted parliament the right to choose a successor and explicitly required a choice different from the English monarch unless the English were to grant free trade and navigation. Many people in England were unhappy about the prospect, however. [[English overseas possessions]] made England very wealthy in comparison to Scotland, a poor country with few roads, very little industry and almost no Navy. {{citation needed|date=September 2014}} This made some view unification as a markedly unequal relationship.

=== Scottish perspective ===

In Scotland, some claimed that union would enable Scotland to recover from the financial disaster wrought by the [[Darien scheme]] through English assistance and the lifting of measures put in place through the [[Alien Act 1705|Alien Act]] to force the Scottish Parliament into compliance with the Act of Settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=C. A. |last=Whatley |title=Bought and sold for English Gold? Explaining the Union of 1707 |location=East Linton |publisher=Tuckwell Press |year=2001 |page=48 |isbn=978-1-86232-140-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The combined votes of the Court party with a majority of the [[Squadrone Volante (Scotland)|Squadrone Volante]] were sufficient to ensure the final passage of the treaty through the House.

Personal financial interests were also allegedly involved. Many Commissioners had invested heavily in the Darien scheme and they believed that they would receive compensation for their losses; Article 15 granted [[Pound sterling|£]]398,085 10[[Shilling|s]] sterling to Scotland, a sum known as [[The Equivalent]], to offset future liability towards the English national debt. In essence it was also used as a means of compensation for investors in the Company of Scotland's Darien scheme, as 58.6% was allocated to its shareholders and creditors.&lt;ref&gt;Watt, Douglas. ''The Price of Scotland: Darien, Union and the wealth of nations''. Luath Press 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Downsitting of the Scottish Parliament detail.JPG|thumb|18th-century French illustration of an opening of the Scottish Parliament]]
Even more direct bribery was also said to be a factor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/09_bribery.html Parliament.uk] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925233310/http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/09_bribery.html |date=25 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; £20,000 (£240,000 [[Pound Scots|Scots]]) was dispatched to Scotland for distribution by the [[Earl of Glasgow]]. [[James Douglas, 2nd Duke of Queensberry]], the [[Queen's Commissioner in Parliament]], received £12,325, more than 60% of the funding. [[Robert Burns]] referred to this:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;We're bought and sold for English Gold,
Such a Parcel of Rogues in a Nation.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some of the money was used to hire spies, such as [[Daniel Defoe]]; his first reports were of vivid descriptions of violent demonstrations against the Union. "A Scots rabble is the worst of its kind," he reported, "for every Scot in favour there is 99 against". Years later, [[Sir John Clerk, 2nd Baronet|Sir John Clerk of Penicuik]], originally a leading [[Unionism (Scotland)|Unionist]], wrote in his memoirs that Defoe "was a spy among us, but not known as such, otherwise the Mob of Edinburgh would pull him to pieces."

The Treaty could be considered very unpopular at the time. Popular unrest occurred in Edinburgh, as mentioned above, with some lesser but still substantial riots in Glasgow. The people of Edinburgh demonstrated against the treaty, and their apparent leader in opposition to the Unionists was [[James Hamilton, 4th Duke of Hamilton]]. However, Hamilton was actually on the side of the English Government. Demonstrators in Edinburgh were opposed to the Union for many reasons: they feared the Kirk would be Anglicised; that Anglicisation would remove democracy from the only really elementally democratic part of the Kingdom; and they feared that tax rises would come.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A People's History of Scotland|last=Bambery|first=Chris|publisher=Verso|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Lockhart (politician)|Sir George Lockhart of Carnwath]], the only member of the Scottish negotiating team against union, noted that "The whole nation appears against the Union"&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/devolution/scotland/briefing/1707.shtml |title=Scottish Referendums |publisher=BBC |accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even Sir John Clerk of Penicuik, an ardent pro-unionist and Union negotiator, observed that the treaty was "contrary to the inclinations of at least three-fourths of the Kingdom".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Public opinion against the Treaty as it passed through the Scottish Parliament was voiced through petitions from shires, burghs, presbyteries and parishes. The [[Convention of Royal Burghs]] also petitioned against the Union as proposed:{{quote|That it is our indispensable duty to signify to your grace that, as we are not against an honourable and safe union with England far less can we expect to have the condition of the people of Scotland, with relation to these great concerns, made better and improved without a Scots Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;The Humble Address of the Commissioners to the General Convention of the Royal Burrows of this Ancient Kingdom Convened the Twenty-Ninth of October 1706, at Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Not one petition in favour of an incorporating union was received by Parliament. On the day the treaty was signed, the [[carillon]]er in [[St Giles Cathedral]], Edinburgh, rang the bells in the tune ''Why should I be so sad on my wedding day?''&lt;ref&gt;Notes by [[John Purser]] to CD ''Scotland's Music'', [http://www.electricscotland.com/familytree/magazine/augsep2003/edinburgh.htm Facts about Edinburgh].&lt;/ref&gt; Threats of widespread civil unrest resulted in Parliament imposing [[martial law]].

{{Main article|Treaty of Union}}
The [[Treaty of Union]], agreed between representatives of the [[Parliament of England]] and the [[Parliament of Scotland]] in 1706, consisted of 25 articles, 15 of which were economic in nature. In Scotland, each article was voted on separately and several clauses in articles were delegated to specialised subcommittees. Article 1 of the treaty was based on the political principle of an incorporating union and this was secured by a majority of 116 votes to 83 on 4 November 1706. To minimise the opposition of the [[Church of Scotland]], an Act was also passed to secure the [[Presbyterian]] establishment of the Church, after which the Church stopped its open opposition, although hostility remained at lower levels of the clergy. The treaty as a whole was finally ratified on 16 January 1707 by a majority of 110 votes to 69.&lt;ref name="Riley"&gt;{{Cite journal |first=P. J. W. |last=Riley |title=The Union of 1707 as an Episode in English Politics |journal=The English Historical Review |volume=84 |issue=332 |year=1969 |pages=498–527 [pp. 523–524] |doi= 10.1093/ehr/lxxxiv.cccxxxii.498|jstor=562482 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two Acts incorporated provisions for Scotland to send [[Scottish representative peers|representative peers]] from the [[Peerage of Scotland]] to sit in the [[House of Lords]]. It guaranteed that the [[Church of Scotland]] would remain the [[established church]] in Scotland, that the [[Court of Session]] would "remain in all time coming within Scotland", and that [[Scots law]] would "remain in the same force as before". Other provisions included the restatement of the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] and the ban on [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]] from taking the throne. It also created a [[customs union]] and [[monetary union]].

The Act provided that any "laws and statutes" that were "contrary to or inconsistent with the terms" of the Act would "cease and become void".

===Related Acts===

The Scottish Parliament also passed the [[Protestant Religion and Presbyterian Church Act 1707]] guaranteeing the status of the Presbyterian Church of Scotland. The English Parliament passed a similar Act, 6 Anne c.8.

Soon after the Union, the Act 6 Anne c.40{{mdash}}later named the [[Union with Scotland (Amendment) Act 1707]]{{mdash}}united the English and Scottish [[Privy Council]]s and decentralised Scottish administration by appointing justices of the peace in each shire to carry out administration. In effect it took the day-to-day government of Scotland out of the hands of politicians and into those of the [[College of Justice]].

In the year following the Union, the [[Treason Act 1708]] abolished the Scottish law of [[High treason in the United Kingdom#History: after union with Scotland|treason]] and extended the corresponding English law across Great Britain.

== Evaluations ==
Scotland benefited, says historian G.N. Clark, gaining "freedom of trade with England and the colonies" as well as "a great expansion of markets". The agreement guaranteed the permanent status of the Presbyterian church in Scotland, and the separate system of laws and courts in Scotland.  Clark argued that in exchange for the financial benefits and bribes that England bestowed, what it gained was

&lt;blockquote&gt;of inestimable value. Scotland accepted the Hanoverian succession and gave up her power of threatening England's military security and complicating her commercial relations ... The sweeping successes of the eighteenth-century wars owed much to the new unity of the two nations.&lt;ref&gt;G.N. Clark, ''The Later Stuarts, 1660–1714'' (2nd ed. 1956) pp 290–93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By the time [[Samuel Johnson]] and [[James Boswell]] made their tour in 1773, recorded in ''[[A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland]]'', Johnson noted that Scotland was "a nation of which the commerce is hourly extending, and the wealth increasing" and in particular that [[Glasgow]] had become one of the greatest cities of Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gordon Brown|title=My Scotland, Our Britain: A Future Worth Sharing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dRz1AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA150|year=2014|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster UK|page=150|isbn=9781471137518}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 300th anniversary ==

[[File:2007£2union.jpg|thumb|The £2 coin issued in the United Kingdom in 2007 to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the Acts of Union]]

A commemorative [[two-pound coin]] was issued to mark the tercentennial—300th anniversary—of the Union, which occurred two days before the [[Scottish Parliament election, 2007|Scottish Parliament general election]] on 3 May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2006-11-06a.79.0 House of Lords – Written answers], 6 November 2006, TheyWorkForYou.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Scottish Executive]] held a number of commemorative events through the year including an education project led by the [[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland]], an exhibition of Union-related objects and documents at the [[National Museums of Scotland]] and an exhibition of portraits of people associated with the Union at the [[National Galleries of Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;Announced by the Scottish Culture Minister, Patricia Ferguson, 9 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4029">In some countries, financial regulatory regimes allows issuers to set additional issuer specific notification thresholds in their articles of association.

==Overview ==

Major shareholding disclosure regimes defines disclosure thresholds. In case an investor crosses those defined thresholds he is required to disclose those shareholdings. The disclosure needs to be made public by notification to the competent financial authority as well as to the issuer. The setup of the disclosure regimes differs in each country. As a matter of fact the thresholds requiring a disclosure varies in each country. But still those regulatory thresholds applies to shareholdings in all issuers required to be disclosed in this country.

Nevertheless, in some countries there are additional issuer specific notification thresholds. Those additional thresholds are in addition to the ones set out by major shareholding notification regimes. E.g. in [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[France]] and [[Italy]] issuers are allowed to stipulate additional notification thresholds in their articles of association according to the [[European Securities and Markets Authority]] [ESMA].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.esma.europa.eu/system/files/08_514b_annex_II.pdf |title=ESMA individual answers by CESR members (pdf)}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, following issuers have additional notification thresholds set in their articles of association:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.watchingstock.com/bylaws.jsp |title=Examples of issuers having additional notification thresholds set in their articles of association}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Accor S.A. 0,5% and multiple, Befimmo S.C.A. 3%, Eutelsat Communications S.A. 1% and multiple, 
l'Oreal S.A. 1% and multiple up to 5%, Sion Industries N.V. 3% and Total S.A. 1% and multiple.

==Lowest additional notification threshold in Belgium==

Issuers having shares admitted to trading on a regulated market, for which Belgium is the home member state can stipulate additional notification thresholds, on the basis of article 18 of the law of 2 May 2007. The law came effective by the royal decree of 14 February 2008 on disclosure of major shareholdings.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.fsma.be/~/media/Files/fsmafiles/wetgeving/kb_ar/en/rd_14-02-2008.ashx |title=Belgium Royal Decree of 14 February 2008 on disclosure of major shareholdings (pdf)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial threshold for the notification of major shareholdings in Belgium is 5%. Whereas the lowest possible additional notification threshold is 1%.

The Belgium financial authority provides on unofficial list of issuers which set additional notification thresholds in their articles of association. It is also stated that the issuer bears sole responsibility for the accuracy of the information given.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.fsma.be/en/Supervision/fm/gv/ah/Thresholds.aspx |title=Belgium unofficial list of issuers whose articles of association stipulate additional notification thresholds
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lowest additional notification threshold in France==

Shareholders are required to notify when their shareholding exceeds or falls below certain thresholds. According to the act of 26 July 2005 the lowest disclosure threshold is 1/20 which represents 5% (article l. 233-7 of the commercial code).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Pursuant the same article allows that companies can require additional notification obligations in their articles of association. The lowest possible additional notification threshold may not be less than 0.5%.

The '''altruism theory of voting''' is a model of '''[[Voting behavior|voter behavior]]''' which states that if citizens in a democracy have “social” preferences for the welfare of others, the extremely low probability of a single vote determining an [[election]] will be outweighed by the large cumulative benefits society will receive from the voter’s preferred policy being enacted, such that it is rational for an “altruistic” citizen, who receives '''[[utility]]''' from helping others, to vote.&lt;ref name="Edlin"&gt;Edlin, Aaron, Andrew Gelman, and Noah Kaplan. [http://escholarship.org/uc/item/0x3780rb "Voting as a Rational Choice: Why and How People Vote To Improve the Well-Being of Others."] Rationality and Society. 19.3 (2008): 293–314. Web. 22 Oct. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Altruistic voting has been compared to purchasing a lottery ticket, in which the probability of winning is extremely low but the payoff is large enough that the ''expected'' benefit outweighs the cost.&lt;ref&gt;Jankowski, Richard. [http://rss.sagepub.com/content/14/1/55.short "Buying a Lottery Ticket to Help the Poor: Altruism, Civic Duty, and Self-interest in the Decision to Vote."] Rationality and Society 14.1 (2002): 55–77. Sage Journals. Web. 20 Oct. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the failure of standard '''[[rational choice]]''' models—which assume voters have "selfish" preferences—to explain [[voter turnout]] in large elections, '''[[public choice]]''' economists and social scientists have increasingly turned to [[altruism]] as a way to explain why rational individuals would choose to vote despite its apparent lack of individual benefit, the so-called '''[[paradox of voting]]'''. The theory suggests that individual voters do, in fact, derive personal utility from influencing the ''outcome'' of elections in favor of the candidate that they believe will implement policies for the greater good of the entire population.&lt;ref name="Fowler"&gt;Fowler, James H. [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/4639889 "Altruism and Turnout."] The Journal of Politics 68.3 (2006): 673–83. JSTOR. Web. 20 Oct. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The rational calculus of voting==

===The "selfish" rationale for voting===
The standard model of voter calculus was articulated by [[William H. Riker|Riker]] and [[Peter Ordeshook|Ordeshook]] in their 1968 article "A Theory of the Calculus of Voting" in ''[[The American Political Science Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Riker, William H., and Peter Ordeshook. [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1953324 "A Theory of the Calculus of Voting."] The American Political Science Review 62.1 (1968): 25–42. JSTOR. Web. 20 Nov. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The basic utility hypothesis for the calculus of voting they gave was:

:&lt;big&gt;'''R = (BP) − C''' &lt;/big&gt;

Where '''B''' is the expected differential utility a voter ''personally'' receives from his preferred candidate winning; '''P''' is the probability of the voter bringing about '''B''' (that is, turning the election for his preferred candidate); '''C''' is the individual's cost of voting in the election; and R is the individuals expected reward from voting. If R &gt; 0, then the expected utility of voting outweighs its costs, and it is reasonable to vote. But if R ≤ 0, the costs outweigh the benefits and a strictly rational individual would not be expected to vote.

Because '''P''', the probability of any one vote determining the outcome, is extremely small for any large election, the expected benefits of voting under the traditional rational choice model is always roughly equal to zero. This leads to the so-called paradox of voting, in which rational choice models of voter behavior predict tiny turnouts which simply do not occur. In all democracies, [[voter turnout]] exceeds what the basic rational choice models predict.

====Expressive versus instrumental voting====
Because simple selfishness cannot explain why large numbers of people consistently choose to vote, Riker and Ordeshook introduced another term to the equation, '''D''', to symbolize the personal or social benefits conferred by the act of voting itself, rather than by affecting the outcome of the election.

:&lt;big&gt;'''R = (BP) − C + D''' &lt;/big&gt;

This drew a distinction between ''[[expressive voting]]'', intended only to signal support or demonstrate civic responsibility, and ''instrumental voting'', intended to actually change the outcome. The benefits here did not come from actually influencing the election, but rather from the social payoffs of participating in it. Because the term BP was assumed to be zero, D was presumed to be the only important factor in determining elections.&lt;ref name="Hamlin"&gt;Hamlin , Alan, and Colin Jennings. [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=8286059 "Expressive Political Behaviour: Foundations, Scope and Implications."] British Journal of Political Science. 41.3 (2011): 645–670. Web. 22 Oct. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The "altruistic" rationale for voting===
Because of the multitude of different and contradictory definitions of expressive voting,&lt;ref name="Hamlin" /&gt; recently another effort by political scientists and public choice theorists has been made to explain voting behavior with reference to instrumental benefits received from influencing the outcome of the election. If voters assumed to be rational but also to have altruistic tendencies and some preference for outcomes enhancing the social welfare of others, they will reliably vote in favor of the policies they perceive to be for the common good, rather than for their individual benefit.

In his paper "Altruism and Turnout," [[James H. Fowler]] explained how the altruistic theory modified the calculus of voting:

:Scholars incorporate altruism into the traditional calculus of voting model by assuming that a citizen also cares about the benefits that others secure from the preferred outcome (Edlin, Gelman, and Kaplan 2006; Jankowski 2002, 2004). Under this assumption, B is a function not only of direct benefits to oneself BS, but to the N other people affected by the outcome of the election who would gain an average benefit BO if the citizen’s preferred alternative won. It also depends on how much the citizen cares about benefits to others, which is labeled a for altruism.
:These assumptions transform the calculus of voting to '''P(BS + aNBO) &gt; C'''.
:...There is by now a substantial literature in economics, sociology, biology, psychology, and political science yielding evidence that human beings are also motivated by the welfare of others (Fehr and Fischbacher 2003; Monroe 1998; Piliavin and Charng 1990). Specifically, people frequently engage in acts of altruism by choosing to bear costs in order to provide benefits to others.&lt;ref name="Fowler" /&gt;

Essentially, voters behave altruistically by absorbing the cost of voting in order to provide society with the benefits of their preferred policy, although the expected reward of voting under this model is greater than zero (and thus still a rational decision) because of voters' altruistic social preferences. Edlin, et al., found in their study of altruistic behavior among voters,

:... [F]or an individual with both selfish and social preferences, the social preferences will dominate and make it rational for a typical person to vote even in large elections;(2) to show that rational socially-motivated voting has a feedback mechanism that stabilizes turnout at reasonable levels (e.g., 50% of the electorate)...

Their findings suggest that in a large election, altruistic preferences will trump selfish tendencies, thus encouraging a stable voter turnout that closely mirrors the observed rate in western democracies.

==Voter's altruistic preferences==
In his 2007 book ''[[The Myth of the Rational Voter: Why Democracies Choose Bad Policies]]'', [[George Mason University]] economist [[Bryan Caplan]] argued that, all else equal, voters do not, in fact, choose policies based on self-interest. The rich are not more likely to support policies that personally benefit them, like lower marginal rates, and the poor are not more likely to oppose welfare reform.&lt;ref name="Caplan"&gt;Bryan Caplan. [http://amzn.com/0691138737 The Myth of the Rational Voter: Why Democracies Choose Bad Policies], Princeton University Press, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

He claims that what he calls the "Self-Interest Voter Hypothesis" (SIVH), the theory that individuals' policy preferences are narrowly selfish, is empirically wrong. In response to U.S. [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate [[Mitt Romney]]'s remarks about [[Romney 47 percent comments|the "47%" of Americans]] who will "always" vote Democrat because they are dependent on the [[welfare state]], Caplan writes,

:Wrong, wrong, wrong.  The 47% won't vote for Obama "no matter what."  Almost half of voters who earn less than the median income vote Republican in the typical election.  A person doesn't support the nanny state because he wants government to take care of ''him''; a person supports the nanny state because he wants government to take care of ''us''.&lt;ref name="EconLog"&gt;Caplan, Bryan. "Will False Belief in the SIVH Destroy Romney's Candidacy?" EconLog. Library of Economics and Liberty, 18 Sept. 2012. Web. 20 Oct. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Caplan says that voters consistently demonstrate preferences that are not clearly related to self-interest, and they are motivated primarily by what they believe is best for the country.

===Rational irrationality===
Related to the public choice concept of [[rational ignorance]], Caplan proposes the concept of "[[rational irrationality]]" as an explanation for why the average voter holds views that are persistently and systematically contradictory to the consensus view of expert economists. His thesis is that indulging innate cognitive biases (of which he identifies four as being major contributors to bad economic policy positions) is psychologically gratifying, while overcoming natural prejudices through training, education, and [[scientific skepticism|skepticism]], is psychologically costly. Therefore, when the personal benefit giving in to our biases is greater than the personal cost suffered from acting on them, individuals will tend to ''rationally'' indulge in irrational behavior, like voting for protectionist tariffs and other economically damaging but socially popular policies.

These views tend not to be related to the particular voter in any rationally self-interested way, and so voters are genuinely not being subject to any direct economic penalties for choosing irrational policies. The altruistic voter will indulge, without restraint, in make-work bias, anti-foreign bias, pessimistic bias, and anti-market bias,&lt;ref name="Caplan" /&gt; all in the hopes of better his fellow man through the ballot box.

==Criticisms and modifications==
* A 2008 study of voters in Sweden during the 1990s found significant evidence for self-interested "pocketbook" voting. The authors found that voters can and will respond to direct promises of personal economic benefits, although it appears that citizens respond almost entirely to the ''prospective promises'' of politicians but ''not'' to the actual implementation of those policies.&lt;ref&gt;Elinder , Mikael, Henrik Jordahl, and Panu Poutvaara.

* George Mason Law Professor Tun-Jen Chiang criticized the Edlin altruist model as overly simplistic and ultimately naive about voter preferences. Chiang presents an alternative model of altruist voting behavior, centered around voters' ''selective'' altruism towards favored racial, cultural, religious, regional, sexual, economic, or social groups (of which they may or may not be a member). He contends that, even if two candidates policies had identical social welfare benefits overall,

::It is rational to vote as long as the candidates differ in their effect on the welfare of subsets of the population, and one happens to be particularly concerned with an affected subset. For example, if a candidate proposed to take wealth from the richer half of the population and distribute it to the poorer half, and the redistribution created no overall effects, a voter under the broad altruism model would have no incentive to vote. However, if a voter cared particularly for the welfare of the poor, that voter would have an incentive to vote for the candidate; similarly, a voter that cared particular for the welfare of the rich would have an incentive to vote against the candidate. The result in my model is that both such voters would be rationally motivated to vote.&lt;ref&gt;Chiang, Tun-Jen.

'''Caesaropapism''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|iː|z|ər|oʊ|ˈ|p|eɪ|p|ɪ|z|əm}} is the idea of combining the [[power (social and political) | power]] of [[secularity|secular]] government with the religious power, or of making secular authority superior to the spiritual authority of the Church; especially concerning the connection of the Church with government. [[Justus Henning Böhmer]] (1674–1749) may have originally coined the term ''[[Wiktionary:caesaropapism|caesaropapism]]'' (''Cäseropapismus'').&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Pennington, "Caesaropapism," The New Catholic Encyclopedia: Supplement 2010 (2 Vols. Detroit: Gale Publishers 2010) 1.[http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/Canon%20Law/PenningtonCaesaropapism.htm 183-185] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029184027/http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/Canon%20Law/PenningtonCaesaropapism.htm |date=2013-10-29 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Weber]] (1864-1920) wrote: "a secular, caesaropapist ruler... exercises supreme authority in ecclesiastic matters by virtue of his autonomous legitimacy".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Weber's political sociology, caesaropapism entails "the complete subordination of priests to secular power."&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In its extreme form, caesaropapism is a political theory in which the head of state, notably the emperor ("Caesar", by extension a "superior" king), is also the supreme head of the church (pope or analogous religious leader). In this form, caesaropapism inverts [[theocracy]] (or [[hierocracy]] in Weber) in which institutions of the church control the state. Both caesaropapism and theocracy are systems in which there is no [[separation of church and state]] and in which the two form parts of a single power-structure.

==Caesaropapism in the Eastern Church==

Caesaropapism's chief example is the authority that the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[List of Byzantine emperors|(East Roman) Emperors]] had over the [[Church of Constantinople]] and [[Eastern Christianity]] from the 330 consecration of [[Constantinople]] through the tenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Cross | first1 = F.L.| last2 = Livingstone | first2 = E.A.| title = Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church| publisher = Oxford University Press| year = 1983| location = Oxford| pages = [http://faculty.cua.edu/Pennington/ChurchHistory220/LectureTwo/caesaropapism.htm 218]| edition = 2nd

In addition, at several occasions imperial decrees had to be withdrawn as the people of the Church, both lay people, monks and priests, refused to accept inventions at variance with the Church's customs and beliefs.

Caesaropapism was most notorious in the [[Tsardom of Russia]] when [[Ivan IV the Terrible]] assumed the title [[Czar]] in 1547 and subordinated the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] to the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was taken to a new level in 1721, when [[Peter the Great]] replaced the patriarchate with a [[Holy Synod]], making the church a department of his government.

==Caesaropapism in the Western Church==
[[File:San Vitale Ravenna.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Basilica of San Vitale]] in [[Ravenna]], Italy combines Western and Byzantine elements.]]{{main|Byzantine Papacy}}

[[Justinian I]] conquered the Italian peninsula in the [[Gothic War (535–554)]] and [[papal selection before 1059|appointed the next three popes]], a practice that would be continued by his successors and later be delegated to the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]]. The ''Byzantine Papacy'' was a period of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] domination of the [[pope|papacy]] from 537 to 752, when popes required the approval of the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]] for [[consecration#Roman Catholic Church|episcopal consecration]], and many popes were chosen from the ''[[apocrisiarius|apocrisiarii]]'' (liaisons from the pope to the emperor) or the inhabitants of [[Byzantine Greece]], [[Byzantine Syria]], or [[History of Sicily#Byzantine period|Byzantine Sicily]].

===Analogue in the Church of England===

When [[Henry VIII of England]] declared the [[Church of England]] to exist as an entity separate from and independent of the Roman Church, he declared himself to be the [[Supreme Head of the Church of England|"Supreme Head" of that church]], to which declaration the English Parliament acceded by passing the [[Act of Supremacy 1534]] at Henry's behest. When [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] restored royal supremacy, she replaced the title "Supreme Head" with that of "[[Supreme Governor of the Church of England|Supreme Governor]]", a change both conciliatory to English Catholics on a political level and reflecting a shift toward a more metaphysically and theologically modest stance involving only a claim to supreme authority over the Church of England's conduct in temporal matters. Since then, the monarchs of England, of Great Britain, and of the United Kingdom have claimed the "Supreme Governor" status as well as the title of ''[[fidei defensor|Defender of the Faith]]'' (which was originally bestowed on Henry VIII by [[Pope Leo X]] but later revoked by [[Pope Paul III]]).

The '''Children and Young People (Scotland) Act 2014''' is an [[Act of the Scottish Parliament]] passed on 19 February 2014 and received royal assent on 27 March 2014.&lt;ref name="2014-asp-8"/&gt; Tue legislation is part of the Scottish Government's [[Getting it right for every child]] policy implementation.

The scope of the act as described in its [[long title]] is to make provision:
*about the rights of children and young people; 
*about investigations by the [[Children and Young People's Commissioner Scotland|Commissioner for Children and Young People in Scotland]]; 
*about the provision of services and support for or in relation to children and young people:
*for and about an [[Adoption and Children (Scotland) Act 2007|adoption]] register;
*about [[children’s hearings]], detention in secure accommodation and consultation on certain proposals in relation to schools.

In the course of legal proceedings on the part of The [[Christian Institute]] and others who were concerned with [[information privacy law]], and who challenged provisions of the act, the judgments of the [[Court of Session]] in Edinburgh and, on appeal, of the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court in Westminster]] referred to the  [[Data Protection Act 1998]], the EU [[Data Protection Directive]], and the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].  The Court of Session upheld the provisions of the act, but was overruled by the Supreme Court's decision that the provisions were defective and were not in the Parliament's legislative competence, and therefore could not be brought into force.

==Key provisions==
The key provisions of the Act include:
* The introduction of specific and continuing duties on the Scottish Ministers for maintaining and improving Scotland's compliance with the [[United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child]].
* Certain public bodies such as local authorities, health boards and the police (among others) must report every three years on what action they have taken to promote the rights of children and young people.
* The creation of a new Complaints and Investigation Service to support the work of the Commissioner for Children and Young People.
* The institution of a 'named person service', for which an individual is to be identified and made available in respect of every child in Scotland until they reach age 18.
* Provides public funding for free school meals for school pupils in P1-3.

A government document published in June 2014 described the Scottish Government’s overarching plans for implementing the Act and stated that the named person provisions in Part 4 were then currently focused on developing guidance in relation to the [[Getting It Right for Every Child|"GIRFEC"]] approach.&lt;ref&gt;''Implementation of the Children and Young People (Scotland) Act 2014'', published in June 2014.[http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0045/00452065.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal challenge==
The Act has generated controversy, and in ''The Christian Institute and others (Appellants) v The [[Lord Advocate]]'' ([2016] UKSC 51), the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom ruled that certain data sharing provisions of the Act were in breach of the right to respect for private and family life prescribed in [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights]], meaning the Scottish Parliament must amend the Act in order for it to become law. The [[Scottish Conservatives]] and [[Scottish Liberal Democrats]] have called for the Act to be repealed and [[Scottish Labour]], whilst initially supportive of the Act, have called for a 'pause'.&lt;ref name="christianconcern_libdems-withdraw"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.christianconcern.com/our-concerns/adoption/scottish-liberal-democrats-withdraw-support-for-named-person-scheme | title=Scottish Liberal Democrats withdraw support for 'Named Person' scheme | publisher=Christian Concern (CCFON Ltd) | date=8 August 2016 | accessdate=1 October 2016 | archive-date=1 October 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161001111050/http://www.christianconcern.com/our-concerns/adoption/scottish-liberal-democrats-withdraw-support-for-named-person-scheme}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Survation]] poll has found that 64% of Scottish adults are opposed to the Named Person provisions of the Act.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14539070.Poll__64__of_Scots_say_named_person_policy_is_an__unacceptable_intrusion_/&lt;/ref&gt;

The appeal to the Supreme Court was from the Opinion of the Inner House of the Court of Session (delivered 3 September 2015) on a reclaiming motion ([2015] CSIH 64) between seven parties as petitioners and reclaimers, namely, The Christian Institute, Family Education Trust, The Young Me Sufferers ("TYMES"), [[Christian Action Research and Education]] ("CARE") (four registered charities with an interest in family matters), and three individual parents, against [[List of Scottish Governments|The Scottish Ministers]] as respondent. The Inner House refused an appeal from [[Paul Cullen, Lord Pentland|Lord Pentland's]] decision, as [[Lord Ordinary]].  Lord Pentland had refused a petition for judicial review (lodged 11 July 2014), holding that the named person service provisions in Part 4 of the 2014 Act were within the devolved competence of the [[Reserved and excepted matters|Scottish Parliament]] and did not contravene fundamental common law rights, or the European Convention, or the EU law on data protection.&lt;ref&gt;''The Christian Institute and Others -v- The Scottish Ministers'', website of the Judiciary in Scotland[http://www.scotland-judiciary.org.uk/9/1478/The-Christian-Institute-and-Others-v-The-Scottish-Ministers]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Opinion of the Inner House, which the Supreme Court's judgment overruled, was that the legislation was in accordance with the law, had a legitimate aim and was necessary in a democratic society in the interests of, amongst other things, public safety, the prevention of crime, the protection of health or morals or of the rights of others. The Inner House's Opinion was based on observing that the legislation was intended to provide for every child a suitably qualified professional able, if necessary, to act as a single point of contact with any public service from which the child could benefit, and that this would have no effect whatsoever on the legal, moral or social relationships within the family, and, further, that the legislation did not involve the state taking over any functions currently carried out by parents in relation to their children, and would not permit any interference with a parent’s or child’s right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, nor bear upon a child’s right to education or his parent’s right to bring up a child according to his conscience and religion.

===Possible remedy under Scotland Act 1998===
The proceedings and judgments were mainly concerned with provisions in Part 4 of the Children and Young People (Scotland) Act 2014, including ten sections that had not then been brought into force under section 102, namely,
*s.20 Named person service in relation to pre-school child.
*s.21 Named person service in relation to children not falling within section 20.
*s.22 Continuation of named person service in relation to certain young people.
*s.23 Communication in relation to movement of children and young people.
*s.24 Duty to communicate information about role of named persons.
*s.25 Duty to help named person.
*s.26 Information sharing.
*s.27 Disclosure of information.
*s.28 Guidance in relation to named person service.
*s.29 Directions in relation to named person service.

When allowing the appeal, the Supreme Court, following the precedent of its ruling in ''Salvesen v Riddell'' ([2013] UKSC 22),&lt;ref&gt;''Salvesen v Riddell'', para.58[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2013/22.html]&lt;/ref&gt; invited the parties to produce, within the period of 42 days from 28 July (expiring in early September), written submissions on the terms of an order that the Court could make under 102(2)(b) of the [[Scotland Act 1998]] to allow the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Ministers an opportunity to correct the defects which the Court had identified, but the Court stated that in the meantime, since the defective provisions were not within the legislative competence of the Parliament, they could not be brought into force.&lt;ref&gt;Supreme Court judgment, paragraphs 109 to 110.[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2016/51.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government's September announcement===
The Scottish Government announced on 8 September a process involving the offices of the Children's Commissioner and the [[Information Commissioner's Office|Information Commissioner]] in order to address the concerns raised by the Supreme Court, including development of a code of practice to set out how information should be shared under the legislation, with the intention of working towards a commencement date for the legislation of August 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Deputy First Minister's Statement on Named Persons |url=http://news.scotland.gov.uk/Speeches-Briefings/STATEMENT-ON-NAMED-PERSON-Deputy-First-Minister-2a89.aspx |publisher=Scottish Government |date=8 September 2016 |accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chiong murder case''' (''People of the Philippines vs. Francisco Juan Larrañaga et al.'') was an incident on July 16, 1997 in [[Cebu City|Cebu]], in which sisters Marijoy and Jacqueline Chiong allegedly were kidnapped, raped, and murdered.&lt;ref name=elpaisapr17&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Filipinas/conmuta/pena/capital/Larranaga/cadena/perpetua/elpepiesp/20060417elpepinac_17/Tes |title=Filipinas conmuta la pena capital de Larrañaga por cadena perpetua |publisher=Elpais.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=elpaisoct6&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Larranaga/sera/trasladado/carcel/Soto/Real/aterrice/Espana/elpepuesp/20091006elpepunac_1/Tes |title=Larrañaga será trasladado a la cárcel de Soto del Real cuando aterrice en España |publisher=Elpais.com |date=2010-07-14 |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Francisco Juan "Paco" Larrañaga (b. 1977), a man of dual [[Philippine nationality law|Filipino]] and [[Spanish nationality law|Spanish]] citizenship was, along with six others, convicted of murder, and sentenced to death by [[lethal injection]] on February 3, 2004. [[Capital punishment in the Philippines]] has since been abolished.

But with further studies and clarifications, this case is considered flawed.{{by who?|date=July 2018}} There is contestedly no solid evidence against Larrañaga.

==Trial==

===Prosecution===
According to the prosecutors, at 10:00 p.m. on July 16, 1997, Larrañaga and six other defendants kidnapped the Chiong sisters near a mall on the [[Cebu (island)|island of Cebu]] in the Philippines, raped them, and then threw one of the sisters into a ravine (This was later disputed as there was no formal identification of the body, and later thought not to be the body of one of the sister's.)&lt;ref name=fti&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fairtrials.net/cases/spotlight/francisco_juan_larranaga_paco/ |title=Fair Trials International: Cases: Francisco Juan Larrañaga (Paco) |publisher=Fairtrials.net |date= |accessdate=2010-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710042805/http://www.fairtrials.net/cases/spotlight/francisco_juan_larranaga_paco/ |archivedate=2009-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other sister was never found.&lt;ref name=fti/&gt;&lt;ref name=obliged/&gt;&lt;ref name=inq/&gt;&lt;ref name=cuarticle&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/127143/Trace-of-violence-The-Chiong-murder-case |title=Trace of violence: The Chiong murder case - Public Affairs - GMANews.TV - Official Website of GMA News and Public Affairs - Latest Philippine News |publisher=GMANews.TV |date= |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecutors' case against Larrañaga centered on the testimony of a co-defendant, Davidson Valiente Rusia.&lt;ref name=inq/&gt; In exchange for blanket immunity, he testified. The trial court only permitted Larrañaga's counsel to cross-examine Rusia for half an hour, despite the fact that Rusia's direct testimony lasted for days. In that half-hour, Larrañaga's counsel established that Rusia had lied to the prosecution and the court concerning his prior convictions. While Rusia had claimed he had never been convicted of crime, in fact he had a record of burglary and forgery. Rusia fainted when confronted with this evidence. Davidson Rusia&lt;!--  who admitted that he raped Jacqueline --&gt; is a convicted felon who was a gang member and was sentenced to prison twice in the [[Incarceration in the United States|United States]] for other crimes.&lt;ref name=cuvideo&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UR3-tJMSC7A |title=Case Unclosed "The Chiong murder case" |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rusia claimed that he was with Larrañaga in Ayala Center, Cebú early in the evening of July 16, the evening Larrañaga says that he was at R&amp;R Restaurant in [[Quezon City]] with his friends. Rusia was not known to Larrañaga&lt;ref name=cuvideo/&gt; and only appeared as a "state witness" 10 months after the event.

Thirty five witnesses,&lt;ref name=fti/&gt; including Larrañaga's teachers and classmates at the [[Center for Culinary Arts, Manila|Center for Culinary Arts]] (CCA) in Quezon City, testified under oath that he was in Quezon City, when the crime is said to have taken place in [[Cebu City|Cebu]].&lt;ref name=inq/&gt;&lt;ref name=ho/&gt;&lt;ref name=larranagavideo&gt;{{cite web  |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmQeYIppWeg |title=Framed for Murder? Filipino Paco Larrañaga Speaks from Jail |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the trial court considered these testimonies irrelevant, rejecting these as coming from "friends of the accused," and they were not admitted.&lt;ref name=elpaisapr17/&gt;&lt;ref name=fti/&gt;&lt;ref name=inq/&gt;&lt;ref name=cuarticle/&gt;&lt;ref name=ho/&gt; During his trial in the Cebu Regional Trial Court (RTC) Branch 7, defense lawyers sought to present evidence of his whereabouts on the evening of the crime&amp;mdash;that Larrañaga, at that time 19 years old, was at a party at the R&amp;R Restaurant along Katipunan Avenue, Quezon City, and stayed there until early morning the following day. After the party, the logbook of the security guard at Larrañaga's condominium indicates that Larrañaga returned to his Quezon City condominium at 2:45 a.m.&lt;ref name=fti/&gt;

Rowena Bautista, an instructor and chef at the culinary center, said Larrañaga was in school from 8 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. and saw him again at about 6:30 p.m on July 16.&lt;ref name=fti/&gt; The school's registrar, Caroline Calleja, said she proctored a two-hour exam where Larrañaga was present from 1:30 p.m. Larrañaga attended his second round of midterm exams on July 17 commencing at 8 a.m. Only then did Larrañaga leave for Cebu in the late afternoon of July 17, 1997.

Airline and airport personnel also came to court with their flight records, indicating that Larrañaga did not take any flight on July 16, 1997, nor was he on board any chartered aircraft that landed in or departed from Cebu during the relevant dates, except the 5 p.m. [[Philippine Airlines|PAL]] flight on July 17, 1997 from Manila to Cebu.

Nevertheless, the Supreme Court upheld the conviction of the accused without reasonable doubt.

===Verdict===
The seven co-defendants were convicted of murder and sentenced to death by [[lethal injection]] on February 3, 2004.&lt;ref name=obliged&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20090907-223970/RP-obliged-to-transfer-rapist |title='RP obliged to transfer rapist' - INQUIRER.net, Philippine News for Filipinos |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date= |accessdate=2010-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090909132532/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20090907-223970/RP-obliged-to-transfer-rapist |archivedate=2009-09-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=inq&gt;{{cite web |url=http://services.inquirer.net/print/print.php?article_id=20090905-223648 |title=The Chiong Sisters Rape-Murder Case - 9/05/09 |publisher=Services.inquirer.net |date= |accessdate=2010-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090909205333/http://services.inquirer.net/print/print.php?article_id=20090905-223648 |archivedate=2009-09-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ho&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hazteoir.org/node/422 |title=Pide un juicio justo para Paco Larrañaga, español condenado a muerte en Filipinas |publisher=HazteOir.org |date=2005-04-18 |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Larrañaga's counsels Felicitas Aquino Arroyo and Sandra Marie Olaso Coronel urged the high court to admit the ''[[amicus curiae]]'' from the Basque Bar Council (BBC), Barcelona Bar Associations (BBA) and Bar Association of Madrid.&lt;ref name=inq/&gt; The three organizations expressed their interests in the case of Larrañaga since he was a "[[Spanish nationality law|Spanish citizen]] with origins in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], and therefore a member of the [[European Union]]." The BBA mentioned that the execution of a Spanish citizen would be in breach of the violation of the principle of [[Reciprocity (international relations)|reciprocity]] in [[International criminal law|international law]], noting that if a [[Filipino citizen]] is found guilty in Spain, no [[Judiciary of Spain|Spanish court]] would have imposed the death penalty, nor would have allowed him extradited to any country imposing capital punishment.&lt;ref&gt;The European Union itself forbids capital punishment and its abolition is a requirement for any applicant state.&lt;/ref&gt; Former Ambassador Sedfrey Ordóñez claims he is the victim of a mistrial.

Fair Trials International (FTI), an NGO working on behalf of those who face a miscarriage of justice in a country other than their own, entered an ''amicus'' brief which was submitted to the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] by the European Commission's Manila delegate.&lt;ref name=fti/&gt; The ''amicus'' argued that under both international and [[Philippine criminal law|Philippine law]], Larrañaga had been the subject of an unfair trial and had never been given the opportunity to show his innocence. FTI has since represented Larrañaga before the [[United Nations]], appealing against injustice in the Philippines. Sarah de Mas, spokesperson for FTI who brought the case to the attention of the [[European Parliament]] and successive [[President of the European Union|presidencies of the European Union]],&lt;ref name=fti/&gt; stated that Larrañaga had served a lengthy sentence for a [[Frameup|crime he could not have committed]].

==Aftermath==
Years after the verdict, questions still linger, and there is dissatisfaction with the outcome of events on both sides.&lt;ref name=cuarticle/&gt;&lt;ref name=sunstarenglishoct7/&gt;&lt;ref name=sunstarcartoon&gt;[http://www.sunstar.com.ph/files/images/superbalita%20editoryal%202009-10-08.jpg Editorial cartoon from the ''Sun.Star'']{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sunstarenglishoct8&gt;[http://www.sunstar.com.ph/cebu/chiongs-lose-hope-finding-jackie ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091011032126/http://www.sunstar.com.ph/cebu/chiongs-lose-hope-finding-jackie |date=October 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abolition of the death penalty===
On June 24, 2006, [[Capital punishment in the Philippines|capital punishment was abolished in the Philippines]].&lt;ref name=fti/&gt;&lt;ref name=inq/&gt;&lt;ref name=abolition&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/ceb/2006/06/25/news/arroyo.kills.death.law.html |title=Sun.Star Cebu - Arroyo kills death law |publisher=Sunstar.com.ph |date=2006-06-25 |accessdate=2010-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617190404/http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/ceb/2006/06/25/news/arroyo.kills.death.law.html |archivedate=2008-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transfer of Larrañaga to Spain===
On December 3, 2007, [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation (Spain)|Spanish Foreign Minister]] [[Miguel Ángel Moratinos]] stated that Spain will be "happy" if Larrañaga spends his life sentence in a jail "here" as the Treaty on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons comes into force: "We don't know when this will happen. We have no time period. We feel happy that Mr. Larrañaga can come back with this treaty." The treaty, which will allow convicted persons of either country to return to his home country and spend his sentence there, was ratified by the Philippines—17 affirmative and two abstentions—on November 26. The Philippines has signed similar treaties with [[Canada]], [[Cuba]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Thailand]].&lt;ref name=2forpaco&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/cebu/2-%E2%80%98-exchange%E2%80%99-paco |accessdate=October 9, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091011154312/http://www3.sunstar.com.ph/cebu/2-%E2%80%98-exchange%E2%80%99-paco |archivedate=October 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Larrañaga is the son of Spanish [[Basque pelota|pelotari]] Manuel Larrañaga and Filipino Margarita González,&lt;ref name=elpaisapr17/&gt;&lt;ref name=ho/&gt; and, through his mother, is a member of the influential Osmeña clan of Cebu. [[Senate of the Philippines|Philippine Senator]] [[Miriam Defensor-Santiago]] said that, "Larrañaga's case could be covered by the treaty only if the Supreme Court issued a final ruling on his conviction, which remained on appeal before the high tribunal".&lt;ref name=inq/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://globalnation.inquirer.net/news/news/view_article.php?article_id=104750 Inquirer.net, Spaniard might be first beneficiary in prisons exchange pact] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610085108/http://globalnation.inquirer.net/news/news/view_article.php?article_id=104750 |date=June 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009, the [[Department of Justice (Philippines)|Department of Justice]] approved Larrañaga's transfer to a Spanish prison. Thelma Chiong, the mother of the victims, expressed shock over the decision, saying that, despite Larrañaga's [[Spanish nationality law|Spanish citizenship]], "If you committed a crime in the Philippines, you are jailed in the Philippines,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/171557/convict-in-chiong-rape-murders-to-be-transferred-to-spain |title=Convict in Chiong rape-murders to be transferred to Spain - Nation - GMANews.TV - Official Website of GMA News and Public Affairs - Latest Philippine News |publisher=GMANews.TV |date= |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the fact that this would constitute a breach of the treaty and thus of [[International criminal law|international law]]. Chief [[President of the Philippines|Presidential]] Legal Counsel [[Raul M. Gonzalez|Raúl González]] himself expressed concern that the Philippines might be branded a [[rogue state]] if it did not comply with the provisions of the treaty.&lt;ref name=obliged/&gt;

Less than a week after Larrañaga's transfer, two Filipinos incarcerated in the Philippines stated their wish to also serve the rest of their sentences in Spain under the provisions of the treaty.&lt;ref name=2forpaco/&gt; A supporter of Larrañaga has also sought a reinvestigation of the murder case in order to clear the six other convicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/cebudailynews/news/view/20091008-228982/%91After_Paco,_give_break_to_six_Chiong_convicts%92 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120713031749/http://globalnation.inquirer.net/cebudailynews/news/view/20091008-228982/%91After_Paco,_give_break_to_six_Chiong_convicts%92 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-13 |title='After Paco, give break to six Chiong convicts' - INQUIRER.net, Philippine News for Filipinos |publisher=Globalnation.inquirer.net |date=2006-04-16 |accessdate=2010-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cindrich &amp; Company''' is an international company in sports and entertainment, expert witness services, mediation, and arbitration, founded in 1981 by former NFL player, long-time NFL agent and licensed attorney [[Ralph Cindrich]]. Headed by Cindrich, the company acts as lead negotiator and counsel on the buying and selling of sports businesses and agencies.  As an [[Sports agent|agent]], Cindrich represents professional athletes and acts as consultant to third parties.  Cindrich also provides testimony as an expert witness in sports related litigation and can serve as a neutral third party mediator and/or [[arbitrator]].

==Early representation==
As a linebacker for the [[Houston Oilers]] in 1975, Cindrich enrolled in law school at nearby [[South Texas College of Law]], in [[Houston]]. While still a member of the Oilers, teammates of Cindrich approached him with legal questions, mostly relating to their NFL contracts and/or marketing agreements. Cindrich occasionally took those “real world” issues into his law classes and found answers or resolutions, which he then relayed to his teammates.

In 1977—while still in law school—Cindrich received his first exposure in marketing and law by reviewing contracts or issues of former teammates. His first football client was a former teammate at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] named [[Glenn Hyde]]. Hyde had played professional football in all three professional leagues, as a left [[Guard (American football)|guard]] for the [[Chicago Fire (WFL)|Chicago Fire]] (1974–1975) and the [[Charlotte Hornets (WFL)|Charlotte Hornets]] (1975) of the [[World Football League]], the [[Chicago Blitz]] of the [[United States Football League]] (1984) and the [[Denver Broncos]], [[History of the Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]], [[Seattle Seahawks]] and [[Kansas City Chiefs]] of the [[National Football League]] (1976–1982, 1985–1987).  Cindrich and Hyde had been teammates at the University of Pittsburgh.

Upon graduation (and after his retirement from football), Cindrich practiced criminal and business law in Texas before developing a specialty in sports management. He founded Athletes Of America Inc., a sports management firm, based in Houston in 1978. Over the next few years, Cindrich would represent a handful of players who had made the transition from college to the NFL, including several from the University of Pittsburgh and the [[University of Arkansas]].

==Tom Brzoza case==
In addition to negotiating marketing deals and contracts for players, Cindrich applied his legal expertise to an important NFL case when fellow Western Pennsylvania native [[Tom Brzoza]] approached Cindrich for legal counsel in the fall of 1978. Brzoza, an [[All-American]] center at the University of Pittsburgh, had been selected by his hometown [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] in the 11th round of the [[1978 NFL Draft]]. But during a practice session at [[Three Rivers Stadium]] in May, just weeks after he had been drafted, Brzoza injured his thumb. (It was later revealed that this practice session violated NFL off-season regulations against conducting practices with shoulder pads. As penalty, the Steelers forfeited their third round draft choice in the 1979 draft.)

Because of the injured thumb, Brzoza was forced to switch from [[Center (American football)|center]] to [[Guard (American football)|guard]] and the Steelers subsequently released Brzoza on August 7, 1978, shortly after training camp began. On behalf of his client, Cindrich argued that the injured thumb—as a result of the Steelers violation—kept Brzoza from entering camp at full health and thus was a factor in his being cut from the team.&lt;ref name="Valley"&gt;September 16, 1978, Valley Independent, Monessen, PA, “Brzoza fights Steelers”&lt;/ref&gt;

In September, Cindrich told reporters:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“We request that Tom be paid his salary because he was denied an opportunity to practice his trade because [he] was injured in an illegal camp of the Steelers, that was in violation of the NFL Constitution.”&lt;ref name="Valley"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cindrich threatened to sue for damages and after months of negotiating—and one-on-one meeting between Cindrich and Steelers owner [[Art Rooney]]—the two sides reached a settlement in early March 1979:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“We’re still friends,” Cindrich told reporters. “The Steelers are the Cadillac of the NFL. We left with a great deal of respect for them. They don’t give anything away, but they’re fair. They’re gentleman. Both sides thought the settlement was extremely fair. Both sides are fortunate the way it worked out.”&lt;ref&gt;March 8, 1979, Tyrone Daily Herald, Tyrone, PA, “Brzoza Wins Settlement From Steelers”&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Creation of Cindrich &amp; Company==
In 1981 Cindrich returned to his native Western Pennsylvania and brought his management firm (now renamed Cindrich &amp; Company) with him. That same year, Cindrich landed his first big-name client, [[Mark May]], the offensive tackle from, the University of Pittsburgh who the [[Washington Redskins]] selected May with their first round pick (20th overall) in the [[1981 NFL Draft]]. After tough negotiations that summer with the Redskins General Manager [[Bobby Bethard]], May signed with the team in late July putting to rest rumors that he would bolt to the Canadian Football League.&lt;ref&gt;July 23, 1981, Daily News-Record, Harrisonburg, VA, “May Gets Extra $100,000 From, Holdout”&lt;/ref&gt; Cindrich continues to represent May in all his television contracts.

By the [[1985 NFL Draft]], Cindrich &amp; Company would represent two top prospects: [[Al Toon]] from the [[University of Wisconsin]] and [[Bill Fralic]] from the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. During [[ESPN]]’s televised coverage of the draft, [[Mel Kiper Jr.]] stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“We’ll see what an impact Ralph Cindrich has on this draft right away. I think Minnesota wanted (Bill) Fralic. I know, you talk about Indianapolis, they would have taken Al Toon but he (Cindrich) wrote a letter to Irsay stating that he didn’t want Toon to play with the Colts. Same with Minnesota. So we’ll see if those teams shy away from Fralic and Toon. We will see if Cindrich has a direct impact on the draft.” &lt;ref name="Cindrich &amp; Company History"&gt;Cindrich &amp; Company History&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cindrich told the press that Fralic would not want to play for the [[Minnesota Vikings]], who held the second overall pick, because of the team’s negotiating history.&lt;ref&gt;April 25, 1985, Indiana Gazette, “Pitt’s Fralic upset over prospect of Minnesota”&lt;/ref&gt;  On Draft Day, the Vikings traded their pick to the Atlanta Falcons for a 1st and 3rd round selection. The [[Atlanta Falcons]] then selected Fralic, who signed the most lucrative contract for any lineman in the draft, including the top overall pick, Buffalo’s Bruce Smith. The ''Atlanta Journal &amp; Atlanta Constitution'' reported that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“Fralic’s contract is so lucrative that it has caused slowdown in the next eleven picks below him in the first round of the draft. No other Number 1 has such an annuity package nor a present value this high. Defensive end Bruce Smith, the draft’s No. 1 pick, signed a $2.8 Million contract for the Buffalo Bills, which is worth $2.1 million in present value. When Fralic signed Monday and first reports of the numbers leaked out, agent Joe Courrege immediately upped the demand for Texas A&amp;M defensive end Ray Childress, the draft’s No. 3 selection.”&lt;ref&gt;July 25, 1985, Atlanta Journal, Atlanta Constitution, “Fralic’s Deal Worth About $6 Million”&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[New York Jets]] selected Toon with the 10th overall pick. He held out, and still without a contract by late August, Cindrich publicly suggested that the Jets trade Toon.&lt;ref&gt;August 28, 1985, New York Times, “Jets Not Counting on Toon for Opener”&lt;/ref&gt; But by Week 2 of the regular season (after New York lost 31-0 to the Los Angeles Raiders), Toon signed a deal reportedly worth $1.6 million over five years, including a signing bonus worth $475,000. The deal paid him more money than any other receiver drafted in 1985, including the San Francisco 49ers first round selection, [[Jerry Rice]].&lt;ref name="Cindrich &amp; Company History"/&gt;

In the [[1988 NFL draft]], Cindrich represented University of Wisconsin Offensive Tackle [[Paul Gruber]], who the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] selected Gruber with the 4th overall pick in the draft. Gruber missed four weeks of training camp but signed a five year, $3.8 million deal with the team in early August. That month, ''[[The Sporting News]]'' declared Cindrich’s negotiations “the most significant contract for any rookie this year” and “the best contract ever signed by an offensive lineman and likely will start a new salary spiral at the position.”&lt;ref&gt;August 29, 1988, The Sporting News, “Linemen’s Pact Sets New Standard”&lt;/ref&gt;

The next year, Cindrich &amp; Company helped facilitate the now famous "[[Herschel Walker trade]]" between the [[Dallas Cowboys]] and Minnesota Vikings. As part of his new contract with the Vikings, Walker received $1.25 million in cash and other considerations (including a [[Mercedes-Benz]]) and more than doubled his previous salary.&lt;ref name="Cindrich &amp; Company History"/&gt;  Cindrich had now negotiated the second and third most lucrative contracts in the NFL. He also achieved considerable salary raises for Pro Bowlers [[John Offerdahl]], linebacker for the Miami Dolphins, Buffalo Bills [[Shane Conlan]] (linebacker), [[Will Wolford]] (offensive tackle), and [[Kent Hull]] (center).

==The 1990s==
Cindrich &amp; Company would go on to represent Pittsburgh Steelers Pro Bowl tight end [[Eric Green (tight end)|Eric Green]], Washington Redskins Pro Bowl wide receiver [[Gary Clark]], Dallas Cowboys Pro Bowl center [[Mark Stepnoski]]. In May 1993, just as the NFL Free Agency boom began, ''[[USA Today]]'' called Cindrich “the undisputed free agent champ.”&lt;ref&gt;May 3, 1993, The Sporting News&lt;/ref&gt;

Multi-million dollar contracts continued throughout the decade. Steelers perennial Pro Bowl center [[Dermontti Dawson]], [[New York Giants]] running back [[Rodney Hampton]], quarterbacks [[Gus Frerotte]] and [[Jeff Blake]], were a few of Cindrich &amp; Company's clients. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, he represented several of the NFL’s top centers: Dawson, Stepnoski, Hull, Miami Dolphin [[Tim Ruddy]], Tampa Bay Buccaneer [[Jeff Christy]], Baltimore Raven [[Mike Flynn (American football)|Mike Flynn]] and Indianapolis Colt [[Jeff Saturday]], and New Orleans Saint [[LeCharles Bentley]].

==The 2000s to today==
Cindrich &amp; Company was sold to DeBartolo Sports, the agency owned by former NFL owner [[Eddie DeBartolo, Jr.]] and Cindrich serves as a consultant to DeBartolo. Nevertheless, he continues to negotiate contracts—through Cindrich &amp; Company—for such notable players as [[Arizona Cardinals]] running Back [[Beanie Wells]], [[Indianapolis Colts]] All Pro Center [[Jeff Saturday]], and Steelers linebacker [[James Farrior]]. Cindrich &amp; Company has also been involved in expanding the field of sports law, developing a study abroad sports law class for students. Cindrich will teach in coordination with the South Texas College of Law during the summer of 2010 in [[Florence, Italy]]. He is also planning a legal education sports law class for lawyers at the same time and location.

==The Blind Side==
Cindrich &amp; Company represented offensive tackle [[Will Wolford]] before the [[1986 NFL Draft]]. The Buffalo Bills selected Wolford with the 20th overall pick and Cindrich negotiated a salary equal to several players drafted in the top 10.&lt;ref name="Cindrich &amp; Company History"/&gt;  In 1993, Cindrich orchestrated Wolford’s free agent signing with Indianapolis, where his contract was worth $7.65 million over three year. Wolford became the highest paid offensive lineman in the NFL. When that contract expired in 1995, Wolford signed a four-year, $10 million with the Pittsburgh Steelers.&lt;ref name="Cindrich &amp; Company History"/&gt;

[[Michael Lewis (author)|Michael Lewis]]’ book, [[The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game|The Blind Side]], which in 2009 was made into a major motion picture starring Sandra Bullock, mentions Wolford’s landmark contract with the Indianapolis Colts. As the man who brokered the deal, Cindrich was also mentioned:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Wolford’s agent, Ralph Cindrich, later said that at least four other teams had been willing to match the Colts’ offer.  What had set the Colts apart from the other bidders was a clause they agreed to insert into Wolford’s new contract.  It guaranteed that Will Wolford, left tackle, would remain the highest paid player on the Colts’ offense for as long as he played on it.  Better paid than the Colts’ running backs, the Colts’ wide receivers, or any of the other acknowledged stars.  Even if the Colts went out and got themselves the NFL’s most expensive quarterback, Wolford’s salary would rise to eclipse his, too.  “I thought linemen would get a little more money from free agency,” said Wolford later.  “But I didn’t think that would happen.  I was numb.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
…The NFL didn’t like the idea of any player having a clause in his contract guaranteeing him more money than his teammates, and it made noises about voiding the deal.  That’s when Ralph Cindrich went on the warpath.  He asked, pointedly, if the league would have the same reservations if the clause had been in some quarterback’s contract.  He accused the league, in the pages of the New York Times, of “discrimination against offensive linemen.”  And the NFL let the deal slide, but only after saying no such deal would be permitted in the future.  “There’s a mentality about linemen that goes back to high school,” said Cindrich.  “When you picked your football team, these were the last guys picked.”&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Michael, The Blind Side, New York: W. &amp; W. Norton &amp; Company, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Cindy Lynn Bradley''' (born December 11, 1977) is an American [[jazz]] [[trumpet]] and [[flugelhorn]] player and composer.

==Early life==
Bradley was born in [[North Tonawanda]] in upstate [[New York (state)|New York]]. She already played [[piano]], but picked up her first trumpet by accident at age nine because it was the only available instrument which she recognized in her teacher's list for school band classes. She began playing traditional jazz as a schoolgirl and went on to gain degrees in jazz studies at [[Ithaca College]] in New York state and in jazz trumpet performance at the [[New England Conservatory]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Cindy Bradley July 3, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Bradley released her debut album ''Just a Little Bit'' on her own label in 2007. In 2009, she signed with Les Cutmore's Trippin' N' Rhythm Records and recorded her second, ''Bloom'', with [[Grammy Award]]-winning producer Michael Broening at his studio in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. ''Bloom'' won instant critical acclaim and Bradley followed it in 2011 with ''[[Unscripted]]''. The hit single from that album, "Massive Transit", co-written by Bradley and Broening, remained at No. 1 on the US [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] Smooth Jazz Songs chart for six weeks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.billboard.com/charts/2011-09-24/jazz-songs Retrieved July 13, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Unscripted'' itself topped the Billboard Jazz Albums chart for two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.billboard.com/charts/2011-07-16/jazz-albums Retrieved July 13, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Often labelled as a [[smooth jazz]] artist – although some critics have found her difficult to categorize at all – Bradley cites her major influences in jazz as fellow-trumpet players [[Freddie Hubbard]], [[Lee Morgan]] and [[Blue Mitchell]]. When she is not touring or playing at jazz festivals, she works as a public elementary school band teacher in [[New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Cindy Bradley July 3, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Cindy is a longtime [[vegan]] and [[animal rights]] advocate.

Bradley's fifth solo album, ''Natural'', was released in March 2017.

A '''constable''' is a person holding a particular office, most commonly in criminal [[Police|law enforcement]]. The office of constable can vary significantly in different jurisdictions. A constable is commonly the rank of an officer within the [[police]]. Other people may be granted powers of a constable without holding this title.
{{TOC limit|3}}

==Etymology==
[[File:Constable Dannatt.jpg|thumb|left|[[Richard Dannatt, Baron Dannatt|General Sir Richard Dannatt]], dressed in the [[formal attire]] of the [[Constable of the Tower]], speaking at the Ceremony of the Constable's Dues, June 2010]]
Historically, the title comes from the [[Latin]] ''[[comes stabuli]]'' ([[comes|attendant]] to the [[stable]]s, literally ''count of the stable'') and originated from the [[Roman Empire]]; originally, the constable was the officer responsible for keeping the [[horse]]s of a [[lord]] or [[monarch]].&lt;ref name="kofk"&gt;p103, Bruce, Alistair, ''Keepers of the Kingdom'' (Cassell, 2002), {{ISBN|0-304-36201-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eb"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9025958/constable Constable], Encyclopædia Britannica online&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title   = The Principles of Policing, p. 7
|author   = Pike, Michael S
|publisher = The Macmillan Press Ltd
|year    = 1985
|isbn    = 0-333-38245-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title was imported to the [[monarchy|monarchies]] of [[Middle Ages|medieval]] Europe, and in many countries developed into a high [[military rank]] and great officer of State (e.g. the [[Constable of France]], in French ''Connétable de France'', who was the commander-in-chief of all royal armed forces (second to the king) until prime minister [[Cardinal Richelieu]] abolished the charge in 1627).

Most constables in modern jurisdictions are [[Police|law enforcement]] officers; in the United Kingdom, the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and some Continental European countries, a constable is the lowest rank of [[police]] officer (it is also, when preceded by the term 'sworn', used to describe any police officer with arrest and other powers), while in the United States a constable is generally an elected [[peace officer]] with lesser jurisdiction than a [[sheriff]]. However, in the [[Channel Islands]] a constable is an elected office-holder at the [[civil parish|parish]] level.

Historically, a constable could also refer to a [[castellan]], the officer charged with the defense of a [[castle]]. Even today, there is a [[Constable of the Tower of London]].

An equivalent position is that of [[Marshal]], which derives from [[Old High German]] ''marah'' "horse" and ''schalh'' "servant",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chambers 20th Century Dictionary|editor=E. M. Kirkpatrick|publisher=W &amp;amp; R Chambers Ltd|location=Edinburgh|year=1983|page=772|isbn=0-550-10234-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and originally meant "stable keeper",&lt;ref&gt;Jacob und Wilhelm Grimm, Deutsches Wörterbuch, Leipzig 1854–1960, Vol. 12 Col. 1673 [http://germazope.uni-trier.de/Projects/WBB/woerterbuecher/dwb/wbgui?lemmode=lemmasearch&amp;amp;mode=hierarchy&amp;amp;textsize=600&amp;amp;onlist=&amp;amp;word=Marschall&amp;amp;lemid=GM01765&amp;amp;query_start=1&amp;amp;totalhits=0&amp;amp;textword=&amp;amp;locpattern=&amp;amp;textpattern=&amp;amp;lemmapattern=&amp;amp;verspattern=#GM01765L0 Online-Version]&lt;/ref&gt; which has a similar etymology. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/marshal |title=marshal |website=www.etymonline.com |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=2018-08-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180803131944/https://www.etymonline.com/word/marshal |archivedate=2018-08-03 |language=en |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern usage by country==
===Australia===
[[File:Nsw-police-force-leading-senior-constable.png|thumb|Rank epaulette of a leading senior constable of the [[New South Wales Police Force]]]]
{{Main article|Australian police ranks}}

In Australia, as in the United Kingdom, constable is the lowest rank in most [[police]] services. It is often categorised into the following from lowest to highest: probationary constable, constable, constable first class, senior constable, leading senior constable. These variations depend on the individual state/territory police force in question.

'''Senior constable''' generally refers to a police officer of the rank above constable and is denoted by way of two chevrons/stripes.

The [[New South Wales Police Force]] has three grades of senior constable, namely senior constable (two chevrons), incremental senior constable (two chevrons and a horizontal bar) and leading senior constable (two chevrons and two horizontal bars). A senior constable is senior to a constable but junior to an incremental senior constable. promotion to senior constable can occur after a miniumum of five years service, one year as a probationary constable in addition to four years as constable and then upon passing probity checks and an exam. Incremental senior constable is attained after ten years of service automatically. One is appointed the rank of leading senior constable on a qualification basis but must have a minimum of seven years service amongst other criteria in order to be eligible. Leading senior constable is a specialist position of which there are limited allocated numbers within any section/unit or local area command. If an officer is transferred to another duty type or station, the officer is then relieved of the position of leading senior constable. It is primarily a position for field training officers who oversee the training and development of inexperienced probationary constables or constables.

Within Victoria Police, a senior constable is the rank above a constable while above a senior constable is a leading senior constable. When first introduced into Victoria Police, the leading senior constable was a classification not a rank, somewhat like "detective". Leading senior constables were appointed specifically to assist in the training and mentoring of more junior members. The last round of wage negotiations however saw leading senior constable become a rank in its own right, one that a lot of members will pass on their way from constable to sergeant though it's not strictly necessary and is permissible to be promoted to sergeant direct from senior constable. The general form of address for both senior constable and leading senior constable is "senior" and this is acceptable even in courts.

===Canada===
In Canada, as in the United Kingdom, constable is the lowest rank in most [[police]] services, including the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/about-ausujet/organi-eng.htm |title=RCMP Organisational Structure |publisher=Rcmp-grc.gc.ca |date=2009-05-19 |accessdate=2009-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Newfoundland the provincial police are the [[Royal Newfoundland Constabulary]] whereby all officers are addressed by the term "constable." In addition, the [[chief of police|chief officers]] of some [[municipality|municipal]] police services in Canada, notably [[Vancouver Police Department]], carry the title of [[Chief Constable]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120729001602/http://www.city.vancouver.bc.ca/police/chief/profiles/CCJimChu.htm Chief Constable's Office], Vancouver Police Department&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Canadian French]], constable is translated to ''agent'', except in the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] where it is translated as ''[[Gendarmerie|Gendarme]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/about/organi_f.htm RCMP Organisational Structure] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022072347/http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/about/organi_f.htm |date=October 22, 2008 }} (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;)

Appointments can further be separated into:
* [[Special constable#Canada|Special Constables]]
** RCMP Special Constables are appointed for specific skills, for example, aboriginal language skills. They are [[Peace officer#Canada|peace officers]] under the ''[[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] Act''.
** Outside of RCMP, special constables are not police officers but are appointed to serve certain law enforcement functions. For example, [[Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|SPCA agents]] or court/jail security officers.
* [[Auxiliary Constable]] or Reserve Constable are volunteers with a policing agency. They generally only have peace officer status when engaged in specific authorized tasks only.
* Provincial Civil Constables (in [[Nova Scotia]]) deal with matters of a civil nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ns.ca/snsmr/paal/just/paal238.asp |title=Special Constable and Provincial Civil Constable: Appointments |publisher=Gov.ns.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
In the Danish armed forces the ranks "Konstabel", "Overkonstabel" and "Overkonstabel af 1. grad" are used for professional enlisted soldiers, sailors and airmen. The rank is more or less equal to a Private (rank), Private 1st class (rank) and Lance corporal (rank) but higher than the rank "menig" which literally translates into "private" and only applies to drafted soldiers.

===Finland===
In the [[Law enforcement in Finland|Finnish Police]], the lowest rank of [[police]] officer is called ''nuorempi konstaapeli'', translated into English as (Junior) Constable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.police.fi/poliisi/home.nsf/Pages/00FFD94F50737E44C2256BB800440F18 Rank insignia of a Constable] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325232923/http://www.police.fi/poliisi/home.nsf/Pages/00FFD94F50737E44C2256BB800440F18 |date=2012-03-25 }}, Finnish Police website (in English)&lt;/ref&gt;
The next rank is ''vanhempi konstaapeli'' or Senior Constable.
The next highest rank (equivalent to a Police [[Sergeant]] in the English-speaking world) is ''ylikonstaapeli'' (''yli-'' "leading"), literally "Over-Constable".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.police.fi/poliisi/home.nsf/Pages/9EE2C8FCADCC3EE3C2256BB80043C3FE Rank insignia of a Senior Constable] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325233155/http://www.police.fi/poliisi/home.nsf/Pages/9EE2C8FCADCC3EE3C2256BB80043C3FE |date=2012-03-25 }}, Finnish Police Website (in English)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===
The [[Hong Kong Police Force]] have two ranks for constables:

* Senior constable—lead officer in a beat patrol; SPCs wear a single chevron on their shoulder above their unique identification (UI) number.
* Constable—officer in a beat patrol; PCs wear no insignia other than the unique identification (UI) number.

Senior Constable is not a rank – it is merely a designation for officers who have served for 18 years.

===India===
[[File:Police Constable.JPG|thumb|[[Mumbai Police]] Constable, January 26, 2001]]

Police constable (abbreviated PC) is the lowest police rank in India, followed by [[head constable]]. General [[Law enforcement in India|law and order]] being a state subject in India, each state government recruits police constables. A police constable has no shoulder insignia, while a head constable has one strip or one chevron, depending upon the state. All senior officers are [[Indian Police Service]] officers appointed through [[Civil service examination|civil services exam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onestopias.com/indian-police-service/modern-ranks.asp |title=Onestopias.com |publisher=Onestopias.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since each state has its own police force, the uniforms and insignia of the police vary, though the [[List of police ranks in India|rank structure]] is the same. The central paramilitary forces under the Ministry of Internal Affairs also maintain the same ranks as state police even though their jurisdiction varies considerably. All the police constables wear khaki-coloured uniforms which indicate that he/she is a police officer.

===Norway===
In the [[Norwegian Police Service]] the rank "politikonstabel" was until 2003 the lowest rank in the police, the next ranks being "politioverkonstabel", "politibetjent", "politiførstebetjent", "politioverbetjent" and "politistasjonssjef", "lensmann" or "sysselmannsoverbetjent" (all officially translated as chief superintendent). In 2003, the ranks "politikonstabel", "politioverkonstabel" and "politibetjent" were renamed "politibetjent 1", "politibetjent 2" and "politibetjent 3", where "politibetjent 1" is the entry-level rank for a policeman and most junior rank of the police service. All ranks higher than chief superintendent are commissioned ranks, known simply as "higher ranks," and traditionally required a law degree. The Norwegian Police Service has an integrated prosecution service in which the police lawyers, who all hold higher ranks, require the law degree "[[cand.jur.|candidatus/candidata juris]]" or "Master of Laws" (''master i rettsvitenskap''), awarded after 5 or 6 years of law studies. Following reforms of the police, a law degree is no longer required by law for all higher ranks, although only lawyers can act as prosecutors and supervise criminal investigations, for which reason it is still common for those holding higher ranks to be lawyers. The entry-level rank for a lawyer, Junior Police Prosecutor, outranks the most senior rank for a policeman, Chief Superintendent, as the former is the most junior of the "higher ranks" whereas the latter is the most senior of the "lower ranks."

The fire brigades (all municipal) still use "konstabel" as in "brannkonstabel" (fire-constable).

===Pakistan===
In [[Pakistan]], constable and head constable are, respectively, the lowest and second lowest ranks in police force.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pakistanhotline.com/2016/11/pakistan-police-ranks-badges-and-grades.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Singapore===
In [[Singapore]], a police constable (abbreviated to PC) is the lowest rank in the [[Singapore Police Force]]. The rank of Special Constable exists, but is centralised under the Special Volunteer Constabulary in Singapore.

===Sri Lanka===
In [[Sri Lanka]], the [[Sri Lanka Police]] has the rank of "Police Constable" with four classes.

===United Kingdom===
{{main article|Police ranks of the United Kingdom|Special Constabulary|War Reserve Constable}}
[[File:Met PC Epaulette.svg|Met PC Epaulette|thumb|upright|An [[epaulette]] showing an officer's divisional code (DF) and individual number.]]
In the modern times, there are two main definitions of a constable in the United Kingdom:
*The lowest rank of a police force.
*A legal term for an officer with [[Powers of the police in England and Wales|the powers of a police officer]].
The latter usage is mainly used in formal contexts, including legislation such as the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]]. By this definition, all police officers are constables, even those that do not hold the actual rank of constable. Thus the head of most police forces is a [[chief constable]], volunteer officers of any rank are known as [[Special Constabulary|special constables]] and some police forces have the word "Constabulary" in their name. There are also some constables who are not police officers, such as [[cathedral constables]] and [[Cambridge University Constabulary|Cambridge University constables]].

Within the police itself, there are three [[wikt:eponymous|eponymous]] offices bearing the legal power of constable: Police Constable, Detective Constable and Special Constable. The former two of these are paid, mostly full-time positions, while those holding the role of Special Constable volunteer their time unpaid and do so around their normal working commitments. The ranks of Police Constable and Detective Constable are often abbreviated in everyday use to PC and DC respectively. From 1919 when they were first recruited in the UK, female police officers were distinguished from their male counterparts by the prefix 'woman' before their rank (WPC or WDC). This was officially discontinued in 1999, although is still sometimes used informally by members of the public.

====Constable====
Constable is the [[Police ranks of the United Kingdom|first rank]], one rank below a sergeant and five ranks below chief superintendent in all [[List of police forces in England sorted by county|police forces]] in the United Kingdom.

Within the [[Law enforcement in the United Kingdom|British Police]] all [[police officer]]s are sworn in as and hold the basic powers of a constable. Upon being sworn in, each officer starts at the rank of constable and is required to undergo a two-year [[Probation (workplace)|probationary period]]. Upon successful completion, constables can remain at their current rank, specialise in [[Criminal Investigation Department|criminal investigations]] or one of many other specialist units, or apply for promotion to [[Sergeant#Police 7|sergeant]], the first supervisory rank. Constables wear an epaulette attached to the [[Police uniforms and equipment in the United Kingdom|uniform]], displaying their [[collar number]] (also called a shoulder number). Within [[Greater London]]'s [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]], all constables and sergeants display a [[Police division|divisional]] call sign, as well as an individual number.

A new probationary constable within a county police force is paid an annual salary of £23,259, with this rising to £25,962 after training, reaching a ceiling level of £36,519. Constables within the [[Metropolitan Police Service]] are paid an additional [[London weighting]] allowance which is currently set at £2,277.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.policeoracle.com/pay_and_conditions/police_pay_scales.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The first female constables were employed by railway constabularies during World War I with for example the North East Railway Police swearing in four in late 1917&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.btp.police.uk/about_us/our_history/policewomen_on_the_railways.aspx Policewomen on the railways]&lt;/ref&gt; The term '''Woman Police Constable''' was used across British forces.

====Detective Constable====
The rank of detective constable (DC) is a special type but not senior to that of a uniformed constable; the '[[detective]]' prefix identifies the officer as being part of [[Criminal Investigation Department|CID]] or other investigative unit.

====Special Constable====
From 1673 to 1831, a [[Special Constabulary|special constable]] was a citizen who was appointed to act as constable on special occasions, such as to quell a riot. In 1831 this evolved to a permanent volunteer police force. Special constables generally had powers within a designated area. However, legislation changed to give them identical powers as constables that are no longer regional but are enforceable across England and Wales.

====War Reserve Constable====
During World War II, there was an additional volunteer War Reserve Police introduced in 1939, consisting at its height in 1944 of 17,000 War Reserve constables (or WRC, War Reserve Police Constable, WRPC). The rank of WRC/WRPC was dissolved on 31 December 1948, and most of these were then recruited for service as regular or special constables.

====Head constable====
Head constable is a title for a police sergeant in some Commonwealth police forces. It was also previously a senior rank in the [[Royal Irish Constabulary]], with authority lying somewhere between the ranks of Inspector and Superintendent in later British and Irish police forces.

====Legislation====
Legislation existed to appoint constables, but often did not direct how such bodies should operate and what organisational form they should take. The [[Police Act 1964]] standardised arrangements through establishing wider geographical police forces, which merged many constabularies. The Police Act 1964 gave direction on the organisational form of police forces, the appointment of officers and disciplinary matters; in the broadest sense it provided a statutory governance framework. The Act established the 'tripartite' model of policing, which formed [[police authority|police authorities]]. This established a three-way balance of power between the Authority's Chairman, the Chief Constable and the Home Secretary. This arrangement varied within London for the Metropolitan Police and the City of London Police.

The Police Act 1964 was superseded by the Police Act 1996, which contained similar provisions. Further legislation was introduced for the British Transport Police and the Civil Nuclear Constabulary that was similar in defining their organisational form and embedding governance arrangements.

Legislation still exists to appoint constables that are not technically part of a police force. For example, local authorities can appoint constables to enforce parks by-laws and such officers are employed by the local authority.

Legislation provides for the appointment of constables to police ports, tunnels, [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] Universities, [[Epping Forest]], Anglican cathedrals ([[Cathedral constable]]s), and markets. Such bodies are often referred to as 'private constabularies'.

====Similarly empowered law enforcement officers====
Legislation exists that allows for three main categories of state officer to have the powers of constable, without being sworn in as such.
#[[Bailiff|Water Bailiffs]], who check fishing permits and enforce some wildlife law.
#Other staff charged with enforcing environmental crime such as pollution of water, illegal waste disposal or damage to natural plants or animals. Such staff are typically employed by the [[Environment Agency]], [[Natural Resources Wales]] or [[Scottish Environmental Protection Agency]].
#Every prison officer while acting as such shall have all the powers, authority, protection and privileges of a constable.

4.[[National Crime Agency]] (formerly SOCA) can also designate their officers with the power of a constable (as well as the specific powers of an Immigration Officer or Customs. Being given the power of a constable gives such individuals lawful excuse to carry offensive weapons and firearms while on duty).

====Channel Islands====
{{main article|Connétable (Jersey and Guernsey)|}}

In [[Jersey]] and [[Guernsey]], the elected heads of the [[Parish (subnational entity)|Parish]]es (''paroisse(s)'' in French) are titled "constables" (''connétable(s)'' in French). The constables are entitled each to carry a silver-tipped baton of office.

In Jersey, each [[Parishes of Jersey|parish]] elects a constable for a three-year mandate to run the parish and also represent the parish in the legislature, the [[States of Jersey]]. The constable presides over the Roads Committee, the Conseil Paroissial (Parish Council, the only exception being St. Helier) and Parish Assemblies. The twelve constables also collectively sit as the Comité des Connétables (Committee of Constables). The constable is the titular head of the [[Honorary Police]]. With the Roads Inspectors, Roads Committee and other officers, the constable of each parish also carries out the ''[[Visite du Branchage|visites du branchage]]'' twice a year.

In Guernsey, each [[Parishes of Guernsey|parish]] elects two constables, the senior constable and the junior constable. Persons elected generally serve a year as junior and then senior constable. The senior constable presides over the Douzaine (Dozen) that runs the parish. The constables are responsible for enforcing the ''brancage'' (summer hedge-cutting) and also have the power to declare any parishioner [[insane]].

===United States===
{{Main|Constables in the United States}}

In the United States, there is no consistent use of the office of constable throughout the states, and use may even vary within a state. A constable may be an official responsible for [[service of process]]: such as [[summons]]es and [[subpoena]]s for people to appear in court in criminal and/or civil matters. On the other hand, they can be fully empowered [[Police|law enforcement]] officers. Constables may also have additional specialized duties unique to the office. In some states, a constable may be appointed by the governor or a judge or magistrate of the court which he or she serves; in others the constable is an elected or appointed position at the state or local level of local government. Their jurisdiction can vary from statewide to county/parish and local township boundaries based on the state's laws.

The office developed from its British counterpart during the colonial period. Prior to the modernization of law enforcement which took place in the middle 19th century, local law enforcement was performed by constables and [[Watchmen (law enforcers)|watchmen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.ncwc.edu/TOCONNOR/205/205lect04.htm A Brief Guide to Police History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071216153655/http://faculty.ncwc.edu/TOCONNOR/205/205lect04.htm |date=2007-12-16 }}, North Carolina Wesleyan College&lt;/ref&gt; Constables were appointed or elected at the local level for specific terms and, like their UK counterparts the [[parish constable]], were not paid and did not wear a uniform. However, they were often paid a fee by the courts for each [[writ]] served and [[Warrant (law)|warrant]] executed. Following the example of the British [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] established in 1829, the states gradually enacted laws to permit municipalities to establish police departments. This differed from the UK in that the old system was not uniformly abolished in every state. Often the enacting legislation of the state conferred a police officer with the powers of a constable, the most important of these powers being the [[common law]] power of arrest. Police and constables exist concurrently in many jurisdictions. Perhaps because of this, the title "constable" is not used for police of any rank. The lowest rank in a police organization would be officer, deputy, patrolman, [[Trooper (police rank)|trooper]], and historically, [[private (rank)|private]], depending on the particular organization.

In many states, constables do not conduct patrols or preventive policing activities. In such states the office is relatively obscure to its citizens.

A constable may be assisted by deputy constables as sworn officers or constable's officers as civil staff, usually as process servers. In some states, villages or towns, an office with similar duties is [[marshal]].

==Historical usage==
===Medieval Armenia and Georgia===
The titles of ''[[sparapet]]'' and ''[[spaspet]]'', derived from the ancient Iranian ''[[spahbod]]'', were used to designate the supreme commander of the armed forces in the medieval kingdoms of Armenia and Georgia, respectively.

===Byzantine Empire===
The position of constable originated from the [[Roman Empire]]; by the 5th century AD the [[Count of the Stable]] ({{lang-la|comes stabuli}}) was responsible for the keeping of [[horse]]s at the imperial court.&lt;ref name="eb"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | editor-first = Alexander | editor-last = Kazhdan | editor-link = Alexander Kazhdan | title = [[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]] | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1991 | isbn = 978-0-19-504652-6 | page=1140 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}{{Cite book | editor-first = A H M | editor-last = Jones | editor-link = A H M Jones | title = [[The Later Roman Empire 284-602]] | publisher = Blackwell | year = 1964 | isbn = 0-631-15250-4 | page=625 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The West European term "constable" itself was adopted, via the [[Normans]], as ''[[konostaulos]]'' in the [[Komnenian period|Komnenian]] and [[Palaiologan period|Palaiologan]] periods, when it became a high military office of dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | editor-first = Alexander | editor-last = Kazhdan | editor-link = Alexander Kazhdan | title = Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1991 | isbn = 978-0-19-504652-6 | page=1147 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late Roman administrative titles were used by [[Charlemagne]] in developing his empire; the position of Constable, along with the similar office of [[Marshal]], spread throughout the emerging states of Western Europe during this period.&lt;ref name="kofk"/&gt; In most medieval nations, the constable was the highest-ranking officer of the army, and was responsible for the overseeing of [[martial law]].&lt;ref name="h"&gt;p172, Slater, Stephen, ''The Complete Book of Heraldry'' (Lorenz, 2002), {{ISBN|0-7548-1062-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
{{Main article|Constable of France}}
The Constable of France (''Connétable de France''), under the [[French monarchy]], was the [[Great Officers of the Crown of France|First Officer of the Crown of France]] and was originally responsible for commanding the [[army]]. His symbol of office was a longsword held by a hand issuing out of a cloud, a reference to the constable's duty of carrying the king's sword during a coronation ceremony.&lt;ref name="h"/&gt; Some constables were prominent military commanders in the medieval period, such as [[Bertrand du Guesclin]] who served from 1370 to 1380.

===United Kingdom===
{{See also|Lord High Constable (disambiguation)|Parish constable}}
The office of the constable was introduced in England following the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest of 1066]] and was responsible for the keeping and maintenance of the king's armaments and those of the villages as a measure of protecting individual settlements throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vronsky|first=Peter|title=A Brief History of Constables in the English Speaking World|url=http://www.russianbooks.org/crime/cph1.htm|accessdate=2007-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authorities place the origins of constables in England earlier, attributing the creation of the office during the reign of King Alfred (871, A.D.).&lt;ref&gt;Hanes, ''A Practical Treatise on the Powers and Duties of Justices of the Peace and in the State of Illinois'' (4th Ed., 1868) at p.688. See, also, Sir William Blackstone, ''Commentaries on the Laws of England in Four Books'', Vol. 1 (1753) at p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt;

The office of [[Lord High Constable (disambiguation)|Lord High Constable]], one of the [[Great Officer of State|Great Officers of State]], was established in the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] during the reigns of [[Stephen of England|King Stephen]] (1135–1154) and [[David I of Scotland|King David]] (1124–1154) respectively, and was responsible for the command of the army. The term was also used at the local level within the [[feudal system]] however, describing an officer appointed to keep order.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, Alistair, ''Keepers of the Kingdom'' (Cassell, 2002), p. 72, {{ISBN|0-304-36201-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first descriptions of one of the legal duties of a constable, that of the collation of [[evidence]], comes from [[Bracton]], a jurist writing between 1220 and 1250:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bracton Online |publisher=Harvard Law School Library |url=http://bracton.law.harvard.edu/ |accessdate=2007-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;In whatever way they come and on whatever day, it is the duty of the constable to [[wikt:enroll|enroll]] everything in order, for he has record as to the things he sees; but he cannot judge, because there is no judgment at the [[Tower of London|Tower]], since there the third element of a judicial proceeding is lacking, namely a judge and jurisdiction. He has record as to matters of fact, not matters of judgment and law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry of Bratton|others=Translated by Samuel E. Thorne|year=1968|publisher=Belknap Press|title=Bracton On the Laws and Customs of England|location=Cambridge, MS|url=http://hlsl5.law.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/brac-hilite.cgi?Unframed+English+4+136+constable|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120711202113/http://hlsl5.law.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/brac-hilite.cgi?Unframed+English+4+136+constable|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-07-11|isbn=0-19-626613-0|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; In Bracton's time, anyone seeing a "misdeed" was empowered to make an arrest. The role of the constable in Bracton's description was as the "eyes and ears" of the court, finding evidence and recording facts on which judges could make a ruling. By extension, the constable was also the "strong arm" of the court (i.e., of the [[common law]]), marking the basic role of the constable that continues into the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=DeLloyd J.|last=Guth|contribution=The Traditional Common Law Constable, 1235–1829: From Bracton to the Fieldings to Canada|editor-last=Macleod|editor-first=R.C.|editor2-last=Schneiderman|editor2-first=David|title=Police Powers in Canada: The Evolution and Practice of Authority|publisher=University of Toronto Press|place=Toronto|year=1994|page=6|isbn=0-8020-2863-2|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1285, King [[Edward I of England]] passed the [[Statute of Winchester]], with provisions which "constituted two constables in every [[hundred (county subdivision)|hundred]] to prevent [[wikt:default|default]]s in towns and [on] highways".&lt;ref name="fm"&gt;p276-7, Markham, Sir Frank, ''History of Milton Keynes and District'', vol.1 (1973), {{ISBN|0-900804-29-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Records of their narrower area successors, [[ecclesiastical parish|parish]] constables, appear in the early 17th century in the records of [[Buckinghamshire]]; traditionally they were elected by the [[vestry|parishioners]], but from 1617 onwards were typically appointed by [[justices of the peace]] (magistrates) in each county.&lt;ref name="fm"/&gt;

The system of policing by unpaid parish constables continued in England until the 19th century; in the [[London]] metropolitan area it was ended by the creation of the [[Metropolitan Police]] by the [[Metropolitan Police Act 1829]],&lt;ref&gt;p591, Inwood, Stephen, ''A History of London'' (Macmillan, 1998), {{ISBN|0-333-67154-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the County Police Constabularies outside London by the [[County Police Act 1839]]. Together these led to all [[county|counties]] having various constabularies of full-time professionals. The lowest rank of the police forces and constabularies is "constable", and most outside London are headed by a [[chief constable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.wiltshire.police.uk/history/1839.asp |title=Wiltshire Constabulary History - "The First and the Best" |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218212229/http://www.wiltshire.police.uk/history/1839.asp |archive-date=2007-12-18 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.essex.police.uk/offbeat/o_mu_25.php The Making of a Chief Constable] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927092346/http://www.essex.police.uk/offbeat/o_mu_25.php |date=2007-09-27}}, Essex Police website&lt;/ref&gt;

The unique office of 'Parks Constable' was first created when Liverpool Corporation Act 1921 (Section 221) allowed for their appointment;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Liverpool Parks Police History ‘Timeline’ |url=http://www.liverpoolparkspolice.co.uk/parks-police-history.htm |website=www.liverpoolparkspolice.co.uk |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180803132434/http://www.liverpoolparkspolice.co.uk/parks-police-history.htm |archivedate=2018-08-03 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; although a body of constables had previously policed the parks whom were attested as special constables. Specific legislation for the [[Royal Parks of London]] continued the unique office of 'Parks Constable'. However, the Royal Parks Constabulary was disbanded in 2001. The [[Kew Constabulary]] are sworn in under the same legislation and remain as the holders of the office of Parks Constable. Whilst some local authorities have parks constabularies, their officers are attested as constables, not parks constables.

===Other European nations===
The position of hereditary constable persists in some current or former [[monarchy|monarchies]] of Europe. The position of [[Lord High Constable of Scotland]] is hereditary in the family of the [[Earl of Erroll]]. There is also a hereditary constable of [[Navarre]] in Spain; this position is presently held by the [[Duchess of Alba]].&lt;ref name="h"/&gt;

Historically, many other hereditary constables existed as officers of state in former monarchies. Examples are the [[Constable of Castile]] (''Condestable de Castilla'') and the [[Constable of Portugal]] (''Condestável do Reino'').

'''Corporate tax in the Netherlands''' deals with the tax payable in [[the Netherlands]] on the profits earned by companies. In general, a Dutch company is subject to 25% corporate tax ("vennootschapsbelasting") on its worldwide profits. However, certain items of income are exempt from tax and certain costs are non-deductible.

==Worldwide profits==
A Dutch company is subject to Dutch corporate tax on its worldwide profits, after taking into account tax deductible costs. 

==Rate==
The 2013 Dutch corporate tax rate was 20% of the taxable income up to and including €200,000, above which the rate is 25%.

==Exemptions==
Certain items of income are exempt from Dutch corporate tax. The most important items of income that are exempt are:

* capital gains and dividends derived from qualifying subsidiaries ("participation exemption")
* income attributable to a foreign business enterprise ("permanent establishment").

===Participation exemption===
Capital gains, dividends and profit participation loan interest derived from a qualifying subsidiary are fully exempt from corporate tax in the Netherlands ("participation exemption"). A subsidiary qualifies for the Dutch participation exemption when:

* the subsidiary is an active company, and
* the Dutch parent company holds an interest of at least 5% of such company.

===Foreign branch===
Any income received by a Dutch company from a foreign branch is exempt from Dutch corporate tax, provided such branch is a permanent establishment or representative.{{cn|date=April 2012}}

==Tax haven==
{{see also|Dutch Sandwich (tax avoidance)}}
The Netherlands has been known internationally, since at least the 1970s, as a [[tax haven]]. A political debate about this issue started in 1977, when economist and [[Labor Party (Netherlands)|social-democratic]] MP [[Flip de Kam]] published a book about corporations transferring large sums to Caribbean countries without paying Dutch corporate tax. Minister [[Fons van der Stee|Van der Stee]] admitted that the country was internationally known as a tax haven, but refused to act, arguing that the problem could not be solved on a national level alone.&lt;ref name="vn"&gt;{{cite newspaper |title=Nederland belastingparadijs, met dank aan de PvdA |newspaper=[[Vrij Nederland]] |first1=Tomas |last1=Vanheste |first2=Map |last2=Oberndorff |url=http://www.vn.nl/nederland-belastingparadijs-met-dank-aan-de-pvda/ |trans-title=The Netherlands a tax haven, thanks to the Labor Party |date=6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate raged for years; in 1986, [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|Representative]] [[Willem Vermeend]] estimated that the country's tax service missed some [[Dutch guilder|ƒ]]4 billion per year due to companies such as [[The Rolling Stones]]' holding [[Besloten vennootschap|bv]]'s using the "Caribbean route".{{r|vn}}

Dutch tax laws have brought the country into conflict with the [[European Union]] several times, starting with strong criticism in the 1999 [[Dawn Primarolo|Primarolo]] Report. The Dutch government responded by having a group of high-ranking fiscal experts (known with the [[Ministry of Finance (Netherlands)|Ministry of Finance]] as the "[[Barbapapa]] group") create a smoke screen, changing the appearance of the fiscal system while leaving its structure intact.{{r|vn}}

Starting 2009, the "tax haven" label resurfaced and sparked political controversy when the [[White House]] issued a press release in which the Netherlands was mentioned as tax haven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taxjustice.nl/?nid=62060|title=The Netherlands a tax haven, a misunderstanding?|publisher=Tax Justice nl|accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2009/05/us_tax_haven_claim_surprises_d.php|title=US tax haven claim surprises Dutch|date=5 May 2009|publisher=DutchNews.nl|accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to various NGO's the Netherlands "can be seen as an intermediary tax haven for foreign corporations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://somo.nl/news-en/new-tax-treaty-policy-prejudices-developing-countries/|title=New tax treaty policy prejudices developing countries|date=20 April 2011|publisher=Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations|accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Michielse|first=Geerten|date=24 February 2011|title=Mag het een beetje minder koopman zijn?|publisher=Tijdschrift voor Fiscaal Recht|url=http://www.michielse.com/files/NTFR_2011-379.pdf|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="masters"&gt;{{cite newspaper |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/oct/19/tax-avoidance-in-netherlands-becomes-focus-of-campaigners |date=19 October 2011 |title=Dutch masters of tax avoidance |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2013, the Dutch House of Representatives accepted a motion calling on cabinet members to "reject, and where possible in discussions to insist on not mentioning" the qualification of the country as a tax haven; the motion was drafted by MP [[Roland van Vliet]], a former tax advisor with [[Ernst &amp; Young]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper |title=Geert Wilders houdt wél van belastingparadijs Nederland |trans-title=Geert Wilders does love Holland, the tax haven |first=Henk Willem |last=Smits |url=http://www.quotenet.nl/Nieuws/Geert-Wilders-houdt-wel-van-belastingparadijs-Nederland-53310 |date=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Economist {{ill|Ewald Engelen|nl}} estimated that at the time of the motion, the state earned some €1.5 billion in tax from €12 thousand billion being transferred through the country annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |first=Ewald |last=Engelen |title=Nederland is een topplek voor belastingontwijking |trans-title=Holland is a great place for tax avoidance |date=16 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2013}}, the country harbors [[holding company|holding companies]] for various multinationals, participates in more than a hundred bilateral [[tax treaty|tax treaties]], and the various [[#Exemptions|exemptions]] facilitate [[tax avoidance]] by corporations.{{r|vn}}{{r|masters}}

In June 2014 the EU initiated a new investigation relating to the Dutch corporate taxes as part of a [[State aid (European Union)]] case by the Directorate General for Competition. The case was specific to [[Starbucks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-11-14/starbucks-dutch-tax-deal-clashes-with-global-rules-eu|title=Starbucks Unit Swapped Millions of Euros for Roasting Art|publisher=Bloomberg|date=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The investigation ended in October 2015, with the EC ordering Starbucks to pay up to €30 million in overdue taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-5880_en.htm|title=Commission decides selective tax advantages for Fiat in Luxembourg and Starbucks in the Netherlands are illegal under EU state aid rules|publisher=European Commission|date=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EC exposed in its decision a legal structure commonly used by companies established in the Netherlands to avoid corporate taxation, the so called Dutch BV-CV structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ibfd.org/IBFD-Products/Journal-Articles/Bulletin-for-International-Taxation/collections/bit/html/bit_2016_03_nl_1.html|title=European Union/Netherlands - Dutch CV-BV Structures: Starbucks-Style Tax Planning and State Aid Rules.|publisher=IBFD|date=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2017, the EU initiated another [[State aid (European Union)]] investigation into a special deal on corporate taxation between the Dutch public administration and [[IKEA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-17-5343_en.htm
|title=State aid: Commission opens in-depth investigation into the Netherlands' tax treatment of Inter IKEA|publisher=European Commission|date=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

National and foreign companies known to have special agreements with the Dutch tax service include Starbucks, [[Microsoft]] and [[PostNL]]. A 2015 [[Freedom of information laws by country#Netherlands|FOI]] request by ''[[de Volkskrant]]'' to unearth the agreements failed, because these secret agreements are not centrally administered by the [[Tax and Customs Administration]]; with even the House of Representatives not having access to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |title=Belastingdienst: geen zicht op deals met bedrijven |trans-title=Tax Administration: no overview of deals with corporations |url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/belastingdienst-geen-zicht-op-deals-met-bedrijven~a4168976/ |newspaper=De Volkskrant |date=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{War}}

A '''court-martial''' or '''court martial''' (plural ''courts-martial'' or ''courts martial'', as "martial" is a [[postpositive adjective]]) is a military court or a trial conducted in such a court. A court-martial is empowered to determine the guilt of members of the [[military|armed forces]] subject to [[Military justice|military law]], and, if the defendant is found guilty, to decide upon punishment. In addition, courts-martial may be used to try [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] for [[war crime]]s. The [[Geneva Conventions|Geneva Convention]] requires that [[Prisoner of war|POWs]] who are on [[trial]] for war crimes be subject to the same procedures as would be the holding [[military]]'s own forces. Finally, courts-martial can be convened for other purposes, such as dealing with violations of [[martial law]], and can involve civilian defendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.ca/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1309&amp;context=faculty_scholarship |title=Persons Who Can Be Tried by Court-Martial |author=[[Robinson O. Everett]] |publisher=[[Duke University School of Law]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://scholarship.law.nd.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.ca/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=3831&amp;context=ndlr |title=Jurisdiction of Naval Courts Martial over Civilians |author=James Snedeker |journal=[[Notre Dame Law Review]] |volume=24 |issue=4 |date=October 1, 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[navy|navies]] have a standard court-martial which convenes whenever a ship is lost; this does not presume that the captain is suspected of wrongdoing, but merely that the circumstances surrounding the loss of the ship be made part of the official record. Most military forces maintain a judicial system that tries defendants for breaches of military discipline. Some countries like [[France]] and [[Germany]] have no courts-martial in times of peace and use civilian courts instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senat.fr/lc/lc83/lc830.html Note about the military justice], French Senat&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hyphenation ==
Court-martial is hyphenated in US usage, whether used as a noun or verb.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/court-martial ''court-martial''] at www.merriam-webster.com. Retrieved 23 Feb 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in British usage, a hyphen is used to distinguish between the noun, "court martial", and the verb, "to court-martial".&lt;ref&gt;[https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/court-martial ''court martial''] at dictionary.cambridge.org. Retrieved 23 Feb 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition ==

Usually, a court-martial takes the form of a trial with a presiding judge, a prosecutor and defensive counsel (all trained lawyers as well as officers) and (in some cases) a panel of officers (and sometimes enlisted personnel) acting as jury.  The precise format varies from one country to another and may also depend on the severity of the accusation.

== Jurisdiction ==

Courts-martial have the authority to try a wide range of military offences, many of which closely resemble civilian crimes like fraud, theft or perjury. Others, like cowardice, desertion, and insubordination, are purely military crimes. Military offences are defined in the Armed Forces Act 2006 for members of the British Military. Regulations for the [[Canadian Forces]] are found in the [[Queen's Regulations and Orders for the Canadian Forces|Queen's Regulations and Orders]] as well as the [[National Defence Act]]. For members of the [[United States armed forces]] offenses are covered under the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] (UCMJ). These offences, as well as their corresponding punishments and instructions on how to conduct a court-martial, are explained in detail based on each country and/or service.

== By country ==

=== Canada ===

In Canada, there is a two-tier military trial system. Summary trials are presided over by superior officers, while more significant matters are heard by courts martial, which are presided over by independent military judges serving under the independent Office of the Chief Military Judge. Appeals are heard by the [[Court Martial Appeal Court of Canada]]. [[Capital punishment in Canada]] was abolished generally in 1976, and for military offences in 1998. [[Harold Pringle]] was the last Canadian soldier executed, in 1945, for a military offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = A keen soldier: the execution of second world war private harold pringle | journal = National Defence and the Canadian Forces | date = 14 July 2008 | first = Andrew | last = Clark | url = http://www.journal.forces.gc.ca/vo4/no2/book-livre-04-eng.asp | accessdate = 8 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finland===
In Finland, the military has jurisdiction over two types of crimes: those that can be committed only by military personnel and those normal crimes by military persons where both the defendant and the victim are military persons or organizations and the crime has been defined in law as falling under military jurisdiction. The former category includes e.g. various types of disobedience and absence without leave, while the latter category includes e.g. murder, assault, theft, fraud and forgery. However, [[war crimes]] and sexual crimes are not under military jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="SOKL"&gt;[https://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1983/19830326 Sotilasoikeudenkäyntilaki. (326/1983)]. (Act on military trials). Retrieved 30 August 2015. {{Fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|§ 2}}

In crimes where the military has jurisdiction, the military conducts the investigation. In non-trivial cases, this is done by the investigative section of [[Defence Command (Finland)|Defence Command]] or by civilian police, but trivial cases are investigated by the defendant's own unit. The civilian police has always to right to take the case from the military.&lt;ref name="SKPL"&gt;[https://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/2014/20140255 Laki sotilaskurinpidosta ja rikostorjunnasta puolustusvoimissa (255/2014)] (Act on maintenance of military discipline and crime fighting in the Defense Forces). Retrieved 2015-0i-30. {{Fi}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|§§28, 35, 39}}

If the case does not warrant a punishment greater than a fine or a disciplinary punishment, the punishment is given summarily by the company, battalion or brigade commander, depending on severity of the crime. If the brigade commander feels that the crime warrants a punishment more severe than he can give, he refers the case to the local district attorney who commences prosecution.&lt;ref name="SKPL" /&gt;{{rp|§§46–48}}

The crimes with military jurisdiction are handled by the civilian district court which has a special composition. In military cases, the court consists of a civilian legally trained judge and two military members: an officer and a warrant officer, an NCO or a private soldier. The verdict and the sentence are decided by a majority of votes. However, the court cannot give a more severe sentence than the learned member supports. The appeals can be made as in civilian trials. If a court of appeals handles a military matter, it will have an officer member with at least a major's rank. The [[Supreme Court of Finland]] has, in military cases, two general officers as members.&lt;ref name="SOKL" /&gt;{{rp|Ch. 3}}

Courts-martial proper are instituted only during a war, by the decree of the government. Such courts-martial have jurisdiction over all crimes committed by military persons. In addition, they may handle criminal cases against civilians in areas where ordinary courts have ceased operation, if the matter is urgent. Such courts-martial have a learned judge as a president and two military members: an officer and an NCO, warrant officer or a private soldier. The verdicts of a war-time court-martial can be appealed to a court of appeals.&lt;ref name="SOKL" /&gt;{{rp|Ch. 6}}

=== Germany ===
{{main article|German military law}}

The [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law (Grundgesetz)]] (adopted after the [[Second World War]] in 1949) establishes in Art. 96 para. 2&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iuscomp.org/gla/statutes/GG.htm#96 [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]] Art. 96, unofficial English version]&lt;/ref&gt; that courts-martial can be established by federal law. Such courts-martial would take action in a [[State of Defence (Germany)|State of Defense (Verteidigungsfall)]] and only against soldiers abroad or at sea. However, no such law has been passed to date and German soldiers are tried exclusively before civil courts.

=== India ===

There are four kinds of courts-martial in India. These are the General Court Martial (GCM), District Court Martial (DCM), Summary General Court Martial (SGCM) and Summary Court Martial (SCM). According to the Army Act, army courts can try personnel for all kinds of offenses, except for murder and rape of a civilian, which are primarily tried by a civilian court of law. Higher government authorities do not deal with the military doctrines.
The President of India can use his judicial power, (Article 72), to give either pardon, reprieve, respite or remission of punishment or sentence given by a court martial.

=== Egypt ===

The Egyptian government has been criticized for putting civilians on military trials.

===Luxembourg===

In Luxembourg, there are three levels of military jurisdiction:
* The lowest is the ''Council of War'' which is composed of one Lieutenant-Colonel (or higher), one Captain (or higher) and one civilian judge of a District Court.
* The ''Military Court of Appeal'' is composed of two high magistrates of a civilian Court of Appeal and one Major (or higher).
* At the top is the ''Military High Court'' which deals not only with military cases, but also with acts of high treason, sabotage, organized forms of terrorism and crimes against humanity. It is composed of two magistrates of a civilian Court of Appeal, one judge of a civilian District Court and one Lieutenant-Colonel (or higher) of the Army.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Majerus, L'État luxembourgeois, p 269, publ. Editpress, Luxembourg 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Netherlands ===

In the [[Netherlands]], members of the military are tried by a special military section of the civilian court in [[Arnhem]]. This section consists of a military member and two civilian judges. The decision whether or not to prosecute is primarily made by the (civilian) [[attorney general]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.rechtspraak.nl/Gerechten/Rechtbanken/Arnhem/Over+de+rechtbank/Rechtsgebieden/Strafrecht/Militair+strafrecht.htm|work=Rechtspraak.nl|title=Militair strafrecht|trans-title=Military criminal-law|publisher=Hoge Raad der Nederlanden|language=Dutch|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805055906/http://www.rechtspraak.nl/Gerechten/Rechtbanken/Arnhem/Over+de+rechtbank/Rechtsgebieden/Strafrecht/Militair+strafrecht.htm|archivedate=5 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===

The Court Martial is one of the [[Military Courts of the United Kingdom]]. The [[Armed Forces Act 2006]] establishes the Court Martial as a permanent standing court. Previously courts-martial were convened on an ''ad hoc'' basis with several traditions, including [[Swords in courts-martial|usage of swords]]. The Court Martial may try any [[Offences against military law in the United Kingdom|offence against service law]].&lt;ref&gt;Section 50&lt;/ref&gt; The Court is made up of a Judge Advocate, and between three and seven (depending on the seriousness of the offence) officers and warrant officers.&lt;ref&gt;Sections 154 to 157&lt;/ref&gt; Rulings on matters of law are made by the Judge Advocate alone, whilst decisions on the facts are made by a majority of the members of the court, not including the Judge Advocate, and decisions on sentence by a majority of the court, this time including the Judge Advocate.&lt;ref&gt;Sections 159 to 160&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
{{main article|Courts-martial in the United States}}

Most commonly, courts-martial in the United States are convened to try members of the U.S. military for violations of the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] (UCMJ), which is the U.S. military's criminal code. However, they can also be convened for other purposes, including [[Military tribunals in the United States|military tribunal]]s and the enforcement of [[martial law]] in an [[military occupation|occupied territory]]. Courts-martial are governed by the rules of [[Criminal procedure|procedure]] and [[Evidence (law)|evidence]] laid out in the [[Manual for Courts-Martial]], which contains the Rules for Courts-Martial, Military Rules of Evidence, and other guidance. There are three types: Special, Summary, and General.

== Fictional examples ==

In [[Herman Melville]]'s novella ''[[Billy Budd]]'' (first published 1924), the title character is convicted at a drumhead court-martial of striking and killing his superior officer on board HMS ''Indomitable'', is sentenced to death, and is hanged. The novella has been adapted for the stage, film and television; notably in [[Benjamin Britten]]'s 1951 opera ''[[Billy Budd (opera)|Billy Budd]]''.

In [[C. S. Forester]]'s 1938 novel ''[[Flying Colours (novel)|Flying Colours]]'', Captain [[Horatio Hornblower]] is court-martialed for the loss of HMS ''Sutherland''. He is "most honourably&lt;!--this is the correct spelling--&gt; acquitted".

{{patent law}}
'''Patents''' are [[law|legal]] instruments intended to encourage [[innovation]] by providing a limited [[monopoly]] to the [[inventor]] (or their assignee) in return for the [[disclosure of the invention]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.uspto.gov/web/menu/intro.html]" http://www.uspto.gov/web/menu/intro.html → Article 1, Section 8 of the United States Constitution&lt;/ref&gt; The underlying assumption is that innovation is encouraged because an inventor can secure exclusive rights, and therefore a higher probability of financial rewards in the market place. The publication of the [[invention]] is mandatory to get a patent. Keeping the same invention as a [[trade secret]], rather than disclose by publication, could prove valuable well beyond the time of any limited [[patent term]], but at the risk of congenial invention through third party.

== Costs, benefits, risks of the patent system to the public ==
The patent system is designed to encourage innovation. This is because patents, by conferring rights on the owner to exclude competitors from the market, presumably offer the incentive for people to study new technology.

In some fields, particularly pharmaceuticals, it is also argued that the monopoly of the patent in the market allows the owner recover the huge expenses invested in the research and development phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Werth |first=Barry |year=2013 |title=Tale of Two Drugs |journal=MIT Technology Review |volume=116 |issue=6 |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/520441/a-tale-of-two-drugs/ |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6PTSSnLam?url=http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/520441/a-tale-of-two-drugs/ |archivedate=10 May 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While patent offices in the economically advanced world have numerous procedures in effect to determine the validity and proper scope of a patent application, nevertheless some patents still issue that are not an advance on the existing state-of-the-art, or would otherwise be invalid if challenged. The system corrects these mistakes by maintaining the right to nullify inappropriately issued patents. However, only very small fraction of patent disputes ever go to court because of high litigation costs. A study in 2005 showed that among 200,000 patents that are issued every year, only 1.5 percent of patents are ever litigated, and only 0.1 percent of patents are ever litigated to trial.&lt;ref name="Lemley"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Lemley|first1=Mark A.|last2=Shapiro|first2=Carl|year=2005|title=Probabilistic Patents|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=19|issue=2|url=http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/shapiro/patents.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051118225626/http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/shapiro/patents.pdf|archivedate=18 November 2005|deadurl=no|doi=10.1257/0895330054048650|pages=75–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means the majority of patent disputes are either overlooked or settled privately. While private settlement is a cost-effective way to balance the commercial interests of two firms, the public does not benefit from it. Because of the ''private'' nature of such settlements, there is no open discussion that would clarify the scope of rights under a particular patent and the opportunity to invalidate the patent is lost. Other competitors do not benefit, and costs across the industry are not reduced.

=== Economics of probabilistic patents ===
Economists [[Mark Lemley]] and [[Carl Shapiro]] argued that the patent granting process should be rethought because there are inherent uncertainties with the system. Uncertainty in patents can be found in the two fundamental dimensions:
# uncertainty about the commercial significance of the invention being patented
# uncertainty about the validity and scope of the legal right being granted.
Modeling the patents as probabilistic rights is helpful in bringing down the social costs of the system, while continuing to encourage innovation and technology dissemination.&lt;ref name="Lemley" /&gt;

== Macroeconomic perspective ==
The patent system affects the [[economy]] as a whole. The benefits of new results, once the [[research]] is publicly known, are available to all in the relevant field, thereby bringing advantages to all parties in that field, though reducing the direct return to the party performing the pioneering research. This reduces economic incentive for a party to conduct research and innovate. {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

The effects of patents on a given market may vary widely according to the type of market, and whether there are other barriers to entry (e.g., business methods versus regulated medications).{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

Even in socialist monopole economies, the adherence to international patent laws was or becomes strict, as the effect is reciprocal for public economy, as soon as the level of technology development in these economies creates comparable advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Langinier|first=Corinne|last2=GianCarlo|first2=Moschini|chapter=Chapter 3: The Economics of Patents: An Overview|editor1-last=Newman|editor1-first=Scott|editor2-last=Rothschild|editor2-first=Max Frederick|title=Intellectual Property Rights and Patenting in Animal Breeding and Genetics|publisher=CABI Publishing|location=Oxford, England|isbn=978-0-85199-838-1|url=http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/research/webpapers/paper_2061.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040215213127/http://www.econ.iastate.edu/research/webpapers/paper_2061.pdf|archivedate=15 February 2004|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, since patents essentially encourage innovation by giving owners the right to monopolize the market for a limited time, the public will suffer from the patents that are not innovative by paying a supracompetitive cost.

Another dilemma regarding the patent system’s effectiveness is that if the validity and scope were unclear at the issuance, it will always be corrected because other competitors will cause the case to the court and then we could either reevaluate the scope through discussion or invalidate the patent for public good. However, studies of the USPTO data showed that only very few patents are litigated to trial.&lt;ref name="Lemley" /&gt;

Farrell and Merges (2004) pointed out that two reasons have kept individual firms accused of [[patent infringement]] from challenging the patent's holders. The first one is the public good problem, which means that once the patent is nullified, the competitors of the accused firm will benefit from the outcome. The other reason is that in many cases they can pass-through the uniform royalty costs in the form of higher prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Farrell|first1=Joseph|last2=Merges|first2=Robert P.|year=2004|title=Incentives to Challenge and Defend Patents: Why Litigation Won't Reliably Fix Patent Office Errors and Why Administrative Patent Review Might Help|journal=Berkeley Technology Law Journal|volume=19|issue=1|pages=943–970, page 956|url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1358&amp;context=facpubs|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140510191511/http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1358&amp;context=facpubs|archivedate=10 May 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Microeconomic perspective==
The economics surrounding a single patent, or group of patents, revolves around the balance between the expense of maintaining the patent(s), and the income derived from owning that/those patents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Kryazhimskii|first1=Arkadii|last2=Watanabe|first2=Chihiro|last3=Tou|first3=Y.|year=2002|title=Dynamic model of market of patents and equilibria in technology stocks|journal=Computers &amp; Mathematics with Applications|volume=44|issue=7|pages=979–995|citeseerx = 10.1.1.199.4968|doi=10.1016/s0898-1221(02)00208-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly the economics of whether to seek a patent present similar concerns with the added up-front costs of obtaining the patent.

The grant of a patent provides the inventor temporarily with an exclusive legal right, thereby securing a means to redeem the costs of research (by charging a higher price for its invention or by license fees from others who wish to practice it).

A patent is an exclusionary right – preventing others from entering the market – and so its effect may be to increase the patent proprietor's income from that market. The major economic effect is the exclusivity period of the patent rights, when exploitation pays back for the enterprise that funded [[research and development]]. However, patenting alone does not guarantee for marketing success.

The right to exclude others from entering market with copies is, however, potentially extremely valuable as it can mean total exclusivity in that market for the duration of the patent (generally 20 years from filing).  For example, worldwide sales of a patented [[pharmaceutical]] can be millions of dollars per day, whereas the generic equivalent would later sell for less than half the price.

Income improvement from a patent is difficult to measure. One may attempt to measure the difference in price between an "improved" product and its "unimproved" counterpart, or compare the price of the product with that in markets where (or when) it has not been patented. More directly measurable income is that which is received from the licensing or sale of patent rights, or from successful litigation of infringement.

==Innovation==
Under traditional patent doctrine, innovation is spurred by patent law in at least two ways.  (1) The inventor can secure exclusive rights, and therefore working on innovation gives the inventor a higher probability of financial rewards in the market place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rich|first=Giles S.|year=1972|title=Laying the Ghost of the ‘Invention’ Requirement|journal=American Intellectual Property Law Quarterly Journal|volume=1|issue=1|pages=26–45, page 26}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2) Publishing the invention, rather than keeping it a [[trade secret]] allows others to build upon the technology.&lt;ref name="Spulber"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Spulber|first=Daniel E.|year=2014|title=Patents are the Foundation of the Market for Inventions|publisher=[[Northwestern University School of Law]]|url=http://www.law.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/searlecenter/events/roundtable/documents/Spulber_Patents_and_the_Market_for_Inventions.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140510175410/http://www.law.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/searlecenter/events/roundtable/documents/Spulber_Patents_and_the_Market_for_Inventions.pdf|archivedate=10 May 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these have been challenged based upon economic analysis.

As early as 1986, empirical research into the effect of patent law on innovation found "its effects in this regard are very small in most of the industries we studied".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mansfield|first=Edwin|year=1986|title=Patents and innovation: an empirical study|journal=Management Science|volume=32|issue=2|pages=173–181, page 180|url=http://www4.lu.se/upload/CIRCLE/INN005/Mansfield_Patents_and_Innovation.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140510221124/http://www.utc.fr/~jollivet/GE21/Centre%20de%20Documentation%20GE21/Mansfield%20Edwin%2C%201986%20-%20Patents%20and%20Innovation%20_%20An%20Empirical%20Study%2C%20Management%20Science.pdf|archivedate=10 May 2014|deadurl=no|doi=10.1287/mnsc.32.2.173|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Boldrin and Levine concluded that "while patents can have a partial equilibrium effect of improving incentives to invent, the general equilibrium effect on innovation can be negative."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Boldrin|first1=Michele|last2=Levine|first2=David K.|year=2013|title=The Case Against Patents|journal=The Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=27|issue=1|pages=3–22, page 3|url=http://dklevine.com/archive/refs4786969000000000465.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120919204859/http://dklevine.com/archive/refs4786969000000000465.pdf|archivedate=19 September 2012|deadurl=no|doi=10.1257/jep.27.1.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other patent modeling research suggests that rather than encouraging innovation, patents can hinder development, lower [[R&amp;D]] investments, and decrease overall economic output.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Torrance|first1=Andrew W.|last2=Tomlinson|year=2009|title=Patents and the Regress of Useful Arts|journal=Columbia Science and Technology Law Review|volume=10|pages=130–168|ssrn=1411328|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140510200424/http://www.stlr.org/html/volume10/Torrance.pdf|archivedate=10 May 2014 |url=http://www.stlr.org/html/volume10/Torrance.pdf |deadurl=yes |accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Patent valuation ==
{{Main|Patent valuation}}

Patents are not intrinsically valuable, in the sense that a patent is not economically an "end in itself."&lt;ref name="Value-Guide"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Torres|first=Fernando |title=Thee Patent Value Guide: General Principles|url=http://www.patentvalueguide.com/2011/02/part-i-general-principles.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116004352/http://www.patentvalueguide.com/2011/02/part-i-general-principles.html|archivedate=16 January 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, a patent claiming an invention with market demand would likely have economic value because the patent holder can exclude others from making, importing, using, and offering for sale, or selling that invention throughout the jurisdiction (the U.S.A. for example &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=What is a patent?|publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office|url=http://www.uspto.gov/patents/index.jsp}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and sell the product at a [[monopoly price]]. Without alternative suppliers for the patented good or technology, the price the patentee is able to charge would likely be greater than the competitive price (the price in a [[competitive equilibrium]]). This portion of incremental profit would only be attributable to the patent and would therefore be the value of the patent.&lt;ref name="Value-Guide" /&gt;

Patent value, like value of other [[property]], may fluctuate over time, as markets change.&lt;ref name="Reitzig"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reitzig|first=Markus|year=2003|title=What determines patent value?-Insights from the semiconductor industry|journal=Research Policy|volume=32|issue=1|pages=13–26|doi=10.1016/S0048-7333(01)00193-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  What was once a pioneering invention may be soon outsold by an unpatented (and non-infringing) competitor catering to fringe adopters with products having features even more desirable than the invention.&lt;ref name="Reitzig" /&gt;  Contrarily, a strong patent grip could stagnate a narrow market as innovation is no longer justified, eventually resulting in reduced demand (for outmoded and over-priced products), and thus reduced patent value, as the market moves away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheremata|first=Willow A.|year=1997|title=Barriers to innovation: A monopoly, network externalities, and the speed of innovation|journal=The Antitrust Bulletin|volume=42|issue=4|pages=937–972, pages 962–963}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shapiro|first=Carl|year=1999|title=Exclusivity in Network Industries|journal=George Mason Law Review|volume=7|pages=673–683, pages 675–677|url=http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/SHAPIRO/exclusivity.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040719070110/http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/shapiro/exclusivity.pdf|archivedate=19 July 2004|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Park|first=Jae Hun|year=2010|title=Patents and Industry Standards|location=Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, England|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jFlu0d_YG2EC&amp;pg=PA147 147]|isbn=978-1-84980-011-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A particularly difficult question of value arises where inventors/owners use their patents to extract other advantages without actually marketing the invention (e.g., cross-licensing of related patents to avoid litigation, or suppressing a technology that could compete with the owner's other products).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Andersen|first1=Birgitte|last2=Rosli|first2=Ainurul Afizah|year=2009|title=Economic Strategies and Patent Governance of UK Software Firms: A Study on Financial Benefits, Reputation and Positioning|work=4th Annual Conference of the EPIP Association, Bologna, 24-25.09/2009|url=http://www.epip.eu/conferences/epip04/files/ROSLI_Ainurul.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140510212126/http://www.epip.eu/conferences/epip04/files/ROSLI_Ainurul.pdf|archivedate=10 May 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  How can one determine the value of a patented product (and the underlying patent) that has not actually been produced, let alone sold in any quantity?  Furthermore, many products incorporate numerous patented inventions (owned or licensed), and may carry exclusive trademarks, making it difficult to attribute a specific value to an individual patent.  Would the same invention be as valuable if owned and marketed under a weak brand?{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In 2005, the European Commission published a comprehensive study of the value of patents for patent owners as well as for the European economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Gambardella|first1=Alfonso|date=9 May 2005|title=Study on Evaluation the Knowledge Economy – What are Patents Actually Worth?|publisher= European Commission, Directorate-General for Internal Market |url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/indprop/docs/patent/studies/patentstudy-report_en.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070112202511/http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/indprop/docs/patent/studies/patentstudy-report_en.pdf|archivedate=12 January 2007|deadurl=no|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study was in part based on a survey of 20,000 patent owners who applied for EPO patents between 1993 and 1997.  The survey was performed in 2003.  9000 patent owners responded. The patent owners were asked how much effort was required to produce their inventions and how much monetary value their patents had been worth. The median effort to create the patentable invention was 1 person-year, with 10% of the patent owners requiring 2 or more person-years. The median value of the patents produced was €300,000, with 10% of patent owners reporting values of €10 million Euros or more.

[http://www.patentvalueguide.com/2011/03/conceptual-patent-value-framework.html ''Conceptual Patent Value Framework''], The Patent Value Guide.&lt;/ref&gt;  The key parallel is that a patent provides its owner the right to exclude others from using the underlying invention, so both patents and stock options represent a right to exploit an asset in the future, and to exclude others from using it. The patent (option) will have value to the buyer (owner) only to the extent that the expected price in the future exceeds the opportunity cost of earning just as much in a risk-less alternative. Thus patent rights can be thought of as corresponding to a [[call option]] and may be [[Option (finance)#Model implementation|valued correspondingly]].{{clarify|date=June 2012}}&lt;ref name="Pitkethly Reitzig"/&gt; See [[Business valuation#Option pricing approaches|Option pricing approaches]] under [[Business valuation]] for further discussion.

Both the Bill and Dr Villanueva's letter have been widely cited by pro-active governments and Free Software activists as a convincing rationale behind the introduction of Free Software in Governments.

{{Politics of the European Union}}

The '''European Court of Justice''' ('''ECJ'''), officially just the '''Court of Justice''' ({{lang-fr|Cour de Justice}}), is the [[supreme court]] of the [[European Union]] in matters of [[European Union law]]. As a part of the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]] it is tasked with interpreting EU law and ensuring its equal application across all [[Member state of the European Union|EU member states]].&lt;ref name="Europa info"&gt;{{cite web |title=Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |url=https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/institutions-bodies/court-justice_en|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Court was established in 1952 and is based in [[Luxembourg City|Luxembourg]]. It is composed of one judge per [[Member state of the European Union|member state]] – currently 28 – although it normally hears cases in panels of three, five or 15&lt;ref&gt;http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/Jo2_7024&lt;/ref&gt; judges. The court has been led by president [[Koen Lenaerts]] since 2015.&lt;ref name="Europa info"/&gt;

==History==
{{further |History of the European Union}}
The court was established in 1952, by the [[Treaty of Paris (1951)]] as part of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]].&lt;ref name="Europa info"/&gt; It was established with seven judges, allowing both representation of each of the six member States and being an odd number of judges in case of a tie. One judge was appointed from each member state and the seventh seat rotated between the "large Member States" (West Germany, France and Italy). It became an institution of two additional Communities in 1957 when the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC), and the [[European Atomic Energy Community]] (Euratom) were created, sharing the same courts with the European Coal and Steel Community.

The [[Maastricht Treaty]] was ratified in 1993, and created the [[European Union]]. The name of the Court did not change unlike the other institutions. The power of the Court resided in the Community pillar (the first pillar).&lt;ref name="ENA Court"&gt;{{cite web |last=Muñoz |first=Susana |title=The Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance of the European Communities |publisher=[[Centre virtuel de la connaissance sur l'Europe|CVCE]] |url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/the_court_of_justice_of_the_european_communities-en-f0601dce-60ea-4af8-a4de-de84fe6a7c26.html |accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court gained power in 1997 with the signing of the [[Amsterdam Treaty]]. Issues from the third pillar were transferred to the first pillar. Previously, these issues were settled between the member states.

Following the entrance into force of the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] on 1 December 2009, the ECJ's official name was changed from the "Court of Justice of the European Communities" to the "Court of Justice" although in English it is still most common to refer to the Court as the European Court of Justice. The [[General Court (European Union)|Court of First Instance]] was renamed as the "General Court", and the term "Court of Justice of the European Union" will officially designate the two courts, as along with its specialised tribunals, taken together.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://europa.eu/scadplus/constitution/institutions_en.htm#COURT SCADPlus: The Institutions of the Union] and article 2.3n of the [http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cmsUpload/cg00001.en07.pdf Draft Reform Treaty of 23 July 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:European Court of Justice.jpg|thumb|Twin towers of the European Court of Justice, in [[Kirchberg, Luxembourg|Kirchberg]], [[Luxembourg City|Luxembourg]].]]
The ECJ is the highest court of the European Union in matters of [[European Union law|Union law]], but not national law. It is not possible to appeal the decisions of national courts to the ECJ, but rather national courts refer questions of EU law to the ECJ.&lt;ref&gt;[https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2012-05/questionscjue_en.pdf Your questions on the Court of Justice of the European Union, p. 4]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is ultimately for the national court to apply the resulting interpretation to the facts of any given case. Although, only courts of final appeal are bound to refer a question of EU law when one is addressed. The treaties give the ECJ the power for consistent application of EU law across the EU as a whole.

The court also acts as arbiter between the EU's institutions and can annul the latter's legal rights if it acts outside its powers.&lt;ref name="Europa info"/&gt;

The judicial body is now undergoing strong growth, as witnessed by its continually rising caseload and budget. The Luxembourg courts received more than 1,300 cases when the most recent data was recorded in 2008, a record. The staff budget also hit a new high of almost €238 million in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=EU High Court Amassing Strength &amp; Reach, Art. 13 |publisher=[[Courthouse News Service]] |date=10 September 2009 |url=http://www.courthousenews.com/2009/10/09/EU_High_Court_Amassing_Strength_&amp;_Reach.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; while in 2014 €350 million was budgeted.&lt;ref name=dt9feb&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/10626146/Justice-the-EU-and-its-415m-gilded-Tower-of-Babel.html telegraph.co.uk: "Justice, the EU and its £415m gilded Tower of Babel" 9 Feb 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==

{{further|List of members of the European Court of Justice}}

===Judges===
The Court of Justice consists of 28 Judges who are assisted by 11 (as of 05/10/2016) Advocates-General. The Judges and Advocates-General are appointed by common accord of the governments of the member states&lt;ref name="T223"&gt;Article 253 (ex Article 223) of the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union.&lt;/ref&gt; and hold office for a renewable term of six years. The treaties require that they are chosen from legal experts whose independence is "beyond doubt" and who possess the qualifications required for appointment to the highest judicial offices in their respective countries or who are of recognised competence.&lt;ref name="T223"/&gt; 37% of judges had experience of judging appeals before they joined the ECJ.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2012/03/07/european-court-of-justice-enforcer/ The European Court of Justice has taken on huge new powers as ‘enforcer’ of last week’s Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance.

===President===
The President of the Court of Justice is elected from and by the judges for a renewable term of three years. The president presides over hearings and deliberations, directing both judicial business and administration (for example, the time table of the Court and Grand Chamber). He also assigns cases to the chambers for examination and appoints judge as ''rapporteurs'' (reporting judges).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Muñoz |first=Susana |title=Organisation of the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance of the European Communities |publisher=[[Centre virtuel de la connaissance sur l'Europe|CVCE]] |url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/organisation_of_the_community_jurisdictions-en-8032474d-2ac4-4764-b299-5fc0ad597538.html |accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council may also appoint assistant ''rapporteurs'' to assist the President in applications for interim measures and to assist ''rapporteurs'' in the performance of their duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Protocol on the Statute of the Court of Justice, Article 13|publisher=[[European Union]]|date=28 June 2009 |url=http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2008-09/statut_2008-09-25_17-29-58_783.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vice-President===
The post of vice-president was created by amendments to the Statute of the Court of Justice in 2012. The duty of the Vice-President is to assist the President in the performance of his duties and to take the President's place when the latter is prevented from attending or when the office of president is vacant. In 2012, judge [[Koen Lenaerts]] of Belgium became the first judge to carry out the duties of the Vice-President of the Court of Justice. Like the President of the Court of Justice, the Vice-President is elected by the members of the Court for a term of three years.&lt;ref&gt;Under Article 9a of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union: ''The Judges shall elect the President and the Vice-President of the Court of Justice from among their number for a term of three years.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advocates General===
The judges are assisted by eleven&lt;ref name ="Number of advocates general"&gt;{{cite | title = Court of Justice: Presentation | url =https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/Jo2_7024/en/#composition| quote = The Court of Justice is composed of 28 Judges and 11 Advocates General.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates General, whose number may be increased by the Council of the Court so requests. The Advocates General are responsible for presenting a legal opinion on the cases assigned to them. They can question the parties involved and then give their opinion on a legal solution to the case before the judges deliberate and deliver their judgment. The intention behind having Advocates General attached is to provide independent and impartial opinions concerning the Court's cases. Unlike the Court's judgments, the written opinions of the Advocates General are the works of a single author and are consequently generally more readable and deal with the legal issues more comprehensively than the Court, which is limited to the particular matters at hand. 

The opinions of the Advocates General are advisory and do not bind the Court, but they are nonetheless very influential and are followed in the majority of cases.&lt;ref&gt;Craig and de Búrca, page 70.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2016 study, Arrebola and Mauricio measured the influence of the Advocate General on the judgments of the Court, showing that the Court is approximately 67% more likely to deliver a particular outcome if that was the opinion of the Advocate General.&lt;ref&gt;Arrebola, Carlos and Mauricio, Ana Julia and Jiménez Portilla, Héctor, An Econometric Analysis of the Influence of the Advocate General on the Court of Justice of the European Union (January 12, 2016). Cambridge Journal of Comparative and International Law, Vol. 5, No. 1, Forthcoming; University of Cambridge Faculty of Law Research Paper No. 3/2016. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2714259&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2003, Advocates General are only required to give an opinion if the Court considers the case raises a new point of law.&lt;ref name="Europa info"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Court ECJ"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Court of Justice of the European Communities |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Court of Justice]] |url=http://www.curia.europa.eu/en/instit/presentationfr/cje.htm |accessdate=27 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Article 255 TFUE the judges and advocates-general are appointed by common accord of the governments of the Member States after consultation of a panel responsible for assessing candidates’ suitability.&lt;ref name ="Appointment of advocates general"&gt;{{cite | title = THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION | url =http://www.europarl.europa.eu/ftu/pdf/en/FTU_1.3.9.pdf | format =pdf | quote = ... The judges and advocates-general are appointed by common accord of the governments of the Member States after consultation of a panel responsible for assessing candidates’ suitability (Article 255 TFEU).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Registrar===
The [[Registrar (law)|Registrar]] is the Court's chief administrator. They manage departments under the authority of the Court's president.&lt;ref name="Court ECJ"/&gt; The Court may also appoint one or more Assistant Registrars. They help the Court, the Chambers, the President and the Judges in all their official functions. They are responsible for the Registry as well as for the receipt, transmission and custody of documents and pleadings that have been entered in a register initialled by the President. They are Guardian of the Seals and responsible for the Court's archives and publications. 

The Registrar is responsible for the administration of the Court, its financial management and its accounts. The operation of the Court is in the hands of officials and other servants who are responsible to the Registrar under the authority of the President. The Court administers its own infrastructure; this includes the Translation Directorate, which, {{as of|2012|lc=on}} employed 44.7% of the staff of the institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/Jo2_10742/direction-generale-de-la-traduction| title=Departments of the Institution: Translation | accessdate=5 January 2014 |publisher=The European Union, ECJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chambers===
The Court can sit in plenary session, as a Grand Chamber of fifteen judges (including the president and vice-president), or in chambers of three or five judges. Plenary sittings are now very rare, and the court mostly sits in chambers of three or five judges.&lt;ref&gt;As can be seen from the decline in cases pending before the full court: {{citation |url=http://curia.europa.eu/en/instit/presentationfr/rapport/stat/07_cour_stat.pdf |title=Annual Report, 2007|publisher=The Court of Justice of the European Communities |page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each chamber elects its own president who is elected for a term of three years in the case of the five-judge chambers or one year in the case of three-judge chambers.

The Court is required to sit in full court in exceptional cases provided for in the treaties. The court may also decide to sit in full, if the issues raised are considered to be of exceptional importance.&lt;ref name="Europa info"/&gt; Sitting as a Grand Chamber is more common and can happen when a Member State or a Union institution, that is a party to certain proceedings, so requests, or in particularly complex or important cases.

The court acts as a collegial body: decisions are those of the court rather than of individual judges; no minority opinions are given and indeed the existence of a majority decision rather than unanimity is never suggested.&lt;ref&gt;Craig and de Búrca, page 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jurisdiction and powers==
The idea behind European Union legislation is that each Member State shall incorporate into its own domestic law the principles laid down in the Union legislation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} It is the responsibility of the Court of Justice to ensure that the law is observed in the interpretation and application of the [[Treaties of the European Union]] and of the provisions laid down by the competent Community institutions&lt;ref name="Europa info"/&gt;{{efn|By the Treaty of Lisbon, this skill also includes respect for human rights, protected by the Charter of Nice has become part of EU law.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} For a confluence of that jurisdiction to that of the European Court of Human Rights, based in Strasbourg, see {{it}} [https://www.academia.edu/31284265/Per_libridazione_delle_Corti_europee Giampiero Buonomo, {{lang|it|Per l'ibridazione delle corti europee}}, in Diritto pubblico europeo rassegna online, febbraio 2017].{{clarify|reason=The meaning is unclear. This appears to be an external link to a document in Italian for further information, not a reference for verification. Its importance and relevance is not clear.|date=March 2018}} }} To enable it to carry out that task, the Court has broad jurisdiction to hear various types of action. The Court has competence, among other things, to rule on applications for annulment or actions for failure to act brought by a Member State or an institution, actions against Member States for failure to fulfil obligations, references for a [[preliminary ruling]] and appeals against decisions of the [[General Court (European Union)|General Court]].&lt;ref name="Europa info"/&gt;  

===Actions for failure to fulfil obligations: infringement procedure===
Under Article 258 (ex Article 226) of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]], the Court of Justice may determine whether a Member State has fulfilled its obligations under Union law. 

That action may be brought by the Commission – as is practically always the case – or by another Member State, although the cases of the latter kind remain extremely rare. As of 2012, only four interstate cases have been decided by the court: &lt;ref&gt;[http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2012-10/cp120131en.pdf Press release of the Court after the Hungary v. Slovakia judgement, note 2]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[France v. United Kingdom]] (case C-141/78), judgement of 14.10.1979 on a British unilateral fishery protection measure, infringement because UK had to consult and seek approval of commission
*[[Belgium v. Spain]] (case C-388/95), judgement of 16.05.2000 on a Spanish regulation ordering wine to be bottled in the region of production if it's using the designation of origin, no infringement because it's an authorised and justifiable restriction on the free movement of goods
*[[Spain v. UK]] (case C-145/04), judgement of 12.09.2006 on Commonwealth voting rights in Gibraltar, no infringement
*[[2009 ban of Hungarian President from Slovakia|Hungary v. Slovakia]] (case C-364/10), judgement of 16.10.2012 : Slovakia denies entry to Hungarian president, no infringement

The commencement of proceedings before the Court of Justice is preceded by a preliminary procedure conducted by the Commission, which gives the Member State the opportunity to reply to the complaints against it. The court has decided that if the European Commission does not send the formal letter to the violating member state no-one can force them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asktheeu.org/en/request/infringement_procedings_fail_to Infringement Proceedings: Fail to Act (Article 258 TFUE) -&gt; Complaints (Article 265 LT) - Overview of Requests].&lt;/ref&gt; If that procedure does not result in termination of the failure by the Member State, an action for breach of [[Law of the European Union|Union law]] may be brought before the Court of Justice. 

If the Court finds that an obligation has not been fulfilled, the Member State concerned must terminate the breach without delay. If, after new proceedings are initiated by the Commission, the Court of Justice finds that the Member State concerned has not complied with its judgment, it may, upon the request of the Commission, impose on the Member State a fixed or a periodic financial penalty.&lt;ref&gt;Repubblica italiana, Senato della Repubblica, [http://www.senato.it/service/PDF/PDFServer/BGT/00946917.pdf ''Gli oneri finanziari del contenzioso con l'Unione europea'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Actions for annulment===
By an action for annulment under Article 263 (ex Article 230) of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]], the applicant seeks the annulment of a measure (regulation, directive or decision) adopted by an institution. The Court of Justice has exclusive jurisdiction over actions brought by a Member State against the European Parliament and/or against the Council (apart from Council measures in respect of State aid, dumping and implementing powers) or brought by one Community institution against another. The [[General Court (European Union)|General Court]] has jurisdiction, at first instance, in all other actions of this type and particularly in actions brought by individuals. The Court of Justice has the power to declare measures void under Article 264 (ex Article 231) of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]].

===Actions for failure to act===
Under Article 265 (ex Article 232) of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]], the Court of Justice and the General Court may also review the legality of a failure to act on the part of a Union institution. However, such an action may be brought only after the institution has been called on to act. Where the failure to act is held to be unlawful, it is for the institution concerned to put an end to the failure by appropriate measures.

===Application for compensation based on non-contractual liability===
Under Article 268 of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]] (and with reference to Article 340), the Court of Justice hears claims for compensation based on [[tort|non-contractual liability]], and rules on the liability of the Community for damage to citizens and to undertakings caused by its institutions or servants in the performance of their duties.

===Appeals on points of law===
Under Article 256 (ex Article 225) of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]], appeals on judgments given by the General Court may be heard by the Court of Justice ''only if'' the appeal is on a point of law. If the appeal is admissible and well founded, the Court of Justice sets aside the judgment of the General Court. Where the state of the proceedings so permits, the Court may itself decide the case. Otherwise, the Court must refer the case back to the General Court, which is bound by the decision given on appeal.

===References for a preliminary ruling===
References for a [[preliminary ruling]] are specific to Union law. Whilst the Court of Justice is, by its very nature, the supreme guardian of Union legality, it is not the only judicial body empowered to apply EU law.

That task also falls to national courts, in as much as they retain jurisdiction to review the administrative implementation of Union law, for which the authorities of the Member States are essentially responsible; many provisions of the Treaties and of secondary legislation – regulations, directives and decisions – directly confer individual rights on nationals of Member States, which national courts must uphold.

National courts are thus by their nature the first guarantors of [[Union law]]. To ensure the effective and uniform application of Union legislation and to prevent divergent interpretations, national courts may, and sometimes must, turn to the Court of Justice and ask that it clarify a point concerning the interpretation of Union law, in order, for example, to ascertain whether their national legislation complies with that law. Petitions to the Court of Justice for a [[preliminary ruling]] are described in Article 267 (ex Article 234) of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]].

A reference for a preliminary ruling may also seek review of the legality of an act of Union law. The Court of Justice's reply is not merely an opinion, but takes the form of a judgment or a reasoned order. The national court to which that is addressed is bound by the interpretation given. The Court's judgment also binds other national courts before which a problem of the same nature is raised.

Although such a reference may be made only by a national court, which alone has the power to decide that it is appropriate do so, all the parties involved – that is to say, the Member States, the parties in the proceedings before national courts and, in particular, the Commission – may take part in proceedings before the Court of Justice. In this way, a number of important principles of Union law have been laid down in preliminary rulings, sometimes in answer to questions referred by national courts of first instance.

In the ECJ's 2009 report it was noted that Belgian, German and Italian judges made the most referrals for an interpretation of EU law to the ECJ{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}. However, the German Constitutional Court has rarely turned to the European Court of Justice, which is why lawyers and law professors warn about a future judicial conflict between the two courts. On February 7, 2014, the German Constitutional Court referred its first and only case to the ECJ for a ruling on a European Central Bank program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Europe or Democracy? What German Court Ruling Means for the Euro|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/german-court-calls-ecb-bond-buying-into-question-a-952556.html|website=Spiegel Online International|publisher=Spiegel Online International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The constitutional courts of the member-states have in general been reluctant to refer a question to the European Court of Justice.&lt;ref&gt;[https://static1.squarespace.com/static/56330ad3e4b0733dcc0c8495/t/574e0ca0a3360cc36343e9c5/1464732834397/GLJ_Vol_16_No_06_Claes_intro.pdf Monica Claes, "Luxembourg, Here We Come?

==Procedure and working languages==
Procedure before the ECJ is determined by its own rules of procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2010-04/rp.en.pdf |title=Rules of Procedure of the European Court of Justice |format=PDF |date=2 July 2010 |accessdate=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a rule the Court's procedure includes a written phase and an oral phase. The proceedings are conducted in one of the official languages of the European Union chosen by the applicant, although where the defendant is a member state or a national of a member state the applicant must choose an official language of that member state, unless the parties agree otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Article 29(2) of the Rules of Procedure.&lt;/ref&gt;

However the working language of the court is French and it is in this language that the judges deliberate, pleadings and written legal submissions are translated and in which the judgment is drafted.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Sharpston|first=Eleanor V. E. |title=Appendix 5: Written Evidence of Advocate General Sharpston |work=The Workload of the Court of Justice of the European Union |publisher=House of Lords European Union Committee |date=29 March 2011 |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldselect/ldeucom/128/12816.htm |accessdate=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Advocates-General, by contrast, may work and draft their opinions in any official language, as they do not take part in any deliberations. These opinions are then translated into French for the benefit of the judges and their deliberations.&lt;ref&gt;On the Linguistic Design of Multinational Courts—The French Capture, forthcoming in 14 INT’L J. CONST. L. (2016), MATHILDE COHEN&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seat==
{{further|Location of European Union institutions}}
All the EU's judicial bodies are based in [[Luxembourg City]], separate from the political institutions in [[Brussels]] and [[Strasbourg]]. The Court of Justice is based in the Palais building, currently under expansion, in the [[Kirchberg, Luxembourg|Kirchberg]] quarter of Luxembourg City.

Luxembourg City was chosen as the provisional seat of the Court on 23 July 1952 with the establishment of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]]. Its first hearing there was held on 28 November 1954 in a building known as [[Villa Vauban]], the seat until 1959 when it would move to the Côte d'Eich building and then to the Palais building in 1972.&lt;ref name="ENA Seat"&gt;{{cite web |last=Muñoz |first=Susana |title=Seat of the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance of the European Communities.|publisher=[[Centre virtuel de la connaissance sur l'Europe|CVCE]] |url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/seat_of_the_community_jurisdictions-en-487da69c-e62a-4617-b899-b696fefb6a4d.html |accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, the member states established Luxembourg City as the permanent seat of the Court. Future judicial bodies (Court of First Instance and Civil Service Tribunal) would also be based in the city. The decision was confirmed by the [[European Council]] at [[Edinburgh]] in 1992. However, there was no reference to future bodies being in Luxembourg City. In reaction to this, the Luxembourgian government issued its own declaration stating it did not surrender those provisions agreed upon in 1965. The Edinburgh decision was attached to the [[Amsterdam Treaty]]. With the [[Treaty of Nice]] Luxembourg attached a declaration stating it did not claim the seat of the ''Boards of Appeal of the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market'' – even if it were to become a judicial body.&lt;ref name="ENA Seat"/&gt;

==Landmark decisions==
Over time ECJ developed two essential rules on which the legal order rests: [[direct effect]] and [[supremacy (European Union law)|primacy]]. The court first ruled on the direct effect of primary legislation in a case that, though technical and tedious, raised a fundamental principle of Union law. In [[Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen|Van Gend en Loos (1963)]], a Dutch transport firm brought a complaint against Dutch customs for increasing the duty on a product imported from Germany. The court ruled that the Community constitutes a new legal order, the subjects of which consist of not only the [[European Union Member States|Member States]] but also their nationals. The principle of direct effect would have had little impact if Union law did not supersede national law. Without supremacy the Member States could simply ignore EU rules. In [[Costa v ENEL|Costa v ENEL (1964)]], the court ruled that member states had definitively transferred sovereign rights to the Community and Union law could not be overridden by domestic law.&lt;ref&gt;Desmond Dinan, Ever Closer Union: An Introduction to European Integration, p292-293.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early landmark case was Commission v Luxembourg &amp; Belgium (1964), the "Dairy Products" case.&lt;ref&gt;ECJ Cases 90&amp;91/63, Commission v Luxembourg &amp; Belgium, [1964] ECR 625&lt;/ref&gt; In that decision the Court comprehensively ruled out any use by the Member States of the retaliatory measures commonly permitted by general international law within the European Economic Community. That decision is often thought to be the best example of the European legal order's divergence with ordinary international law.&lt;ref&gt;JHH Weiler, 'The Transformation of Europe' (1991) 100 Yale Law Journal 2403-2483 2422 and ft 42&lt;/ref&gt; Commission v Luxembourg &amp; Belgium also has a logical connection with the nearly contemporaneous Van Gend en Loos and Costa v ENEL decisions, as arguably it is the doctrines of direct effect and supremacy that allow the European legal system to forego any use of retaliatory enforcement mechanisms by the Member States.&lt;ref&gt;W Phelan, 'The Troika: The Interlocking Roles of Commission v Luxembourg and Belgium, Van Gend en Loos and Costa v ENEL in the Creation of the European Legal Order' (2015) 21 (1) European Law Journal 116-135, Phelan, William (2016). 'Supremacy, Direct Effect, and Dairy Products in the Early History of European law.' International Journal of Constitutional Law 14: 6-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, in the 1991 [[Francovich v Italy|Francovich]] case, the ECJ established that Member States could be liable to pay compensation to individuals who suffered a loss by reason of the Member State's failure to [[transposition (law)|transpose]] an EU [[directive (European Union)|directive]] into national law.[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61990CJ0006:EN:HTML C-6/90]

==Criticism==
Some [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s and industry spokesmen have criticised the ruling against the use of gender as factor in determining premiums for insurance products. British [[Conservative Party (United Kingdom)|Conservative]] MEP [[Sajjad Karim]] remarked, "Once again we have seen how an activist European Court can over-interpret the treaty. The EU's rules on [[sex discrimination]] specifically permit discrimination in insurance if there is data to back it up".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theparliament.com/latest-news/article/newsarticle/ecj-insurance-ruling-condemned-by-meps/ ECJ insurance ruling condemned by MEPs]{{spaced ndash}} The Parliament&lt;/ref&gt;

The status and jurisdiction of the ECJ has been questioned by representatives of member states' judiciary:
* In Germany, the former president [[Roman Herzog]] warned that the ECJ was overstepping its powers, writing that "the ECJ deliberately and systematically ignores fundamental principles of the Western interpretation of law, that its decisions are based on sloppy argumentation, that it ignores the will of the legislator, or even turns it into its opposite, and invents legal principles serving as grounds for later judgments". Herzog is particularly critical in its analysis of the [[Mangold v Helm|Mangold Judgment]], which over-ruled a German law that would discriminate in favour of older workers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://euobserver.com/9/26714 Stop the European Court of Justice]{{spaced ndash}} Roman Herzog and Lüder Gerken. [[OpEd]] article in the EUobserver.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The President of the [[Constitutional Court of Belgium]], [[Marc Bossuyt]], said that both the European Court of Justice and the [[European Court of Human Rights]] were taking on more and more powers by extending their competences, creating a serious threat of a "government by judges". He stated that "they fabricate rulings in important cases with severe financial consequences for governments without understanding the national rules because they are composed out of foreign judges".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hbvl.be/nieuws/binnenland/aid1019380/bossuyt-waarschuwt-voor-regering-door-rechters.aspx |title=Bossuyt waarschuwt voor 'regering door rechters' |publisher=Hbvl.be |date=17 February 2011 |accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ECJ has also been criticised for spending too much money. As examples of overspending the critics refer to the building of the Luxembourg courthouse in 2009 that cost €500 million and the fact that the 28 judges and nine Advocates-General each have a chauffeured car.&lt;ref name=dt9feb/&gt;&lt;br&gt;

In recent years, the French daily newspaper [[Libération]] also revealed alleged practices of patronage and favoritism in the court's recruitment policy&lt;ref&gt;http://bruxelles.blogs.liberation.fr/2015/06/08/copinage-et-clientelisme-la-cour-de-justice-europeenne/&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5065">The '''''Frye'' standard''', '''''Frye'' test''', or '''general acceptance test''' is a test to determine the [[admissible evidence|admissibility]] of [[scientific evidence]]. It provides that expert opinion based on a scientific technique is admissible only where the technique is generally accepted as reliable in the relevant scientific community. In ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals]]'', 509 U.S. 579 (1993), the Supreme Court held that the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] superseded ''Frye'' as the standard for admissibility of expert evidence in federal courts.&lt;ref&gt;Arvin Maskin, Konrad Cailteux, "The Supreme Court Establishes Standard of Review for Daubert Decisions and Reaffirms District Court," March 1998, http://www.weil.com/news/pubdetail.aspx?pub=3467 LINK OUTDATED 10/7/15&lt;/ref&gt;  Some states, however, still adhere to the ''Frye'' standard.

==History==
This standard comes from ''Frye v. United States'', [http://www.law.ufl.edu/faculty/little/topic8.pdf 293 F. 1013] (D.C. Cir. 1923), a case discussing the admissibility of [[Elizabeth_Holloway_Marston#Systolic_blood-pressure_test|systolic blood pressure deception]] test as evidence.  The Court in Frye held that expert testimony must be based on scientific methods that are sufficiently established and accepted.&lt;ref name="World of Forensic Science"&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/forensic-science/frye-standard], E-notes, World of Forensic Science, Frye Standard&lt;/ref&gt; The court wrote:

{{quote|Just when a scientific principle or discovery crosses the line between the experimental and demonstrable stages is difficult to define.  Somewhere in this twilight zone the evidential force of the principle must be recognized, and while the courts will go a long way in admitting experimental testimony deduced from a well-recognized scientific principle or discovery, the thing from which the deduction is made ''must be sufficiently established to have gained general acceptance'' in the particular field in which it belongs. (Emphasis added.)}}

In many but not all jurisdictions, the ''Frye'' standard has been superseded by the [[Daubert standard|''Daubert'' standard]]. States still following ''Frye'' include: California, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington.&lt;ref name="The Status of Daubert in State Courts"&gt;[http://www.atlanticlegal.org/daubertreport.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite several intervening years during which the Daubert standard was followed, on October 15, 2018, the Florida Supreme Court confirmed the state's adherence to the Frye standard. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/decisions/2018/sc16-2182.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Effective July 1, 2014, Kansas adopted Daubert and no longer follows the Frye standard.

== Definition ==
To meet the ''Frye'' standard, scientific evidence presented to the court must be interpreted by the court as "generally accepted" by a meaningful segment of the associated scientific community.  This applies to procedures, principles or techniques that may be presented in the proceedings of a court case.

In practical application of this standard, those who were proponents of a widely disputed scientific issue had to provide a number of experts to speak to the validity of the science behind the issue in question.

Novel techniques, placed under the scrutiny of this standard forced courts to examine papers, books and judicial precedents on the subject at hand to make determinations as to the reliability and "general acceptance."

== Commentary ==
While Daubert has superseded Frye, the standard of Daubert is not substantially different.  While the focus of the inquiry has changed, the result rarely does.  Accordingly, the Daubert standard has been described as "Frye in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]]."&lt;ref&gt;See Paul Rice, Evidence: Common Law and Federal Rules of Evidence&lt;/ref&gt;

Difficulty in the application of this standard has produced questions about whether or not the standard is flexible enough to adapt to truly new and novel scientific issues, where "general" or "widespread" acceptance may not yet be garnered. On the other hand, whether new and novel allegedly scientific issues are matters of relevance to the court has been questioned.

As an alternative to this standard, the courts have generally adopted Rule 702 of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]], as the primary for expert testimony and scientific evidence.

'''''Ignorantia juris non excusat'''''&lt;ref name=BLD672&gt;[[Black's Law Dictionary]], 5th Edition, pg. 672&lt;/ref&gt; or '''''ignorantia legis neminem excusat'''''&lt;ref name=BLD673&gt;[[Black's Law Dictionary]], 5th Edition, pg. 673&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Latin]] for "[[ignorance]] of the [[law]] excuses not"&lt;ref name=BLD672/&gt; and "ignorance of law excuses no one"&lt;ref name=BLD673/&gt; respectively)  is a legal principle holding that a person who is unaware of a law may not escape [[legal liability|liability]] for violating that law merely because one was unaware of its content. 

European-law countries with a tradition of Roman law may also use an expression from [[Aristotle]] translated into Latin: '''''nemo censetur ignorare legem''''' (nobody is thought to be ignorant of the law) or '''''ignorantia iuris nocet''''' (not knowing the law is harmful).

==Explanation==
{{see also|Promulgation|Promulgation (canon law)}}
The rationale of the doctrine is that if ignorance were an excuse, a person charged with [[criminal offense]]s or a subject of a civil [[lawsuit]] would merely claim that one was unaware of the law in question to avoid liability, even if that person really does know what the law in question is. Thus, the law [[imputation (law)|imputes]] knowledge of all laws to all persons within the [[jurisdiction]] no matter how transiently. Even though it would be impossible, even for someone with substantial legal training, to be aware of every law in operation in every aspect of a [[Jurisdiction (area)|state's]] activities, this is the price paid to ensure that [[willful blindness]] cannot become the basis of [[exculpatory|exculpation]]. Thus, it is well settled that persons engaged in any undertakings outside what is common for a normal person, such as running a [[nuclear power plant]], will make themselves aware of the laws necessary to engage in that undertaking. If they do not, they cannot complain if they incur liability.

The doctrine assumes that the law in question has been properly promulgated—published and distributed, for example, by being printed in a [[government gazette]], made available over the [[internet]], or printed in volumes available for sale to the public at affordable prices. In the ancient phrase of [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]], ''Leges instituuntur cum promulgantur'' ("[[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Laws]] are instituted when they are promulgated").&lt;ref&gt;[[Gratian]], [[Decretum Gratiani|''Decretum'']], Distinctio 4, dictum post c.3&lt;/ref&gt; In order that a law obtain the binding force which is proper to a law, it must be applied to the men who have to be ruled by it. Such application is made by their being given notice by promulgation. A law can bind only when it is reasonably possible for those to whom it applies to acquire knowledge of it in order to observe it, even if actual knowledge of the law is absent for a particular individual. A secret law is no law at all.

In [[criminal law]], although ignorance may not clear a defendant of [[guilt (law)|guilt]], it can be a consideration in [[Sentence (law)|sentencing]], particularly where the law is unclear or the defendant sought advice from law enforcement or regulatory officials. For example, in one [[Canada|Canadian]] case, a person was charged with being in possession of [[gambling]] devices after they had been advised by [[customs]] officials that it was legal to import such devices into Canada.&lt;ref&gt;R v Potter (1978), 39 CCC (2d) 538, 3 CR (3d) 154 (PEISC).&lt;/ref&gt; Although the defendant was convicted, the sentence was an [[absolute discharge]].

In addition, there were, particularly in the days before [[satellite]] communication and [[cellular phones]], persons who could genuinely be ignorant of the law due to distance or isolation. For example, in a case in [[British Columbia]], a pair of hunters were [[acquitted]] of game offenses where the law was changed during the period they were in the wilderness hunting.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} In reaching this decision, the court refused to follow an early [[English law]] case in which a seaman on a [[clipper]] before the [[invention of radio]] was convicted even though the law had been changed while he was at sea (Bailey (1800) Russ &amp; Ry 1).

== In literature == 
The doctrine,"Ignorance of the law is no excuse," first shows up in the Bible in Leviticus 5:17: "If a person sins and does what is forbidden in any of the LORD's commands, even though he does not know it, he is guilty and will be held responsible."  An alternate explanation of the origin of the maxim, though not particularly relevant to the modern context, can be found in the philosophy of the Greeks and Romans. Such were cultures heavily influenced by customary legal systems. Within such a system, law is learned as a person participates in the culture and customs of the community. Thus it is unreasonable to believe a person could have avoided learning them. These rules and customs were also interwoven with ethical and religious dialogue so that laws expressed what is right and that which is not.  We find that [[Cicero]] wrote the following in ''[[De re publica]]'' (On the Republic):

"There is a true law, right reason, agreeable to nature, known to all men, constant and eternal, which calls to duty by its precepts, deters from evil by its prohibition.  This law cannot be departed from without guilt.  Nor is there one law at Rome and another at Athens, one thing now and another afterward; but the same law, unchanging and eternal, binds all races of man and all times."

[[Minos (dialogue)|Minos]] (attributed to [[Plato]]) states the following conversation between [[Socrates]] and his companion:

;Socrates
:Come then, do you consider just things to be unjust and unjust things just, or just things to be just and unjust things unjust?

;Companion
:I consider just things to be just, and unjust things unjust.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0180%3Atext%3DMinos%3Asection%3D315e Plat. Minos 315e]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Socrates
:And are they so considered among all men elsewhere as they are here?

;Companion
:Yes.
.
.
.
;Socrates
:Are things that weigh more considered heavier here, and things that weigh less lighter, or the contrary?

;Companion
:No, those that weigh more are considered heavier, and those that weigh less lighter.

;Socrates
:And is it so in Carthage also, and in Lycaea?

;Companion
:Yes.

;Socrates
:Noble things, it would seem, are everywhere considered noble&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0180%3Atext%3DMinos%3Asection%3D316a Plat. Minos 316a]&lt;/ref&gt;, and base things base; not base things noble or noble things base.

;Companion
:That is so.

==Translation==
'''Presumed knowledge of the law''' is the principle in [[jurisprudence]] that one is bound by a law even if one does not know of it. It has also been defined as the "prohibition of ignorance of the law".

The concept comes from [[Roman law]], and is expressed in the [[Brocard (law)|brocard]] ''ignorantia legis non excusat''.

The essential public character of a law requires that the law, once properly promulgated, must apply to anyone in the [[jurisdiction]] where the law applies. Thus, no one can justify his conduct on the grounds that he was not aware of the law.

Generally, a convention exists by which the laws are issued and rendered accessible by methods, authors and means that are simple and well known: the law is readable in certain places (some systems prescribe that a collection of the laws is copied in every local city council), is made by certain authorities (usually sovereign, government, parliament, and derivative bodies), and enters into effect in certain ways (many systems for instance prescribe a certain number of days - often 15 - after issue). This is commonly intended as a [[constitutional law|constitutional]] regulation, and in fact many [[constitution]]s or [[statute]]s exactly describe the correct procedures.

However, some recent interpretations weaken this concept.  Particularly in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], regard can be had to the difficulty of being informed of the existence of a law considering the lifestyle of the average citizen. On the penal side, the quality of the knowledge of the law can affect the evaluation of the [[animus nocendi]] or the [[mens rea]], in that certain subjective conditions can weaken personal responsibility.

The theme was widely discussed, also for political reasons, at the time of [[the Enlightenment]] and in the 18th century, given the heavy proportion of illiterate citizens in European countries (who would have some difficulties being aware of all the laws in a country). It was then argued that both the presumed knowledge and the heavily increasing corpus of national legislation were working in favour of lawyers rather than citizens.

In recent times, some authors have considered this concept as an extension of (or at least as analogous to) the other ancient concept (typical of [[criminal law]]) that no one can be punished under a law that was issued after the action was committed (non-retroactivity of the law. See [[ex post facto]]). This interpretation is however disputed, given that the matter would hierarchically more properly refer to a constitutional doctrine rather than to a civil or penal one.

Some modern criminal statutes contain language such as stipulating that the act must be done "knowingly and wittingly" or "with unlawful intent," or some similar language. However, this does not refer to ignorance of laws, but having [[Intention (criminal law)|criminal intent]].

==Statutory law==
This principle is also stated in [[statute]]s:

*Brazil: Decree 2848 as changed by law 7209.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/decreto-lei/Del2848compilado.htm Decree 2848 (compiled)], part of [[Brazilian Criminal Code]].&lt;/ref&gt;
*Canada: [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]], section 19&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-7.html#docCont Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-34, s 19].&lt;/ref&gt;
*Philippines: [[Civil Code of the Philippines|Republic Act No. 386 "Civil Code of the Philippines"]], Article 3&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1949/06/18/republic-act-no-386/|title=Republic Act No. 386 {{!}} GOVPH|work=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines|access-date=2018-10-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exceptions==

In some jurisdictions, there are exceptions to the general rule that ignorance of the law is not a valid defense. For example, under U.S. Federal criminal tax law, the element of ''willfulness'' required by the provisions of the [[Internal Revenue Code]] has been ruled by the courts to correspond to a "voluntary, intentional violation of a known legal duty" under which an "actual good faith belief based on a misunderstanding caused by the complexity of the tax law" is a valid legal defense. See [[Cheek v. United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Jon Strauss, "Nonpayment of Taxes: When Ignorance of the Law Is an Excuse," 25 ''Akron Law Review'' 611 (Winter/Spring 1992), at [https://uakron.edu/dotAsset/4ea43a5b-7873-49cb-afc4-c37f776fd6f2.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark C. Winings, "Ignorance Is Bliss Especially for the Tax Evader," 84 ''Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology'' 575, 582 (Northwestern Univ. School of Law, Fall 1993), at [http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6786&amp;context=jclc].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven R. Toscher, Dennis L. Perez, Charles P.

'''John Bradshaw''' (1602&amp;nbsp;– 31 October 1659) was an English judge. He is most notable for his role as [[High Court of Justice for the trial of Charles I|President of the High Court of Justice]] for the trial of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] and as the first Lord President of the [[English Council of State|Council of State]] of the [[Commonwealth of England|English Commonwealth]].

==Early life==
John Bradshaw (sometimes spelt Bradshawe) the second son of Henry Bradshaw and Catherine Winnington was born in 1602 probably at [[Wyberslegh Hall|Wybersley (Wyberslegh) Hall]] in the village of [[High Lane]] near [[Stockport]], [[Cheshire]], or possibly at the nearby Peace Farm, [[Marple, Greater Manchester|Marple]] (his father farmed at both) and baptised on 10 December in [[St Mary's Church, Stockport|Stockport Church]]. As a child he attended the free school at Stockport, as well as schools in [[Bunbury, Cheshire|Bunbury]] and [[Middleton, Greater Manchester|Middleton]].&lt;ref name="Oxf"&gt;"Bradshaw, John". ''The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. VIII, 1921. {{DNBfirst|wstitle=Bradshaw, John (1602-1659)|display=Bradshaw, John (1602–1659)}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his teenage years he also attended [[The King's School, Macclesfield]]. According to local tradition he wrote the following inscription on a gravestone at either [[Macclesfield]] or Bunbury:
	
:"My brother Henry must heir the land,
:My brother Frank must be at his command;
:Whilst I, poor Jack, will do that
:That all the world will wonder at!"&lt;ref name="Stratford"&gt;Esme W. Stratford, ''King Charles the Martyr, 1643–1649''. Westport, CT: Greenwood P, 1975, p.&amp;nbsp;318–342.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was articled as clerk to an attorney in [[Congleton]]. The White Lion public house bears a [[blue plaque]], placed by the Congleton Civic Society, which reads: "The White Lion, built 16–17th century. Said to have housed the attorney's office where John Bradshaw, regicide, served his articles."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thornber.net/cheshire/htmlfiles/congleton.html "CONGLETON" at thornber.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

After studying English law in London, he was called to the bar at [[Gray's Inn]] on 23 April 1627. He served on the provincial bar of Congleton until he became mayor in 1637.&lt;ref name="Oxf"/&gt; [[John Milton]] wrote highly of Bradshaw's aptitude during his public service, saying that "All his early life he was sedulously employed in making himself acquainted with the laws of the country; he then practiced with singular success and reputation at the bar."&lt;ref name="Sachse"&gt;William L. Sachse, "England's "Black Tribunal": an Analysis of the Regicide Court", in: ''The Journal of British Studies 12 (1973), p.&amp;nbsp;69–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 January 1638 he was married to Mary, a daughter of [[Thomas Marbury]].&lt;ref name="Westminster"/&gt;

At some time between 1640 and 1643, Bradshaw moved from Congleton to Basinghall Street in London. In 1643, he was elected judge of the London sheriff's court. He maintained the post until his death.&lt;ref name="Oxf"/&gt; Following the death of the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] in 1646, Parliament voted [[Somerhill House]] to Bradshaw.&lt;ref name=Colbran&gt;{{cite book|first=John |last=Colbran |title=Colbran's New Guide for Tunbridge Wells |publisher=A H Bailey &amp; Co |location=Cornhill, London |year=1840 |page=333 |url=http://www.theweald.org/B10.asp?BookId=colbran333&amp;v=0&amp;Xid=&amp;xnm=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed a serjeant-at-law by Parliament and in 1648 [[Justice of Chester|Chief Justice of Chester and North Wales]].

==Trial of the King==
In 1649 he was made president of [[High Court of Justice for the trial of Charles I|the parliamentary commission to try the king]]. Other lawyers of greater prominence had refused the position.

Bradshaw was a controversial choice as Lord President, and opinions of his efficiency as a judge varied. [[Bulstrode Whitelocke]] believed that he was "learned in his profession," but [[Thomas Fuller]] dismissed him as a man "of execrable memory, of whom nothing good is remembered."&lt;ref name="Sachse"/&gt; The King himself, as well as much of the court, professed to having never heard of him.

Bradshaw himself did not attend court until the third session after his appointment, apologising on the grounds that he had been out of London and disavowed his ability to perform "so important a task."&lt;ref name="Sachse"/&gt; While he served as the Lord President, he was flanked by an impressive personal guard and carried a sword at his side. He wore scarlet robes and a "broad-brimmed, bullet-proof beaver hat, which he had covered over with velvet and lined it with steel and he also wore armour underneath his robes."&lt;ref name="Sachse"/&gt; King Charles refused to recognise the authority of the court and would not plead.  After declaring Charles I guilty as a "Tyrant, Traitor, Murderer, and a public enemy," Bradshaw did not allow the king any final words. Under English law, a condemned prisoner was no longer alive and therefore did not have the right to speak, and Bradshaw followed this tradition strictly.&lt;ref name="Wedgwood"&gt;C. V. Wedgwood, ''A Coffin for King Charles''. New York: The Macmillan Co., 1964, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commonwealth and Protectorate==

On 12 March 1649 Bradshaw was elected President of the [[English Council of State|Council of State]], which was to act as the Executive of the country's government in place of the King and the Privy Council. 
From 1 August 1649, Bradshaw also held the post of [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]]. As Lord President he conducted trials of leading Royalists and condemned to death by beheading the [[James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton|Duke of Hamilton]], [[Arthur Capell, 1st Baron Capell of Hadham|Lord Capell]], the [[Henry Rich, 1st Earl of Holland|Earl of Holland]] and [[Eusebius Andrews (Royalist)|Eusebius Andrews]], for which he was well rewarded.

After wars in Scotland and Ireland the [[Long Parliament]] had still not dissolved itself or called for re-elections. On 30 April 1653, [[Oliver Cromwell]] declared Parliament and the Council dissolved and soon assumed rule as [[Lord Protector]] calling elections for a new Parliament himself. After that date Bradshaw served as commissioner of the Duchy, jointly with Thomas Fell, until mounting differences with Cromwell culminated in his resignation in 1654.

Bradshaw, an ardent Republican, became an opponent of [[the Protectorate]].  In 1654 he was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for [[Stafford (UK Parliament constituency)|Stafford]] and [[Cheshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Cheshire]] but because he refused to sign the recognition pledge put on Members to declare their recognition of the new army-backed government he took no seat for either constituency&lt;ref name=staffsph&gt;{{cite book|title=Staffordshire Parliamentary History|last=Wedgwood|first=Josiah C.|year=1920|publisher=William Salt Archaeological Society|pages=98–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1655 the Major-General in charge of Cheshire, [[Tobias Bridge]], persuaded leading gentry not to enter Bradshaw as the county's parliamentary candidate at elections to the next parliament.&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Volume 7|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=241|isbn=0-19-861357-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Oliver Cromwell died in 1658, his son [[Richard Cromwell|Richard]] succeeded him as Lord Protector and reinstated Bradshaw as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.  Bradshaw was elected MP for Cheshire in the [[Third Protectorate Parliament]] in 1659.&lt;ref name=odnb /&gt; During the same year Bradshaw moved to Westminster after falling dangerously ill with a 'quartan ague' or [[malaria]].&lt;ref name=odnb /&gt;

In October 1659, various subordinate members of the army sabotaged [[John Lambert (general)|General Lambert]]'s and [[Edmund Ludlow|General Ludlow]]'s support of the Long Parliament.  Colonel Morley, Major Grimes, and Colonel Sydenham eventually gained their points, and placed guards both by land and water, to hinder the members of Parliament from approaching the House.  During these disorders, the Council of State still assembled at the usual place and the:
{{quote|Lord President Bradshaw, who was present, though by long sickness very weak and much extenuated, yet animated by his ardent zeal and constant affection to the common cause, upon hearing [[William Sydenham|Col Syndenham's]] justifications of the proceedings of the army in again disrupting parliament, stood up and interrupted him, declaring his abhorrence of that detestable action, and telling the council, that being now going to his God, he had not patience to sit there to hear his great name so openly blasphemed; and thereupon departed to his lodgings, and withdrew himself from public employment.{{sfn|Ludlow|1894|pp=140–141}} }}
He died on 31 October 1659, aged 57. He was buried with great honours at [[Westminster Abbey]]. The eulogy was given by [[John Rowe (minister)|John Rowe]].&lt;ref name="Oxf"/&gt; On his deathbed Bradshaw said that if called upon to try the King again he would be "the first man in England to do it".

==Posthumous execution==
Charles II returned to power in 1660. On 30 January 1661 – the twelfth anniversary of the regicide – the bodies of Bradshaw, Cromwell and [[Henry Ireton]] [[Oliver Cromwell's head|were ordered to be exhumed]] and displayed in chains all day on the gallows at Tyburn. At sunset, the three bodies that had been displayed publicly as those of the three judges being executed posthumously were all beheaded.  The bodies were thrown into a common pit and the heads displayed on pikes at [[Westminster Hall]].&lt;ref name="Wedgwood"/&gt; [[Samuel Pepys]] wrote in his diary that he saw the heads there on 5 February.

==Jamaica connection==
Some sources claim that the body of Thomas Bradshaw had previously been removed by his son, James or John Bradshaw,{{sfn|Bridges|1828|p=446}}{{sfn|Urban|1784|pp=833–835}} who re-buried his father's remains on a hill near [[Martha Brae River|Martha's Brae]] on [[Jamaica]] and marked the spot with a cannon.  A location now known as "Gun Hill" is 2.5 miles south-west of the northern port city of [[Falmouth, Jamaica|Falmouth]], in [[Trelawny Parish]]. One of the three men had children who removed to [[Highland County, Virginia]].  James Bradshaw acquired the land in Jamaica where his father's remains were buried. Several sources recorded an inscription with the cannon found on Gun Hill, Jamaica, and associate the quote that ''Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God'' to John Bradshaw.&lt;ref&gt;From [[q:Rebellion#Sourced|WikiQuote for Rebellion]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

While some political philosophers have defended Bradshaw,{{sfn|Bowden|Davis|2008|pp=57–60}} most legal authorities have taken the view expressed in 1999 by [[Michael Kirby (judge)|Michael Kirby]] (then a [[Justice of the High Court of Australia]]) that the [[High Court of Justice for the trial of Charles I]] of which Bradshaw as president was illegal,&lt;ref&gt;"The trial of King Charles I was, by legal standards, a rather discreditable affair. The 'Court' had no legal authority. It was the creature of the power of the army." {{harv|Kirby|1999|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; however in his 2005 book ''The Tyrannicide Brief'' (a biography of [[John Cook (regicide)|John Cook]], the prosecutor at the trial), [[Geoffrey Robertson]] Q.C. put forward the argument that while the court was illegal due to the political settlement reached at the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration of the monarchy]] in 1660, the trial anticipated the developments in humanitarian law in the second half of the 20th century, and that the leading participants in the trial are to be admired rather than condemned.{{sfn|Robertson|2005}}{{sfn|Robertson|2008}}{{sfn|Devereux|2005}}

==Bradshaw in popular culture==
Bradshaw was played by [[Stratford Johns]] in the 1970 historical drama film ''[[Cromwell (film)|Cromwell]]''.

'''Judah ben Tabbai''' ({{Lang-he-n|יהודה בן טבאי}} ''Yehuda ben Tabbai'') was a [[Pharisee]] scholar, [[Chief Justice]] of the [[Sanhedrin]] (''[[av beit din]]''), one of "the Pairs" (''[[zugot]]'') of [[Jewish]] leaders who lived in first century BCE.&lt;ref name="JE_sbs"&gt;{{Cite Jewish Encyclopedia |title=SIMEON BEN SHEṬAḤ |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13717-simeon-ben-shetah |first= Wilhelm |last=Bacher |volume=11 |page=357}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judah ben Tabbai was associated, by some medieval writers, with what later came to be known as [[Karaite Judaism]].

== Chief Justice of the Sanhedrin ==
To escape [[Alexander Jannaeus]]'s persecution of the Pharisees, Judah ben Tabbai, who was already a prominent Pharisee scholar, fled to [[Alexandria]].&lt;ref name="JE_aj"&gt;{{Cite Jewish Encyclopedia |title=ALEXANDER JANNÆUS (Jonathan) |url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1144-alexander-jannaeus-jonathan |first=Louis |last=Ginzberg |volume=1 |page=352}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JE_a"/&gt; After Jannaeus's death in 76 BCE, [[Salome Alexandra]] became queen of [[Judea]]. The Pharisees now became not only a tolerated section of the community, but actually the ruling class. Salome Alexandra installed as [[High Priest of Israel|high priest]] her eldest son, [[Hyrcanus II]], a man who was wholly supportive of the Pharisees and the [[Sanhedrin]] was reorganized according to their wishes. This body had hitherto been, as it were, a "house of lords," the members of which belonged to the highest rabbinical court. From this time it became a "[[supreme court]]" for the administration of justice and religious matters, the guidance of which was placed in the hands of the Pharisees.

As part of the reorganization, Salome appointed her brother [[Simeon ben Shetach]] as [[Nasi (Hebrew title)|prince (''nasi'')]] of the Sanhedrin. Simeon ben Shetach wrote a flattering letter to Judah ben Tabbai, who was still in Alexandria, inviting him to return to Jerusalem to become the Chief Justice of the Sanhedrin (''av beit din'').

{{quote|text=With the help of Simon [Judah] undertook the reorganization of the [Sanhedrin], the improvement of the administration of the law, the re-establishment of neglected religious observances, the furthering of education, and generally the fashioning of such regulations as the times required. Like [[Ezra]] and [[Nehemiah]] of old, these two zealous men insisted upon a return to the strictest form of Judaism; and, if they were often obliged to employ severe and violent measures, these are not to be accounted to any personal malice, but to the sterness of the age itself. They were indeed scrupulously strict in their own conduct, and in directing those closely connected with them. From the days of Judah ben Tabbai and Simon ben Shetach, the rule of Judean Law, according to the view of the Pharisees, may be said to have began, and it grew and developed under each succeeding generation. These two celebrated men have therefore been called "Restorers of the [[Torah|Law]]", who "brought back the Crown (the [[Torah|Law]]) its ancient splendor."

== Opposition to the Sadducees ==
According to the [[Torah]], if a witness testifies falsely in court against a [[defendant]], the punishment for the [[perjury|false witness]] is the same as the pubishment would have been for the defendant had he been convicted ([[Deuteronomy]] 19:16-21). According to the Talmud ([[Makkot]] 5b), the [[Sadducees]] held that the false witness is punished only if the defendant has already been punished. However, according to the [[Pharisees]], the false witness could be punished even if the defendant was never punished.

Because Judah ben Tabbai opposed the Sadducees, in a particular [[capital case]] in which a false witness testified, he ordered that the false witness be executed even though the defendant was not punished. According to the Talmud, this was wrong, since, under Pharisaic rules, a false witness could only be punished if there were two or more false witnesses, and in this particular case, only one of the witnesses was deemed to be a false witness. Upon realizing this error, Judah spent time at the grave of the false witness that he ordered to be executed, crying and seeking forgiveness.&lt;ref name="Makkot5b"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.sefaria.org/Makkot.5b?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&amp;lang=bi |title=The William Davidson digital edition of the Koren Noé Talmud, with commentary by Rabbi Adin Even-Israel Steinsaltz |publisher=Koren Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Graetz" /&gt;

== Association with Karaism ==
According to medieval scholars,&lt;ref name="Astren"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mCdpqhKuKqEC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |title=Karaite Judaism and Historical Understanding |last=Astren |first=Fred |date=2004 |publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press |isbn=9781570035180 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Judah Halevi]],&lt;ref name="Halevi"&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/khz/index.htm |title=Kitab al Khazari |last=[[Judah Halevi|Halevi]] |first=Judah |year=1905 |translator-last=Hirschfeld |translator-first=Hartwig}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moses ben Elijah Bashyazi]],&lt;ref name="Revel"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/thekaraitehalaka01reveuoft |title=The Karaite Halakah and its relation to Sadducean, Samaritan, and Philonian Halakah : Part I |last=Revel |first=Bernard |date=1913 |publisher=Philadelphia : Cahan Prtg. Co. (prs.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Solomon Jedidiah ben Aaron]],&lt;ref name="ben Aaron"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://thekaraitepress.com/products/the-palanquin |title=The Palanquin: Appiryon ‘Asa Lo |last=ben Aaron |first=Solomon Jedidiah |publisher=The Karaite Press |year=2017 |isbn=978-0-9969657-6-7 |location=Daly City, California |translator-last=Mangoubi |translator-first=Esther}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judah ben Tabbai was the founder of [[Karaite Judaism]]. Because Alexander Jannaeus persecuted the Pharisees, and later Salome Alexandra expelled the Sadducees, once Simeon ben Shetach began restoring the Sanhedrin, there was little check on his power. As part of Simeon's reorganization of the Sanhedrin, he introduced new laws that were hitherto unknown, but which he claimed originated with [[Moses]]. These new laws came to be known as the [[Oral Torah]]. Judah ben Tabbai, on the other hand, continued to apply only the [[Torah|Written Torah]], the written law which was known since ancient times. Thus, Simeon and his followers became the founders of [[Rabbinic Judaism]], which is Judaism based on the new Oral Torah, whereas Judah and his followers, and all the Pharisees who continued to follow only the Written Torah, became the founders of [[Karaite Judaism]]. This split occurred in approximately 57 BCE.&lt;ref name="ben Aaron" /&gt;

== Students ==
Among Judah ben Tabbai's students were the next ''zugot'', namely, [[Shmaya (tanna)|Shmaya]]&lt;ref name="JE_s"&gt;{{Cite Jewish Encyclopedia |title=SHEMAIAH (SAMAIAS, SAMEAS) |url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13551-shemaiah-samaias-sameas |first= Joseph |last=Jacobs |volume=11 |page=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Abtalion]].&lt;ref name="JE_a"&gt;{{Cite Jewish Encyclopedia |title=ABTALION, POLLION, or PTOLLION |url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/645-abtalion-pollion |first=Louis |last=Ginzberg |volume=1 |page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Graetz" /&gt;

== Sayings ==
In [[Pirkei Avot]], Judah ben Tabbai is quoted as saying:
{{quote|text=Do not act as an advisor among judges.

When the litigants are before you, see them as criminals.

And when the litigants have taken their leave, see them as innocent, should they have accepted the decision.|multiline=y|source=[[Pirkei Avot]] 1:8&lt;ref name="PirkeiAvot"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Mishnah, Seder Nezikin, Tractate Avot |publisher=Wikisource|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Translation:Mishnah/Seder_Nezikin/Tractate_Avot}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''LegalShield''' (previously known as '''Pre-Paid Legal''') is an [[United States|American]] corporation that sells [[Practice of law|legal service products]] through [[multi-level marketing]] in the United States and Canada. 

The company was founded in [[Ada, Oklahoma]]&lt;ref name="Swanson"/&gt; on August 8, 1972 as the Sportsman's Motor Club. In 1976 it was incorporated as Pre-Paid Legal Services, Inc., and made its [[initial public offering]] in 1984. 

Pre-Paid Legal Services, Inc. went from being traded on the New York Stock Exchange back to a private company in 2011 when it was acquired by [[MidOcean Partners]] for $650 million and subsequently changed its name to LegalShield.

==Company description==
LegalShield develops and markets [[pre-paid legal service]] plans through a network of more than 6,900 independent provider [[Lawyer|attorneys]] across the U.S. and Canada.  The company also markets an [[identity theft]] monitoring and restoration services through its partnership with [[Kroll Inc.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kroll.com/news/releases/index.aspx?id=80 |title=Pre-Paid Legal Services to Add Identity Theft Benefits Provided by Kroll Background America |work=kroll.com |publisher=Kroll Inc|accessdate=March 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's membership plans are sold as employee benefits and directly through its [[multi-level marketing]] division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/marketplace/pre-2007/files/money/prepaidlegal/|title=Pre-paid legal services: Worth the money?|publisher=cbc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 the Wyoming Attorney General issued a press release announcing "When we discovered that Pre-Paid was using prohibited income representations to promote their multilevel marketing program, we warned them that the representations were prohibited by Wyoming law". Pre-Paid paid [[United States dollar|$]]4,000 in lieu of civil penalties, reimbursed the state for $1,000 in costs, and refunded $2,000 to participants who claimed to have been misled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20081030/ai_n30951143 |title=Shurtleff's Fundraising Trounces Hill's &amp;#124; Deseret News (Salt Lake City) Newspaper &amp;#124; Find Articles at BNET |publisher=FindArticles.com |date=October 30, 2008 |accessdate=October 23, 2009 |first=Bob, Jr. |last=Bernick |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091031144218/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20081030/ai_n30951143/ |archivedate=October 31, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://attorneygeneral.state.wy.us/CPU1PR113001.pdf |title=Newell letter |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=October 23, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021015101344/http://attorneygeneral.state.wy.us/CPU1PR113001.pdf|archivedate=2002-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year the Securities and Exchange Commission required Pre-Paid to stop counting the commissions paid out to sales associates as [[asset]]s, instead of [[expense]]s, which reduced reported earnings by over half.&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt; Pre-Paid did not file its financial statements for 2000 until February 2002.

The ''Denver Business Journal'' reported in 2002 that Pre-Paid earned a $27.1 million profit on $303.7 million in revenue, an increase from its $1.9 million profit on revenues of $129.6 million in 1997, and provided its members access to a network of 46 firms with 1,270 lawyers.&lt;ref name="Fletcher"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fletcher|first1=Amy|title=Prepaid legal is a cheaper way to get lawyer's services|journal=Denver Business Journal|date=September 15, 2002|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/stories/2002/09/16/story4.html|accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 30 lawsuits by approximately 250 plaintiffs were filed in Alabama in 2004 against Pre-Paid. All of these were dismissed or settled by 2006.&lt;ref name=Duhigg/&gt;

Pre-Paid faced two lawsuits in Mississippi in October 2004 and February 2005. A jury ruled in favor of the company in the first suit.

Pre-Paid's independent auditor was unable to approve the company's 2004 financial statements because of "material weaknesses" related to the processing of commissions.&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt; New rules proposed by the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) required Pre-Paid to disclose to potential associates that less than 25 percent of its sales representatives sold multiple insurance plans in 2005, which the company confirmed in a [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) filing.&lt;ref name=Duhigg/&gt;

In November 2006 Pre-Paid announced plans to spend $27.4 million to repurchase shares owned by executives.&lt;ref name=Duhigg/&gt;

In 2007 the FTC began investigating Pre-Paid's marketing of its identity theft service and Affirmative Defense Response System (ADRS), which the company developed to increase group sales. Pre-Paid changed its marketing materials in 2009, after regulators found the company’s claims misleading regarding ADRS.&lt;ref name="Mecoy"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mecoy|first1=Don|title=FTC ends investigation of Pre-Paid Legal|url=http://newsok.com/ftc-ends-investigation-of-pre-paid-legal/article/3479952|accessdate=March 7, 2017|work=The Oklahoman|date=July 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an SEC filing, the FTC and Pre-Paid "[reached] a mutually agreeable solution", and in 2010 the agency ended its three-year investigation without any action. Pre-Paid remained the focus of an informal SEC inquiry; the agency requested documentation about the company's stock repurchasing, consumer complaints related to provider law firms, payment card compliance, Stonecipher's resignation in April 2010,&lt;ref name=Buyout/&gt; as well as the resignation of director Tom Smith.&lt;ref name=Mecoy/&gt; 

In January 2011 Pre-Paid Legal agreed to merge with entities formed by [[MidOcean Partners]], a private equity firm headquartered in New York which it says is "focused on the middle market."  The transaction would result in the company becoming privately held.  The deal closed on June 30, 2011.&lt;ref name="TulsaWorld2"&gt;{{cite news |first=Laurie |last=Winslow |url= http://www.tulsaworld.com/business/article.aspx?subjectid=46&amp;articleid=20110201_46_E1_PrePai192609 |title=Pre-Paid to Merge with MidOcean |work=Tulsa World |date=February 1, 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Beginning in July 2011 Rip Mason served as Legal Shield’s Chief Executive Officer.

The new corporate name for the 40-year-old company was said by the company to be part of an overall re-branding initiative following the acquisition of Pre-Paid Legal Services, Inc. by MidOcean Partners.

'''''Liberty Oil Co. v. Condon National Bank''''', 260 U.S. 235 (1922),{{ref|citation}} was a decision by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] dealing with [[civil procedure]] and the nature of taking an [[appeal]] from the [[United States District Court]].  
 
==Factual and procedural background==
Liberty Oil Company, a corporation organized under the laws of Virginia contracted to purchase 160 acres, more or less, of oil lands in [[Butler County, Kansas]], for $1,150,000 from the Atlas Petroleum Company of Oklahoma, C. M. Ball, Isadore Litman, P. G. Keith, and J. H. Keith, residents of Kansas. Pursuant to the contract Liberty Oil Company deposited $100,000 in [[escrow]] with the Condon National Bank pursuant to the contract. The escrow was pursuant the term of the contract requiring that the vendors furnish an [[abstract of title]] to the property showing a [[marketable title|good and marketable title]] in them. Liberty Oil Co. has seven days to review the abstract of title and if it showed good and marketable title Liberty Oil Co. was to pay the remainder of the purchase price and receive the deeds and possession of the land. If the examination showed a good and marketable title, and the vendee should refuse to pay the money then due from it, the $100,000 was to be delivered to the vendors as liquidated damages. In the event that the examination should disclose that the title was not good and marketable, the Liberty Oil was to notify the vendors, and they were to have 30 days in which to perfect the title, and, should they neglect in that time to do so, the $100,000 on deposit was to be returned to the Liberty Oil. In either case the contract was to become null and void. Liberty Oil claims abstract showed that the title of the vendors was not good and marketable, in that in the chain of title the vendors claimed under the deed of an [[assignment for the benefit of creditors|assignee for the benefit of creditors]] filed in a [[Colorado]] court, but never authorized or confirmed by a court of competent jurisdiction under the laws of [[Kansas]], as required by the law of Kansas, that this defect was not remedied by the vendors within the time required.  On July 11, 1918, the plaintiff duly notified Condon National Bank of this and demanded payment of the money deposited. The vendors also demanded the payment of the money deposited. The bank did not pay either.

Liberty Oil brought an action at law against Condon National Bank in the [[United States District Court for the District of Kansas]] for the money deposited plus interest. The bank answered admitting the facts alleged except the character of the title.  The bank asked that be discharged from liability in a defensive [[interpleader]]  since:
# it claimed no interest in the deposit, 
# offered to pay the sum into court or to such person as the court orders  
# asked the vendors be made parties and required to set up their claim to the deposit
# asked the court make an order as to the disposition of the money, and discharged the bank it be from all liability in connection with the deposit.

The court granted the banks request and the vendors voluntarily appeared, answered, and cross petitioned for the deposits and payment of the purchase price. A [[jury trial]] was waived. The court tried the matter and found in a [[general verdict]] for the vendors, awarding them the deposit with interest.

Liberty Oil appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals]] claiming the court incorrectly decided the issue of the vendors having good and marketable title. The record of appeal was prepared as either bill of exceptions for writ of error from an action at law or a transcript for an appeal from a suit in equity. The Court of Appeals held that the case was reviewed by writ of error and since the bill of exceptions showed no special findings of fact but only a general finding in a case at law tried without a jury, it lacked power to rule as to the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the finding so sustained the verdict. Liberty Oil appealed by [[certiorari]] to the United States Supreme Court.

== Holding of United States Supreme Court ==
Court held that a defensive [[interpleader]] was an equitable defense authorized in an action at law by [[Judicial Code of 1911|Judicial Code]] § 274b added by {{usstat|38|956}}. An equitable defense should be transferred from the law side of the court to the equity side of the court under Judicial Code § 274a added by {{usstat|38|956}} and tried before the legal action and that there was no  [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|constitutional right to a jury trial]] in interpleader. These statues were a step on the way to merger of law and equity but not as fully as in the states with a code of procedures by creating one form of action.

Judicial Code § 269, as amended  {{usstat|40|1181}}, appellate courts are to give judgment after an examination of the record without regard to technical errors, defects, or exceptions which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties, and Judicial Code § 274b,  provides whether the review is sought by writ of error or appeal, the appellate court is given to render such judgment upon the record as law and justice shall require. It follows that the court should have considered the issue of law and fact upon which the decree of the district court depended whether there was a good and marketable title. The Supreme Court could have determined the issue of whether there was good and marketable title but did not because the case was not of sufficient public interest to justify that, the case was remanded to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.

==Subsequent history==

The case was determined on remand by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals at 291 F. 293 in 1923.

This is a geographical '''list of [[rock (geology)|natural stone]]''' used for decorative purposes in [[construction]] and [[monumental sculpture]] produced in various countries.

The [[dimension stone|dimension-stone]] industry classifies stone based on appearance and hardness as either "granite", "marble" or "slate".

The granite of the dimension-stone industry along with truly granitic rock also includes gneiss, gabbro, anorthosite and even some sedimentary rocks.

Natural stone is used as architectural stone (construction, flooring, cladding, counter tops, curbing, etc.) and as raw block and monument stone for the funerary trade. Natural stone is also used in custom stone engraving. The engraved stone can be either decorative or functional. Natural memorial stones are used as [[natural burial]] markers.

'''Mary J. Hayden''' was born in 1830 in [[Athens, Maine]] as Mary Jane Bean, and spent her early childhood with her grandparents in the town of [[Cornville, Maine]]. In 1845, Hayden emigrated with her parents to the wilds of [[Wisconsin]], where in 1847, she met and married [[Gay Hayden]]. In 1850, they emigrated to the [[Oregon Territory]] and settled in what is now [[Vancouver, Washington]]. In 1851 upon hearing of the [[Donation Land Claim Act]], a year after the act was passed by Congress, they settled on an island situated on the [[Columbia River]] between modern-day [[Portland, Oregon]] and Vancouver, Washington that would become known as [[Hayden Island, Portland, Oregon|Hayden Island]]. Gay Hayden proceeded to build a grand home and live on the island for five years with his wife and their twin children.&lt;ref name=access&gt;Hayden, Gay. Access Genealogy. 2010-06-13.

Hayden was a member of the [[Oregon Pioneer Association]]. She died on June 24, 1918 in [[Seattle, Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;Oregon Pioneer Association, Transactions of the 38th-50th Annual Reunion of the Oregon Pioneer Association, Volumes 38-50, Chausse-Prudhomme, Portland, Oregon, Vol. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hayden v. Zerbst==
On March 10, 1886, Hayden separated from her husband and divided their property in court, from that point on each handling their own real estate and financial affairs. Gay Hayden later sold a portion of his land to [[Terrence Furey]] in September 1901, and Furey (prior to the purchase of the lot) was informed that Hayden was the wife of the grantor but that she had no interest in the lot. Furey then resold the land on March 8, 1906 to [[Reinhold Zerbst]], but Hayden did not join in this conveyance. Furey sold and conveyed the lot to Zerbst, who at said time did not know that Gay Hayden was a married man. Gay Hayden had died almost four years previously intestate in [[Clark County, Washington|Clarke County]] in May 1902 and his estate was probated in that county.&lt;ref name = pacific&gt;The Pacific reporter, Volume 94, West Publishing Co., St. Paul, p. 909-911&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Portland and Seattle Railway]] had Zerbst's land condemned in 1903 and he was subsequently reimbursed $1200 for the land. Hayden had made no claim to this lot until the sale to Zerbst was begun upon which she appealed to the [[Supreme Court of Washington]] in 1908 for her half of the proceeds from said land sale and resulted in the case of Hayden v. Zerbst. In the end, the court found in favor of Zerbst as Hayden had not taken any action for 14 years after the sale of the land by her late husband.&lt;ref name = pacific/&gt;

'''Moldovan nationality law''' dates back to June 2, 2000 and has been amended several times, with the latest modifications being made in 2014. It is based on the [[Constitution of Moldova]] (articles 17, 18 and 19). It is mainly based on [[Jus sanguinis]].

Dual nationality is allowed, under certain conditions.

Under the law, there are provisions for citizenship to be acquired by:
* Birth
* Recognition
* Adoption
* Recover
* Naturalisation

== Citizenship by birth ==

You acquire citizenship by birth, if you fulfil any of the following requirements.
# Either of your parents is a citizen of Moldova at the time of your birth
# You are born on the territory of Moldova, and your parents are stateless persons
# You are born on the territory of Moldova, and cannot receive the citizenship of either of your parents
# Any foundling found on the territory of Moldova is considered a citizen unless proven otherwise, until the age of 18

== Citizenship by naturalisation ==
Citizenship may be granted to anyone who has reached the age of 18, and who meets one of the following criteria:
# Has resided in Moldova lawfully and habitually for the last ten years; has been married to a citizen of Moldova for at least three years; or has resided lawfully and habitually for three years with parents or children (including adoptive) who are citizens of Moldova
# Has resided lawfully and habitually for five years before reaching the age of 18
# Is a stateless citizen or recognised refugee, who has been lawfully and habitually for at least 8 years
In addition they must fulfil the following criteria:
# Knows and observes the provisions of the Moldovan constitution
# Knows the national language, sufficiently well to integrate into social life
# Loses or renounces the citizenship of another state, if possessed, except in the cases when the loss of the renunciation is not possible or cannot reasonably be requested

==Dual citizenship==
Moldova allows its citizens to hold foreign citizenship in addition to their Moldovan citizenship. Some countries, however, do not permit multiple citizenship e.g. adults who acquired Moldovan and [[Japanese citizenship]] by birth must declare, to the latter's [[Ministry of Justice (Japan)|Ministry of Justice]], before turning 22, which citizenship they want to keep.

== Controversy ==
On 28 September 2017, a new law has passed by the government allowing individuals to buy their citizenship for a fixed sum. Moldovan pro-Russian president [[Igor Dodon]] tried to bring in investments from Russia stating that "The Moldovan passport could allow them to travel in Europe freely."&lt;ref name="Balkan Insight News report"&gt;{{cite web|title=Moldova Offers Passports to Cash-Rich Foreigners|publisher=Balkan Insight|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/moldova-to-grant-citizenship-to-foreign-investors-09-28-2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Venezuela}}
The '''National Electoral Council''' ({{lang-es|Consejo Nacional Electoral}}) (CNE) is one of the five branches of government of the [[Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela]] that is designed to be independent. It is the institution that has the responsibility of overseeing and guaranteeing the transparency of all elections and referendums in [[Venezuela]] at the local, regional, and national levels. The creation of the CNE was ratified by citizens in [[Venezuelan constitutional referendum, December 1999|Venezuela's 1999 constitutional referendum]].

The National Electoral Council (CNE) is composed of five persons; three of them nominated by civil society, one by the faculties of law and political science at national universities, and one by the Citizen Power. The three members nominated by civil society shall have six alternates in ordinal sequence, and each appointed by the universities and the Citizen Power has two alternates, respectively. Members of the National Electoral Council last seven years in office and be elected separately: the three nominated by civil society at the beginning of each period of the National Assembly, and the other two in the middle of it. Members of the National Electoral Council shall be appointed by the National Assembly with the vote of two thirds of its members. Members of the National Electoral Council will designate from among its members its President, in accordance with the law. (Article 296 Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela).

At present, the CNE officials are: [[Tibisay Lucena Ramírez|Tibisay Lucena]] (CNE President, President of the National Electoral Commission), [[Sandra Oblitas Ruzza]] (Vice President, President of the Civil and Electoral Registry Commission), [[Vicente José Gregorio Díaz Silva]] (President of the Political Participation and Finance Commission), [[Socorro Elizabeth Hernández Hernández]] (Member of the National Electoral Commission) and [[Tania D' Amelio Cardiet]] (Member of the Civil and Electoral Registry Commission). The CNE also has a general secretary, Xavier Antonio Moreno Reyes, and a juridical consultant, Roberto Ignacio Mirabal Acosta.

==History==
The CNE was preceded by the Supreme Electoral Council, which was established under an electoral law on September 11, 1936.&lt;ref name=1936law&gt;{{cite web |title=Ley de censo electoral y de elecciones, de 11 de septiembre de 1936 |url=http://www.cne.gob.ve/web/documentos/la_institucion/antecedentes/1936.pdf |year=1936 |accessdate=September 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This entity was replaced by the CNE in 1997 with the passage of a new Organic Law of Suffrage and Participation.&lt;ref name=LeyOrgSuf&gt;{{cite web |title=Ley Orgánica del Sufragio y Participación Política |url=http://www.derechos.org.ve/pw/wp-content/uploads/LeyOrgSufraPartPol.pdf |accessdate=September 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
The electoral system of Venezuela is a controversial. It has been alleged that the Supreme Tribunal of Justice, with the majority supporting Chávez, elected officials to the supposedly non-partisan National Electoral Council of Venezuela (CNE) despite the 1999 Constitution stating for the [[National Assembly of Venezuela]] to perform the task.&lt;ref name=HAWK&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hawkins|first1=Kirk A.|title=Venezuela's Chavismo and populism in comparative perspective|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780521765039|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; That resulted with the CNE board having a majority consisting of Chavistas or those that supported Chávez.&lt;ref name=HAWK/&gt; Since then, the Venezuelan government controlled by the PSUV ruling party has manipulated elections, holding control of the CNE, the media and through government spending.&lt;ref name=FPsave&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cárdenas|first1=José|title=Now Is the Time to Save Venezuela’s Elections|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/08/04/now-is-the-time-to-save-venezuelas-elections/|accessdate=6 August 2015|agency=''[[Foreign Policy]]''|date=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the election of [[Nicolás Maduro]] – Chávez's handpicked successor – into the presidency, the CNE has been described as being pro-Maduro.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/oct/15/venezuela-maduro-ruling-party-wins-majority-23-gov/|title=Venezuela: Maduro ruling party wins majority of 23 governors’ offices|last=|first=|date=|work=[[The Washington Times]]|access-date=2018-05-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.voanews.com/a/venezuelan-opposition-coalition-condemns-falcon-presidential-bid/4274331.html|title=Venezuelan Opposition Coalition Condemns Falcon Presidential Bid|last=|first=|date=|work=[[Voice of America]]|access-date=2018-05-17|agency=[[Reuters]]|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.elmundo.es/internacional/2017/10/19/59e8ebf9ca474187108b45c0.html|title=Venezuela: "Fraude numérico" en Bolívar y más de 200.000 votos descontados en Miranda|last=|first=|date=|work=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]|access-date=2018-05-17|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.infobae.com/america/eeuu/2017/07/19/luis-almagro-ante-el-senado-de-los-eeuu-venezuela-es-el-pais-mas-corrupto-del-continente-toda-la-estructura-del-estado-esta-tomada-por-el-narcotrafico/|title=Luis Almagro, ante el Senado de los EEUU: "Venezuela es el país más corrupto del continente, toda la estructura del Estado está tomada por el narcotráfico"|last=|first=|date=|work=[[Infobae]]|access-date=2018-05-17|language=es-LA}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to the [[United States Department of State]], there is "widespread pre- and post-election fraud, including electoral irregularities, government interference, and manipulation of voters" and "opposition political parties [have] operated in a restrictive atmosphere characterized by intimidation, the threat of prosecution or administrative sanction on questionable charges, and restricted media access".&lt;ref name="FPsave" /&gt; International observers have had difficulties monitoring the elections, though the Bolivarian government accepts the praise of their elections from UNASUR allies.&lt;ref name="FPsave" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5395">'''Universal National Service Act of 2006''', sponsored by Rep. [[Charles Rangel]], was introduced into the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] on February 14, 2006.  On February 23, 2006, it was referred to the House [[United States House Armed Services Subcommittee on Military Personnel|Subcommittee on Military Personnel]].  The bill was never enacted.

==Public debate==
Rep. Rangel argued that the bill was necessary since in the case of a mandatory draft members of the U.S. Congress would be much less likely to authorize an unnecessary war if they knew that their own children and family members might be sent to fight it. He was quoted as saying: "There’s no question in my mind that this president and this administration would never have invaded Iraq, especially on the flimsy evidence that was presented to the Congress if indeed we had a draft and members of Congress and the administration thought that their kids from their communities would be placed in harm’s way".&lt;ref&gt;Tom Zeller Jr. [http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/tag/iraq/2006/11/20/ To Rangel With the Draft.] ''[[New York Times]]'', November 20, 2006. Accessed May 13, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Rangel also argued that bringing back the draft would remedy the social disparity of the burden of military service falling disproportionately on the poor and the minorities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.house.gov/apps/list/press/ny15_rangel/CBRStatementonDraft02142006.html RANGEL REINTRODUCES DRAFT BILL.] Congressional Press Release.

Quote: "I dare anyone to try to convince me that this war is not being fought predominantly by tough, loyal, and patriotic young men and women from the barren hills and towns of rural and underprivileged neighborhoods in urban America where unemployment is high  and opportunities are few.  As we see who are the troops coming home wounded and killed, I challenge anyone to tell me that the wealthiest have not been excluded from that roll call."&lt;/ref&gt; After the Democratic victories in the November 2007 congressional elections, Rangel repeated his call for re-introduction of the draft and for moving forward on the bill,&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/19/AR2006111900376_pf.html Rep.

[[File:Leyes Nuevas1.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Cover of "Leyes Nuevas" of 1542.]]
The '''New Laws''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: '''''Leyes Nuevas'''''), also known as the '''New [[Laws of the Indies]] for the Good Treatment and Preservation of the Indians''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]:'''''Leyes y ordenanzas nuevamente hechas por su Majestad para la gobernación de las Indias y buen tratamiento y conservación de los Indios'''''), were issued on November 20, 1542, by King [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] of the Holy Roman Empire (Charles I of Spain) and regard the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]. Following complaints and calls for reform from individuals such as the Dominican friar [[Bartolomé de Las Casas]], these laws were intended to prevent the exploitation and mistreatment of the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] by the ''[[Encomienda|encomenderos]]'', by strictly limiting their power and dominion over groups of natives.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joaquín García Icazbalceta|García Icazbalceta, Joaquín]] ''"Colección de documentos para la historia de México"'' "Leyes y ordenanzas" (Dada en la ciudad de Barcelona, a veinte días del mes de Noviembre, año del nacimiento de nuestro Salvador Jesucristo de mill e quinientos e cuarenta y dos años) y addenda 4 de junio de 1543; 26 de junio de 1543; 26 de mayo de 1544 [http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/06922752100647273089079/p0000026.htm text on Internet] Cervantes Virtual&lt;/ref&gt; The text of the New Laws has been translated to English.&lt;ref&gt;Spain. ''The New Laws of the Indies for the Good Treatment and Preservation of the Indians''. New York: AMS Press, 1971. {{ISBN|0-404-06159-1}} Facsimile edition of a London, Chiswick Press, 1893 edition by Henry Stevens and Fred W. Lucas.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Blasco Núñez Vela]], the first [[List of viceroys of Peru|Viceroy of Peru]], enforced the New Laws. He was opposed by a revolt of some ''encomenderos'' and was killed in 1546 by the landowning faction led by [[Gonzalo Pizarro]]. He wanted to maintain a political structure based on the Incan model the Spanish found in place. Although the New Laws were only partly successful, due to the opposition of some colonists, they did result in the liberation of thousands of indigenous workers, who had been held in a state of semi-slavery.

==Origins==
The New Laws were the results of a reform movement in reaction to what were considered to be the less effective, decades-old ''[[Leyes de Burgos]]'' (Laws of Burgos), issued by King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] on December 27, 1512. These laws were the first intended to regulate relations between the Spaniards and the recently conquered indigenous peoples of the New World. These are regarded as the first [[humanitarian]] laws in the New World. They were not fully implemented because of opposition by some powerful colonists. While some encomenderos opposed the restrictions imposed by the laws as against their interests, others were opposed because they believed the laws institutionalized the system of forced Indian labor. During the reign of King Charles I, the reformers gained strength. A number of Spanish missionaries argued for stricter rules, including [[Bartolomé de las Casas]] and [[Francisco de Vitoria]]. Their goal was to protect the Indians against forced labor and expropriation, and to preserve their cultures. Some discussions challenged the very legitimacy of the conquest and colonization. 
Eventually, the reformists influenced the King and his court to pass reforms that came to be known as the '''New Laws'''.

===Main points===
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Governors had an obligation to take care of the well-being and preserve the Native Americans (referred to as ''indians'' by the law).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That there was no motive to enslave them in the future, not by war, nor due to rebellion, nor to ask for a rescue, nor for any reason or in any way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That native Americans currently enslaved must be freed immediately, unless the owner could prove (in Spain, which implied travelling back there) the full juridical legitimacy of such a state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That the 'bad habit' of making Native Americans work as ''tamames'' against their will or without fair payment must be ended immediately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That they must not be taken to remote regions to fish for pearls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That only the viceroy had the right to establish encomiendas on Native Americans. The prohibition to establish encomiendas included all Religious orders, hospitals, commonalities and civil servants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That the "distribution"(of people and lands) given to the original conquerors (as a feudal lordship of sorts) should stop immediately after their death, and both land and the native people would become subject to the Crown.&lt;ref&gt; Suárez Romero. LA SITUACIÓN JURÍDICA DEL INDIO DURANTE LA CONQUISTA ESPAÑOLA EN AMÉRICA. REVISTA DE LA FACULTAD DE DERECHO DE MÉXICO TOMO LXVIII, Núm. 270 (Enero-Abril 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

===Causes and goals===
Some of these laws were redundant. Some established extra protections and rights for Native Americans that native Spaniards did not have themselves. Given the distance from the colonies and the time needed to travel between there and Spain, the Crown was unable to fully monitor compliance with the more ambiguous laws. For instance, slavery was made legal as punishment for certain crimes. 

The main examples are the cases of slavery and encomiendas. 
The new laws included the  prohibition of enslavement of the Indians and provided for gradual abolition of the encomienda system in America by forbidding it to be inherited by descendants. The New Laws stated that the natives would be considered free persons, and the ''encomenderos'' could no longer demand their labour. 

The prohibition against enslaving Indians  "in any case, not even crime or war" was a right that did not apply to  native Castilians themselves. The enslavement of Native Americans had been declared illegal in Castile in 1501, when [[ Isabella I of Castile|Isabella I]] declared native Americans to be both people and subjects of the Castilian crown, and so subject to the same rights and obligations as any other subject of the queen. Under those regulations, slavery was permitted almost exclusively as a penalty for a serious crime or some exceptional circumstances. Granting extra protection for Native Americans was an attempt by the crown to address its inability to monitor, from Spain, the legitimacy of the claims regarding reasons to enslave a person in the New World, and it acknowledged that false claims could be fabricated to enslave and exploit the native peoples. 

The introduction and corruption of the [[encomienda]] system is now considered to have been an alternative for outright slavery and a Castilian institution that did not work properly in America. The encomienda was a system that interchanged a person's work for military protection by a higher authority. It had been part of the Castilian legal system since the Reconquista. Given the limited size of the Crown's army, this system allowed nobles or warlords to trade protection for the labor of persons under their purview. It was a way to aid in   ensuring the safety of the population of the border areas during the repopulation of the no-mans-land between Castile and the southern Muslim areas. It either required either the consent of both parts or the direct intervention of the king, who was responsible for setting reasonable conditions for the parties and to intervene (militarily if required) in case of abuses.&lt;ref&gt;Alberto Pérez Amador Adam: "De legitimatione imperii Indiae Occidentalis. La vindicación de la Empresa Americana en el discurso jurídico y teológico de las letras de los Siglos de Oro en España y los virreinatos americanos." Madrid / Frankfurt: Iberoamericana / Vervuert 201&lt;/ref&gt;

in America, however, colonists used encomiendas  to create conditions similar to slavery in areas that did not require such protection. Authorities other than the king claimed the right to assign encomiendas and assigned the most unpleasant or dangerous jobs to the Natives. 

The New Laws established more specific regulations or stipulated the conditions under the Crown's authority: 
*The natives were required only to pay tribute to the ''encomenderos''; if they worked, they were to be paid wages in exchange for their labor.  tribute, and, if they worked, they would be paid wages in exchange for their labor. *The laws prohibited using indigenous people to work in the mines (where many had died) unless it was absolutely necessary, and then under the same working conditions as Spanish mine workers. 
*Indians were to be taxed fairly and treated well. 
*Public officials or clergy with ''encomienda'' grants were ordered to return them immediately to the Crown. 
*Encomienda grants would not be passed on via inheritance, but would be cancelled at the death of the individual ''encomendero''.

==Effect of the New Laws==
The King promulgated the ''New Laws'' in 1542. In addition to regulating encomienda and treatment of Indians, they reorganized the overseas colonial administration. Several General Captainships were established, such as the Kingdom of Guatemala, to create another level of Crown authority in the colony. 

===Resistance in Peru===

When the New Laws were passed, every European man holding an encomienda in Peru learned that this grant of labor could be confiscated if he was guilty of having taken part in the civil disturbances of [[Francisco Pizarro]] and Almagro. &lt;!-- Not mentioned before - what was this about? --&gt;As a result, privileged Spanish colonists were disturbed about implementing the New Laws. In Peru Gonzalo Pizarro led a revolt of protesting encomenderos; they took to arms to "maintain their rights by force" for control of Indian lands and labor.

The Supreme Court of Peru invited Pizarro to take control of the government after his forces reached Lima from Bolivia. Pizarro took over [[Lima]] and [[Quito]] (now in Ecuador). Viceroy Blasco Núñez Vela, who had attempted to impose the decrees, was overthrown. Pizarro and his army killed Núñez Vela in 1546. Pizarro's power stretched from Peru north to Panama. Charles I and the court became alarmed, and were convinced that the immediate abolition of the ''encomienda'' system would bring economic ruin to the colonies. To deal with the revolt, Charles I sent [[Pedro de la Gasca]] to the colony; a bishop and diplomat, he did not command an army but was given full powers to rule and negotiate a settlement with Pizarro and his followers. However, Pizarro declared Peru as independent from the King. La Gasca provisionally suspended the New Laws. Pizarro was later captured and executed, accused of being a "traitor to the King."

== Level of compliance ==
Although in [[New Spain]] (now [[Mexico]]), the initial reaction of encomenderos was noncompliance, they did not organize a rebellion as in Peru. New Spain's first viceroy, Don [[Antonio de Mendoza]], prudently refrained from enforcing the parts of the New Laws most objectionable to the ''encomenderos'', and avoided rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Mark A. Burkholder, "New Laws of 1542" in ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'', vol. 4, p. 177. New York: Charles Scribner's and Sons, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;  Over time, the encomenderos complied with most aspects of the laws.  Most already maintained a horse and arms in case of Indian rebellion, and had established a residence in a Spanish settlement. They hired priests to minister to the Indians whose labor was granted to them.  While they were not allowed to retain their encomiendas in perpetuity, they were permitted to bequeath the properties and labor once. They allowed Indians to fulfill obligations by payment of tribute, often in produce. The dramatic declines in Indian population due to epidemic disease, however, resulted in economic losses for the encomenderos. &lt;ref&gt;[[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]] and [[Stuart B. Schwartz]], ''Early Latin America''. New York: Cambridge University Press 1983, pp. 94-95.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In 1545, the Crown revoked the rule stating that the ''encomienda'' properties could not be inherited. By strengthening the power of the encomenderos, the encomienda system was made secure. While the New Laws were  partly successful, they did result in the liberation of thousands of indigenous workers from enforced servitude.

Most of the ordinances of the New Laws were later incorporated into the general corpus of the [[Laws of the Indies]]. In some cases they were superseded by newer laws. A weaker &lt;!-- In what way? --&gt;version of the New Laws was issued in 1552.

The Environmental Control Board (ECB) is composed of thirteen members: the chairperson is the OATH Chief Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), six are commissioners of city agencies, six are citizens who are experts in the fields of water pollution control, business, real estate and noise but includes two general citizen representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Environmental Control Board|publisher=[[Center for New York City Law]]|url=http://archive.citylaw.org/ecb/|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the ECB is empowered to impose penalties under the New York City Charter and has promulgated penalty schedules, the ECB is in the process of repealing all penalty schedules in its rules so that they can be relocated to the rules of the enforcement agencies with primary rulemaking and policymaking jurisdiction with the expertise to adopt appropriate penalties to address violations, and help clarify to the public that OATH ECB is a neutral third party that hears and tries cases brought by other City agencies and is not an enforcement agency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rules.cityofnewyork.us/content/oath-ecb-proposed-repeal-noise-code-penalty-schedule OATH ECB Proposed Repeal of the Noise Code Penalty Schedule]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rules.cityofnewyork.us/content/oath-ecb-proposed-repeal-parks-penalty-schedule OATH ECB Proposed Repeal of Parks' Penalty Schedule]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although undoubtedly a descendant of Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia]], his claimed titles and official membership in the former Imperial House were disputed by those who maintained that his parents' marriage violated the laws of Imperial Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Massie, ch. 19: "The Romanov Emigres," esp. pp. 264–265 (Russian Law of Succession) and pp. 274–275.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and childhood==

Prince Nicholas was born in [[Cap d'Antibes]] near [[Antibes]], France, the eldest son of [[Prince Roman Petrovich of Russia|Prince Roman Petrovich]] and his wife Princess Praskovia Dmitrievna (née Countess [[Sheremetev]]a). Prince Nicholas had a younger brother, [[Prince Dimitri Romanov]]ich. Their father Prince Roman Petrovich was the only son of [[Grand Duke Peter Nicolaievich of Russia|Grand Duke Peter Nicolaievich]] and [[Princess Milica of Montenegro|Grand Duchess Militsa Nikolaievna]] (née Princess of Montenegro). His grandfather was the younger son of [[Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia (1831–1891)|Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich]] and [[Grand Duchess Alexandra Petrovna of Russia|Grand Duchess Alexandra Petrovna]] (née Duchess of Oldenburg). His great grandfather Nicholas Nikolaevich was a younger son of Emperor [[Nicholas I of Russia]] and Empress [[Alexandra Fyodorovna (Charlotte of Prussia)|Alexandra Fyodorovna]] (née Princess Charlotte of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]) and founded the [[Branches of the Russian Imperial Family#Nikolaevichi|Nikolaevichi branch]] of the Russian Imperial Family.

Prince Nicholas was brought up in Cap d'Antibes with his family still using the [[Julian calendar]] and he spoke both fluent Russian and French from his childhood on.&lt;ref name=one/&gt; He was brought up in a Russian environment with his local church having a Russian priest and his family employing Russian staff and a Russian nanny.&lt;ref name=gstaad&gt;{{cite news |first=Anne |last=Pfeiffer-Brechbühl |title=Nikolai Romanov Prince of Russia: an eventful life |url=http://www.gstaadlife.ch/archive/documents/gl05_03.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=[[Gstaad]] Life |pages=6, 7 |date=21 January 2005 |accessdate=22 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and naval aspirations==
Prince Nicholas received a private education in France with his studies following the old Russian [[school curriculum]]. In 1936 his family moved to Italy due to the standard of schooling supposedly being better there.&lt;ref name="gstaad"/&gt; He aspired to be a [[naval officer]] and had convinced his parents by the age of 12 that this was his dream. However, as he was a Romanov and there was a [[Soviet Navy]] and not an [[Imperial Russian Navy]], he decided to work towards a career in the [[Italian Navy]]. Using his family's close relationship to the [[House of Savoy|Italian Royal Family]] (both his grandmother Militsa and [[Elena of Montenegro|Queen Helena]] of Italy, wife of King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel III]], were daughters of King [[Nicholas I of Montenegro]]) he began to study in Italy under the tutelage of a retired Italian Naval officer with the aim of attending the [[Accademia Navale di Livorno|Naval Academy]] of [[Livorno]].  However, Nicholas's hopes of a Naval career evaporated when he showed signs of [[near-sightedness]].&lt;ref name=one/&gt;

He completed his education in Italy graduating from a [[Liceo classico]] in 1942.

==World War II and post war==
During [[World War II]], Prince Nicholas and his family lived at the residence of [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy]]. When the King left Rome, Nicholas and his family went into hiding for nine months. During the occupation of Rome by Germany, Nicholas's grandmother, who was at great risk of deportation as a sister of the Queen, had to take shelter in the [[Holy See]].&lt;ref name=one/&gt; In 1942, the ruling [[Fascist]]s in Italy approached Prince Nicholas to offer him the throne of [[Kingdom of Montenegro (1941–1944)|Montenegro]]. He declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/russian/news/newsid_5006000/5006776.stm |script-title=ru:Романов: "Мне предлагали Черногорию – я отказался" |accessdate=27 July 2008 |date=22 May 2006 |publisher=BBC |language=Russian }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russkiymir.ru/russkiymir/en/news/common/news7896.html|title=Nicholas Romanovich – the Eldest of the Romanov Dynasty – Turns 90|date=26 September 2012|accessdate=20 October 2012|publisher=Russkiy Mir Foundation Information Service|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121118125604/http://www.russkiymir.ru/russkiymir/en/news/common/news7896.html|archivedate=18 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prince Nicholas wanted to study engineering at the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]] but the war prevented this, so following its conclusion, he found employment by working as a civilian for the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in the [[Psychological Warfare Division]] and the [[United States Information Service]]. On the advice of [[Umberto II of Italy|King Umberto II]] Prince Nicholas and his family left Italy for [[Egypt]] in 1946.&lt;ref name=FT/&gt; While living in Egypt he was involved in the purchasing and sale of [[Turkish tobacco]] as well as finding work in an [[Insurance]] company.

Returning to Europe in 1950 Prince Nicholas worked in Rome for the [[Austin Motor Company]] until 1954. Following the death of his brother-in-law he took over the management of his wife's property and business in Tuscany. The business was a large farm which he managed for 25 years from 1955 to 1980 where he bred [[Chianina]] cattle and produced [[wine]].&lt;ref name=gstaad/&gt; He sold the farm in 1982 and moved to [[Rougemont, Switzerland]].&lt;ref name=one/&gt; A [[refugee]] from birth, Prince Nicholas was a [[stateless person]] and used to travel abroad on a letter issued by the King of Greece. He finally became a citizen of Italy in 1988.&lt;ref name=FT&gt;{{cite news |first=John-Paul |last=Flintoff |title=Lunch with the FT: Nicholas Romanov |url=http://search.ft.com/nonFtArticle?id=030919002239 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928072555/http://search.ft.com/nonFtArticle?id=030919002239 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=28 September 2008 |publisher=[[Financial Times]] |date=19 September 2003 |accessdate=22 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prince Nicholas visited Russia for the first time in June 1992 when he acted as a second [[tour guide]] for a group of businessmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Russian royal exiles return to St Petersburg |url=http://old.orthodoxnews.org/Nicholas%20Romanov%20is%20passionate.htm |publisher=[[Swissinfo]] |date=28 May 2003 |accessdate=26 July 2008 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He often appeared in the media to talk about the Romanovs, giving over 100 television interviews,&lt;ref name=one/&gt; and appearing in television documentaries such as the 2003 Danish documentary ''"En Kongelig familie"'' and the 2007 [[France 3]] produced documentary called ''"Un nom en héritage, les Romanov"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://programmes.france3.fr/documentaires/index-fr.php?page=documentaires-archives-articles-detailles2&amp;id_rubrique=42 |title=Un nom en héritage, les Romanov | accessdate =23 July 2008 |publisher=[[France 3]] |language=French }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, a documentary on his life was produced by the Russian television channel [[NTV (Russia)|NTV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://4sale.ntv.ru/eng/item/2902/ |title=Emperor’s grandson |accessdate=5 August 2008 |publisher=[[NTV (Russia)|NTV]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Romanov Family Association==
His father Roman Petrovich came up with the idea of a family association of the Romanovs in the mid-1970s.&lt;ref name=FT/&gt; After looking through the papers of his father, who died in 1978, Nicholas found that everything was in place for its creation. He then wrote to all the members of the Romanov family who had been in communication with his father and it was agreed that a family association should be created. A year later, in 1979, the [[Romanov Family Association]] was officially formed with [[Prince Dmitri Alexandrovich of Russia|Prince Dmitri Alexandrovich]] as president and Nicholas as vice-president. When [[Prince Vasili Alexandrovich of Russia|Vasili Alexandrovich]] became president in 1980, Nicholas remained vice-president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://romanovfundforrussia.org/family/family.html |title=The Romanoff Family Association |accessdate=22 July 2008 |date=29 March 1998 |publisher=[[Romanov Family Association]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080706190519/http://www.romanovfundforrussia.org/family/family.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 6 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, after the death of Vasili Alexandrovich, Prince Nicholas was elected the new president of the Romanov Family Association. The Association currently has as members the majority of the male-line descendants of Emperor [[Nicholas I of Russia]], although [[Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna of Russia|Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna]] has never joined, nor did her late father [[Vladimir Kirillovich, Grand Duke of Russia|Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich]].

==Succession claims==
{{Main|Line of succession to the Russian throne}}
The official position of the Romanov Family Association is that the rights of the family to the Russian Throne were suspended when Emperor [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] abdicated for himself and for his son [[Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia|Tsarevich Alexei]] in favour of his brother [[Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich]] who then deferred ascending the Throne until a Constituent Assembly ratified his rule. Emperor Michael II, as he was legally pronounced by Nicholas II, did not abdicate but empowered the [[Provisional Government]] to rule. Michael's "reign" was ended with his execution in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.romanovfundforrussia.org/family/succession.html |title=The law of succession of the Imperial House of Russia |accessdate=22 July 2008 |publisher=Romanov Family Association |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080531095654/http://www.romanovfundforrussia.org/family/succession.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 31 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prince Nicholas considered that following the death of Grand Duke Vladimir Cyrillovich in 1992 that he was head of the House of Romanov and his rightful successor.&lt;ref name=one/&gt;&lt;ref name=statement/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.chivalricorders.org/royalty/gotha/russuclw.htm |title=The Russian Imperial Succession |accessdate=23 July 2008 |last=Horan |first=Brien Purcell |date=September 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sytske |last=Looijen |title=European Topics |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/1992/06/25/etop.php |publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]] |date=25 June 1992 |accessdate=22 July 2008 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the basis that Vladimir Cyrillovich was the last male dynast and all other Romanovs are excluded due to their parents' "unequal" marriages, Vladimir's daughter [[Maria Vladimirovna of Russia|Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna]] also put forward a claim to the headship of the imperial house on her father's death. With the exception of Grand Duchess Maria, Prince Nicholas was recognized by the rest of the family as head of the Imperial House.&lt;ref&gt;Massie p. 274&lt;/ref&gt; However, the final edition of the ''Almanach de Gotha'' published by [[Justus Perthes]], in 1944, stated that the marriage of Nicholas's parents was "not in conformity with the laws of the house"&lt;ref&gt;"Almanach de Gotha", ''Russie'', (Gotha: Justus Perthes, 1944), page 107, (French) ''"en mariage non conforme aux lois de la maison"''.&lt;/ref&gt; although some previous editions had listed him as a dynastic member of the Imperial House. Prince Nicholas said regarding "unequal" marriages in the Imperial Family:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Our parents married commoners. So what? We have married commoners. Again, so what? There was nobody to ask us to renounce our rights, so we married without renouncing them, and we and our children still have rights to the throne of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Massie p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Prince Nicholas led the Romanov family at the funeral in [[St. Petersburg]] of the last Russian Emperor [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] and his family in July 1998.&lt;ref name=one/&gt; As head of the family he was also present at the reburial of the remains of the [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna]] in Russia in September 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.romanovfundforrussia.org/family/empress.html |title=The Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna reburied in St Petersburg |accessdate=22 July 2008 |publisher=Romanov Family Association |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080619180938/http://www.romanovfundforrussia.org/family/empress.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 19 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prince Nicholas and his brother Prince Dmitri had been responsible for lobbying the [[Danish royal family]] and the Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] to allow the transfer of the Dowager Empress’s remains to Russia so they could be buried alongside her husband [[Alexander III of Russia|Emperor Alexander III]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Clem |last=Cecil |title=Tsar's mother to be returned home |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article1034429.ece |publisher=[[The Times]] |date=5 December 2003 |accessdate=23 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until his marriage to a Roman Catholic, Prince Nicholas was in the [[line of succession to the British throne]] through his descent from Nicholas the First's wife [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Charlotte of Prussia)|Charlotte of Prussia]], a descendant of [[George I of Great Britain]].

==Marriage and children==
[[File:Coat of arms of the House of della Gherardesca.svg|thumb|right|Coat of arms of the House of della Gherardesca]]
In 1950, Prince Nicholas and the Countess Sveva della Gherardesca (born 1930), a member of the Italian [[Della Gherardesca family|della Gherardesca]] noble family from [[Tuscany]] and a direct descendant of Count [[Ugolino della Gherardesca]], met at a party in Rome. They were married in [[Florence]] in a [[civil ceremony]] on 31 December 1951 followed by a religious ceremony on 21 January 1952 in the Russian Cathedral at [[Cannes]].&lt;ref name=one/&gt;

Prince Nicholas and his wife had three daughters:
*Princess Natalia Nikolaevna Romanova (born 1952), married to Giuseppe Consolo (born 1948). Her daughter is the Italian actress [[Nicoletta Romanoff]].
*Princess Elisaveta Nikolaevna Romanova (born 1956), married to Mauro Bonacini (born 1950);
*Princess Tatiana Nikolaevna Romanova (born 1961), married firstly to Giambattista Alessandri (born 1958), then Giancarlo Tirotti (born 1947).

Prince Nicholas and his wife lived in [[Rougemont, Switzerland]], for seven months every year, usually in the winter. During the rest of the year they stayed in Italy with their daughters.&lt;ref name=gstaad/&gt; The prince still used the [[Julian calendar]] and was fluent in French, Russian, Italian and English. He was also able to read Spanish.&lt;ref name=one/&gt;

Prince Nicholas's death in Tuscany aged 91 was reported on 15 September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rbth.com/society/2014/09/15/prince_nikolai_romanov_dies_in_italy_at_the_age_of_91_39793.html|title=Prince Nikolai Romanov dies in Italy at the age of 91|publisher=Russia Beyond the Headlines|date=15 September 2014|agency=ITAR-TASS}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was survived by  his wife, their three children, five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.ria.ru/society/20140915/192972945/Most-Senior-Member-of-Romanov-Dynasty-Dies-at-92-in-Italy.html|title=Most Senior Member of Romanov Dynasty Dies at 92 in Italy|publisher=RIA Novosti|date=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Title and style==
*''[[His Highness]]'' Prince Nicholas Romanovich of Russia

Since the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], members of the Romanov family have tended to drop the territorial designation “of Russia” and use a princely title with the surname Romanov. However this title, and even his right to the surname Romanov are disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dynastic Succession |url=http://www.imperialhouse.ru/eng/imperialhouse/succession.html |publisher=imperialhouse.ru |accessdate=29 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090609161754/http://www.imperialhouse.ru/eng/imperialhouse/succession.html |archivedate=9 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''People's Democracy''' ('''PD''') was a political organisation that, while supporting the campaign for [[civil rights]] for [[Northern Ireland]]'s [[Irish Catholic|Catholic minority]], stated that such rights could only be achieved through the establishment of a [[Socialist state|socialist republic]] for all of [[Ireland]].  It demanded more radical reforms of the [[government of Northern Ireland]] than the [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]] it came from.

==Foundation==
It was founded on 9 October 1968 at a meeting held in the [[Queen's University Belfast]] debating hall. A catalyst for its foundation had been the attack on a [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]] (NICRA) march in [[Derry]] on 5 October by the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC).{{sfn|Devlin|1969|p=101}}

The group consisted mainly of students who were involved with the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association or left wing groups such as the Labour Clubs and Young Socialist Alliance.

At the meeting the group decided on five aims:
* [[One man, one vote]]
* Repeal of the [[Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922|Special Powers Act]]
* An end to [[gerrymandering]] of electoral boundaries
* Freedom of speech and assembly
* Fair allocation of jobs and housing

It was initially led by a committee of ten members which consisted of Queen's University students Malcolm Miles, Fergus Woods, Anne McBurnley, Ian Godall, [[Bernadette Devlin]], Joe Martin, Eddie McCamely, Michael O'Kane and Patricia Drinan, as well as [[Kevin Boyle (lawyer)|Kevin Boyle]], a law lecturer at QUB.  Other prominent members included [[Cyril Toman]], [[Eamon McCann]] and [[Michael Farrell (activist)|Michael Farrell]].{{sfn|Devlin|1969|p=102}}

The name of the group was selected by accident, according to [[Bernadette Devlin]].
{{quote|The next evening our leaflet and poster were approved by a mass meeting of the students, and taken off to be printed. John D. Murphy, our printer, got the material late at night and only then noticed that our organisation had no name. To comply with the law, he had to put up the name of the organisation responsible at the bottom of the leaflet, and, the story goes, he read through it, decided it was all about people's rights and christened us People's Democracy.{{sfn|Devlin|1969|p=103}} }}

After marches in Belfast, in imitation of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King, Jr.'s]] [[Selma to Montgomery marches]], about 40 People's Democracy members held a four-day march between [[Belfast]] and Derry starting on 1 January 1969. The march was repeatedly attacked by [[Ulster loyalism|loyalists]] along its route, including an incident at [[Burntollet]] bridge on 4 January where the marchers were attacked by about 200 [[Unionism in Ireland|unionists]], including off-duty [[Ulster Special Constabulary|special constables]], armed with iron bars, bottles and stones, while the RUC stood by and watched.&lt;ref&gt;''The IRA'' by Tim Pat Coogan ({{ISBN|978-0312294168}}), page 626&lt;/ref&gt;

PD became increasingly radicalised as a result of these events. They also attacked the [[Censorship in the Republic of Ireland|censorship laws in the Republic]] &amp;mdash; earning a rebuke from [[Ruairi Quinn]] and Basil Miller, then leaders of Students for Democratic Action, a revolutionary socialist student organisation, for letting [[British imperialism]] off the hook. In later years, members of the PD either quit politics altogether or became independent left-wing activists (such as Devlin and Farrell).

==Development==
In 1971, PD became a founder of the [[Socialist Labour Alliance]].

In the mid-1970s, the experience of the Ulster Workers' Council strike led to PD predicting a loyalist takeover in Northern Ireland, but it later came round to the view that this perspective was incorrect, giving loyalism a degree of autonomy from imperialism which it did not possess.&lt;ref&gt;John McAnulty ''A People Undefeated''&lt;/ref&gt;  The minority which clung to the old perspective left to form the Left Revolutionary Group, becoming the [[Red Republican Party]] in 1976, which was moribund by 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barberis, John McHugh and Mike Tyldesley ''Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations''&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s, PD evolved towards [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] positions and, by merging with the [[Dublin]]-based [[Movement for a Socialist Republic]], was recognised by the [[reunified Fourth International]] as its Irish section.

PD was especially active around the issues of [[internment]] and prisoners' rights. Following the formation of the National H-Block/Armagh Committee in 1979 to build support for the Republican prisoners then on the "[[blanket protest]]" in support of political status and the subsequent death of [[Bobby Sands]] and nine of his comrades during the [[1981 Irish hunger strike|H-Block hunger strikes]], a number of members of the organisation, led by Vincent Doherty - then a member of the Political Committee and a former party general election candidate - argued that PD should join Sinn Féin, which had moved openly to the left in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

In [[Northern Ireland local elections, 1981|1981]], two members of People's Democracy were elected to [[Belfast City Council]]. John McAnulty and Fergus O'Hare were elected in a joint campaign with the [[Irish Republican Socialist Party|IRSP]]. [[Fergus O'Hare]] won the council seat of [[Gerry Fitt]], a sitting Westminster MP. O'Hare had been a founding member of the National H-Block/Armagh Committee and had previously been chairperson of the Political Hostages Release Committee which spearheaded the campaign against internment in the early 1970s. He subsequently went on to found the first Irish-language secondary school in Northern Ireland [[Meánscoil Feirste]].

When Sinn Féin ended its boycott of elections and gained mass support among the republican community, PD entered a political crisis. From 1982 on, a number of activists left them and joined Sinn Féin. At a PD national conference in 1986, a group including [[Anne Speed]] proposed the dissolution of the group and that the members all join SF as individuals. This position was defeated by 19 votes to five. A few weeks later the minority of five resigned from PD followed by their supporters and joined [[Sinn Féin]]. The remaining rump who continued to oppose this view maintained PD as a small propaganda group.

In the early 1990s the remaining members of PD initiated the [[Irish Committee for a Marxist Programme]] as an attempt to regroup [[socialists]] and left wing [[Irish Republicanism|republicans]]. This project ended in 1996, when PD dissolved and reconstituted itself as [[Socialist Democracy (Ireland)|Socialist Democracy]], adopting the program put forward by the ICMP.

'''Reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP)''' is defined as removed pavement materials containing [[asphalt]] and aggregates. These materials are generated when asphalt pavements are removed for reconstruction, resurfacing, or to obtain access to buried utilities. When properly crushed and screened, RAP consists of high-quality, well-graded aggregates coated by asphalt [[cement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/research/infrastructure/structures/97148/rap131.cfm|title=Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement - Material Description - User Guidelines for Waste and Byproduct Materials in Pavement Construction - FHWA-RD-97-148|website=www.fhwa.dot.gov|access-date=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asphalt pavement has been America's most recycled material for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;A Study of the Use of Recycled Paving Material: Report to Congress, June 1993, [[Federal Highway Administration]] and [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], Washington, DC.

"Reclaimed asphalt pavement—a literature review."

[[File:Regulamentul organic 1832.png|thumb|200px|1832 [[Wallachia]]n copy of ''Regulamentul Organic'' (printed in the [[Romanian Cyrillic alphabet|Romanian Cyrillic transitional alphabet]])]]
'''''Regulamentul Organic''''' ({{IPA-ro|reɡulaˈmentul orˈɡanik|lang}}, ''Organic Regulation''; {{lang-fr|Règlement Organique}}; {{lang-rus|Органический регламент|r=Organichesky reglament}})&lt;ref name = "name Djuvara 323"&gt;The name also has plural versions in all languages concerned, referring to the dual nature of the document; however, the singular version is usually preferred. The text was originally written in French, submitted to the approval of the [[State Council of Imperial Russia]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], and then subject to debates in the [[Sfatul boieresc|Assemblies]] in [[Bucharest]] and [[Iași]]; the Romanian translation followed the adoption of the ''Regulament'' in its French-language version. (Djuvara, p. 323).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Giurescu 123"&gt;Giurescu, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Hitchins 203"&gt;It is probable that the title was chosen over designation as "Constitution(s)" in order to avoid the revolutionary meaning implied by the latter (Hitchins, p. 203).&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Constitution of Romania|quasi-constitutional]] [[organic law]] enforced in 1834–1835 by the [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russian]] authorities in [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]] (the two [[Danubian Principalities]] that were to become the basis of the modern [[Romania| Romanian state]]). The document partially confirmed the traditional government (including rule by the ''[[hospodar]]s'') and set up a common Russian [[protectorate]] which lasted until 1854. The ''Regulament'' itself remained in force until 1858. [[Conservatism|Conservative]] in its scope, it also engendered a period of unprecedented reforms which provided a setting for the [[Westernization]] of the local society. The ''Regulament'' offered the two Principalities their first common system of government.

==Background==
{{historomania}}
{{main|History of the Russo-Turkish Wars|Phanariotes}}
The two principalities, owing [[tribute]] and progressively ceding political control to the [[Ottoman Empire]] since the [[Romania in the Middle Ages|Middle Ages]],&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara,  p. 24, 57.&lt;/ref&gt; had been subject to frequent Russian interventions as early as the [[Russo-Turkish War (1710–1711)]],&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 31, 76–7.&lt;/ref&gt; when a Russian army penetrated Moldavia and [[List of Russian rulers|Emperor]] [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] probably established links with the Wallachians.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the Ottomans enforced a tighter control on the region, effected under [[Phanariotes|Phanariote]] ''hospodars'' (who were appointed directly by the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]]).&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 41–58.&lt;/ref&gt; Ottoman rule over the region remained contested by competition from Russia, which, as an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] empire with claim to a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] heritage, exercised notable influence over locals.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 284–5, 308.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the Porte made several concessions to the rulers and boyars of Moldavia and Wallachia, as a means to ensure the preservation of its rule.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 57, 92–3, 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca]], signed in 1774 between the Ottomans and Russians, gave Russia the right to intervene on behalf of Eastern Orthodox Ottoman subjects in general, a right which it used to sanction Ottoman interventions in the Principalities in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 81, 284.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Russia intervened to preserve reigns of ''hospodars'' who had lost Ottoman approval in the context of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (the ''[[casus belli]]'' for the [[Russo-Turkish War (1806–1812)|1806–12 conflict]]),&lt;ref name = "Djuvara 282-4"&gt;Djuvara, pp. 282–4.&lt;/ref&gt; and remained present in the Danubian states, vying for influence with the [[Austrian Empire]], well into the 19th century and annexing Moldavia's [[Bessarabia]] in 1812.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp.133, 184–7, 281–304.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the influx of [[Greeks in Romania|Greeks]], arriving in the Principalities as a new [[bureaucracy]] favored by the ''hospodars'', the traditional [[Estates of the realm]] (the ''[[Sfatul boieresc|Divan]]'') remained under the tight control of a number of high [[boyar]] families, who, while intermarrying with members of newly arrived communities, opposed reformist attempts – and successfully preserved their [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]]s by appealing against their competitors to both [[Istanbul]] and [[Saint Petersburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 69, 123–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rom1793-1812.png|thumb|left|200px|Moldavia (in orange) and Wallachia (in green), between 1793 and 1812]]
In the last decades of the 18th century, the growing strategic importance of the region brought about the establishment of [[consul (representative)|consulates]] representing European powers directly interested in observing local developments (Russia, the Austrian Empire, and [[France]]; later, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] ones were opened as well).&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Iorga"&gt;Iorga, ''Histoire des relations. La Monarchie de juillet…''&lt;/ref&gt;  An additional way for consuls to exercise particular policies was the awarding of a privileged status and protection to various individuals, who were known as ''[[sudiți]]'' ("subjects", in the language of the time) of one or the other of the foreign powers.&lt;ref name = "Iorga" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 184–7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Giurescu 288"&gt;Giurescu, p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

A seminal event occurred in 1821, when the rise of Greek [[nationalism]] in various parts of the [[Balkans]] in connection with the [[Greek War of Independence]] led to occupation of the two states by the [[Filiki Eteria]], a Greek [[secret society]] who sought, and initially obtained, Russian approval. A mere takeover of the government in Moldavia, the Eterist expedition met a more complex situation in Wallachia, where a [[Regent|regency]] of high boyars attempted to have the anti-Ottoman Greek nationalists confirm both their rule and the rejection of Phanariote institutions. A compromise was achieved through their common support for [[Tudor Vladimirescu]], an [[Oltenia]]n ''[[Vladimirescu's Pandur|pandur]]'' leader who had already instigated an [[Wallachian uprising of 1821|anti-Phanariote rebellion]] (as one of the Russian ''sudiți'', it was hoped that Vladimirescu could assure Russia that the revolt was not aimed against its influence). However, the eventual withdrawal of Russian support made Vladimirescu seek a new agreement with the Ottomans, leaving him to be executed by an alliance of Eterists and weary locals (alarmed by his new anti-boyar program); after the Ottomans invaded the region and crushed the Eteria, the boyars, still perceived as a third party, obtained from the Porte an end to the Phanariote system&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 296–301.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Giurescu 114-5"&gt;Giurescu, pp. 114–5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Hitchins 178-91"&gt;Hitchins, pp. 178–191.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Iorga Roumains"&gt;Iorga, ''Histoire des Roumains. Renaissance roumaine''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Akkerman Convention and Treaty of Adrianople==
{{see also|Akkerman Convention|Treaty of Adrianople (1829)}}
[[File:Galatzi 1826.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Moldavia]]n [[Danube]] port of [[Galați]] (1826)]]
The first reigns through locals – [[Ioan Sturdza|Ioniță Sandu Sturdza]] as [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Prince of Moldavia]] and [[Grigore IV Ghica]] as [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Prince of Wallachia]] – were, in essence, short-lived: although the [[clientelism|patron-client relation]] between Phanariote ''hospodars'' and a foreign ruler was never revived, Sturdza and Ghica were deposed by the Russian military intervention during the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1828–1829]]. Sturdza's time on the throne was marked by an important internal development: the last in a series of constitutional proposals,&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, 318.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Rußo VI-VII"&gt;Russo, VI–VII.&lt;/ref&gt; advanced by boyars as a means to curb princely authority, ended in a clear conflict between the rapidly decaying class of low-ranking boyars (already forming the upper level of the [[middle class]] rather than a segment of the traditional nobility) and the high-ranking families who had obtained the decisive say in politics. The proponent, [[Ionică Tăutu]],&lt;ref&gt;Russo, VI.&lt;/ref&gt; was defeated in the ''Divan'' after the Russian consul sided with the conservatives (expressing the official view that the [[mixed government|aristocratic-republican]] and [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberal]] aims of the document could have threatened international conventions in place).&lt;ref name = "Iorga Roumains" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 318–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 7, 1826, the Ottoman Empire — anxious to prevent Russia's intervention in the Greek Independence War — negotiatied with it a new status for the region in [[Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi|Akkerman]], one which conceded to several requests of the inhabitants: the resulting ''[[Akkerman Convention]]'' was the first official document to nullify the principle of Phanariote reigns, instituting seven-year terms for new princes elected by the respective ''Divans'', and awarding the two countries the right to engage in unrestricted [[international trade]] (as opposed to the tradition of limitations and Ottoman [[protectionism]], it only allowed Istanbul to impose its priorities in the [[grain trade]]).&lt;ref name = "Iorga Roumains" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Djuvara 320"&gt;Djuvara, p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Hitchins 198-9"&gt;Hitchins, pp. 198–9.&lt;/ref&gt; The convention also made the first mention of new ''Statutes'', enforced by both powers as governing documents, which were not drafted until after the war – although both Sturdza and Ghica had appointed commissions charged with adopting such projects.&lt;ref name = "Djuvara 323"&gt;Djuvara, p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian military presence on the Principalities' soil was inaugurated in the first days of the war: by late April 1828, the Russian army of [[Peter Wittgenstein]] had reached the [[Danube]] (in May, it entered present-day [[Bulgaria]]).&lt;ref name = "Djuvara 320" /&gt;  The campaign, prolonged for the following year and coinciding with devastating [[bubonic plague]] and [[cholera]] epidemics (which together killed around 1.6% of the population in both countries),&lt;ref name = "Giurescu 122"&gt;Giurescu, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; soon became a drain on local economy:&lt;ref&gt;Hitchins, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; according to British observers, the Wallachian state was required to indebt itself to European creditors for a total sum of ten million ''[[piastre]]s'', in order to provide for the Russian army's needs.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 321–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Accusations of widespread plunder were made by the French author [[Marc Girardin]], who travelled in the region during the 1830s; Girardin alleged that Russian troops had confiscated virtually all cattle for their needs, and that Russian officers had insulted the political class by publicly stating that, in case the supply in oxen was to prove insufficient, boyars were to be tied to carts in their place – an accusation backed by [[Ion Ghica]] in his recollections.&lt;ref&gt;Ghica, ''Bârzof''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Girardin 321"&gt;Girardin, in Djuvara, p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt; He also recorded a mounting dissatifaction with the new rule, mentioning that peasants were especially upset by the continuous maneuvers of troops inside the Principalities' borders.&lt;ref name = "Girardin 323"&gt;Girardin, in Djuvara, p. 323, writing down (1836) the words of a peasant who expressed his skepticism upon receiving news of Russian withdrawal in 1834: "…I see them leaving, returning, and turning their backs on each other, as if dancing. In order for them to leave, they would have to turn their backs on us, all of them, at once!"&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, [[Russophilia]] in the two Principalities appears to have suffered a major blow.&lt;ref name="Pavlowitch ch3 51"/&gt; Despite the confiscations, statistics of the time indicated that the pace of growth in heads of cattle remained steady (a 50% growth appears to have occurred between 1831 and 1837).&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Treaty of Adrianople (1829)|Treaty of Adrianople]], signed on September 14, 1829, confirmed both the Russian victory and the provisions of the Akkerman Convention, partly amended to reflect the Russian political ascendancy over the area. Furthermore, Wallachia's southern border was settled on the Danube [[thalweg]], and the state was given control over the previously Ottoman-ruled ports of [[Brăila]], [[Giurgiu]], and [[Turnu Măgurele]].&lt;ref name = "Djuvara 323" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Giurescu 122 127"&gt;Giurescu, pp. 122, 127.&lt;/ref&gt; The freedom of commerce (which consisted mainly of grain exports from the region) and freedom of navigation on the river and on the [[Black Sea]] were passed into law, allowing for the creation of [[naval fleet]]s in both Principalities in the following years, as well as for a more direct contact with European traders, with the confirmation of the Moldavia and Wallachia's commercial privileges first stipulated at Akkerman (alongside the tight links soon established with Austrian and [[Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia|Sardinian]] traders, the first French ships visited Wallachia in 1830).&lt;ref name = "Iorga" /&gt;

Russian occupation over Moldavia and Wallachia (as well as the Bulgarian town of [[Silistra]]) was prolonged pending the payment of [[war reparation]]s by the Ottomans. [[List of rulers of Russia|Emperor]] [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] assigned [[Fyodor Petrovich Pahlen|Fyodor Pahlen]] as governor over the two countries before the actual peace, as the first in a succession of three ''Plenipotentiary Presidents of the Divans in Moldavia and Wallachia'',&lt;ref name = "Iorga Roumains" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Giurescu 122" /&gt; and official supervisor of the two commissions charged with drafting the ''Statutes''. The bodies, having for secretaries [[Gheorghe Asachi]] in Moldavia and [[Barbu Dimitrie Știrbei]] in Wallachia, had resumed their work while the cholera epidemic was still raging, and continued it after Pahlen had been replaced with [[Pyotr Zheltukhin]] in February 1829.&lt;ref name="Giurescu 123"/&gt;

==Adoption and character==
[[File:Kiseleff.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Pavel Kiselyov]]]]
The post-Adrianople state of affairs was perceived by many of the inhabitants of Wallachia and Moldavia as exceptionally abusive, given that Russia confiscated both of the Principalities' [[treasury|treasuries]],&lt;ref&gt;Hitchins, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; and that Zheltukhin used his position to interfere in the proceedings of the commission, nominated his own choice of members, and silenced all opposition by having anti-Russian boyars expelled from the countries (including, notably, [[Iancu Văcărescu]], a member of the Wallachian ''[[Sfatul boieresc|Divan]]'' who had questioned his methods of government).&lt;ref name = "Djuvara 323" /&gt;  According to the [[radicalism (historical)|radical]] Ghica, "General Zheltukhin [and his subordinates] defended all Russian abuse and injustice. Their system consisted in never listening to complaints, but rather rushing in with accusations, so as to inspire fear, so as the plaintiff would run away for fear of not having to endure a harsher thing than the cause of his [original] complaint".  However, the same source also indicated that this behaviour was hiding a more complex situation: "Those who nevertheless knew Zheltukhin better… said that he was the fairest, most honest, and most kind of men, and that he gave his cruel orders with an aching heart. Many gave assurance that he had addressed to the emperor heart-breaking reports on the deplorable state in which the Principalities were to be found, in which he stated that Russia's actions in the Principalities deserved the scorn of the entire world".&lt;ref&gt;Ghica, ''Bârzof''&lt;/ref&gt;

The third and last Russian governor, [[Pavel Kiselyov]] (or ''Kiseleff''), took office on October 19, 1829, and faced his first major task in dealing with the last outbreaks of plague and cholera, as well as the threat of [[famine]],&lt;ref name = "Pavlowitch ch3 51"&gt;Pavlowitch, Chapter 3, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; with which he dealt by imposing [[quarantine]]s and importing grain from [[Odessa]].&lt;ref name = "Hitchins 202"&gt;Hitchins, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; His administration, lasting until April 1, 1834, was responsible for the most widespread and influential reforms of the period, and coincided with the actual enforcement of the new legislation. The earliest of Kiselyov's celebrated actions was the convening of the Wallachian ''Divan'' in November 1829, with the assurance that abuses were not to be condoned anymore.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchins, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Regulamentul Organic'' was adopted in its two very similar versions&lt;ref&gt;Differences were only obvious in regard to [[government budget]]s and restrictions on the respective total military forces (Giurescu, p. 123).&lt;/ref&gt; on July 13, 1831 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|July 1, OS]]) in Wallachia and January 13, 1832 (January 1, OS) in Moldavia, after having minor changes applied to it in Saint Petersburg (where a second commission from the Principalities, presided by [[Mihail Sturdza]] and [[Alexandru Vilara]], assessed it further).  Its [[ratification]] by [[Ottoman Dynasty|Sultan]] [[Mahmud II]] was not a requirement from Kiselyov's perspective, who began enforcing it as a ''[[fait accompli]]'' before this was granted.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchins, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; The final version of the document sanctioned the first local government abiding by the principles of [[separation of powers|separation]] and [[balance of powers]]. The ''[[hospodars]]'', elected for life (and not for the seven-year term agreed in the ''[[Convention of Akkerman]]'') by an Extraordinary Assembly which comprised [[representation (politics)|representatives]] of merchants and [[guild]]s, stood for the [[executive (government)|executive]], with the right to nominate ministers (whose offices were still referred to using the [[Historical Romanian ranks and titles|traditional titles of courtiers]]) and [[public official]]s;&lt;ref name = "Pavlowitch ch3 51" /&gt; ''hospodars'' were to be voted in office by an [[electoral college]] with a confirmed majority of high-ranking boyars (in Wallachia, only 70 persons were members of the college).&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 323, 325.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Obşteasca Adunare, 1837.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Sfatul boieresc|National Assembly]] of [[Wallachia]] in 1837]]
Each National Assembly (approximate translation of ''Adunarea Obștească''), inaugurated in 1831–2, was a [[legislature]] itself under the control of high-ranking boyars, comprising 35 (in Moldavia) or 42 members (in Wallachia), voted into office by no more than 3,000 electors in each state; the [[judiciary]] was, for the very first time, removed from the control of ''hospodars''.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 323–4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Hitchins 204-5"&gt;Hitchins, 204–5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pavlowitch ch3 51-2"&gt;Pavlowitch, Chapter 3, pp. 51–2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Hitchins 204"&gt;Detailed membership of the Assembly in Wallachia: the [[Metropolitan of Hungro-Wallachia|Metropolitan bishop]] was president, and all other [[bishop]]s were members, together with 20 high-ranking boyars and 18 other boyars (Hitchins, p. 204).&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, the ''Regulament'' confirmed earlier steps leading to the eventual [[separation of church and state]], and, although [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] church authorities were confirmed a privileged position and a political say, the religious institution was closely supervised by the government (with the establishment of a quasi-[[salary expense]]).&lt;ref name = "Hitchins 207"&gt;Hitchins, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[tax reform|fiscal reform]] ensued, with the creation of a [[Tax per head|poll tax]] (calculated per family), the elimination of most [[indirect tax]]es, annual [[state budget]]s (approved by the Assemblies) and the introduction of a [[civil list]] in place of the ''hospodars''' personal treasuries.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchins, pp. 206–7&lt;/ref&gt; New methods of [[bookkeeping]] were regulated, and the creation of [[national bank]]s was projected, but, like the adoption of national [[fixed currency|fixed currencies]], was never implemented.&lt;ref name = "Hitchins 207" /&gt;

According to the historian [[Nicolae Iorga]], "The [boyar] [[oligarchy]] was appeased [by the ''Regulament'''s adoption]: a beautifully harmonious modern form had veiled the old [[Romania in the Middle Ages|medieval]] structure…. The ''[[bourgeoisie]]''… held no influence. As for the peasant, he lacked even the right to administer his own [[commune in Romania|commune]], he was not even allowed to vote for an Assembly deemed, as if in jest, «national»."&lt;ref name = "Iorga Roumains" /&gt; Nevertheless, conservative boyars remained suspicious of Russian tutelage, and several expressed their fear that the regime was a step leading to the creation of a regional ''[[guberniya]]'' for the Russian Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 324–6&lt;/ref&gt; Their mistrust was, in time, reciprocated by Russia, who relied on ''hospodars'' and the direct intervention of its consuls to push further reforms.&lt;ref name = "Pavlowitch ch3 52"&gt;Pavlowitch, Chapter 3, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Kiselyov himself voiced a plan for the region's [[annexation]] to Russia, but the request was dismissed by his superiors.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchins, pp. 208–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic trends==

===Cities and towns===
[[File:AKauffmannJReyIasiFair.PNG|thumb|200px|A cosmopolitan fair in [[Iași]] ({{circa}} 1845)]]
Beginning with the reformist administration of Kiselyov, the two countries experienced a series of profound changes, political, social, as well as cultural.

Despite underrepresentation in politics, the [[middle class]] swelled in numbers, profiting from a growth in trade which had increased the status of merchants. Under continuous competition from the ''[[sudiți]]'', traditional guilds (''bresle'' or ''isnafuri'') faded away, leading to a more competitive, purely [[capitalism|capitalist]] environment.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 187, 189.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Giurescu 127 288"&gt;Giurescu, pp. 127, 288.&lt;/ref&gt; This nevertheless signified that, although the traditional [[Greeks in Romania|Greek]] competition for [[Romanians|Romanian]] merchants and artisans had become less relevant, locals continued to face one from Austrian subjects of various nationalities, as well as from a sizeable [[History of the Jews in Romania|immigration of Jews]] from the [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]] and Russia – prevented from settling in the countryside, Jews usually became keepers of [[inn]]s and [[tavern]]s, and later both bankers and [[leasehold estate|leaseholders of estates]].&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 180–2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pavlowitch ch3 53"&gt;Pavlowitch, Chapter 3, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, an anti-[[Roman Catholicism in Romania|Catholic]] sentiment was growing, based, according to [[Keith Hitchins]], on the assumption that Catholicism and Austrian influence were closely related, as well as on a widespread preference for [[secularism]].&lt;ref&gt;Hitchins, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bucuresti punte 1837.jpg|thumb|200px|left|A bridge in [[Bucharest]] (1837)]]
The Romanian middle class formed the basis for what was to become the [[Liberalism in Romania|liberal electorate]], and accounted for the [[xenophobia|xenophobic]] discourse of the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]] during the latter's first decade of existence (between 1875 and [[World War I]]).&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pavlowitch ch9 185-7"&gt;Pavlowitch, Chapter 9, pp. 185–7&lt;/ref&gt;

Urban development occurred at a very fast pace: overall, the urban population had doubled by 1850.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchins, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; Population estimates for [[Bucharest]], the capital of Wallachia, were about 70,000 inhabitants in 1831, 60,000 in 1851,&lt;ref name="Chambers"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924087904623#page/n405/mode/2up Chambers's Encyclopaedia] Vol. II, 1861 based on [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], 10th Edition&lt;/ref&gt; and about 120,000 in 1859. For [[Iași]], the capital of Moldavia, the estimates were 60,000 inhabitants for 1831, 70,000 for 1851,&lt;ref name="Chambers"/&gt; and about 65,000 for 1859.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pavlowitch ch 3 53"&gt;Pavlowitch chapter 3, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brăila]] and [[Giurgiu]], Danube ports returned to Wallachia by the Ottomans, as well as Moldavia's [[Galați]], grew from the grain trade to become prosperous cities.&lt;ref name = "Djuvara 323" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Giurescu 122 127"&gt;Giurescu, pp. 122, 127.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pavlowitch ch3 53" /&gt; Kiselyov, who had centered his administration on Bucharest, paid full attention to its development, improving its infrastructure and services and awarding it, together with all other cities and towns, a local administration (''see [[History of Bucharest]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Giurescu, pp. 123–7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Public works]] were carried out in the urban sphere, as well as in the massive expansion of the transport and communications system.&lt;ref name = "Djuvara 328"&gt;Djuvara, p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Countryside===
[[File:Raffet - Foire de St. Pierre a Giourgevo.jpg|thumb|200px|A peasant fair in the [[Wallachia]]n city of [[Giurgiu]] (1837)]]
The success of the grain trade was secured by a conservative take on property, which restricted the right of peasants to exploit for their own gain those plots of land they leased on boyar [[estate (land)|estates]] (the ''Regulament'' allowed them to consume around 70% of the total harvest per plot leased, while boyars were allowed to use a third of their estate as they pleased, without any legal duty toward the neighbouring peasant workforce);&lt;ref name = "Pavlowitch ch3 53" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt; at the same time, small properties, created after [[Constantine Mavrocordatos]] had abolished [[serfdom]] in the 1740s, proved less lucrative in the face of competition by large estates – boyars profited from the consequences, as more landowning peasants had to resort to leasing plots while still owing ''[[corvée]]s'' to their lords.&lt;ref name = "Pavlowitch ch3 53" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 259–61.&lt;/ref&gt; Confirmed by the ''Regulament'' at up to 12 days a year,&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 259, 260.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''corvée'' was still less significant than in other parts of Europe; however, since peasants relied on cattle for alternative food supplies and financial resources, and [[pasture]]s remained the exclusive property of boyars, they had to exchange right of use for more days of work in the respective boyar's benefit (as much as to equate the corresponding ''corvée'' requirements in [[Central Europe]]an countries, without ever being enforced by laws).&lt;ref name = "Djuvara 327"&gt;Djuvara, p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt; Several laws of the period display a particular concern in limiting the right of peasants to evade ''corvées'' by paying their equivalent in currency, thus granting the boyars a workforce to match a steady growth in grain demands on foreign markets.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchins, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

In respect to pasture access, the ''Regulament'' divided peasants into three wealth-based categories: ''fruntași'' ("foremost people"), who, by definition, owned 4 [[working animal]]s and one or more cows (allowed to use around 4 [[hectare]]s of pasture); ''mijlocași'' ("middle people") – two working animals and one cow (around 2 hectares); ''codași'' ("backward people") – people who owned no property, and not allowed the use of pastures.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 326–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the major [[demography|demographic]] changes took their toll on the countryside. For the very first time, food supplies were no longer abundant in front of a [[population growth]] ensured by, among other causes, the effective measures taken against epidemics; rural–urban migration became a noticeable phenomenon, as did the relative increase in [[urbanization]] of traditional rural areas, with an explosion of settlements around established [[fair]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchins, pp. 215–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nicolae Grigorescu 019.jpg|thumb|200px| [[Nicolae Grigorescu]]'s ''Countryside courtyard'', depicting a typical peasant lodging in the 19th century]]
These processes also ensured that [[Industrial Revolution|industrialization]] was minimal (although [[factory|factories]] had first been opened during the [[Phanariotes]]): most revenues came from a highly productive agriculture based on peasant labour, and were invested back into agricultural production.&lt;ref name = "Pavlowitch ch3 53" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Djuvara 327" /&gt;  In parallel, hostility between agricultural workers and landowners mounted: after an increase in [[lawsuit]]s involving leaseholders and the decrease in quality of ''corvée'' outputs, resistance, hardened by the examples of [[Tudor Vladimirescu]] and various ''[[hajduk]]s'', turned to [[sabotage]] and occasional violence.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 262–3, 329.&lt;/ref&gt; A more serious incident occurred in 1831, when around 60,000 peasants protested against projected [[conscription]] criteria; Russian troops dispatched to quell the revolt killed around 300 people.&lt;ref name = "Djuvara 328" /&gt;

==Political and cultural setting==
The most noted cultural development under the ''Regulament'' was Romanian [[Romantic nationalism]], in close connection with [[Francophile|Francophilia]]. [[Modernization|Institutional modernization]] engered a renaissance of the [[intelligentsia]]. In turn, the concept of "[[nation]]" was first expanded beyond its coverage of the boyar category,&lt;ref&gt;Berindei, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pavlowitch ch3 54"&gt;Pavlowitch, chapter 3, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; and more members of the privileged displayed a concern in solving problems facing the peasantry: although rarer among the high-ranking boyars, the interest was shared by most [[progressivism|progressive]] political figures by the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;Berindei, pp. 9, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Djuvara 331"&gt;Djuvara, p. 331.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Wallachian infantery marching, 1837.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The [[Wallachian military forces|Wallachian militia]] maneuvering in 1837]]

Nationalist themes now included a preoccupation for the [[Origin of the Romanians|Latin origin of Romanians]]&lt;ref name = "Pavlowitch ch3 53" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hitchins, pp. 175, 176–7.&lt;/ref&gt; and the common (but since discarded) reference to the entire region as ''[[Dacia]]'' (first notable in the title of [[Mihail Kogălniceanu]]'s ''[[Dacia Literară]]'', a short-lived Romantic [[literary magazine]] published in 1840).  As a trans-border notion, ''Dacia'' also indicated a growth in Pan-Romanian sentiment – the latter had first been present in several boyar requests of the late 18th century, which had called for the union of the two [[Danubian Principalities]] under the protection of European powers (and, in some cases, under the rule of a foreign prince).&lt;ref name = "Berindei 8"&gt;Berindei, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; To these was added the circulation of fake documents which were supposed to reflect the text of ''[[Capitulations of the Ottoman Empire|Capitulations]]'' awarded by the [[Ottoman Empire]] to its Wallachian and Moldavian [[vassal]]s in the [[Romania in the Middle Ages|Middle Ages]], claiming to stand out as proof of rights and privileges which had been long neglected (''see also [[Islam in Romania]]'').&lt;ref name = "Berindei 8" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Hitchins 192-3"&gt;Hitchins, pp. 192–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Education in Romania|Education]], still accessible only to the wealthy, was first removed from the domination of the [[Greek language]] and [[Ancient Greece|Hellenism]] upon the disestablishment of Phanariotes sometime after 1821; the attempts of [[Gheorghe Lazăr]] (at the [[Saint Sava College]]) and [[Gheorghe Asachi]] to engender a transition towards [[Romanian language|Romanian-language]] teaching had been only moderately successful, but Wallachia became the scene of such a movement after the start of [[Ion Heliade Rădulescu]]'s teaching career and the first issue of his newspaper, ''[[Curierul Românesc]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 215, 352.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Giurescu 125"&gt;Giurescu, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Hitchins 235-6"&gt;Hitchins, pp. 235–6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Iorga Roumains" /&gt;  Moldavia soon followed, after Asachi began printing his highly influential magazine ''[[Albina Românească]]''.&lt;ref name = "Iorga Roumains" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Hitchins 244"&gt;Hitchins, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Regulament'' brought about the creation of new schools, which were dominated by the figures of [[Transylvania]]n Romanians who had taken exile after expressing their dissatifaction with [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] rule in their homeland – these teachers, who usually rejected the adoption of French cultural models in the otherwise [[conservatism|conservative]] society (viewing the process as an unnatural one), counted among them [[Ioan Maiorescu]] and [[August Treboniu Laurian]].&lt;ref name = "Iorga Roumains" /&gt;
Another impetus for nationalism was the Russian-supervised creation of small [[standing army|standing armies]] (occasionally referred to as "[[militia]]s"; ''see [[Moldavian military forces]] and [[Wallachian military forces]]''). The Wallachian one first maneuvered in the autumn of 1831, and was supervised by Kiselyov himself.&lt;ref&gt;Giurescu, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Ion Ghica]], the prestige of military careers had a relevant tradition: "Only the arrival of the Muscovites [sic] in 1828 ended [the] young boyars' sons flighty way of life, as it made use of them as commissioners (''mehmendari'') in the service of Russian generals, in order to assist in providing the troops with [supplies].

The [[Westernization]] of Romanian society took place at a rapid pace, and created a noticeable, albeit not omnipresent, [[generation gap]].&lt;ref name = "Iorga" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pavlowitch ch3 54"&gt;Pavlowitch, chapter 3, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berindei, pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Giurescu 125-6"&gt;Giurescu, pp. 125–6.&lt;/ref&gt; The paramount cultural model was the French one, following a pattern already established by contacts between the region and the [[French Consulate]] and [[First French Empire|First Empire]] (attested, among others, by the existence of a Wallachian plan to [[petition]] [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]], whom locals believed to be a descendant of the [[List of Byzantine Emperors|Byzantine Emperors]], with a complaint against the Phanariotes,&lt;ref&gt;Berindei, pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Ghica Băltărețu"&gt;Ghica, ''Băltărețu''.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by an actual anonymous petition sent in 1807 from Moldavia).&lt;ref&gt;Hitchins, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; This trend was consolidated by the French cultural model partly adopted by the Russians,&lt;ref&gt;Giurescu, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; a growing mutual sympathy between the Principalities and France, increasingly obvious under the French [[July Monarchy]],&lt;ref name = "Iorga" /&gt; and, as early as the 1820s, the enrolment of young boyars in [[Paris]]ian educational institutions (coupled with the 1830 opening of a French-language school in Bucharest, headed by [[Jean Alexandre Vaillant]]).&lt;ref name = "Iorga" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Russo IV"&gt;Russo, IV.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Hitchins 213"&gt;The refoundation of the [[Saint Sava College]] as a French-language school under [[Gheorghe Bibescu]] was, nevertheless, viewed with hostility by [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberal]] political figures, who were by then stronger supporters of [[Romantic nationalism]] and, as such, of teaching in Romanian (Hitchins, p.213)&lt;/ref&gt; The young generation eventually attempted to curb French borrowings, which it had come to see as endangering its nationalist aspirations.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchins, pp. 240–1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statutory rules and nationalist opposition==

[[File:Proclamaţia de la Islaz (1848).jpg|thumb|200px|left|The ''[[Islaz Proclamation]]'']]
In 1834, despite the founding documents' requirements, Russia and the Ottoman Empire agreed to appoint the first two ''[[hospodar]]s'' (instead of providing for their election), as a means to ensure both the monarchs' support for a moderate pace in reforms and their allegiance in front of conservative boyar opposition.&lt;ref name = "Pavlowitch ch3 52"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Djuvara, p. 325."&gt;Djuvara, p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt;  The choices were [[Alexandru II Ghica]] (the stepbrother of the previous monarch, [[Grigore IV Ghica|Grigore IV]]) as [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Prince of Wallachia]] and [[Mihail Sturdza]] (a distant cousin of [[Ioan Sturdza|Ioniță Sandu]]) as [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Prince of Moldavia]]. The two rulers (generally referred to as ''Domnii regulamentare'' – "statutory" or "regulated reigns"), closely observed by the Russian [[consul (representative)|consuls]] and various Russian technical advisors, soon met a vocal and unified opposition in the Assemblies and elsewhere.&lt;ref name = "Pavlowitch ch3 52" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 324, 329.&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after the confirmation of the ''Regulament'', Russia had begun demanding that the two local Assemblies each vote an ''Additional Article'' (''Articol adițional'') – one preventing any modification of the texts without the common approval of the courts in Istanbul and Saint Petersburg.&lt;ref name = "Pavlowitch ch3 52" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Djuvara 329"&gt;Djuvara, p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Hitchins 210"&gt;Hitchins, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; In Wallachia, the issue turned into scandal after the pressure for adoption mounted in 1834, and led to a four-year-long standstill, during which a nationalist group in the legislative body began working on its own project for a constitution, proclaiming the Russian [[protectorate]] and Ottoman [[suzerainty]] to be over, and [[self-determination]] with guarantees from all European Powers of the time.&lt;ref name = "Djuvara  329" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Hitchins 210-1"&gt;Hitchins, pp. 210–1.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[radicalism (historical)|radical]] leader of the movement, [[Ion Câmpineanu]], maintained close contacts with [[Poles|Polish]] nobleman [[Adam Jerzy Czartoryski]]'s [[Union of National Unity]] (as well as with other European nationalists Romantics);&lt;ref name = "Pavlowitch ch3 52" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Djuvara 329" /&gt; after the ''Additional Article'' passed due to Ghica's interference and despite boyar protests, Câmpineanu was forced to abandon his seat and take refuge in Central Europe (until being arrested and sent back by the Austrians to be imprisoned in Bucharest).&lt;ref name = "Djuvara 329" /&gt; From that point on, opposition to Ghica's rule took the form of [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] and ''[[carbonari]]''-inspired [[conspiracy (political)|conspiracies]], formed around young politicians such as [[Mitică Filipescu]], [[Nicolae Bălcescu]], [[Eftimie Murgu]], [[Ion Ghica]], [[Christian Tell]], [[Dimitrie Macedonski]], and [[Cezar Bolliac]] (all of whom held Câmpineanu's ideology in esteem)&lt;ref&gt;Berindei, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; — in 1840, Filipescu and most of his group (who had tried in vain to profit from the Ottoman crisis engendered by [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]]'s rebellion)&lt;ref&gt;Hitchins, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; were placed under arrest and imprisoned in various locations.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Giurescu 132-3"&gt;Giurescu, pp. 132–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arderea Regulamentului Organic şi a Arhondologiei.jpg|thumb|200px|The burning of the Wallachian ''Regulament'' and of the register of [[Historical Romanian ranks and titles|boyar ranks]] during the [[1848 Wallachian revolution|1848 revolution]]]]
Noted abuses against the [[rule of law]] and the consequent threat of rebellion made the Ottoman Empire and Russia withdraw their support for Ghica in 1842,&lt;ref name = "Iorga Roumains" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pavlowitch ch3 52" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Djuvara, p. 325."/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Hitchins 212"&gt;Hitchins, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; and his successor, [[Gheorghe Bibescu]], reigned as the first and only prince to have been elected by any one of the two Assemblies. In Moldavia, the situation was less tense, as Sturdza was able to calm down and manipulate opposition to Russian rule while introducing further reforms.&lt;ref name = "Iorga Roumains" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pavlowitch ch3 52" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Djuvara, p. 325."/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Hitchins 213-5"&gt;Hitchins, 213–5.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1848, upon the outbreak of the [[Revolutions of 1848|European revolutions]], [[Liberalism in Romania|liberalism]] consolidated itself into more overt opposition, helped along by contacts between Romanian students with the [[Revolutions of 1848 in France|French movement]].&lt;ref name = "Iorga Roumains" /&gt;  Nevertheless, the [[1848 Moldavian revolution|Moldavian revolution]] of late March 1848 was an abortive one, and led to the return of Russian troops on its soil.&lt;ref name = "Djuvara 331"&gt;Djuvara, p. 331.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Hitchins, pp. 292-4"&gt;Hitchins, pp. 292–4.&lt;/ref&gt; [[1848 Wallachian revolution|Wallachia's revolt]] was successful: after the ''[[Proclamation of Islaz]]'' on June 21 sketched a new legal framework and [[land reform]] with an end to all ''[[corvée]]s'' (a program acclaimed by the crowds), the conspirators managed to topple Bibescu, who had by then dissolved the Assembly,&lt;ref name = "Hitchins 212" /&gt; without notable violence, and established a Provisoral Government in Bucharest.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 330–1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Giurescu 133-5"&gt;Giurescu, pp. 133–5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Hitchins 294-307"&gt;Hitchins, pp. 294–307.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pavlowitch ch3 55"&gt;Pavlowitch, Chapter 3, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

The new executive, orchestrating the public burning of the ''Regulament'' in September, attempted to play Ottoman interests against Russian ones, trying to obtain backing from the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]]; the relative initial success was rendered void after Russian diplomats pressured [[Ottoman Dynasty|Sultan]] [[Abd-ul-Mejid I]] to intervene in their place (and thus not risk losing yet more control over the region to a more determined Russian expedition).&lt;ref name = "Iorga Roumains" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Djuvara 331" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pavlowitch ch3 55" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Giurescu 135-6"&gt;Giurescu, pp. 135–6.&lt;/ref&gt; A Russian occupation over Wallachia soon joined the Ottoman one (begun on September 18), and both lasted until April 1851; in 1849, the two powers signed the [[Convention of Balta Liman]], which asserted the right of the Porte to nominate ''hospodars'' for seven-year terms.&lt;ref name = "Pavlowitch ch3 55" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Giurescu, pp. 139–40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Hitchins 335-6"&gt;Hitchins, pp. 335–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crimean War==
{{main|Crimean War}}
[[File:Cahul Ismail si Bolgrad.PNG|thumb|left|200px|Russian–Moldavian border in 1856–1857]]
The [[Crimean War]] again brought the two countries under Russian military administration, inaugurated in 1853. The ''hospodars'' of the period, [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Prince]] [[Grigore Alexandru Ghica]] in Moldavia and [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Prince]] [[Barbu Dimitrie Știrbei]] in Wallachia, were removed from their thrones, and the region was governed by the Russian general [[Aleksandr Ivanovich Budberg]].

As the [[Balkans]] remained a secondary theatre of war, the two Principalities were taken over by a neutral Austrian administration in September 1854 – part of a settlement between the Porte and Russia (the Austrians remained until 1857).&lt;ref name = "Pavlowitch ch3 56"&gt;Pavlowitch, Chapter 3, p.56&lt;/ref&gt; Grigore Ghica and Știrbei were returned to the thrones in the same year, and completed the last series of reforms carried under the terms of the ''Regulament''. The most far-reaching among these were the ones concerning [[Slavery in Romania|Roma slavery]]. In Moldavia, Romas were liberated, without a period of transition, on December 22, 1855; the change was more gradual in Wallachia, where measures to curb trade had been taken earlier, and where the decision to ban the ownership of slaves was taken by Știrbei on February 20, 1856.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 276–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Concerned by worsening boyar-peasant relations, Știrbei, who governed without an Assembly (and had instead appointed his own ''Divan''), enacted measures to improve the situation in the countryside, and ultimately enforced [[employment|contract-based]] work as the rule on estates (whereby peasants who were not indebted after five years in service could leave the land they were working on).&lt;ref&gt;Hitchins, pp. 337–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Austrian troops, 25 August-6 September 1854, Lanzedelli.jpg|thumb|200px|Austrian troops in [[Bucharest]], 1854]]
This was the moment when the call for union of the two Principalities began to be voiced with confidence, and the two monarchs showed more or less approval for the designs of the unionist ''[[Partida Națională]]'' (created by 1848 revolutionaries who had returned from exile).

The war ended with the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]] (March 30, 1856), which placed the countries, still as Ottoman vassals, under the protectorate of all European Powers (the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], the [[Second French Empire|French Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], Austria, and, never again completely, Russia).  The protector states had to decide on a compromise formula for the projected union; the Ottomans demanded and obtained, in contradiction with the ''Regulament'', the removal of both ''hospodars'' from their thrones, pending elections for the [[ad hoc Divans]].&lt;ref name = "Pavlowitch ch3 56" /&gt;  The outcome remained disputed until the election of [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]], who reigned as first ''[[Domnitor]]'' of the ''United Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia'', the basis of modern [[Romania]].

'''''Sanhedrin''''' (סנהדרין) is one of ten tractates of Seder [[Nezikin]] (a section of the [[Talmud]] that deals with damages, i.e. civil and criminal proceedings). It originally formed one tractate with [[Makkot]], which also deals with criminal law.  The [[Gemara]] of the tractate is noteworthy as precursors to the development of [[common law]] principles, for example the presumption of innocence and the rule that a criminal conviction requires the concurrence of twelve.

==Summary of Sanhedrin==
Within Seder Nezikin, the Sanhedrin focuses on questions of jurisdiction, [[criminal law]] and punishments. The tractate includes eleven chapters, addressing the following topics:
# The different levels of courts and which cases each level presides over
# Laws of the high priest and Jewish king and their involvement in court proceedings
# Civil suits: acceptable witnesses and judges and the general proceedings
# The difference between criminal and civil cases, general proceedings in criminal cases
# Court procedures, including examination of witnesses and the voting of the judges
# Procedures for execution after condemnation, especially stoning
# The 4 types of capital punishments, details of crimes which merit stoning (in fact stoning was only actually done if the convict survived being dropped off a 5-meter cliff first)
# The rebellious son, and other crimes for which the offender is killed before committing the actual prohibition, and the commandments which Jews are to [[Self-sacrifice in Jewish law|die before violating]].
# Details of crimes meriting capital punishment by burning (actually the pouring of hot lead down the throat, the [[Sadducee]] heretics instead used burning at the stake) or beheading; auxiliary punishments
# Details of crimes meriting capital punishment by strangulation (i.e. hanging)
# The [[World to Come]] and who does not receive it. This chapter is known individually by ''Helek'', one of its opening words.

This is the order found in the Gemara, but the Mishna has the last 2 chapters reversed in order.

{{Wills, trusts, estates}}
The '''slayer rule''', in the [[common law]] of [[inheritance]], is a doctrine that prohibits inheritance by a person who [[murder]]s someone from whom he or she stands to inherit (e.g., a murderer does not inherit from parents he or she killed). In calculating inheritance of the decedent's estate, the effect of the slayer rule was that the slayer would be treated as though he or she had predeceased the person who had been murdered, therefore his or her share of the estate would pass to his or her issue.

While convicting someone of the crime of murder requires proof beyond a [[reasonable doubt]], the slayer rule applies to civil law, not criminal law, so it is only necessary to prove the wrongful killing by a preponderance of the [[evidence (law)|evidence]], as in a [[wrongful death claim]]. This means that even a slayer who is acquitted of the murder in criminal court can still be divested of the inheritance by the civil court administering the estate.

==Statutory Response to Slayers==
At common law, American courts used two different theories when dealing with early slayer cases. Some courts would disinherit the slayer because of the public policy principle that a slayer should not profit from his crime (No Profit theory).&lt;ref name="bepress.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://works.bepress.com/adam_hansen/2|title="Arizona's Slayer Statute: The Killer of Testator Intent" by Adam D. Hansen|work=bepress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===No Profit Theory===
In ''Mutual Life v. Armstrong'', the first American case to consider the issue of whether a slayer could profit from his crime, the Court set forth the No Profit (the term "No Profit" theory is a term coined by legal scholar Adam D. Hansen in an effort to distinguish early common law cases that applied a similar outcome when dealing with slayers).&lt;ref name="bepress.com"/&gt; public policy justification of slayer statutes saying: “It would be a reproach to the jurisprudence of the country if one could recover insurance money payable on the death of the party whose life he had feloniously taken.”&lt;ref&gt;''Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Armstrong, 117U.S. 591, 600 (1886).''&lt;/ref&gt;

Other courts were reluctant to disinherit a slayer in absence of a legislatively codified statute directing the court to do so (Strict Construction theory).&lt;ref name="bepress.com"/&gt;

===Strict Construction Theory===
The Strict Construction theory (the term "Strict Construction" theory is a term coined by legal scholar Adam D. Hansen in an effort to distinguish early common law cases that dealt applied a similar outcome when disinheriting slayers).&lt;ref name="bepress.com"/&gt; originated from Judge John Clinton Gray’s dissent in ''[[Riggs v. Palmer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Riggs v. Palmer, 22 N.E. 188, 191-93(1889)''&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Gray argued that the criminal law already established punishment for slayers. A court denying the estate to a slayer was to, in effect, add significant further punishment to what a slayer received under the criminal statute. Judge Gray argued that this was not something the court was permitted to do without an express, written statute. In Judge Gray’s opinion, the court could not simply create or imagine such statutes so as to obtain a morally pleasing result.

Slayer statutes codify the public policy principle that a murderer cannot profit from his crime. Slayer statutes provide a right of civil action to a victim’s successors for the purpose of directing the victim’s testate/intestate property away from the slayer. Such an action is brought by a successor, or other party of interest (e.g., life insurance company, bank), on behalf of the victim’s estate. The slayer statute applies to both real and personal property that would have been acquired by intestacy or by will.&lt;ref&gt;''The Law of Trusts and Trustees'' § 478.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, legal scholar John W. Wade proposed a No Profit theory statutory fix to promote uniformity amongst the states in dealing with slayer cases.&lt;ref&gt;''John W. Wade, Acquisition of Property by Wilfully Killing Another - A Statutory Solution'', 49 Harv. L. Rev. 715 (1936).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, the Uniform Code Commission included No Profit theory language in its first promulgation of the Uniform Probate Code (UPC).&lt;ref&gt;“An individual who feloniously and intentionally kills the decedent forfeits all benefits under this [article] with respect to the decedent's estate, including an intestate share, an elective share, an omitted spouse's or child's share, a homestead allowance, exempt property, and a family allowance. If the decedent died intestate, the decedent's intestate estate passes as if the killer disclaimed his [or her] intestate share.”  § 2-803. Effect of Homicide on Intestate Succession, Wills, Trusts, Joint Assets, Life Insurance, and Beneficiary Designations., Unif. Probate Code § 2-803.&lt;/ref&gt; Forty-eight states have enacted laws that strip a slayer of any inheritance benefit he would have gained from his unlawful act.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Anne-Marie Rhodes, Consequences of Heirs’ Misconduct: Moving from Rules to Discretion, 33 Ohio N.U. L. Rev. 975, 980 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional details==

===United States===
In the [[United States]], most jurisdictions have enacted a slayer statute,&lt;ref&gt;[http://jaapl.org/content/43/3/369]&lt;/ref&gt; which codifies the rule and supplies additional conditions. Such laws have sometimes been [[Statutory interpretation|construed]] narrowly because the relevant statutes are [[Criminal law|criminal]] in nature, and serve to take away someone's rights that are otherwise afforded by law. Interpreted this way, a slayer statute will not prevent the killer from acquiring title to the property by other means. In jurisdictions with a common law slayer rule, a slayer statute may serve to extend and supplement the common law rule, rather than limiting it. For example, where the statute requires the heir to have been convicted to bar inheritance, a common law slayer rule that does not have this requirement may still serve to bar inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;23 [[Am. Jur. 2d]] ''Descent and Distribution'' § 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arizona====
In 2012, the [[Arizona]] legislature amended Arizona's slayer rule to include the lesser crime of manslaughter in an effort to subject more killers to civil disinheritance.&lt;ref name="bepress.com"/&gt;  Prior to the 2012 amendment, only killers found guilty of homicide in the first or second degree would be disinherited under Arizona's slayer rule.  Several specific cases (e.g., Grace Pianka;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/32541488/ns/dateline_nbc-crime_reports/t/bedroom/#.UZqUgLXVDwM.|title=In the Bedroom|work=msnbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas Grant;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/31005549/ns/dateline_nbc-crime_reports/t/fatal-visions/#.UZZvsLWG3wM|title=Fatal Visions|work=msnbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18559_162-5478688.html|title=48 Hours Mystery: Deadly Prophecy|date=31 October 2009|work=cbsnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/2020/video/faylene-grant-murder-drowning-tub-14352295|title=Faylene Grant: Death by Drowning or Murder?|author=ABC News|work=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Gilbert Ramos)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.azfamily.com/news/local/Police-investigating-multiple-shootings-in-Cave-Creek-103494159.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120822095126/http://www.azfamily.com/news/local/Police-investigating-multiple-shootings-in-Cave-Creek-103494159.html |archivedate=2012-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; prompted the Arizona legislature to amend Arizona's slayer rule by 1) expressly defining “intentional and felonious” to mean any individual who is found guilty of murder in the first or second degree, or the lesser crime of manslaughter; 2) allowing victims to place the decedent’s estate in constructive trust immediately from the time of the killing; and 3) allowing the victims to place the slayer’s estate (i.e., life insurance benefits) in constructive trust, in the case of murder-suicide.  Arizona now touts its slayer rule as the strongest in the nation.

====Maryland====
The [[Maryland]] slayer rule is harsher than most other states. In addition to prohibiting murderers from inheriting from their victims, Maryland's slayer rule prohibits anyone else from inheriting from murder victims through their murderers; Maryland's Slayer Rule is thus similar in structure to [[Attainder#Corruption of blood|corruption of blood]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loislaw.com/ogpc/login.htp?WSRet=12&amp;dockey=16830391@MDCASE&amp;OLDURL=/gpc/index.htp&amp;OLDREFURL=http%3A//news.google.ca/archivesearch%3Fq%3Dmaryland%2B%2522slayer%2Brule%2522%2Bintestacy%26btnG%3DSearch%26um%3D1%26ned%3Dca%26hl%3Den%26scoring%3Da ''Cook v. Grierson''], 380 Md. 502 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a mother leaves her son $50,000, and leaves her son's child (her grandchild) $100,000. She leaves her residuary estate (i.e., whatever else is left of the estate) to her daughter. If the son kills his mother, then under Maryland law, the son's child will inherit the $100,000; however the son's $50,000 (which is also the indirect inheritance of the grandchild through his father), is not available under Maryland law to either the son, or his child.  The $50,000 becomes part of the grandmother's residuary estate and goes to the daughter.

====Texas====
Texas law states "No conviction shall work corruption of blood or forfeiture of estate." However, If a beneficiary of a life insurance policy or contract is convicted and sentenced (including accomplices) in wilfully bringing about the death of the insured, proceeds are then paid in accordance with the Texas Insurance Code.&lt;ref&gt;[https://texas.public.law/statutes/tex._est._code_section_201.058''Texas Estates Code §201.058'']&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4842">'''Soviet–Lithuanian Non-Aggression Pact''' (Lithuanian: ''Lietuvos–TSRS nepuolimo sutartis'') was a [[non-aggression pact]], signed between the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Lithuania]] on September 28, 1926. The pact confirmed all basic provisions of the [[Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty]] of 1920. The Soviet Union continued to recognize [[Vilnius]] and [[Vilnius Region]] to Lithuania, despite the fact that the territories were under Polish control since the [[Żeligowski's Mutiny]] in 1920. It also recognized Lithuania's interests in the [[Klaipėda Region]]. In exchange Lithuania agreed not to join any alliances directed against the Soviet Union, which meant [[international isolation]] at the time when Soviet Union was not a member of the [[League of Nations]].&lt;ref name=eidintas53&gt;{{cite book | last=Eidintas | first=Alfonsas |author2=Vytautas Žalys |author3=Alfred Erich Senn  | editor=Ed.

The pact was registered in ''League of Nations Treaty Series'' on March 4, 1927.&lt;ref&gt;''League of Nations Treaty Series'', [http://www.worldlii.org/int/other/treaties/LNTSer/1927/17.html vol. 60, pp. 146-159].&lt;/ref&gt;

The pact was initiated by Lithuanians who sought a new direction in the foreign policy after the [[Locarno Treaties]].&lt;ref name=eidintas108/&gt; The negotiations started on December 25, 1925 when [[People's Commissar]] of Foreign Affairs [[Georgy Chicherin]] stopped in [[Kaunas]] on his way to Moscow.&lt;ref name=eidintas108/&gt; The negotiations were difficult as Latvia and Estonia disapproved the pact because it prevented creation of the [[Baltic Entente]], Poland claimed that the agreement violated the [[Peace of Riga]], and Germany was wary over strengthening Lithuanian claims to the Klaipėda Region.&lt;ref name=eidintas108&gt;{{cite book | last=Eidintas | first=Alfonsas |author2=Vytautas Žalys |author3=Alfred Erich Senn  | editor=Ed.

The pact was controversial in Lithuania and its ratification by the [[Third Seimas]] on November 5, 1926 caused student protests against "Bolshevization" of Lithuania. As one of the protests was dispersed by force, it is cited as one of the reasons for the [[1926 Lithuanian coup d'état|military coup in December 1926]].&lt;ref name=eidintas53/&gt; However, the diplomats believed that keeping the dispute over Vilnius Region relevant in the European politics was worth the cost. The original pact was set to expire in five years, but on May 6, 1931, it was extended for another five years.&lt;ref&gt;Text in ''League of Nations Treaty Series'', [http://www.worldlii.org/int/other/treaties/LNTSer/1931/282.html vol. 125, pp. 256-263].&lt;/ref&gt; On April 4, 1934, it was further extended to December 31, 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Text of Additional protocol in ''League of Nations Treaty Series'', [http://www.worldlii.org/int/other/LNTSer/1938/79.pdf vol. 186, p. 268].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Skirius | first=Juozas | title=Gimtoji istorija.

'''Steven R. Wilf''' is a Professor of Law at the [[University of Connecticut School of Law]].  He is an expert on [[intellectual property]] law, historical jurisprudence, and [[legal history]].

== Education and Career ==

Born in Philadelphia, Wilf earned his J.D. from [[Yale Law School]] and his Ph.D. from the Yale Department of History in 1995.  He has been a visiting professor at [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] and DADD guest professor at the [[Free University of Berlin]]. Most recently, he has served as Maurice Greenberg Visiting Professor at Yale Law School.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://law.yale.edu/steven-wilf|title=Steven Wilf - Yale Law School|website=law.yale.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
For nearly a decade, Wilf has participated in the Advanced Research Forum on Intellectual Property Rights at the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) in Geneva. He has served as Abraham L. Kaminstein Scholar in Residence at the United States Copyright Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.copyright.gov/newsnet/2016/644.html|title=NewsNet Issue 644 {{!}} U.S. Copyright Office|website=www.copyright.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Wilf has held a number of fellowships at academic institutions, including the John Carter Brown Fellow at [[Brown University]], Comparative Legal History at the [[University of Chicago]], Samuel I. Golieb Fellow at the [[New York University School of Law]], a fellowship at The Institute for Advanced Studies in Jerusalem, and the Center for the Humanities, [[Wesleyan University]], Cluster in Intellectual Property/Piracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wesleyan.edu/humanities/previous/spring%2017/fellowspring17.html|title=Fellows, Current Theme, Center for the Humanities - Wesleyan University|website=www.wesleyan.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011-2012, he was a Lemelson Fellow at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] where he worked on the history of patent law and new technologies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.uconn.edu/content/wilf-named-lemelson-fellow&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to coming to Connecticut, where he was one of the founders of the Intellectual Property Program, Professor Wilf was a [[law clerk]] for the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]].&lt;ref name="profile"&gt;http://www.law.uconn.edu/content/wilf,&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2010-2011, he was a Microsoft Fellow in Law, Property, and the Economic Organization of Society at the Princeton Program in Law and Public Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lapa.princeton.edu/people/steven-wilf|title=Steven Wilf {{!}} Program in Law and Public Affairs {{!}} Princeton University|website=lapa.princeton.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the academic year 2013-2014, Wilf was appointed Elizabeth S. and Richard M. Cashin Fellow, Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Studies at Harvard University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.radcliffe.harvard.edu/people/steven-wilf|title=Steven Wilf|date=2013-09-25|work=Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University|access-date=2018-05-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scholarship and Publications ==

In Intellectual Property law, where he has written on trade secret, trademark, copyright, and patent systems, his research has focused on the role of culture in shaping doctrinal legal rules. As in other areas of his legal historical work, Wilf has identified the contingent elements of historical development, and seeks to unpack alternative normative outcomes.

=== Legal History ===

Wilf’s scholarship in legal history has been fairly eclectic, often crossing temporal and spatial boundaries.  His writings include historiographic essays analyzing legal history method and genres, writings on the role of popular legal culture in the founding era of United States law, studies in the history of intellectual property, the use of artistic forms to express legal ideas, and legal transplants.

Wilf has been particularly known for what he calls “the legal history of the imagination.”  His early book,  ''Law's Imagined Republic: Popular Politics and Criminal Justice in Revolutionary America'', examines the late eighteenth-century emergence of a rich vernacular legal language in the area of criminal law, which was intimately connected to American patriot agitation against the British in the course of the American Revolution. He argues that America's decisive adaptation of rule of law should be rooted in this formative revolutionary extra-official legalism rather than in the court-based interpretation of the United States Constitution that emerges during the period of the Early Republic.

His book ''The Law Before the Law'', addresses the question of how to understand law before a law giving moment. It suggests that archaic law is often revived by those operating in subsequent legal systems in order to establish a less encumbered jurisprudential space. Wilf’s recent scholarship on the history of intellectual property law investigates the seminal role of social movements in constructing legal roles, the difficulties of establishing global legal norms within the context of commercial competition, and the particular place of extra-official grassroots mechanisms for protecting technological and artistic innovation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3120">A '''surtax''' may be a tax levied upon a tax,{{huh|date=November 2012}} or a tax levied upon income.

==United Kingdom==
In 1929, Supertax (which had been introduced in the [[People's Budget|Finance Act 1909]] at the rate of 6 [[History of the British penny (1901-1970)|old pence]] in the [[pound sterling|pound]] (2.5%) on incomes over £5,000 per year) was renamed Sur-tax.  By 1934, the rate was variable from 1 [[shilling]] to 7 shillings and sixpence in the pound (5% to 37.5%). It was replaced by [[income tax]] in 1973.

==United States==
Previous examples of a broadly levied surtax in the [[United States]] include one imposed to help finance the [[Vietnam War]] during the [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] administration.  It essentially consisted of calculating one's [[ordinary income|ordinary federal income tax]] liability and then adding another 10% to it—the amount of the surtax.

As the U.S. income tax system at that time was highly [[progressive taxation|progressive]], the surtax was much higher on those with higher incomes, as a 10% surtax imposed on a tax rate of 20% would result in an overall rate of 22%, while the same surtax imposed on a rate of 50% would result in an overall rate of 55%.

Some anti-war protesters refused to pay this tax, stating that while they were not [[anarchist]]s and understood the need for and positive role played by [[government]] in many areas, they wanted none of their tax money going to a war that they felt was immoral.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}  The surtax was repealed well before the war ended in [[Vietnam]].

Surtaxes can be imposed on other taxes.  They are usually imposed on the grounds of moral justification; they only affect persons who are already paying taxes rather than extending taxation to new areas or persons who are not previously being taxed.

A surtax of 4.3 percent was recently proposed on incomes over $500,000 by Congress to alleviate the alterations to the [[Alternative Minimum Tax]] code in the United States.{{when|date=February 2017}}

A surtax was proposed as part of the 2009–2010 [[health care reform in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Donmoyer |first=Ryan J. |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=a3wUXb42NPX0 |title=U.S. House May Include Surtax on Wealthy in Health-Care Package |publisher=Bloomberg |date=2009-07-07 |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Taxation in the Ottoman Empire sidebar}}
The '''tuz resmi''' was a [[Taxation in the Ottoman Empire|tax]] on [[salt]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Arab world, Turkey, and the Balkans (1878-1914): a handbook of historical statistics|year=1982|publisher=G. K. Hall|isbn=978-0-8161-8164-3|pages=169|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ES8OAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22tuz+resmi%22&amp;dq=%22tuz+resmi%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=FNatTe3PA8T5sgbnh9nXDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 15th century, households working in the salt industry were exempted from taxes such as [[avariz]], in return for their contributions to tuz resmi. In one case, an entire village involved in salt-production was exempted from the [[cizye]], [[avariz-i divaniyye]] ''and'' [[tekalif-i örfiye]] taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Acun|first=Fatma|title=The Other Side of the Coin: Tax Exemptions within the Context of Ottoman Taxation History|journal=Bulgarian Historical Review|year=2002|volume=1|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[Emin (Ottoman official)|emin]] could play a key role in salt taxation; most of the surviving records of the emin stationed in [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]] (who handled customs and tariffs on foreign trade) are receipts for salt duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MIOVIC|first=Vesna|journal=[[Dubrovnik Annals]]|volume=7|year=2003|title=EMIN (CUSTOMS OFFICER) AS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE IN THE REPUBLIC OF DUBROVNIK|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/18557?lang=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were even dedicated salt-duty officers, who were granted the title ''tuz emini''.

Tuz resmi was usually arranged through the [[muqata'ah]] system; the government would grant a salt-producing resource to a contractor or tax-farmer, who would then be obliged to return a proportion of salt production (or the cash equivalent) to government coffers. There was usually a separate [[muqata'ah]] for each salt-mine. During the [[Tanzimat]] reforms, the Ottoman government took over complete control of salt production, and prices were fixed; in 1879, the salt industry was given to bankers as collateral against government borrowing, and then in 1881 it was made part of the [[Regie Company]] which gave all salt revenues to the Public Debt Commission - in an attempt to help pay off the Ottoman government's foreign debts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Stanford|title=The Nineteenth-Century Ottoman Tax Reforms and Revenue System|journal=[[International Journal of Middle East Studies]]|date=October 1975|volume=6|issue=4|pages=421–459|jstor=162752|doi=10.1017/s0020743800025368}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the face of this government control of salt production (and of salt prices), smuggling became a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Narin|first=Resül|title=Düyûn-ı Umûmiye İdaresi ve Adapazarı|journal=Karadeniz Araştırmaları|year=2009|volume=6|issue=21|pages=49–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later 19th century, government revenue from tuz resmi was typically 70-80 million kurus per year; by 1912 revenue had risen to 130,476,788 kurus - much higher than other tariffs such as the [[muskirat resmi]] (spirits tax) or the [[damga resmi]] (stamp duty), although taxes on land and crops continued to return more revenue.

The '''''UCLA Journal of Environmental Law and Policy''''' is a student-run [[law review]] published at the [[University of California, Los Angeles, School of Law]]. The journal primarily publishes articles and comments discussing [[environmental law|environmental law and policy]] and related subjects.&lt;ref name = JELP&gt;{{smallcaps|UCLA Law}}, [http://journals.law.ucla.edu/jelp/Pages/default.aspx/ Journal of Environmental Law and Policy] (Accessed July 3, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The journal was established in 1980 with the goal of confronting "those environmental problems which are currently before the public, and to provide a variety of opinions and suggested solutions to the problems."&lt;ref&gt;Marcy S. Rosenblum, ''Editor's Page'', 1 {{smallcaps|UCLA J. Envtl. L &amp; Pol'y}} vi (1980-1981).&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1980 and 1982, each issue of the journal would include a collection of articles focused on a single topic or theme.&lt;ref name = Stockton&gt;Wendy Stockton &amp; Roger L. Kohn, ''Forward'', 3 {{smallcaps|UCLA J. Envtl. L. &amp; Pol'y}} vii (1982-1983).&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with the third volume in the fall of 1982, the journal began including articles on a range of different topics in each individual issue.&lt;ref name = Stockton/&gt; The journal also collaborates with the [[UCLA School of Law#Center on Climate Change and The Environment|Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment]] to host environmental law symposia.&lt;ref name = JELP/&gt;

==Impact==
In 2016, [[Washington and Lee University]]'s Law Journal Rankings placed the journal among the top ten environmental, natural resources, and land use law journals with the highest [[impact factor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawlib.wlu.edu/LJ/index.aspx "Law Journals: Submission and Ranking, 2008-2015,"] Washington &amp; Lee University (Accessed: September 25, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Articles in the journal have been cited by several [[state supreme courts]] as well as the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]].&lt;ref&gt;''Rose Acre Farms, Inc. v. United States'', 559 F.3d 1260 (Fed. Cir. 2009); ''Dunn v. City of Milwaukie'', 355 Ore. 339 (2014); ''Kennedy v. Upper Milford Twp. Zoning Hearing Bd.'', 575 Pa. 105 (2003); ''Maddocks v. Giles'', 1999 ME 63 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Articles also appear in treatises written by ''[[American Law Reports]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Federal requirements for public participation in adoption, submission, and approval of state implementation plans and revisions pursuant to § 110 of Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C.A. § 7410)'', 151 {{smallcaps|A.L.R.

On 21 September 1986, Ian Wood shot and killed his [[mistress (lover)|mistress]] Danielle Ledez and her daughter Stephanie (aged 3) and severely injured Christopher (aged 5), Ledez's elder child, at [[Ughill#Ughill Hall|Ughill Hall]] in [[Bradfield, South Yorkshire|Bradfield]] near [[Sheffield]], United Kingdom.  Wood left his [[Enfield No. 2|.38 Enfield revolver]] in the kitchen and called the police before fleeing the scene. He went on the run for over a week, making several telephone calls to journalists and family members. Eight days later he threatened to [[Jumper (person)|jump off]] the [[Amiens Cathedral]] in France but was talked down by the police after seven hours. He was then extradited back to Sheffield for trial.

On 30 July 1987, Wood was convicted on two counts of murder, one of attempted murder and one of theft, after a week-long trial. He had pleaded not guilty to the murder of Danielle, instead submitting a manslaughter plea claiming he killed her to complete a [[suicide pact]]. An appeal against the guilty verdict was filed a month later and rejected in 1989. The case impacted upon [[Firearms policy in the United Kingdom|British firearms policy]], especially the manner in which regional police forces communicate over firearm ownership.

==Background==
Ian Wood (born 1949) began renting Ughill Hall, an 18-room mansion on the outskirts of Bradfield, with his mistress Danielle Ledez in April 1986 after leaving his wife Margaret and his three children.&lt;ref name="24sep86-guardian-1" /&gt; Wood was a solicitor and the ex secretary of the [[Law Society]] in Sheffield.&lt;ref name="23sep86-times-1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vaw"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hanmer|first1=Jalna|last2=Saunders|first2=Sheila|title=Women, violence and crime prevention: a West Yorkshire study|date=1993|page=43|publisher=Avery|isbn=9781856282376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Danielle Ledez (1948-1986) was a French teacher from [[Amiens]], France, who moved to Ughill Hall with Wood and her two children whilst in the process of divorcing her second husband (and father of the children) Colin Lloyd, a teacher from Sheffield.&lt;ref name="24sep86-guardian-1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="glasgowherald-25sep86-1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Churchman in plea to missing solicitor|work=The Glasgow Herald|date=25 September 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At approximately 12 midnight on 21 September 1986, Wood went to the playroom in the mansion and killed his mistress Danielle Ledez by shooting her once in the head.&lt;ref name="22jul87-indy-1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scotlawjournal"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Journal of the Law Society of Scotland|date=1987|publisher=The Society|page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ledez was 10 weeks pregnant by Wood.&lt;ref name="26sep86-times-1"&gt;{{cite news |title= Fugitive talks to journalist |url= http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=somelib&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;docId=IF503073269&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0 |page=2 |subscription= yes |work= The Times |date= 26 September 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="22jul87-indy-1" /&gt;  Wood then proceeded to play [[hide-and-seek]] with Ledez's daughter Stephanie (aged 3), after which he led her into Christopher's bedroom and shot her twice in the head, killing her instantly.&lt;ref name="23jul87-times-1"&gt;{{cite news |title= Solicitor said his mistress 'urged him to murder her' |url= http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=somelib&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;docId=IF500493761&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0 |last=Smith|first=Ian|page=5|subscription=yes|work=The Times|date=23 July 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="22jul87-indy-1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Solicitor 'agreed suicide pact'|work=The Independent|date=22 July 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then took Ledez's son Christopher (aged 5) into the bathroom and told him to close his eyes as he had a surprise for him, then shot him twice in the head.

==Manhunt==
===Initial response===
Following the discovery of the bodies, the police appealed to Wood to turn himself in and warned members of the public not to approach him as he may be armed.&lt;ref name="23sep86-guardian-1"&gt;{{cite news |title= Ian Wood wanted for Ledez murders |last=Perera |first=Shyama |url= https://www.newspapers.com/image/260269379|page=1|via= Newspapers.com |subscription=yes |work= The Guardian |date= 23 September 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="23sep86-times-1"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=somelib&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;docId=IF503071822&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0 |title= Plea to solicitor after two gunshot deaths |last= Smith |first=Ian |page=1 |work= The Times |date=23 September 1986 |subscription= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wood's wife Margaret and their three children were put under police protection immediately, as was Ledez's husband Colin Lloyd.&lt;ref name="23sep86-guardian-1" /&gt;  A total of five homes in England were put under protection throughout the manhunt.&lt;ref name="25sep86-times-1"&gt;{{cite news |title= Solicitor sought by Interpol |url= http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=somelib&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;docId=IF503072752&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0 |last=Smith |first=Ian |page=1 |subscription=yes |work= The Times |date= 25 September 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A formal arrest warrant was issued on 23 September 1986 with more details on Wood's flight, including the numberplate of the car he fled in.&lt;ref name="23sep86-guardian-1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="24sep86-times-1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Warrant is issued for solicitor |url= http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=somelib&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;docId=IF503072228&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0 |page=1 |subscription= yes |work= The Times |date= 24 September 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phone calls===
On 23 September 1986, a police press conference was interrupted when Wood made a series of telephone calls to Brenda Tunney, a reporter for the local newspaper ''[[Sheffield Weekly Gazette]]''.&lt;ref name="bufvc"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Allerenshaw|first1=Bill|last2=Tunney|first2=Brenda|date=31 July 1987|title=Ian Wood begins murder sentence|url=http://bufvc.ac.uk/tvandradio/lbc/index.php/segment/0009800174001|website=British Universities Film and Video Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="24sep86-guardian-1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ian Wood alleged to have shot his mistress and her children|work=The Guardian|date=24 September 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wood refused to disclose his location but claimed the purpose of the calls was to "put his side".&lt;ref name="24sep86-guardian-1" /&gt;

Wood made no further telephone calls to either the police or journalists for nearly 48 hours after the initial series of calls.&lt;ref name="26sep86-guardian-1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Solicitor breaks silence |url= https://www.newspapers.com/image/260270466/?terms=Solicitor%2Bbreaks%2Bsilence |last= Parkin |first=Michael |via= Newspapers.com |subscription= yes |page=2 |work= The Guardian |date= 26 September 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 26 September he had made at least eight phone calls.&lt;ref name="28-sep-86-st1"&gt;{{cite news |title= New phone clue in murder hunt |work= The Sunday Times |date= 28 September 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 September, Wood called Tunney four times asking about funeral arrangements for Ledez and her daughter.&lt;ref name="28-sep-86-st1" /&gt;  The police discussed the [[wikt:state of mind|mental state]] of Wood with a consultant psychiatrist on the same day due to the firearm confiscations and the phone calls.&lt;ref name="27-sep-86-guard-1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Psychiatrist advises murder inquiry |url= https://www.newspapers.com/image/260270742/ |last= Parkin |first= Michael |via= Newspapers.com |subscription= yes |page=2 |work= The Guardian |date= 27 September 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, Wood made three more calls to Tunney and threatened suicide in one of them; he claimed he killed because of "love and desperation, not anger and hate".&lt;ref name="29sept86-guardian-1"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.newspapers.com/image/260271020/ |title= I'll kill myself, says wanted solicitor |last=Keel |first= Paul |via= Newspapers.com |subscription= yes |page=1 |work= The Guardian |date= 29 September 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mammoth" /&gt;

===Potential whereabouts===
On 25 September, a receptionist at the [[The Automobile Association|Automobile Association]] office in [[Barnstaple]] reported that a man matching Wood's description had requested an international driving licence.&lt;ref name="26sep86-guardian-1" /&gt; [[Interpol]] were notified of the case on the same day, after which French police interviewed Ledez's parents.&lt;ref name="25sep86-times-1" /&gt; Up until this point, Wood, who owned no other properties, was believed by police to still be in the [[Yorkshire]] area.&lt;ref name="28-sep-86-st1" /&gt; After Wood's capture, British and French authorities were "puzzled" by the ease with which Wood travelled under his own name.&lt;ref name="30sep-86-guardian-1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="1-oct-86-guardian-1" /&gt; At his trial, it was established that Wood had gone to a pub after committing the killings and then, over the course of the next few days, travelled to [[Dover]] where he caught a ferry to France.&lt;ref name="31jul87-indy-1"&gt;{{cite news |title= Solicitor gets life as jury rejects suicide pact claim |work= The Independent |date= 31 July 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surrender===
[[File:Ian Wood on gargoyle 1986.png|thumb|Ian Wood on the gargoyle at Amiens Cathedral]]
On 29 September, Wood joined a public tour of [[Amiens Cathedral]], approximately {{convert|3|mi}} away from Ledez's birthplace, but broke away from the tour group at about 12 noon, climbed over the parapet, and clung to a gargoyle about {{convert|200|ft}} above the ground, threatening to commit suicide by [[Jumper (person)|jumping off]].&lt;ref name="mammoth"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Odell|first1=Robin|last2=Donnelley|first2=Paul|title=The Mammoth Book of More Bizarre Crimes|date=4 February 2016|publisher=Hachette UK|isbn=9781472118042|pages=212–213}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="upi"&gt;{{cite news|title=Foreign News Briefs|work=United Press International|date=29 September 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="30-sep-86-times-1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hunt for solicitor ends in Amiens|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=somelib&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;docId=IF503074571&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0|work=The Times|last1=McCarthy|first1=Michael|last2=Geddes|first2=Diana|page=1|subscription=yes|date=30 September 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left a note with a member of staff at the cathedral shortly beforehand informing them of his intention to commit suicide, which prompted them to call the police.&lt;ref name="30-sep-86-times-1" /&gt; 

The police, firemen, the church's priest, and members from the British Consulate pleaded with Wood for seven hours, at which point Wood surrendered.&lt;ref name="30-sep-86-times-1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="30sep-86-guardian-1"&gt;{{cite news |title= Solicitor gives in after 7 hours on cathedral |url= https://www.newspapers.com/image/260271321/ |last= Page |first= Campbell |via= Newspapers.com |pages=1, 36 |subscription= yes |work= The Guardian |date= 30 September 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A crowd of several hundred people had gathered to watch from below.&lt;ref name="30-sept-86-ap-1" /&gt; Wood later claimed that he did not wish his family to see his fall on television, describing the scene as "a circus".&lt;ref name="circus"&gt;{{cite news |title= Suicide bid 'just like a circus' |url= http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=somelib&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;docId=IF503075011&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0 |page=1 |subscription= yes |work= The Times |date=1 October 1986 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wood had telephoned Ledez's family to inform them of his intention to commit suicide.&lt;ref name="30sep-86-guardian-1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="talked down"&gt;{{cite news |title= Talked down |work= The Independent |date= 30 September 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trial===
[[File:Sheffield OldTownHall east.jpg |thumb |Sheffield Old Town Hall, the venue for Wood's trial]]

====Pleas and charges====
On 1 December 1986, the prosecution charged Wood on two counts of murder and one count of attempted murder, for Danielle, Stephanie, and Christopher, respectively.&lt;ref name="31jul87-indy-1" /&gt; Wood also faced a [[specimen charge]] of stealing £84,000 from clients he represented in property deals,&lt;ref name="9dec86-times-1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Solicitor's committal date is set |url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=somelib&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;docId=IF503093896&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0 |page=7 |subscription= yes |date= 9 December 1986 |work= The Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="5aug87-guardian-1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Victims of solicitor get 230,000 pounds|date=5 August 1987|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the prosecution claimed the sum could have been £150,000.&lt;ref name="23jul87-times-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="22jul87-times-1"/&gt;

Wood pleaded not guilty to the murder of Danielle and instead entered a [[Manslaughter in English law|manslaughter]] plea on the grounds that they had agreed to a [[suicide pact]].&lt;ref name="22jul87-times-1" /&gt; The prosecution did not accept the manslaughter plea and pursued a trial for the murder of Danielle.&lt;ref name="22jul87-indy-1" /&gt; However, Wood pleaded guilty to the murder of Stephanie and the attempted murder of Christopher.&lt;ref name="23jul87-indy-1" /&gt; He also pleaded guilty to stealing [[pound sterling|£]]84,000 from clients.&lt;ref name="23jul87-times-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="22jul87-times-1"/&gt;

====Suicide pact claim====
The [[Homicide Act 1957]] states that if a person kills someone in pursuance of a suicide pact and then does not commit suicide themselves, they are guilty only of manslaughter and not murder.&lt;ref name="homicideact-1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Homicide Act, 1957|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1957/11/pdfs/ukpga_19570011_en.pdf|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pact-manslaughter"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rozenberg|first1=Joshua|title=When a suicide pact becomes a case of manslaughter|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1481236/When-a-suicide-pact-becomes-a-case-of-manslaughter.html|accessdate=28 October 2017|work=The Telegraph|date=15 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Geoffrey Rivlin, leading the prosecution, told the court that in such a situation the [[wikt:onus|onus]] is on the killer to prove that a suicide pact was made.&lt;ref name="30jul87-times-1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Solicitor 'killed out of his obsessive hatred, not love' |url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=somelib&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;docId=IF500495138&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0 |last=Smith |first=Ian |page=3 |subscription=yes |work=The Times|date=30 July 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood gave the court a detailed account of the five-point agreement he claimed to have made with Ledez as to what to do after the killings and before his suicide:&lt;ref name="22jul87-indy-1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="31jul87-indy-1" /&gt;
#Visit a French church and light candles for Ledez and her children.
#Send a detailed explanation of the deaths to the press.
#Kill Ledez's husband, Colin Lloyd.
#Ensure Ledez and her children were buried in a French village cemetery.
#Visit their graves and lay flowers for them.

Rivlin argued that Wood's story did "not have a ring of truth about it".&lt;ref name="22jul87-indy-1" /&gt; Several of Ledez's French friends who were interviewed by police claimed that Ledez had shown no signs of depression or suicidal intentions. In addition, her mother received a telephone call hours before Ledez died and she did not suspect her daughter was suicidal.&lt;ref name="23jul87-times-1" /&gt;

To support Wood's claim, the defence called Wood's mother, who said that Ledez had confided her suicidal intention to her on multiple occasions and that she feared that her husband Colin would physically harm her or Christopher.&lt;ref name="28jul87-times-1" /&gt; The witness also stated that Wood had called her within 24 hours of the shootings and explained the plan to her.&lt;ref name="28jul87-indy"&gt;{{cite news|title=Solicitor's lover 'had threatened suicide 10 times'|work=The Independent|date=28 July 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution called Alan Wales, Wood's doctor, who testified that he advised the police to confiscate Wood's gun collection after an appointment on 11 November 1985. Wales said that Wood appeared "distressed" and prescribed him with antidepressants.&lt;ref name="28jul87-times-1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mistress 'confided suicide intention' to Wood's mother|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=somelib&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;docId=IF503113578&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0 |last=Smith |first=Ian |page=3 |subscription=yes |work=The Times|date=28 July 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 July 1987, the final day of the trial, the prosecution argued that Wood's suicide threat on Amiens Cathedral was not genuine and was done only to disguise his true motive, with Rivlin summarising that Wood "killed out of his obsessive hatred, not love".&lt;ref name="30jul87-times-1" /&gt; Gilbert Gray, leading the defence, argued that Wood had nothing to gain from lying about a suicide pact because he would be sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder and attempted murder of Ledez's children anyway.&lt;ref name="30jul87-times-1" /&gt;

====Verdict and sentencing====
On 31 July 1987, the jury at [[Sheffield Old Town Hall|Sheffield Crown Court]] unanimously rejected Wood's claim that he killed Ledez as part of a suicide pact and found him guilty of murder.&lt;ref name="31jul87-indy-1" /&gt; Justice Taylor sentenced Wood to life imprisonment for each murder, 12 years for the attempted murder, and three years for the specimen charges of theft from clients.&lt;ref name="31jul87-indy-1" /&gt; Wood was struck off the Law Society register and the [[Law Society Compensation Fund]] paid out at least £240,000 in compensation to the theft victims.&lt;ref name="5aug87-guardian-1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian-online"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dyer|first1=Clare|title=Murderer is kept on roll of solicitors|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/may/25/claredyer|accessdate=28 October 2017|work=The Guardian|date=25 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 August 1987, Wood's solicitor filed an appeal against the guilty verdict.&lt;ref name="appeal lodged"&gt;{{cite news|title=Lawyer's plea against double life sentence |url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=somelib&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;docId=IF500496510&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0  |page=5 |subscription= yes |work=The Times|date=28 August 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The appeal was rejected on 25 July 1989.&lt;ref name="appeal denied"&gt;{{cite news|title=Solicitor loses appeal |url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=somelib&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;docId=IF500402025&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0 |page=4 |subscription= yes |work=The Times|date=25 July 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the trial, a dispute occurred between [[South Yorkshire Police]] and [[Sussex Police]] over which force was responsible for erroneously allowing Wood access to firearms.&lt;ref name="1aug87-times-1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Police clash on gun blame|work=The Guardian|date=1 August 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wood's ten-piece gun collection had been confiscated twice; firstly in December 1985 over fears from his wife and doctor of deteriorating mental health and alcoholism, and secondly because of an administrative error in renewing his licence.&lt;ref name="29sep86-times-1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Firearms given back |url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=somelib&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;docId=IF503074132&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0 |page=2 |subscription= yes |work=The Times|date=29 September 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; The guns were returned two weeks after the first confiscation.&lt;ref name="29sep86-times-1" /&gt; South Yorkshire Police later said that they had to return them because there was no evidence that Wood was a threat to himself or others.&lt;ref name="31jul87-guardian-1" /&gt; 

In March 1986, Wood bought 50 rounds of ammunition in Sheffield for his .38 Enfield revolver which he had inherited after his father used it to commit suicide.&lt;ref name="31jul87-times-1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Errors gave killer his gun |url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=somelib&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;docId=IF501722963&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0 |page=3 |subscription= yes |work= The Times |date= 31 July 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Yorkshire Police ascribed these events to an "administrative mix-up" with Sussex Police, who were responsible for executing the firearms clause in Wood's father's will.&lt;ref name="1aug87-times-1" /&gt; Sussex Police said that when Wood asked for the gun and the remaining 11 rounds they tried to dissuade him but he returned a month later with a renewed firearms certificate from South Yorkshire Police.&lt;ref name="31jul87-times-1" /&gt; The differing interpretations of the [[Firearms Act#United Kingdom|Firearms Act]] by the two police forces resulted in the [[Home Office]] intervening and seeking a detailed explanation from both forces and holding talks with them over possible amendments to the Firearms Act.&lt;ref name="1aug87-times-1" /&gt;

===Firearms policy===
[[Bill Michie]], the [[Member of parliament#United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland|Member of Parliament]] for [[Sheffield Heeley (UK Parliament constituency)|Sheffield Heeley]], campaigned for stricter [[Firearms policy in the United Kingdom|firearm ownership]] regulations, such as [[psychiatric assessment]] of prospective gun owners, in response to the murders.&lt;ref name="31jul87-guardian-1"&gt;{{cite news|title='Change gun law' call as lawyer is gaoled|work=The Guardian|date=31 July 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian-09aug87-1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Changes sought in British gun law|work=The Guardian|date=9 August 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1986, Michie asked [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] if the government would change its firearms policy in response to the murders, to which she responded: "The Home Office ... will keep that matter under permanent review".&lt;ref name="hansard-1"&gt;{{cite hansard|jurisdiction=United Kingdom|title=Engagements|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1986/oct/28/engagements#column_162|house=House of Commons|date=28 October 1986|column=162|speaker=|position=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Less than a month after Wood's conviction, the [[Hungerford massacre]] took place, in which Michael Robert Ryan killed 16 people. This prompted [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] to pass the [[Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988]], which banned civilian ownership of nearly all [[Semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic weapons]].&lt;ref name="firearms-amendment-1"&gt;{{cite web |title= Firearms (Amendment) Act, 1997 |url= https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1997/5/pdfs/ukpga_19970005_en.pdf |website= www.legislation.gov.uk |publisher= Her Majesty's Stationery Office |accessdate= 28 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Washington Park Subdivision map.gif|thumb|250px|Washington Park Subdivision is south of [[Washington Park, Chicago (park)|Washington Park]]. ([[Chicago Park District]] - green, [[University of Chicago]] - lavender)]]
The '''Washington Park Subdivision''' is the name of the historic 3-[[city block]] by 8-city block subdivision in the northwest corner of the [[Woodlawn, Chicago|Woodlawn]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]], on the [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side]] of [[Chicago]] in [[Illinois]] that stands in the place of the original [[Washington Park, Chicago (race track)|Washington Park Race Track]].  The area evolved as a redevelopment of the land previously occupied by the racetrack.  It was originally an exclusively white neighborhood that included residential housing, amusement parks, and [[beer garden]]s.

During the late 1920s and 1930s, the area became the subject of discriminatory twenty-year covenants, which were determined to be invalid by the [[United States Supreme Court]], when challenged in a seminal case brought by [[Carl Hansberry]].  The case is a vital part of legal studies and considered an important part of a broad class of histories.  The play ''[[Raisin in the Sun]]'' is based on [[Lorraine Hansberry]]'s struggles in this neighborhood.

==Location==
Due to the non-rectangular shape of the [[Washington Park, Chicago (neighborhood)|Washington Park]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]], the original [[Washington Park, Chicago (race track)|Washington Park Race Track]] actually occupied the Southern two-thirds of the Washington Park Subdivision, which is an 8-city block by 3-city block area in northwest corner of the [[Woodlawn, Chicago|Woodlawn]] community area and bounded by Dr. Martin Luther King Drive to the west, South Cottage Grove Avenue to the East, East 60th Street to the North and East 63rd Street to the South. This is the area directly south of [[Washington Park, Chicago (park)|Washington Park]] and both south and east of the Washington Park community area. It would be part of the Washington Park community area if the community area were to complete its logical proper rectangle.&lt;ref name=WPS/&gt;

==Historical significance==
Between 1884 and 1905, the race track occupied part of the area now known as Washington Park Subdivision.&lt;ref name=WPS/&gt;  After the city outlawed gambling, the area was redeveloped as a residential housing subdivision with neighboring commercial recreation such as the [[White City (Chicago)|White City amusement park]] that flourished until the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name=WPS/&gt;  The neighborhood also included a beer garden that was remodeled by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]].&lt;ref name=WPS/&gt;&lt;ref name=W/&gt;

Between 1900 and 1934, the [[African American]] population in Chicago grew from 30,000 to 236,000.  In this time, [[Demographics of Chicago|Chicago's demographics]] changed so that instead of having this population diluted in scattered places, it was concentrated in two large strips of land.  The concentration was enforced by violence at first, but  restrictive covenants became the preferred way to enforce [[Racial segregation|segregation]] after a few decades.&lt;ref name=THBHvL/&gt;

When necessary, community organizations used violence to pursue their segregationist purposes, and between 1917 and 1921, bomb use discouraged encroachment into majority white neighborhoods.  The bombs were used at the residences of African Americans as well as the properties of real estate agents and bankers.&lt;ref name=PTI&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vPLEXRfnzJAC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;dq=%22Washington+Park+Court%22|title=Packing Them In: An Archaeology of Environmental Racism in Chicago, 1865&amp;ndash;1954|chapter=Planning and Environmental Inequality|accessdate=January 3, 2009|year=2005|publisher=Lexington Books|author=Washington, Sylvia Hood|isbn=0-7391-1029-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1919, African American banking magnate [[Jesse Binga]], the owner of the first Chicago bank to be operated by African Americans, and the first African American who lived in the Washington Park Subdivision,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://negroartist.com/JESSE%20BINGA/index.html|title=Jesse Binga|accessdate=January 23, 2009|publisher=negroartist.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; endured five bombings of his home by angry whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb1453/is_/ai_n29146315|title=Pinkster in Chicago: Bud Billiken and the Mayor of Bronzeville, 1930&amp;ndash;1945|accessdate=January 1, 2009|journal=The Journal of African American History|author1=Rutkoff, Peter M.  |author2=William B.

Although they were previously rare, racially restrictive [[Covenant (law)|covenants]] among property owners that outlawed the purchase, lease, or occupation of their properties by African Americans became common in Chicago in the 1920s, following the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]].&lt;ref name=RC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1067.html|title=Restrictive Covenants|accessdate=December 31, 2008|year=2005|publisher=[[Chicago Historical Society]]|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|author=Hirsch, Arnold R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Local businessmen and the [[University of Chicago]] became alarmed at the prospect of poorer African Americans moving from the Black Belt due to a combination of racial succession and economic decline.&lt;ref name=W/&gt; In 1926, the United States Supreme Court upheld racially restrictive covenants in Corrigan v. Buckley ({{ussc|271|323|1926}}).&lt;ref name=THBHvL/&gt; In 1927, the Chicago Real Estate Board (CREB) sent representatives throughout the city to promote such covenants, which it viewed as a progressive alternative to violence. The board representatives provided model contracts drafted by the [[Chicago Plan Commission]] as part of their efforts. By 1928, the ''[[Hyde Park Herald]]'' reported that the covenants prevailed throughout the [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side]],&lt;ref name=RC/&gt; and 95% of the homes in the subdivision were covenanted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://archives.nd.edu/findaids/html/etext/alleycon.htm|title=An Alley in Chicago: The Ministry of a City Priest (paperback as An Alley in Chicago: The Life and Legacy of Monsignor John Egan)|chapter=Jack Was Starting Everybody's Fire|author=Frisbie, Margery|isbn=978-1-58051-121-6|publisher=Sheed &amp; Ward|year=1991 (Paperback, 2002)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BM&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HR3d18hfm-8C&amp;pg=PA184&amp;lpg=PA184&amp;dq=%22Washington+Park%22+subdivision+Chicago|title=Black Metropolis|author=[[St. Clair Drake|Drake, St. Clair]] and [[Horace R. Cayton, Jr.|Horace Roscoe Cayton]]|pages=184|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|isbn=978-0-226-16234-8|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most African American neighborhoods were bounded by covenanted areas since 85% of Chicago was covenanted.&lt;ref name=THBHvL/&gt;

==Legal issues==
Between 1928 and 1940, the subdivision was a legal battleground.  In 1928, [[landlords]] in the subdivision signed the covenants in which they agreed that they would not rent to non-whites.  The language of the covenants state that no properties in the subdivision "...shall be sold, given, conveyed or leased to any negro or negroes, and no permission or license to use or occupy any part thereof shall be given to any negro except house servants or janitors or chauffeurs employed thereon..."&lt;ref name=RRCotWPSitCoC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.public.asu.edu/~wplotkin/DeedsWeb/covenant.html|title=Racial Restrictive Covenant of the Washington Park Subdivision in the City of Chicago|accessdate=January 1, 2009|date=September 1, 2003|publisher=[[Arizona State University]]|author=Plotkin, Wendy |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070210063636/http://www.public.asu.edu/~wplotkin/DeedsWeb/covenant.html |archivedate = February 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The covenants were signed by "owners of land on the one or the other side of Evans, Langley, Champlain, St. Lawrence, Rhodes, Eberhart, Vernon and South Park Avenues, between 60th and 63rd Streets and on 60th, 61st and 62nd Streets between South Park and Cottage Grove Avenues" on September 30, 1927, and they were recorded at the Cook County Register of Deeds on February 1, 1928. They were intended to be valid and in force until January 1, 1948.&lt;ref name=RRCotWPSitCoC/&gt;

The [[Great Depression]] decreased white demand for the subdivision's properties.  A few well-off African Americans convinced some owners to sell properties to them. The most famous case was that of Dr. James L. Hall, who rented a property located at 419 E. 60th St. from the white Issac Kleiman.&lt;ref name="Chicago Defender"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.public.asu.edu/~wplotkin/DeedsWeb/gentzel.html|title=Judge Gentzel Upholds Jim Crow Plot; To Appeal Woodlawn Property Owners Show Colors in Tilt Against Race|work=Chicago Defender|author=staff|date=August 5, 1933|accessdate=January 2, 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070210063446/http://www.public.asu.edu/~wplotkin/DeedsWeb/gentzel.html |archivedate = February 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, Olive Ida Burke (the wife of Mr. Burke&amp;mdash;a future defendant in the famous [[Hansberry v. Lee]] case)&lt;ref name=THBHvL/&gt; sued Kleiman in the case now known as ''Burke v. Kleiman''.&lt;ref name=THBHvL/&gt; The circuit court granted an injunction in favor of the plaintiffs, which was upheld on appeal by the [[Supreme Court of Illinois]].&lt;ref name=Burke&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.public.asu.edu/~wplotkin/DeedsWeb/burke.html|title=Burke v. Kleiman Decree (Partial), August 3, 1933|accessdate=January 2, 2009|publisher=Wendy Plotkin |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070210063056/http://www.public.asu.edu/~wplotkin/DeedsWeb/burke.html |archivedate = February 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plaintiffs stipulated that as of 1928 more than 95% of the property owners signed the covenant. This stipulation was later proved false&amp;mdash;only 54% had actually signed.&lt;ref name=THBHvL/&gt;

In 1937, Carl Hansberry purchased a property from James Joseph Burke located at 6140 South Rhodes. Anna M. Lee, and other promoters of the covenants, sued to prevent Hansberry's family from living in the neighborhood.&lt;ref name=injunction&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.public.asu.edu/~wplotkin/DeedsWeb/cc.html|title=State of Illinois &amp;mdash; County of Cook In the Circuit Court of Cook County Anna M. Lee, et al. vs. Paul A. Hansberry,et al. Gen. No. 37C 6804 Complaint in Equity Complaint to Enforce Restrictive Agreement Injunction and Other Relief|publisher=Wendy Plotkin|accessdate=January 2, 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070210062826/http://www.public.asu.edu/~wplotkin/DeedsWeb/cc.html |archivedate = February 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This led to the [[Hansberry v. Lee]], {{ussc|311|32|1940}} case. Defendants argued that the stipulation made previously in Burke v. Kleiman that more than 95% of the owners had signed the covenant was false and the case should be reajudicated.&lt;ref name=THBHvL/&gt; Plaintiffs, while admitting to the fact, contended that the principle of ''[[res judicata]]'' barred courts from rehearing the old arguments.&lt;ref name=THBHvL/&gt; The Illinois courts ruled in favor of plaintiffs. However the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] decided to represent the buyer in the [[United States Supreme Court]]. The case caught the attention of national real estate magazines and African American newspapers.&lt;ref name=BM/&gt; The [[U. S. Supreme Court]] eventually reversed that ruling stating the application of ''res judicata'' in this case would violate [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].&lt;ref name=THBHvL/&gt;   The play ''[[Raisin in the Sun]]'' was inspired by [[Lorraine Hansberry]]'s time in the neighborhood after her father won the repeal of restrictive covenants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/programs/morning/features/patc/raisin/|title=A Raisin in the Sun  |accessdate=February 16, 2009|date=March 11, 2002|publisher=[[NPR]].org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The result of ''Hansberry v. Lee'' led to racial succession. White tenants were often [[eviction|evicted]] to make way for higher-paying African American renters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=px0PuO7GWhsC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;dq=%22Washington+Park%22+subdivision+Chicago|title=Making the Second Ghetto: Race and Housing in Chicago 1940&amp;ndash;1960|chapter=The Second Ghetto and the dynamics of neighborhood change|author=Hirsch, Arnold R.|authorlink=Arnold R.

While the purchase case proceeded, some landlords subdivided properties and rented them to blacks at a premium. Some realtors began encouraging white families to move out so that they could rent properties to  African Americans.  Smaller property owners were pressed to sell to realtors or directly to African Americans because the neighborhood was undergoing a racial transformation.&lt;ref name=BM/&gt;  The conditions of this neighborhood are described in a section of ''[[Black Metropolis]]'' by [[St. Clair Drake]] and [[Horace R. Cayton, Jr.|Horace Roscoe Cayton]].&lt;ref name=BM/&gt;

The Supreme Court ruling and several similar rulings led to the racial transformation of the [[Woodlawn, Chicago|Woodlawn]] and [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]]s.  Political futures were determined by positions taken on this issue.  Future five-term [[Mayor of Chicago]] [[Richard J. Daley]] ran for Cook County Sheriff in 1946 as a progressive anti-covenant candidate.&lt;ref name=RC/&gt;  Eventually, in [[Shelley v. Kraemer]], {{ussc|334|1|1948}}, which was argued by [[Thurgood Marshall]], the U. S. Supreme Court declared restrictive covenants in general unenforceable.&lt;ref name=RC/&gt;
