== History ==
AIMMS B.V. was founded in 1989 by noted mathematician Johannes Bisschop under the name of Paragon Decision Technology. His vision was to make optimization more approachable by building models rather than programming. In Bisschop’s view, modeling was able to build the bridge between the people who had problems and the people helping them solve those problems. 

'''AIMMS''' (an acronym for "'''Advanced Interactive Multidimensional Modeling System'''") began as a software system designed for modeling and solving large-scale optimization and scheduling-type problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;  

AIMMS is considered to be one of the five most important algebraic modeling languages and the creator (Johannes J. Bisschop) has been awarded with [[INFORMS]] Impact Prize for his work in this language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.informs.org/Blogs/E-News-Blog/INFORMS-Impact-Prize |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-10-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022091250/https://www.informs.org/Blogs/E-News-Blog/INFORMS-Impact-Prize |archive-date=2013-10-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, AIMMS was acquired by a small private equity firm who saw the potential value of mathematics to business. This led to the creation of a partnership program, further technical investment and the evolution of the platform. In 2011, the company launched AIMMS PRO, a way to deploy applications to end-users who don't have a technical background. This was quickly followed by the ability to publish and customize applications using a browser so that decision support applications are available on any device. These innovations led to rapid customer adoption and growth for the company. In 2017, AIMMS was recognized as a top B2B technology in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.g2crowd.com/blog/technology-research/b2b-netherlands-tech-2017/|title=The State of the Netherland's B2B Tech Scene in 2017|date=2017-12-14|work=G2 Crowd|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was named one of the fastest growing companies in the Netherlands for the second consecutive year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://aimms.com/english/news-archive/aimms-named-one-fastest-companies-netherlands-second-consecutive-year/|title=AIMMS :: AIMMS named one of the fastest growing companies in the Netherlands for the second consecutive year|website=AIMMS|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== AIMMS SC Navigator Platform ==
In 2017, the product management team did a listening tour with supply chain executives. This, along with the growing interest in embedded advanced analytics for supply chain management, generated the initial idea for the AIMMS SC Navigator Platform and the democratization of supply chain analytics. SC Navigator consists of ready-made applications that are easily configurable to put supply chain analytics in the hands of supply chain professionals. 

AIMMS SC Navigator launched in October, 2017 with three initial cloud-based Apps: Supply Chain Network Design, Sales &amp; Operations Planning and Data Navigator. In 2018 two additional applications were rolled out - Center of Gravity and Product Lifecycle. Additional applications are rolling out every quarter.

==AIMMS Prescriptive Analytics Platform==

The AIMMS Prescriptive Analytics Platform consists of an [[algebraic modeling language]], an [[integrated development environment]] for both editing models and creating a [[graphical user interface]] around these models, and a graphical end-user environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.aimms.com/aimms/download/manuals/aimms_user.pdf|title=AIMMS User's Guide|last=Roelofs|first=Marcel|publisher=lulu.com|year=2010|isbn=978-0-557-06360-4}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
AIMMS is linked to multiple [[solver]]s through the AIMMS Open Solver Interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://download.aimms.com/aimms/AimmsOSI/frames.html?frmname=topic&amp;frmfile=index.html|title=AIMMS Open Solver Interface API|author=Paragon Decision Technology|year=2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Supported solvers include [[CPLEX]], [[MOSEK]], [[FICO Xpress]], CBC, Conopt, [[MINOS (optimization software)|MINOS]], [[IPOPT]], [[SNOPT]], [[KNITRO]] and [http://www.ilog.com/products/cpoptimizer/ CP Optimizer].

AIMMS features a mixture of [[declarative programming|declarative]] and [[imperative programming|imperative]] programming styles. Formulation of optimization models takes place through declarative language elements such as sets and indices, as well as scalar and multidimensional parameters, variables and constraints, which are common to all [[algebraic modeling language]]s, and allow for a concise description of most problems in the domain of mathematical optimization. [[Units of measurement]] are natively supported in the language, and compile- and runtime unit analysis may be employed to detect modeling errors.

Procedures and [[control flow]] statements are available in AIMMS for 
* the exchange of data with external data sources such as [[spreadsheet]]s, [[database]]s, [[XML]] and text files
* data pre- and post-processing tasks around optimization models
* user interface event handling
* the construction of hybrid algorithms for problem types for which no direct efficient solvers are available. 
To support the re-use of common modeling components, AIMMS allows modelers to organize their model in user model [[library (computing)|libraries]].

AIMMS supports a wide range of mathematical optimization problem types:
* [[Linear programming]]
* [[Quadratic programming]]
* [[Nonlinear programming]]
* [[Linear programming#Integer unknowns|Mixed-integer programming]]
* Mixed-integer nonlinear programming
* [[Global optimization]]
* [[Complementarity theory|Complementarity problems]] (MPECs)
* [[Stochastic programming]]
* [[Robust optimization]]
* [[Constraint programming]]
[[Uncertainty]] can be taken into account in [[deterministic system|deterministic]] linear and mixed integer optimization models in AIMMS through the specification of additional attributes, such that [[stochastic programming|stochastic]] or [[robust optimization|robust]] optimization techniques can be applied alongside the existing deterministic solution techniques.

Custom hybrid and decomposition algorithms can be constructed using the GMP system library which makes available at the modeling level many of the basic building blocks used internally by the higher level solution methods present in AIMMS, matrix modification methods, as well as specialized steps for customizing solution algorithms for specific problem types.

Optimization solutions created with AIMMS can be used either as a standalone [[desktop application]] or can be embedded as a [[software component]] in other applications.

==Use in industry==

AIMMS Prescriptive Analytics Platform is used in a wide range of industries including retail, consumer products, healthcare, oil and chemicals, steel production and agribusiness.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1322">An '''appeal to advantage''' is a [[rhetoric]]al device in which the speaker encourages his or her audience to perform some action by representing that action as being in the audience's best interest.

An appeal to advantage can also be a request from someone in a position of power to someone who is in a socially [[subordinate]] position; the request is specifically for the subordinate to perform an act contrary to the subordinate's wishes, such that the subordinate is forced to commit the act in order to satisfy a more significant need.  The appeal is specifically most expedient or advantageous to the person in power, but is also presented as forwarding the subordinate's interests in some significant way.

== Examples ==
* A client offers a government official a big amount of money, provided the official facilitates or gives a favorable decision on some transactions in which the client has some interest.
* A rich man offers to pay the hospital bills for a beautiful young girl's sick mother, provided that the girl chooses to become his mistress.
* A religious political leader offers a person a job, provided that the person joins his religion and accepts his beliefs.

'''Argument from ignorance''' (from {{lang-la|'''argumentum ad ignorantiam'''}}), also known as '''appeal to ignorance''' (in which ''ignorance'' represents "a lack of contrary evidence") is a [[informal fallacy|fallacy in informal logic]]. It asserts that a proposition is true because it has not yet been proven false or a proposition is false because it has not yet been proven true.  This represents a type of [[false dichotomy]] in that it excludes a third option, which is that there may have been an insufficient investigation, and therefore there is insufficient information to prove the proposition be either true or false.  Nor does it allow the admission that the choices may in fact not be two (true or false), but may be as many as four,
# true
# false
# unknown between true or false
#being unknowable (among the first three).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Argumentum ad Ignorantiam|url= http://philosophy.lander.edu/logic/ignorance.html|work= Philosophy 103: Introduction to Logic|publisher= [[Lander University]]|year= 2004|accessdate= 2009-04-29| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090430170946/http://philosophy.lander.edu/logic/ignorance.html| archivedate= 30 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In debates, appeals to ignorance are sometimes used in an attempt to shift the [[Philosophic burden of proof|burden of proof]].

== Overview ==
{{essay|section|date=April 2018}}
===Basic argument===
As described in Schreuder's ''Vision and Visual Perception'':&lt;ref name="Schreuder2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Duco A. Schreuder|title=Vision and Visual Perception|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I7a7BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA103|date=3 December 2014|publisher=Archway Publishing|isbn=978-1-4808-1294-9|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|text=Arguments that appeal to ignorance rely ''merely'' on the fact that the veracity of the proposition is not disproved to arrive at a definite conclusion. These arguments fail to appreciate that the limits of one's understanding or certainty do not change what is true.  They do not ''inform'' upon reality.  That is, whatever the reality is, it does not "wait" upon human logic or analysis to be formulated.  Reality exists at all times, and it exists ''independently'' of what is in the mind of anyone. And the true thrust of science and rational analysis is to separate preconceived notion(s) of what reality is, and to be open at all times to the observation of nature as it behaves, so as truly to ''discover'' reality. This fallacy can be very convincing and is considered by some to be a special case of a ''false dilemma'' or ''false dichotomy'' in that they both fail to consider alternatives. A false dilemma may take the form:
* If a proposition has not been disproved, then it cannot be considered false and must therefore be considered true.
* If a proposition has not been proven, then it cannot be considered true and must therefore be considered false.

Such arguments attempt to exploit the facts that (a) true things can never be disproved and (b) false things can never be proved. In other words, appeals to ignorance claim that the converse of these facts are also true. Therein lies the fallacy.|multiline=y|author=Duco A. Schreuder|title=''Vision and Visual Perception''}}

To reiterate, these arguments ignore the fact, and difficulty, that some true things may never be proved, and some false things may never be disproved with absolute [[certainty]].
The phrase "''the absence of evidence is not the [[evidence of absence]]''" can be used as a shorthand rebuttal to the second form of the ignorance fallacy (i.e. ''P has never been absolutely proved and is therefore certainly false''). Most often it is directed at any conclusion derived from ''[[Null result|null]]'' results in an experiment or from the non-detection of something. In other words, where one researcher may say their experiment suggests evidence of absence, another researcher might argue that the experiment failed to detect a phenomenon for other reasons.

===Matters of confusion===
{{see also|Evidence of absence}}

Much confusion about arguments from ignorance can be caused when one side of a debate forgets that we often possess [[evidence of absence]] in practice. However, the confusion can be avoided by not partaking in a logical debate.

The ignorance fallacy is sometimes confused (or combined) with logically valid [[contrapositive]] arguments. Contrapositive arguments rightly utilize the [[Transposition (logic)|transposition]] rule of inference in classical logic to conclude something like: To the extent that ''C implies E'' then ''Not-E must also imply Not-C''. In other words, if a cause ''always'' leads to an effect, then absence of the expected effect is evidence of absence of the cause. For example, if the causal proposition that ''If it's raining outside then the streets will be wet'' is assumed, then it can be assumed that ''if the streets are not wet then it is not raining outside''. The inference that it cannot be raining outside because the streets are not getting wet is exactly as true, or perhaps exactly as untrue, as the original proposition. The statements are [[contraposition|logically equivalent]].

[[Carl Sagan]] explains in his book ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]'':
{{quote|'''Appeal to ignorance''': the claim that whatever has not been proven false must be true, and vice versa. (e.g., ''There is no compelling evidence that UFOs are not visiting the Earth; therefore, UFOs exist, and there is intelligent life elsewhere in the Universe.'' Or: ''There may be seventy kazillion other worlds, but not one is known to have the moral advancement of the Earth, so we're still central to the Universe.'') This impatience with ambiguity can be criticized in the phrase: absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sagan|first=Carl|authorlink=Carl Sagan|title=[[The Demon-Haunted World]]|chapter=Chapter 12: The Fine Art of Baloney Detection}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For instance, absence of evidence that it rained (i.e. water is the evidence) may be considered positive evidence that it did not rain. Again, in science, such inferences are always made to some limited (sometimes extremely high) degree of [[probability]] and in this case absence of evidence is evidence of absence when the positive evidence should have been there but is not.

Arguments from ignorance can easily find their way into debates over the [[existence of God]]. It is a fallacy to draw conclusions based precisely on ignorance, since this does not satisfactorily address issues of [[philosophic burden of proof]].

==Related terms==

=== Contraposition and transposition ===
[[Contraposition (traditional logic)|Contraposition]] is a logically valid rule of inference that allows the creation of a new proposition from the negation and reordering of an existing one. The method applies to any proposition of the type ''If A then B'' and says that negating all the variables and switching them back to front leads to a new proposition i.e. ''If Not-B then Not-A'' that is just as true as the original one and that the first implies the second and the second implies the first.

[[Transposition (logic)|Transposition]] is exactly the same thing as Contraposition, described in a different language.

=== Absence of evidence ===
''Absence of evidence,'' is the lack of – any kind of evidence – that may show, indicate, suggest, or be used to 1) infer, or 2) deduce the truthfulness of an asserted fact.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

=== Negative evidence ===
''Negative evidence'' is sometimes used as an alternative to ''absence of evidence'' and is often meant to be synonymous with it. On the other hand, the term may also refer to evidence with a ''negative'' value, or ''null'' result equivalent to ''evidence of absence''. It may even refer to positive evidence about something of an unpleasant nature.

=== Evidence of absence ===
{{Main| Evidence of absence}}
Evidence of absence is evidence of any kind that can be used to infer or deduce the non-existence or non-presence of something. For instance, if a doctor does not find any ''malignant cells'' in a patient this [[null result]] (finding nothing) is evidence of absence of cancer, even though the doctor has not actually detected anything per se. Such [[inductive reasoning]] is important to [[empiricism]] and science, but has well established limitations. The challenge thus becomes to try to identify when a researcher has received a null result (found nothing) because the thing does not exist (evidence of absence—objectively negative result), and when one simply lacks proper means of detection (absence of evidence—false negative).
==== Null result ====
''[[Null result]]'' is a term often used in science to indicate ''evidence of absence''. A search for water on the ground may yield a null result (the ground is dry); therefore, it probably did not rain.

==Related arguments==

=== Argument from self-knowing (auto-epistemic) ===
Arguments from self-knowing take the form:

# If P were true then I would know it; in fact I do not know it; therefore P cannot be true.
# If P were false then I would know it; in fact I do not know it; therefore P cannot be false.

In practice these arguments are often fallacious and rely on the veracity of the supporting premise. For example, the argument that ''If I had just sat on a wild [[porcupine]] then I would know it; in fact I do not know it; therefore I did not just sit on a wild porcupine'' is probably not a fallacy and depends entirely on the veracity of the leading proposition that supports it. (See [[Contraposition]] and [[Transposition (logic)|Transposition]] in the ''Related terms'' section in this article.)

== Distinguishing ''absence of evidence'' from ''evidence of absence'' ==
''Absence of evidence'' is a condition in which no valid conclusion can be inferred from the ''mere'' absence of detection, normally due to doubt in the detection method. ''[[Evidence of absence]]'' is the successful variation: a conclusion that relies on specific knowledge in conjunction with negative detection to deduce the absence of something. An example of evidence of absence is checking your pockets for spare change and finding nothing, ''but'' being confident that the search would have found it if it was there.

===Formal argument===
By determining that a given experiment or method of detection is sensitive and reliable enough to detect the presence of X (when X is present) one can confidently exclude the possibility that X may be both undetected and present. This allows one to deduce that X cannot be present if a null result is received.

Thus there are only two possibilities, given a null result:
# Nothing detected, and X is not present.
# Nothing detected, but X ''is'' present (option eliminated by careful research design).

To the extent that option 2 can be eliminated, one can deduce that ''if X is not detected then X is not present'' and therefore the [[null result]] is evidence of absence.

== Examples ==

===  Absence of evidence ===
(These examples contain or represent missing information.)

* Statements that begin with "I can't prove it but&amp;nbsp;..." are often referring to some kind of absence of evidence.
* "There is no evidence of foul play here" is a direct reference to the absence of evidence.
* "There is no evidence of aliens, and therefore, aliens do not exist" appeals to an absence of evidence

=== Negative results ===
* When the doctor says that the test results were negative, it is usually good news.
* Under "Termites" the inspector checked the box that read "no".

=== Evidence of absence ===
(These examples contain definite evidence that can be used to show, indicate, suggest, infer or deduce the non-existence or non-presence of something.)

* A biopsy shows the absence of malignant cells.
* One very carefully inspects the back seat of one's car and finds no adult-sized kangaroos.
* The train schedule does not say that the train stops here at 3:00pm on a Sunday. (It could indeed happen that the train will stop here for another reason than the actual schedule, e. g. due to an incident or technical reasons, but the evidence clearly proves that the train ''schedule'' does not include a halt at this station.)

=== Arguments from ignorance ===
(Draws a conclusion based on lack of knowledge or evidence without accounting for all possibilities)
* "I take the view that this lack (of enemy subversive activity in the west coast) is the most ominous sign in our whole situation. It convinces me more than perhaps any other factor that the sabotage we are to get, the [[Fifth Column]] activities are to get, are timed just like Pearl Harbor&amp;nbsp;... I believe we are just being lulled into a false sense of security." – [[Earl Warren]], then California's Attorney General  (before a congressional hearing in San Francisco on 21 February 1942).
* This example clearly states what appeal to ignorance is: "Although we have proven that the moon is not made of spare ribs, we have not proven that its core cannot be filled with them; therefore, the moon’s core is filled with spare ribs."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/56/Argument-from-Ignoranc|title=Argument from Ignorance|website=www.logicallyfallacious.com|access-date=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin of the term ==
From ''Fallacies: classical and contemporary readings'' by Hans V. Hansen, Robert C. Pinto:
:"It is generally accepted that the philosopher John Locke introduced the term in his Essay Concerning Human Understanding:"
::"Another way that Men ordinarily use to drive others, and force them to submit their Judgments, and receive the Opinion in debate, is to require the Adversary to admit what they allege as a Proof, or assign a better. And this I call Argumentum ad Ignorantiam" —[[John Locke]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Locke|first1=John|title=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding|date=1690|url=http://www3.nd.edu/~afreddos/courses/439/locke0417.htm|accessdate=12 March 2015|chapter=Book IV, Chapter XVII: Of Reason}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Autonoetic consciousness''' is the human ability to mentally place ourselves in the past, in the future, or in [[counterfactual conditional|counterfactual]] situations, and to thus be able to [[self-awareness|examine our own thoughts]].

Our sense of self affects our behavior, in the present, past and future.  It relates to how we reflect on our own past behavior, how we feel about it, and this in turn determines if we do it again.{{sfn|Baddeley|Eysenck|Anderson|2009}}{{page needed|date=May 2011}}

It is [[episodic memory]] that deals with self-awareness, memories of the self and inward thoughts that may be projected onto future actions of an individual.{{sfn|Baddeley|Eysenck|Anderson|2009}}{{page needed|date=May 2011}} It was "proposed by [[Endel Tulving|[Endel] Tulving]] for self-awareness, allowing the rememberer to reflect on the contents of episodic memory".{{sfn|Baddeley|Eysenck|Anderson|2015|p=308}} Moreover, autonoetic consciousness involves behaviors such as mental time travel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schacter |first1=D.&amp;nbsp;L. |last2=Addis |first2=D.&amp;nbsp;R. |last3=Buckner |first3=R.&amp;nbsp;L. |year=2007 |title=Remembering the Past to Imagine the Future: The Prospective Brain |journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |volume=8 |pages=657–661}} Cited in {{harvnb|Hills|Butterfill|2015|p=369}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Suddendorf |first1=T. |last2=Corballis |first2=M.&amp;nbsp;C. |year=2007 |title=The Evolution of Foresight: What Is Mental Time Travel, and Is It Unique to Humans? |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=30 |pages=299–313}} Cited in {{harvnb|Hills|Butterfill|2015|p=369}}.&lt;/ref&gt; self-projection,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Buckner |first1=R.&amp;nbsp;L. |last2=Carroll |first2=D.&amp;nbsp;C. |year=2007 |title=Self-Projection and the Brain |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=11 |pages=49–57}} Cited in {{harvnb|Hills|Butterfill|2015|p=369}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and episodic future thinking,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Atance |first1=C.&amp;nbsp;M. |last2=O'Neill |first2=D.&amp;nbsp;K. |year=2001 |title=Episodic Future Thinking |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=5 |pages=533–539}} Cited in {{harvnb|Hills|Butterfill|2015|p=369}}.&lt;/ref&gt; all of which have often been proposed as exclusively human capacities.{{sfn|Hills|Butterfill|2015|p=369}}

== The self ==
Autonoetic consciousness is important in our formation of our "self" identity.  What we have done in the past becomes a part of our "self" and the ability to reflect on this influences our behavior in the now.

In psychology, the self is often used for that set of attributes that a person attaches to himself or herself most firmly, the attributes that the person finds it difficult or impossible to imagine himself or herself without.&lt;ref name="Perry 1995"&gt;{{cite web |first=John |last=Perry |year=1995 |title=The Self |url=http://faculty.washington.edu/smcohen/453/PerrySelf.pdf}}{{Self-published inline|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2018}} Identity is also used to describe this.&lt;ref name="Perry 1995"/&gt; A person's gender is part of their identity but their profession, for example, may not be.&lt;ref name="Perry 1995"/&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2018}}

In philosophy, the self is the agent, the knower and the ultimate locus of personal identity.&lt;ref name="Perry 1995"/&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2018}} This self, the identity of which is at the bottom of every action, and involved in every bit of knowledge, is the self philosophers worry about.&lt;ref name="Perry 1995"/&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2018}} Nevertheless, care of the self is of utmost importance in the bios-logos relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Parrhesia, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=March 2018}}

A straightforward view of the self would be that the self is just the person, and that a person is a physical system.&lt;ref name="Perry 1995"/&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2018}} There are two problems with this view. First, the nature of freedom and consciousness has convinced many philosophers that there is a fundamentally non-physical aspect of persons.&lt;ref name="Perry 1995"/&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2018}} The second challenge stems from puzzling aspects of self-knowledge, as the knowledge we have of ourselves seems very unlike the knowledge we have of other objects in several ways.&lt;ref name="Perry 1995"/&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2018}}

== The parietal cortex ==
&lt;!--[[Image:parietallobe.jpg|thumb|alt=The lobes of the brain including the parietal, highlighted.|The Brain, highlighting in red the ''[[Parietal Lobe]]''.]]--&gt;

The [[parietal cortex]] is strongly involved in autonoetic consciousness.  Damage to areas of the parietal cortex can lead to different functioning errors, including changes in personality.

The [[parietal lobe]]s can be divided into two functional regions.  One involves [[sensation (psychology)|sensation]] and [[perception (psychology)|perception]], and the other is concerned with integrating sensory input, primarily with the visual system.&lt;ref name="TBI Resource Guide"&gt;{{cite web |title=Parietal Lobes |publisher=Centre for Neuro Skills |work=TBI Resource Guide |url=http://www.neuroskills.com/tbi/bparieta.shtml}}{{Verify credibility|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first function integrates sensory information to form a single perception.&lt;ref name="TBI Resource Guide"/&gt; The second function constructs a spatial coordinate system to represent the world around us.&lt;ref name="TBI Resource Guide"/&gt;

Individuals with damage to the parietal lobes often show striking deficits, such as abnormalities in body image and [[spatial relation]]s.&lt;ref name="TBI Resource Guide"/&gt;

Damage to the left parietal lobe can result in what is called [[Gerstmann's syndrome]] which includes right-left confusion, difficulty with writing, and difficulty with mathematics.&lt;ref name="TBI Resource Guide"/&gt; It can also produce disorders of language, and the inability to perceive objects normally.&lt;ref name="TBI Resource Guide"/&gt;

Damage to the right parietal lobe can result in neglecting part of the body or space, which can impair many [[self care|self-care]] skills such as dressing and washing.&lt;ref name="TBI Resource Guide"/&gt; Right side damage can also cause difficulty in making things, denial of deficits, and drawing ability.&lt;ref name="TBI Resource Guide"/&gt;

Bi-lateral damage can cause [[Bálint's syndrome]], a visual attention and motor syndrome.&lt;ref name="TBI Resource Guide"/&gt; This is characterized by the inability to voluntarily control the gaze, inability to integrate components of a visual scene, and the inability to accurately reach for an object with visual guidance.&lt;ref name="TBI Resource Guide"/&gt;

Left parietal-temporal lesions can affect verbal memory and the ability to recall strings of digits.&lt;ref name="TBI Resource Guide"/&gt;

The right parietal-temporal lobe is concerned with non-verbal memory.&lt;ref name="TBI Resource Guide"/&gt; Right parietal-temporal lesions can produce significant changes in personality.&lt;ref name="TBI Resource Guide"/&gt;

Lesions in the right parietal lobe influence personality, and this could be because the parietal lobe has to do with our sense of self.  Our sense of self is strongly reflected in our personality.

Some common tests for parietal lobe function are: Kimura Box Test ([[apraxia]]) and the [[two-point discrimination|Two-Point Discrimination]] Test (somatosensory).&lt;ref name="TBI Resource Guide"/&gt;

During episodic retrieval, functional imaging studies consistently show differential activity in medial [[prefrontal cortex|prefrontal]] and medial parietal cortices.{{sfn|Lou|Luber|Crupain|Keenan|2004|p=6827}}

With [[positron emission tomography]], it has been shown that the medial regions are functionally connected and interact with lateral regions that are activated according to the degree of self-reference.{{sfn|Lou|Luber|Crupain|Keenan|2004|p=6827}}

For example, in one study, during retrieval of previous judgments of oneself, best friend, and the Danish Queen, activation increased in the left lateral [[temporal cortex]] and decreased in the right inferior parietal region with decreasing self-reference.{{sfn|Lou|Luber|Crupain|Keenan|2004|p=6827}} The decrease in parietal cortex activation may then prove it is a nodal structure in self representation, functionally connected to both the right parietal and the medial prefrontal cortices.{{sfn|Lou|Luber|Crupain|Keenan|2004|p=6827}} There was a decrease in the efficiency of retrieval of previous judgment of mental Self compared with retrieval of judgment of Other with [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] at a latency of 160&amp;nbsp;ms, confirming the hypothesis that the medial parietal cortex in this network is essential for episodic memory retrieval with self-representation.{{sfn|Lou|Luber|Crupain|Keenan|2004|p=6827}}

This network is strikingly similar to the network of the resting conscious state, suggesting that self-monitoring is a core function in resting [[consciousness]].{{sfn|Lou|Luber|Crupain|Keenan|2004|p=6827}}

== Episodic memory and the self ==
For a coherent and meaningful life, conscious self-representation is mandatory.{{sfn|Lou|Luber|Crupain|Keenan|2004|p=6827}} Autonoetic consciousness is thought to emerge by retrieval of memory of personally experienced events (episodic memory).{{sfn|Lou|Luber|Crupain|Keenan|2004|p=6827}} Without the ability to reflect on our past experiences, we would be stuck in a state of constant awakening, without a past and therefore unable to prepare for the future.

Episodic memory is the memory we have for our past experiences, which influence our now, and our future. This is different from procedural memory, which is our memory for how to do things. Episodic memories influence our thinking about ourselves, good and bad.

[[Autobiographical memory|Autobiographical memories]] can be retrieved from either the first person perspective, in which individuals see the event through their own eyes, or from the third person perspective, in which individuals see themselves and the event from the perspective of an external observer.{{sfn|Sutin|Robins|2008|p=1386}}

A growing body of research suggests that the visual perspective from which a memory is retrieved has important implications for a person's thoughts, feelings, and goals, and is integrally related to a host of self- evaluative processes.{{sfn|Sutin|Robins|2008|p=1386}}

== Event-related potentials ==
&lt;!--[[Image:erp.jpg|thumb|alt=An ERP reading comparing autonoetic and noetic consciousness.|An ERP reading demonstrating autonoetic consciousness compared to an ERP reading of noetic consciousness.]]--&gt;

[[Event-related potentials]] (ERPs) can measure autonoetic consciousness scientifically. Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) are a non-invasive method of measuring brain activity during cognitive processing.&lt;ref name="Georgetown"&gt;{{cite web |title=Electroencephalography/Event Related Potentials (EEG/ERP) Laboratory |url=http://brainlang.georgetown.edu/erplab.htm |dead-url=yes |department=Brain and Language Lab |location=Washington |publisher=Georgetown University |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719200527/http://brainlang.georgetown.edu/erplab.htm |archive-date=19 July 2011 |access-date=17 March 2018}}{{Self-published inline|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transient electric potential shifts (so-called ERP components) are time-locked to the stimulus onset (e.g., the presentation of a word, a sound, or an image).&lt;ref name="Georgetown"/&gt; Each component reflects brain activation associated with one or more mental operations.&lt;ref name="Georgetown"/&gt;

In contrast to behavioral measures such as error rates and response times, ERPs are characterized by simultaneous multi-dimensional online measures of polarity (negative or positive potentials), amplitude, latency, and scalp distribution.&lt;ref name="Georgetown"/&gt; Therefore, ERPs can be used to distinguish and identify psychological and neural sub-processes involved in complex cognitive, motor, or perceptual tasks.&lt;ref name="Georgetown"/&gt;

Unlike [[fMRI]], they provide extremely high time resolution, in the range of one millisecond.&lt;ref name="Georgetown"/&gt;

The methodological advantages of ERPs have resulted in an ever increasing number of ERP studies in cognitive neuroscience, cognitive psychology, psycholinguistics, neurolinguistics, neuropsychology, and neurology.&lt;ref name="Georgetown"/&gt; ERPs have also been used to identify patients who seem to be "brain-dead" but in fact are not.&lt;ref name="Georgetown"/&gt;

There is an event-related potential (ERP) experiment of human recognition memory that explored the relation between conscious awareness and [[electrophysiology|electrophysiological]] activity of the brain.{{sfn|Duzel|Yonelinas|Mangun|Heinze|1997|p=5973}} ERPs were recorded from healthy adults while they made "remember" and "know" recognition judgments about previously seen words, reflecting "Autonoetic" and "Noetic" awareness, respectively.{{sfn|Duzel|Yonelinas|Mangun|Heinze|1997|p=5973}} The ERP effects differed between the two kinds of awareness while they were similar for "true" and "false" recognition.{{sfn|Duzel|Yonelinas|Mangun|Heinze|1997|p=5973}}

In a study of real-time noninvasive recordings of the brain's electrical activity (event-related potentials, ERPs), there was a common neural "signature" that is associated with self-referential processing regardless of whether subjects are retrieving general knowledge (noetic awareness) or re-experiencing past episodes (autonoetic awareness).{{sfn|Magno|Allan|2007|p=672}}

== Social anxiety disorder ==
[[Social anxiety disorder]] (SAD) is an example of how bad experiences can also lead to our behaviors.  It demonstrates how our thoughts influence our feelings about ourselves and therefore our actions in society around us.  It has to do with a person’s self-esteem, fear of failure, shame, fear of offending, and fear of strangers.

Cognitive models of social anxiety disorder believe the social self is a key psychological mechanism that maintains [[fear of negative evaluation]] in social and performance situations.{{sfn|Anderson|Goldin|Kurita|Gross|2008}}{{page needed|date=March 2018}} Consequently, a distorted self-view is evident when recalling painful autobiographical social memories, as reflected in linguistic expression, negative self-beliefs, and [[experiential avoidance|emotion and avoidance]].{{sfn|Anderson|Goldin|Kurita|Gross|2008}}{{page needed|date=March 2018}}

To test this hypothesis, 42 adults diagnosed with SAD and 27 non-psychiatric healthy controls composed autobiographical narratives of distinct social anxiety related situations, generated negative self-beliefs, and provided emotion and avoidance ratings.{{sfn|Anderson|Goldin|Kurita|Gross|2008}}{{page needed|date=March 2018}}

Although narratives were matched for initial emotional intensity and present vividness, linguistic analyses demonstrated that, compared to the control group, the SAD group employed more self-referential, anxiety, and sensory words, and made fewer references to other people.{{sfn|Anderson|Goldin|Kurita|Gross|2008}}{{page needed|date=March 2018}} Social anxiety symptom severity, however, was associated with greater self-referential NSB in SAD only.{{sfn|Anderson|Goldin|Kurita|Gross|2008}}{{page needed|date=March 2018}}

SAD reported greater current self-conscious emotions when recalling autobiographical social situations, and greater active avoidance of similar situations than did the control group.{{sfn|Anderson|Goldin|Kurita|Gross|2008}}{{page needed|date=March 2018}} Autobiographical memory of social situations in SAD may influence current and future thinking, emotion, and behavioral avoidance.{{sfn|Anderson|Goldin|Kurita|Gross|2008}}{{page needed|date=March 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11175">'''Bertrand competition''' is a model of competition used in economics, named after [[Joseph Louis François Bertrand]] (1822–1900). It describes interactions among firms (sellers) that set prices and their customers (buyers) that choose quantities at the prices set.  The model was formulated in 1883 by Bertrand in a review of [[Antoine Augustin Cournot]]'s book ''Recherches sur les Principes Mathématiques de la Théorie des Richesses'' (1838) in which Cournot had put forward the [[Cournot model]].&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand, J. (1883) "Book review of theorie mathematique de la richesse sociale and of recherches sur les principles mathematiques de la theorie des richesses", Journal de Savants 67: 499–508&lt;/ref&gt; Cournot argued that when firms choose quantities, the equilibrium outcome involves firms pricing above marginal cost and hence the competitive price. In his review, Bertrand argued that if firms chose prices rather than quantities, then the competitive outcome would occur with price equal to marginal cost. The model was not formalized by Bertrand: however, the idea was developed into a mathematical model by [[Francis Ysidro Edgeworth]] in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;Edgeworth, Francis (1889) “The pure theory of monopoly”, reprinted in Collected Papers relating to Political Economy 1925, vol.1, Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

The model rests on very specific assumptions. There are at least two firms producing a homogeneous (undifferentiated) product and cannot cooperate in any way. Firms compete by setting prices simultaneously and consumers want to buy everything from a firm with a lower price (since the product is homogeneous and there are no consumer search costs). If two firms charge the same price, consumers' demand is split evenly between them. It is simplest to concentrate on the case of [[duopoly]] where there are just two firms, although the results hold for  any number of firms greater than 1.

A crucial assumption about the technology is that both firms have the same constant unit cost of production, so that marginal and average costs are the same and equal to the competitive price. This means that as long as the price it sets is above unit cost, the firm is willing to supply any amount that is demanded (it earns profit on each unit sold). If price is equal to unit cost, then it is indifferent to how much it sells, since it earns no profit. Obviously, the firm will never want to set a price below unit cost, but if it did it would not want to sell anything since it would lose money on each unit sold.

==The Bertrand duopoly equilibrium==
Why is the competitive price a [[Nash equilibrium]] in the Bertrand model? First, if both firms set the competitive price with price equal to marginal cost (unit cost), neither firm will earn any profits. However, if one firm sets price equal to marginal cost, then if the other firm raises its price above unit cost, then it will earn nothing, since all consumers will buy from the firm still setting the competitive price (recall that it is willing to meet unlimited demand at price equals unit cost even though it earns no profit). No other price is an equilibrium. If both firms set the same price above unit cost and share the market, then each firm has an incentive to undercut the other by an arbitrarily small amount and capture the whole market and almost double its profits. So there can be no equilibrium with both firms setting the same price above marginal cost. Also, there can be no equilibrium with firms setting different prices. The firms setting the higher price will earn nothing (the lower priced firm serves all of the customers). Hence the higher priced firm will want to lower its price to undercut the lower-priced firm. Hence the ''only'' equilibrium in the Bertrand model occurs when both firms set price equal to unit cost (the competitive price).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1=Narahari | first1=Y. | year=2009 | title=Game Theoretic Problems in Network Economics and Mechanism Design Solutions | last2=Garg | first2=Dinesh | last3=Narayanam | first3=Ramasuri | last4=Prakash | first4=Hastagiri | publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | isbn=978-1-84800-937-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S7zxVKFmk24C&amp;pg=PA21 | page=21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that the Bertrand equilibrium is a ''weak'' Nash-equilibrium. The firms lose nothing by deviating from the competitive price: it is an equilibrium simply because each firm can earn no more than zero profits given that the other firm sets the competitive price and is willing to meet all demand at that price.

== Calculating the classic Bertrand model ==
*MC = constant [[marginal cost]] (equals constant unit cost of production).
*p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = firm 1’s price level
*p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = firm 2’s price level
*p&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; = monopoly price level

Firm 1's optimum price depends on where it believes firm 2 will set its prices. Pricing just below the other firm will obtain full market demand (D), though this is not optimal if the other firm is pricing below marginal cost as that would entail negative profits. In general terms, firm 1's [[best response]] function is p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;’’(p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), this gives firm 1 optimal price for each price set by firm 2.

Diagram 1 shows firm 1’s reaction function p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;’’(p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), with each firm's strategy on each axis. It shows that when P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is less than marginal cost (firm 2 pricing below MC) firm 1 prices at marginal cost, p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=MC. When firm 2 prices above MC but below monopoly prices, then firm 1 prices just below firm 2. When firm 2 prices above monopoly prices (P&lt;sup&gt;M&lt;/sup&gt;) firm 1 prices at monopoly level, p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=p&lt;sup&gt;M&lt;/sup&gt;.

[[File:economics bertrand diag1.png]]

Because firm 2 has the same marginal cost as firm 1, its reaction function is symmetrical with respect to the 45 degree line. Diagram 2 shows both reaction functions.

[[File:economics bertrand diag2.png]]

The result of the firms' strategies is a [[Nash equilibrium]], that is, a pair of strategies (prices in this case) where neither firm can increase profits by unilaterally changing price. This is given by the intersection of the reaction curves, Point N on the diagram. At this point p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;’’(p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;’’(p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). As you can see, point N on the diagram is where both firms are pricing at marginal cost.

Another way of thinking about it, a simpler way, is to imagine if both firms set equal prices above marginal cost, firms would get half the market at a higher than MC price. However, by lowering prices just slightly, a firm could gain the whole market, so both firms are tempted to lower prices as much as they can. It would be irrational to price below marginal cost, because the firm would make a loss. Therefore, both firms will lower prices until they reach the MC limit.

If one firm has lower average cost (a superior [[production function|production technology]]), it will charge the highest price that is lower than the average cost of the other one (i.e. a price ''just'' below the lowest price the other firm can manage) and take all the business. This is known as [[limit price|"limit pricing"]]

== Critical analysis of the Bertrand model ==

The Bertrand model rests on some very extreme assumptions. For example, it assumes that consumers want to buy from the lowest priced firm. There are various reasons why this may not hold in many markets: non-price competition and [[product differentiation]], transport and [[Price dispersion|search costs]]. For example, would someone travel twice as far to save 1% on the price of their vegetables? The Bertrand model can be extended to include product or location differentiation but then the main result – that price is driven down to marginal cost – no longer holds. With search costs, there may be other equilibria apart from the competitive price – the monopoly price or even price dispersion may be equilibria as in the classic "Bargains and Rip-offs" model.&lt;ref&gt;Salop S and Stiglitz J (1977) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2296903  Bargains and Ripoffs: A Model of Monopolistically Competitive Price Dispersion], The Review of Economic Studies, Vol. 44, No. 3 (Oct., 1977), pp. 493–510&lt;/ref&gt;

The model also ignores capacity constraints. If a single firm does not have the capacity to supply the whole market then the "price equals marginal cost" result may not hold. The analysis of this case was started by [[Francis Ysidro Edgeworth]] and has become known as the [[Bertrand–Edgeworth model]]. With capacity constraints, there may not exist any pure strategy Nash equilibrium, the so-called [[Edgeworth paradox]]. However, in general there will exist a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium as shown by [[Huw Dixon]]&lt;ref&gt;Dixon H (1984) [http://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ecolet/v16y1984i3-4p205-212.html The existence of mixed-strategy equilibria in a price-setting oligopoly with convex costs], Economics Letters, volume 16, pages 205–212.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a big incentive to cooperate in the Bertrand model: [[collusion|colluding]] to charge the [[monopoly]] price and sharing the market each is the best that the firms could do in this set up. However not colluding and charging [[marginal cost]], is the non-cooperative outcome and the only [[Nash equilibrium]] of this model. If we move from a one-shot game to a repeated game, then perhaps collusion can persist for some time or emerge.

==Bertrand competition versus Cournot competition==
Neither model is necessarily "better" than the other. The accuracy of the predictions of each model will vary from industry to industry, depending on the closeness of each model to the industry situation. If capacity and output can be easily changed, Bertrand is generally a better model of duopoly competition. If output and capacity are difficult to adjust, then Cournot is generally a better model.
Under some conditions the Cournot model can be recast as a two-stage model, where in the first stage firms choose capacities, and in the second they compete in Bertrand fashion.

Bertrand predicts a duopoly is enough to push prices down to marginal cost level; a duopoly will result in an outcome exactly equivalent to what prevails under [[perfect competition]].

Many [[definitions of terrorism]] exist, but there is no consensus on a single, universal definition. For example, Kydd and Walter define terrorism as "the use of violence against civilians by non-state actors to attain political goals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kydd|first1=Andrew H.|last2=Walter|first2=Barbara F.|title=The Strategies of Terrorism|journal=The MIT Press|date=Summer 2006|volume=31|issue=1|pages=49–80|jstor=4137539|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US Department of State defines terrorism as "premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents." On the other hand, the FBI's Code of Federal Regulations defines terrorism as "The unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=U.S. Department of Justice|title=Terrorism 2002/2005|url=https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/terrorism-2002-2005|website=FBI}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of a universal definition of terrorism has led to controversies, making it sometimes difficult to label a certain attack as a terrorist incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=Mike|title=The legal definition of terrorism threatens to criminalise us all|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/the-legal-definition-of-terrorism-threatens-to-criminalise-us-all-9626325.html|accessdate=May 16, 2017|publisher=Independent|date=July 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Tarik Kafala, head of BBC Arabic insists journalists must stop using the term "terrorist", because it is a "value-laden" term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sherwin|first1=Adam|title=BBC Arabic head Tarik Kafala on the channel's increasing significance in the modern world|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/opinion/bbc-arabic-head-tarik-kafala-on-the-channels-increasing-significance-in-the-modern-world-10001667.html|publisher=The Independent|date=January 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there have been controversies, such as Obama's refusal to use the phrase, "Islamic terrorism", with political implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Diaz|first1=Daniella|title=Obama: Why I won't say 'Islamic terrorism'|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/09/28/politics/obama-radical-islamic-terrorism-cnn-town-hall/|publisher=CNN|date=September 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vagueness of Definition==
There are several problems with the [[definition of terrorism]].

''No universally accepted definition''

There is no universally accepted definition of terrorism. In his paper, "Defining Terrorism: Is One Man's Terrorist Another Man's Freedom Fighter?", Boaz Ganor points out the urgency of an internationally accepted definition of terrorism due to the ambiguousness of the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ganor|first1=Boaz|title=Defining Terrorism: Is One Man's Terrorist another Man's Freedom Fighter?|journal=Police Practice and Research|date=2002|volume=3|issue=4|pages=287–304|doi=10.1080/1561426022000032060|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1561426022000032060|accessdate=May 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even within the country of the United States, the US Department of State and the FBI have different definitions of terrorism, which can lead one institute to classify an event as terrorist while another does not.

''Vague wording''

Another issue with the definition of terrorism is its vague wording. Navin Bapat, a professor of political science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and expert on terrorist campaigns, points out the subjective nature of words used in definitions of terrorism, such as "non-combatant" and "political purposes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peralta|first1=Eyder|title=When Is An Act Of Violence An Act Of Terrorism?|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/07/17/423881551/when-is-an-act-of-violence-an-act-of-terrorism|publisher=NPR|date=July 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subjectivity of such words allows for dispute over whether a group is or is not terrorist, as questions such as the degree to which the attack was pre-meditated, the degree to which a subnational group was involved with the premeditation of the attack, or the definition of a "non-combatant" and what ideologies are considered "political" may arise.

''Examples''

[[Steve Biko]] was a South African [[Internal resistance to South African apartheid|anti-apartheid]] activist who believed that some violence against whites was inevitable while apartheid remained in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woods|first1=Donald|title=Biko|date=1978|publisher=NewYork and London: Paddington Press|isbn=0-8050-1899-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a leading figure of the [[South African Students' Organization]], and participated in founding the [[Black People's Convention]]. According to many definitions of terrorism, including the US Department of State and Kydd &amp; Walter as well as the [[Terrorism Act, 1967|Terrorism Act]] of South Africa at the time, Steve Biko's activities qualified as terrorism. Steve Biko was arrested under the South African Terrorism Act, and died while in custody. Today, Steve Biko is appraised as a hero - &lt;ref&gt;Ahluwalia and Zegeye described him as "an articulate and visionary black South African intellectual and hero"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ahluwalia|first1=Pal|last2=Zegeye|first2=Abebe|title=Frantz Fanon and Steve Biko: Towards Liberation|journal=Social Identities|date=2001|volume=7|issue=3|pages=455–469|doi=10.1080/1350463012008726}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manning Marable and Peniel Joseph also referred to him as "one of South Africa's greatest fighters - and martyrs - for freedom." In a public vote in 2004, Steve Biko was elected 13th of [[SABC3's Great South Africans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marable|first1=Manning|last2=Joseph|first2=Peniel|title=Series Editors' Preface: Steve Biko and the International Context of Black Consciousness|date=2008|publisher=New York and Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-60519-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This example illustrates the fact that some "terrorists" may become heroes when alternate perspectives are acknowledged.

Similarly, the [[Edelweiss Pirates]] were a group of youth that stood up against the [[Nazi regime]], sometimes using violence. Some of the members were arrested and executed for conspiring to plant a bomb at the [[Gestapo]] headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Macey|first1=Jennifer|title=Campaigning for Cologne's Maligned Resistance|url=http://www.dw.com/en/campaigning-for-colognes-maligned-resistance/a-1391096|website=DW|publisher=Deutsche Welle}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the definition of terrorism as outlined by the US Department of State, this group can be categorized as terrorist, as they are a subnational group that planned politically-motivated violence against noncombatant targets. In 2005, however, the German authorities gave official recognition to the [[Edelweiss Pirates]] as resistance heroes after 60 years of denouncing them as a criminal organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Teenage rebels who fought Nazis are honoured at last|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/1492771/Teenage-rebels-who-fought-Nazis-are-honoured-at-last.html|publisher=The Telegraph|date=June 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that German authorities may recognize as heroes a group that not only was once considered a criminal group but can also presently qualify as a terrorist group, clearly demonstrates the vagueness of the various definitions of terrorism currently used by different institutions around the world.

A more recent and more controversial example is the [[2016 Orlando Nightclub Shooting]]. Though it has been established that the shooter, Omar Mateen, pledged allegiance to ISIS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ellis|first1=Ralph|title=Orlando shooting: 49 killed, shooter pledged ISIS allegiance|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/12/us/orlando-nightclub-shooting/|publisher=CNN|date=June 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is no evidence that ISIS provided operational support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Malsin|first1=Jared|title=What to Know About ISIS's Role in the Orlando Shooting|url=http://time.com/4365507/orlando-shooting-isis-claims-responsibility-terror/|publisher=TIME|date=June 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this incident is to be labeled "terrorist" according to the definition of terrorism as defined by the US Department of State, Mateen must be acting as an agent of ISIS. However, ISIS lack of direct involvement in the premeditation and execution of the attack provides complications.

==Islam and Terrorism==
{{See also|Islamic Terrorism}}

Much controversy exists over the association of Islam with terrorism. Since the [[September 11 Attacks]], any act of violence has been prone to being labeled as "terrorist" if the perpetrator is Muslim, regardless of the intentions and organization details of the attack, rendering the definitions of terrorism void. For example, the [[2017 Westminster Attack]] has been described as a terrorist attack by various media agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Allen|first1=Emily|last2=Henderson|first2=Barney|title=Westminster Attack - Everything We Know So Far About the Events in london|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/22/westminster-terror-attack-everything-know-far/|publisher=The Telegraph|date=March 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith-Spark|first1=Laura|title=Westminster Attack: What You Need to Know|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/03/22/europe/uk-parliament-incident-what-happened/|publisher=CNN|date=March 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as with the [[2016 Orlando Nightclub Shooting]], no evidence linking the Khalid Massood, the attacker, to terrorist organizations has been found. Similarly, the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting]] sparked controversy when Tarik Kafala, head of [[BBC Arabic]], claimed that the attack must not be labeled as one of terrorist nature by the media because the term "terrorist" is value-laden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Turner|first1=Camilla|title=We must not call Charlie Hebdo killers 'terrorists', says BBC boss|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/bbc/11369104/We-must-not-call-Charlie-Hebdo-killers-terrorists-says-BBC-boss.html|publisher=The Telegraph|date=January 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, Muslims have been subject to particular scrutiny. In their paper, "‘I’m a Muslim, but I'm not a Terrorist’: Victimization, Risky Identities and the Performance of Safety", Mythen, Walkate &amp; Khan highlight the risk, identity, and experience of victimization that British Muslims encounter due to the current discourse on terrorism, which is biased towards Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mythen|first1=Gabe|last2=Walkate|first2=Sandra|last3=Khan|first3=Fatima|title=‘I’m a Muslim, but I'm not a Terrorist’: Victimization, Risky Identities and the Performance of Safety|journal=The British Journal of Criminology|date=2009|volume=49|issue=6|pages=736–754|doi=10.1093/bjc/azp032|url=https://academic.oup.com/bjc/article/49/6/736/408706/I-m-a-Muslim-but-I-m-not-a-Terrorist-Victimization|accessdate=May 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kosic and Nordio point out how the discourse on terrorism has created a tension between self and the "Other" in Europe, creating difficulties in communities' acceptance of immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kosic|first1=Marianna|last2=Nordio|first2=Daria|title=Perception and construction of "otherness" biased by fear|journal=IUIES-International University Institute for European Studies University of Trieste|date=2007|url=http://www.eisa-net.org/be-bruga/eisa/files/events/turin/Kosic-kosic_nordio_2007_perception_and_construction_of_otherness_biased_by_fear.pdf|accessdate=May 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such isolation of the Muslim community has led to scandalous incidents, particularly in airports and aircraft. For example, in August, 2016, three siblings were removed from an EasyJet flight from Stansted to Naples after being falsely accused of reading [[ISIS]] materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grierson|first1=Jamie|title=Trio forced off easyJet plane over false claims they support Isis|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/24/dharas-siblings-forced-off-easyjet-plane-stansted-accused-supporting-isis?CMP=share_btn_tw|accessdate=May 12, 2017|publisher=The Guardian|date=August 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim communities have also experienced hate crimes, such as when an arsonist set fire at the Islamic Center of Fort Pierce.

==Political Implications==
Governments can use the label and definitions of terrorism to convince the public that measures are being taken to protect them. For example, terrorism can be addressed as either a military problem or a criminal problem. [[President George W. Bush]] categorized terrorists as militants by declaring a [[war on terrorism]], while [[President Barack Obama]] used counter-terrorist measures rather than military measures. Governments can also use the label to isolate groups. Isolated groups may be oppressed, discriminated against, and delegitimized.

The isolation of groups by labeling them as terrorist has led to a division between the in-group and out-group, causing mistrust and caution towards immigration. This phenomenon is leading to the rise of extreme-right leaning candidates in Europe, particularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.csis.org/analysis/europe-crosshairs-political-implications-terror|title=Europe in the Crosshairs: Political Implications of Terror|website=CSIS|publisher=Center for Strategic and International Studies|last1=Nilsson|first1=Carl Hvenmark|accessdate=May 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, [[President Donald J. Trump]] has called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States and a registry of the US Muslim population, citing terrorism as justification. Reports from the Southern Poverty Law Center claim that Trump’s campaign contributed to the tripling of hate groups against Muslims from 34 in 2015 to 101 in 2016. The FBI found that hate crimes against Muslims increased by 67% in 2015. The SPLC documented over 300 bias-related incidents targeting immigrants or Muslims in the first 10 days after Trump’s election. 80% out of 10,000 educators reported more intense anxiety and fear among immigrant students and Muslim students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=England|first1=Charlotte|title=Donald Trump blamed for massive spike in Islamophobic hate crime|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-blame-islamophobic-anti-muslim-ban-hate-crime-numbers-southern-poverty-law-center-a7582846.html|accessdate=May 12, 2017|publisher=The Independent|date=February 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is Israel's political actions. Israel labels [[Palestinian political violence]] against them as terrorist, which allows Israel to reject negotiation. On the other hand, when Israel executed [[Operation Wooden Leg]] on Tunisia, leaving 47 dead and 65 wounded,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/03/world/tunisia-s-leader-bitter-at-the-us.html|title=TUNISIA'S LEADER BITTER AT THE U.S.|last=Times|first=Frank J.

{{short description|The process in which organic substances are broken down into simpler organic matter}}
{{Signs of death}}
[[File:Berge naturreservat omkullfallet liten tall.jpg|thumb|Decomposing fallen [[nurse log]] in a forest]]
'''Decomposition''' is the process by which [[organic substance]]s are broken down into a more simple organic matter. The process is a part of the [[nutrient cycle]] and is essential for recycling the finite matter that occupies physical space in the [[biosphere]]. Bodies of living organisms begin to decompose shortly after [[death]]. Animals, such as worms, also help decompose the organic materials. Organisms that do this are known as [[decomposer]]s. Although no two organisms decompose in the same way, they all undergo the same sequential stages of decomposition. The science which studies decomposition is generally referred to as  ''[[taphonomy]]'' from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''taphos'', meaning tomb.

One can differentiate '''abiotic''' from '''biotic decomposition''' ([[biodegradation]]). The former means "degradation of a substance by [[Chemical decomposition|chemical]] or physical processes, e.g., [[hydrolysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Water Quality Vocabulary. IShaO 6107-6:1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter means "the metabolic breakdown of materials into simpler components by living organisms",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Biotic decomposition|work=Water Words Dictionary (WWD)}}&lt;/ref&gt; typically by microorganisms.

{{TOC limit|3}}

== Animal decomposition ==
[[Image:Ants cleaning dead snake.jpg|right|thumb|[[Ant]]s eating a dead [[snake]]]]
Decomposition begins at the moment of death, caused by two factors: 1.) [[Autolysis (biology)|autolysis]], the breaking down of [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]s by the body's own internal chemicals and [[enzyme]]s, and 2.) [[putrefaction]], the breakdown of tissues by [[bacteria]]. These processes release compounds such as [[cadaverine]] and [[putrescine]], that are the chief source of the unmistakably putrid [[odor]] of decaying animal tissue.

Prime decomposers are [[bacteria]] or [[fungi]], though larger [[scavenger]]s also play an important role in decomposition if the body is accessible to [[insect]]s, [[Acari|mites]] and other animals. The most important arthropods that are involved in the process include [[carrion beetle]]s, mites,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=González Medina A, González Herrera L, Perotti MA, Jiménez Ríos G | title=Occurrence of ''Poecilochirus austroasiaticus'' (Acari: Parasitidae) in forensic autopsies and its application on postmortem interval estimation | journal=Exp. Appl. Acarol. | year=2013 | volume=59 | issue=3 | pages=297–305 | doi=10.1007/s10493-012-9606-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Braig|first=Henk R.|author2=Perotti, M. Alejandra|title=Carcases and mites|journal=Experimental and Applied Acarology|year=2009|volume=49|issue=1–2|pages=45–84|doi=10.1007/s10493-009-9287-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[flesh-fly|flesh-flies]] (Sarcophagidae) and [[Blow-fly|blow-flies]] ([[Calliphoridae]]), such as the [[green-bottle fly]] seen in the summer. In North America, the most important non-insect animals that are typically involved in the process include mammal and bird scavengers, such as [[coyote]]s, [[dog]]s, [[Wolf|wolves]], [[fox]]es, [[rat]]s, [[crows]] and [[vulture]]s.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Some of these scavengers also remove and scatter bones, which they ingest at a later time. Aquatic and marine environments have break-down agents that include bacteria, fish, crustaceans, [[Diptera|fly]] larvae &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=González Medina A, Soriano Hernando Ó, Jiménez Ríos G | title=The Use of the Developmental Rate of the Aquatic Midge ''Chironomus riparius'' (Diptera, Chironomidae) in the Assessment of the Postsubmersion Interval | journal=J. Forensic Sci. | year=2015 | volume=60 | issue=3 | pages=822–826 | doi=10.1111/1556-4029.12707}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other carrion scavengers.

=== Stages of decomposition ===
Five general stages are used to describe the process of decomposition in vertebrate animals: fresh, bloat, active decay, advanced decay, and dry/remains.&lt;ref name= Payne&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.2307/1934999|last= Payne|first= J.A.|title= A summer carrion study of the baby pig sus scrofa Linnaeus|journal= Ecology|volume=46|issue= 5| pages=592–602|year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general stages of decomposition are coupled with two stages of chemical decomposition: [[Autolysis (biology)|autolysis]] and [[putrefaction]].&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite book |last=Forbes | first=S.L. |editor= M. Tibbett |editor2=D.O. Carter |title=Soil Analysis in Forensic Taphonomy|publisher=CRC Press |year=2008 |pages=203–223 |chapter=Decomposition Chemistry in a Burial Environment |isbn=1-4200-6991-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two stages contribute to the [[chemical process of decomposition]], which breaks down the main components of the body. With death the microbiome of the living organism collapses and is followed by the [[necrobiome]] that undergoes predictable changes over time.

==== Fresh ====
Among those animals that have a heart, the "fresh" stage begins immediately after the heart stops beating. From the moment of death, the body begins cooling or warming to match the temperature of the ambient environment, during a stage called [[rigor mortis]].&lt;ref name=Janaway&gt;{{cite book |author=Janaway R.C., Percival S.L., Wilson A.S. | editor-first=S.L.| editor-last= Percival |title=Microbiology and Aging| publisher=Springer Science + Business |year=2009 |pages=13–334 |chapter=Decomposition of Human Remains |isbn= 1-58829-640-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly after death, within three to six hours, the muscular tissues become rigid and incapable of relaxing, during a stage called [[rigor mortis]]. Since blood is no longer being pumped through the body, [[gravity]] causes it to drain to the [[dependent portions of the body]], creating an overall bluish-purple discolouration termed [[livor mortis]] or, more commonly, lividity.

Once the heart stops, the [[blood]] can no longer supply [[oxygen]] or remove [[carbon dioxide]] from the tissues. The resulting decrease in pH and other chemical changes causes cells to lose their [[structural integrity]], bringing about the release of cellular enzymes capable of initiating the breakdown of surrounding cells and tissues. This process is known as [[Autolysis (biology)|autolysis]].

Visible changes caused by decomposition are limited during the fresh stage, although autolysis may cause blisters to appear at the surface of the skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Knight |first=Bernard |title= [[Forensic pathology]] |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1991 |isbn=0-19-520903-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The small amount of oxygen remaining in the body is quickly depleted by cellular [[metabolism]] and [[aerobic organism|aerobic microbes]] naturally present in [[respiratory tract|respiratory]] and [[gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal]] tracts, creating an ideal environment for the proliferation of [[anaerobic organism]]s. These multiply, consuming the body's [[carbohydrate]]s, [[lipid]]s, and [[protein]]s, to produce a variety of substances including [[propionic acid]], [[lactic acid]], [[methane]], [[hydrogen sulfide]], and [[ammonia]]. The process of microbial proliferation within a body is referred to as [[putrefaction]] and leads to the second stage of decomposition, known as bloat.&lt;ref name= Carterjournal&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Carter D.O., Yellowlees |author2=D., Tibbett M. |title= Cadaver decomposition in terrestrial ecosystems|journal= Naturwissenschaften|volume= 94|issue= 1|pages= 12–24|year=2007|pmid= 17091303|doi=10.1007/s00114-006-0159-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Calliphoridae|Blowflies]] and [[Flesh-fly|flesh flies]] are the first carrion insects to arrive, and they seek a suitable [[oviposition]] site.&lt;ref name=Payne/&gt;

==== {{anchor|Bloat|bloat|Bloat stage|Bloated|bloated|bloating|Bloating}} Bloat ====
The bloat stage provides the first clear visual sign that microbial proliferation is underway. In this stage, anaerobic metabolism takes place, leading to the accumulation of gases, such as [[hydrogen sulphide|hydrogen sulfide]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]], and [[nitrogen]]. The accumulation of gases within the bodily cavity causes the distention of the abdomen and gives a cadaver its overall bloated appearance.&lt;ref name= Carterbook&gt;{{cite book |author1=Carter D.O. |author2=Tibbett M. |editor1=M. Tibbett |editor2=D.O. Carter |title=Soil Analysis in Forensic Taphonomy|publisher=CRC Press |year=2008 |pages=29–51 |chapter=Cadaver Decomposition and Soil: Processes |isbn=1-4200-6991-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The gases produced also cause natural liquids and liquefying tissues to become frothy.&lt;ref name= Janaway/&gt;  As the pressure of the gases within the body increases, fluids are forced to escape from natural orifices, such as the nose, mouth, and anus, and enter the surrounding environment.  The buildup of pressure combined with the loss of integrity of the skin may also cause the body to rupture.&lt;ref name= Carterbook/&gt;

Intestinal anaerobic bacteria transform [[haemoglobin]] into [[sulfhemoglobin]] and other colored pigments.  The associated gases which accumulate within the body at this time aid in the transport of sulfhemoglobin throughout the body via the [[Circulatory system|circulatory]] and [[lymphatic system]]s, giving the body an overall marbled appearance.&lt;ref name= Pinheiro&gt;{{cite book|last=Pinheiro|first=J.|editor= A. Schmidt |editor2=E. Cumha |editor3=J. Pinheiro|title= Forensic Anthropology and Medicine|publisher= Humana Press|year=2006|pages= 85–116|chapter= Decay Process of a Cadaver|isbn=1-58829-824-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If insects have access, [[maggot]]s hatch and begin to feed on the body's tissues.&lt;ref name= Payne/&gt;  Maggot activity, typically confined to natural orifices, and masses under the skin, causes the skin to slip, and hair to detach from the skin.&lt;ref name= Janaway/&gt;  Maggot feeding, and the accumulation of gases within the body, eventually leads to post-mortem skin ruptures which will then further allow purging of gases and fluids into the surrounding environment.&lt;ref name= Carterjournal/&gt;  Ruptures in the skin allow oxygen to re-enter the body and provide more surface area for the development of fly larvae and the activity of aerobic microorganisms.&lt;ref name= Carterbook/&gt;  The purging of gases and fluids results in the strong distinctive odors associated with decay.&lt;ref name= Payne/&gt;

==== Active decay ====
Active decay is characterized by the period of greatest mass loss. This loss occurs as a result of both the voracious feeding of maggots and the purging of decomposition fluids into the surrounding environment.&lt;ref name= Carterbook/&gt;  The purged fluids accumulate around the body and create a cadaver decomposition island (CDI).  Liquefaction of tissues and disintegration become apparent during this time and strong odors persist.&lt;ref name= Payne/&gt;  The end of active decay is signaled by the migration of maggots away from the body to pupate.&lt;ref name= Carterjournal/&gt;

==== Advanced decay ====
Decomposition is largely inhibited during advanced decay due to the loss of readily available cadaveric material.&lt;ref name= Carterbook/&gt;  Insect activity is also reduced during this stage.&lt;ref name= Janaway/&gt;  When the carcass is located on soil, the area surrounding it will show evidence of [[vegetation]] death.&lt;ref name= Carterbook/&gt;  The CDI surrounding the carcass will display an increase in soil carbon and nutrients, such as [[phosphorus]], [[potassium]], [[calcium]], and [[magnesium]];&lt;ref name= Carterjournal/&gt; changes in pH; and a significant increase in soil [[nitrogen]].&lt;ref name= Vass&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Vass A.A. |author2=Bass W.M. |author3=volt J.D. |author4=Foss J.E. |author5=Ammons J.T. |title= Time since death determinations of human cadavers using soil solution|journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences|volume=37|pages= 1236–1253|year=1992|pmid= 1402750|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Dry/remains ====
During the dry/remains stage, the resurgence of plant growth around the CDI may occur and is a sign that the nutrients present in the surrounding soil have not yet returned to their normal levels.&lt;ref name= Carterbook/&gt;  All that remains of the cadaver at this stage is dry skin, [[cartilage]], and [[bone]]s,&lt;ref name=Payne/&gt; which will become dry and bleached if exposed to the elements.&lt;ref name= Janaway/&gt;  If all soft tissue is removed from the cadaver, it is referred to as completely [[Skeletonization (forensics)|skeletonized]], but if only portions of the bones are exposed, it is referred to as partially skeletonised.&lt;ref name=Dent&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Dent B.B. |author2=Forbes S.L. |author3=Stuart B.H. |title= Review of human decomposition processes in soil|journal=Environmental Geology|volume=45| pages=576–585| doi = 10.1007/s00254-003-0913-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Factors affecting decomposition of bodies ==
{{Further|Environmental effects on forensic entomology}}
{{more citations needed|date=November 2013}}

=== Exposure to the elements ===
A dead body that has been exposed to the open elements, such as water and air, will decompose more quickly and attract much more [[insect]] activity than a body that is buried or confined in special protective gear or artifacts. This is due, in part, to the limited number of insects that can penetrate a coffin and the lower temperatures under soil.

The rate and manner of decomposition in an animal body is strongly affected by several factors. In roughly descending degrees of importance, they are:
* [[Temperature]];
* The availability of [[oxygen]];
* Prior [[embalming]];
* [[List of causes of death by rate|Cause of death]];
* [[Burial]], depth of burial, and soil type;
* Access by [[scavenger]]s;
* [[Physical trauma|Trauma]], including [[wound]]s and crushing blows;
* [[Humidity]], or wetness;
* [[Rain]]fall;
* Body size and weight;
* [[Clothing]];
* The surface on which the body rests;
* Foods/objects inside the specimen's [[digestive tract]] (bacon compared to lettuce).

The speed at which decomposition occurs varies greatly. Factors such as temperature, humidity, and the season of death all determine how fast a fresh body will skeletonize or mummify. A basic guide for the effect of environment on decomposition is given as Casper's Law (or Ratio): if all other factors are equal, then, when there is free access of air a body decomposes twice as fast than if immersed in water and eight times faster than if buried in earth. Ultimately, the rate of bacterial decomposition acting on the tissue will depend upon the temperature of the surroundings. Colder temperatures decrease the rate of decomposition while warmer temperatures increase it. A dry body will not decompose efficiently. Moisture helps the growth of microorganisms that decompose the organic matter, but too much moisture could lead to anaerobic conditions slowing down the decomposition process.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/earthkind/landscape/dont-bag-it/chapter-1-the-decomposition-process/|title=Chapter 1, The Decomposition Process {{!}}  Earth-Kind® Landscaping|website=aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important variable is a body's accessibility to insects, particularly flies. On the surface in tropical areas, invertebrates alone can easily reduce a fully fleshed corpse to clean bones in under two weeks. The skeleton itself is not permanent; [[acid]]s in [[soil]]s can reduce it to unrecognizable components. This is one reason given for the lack of human remains found in the wreckage of the [[RMS Titanic|''Titanic'']], even in parts of the ship considered inaccessible to scavengers. Freshly skeletonized bone is often called "green" bone and has a characteristic greasy feel. Under certain conditions (normally cool, damp soil), bodies may undergo [[saponification]] and develop a waxy substance called [[adipocere]], caused by the action of soil chemicals on the body's [[protein]]s and [[fat]]s. The formation of adipocere slows decomposition by inhibiting the bacteria that cause putrefaction.

In extremely dry or cold conditions, the normal process of decomposition is halted&amp;nbsp;– by either lack of moisture or temperature controls on bacterial and enzymatic action&amp;nbsp;– causing the body to be preserved as a [[mummy]]. Frozen mummies commonly restart the decomposition process when thawed (see [[Ötzi the Iceman]]), whilst heat-desiccated mummies remain so unless exposed to moisture.

The bodies of newborns who never ingested food are an important exception to the normal process of decomposition. They lack the internal microbial flora that produce much of decomposition and quite commonly mummify if kept in even moderately dry conditions.

=== Anaerobic vs Aerobic ===
Aerobic decomposition takes place in the presence of oxygen. This is most common to occur in nature. Living organisms that use oxygen to survive feed on the body. Anaerobic decomposition takes place in the absence of oxygen. This could be place where the body is buried in organic material and oxygen can not reach it. This process of putrefaction has a bad odor accompanied by it due to the hydrogen sulfide and organic matter containing sulfur.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Artificial preservation  ===
[[Embalming]] is the practice of delaying decomposition of human and animal remains. Embalming slows decomposition somewhat, but does not forestall it indefinitely. Embalmers typically pay great attention to parts of the body seen by mourners, such as the face and hands. The chemicals used in embalming repel most insects, and slow down bacterial putrefaction by either killing existing bacteria in or on the body themselves or by "fixing" cellular proteins, which means that they cannot act as a nutrient source for subsequent bacterial infections. In sufficiently dry environments, an embalmed body may end up [[mummy|mummified]] and it is not uncommon for bodies to remain preserved to a viewable extent after decades. Notable viewable embalmed bodies include those of:

=== Environmental preservation ===
A body buried in a sufficiently dry environment may be well preserved for decades. This was observed in the case for murdered [[civil rights]] activist [[Medgar Evers]], who was found to be almost perfectly preserved over 30 years after his death, permitting an accurate [[autopsy]] when the case of his murder was re-opened in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Quigley | first=C. | title=Modern Mummies: The Preservation of the Human Body in the Twentieth Century | publisher=McFarland | year=1998 | pages=213–214 | isbn=0-7864-0492-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bodies submerged in a [[peat]] [[bog]] may become naturally "embalmed", arresting decomposition and resulting in a preserved specimen known as a [[bog body]]. The time for an embalmed body to be reduced to a [[skeleton]] varies greatly. Even when a body is decomposed, embalming treatment can still be achieved (the arterial system decays more slowly) but would not restore a natural appearance without extensive reconstruction and cosmetic work, and is largely used to control the foul odors due to decomposition.

An animal can be preserved almost perfectly, for millions of years in a resin such as amber.

There are some examples where bodies have been inexplicably preserved (with no human intervention) for decades or centuries and appear almost the same as when they died. In some religious groups, this is known as [[incorruptibility]]. It is not known whether or for how long a body can stay free of decay without artificial preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://people.howstuffworks.com/incorruptible.htm |title=How can a corpse be incorruptible? |first=Josh |last=Clark |publisher=HowStuffWorks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Importance to forensic sciences ===
{{Further|Forensic entomological decomposition}}

Various sciences study the decomposition of bodies under the general rubric of [[forensic science]] because the usual motive for such studies is to determine the time and cause of death for [[law|legal]] purposes:
* Forensic taphonomy specifically studies the processes of decomposition in order to apply the biological and chemical principles to forensic cases in order to determine [[post-mortem interval]] (PMI), post-burial interval as well as to locate clandestine graves.
* [[Forensic pathology]] studies the clues to the cause of death found in the corpse as a [[medicine|medical]] phenomenon.
* [[Forensic entomology]] studies the insects and other [[vermin]] found in corpses; the sequence in which they appear, the kinds of insects, and where they are found in their life cycle are clues that can shed light on the time of death, the length of a corpse's exposure, and whether the corpse was moved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Smith | first=KGV. | title=A Manual of Forensic Entomology | publisher=Cornell Univ.

* [[Forensic anthropology]] is the medico-legal branch of [[physical anthropology]] that studies skeletons and human remains, usually to seek clues as to the identity, age, sex, height and ethnicity of their former owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Schmitt | first=A. |author2=Cunha, E.|author3=Pinheiro, J. | title=Forensic Anthropology and Medicine: Complementary Sciences From Recovery to Cause of Death | publisher=Humana Press | year=2006 | pages=464 | isbn=1-58829-824-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Haglund | first=WD. |author2=Sorg, MH. | title=Forensic Taphonomy: The Postmortem Fate of Human Remains | publisher=CRC Press | year=1996 | pages=636 | isbn=0-8493-9434-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Tennessee Anthropological Research Facility]] (better known as the Body Farm) in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]] has a number of bodies laid out in various situations in a fenced-in plot near the medical center. Scientists at the [[Body Farm]] study how the human body decays in various circumstances to gain a better understanding of decomposition.

== Plant decomposition ==

Decomposition of plant matter occurs in many stages. It begins with leaching by water; the most easily lost and soluble carbon compounds are liberated in this process. Another early process is physical breakup or fragmentation of the plant material into smaller bits which have greater surface area for [[microbial]] colonization and attack. In smaller dead plants, this process is largely carried out by the soil invertebrate fauna, whereas in the larger plants, primarily parasitic life-forms such as insects and fungi play a major breakdown role and are not assisted by numerous [[detritivore]] species.

Following this, the plant [[detritus]] (consisting of [[cellulose]], [[hemicellulose]], microbial products, and [[lignin]]) undergoes[[File:Decomposition of leafs .jpg|200XPpx|frameless|left|leafs decomposing after time goes on]] chemical alteration by microbes. Different types of compounds decompose at different rates. This is dependent on their [[chemical structure]].

For instance, [[lignin]] is a component of wood, which is relatively resistant to decomposition and can in fact only be decomposed by certain [[fungi]], such as the black-rot fungi. Wood decomposition is a complex process involving fungi which transport nutrients to the nutritionally scarce wood from outside environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Filipiak|first=Michał|last2=Sobczyk|first2=Łukasz|last3=Weiner|first3=January|date=2016-04-09|title=Fungal Transformation of Tree Stumps into a Suitable Resource for Xylophagous Beetles via Changes in Elemental Ratios|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2075-4450/7/2/13|journal=Insects|language=en|volume=7|issue=2|pages=13|doi=10.3390/insects7020013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this nutritional enrichment the fauna of [[Xylophagy|saproxylic]] insects may develop&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Filipiak|first=Michał|last2=Weiner|first2=January|date=2016-09-01|title=Nutritional dynamics during the development of xylophagous beetles related to changes in the stoichiometry of 11 elements|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/phen.12168/abstract|doi-access=free|journal=Physiological Entomology|language=en|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.1111/phen.12168|issn=1365-3032}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in turn affect dead wood, contributing to wood decomposition and nutrient cycling in the forest floor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lignin is one such remaining product of decomposing plants with a very complex chemical structure causing the rate of microbial breakdown to slow.

In most [[grassland]] ecosystems, natural damage from [[fire]], insects that feed on decaying matter, [[termite]]s, [[grazing]] mammals, and the physical movement of animals through the grass are the primary agents of breakdown and [[nutrient cycling]], while bacteria and fungi play the main roles in further decomposition.

The chemical aspects of plant decomposition always involve the release of [[carbon dioxide]]. In fact, decomposition contributes over 90 percent of carbon dioxide released each year.&lt;ref name="mit"/&gt;

== Food decomposition ==
{{Main|Meat spoilage}}
{{Expand section|information from the main article|date=July 2010}}
The decomposition of food, either plant or animal, called ''spoilage'' in this context, is an important field of study within [[food science]]. Food decomposition can be slowed down by [[food conservation|conservation]]. The spoilage of meat occurs, if the meat is untreated, in a matter of hours or days and results in the meat becoming unappetizing, poisonous or infectious. Spoilage is caused by the practically unavoidable infection and subsequent decomposition of meat by bacteria and fungi, which are borne by the animal itself, by the people handling the meat, and by their implements. Meat can be kept edible for a much longer time&amp;nbsp;– though not indefinitely&amp;nbsp;– if proper hygiene is observed during production and processing, and if appropriate food safety, food preservation and food storage procedures are applied.

Spoilage of food is attributed to contamination from microorganisms such as bacteria, molds, and yeasts, along with natural decay of the food.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Food and nutrition|last=Anita|first=Tull|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1997|isbn=978-0-19-832766-0|location=|pages=154, 155|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These decomposition bacteria reproduce at rapid rates under conditions of moisture and preferred temperatures. When the proper conditions are lacking the bacteria may form spores which lurk until suitable conditions arise to continue reproduction.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Rate of decomposition==

The rate of decomposition is governed by three sets of factors—the physical environment (temperature, moisture and soil properties), the quantity and quality of the dead material available to decomposers, and the nature of the microbial community itself.&lt;ref name="Chapin159"&gt;{{cite book|title=Principles of Terrestrial Ecosystem Ecology|last=Chapin|first=F. Stuart|author2=Pamela A. Matson|author3=Harold A. Mooney|publisher=Springer|year=2002|isbn=0-387-95443-0|location=New York|pages=159–174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decomposition rates are low under very wet or very dry conditions. Decomposition rates are highest in wet, moist conditions with adequate levels of oxygen. Wet soils tend to become deficient in oxygen (this is especially true in [[wetland]]s), which slows microbial growth. In dry soils, decomposition slows as well, but bacteria continue to grow (albeit at a slower rate) even after soils become too dry to support plant growth.  When the rains return and soils become wet, the [[osmotic gradient]] between the bacterial cells and the soil water causes the cells to gain water quickly. Under these conditions, many bacterial cells burst, releasing a pulse of nutrients.&lt;ref name = "Chapin159"/&gt; Decomposition rates also tend to be slower in acidic soils.&lt;ref name = "Chapin159"/&gt; Soils which are rich in [[clay minerals]] tend to have lower decomposition rates, and thus, higher levels of organic matter.&lt;ref name = "Chapin159"/&gt; The smaller particles of clay result in a larger surface area that can hold water. The higher the water content of a soil, the lower the oxygen content&lt;ref name="Chapin61"&gt;{{cite book|title=Principles of Terrestrial Ecosystem Ecology|last=Chapin|first=F. Stuart|author2=Pamela A. Matson|author3=Harold A. Mooney|publisher=Springer|year=2002|isbn=0-387-95443-0|location=New York|pages=61–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; and consequently, the lower the rate of decomposition. Clay minerals also bind particles of organic material to their surface, making them less accessible to microbes.&lt;ref name = "Chapin159"/&gt; Soil disturbance like [[tillage|tilling]] increases decomposition by increasing the amount of oxygen in the soil and by exposing new organic matter to soil microbes.&lt;ref name = "Chapin159"/&gt;

The quality and quantity of the material available to decomposers is another major factor that influences the rate of decomposition. Substances like sugars and amino acids decompose readily and are considered labile. [[Cellulose]] and [[hemicellulose]], which are broken down more slowly, are "moderately labile". Compounds which are more resistant to decay, like lignin or [[cutin]], are considered recalcitrant.&lt;ref name = "Chapin159"/&gt; Litter with a higher proportion of labile compounds decomposes much more rapidly than does litter with a higher proportion of recalcitrant material. Consequently, dead animals decompose more rapidly than dead leaves, which themselves decompose more rapidly than fallen branches.&lt;ref name = "Chapin159"/&gt; As organic material in the soil ages, its quality decreases. The more labile compounds decompose quickly, leaving an increasing proportion of recalcitrant material. Microbial cell walls also contain recalcitrant materials like [[chitin]], and these also accumulate as the microbes die, further reducing the quality of older [[soil organic matter]].&lt;ref name = "Chapin159"/&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

'''Donald M. Baer''' was a [[psychologist]] who contributed to the science of [[applied behavior analysis]] and pioneered the development of behavior analysis at two separate institutions. Baer is best known for his contributions at the [[University of Kansas]]. Throughout his career, he published over two hundred articles, books, and chapters on various psychological issues.  Some of his most noteworthy contributions include literature on behavior-analytic theory, experimental design, and early childhood interventions. Baer received numerous awards during his lifetime which acknowledged his innovation and dedication to his field of research.

==Background information==
Donald M. Baer was born in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] on October 25, 1931.  His family later moved to [[Chicago, Illinois]].  Baer attended the [[University of Chicago]] and received his doctoral degree in 1957 under the direction of Jacob L. Gewirtz (Poulson, 2002).  After graduation, Baer began working with [[Sidney W. Bijou]] at the [[University of Washington]].  Baer was soon offered a faculty position at the University of Kansas where he remained until his death on April 28, 2002.  He is survived by his wife Elsie Pinkston and his three daughters.

==Early work==
Collectively, Baer and Bijou established the behavior analysis approach to child development at the [[University of Washington]] (Anonymous, 2002). From 1957 to 1965, Baer and Bijou conducted an array of research on the effects of [[reinforcement]] contingencies on children (Anonymous, 2002). An influential paper titled "Effect of withdrawal of positive reinforcement on an extinguishing response in young children" was written during this time (Baer, 1961).  This research article established the effectiveness of "withdrawal of positive reinforcement" as a means of reducing behavior(Baer, 1961., p.&amp;nbsp;1).

While at the University of Washington, Baer made another noteworthy research paper on the escape and avoidance behaviors of preschool children (Baer, 1960).  Unfortunately, Baer and his research associates became involved in a "typical Psychology civil war" at the University of Washington (Baer, 1993., pp.&amp;nbsp;570).  The war stemmed from the administration's "intolerance of [[B. F. Skinner|Skinnerian]] perspectives and the rejection of research using single-subject designs." (Horowitz, 2002., pp.&amp;nbsp;313). Seeking a university environment more welcoming of behavior analysis, Don Baer found his way to the newly formed Human Development and Family Life Department at the University of Kansas.

The establishment of the Human Development and Family Life Department (HDFL) at the [[University of Kansas]] is a somewhat turbulent chain of events. The following comes from Baer (1993), unless otherwise stated.  Due to various professors retiring, the University of Kansas decided to dissolve its Home Economics Department in the early 1960s.  As a result, over $2 million in funding remained unused.  A recently acquired academic researcher, Frances Horowitz, pleaded to the Kansas administration to simply transform the Home Economics Department into the Department of Human Development and Family Life (HDFL).  The Home Economics Department was already a well known childhood research center. The administration agreed and appointed Horowitz chair of the department.  Horowitz assumed the task of recruiting researchers.  Horowitz and Donald Baer had conversed at APA meetings for years and became great friends.  At an APA meeting in Los Angeles, Horowitz asked Baer if he would be "interested in a challenge" (Baer, 1993. pp.&amp;nbsp;570).  The challenge Horowitz was referring to was establishing a new doctoral program from the ground up.  Don Baer remained at the department and began expanding the program to the highest degree.

==A fresh start==
At the University of Kansas, Baer began recruiting behavioral researchers for his newly formed department (Glover, pp.&amp;nbsp;146).  Among those recruited, Baer began research with Montrose M. Wolf, Todd R. Risley, and James A. Sherman.  The fruits of their research yielded the development of the discipline of applied behavior analysis (ABA) at the University of Kansas late in the 1960s.  Applied behavior analysis concentrates on "empirically-based interventions into problems of individual, social, and cultural importance" (Anonymous, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;1).  This discipline provided a structure for working with developmentally delayed children and adults. According to Glover (1987), Baer established at Kansas "one of the outstanding centers for research in applied behavior analysis" (pp.&amp;nbsp;146).

The following comes from Colman (1994), unless otherwise stated.  Shortly after the establishment of ABA program, the first journal, Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, dedicated to the discipline was published in 1968.   In the first issue, Baer, Wolf, and Risley (1968) published "Some current dimensions of applied behavior analysis".  This groundbreaking article named seven definitive dimensions to the approach of behavior analysis. The seven dimensions state that "work in the field should be applied, behavioral, analytic, technological, conceptually systematic, effective and capable of generalized effects." (pp.&amp;nbsp;406). Twenty years later, Baer et al. published an updated version, "Some still current dimensions of applied behavior analysis" (pp.&amp;nbsp;406).  The seven dimensions had not changed, only elaborated on, throughout the years.

==Later work==

The following comes from Hains (1989), unless otherwise stated. Baer published hundreds of articles and books.  He coauthored a paper with an associate, Ann H. Hains, in 1989 on experimental design entitled "Interaction effects in multi-element designs: Inevitable, desirable, and ignorable".  In this paper, Baer addressed the single mindedness of the authors of single-subject research design books.  He stated that these researchers only investigated the effectiveness of treatments in alteration and never examined whether the treatments interact.  Baer proposed that single subject designs can and should be used to study not only separate effects but also interactions between the two conditions.  Don Baer always seemed to be thinking ahead of his time.

Developing new techniques and approaches for teaching developmentally delayed children was Baer's passion (Anonymous, 2002).  He wrote many articles analyzing the current public education system and ways to improve their methods (Anonymous, 2002). The following comes from Warren et al. (1981), unless otherwise stated.  One of his most read articles is titled "Generalization and maintenance of question-asking by severely retarded individuals".  This article states the importance of establishing question asking strategies with developmentally delayed children.

Normal children develop simple question-asking (e.g. "What's that") in early infancy (pp.&amp;nbsp;15).  Severely retarded children usually have great difficulty developing this skill.  Initial training for this strategy is costly and time consuming for school systems.  Despite the vast amount of time spent with the children, they can easily lose this ability.  Baer and colleagues urged school systems to establish maintenance programs to help developmentally delayed children to continue and improve on their question-asking strategy.  By maintaining this ability with the children, they will not only improve question-asking but save the school system valuable time and money from remedial training.

==Honors==
Donald M. Baer was an influential leader of the department of Applied Behavior Science at the University of Kansas.  He advised over 100 doctoral students while at Kansas, in addition to countless other graduate students.  He contributed to the Bureau of Child Research, now known as the Schiefelbusch Lifespan Institute (LSI).  The program was successful, receiving years of funding from the National Institute of Mental Health.  The Institute was also the first to obtain an award from the Society for the Advancement of Behavior Analysis (SABA) for its contributions to the field.

==Awards==
Baer won the Edgar A. Doll Award for his assistance to those with developmental disorders.  In 1987 he was awarded the Don Hake Award from Division 25 of the American Psychological Association.  In 1997, he won the award for Distinguished Service to Behavior Analysis from SABA.  Baer served as president of the Society for the Experimental Analysis of Behavior from 1983 to 1984.  He served as an editor for the Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis (1970–1971).  As well as serving as an associated editor of the American Journal of Mental Deficiency.  Baer also spent much time traveling to other countries, including [[Australia]], [[Japan]], and [[Spain]], while serving as a distinguished visiting professor.

He died April 28, 2002 of [[heart failure]] in [[Lawrence, Kansas]].  His ashes are buried at Pioneer Cemetery in Lawrence, Kansas.

The English term '''''enlightenment''''' is the western translation of the abstract noun '''''bodhi''''', ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|oʊ|d|i}}; [[Sanskrit]]: [[wikt:बोधि#Sanskrit|बोधि]]; [[Pali]]: ''bodhi''), the knowledge or wisdom, or awakened intellect, of a Buddha.&lt;ref name="MN_bodhi"/&gt; The verbal root ''budh-'' means "to awaken," and its literal meaning is closer to "awakening." Although its most common usage is in the context of [[Buddhism]], the term ''[[buddhi]]'' is also used in other Indian philosophies and traditions. The term "enlightenment" was popularised in the Western world through the 19th century translations of [[Max Müller]]. It has the western connotation of a sudden insight into a transcendental truth or reality.

The term is also being used to translate several other Buddhist terms and concepts, which are used to denote insight (''[[Wisdom in Buddhism|prajna]]'', ''[[kensho]]'' and ''[[satori]]'');{{sfn|Fischer-Schreiber|2008|p=5051, lemma "bodhi"}} knowledge (''[[vidhya]]''); the "blowing out" (''[[Nirvana (Buddhism)|Nirvana]]'') of disturbing emotions and desires and the subsequent freedom or release (''[[vimutti]]''); and the attainment of [[Buddhahood]], as exemplified by [[Gautama Buddha]].

What exactly constituted the Buddha's awakening is unknown. It may probably have involved the knowledge that liberation was attained by the combination of mindfulness and ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyāna]]'', applied to the understanding of the arising and ceasing of craving. The relation between ''dhyana'' and insight is a core problem in the study of Buddhism, and is one of the fundamentals of Buddhist practice.

In the western world the concept of [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|(spiritual) enlightenment]] has taken on a romantic meaning. It has become synonymous with [[self-realization]] and the [[true self and false self]], being regarded as a substantial essence being covered over by social conditioning.{{sfn|Carrette|King|2005}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;sup&gt;, &lt;/sup&gt;{{sfn|Sharf|1995b}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;sup&gt;, &lt;/sup&gt;{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;sup&gt;, &lt;/sup&gt;{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

==Etymology==
''Bodhi'', [[Sanskrit]] बोधि,&lt;ref name="SDSS_bodhi"&gt;Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit, [http://spokensanskrit.org/index.php?mode=3&amp;script=hk&amp;tran_input=bodhi&amp;direct=au ''bodhi'']&lt;/ref&gt; "awakening,"{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=50}} "perfect knowledge,"&lt;ref name="SDSS_bodhi"/&gt; "perfect knowledge or wisdom (by which a man becomes a बुद्ध [Buddha&lt;ref name="SDSS_budh"/&gt;] or जिन [''jina'', ''arahant''; "victorious," "victor"&lt;ref&gt;Monier Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary, [http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/monier/indexcaller.php ''jina'']&lt;/ref&gt;], the illuminated or enlightened intellect (of a Buddha or जिन)."&lt;ref name="MN_bodhi"&gt;Monier Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary, [http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/monier/indexcaller.php ''bodhi'']&lt;/ref&gt;

It is an [[abstract noun]], formed from the verbal root ''*budh-'',{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=50}} Sanskrit बुध,&lt;ref name="SDSS_budh"&gt;Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit, [http://spokensanskrit.org/index.php?mode=3&amp;script=hk&amp;tran_input=budh&amp;direct=au ''budh'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MW_budh"/&gt; "to awaken, to know,"{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=50}} "to wake , wake up , be awake,"&lt;ref name="MW_budh"&gt;Monier Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary, [http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/monier/indexcaller.php ''budh'']&lt;/ref&gt; "to recover consciousness (after a swoon),"&lt;ref name="MW_budh"/&gt; "to observe , heed , attend to."&lt;ref name="MW_budh"/&gt;

It corresponds to the verbs ''bujjhati'' (Pāli) and ''bodhati'', बोदति, "become or be aware of, perceive, learn, know, understand, awake"&lt;ref&gt;Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit, [http://spokensanskrit.org/index.php?mode=3&amp;script=hk&amp;tran_input=bodhati&amp;direct=au ''bodhati'']&lt;/ref&gt;or ''budhyate'' (Sanskrit).

The feminine Sanskrit noun of ''*budh-'' is बुद्धि, ''[[buddhi]]'', "prescience, intuition, perception, point of view."&lt;ref name="SDSS_budh"/&gt;

==Translation==
Robert S. Cohen notes that the majority of English books on Buddhism use the term "enlightenment" to translate the term ''bodhi''.{{sfn|Cohen|2006|p=1}} The root ''budh'', from which both ''bodhi'' and ''Buddha'' are derived, means "to wake up" or "to recover consciousness".{{sfn|Cohen|2006|p=1}} Cohen notes that ''bodhi'' is not the result of an ''[[Illuminationism|illumination]]'', but of a path of realization, or coming to understanding.{{sfn|Cohen|2006|p=1}} The term "enlightenment" is event-oriented, whereas the term "awakening" is process-oriented.{{sfn|Cohen|2006|p=1}} The western use of the term "enlighten" has Christian roots, as in Calvin's "It is God alone who enlightens our minds to perceive his truths".{{sfn|Cohen|2006|p=2}}

Early 19th century ''bodhi'' was translated as "intelligence".{{sfn|Cohen|2006|p=2}} The term "enlighten" was first being used in 1835, in an English translation of a French article,{{sfn|Cohen|2006|p=2-3}} while the first recorded use of the term 'enlightenment' is credited (by the Oxford English Dictionary) to the ''Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal'' (February, 1836). In 1857 ''The Times'' used the term "the Enlightened" for the Buddha in a short article, which was reprinted the following year by [[Max Müller]].{{sfn|Cohen|2006|p=3}} Thereafter, the use of the term subsided, but reappeared with the publication of Max Müller's ''Chips from a german Workshop'', which included a reprint from the ''Times''-article. The book was translated in 1969 into German, using the term "der Erleuchtete".{{sfn|Cohen|2006|p=9}} Max Müller was an [[Perennial philosophy|essentialist]], who believed in a [[natural religion]], and saw religion as an inherent capacity of human beings.{{sfn|Cohen|2006|p=4}} "Enlightenment" was a means to capture natural religious truths, as distinguished from mere mythology.{{sfn|Cohen|2006|p=6-7}}{{refn|group=note|See also [http://www.here-now4u.de/eng/theosophy_or_pantheism__friedr.htm Lourens Peter van den Bosch, ''Theosophy or Pantheism? Friedrich Max Müller's Gifford Lectures on Natural Religion'']: "The three principal themes of his Gifford lectures on natural religion were the discovery of God, the discovery of the soul, and the discovery of the oneness of God and soul in the great religions of the world."}}

By the mid-1870s it had become commonplace to call the Buddha "enlightened", and by the end of the 1880s the terms "enlightened" and "enlightenment" dominated the English literature.{{sfn|Cohen|2006|p=3}}

===Insight===

====Bodhi====
''[[Bodhi]]'' (Sanskrit, Pāli), from the verbal root ''budd'', "to awaken", "to understand",{{sfn|Nyanatiloka|1980|p=40}} means literally "to have woken up and understood".{{sfn|Schreiber-Fischer|2008|p=50}} According to [[Johannes Bronkhorst]],{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}} Tillman Vetter,{{sfn|Vetter|1988}} and K.R. Norman,{{sfn|Norman|1997|p=29}} ''bodhi'' was at first not specified. K.R. Norman:
{{quote|It is not at all clear what gaining ''bodhi'' means. We are accustomed to the translation "enlightenment" for ''bodhi'', but this is misleading ... It is not clear what the buddha was awakened to, or at what particular point the awakening came.&lt;ref name="Norman2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Norman|first=K. R.|title=Buddhist Forum Volume V: Philological Approach to Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qYyRAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA25|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-75154-8|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;!--{{sfn|Norman|1997|p=29}}--&gt;

According to Norman, ''bodhi'' may basically have meant the knowledge that ''nibbana'' was attained,{{sfn|Norman|1997|p=30}}{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxix, xxxi}} due to the practice of ''dhyana''.{{sfn|Norman|1997|p=29}}{{sfn|Vetter|1988}} Originally only "prajna" may have been mentioned,{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}} and Tillman Vetter even concludes that originally dhyana itself was deemed liberating, with the stilling of pleasure of pain in the fourth jhana, not the gaining of some perfect wisdom or insight.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}} Gombrich also argues that the emphasis on insight is a later development.{{sfn|Gombrich|1997}}

In [[Theravada]] Buddhism, ''bodhi'' refers to the realisation of the [[four stages of enlightenment]] and becoming an  [[Arahant]].{{sfn|Schreiber-Fischer|2008|p=50}} In Theravada Buddhism, ''bodhi'' is equal to supreme insight, and the realisation of the four noble truths, which leads to deliverance.{{sfn|Schreiber-Fischer|2008|p=50}} According to Nyanatiloka,
{{quote|(Through Bodhi) one awakens from the slumber or stupor (inflicted upon the mind) by the defilements (''[[Kleshas (Buddhism)|kilesa]]'', q.v.) and comprehends the [[Four Noble Truths]] (''[[sacca]]'', q.v.)''.{{sfn|Nyanatiloka|1980|p=40}}}}

This equation of ''bodhi'' with the four noble truths is a later development, in response to developments within Indian religious thought, where "liberating insight" was deemed essential for [[Moksha|liberation]].{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}{{sfn|Vetter|1988}} The four noble truths as the liberating insight of the Buddha eventually were superseded by [[Pratītyasamutpāda]], the twelvefold chain of causation, and still later by anatta, the emptiness of the self.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}

In [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, ''bodhi'' is equal to ''prajna'', insight into the [[Buddha-nature]], [[sunyata]] and [[tathatā]].{{sfn|Schreiber-Fischer|2008|p=51}} This is equal to the realisation of the non-duality of [[Two truths doctrine|absolute and relative]].{{sfn|Schreiber-Fischer|2008|p=51}}

====Prajna====
In Theravada Buddhism ''pannā'' (Pali) means "understanding", "wisdom", "insight".{{sfn|Nyanatiloka|1980|p=150}} "Insight" is equivalent to ''[[vipassana]]''', insight into the three marks of existence, namely ''[[anicca]]'', ''[[dukkha]]'' and ''[[anatta]]''.{{sfn|Nyanatiloka|1980|p=150}} Insight leads to the four stages of enlightenment and Nirvana.{{sfn|Nyanatiloka|1980|p=150}}

In Mahayana Buddhism [[Wisdom in Buddhism|Prajna]] (Sanskrit) means "insight" or "wisdom", and entails insight into ''sunyata''. The attainment of this insight is often seen as the attainment of  "enlightenment".{{sfn|Fischer-Schreiber|2008|p=281}}{{Request quotation|date=January 2015}}

====Kensho and satori====
''[[Kensho]]'' and ''[[Satori]]'' are Japanese terms used in [[Zen]] traditions. ''Kensho'' means "seeing into one's true nature." ''Ken'' means "seeing", ''sho'' means "nature", "essence",{{sfn|Kapleau|1989}} c.q Buddha-nature. ''Satori'' (Japanese) is often used interchangeably with kensho, but refers to the ''experience'' of kensho.{{sfn|Kapleau|1989}} The [[Rinzai school|Rinzai]] tradition sees ''kensho'' as essential to the attainment of [[Buddhahood]], but considers [[Hakuin#Four ways of knowing|further practice]] essential to attain Buddhahood.

East-Asian (Chinese) Buddhism emphasizes insight into Buddha-nature. This term is derived from Indian tathagata-garbha thought, "the womb of the thus-gone" (the Buddha), the inherent potential of every sentient being to become a Buddha. This idea was integrated with the Yogacara-idea of the ''ālaya vijñāna'', and further developed in Chinese Buddhism, which integrated Indian Buddhism with native Chinese thought. Buddha-nature came to mean both the potential of awakening ''and'' the whole of reality, a dynamic interpenetration of absolute and relative. In this awakening it is realized that observer and observed are not distinct entities, but mutually co-dependent.{{sfn|Lusthaus|1998}}{{sfn|Lai|2003}}

===Knowledge===
The term ''vidhya'' is being used in contrast to ''[[avidhya]]'', ignorance or the lack of knowledge, which binds us to [[samsara]]. The ''Mahasaccaka Sutta''{{refn|group=note|Majjhima Nikaya chapter 36}} describes the three knowledges which the Buddha attained:{{sfn|Bikkhu Nanamoli|1995|p=340-342}}{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=47–48}}{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=27}}
# Insight into his past lives
# Insight into the workings of [[Karma]] and [[Reincarnation]]
# Insight into the [[Four Noble Truths]]

According to Bronkhorst, the first two knowledges are later additions, while insight into the four truths represents a later development, in response to concurring religious traditions, in which "liberating insight" came to be stressed over the practice of ''dhyana''.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}

===Freedom===
Vimutti, also called moksha, means "freedom",{{sfn|Bowker|1997}} "release",{{sfn|Bowker|1997}}{{refn|group=note|See [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O101-Vimutti.html Encyclopedia.com, ''Vimutti'']}} "deliverance".{{sfn|Nyanatiloka|1980|p=239}} Sometimes a distinction is being made between ''ceto-vimutti'', "liberation of the mind", and ''panna-vimutti'', "liberation by understanding".{{sfn|Gombrich|2005|p=147}} The Buddhist tradition recognises two kinds of ''ceto-vimutti'', one temporarily and one permanent, the last being equivalent to ''panna-vimutti''.{{sfn|Gombrich|2005|p=147}}{{refn|group=note|According to Gombrich, this distinction is artificial, and due to later, too literal, interpretations of the suttas.{{sfn|Gombrich|2005|p=147-148}}}}

[[Yogacara]] uses the term ''āśraya parāvŗtti'', "revolution of the basis",{{sfn|Park|1983|p=126-132}} 
{{quote|... a sudden revulsion, turning, or re-turning of the [[Eight Consciousnesses#Ālayavijñāna|ālaya vijñāna]] back into its original state of purity [...] the Mind returns to its original condition of non-attachment, non-discrimination and non-duality".{{sfn|Park|1983|p=127}}}}

===Nirvana===
Nirvana is the "blowing out" of disturbing emotions, which is the same as liberation.&lt;ref group=web name="Berzin"&gt;[http://studybuddhism.com/web/en/archives/sutra/level2_lamrim/intermediate_scope/nirvana_enlightenment/transcript.html Dr. Alexander Berzin, ''Nirvana and enlightenment'']&lt;/ref&gt; The usage of the term "enlightenment" to translate "nirvana" was popularized in the 19th century, due, in part, to the efforts of Max Muller, who used the term consistently in his translations.{{sfn|Scott|2009|p=8}}

==Buddha's awakening==

===Buddhahood===
[[Buddhahood#The 3 Types of Buddhahood|Three types of buddha]] are recognized:{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=81}} 
* [[Arhat (Buddhism)|Arhat]] ([[Pali]]: ''arahant''), those who reach Nirvana by following the teachings of the Buddha.{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=81}} Sometimes the term [[Savakabuddha|Śrāvakabuddha]] (Pali: ''sāvakabuddha'') is used to designate this kind of awakened person{{citation needed|date=December 2011}};
* [[Pratyekabuddha]]s (Pali: ''paccekabuddha''), those who reach Nirvana through self-realisation, without the aid of spiritual guides and teachers, but don't teach the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]];{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=81}}
* Samyaksambuddha (Pali: ''samma sambuddha''), often simply referred to as ''Buddha'', one who has reached Nirvana by his own efforts and wisdom and teaches it skillfully to others.{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=81}}

[[Siddhartha Gautama]], known as the Buddha, is said to have achieved full awakening, known as ''samyaksaṃbodhi'' (Sanskrit; Pāli: ''sammāsaṃbodhi''), "perfect Buddhahood", or ''anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi'', "highest perfect awakening".{{sfn|Mäll|2005|p=83}}

The term buddha has acquired somewhat [[Buddhology|different meanings]] in the various Buddhist traditions. An equivalent term for [[Buddha]] is [[Tathāgata]], "the thus-gone". The [[Buddhist Paths to liberation|way to Buddhahood]] is somewhat differently understood in the various buddhist traditions.

===The awakening of the Buddha===

====Canonical accounts====
In the [[suttapitaka]], the Buddhist canon as preserved in the [[Theravada]] tradition, a couple of texts can be found in which the Buddha's attainment of liberation forms part of the narrative.{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=45-50}}&lt;ref name="faure_1991"&gt;{{harvcolnb|Faure|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|See Majjhima Nikaya chapter 4, 12, 26 &amp; 36}}

The ''Ariyapariyesana Sutta'' (Majjhima Nikaya 26) describes how the Buddha was dissatisfied with the teachings of [[Alara Kalama]] and [[Uddaka Ramaputta]], wandered further through Magadhan country, and then found "an agreeable piece of ground" which served for striving. The sutra then only says that he attained Nibbana.{{sfn|Bikkhu Nanamoli|1995|p=259}}

In the ''Vanapattha Sutta'' (Majjhima Nikaya 17){{sfn|Bhikkhu Nanamoli|1995}} the Buddha describes life in the jungle, and the attainment of awakening. The ''Mahasaccaka Sutta'' (Majjhima Nikaya 36) describes his ascetic practices, which he abandoned. There-after he remembered a spontaneous state of jhana, and set out for jhana-practice. Both suttras narrate how, after destroying the [[Sankhara|disturbances of the mind]], and attaining [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|concentration of the mind]], he attained three knowledges (vidhya):{{sfn|Bikkhu Nanamoli|1995|p=340-342}}{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=47–48}}{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=27}}
# Insight into his past lives
# Insight into the workings of [[Karma]] and [[Reincarnation]]
# Insight into the [[Four Noble Truths]]

Insight into the [[Four Noble Truths]] is here called awakening.{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=47-48}} The monk (''[[bhikkhu]]'') has {{quote|...attained the unattained supreme security from bondage.{{sfn|Bhikkhu Nanamoli|1996|p=199}}}}

Awakening is also described as synonymous with [[Nirvana]], the extinction of the passions whereby suffering is ended and no more rebirths take place.{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=49}} The insight arises that this liberation is certain:
{{quote|Knowledge arose in me, and insight: my freedom is certain, this is my last birth, now there is no rebirth.{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=49}}}}

====Critical assessment====
Schmithausen{{refn|group=note|In his often-cited article ''On some Aspects of Descriptions or Theories of 'Liberating Insight' and 'Enlightenment' in Early Buddhism''}} notes that the mention of the four noble truths as constituting "liberating insight", which is attained after mastering the Rupa Jhanas, is a later addition to texts such as Majjhima Nikaya 36.{{sfn|Schmithausen|1981}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}{{sfn|Vetter|1988}} Bronkhorst notices that 
{{quote|...the accounts which include the Four Noble Truths had a completely different conception of the process of liberation than the one which includes the Four Dhyanas and the destruction of the intoxicants.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=110}}}}

It calls in question the reliability of these accounts, and the relation between ''dhyana'' and insight, which is a core problem in the study of early Buddhism.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}{{sfn|Gombrich|1997}} Originally the term ''prajna'' may have been used, which came to be replaced by the four truths in those texts where "liberating insight" was preceded by the four jhanas.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=108}} Bronkhorst also notices that the conception of what exactly this "liberating insight" was developed throughout time. Whereas originally it may not have been specified, later on the four truths served as such, to be superseded by ''pratityasamutpada'', and still later, in the Hinayana schools, by the doctrine of the non-existence of a substantial self or person.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=100-101}} And Schmithausen notices that still other descriptions of this "liberating insight" exist in the Buddhist canon: 
{{quote|"that the five Skandhas are impermanent, disagreeable, and neither the Self nor belonging to oneself";{{refn|group=note|Majjhima Nikaya 26}} "the contemplation of the arising and disappearance (''udayabbaya'') of the five Skandhas";{{refn|group=note|Anguttara Nikaya II.45 (PTS)}} "the realisation of the Skandhas as empty (''rittaka''), vain (''tucchaka'') and without any pith or substance (''asaraka'').{{refn|group=note|Samyutta Nikaya III.140-142 (PTS)}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=101}}}}

An example of this substitution, and its consequences, is Majjhima Nikaya 36:42-43, which gives an account of the awakening of the Buddha.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=102-103}}

==Understanding of ''bodhi'' and Buddhahood in Buddhism==
The term bodhi acquired a variety of meanings and connotations during the development of Buddhist thoughts in the various schools.

===Early Buddhism===
{{Main|Early Buddhism}}

In early Buddhism, ''bodhi'' carried a meaning synonymous to ''[[nirvana]]'', using only some different metaphors to describe the insight, which implied the extinction of ''[[lobha]]'' (greed), ''[[Dvesha (Buddhism)|dosa]]'' (hate) and ''[[Moha (Buddhism)|moha]]'' (delusion). 

===Theravada===
{{See also|Dhyāna in Buddhism#Contemporary reassessment - the "Jhana wars"|l1=Non-reactive and lucid awareness}}

In [[Theravada Buddhism]], bodhi and nirvana carry the same meaning, that of being freed from greed, hate and delusion. In [[Theravada]] Buddhism, ''bodhi'' refers to the realisation of the [[four stages of enlightenment]] and becoming an  [[Arahant]].{{sfn|Schreiber-Fischer|2008|p=50}} In Theravada Buddhism, ''bodhi'' is equal to supreme insight, the realisation of the four noble truths, which leads to deliverance.{{sfn|Schreiber-Fischer|2008|p=50}} Reaching full awakening is equivalent in meaning to reaching [[Nirvāṇa]].&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma6/enlightnirvana.html Kusala Bhikshu (3/2008), ''Buddhist Enlightenment vs Nirvana'']{{As of|2010|09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attaining Nirvāṇa is the ultimate goal of Theravada and other śrāvaka traditions.&lt;ref group=web&gt;"[http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-AN/26715.htm David Loy (2010), ''Enlightenment in Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta: Are Nirvana and Moksha the Same?'']{{As of|2010|09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves the abandonment of the [[Fetter (Buddhism)|ten fetters]] and the cessation of dukkha or suffering. Full awakening is reached in four stages. According to Nyanatiloka,
{{quote|(Through Bodhi) one awakens from the slumber or stupor (inflicted upon the mind) by the defilements (''[[Kleshas (Buddhism)|kilesa]]'', q.v.) and comprehends the [[Four Noble Truths]] (''[[sacca]]'', q.v.)''.{{sfn|Nyanatiloka|1980|p=40}}}}

Since the 1980s, western Theravada-oriented teachers have started to question the primacy of insight. According to [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]], ''jhana'' and ''vipassana'' (insight) form an integrated practice.{{sfn|Quli|2008}} Polak and Arbel, following scholars like Vetter and Bronkhorst, argue that [[right effort]], c.q. the [[Four Right Exertions|four right efforts]] (sense restraint, preventing the arising of [[Five hindrances|unwholesome states]], and the generation of [[Seven factors of awakening|wholesome states]]), mindfulness, and ''[[Dhyana in Buddhism|dhyana]]'' form an integrated practice, in which ''dhyana'' is the actualisation of insight, leading to an awakened awareness which is "non-reactive and lucid."{{sfn|Polak|2011}}{{sfn|Arbel|2017}}

===Mahayana===
{{Main|Mahayana}}

In Mahayana-thought, bodhi is the realisation of the inseparability of [[samsara]] and [[nirvana]],{{sfn|Fischer-Schreiber|2008|p=51}} and the unity of subject and object.{{sfn|Fischer-Schreiber|2008|p=51}} It is similar to [[Wisdom in Buddhism|prajna]], to [[kensho|realizing the Buddha-nature]], realizing [[sunyata]] and realizing [[suchness]].{{sfn|Fischer-Schreiber|2008|p=51}} In time, the Buddha's awakening came to be understood as an immediate full awakening and liberation, instead of the insight into and certainty about the way to follow to reach enlightenment. However, in some Zen traditions this perfection came to be relativized again; according to one contemporary Zen master, "Shakyamuni buddha and Bodhidharma are still practicing."{{sfn|Harris|p=103|2004}}

Mahayana discerns three forms of awakened beings:{{sfn|Schreiber|2008|p=51}}
# [[Arahat]] – Liberation for oneself;{{refn|group=note|This also includes [[Pratyekabuddha]], but is not being mentioned by Fischer-Schreiber et al.}}
# [[Bodhisattva]] – Liberation for living beings;
# [[Buddhahood|Full Buddhahood]].

Within the various Mahayana-schools exist various further explanations and interpretations.{{sfn|Fischer-Schreiber|2008|p=51}} In [[Mahāyāna]] Buddhism the [[Bodhisattva]] is the ideal. The ultimate goal is not only of one's own liberation in Buddhahood, but the liberation of all living beings. But Mahayana Buddhism also developed a cosmology with a wide range of buddhas and bodhisattvas, who assist humans on their way to liberation.

[[Nichiren Buddhism]] regards Buddhahood as a state of perfect freedom, in which one is awakened to the eternal and ultimate truth that is the reality of all things. This supreme state of life is characterized by boundless wisdom and infinite compassion. The Lotus Sutra reveals that Buddhahood is a potential in the lives of all beings. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nichirenlibrary.org/en/dic/Content/G/66|title=Buddhahood – Dictionary of Buddhism – Nichiren Buddhism Library|website=www.nichirenlibrary.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Buddha-nature====
In the [[Tathagatagarbha]] and [[Buddha-nature]] doctrines bodhi becomes equivalent to the universal, natural and pure state of the mind:
{{quote|''Bodhi'' is the final goal of a Bodhisattva's career [...] ''Bodhi'' is pure universal and immediate knowledge, which extends over all time, all universes, all beings and elements, conditioned and unconditioned. It is absolute and identical with Reality and thus it is [[Tathata]]. ''Bodhi'' is immaculate and non-conceptual, and it, being not an outer object, cannot be understood by discursive thought. It has neither beginning, nor middle nor end and it is indivisible. It is non-dual (''advayam'') [...] The only possible way to comprehend it is through [[samadhi]] by the yogin.{{sfn|Sebastian|2005|p=274}}}}

According to these doctrines bodhi is always there within one's mind, but requires the defilements to be removed. This vision is expounded in texts such as the [[Shurangama Sutra]] and the [[Uttaratantra]].

In [[Shingon]] Buddhism, the state of Bodhi is also seen as naturally inherent in the mind. It is the mind's natural and pure state, where no distinction is being made between a perceiving subject and perceived objects. This is also the understanding of Bodhi found in [[Yogacara]] Buddhism.

To achieve this vision of non-duality, it is necessary to recognise one's own mind:
{{quote|... it means that you are to know the inherent natural state of the mind by eliminating the split into a perceiving subject and perceived objects which normally occurs in the world and is wrongly thought to be real. This also corresponds to the Yogacara definition&amp;nbsp;... that emptiness (''sunyata'') is the absence of this imaginary split{{sfn|Hodge|2003|p=31-32}}}}

====Harmonisation of the various terms and meanings====
During the development of Mahayana Buddhism the various strands of thought on Bodhi were continuously being elaborated. Attempts were made to harmonize the various terms. The Buddhist commentator [[Buddhaguhya]] treats various terms as synonyms:
{{quote|For example, he defines emptiness (''sunyata'') as suchness (''tathata'') and says that suchness is the intrinsic nature (''svabhava'') of the mind which is Enlightenment (''[[Bodhicitta|bodhi-citta]]''). Moreover, he frequently uses the terms suchness (''tathata'') and Suchness-Awareness (''tathata-jnana'') interchangeably. But since Awareness (''jnana'') is non-dual, Suchness-Awareness is not so much the Awareness of Suchness, but the Awareness which ''is'' Suchness. In other words, the term Suchness-Awareness is functionally equivalent to Enlightenment. Finally, it must not be forgotten that this Suchness-Awareness or Perfect Enlightenment ''is'' Mahavairocana [the Primal Buddha, uncreated and forever existent]. In other words, the mind in its intrinsic nature is Mahavairocana, whom one "becomes" (or vice versa) when one is perfectly enlightened.{{sfn|Hodge|2003|p=31-32}}}}

==Western understanding of enlightenment==
{{See also|Buddhist modernism|Transcendentalism|Perennial philosophy}}

In the western world the concept of ''enlightenment'' has taken on a romantic meaning.{{sfn|Carrette|King|2005}}{{sfn|Sharf|1995b}}{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} It has become synonymous with [[self-realization]] and the [[True self and false self|true self]], being regarded as a substantial essence being covered over by social conditioning.{{sfn|Carrette|King|2005}}{{sfn|Sharf|1995b}}{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}

===Enlightenment as "Aufklärung"===
The use of the western word ''enlightenment'' is based on the supposed resemblance of ''bodhi'' with ''[[Age of Enlightenment|Aufklärung]]'', the independent use of reason to gain insight into the true nature of our world. In fact there are more resemblances with [[Romanticism]] than with the Enlightenment: the emphasis on feeling, on intuitive insight, on a true essence beyond the world of appearances.{{sfn|Wright|2000|p=181-183}}

===Awakening===
The equivalent term "awakening" has also been used in a Christian context, namely the [[Great Awakening]]s, several periods of [[Christian revival|religious revival]] in [[Religion in the United States|American religious history]]. Historians and theologians identify three or four waves of increased religious enthusiasm occurring between the early 18th century and the late 19th century. Each of these "Great Awakenings" was characterized by widespread revivals led by evangelical Protestant ministers, a sharp increase of interest in religion, a profound sense of conviction and redemption on the part of those affected, an increase in evangelical church membership, and the formation of new religious movements and denominations.

===Romanticism and transcendentalism===
The romantic idea of enlightenment as insight into a timeless, transcendent reality has been popularized especially by [[D.T. Suzuki]].&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/CriticalZen/whose%20zen_sharf.pdf Robert H. Sharf, ''Whose Zen? Zen Nationalism Revisited'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/HistoricalZen/Chan_in_China.html Hu Shih: Ch'an (Zen) Buddhism in China. Its History and Method]&lt;/ref&gt; Further popularization was due to the writings of [[Heinrich Dumoulin]].{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a}}{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b}}&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/HistoricalZen/McRaeIntroduction.pdf Critical introduction by John McRae to the reprint of Dumoulin's ''A history of Zen'']&lt;/ref&gt; Dumoulin viewed metaphysics as the expression of a transcendent truth, which according to him was expressed by Mahayana Buddhism, but not by the pragmatic analysis of the oldest Buddhism, which emphasizes anatta.{{sfn|Dumonlin|2000}} This romantic vision is also recognizable in the works of [[Ken Wilber]].{{sfn|Wilber|1996}}

In the oldest Buddhism this essentialism is not recognizable.{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=116-124}}&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/publications/nlarc/Pruning_the_bodhi_tree.htm Nanzan Institute: Pruning the bodhi Tree]&lt;/ref&gt; According to critics it doesn't really contribute to a real insight into Buddhism:&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://meaningness.wordpress.com/2011/08/12/effing-the-ineffable/ David Chapman: Effing the ineffable]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;...most of them labour under the old cliché that the goal of Buddhist psychological analysis is to reveal the hidden mysteries in the human mind and thereby facilitate the development of a transcendental state of consciousness beyond the reach of linguistic expression.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992a|p=xi}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Enlightenment and experience===
A common reference in western culture is the notion of "enlightenment ''experience''". This notion can be traced back to [[William James]], who used the term "religious experience" in his book, ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]''.{{sfn|Hori|1999|p=47}} [[Wayne Proudfoot]] traces the roots of the notion of "religious experience" further back to the German theologian [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] (1768-1834), who argued that religion is based on a feeling of the infinite. Schleiermacher used the notion of "religious experience" to defend religion against the growing scientific and secular critique.

It was popularised by the [[Transcendentalists]], and exported to Asia via missionaries.{{sfn|King|2002}} Transcendentalism developed as a reaction against 18th Century rationalism, [[John Locke]]'s philosophy of [[Sensualism]], and the predestinationism of New England [[Calvinism]]. It is fundamentally a variety of diverse sources such as Hindu texts like the [[Vedas]], the [[Upanishads]] and the [[Bhagavad Gita]],{{sfn|Versluis|2001|p=3}} various religions, and [[German idealism]].{{sfn|Hart|1995}}

It was adopted by many scholars of religion, of which William James was the most influential.{{sfn|Sharf|2000|p=271}}{{refn|group=note|James also gives descriptions of conversion experiences. The Christian model of dramatic conversions, based on the role-model of Paul's conversion, may also have served as a model for western interpretations and expectations regarding "enlightenment", similar to Protestant influences on Theravada Buddhism, as described by Carrithers: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;It rests upon the notion of the primacy of religious experiences, preferably spectacular ones, as the origin and legitimation of religious action. But this presupposition has a natural home, not in Buddhism, but in Christian and especially Protetstant Christian movements which prescribe a radical conversion.{{sfn|Carrithers|1983|p=18}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
See Sekida for an example of this influence of William James and Christian conversion stories, mentioning Luther{{sfn|Sekida|1985|p=196-197}} and St. Paul.{{sfn|Sekida|1985|p=251}} See also McMahan for the influence of Christian thought on Buddhism.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}}}

The notion of "experience" has been criticised.{{sfn|Sharf|1995b}}{{sfn|Mohr|2000|p=282-286}}{{sfn|Low|2006|p=12}} Robert Sharf points out that "experience" is a typical western term, which has found its way into Asian religiosity via western influences.{{sfn|Sharf|1995b}}{{refn|group=note|Robert Sharf: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he role of experience in the history of Buddhism has been greatly exaggerated in contemporary scholarship. Both historical and ethnographic evidence suggests that the privileging of experience may well be traced to certain twentieth-century reform movements, notably those that urge a return to ''[[zazen]]'' or ''[[vipassana]]'' meditation, and these reforms were profoundly influenced by religious developments in the west [...] While some adepts may indeed experience "altered states" in the course of their training, critical analysis shows that such states do not constitute the reference point for the elaborate Buddhist discourse pertaining to the "path".{{sfn|Sharf|1995-C|p=1}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The notion of "experience" introduces a false notion of duality between "experiencer" and "experienced", whereas the essence of kensho is the realisation of the "[[non-duality]]" of observer and observed.{{sfn|Hori|1994|p=30}}{{dead link|date=May 2014}} {{sfn|Samy|1998|p=82}} "Pure experience" does not exist; all experience is mediated by intellectual and cognitive activity.{{sfn|Mohr|2000|p=282}}{{sfn|Samy|1998|p=80-82}} The specific teachings and practices of a specific tradition may even determine what "experience" someone has, which means that this "experience" is not the ''proof'' of the teaching, but a ''result'' of the teaching.{{sfn|Samy|1998|p=80}} A pure consciousness without concepts, reached by "cleaning the doors of perception" as per romantic poet [[William Blake]]{{refn|group=note|[[William Blake]]: "If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, infinite. For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thru' narrow chinks of his cavern."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quotedb.com/quotes/2653 Quote DB]&lt;/ref&gt;}}, would, according to Mohr, be an overwhelming chaos of sensory input without coherence.{{sfn|Mohr|2000|p=284}}

==Bodhi Day==
Sakyamuni's Buddhahood is celebrated on [[Bodhi Day]]. In Sri Lanka and Japan different days are used for this celebration.

According to the Theravada tradition in Sri Lanka, Sakyamuni reached Buddhahood at the [[full moon]] in May. This is celebrated at [[Poya|Wesak Poya]], the full moon in May, as [[Sambuddhatva jayanthi]] (also known as Sambuddha jayanthi).&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://dedunu.wordpress.com/2008/06/12/vesak-full-moon-poya-day/ Vesak full moon poya day]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Zen tradition, the Buddha reached his decisive insight on 8 December. This is celebrated in Zen monasteries with a very intensive eight-day session of [[Bodhi Day#Rohatsu|''Rōhatsu'']].

{{Unbalanced|date=May 2018}}'''Environmental racism''' is a term used to describe environmental injustice that occurs in practice and in policy within a racialized context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bullard|first=Robert D.|date=2001|title=Environmental Justice in the 21st Century: Race Still Matters|journal=Phylon (1960-)|volume=49|issue=3/4|pages=151–171|doi=10.2307/3132626|jstor=3132626}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1982, the term was coined by [[Benjamin Chavis]], who was the then executive director of the United Church of Christ (UCC) Commission for Racial Justice, in response to the dumping of hazardous PCB waste in a town in Warren County, North Carolina. The UCC and US General Accounting Office (GAO) reports on this case in NC brought public attention to the strong association between locations of hazardous waste sites and poor minority neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Early activists in environmental racism, Chavis and [[Robert D. Bullard|Robert Bullard]] pointed out institutionalized racism stemming from government and corporate policies that led to environmental racism. Practices like redlining, zoning, and colorblind adaptation planning,&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hardy|first=Dean|last2=Milligan|first2=Richard|last3=Heynen|first3=Nik|date=2017|title=Racial coastal formation: The environmental injustice of colorblind adaptation planning for sea-level rise.|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016718517302944|journal=Geoforum|volume=87|pages=62–72|via=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2017.10.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and factors that inhibit residents from preventing these practices include their low socioeconomic status, and lack of political representation and mobility that all contribute to environmental racism.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Park|first=Rozelia|date=1998|title=An Examination of International Environmental Racism Through the Lens of Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Wastes|url=http://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/ijgls/vol5/iss2/14|journal=Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies|volume=5|pages=|via=Jerome Hall Law Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mohai|first=Paul|author2=Pellow, David|author3=Roberts, J.

Environmental racism can be explained through a number of ways and in most cases usually include four unique patterns. The first one includes exposure to hazardous waste. It can also be identified by determining how vulnerable a community is to issues like flooding. The accessibility of potable water can also help in measuring environmental justice. Finally, a discriminatory waste management program can also be considered a case of environmental injustice. Some social scientists have argued that some causes of environmental racism are intentional, for example, the dumping of hazardous waste in a minority community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chae|first=David H.|date=2018|title=Area racism and birth outcomes among Blacks in the United States.|url=|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=199|pages=49–55|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Apart from intentional reasons, this kind of racism can also be caused by structural and institutional elements. Chavis defined environmental racism in five categories. First, he termed it as racial discrimination in defining environmental policies. He also stated that this occurs when these regulations and laws are being enforced. He further stated that it is the deliberate targeting of communities of color as far as dumping of toxic waste is concerned. He also referred to this term as the official sanctioning of dangerous poisons and pollutants in the minority communities. Finally, he termed it as the history of exclusion of people of color from attaining leadership positions in the ecological organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Urban Geography|last=Holifield|first=Ryan|publisher=V. H. Winston &amp; Son, Inc.|year=2001|isbn=|location=Milwaukee|pages=78–90|chapter=Defining Environmental Justice and Environmental Racism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other activists like Robert Bullard also had their own definition for the term claiming that it refers to any policy or directive that differentially harms people, groups, or even communities based on their color. 

It is also important to understand the factors that can lead to environmental racism and social scientists have identified the four main ones. They include cheap land, the absence of political authority, lack of mobility, and lastly poverty. While corporations can obtain land cheaply because of economic reasons, they can also do that because a community lacks the power to fight such companies. It is also a known fact that minority communities lack political power and this has often worked to their disadvantage. Businesses know that they can do anything in such places without any meaningful resistance. It is worth noting that politicians and lawmakers are very selective on whom they represent, and these are some of the elements that have harmed these communities. Corporations also take advantage of the lack of mobility of these people and pay them minimum wages to limit their mobility even further.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=&lt;!--editorial:no byline--&gt;|date=2018|title=Environmental racism: time to tackle social injustice.|url=|journal=The Lancet Planetary Health|volume=2|issue=11|pages=e462|via=|pmid=30396431|doi=10.1016/S2542-5196(18)30219-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It should be noted that the impoverished nature of these communities contributes to all the above factors because without money people cannot act either physically or politically.

The acknowledgement of environmental racism prompted the [[environmental justice]] social movement that began in the 1970s and 1980s in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Melosi|first=Martin|title=Equity, eco-racism and environmental history|journal=Environmental History Review |year=1995 |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=1–16 |doi=10.2307/3984909 |jstor=3984909}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although environmental racism has been historically tied to the environmental justice movement, throughout the years the term has dissociated more and more from the environmental justice movement.&lt;ref&gt;Ulezaka, Tara. Race and Waste: The Quest for Environmental Justice. Temple Journal of Science Technology &amp; Environmental Law.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to cases of environmental racism, grassroots organizations and campaigns have brought more attention to environmental racism in policy making and emphasize the importance of having input from minorities in policy making.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Although environmental racism was coined in the US, it also occurs on the international level. Examples include the exportation of hazardous wastes to poor countries in the [[Global South]] with lax environmental policies and safety practices ([[pollution haven]]s).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Marginalized communities that do not have the socioeconomic and political means to oppose large corporations are at risk to environmentally racist practices that are detrimental and sometimes fatal to humans.Economic statuses and political positions are crucial factors when looking at environmental problems because they determine where a person lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dicochea|first=Perlita R.|date=2012|title=Discourses of Race &amp; Racism within Environmental Justice Studies: An Eco-Racial Intervention|url=|journal=Ethnicity and Race in a Changing World|volume=3|issue=2|pages=18–29|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who do not have those privileges are usually the ones who suffer from environmental problems.    

Environmental racism crosses boundaries of countries and is addressed below in the context of environmental racism that has occurred outside of the US, where the term was coined.

== Background ==
In the United States, the first report to draw a relationship between race, income, and risk of exposure to pollutants was the Council of Environmental Quality's "Annual Report to the President" in 1971, in response to toxic waste dumping in an African American community in Warren County, NC.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;United States of America. Environmental Justice Group. National Conference of State Legislatures. Environmental Justice: A Matter of Perspective. 1995&lt;/ref&gt;  After protests in [[Warren County, North Carolina]], the U.S. [[General Accounting Office]] (GAO) issued a report on the case in 1983, and the [[United Church of Christ]] (UCC) commissioned a report exploring the concept in 1987 drawing a connection between race and the placement of the hazardous waste facilities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[[Benjamin Chavis|Chavis, Jr., Benjamin F.]], and Charles Lee, "Toxic Wastes and Race in the United States," United Church of Christ Commission for Racial Justice, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Office|first=U.S. Government Accountability|date=1983-06-14|title=Siting of Hazardous Waste Landfills and Their Correlation With Racial and Economic Status of Surrounding Communities|url=https://www.gao.gov/products/RCED-83-168|issue=RCED-83-168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perez|first=Alejandro|last2=Grafton|first2=Bernadette|last3=Mohai|first3=Paul|last4=Harden|first4=Rebecca|last5=Hintzen|first5=Katy|last6=Orvis|first6=Sara|date=October 2015|title=Evolution of the environmental justice movement: activism, formalization and differentiation|journal=Environmental Research Letters|volume=10|issue=10|pages=105002|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/10/10/105002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the outcry in Warren County was an important event in spurring minority, grassroots involvement in the [[environmental justice]] movement by addressing cases of environmental racism.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; One activist, [[Benjamin Chavis]], who at the time was the executive director of the Commission for Racial Justice of the United Church of Christ coined the term ''environmental racism'' 1982 in response to the case.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

From the groundbreaking reports on environmental racism in Warren County, NC, the accumulation of studies and reports on cases of environmental racism and injustices garnered increased public attention in the US, and eventually led to President Bill Clinton's 1994 [[Pollution_in_the_United_States#Executive_Order_12898|Executive Order 12898]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1994|title=Presidential Documents|url=https://www.archives.gov/files/federal-register/executive-orders/pdf/12898.pdf|journal=Federal Register|volume=|pages=|via=National Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This was a historical step in addressing environmental injustice on a policy level, especially within a predominantly white-dominated environmentalism movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/environmentalisms-racist-history|title=Environmentalism’s Racist History|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental racism was coined in the US but also exists on an international scale between countries in the [[North–South divide|Global North]] and [[Global South]], and between different races and ethnicities on different continents. Corporations in the Global North often produce dangerous chemicals banned in the United States and export them to developing countries, or send waste materials to countries with less stringent environmental laws.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"&gt;Grossman, Elizabeth, ''High Tech Trash: Digital Devices, Hidden Toxics, and Human Health'' (Washington: Island Press, 2006), 185.&lt;/ref&gt; While the US approach to environmental racism emphasizes race-based discrimination and structures policies to provide equal treatment, the European approach to environmental racism focuses on changing the social conditions that result in inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2011-09-15|title=Issues in environmental justice within the European Union|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800911002722|journal=Ecological Economics|language=en|volume=70|issue=11|pages=1846–1853|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2011.06.025|issn=0921-8009|last1=Laurent|first1=Éloi}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

====Cost-benefit analysis ====
[[Cost-benefit analysis]] (CBA) is a process that places a monetary value on costs and benefits to evaluate issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://go.worldbank.org/2C1D1VKF80 "Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)"], World Bank Group. n.d. Accessed: November 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Environmental CBA aims to provide policy solutions for intangible products such as clean air and water by measuring a consumer's willingness to pay for these goods.  CBA contributes to environmental racism through the valuing of environmental resources based on their utility to society.  The more someone is willing to pay for a resource such as clean water or air benefits society more than when people are not willing to pay for these goods.  This creates a burden on poorer areas, however, by relocating toxic wastes and other environmentally hazardous goods through the justification that they are not willing (or able) to pay as much as a wealthier area for a clean environment.  The placement of toxic wastes near poor people lowers the property value of already cheap land.  Since the decrease in property value is less than that of a cleaner, wealthier area the monetary benefits to society are greater by dumping the toxic waste in a "low-value" area.&lt;ref&gt;Westra, Laura, and Bill E. Lawson. ''Faces of Environmental Racism: Confronting Issues of Global Justice''. Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
===Definition===

[[Benjamin Chavis|Chavis]] defined the term as "racial discrimination in environmental policy making, the enforcement of regulations and laws, the deliberate targeting of communities of color for toxic waste facilities, the official sanctioning of the life-threatening presence of poisons and pollutants in our communities, and the history of excluding people of color from leadership of the ecology movements."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Expanding the definition in "The Legacy of American Apartheid and Environmental Racism," [[Robert D. Bullard|Robert Bullard]] describes the environmental racism "refers to any policy, practice, or directive that differentially affects or disadvantages (whether intended or unintended) individuals, groups, or communities based on race or color."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bullard|first=Robert|date=Spring 1994|title=The Legacy of American Apartheid and Environmental Racism|url=https://scholarship.law.stjohns.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1460&amp;context=jcred|journal=Journal of Civil Rights and Economic Development|volume=9|pages=|via=St. John's University School of Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four unique patterns that help identify and measure environmental injustice. Exposure to hazardous waste, how vulnerable a community is to flooding, how accessible potable water is, and discriminatory waste management processes.&lt;ref&gt;https://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1004&amp;context=anthro_faculty_pubs&lt;/ref&gt;

While some social scientists view the siting of hazardous facilities in minority communities as a demonstration of intentional racism,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Saha, Robin. 2010. "Environmental Racism". In ''Encyclopedia of Geography'', ed. Barney Warf, Sage Publications, {{DOI|10.4135/9781412939591.n379}}&lt;/ref&gt; others view the causes of environmental racism as structural and institutional.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

There are four factors leading to environmental racism: cheap land, lack of political power, lack of mobility, and finally poverty. First, cheap land is sought for economic reasons but cheap land can also be found due to lack of power in the community to resist the corporation. Second, the lack of political power carried by poor minority groups allow businesses to act with little to no resistance. Politicians and lawmakers are able to better understand communities that have the resources to make their beliefs known, unlike impoverished minority communities. Third, the lack of mobility provides a stream of workers who can be paid minimum wage and thus do not have the funds to leave the now hazardous community. Finally, the overall communities lack of money contributes to all the factors listed above and overall reduces the communities ability to act both physically and politically.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1138&amp;context=ijgls&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cases of Environmental Racism by Location==

=== North America ===
In the United States, correlation between the sites of hazardous waste facilities and low-income and minority communities was publicly addressed in the 1983 [[U.S. Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) report in response to the Warren County, NC protests.&lt;ref name="gao"&gt;[http://archive.gao.gov/d48t13/121648.pdf GAO. 1983. "Siting of Hazardous Waste Landfills and Their Correlation with Racial and Economic Status of Surrounding Communities"], [[U.S. Government Accountability Office]], Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt; Minority communities do not have the financial means, resources, and political representation to oppose hazardous waste sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Colquette | first1 = Kelly Michele | last2 = Henry Robertson | first2 = Elizabeth A. | year = 1991 | title = Environmental Racism: The Causes, Consequences, and Commendations | url = | journal = Tulane Environmental Law Journal | volume = 5 | issue = 1| page = 168 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also may depend on the economic opportunities the site brings and are reluctant to oppose its location at the risk of their health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, controversial projects are less likely to be sited in non-minority areas that are expected to pursue [[collective action]] and succeed in opposing the siting of hazardous waste sites and sewage treatment facilities in their area.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher M. 1995. Environmental Racism Claims brought under the Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bryant, Bunyan 1995"&gt;Bryant, Bunyan. "Introduction." ''Environmental justice issues, policies, and solutions''. Washington, D.C: Island, 1995. 1-7.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Processes such as [[suburbanization]], [[gentrification]], and decentralization lead to patterns of environmental racism. For example, the process of suburbanization (or [[white flight]]) consists of non-minorities leaving industrial zones for safer, cleaner, and less expensive suburban locales. Meanwhile, minority communities are left in the inner cities and in close proximity to polluted industrial zones. In these areas, unemployment is high and businesses are less likely to invest in area improvement, creating poor economic conditions for residents and reinforcing a social formation that reproduces racial inequality.&lt;ref name="pulido12"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pulido|first=Laura|year=2000|title=Rethinking Environmental Racism: White Privilege and Urban Development in Southern California|journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers|volume=90|issue=1|pages=12–40|doi=10.1111/0004-5608.00182|hdl=10214/1833}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the poverty of property owners and residents in a municipality may be taken into consideration by hazardous waste facility developers since areas with depressed real estate values will cut expenses.&lt;ref&gt;Colquette and Robertson, 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the placement of hazardous waste facilities, minority populations experience greater exposure to harmful chemicals and suffer from health outcomes that affect their ability at work and in schools. A comprehensive study of particulate emissions across the United States, published in 2018, found that Blacks were exposed to 54% more particulate matter emissions (soot) than the average American.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mikati|first=Ihab|author2=Adam F.

The [[Indian Removal Act of 1830]] and the [[Trail of Tears]] may be considered early examples of environmental racism in the United States. By 1850, all tribes east of the Mississippi had been removed to western lands, essentially confining them to "lands that were too dry, remote, or barren to attract the attention of settlers and corporations".&lt;ref name="ibid"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hooks|first1=Gregory|last2=Smith|first2=Chad L.|year=2004|title=The Treadmill of Destruction: National Sacrifice Areas and Native Americans|url=|journal=[[American Sociological Review]]|volume=69|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, during World War II, military facilities were often located conterminous to reservations, leading to a situation in which "a disproportionate number of the most dangerous military facilities are located near Native American lands".&lt;ref name="ibid" /&gt;

More recently, Native American lands have been used for waste disposal and illegal dumping by the US and multinational corporations.&lt;ref name="Goldtooth, Tom 1995"&gt;Goldtooth, Tom.

This included allegations that the US "deliberately and systematically permitted, aided, and abetted, solicited and conspired to commit the dumping, transportation, and location of nuclear, toxic, medical, and otherwise hazardous waste materials on Native American territories in North America and has thus created a clear and present danger to the health, safety, and physical and mental well-being of Native American People".&lt;ref name="hartford-hwp1" /&gt;

An ongoing issue for Native Americans activists is the [[Dakota Access Pipeline]]. The pipeline would start in North Dakota and travel to Illinois. Although it does not cross directly on a reservation, the pipeline is under scrutiny because it passes under a section of the Missouri river which is a key water source for Native American tribes including the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) declared the PCBs a threat to public health and required the state to remove the polluted waste. In 1979, the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources and EPA Region 4 selected Warren County as the site to deposit the PCB-contaminated soil that was collected from the roadsides.&lt;ref name="Warren" /&gt; Warren County is one of the six counties along the "black belt" of North Carolina. The counties residing in the "black belt" are significantly poorer than the rest of the state.

====Homer, Forest Grove, and Center Springs, Louisiana ====

In 1989, the Louisiana Energy Services (LES), a British, German and American conglomerate, conducted a nationwide search to find the "best" site to build a privately owned uranium enrichment plant. The LES claimed to use an objective scientific method to select Louisiana as the "best" place to build the plant. In response to the selection, the communities of Homer, Forest Grove and Center Springs that are nearby the proposed site formed a group called Citizens against Nuclear Trash (CANT). With the help of the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund (later changed to Earth Justice Legal Defense Fund), CANT sued LES for practicing environmental racism. Finally after 8 years, on May 1, 1997, a three-judge panel of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Atomic Safety and Licensing Board made their final initial decision. The panel found that racial bias did play a role in the selection process. In response to the victory, on May 11, 1997, the London Times declared, "Louisiana Blacks Win Nuclear War." The courts decision was also upheld on appeal on April 4, 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bullard|first1=Robert|date=September 2001|title=Confronting Environmental Racism in the 21st Century}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Flint, Michigan====
{{main article|Flint water crisis}}
Since April 2014, residents of [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]], a city that is almost 57 percent black and notably impoverished, have been drinking and bathing in water that contains enough lead to meet the Environmental Protection Agency's definition of "toxic waste".  Before 2014 when the city of Flint switched to their own river as means of water, Lake Huron provided the area with water. Researchers at Virginia Tech discovered in 2015 that the [[Flint River (Michigan)|Flint River]] is 19 times more corrosive than Lake Huron. Lead contamination can engender multiple health conditions. A November 2015 class-action lawsuit describes how Michigan's Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) failed to treat the new water source with an anti-corrosive agent, thereby causing the water to become increasingly discolored. This was in violation of the Lead and Copper Rule and MDEQ did not correctly complete the Safe Drinking Water Act mandated lead assessments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Venkataraman|first=Bhawani|date=2017-12-29|title=The Paradox of Water and the Flint Crisis|journal=Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development|language=en|volume=60|issue=1|pages=4–17|doi=10.1080/00139157.2018.1397466|issn=0013-9157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adding that agent (orthophosphate) would have cost $100 per day, according to CNN, and 90 percent of the problems with Flint's water would have been averted if it had been used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/racist-roots-of-flints-water-crisis_us_56b12953e4b04f9b57d7b118|title=The Racist Roots Of Flint's Water Crisis|last1=Craven|first1=Julia|date=2016-02-03|newspaper=Huffington Post|accessdate=8 November 2016|last2=Tynes|first2=Tyler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally the consumption of Lead is considered among the environmental problems and some of the ways people can be exposed to it is from the corrosion of old pipes, the dust from lead-based paint and gasoline has metal dust which contains lead; but the amount of lead in gasoline has been reduced and this contributed a lot when it comes to Lead exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macey|first=Gregg P.|date=2001|title=An Investigation of Environmental Racism Claims: Testing Environmental Management Approaches with a Geographic Information System|url=|journal=Environmental Management|volume=27|issue=6|pages=893–907|via=ProQuest|pmid=11393323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After an official investigation was conducted, Michigan's attorney general Bill Schuette initially filed charges against three government officials: two state officials of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, Michael Prysby and Stephen Busch, and a Flint city employee, Michael Glasglow, who was the city's water quality supervisor. They were brought up against felony charges such as "misconduct, neglect of duty, and conspiracy to tamper with evidence."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/04/20/465545378/lead-laced-water-in-flint-a-step-by-step-look-at-the-makings-of-a-crisis|title=Lead-Laced Water In Flint: A Step-By-Step Look At The Makings Of A Crisis|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were also charged with violating the Michigan Safe Water Drinking Act.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1971, racial strains over the absence of protection for African Americans in the threatening integration endeavors prompted a mob and resulted in the capture of several black activists who would later be known as the "Wilmington Ten."

====Bhopal, India====
{{main article|Bhopal disaster}}
[[Union Carbide Corporation]], is the parent company of Union Carbide India Limited which outsources its production to an outside country. Located in [[Bhopal, India]], Union Carbide India Limited primarily produced the chemical [[methyl isocyanate]] used for pesticide manufacture.&lt;ref name="responsibility1"&gt;Das Gupta, Aruna and Ananda Das Gupta, "Corporate Social Responsibility in India: Towards a Sane Society?", ''Social Responsibility Journal'', Volume 4, Issue 1 (2008): 213.&lt;/ref&gt; On December 3, 1984, a cloud of methyl isocyanate leaked as a result of the toxic chemical mixing with water in the plant in Bhopal.&lt;ref&gt;LaBar, Gregg, "Citizen Carbide?", ''Occupational Hazards'', Volume 53, Issue 11 (1991): 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 520,000 people were exposed to the toxic chemical immediately after the leak.&lt;ref name="responsibility1" /&gt; Within the first 3 days after the leak an estimated 8,000 people living within the vicinity of the plant died from exposure to the methyl isocyanate.&lt;ref name="responsibility1" /&gt; Some people survived the initial leak from the factory, but due to improper care and improper diagnoses many have died.&lt;ref name="responsibility1" /&gt; As a consequence of improper diagnoses, treatment may have been ineffective and this was precipitated by Union Carbide refusing to release all the details regarding the leaked gases and lying about certain important information.&lt;ref name="responsibility1" /&gt; The delay in supplying medical aid to the victims of the chemical leak made the situation for the survivors even worse.&lt;ref name="responsibility1" /&gt; Many today are still experiencing the negative health impacts of the methyl isocyanate leak, such as lung fibrosis, impaired vision, [[tuberculosis]], [[neurological disorders]], and severe body pains.&lt;ref name="responsibility1" /&gt;

The operations and maintenance of the factory in Bhopal contributed to the hazardous chemical leak. The storage of huge volumes of methyl isocyanate in a densely inhabited area, was in contravention with company policies strictly practiced in other plants.&lt;ref name="responsibility2"&gt;Das Gupta, Aruna and Ananda Das Gupta, "Corporate Social Responsibility in India: Towards a Sane Society?", ''Social Responsibility Journal'', Volume 4, Issue 1 (2008)  214.&lt;/ref&gt; The company ignored protests that they were holding too much of the dangerous chemical for one plant and built large tanks to hold it in a crowded community.&lt;ref name="responsibility2" /&gt; Methyl isocyanate must be stored at extremely low temperatures, but the company cut expenses to the air conditioning system leading to less than optimal conditions for the chemical.&lt;ref name="responsibility2" /&gt; Additionally, Union Carbide India Limited never created disaster management plans for the surrounding community around the factory in the event of a leak or spill.&lt;ref name="responsibility2" /&gt; State authorities were in the pocket of the company and therefore did not pay attention to company practices or implementation of the law.&lt;ref name="responsibility2" /&gt; The company also cut down on preventative maintenance staff to save money.&lt;ref name="responsibility2" /&gt;

====Ecuador====
[[File:Texaco in Ecuador.jpg|thumb|Aftermath of Lago Agrio oil field|253x253px]]

Due to their lack of environmental laws, emerging countries like [[Ecuador]] have been subjected to environmental pollution, sometimes causing health problems, loss of agriculture, and poverty. In 1993, 30,000 Ecuadorians, which included [[Cofan]], Siona, [[Huaorani]], and Quichua indigenous people, filed a lawsuit against [[Texaco|Texaco oil company]] for the environmental damages caused by oil extraction activities in the [[Lago Agrio oil field]]. After handing control of the oil fields to an Ecuadorian oil company, Texaco did not properly dispose of its hazardous waste, causing great damages to the ecosystem and crippling communities.&lt;ref&gt;Copland, Liesl; Kamen, Jon; Berlinger, Joe. 2009.

====Niger Delta, Nigeria====
{{see|Environmental issues in the Niger Delta}}
In Nigeria, near the [[Niger Delta]], cases of [[oil spill]]s, burning of [[toxic waste]], and urban [[air pollution]] are problems in more developed areas. In the early 1990s, Nigeria was among the 50 nations with the world's highest levels of [[carbon dioxide emissions]], which totaled 96,500 kilotons, a per capita level of 0.84 metric tons. The UN reported in 2008 that carbon dioxide emissions in Nigeria totaled 95,194 kilotons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gall|first1=Timothy|last2=Derek|first2=Gleason|title=Worldmark Encyclopedia of the Nations|date=2012|publisher=Gale, Cengage Learning|location=Detroit|page=545}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous webpages were created in support of the [[Ogoni people]], who are indigenous to Nigeria's oil-rich Delta region. Sites were used to protest the disastrous environmental and economic effects of [[Shell Oil]] drilling, to urge the boycotting of Shell Oil, and to denounce [[human rights abuse]]s by the Nigerian government and by Shell. The use of the Internet in formulating an international appeal intensified dramatically after the Nigerian government's November 1995 execution of nine Ogoni activists, including [[Ken Saro-Wiwa]], who was one of the founders of the nonviolent Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spitulnik|first1=Debra|title=Small Media Against Big Oil (Nigeria)|date=2011|publisher=Thousand Oaks: SAGE Publications, Inc.|page=459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Addressing environmental racism==
Environmental Racism can be traced back around 500 years with the arrival of the Europeans and their displacement of Native Americans.  The [[Environmental justice|Environmental Justice Movement]], however, seems to be fairly recent having been rooted around the same time as the [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights Movement]].  The Civil Rights Movement influenced the mobilization of people by echoing the empowerment and concern associated with political action&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=R6rj8XMSjx4C&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=environmental+racism+outrage#v=onepage&amp;q=environmental%20racism%20outrage&amp;f=false|title=From the Ground Up: Environmental Racism and the Rise of the Environmental Justice Movement|last=Cole|first=Luke W.|last2=Foster|first2=Sheila R.|date=2001|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9780814715376|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Here is where the civil rights agenda and the environmental agenda met.  Despite this being the case, environmental organizations such as [[Sierra Club]] did distance themselves from cases such as the Warren County case likely because of their unwillingness to risk technical support when dealing with a very social issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McGurty|first=Eileen Maura|date=1997|title=From NIMBY to Civil Rights: The Origins of the Environmental Justice Movement|journal=Environmental History|volume=2|issue=3|pages=301–323|doi=10.2307/3985352|jstor=3985352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activists have called for "more participatory and citizen-centered conceptions of justice."&lt;ref&gt;Checker, Melissa. 2005. ''Polluted Promises: Environmental Racism and the Search for Justice in a Southern Town''. New York: New York University Press, pp. 122-123&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="withered"&gt;Checker, Melissa. "Withered Memories: Naming and Fighting Environmental Racism in Georgia." In ''New Landscapes of Inequality: Neoliberalism and the Erosion of Democracy in America'', eds. Jane L. Collins, Micaela di Leonardo, and Brett Williams. Santa Fe, NM: School for Advanced Research Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The environmental justice (EJ) movement and climate justice (CJ) movement address environmental racism in bringing attention and enacting change so that marginalized populations are not disproportionately vulnerable to climate change and pollution. In the US, change must be made at the federal level, and enacted upon after being passed. This requires not only state and local agencies, but also the involvement of grassroots organizations.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.triplepundit.com/special/skeo-environmental-justice/environmental-justice-policies/|title=Understanding Environmental Justice Policies|last=Lee|first=Jan|date=June 6, 2013|website=Triple Pundit|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; According to the [[United Nations]] Conference on Environment and Development, one possible solution is the [[precautionary principle]], which states that "where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation."&lt;ref name="rio"&gt;[http://www.unep.org/Documents.multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=78&amp;ArticleID=1163 UNCED. (5-16 June 1972). "Rio Declaration on Environment and Development", United Nations Environment Programme].&lt;/ref&gt; Under this principle, the initiator of the potentially hazardous activity is charged with demonstrating the activity's safety. Environmental justice activists also emphasize the need for waste reduction in general, which would act to reduce the overall burden.&lt;ref name="withered" /&gt;

Concentrations of ethnic or racial minorities may also foster solidarity, lending support in spite of challenges and providing the concentration of [[social capital]] necessary for grassroots activism. Citizens who are tired of being subjected to the dangers of pollution in their communities have been confronting the power structures through organized protest, legal actions, marches, civil disobedience, and other activities.&lt;ref name="Weintraub, I 1994"&gt;Weintraub, I. 1994. "[http://escholarship.org/uc/item/1qx663rf.pdf Fighting Environmental Racism: A Selected Annotated Bibliography]," ''Electronic Green Journal'', Issue 1.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Racial minorities are often excluded from politics and urban planning (such as sea-level rise adaptation planning) so various perspectives of an issue are not included in policy making that may affect these excluded groups in the future.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In general, political participation in African American communities is correlated with the reduction of health risks and mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gee | first1 = Gilbert C. | last2 = Payne-Sturges | first2 = Devon C. | year = 2004 | title = Environmental Health Disparities: A Framework Integrating Psychosocial and Environmental Concepts | url = | journal = [[Environmental Health Perspectives]] | volume = 112 | issue = 17 | doi = 10.1289/ehp.7074 | pmid = 15579407 | pmc = 1253653 | pages=1645–1653}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other strategies in battling against large companies include public hearings, the elections of supporters to state and local offices, meetings with company representatives, and other efforts to bring about public awareness and accountability.&lt;ref&gt;Bullard, Robert D. 1990. ''Dumping in Dixie: Race, Class, and Environmental Equity''. Boulder, CO: Westview Press, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addressing this global issue, activists take to various social media platforms to both raise awareness and call to action.  The mobilization and communication between the intersectional grassroots movements where race and environmental imbalance meet has proven to be effective. The movement gained traction with the help of Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat among other platforms.  Celebrities such as [[Shailene Woodley|Shailene Woodley]], who advocated against the [[Keystone XL pipeline|Keystone XL Pipeline]], have shared their experiences including that of being arrested for protesting. Social media has allowed for a facilitated conversation between peers and the rest of the world when it comes to social justice issues not only online but in face-to-face interactions correspondingly&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hodges|first=Heather E.|last2=Stocking|first2=Galen|date=2015-11-01|title=A pipeline of tweets: environmental movements' use of Twitter in response to the Keystone XL pipeline|journal=Environmental Politics|language=en|volume=25|issue=2|pages=223–247|doi=10.1080/09644016.2015.1105177|issn=0964-4016}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

===Studies===
Studies have been important in drawing associations and public attention by exposing practices that cause marginalized communities to be more vulnerable to environmental health hazards. The US GAO study in response to the 1982 protests against the PCB landfill in Warren County was among the first groundbreaking studies that drew correlations between the racial and economic background of communities and the location of hazardous waste facilities. Their study, "Siting of Hazardous Waste Landfills and Their Correlation with Racial and Economic Status of Surrounding Communities," revealed that "three of the four commercial hazardous waste landfills in the Southeast United States were located in majority black communities." However, the study was limited in scope by only focusing on off-site hazardous waste landfills in the Southeastern United States.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;Colquette and Robertson, 159.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this limitation the United Church of Christ Commission for Racial Justice, or CRJ, directed a comprehensive national study on demographic patterns associated with the location of hazardous waste sites.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; The CRJ national study conducted two examinations of areas surrounding commercial hazardous waste facilities and the location of uncontrolled toxic waste sites.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; The first study examined the association between race and socio-economic status and the location of commercial hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; After statistical analysis, the first study concluded that "the percentage of community residents that belonged to a racial or ethnic group was a stronger predictor of the level of commercial hazardous waste activity than was household income, the value of the homes, the number of uncontrolled waste sites, or the estimated amount of hazardous wastes generated by industry".&lt;ref&gt;Colquette and Robertson, 159-160.&lt;/ref&gt; The second study examined the presence of uncontrolled toxic waste sites in ethnic and racial minority communities, and found that 3 out of every 5 African and Hispanic Americans lived in communities with uncontrolled waste sites.&lt;ref&gt;Colquette and Robertson, 159-161.&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies like the 1987 "Toxic Waste and Race in the United States" by the Commission for Racial Justice found race to be the most influential variable in predicting where waste facilities were located.&lt;ref name="Godsil"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Godsil|first=Rachel D.|title=Remedying Environmental Racism|journal=[[Michigan Law Review]]|year=1991|volume=90|pages=394–395}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Deserting the Perpetrator - Victim Model of studying environmental justice issues, the Economic/Environmental Justice Model utilized a sharper lens to study the many complex factors, accompanied to race, that contributes to the act of environmental racism and injustice. Using this model the role of history and the overlapping of interest groups, stakeholders, and organizations are considered in case studies of environmental racism. For example, Lerner in ''Diamond: A struggle for Environmental Justice in Louisiana's Chemical Corridor'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Diamond: A Struggle for Environmental Justice in Louisiana's Chemical Corridor (Urban and Industrial Environments)|last=Lerner|first=Steve|publisher=The MIT Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-262-62204-2 |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; not only revealed the role of race in the division of Diamond and Norco residents, but he also revealed the historical roles of the Shell Oil Company, the slave ancestry of Diamond residents, and of the history of white workers and families that were dependent upon the rewards of Shell. Involvement of outside organizations, such as the Bucket Brigade and Greenpeace, was also considered in the power that the Diamond community had when battling for environmental justice.

In wartimes, environmental racism can occur and are unearthed to the public through reports. Examining the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Israeli-Palestine conflict]], Friends of the Earth International's Environmental Nakba report brings attention to environmental racism that has occurred in the Gaza Strip. Some Israeli practices include cutting off three days of water supply to refugee Palestinians and destructing farms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://edblogs.columbia.edu/scppx3335-001-2014-1/2014/04/02/beyond-the-us-borders-the-palestinian-israeli-case/#more-354|title=Beyond the US Borders: The Palestinian – Israeli Case {{!}} Environmental Leadership, Action and Ethics|website=edblogs.columbia.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Besides studies that point out cases of environmental racism, studies have also provided information on how to go about changing regulations and preventing environmental racism from happening. In a study by Daum, Stoler and Grant on e-waste management in Accra, Ghana, the importance of engaging with different fields and organizations such as recycling firms, communities, and scrap metal traders, to name a few are emphasized over adaptation strategies such as bans on burning and buy-back schemes that have not caused much effect on changing practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daum|first=Kurt|last2=Stoler|first2=Justin|last3=Grant|first3=Richard J.|date=2017|title=Toward a More Sustainable Trajectory for E-Waste Policy: A Review of a Decade of E-Waste Research in Accra, Ghana|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5334689/|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|volume=14|issue=2|pages=135|doi=10.3390/ijerph14020135|issn=1661-7827|pmc=5334689|pmid=28146075|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=September 2013|title=Environmental Nakba|url=https://www.foei.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/06-foei-palestine-report-eng-lr.pdf|journal=Friends of the Earth International Report|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have also shown that since environmental laws have become prominent in the U.S. as well as Europe so companies have moved their waste towards the global south. The Third World has less of a focus on environmental concerns and therefore are susceptible to more discriminatory practices. This has not stopped activism however it has limited the effects activism has on political restrictions. As these activists push on there are still companies destroying land in these countries with harmful chemicals that are cheaper to use. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/08941920802100721|title = Third World Environmental Justice| journal=Society &amp; Natural Resources| volume=21| issue=7| pages=547–555|year = 2008|last1 = Schroeder|first1 = Richard| last2=Martin| first2=Kevin St.| last3=Wilson| first3=Bradley| last4=Sen| first4=Debarati}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Activism ===
Manifestations of environmental racism predate the coining of such terminology. Before the 1970s, communities of color recognized this reality and organized against it. For example, the [[Black Panther Party]] organized survival programs that confronted the inequitable distribution of trash in predominantly black neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt; (1973). The Black Panther. Retrieved from http://www.itsabouttimebpp.com/Survival_Programs/pdf/Survival_Programs.pdf &lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Young Lords]], a Puerto Rican revolutionary nationalist organization based in Chicago and New York City, protested pollution and toxic refuse present in their community via their Garbage Offensive program. These and other organizations also worked to confront the maldistribution of open spaces, toxic lead paint, and healthy food options.&lt;ref&gt;Enck-Wanzer, D. (2010). ''The Young Lords: A Reader''. New York: New York University Press&lt;/ref&gt; They also offered health programs to those affected by preventable, environmentally induced diseases such as tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;Enck-Wanzer, D. (2010). ''The Young Lords: A Reader''. New York: New York University Press&lt;/ref&gt;
In this way, these organizations serve as precursors to more pointed movements against environmental racism.

[[Martin Luther King Jr.|Martin Luther King Jr]]. helped to bring light to the injustices done to many low-income neighborhoods and the working conditions of African-Americans. In the year before his assassination, [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] was in the midst of organizing a protest in Washington to create a bill to help the poor and homeless in the United States. After his assassination  and even with the push of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), this bill would never come to pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/martin-luther-king-jr---8-peaceful-protests-that-bolstered-civil-rights.html|title=Martin Luther King Jr.: 8 peaceful protests that bolstered civil rights|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latino ranch laborers composed by Cesar Chavez battled for working environment rights, including insurance from harmful pesticides in the homestead fields of California's San Joaquin Valley. In 1967, African-American understudies rioted in the streets of Houston to battle a city trash dump in their locale which had killed two kids. In 1968, occupants of West Harlem, in New York City, battled unsuccessfully against the siting of a sewage treatment plant in their neighborhood. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nrdc.org/stories/environmental-justice-movement|title=The Environmental Justice Movement|work=NRDC|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One approach in activism is promoting the development and manufacturing of renewable energy sources and the integration of health, economic and preparedness issues into climate policies. However, despite President Bill Clinton’s executive order 12898, there remains differences between policy and action that advocacy groups continue to address.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White-Newsome|first=Jalonne Lynay|date=2016-07-02|title=A Policy Approach Toward Climate Justice|journal=The Black Scholar|language=en|volume=46|issue=3|pages=12–26|doi=10.1080/00064246.2016.1188353|issn=0006-4246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With time environmental justice and civil rights movements fused together and as a result environmental justice organizations stood up for more ethnic groups and this increased diversity within the organization. The fusion is very logical since the people who suffer the most are minority groups. One of the main environmental problems that minority groups suffer from is uncontrolled toxic wastes. The factor that initiated environmental justice is the relationship between the geography of minority groups and hazardous waste landfills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rdcu.be/bb1lL|title=Cities in the new millennium: Environmental justice, the spatialization of race, and combating anti-urbanism|website=rdcu.be|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When environmental racism became acknowledged in the US society, it stimulated the environmental justice social movement that gained wave throughout the 1970s and 1980s in the US. Historically, the term environmental racism has had ties with the environmental justice movement.  However, this has changed with time to the extent it is believed to lack any associations with the movement. Grassroots organizations and campaigns have sprung up in response to this environmental racism with these groups mainly demanding the inclusion of minorities when it comes to policy making involving the environment. It is also worth noting that this concept is international despite being coined in the US. A perfect example is when the United States exported its hazardous wastes to the poor nations in the Global South because they knew that these countries had lax environmental regulations and safety practices. Marginalized communities are usually at risk of environmental racism because they resource and means to oppose the large companies that dump these dangerous wastes.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  As already stated, environmental racism is international, implying that it not only occurs in the United States. 

===Policies and International agreements===
The [[global waste trade|export of hazardous waste]] to third world countries is another growing concern. Between 1989 and 1994, an estimated 2,611 metric tons of hazardous waste was exported from Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries to non-OECD countries. Two international agreements were passed in response to the growing exportation of hazardous waste into their borders. The Organization of African Unity (OAU) was concerned that the Basel Convention adopted in March 1989 did not include a total ban on the trans-boundary movement on hazardous waste. In response to their concerns, on January 30, 1991, the Pan-African Conference on Environmental and Sustainable Development adopted the Bamako Convention banning the import of all hazardous waste into Africa and limiting their movement within the continent. In September 1995, the G-77 nations helped amend the Basel Convention to ban the export of all hazardous waste from industrial countries (mainly OECD countries and Lichtenstein) to other countries.&lt;ref name=Bullard&gt;{{cite web|last=Bullard |first=Robert |title=Confronting Environmental Racism in the Twenty-First Century |url=http://www.worlddialogue.org/content.php?id=179 |publisher=Global Dialogue |accessdate=November 19, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426041754/http://www.worlddialogue.org/content.php?id=179 |archivedate=April 26, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[globalization]] and the increase in transnational agreements, introduce possibilities for cases of environmental racism. For example, the 1994 [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) attracted US-owned factories to Mexico, where toxic waste was abandoned in the Colonia Chilpancingo community and was not cleaned up until activists called for the Mexican government to clean up the waste.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the US, the environmental justice movement uses the Civil Rights Act (CRA) of 1964 to combat environmental racism in legal cases. For example, the CRA was used in the 1994 lawsuit against the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority which failed to provide services for poor LA County residents.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In Canada, progress is being made to address environmental racism (especially in Nova Scotia's [[Africville]] community) with the passing of Bill 111, An Act to Address Environmental Racism in the Nova Scotia Legislature.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 

In response to fatal diesel pollution in the air around ports in Los Angeles and Long Beach in 2006, the San Pedro Bay Ports Clean Air Action Plan, or CAAP, was passed.&lt;ref&gt;Juan De Lara (2018) [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/24694452.2017.1393328 “This Port Is Killing People”]: Sustainability without Justice in the Neo-Keynesian Green City, Annals of the American Association of Geographers, 108:2, 538-548, DOI: 10.1080/24694452.2017.1393328&lt;/ref&gt; The action plan was created to reduce pollution caused by ports; specifically, it demanded a 45% decrease in pollution once the proposal was put into action. &lt;ref&gt;De Lara 2017, p. 540.&lt;/ref&gt; Another layer of the plan’s objective was to reduce negative environmental impacts from trucks with the initial plans for the Clean Truck Program (CTP), which intended to cut back on the use of shipping trucks from the docks and instead called for purer options like rail yards and warehouses that could hopefully improve the air quality. &lt;ref&gt;De Lara 2017, p. 540.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Erin J. Sharma''' ([[née]] Donald, born April 24, 1976) is a former [[correction officer]] for the United States [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]]. She was sentenced to life in federal prison in 2009 for causing the beating death of an inmate at the [[Incarceration in the United States#Security levels|maximum security]] unit of the [[Coleman Federal Correctional Complex]] near [[Coleman, Florida]].  Prosecutors said that after inmate Richard Delano grabbed her arm through a food slot and bruised it, she and another guard (later revealed to be her supervisor) arranged for him to be assigned to share a cell with a notoriously violent inmate, knowing Delano would be harmed.&lt;ref name= "OcalaTrial"&gt;{{ cite news

==Early life==
Sharma was the daughter of a [[United States Army|Army]] soldier, and moved around frequently during her childhood.  She graduated high school a year early, and began working as a corrections officer in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] in 1997.  She married Rajesh "Roger" Sharma, a fellow corrections officer, in 1999.  They moved together to [[Edgefield, South Carolina]]; where Erin got a job as a corrections officer at [[Federal Correctional Institution, Edgefield|FCI Edgefield]].  When they gave birth to a daughter, they decided to move to Florida to be closer to Erin's mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ocala.com/article/20090810/ARTICLES/908101006/1001/NEWS01|title=Ex-guard awaits sentencing for inmate death|last=Lee|first=Suevon|publisher=''[[Star-Banner]]''|date=2009-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inmate death==
On February 3, 2005, Richard Allen Delano, a convicted [[methamphetamine]] dealer, grabbed Sharma's arm through a food slot, bruising it.  She then said to him, "You're a dead man".&lt;ref name= "OcalaTrial"/&gt; She received minor first aid treatment and was sent home for the rest of the day.&lt;ref name= "OcalaGuardTestifies"/&gt;
On March 1, Delano, who had a reputation as a [[Informant|snitch]],&lt;ref name= "OcalaLife"&gt;{{ cite news

was transferred into a cell with John Javilo "Animal" McCullah, a convicted murderer who had assaulted all of his previous cellmates. Prior to the transfer, witnesses overheard Sharma encouraging McCullah to attack Delano, but to do so on a day when she was not at work.&lt;ref name="Sentinel"&gt;{{ cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 4, while Sharma was on a three-day vacation, Delano was beaten into a coma. He died 13 days later.
Sharma was charged with two [[felony]] counts of violating Delano's [[civil rights]] under [[color (law)|color of law]] for conspiring to have him killed and with violating his Constitutional right not to be subjected to [[cruel and unusual punishment]].&lt;ref name= "OcalaTrial"/&gt;

==Trial==
At the federal trial in [[Orlando]], the prosecution showed that Sharma and an alleged corrections officer co-conspirator knew that McCullah, who had been placed on special single-cell hold status, was likely to assault Delano.&lt;ref name= "Sentinel"/&gt;
In his opening statement, federal prosecutor Douglas Kern told the jury that putting Delano into a cell with McCullah "was like putting a sheep in a cage with a wolf". Kern described McCullah as a "hugely violent, racist gang member inmate" who was a member of the [[Aryan Brotherhood]] [[prison gang]]. He described Sharma as the "puppet master," and McCullah as her puppet.&lt;ref name= "OcalaTrial"/&gt;

FBI Agent James Raby testified about three unrecorded interviews conducted with Sharma following the assault.  Raby said Sharma had acknowledged knowing Delano's reputation as a snitch, knowing that McCullah was notoriously violent, and knowing that the shared cell arrangement would "invariably"&lt;!--word the newspaper uses--&gt; lead to an assault.  He said Sharma had expressed regret about the assault.  Various witnesses described Sharma as a vengeful officer who played favorites and hated snitches.&lt;ref name= "OcalaGuardTestifies"/&gt;

When her own turn to testify came, Sharma denied having made the statements that Raby testified to, and denied telling him that she felt "haunted" by the assault.  She said her threats were clearly jokes, and that she "treated those inmates almost like they were my kids."&lt;ref name= "OcalaGuardTestifies"&gt;{{ cite news

==Sentence==
On October 26, 2009, Senior U.S. District Judge [[Patricia C. Fawsett]] sentenced the 33-year-old Sharma to life in federal prison.  Fawsett said Delano's death was "an expectable result" of the transfer, and that she "took advantage of her superior position" to gain revenge on Delano. Therefore, Delano's death amounted to [[second-degree murder]].  Fawsett also found that Sharma had [[perjury|perjured]] herself on the witness stand when she disputed Raby's testimony, saying that it ran counter to "the overwhelming evidence" of Sharma's involvement in the crime. The perjury finding qualified Sharma for a two-level [[obstruction of justice]] upward departure from the federal [[sentencing guidelines]].&lt;ref name= "OcalaLife"/&gt;  Sharma's attorney said he would file an appeal.&lt;ref name= "Sentinel"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Ocala"&gt;{{ cite news

The location where Sharma is serving her sentence is something of a mystery.  According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons website, Sharma is assigned to the Residential Reentry Management Field Office in [[Kansas City, Missouri]]; she was previously assigned to the RRM field office in [[Sacramento, California]].  However, RRMs are not prison facilities, but are merely an administrative designation for inmates assigned to home-confinement, "halfway-houses", or state and county correctional facilities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bop.gov/locations/ccm/csc/&lt;/ref&gt;  Since she is serving a life sentence, this designation almost certainly means that she was originally held in a California state prison before being transferred to a Missouri state prison.  However, a search of the Missouri Department of Corrections inmate database does not reveal anyone being held under her name, and an earlier search of the California Department of Corrections database did not turn up anyone under her name either.  This suggests that she is being held under an alias, which would not be unusual for a former correctional officer.

Following the fatal assault, McCullah was temporarily transferred to the [[United States Penitentiary, Florence ADX]], the federal [[supermax]] prison in Colorado. After this he was transferred to the [[Federal Correctional Complex, Victorville|Federal Correctional Institution, Victorville]], a medium security facility in California.  Currently he is serving his sentence in the Special Management Unit at the [[United States Penitentiary, Lewisburg]] Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ocala.com/article/20091027/ARTICLES/910271010/1001/NEWS01?Title=Guard-sentenced-to-life-in-prison&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/InmateFinderServlet?Transaction=IDSearch&amp;needingMoreList=false&amp;IDType=IRN&amp;IDNumber=03040-063&amp;x=99&amp;y=14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second officer==
During Sharma's trial, Raby testified that Sharma's supervisor, Michael Kennedy, proposed that Delano be transferred into a cell with McCullah, believing that McCullah would give Delano "a good [butt] kicking and head-knocking".
On November 2, 2009, the U.S. Justice Department announced that a grand jury had indicted Kennedy on one count of conspiring to violate Delano's federal civil rights and one count of violating his civil rights by arranging for another inmate to assault him.&lt;ref name= "OcalaKennedy "&gt;{{ cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8712">[[File:Existential crisis.jpg|thumb|Feelings of loneliness and insignificance in the face of nature are common in existential crisis.]]
An '''existential crisis''' is a moment at which an individual questions if their life has [[Meaning of life|meaning]], purpose, or value.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fAFg7z93gDwC&amp;pg=PA13 |title=Crisis intervention strategies |author=Richard K. James}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be commonly, but not necessarily, tied to depression or inevitably negative speculations on purpose in life (e.g., "if one day I will be forgotten, what is the point of all of my work?"). This issue of the meaning and purpose of human [[existence]] is a major focus of the [[philosophy|philosophical]] tradition of [[existentialism]].

== Description ==
{{Original research|section|date=March 2016}}
An existential crisis may result from, be [[misdiagnosis|misdiagnosed]] as, or be combined with:{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}
* [[Major depressive disorder]]
* [[Depersonalization disorder]]
* [[Borderline personality disorder]]
* [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder]]
* [[Alcohol use disorder]]
* Major sleep deprivation
* Prolonged isolation
* Dissatisfaction with one's life
* Major psychological trauma
* Psychedelic drug trip
* The sense of [[solitude|being alone]] and [[social isolation|isolated]] in the world;
* A new-found grasp or appreciation of one's mortality, perhaps following diagnosis of a major health concern such as a terminal illness;
* Believing that one's life has no purpose or [[interpersonal relationship|external]] meaning;
* Searching for the [[meaning of life]];
* Shattering of one's sense of reality, or how the world is;
* An extremely pleasurable or hurtful experience that leaves one seeking meaning;
* Realizing that the [[Universe]] is more complex, mysterious, and larger beyond current human understanding; 

An existential crisis is often provoked by a significant event in the person's life—psychological trauma, marriage, separation, major loss, the death of a loved one, a life-threatening experience, a new love partner, psychoactive drug use, adult children leaving home, reaching a personally significant age (turning 16, turning 40, etc.), etc. Usually, it provokes the sufferer's [[introspection]] about personal mortality, thus revealing the [[psychological repression]] of said awareness.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

An existential crisis may resemble [[anomie]] (a personal condition resulting from a lack of [[Norm (sociology)|norms]]) or a [[midlife crisis]]. An existential crisis may stem from one's new perception of life and existence. Analogously, existentialism posits that a person ''can and does'' define the meaning and purpose of his or her life, and therefore must ''choose'' to resolve the crisis of [[existence]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In existentialist philosophy, the term 'existential crisis' specifically relates to the crisis of the individual when they realize that they must always define their own lives through the choices they make. The existential crisis occurs when one recognizes that even the decision to either refrain from action or withhold assent to a particular choice is, in itself, a choice. In other words, humankind is "condemned" to freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Flynn|first=Thomas|title=Jean-Paul Sartre|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sartre/#Ont|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Handling ==
Existential crisis has often been negatively associated with [[Depression (mood)|depression]].

[[Peter Wessel Zapffe]], a [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] [[philosopher]] and adherent of [[Existential nihilism|nihilism]] and [[antinatalism]], asserted in his book, ''[[The Last Messiah]]'', four ways that he believed all [[self-consciousness|self-conscious]] beings use in order to cope with their apprehension of indifference and absurdity in existence, comprising "anchoring", "isolation", "distraction", and "sublimation":&lt;ref&gt;Zapffe, Peter Wessel, {{cite web | title=The Last Messiah | work=Philosophy Now | url=http://www.philosophynow.org/issue45/45zapffe.htm | accessdate=April 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Anchoring'' is the "fixation of points within, or construction of walls around, the liquid fray of consciousness". The anchoring mechanism provides individuals with a value or an ideal that allows them to focus their attentions in a consistent manner. Zapffe also applied the anchoring principle to society, and stated "God, the Church, the State, morality, fate, the laws of life, the people, the future" are all examples of collective primary anchoring firmaments.
* ''Isolation'' is "a fully arbitrary dismissal from consciousness of all disturbing and destructive thought and feeling".
* ''Distraction'' occurs when "one limits attention to the critical bounds by constantly enthralling it with impressions". Distraction focuses all of one's energy on a task or idea to prevent the mind from turning in on itself.
* ''[[Sublimation (psychology)|Sublimation]]'' is the refocusing of energy away from negative outlets, toward positive ones. Individuals distance themselves and look at their existence from an aesthetic point of view (e.g., writers, poets, painters). Zapffe himself pointed out that his written works were the product of sublimation.

==Cultural contexts==
In the 19th century, [[Kierkegaard]] considered that [[angst]] and existential despair would appear when an inherited or borrowed world-view (often of a collective nature) proved unable to handle unexpected and extreme life-experiences.&lt;ref&gt;S. Kierkegaard, ''The Sickness unto Death'' (1980) p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nietzsche]] extended his views to suggest that the [[Death of God]]—the loss of collective faith in religion and traditional morality—created a more widespread existential crisis for the philosophically aware.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Camus, ''The Rebel'' (Vintage 1950[?]) p. 66-77&lt;/ref&gt;

Existential crisis has indeed been seen as the inevitable accompaniment of [[modernism]] ({{Circa}}1890–1945).&lt;ref&gt;M. Hardt/K. Weeks, ''The Jameson Reader'' (2000) p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas [[Durkheim]] saw individual crises as the byproduct of social pathology and a (partial) lack of collective norms,&lt;ref&gt;E. Durkeheim, ''[[Suicide (book)|Suicide]]'' (1952) p. 214 and p. 382&lt;/ref&gt; others have seen existentialism as arising more broadly from the modernist crisis of the loss of meaning throughout the modern world.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hardt/K. Weeks, ''The Jameson Reader (2000) p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; Its twin answers were either a religion revivified by the experience of anomie (as with [[Martin Buber]]), or an individualistic existentialism based on facing directly the absurd contingency of human fate within a meaningless and alien universe, as with [[Sartre]] and [[Albert Camus|Camus]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers/G. Hentzi eds., ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995) p. 103-4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Irvin Yalom]], an emeritus professor of psychiatry at Stanford University has made fundamental contributions to the field of [[existential psychotherapy]]. [[Rollo May]] is another of the founders of this approach.

[[Fredric Jameson]] has suggested that [[postmodernism]], with its saturation of social space by a visual consumer culture, has replaced the modernist angst of the traditional subject, and with it the existential crisis of old, by a new social pathology of flattened affect and a fragmented subject.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hardt/K. Weeks, ''The Jameson Reader'' (2000) p. 267-8 and p. 199-200&lt;/ref&gt;

are equivalent (or congruent) if there exists a topological isomorphism &lt;math&gt;T: X\to X'&lt;/math&gt; making [[Commutative diagram|commutative]] the diagram of Figure 1.

[[File:Extensions groups2.png|thumb|Figure 1]]

We say that the topological extension

:&lt;math&gt;0 \rightarrow H\stackrel{i}{\rightarrow} X\stackrel{\pi}{\rightarrow} G\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;

is a ''split extension'' (or splits) if it is equivalent to the trivial extension

:&lt;math&gt;0 \rightarrow H\stackrel{i_H}{\rightarrow} H\times G\stackrel{\pi_G}{\rightarrow} G\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;i_H: H\to H\times G&lt;/math&gt; is the natural inclusion over the first factor and &lt;math&gt;\pi_G: H\times G\to  G&lt;/math&gt; is the natural projection over the second factor.

It is easy to prove that the topological extension  &lt;math&gt;0 \rightarrow H\stackrel{i}{\rightarrow} X\stackrel{\pi}{\rightarrow} G\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; splits if and only if there is a continuous homomorphism &lt;math&gt;R: X \rightarrow H&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;R\circ i&lt;/math&gt; is the identity map on &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the topological extension &lt;math&gt;0 \rightarrow H\stackrel{i}{\rightarrow} X\stackrel{\pi}{\rightarrow} G\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; splits if and only if the subgroup &lt;math&gt;i(H)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Direct sum of topological groups|topological direct summand]] of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==

* Take &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R &lt;/math&gt; the [[real numbers]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z &lt;/math&gt; the [[Integer|integer numbers]]. Take   &lt;math&gt;\imath &lt;/math&gt; the natural inclusion and &lt;math&gt;\pi &lt;/math&gt; the natural projection. Then

:: &lt;math&gt; 0\to \mathbb Z\stackrel{\imath}{\to} \mathbb R \stackrel{\pi}{\to}\mathbb R/\mathbb Z\to 0 &lt;/math&gt;

: is an extension of topological abelian groups. Indeed it is an example of a non-splitting extension.

==Extensions of locally compact abelian groups (LCA)==

An extension of topological abelian groups will be a  short exact sequence &lt;math&gt; 0\to H\stackrel{\imath}{\to} X \stackrel{\pi}{\to}G\to 0 &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;H, X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; are [[Locally compact group|locally compact abelian groups]] and  &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;  are relatively open continuous homomorphisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Fulp | first1=R.O. | last2=Griffith | first2=P.A. | title=Extensions of locally compact abelian groups.

{{NSA surveillance}}
'''Fairview''' is a secret program under which the [[National Security Agency]] cooperates with the American telecommunications company [[AT&amp;T]] in order to collect phone, internet and e-mail data mainly of foreign countries' citizens at major cable landing stations and switching stations inside the United States. The FAIRVIEW program started in 1985, one year after the [[Bell breakup]].&lt;ref name=NYTPP2015&gt;New York Times, [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/us/politics/att-helped-nsa-spy-on-an-array-of-internet-traffic.html?_r=0 AT&amp;T Helped U.S. Spy on Internet on a Vast Scale] &amp; Pro Publica, [https://www.propublica.org/article/nsa-spying-relies-on-atts-extreme-willingness-to-help NSA Spying Relies on AT&amp;T’s ‘Extreme Willingness to Help’], August 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Corporate partner ==
The "key corporate partner" for cooperation under the FAIRVIEW program was first identified on October 23, 2013 by ''[[The Washington Post]]''—quoting NSA historian [[Matthew Aid]]—as
AT&amp;T.&lt;ref name=matthewAid&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/in-the-loop/wp/2013/10/22/whats-the-deal-with-nsas-operation-names/ |title=What's the deal with NSA's operation names? |author=Emily Heil |work=The Washington Post |date=October 22, 2013 |accessdate=2014-03-23 |archivedate=March 23, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OHgpNwv5?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/in-the-loop/wp/2013/10/22/whats-the-deal-with-nsas-operation-names/ |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was confirmed by a joint report by ''Pro Publica'' and ''The New York Times'' from August 15, 2015, based upon NSA documents that describe the company as "highly collaborative" and praise the company's "extreme willingness to help".&lt;ref name=NYTPP2015 /&gt;

In 2011, the FAIRVIEW program cost the NSA $188.9 million, which was twice as much as the costs for [[STORMBREW]], which is the second-largest program.&lt;ref name=NYTPP2015 /&gt;

== Scope of the program ==
According to 2013 revelations by whistleblower [[Edward Snowden]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The NSA partners with a large US telecommunications company ... [which] partners with telecoms in the foreign countries, [which] then allow the US company access to those countries' telecommunications systems, and that access is then exploited to direct traffic to the NSA's repositories.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/07/nsa-brazilians-globo-spying |title=The NSA's mass and indiscriminate spying on Brazilians |author=Glen Greenwald |work=The Guardian |date=July 7, 2013 |accessdate=2013-08-11 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6J5ahUofg?url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/07/nsa-brazilians-globo-spying |archivedate=August 23, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the revelations, the NSA had collected 2.3&amp;nbsp;billion separate pieces of data from Brazilian users in January 2013 alone.&lt;ref name="globo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oglobo.globo.com/mundo/eua-espionaram-milhoes-de-mails-ligacoes-de-brasileiros-8940934 |title=EUA espionaram milhões de e-mails e ligações de brasileiros |author1=Glenn Greenwald |author2=Roberto Kaz |author3=José Casado |work=O Globo |date=July 6, 2013 |accessdate=2014-03-23 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OHg7um4t?url=http://oglobo.globo.com/mundo/eua-espionaram-milhoes-de-mails-ligacoes-de-brasileiros-8940934 |archivedate=March 23, 2014 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several weeks earlier, Snowden had revealed that the NSA was also harvesting the telephone [[metadata]] and text messages from over a billion subscribers in China; however, no precise program name was reported at the time.&lt;ref name="scmp"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1266821/us-hacks-chinese-mobile-phone-companies-steals-sms-data-edward-snowden | title=EXCLUSIVE: US spies on Chinese mobile phone companies, steals SMS data: Edward Snowden |author1=Lana Lam |author2=Stephen Chen | work=South China Morning Post | date=June 22, 2013 | accessdate=2014-03-23 | archivedate=March 23, 2014 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323084637/http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1266821/us-hacks-chinese-mobile-phone-companies-steals-sms-data-edward-snowden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:US-990 Fairview Map - crop.jpg|thumb|right|FAIRVIEW: Map shown on Brazilian television in 2013]]
A slide about the FAIRVIEW program that was seen on Brazilian television in 2013 showed a map with markers all over the United States, but without a legend that explained what they stood for. From a similar map with the proper legend, that was published in August 2015, it became clear that in 2010 the NSA had access to the following AT&amp;T facilities:&lt;ref&gt;Electrospaces.net, [http://electrospaces.blogspot.com/2015/08/fairview-collecting-foreign.html FAIRVIEW: Collecting foreign intelligence inside the US], August 31, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
* 8 [[internet peering point]]s
* 26 [[VoIP]] router facilities
* 1 VoIP hub router facility (with 30 planned)
* 9 submarine [[cable landing point]]s (with 7 planned)
* 16 [[4ESS]] circuit switching stations
Except for the VoIP facilities, most of these access points are situated along the US borders.

== Legal authorities ==
The collection of data under the FAIRVIEW program takes place under different legal authorities: [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act|FISA]], which requires individualized warrants from the FISA Court, section 702 [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 Amendments Act of 2008|FAA]] for when one end of the communications if foreign, and the Transit Authority for when both ends of a communications are foreign.

Under the FAIRVIEW program, AT&amp;T also provided the NSA with domestic telephone metadata in bulk, which was authorized under section 215 of the [[USA PATRIOT Act]]. First this was from landline connections, but in 2011, AT&amp;T also started handing over cell phone metadata: 1.1 billion a day.&lt;ref name=NYTPP2015 /&gt;

The '''Language Strife''' ({{lang-sv|Finska språkstriden|lit=Finnish language dispute}}) was a major conflict in mid-19th century [[History of Finland|Finland]]. Both the [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]] languages were commonly used in Finland at the time, associated with descendants of Swedish colonisation and leading to class tensions among the speakers of the different languages. It became acute in the mid-19th century. The competition was considered to have officially ended when Finnish gained [[official language]] status in 1923 and became equal to the Swedish language.

== Background ==
{{Main|History of Finland}}
{{See also|Finland under Swedish rule}}
Finland had once been under Swedish rule ([[Sweden-Finland]]). [[Swedish language|Swedish]] (with some [[Latin]]) was the language of administration and education in the [[Swedish Realm]]. Swedish was therefore the most-used language of administration and higher education among the Finns. To gain higher education, one had to learn Swedish, and Finnish was considered by the upper classes to be a "language of peasants".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aleksiskivi-kansalliskirjailija.fi/elama/elamakerta/ | title = Aleksis Kivi - Kansalliskirjailija | access-date = 2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://opinnot.internetix.fi/fi/muikku2materiaalit/lukio/hi/hi3/2_autonominen_suomi/12_kielen_asema | title = Suomen kielen asema | author = Minna Helminen | publisher = Otavan Opisto | access-date = 2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immigration of Swedish peasants to Finland's coastal regions also boosted the status of Swedish by sheer number of speakers. Although [[Mikael Agricola]] had started written Finnish with ''[[Abckiria]]'' in the 1500s, and a Finnish translation of the [[Civil Code of 1734]] was published in 1759 (''Ruotzin waldacunnan laki''), it had no official status as a legal publication since the official language of administration was Swedish.&lt;ref name="skvkkh" /&gt;

As a result of the [[Finnish War]], Sweden ceded Finland to [[Russia]] in 1809. Finland became the autonomous [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] within the [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref name="gmsprengtbio"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://kansallisbiografia.fi/kansallisbiografia/henkilo/602 | title = Sprengtporten, Georg Magnus (1740 - 1819) | website = Biografiakeskus | access-date = 2017-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Russian rule, the laws of the Sweden–Finland era remained largely unchanged, and Swedish continued to be used in administration.&lt;ref name="skvkkh"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://journal.fi/tt/article/download/616/506/ | title = Suomen kieli vallan kielenä | author = Kaisa Häkkinen | format = PDF | access-date = 2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language strife became more acute in the second half of the 19th century. [[Johan Vilhelm Snellman]], a Swede who wished to increase education in Finland, became a chief initiator of conflict in the 1850s due to his concern about the changing language use among the educated classes, many of whom were using Russian or Finnish.&lt;ref name="snellmanbiografia"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://kansallisbiografia.fi/english/person/3639 |title= Snellman, Johan Vilhelm (1806 - 1881) |author= Matti Klinge |date= |website= The National Biography of Finland |publisher= |access-date=2017-11-24 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote to [[Zachris Topelius]] in 1860: "My view is this: Whether Russian or Finnish will win, only God knows. I dare not hope for anything. But that Swedish will lose - that I do know."&lt;ref name="snellmanbiografia" /&gt; [[Elias Lönnrot]] compiled the first Finnish-Swedish dictionary (''Finsk-Svenskt lexikon''), completing it in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://kansallisbiografia.fi/kansallisbiografia/henkilo/2836 | title = Lönnrot, Elias (1802 - 1884) | publisher = Biografiakeskus | access-date = 2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nationalism and the question of language ==
[[File:Kiianmies Kyander graves Tampere 20090818.JPG|thumb|right|A set of graves in Tampere, showing the Swedish surname 'Kyander' as well as the Fennicized 'Kiianmies']]

The rise of [[Fennoman]]ic Finnish [[nationalism]] in the 19th century eventually led to the revived predominance of Finnish use in the country. A significant contribution to the Finnish national awakening from the mid-19th century onward came from the members of the mostly [[Swedish-speaking Finns|Swedish-speaking]] upper classes deliberately choosing to promote Finnish culture and language. Snellman was himself was an ethnic Swede and was later ennobled.  These [[Finnish Swedes]], known as the [[Fennomans]], [[Fennicization|Fennicized]] their family names, learned Finnish, and made a point of using Finnish both in public and at home. However, another group of the Swedish-speaking population, the [[Svecomans]], did not wish to abandon Swedish and opposed the Fennoman ideology and Fennoman-inspired reforms.

In 1863 [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] (AsK 26/1863) ruled that Finnish had an [[official language]] status comparable to that of Swedish; it could thereafter be used in an official capacity in legal and state office matters.&lt;ref name="kasf"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://suomifinland100.fi/project/1863-kieliasetus/ | title = 1863 kieliasetus | access-date = 2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ylevierailu" /&gt;&lt;ref name=haar&gt;{{cite book|author=Harald Haarmann |title=Modern Finland: Portrait of a Flourishing Society |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9781476625652 |page=211 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KEA4DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA211 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a generation, the Finnish language use gained predominance in the government and the society of Finland. 

During the [[Russification of Finland]], Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] attempted to change the official language to Russian (''Language Manifesto of 1900''), but Russification was halted by the [[Finnish general strike of 1905|general strike of 1905]].

== After independence ==
After [[Independence of Finland|Finland gained independence]] in 1917, its relations with Sweden unexpectedly became strained in connection with the [[Finnish Civil War]] and the [[Åland crisis]]. These events aggravated the language dispute, and the controversy over Swedish and Finnish became a prominent feature of domestic politics during the 1920s and 1930s.

In the newly independent [[Constitution of Finland|Finnish constitution]] of 1919, Finnish and Swedish were given equal status as national languages. The language strife thereafter centered on this and on the role of Swedish in universities, particularly regarding the number of professors who spoke and wrote in Swedish in their teaching. In the [[interwar period]], the [[University of Helsinki]] was the scene of conflict between those who wanted to advance the use of Finnish and those who wished to maintain the use of Swedish.&lt;ref name=UppslagsFiUniv&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uppslagsverket.fi/sv/sok/view-103684-Universitetsadresserna |title=Universitetsadresserna |author=Lasse Sundman |date=2011-04-24 |website=[[Uppslagsverket Finland]] |publisher= |access-date=2017-11-30 |quote= |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geographer [[Väinö Tanner (geographer)|Väinö Tanner]] was one of the most vocal defenders of Swedish.&lt;ref name=UppslagsverketFi&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uppslagsverket.fi/sv/sok/view-103684-TannerVaeinoe |title=Tanner, Väinö |author=Johan Lindberg |date=2011-08-05 |website=[[Uppslagsverket Finland]] |publisher= |access-date=2017-11-30 |quote= |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; A campaign initiated by the [[Swedish People's Party of Finland]] collected 153,914 signatures in defense of Swedish in a petition that was presented  to the parliament and government in October 1934.&lt;ref name=UppslagsFiUniv/&gt; The conflict at the university generated an international reaction when academics from Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland sent letters to the diplomatic representatives of Finland in their respective countries warning that diminishing the role of Swedish at the university would result in a weakening of Nordic unity.&lt;ref name=UppslagsFiUniv/&gt;

The government issued a language decree on 1 January 1923 making Finnish and Swedish equal in status.&lt;ref name="ylevierailu"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://yle.fi/aihe/artikkeli/2013/06/11/keisarivierailu-vauhditti-yhteiskunnan-muutosta | title = Keisarivierailu vauhditti yhteiskunnan muutosta | author = Rita Trötschkes | publisher = Yle | date = 2013-12-09 | access-date = 2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
During the resettlement of more than 420,000 [[Karelia]]n refugees after the [[Winter War]] against the Soviet Union (1939–1940), the Swedish-speaking minority feared that the new Finnish-speaking settlers would change the linguistic balance of their neighborhoods. Since the late 20th century, there has been discussion of whether the policy of [[mandatory Swedish]] classes in schools should continue.

Modood in: Spencer (2003) p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; It was established in 2001 as an independent [[charitable organization]] with the aim of monitoring media coverage of [[Islam]] and Muslims, and challenging examples of Islamophobia through dialogue with media organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Race and Ethnic studies, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marsh (2006) p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; Since its inception, it has produced numerous publications relating to Islamophobia in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.fairuk.org/pressreleases.htm Forum Against Islamophobia and Racism]" official website, "Press releases."&lt;/ref&gt; Formed in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;http://en.trend.az/news/politics/1500402.html&lt;/ref&gt; Navid Akhtar and Samar Mashadi have been directors of FAIR.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jta.org/2009/02/05/news-opinion/world/fear-and-loathing-in-europe-islamophobia-and-the-challenge-of-integration&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims and activities==

According to the group's mission statement, it was set up "for the purpose of raising awareness of and combating Islamophobia and racism, monitoring specific incidents of Islamophobia and racism, working towards eliminating religious and racial discrimination, campaigning and lobbying on issues relevant to Muslim and other multi-ethnic communities in Britain."&lt;ref name="S106"/&gt;

FAIR was active in campaigning for passing of the [[Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006]] which outlawed the incitement towards religious hatred in Britain. They issued a [[memorandum]] in 2002 entitled "''The Religious Offences Bill: A Response''" to the [[House of Lords]] Select Committee in which they raised a number of publications by the far-right [[British National Party]] inciting hatred against Islam and the Muslim community in Britain, stating that this exposed a loophole in British law wherein some communities were protected from incitement to hatred whilst others were not.&lt;ref&gt;McGhee (2005) p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, FAIR reported 29 incidents of assault or attacks against Muslims for that year, though they believe many went unreported. This included attacks on Muslim women and people wearing [[Hijab|traditional Muslim clothes]], as well as vandalism of [[mosque]]s and Islamic centers. Also reported were desecration of Muslim graves.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2004/35492.htm Annual Report on International Religious Freedom]'' (2005). Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor; [[US Department of State]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the FAIR carried out a survey in association with the Muslim College and the Al-Khoei Foundation which found that since the [[September 11 attacks]], 80 percent of Muslims surveyed reported being subjected to Islamophobia; 68 percent believed they had been treated and perceived differently; and 32 percent reported being discriminated against at [[List of airports in the United Kingdom|airports in the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;See:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11371">In [[physics]], a '''free particle''' is a particle that, in some sense, is not bound by an external force, or equivalently not in a region where its potential energy varies. In classical physics, this means the particle is present in a "field-free" space. In quantum mechanics, it means a region of uniform potential, usually set to zero in the region of interest since potential can be arbitrarily set to zero at any point (or surface in three dimensions) in space.

==Classical free particle==

The classical free particle is characterized simply by a fixed [[velocity]] '''v'''. The [[momentum]] is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}=m\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;

and the [[kinetic energy]] (equal to total energy) by

:&lt;math&gt;E=\frac{1}{2}mv^2=\frac{p^2}{2m}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is the mass of the particle and '''v''' is the vector velocity of the particle.

==Quantum free particle==

[[File:Propagation of a de broglie wave.svg|290px|"290px"|right|thumb|Propagation of [[matter wave|de Broglie waves]] in 1d - real part of the [[complex number|complex]] amplitude is blue, imaginary part is green. The probability (shown as the colour [[opacity (optics)|opacity]]) of finding the particle at a given point ''x'' is spread out like a waveform, there is no definite position of the particle. As the amplitude increases above zero the [[curvature]] decreases, so the decreases again, and vice versa - the result is an alternating amplitude: a wave. Top: [[Plane wave]]. Bottom: [[Wave packet]].]]

===Mathematical description===

{{main|Schrödinger equation|Matter wave}}

A free particle in non-relativistic quantum mechanics is described by the free [[Schrödinger equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt; - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 \ \psi(\mathbf{r}, t) = i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \psi (\mathbf{r}, t) &lt;/math&gt;

where ψ is the [[wavefunction]] of the particle at position '''r''' and time ''t''. The solution for a particle with momentum '''p''' or [[wave vector]] '''k''', at [[angular frequency]] ω or energy ''E'', is given by the [[complex number|complex]] [[plane wave]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \psi(\mathbf{r}, t) = Ae^{i(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}-\omega t)} = Ae^{i(\mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{r}-E t)/\hbar} &lt;/math&gt;

with [[amplitude]] ''A''. As for ''all'' quantum particles free ''or'' bound, the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]]s

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta p_x \Delta x \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}&lt;/math&gt; there is no energy time uncertainty unlike presumed.&lt;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01637-7&gt;

(similarly for the ''y'' and ''z'' directions), and the [[De Broglie relations]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{p} = \hbar \mathbf{k}, \quad E = \hbar \omega&lt;/math&gt;

apply. Since the potential energy is (set to) zero, the total energy ''E'' is equal to the kinetic energy, which has the same form as in classical physics:

:&lt;math&gt; E = T \,\rightarrow \,\frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} =\hbar \omega &lt;/math&gt;

===Measurement and calculations===

The integral of the [[probability density function]]

:&lt;math&gt; \rho(\mathbf{r},t) = \psi^*(\mathbf{r},t)\psi(\mathbf{r},t) = |\psi(\mathbf{r},t)|^2&lt;/math&gt;

where * denotes [[complex conjugate]], over all space is the probability of finding the particle in all space, which must be unity if the particle exists:

:&lt;math&gt; \int_\mathrm{all\,space} |\psi(\mathbf{r},t)|^2 d^3 \mathbf{r}=1&lt;/math&gt;

This is the normalization condition for the wave function. The wavefunction is not normalizable for a plane wave, but is for a [[wavepacket]].

===Fourier decomposition===
The free particle wave function may be represented by a superposition of ''momentum'' eigenfunctions, with coefficients given by the [[Fourier transform]] of the initial wavefunction:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Section 4.1&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \psi(\mathbf{r}, t) =\frac{1}{(\sqrt{2\pi})^3} \int_\mathrm{all \, \textbf{k} \, space}  \hat \psi_0 (\mathbf{k})e^{i(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}-\omega t)} d^3 \mathbf{k} &lt;/math&gt;

where the integral is over all '''k'''-space and &lt;math&gt; \omega = \omega(\mathbf{k}) = \frac{\hbar \mathbf{k}^2}{2m}&lt;/math&gt; (to ensure that the wave packet is a solution of the free particle Schrödinger equation). Here &lt;math&gt;\psi_0&lt;/math&gt; is the value of the wave function at time 0 and &lt;math&gt;\hat\psi_0&lt;/math&gt; is the Fourier transform of &lt;math&gt;\psi_0&lt;/math&gt;. (The Fourier transform &lt;math&gt;\hat\psi_0(\mathbf k)&lt;/math&gt; is essentially the [[Wave_function#Momentum-space_wave_functions|momentum wave function]] of the position wave function &lt;math&gt;\psi_0(\mathbf r)&lt;/math&gt;, but written as a function of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf k&lt;/math&gt; rather than &lt;math&gt;\mathbf p=\hbar\mathbf k&lt;/math&gt;.)

The expectation value of the momentum '''p''' for the complex plane wave is

:&lt;math&gt; \langle\mathbf{p}\rangle=\left\langle \psi \left|-i\hbar\nabla\right|\psi\right\rangle = \hbar\mathbf{k} &lt;/math&gt;,

and for the general wave packet it is

:&lt;math&gt; \langle\mathbf{p}\rangle = \int_\mathrm{all\,space} \psi^*(\mathbf{r},t)(-i\hbar\nabla)\psi(\mathbf{r},t) d^3 \mathbf{r} = \int_\mathrm{all \, \textbf{k} \, space} \hbar \mathbf{k} |\hat\psi_0(\mathbf{k})|^2  d^3 \mathbf{k} &lt;/math&gt;.

The expectation value of the energy E is 

:&lt;math&gt; \langle E\rangle=\left\langle \psi \left|- \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 \right|\psi\right\rangle = \int_\mathrm{all\,space} \psi^*(\mathbf{r},t)\left(- \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 \right)\psi(\mathbf{r},t) d^3 \mathbf{r} &lt;/math&gt;.

===Group velocity and phase velocity===
[[File:Wave_packet_propagation.png|thumb|right|Propagation of a wave packet, with the motion of a single peak shaded in purple. The peaks move at the phase velocity while the overall packet moves at the group velocity.]]
The [[phase velocity]] is defined to be the speed at which a plane wave solution propagates, namely

:&lt;math&gt; v_p=\frac{\omega}{k}=\frac{\hbar k}{2m} = \frac{p}{2m} &lt;/math&gt;.

Note that &lt;math&gt;\frac{p}{2m}&lt;/math&gt; is ''not'' the speed of a classical particle with momentum &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;; rather, it is half of the classical velocity.

Meanwhile, suppose that the initial wave function &lt;math&gt;\psi_0&lt;/math&gt; is a [[wave packet]] whose Fourier transform &lt;math&gt;\hat\psi_0&lt;/math&gt; is concentrated near a particular wave vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf k&lt;/math&gt;. Then the [[group velocity]] of the plane wave is defined as

:&lt;math&gt; v_g= \nabla\omega(\mathbf k)=\frac{\hbar\mathbf k}{m}=\frac{\mathbf p}{m}&lt;/math&gt;,

which agrees with the formula for the classical velocity of the particle. The group velocity is the (approximate) speed at which the whole wave packet propagates, while the phase velocity is the speed at which the individual peaks in the wave packet move.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Sections 4.3 and 4.4&lt;/ref&gt; The figure illustrates this phenomenon, with the individual peaks within the wave packet propagating at half the speed of the overall packet.

===Spread of the wave packet===
The notion of group velocity is based on a linear approximation to the dispersion relation &lt;math&gt;\omega(k)&lt;/math&gt; near a particular value of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Equation 4.24&lt;/ref&gt; In this approximation, the amplitude of the wave packet moves at a velocity equal to the group velocity ''without changing shape''. This result is an approximation that fails to capture certain interesting aspects of the evolution a free quantum particle. Notably, the width of the wave packet, as measured by the uncertainty in the position, grows linearly in time for large times. This phenomenon is called the [[Wave_packet#Gaussian_wave_packets_in_quantum_mechanics|spread of the wave packet]] for a free particle.

Specifically, it is not difficult to compute an exact formula for the uncertainty &lt;math&gt;\Delta_{\psi(t)}X&lt;/math&gt; as a function of time, where &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is the position operator. Working in one spatial dimension for simplicity, we have:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Proposition 4.10&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(\Delta_{\psi(t)}X)^2=\frac{t^2}{m^2}(\Delta_{\psi_0}P)^2+\frac{2t}{m}\left(\left\langle \frac{XP+PX}{2}\right\rangle_{\psi_0}-\left\langle X\right\rangle_{\psi_0} \left\langle P\right\rangle_{\psi_0} \right)+(\Delta_{\psi_0}X)^2&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;\psi_0&lt;/math&gt; is the time-zero wave function. The expression in parentheses in the second term on the right-hand side is the quantum covariance of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, for large positive times, the uncertainty in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; grows linearly, with the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; equal to &lt;math&gt;(\Delta_{\psi_0}P)/m&lt;/math&gt;. If the momentum of the initial wave function &lt;math&gt;\psi_0&lt;/math&gt; is highly localized, the wave packet will spread slowly and the group-velocity approximation will remain good for a long time. Intuitively, this result says that if the initial wave function has a very sharply defined momentum, then the particle has a sharply defined velocity and will (to good approximation) propagate at this velocity for a long time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5700">'''Global Map''' is a set of digital maps that accurately cover the whole globe to express the status of global environment. It is developed through the cooperation of [[National mapping agency|National Geospatial Information Authorities]] (NGIAs) in the world. An initiative to develop Global Map under [[Multilateralism|international cooperation]], the Global Mapping Project, was advocated in 1992 by Ministry of Construction, Japan (MOC) at the time (the current [[Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (Japan)|Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, Japan]]-MLIT).

Global Map is digital [[geospatial information]] in 1&amp;nbsp;km [[Optical resolution|resolution]] which satisfies the following conditions:
# Covering the whole land area of the [[globe]]
# In consistent specifications
# Easily accessible by anyone in marginal cost
The global geospatial information developed as Global Map mainly consists of the following thematic layers:
* [[Transportation]] 
* [[Border|Boundary]] 
* [[Drainage]] 
* Population Centers 
* [[Elevation]] 
* [[Vegetation]] （Percent Tree Cover） 
* [[Land Cover]] 
* [[Land Use]]

== History of the Global Mapping Project ==
Since the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] in 1972, global environmental challenges have been recognized as an issue which is common to humankind. “The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (the [[Earth Summit]])” in Brazil in 1992 adopted “An action plan of humankind for sustainable development: [[Agenda 21]].” Agenda 21 describes in many parts the importance of information for decision-making to appropriately cope with global environmental challenges. Especially geospatial information is regarded to be critical.

In response to the objectives of Agenda 21 and in recognition of the need for further contribution to the development of geospatial information, the MOC at the time (the current MLIT) advocated, in the same year, the Global Mapping Project, an international cooperation initiative to develop global geospatial information to understand the present status and changes of global environment. This concept was presented at the Fifth United Nations Regional Cartographic Conference for the Americas in New York in 1993. At the same time, resolution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|publisher=United Nations Economic and Social Council
|accessdate=2012-03-23
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
calling for the promotion of the development of global geospatial data was adopted at this conference. Following this conference, a similar resolution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|publisher=United Nations Economic and Social Council
|accessdate=2012-03-23
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
was adopted at Thirteenth United Nations Regional Cartographic Conference for Asia and the Pacific in Beijing in 1994.
 
In 1996, International Steering Committee for Global Mapping (ISCGM), which consists of heads or its equivalents of NGIAs, was established to promote the Global Mapping Project. Thus the mechanism for the international promotion was formed. The [[Geospatial Information Authority of Japan]] (GSI) has been serving as the secretariat of the ISCGM. In the following year, in 1997, which was five years after the Earth Summit, the nineteenth [[United Nations General Assembly#Special sessions|special session of the United Nations General Assembly]] (19th UNGASS) was held. At the paragraph 112 of the resolution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21
|date=1997-06-28
|publisher=United Nations
|accessdate=2012-02-26
}}&lt;/ref&gt; adopted by the 19th UNGASS, importance of a supportive environment to enhance national capacities and capabilities for information collection and processing, especially in developing countries, to facilitate public access to information on global environmental issues was mentioned along with the description mentioning the significance of international cooperation, including global mapping, as a means to develop the supportive environment.

As a result of such movement, In 1998, a recommendatory letter to participate in the Global Mapping Project was sent from the [[United Nations]] to NGIAs of respective countries in the world.

Further, at the [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] (Johannesburg Summit) held in 2002, global mapping was included in the Plan of Implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Global Peace System''' is a concept of global [[conflict resolution]] dependent on nonviolent processes to eradicate war. It relies upon a multi-strand approach to conflict resolution, incorporating broad social and political solutions. In contemporary [[peace and conflict studies]], the concept of a global peace system has been evolving since the 1940s around the theory that there is a global infrastructure of peacebuilding and that there is a need for [[systems thinking]] in peacebuilding.&lt;ref&gt;See Zelizer 2013 and Ricigliano 2013; peacebuilding here is considered as integrated efforts in numerous sectors ranging from humanitarian relief to international development (Zelizer, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;  The term "global peace system" was coined from the work of Robert Johansen, who explored the concept in 1978's ''Toward a Dependable Place''.&lt;ref name=Mc2007&gt;McElwee 2007, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

An early use of the term “peace system” occurred in Kirby Page’s book ''National Defense'' (1931).&lt;ref&gt; See p. vi (paragraph 4) and pp. 348, 357; p. vi, "Confronted with an ominous world situation, shall we seek security in increased armaments or shall we put our reliance in a peace system?" The book ends (p. 357) by calling on "the individual citizen . . . to dedicate himself to the task of strengthening the peace system." &lt;/ref&gt; In a 1943 pamphlet and a 1966 book, political theorist David Mitrany stated that the prevention of wars required the creation of a peace system which he outlined.&lt;ref&gt;Mitrany 1966&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978's ''Toward a Dependable Place'', Johansen coined the term "global peace system",&lt;ref name=Mc2007/&gt; arguing that, contrary to the advocated and perceived military security in the international system, the peace system provides greater justice, economic well-being and ecological security. In a global peace system, according to Johansen, "conflict is resolved through nonviolent, political, social, and judicial processes. There are no expectations of war and no national military arsenals."&lt;ref&gt;Johansen 1978 p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Johansen called for the creation of such a system by a people’s movement.

In 1988, Robert A. Irwin stated that a peace system involves multiple war prevention layers: first, global reforms which reduce the causes of war involve non-threatening defense-policies as well as political, economic, ecological and cultural change; second, conflict resolution mechanisms on the local, regional, national and global level.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Louise Diamond and John W. McDonald authored ''Multi-track Diplomacy: a Systems Approach to Peace'', wherein they identified nine specific tracks to produce a synergy in peacebuilding: public opinion and communication, government, professional conflict resolution, business, private citizens, activism, religion, funding, and research, training and education.&lt;ref&gt;Institute for Multi-track Diplomacy "Building Peace"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diamond and McDonald 1993&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the pair founded the United States-based non-profit organization [[Institute for Multi-track Diplomacy]] with the mission of putting into practice their systems-based approach to peacebuilding.&lt;ref&gt;Institute for Multi-track Diplomacy "Mission"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003's ''Instead of War: the Urgency and Promise of the Global Peace System'', Timothy McElwee emphasizes three major focal areas in the construction of a global peace system: (1) strengthening international norms and institutions against war; (2) eliminating the conditions that give rise to war and violence; (3) supporting and encouraging alternative means of international conflict transformation.&lt;ref&gt;McElwee 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Other sector-based approaches to peacebuilding link international development, humanitarian assistance, gender, the private sector, religion, environmental change, security, media, health and the rule of law.&lt;ref&gt;Zelizer 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Kent Shifferd proposed that there is a good chance to outlaw war within the next 100 years. Examining the history of peace, Shifferd posits that there has been more peace than war in history and numerous peace movements were active even during war times. Referring to the global peace system, Shifferd states that most of what needs to be invented to end war has been invented.&lt;ref&gt;Shifferd 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Rob Ricigliano in 2012 stated that "while...difficult to ascribe specific causation to any one group, the positive trends … indicate that the international community, practitioners, and academics have learned important lessons about ending wars and building peace.”&lt;ref&gt;Ricigliano 2012, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 2013, Douglas Fry noted that the creation of a global peace system involves synergistic elements such as a transformative vision that a peace-based global system is possible, the understanding of [[interdependence]] and [[cooperation]], an added level of [[Social identity theory|social identity]] including all human beings, the creation of effective and democratic procedures of international adjudication, and peace-supporting symbols and values.&lt;ref&gt;Fry 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 2003, peace ethologist [[Judith Hand]] approached the subject of a paradigm shift to a global peace system from biological, behavioral, anthropological, and gender perspectives.&lt;ref name = "WBP"&gt;2003 ''Women, Power, and the Biology of Peace''. San Diego, CA : Questpath Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "TAW"&gt;2010 Hand, Judith L. "To Abolish War." ''Journal of Aggression, Conflict, and Peace Research'' 2(4): 44-56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "SHIFT"&gt;2014 ''Shift: The Beginning of War, The Ending of War''. San Diego, CA : Questpath Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = WSHD&gt;2018 ''War and Sex and Human Destiny''. San Diego, CA: Questpath Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;. Based on the biological principles of [[sexual dimorphism]] and [[parental investment]] theory and the political principle of [[gender parity]] in government (which she termed koinoniarchy) she argued that gender parity in governing is a necessary condition, not an option, for establishment and maintenance of a global peace system.&lt;ref&gt;Hand 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Grave robbery''', '''tomb robbing''', or '''tomb raiding''' is the act of uncovering a [[grave (burial)|grave]], [[tomb]] or [[crypt]] to steal matter. It is usually perpetrated to take and profit from valuable [[artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s or [[personal property|personal effects]].{{Refn|group=n|All three long-used terms bear their [[plain meaning rule|plain (natural) meaning]], specifically that robbing and raiding in this context mean stealing. In English, Welsh and Scottish law "to rob"/"robbery" is limited to an intentional fright or attack against a person so as to steal - i.e. some form of [[assault and battery (disambiguation)|assault or battery]]. In more common colloquial use the term "rob" is also used transitively with any type of place meaning to steal from. This means that, internationally, stealing of coffins/urns containing remains, components of these items or taking bodies from their proper, intended final resting place is also caught by the term}} A related act is [[body snatching]], a term denoting the contested or unlawful taking of a body (seldom from a grave), which can be extended to the unlawful taking of organs alone. These acts carry two [[social stigma|stigma]]s from the [[evolution of morality]]: [[selfishness]] and [[psychological trauma]] to which the [[behavioural immune system]] adds the stigma of [[disgust]] to those coming into contact with part-decayed, particularly human, bodies.

Grave robbing has caused great difficulty to the study of [[archaeology]], [[art history]], and [[history]].{{sfnp|Daniel|1950|p=11|ps=}}{{sfnp|Atwood|2004|p=9|ps=}} Countless precious grave sites and tombs have been robbed before scholars were able to examine them. In any way, the archaeological context and the historical and anthropological information are destroyed:

{{quote|Looting obliterates the memory of the ancient world and turns its highest artistic creations into decorations, adornments on a shelf, divorced from historical context and ultimately from all meaning.{{sfnp|Atwood|2004|p=10|ps=}}}}
Grave robbers who are not caught usually sell relatively modern items anonymously and artifacts on the [[black market]]. Those intercepted, in a public justice domain, are inclined to deny their guilt due to the three stigmas mentioned. Though some artifacts may make their way to museums or scholars, the majority end up in private collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.11141/ia.45.5 | issue=45 | title=The Insta-Dead: The rhetoric of the human remains trade on Instagram | year=2017 | journal=Internet Archaeology | last1 = Huffer | first1 = Damien | last2 = University | first2 = Stockholm | last3 = Graham | first3 = Shawn }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on archaeology around the world==

===China===
{{pull quote|Tomb raiding is already a full-fledged industry in China.|source='''Xie Zhensheng'''{{when|date=February 2018}}, honorary president, China Cultural Relics Society}}

Chinese [[jade burial suits]] were believed to be myths for many years until two were discovered in 1968; it is now believed that most jade burial suits were removed long ago by grave robbers.

Grave robbing is still problematic in 21st century China. The increase in technology, such as night vision goggles, air breathing equipment, and metal detectors allows grave robbers to better find and rob ancient gravesites. There are institutions in which you can learn how to rob graves– “for about 200 yuan (about $30) a day. Land surveying skills are first taught, before progressing to probes and shovels, then finally explosives. After 10 days, adepts have the chance to assist an instructor in a real tomb robbery”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fang|first1=Frank|last2=Ong|first2=Larry|title=China Fights Losing Battle Against Tomb Raiders|url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/1993683-china-fights-losing-battle-against-tomb-raiders/|publisher=Epoch Times|accessdate=6 August 2016|date=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical antiquity===

[[Ancient Egypt]]ian tombs are one of the most common examples of tomb or grave robbery. Most of the tombs in Egypt's [[Valley of the Kings]] were robbed within one hundred years of their sealing (including the tomb of the famous King [[Tutankhamen]], which was raided at least twice before it was discovered in 1922).{{sfnp|Gardiner|2007|p=147|ps=}} As most of the [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] in these ancient burial sites have been discovered, it is through the conditions of the tombs and presumed articles that are missing in which historians and archaeologists are able to determine whether the tomb has been robbed. Egyptian [[pharaohs]] often kept records of the precious items in their tombs, so an inventory check is presumed for archaeologists.{{sfnp|Gardiner|2007|p=244|ps=}} Oftentimes, warnings would be left by the Pharaohs in the tombs of calamities and curses that would be laid upon any who touched the treasure, or the bodies, which did little to deter grave robbers. There are many examples of grave robbing in the Ancient World outside of Egypt.&lt;ref name="NG 6-2016"&gt;{{cite magazine| last= Mueller| first = Tom| date = June 2016| title= How Tomb Raiders Are Stealing Our History| url  = https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2016/06/looting-ancient-blood-antiquities/| magazine   = National Geographic}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Romans ([[Byzantium]]) also suffered decades of theft and destruction of tombs, crypts, and graves.{{sfnp|Shelton|1998|p=95|ps=}}

=== Europe ===
In Europe, graves are robbed on an accelerating and alarming scale. Many grave robbers works with metal detectors and some of the groups are [[organised crime|organised criminals]], feeding the black market with highly prized archaeological artifacts.&lt;ref name=Spiegel&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/archaeology-in-crisis-bulgaria-plagued-by-grave-robbers-a-524976.html|title=Bulgaria Plagued by 'Grave Robbers'|author=Marion Kraske|publisher=Spiegel Online|date=21 December 2007|accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Merovingian]] graves in France and Germany and [[Anglo-Saxon]] graves in England contain many metal grave goods, mostly of iron. Grave robbers often leave them, being only interested in gold and silver. Grave contexts, ceramics, iron weapons and skeletons are destroyed.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In [[Eastern Europe]], including [[Southeast Europe]] and the European part of [[Russia]], grave robbers target all kinds of historically important graves, from pre-historic tombs to World War II graves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-latvia-nazi-memorabilia/|title=Rise of the Nazi-Grave Robbers|publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek|date= 23 August 2016|accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.express.co.uk/expressyourself/344760/Grave-robbing-ghouls-who-trade-in-Nazi-relics|title=Grave robbing ghouls who trade in Nazi relics|publisher=Sunday Express|date=8 September 2012|accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Spiegel/&gt;

===North America===
Modern grave robbing in North America also involves long-abandoned or forgotten private [[Antebellum Period]] to pre-[[Great Depression]] era grave sites. These sites are often desecrated by grave robbers in search of old, hence valuable, jewelry. Affected sites are typically in rural, forested areas where once-prominent, wealthy landowners and their families were interred. The remote and often undocumented locations of defunct private cemeteries make them particularly susceptible to grave robbery. The practice may be encouraged by default upon the discovery of a previously unknown family cemetery by a new landowner.

One historical incident occurred during the evening of November 7, 1876, when a group of counterfeiters tried to abscond with [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s mortal remains from his grave in [[Springfield, Illinois]], in order to secure the release of their imprisoned leader, counterfeit engraver Benjamin Boyd. However, a secret service agent was present and had notified the police beforehand, so the attempted grave robbers only succeeded in the dislodgment of the lid of his coffin. As a consequence, when reburied, additional security measures prevented further depredations against Lincoln's body {{sfnp|Craughwell|2007|p=|ps=}}&lt;ref&gt;Keith Verinese: "The Adventures of Abraham Lincoln's Corpse:" http://io9.com/S898746/the-adventures-of-abraham-lincolns-corpse{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central America===
Grave robbers often sold stolen [[Aztec]] or [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] goods on the [[black market]] for an extremely high price. The buyers (museum curators, historians, etc.) did not often suffer the repercussions of being in possession of stolen goods and that the blame (and charges) are put upon the lower-class grave robbers. Today's [[antiquities trade]] has become a streamlining industry&amp;nbsp;– and the speed these artifacts enter the market has grown exponentially. Laws have been enacted in these regions, but due to extreme poverty, these grave robbings continue to grow each year.

==Race==

===African Americans===
[[Image:Leonard Medical School graduating class of 1889.JPG|thumb|Leonard Medical School Graduating Class of 1889]]
{{pull quote|Enslaved and free African Americans, immigrants, and the poor were frequently the target of grave robbing.|source='''Edward C. Halperin'''}}

African Americans would often bury their dead in a [[potter's field]]; not having the access or money for a proper funeral. When buried in potter’s fields, the dead were not normally buried very deep. A grave robber could just wait in the distance until everyone left and dig up the body from its shallow grave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of African-American Cemeteries|url=http://www.sciway.net/hist/chicora/gravematters-1.html|website=www.sciway.net|accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the railroad was invented and tracks laid—the sale of African American slaves from the South for dissection began; being sent to medical schools in the northern part of the United States. One Professor of Anatomy in New England reported that, in the 1880s and 1890s, he entered into an arrangement in which he received, twice each semester, a shipment of 12 bodies of southern African Americans. “They came in barrels labeled turpentine and were shipped to a local hardware store that dealt in painting materials”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waite|first1=Frederick C.|title=Grave robbing in New England|date=1945|publisher=Public Library of Fort Wayne and Allen County|accessdate=31 July 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Emancipation Act]], African American Union soldiers that died while serving in the military were dissected by white military surgeons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Savitt|first1=Todd L.|title=Slave Life Insurance in Virginia and North Carolina|journal=The Journal of Southern History|date=November 1977|volume=43|issue=4|pages=583|doi=10.2307/2207007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

State laws in Mississippi and North Carolina were passed in the 19th century which allowed medical schools to use the remains of those at the bottom of society’s hierarchy—the unclaimed bodies of poor persons, residents of alms houses, and those buried in potter’s fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richardson|first1=Ruth|title=Death, Dissection and the Destitute|date=2000|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=9780226712406|edition=2 ed. with a new afterword.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Humphrey|first1=DC|title=Dissection and Discrimination: the Social Origins of Cadavers in America, 1760-1915.|journal=Bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine|date=September 1973|volume=49|issue=9|pages=819–27|pmid=4582559|pmc=1807060}}&lt;/ref&gt; The option to dissect Confederate soldiers was also not available, being that Mississippi and North Carolina legally released the bodies to the families. The North Carolina law also provided that the body of whites never be sent to an African American medical college (such as the Leonard Medical School). These African American Medical schools typically obtained unclaimed Black ‘‘potter’s field bodies’’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moore|first1=Wendy|title=The Knife Man : Blood, Body Snatching, and the Birth of Modern Surgery|date=2005|publisher=Broadway Books|location=New York|isbn=0767916530|edition=1st pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deterrents ==

=== Geography ===
[[File:Mount Auburn Cemetery terrain.jpg|thumb|Examples of the terrain within [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]]]]
The geography and placement of burial grounds became a deterrent within itself. This is because without the accessibility of the automobile (in the early 19th century), the transportation of bodies was difficult.

A perfect example of this is Mount Auburn Cemetery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mount Auburn Cemetery|url=http://mountauburn.org/|website=mountauburn.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Cambridge Massachusetts. It was the first [[rural cemetery]] inside the United States. The rural location of the cemetery created transportation issues. In addition, the terrain of and around the cemetery was formidable. Further, [[Henry Alexander Scammell Dearborn]], the designer wanted to leave the natural terrain (including ponds and hills) within the cemetery. If someone wanted to rob a grave they would have to maneuver around these obstacles for over large stretches of land, while in the dark. Note that [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]] is over 175 acres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mount Auburn Cemetery--Massachusetts Conservation: A Discover Our Shared Heritage Travel Itinerary|url=https://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/massachusetts_conservation/mount_auburn.html|website=www.nps.gov|accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cemeteries, of the time, that were originally built away from populated areas for similar reasons, include: [[Mount Hope Cemetery (Bangor, Maine)|Mount Hope Cemetery]] in Bangor, Maine (1834); [[Laurel Hill Cemetery]] in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (1836); [[Mount Pleasant Cemetery (Taunton, Massachusetts)|Mount Pleasant Cemetery]] in Taunton, Massachusetts (1836); [[Mount Hope Cemetery (Rochester)|Mount Hope Cemetery]] in Rochester, New York (1838); [[Green-Wood Cemetery]] in Brooklyn, New York (1838); and, [[Green Mount Cemetery]] in Baltimore, Maryland (1838).

===Mortsafes===
[[Image:Mortsafe at Logeriat Church1.jpg|thumb|Mortsafes at Logeriat Church in [[Perthshire, Scotland]]]]
A [[mortsafe]] or mort safe was an iron coffin or framework which helped to protect a grave by preventing the body from being dug up and taken away. Mortsafes were specific for the task of preventing bodies from being stolen for purposes of medical dissections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lennox|first1=Suzie|title=Bodysnatchers: Digging Up The Untold Stories of Britain's Resurrection Men|publisher=Pen and Sword History|location=Barnsley, South Yorkshire|isbn=9781473866577|page=39,65}}&lt;/ref&gt; These deterrents, used commonly in Scotland, would be only available for the rich to protect their loved ones, since iron was so expensive. After the body would decompose to a certain extent, the Mortsafe would be removed. These were not a commodity that were sold and bought; rather, they were rented.

===Mort houses===
[[Image:Udny Mort House 02.JPG|thumb|[[Udny Mort House]] in Aberdeenshire, north-east Scotland]]

A mort house or [[dead house]] was used to store bodies until decomposed enough to no longer be targets for grave robbing. Up to 31 recorded mort houses were scattered throughout Scotland and northern England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gorman|first1=Martyn|title=Map Showing the Distribution of Morthouses in Scottish Graveyards|url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/bodysnatchers/morthouses.php|website=www.abdn.ac.uk|publisher=University of Aberdeen|accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually these structures were built within or near cemeteries to make transportation easier. Prior to grave robbers, they were used to store dead bodies in the winter, being that the ground was too cold and in some cases impossible to dig into. An example is the [[Udny Mort House]] built in 1832, Aberdeenshire, north-east Scotland and still standing today.

===Coffin collars===
The coffin collar was an iron collar often fixed to a piece of wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Museums of Scotland - Coffin Collar|url=http://nms.scran.ac.uk/database/record.php?usi=000-190-000-830-C|website=nms.scran.ac.uk|accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was fixed around the neck of a corpse and then bolted to the bottom of a coffin. Most common reports of these collars being used came from Scotland around the 1820s.

===Family mausoleums===
[[Image:Freeland Grave.png|thumb|The Freeland Mausoleum at [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]] in Cambridge, Massachusetts]]
Historically [[mausoleums]] have been used as a sign of a family’s wealth and a symbol of gentry and nobility in many countries. In the mid and late 19th century in North America, more and more families began to buy mausoleums. The belief was that it would be easier for a Resurrectionist or grave robber to dig up a grave rather than to topple down iron or steel doors guarding the mausoleum. A flaw in the design of the mausoleum was the stained glass or other windows within. Almost every family between the 18th and 19th century had a religious affiliation. As such, many of these families (usually with a Christian affiliation) would put stained glass within the mausoleums. The grave robbers would then just have to smash the glass to break in and to retrieve the body. Making it even easier, around the 1830s families began to fear burying family members. The living relatives would stand guard inside the mausoleum and would sometimes get trapped—only to be discovered upon the death of the next family member [citation needed]. To remedy this, families would put a spare key somewhere within the mausoleum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mausoleum Locks (19th &amp; 20th century)|url=http://www.lockpicking101.com/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=57149|accessdate=30 July 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150326223519/http://www.lockpicking101.com/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=57149|archivedate=26 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and create doors with two way locks. In short, grave robbers could break a window, recover the body, find the key, and walk straight out the front door of the mausoleum.

===Guards/guarding===
One of the most simplistic and low-tech methods to prevent grave robbing were to have an individual guard over the newly buried body. This was done until decomposition of the body was brought to a point where they would no longer be desirable for medical use. If families did not have enough money to hire an individual to watch over the grave for a select number of days, the family would delegate this duty amongst them and close friends.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3764">'''Hydrogen pinch''' analysis (HPA) is a [[hydrogen]] management method that originates from the concept of heat [[pinch analysis]]. HPA is a systematic technique for reducing hydrogen consumption and hydrogen generation through integration of hydrogen-using activities or processes in the [[petrochemical industry]], [[petroleum refineries]] hydrogen distribution networks and hydrogen purification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aspentech.com/publication_files/PTQ_Spring_2003_Hydrogen_Optimization.pdf Hydrogen optimization at minimal investment]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principle==
A mass analysis is done by representing the purity and flowrate for each stream from the hydrogen consumers (sinks), such as [[hydrotreater]]s, [[hydrocracker]]s, [[isomerization]] units and [[lubricant]] plants and the hydrogen producers (sources), such as hydrogen plants and [[naphtha]] reformers, streams from [[hydrogen purifier]]s, [[membrane reactor]]s, [[pressure swing adsorption]] and [[continuous distillation]] and off-gas streams from low- or high-pressure separators. The source-demand diagram shows bottlenecks, surplus or shortages. The hydrogen pinch is the purity at which the hydrogen network has neither hydrogen surplus nor deficit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfe.admin.ch/php/modules/publikationen/stream.php?extlang=en&amp;name=en_23130289.pdf Pinch Analysis-]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfe.admin.ch/php/modules/publikationen/stream.php?extlang=en&amp;name=en_23130289.pdf Pinch Analysis-]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the analysis REFOPT from the Centre for Process Integration at [[The University of Manchester]] is used as a tool for process integration with which the process is optimized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceas.manchester.ac.uk/research/centres/centreforprocessintegration/software/packages/refopt/ REFOPT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225122544/http://www.ceas.manchester.ac.uk/research/centres/centreforprocessintegration/software/packages/refopt/ |date=2008-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The methodology was also developed into commercial software by companies such as [[Bodo Linnhoff#Linnhoff March Ltd|Linnhoff March]] and [[Aspen Technology|AspenTech]]. The Aspen product incorporated the work of Nick Hallale (formerly a lecturer at University of Manchester) and was the first method to consider multiple components, rather than a pseudo-binary mixture of hydrogen and methane.

==History==
The first assessment based on cost and value composite curves of hydrogen resources of a hydrogen network was proposed by Tower et al. (1996). Alves  developed the hydrogen pinch analysis approach based on the concept of heat [[pinch analysis]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aidic.it/pres09/webpapers/203Ahmad.pdf Multi-period hydrogen management] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722023424/http://www.aidic.it/pres09/webpapers/203Ahmad.pdf |date=2011-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nick Hallale and Fang Liu extended this original work, adding pressure constraints and mathematical programming for optimisation. This was followed by developments at AspenTech, producing commercial software for industrial application.

[[File:Unstable3.svg|thumb|A ball on the top of a hill is an unstable situation.]]
In numerous fields of study, the component of '''instability''' within a [[system]] is generally characterized by some of the outputs or internal [[state (controls)|states]] growing without [[bound state|bounds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/instability|title=Definition of INSTABILITY|author=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Not all systems that are not [[Stability theory|stable]] are unstable; systems can also be [[marginal stability|marginally stable]] or exhibit [[limit cycle]] behavior.

In [[structural engineering]], a structure can become unstable when excessive load is applied. Beyond a certain threshold, structural [[Deflection (engineering)|deflection]]s magnify [[stress (physics)|stresses]], which in turn increases deflections. This can take the form of [[buckling]] or crippling. The general field of study is called [[structural stability]].

[[Atmospheric instability]] is a major component of all [[weather system]]s on Earth.

==Instability in control systems==
{{See also|Stabilizability}}

In the theory of [[dynamical systems]], a [[state variable]] in a system is said to be unstable if it evolves without bounds. A system itself is said to be unstable if at least one of its state variables is unstable.

In [[continuous time]] [[control theory]], a system is unstable if any of the [[Root of a function|roots]] of its [[Characteristic equation (calculus)|characteristic equation]] has [[real part]] greater than zero (or if zero is a repeated root).  This is equivalent to any of the [[eigenvalues]] of the [[State space (controls)|state matrix]] having either real part greater than zero, or, for the eigenvalues on the imaginary axis, the algebraic multiplicity being larger than the geometric multiplicity.{{clarification needed|reason=what is the difference between these two types of multiplicity?|date=September 2015}} The equivalent condition in [[discrete time]] is that at least one of the eigenvalues is greater than 1 in absolute value, or that two or more eigenvalues are equal and of unit absolute value.

==Fluid instabilities==

[[Fluid]] instabilities occur in [[liquids]], [[gases]] and [[Plasma physics|plasmas]], and are often characterized by the shape that form; they are studied in [[fluid dynamics]] and [[magnetohydrodynamics]]. Fluid instabilities include:

* Ballooning mode instability (some analogy to the Rayleigh–Taylor instability); found in the [[magnetosphere]]
* [[Atmospheric instability]]
** [[Hydrodynamic instability]] or [[dynamic instability]] ([[atmospheric dynamics]])
*** [[Inertial instability]]; [[baroclinic instability]]; [[symmetric instability]], [[conditional symmetric instability|conditional symmetric]] or [[conditional symmetric instability|convective symmetric instability]]; [[barotropic instability]]; [[Helmholtz instability|Helmholtz]] or [[Helmholtz instability|shearing instability]]; [[rotational instability]]

* [[Richtmyer-Meshkov instability]] (similar to the Rayleigh–Taylor instability)
* [[shock wave|Shock Wave]] Instability
* [[Modulational instability|Benjamin-Feir Instability]] (also known as modulational instability)

==Plasma instabilities==
{{Main|Plasma stability#Plasma instabilities}}
[[Plasma (physics)|Plasma]] instabilities can be divided into two general groups (1) hydrodynamic instabilities (2) kinetic instabilities. Plasma instabilities are also categorised into different modes&amp;nbsp;– see [[Plasma stability#Plasma instabilities|this paragraph in plasma stability]].

==Instabilities of stellar systems==

[[Galaxies]] and [[star cluster]]s can be unstable, if small perturbations in the [[gravitational potential]] cause changes in the density that reinforce the original perturbation.  Such instabilities usually require that the motions of stars be highly correlated, so that the perturbation is not "smeared out" by random motions. After the instability has run its course, the system is typically "hotter" (the motions are more random) or rounder than before. Instabilities in stellar systems include:

* [[Bar instability]] of rapidly rotating disks
* [[Jeans instability]]
* [[Firehose instability]]&lt;ref name="MS94"&gt;{{citation

==Joint instabilities==
The most common residual disability after any sprain in the body is instability.  Mechanical instability includes insufficient stabilizing structures and mobility that exceed the physiological limits.  Functional instability involves recurrent sprains or a feeling of giving way of the injured joint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Guskiewicz |first=K. M. |first2=David H. |last2=Perrin |title=Effect of Orthotics on Postural Sway Following Inversion Ankle Sprain |journal=Journal of Orthopedic and Sports Physical Therapy |volume=23 |issue=5 |pages=326–331  |date=1996 |doi=10.2519/jospt.1996.23.5.326 |pmid=8728531 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=15 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Injuries cause [[proprioceptive]] deficits and impaired postural control in the joint.  Individuals with muscular weakness, occult instability, and decreased postural control are more susceptible to injury than those with better postural control.  Instability leads to an increase in postural sway, the measurement of the time and distance a subject spends away from an ideal [[Center of pressure (terrestrial locomotion)|center of pressure]].  The measurement of a subject’s postural sway can be calculated through testing center of pressure (CoP), which is defined as the vertical projection of center of mass on the ground.  Investigators have theorized that if injuries to joints cause [[deafferentation]], the interruption of sensory nerve fibers, and functional instability, then a subject’s postural sway should be altered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=A. |last=Pintsaar |last2=Brynhildsen |first2=J. |first3=H. |last3=Tropp |title=Postural Corrections after Standardised Perturbations of Single Limb Stance: Effect of Training and Orthotic Devices in Patients with Ankle Instability |journal=[[British Journal of Sports Medicine]] |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=151–155 |date=1996 |doi=10.1136/bjsm.30.2.151 |pmid=8799602 |pmc=1332381 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=15 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Joint stability can be enhanced by the use of an external support system, like a brace, to alter body mechanics.  The mechanical support provided by a brace provides cutaneous afferent feedback in maintaining postural control and increasing stability.

'''Intention''' is a [[mind|mental]] state that represents a commitment to carrying out an action or actions in the [[future]]. Intention involves mental activities such as [[planning]] and forethought.&lt;ref name="Bratman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bratman|first1=M.|title=Intention, Plans, and Practical Reason|date=1987|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
[[Folk psychology]] explains human behavior on the basis of mental states, including [[beliefs]], [[desires]], and intentions.&lt;ref name="Astington"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Astington|first1=J.W.|title=The child's discovery of the mind|date=1993|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Perner|first1=J.|title=Understanding the representational mind|date=1991|publisher=Bradford Books/MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mental mechanisms, including intention, explain behavior in that individuals are seen as actors who have desires and who attempt to achieve [[goal]]s that are directed by beliefs.&lt;ref name="Malle and Knobe"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Malle|first1=Bertram F.|last2=Knobe|first2=Joshua|title=The Folk Concept of Intentionality|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|date=March 1997|volume=33|issue=2|pages=101–121|doi=10.1006/jesp.1996.1314}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, an intentional action is a function to accomplish a desired goal and is based on the belief that the course of action will satisfy a desire.&lt;ref name="Malle and Knobe" /&gt;

There is also a theoretical distinction between intentionality (intentional actions), and a mental state of intention for the future.&lt;ref name="Searle"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Searle|first1=J.R.|title=Intentionality: An essay in the philosophy of mind|date=1983|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England}}&lt;/ref&gt; Searle (1983) labeled these as intention-in-action and prior intention respectively. Prior intentions reflect forethought about intentions-in-action; prior intentions do not need to be carried out to be considered intentions.&lt;ref name="Searle" /&gt; An unfulfilled intention is a prior intention that has no action associated with it.&lt;ref name="Searle" /&gt;

Astington (1993)&lt;ref name="Astington" /&gt; outlined the connections between mental states (desires, beliefs, and intentions) and actions carried out by an individual in order to reach a goal; these connections are referred to as the Intentional Chain.  The proposed connective chain is that desire causes intention, which causes action, which causes outcome.  The Intentional Chain maps the linking of a desire to the satisfaction of a goal via the intermediary intention.&lt;ref name="Astington" /&gt;

==The development of an understanding of intention==
Psychological research suggests that understanding intentions of others may be a prerequisite for a higher-level understanding of other people's minds or [[theory of mind]].&lt;ref name="Blakemore and Decety"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blakemore|first1=SJ|last2=Decety|first2=J|title=From the perception of action to the understanding of intention.|journal=Nature Reviews. Neuroscience|date=August 2001|volume=2|issue=8|pages=561–7|pmid=11483999|doi=10.1038/35086023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theory of mind research attempts to map how children come to understand the mind as a representational device for the world.&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=E.A.|title=Young children's representational understanding of intention|journal=Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering|date=1996|volume=56|issue=12-B|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/618996982?accountid=14512}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research has focused on the development of knowledge that others have beliefs, desires, and intentions that are different from one's own.  A basic ability to comprehend other people's intentions based on their actions is critical to the development of theory of mind.&lt;ref name="Blakemore and Decety" /&gt;

Understanding intention is thought to be pivotal in understanding social contexts in numerous ways. First, acquiring an understanding of intention is important for development in that it helps children conceptualize how people and animals differ from objects. Much of behavior is caused by intentions, and understanding intentions helps to interpret these behaviors.&lt;ref name=Feinfield&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Feinfield|first1=Kristin A|last2=Lee|first2=Patti P|last3=Flavell|first3=Eleanor R|last4=Green|first4=Frances L|last5=Flavell|first5=John H|title=Young Children's Understanding of Intention|journal=Cognitive Development|date=July 1999|volume=14|issue=3|pages=463–486|doi=10.1016/S0885-2014(99)00015-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, intentions are integral to an understanding of morality.&lt;ref name=Shantz&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shantz|first1=C.U.|editor1-last=Mussen|editor1-first=P.H.|editor2-last=Flavell|editor2-first=J.H.|editor3-last=Markman|editor3-first=E.M.|title=Handbook of child psychology: Volume III. Cognitive Development|date=1983|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|pages=495–555|edition=4th|chapter=Social cognition}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children learn to assign praise or blame based on whether actions of others are intentional. Intention is also necessary to understand and predict the plans and future actions of others.&lt;ref name="Bratman" /&gt; Understanding the intentions and motives of others aids in the interpretation of communication,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bloom|first1=P.|title=How children learn the meanings of words|date=2000|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tomasello, M.|editor1-last=Zelazo|editor1-first=P.D.|editor2-last=Astington|editor2-first=J.W.|editor3-last=Olson|editor3-first=D.R.|title=Developing theories of intention: Social understanding and self-control.|date=1999|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Publishers|location=Mahwah, NJ|pages=63–75|chapter=Having intentions, understanding intentions, and understanding communicative intentions}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the achievement of cooperative goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jenkins, J.|author2=Greenbuam, R.|editor1-last=Zelazo|editor1-first=P.D.|editor2-last=Astington|editor2-first=J.W.|editor3-last=Olson|editor3-first=D.R.|title=Developing theories of intention: Social understanding and self-control|date=1991|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Publishers|location=Mahwah, NJ|pages=269–291|chapter=Intention and emotion in child psychopathology: Building cooperative plans}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social, cognitive and developmental psychological research has focused on the question: How do young children develop the ability to understand other people's behaviors and intentions?

=== Intentional acts in infancy and childhood ===
From an early age, typically-developing children parse human actions in terms of goals, rather than in terms of movements in space, or muscle movements.&lt;ref name="Malle"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Meltzoff, A.N.|author2=Brooks, R.|editor1-last=Malle|editor1-first=B.F.|editor2-last=Moses|editor2-first=L.J.|editor3-last=Baldwin|editor3-first=D.A.|title=Intentions and intentionality: Foundations of social cognition|date=2001|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=171–191|chapter="Like me" as a building block for understanding other minds: Bodily acts, attention, and intention}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meltzoff (1995)&lt;ref name=Meltzoff&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meltzoff|first1=A.N.|title=Understanding the intentions of others: Re-enactment of intended acts by 18-month-old children|journal=Developmental Moisture
|date=1995|volume=31|issue=5|pages=838–850|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.31.5.838|pmid=25147406|pmc=4137788}}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted a study in which 18-month-olds were shown an unsuccessful act. For instance, children watched an adult accidentally under or over shoot a target, or attempt to perform an action but his hand slipped. The aim of the study was to determine whether the children were able to interpret the intention of the adult, regardless of the actual action performed.  Young children have a tendency to imitate other people's actions. The outcome measure was what the child chose to re-enact—the actual event (literal motions), or the adult's goal, which was not accomplished.&lt;ref name="Meltzoff" /&gt;  The results of the study suggested that 18-month-olds are able to infer unseen goals and intentions of others based on their actions. Infants who saw unsuccessful attempts at a target act and infants who saw the target act imitated the act at a higher rate than infants who saw neither the act nor an attempt.&lt;ref name="Meltzoff" /&gt;  Similar paradigms were conducted with children 9 months old and 15 months old.  Nine-month-olds did not respond to the unsuccessful attempt demonstrations; however, 15-month-olds acted similarly to the 18-month-olds. This suggests that between 9 months and 15 months of age the ability to infer intentions in other people develops.&lt;ref name="Malle" /&gt;

The development of understanding intention has also been studied in toddlers. As mentioned previously, an intentional action is based on the belief that the course of action will satisfy a desire.&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt; In that case, what was intended can be interpreted as a function of an understanding for what was desired. When outcomes are achieved without the action of the individual directed at the goal, intention is not attributed to the actor; rather, the event is considered an accident.&lt;ref name="Searle" /&gt;  Research by Astington and colleagues (1993)&lt;ref name="Astington" /&gt; found that 3-year-olds are skilled at matching goals to outcomes to infer intention. If another individual's goals match an outcome, 3-year-olds are able to conclude that the action was done “on purpose.” Conversely, when goals do not match outcomes, the children labeled the individual's actions as accidental.&lt;ref name="Astington" /&gt; Children may come to distinguish between desire and intention when they learn to view the mind as a medium for representations of the world.&lt;ref name="AstingtonII"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Astington|first1=J.W.|editor1-last=Malle|editor1-first=B.F.|editor2-last=Moses|editor2-first=L.J.|editor3-last=Baldwin|editor3-first=D.A.|title=Intentions and Intentionality: Foundations of social cognition|date=2001|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=85–103|chapter=The paradox of intention: Assessing children's metarepresentational understanding}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astington argues that initially desire is undifferentiated from intention in that both function as a goal state. Children then develop a more mature command of understanding other's intentions when they are able to represent an action as caused by a prior intention that is separate from desire.&lt;ref name="AstingtonII" /&gt;

Thus, research suggests that by the age of fifteen months, humans are capable of understanding intentional acts in others.&lt;ref name="Malle" /&gt; The ability to distinguish between intention and desire develops in early childhood. Gestures and object-directed actions have also been studied in connexion with the development of the understanding of intention. The development of the ability to use gestures and object-directed actions in social situations has been studied from numerous perspectives, including the embodiment perspective and the social-cognitive perspective.

===Gestures and object-directed intentions===
Gestures are often recognized as a tool indicative of higher social reasoning. In order to engage in or understand a gesture, an individual has to recognize it as an indicator of an object or event separate from the self or the actor. It is thought that pointing, especially declarative pointing (i.e. pointing intended to direct and share intention rather than request an object), reveals the understanding of others as attentional and intentional agents (e.g. Liszkowski, Carpenter, &amp; Tomasello, 2007&lt;ref name=Liszkowski&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liszkowski|first1=Ulf|last2=Carpenter|first2=Malinda|last3=Tomasello|first3=Michael|title=Pointing out new news, old news, and absent referents at 12 months of age|journal=Developmental Science|date=March 2007|volume=10|issue=2|pages=F1–F7|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2006.00552.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;). This understanding is indicated by object-directed reactions to pointing (rather than focusing on the hand).&lt;ref name="Woodward and G"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Woodward|first1=Amanda L.|last2=Guajardo|first2=Jose J.|title=Infants’ understanding of the point gesture as an object-directed action|journal=Cognitive Development|date=January 2002|volume=17|issue=1|pages=1061–1084|doi=10.1016/S0885-2014(02)00074-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pointing is also thought to denote perspective-taking ability and understanding of intention, as the individual must be able to understand that the actor is attending to the object and, perhaps most importantly, that the actor is attempting to communicate information regarding the referent.&lt;ref name="Woodward and G" /&gt; The development of pointing is thought to reach a critical stage at around 9 to 12 months in normally developing children (e.g. Leung &amp; Rheingold, 1981; Moll &amp; Tomasello, 2007; Schaffer, 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leung|first1=Eleanor H.|last2=Rheingold|first2=Harriet L.|title=Development of pointing as a social gesture.|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=1981|volume=17|issue=2|pages=215–220|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.17.2.215}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moll and T"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Moll, H.|author2=Tomasello, M.|editor1-last=Emery|editor1-first=N.|editor2-last=Clayton|editor2-first=N.|editor3-last=Frith|editor3-first=C|title=Social intelligence:  From brain to culture|date=2007|pages=245–260|chapter=Cooperation and human cognition: the Vygotskian intelligence hypothesis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schaffer|first1=H.R.|title=The child's entry into a social world|date=2005|publisher=Academic Press|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Liszkowski and colleagues (2004)&lt;ref name="LiszkowskiII"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liszkowski|first1=Ulf|last2=Carpenter|first2=Malinda|last3=Henning|first3=Anne|last4=Striano|first4=Tricia|last5=Tomasello|first5=Michael|title=Twelve-month-olds point to share attention and interest|journal=Developmental Science|date=2004|volume=7|issue=3|pages=297–307|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2004.00349.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that human children begin to point at around one year of age and do so with a multiple motives, including sharing attention and interest.&lt;ref name="LiszkowskiII" /&gt; Earlier pointing may be different in nature and is thought to develop from a learned association between reaching and adult responsiveness to the child's desire for a referent object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bates|first1=E.|last2=Benigni|first2=L.|last3=Bretherton|first3=I.|last4=Camaioni|first4=L.|last5=Volterra|first5=V.|title=The emergence of symbols: Cognition and communication in infancy|date=1979|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, it seems pointing may be more complex than a straightforward indicator of social understanding. Early pointing may not indicate an understanding of intention; rather it may indicate an association between the gesture and interesting objects or events.&lt;ref name="Barresi and M"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barresi|first1=John|last2=Moore|first2=Chris|title=Intentional relations and social understanding|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=2010|volume=19|issue=01|pages=107–154|doi=10.1017/S0140525X00041790}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Butterworth|first1=George| author-link1=George Butterworth (psychologist)|last2=Jarrett|first2=Nicholas|title=What minds have in common is space: Spatial mechanisms serving joint visual attention in infancy|journal=British Journal of Developmental Psychology|date=1991|volume=9|issue=1|pages=55–72|doi=10.1111/j.2044-835X.1991.tb00862.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;{{cite book|author1=Moore, C.|editor1-last=Zelazo|editor1-first=P.D.|editor2-last=Astington|editor2-first=J.W.|editor3-last=Olson|editor3-first=D.R.|title=Developing theories of intention|date=1999|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an understanding of intention may develop as the child develops a theory of mind and begins to use pointing to convey meaning about referents in the world.

=== Embodiment perspective ===

The [[embodied cognition|embodiment]] hypothesis holds that cognition arises out of an individual's physical interactions with the environment.  In this way, environment and behavior are an integral part of cognition and what psychologists conceive of as ‘mental representations’ are indistinguishable from perception and action (e.g. Smith, 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Linda B.|title=Cognition as a dynamic system: Principles from embodiment|journal=Developmental Review|date=2005|volume=25|issue=3–4|pages=278–298|doi=10.1016/j.dr.2005.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The ontogenetic development of social cognition may be thought of as intertwined with the development pointing actions. According to this perspective, gestures are not just indicators of development but play a key role in how children come to develop advanced social cognition, including understanding of object-directed relations and human intention. In particular, engaging in physical actions oneself may provide insight into the structure of another's actions (eventually leading to a more nuanced understanding of another's mind).&lt;ref name="Meltzoff" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barresi and M" /&gt;

One method of determining developmental relations between actions and an understanding of social nuances behind actions is to assess correlations between infants’ reactions to actions and the frequency with which infants produce actions.&lt;ref name="Gerson and W"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gerson, S.|author2=Woodward, A.|editor1-last=Johnson|editor1-first=S.P.|title=Neoconstructivism: The New Science of Cognitive Development|date=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199864072|chapter=Building Intentional Action Knowledge with One’s Hands}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children are generally able to produce actions around the same time they are considered to be capable of understanding the actions in others.  For instance, Woodward and Guajardo (2002)&lt;ref name="Woodward and G" /&gt; found a correlation between children's ability to produce points (either during the experience or based on parental report of pointing at home) and their understanding of object-directed pointing (as evidenced by a preference for looking at a new object rather than a new hand path in a habituation paradigm) by 12 months. In addition, Brune and Woodward (2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brune|first1=C.W.|last2=Woodward|first2=A.L.|title=Social cognition and social responsiveness in 10-month-old infants|journal=Journal of Cognition and Development|date=2007|volume=8|issue=2|pages=133–158|doi=10.1080/15248370701202331}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that infants who produce object-directed points tended to have an understanding of pointing and infants who engaged in shared attention tended to have an understanding of eye gaze.  Although the findings are correlational, they support the idea that actions may facilitate cognitive understanding. It is unclear whether self-produced pointing gestures causally influence an understanding of pointing as relational; however, there is experimental evidence which suggests that infants supported in a new action skill will subsequently develop an understanding of that action.&lt;ref name="Gerson and W" /&gt; For instance, infants allowed to grasp objects with Velcro mittens gained an understanding of object-directed grasping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sommerville|first1=Jessica A.|last2=Woodward|first2=Amanda L.|last3=Needham|first3=Amy|title=Action experience alters 3-month-old infants' perception of others' actions|journal=Cognition|date=May 2005|volume=96|issue=1|pages=B1–B11|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2004.07.004|pmid=15833301|pmc=3908452}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social-cultural perspective ===

A social-cultural perspective includes the notion that not just actions, but partaking in social interactions and [[cooperation]] (both observing and acting) are key to both ontogenetic social development and responsible for larger cultural institutions, symbol systems, and other human social abilities (e.g. Moll &amp; Tomasello, 2007; Tomasello et al., 2005&lt;ref name="Moll and T" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tomasello2005&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tomasello|first1=Michael|last2=Carpenter|first2=Malinda|last3=Call|first3=Josep|last4=Behne|first4=Tanya|last5=Moll|first5=Henrike|title=Understanding and sharing intentions: The origins of cultural cognition|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=2005|volume=28|issue=05|doi=10.1017/S0140525X05000129|url=http://www.eva.mpg.de/psycho/staff/carpenter/pdf/Tomasello_et_al05sharing_intentions.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

This social-cultural perspective is derived from the Vygotskian view that higher cognitive functions originate in relations between individuals. The strict version of this view is that these functions are social actions that have been internalized.&lt;ref name=Vygotsky&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vygotsky|first1=L.S.|editor1-last=Cole|editor1-first=M.|editor2-last=John-Steiner|editor2-first=V.|editor3-last=Scribner|editor3-first=S.|display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=Souberman|editor4-first=E.|title=Mind in society: The development of higher psychological processes|date=1978|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Oxford, England|isbn=0674576284}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pointing, according to Vygotsky, starts out as an attempt to grab a desired object. Then, a transitional gesture develops in which the individual reaches toward the object when it is desired as a cue to another to retrieve it. This transitional gesture, says Vygotsky, is an important step toward language in that participation in these social interactions are internalized and become an understanding of the psychological functions of others. Thus, pointing is an example of the internalization process that occurs over a long series of developmental events. These gestures help children to gain an understanding of triadic interactions, as the gestures go from being simply about the objects to being specifically directed at people and conveying intention toward others.&lt;ref name="Vygotsky" /&gt;

Tomasello and colleagues proposed a social-cultural perspective for understanding human affinity for advanced social cognition (e.g. Moll &amp; Tomasello, 2007; Tomasello et al., 2005&lt;ref name="Moll and T" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tomasello2005" /&gt;). This view takes from Vygotsky's theory the idea that social interactions (such as pointing) are not just indicative of higher cognitive functions, such as understanding intention, but play an important role in shaping them. They argue that advanced cognitive abilities are derived from the tendency to cooperate and engage in collaborative activities (e.g. Moll &amp; Tomasello, 2007; Tomasello et al., 2005&lt;ref name="Moll and T" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tomasello2005" /&gt;).

It was originally suspected that such foundational cognitive skills leading to advanced social understanding lie in the human ability to understand another's intention. Humans seem to have an affinity for figuring out what others are perceiving, intending, desiring, believing, etc. For example, the use of symbols requires the ability to understand another's action and attention on an entity in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tomasello|first1=Michael|last2=Kruger|first2=Ann Cale|last3=Ratner|first3=Hilary Horn|title=Cultural learning|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=2010|volume=16|issue=03|pages=495|doi=10.1017/S0140525X0003123X}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, understanding intentions is unlikely to be a species-specific ability.&lt;ref name="Tomasello2005" /&gt;

Tomasello and colleagues argue that it is possible to break down the advanced understanding of shared [[intentionality]] into two developmental pathways that eventually become intertwined:

# The ability to understand others as goal-directed and intentional agents and
# A species-unique tendency to share emotions, events, and activities. Other species, such as great apes, understand the basics of intentionality; however, they do not exhibit behavior that suggests a willingness to engage in shared attention.&lt;ref name="Tomasello2005" /&gt;

This claim may be further investigated by examining the functional origins of pointing.  It is possible that the pointing exhibited by other species is different in purpose and origin from the pointing said to be indicative of a developing psychological understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cochet|first1=Hélène|last2=Vauclair|first2=Jacques|title=Pointing gestures produced by toddlers from 15 to 30 months: Different functions, hand shapes and laterality patterns|journal=Infant Behavior and Development|date=2010|volume=33|issue=4|pages=431–441|doi=10.1016/j.infbeh.2010.04.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former, referred to as imperative pointing, was originally described by Vygotsky (1978)&lt;ref name="Vygotsky" /&gt; as pointing which begins in an attempt to reach for a desired object. When another retrieves the desired object, the individual learns to associate the gesture (typically hand and all fingers extended outward) with a communicated intention to acquire the desired object. However, research suggests not all points develop in this way. A study by Bates, Camaioni and Volterra (1975)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bates|first1=E.|last2=Camaioni|first2=L.|last3=Volterra|first3=V.|title=The acquisition of performatives prior to speech|journal=Merrill-Palmer Quarterly|date=1975|volume=21|issue=3|pages=205–226}}&lt;/ref&gt; distinguished between imperative and declarative gestures. Imperative gestures were described as those directed at an adult in order to obtain an object, while declarative gestures were those simply intended to obtain adult attention. Both types of gestures are social in nature; however, declarative pointing is thought to be linked to more advanced social understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tomasello, M.|editor1-last=Moore|editor1-first=C.|editor2-last=Dunham|editor2-first=P.J.|title=Joint attention: Its origin and role in development|date=1995|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc|location=Hillsdale, N.J.|isbn=080581437X|pages=103–130|chapter=Joint attention as social cognition}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pika|first1=S.|title=Gestures of apes and pre-linguistic human children: Similar or different?|journal=First Language|date=2008|volume=28|issue=2|pages=116–140|doi=10.1177/0142723707080966}}&lt;/ref&gt; Declarative gestures may involve more complex social and cooperative skills, linked to the development of communication skills (e.g. Liszkowski et al., 2005&lt;ref name=Liszkowski2005&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liszkowski|first1=Ulf|title=Human twelve-month-olds point cooperatively to share interest with and helpfully provide information for a communicative partner|journal=Gesture|date=2005|volume=5|issue=1|pages=135–154|doi=10.1075/gest.5.1.11lis}}&lt;/ref&gt;). For instance, Camaioni and colleagues found that declarative pointing was related to an understanding of adult's intentions, while imperative gestures were not related.&lt;ref name=Camaioni2004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Camaioni|first1=L.|last2=Perucchini|first2=P.|last3=Bellagamba|first3=F.|last4=Colonnesi|first4=C.|title=The Role of Declarative Pointing in Developing a Theory of Mind|journal=Infancy|date=2004|volume=5|issue=3|pages=291–308|doi=10.1207/s15327078in0503_3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a social-cultural perspective, it is not the actions of pointing themselves, but the tendency to engage in cooperative actions (as indicated by elements such as shared intentionality and declarative pointing) that determines the advanced social-cognitive status of normally developing humans. These cooperative actions reveal an understanding of intention and may be for the sole purpose of interacting or cooperating rather than achieving an end. It may be that declarative pointing (typically exhibited by normally developing children but not children with autism), rather than imperative pointing, is indicative of the tendency to engage in the cooperative interactions believed to be important for developing advanced social-cognitive understanding. This fits in with Tomasello and colleagues’ conception that triadic social interactions in which child and adult engage in cooperative actions with shared intention are not only indicative of advanced social-cognitive ability but critical to the development of it.&lt;ref name="Moll and T" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tomasello2005" /&gt; During these interactions, children gradually begin to conceptualize both first- and third-person perspectives, gaining a “bird’s eye view” of social interactions.&lt;ref name="Moll and T" /&gt;  Both the embodiment and social cultural perspectives share the principle that gestures are not just indicators of development, but play an important role in how children come to understand object-directed relations and human intention.

==Gaze and attentional acts==
Research suggests that faces are pivotal in offering social cues necessary for children's cognitive, language, and social development. These cues may offer information on another's emotional state,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bassili|first1=J.N.|title=On-line Cognition in Person Perception|date=1989|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum|location=Hillsdale, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ekman|first1=P.|title=Emotion in the Human Face|date=1982|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; focus of attention,&lt;ref name=Langton&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Langton|first1=S.R.|title=The mutual influence of gaze and head orientation in the analysis of social attention direction.|journal=The Quarterly journal of experimental psychology.

Intention may be ascribed to an individual based on where in space that individual is attending. Intention is understood not only through actions and the manipulation of objects, but by tracking eye movements.&lt;ref name="Malle" /&gt; Research in this area is focused on how humans develop the understanding that eye gaze indicates that the observer may be psychologically connected to the referent.&lt;ref name="Malle" /&gt;

Even as infants, humans are able to follow the gaze of others. Further research has aimed to test whether infants are simply inclined to look in the direction of head movements, without any real understanding of another individual's psychological state.&lt;ref name="Malle" /&gt;  Brooks (1999) found that children do not direct attention simply toward the visual hemisphere of novel head movements; rather, children as young as 15 months attend to object-directed eye gaze, suggesting that children are attending to referents to which others attend, and are not simply gazing in a similar direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brooks|first1=R.|title=Infant understanding of seeing as a referential event|date=1991|publisher=UMI Dissertations Publishing|isbn=0599235667|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304492238?accountid=14512}}&lt;/ref&gt; These results support the idea that infants understand eye gaze as an indicator of another individual's psychological state, which is a basic component of understanding that others may have intentions separate from one's own.

==Biological motion and inferring intention==
Neuroimaging research suggests that biological motion is processed differently from other types of motion. Biological motion is processed as a category in which individuals are able to infer intention.&lt;ref name=Blakemore&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blakemore|first1=SJ|last2=Decety|first2=J|title=From the perception of action to the understanding of intention.|journal=Nature Reviews. Neuroscience|date=2001|volume=2|issue=8|pages=561–7|pmid=11483999|doi=10.1038/35086023}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An evolutionary perspective of this phenomenon is that humans survived on the basis of being able to predict the internal mental states and potential future actions of others. Research on biological motion has found cells in the primate superior temporal polysensory area (STP) that respond specifically to biological motion.&lt;ref name=Baizer&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baizer|first1=JS|last2=Ungerleider|first2=LG|last3=Desimone|first3=R|title=Organization of visual inputs to the inferior temporal and posterior parietal cortex in macaques.|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|date=1991|volume=11|issue=1|pages=168–90|pmid=1702462}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are brain regions, including the superior temporal sulcus, that respond to biological but not non-biological motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oram|first1=MW|last2=Perrett|first2=DI|title=Responses of Anterior Superior Temporal Polysensory (STPa) Neurons to "Biological Motion" Stimuli.|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|date=1994|volume=6|issue=2|pages=99–116|pmid=23962364|doi=10.1162/jocn.1994.6.2.99}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grossman|first1=ED|last2=Blake|first2=R|title=Brain Areas Active during Visual Perception of Biological Motion.|journal=Neuron|date=2002|volume=35|issue=6|pages=1167–75|pmid=12354405|doi=10.1016/s0896-6273(02)00897-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These findings suggest that humans may have a biologically-based affinity for spotting and interpreting purposeful, biological motions.

In one experiment, 18-month-olds observed either a human or a mechanical arm attempting to perform actions, but failing to achieve a goal.  The children imitated the action to complete the intended goal when the arm was human, but not when it was mechanical. This suggests that from a young age, humans are able to infer intention specifically as a biological mechanism between motions and goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meltzoff|first1=A. N.|title=Understanding the intentions of others: Re-enactment of intended acts by 18-month-old children.|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=1995|volume=31|issue=5|pages=838–850|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.31.5.838|pmid=25147406|pmc=4137788}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans have a tendency to infer intention from motion, even in the absence of other distinguishing features (e.g. body shape, emotional expression). This was demonstrated in a study by Heider and Simmel;&lt;ref name=Heider&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heider|first1=Fritz|last2=Simmel|first2=Marianne|title=An Experimental Study of Apparent Behavior|journal=The American Journal of Psychology|date=1944|volume=57|issue=2|pages=243|doi=10.2307/1416950}}&lt;/ref&gt; they had observers view videos of moving triangles, and found that participants tended to attribute intentions and even personality traits to the shapes based on their movements. The movement had to be animate, meaning self-propelled and non-linear.&lt;ref name="Heider" /&gt;

Johansson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johansson|first1=Gunnar|title=Visual perception of biological motion and a model for its analysis|journal=Perception &amp; Psychophysics|date=1973|volume=14|issue=2|pages=201–211|doi=10.3758/BF03212378}}&lt;/ref&gt; devised a way to study biological motion without interference from other characteristics of humans such as body shape, or emotional expression.  He attached dots of light to actors' joints and recorded the movements in a dark environment, so that only the dots of light were visible.  The Johansson figures, as they came to be known, have been used to demonstrate that individuals attribute mental states, such as desires and intentions to movements, that are otherwise disconnected from context.&lt;ref name="Blakemore" /&gt;

==Simulation theory==
The [[simulation hypothesis]] holds that in order to understand intention in others, individuals must observe an action, and then infer the actor's intentions by [[estimating]] what their own actions and intentions might be in the situation.&lt;ref name="Blakemore" /&gt; Individuals connect their own actions to internal mental states through the experience of sensory information when movements are carried out; this sensory information is stored and connected to one's own intentions. Since internal mental states, such as intention, cannot be understood directly through observing movements, it is hypothesized that these internal states are inferred based on one's own stored representations of those movements.&lt;ref name="Blakemore" /&gt;

This theory is supported by research on [[mirror neuron]]s, or neural regions, including the premotor cortex, and parietal cortex, that activate both when individuals are engaging in an action, and when they are observing the actions of others. This suggests individuals may be simulating the motor movements via internal representations of their own motor movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gallese|first1=Vittorio|last2=Fadiga|first2=Luciano|last3=Fogassi|first3=Leonardo|last4=Rizzolatti|first4=Giacomo|title=Action recognition in the premotor cortex|journal=Brain|date=1996|volume=119|issue=2|pages=593–609|doi=10.1093/brain/119.2.593|pmid=8800951}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gallese|first1=V|title=Mirror neurons and the simulation theory of mind-reading|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=1998|volume=2|issue=12|pages=493–501|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(98)01262-5|pmid=21227300}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, research indicates that humans are hard-wired to notice biological motion, infer intention, and use previous mental representations to predict future actions of others.

==Intentions and behaviors==
Although human behavior is extremely complex and still remains unpredictable, psychologists are trying to understand the influential factors in the process of forming intentions and performing actions. The theories of Reasoned Action and Planned Behavior are comprehensive theories that specify a limited number of psychological variables that can influence behavior, namely (a) intention; (b) attitude toward the behavior; (c) subjective norm; (d) perceived behavioral control; and (e) behavioral, normative and control beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Fishbein, M., Bandura, A., [[Triandis, H. C.]], Kanfer, F. H., Becker, M. H., &amp; Middlestadt, S. E. (1992). Factors influencing behavior and behavior change (Report prepared for the National Institute of Mental Health).Bethesda, MD: National Institute of Mental Health.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[theory of reasoned action]], intention is influenced by people's attitude toward performing the behavior and the subjective norm. However, the level of perceived control is believed to be influential on people's behavioral intention along with their attitude and subjective norms, according to the [[theory of planned behavior]]. Not surprisingly, in most studies, intention is driven by attitudes to a greater extent than by subjective norms.&lt;ref name="Eagly, A. H. 1993"&gt;Eagly, A. H., &amp; Chaiken, S. (1993). The psychology of attitudes. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich College Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;

The predictive validity of the theory of Reasoned Action has been examined in numerous studies that have previously served as literature for at least three quantitative reviews. Ajzen and Fishbein (1973) reviewed 10 studies and reported a .63 average correlation for the prediction of behavior from intentions and a mean multiple correlation of .76 for the equation predicting intentions from both attitudes and norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ajzen | first1 = I. | last2 = Fishbein | first2 = M. | year = 1973 | title = Attitudinal and normative variables as predictors of specific behaviors | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 41–57 | doi=10.1037/h0034440}}&lt;/ref&gt; With similar objectives but larger samples, Sheppard et al.'s and van den Putte's meta-analyses estimated correlations of .53 and .62 for the prediction of behavior and multiple correlations of .66 and .68, respectively, for the prediction of intentions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sheppard | first1 = B. H. | last2 = Hartwick | first2 = J. | last3 = Warshaw | first3 = P. R. | year = 1988 | title = The theory of reasoned action: A meta-analysis of past research with recommendations for modifications and future research | url = | journal = Journal of Consumer Research | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 325–343 | doi=10.1086/209170}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;van den Putte, B. (1991). 20 years of the theory of reasoned action of Fishbein and Ajzen: A meta-analysis. Unpublished manuscript. University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt; All these studies have reflected the strong correlation that exists between people's attitudes, social norms and their intentions, as well as between their intention and the prediction of their behaviors. However, these correlations do not remain unchanged across all the conditions in people's life. Although people are likely to develop intentions to perform the action in question if they have a favorable attitude and perceive the behavior as controllable, then people's perception of control would be irrelevant to intentions when people have negative attitudes and perceive normative pressure not to perform certain actions.&lt;ref name="Eagly, A. H. 1993"/&gt; Research has also shown that people are more likely to perform an action if they have previously formed the corresponding intentions. Their intentions to perform the action appear to derive from attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Albarracin | first1 = D. | last2 = Johnson | first2 = B. T. | last3 = Fishbein | first3 = M. | last4 = Muellerleile | first4 = P. | year = 2001 | title = Theories of Reasoned Action and Planned Behavior as models of condom use: A meta-analysis | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 127 | issue = | pages = 142–161 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.127.1.142 | pmid=11271752 | pmc=4780418}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the reason you are motivated to have a few drinks after work is mostly determined by several factors. The very first one is your intention. Whether you have a positive attitude towards drinking as it can help you relieve stress and enjoy your time can greatly influence your attitude towards drinking after work. The next factor is the subjective norms around you. The level of intention to drink after work you are most likely to develop is influenced by whether significant people around you also hold favorable attitudes towards drinking and whether society tends to reward people who can drink. The last factor is the level of perceived behavioral control you have towards your intended behavior, more specifically how much confidence you have in controlling how much you will drink. If all of these factors tend to enhance your intention to have some drinks after work, you are more likely to do so. The longer you maintain the behavior of drinking after work, the stronger and more consistent your original intention will become. As a result, the greater the likelihood you will have some drinks in the future.

How people think about and verbally communicate their own intentions also impacts these intentions. For example, asking a question about prior behaviors using the imperfective aspect of language seems to be able to bring out stronger intentions to perform such a behavior in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Conner | first1 = M. | last2 = Godin | first2 = G. | last3 = Norman | first3 = P. | last4 = Sheeran | first4 = P. | year = 2011 | title = Using the question-behavior effect to promote disease prevention behaviors: two randomized controlled trials | doi = 10.1037/a0023036 | journal = Health Psychology | volume = 30 | issue = 3| pages = 300–309 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''World Atlas of Language Structures'', "[[Imperfective Aspects]]" refers to a specific form of language structure used for reference to the present and the future but also for ongoing and habitual events in the past. For example, ‘He writes/is writing/wrote/was writing/will write letters.’&lt;ref&gt;Östen Dahl, Viveka Velupillai. 2013. Perfective/Imperfective Aspect. In: Dryer, Matthew S. &amp; Haspelmath, Martin (eds.) The World Atlas of Language Structures Online. Leipzig: Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. Retrieved from http://wals.info/chapter/65 on 2015-07-15.&lt;/ref&gt; People are more likely to interpret the event as ongoing, and likely to resume the action in the future when it has been described with the imperfective verb aspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Madden | first1 = C.J. | last2 = Zwaan | first2 = R.A. | year = 2003 | title = How does verb aspect constrain event representations? | doi = 10.3758/BF03196106 | journal = Memory &amp; Cognition | volume = 31 | issue = 5| pages = 663–672 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, using present tense to describe an action as ongoing may strengthen intentions to perform the same action in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Liroz, F. (2010). Web created by F. Liroz Professor in Spanish Language Department at American School of Madrid, Spain, (date Feb. 6, 2012), http://fernando.liroz.es/m/estverbo.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Previous research has showed that both information on past behavior and their attitude towards such behavior play crucial roles in predicting people's future behavioral tendency.&lt;ref&gt;Ajzen, I., &amp; Fishbein, M. (2000). Attitudes and the attitude-behavior relation: Reasoned and automatic processes. In W. Stroebe &amp; M. Hewstone (Eds.), European Review of Social Psychology (pp. 1-33). John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Albarracin | first1 = D. | last2 = Wyer Jr | first2 = R.

When participants described a past episode using the present tense, they consistently used the more concrete past behavior as a basis for their intentions. In contrast, when participants described a past episode using the past tense, they consistently used the more abstract attitude as a basis for their intentions.&lt;ref name=VerbIntention&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carrera | first1 = P. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2012 | title = The present projects past behavior into the future while the past projects attitudes into the future: How verb tense moderates predictors of drinking intentions | doi = 10.1016/j.jesp.2012.04.001 | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume =  48| issue = | pages =  1196–1200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In molecular [[spectroscopy]], a '''Jablonski diagram''' is a diagram that illustrates the [[electronic state]]s of a [[molecule]] and the transitions between them. The states are arranged vertically by energy and grouped horizontally by [[term symbol|spin multiplicity]]. [[Conical_intersection|Nonradiative transitions]] are indicated by squiggly arrows and [[Photoluminescence|radiative transitions]] by straight arrows. The vibrational ground states of each electronic state are indicated with thick lines, the higher vibrational states with thinner lines.&lt;ref&gt; P., Atkins, P., de Paula, J. ''Atkins' Physical Chemistry'', Oxford University Press, 2002. {{ISBN|0-19-879285-9}} &lt;/ref&gt;
The diagram is named after the Polish physicist [[Aleksander Jabłoński]].&lt;ref&gt;Jabłoński, Aleksander "Efficiency of Anti-Stokes Fluorescence in Dyes" Nature 1933, volume 131, pp. 839-840.  {{doi|10.1038/131839b0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transitions==
[[Image:Jablonski Diagram of Fluorescence Only.png|thumb|Jablonski diagram including vibrational levels for absorbance, non-radiative decay, and [[fluorescence]].]]
Radiative transitions involve the absorption, if the transition occurs to a higher energy level, or the emission, in the reverse case, of a [[photon]]. Nonradiative transitions arise through several different mechanisms, all differently labeled in the diagram. Relaxation of the excited state to its lowest vibrational level is called [[Vibrational energy relaxation|vibrational relaxation]]. This process involves the dissipation of energy from the molecule to its surroundings, and thus it cannot occur for isolated molecules. A second type of nonradiative transition is [[Internal conversion (chemistry)|internal conversion]] (IC), which occurs when a vibrational state of an electronically excited state can couple to a vibrational state of a lower electronic state. A third type is [[intersystem crossing]] (ISC); this is a transition to a state with a different spin multiplicity. In molecules with large [[spin-orbit coupling]], intersystem crossing is much more important than in molecules that exhibit only small spin-orbit coupling. ISC can be followed by [[phosphorescence]].

{{Jainism}}
'''''Lesya''''', according to the [[Jain]] [[Karma in Jainism|theory of karma]], is the coloring of the soul on account of its association with the karmic matter. The colour of ''leśyā'' varies from person to person depending on the psychic states and mental activities behind an action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Dundas | first =Paul |author2=John Hinnels ed.  | title =The Jains | publisher =Routledge | year =2002 | location =London | isbn =0-415-26606-8 }} p.100&lt;/ref&gt; The coloring of the soul is explained through the analogy of crystal, that acquires the color of the matter associated with it. In the same way, the soul reflects the qualities of colour, taste, smell and touch of associated karmic matter, although it is usually the colour that is referred to when discussing the ''leśyās.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Wiley | first =Kristi | title =Colors of the Soul: By-Products of Activity or Passions? | journal =[[Philosophy East and West]] | volume =50 | issue =3 | pages =348–366 | publisher =[[University of Hawaii Press|University of Hawai'i Press]] | location =Hawai'i | date =July 2000 | jstor =1400178 | issn =1527-943X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Dundas notes the key text expressing this Jain doctrine, explaining how the literary form of the text is helpful in dating and reconstructing the history of transmission.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A full statement of the theory of ''lesya'' occurs in chapter 34 of the Uttaradhyayana, one of the fundamental ''sutras'' of the scriptural canon. Inspection of the metrical structure there, which consists of a cluster of old ''sloka'' verses amplified by twice as many verses in the ''[[arya metre]]'', makes clear that a great deal of ancient editorial care was taken to ensure that an original rudimentary description of this dimension of karma became fully cogent.&lt;ref&gt;

The ancient [[Jain Agamas|Jain text]] ''Uttarādhyayana-sūtra'' speaks of six main categories of ''leśyā'' represented by six colours – black (krishna), blue (neel), grey (kapot), red (tejo), yellow (padma) and white (shukla).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Jacobi | first =Hermann | authorlink =Hermann Jacobi | editor =(ed.)

*Black lesya represents the lowest kind of [[:wikt:mental state|state of mind]]. A person in this state of mind shows no [[compassion]] or [[mercy]]. People are afraid of them as these kinds of people are often violent. They also carry [[jealousy]] and animosity within themselves.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A man who acts on the impulse of the five sins, does not possess the three ''guptis'', has not ceased to injure the six (kinds of living beings), commits cruel acts, is wicked and violent, is afraid of no consequences, is mischievous and does not subdue his senses – a man of such habits develops the black ''leśyā''.

— ''Uttarādhyayana-sūtra'', 34.21:22
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*People in this blue lesya of mind are proud, haughty, and lazy. They are unreliable and other people avoid their company. They are cheaters, cowards, and hypocrites. These people also avoid all things religious.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A man of the following qualities: envy, anger, want of self-control, ignorance, deceit, want of modesty, greed, hatred, wickedness, carelessness, love of enjoyment; a man who pursues pleasures and does not abstain from sinful undertakings, who is wicked and violent – a man of such habits develops the blue ''leśyā''.

— ''Uttarādhyayana-sūtra'', 34.23:24
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*Someone in grey lesya always remains sad and gloomy. They find faults in others and are vindictive. They boast about themselves, become excited over small matters, and lack mental balance.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A man who is dishonest in words and acts, who is base, not upright, a dissembler and deceiver 3, a heretic, a vile man, a talker of hurtful and sinful things, a thief, and full of jealousy – a man of such habits develops the grey ''leśyā''. 

— ''Uttarādhyayana-sūtra'', 34.25:26
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*People in red lesya are very careful about their actions and can discriminate between good and evil. They know the difference between what is right and what is wrong. They are kind, benevolent, religious, and lead a harmonious life.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A man who is humble, steadfast, free from deceit and inquisitiveness, well disciplined, restrained, attentive to his study and duties, who loves the Law and keeps it, who is afraid of forbidden things and strives after the highest good–a man of such habits develops the red ''leśyā''. 

— ''Uttarādhyayana-sūtra'', 34.27:28
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:Lesya.jpg|thumb|250px|Lesyas depicted in Folio from ''Samghanayanarayna'' loose leaf manuscript (17th century) from Gujarat or Rajasthan]]
*A person with yellow lesya is kind and benevolent and forgives everyone, even their enemies. They observe some austerities ([[mahavrata]]) and are vigilant in keeping their vows till their last breath. They remain unaffected by joys and sorrows.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A man who has but little anger, pride, deceit, and greed, whose mind is at ease, who controls himself, who is attentive to his study and duties, who speaks but little, is calm, and subdues his senses–a man of such habits develops the yellow ''leśyā''.

— ''Uttarādhyayana-sūtra'', 34.29:30
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*'''Shukla''' ("white") ''leshya'' has two different levels. This state of mind refers to someone who strictly observe the principles of Jainism. They are trustworthy, treat every soul as if it were their own, and do not have any ill feelings even for their enemies. They remain calm even if someone abuses them. Passing in this state of mind allows a being to be reborn as a human being or an angel. People who have perfected this state of mind will become pure and will have escaped the cycle of life and death once they have died.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A man who abstains from constant thinking about his misery and about sinful deeds, but engages in meditation on the law and truth only, whose mind is at ease, who controls himself, who practises the ''samitis'' and ''guptis'', whether he be still subject to passion or free from passion, is calm, and subdues his senses–a man of such habits develops the white ''leśyā''.

— ''Uttarādhyayana-sūtra'', 34.31:32 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Consequences==
The black, blue and grey are inauspicious ''leśyā'' due to which the soul takes birth in various-unhappy states of existence. The yellow, red and white are the auspicious ''leśyās'' that enable a soul to take birth in various happy states of existence.&lt;ref name=varni&gt;*{{cite book | last =Varni | first =Jinendra |editor=Sagarmal Jain |translator=T.K. Tukol |translator2=K.K. Dixit |title=Samaṇ Suttaṁ | publisher =Bhagwan Mahavir memorial Samiti | year =1993 | location =New Delhi }} p.197&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Jain texts]], a person with black Leshya will go to [[Naraka (Jainism)|hell]]. a person with blue lesya is reincarnated in plant life and person with grey lesya is reincarnated in animal life. On the other hand, persons having red lesya are reincarnated as humans, those with yellow lesya are reincarnated as celestial beings while those having white lesya are either reborn in highest heaven or having achieved purity attain liberation.

==Parable of tree==
[[Image:Depiction of lesyas.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Depiction of six persons having six lesyas corresponding to their state of mind and activities]]

The Jain texts further describe the mental dispositions of a soul on account of ''leśyās'' with an example of the reactions of six persons who are travelers, on seeing a fruit-bearing tree. They see a tree laden with fruits and begin to think of getting those fruits: one of them suggests uprooting the entire tree and eating the fruits; the second one suggests cutting the trunk of the tree; the third one suggests cutting the branches only; the fourth one suggests cutting the twigs; the fifth one suggests plucking the fruits only; the sixth one suggests picking up only the fruits that have fallen down. The thoughts, words and bodily activities of each of these six travellers are different based on their mental dispositions and are respectively illustrative of the six ''leśyās''. The person with the black ''leśyā'', having evil disposition, thinks of uprooting the whole tree even though he wants to eat only one fruit. The person proposing to cut the tree trunk has blue ''leśyā'', the one suggesting cutting branches has grey ''leśyā'', the person suggesting cutting twigs has red lesya and the person thinking of simply plucking the fruits has yellow ''leśyā''. On the other hand, the person with the white ''leśyā'', having pure disposition, thinks only of picking up fruits fallen on the ground sparing the tree.&lt;ref name=varni/&gt;

'''''Man: Whence, How and Whither, A Record of Clairvoyant Investigation''''', published in 1913, is a [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] book compiled by the second president of the [[Theosophical Society Adyar|Theosophical Society (TS) - Adyar]], [[Annie Besant]], and by a TS member, [[Charles Webster Leadbeater|Charles W. Leadbeater]].{{refn|group=note|According to [[WorldCat]], "18 editions published between 1913 and 1984 in English and held by 177 WorldCat member libraries worldwide."{{sfn|WorldCat}}}} The book is a study on early [[Round (Theosophy)|times]] on planetary chains, beginnings of early [[root races]], early [[civilization]]s and empires, and past lives of men.{{sfn|Lubelsky|2013|p=351}}{{refn|group=note|There were other collaborative authors [[clairvoyance|clairvoyant]] works, [[Occult Chemistry (book)|''Occult Chemistry'']] (1908) and ''The Lives of Alcyone'' (1924).{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=1013}}}}

At the beginning of the book the authors wrote that "metaphysicians, ancient and modern, declare that Past, Present, and Future are ever simultaneously existent in the divine Consciousness, and are only successive as they come into manifestation, ''i.e.'', under Time which is verily the succession of states of consciousness." Hence, when a mystic turn the soul away from earth and focuses his attention upon the spirit – the soul may approach the "Memory of Nature", the personification in the material world of the "Thoughts of the [[Logos]]," the image, as it were, of "His Mind." There resides the Past in [[Akashic Records|ever-living records]].{{sfn|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|pp=iv–v}}{{sfn|Cayce|1968}}{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=985}}{{sfn|Cerminara|1988}}{{sfn|Todeschi|1998}}{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|pp=106–7}}

The authors say that "they, having been taught the method of gaining touch, but being subject to the difficulties involved in their uncompleted evolution, have done their best to observe and transmit, but are fully conscious of the many weaknesses which mar their work. Occasional help has been given to them by the [[Mahatma|Elder Brethren]]."{{sfn|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|p=v}}

Leadbeater speculated that "the total number of souls, or [[Monad (philosophy)|Monads]],{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=236}} making up humanity was sixty thousand million, the majority being out of incarnation at any given time."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=1010}} Thus [[reincarnation]]{{sfn|Fussell, Poutz|1911|p=408}}{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=236}} had been one of the doctrines of the [[Theosophical Society]] almost from its beginnings.

Leadbeater wrote later that "the two hundred and fifty characters to whom names have been assigned are supposed to be less than one tenth of the whole".{{sfn|Besant, Leadbeater|1924|loc=Foreword}} Professor [[Joscelyn Godwin]] said, "The series of incarnations showed these pioneers going through their own evolution from subhumans to worldly and spiritual leaders of the race."{{sfn|Godwin|2011|loc=Ch. 4}}

== Early root races ==

=== In Lemuria ===

In the chapter VII the authors describe in detail{{refn|group=note|"Leadbeater wrote elaborate descriptions of these things in a style of simplicity and clearness," — claimed Kuhn.{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=329}}}} a remarkable Lemurian:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]] there was some domestication of animals; the egg-headed Lemurian{{refn|group=note|Blavatsky stated that the Lemurian is "the first physical man which itself took place 18,000,000 years ago."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1888b|1p=46|Lubelsky|2013|2p=345}}}} was seen leading about a scaly monster, almost as unattractive as his master. Animals of all sorts were eaten raw – among some tribes human flesh was not despised – and creatures of the grade of our slugs, snails and worms, much larger than their degenerate descendants, were regarded with peculiar favor as toothsome morsels."{{sfnm|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|1p=105|Tillett|1986|2p=452}}{{refn|group=note|Professor [[Joscelyn Godwin]] wrote, "Leadbeater regularly adopts an archly humorous tone when dealing with disgusting habits, ugly people, or lowly human types."{{sfn|Godwin|2011|p=99}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== In Atlantis ===
In the chapter IX the authors wrote about [[Atlantis]] that "explosions of gas, floods and earthquakes" razed Ruta and Daitya, the great islands, left from the cataclysm of 200,000 B.C., and only the island of Poseidonis remained, the last vestige of the once grand continent of the Atlantis. These islands were lost in 75,025 B.C., Poseidonis survived to 9,564 B.C., when it also was devoured by the ocean.{{sfnm|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|1p=132|Lubelsky|2013|2p=351}}

The authors assert in the chapter X of the book:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The immense growth of wealth and of luxury gradually undermined the most splendid civilization that the world has yet seen. Knowledge was prostituted to individual gain, and control over the powers of nature was turned from service to oppression. Hence Atlantis fell, despite the glory of its achievements and the might of its Empires."{{sfn|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|p=139}}{{refn|group=note|Blavatsky claimed, "The civilization of the Atlanteans was greater even than that of the Egyptians. It is their degenerate descendants, the nation of [[Plato|Plato's]] Atlantis, which built the first Pyramids... The great Pyramid must have been built 78,000 years ago."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1888b|1pp=429, 432|Lubelsky|2013|2p=345}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== On the Moon chain ==
[[File:Seven chains.jpg|thumb|left|400px|The seven planetary chains and the five planes.{{sfn|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|p=5}}{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=237}}]]
Blavatsky wrote in ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]''  that the [[Moon]] "plays the largest and most important part, as well in the formation of the [[Earth]] itself, as in the peopling thereof with human beings". The "Lunar Monads" or Pitris, the progenitors of man, become in reality man himself.{{sfn|Blavatsky|1888a|p=180}} A religious studies scholar Isaac Lubelsky stated that Besant and Leadbeater write in the book the chain of the Moon "was an evolutionary precursor of the chain of the planet Earth."{{sfn|Lubelsky|2013|p=351}}

In the chapter III the authors describe in detail how Sirius, Alcyone, Herakles and Mizar{{refn|group=note|[[Mizar (star)|Mizar]] — J. Nityananda (drawn from the lists in the book).{{sfn|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|loc=Foreword}}}} achieved individualization{{refn|group=note|"The divine life begins the evolution of consciousness, building for itself forms on the various planes, passing slowly through the elemental, mineral, vegetable, and animal kingdoms, and finally reaching self-consciousness and individualization, when it passes into the human stage."{{sfn|Fussell, Poutz|1911|p=407}}}} and left the animal kingdom while living as lunar monkey-creatures.{{refn|group=note|The lunar [[manvantara]] generated seven classes of the entities for the earthly manvantara.{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=235}}}} They were servants to a family of lunar men, the leaders of which are now the Masters [[Morya (Theosophy)|M.]] and [[Kuthumi|K.H.]]{{refn|group=note|[[Morya (Theosophy)|M.]] — [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], [[Kuthumi|K.H.]] — [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] (drawn from the lists in the book).{{sfn|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|loc=Foreword}}{{sfn|Godwin|2011|loc=Ch. 4}}}} Leadbeater wrote that "individualization from the animal kingdom usually takes place through association with the humanity of the period. Such examples of it as we occasionally see taking place round us at the present time will serve as instances for us." Some peculiar domestic animal, well treated by its human friends, is stimulated by its permanent contact with them up to the point where it breaks away from the group-soul to which it has previously belonged.{{sfn|Leadbeater|1912|loc=Sect. 6/6}} The authors wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"One night there is an alarm; the hut is surrounded by savages, supported by their domesticated animals, fierce and strong, resembling furry lizards and crocodiles. The faithful guardians spring up around their master's hut and fight desperately in its defence; Mars comes out and drives back the assailants, using some weapons they do not possess; but, while he drives them backward, a lizard-like creature darts behind him into the hut, and catching up the child Surya{{refn|group=note|"Surya — the Lord [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]], the present Bodhisattva, the Supreme Teacher of the world" (drawn from the lists in the book).{{sfn|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|loc=Foreword}}}} begins to carry him away. Sirius springs at him, bearing him down, and throws the child to Alcyone, who carries him back into the hut, while Sirius grapples with the lizard, and, after a desperate struggle, kills it, falling senseless, badly mangled, over its body.  Meanwhile, a savage slips behind Mars and stabs at his back, but Herakles, with one leap, flings himself between his master and the weapon and receives the blow full on his breast, and falls, dying. The savages are now flying in all directions, and Mars, feeling the fall of some creature against his back, staggers, and, recovering himself, turns. He recognizes his faithful animal defender, bends over his dying servant, and places his head in his lap. The poor monkey lifts his eyes, full of intense devotion, to his master's face, and the act of service done, with passionate desire to save, calls down a stream of response from the Will aspect of the Monad in a fierce rush of power, and in the very moment of dying the monkey individualizes, and thus he dies – a man."{{sfnm|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|1pp=35–6|Tillett|1986|2pp=450–51}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Fruits of Evolution ==
[[File:Life-waves.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Successive Life-waves.{{sfn|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|p=7}}{{refn|group=note|"The vertical columns indicate the successive incarnations of the Chain; the horizontal divisions represent the various kingdoms of nature; the diagonal arrows are the successive waves of Evolution which have come forth from the [[Logos]]."{{sfn|Leadbeater|1912|loc=Sect. 6/3}}}}]]
The theosophical concept of Evolution suppose spiritual development of the Mankind will attain the fullness of the stature of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Jesus|Christ]], etc. of the prize of the high calling of God in Christianity.{{sfn|Sellon, Weber|1992|p=324}}{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=236}}

The authors the book proclaimed "when the Human Kingdom is traversed, and man stands on the threshold of His superhuman life, a liberated Spirit", seven paths open before Him for His choosing: He may enter into the blissful omniscience and omnipotence of [[Nirvana]], with activities far beyond our knowing, to become, perchance, in some future world an [[Avatara]], or godlike Incarnation; this is sometimes called, "taking the [[Dharmakaya]] vesture". He may enter on "the Spiritual Period" — a phrase including unknown meanings, among them probably that of "taking the [[Sambhogakaya]] vesture". He may become part of that treasure-house of spiritual forces on which the Agents of the [[Logos]] draw for Their work, "taking the [[Nirmanakaya]] vesture". He may remain a member of the [[Great White Brotherhood|Occult Hierarchy]] which rules and guards the world in which He has reached perfection. He may pass on to the next Chain, to aid in constructing its forms. He may enter the majestic Angel – Deva-Evolution. He may give Himself to the immediate service of the Logos, to be used by Him in any part of the [[Solar System]], His Servant and Messenger, who lives but to carry out His will and do His work over the whole of the system which He controls.{{sfn|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|p=12}}

== Criticism ==
A religious studies scholar [[Alvin Boyd Kuhn|Alvin Kuhn]] wrote in his thesis that ''The Canadian Theosophist'', a magazine published at [[Toronto]], announced a series of articles in which "parallel passages from the writings of Mrs. Blavatsky and the ''[[Mahatma Letters]]'' on one side, and from the books of Mrs. Besant and Mr. Leadbeater, on the other (''Man: whence, how and whither'' included), gave specific evidence bearing on the claims of perversion of the original theories by those whom they call [[Neo-Theosophy|Neo-Theosophists]]."{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=330}}{{refn|group=note|Thomas stated, "Many, many have doubtless been turned away from genuine Theosophy after being exposed to the obvious gibberish of 'Leadbeaterism' and not being aware of the difference."{{sfn|Thomas}}}}

John Prentice in an article ''Clairvoyant Research'' criticized the book of the authors. He proclaimed that the material for the [[Peru]]vian lives in ''Man: whence, how and whither'' (Ch. XI) had been lifted out of Garcilaso de la Vega's ''Royal Commentaries on the Yuccas of Peru'' (written in 1609 and published in English translation in 1638, 1869 and 1871).{{sfn|Prentice|1923}}

Joseph Fussell wrote about "abnormal and preposterous claims" published by Besant and Leadbeater.{{sfn|Fussell|1914}}{{sfn|Tillett|1986|pp=630–31}}

[[Helena Roerich]] stated that Leadbeater's books are a mix of "false and ugly" statements and some fragments of truth: one of the [[Mahatma|Great Masters]] supposedly called the book ''Man: Whence, How and Whither'' as "a work which devoid of knowledge, honesty and beauty."{{sfn|Рерих|2001}} She wrote: "The book by Besant and Leadbeater is particularly awful, therein is described the lives supposedly the Great Masters and some their pupils, namely: Besant, Leadbeater... I've never seen anything equal to this tasteless blasphemy and falsehood."{{sfn|Рерих|1993|p=45}}

Professor [[Olav Hammer]] stated that Leadbeater's claims about past lives "were increasingly used to buttress power struggles." He wrote, "Those who supported the controversial Leadbeater were recorded as having had important roles in the past, while his opponents were depicted as villains."
{{sfnm|Washington|1995|1p=129|Hammer|2003|2p=474}} In his thesis Hammer wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"How can Leadbeater's readers know that his clairvoyant results really are 'records' and 'information', rather than delusions or deliberate fabrications? His response is feeble, 'there is no assurance. The investigators themselves are certain &lt;...&gt; of the difference between observation and imagination'."{{sfnm|Besant, Leadbeater|1913|1p=485|Hammer|2003|2p=474}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Alice Bailey]] stated that the book published at Adyar by Besant and Leadbeater was "psychic in his implications and impossible of verification". In her ''Unfinished Autobiography'' she wrote that it proved to her the "untrustworthiness" of Leadbeater's writings:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Books were being published at Adyar by Mr. Leadbeater that were psychic in their implications and impossible of verification,  carrying a strong note of astralism. One of his major works, ''Man: Whence, How and Whither,'' was a book that proved to me the basic untrustworthiness of what he wrote. It is a book that outlines the future and the work of the Hierarchy of the future, and the curious and arresting thing to me was that the majority of the people slated to hold high office in the Hierarchy and in the future coming civilisation were all Mr. Leadbeater's personal friends. I knew some of these people—worthy, kind, and mediocre, none of them intellectual giants and most of them completely unimportant."{{sfn|Bailey|2013|loc=Ch. IV}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Siddha Shila.jpg|thumb|Depiction of Siddha Shila as per [[Jain cosmology]] which is abode of infinite Siddhas]]
{{Jainism}}
[[Sanskrit]] '''''{{IAST|moksha}}''''' or [[Prakrit]] '''''mokkha''''' refers to the liberation or salvation of a soul from ''[[Saṃsāra (Jainism)|saṃsāra]]'', the cycle of birth and death. It is a blissful state of existence of a soul, attained after the destruction of all [[Karma in Jainism|karmic bonds]]. A liberated soul is said to have attained its true and pristine nature of infinite bliss, infinite knowledge and infinite perception. Such a soul is called ''[[Siddha#Siddha in Jainism|siddha]]'' and is revered in Jainism.

In [[Jainism]], ''moksha'' is the highest and the noblest objective that a soul should strive to achieve. In fact, it is the only objective that a person should have; other objectives are contrary to the true nature of soul. With the right view, knowledge and efforts all souls can attain this state. That is why Jainism is also known as ''{{IAST|mokṣamārga}}'' or the "path to liberation".

According to the Sacred Jain Text, [[Tattvartha sutra]]:{{quote|Owing to the absence of the cause of bondage and with the functioning of the dissociation of karmas the annihilation of all karmas is liberation.|Tattvārthsūtra (10-2){{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=146}}}}

==Bhavyata==

From the point of view of potentiality of {{IAST|mokṣa}}, Jain texts bifurcates the souls in two categories–''bhavya'' and ''abhavya''. ''Bhavya'' souls are those souls who have faith in {{IAST|mokṣa}} and hence will make some efforts to achieve liberation.{{sfn|Jaini|2000|p=95}} This potentiality or quality is called ''bhavyata''.{{sfn|Jaini|2000|p=95}} However, ''bhavyata'' itself does not guarantee {{IAST|mokṣa}}, as the soul needs to expend necessary efforts to attain it. On the other hand, ''abhavya'' souls are those souls who cannot attain liberation as they do not have faith in {{IAST|mokṣa}} and hence never make any efforts to attain it.{{sfn|Jaini|2000|p=95}}

==The Path to Liberation==
According to Jainism, the ''[[Ratnatraya]]'' or "three Gems", ''samyagdarśana'' (correct perception), ''samyagjñāna'' (right knowledge) and ''samyakchāritra'' (right conduct), together constitute the ''mokṣamarga'' or the path to liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Kuhn | first =Hermann | title =Karma, The Mechanism : Create Your Own Fate | publisher =Crosswind Publishing | year =2001 | location =Wunstorf, Germany | isbn =3-9806211-4-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Acharya [[KundaKunda]]'s [[Samayasara]]:{{quote|Belief in the nine substances as they are is right faith (samyagdarśana). Knowledge of these substances without doubt, delusion or misapprehension, is right knowledge (samyagjñāna). Being free from attachment etc. is right conduct (samyakcāritra). These three, together, constitute the path to liberation.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=165}}}}

''Samyak Darsana'' or rational perception is the rational faith in the true nature of every substance of the universe.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=}}{{pn|date=August 2017}}

''Samyak Caritra'' or rational conduct is the natural conduct of a (soul) living being. It consists in following austerities, engaging in right activities and observance of vows, carefulness and controls.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book | last =Varni | first =Jinendra | editor = Prof. Sagarmal Jain, Translated Justice T.K. Tukol and Dr. K.K. Dixit | title ={{IAST|Samaṇ Suttaṁ}} | publisher =Bhagwan Mahavir memorial Samiti | year =1993 | location =New Delhi }} Verse 262 - 4&lt;/ref&gt;
Once a soul secures ''samyaktva'', {{IAST|mokṣa}} is assured within a few lifetimes.
The fourteen stages on the path to liberation are called ''[[Gunasthana|Gunasthāna]]''. These are:{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2014|p=14}}
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Gunasthāna (Stages on the Path) !! Meaning
|-
|1. ''Mithyātva'' || The stage of wrong believer (Gross ignorance)

Those who pass the last stage are called ''siddha'' and become fully established in Right Faith, Right Knowledge and Right Conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EscwAQAAMAAJ|title=The Practical Path|author=Champat Rai Jain|authorlink=Champat Rai Jain|year=1917|publisher=The Central Jaina Publishing House|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{IAST|Nirvāna}}==
{{IAST|Nirvāna}} means final release from the karmic bondage. When an enlightened human, such as an Arihant or a [[Tirthankara]], extinguishes his remaining ''aghatiya karmas'' and thus ends his worldly existence, it is called {{IAST|nirvāna}}. Technically, the death of an Arhat is called their nirvāṇa, as he has ended his worldly existence and attained liberation. Moksha (liberation) follows nirvāṇa. However, the terms ''moksa'' and ''nirvana'' are often used interchangeably in the [[Jain texts]].{{sfn|Jaini|2000|p=168}}&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Michael Carrithers, Caroline Humphrey (1991) ''The Assembly of listeners: Jains in society'' Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0521365058}}: ''"Nirvana: A synonym for liberation, release, moksa."'' p.297&lt;/ref&gt; An Arhat becomes a siddha, the liberated one, after attaining nirvana.

In that night in which the Venerable Ascetic Mahavira, died, freed from all pains, the eighteen confederate kings of Kasi and Kosala, the nine Mallakis and nine Licchavis, on the day of new moon, instituted an illuminations on the Poshadha, which was a fasting day; for they said: 'Since the light of intelligence is gone, let us make an illumination of material matter!'(128)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Jacobi | first =Hermann |author2=Ed.

== Liberated soul ==
A liberated soul dwell in ''[[Siddhashila]]'' with infinite faith, infinite knowledge, infinite perception, and infinite perfection. According to the Jain text, ''Puruşārthasiddhyupāya'':
{{quote|Having achieved the ultimate goal, knowing everything that needs to be known, and enjoying eternal and supreme bliss, the Omniscient, Effulgent Soul, rests permanently in the Highest State (of liberation).|Puruşārthasiddhyupāya (224){{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=178}}}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17543">The '''Moldovan schools in Transnistria''' became an issue of contention in 2004 in the context of the [[disputed status of Transnistria]], a breakaway region of [[Moldova]] since 1990/1992.

== History ==
Moldovan schools were first established in Transnistria after the 1924 formation of the [[Moldovan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]], which was part of the Soviet Republic of [[Ukraine]]. In 1940 the former Moldovan Autonomous Republic was split, 8 districts were included in the [[Ukraine|Soviet Socialist Republic of Ukraine]] and 6 districts were joined with part of [[Basarabia]] in the [[Republic of Moldova|Soviet Socialist Republic of Moldavia]]. In the Ukrainian part of the former Moldavian autonomy Moldovan schools were transformed into Russian-language schools, but in the 6 districts that remained part of the [[Republic of Moldova|Soviet Socialist Republic of Moldova]] a Moldovan-language network of schools was kept.

==Post 1992 situation==

The Moldovan 1989 language law, that introduced the Latin script as the official script of the Republic of Moldova, was boycotted by the Transnistrian authorities, and all Moldovan schools in Transnistria were ordered to keep the Cyrillic script. After the [[War of Transnistria]] ended in mid-1992, the local schools became regulated by the government of Transnistria. The schools that chose to use the Latin script back in 1989 came under pressure of the authorities and most were forced to return to the Cyrillic script. Only six Romanian language schools in Transnistria were allowed to keep the Latin script.

Attempts to expand the number of schools which are using Latin script are met with heavy-handed repression. In 1996, the director of the only Moldovan school in [[Slobozia, Moldova|Slobozia]], who supported the wish of the parents to conduct education in Latin alphabet was fired and forced to leave the region. In 1999 a lecturer of Moldovan language of the Bender Pedagogical College has been dismissed for promoting the Latin script in the institution. The dismissal has been preceded by threats on the phone and an aggression in the building where she lived.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050619192931/http://www.coe.int/t/e/human_rights/minorities/3._co-operation_activities/1._co-operation_activities/2._stability_pact_activities/PDF_SP_NDR%282002%29011%20Preliminary_Report_Moldova.pdf Non discrimination review under the stability pact for South Eastern Europe]&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1996, the [[Grigoriopol]] administration used Cossacks and police to stop the activity of Moldovan School.&lt;ref&gt;[http://transnistria.md/en/interview/0/126/5 Interview with Eleonora Cecavski, teacher from Grigoriopol] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927024802/http://transnistria.md/en/interview/0/126/5 |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 October 1996 three teachers were arrested and taken to Tiraspol. On 7 October 1996, as a result of a demarche by the President of the Republic of Moldova and the OSCE Mission, the teachers were released.

Another attempt to teach Romanian clandestinely in Grigoriopol, in a ‘PMR state-funded school’, failed in 2002. Teaching staff and parents were blatantly vilified in the local press as ‘enemies of the State’.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.md/article/ld15.htm BIG SCANDAL IN A SMALL TOWN, article in "Dnestrovsky Kurier" 8 March 2002] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060912130836/http://www.unhcr.md/article/ld15.htm |date=12 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One by one they were invited to ‘reconsider’, threatened with loss of employment and the corresponding entitlement to housing. Children (and teachers) were forced to write explanations as to why they used the Latin script and local officials routinely visited classes to check whether tuition was being ‘properly’ conducted. The parent-teacher association was abolished and its head, [[Mihai Speian]], was arrested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soviet-medals-orders.com/images/Publ/andrysek&amp;grecu4.htm Unworthy partner: the schools issue as an example of human rights abuses in Transdniestria]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820031858/http://www.soviet-medals-orders.com/images/Publ/andrysek%26grecu4.htm |date=20 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Moldovan school in Grigoriopol was forced to move in [[Doroţcaia|Doroțcaia]], a village controlled by Chișinău, and children commute 10–15&amp;nbsp;km daily to attend the school.

== The 2004 crisis ==
In the summer of 2004, the Transnistrian authorities closed four of the six schools in the region that taught [[Moldovan language]] using the [[Latin]] script, known as Romanian. Some of the 3,400 enrolled children were affected by this measure and the teachers and parents who opposed the closures were temporarily arrested for up to six hours. During the crisis, the Moldovan government decided to create a blockade that would isolate the disputed region from the rest of the world. The blockade was ineffective because of a lack of cooperation from [[Ukraine]], led at the time by [[Leonid Kuchma]]. Transnistria retaliated with a series of actions meant to destabilize the economic situation in Moldova, in particular, by cutting the power supply from the power plants that were built in Transnistria in [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] times. As a result, this crisis generated power outages in parts of Moldova.

A leading figure in the conflict was [[Elena Vasilievna Bomeshko]], the Minister of Education for Transnistria. According to her, and official Transnistrian policy, the language is referred to as "[[Romanian language|Romanian]]" when it is taught in Latin script and referred to as "Moldovan" when [[Cyrillic]] script is used. Transnistria rejects accusations of anti-Romanian bias and defends its preference of Cyrillic for Moldovan as a way to maintain the original language, pointing to the fact as far back as the Middle Ages, Moldovan [[Bible]]s were always written in Cyrillic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tiras.ru/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1381 Interview with V. Tulgar, Union of Moldovans] {{dead link|date=February 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; While the Romanian language used the Cyrillic alphabet for centuries, it is no longer used in Romania. Cyrillic script is still used in some parts of Moldova, but only one newspaper (state-owned by Transnistrian authorities) prints a few hundred copies in Cyrillic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rgnpress.ro/content/view/18846// RGN Press report: No Romanian language textbooks available in Grigoriopol.]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (in Romanian)&lt;/ref&gt;

The closed Romanian schools were reopened, after registering as private institutions with the Transnistrian authorities. Pressure from the European Union (a travel ban was introduced to 10 Transnistrian education officials) may have sped up the process.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[...] The Decision reduces the list of persons (from ten to two) affected by visa restrictions in order to take account of the improvements in the situation of Latin-script schools in some areas of the Transnistrian region.
In August 2004, the Council expanded the scope of the restrictive measures to persons held responsible for the intimidation campaign and the closure of Latin-script Moldovan schools and established a new list of persons subject to the visa-ban.''"&lt;/ref&gt; but they still have the status of "private schools" and consequently do not receive funding from the Transnistrian government.

Many teachers and parents of students studying at Moldovan schools with Cyrillic script had contacted the Moldovan Helsinki Committee for Human Rights asking support to turn education in Romanian (Latin script), as the studies based on the Cyrillic script and Soviet curricula don't have any perspective and the children are unable to pursue higher studies anywhere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azi.md/news?ID=31564 Helsinki-Moldova Committee Says About 50 Schools in Transnistria Want to Study in Romanian] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927175634/http://www.azi.md/news?ID=31564 |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The OSCE [[High Commissioner on National Minorities]] has condemned the actions of Transnistrian authorities as a "linguistic cleansing".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160218033937/http://www.osce.org/hcnm/56534 OSCE: Linguistic cleansing underway in Transdniestria]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current situation==
[[File:Liceul Alexandru cel Bun Tighina 13.jpg|thumb|Students at Alexandru cel Bun High School in Bender celebrating the end of the academic year in May 2013]]
An OSCE report from June 2005 states: “If they [Moldovan parents in Transnistria] enroll their children in one of this schools that offer a Moldovan curriculum using a Latin script, they risk being threatened by the regional security service, and seeing their jobs put in jeopardy. Sending their children in one of the 33 Transdniestrian schools they teach in their native language in Cyrillic is, however, hardly an appealing alternative, as the schools follow an out-dated curriculum and use textbooks from the Soviet period”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osce.org/documents/html/pdftohtml/15621_425_en.pdf.html OSCE report: Moldovan schools in Transdniestria] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606163208/http://www.osce.org/documents/html/pdftohtml/15621_425_en.pdf.html |date=6 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the reason why many Moldovans from [[Transnistria]] send their children in harassment-free Russian language schools.

Transnistrian authorities don't recognize the diplomas issued by Moldovan schools using Latin script, making impossible for graduates of those schools to study on Transnistrian higher educational institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tiraspoltimes.com/news/education_ministry_see_minority_schools_as_pawn_in_political_game.html Transnistrian point of view about Moldovan schools] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930024100/http://tiraspoltimes.com/news/education_ministry_see_minority_schools_as_pawn_in_political_game.html |date=30 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Involvement of European Court of Human Rights===
In November 2006 the European Court of Human Rights accepted to examine the claims submitted by three Moldovan schools in Transnistria (from Tighina, Rîbnița and Grigoriopol) regarding the violation of their right to education and right to work in conditions of non-discrimination. The three schools concerned regard Russia and Moldova as responsible for violation of their rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conflict.md/stiri.php?ID=1918 ECHR TO CONSIDER CLAIMS LODGED BY MOLDOVAN SCHOOLS IN TRANSNISTRIA] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927005441/http://conflict.md/stiri.php?ID=1918 |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, the Court conducted hearings on three similar cases: Caldare and 42 Others v.

=== Pressure on Transnistrian authorities ===
In November 2006, [[Louis O'Neill]], head of OSCE mission to Moldova, has urged local authorities in the Transnistrian city of Rîbnița to return a confiscated building to the Moldovan Latin-script school located in the city. The building was built by the Government from Chișinău and was almost finished in 2004, when Transnistrian police took it by force, during the school crisis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osce.org/item/22208.html?print=1 Ribnitsa authorities must return confiscated school building, says OSCE Mission Head] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303195911/http://www.osce.org/item/22208.html?print=1 |date=3 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nuamthong Praiwan''' ({{lang-th|นวมทอง ไพรวัลย์}}; {{RTGS|Nuamthong Phraiwan}}) (1946–1 November 2006)&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070121184910/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/11/02/headlines/headlines_30017813.php Taxi driver 'sacrificed himself for democracy']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/01/world/asia/01iht-asia.3356016.html Briefly: Government troops hit rebel positions from air - Asia - Pacific - International Herald Tribune]&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Thai people|Thai]] taxi driver who drove his taxi into a [[army tank|tank]] in protest after the [[2006 Thailand coup d'état|military coup of 2006]]. He was later found hanging from a [[Vibhavadi Rangsit Road|pedestrian footbridge]]. Officials found a suicide note and later ruled his death a suicide. His sacrifices were praised by several democracy activists.

==Driving taxi into tank==
At 6 am, Saturday 30 September 2006, Nuamthong drove his taxi, spray painted with the words "[CDR is] destroying the country," and "Sacrificing life", into an M41 Walker Bulldog tank at Bangkok's Royal Plaza. Nuamthong was severely injured and taken to a police station nearby. "I did it intentionally to protest the junta that has destroyed our country, and I painted all the words myself," noted Nuamthong to reporters from his bed at Vachira Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, [http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30015059 A man collides his taxi with tank], 30 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matichon, [http://www.norsorpor.com/go2.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.matichon.co.th%2Fbreaking-news%2Fbreaking-news.php%3Fnid%3DMjAwNjA5MzAtMTYwNTA4 Matichon Information Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuamthong was charged with damaging state property.&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, [http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/10/01/headlines/headlines_30015091.php Protesting driver rams taxi into Army tank], 2 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities downplayed the incident, saying that Nuamthong was drunk and no messages were sprayed on the taxi. However, several newspapers reported on the legibility of the words painted on the car.&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, [http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/09/30/headlines/headlines_30015065.php A taxi slammed into a tank], 30 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Akkara Thiproj]], deputy spokesperson for the [[Council for Democratic Reform|military junta]], expressed scepticism about Nuamthong's intentions in crashing into the tank, and claimed that "Nobodies’ ideals are so great that they would sacrifice their lives for them."&lt;ref name="sensitivity"&gt;The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/11/02/headlines/headlines_30017812.php Suicide is treated with sensitivity by officials], 2 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{th icon}} Prachatai, [http://www.prachatai.com/05web/th/home/page2.php?mod=mod_ptcms&amp;ContentID=5677&amp;SystemModuleKey=HilightNews&amp;System_Session_Language=Thai เครือข่าย 19 กันยาฯ ออกแถลงการณ์ไว้อาลัย ‘นวมทอง ไพรวัลย์’], 2 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nuamthong's taxi.jpg|thumb|200px|Driving taxi into tank]]
He was released from the hospital on 12 October, and attended the 33rd anniversary of the [[History of Thailand (1932-1973)#The 1973 democracy movement|14 October 1973 democratic uprising]].

==Death==
Nuamgthong's body was found hanging, with a hood covering his face, from a footbridge on [[Vibhavadi Rangsit Road|Vibhavadi Rangsit road]] near the headquarters of [[Thai Rath]] newspaper in [[Bangkok]] on 1 November 2006. Police ruled the death a suicide after forensic tests were stated to have shown no traces of a physical assault or struggle. Although Nuamthong's body was found with a suicide note, family members testified that he had given no hint of being depressed or about to commit suicide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bact.blogspot.com/2006/11/nuamthong-praiwal.html bact' is a name: Nuamthong Praiwal]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{th icon}} Prachatai, [http://www.prachatai.com/05web/th/home/page2.php?mod=mod_ptcms&amp;ContentID=5657&amp;SystemModuleKey=HilightNews&amp;System_Session_Language=Thai จดหมายจากใจแท็กซี่พลีชีพ “ชาติหน้าเกิดมาคงไม่พบเจอการปฏิวัติอีก], 2 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Nuamthong wore a black T-shirt with a drawing of the [[Democracy Monument (Bangkok)|Democracy Monument]] and a poem about the power of the masses. Newspaper clippings about his crash into the army tank were also found on his body. His wife, Boonchu, said he had given no farewells or done anything that would suggest he was planning to kill himself.&lt;ref&gt;The Bangkok Post, [http://bangkokpost.net/News/02Nov2006_news03.php Taxi driver hangs self in protest at coup d'etat], 2 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30017724 Surayud believes there will be no copycat of suicide taxi driver], 2 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

His wife noted, "I couldn't be more sad losing the love of my life and the leader of my family. I didn't think he would be this brave, but I'm very proud of him for sacrificing for the country."&lt;ref name="nationmultimedia.com"&gt;The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/11/02/headlines/headlines_30017813.php Taxi driver 'sacrificed himself for democracy'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070121184910/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/11/02/headlines/headlines_30017813.php |date=2007-01-21 }}, 2 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funeral==
Funeral rites were held at [[Wat]] Bua Kwan in [[Nonthaburi (city)|Nonthaburi]]'s Muang district. A score of senior police showed up at his funeral at Wat Bua Kwan in Nonthaburi to "keep the peace" while pro-democracy groups sent representatives and flower wreaths to honour his death.

His wife later attempted to transport his coffin to the 14 October 1973 Memorial on Ratchadamnoen road for bathing rituals. Police prevented her van from arriving at the Memorial.

About 200 people attended the second night of Nuamthong's funeral at Wat Bua Kwan. Among them were military and police officers, politicians from the Thai Rak Thai Party and [[National Human Rights Commission (Thailand)|National Human Rights Commissioner]] Jaran Dithapichai. [[Sant Hathirat]] read a statement declaring Nuamthong a "democracy martyr."&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/11/03/national/national_30017926.php iTV rapped for report on driver's final words] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115134158/http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/11/03/national/national_30017926.php |date=2006-11-15 }}, 3 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also praised by activist and former senator Prateep Ungsongtham Hata, who noted, "Uncle Nuamthong has made the biggest sacrifice for democracy. I fought for democracy all my life but don't have the courage to do as much as he did."

Junta deputy spokesperson [[Akara Tipparoj]] apologised for his earlier claim that nobody would hurt themselves for political ideals and claimed he planned to attend the funeral.

The Young People for Democracy Movement (YPD) condemned Akara's views as ignorant and noted that "His remark is an insult, as Thailand has a long history of people dying to defend democracy from dictatorship."

Prime Minister General [[Surayud Chulanont]] said he was saddened by the news but doubted there would be copycat suicide attempts.&lt;ref name="sensitivity" /&gt;

After his death, an interview Nuamthong had earlier given was partially aired by [[iTV (Thailand)|iTV]]. The broadcast came to an abrupt end after the Director of Army-owned [[Royal Thai Army Radio and Television Channel 5|Channel 5]] called to give a warning.&lt;ref name="nationmultimedia.com"/&gt; Additional troops were dispatched [[Censorship in Thailand|to keep order at the station]].

== Last letter ==
{{Quote|Glorify the Nation, Religion, King, &lt;s&gt;Military State&lt;/s&gt; and &lt;s&gt;Police State&lt;/s&gt; (must be inexisted).&lt;br&gt;
Dear my respected friends and people. A reason of my second suicide by destroying myself is avoiding mischief like the first time, in order to resist the speech of Mr. Vice Spokesman of the CDR ([[Council for National Security|Council for Democratic Reform]]) [...], "No one devotes their death for their ideologies". ...| Goodbye and meet me in next life. &lt;br&gt; Nuamthong Praiwan &lt;br&gt; October 29, 2006}}

==History of orphan genes==
Orphan genes were first discovered when the yeast genome-sequencing project began in 1996.&lt;ref name="Tautz"/&gt; Orphan genes accounted for an estimated 26% of the yeast genome, but it was believed that these genes could be classified with homologues when more genomes were sequenced.&lt;ref name="Khalturin"/&gt; At the time, gene duplication was considered the only serious model of gene evolution&lt;ref name="Tautz" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jacob|first=F.|date=1977-06-10|title=Evolution and tinkering|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/196/4295/1161|journal=Science|language=en|volume=196|issue=4295|pages=1161–1166|doi=10.1126/science.860134|pmid=860134|bibcode=1977Sci...196.1161J}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there were few sequenced genomes for comparison, so a lack of detectable homologues was thought to be most likely due to a lack of sequencing data and not due to a true lack of homology.&lt;ref name="Khalturin" /&gt; However, orphan genes continued to persist as the quantity of sequenced genomes grew,&lt;ref name="Khalturin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilson | first1 = G. A. | last2 = Bertrand | first2 = N. | last3 = Patel | first3 = Y. | last4 = Hughes | first4 = J. B. | last5 = Feil | first5 = E.

The study of orphan genes emerged largely after the turn of the century. In 2003, a study of ''[[Caenorhabditis briggsae]]'' and related species compared over 2000 genes.&lt;ref name="Khalturin"/&gt; They proposed that these genes must be evolving too quickly to be detected and are consequently sites of very rapid evolution.&lt;ref name="Khalturin"/&gt;  In 2005, Wilson examined 122 bacterial species to try to examine whether the large number of orphan genes in many species was legitimate.&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt; The study found that it was legitimate and played a role in bacterial adaptation. The definition of taxonomically-restricted genes was introduced into the literature to make orphan genes seem less "mysterious."&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt;

In 2008, a yeast protein of established functionality, BSC4, was found to have evolved de novo from non-coding sequences whose homology was still detectable in sister species.&lt;ref name="Cai 2008"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cai|first=Jing|last2=Zhao|first2=Ruoping|last3=Jiang|first3=Huifeng|last4=Wang|first4=Wen|date=2008-05-01|title=De Novo Origination of a New Protein-Coding Gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae|url=http://www.genetics.org/content/179/1/487|journal=Genetics|language=en|volume=179|issue=1|pages=487–496|doi=10.1534/genetics.107.084491|pmc=2390625|pmid=18493065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, an orphan gene was discovered to regulate an internal biological network:  the orphan gene, QQS, from ''Arabidopsis thaliana'' modifies plant composition.&lt;ref name="Foster, C.

==How to identify orphan genes==
Genes can be tentatively classified as orphans if no orthologous proteins can be found in nearby species.&lt;ref name="Wissler"/&gt;

One method used to estimate nucleotide or protein sequence similarity indicative of homology (i.e. similarity due to common origin) is the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). BLAST allows query sequences to be rapidly searched against large sequence databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Altschul|first1=S.|title=Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST: a new generation of protein database search programs|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=1 September 1997|volume=25|issue=17|pages=3389–3402|doi=10.1093/nar/25.17.3389|pmid=9254694|pmc=146917}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NCBI BLAST homepage|url=http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simulations suggest that under certain conditions BLAST is suitable for detecting distant relatives of a gene.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alba|first1=M|last2=Castresana|first2=J|title=On homology searches by protein BLAST and the characterization of the age of genes|journal=BMC Evol.

The systematic detection of homology to annotate orphan genes is called phylostratigraphy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A phylostratigraphy approach to uncover the genomic history of major adaptations in metazoan lineages|url = http://www.cell.com/article/S0168952507002995/abstract|journal = Trends in Genetics|date = 2007-01-11|pmid = 18029048|pages = 533–539|volume = 23|issue = 11|doi = 10.1016/j.tig.2007.08.014|first = Tomislav|last = Domazet-Lošo|first2 = Josip|last2 = Brajković|first3 = Diethard|last3 = Tautz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phylostratigraphy generates a phylogenetic tree in which the homology is calculated between all genes of a focal species and the genes of other species. The earliest common ancestor for a gene determines the age, or phylostratum, of the gene. The term "orphan" is sometimes used only for the youngest phylostratum containing only a single species, but when interpreted broadly as a taxonomically-restricted gene, it can refer to all but the oldest phylostratum, with the gene orphaned within a larger clade.

==Where do orphan genes come from?==
Orphan genes arise from multiple sources, predominantly through de novo origination, duplication and rapid divergence, and horizontal gene transfer.&lt;ref name="Tautz" /&gt;

=== De Novo Origination ===
Novel orphan genes continually arise de novo from non-coding sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McLysaght|first1=Aoife|last2=Guerzoni|first2=Daniele|title=New genes from non-coding sequence: the role of de novo protein-coding genes in eukaryotic evolutionary innovation|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=31 August 2015|volume=370|issue=1678|pages=20140332|doi=10.1098/rstb.2014.0332|pmid=26323763|pmc=4571571}}&lt;/ref&gt; These novel genes may be sufficiently beneficial to be swept to fixation by selection. Or, more likely, they will fade back into the non-genic background. This latter option is supported by research in Drosophila showing that young genes are more likely go extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Palmieri|first1=Nicola|last2=Kosiol|first2=Carolin|last3=Schlötterer|first3=Christian|title=The life cycle of orphan genes|journal=eLife|date=19 February 2014|volume=3|pages=e01311|doi=10.7554/eLife.01311|pmid=24554240|pmc=3927632}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De novo genes were once thought to be a near impossibility due to the complex and potentially fragile intricacies of creating and maintaining functional polypeptides,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; but research from the past 10 years or so has found multiple examples of de novo genes, some of which are associated with important biological processes, particularly testes function in animals.

For young orphan genes, it is sometimes possible to find homologous non-coding DNA sequences in sister taxa, which is generally accepted as strong evidence of de novo origin. However, the contribution of de novo origination to taxonomically-restricted genes of older origin, particularly in relation to the traditional gene duplication theory of gene evolution, remains contested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neme|first=Rafik|last2=Tautz|first2=Diethard|date=2014-03-17|title=Evolution: Dynamics of De Novo Gene Emergence|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982214001547|journal=Current Biology|volume=24|issue=6|pages=R238–R240|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2014.02.016|pmid=24650912}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moyers|first=Bryan A.|last2=Zhang|first2=Jianzhi|date=2016-01-11|title=Evaluating phylostratigraphic evidence for widespread de novo gene birth in genome evolution|url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/01/11/molbev.msw008|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|language=en|pages=1245–56|doi=10.1093/molbev/msw008|pmc=5010002| pmid=26758516|volume=33|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Duplication and Divergence ===
The duplication and divergence model for orphan genes involves a new gene being created from some duplication or divergence event and undergoing a period of rapid evolution where all detectable similarity to the originally duplicated gene is lost.&lt;ref name="Tautz" /&gt; While this explanation is consistent with current understandings of duplication mechanisms,&lt;ref name="Tautz" /&gt; the number of mutations needed to lose detectable similarity is large enough as to be a rare event,&lt;ref name="Tautz" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and the evolutionary mechanism by which a gene duplicate could be sequestered and diverge so rapidly remains unclear.&lt;ref name="Tautz" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The altered evolutionary trajectories of gene duplicates|journal = Trends in Genetics|date = 2004-11-01|pmid = 15475113|pages = 544–549|volume = 20|issue = 11|doi = 10.1016/j.tig.2004.09.001|first = Michael|last = Lynch|first2 = Vaishali|last2 = Katju|citeseerx = 10.1.1.335.7718}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Horizontal Gene Transfer ===
Another explanation for how orphan genes arise is through a duplication mechanism called [[horizontal gene transfer]], where the original duplicated gene derives from a separate, unknown lineage.&lt;ref name="Tautz" /&gt; This explanation for the origin of orphan genes is especially relevant in bacteria and archaea, where horizontal gene transfer is common.

==Protein characteristics==
Orphans genes tend to be very short (~6 times shorter than mature genes), and some are weakly expressed, tissue specific and simpler in codon usage and amino acid composition.&lt;ref name="Zebulun W 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arendsee|first1=Zebulun W.|last2=Li|first2=Ling|last3=Wurtele|first3=Eve Syrkin|title=Coming of age: orphan genes in plants|journal=Trends in Plant Science|date=November 2014|volume=19|issue=11|pages=698–708|doi=10.1016/j.tplants.2014.07.003|pmid=25151064}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orphan genes tend to encode more [[intrinsically disordered proteins]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mukherjee|first1=S.|last2=Panda|first2=A.|last3=Ghosh|first3=T.C.|title=Elucidating evolutionary features and functional implications of orphan genes in ''Leishmania major''|journal=Infection, Genetics and Evolution|date=June 2015|doi=10.1016/j.meegid.2015.03.031|pmid=25843649|volume=32 |pages=330–337}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=Benjamin A.|last2=Foy|first2=Scott G.|last3=Neme |first3=Rafik |last4=Masel|first4=Joanna |author4link=Joanna Masel|title=Young genes are highly disordered as predicted by the preadaptation hypothesis of de novo gene birth |journal=Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution|date=24 April 2017|volume=1|issue=6|pages=0146|doi=10.1038/s41559-017-0146|pmid=28642936|pmc=5476217}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="willis_2018"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Willis |first1=Sara |last2=Masel |first2=Joanna |title=Gene Birth Contributes to Structural Disorder Encoded by Overlapping Genes |journal=Genetics |date=19 July 2018 |volume=210 |issue=1 |pages=303–313 |doi=10.1534/genetics.118.301249 |pmid=30026186 |pmc=6116962 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, although some structure has been found in one of the best characterized orphan genes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bungard |first1=Dixie |last2=Copple |first2=Jacob S. |last3=Yan |first3=Jing |last4=Chhun |first4=Jimmy J. |last5=Kumirov |first5=Vlad K. |last6=Foy |first6=Scott G. |last7=Masel |first7=Joanna |last8=Wysocki |first8=Vicki H. |last9=Cordes |first9=Matthew H.J. |title=Foldability of a Natural De Novo Evolved Protein |journal=Structure |date=November 2017 |volume=25 |issue=11 |pages=1687–1696.e4 |doi=10.1016/j.str.2017.09.006|pmid=29033289 |pmc=5677532 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. 
Of the tens of thousands of enzymes of primary or specialized metabolism that have been characterized to date, none are orphans, or even of restricted lineage; apparently, catalysis requires hundreds of millions of years of evolution.&lt;ref name="Zebulun W 2014"/&gt;

==Biological functions==
While the prevalence of orphan genes has been established, the evolutionary role of orphans, and its resulting importance, is still being debated. One theory is that many orphans have no evolutionary role; genomes contain non-functional open reading frames (ORFs) that create spurious polypeptide products not maintained by selection, meaning that they are unlikely to be conserved between species and would likely be detected as orphan genes.&lt;ref name="Khalturin" /&gt; However, a variety of other studies have shown that at least some orphans are functionally important and may help explain the emergence of novel phenotypes.&lt;ref name="Tautz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Khalturin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Foster, C. M. 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Donoghue" /&gt;

First used by Irish-American [[psychoanalytic]] psychiatrist [[Harry Stack Sullivan]] in the 1940s, '''Parataxical Integration''' (a combination of terms) refers to the mutual condition of [[parataxic distortion]]s (another concept of Sullivan’s). Parataxical integration exists when two people, usually intimate with each other (i.e. parents and children, spouses, romantic partners, business associates), are reciprocally reactive to each other’s seductions, judgmental inaccuracies, hostile comments, and manipulations or other "triggering" behaviors. One says or does something causing the other to react, setting off a cyclical "ping-pong", "tit-for-tat", "you-get-me-and-I-get-you-back" oscillation of verbal and/or behavioral reactions.

==Development==
The concept first appeared in Sullivan's ''The Interpersonal Theory of Psychiatry'', published in 1953. It was developed further by his protégé, [[Lorna Smith Benjamin]], in her ''Interpersonal Diagnosis and Treatment of Personality Disorders'' (1996). Benjamin saw parataxical integration as typical in the interpersonal behavior of couples with unresolved [[autonomy]] (i.e. separation, [[Personal boundaries|boundary]]) and identity issues. [[Erik Erikson]] had himself described the unconscious, reciprocal reactivation (without using Sullivan’s terms) in his essay, “The Problem of Ego Identity,” and in ''Identity and Anxiety'', by Stein ''et al''. (1960).

==Usage==
Though the term itself is not used in much of the professional peer-reviewed literature, the interpersonal manifestation to which it refers appears regularly in the case study literature of the "[[family systems]]" school of psychologists, including [[Don D. Jackson]], [[Jay Haley]], [[Gregory Bateson]], [[Virginia Satir]], and [[Salvador Minuchin]]. Parataxical integrations are also presented in similar studies reported by [[Ronald D. Laing]], [[Aaron Esterson]], and anthropologist [[Jules Henry]], largely during the 1950s and 1960s. [[Harold Searles]] and [[Charles McCormack]] describe manifestations of parataxical integration in their works on [[borderline personality disorder]]s in the 1980s and 2000s.

[[Paul Watzlawick]] ''et al''. describes the concept in his book, ''Change'', noting, "... the circularity of their interaction makes it undecidable ... whether a given action is the cause or effect of an action by the other party ... either party sees its actions as determined and provoked by the other's actions ...".

[[Rodger Garrett]] also employs the concept in his millennial-era work on borderline personality disorder and [[family of origin]] etiology, typically using the term “reciprocal reactivity” along with it.

[[Reciprocal reactivity]] was studied by Gary Sperduto ''et al''. in the 1970s, and it is clear from the abstract of his paper (see below) that his definitional terminology equated to that of Sullivan.

Numerous mass-market psychology authors, many writing about the topic of "[[codependence|co-dependence]]," including [[Melody Beattie]], [[Pia Mellody]], [[Anne Wilson Schaef]], and [[Barry &amp; Janae Weinhold]], describe the interpersonal manifestation without using Sullivan’s term ''per se''. Co-dependence expert [[Pia Mellody]] describes the behavioral manifestations of parataxical integration at length in an audio presentation available online.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8464">'''Peak signal-to-noise ratio''', often abbreviated '''PSNR''', is an engineering term for the ratio between the maximum possible power of a [[Signal (information theory)|signal]] and the power of corrupting [[noise]] that affects the fidelity of its representation. Because many signals have a very wide [[dynamic range]], PSNR is usually expressed in terms of the [[logarithm]]ic [[decibel]] scale.

== Definition ==
PSNR is most easily defined via the [[mean squared error]] (''MSE''). Given a noise-free ''m''×''n'' monochrome image ''I'' and its noisy approximation ''K'', ''MSE'' is defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathit{MSE} = \frac{1}{m\,n}\sum_{i=0}^{m-1}\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} [I(i,j) - K(i,j)]^2&lt;/math&gt;

The PSNR (in [[decibel|dB]]) is defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\mathit{PSNR} &amp;= 10 \cdot \log_{10} \left( \frac{\mathit{MAX}_I^2}{\mathit{MSE}} \right)\\ 
&amp;= 20 \cdot \log_{10} \left( \frac{\mathit{MAX}_I}{\sqrt{\mathit{MSE}}} \right)\\ 
&amp;= 20 \cdot \log_{10} \left( {\mathit{MAX}_I} \right) - 10 \cdot \log_{10} \left( {{\mathit{MSE}}} \right)\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Here, ''MAX&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the maximum possible pixel value of the image. When the pixels are represented using 8 bits per sample, this is 255. More generally, when samples are represented using linear [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] with ''B'' bits per sample, ''MAX&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;'' is 2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;var&gt;B&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;−1.

=== Application in color images ===
For [[color image]]s with three [[RGB]] values per pixel, the definition of PSNR is the same except the MSE is the sum over all squared value differences divided by image size and by three. Alternately, for color images the image is converted to a different [[color space]] and PSNR is reported against each channel of that color space, e.g., [[YCbCr]] or [[HSL and HSV|HSL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oriani|first=Emanuele|title=qpsnr: A quick PSNR/SSIM analyzer for Linux|url=http://qpsnr.youlink.org/|accessdate=6 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=pnmpsnr User Manual|url=http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/pnmpsnr.html|accessdate=6 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Quality estimation with PSNR ==
PSNR is most commonly used to measure the quality of reconstruction of lossy compression [[codec]]s (e.g., for [[image compression]]). The signal in this case is the original data, and the noise is the error introduced by compression. When comparing compression codecs, PSNR is an ''approximation'' to human perception of reconstruction quality.

Typical values for the PSNR in [[lossy compression|lossy]] image and video compression are between 30 and 50&amp;nbsp;dB, provided the bit depth is 8&amp;nbsp;[[bit]]s, where higher is better. For 16-bit data typical values for the PSNR are between 60 and 80&amp;nbsp;dB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Welstead|first=Stephen T.|title=Fractal and wavelet image compression techniques|year=1999|publisher=SPIE Publication|isbn=978-0-8194-3503-3|pages=155–156|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=evGyv-mogukC&amp;lpg=PA155&amp;dq=image%20compression%20acceptable%20PSNR&amp;pg=PA156#v=onepage&amp;q=image%20compression%20acceptable%20PSNR&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Raouf Hamzaoui, Dietmar Saupe|title=Fractal Image Compression|journal=Document and image compression|date=May 2006|volume=968|pages=168–169|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FmqPOsEYRsEC&amp;lpg=PA229&amp;dq=image%20compression%20acceptable%20PSNR&amp;pg=PA168#v=onepage&amp;q=PSNR&amp;f=false|accessdate=5 April 2011|editor1-first=Mauro|editor1-last=Barni|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9780849335563}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acceptable values for wireless transmission quality loss are considered to be about 20&amp;nbsp;dB to 25&amp;nbsp;dB.&lt;ref&gt;Thomos, N., Boulgouris, N.

In the absence of noise, the two images ''I'' and ''K'' are identical, and thus the MSE is zero. In this case the PSNR is infinite (or undefined, see [[Division by zero]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Salomon|first=David|title=Data Compression: The Complete Reference|year=2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1846286025|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ujnQogzx_2EC&amp;lpg=PA281&amp;ots=FolwqB8qsN&amp;dq=PSNR%20infinite&amp;pg=PA281#v=onepage&amp;q=PSNR%20infinite&amp;f=false|edition=4|accessdate=26 July 2012|page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Performance comparison ==
Although a higher PSNR generally indicates that the reconstruction is of higher quality, in some cases it may not. One has to be extremely careful with the range of validity of this metric; it is only conclusively valid when it is used to compare results from the same codec (or codec type) and same content.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Huynh-Thu|first1=Q.|last2=Ghanbari|first2=M.|year=2008|title=Scope of validity of PSNR in image/video quality assessment|journal=Electronics Letters|volume=44|issue=13|pages=800|doi=10.1049/el:20080522|pmc=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/xiphmont/Public/theora/demo7.html MIT.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Expert needed|Psychology|date=April 2009}}
[[Torture]] is the use of physical or psychological pain to control the victim or fulfill some needs of the perpetrator. The psychology of torture refers to the psychological processes underlying all aspects of torture including the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim, the immediate and long-term effects, and the political and social institutions that influence its use.

==The perpetrator of torture==
Research during the past 60 years, starting with the [[Milgram experiment]], suggests that under the right circumstances, and with the appropriate encouragement and setting, most people can be encouraged to actively torture others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7791278.stm |title=BBC NEWS &amp;#124; Health &amp;#124; People 'still willing to torture' |format= |work= BBC News| date=2008-12-19 | accessdate=2010-03-24 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Conroy:'''&lt;blockquote&gt;"When torture takes place, people believe they are on the high moral ground, that the nation is under threat and they are the front line protecting the nation, and people will be grateful for what they are doing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A15861-2004May10.html| title=The Psychology of Torture | work=The Washington Post| author=Shankar Vedantam| date= May 11, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Stages of the perpetrator's torture mentality include:&lt;br /&gt;
(Please note that not all perpetrators go through all of the stages listed)&lt;br /&gt;

* Reluctance:  The perpetrator is reluctant to participate or observe the administration of torture.
* Official encouragement: As the [[Stanford prison experiment]] and [[Milgram experiment]] show, in an official setting, many people will follow the direction of an authority figure (such as a superior officer) particularly if it is presented as mandatory, even if they have personal uncertainty. The main motivations for this appear to be a fear of loss of status or respect, and the desire to be seen as a "good citizen" or "good subordinate".
* Peer encouragement: The perpetrator begins to accept torture as necessary, acceptable or deserved, or to comply due to the need to conform to peer group beliefs.
* [[Dehumanization]]: The perpetrator sees victims as objects of curiosity and experimentation rather than as human beings.  The physical and psychological manipulations become just another opportunity to test the victim's response.
* [[Disinhibition]]: Sociocultural and [[situational]] pressures may cause perpetrators to undergo a lessening of moral inhibitions and as a result act in ways not normally accepted by law, custom and conscience.
* Self-perpetuating:  Within the organization, once torture becomes established as part of internally acceptable norms under certain circumstances, its use often becomes institutionalized and self-perpetuating over time.  What was once rarely used during extreme circumstances begins to be used more regularly with more reasons claimed to justify wider use.

Example:&lt;br /&gt;
  
One of the apparent ringleaders of the [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|Abu Ghraib prison torture]], [[Charles Graner]] Jr., exemplified the stages of dehumanization and disinhibition when he was reported to have said, "The Christian in me says it's wrong, but the corrections officer in me says, 'I love to make a grown man piss himself.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2004/121/12.0.html|title=The Religious Side of the Abu Ghraib Scandal|work=Christianity Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As P. Saliya Sumanatilake concludes:&lt;br /&gt;

"Whether it be for securing a justifiable or reprehensible end, torture cannot be effectuated without invoking and focusing one's diffused innate cruelty. Accordingly, it is the prevalence of this congenital trait of heinousness that renders every human being a potential torturer: hence, the existence of torture! Moreover, it is the natural occurrence of such nascent evil within each successive generation of human beings that serves to propagate torture!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Why Do They Torture? A Study On Man's Cruelty|last = Sumanatilake|first = P. Saliya|publisher = Stamford Lake (Pvt.) Ltd.|year = 2015|isbn = 978-955-658-406-6|location = Colombo, Sri Lanka|pages = 331–332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological effects of torture==

The effects of torture on the victim and the perpetrator are likely to be influenced by many factors.  Therefore, it is unlikely that providing diagnostic categories of symptoms and behavior will be applicable across countries with very different personal, political or religious beliefs and perspectives. There is always a question about applying diagnostic categories and descriptions of symptoms or behavior developed in Western societies to people from the developing countries with very different personal, political, or religious beliefs and perspectives. One of the most marked cultural differences may occur between [[individualism|individualist]] societies where realization of personal goals often takes priority over the needs of kin and societal expectations, and [[collectivism|collectivist]] societies in which the needs of family and prescribed roles take precedence over personal preferences. Another evident difference is the belief in a subsequent life in which suffering in this life is rewarded, and this has emerged in some studies of torture survivors in South East Asia.&lt;br /&gt;

=== Victims ===
Torture has profound and long-lasting physical and psychological effects. Torture is a form of collective suffering that is not limited to the victim. The victims' family members and friends are often also affected due to adjustment problems such as outbreaks of anger and violence directed towards family members.  According to research, psychological and physical torture have similar mental effects. Often torture victims suffer from elevated rates of the following:
*[[anxiety]]
*[[Depression (mood)|depression]]
*[[adjustment disorder]]
*[[Post-traumatic stress disorder|posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)]]
*disorders of extreme stress not otherwise specified (DESNOS)
*[[somatic symptom disorder|somatoform disorders]]
*[[nightmare]]s
*intrusion
*[[insomnia]]
*[[libido|decreased libido]]
*memory lapses
*reduced capacity to learn
*sexual dysfunction
*social withdrawal
*emotional flatness
*[[headache]]s

No diagnostic terminology encapsulates the deep distrust of others which many torture survivors have developed, nor the destruction of all that gave their lives meaning. Guilt and shame about humiliation during torture, and about the survivor's inability to withstand it, as well as guilt at surviving, are common problems which discourage disclosure.  Additional stress may be added due to uncertainty about the future, any possibility of being sent back to the country in which the survivor was tortured, and the potential lack of close confidants or social support systems.  In addition, the presence of social isolation, poverty, unemployment, institutional accommodation, and pain can all predict higher levels of emotional distress in victims who survive torture.&lt;ref name="bjp.sagepub.com"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/2049463713483596|title=The psychological impact of torture|first1=Amanda C|last1=de C Williams|first2=Jannie|last2=van der Merwe|date=1 May 2013|publisher=|journal=British Journal of Pain|volume=7|issue=2|pages=101–106|via=SAGE Journals|doi=10.1177/2049463713483596|pmc=4590125|pmid=26516507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Victims with PTSD ===
The development of the diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) for American veterans of the Vietnam War can be understood as a political act which labeled the collective distress of a defeated USA as individual psychopathology. Proponents of this view, point to the de-politicization of the distress of torture survivors by describing their distress, disturbance, and profound sense of injustice in psychiatric terms. These are not only conceptual issues, because they may influence treatment outcomes.  Recovery is associated with reconstruction of social and cultural networks, economic supports, and respect for human rights.

The rich research on treatment of PTSDs in veterans has substantially informed treatment offered to torture survivors. It is more appropriate than extrapolation from work with civilian survivors of single events as individuals (assault, accidents) or as communities or groups (natural or man-made disasters). Some literature distinguishes between single-event trauma (type 1) and prolonged and repeated trauma, such as torture (type 2). There is no doubt that (disregarding concerns about the diagnosis) rates of PTSD are much higher in refugees than among people of a similar age in the countries where the refugees settle, and that, among refugees, rates of PTSD are even higher among those seeking asylum.

The argument that torture causes unique problems waxes and wanes, and is often associated with claims to particular expertise in treatment, and therefore claims on funding.   Gurr et al. describe how torture targets the person as a whole – physically, emotionally, and socially – so that PTSD is an inadequate description of the magnitude and complexity of the effects of torture. When the diagnosis of PTSD is applied, some survivors of torture who have very severe symptoms related to trauma may still not reach the criteria for diagnosis. Categories such as 'complex trauma' have been proposed, and it may be that the next iterations of the diagnostic compendia may modify the criteria

=== Perpetrator ===
Many people who engage in torture have various psychological deviations and often they derive sadistic satisfaction.  Torture may fulfill the emotional needs of perpetrators when they willingly engage in these activities. They lack empathy and their victims' agonized painful reactions, screaming and pleading give them a sense of authority and feelings of superiority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.srilankaguardian.org/2010/02/psychological-effects-of-torture.html | title=Psychological effects of torture | publisher=Sri Lanka Guardian | date=2010 | accessdate=11 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Torture can harm not only the victim but the perpetrators as well. After the fact, perpetrators will often experience failing mental health, PTSD, suicidal tendencies, substance dependency and a myriad of other mental defects associated with inducing physical or mental trauma upon their victims.

The perpetrators may experience flashbacks of torture, intense rage, suicidal and homicidal ideas, alienation, impulse deregulation, alterations in attention and consciousness, alterations in self-perception, alterations in relationships with others, inability to trust and inability to maintain long-term relationships, or even mere intimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groundviews.org/2010/04/15/psychological-effects-of-torture/|title=Psychological effects of Torture|date=15 April 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Torture victims in healthcare settings===

For physicians, it is useful to recognize that symptoms of post-traumatic stress can complicate presentation and treatment. Pain predicts greater severity of both PTSD symptoms and major depression, and intrusive memories and flashbacks can exacerbate existing pain.&lt;ref name = Williams&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://bjp.sagepub.com/content/7/2/101.full.pdf+html | title=The psychological impact of torture | author=Amanda C de C Williams and Jannie van der Merwe | journal=British Journal of Pain | year=2013 | volume=7 | issue=2 | pages=101–106 | doi=10.1177/2049463713483596| pmc=4590125 | pmid=26516507}}&lt;/ref&gt; While under-recognition and under-treatment of torture victims is common, there are useful guidelines for evidence-based medical practice, although not specifically concerned with pain, and for evidence-based psychological practice.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Some people die during torture; many survivors are too disabled and destitute to find their way to safety. A large element of chance, and, to a lesser extent, resources and resilience, enable a minority to arrive in developed countries. Nevertheless, they often present multiple and complex problems, which the clinician can find overwhelming. For all these reasons, an interdisciplinary approach to assessment and treatment is therefore recommended, guarding against either disregarding significant psychological distress as inevitable in torture survivors or discounting physical symptoms by attributing them to psychological origin.

Rehabilitation and reparation are part of the rights of the torture survivor under the United Nations Convention, yet far less attention is paid to health needs on a national or international basis than to legal and civil claims. Collaborative efforts involving survivors themselves are needed to better understand the usefulness and limitations of existing assessment instruments and treatment methods. Some studies exist, such as that by Elsass et al. who interviewed Tibetan Lamas on the quantification of suffering in scales used to evaluate intervention with Tibetan torture survivors.
Education of medical and other healthcare personnel needs to address issues concerning treatment of torture survivors, who will be seen in all possible settings but not necessarily recognized or treated adequately. Teaching on ethics is also important, since medical students can have tolerant views of torture, and the complicity of medical and healthcare staff in torture continues in many countries. Medical staff are often in a key position to try to prevent torture and to help those who have survived.&lt;ref name="bjp.sagepub.com"/&gt;

== The psychologist's role in torture ==
In addition to providing treatment for victims of torture, psychologists have the skills and knowledge to conduct research regarding interrogation methods and determine when the methods used become torture.  The standards, policies, and procedures of each country's professional psychological association may influence the participation of psychologists in administering torture, researching torture methods, and evaluating the effectiveness of the results.  Kenneth Pope (2011) used direct quotes to indicate the American Psychological Association believes psychologists have a key role in eliciting information from people since interrogations require an understanding of psychological processes.  Each professional association sets the standards for ethics and expected professional behavior which may influence psychologist researchers who investigate interrogation or torture and clinical psychologists' participation in interrogations that use methods deemed to be consistent with torture.

For an example of policy that influences the use of torture by American psychologists, please see the [http://www.apa.org/about/policy/national-security.aspx American Psychological Association Council of Representatives policy released in 2015].  For an example of an external review of whether psychologists adhered to the APA ethics and policy please see the [http://www.apa.org/about/policy/national-security.aspx Hoffman Report (2015)].

Due to differences in political power globally, professional psychological organizations in well-developed countries may have a greater influence on discovering and defining what constitutes torture.&lt;ref name="Moghaddam"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moghaddam|first1=F|title=Interrogation policy and American psychology in the global context.|journal=Peace and Conflict: Journal of Peace Psychology|date=2007|volume=13|issue=4|pages=437–443|doi=10.1080/10781910701665782}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological associations in less developed countries may choose to adopt the definitions, standards, and ethical positions regarding torture developed by the APA when they are unable to support research regarding torture themselves within their own culture.&lt;ref name="Moghaddam"/&gt; The professional associations in well developed countries, such as the APA are likely to have a strong influence in defining the psychology of torture globally.&lt;ref name="Moghaddam"/&gt;

==The influence of social systems on torture==
People within an organization may be influenced to participate in torturing people.&lt;ref name="Annas"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Annas|first1=G. J.|last2=Crosby|first2=S. S.|title=Post-9/11 torture at CIA "Black Sites" - Physicians and lawyers working together.|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=2015|volume=372|issue=24|pages=2279–2281|doi=10.1056/nejmp1503428}}&lt;/ref&gt; The culture and procedures of an organization provide the foundation to allow professionals, such as physicians, to violate the medical code of ethics in a manner that appears to align and meet the necessary standards of their employment.  Annas and Crosby (2015) reported that lawyers provided advanced confirmation that physicians who participated in the enhanced interrogation techniques used at CIA sites would be given immunity for their actions since they were deemed a necessary requirement to protect the country (see also; [[Milgram experiment]] ) .  

The physicians assisted by providing medical evaluations to ensure victims were healthy enough to undergo torture, developed methods of torture, ensured victims would survive the torture, and assisted victims to heal following torture procedures.  Working in a secret facility with policies and procedures that promoted an expectation that torture and enhanced interrogation practices were required to protect the nation and would not result in negative personal consequences resulted in a setting in which physicians were willing to ignore the [[Hippocratic oath]].&lt;ref name="Annas" /&gt;

The policies and procedures within the United States military have also been found to produce an environment in which torture and enhanced interrogation techniques were used.&lt;ref name="Arrigo"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arrigo|first1=J. M.|last2=Bennett|first2=R.|title=Organizational supports for abusive interrogations in the "War on Terror."|journal=Peace and Conflict: Journal of Peace Psychology|date=2007|volume=13|issue=4|pages=411–421|doi=10.1080/10781910701665592}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the military has an excellent process for recruiting and training interrogators who use non abusive techniques successfully, changes in funding resulted in fewer highly trained interrogators being available.  As more interrogators were recruited after [[9/11]], they were not as rigorously assessed, trained, or mentored and did not demonstrate the same abilities as the previous generation of military interrogators.  In addition, the military rank of interrogators is not sufficient to control the decisions made when interrogation is needed.  Military interrogators may be ordered to perform techniques they know to be inappropriate and ineffective by higher ranking officers who have not been adequately educated about effective interrogation procedures.  The combination of a change in recruitment, reduced education and mentorship, and relatively low rank result in opportunities for torture and abuse to be used during interrogations.&lt;ref name="Arrigo" /&gt;

==How public beliefs influence the use of torture==
Fictional stories, movies, and television shows may influence the beliefs people have regarding the efficacy of torture as a means for rapidly obtaining life-saving information.&lt;ref name="Ames"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ames|first1=D. R.|last2=Lee|first2=A. J.|title=Tortured beliefs:  how and when prior support for torture skews the perceived value of coerced information.|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|date=2015|volume=60|pages=86–92.|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2015.05.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="O'Mara"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Mara|first1=S|title=On the imposition of torture, an extreme stressor state, to extract information from memory:  a baleful consequence of folk cognitive neurobiology.|journal=Journal of Psychology|date=2011|volume=219|issue=3|pages=159–166|doi=10.1027/2151-2604/a000063}}&lt;/ref&gt;  People who believe torture is an effective interrogation method are more supportive of using torture and enhanced interrogation techniques than those who do not think it provides accurate information.&lt;ref name="Ames" /&gt;  In addition, the information obtained through torture is also perceived as more valuable by people who support using torture than the same information obtained through non-abusive means of interrogation.  These findings suggest confirmation bias (perception is skewed toward what a person already believes) influences the support for torture and is influenced by many commercially available sources of fictional examples.&lt;ref name="Ames" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jannoff"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Janoff-Bulman|first1=R|title=Erroneous assumptions:  Popular belief in the effectiveness of torture interrogation.|journal=Peace and Conflict: Journal of Peace Psychology|date=2007|volume=13|issue=4|pages=429–435|doi=10.1080/10781910701665766}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Recognition''' in [[sociology]] is public acknowledgement of person's [[Social status|status]] or [[:wikt:merit|merit]]s (achievements, [[virtue]]s, service, etc.). In the field of psychology, it is understood that a person who seeks excessive recognition could themselves be exhibiting traits of a narcissistic personality disorder.

When some person is recognized, he or she is accorded some special status, such as title or classification.

A '''relaxation technique''' (also known as '''relaxation training''') is any method, process, procedure, or activity that helps a person to relax; to attain a state of increased [[calmness]]; or otherwise reduce levels of [[pain]], [[anxiety]], [[Stress (biology)|stress]] or [[anger]].  Relaxation techniques are often employed as one element of a wider [[stress management]] program and can decrease muscle tension, lower the blood pressure and slow heart and breath rates, among other health benefits.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9A0DE5D81E3AF930A25756C0A960948260# |title= Relaxation: Surprising benefits detected |first= Daniel |last= Goleman |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |date= May 13, 1986 |accessdate= May 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People respond to stress in different ways, namely, by becoming overwhelmed, [[Depression (mood)|depressed]] or both.&lt;ref name="helpguide"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://helpguide.org/mental/stress_relief_meditation_yoga_relaxation.htm |title= Relaxation Techniques for Stress Relief |first1= Lawrence |last1= Robinson |first2= Robert |last2= Segal |first3= Jeanne |last3= Segal |first4= Melinda |last4= Smith |website= helpguide.org |date= August 2011 |accessdate= December 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yoga]], [[QiGong]], [[Taiji]], and [[Pranayama]] that includes deep breathing tend to calm people who are overwhelmed by stress, while rhythmic exercise improves the mental and physical health of those who are depressed. People who encounter both symptoms simultaneously, feeling depressed in some ways and overexcited in others, may do best by walking or performing yoga techniques that are focused on strength.&lt;ref name=helpguide /&gt;

==Background==

Research has indicated that removing stress helps to increase a person's health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/exercise-and-stress/SR00036 |title= Exercise and stress: Get moving to combat stress |author= [[Mayo Clinic]] Staff |date= July 21, 2012 |website= mayoclinic.com |publisher= Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research released in the 1980s indicated stronger ties between stress and health and showed benefits from a wider range of relaxation techniques than had been previously known.  This research received national media attention, including a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article in 1986.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;

==Uses==
People use relaxation techniques for the following reasons, among others:
{{colbegin}}
* [[Anger management]]
* [[Anxiety attack]]s
* [[Cardiac]] health
* [[Hypnotherapy in childbirth|Childbirth]]
* [[Depression (mood)|Depression]]
* General [[quality of life|well-being]]

* [[High blood pressure]]
* Preparation for [[hypnosis]]
* [[Immune system]] support
* [[Insomnia]]
* [[Pain management]]
* [[Relaxation (psychology)]]
* [[Stress management]]
* [[Addiction|Addiction treatment]]
*[[Nightmare disorder]]
{{colend}}

==Techniques==

Various techniques are used by individuals to improve their state of relaxation.  Some of the methods are performed alone; some require the help of another person (often a trained professional); some involve movement, some focus on stillness; while other methods involve different elements.

Certain relaxation techniques known as "formal and passive relaxation exercises" are generally performed while sitting or lying quietly, with minimal movement and involve "a degree of withdrawal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Smith |first= Jonathan C. |chapter= Ch. 3: The Psychology of Relaxation |title= Principles and Practice of Stress Management |edition= 3rd |editor1-last= Lehrer |editor1-first= Paul M. |editor2-first= Robert L. |editor2-last= Woolfolk |editor3-first= Wesley E. |editor3-last= Sime |year= 2007|isbn= 9781606238288 |page= [https://books.google.com/books?id=T-hUvwUNjvUC&amp;pg=PA38 38] |ref= {{SfnRef|Leher, Woolfolk &amp; Sime (eds.)|2007}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include:
*[[Autogenic training]]
*[[Biofeedback]]
*[[Deep breathing]]
*[[Meditation]]
*Mindbody relaxation
*[[Pranayama]]
*[[Progressive muscle relaxation]]
*[[Qigong]]
*[[Self-hypnosis]]
*[[Transcendental Meditation technique]] 
*[[Mental image|Visualization]]
*[[Yoga Nidra]]
*[[Zen Yoga]]

Movement-based relaxation methods incorporate [[Physical exercise|exercise]] such as [[walking]], [[gardening]], [[yoga]], [[T'ai chi ch'uan|T'ai chi]], [[Qigong]], and more.  Some forms of [[bodywork (alternative medicine)|bodywork]] are helpful in promoting a state of increased relaxation. Examples include [[massage]], [[acupuncture]], the [[Feldenkrais Method]], [[myotherapy]], [[reflexology]] and [[Self-control|self-regulation]].

Some relaxation methods can also be used during other activities, for example,  [[autosuggestion]] and [[prayer]]. At least one study has suggested that listening to certain types of music, particularly [[new-age music]] and [[classical music]], can increase feelings associated with relaxation, such as peacefulness and a sense of ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Smith |first= Jonathan C. |chapter= Ch. 3: The Psychology of Relaxation |title= Principles and Practice of Stress Management |edition= 3rd |editor1-last= Lehrer |editor1-first= Paul M. |editor2-first= Robert L. |editor2-last= Woolfolk |editor3-first= Wesley E. |editor3-last= Sime |year= 2007|isbn= 9781606238288 |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=T-hUvwUNjvUC&amp;pg=PA46 46–7] |ref= {{SfnRef|Leher, Woolfolk &amp; Sime (eds.)|2007}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A technique growing in popularity is [[isolation tank|flotation therapy]], which is the use of a float tank in which a solution of [[Magnesium sulfate|Epsom salt]] is kept at skin temperature to provide effortless floating.  Research in USA and Sweden has demonstrated a powerful and profound relaxation after twenty minutes.  In some cases, floating may reduce pain and stress and has been shown to release [[endorphins]].

Even actions as simple as a walk in the park have been shown to aid feelings of relaxation, regardless of the initial reason for the visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Irvine |first1= KN |last2= Warber |first2= SL |last3= Devine-Wright |first3= P |last4= Gaston |first4= K |title= Understanding urban green space as a health resource: A qualitative comparison of visit motivation and derived effects among park users in Sheffield, UK |journal= International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health |volume= 10 |issue= 1 |pages= 417–42 |year= 2013 |doi= 10.3390/ijerph10010417 |url= http://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/10/1/417 |pmid= 23340602 |pmc= 3564151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5446">The '''scalar timing''' or '''scalar expectancy theory''' ('''SET''') is a model of the processes that govern behavior controlled by time. The model posits an internal [[clock]], and particular [[memory]] and [[Decision making|decision]] processes.&lt;ref name=gibbon&gt;Gibbon, J.  (1977).  Scalar expectancy theory and Weber’s law in animal timing. ''Psychological Review''. 84(3), 279-325&lt;/ref&gt; SET is one of the most important models of [[animal]] timing behavior.&lt;ref name="Beckmann2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joshua S. Beckmann|title=The Effects of Stimulus Dynamics on Temporal Discrimination: Implications for Change and Internal Clock Models of Timing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yDzefBYmrxcC&amp;pg=PA5|accessdate=11 January 2013|year=2007|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=978-0-549-22213-2|pages=5–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
John Gibbon originally proposed SET to explain the temporally controlled behavior of non-human subjects.&lt;ref name=gibbon /&gt; He initially used the model to account for a pattern of behavior seen in animals that are being reinforced at fixed-intervals, for example every 2 minutes. &lt;ref name="Magaro2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Michael Magaro|title=Dissociating Clock Speed and Attention in the Modality Effect|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g3aDgdkSx_IC&amp;pg=PA7|accessdate=11 January 2013|year=2008|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=978-0-549-47717-4|pages=7–}}&lt;/ref&gt; An animal that is well trained on such a fixed-interval schedule pauses after each reinforcement and then suddenly starts responding about two-thirds of the way through the new interval. (See [[operant conditioning]]) The model explains how the animal's behavior is controlled by time in this manner. &lt;ref name=gibbon /&gt; Gibbon and others later elaborated the model and applied it to a variety of other timing phenomena.

==Summary of the model==
SET assumes that the animal has a clock, a working memory, a reference memory, and a decision process.  The clock contains a discrete pacemaker that generates pulses like the ticks a mechanical clock. A stimulus that signals the start of a timed interval closes a switch, allowing pulses to enter an accumulator. The resulting accumulation of pulses represents elapsed time, and this time value is continuously sent to a working memory. When reinforcement happens at the end of the timed interval, the time value is stored in a long-term reference memory.  This time-to-reinforcement in reference memory represents the expected time to reinforcement.

Key to the SET model is the decision process that controls timing behavior. While the animal is timing some interval it continually compares the current time (stored in working memory) to the expected time (stored in reference memory). Specifically, the animal continually samples from its memory of past times at which reinforcement occurred and compares this memory sample with the current time on its clock. When the two values are close to one another the animal responds; when they are far enough apart, the animal stops responding. To make this comparison, it computes the ratio of the two values; when the ratio is less than a certain value it responds, when the ratio is larger it does not respond.

By using a ratio of current time to expected time, rather than, for example, simply subtracting one from the other, SET accounts for a key observation about animal and human timing. That is, timing accuracy is relative to the size of the interval being timed. This is the "scalar" property that gives the model its name. For example, when timing a 10 sec interval an animal might be accurate to within 1 sec, whereas when timing a 100 sec interval the animal would be accurate to only about 10 sec. Thus time perception is like the perception of lights, sounds, and other sensory events, where accuracy also is relative to the size (brightness, loudness, etc.) of the percept being judged. (See [[Weber-Fechner law]].)

A number of alternative models of timing have appeared over the years.  These include Killeen’s Behavioral Theory of timing (BeT) model&lt;ref&gt;Killeen, P. R. (1991). Behavior’s time. In G. Bower (Ed.),''The psychology of learning and motivation'' (Vol. 27, pp. 294–334). New York: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt; and Machado’s learning-to-time (LeT) model.&lt;ref&gt;Machado, A., &amp; Pata, P. (2005). Testing the Scalar Expectancy Theory (SET) and the Learning to Time model (LeT) in a double bisection task. ''Behavior and Learning'', 33, 111-122.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human mechanism==
In 1993, John Wearden claimed that human behavior exhibits appropriate scalar properties, as was indicated by experiments on internal production with concurrent chronometric counting.&lt;ref name="PastorArtieda1996"&gt;{{cite book|author1=M.A. Pastor|author2=J. Artieda|title=Time, Internal Clocks and Movement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ti3HXG_0OdIC&amp;pg=PA148|accessdate=11 January 2013|date=10 June 1996|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-054304-8|pages=148–}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, human timing behavior is undoubtedly more varied than animal timing behavior. A major factor responsible for this variability is attentional allocation.&lt;ref name="PastorArtieda1996" /&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Hallez, Q., &amp; Droit-Volet, S. (2017). High levels of time contraction in young children in dual tasks are related to their limited attention capacities. ''Journal of Experimental Child Psychology'', 161, 148-160.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Starlight''' is a software product originally developed at [[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory]] and now by Future Point Systems. It is an advanced [[Visual analytics|visual analysis]] environment. In addition to using [[information visualization]] to show the importance of individual pieces of data by showing how they relate to one another, it also contains a small suite of tools useful for collaboration and data sharing, as well as data conversion, processing, augmentation and loading.

The software, originally developed for the [[United States Intelligence Community|intelligence community]], allows users to load data from XML files, databases, RSS feeds, web services, HTML files, Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, Excel, CSV, Adobe PDF, TXT files, etc. and analyze it with a variety of visualizations and tools. The system integrates structured, unstructured, geospatial, and multimedia data, offering comparisons of information at multiple levels of abstraction, simultaneously and in near real-time. In addition Starlight allows users to build their own named entity-extractors using a combination of algorithms, targeted normalization lists and regular expressions in the Starlight Data Engineer (SDE).

As an example, Starlight might be used to look for correlations in a database containing records about chemical spills. An analyst could begin by grouping records according to the cause of the spill to reveal general trends. Sorting the data a second time, they could apply different colors based on related details such as the company responsible, age of equipment or geographic location. Maps and photographs could be integrated into the display, making it even easier to recognize connections among multiple variables.

Starlight has been deployed to both the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and used on a number of large-scale projects.

PNNL began developing Starlight in the mid-90's, with funding from the Land Information Warfare Agency,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurekalert.org/features/doe/2002-03/dnnl-ias061402.php Information analysis—by Starlight]&lt;/ref&gt; a part of the Army Intelligence and Security Command and continued developed at the laboratory with funding from the NSA and the CIA. Starlight integrates visual representations of reports, radio transcripts, radar signals, maps and other information. The software system was recently honored with an R&amp;D 100 Award&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rdmag.com/ShowPR.aspx?PUBCODE=014&amp;ACCT=1400000100&amp;ISSUE=0309&amp;RELTYPE=PR&amp;ORIGRELTYPE=FE&amp;PRODCODE=00000000&amp;PRODLETT=AE&amp;CommonCount=0 R&amp;D 100 Awards]&lt;/ref&gt; for technical innovation.

In 2006 Future Point Systems, a Silicon Valley startup, acquired rights to jointly develop and distribute the Starlight product in cooperation with the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.

The software is now also used outside of the military/intelligence communities in a number of commercial environments.

{{Libertarianism sidebar}}
'''''The God of the Machine''''' is a book written by [[Isabel Paterson]] and published in 1943 in the [[United States]]. At the time of its release, it was considered a cornerstone to the philosophy of [[individualism]]. Her biographer, [[Stephen D. Cox]], in 2004 described Paterson as the "earliest progenitor of [[libertarianism]] as we know it today".

==Background==
Isabel Paterson wrote a regular column for the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', where she first articulated many of her beliefs, which reached their final form in ''The God of the Machine''. She also foreshadowed those ideas, especially free trade, in her historical novels during the 1920s and 1930s.

Paterson opposed most parts of the economic program, known as the [[New Deal]], which US president [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and the [[United States Congress|Congress]] put into effect during the 1930s, and she advocated less governmental involvement in social and [[finance|fiscal]] matters. She also led a group of younger friends (many of whom were other employees of the ''Herald Tribune'') who shared her views. One member of that group was the young [[Ayn Rand]].

Paterson and Rand promoted each other's books, and they conducted an extensive exchange of letters, touching on religion and philosophy. That correspondence ended with a personal quarrel in 1948. Rand, an [[atheist]], was critical of the attempts of Paterson, a [[Deism|deist]], to link [[capitalism]] with religion, things that Rand considered incompatible.

In the context of the feminist movement of the 1960s and 1970s, it was a challenge to the [[nuclear family]] and [[family values]].&lt;ref name="Harutyunyan2009p50"&gt;Angela Harutyunyan, Kathrin Hörschelmann, Malcolm Miles (2009) ''Public Spheres After Socialism'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=4tSjNwjax4YC&amp;pg=PA50 pp. 50–1.]&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase has been repeatedly described as a defining characterization of second-wave feminism, [[radical feminism]], [[women's studies]], or feminism in general.&lt;ref&gt;"The great thrust of radical feminist writing has been directed to the documentation of the slogan 'the personal is political.'" {{Cite book | publisher = Routledge | last = McCann | first = Carole |author2=Seung-Kyung Kim  | title = Feminist theory reader: Local and global perspectives | location = London | date = 2013 | page =191}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"At the heart of Women's Studies and framing the perspective from which it proceeds was the critical insight that 'the personal is political.'" {{Cite book | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | isbn = 9780230605794 | last = Ginsberg | first = Alice E | title = The evolution of American women's studies: reflections on triumphs, controversies, and change | location = New York | date = 2008 | page = 69 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase was popularized by the publication of a 1969 essay by feminist [[Carol Hanisch]] under the title "The Personal is Political" in 1970,&lt;ref name="Smith2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Dale M.|title=Poets Beyond the Barricade: Rhetoric, Citizenship, and Dissent after 1960|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yUNq2Ni019wC&amp;pg=PA153|accessdate=August 1, 2012|date=2012-01-15|publisher=University of Alabama Press|isbn=9780817317492|pages=153–}}&lt;/ref&gt; but she disavows authorship of the phrase. According to Kerry Burch, [[Shulamith Firestone]], [[Robin Morgan]], and other feminists given credit for originating the phrase have also declined authorship. "Instead," Burch writes, "they cite millions of women in public and private conversations as the phrase's collective authors."&lt;ref name=Burch139&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Continuum | isbn = 9781441112132 | last = Burch | first = Kerry T. | title = Democratic transformations: Eight conflicts in the negotiation of American identity | location = London | date = 2012 | page = 139 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gloria Steinem]] has likened claiming authorship of the phrase to claiming authorship of "World War II."&lt;ref name=Burch139 /&gt;

The phrase figured in women-of-color feminism, such as "A Black Feminist Statement" by the [[Combahee River Collective]], [[Audre Lorde]]'s essay "The Master's Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master's House", and the anthology ''[[This Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of Color]]'', edited by [[Gloria E. Anzaldúa]] and [[Cherríe Moraga]]. More broadly, as [[Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw]] observes: "This process of recognizing as social and systemic what was formerly perceived as isolated and individual has also characterized the [[identity politics]] of African Americans, other people of color, and gays and lesbians, among others."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/1229039 | issn = 0038-9765 | volume = 43 | issue = 6 | pages = 1241–1299 | last = Crenshaw | first = Kimberle | title = Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics, and Violence against Women of Color | journal = Stanford Law Review | date = 1991-07-01 | jstor = 1229039 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Carol Hanisch essay==
[[File:Notes_from_the_Second_Year_cover,_New_York_Radical_Women.jpg|thumb|right|The essay first appeared under the title "The Personal is Political" in ''Notes from the Second Year: Women's Liberation'' (1970).]]
Carol Hanisch, a member of [[New York Radical Women]] and a prominent figure in the [[Women's Liberation Movement]], drafted an article defending the political importance of [[consciousness-raising groups]] in February 1969 in Gainesville, Florida.&lt;ref name=Hanisch2006&gt;{{Cite web | last = Hanisch | first = Carol | title = The Personal Is Political: The Women's Liberation Movement classic with a new explanatory introduction | accessdate = 2014-09-07 | date = January 2006| url = http://www.carolhanisch.org/CHwritings/PIP.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally addressed to the women's caucus of the Southern Conference Educational Fund, the paper was first given the title, "Some Thoughts in Response to Dottie [Zellner]'s Thoughts on a Women's Liberation Movement". Hanisch was then a New York City-based staffer of the Fund and was advocating for it to engage in dedicated organizing for women's liberation in the American South.&lt;ref name=Hanisch2006 /&gt; Hanisch sought to rebut the idea that sex, appearance, abortion, childcare, and the division of household labor were merely personal issues without political importance. To confront these and other issues, she urged women to overcome self-blame, discuss their situations amongst each other, and organize collectively against male domination of society.&lt;ref name=Hanisch2006 /&gt; Hanisch does not use the phrase "the personal is political" in the essay, but writes:
:One of the first things we discover in these groups is that personal problems are political problems. There are no personal solutions at this time. There is only collective action for a collective solution.&lt;ref name=Hanisch2006 /&gt;
The essay was published under the title, "The Personal Is Political", in ''Notes from the Second Year: Women's Liberation'' in 1970. The essay's author believes that [[Shulamith Firestone]] and [[Anne Koedt]], the book's editors, gave the essay its famous title.&lt;ref name=Hanisch2006 /&gt; It has since been reprinted in ''Radical Feminism: A Documentary Reader''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = NYU Press | isbn = 0814715559 | others = Barbara A. Crow (ed.) | title = Radical feminism: A documentary reader | location = New York | date = 2000 | pages = 113–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multiple meanings==
While the connection between women's personal experience and their subordination as women is highlighted by this phrase, feminists have interpreted the nature of that connection and the desired form of political action that emerges from it in widely divergent ways.

* An opening of "private" or "social" matters to political analysis and discussion.
* An explanation of the systematic nature of women's oppression. As summarized by Heidi Hartmann, "Women's discontent, radical feminists argued, is not the neurotic lament of the maladjusted, but a response to a social structure in which women are systematically dominated, exploited, and oppressed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Routledge | isbn = 9780415917612 | editors = Linda J. Nicholson (ed.) | last = Hartmann | first = Heidi | title = The Second Wave: A Reader in Feminist Theory | chapter = The unhappy marriage of Marxism and feminism: Towards a more progressive union | location = New York | date = 1997 | page = 100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paula Rust compiled a list of interpretations of the phrase within feminist movements including the following: "The personal reflects the political status quo (with the implication that the personal should be examined to provide insight into the political); the personal serves the political status quo; one can make personal choices in response to or protest against the political status quo; ... one's personal choices reveal or reflect one's personal politics; one should make personal choices that are consistent with one's personal politics; personal life and personal politics are indistinguishable."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = New York University Press | isbn =  9780814774441  | last = Rust | first = Paula C. | title = Bisexuality and the challenge to lesbian politics: Sex, loyalty, and revolution | location = New York | date = 1995 | page=329n21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 2006, Hanisch observed, "Like most of the theory created by the [[Redstockings#Ideology|Pro-Woman Line radical feminists]], these ideas have been revised or ripped off or even stood on their head and used against their original, radical intent."&lt;ref name=Hanisch2006 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8306">'''Transpartisanship''' represents an emerging school of political thought which accepts the validity of truths across a range of political perspectives and seeks to synthesize them into an inclusive, pragmatic container beyond typical political dualities.  It is distinct from [[bipartisanship]], which aims to negotiate between “right” and “left,” resulting in a dualistic perspective, and [[nonpartisanship]], which tends to avoid political affiliation altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ivn.us/2014/05/28/transpartisanship-new-idea-bring-people-together/|title=Transpartisanship: A New Idea to Bring People Together|date=2014-05-28|website=IVN.us|access-date=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==

Transpartisanship is a movement to support and advance a common ground - or "new center" - that already exists in U.S. politics, emerging periodically into public view in the form of "unusual coalitions" of [[progressives]] and [[conservatives]] around issues ranging from [[war]] and the [[Military budget of the United States|military budget]] to [[corporate power]] and the [[surveillance state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ivn.us/2016/09/06/the-transpartisan-grassroots-movement-to-overturn-citizens-united/|title=The Transpartisan, Grassroots Movement to Overturn Citizens United is Gaining Serious Momentum|date=2016-09-06|website=IVN.us|access-date=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.utne.com/Politics/Americas-Transpartisan-Future-Partisan|title=America’s Transpartisan Future|newspaper=Utne|access-date=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Husseini, Sam [http://husseini.posthaven.com/the-perennially-unusual-yet-somehow-ubiquitous-left-right-alliance-towards-acknowledging-an-anti-establishment-center "The Perennially 'Unusual' Yet Somehow Ubiquitous Left-Right Alliance: Towards Acknowledging an Anti-Establishment Center"]. http://husseini.posthaven.com. 2013-07-25. Retrieved 2013-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gerzon 2016 p."&gt;{{cite book|title=The Reunited States of America : how we can bridge the partisan divide|last=Gerzon|first=Mark|publisher=Berrett-Koehler Publishers, Inc|year=2016|isbn=978-1-62656-658-3|location=Oakland, CA|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement builds on methods of facilitated dialogue, [[deliberation]] and [[conflict resolution]].

Current examples of transpartisan initiatives include [http://www.transpartisancenter.org Transpartisan Center], [http://TheSolution.org TheSolution.org], [http://www.reunitingamerica.org Reuniting America], [http://www.meetup.com/TranspartisanSeattle/ Transpartisan Alliance], and [http://www.libertycoalition.net Liberty Coalition].

* &lt;blockquote&gt; Transpartisanship is an emerging field that advocates pragmatic and effective solutions to social and political problems, transcending and including preexisting political ideologies. Transpartisanship encompasses the idea that all systems are inextricably interconnected, and that successful outcomes can best be reached through inclusive, genuine, and respectful cooperation. Transpartisan democracy, in part, seeks to reintegrate the public’s voice in identifying, debating, and shaping governmental policies, while continuing to protect the sovereignty of the individual. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
* &lt;blockquote&gt; The term “Transpartisanship” has emerged to provide a meaningful alternative to “Bipartisanship,” and “Nonpartisanship.” Bipartisanship limits the dialogue process to two political viewpoints or entities, striving for compromise solutions. Nonpartisanship, on the other hand, tends to deny the existence of differing viewpoints in exchange for cooperation. Both the bipartisan and nonpartisan approaches can discount the multiplicity of viewpoints that exist, which often results in incomplete and therefore unsuccessful outcomes. In contrast to these, transpartisanship recognizes the existence and validity of many points of view, and advocates a constructive dialogue aimed at arriving at creative, integrated, and therefore, breakthrough solutions that meet the needs of all present. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Transpartisan gatherings have resulted not only in surprisingly civil conversations noted by mainstream media&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/politics/joegarofoli/article/MoveOn-founder-Tea-Party-figure-meet-4204384.php|title=MoveOn founder, Tea Party figure meet|newspaper=SFGate|access-date=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also in shifts from traditional ideological stances by some participants.&lt;ref&gt;Atlee, Tom. "[http://co-intelligence.org/polarization-Fetzer.html A Personally Transformational Encounter of Left and Right]". http://co-intelligence.org. 2004. Retrieved 2013-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

A close relative of transpartisanship is [[Integral politics]]. A transpartisan approach to policy would necessarily include individual and collective, as well as subjective and objective, perspective. Furthermore, similar to [[Integral theory (Ken Wilber)|Integral theory]], transpartisanship places politics in a developmental context, viewing democracy and prosperity not as static attainments, but rather emergent properties along a continuum of developmental stages.

==En Marche!==
In 2016, [[Emmanuel Macron]] created a new French political party, [[En Marche]]. The party sought to transcend traditional political boundaries to be a transpartisan organisation.

Macron has described the party as being a [[Progressivism|progressive]] party uniting the left and the right.&lt;ref name="lse"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lelab.europe1.fr/emmanuel-macron-refuse-detre-loblige-de-francois-hollande-2726290|title=Finalement, le parti d'Emmanuel Macron est "et de droite, et de gauche" (mais surtout progressiste) – Le Lab Europe 1|language=fr-FR|access-date=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Observers and political commentators have described the party as being both [[Social liberalism|socially]] and [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] in ideology,&lt;ref name="Cowley2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cowley|first1=Jason|title=Emmanuel Macron: a populist eruption from the liberal centre|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2017/02/emmanuel-macron-populist-eruption-liberal-centre|accessdate=25 April 2017|work=[[New Statesman]]|date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Endeweld2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Endeweld|first1=Marc|title=La démonstration de force du social-libéral Emmanuel Macron|url=https://www.marianne.net/politique/la-demonstration-de-force-du-social-liberal-emmanuel-macron|accessdate=25 April 2017|work=[[Marianne (magazine)|Marianne]]|date=10 December 2016|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Milner2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Milner|first1=Susan|title=Emmanuel Macron and the building of a new liberal-centrist movement|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2017/02/06/emmanuel-macron-liberal-centrist-movement/|website=EUROPP|publisher=[[London School of Economics]]|accessdate=25 April 2017|date=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Venturini2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Venturini|first1=Lionel|title=En marche !

The party also won the National Assembly elections a month later, as candidates in the legislative elections included members of the Democratic Movement, as well as dissidents from the Socialist Party, The Republicans and minor parties. It won an absolute majority of seats in the National Assembly, securing 308 under its label and 42 for the MoDem.

==Tuberculosis classification system==
The current clinical classification system for tuberculosis (TB) is based on the pathogenesis of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ajrccm.atsjournals.org/cgi/content/full/161/4/1376 Diagnostic Standards and Classification of Tuberculosis in Adults and Children]. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med., Volume 161, Number 4, April 2000, 1376-1395.  This Official Statement of the [[American Thoracic Society]] and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] was Adopted by the ATS Board of Directors, July 1999. This Statement was endorsed by the Council of the [[Infectious Disease Society of America]], September 1999.  Class 0-5 are explained on pages 1391-1392.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Health care providers should comply with local laws and regulations requiring the reporting of TB.  All persons with class 3 or class 5 TB should be reported promptly to the local health department. See [[list of notifiable diseases]].

The concept of a '''Turing pattern''' (often referred to in the plural as '''Turing patterns''') was introduced by the English mathematician [[Alan Turing]] in a 1952 paper entitled ''[[The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Turing | first1=A. M. | authorlink=Alan Turing | title=The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis | journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London]] B | volume=237 | issue=641 | pages=37–72 | doi=10.1098/rstb.1952.0012 | url=http://www.dna.caltech.edu/courses/cs191/paperscs191/turing.pdf | jstor=92463 | year=1952 | bibcode=1952RSPTB.237...37T }}&lt;/ref&gt; This foundational paper describes the way in which [[patterns in nature]] such as stripes and spots can arise naturally out of a homogeneous, uniform state.

The original theory, a [[Reaction–diffusion system|reaction–diffusion]] theory of [[morphogenesis]], has served as an important model in [[theoretical biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=L. G. | last=Harrison | title=Kinetic Theory of Living Pattern | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | year=1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reaction–diffusion system]]s have attracted much interest as a prototype model for [[pattern formation]]. Patterns such as [[Front (physics)|fronts]], [[hexagon]]s, [[spiral]]s, [[Stripe (pattern)|stripes]] and [[dissipative soliton]]s are found in various types of reaction-diffusion systems, despite large discrepancies, in the local reaction terms for example.

As well as in biological organisms, Turing patterns occur in other natural systems – for example, the wind patterns formed in sand. Although Turing's ideas on morphogenesis and Turing patterns remained dormant for many years, they are now inspirational for much research in [[mathematical biology]].&lt;ref&gt;Woolley, T.

"'''Two Dogmas of Empiricism'''" is a paper by [[analytic philosophy|analytic]] philosopher [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] published in 1951.  According to [[City University of New York]] professor of philosophy [[Peter Godfrey-Smith]], this "paper [is] sometimes regarded as the most important in all of [[20th century philosophy|twentieth-century philosophy]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Godfrey-Smith]], ''Theory and Reality'', 2003, [[University of Chicago]], {{ISBN|0-226-30062-5}}, pages 30-33 (section 2.4 "Problems and Changes")&lt;/ref&gt; The paper is an attack on two central aspects of the [[logical positivism|logical positivists']] philosophy. One is the [[analytic–synthetic distinction]] between [[analytic proposition|analytic]] [[truth]]s and [[Synthetic proposition|synthetic]] truths, explained by Quine as truths grounded only in meanings and independent of facts, and truths grounded in facts. The other is [[reductionism]], the theory that each meaningful statement gets its [[Meaning (linguistic)|meaning]] from some [[logic]]al construction of terms that refers exclusively to immediate experience.

"Two Dogmas" has six sections. The first four focus on analyticity, the last two on reductionism. There, Quine turns the focus to the logical positivists' theory of meaning. He also presents his own [[holism|holistic]] theory of meaning.

==Analyticity and circularity==

Most of Quine's argument against analyticity in the first four sections is focused on showing that different explanations of analyticity are circular. The main purpose is to show that no satisfactory explanation of analyticity has been given.

Quine begins by making a distinction between two different classes of analytic statements. The first one is called logically true and has the form:

:(1) No unmarried man is married

A sentence with that form is true independent of the interpretation of "man" and "married", so long as the logical particles "no", "un-" and "is" have their ordinary English meaning.

The statements in the second class have the form:

:(2) No bachelor is married.

A statement with this form can be turned into a statement with form (1) by exchanging [[synonym]]s with synonyms, in this case "bachelor" with "unmarried man". It is the second class of statements that lack characterization according to Quine. The notion of the second form of analyticity leans on the notion of synonymy, which Quine believes is in as much need of clarification as analyticity. Most of Quine's following arguments are focused on showing how explanations of synonymy end up being dependent on the notions of analyticity, necessity, or even synonymy itself.

How do we reduce sentences from the second class to a sentence of the first class? Some might propose ''definitions''. "No bachelor is married" can be turned into "No unmarried man is married" because "bachelor" is defined as "unmarried man". But, Quine asks: how do we find out that "bachelor" is defined as "unmarried man"? Clearly, a dictionary would not solve the problem, as a dictionary is a report of already known synonyms, and thus is dependent on the notion of synonymy, which Quine holds as unexplained.

A second suggestion Quine considers is an explanation of synonymy in terms of interchangeability. Two linguistic forms are (according to this view) synonymous if they are interchangeable  in all contexts without changing the [[truth-value]]. But consider the following example:

:(3) "Bachelor" has fewer than ten letters.

Obviously "bachelor" and "unmarried man" are not interchangeable in that sentence. To exclude that example and some other obvious counterexamples, such as poetic quality, Quine introduces the notion of [[cognitive synonymy]]. But does interchangeability hold as an explanation of cognitive synonymy? Suppose we have a language without [[wikt:Category:English modal adverbs|modal adverbs]] like "necessarily". Such a language would be [[Extension (semantics)|extensional]], in the way that two predicates which are true about the same objects are interchangeable again without altering the truth-value. Thus, there is no assurance that two terms that are interchangeable without the truth-value changing are interchangeable because of meaning, and not because of chance. For example, "creature with a heart" and "creature with kidneys" share extension.

In a language with the modal adverb "necessarily" the problem is solved, as ''[[salva veritate]]'' holds in the following case:

:(4) Necessarily all and only bachelors are unmarried men

while it does not hold for

:(5) Necessarily all and only creatures with a heart are creatures with kidneys.

Presuming that 'creature with a heart' and 'creature with kidneys' have the same extension, they will be interchangeable ''[[salva veritate]]''.  But this interchangeability rests upon both empirical features of the language itself and the degree to which extension is empirically found to be identical for the two concepts, and not upon the sought for principle of cognitive synonymy.

It seems that the only way to assert the synonymy is by supposing that the terms 'bachelor' and 'unmarried man' are synonymous and that the sentence "All and only all bachelors are unmarried men" is analytic.  But for ''salva veritate'' to hold as a definition of something more than extensional agreement, i.e., cognitive synonymy, we need a notion of necessity and thus of analyticity.

So, from the above example, it can be seen that in order for us to distinguish between analytic and synthetic we must appeal to synonymy; at the same time, we should also understand synonymy with interchangeability ''salva veritate''. However, such a condition to understand synonymy is not enough so we not only argue that the terms should be interchangeable, but necessarily so. And to explain this logical necessity we must appeal to analyticity once again.

==Reductionism==

Analyticity would be acceptable if we allowed for the [[verification theory]] of meaning: an analytic statement would be one synonymous with a [[logical truth]], which would be an extreme case of meaning where empirical verification is not needed, because it is "confirmed no matter what". "So, if the verification theory can be accepted as an adequate account of statement synonymy, the notion of analyticity is saved after all."

The problem that naturally follows is how statements are to be verified. An empiricist would say that it can only be done using [[empirical evidence]]. So some form of reductionism - "the belief that each meaningful statement is equivalent to some logical construct upon terms which refer to immediate experience" - must be assumed in order for an empiricist to 'save' the notion of analyticity. Such reductionism, says Quine, presents just as intractable a problem as did analyticity.

In order to prove that all meaningful statements can be translated into a sense-datum language, a reductionist would surely have to confront "the task of specifying a sense-datum language and showing how to translate the rest of significant discourse, statement by statement, into it." To illustrate the difficulty of doing so, Quine describes [[Rudolf Carnap]]'s attempt in his book ''Der logische Aufbau der Welt''.

Quine first observes that Carnap's starting point was not the strictest possible, as his "sense-datum language" included not only sense-events but also "the notations of logic, up through higher set theory... Empiricists there are who would boggle at such prodigality." Nonetheless, says Quine, Carnap showed great ingenuity in defining sensory concepts "which, but for his constructions, one would not have dreamed were definable on so slender a basis."  However, even such admirable efforts left Carnap, by his own admission, far short of completing the whole project.

Finally, Quine objects in principle to Carnap's proposed translation of statements like "quality q is at point-instant x;y;z;t" into his sense-datum language, because he does not define the connective "is at". Without statements of this kind, it is difficult to see, even in principle, how Carnap's project could have been completed.

The difficulty that Carnap encountered shows that reductionism is, at best, unproven and very difficult to prove. Until a reductionist can produce an acceptable proof, Quine maintains that reductionism is another "metaphysical article of faith".

==Quine's holism==
{{see also|Confirmation holism}}

Instead of reductionism, Quine proposes that it is the whole field of science and not single statements that are verified. All scientific statements are interconnected. Logical laws give the relation between different statements, while they also are statements of the system. This makes talk about the empirical content of a single statement misleading.  It also becomes impossible to draw a line between synthetic statements, which depend on experience, and analytic statements, that [[hold come what may]]. Any statement can be held as necessarily true according to Quine, if the right changes are made somewhere else in the system. In the same way, no statements are immune to revision.

Even logical laws can be revised according to Quine.  [[Quantum logic]], introduced by [[Garrett Birkhoff]] and [[John von Neumann]], abandons the [[law of distributivity]] from classical logic in order to reconcile some of the apparent inconsistencies of classical [[Boolean logic]] with the facts related to measurement and observation in quantum mechanics. Quine makes the case that the empirical study of physics has furnished apparently credible grounds for replacing classical logic by quantum logic, rather as  [[Classical mechanics|Newtonian physics]] gave way to [[General relativity|Einsteinian physics]]. The idea that logical laws are not immune to revision in the light of [[empirical evidence]] has provoked an intense debate (see "[[Is Logic Empirical?]]").

According to Quine, there are two different results of his reasoning. The first is a blurring of the line between [[metaphysics]] and natural science. The common-sense theory about physical objects is [[Epistemology|epistemologically]] comparable to the gods of [[Homer]]. Quine is a [[physicalist]], in the sense that he considers it a scientific error not to adopt a theory which makes reference to physical objects. However, like Gods of Homer, physical objects are posits, and there is no great epistemic difference in kind; the difference is rather that the theory of physical objects has turned out to be a more efficient theory. As Quine states in "Two Dogmas", "The myth of physical objects is epistemologically superior to most in that it has proved more efficacious than other myths as a device for working a manageable structure into the flux of
experience".

The second result is a move towards [[pragmatism]]. Since, Quine says, the function of science is to predict future experiences in the light of past ones, the only ground for choosing which  explanations to believe is "the degree to which they expedite our dealings with [[empirical evidence|sense experience]]s." While pragmatic concerns are important for [[Carnap]] and other logical positivists when choosing a linguistic framework, their pragmatism "leaves off at the imagined boundary between the analytic and the synthetic". For Quine, every change in the system of science is, when [[rationality|rational]], pragmatic.

==Critique and influence==

[[Rudolf Carnap]] prepared a reply entitled "Quine on Analyticity", but this was not published until 1990.  Addressing Quine's concern over the status of the sentence "Everything green is extended", Carnap wrote "the difficulty here lies in the unclarity of the word 'green', namely in an indecision over whether one should use the word for something unextended, i.e., for a single space-time point. In daily life it is never so used, and one scarcely ever speaks of space-time points."  Carnap then puts forward that an exact artificial language ought to clarify the problem by defining 'green' (or its synonym) as something that is either necessarily or contingently not applied to space-time points.  He wrote that once that decision is made, the difficulty is resolved.  Carnap also answers Quine's argument on the use of sets of formal sentences to explain analyticity by arguing that this method is an explication of a poorly understood notion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Quine, W. V. and Rudolf Carnap|title=Dear Carnap, Dear Van: The Quine-Carnap Correspondence and Related Work|year=1990|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, CA|pages=427–432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Grice]] and [[P. F. Strawson]] criticized "Two Dogmas" in their (1956) article "In Defense of a Dogma". Among other things, they argue that Quine's [[skepticism]] about synonyms leads to a skepticism about meaning. If statements can have meanings, then it would make sense to ask "What does it mean?". If it makes sense to ask "What does it mean?", then synonymy can be defined as follows: Two sentences are synonymous if and only if the true answer of the question "What does it mean?" asked of one of them is the true answer to the same question asked of the other.  They also draw the conclusion that discussion about correct or incorrect translations would be impossible given Quine's argument. Four years after Grice and Strawson published their paper, Quine's book ''[[Word and Object]]'' was released. In the book Quine presented his theory of [[indeterminacy of translation]].

In "'Two Dogmas' revisited", [[Hilary Putnam]] argues that Quine is attacking two different notions. Analytic truth defined as a true statement derivable from a [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]] by putting synonyms for synonyms is near [[Immanuel Kant|Kant's]] account of analytic truth as a truth whose negation is a contradiction. Analytic truth defined as a truth confirmed no matter what however, is closer to one of the traditional accounts of ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]''. While the first four sections of Quine's paper concern analyticity, the last two concern apriority. Putnam considers the argument in the two last sections as independent of the first four, and at the same time as Putnam criticizes Quine, he also emphasizes his historical importance as the first top rank philosopher to both reject the notion of apriority and sketch a methodology without it.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, Hilary, "'Two dogmas' revisited." In Gilbert Ryle, ''Contemporary Aspects of Philosophy.'' Stocksfield: Oriel Press, 1976, 202–213.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jerrold Katz]], a onetime associate of [[Noam Chomsky]]'s, countered the arguments of "Two Dogmas" directly by trying to define analyticity non-circularly on the syntactical features of sentences.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/20114738 Linsky, J. ''Analytical/Synthetic and Semantic Theory'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2023770 Quine, W. v. O.: ''On a Suggestion of Katz'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psiquadrat.de/downloads/katz74.pdf Katz, J: ''Where Things Stand Now with the Analytical/Synthetic Distinction'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Philosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century, Volume 1 : The Dawn of Analysis'' [[Scott Soames]] (pp 360–361) has pointed out that Quine's circularity argument needs two of the logical positivists' central theses to be effective:

:All [[Logical truth|necessary truths]] (and all ''a priori'' truths) are analytic

:Analyticity is needed to explain and legitimate necessity.

It is only when these two theses are accepted that Quine's argument holds. It is not a problem that the notion of necessity is presupposed by the notion of analyticity if necessity can be explained without analyticity. According to Soames, both theses were accepted by most philosophers when Quine published "Two Dogmas". Today however, Soames holds both statements to be antiquated.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5697">{{Type systems}}
In [[computing]], a '''unique type''' guarantees that an object is used in a [[single-threaded]] way, with at most a single reference to it. If a value has a unique type, a function applied to it can be [[Compiler optimization|optimized]] to update the value in-place in the [[object code]]. Such in-place updates improve the efficiency of [[functional language]]s while maintaining [[Referential transparency (computer science)|referential transparency]]. Unique types can also be used to integrate functional and imperative programming.

==Introduction==
Uniqueness typing is best explained using an example. Consider a function &lt;code&gt;readLine&lt;/code&gt; that reads the next line of text from a given file:
  '''function''' readLine(File f) '''returns''' String
      '''return''' line '''where'''
          String line = doImperativeReadLineSystemCall(f)
      '''end'''
  '''end'''

Now &lt;code&gt;doImperativeReadLineSystemCall&lt;/code&gt; reads the next line from the file using an [[operating system|OS]]-level [[system call]] which has the [[Side effect (computer science)|side effect]] of changing the current position in the file. But this violates referential transparency because calling it multiple times with the same argument will return different results each time as the current position in the file gets moved. This in turn makes &lt;code&gt;readLine&lt;/code&gt; violate referential transparency because it calls &lt;code&gt;doImperativeReadLineSystemCall&lt;/code&gt;.

However, using uniqueness typing, we can construct a new version of &lt;code&gt;readLine&lt;/code&gt; that is referentially transparent even though it's built on top of a function that's not referentially transparent:
  '''function''' readLine2('''unique''' File f) '''returns''' ('''unique''' File, String)
      '''return''' (differentF, line) '''where'''
          String line = doImperativeReadLineSystemCall(f)
          File differentF = newFileFromExistingFile(f)
      '''end'''
  '''end'''

The &lt;code&gt;unique&lt;/code&gt; declaration specifies that the type of &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; is unique; that is to say that &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; may never be referred to again by the caller of &lt;code&gt;readLine2&lt;/code&gt; after &lt;code&gt;readLine2&lt;/code&gt; returns, and this restriction is enforced by the [[type system]]. And since &lt;code&gt;readLine2&lt;/code&gt; does not return &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; itself but rather a new, different file object &lt;code&gt;differentF&lt;/code&gt;, this means that it's impossible for &lt;code&gt;readLine2&lt;/code&gt; to be called with &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; as an argument ever again, thus preserving referential transparency while allowing for side effects to occur.

==Programming languages==
Uniqueness types are implemented in the functional programming languages [[Clean (programming language)|Clean]], [[Mercury (programming language)|Mercury]] and [[Idris (programming_language)|Idris]]. They are sometimes used for doing [[I/O]] operations in functional languages in lieu of [[Monads in functional programming|monad]]s.

A compiler extension has been developed for the [[Scala (programming language)|Scala programming language]] which uses annotations to handle uniqueness in the context of message passing between actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Haller|first1=P.|last2=Odersky|first2=M.|authorlink2=Martin Odersky|year=2010|contribution=Capabilities for uniqueness and borrowing|title=ECOOP 2010—Object-Oriented Programming|pages=354–378|url=http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~phaller/doc/capabilities-uniqueness2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to linear typing==
A unique type is very similar to a [[linear type]], to the point that the terms are often used interchangeably, but there is in fact a distinction: actual linear typing allows a non-linear value to be [[Type casting (computer programming)|typecast]] to a linear form, while still retaining multiple references to it. Uniqueness guarantees that a value has no other references to it, while linearity guarantees that no more references can be made to a value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=Philip |last=Wadler |authorlink=Philip Wadler |title=Is there a use for linear logic? |conference=ACM SIGPLAN symposium on partial evaluation and semantics-based program manipulation (PEPM '91) |date=17–19 June 1991 |url=http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/topics/linear-logic.html#linearuse |pages=255–273 |doi=10.1145/115865.115894 |isbn=0-89791-433-3 |citeseerx=10.1.1.26.4202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

• Reform its laws and practices to adhere to international standards established in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], including the promotion of [[gender equality]]; respect for [[freedom of assembly]], [[freedom of expression]], and [[freedom of religion]]; and ensuring freedom from torture, arbitrary detention, and extrajudicial execution.
• Institute electoral and democratic reforms and hold genuine democratic elections open to international electoral observation.
• Establish a moratorium on the [[death penalty]] until due process rights are guaranteed and with a view toward joining the global movement toward abolition.
To advance this agenda, United for Iran will pursue the following objectives: contribute to NGO coalition-building and collaboration among organizations that work on human rights promotion in Iran; encourage cooperation by the Iranian government with the international human rights system; and exert international pressure on the Iranian government to carry about the above human rights objectives.
United for Iran is an independent non-profit organization formed in 2009 after the [[2009–2010 Iranian election protests]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/30/world/middleeast/30iran.html|title=Iran Lashes Out at West Over Protests|first=Nazila|last=Fathi|authorlink=Nazila Fathi|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Jainism}}
The '''''Vira Nirvana Samvat''''' (era) is a [[calendar era]] beginning on 15 October 527 BCE. It commemorates the [[nirvana]] of [[Mahavira]], the 24th [[Jain]] [[Tirthankara]]. This is one of the oldest system of chronological reckoning which is still used in [[India]].{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=24}}

== History ==

The earliest text to mention 527 BCE as the year of [[Mahavira]]'s [[Moksha (Jainism)|nirvana]] is [[Yati-Vrishabha]]'s ''[[Tiloya-Pannatti]]'' (5th century CE).{{sfn|Kailash Chand Jain|1991|p=84}} Subsequent works such as [[Jinasena]]'s ''[[Harivamsa Purana|Harivamśa]]'' (783 CE) mention the Vira Nirvana era, and give the difference between it and the [[Shaka era]] (beginning in 78 CE) as 605 years and 5 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=D. C. Sircar |title=Indian Epigraphy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hXMB3649biQC&amp;pg=PA321 |year=1965 |publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]] |isbn=978-81-208-1166-9 |pages=321–322 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 October 1974 the 2500th Nirvana Mahotsava was celebrated by the Jains throughout India.&lt;ref name="N. Upadhye, Review 1982 pp. 231-232"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mahavira and His Teachings|first=A.

==Usage==

The Jain year Vira Nirvana Samvat is obtained by adding 470 years to the Kartikadi Vikram samvat. For example, The Vira Nirvana Samvat 2544 started right after Diwali of October 20, 2017 on Vikram 2074, Kartika Krishna Amavasya (Chaitradi and Purnimanta).&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinejainpathshala.com/images/jf/gallery/tithi_darpan_2018.jpg  Jain Tithi Darpan, Vir Nirvan Samvat 2044]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.herenow4u.net/fileadmin/pics/ext/fb/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/15591324_1219042171509416_2745373736079847221_o.jpg___aHR0cHM6Ly9zY29udGVudC54eC5mYmNkbi5uZXQvdi90MzEuMC04LzE1NTkxMzI0XzEyMTkwNDIxNzE1MDk0MTZfMjc0NTM3MzczNjA3OTg0NzIyMV9vLmpwZw==___.jpg  Shri Guru Pushkar Jain Devendra Calendar, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; The new Chaitradiadi Vikram samvat (common in North India) starts seven months earier in Chaitra, thus during Chaitra-Kartika Krishna, the difference between Vikram and Vir Nivana samvat is 469 years.

The Jain business people traditionally started their accounting year from Diwali. The relationship between the Vir and Shaka era is given in Titthogali Painnaya and Dhavalaa by Acharya Virasena:&lt;ref&gt;Jain Sahitya aur Itihas par Vrihad Prakash, Jugalkishor Mukhtar, July 1956 p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|पंच य मासा पंच य वास छच्चेव होन्ति वाससया &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;
परिणिव्वुअस्स अरिहितो तो उप्पन्नो सगो राया &lt;nowiki&gt;||&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

Thus the Nirvana occurred 605 years and 5 months before the Saka era.

==Jain Calendar==
The Jain calendar ([[Panchangam|Panchāng]]) is a [[lunisolar calendar]], just like the traditional Vikarm or Saka calendars .  The months based on the position of the [[Moon]] with respect to the Earth and it is adjusted by adding an extra month (adhika masa) once every three years, to coincide with the [[Sun]] to bring month in phase with the season.  Its day or date which is known as Tithi, indicates the moon phase and the month indicates the approximate season of the [[solar year]].

The [[lunisolar calendar]] has the following arrangement:
A regular or normal year has 12 months; a leap year has 13 months.
A regular or normal year has 353, 354, or 355 days; a leap year has 383, 384, or 385 days.

The average number of days in a month is 30 but the average number of days in a Lunisolar year is 354 and not 360 (12 months in a year) because it takes the Moon about 29.5 days (not 30 days) to complete the circle around the Earth.  Hence one Tithi is eliminated in about duration of two months.
The [[Hebrew calendar|Hebrew]], [[Hindu calendar|Hindu]] lunar, [[Buddhist calendar|Buddhist]], and [[Tibetan calendar|Tibetan]] calendars are all lunisolar, and so were the Japanese calendars until 1873 and the Chinese calendars until 1912.

The Islamic calendar is a pure Lunar Calendar because its date (Tithi) indicates the moon phase but its months are not in phase with the time of the solar year or the season.  It does not adjust its calendar to coincide with the sun or the season.  Hence no extra month is added every three years.

[[Gregorian calendar|The Gregorian calendar]] (English CE) is a pure [[Solar calendar|Solar Calendar]] and its date indicates the time of the solar season but not the moon phase.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5348">A '''Wardley map''' is a [[map]] of the structure of a business or service, mapping the components needed to serve the customer or user. Wardley maps are named after Simon Wardley who claims to have created them in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.gardeviance.org/2015/02/an-introduction-to-wardley-value-chain.html|title=An introduction to Wardley (Value Chain) Mapping|website=blog.gardeviance.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary ==
Each component in a Wardley map is classified by the value it has to the customer or user and by the maturity of that component, ranging from custom-made to commodity. Components are drawn as nodes on a graph with value on the y-axis and commodity on the x-axis. A custom-made component with no direct value to the user would sit at the bottom-left of such a graph while a commodity component with high direct value to the user would sit at the top-right of such a graph. Components are connected on the graph with edges showing that they are linked.

Much of the theory of Wardley mapping is set out in a series of 12 blog posts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/wardleymaps|title=wardleymaps – Medium|website=Medium|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a dedicated Wiki called Wardleypedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wardleypedia.org/mediawiki/index.php/Wardleypedia|title=Wardleypedia - WardleyPedia|website=wardleypedia.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; As use of the technique has broadened to new institutions and been used to map new things the application of the technique in practice has drifted from the original vision.

== Example ==
Imagine that we want to set up a new drone courier service. The user need is to receive packages quickly from our company. Our objective as a company is to meet this user need by delivering packages quickly to customers. This is a high-value, low-commodity component and is placed at the top-left of a Wardley map. If there were dozens of competing drone courier companies this component would move right on the Wardley map, indicating that the service is closer to being a commodity.

Other components are mapped similarly. For example a drone operator needs to be aware of the weather conditions to determine the route a drone should take and the maximum weight it can carry. Weather information is of little value to the customer and can be bought from a wide range of weather data providers. It is thus placed at the bottom-right of the Wardley map.

== Uses ==
Wardley maps are used within UK government, with particular interest within the [[Government Digital Service|Government Digital Service (GDS)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.computerweekly.com/opinion/The-power-of-situational-awareness-for-digital-government|title=The power of situational awareness for digital government|work=ComputerWeekly.com|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; for strategic planning and identifying the best targets for government digital service modernisation.

They have been used to map the existing and planned technology infrastructure and services for [[High Speed 2|High-Speed Two (HS2)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Practical-application-of-ITC-framework-mapping-HS2s-infrastructure_fig2_277076845|title=Figure 3: Practical application of ITC framework: mapping HS2's...|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Atlas2&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/LeadingEdgeForum/atlas2|title=LeadingEdgeForum/atlas2|website=GitHub|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; tool, by Leading Edge Forum, aims to assist with the creation of Wardley maps.

== Criticisms ==
The Wardley mapping process for abstracting a business or service into components is often not intuitive to people who experience it for the first time. A particular challenge is the subjective placement of each component on a Wardley map, with different people and even the same people at different times likely to place a component in a significantly different position on the map. While there is still value in identifying these uncertainties and differences of opinion, detractors claim that the same valuable discussion could have been achieved without the Wardley mapping process being involved.

Proponents of Wardley mapping claim that much of the process's value lies in "exposing assumptions. allowing challenge and creating consensus"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/swardley/status/888866083142348801|title=Simon Wardley #NfN #EEA on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; — but detractors worry that the process in fact lets people "launder assumptions into facts, delegitimise challenge (and still create consensus)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.mattedgar.com/2017/08/13/what-do-wardley-maps-really-map-a-settler-writes/|title=What do Wardley maps really map?
