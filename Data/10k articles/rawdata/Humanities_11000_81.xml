[[Image:Lemon0707070137.jpg|right|thumb|175px|LeMons Racing at Altamont, July 7–8, 2007]]
The '''24 Hours of Lemons''' is a series of [[Endurance racing (motorsport)|endurance races]] held on paved road race courses across the United States and, since 2016, New Zealand. The series holds the [[Guinness World Record]] for the "Most participants in one race" (216 cars).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/86963-most-participants-in-a-car-race|title=Most participants in a car race|publisher=[[Guinness World Records]]|access-date=2017-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The title is a [[parody]] of the long running annual [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] race, and [[Lemon (automobile)|lemon cars]]. Teams  of 4 or more drivers compete for up to 24 hours in race-prepared cars that cost no more than US$500 for cars in the USA series (NZD$999 in New Zealand) as with [[Folkrace|folkracing]] there is a price limit. These races set themselves apart from the typical [[road racing|road race]] by the unusual penalties and punishments meted out by judges, as well as a blatant disregard for traditional motorsport politicking.  The series is similar to the [[ChumpCar|ChumpCar World Series]] which developed out of it, but retains a more carnival-like atmosphere.

==Event overview==
The event is billed as a 24-hour endurance race. The event covers a weekend, and participants endure "scrutiny" and a number of qualifiers along with the main endurance race of varying total hours, depending on the venue (including resource consent/s and Licences). The organizers state that they will attempt to run at least one true 24-hour race (continuous) every year.&lt;ref name="LeMonsFAQs"&gt;[http://www.24hoursoflemons.com/contentpage.aspx?Id=6611 The 24 Hours of LeMons: FAQ &amp; How-To] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111025060847/http://www.24hoursoflemons.com/contentpage.aspx?Id=6611 |date=2011-10-25 }} accessed November 16, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
The 24 Hours of LeMons, founded by author/editor Jay Lamm (self appointed "Chief Perp"), began in 2006 as a progression of an earlier [[San Francisco, California]] event, the Double 500, which was a 500-kilometer [[road rally]] for US$500 vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.24hoursoflemons.com/faq.aspx 24 Hours of LeMons FAQ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617134919/http://www.24hoursoflemons.com/faq.aspx |date=2013-06-17 }} - AREN'T YOU THOSE DOUBLE 500 GUYS?&lt;/ref&gt; After several yearly Double 500s, the organizers deemed the event too easy, so the 24 Hours of Lemons endurance race was born.

The earliest LeMons races were held at [[Altamont Motorsports Park]] and other tracks in [[California]]. The series expanded in 2008 to include events in the eastern United States, with races held in [[Connecticut]], [[Ohio]], [[South Carolina]] and [[Texas]] in addition to the races in California and [[Nevada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.24hoursoflemons.com/events.aspx Series Events &amp; Results] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124015802/http://www.24hoursoflemons.com/events.aspx |date=2011-11-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008, a LeMons race held at Altamont Motorsports Park was struck by tragedy when the driver of one of the cars died during the race. Court Summerfield, 47, suffered a heart attack or stroke during the race and crashed into a wall. Investigations revealed that there were no malfunctions with the car and that the driver was already dead upon impact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jalopnik.com/389712/court-summerfield-1961-2008 Court Summerfield, 1961-2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, New Zealand hosted its inaugural Lemons event at [[Hampton Downs Motorsport Park]] in [[Waikato]]. Race Director Dr. Jacob Simonsen (the "Chief Lemon squeezer") established 24 Hours of Lemons as a Nationwide series with 3 events per year and the inclusion of a unique 24 hour "day/night" race. In 2018, 24 Hours of Lemons became New Zealand's largest participation motorsport series, with 295 drivers in one event, which was also the country's first ever continuous 24 hour motorsport race.

==Preparation and rules==
[[File:Fiat.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A typical LeMons racer being refueled; in this case, a [[Fiat 131]].]]
To enter the event, participants must find a car where purchasing and prepping the car will not exceed US$500,&lt;ref name= "LeMonsRules"&gt;[http://www.24hoursoflemons.com/rules/ The 24 Hours of LeMons: Rules] accessed March 30, 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070321160352/http://www.24hoursoflemons.com/rules/ |date=March 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="C&amp;D"&gt;{{cite web|title = Beaters Rule! The 24 Hours of LeMons|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/hot_lists/high_performance/features_classic_cars/beaters_rule_the_24_hours_of_lemons_feature|accessdate=2008-03-30|author=TONY QUIROGA |publisher=Car and Driver |date= February 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080418081900/http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/hot_lists/high_performance/features_classic_cars/beaters_rule_the_24_hours_of_lemons_feature| archivedate= 18 April 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; AUD$999 and NZD$999 respectively.

The relatively low value of entrant's cars alludes to the name of the race as such a vehicle might be considered a "[[Lemon (automobile)|lemon]]". The event organizers set a complete set of safety rules that typically are on par with other [[road racing]] sanctioning bodies, including the [[Sports Car Club of America]], [[National Auto Sport Association]] (USA), [[Australian Auto Sport Alliance|Australian Auto-sport Alliance]], and [[Motor sport in New Zealand#Clubs and organisations|Motorsport New Zealand]]. Additions to the rules (both serious and humorous, plus rules to discourage [[cheating]]) include:
* Dollar limit to prep car. This includes the purchase price of the car, any modifications made to it, and other assorted expenses (such as labor and sponsorships) are figured into the cost. Approved safety equipment (see below) plus [[brakes]], [[wheel]]s, and [[tire]]s are not included in the vehicle purchase figure.
* Items sold off a car can be deducted from the total spent, so it is possible to buy a more expensive car and sell off parts, or sell parts and buy better equipment. (i.e. selling off parts from a [[BMW]] or other similar [[luxury car]] to circumvent/comply with the purchase 'cap' rule.)
**If the event organizers feel the car has exceeded its financial limit, they assign what is called a BSF ([[Bullshit]] Factor), where every $10 the car exceeds over the purchase price is docked one lap (BS penalties may vary in each territory).
* Car must have four wheels and have been legal for highway use at its time of manufacture.
* Event organizers have full rights to buy the car for the "purchase price limit" at the end of the race.

Required safety equipment includes:
*A six point [[roll cage]] (USA), minimum half-cage with side intrusion (for New Zealand)
*Full-face [[Snell Memorial Foundation|Snell]] SA2015 [[helmet]] or better
*[[Fire extinguisher]] and/or fire suppression system (mandatory as of 2019 season)
*Five or six point [[Five-point_harness|racing harness]]
*SFI 3.2A/1 [[Nomex]]-style fire suit, fire resistant/retardant gloves, shoes and with fire retardant underwear
*SFI 38.1-rated or FIA 8858-rated [[HANS device|head and neck support]].
*Drivers seat must reach the middle of the helmet or higher. SFI or [[FIA]] approved seat recommended
*New Zealand rules differ slightly but are based on AASA regulations

==Race==
In the USA, most events are 14.5 hours long, with sessions on Saturday and Sunday running from six to ten hours long. There is usually one full 24 hour endurance race each year. In Australia and New Zealand, events average 20 hours over the 2 – 3 days.

Each race begins with all cars being released onto the track under a full course [[Racing flags#Yellow flag|yellow flag]] for lap-timing [[Transponder#Motorsport|transponder]] checks. No passing is permitted under yellow, so all cars operational before the start (over 150 have been known to start) will circulate around the track in single file for up to 20 minutes until the officials are satisfied that the timing and scoring system is working properly. The race officially begins with the [[Racing flags#Green flag|green flag]] being waved at a randomly chosen car.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.speedsportlife.com/2009/09/17/racer-boy-24-hours-of-lemons-or-endurace-racing-for-the-financially-and-mentally-challenged/&lt;/ref&gt;

Standard [[racing flags]] are used by [[Track marshal|corner workers]] stationed around the track to communicate with drivers. The [[Racing flags#Black flag|black flag]] is used liberally throughout the race to mandate an immediate pit stop for concerns with the driving or with the car. Driving infractions range from any contact with another vehicle or fixed barrier and overly aggressive driving to spinning or driving two wheels off of the track. Car problems that typically result in black flags are, most frequently, obvious safety problems such as any fluid leak, parts hanging off the car, or inoperative lights. Drivers must report to the [[24 Hours of LeMons#Penalties|penalty box]] immediately after being shown a black flag.

Races that are split into two days will have a [[Racing flags#The checkered flag|checkered flag]] at the end of the first day, signifying the end of the racing session. The race is restarted on the next day, normally with the top ten cars being permitted to line up in order with the first-place car getting the green flag.

==Penalties==
[[Image:24 Hours of Lemons Wheel of Misfortune Buttonwillow 2009.JPG|right|thumb|175px|Wheel of Misfortune - Buttonwillow, CA August 15–16, 2009]]
Lemons officials have an idiosyncratic penalty and punishment system&lt;ref name="LeMonsPenalties"&gt;{{cite web|title = Lemons Penalties 101|url=http://www.rahulnair.net/blog/2009/04/07/lemons-penalties-101/|accessdate=2009-04-08|author=Rahul Nair |publisher=Racing Geek |date= April 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090417225907/http://www.rahulnair.net/blog/2009/04/07/lemons-penalties-101/| archivedate= 17 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; where penalties for some infractions are meted out by a device called '''The Wheel of Misfortune'''.&lt;ref name="C&amp;D"/&gt; Various devices may be put onto the car in order to affect car performance; one device used is metal silhouettes of various farm animals [[welded]] to the roof by the "Arc Angel" to reduce aerodynamic efficiency. Also, any car that flips in the process of the race is slapped with the "Why Am I Upside-Down?" penalty: not only is that team disqualified for the current race, but the driver who flipped the car is barred from all other races for the rest of the season. Likewise, drivers and teams might also be forced to undertake physical acts in order to satisfy punishment conditions, such as the [[Marcel Marceau]] Memorial "Mime Your Crime" penalty, where a driver must put on white face paint and a beret and [[mime]] what they did wrong. In addition, penalties are often tailored to address current events or figures where the race is run. Examples of this include the "[[Max Mosley]] [[Sadomasochism|S&amp;M]] Penalty", the "Sheriff [[Joe Arpaio]] Penalty" in [[Arizona]] (where drivers must don pink underwear, sit in a hot tent and eat stale bologna sandwiches, all punishments the [[Maricopa County]] sheriff has inflicted at his prisons), and the "[[Mark Sanford]] 'Cry For Me, [[Argentina]]' Memorial Penalty" at a race in [[South Carolina]], in which a driver must write a lengthy love letter to his Argentine mistress on his car, à la the former governor of that state. All penalties are designed to waste a driver's time, while less aggressive and better drivers continue to race.

==Awards==
[[Image:Lemon0707070198.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Car being destroyed at Altamont, 7–8 July '07]]
There are four main awards with one given midway through the race. Note that, in the USA, all prize money is typically awarded entirely in [[Nickel_(United_States_coin)|nickels]] (five-cent coins).&lt;ref name= "LeMonsFAQs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="C&amp;D"/&gt;

The midway award was aptly named '''People's Curse'''. One car was voted People's Curse, for being driven by the biggest jerks of the day as judged by the attending crowd. The offending car was crushed or otherwise destroyed typically by heavy equipment, but when none could be found, an angry mob with wire cutters and wrenches had been used. If there were not enough votes to destroy a car, it may have instead received nasty but non-fatal damage, or it may have been sent to the Penalty Box with a black flag. For 2013 the Curse was removed from the series.

The counterpoint to the People's Curse, '''Organizers Choice''' (originally People's Choice) is awarded to the team that best represents the friendly spirit of the race. A trophy and $500 prize is given.

The car that completes the most laps net of pre-race "BS" penalties is awarded the '''Win on Laps''', and the team receives a trophy. Through 2011, the winner on laps also received a $1500 cash prize, typically in the form of [[Nickel (United States coin)|nickels]].

The grand prize (and considered by some to be the "true" winner) is the '''[[Index of Effluency]]''' award, presented to a car considered unlikely to finish the race at all, let alone finish with a respectable number of laps completed. The team that wins the Index of Effluency is given a larger trophy and a cash prize. The prize was $1501 through 2011, and was reduced to $501 beginning in 2012; in each case, the prize is $1 more than the team could win by winning the race or their class. Prizes, trophies and awards vary depending on the territory.

In the USA, prior to a race, every entry is assigned into a class, A, B, C, or X. The car in each class that completes the most laps net of pre-race "BS" penalties (with the exception of the winner on laps, which was previously recognized) is awarded the class win, and the team receives a trophy. Beginning in 2012, the winners of classes A, B, and C each also receive a $500 cash prize, typically in nickels.

Several other trophies are given, typically: '''Most Heroic Fix''',&lt;ref name="History of the Heroic Fix Award"&gt;{{cite web|title = History of the Heroic Fix|url=http://murileemartin.com/wordpress/?p=520|accessdate=2011-02-11|author=Murilee Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''I Got Screwed''',&lt;ref name="History of the I Got Screwed"&gt;{{cite web|title = I Got Screwed|url=http://murileemartin.com/wordpress/?p=956|accessdate=2011-02-11|author=Murilee Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Grassroots Motorsports Magazine's Most from the Least''', '''Least''' (or '''Most''') '''Horrible Yank Tank''', and trophies to the fastest cars of the three classes.

Occasionally, '''Judges' Choice''' or '''Dangerous Homemade Technology''' awards are given.

At the end of each season, the organizers also recognize a group of '''Legends of LeMons''' for especially noteworthy themes, fabrication work, or other contributions to the series. Forty-one teams earned such recognition in 2009,&lt;ref name="2009 Legends"&gt;{{cite web|title=LeMons Legends: Some of Our Favorite 24 Hours of LeMons Cars From 2009|url=http://jalopnik.com/5429364/lemons-legends-some-of-our-favorite-24-hours-of-lemons-cars-from-2009|accessdate=2011-11-17|author=Murilee Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first year teams were so honored. In 2010, the number of teams earning "Legend" status increased to 58, but this time, four were singled out for the exceptional honor of a '''Unununium Medal''',&lt;ref name="2010 LeMons 111 medal"&gt;{{cite web|title=The 2010 Legends of LeMons: Unununium Medal Winners!|url=http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2011/01/the-2010-legends-of-lemons-unununium-medal-winners/|accessdate=2011-11-17|author=Murilee Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt; the next twenty were awarded a '''Ununquadium Medal''',&lt;ref name="2010 LeMons 114 medal"&gt;{{cite web|title=The 2010 Legends of LeMons: Ununquadium Medal Winners!|url=http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2011/01/the-2010-legends-of-lemons-ununquadium-medal-winners/|accessdate=2011-11-17|author=Murilee Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the remaining 34 received a '''Ununhexium Medal'''.&lt;ref name="2010 LeMons 116 medal"&gt;{{cite web|title=The 2010 Legends of LeMons: Ununhexium Medal Winners!|url=http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2011/01/the-2010-legends-of-lemons-ununhexium-medal-winners/|accessdate=2011-11-17|author=Murilee Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the list of awards was pared down from previous seasons, as nine racers and teams were awarded a '''Gluon Medal'''&lt;ref name="2011 LeMons Gluon Medal"&gt;{{cite web|title=Legends of LeMons!

'''Art valuation''', an art-specific subset of [[Valuation (finance)|financial valuation]], is the process of estimating either the [[market value]] of [[Work of art|works of art]]. As such, it is more of a financial rather than an [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] concern, however, subjective views of cultural value play a part as well. Art valuation involves comparing data from multiple sources such as art [[auction|auction houses]], private and corporate collectors, [[curators]], art dealer activities, [[Art museum|gallerists]] (gallery owners), experienced consultants, and specialized market analysts to arrive at a value.&lt;ref name="Coslor"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coslor|first=Erica|date=April 2016|title=Transparency in an opaque market: Evaluative frictions between "thick" valuation and "thin" price data in the art market|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361368216300307|journal=Accounting, Organizations and Society|volume=50|pages=13–26|doi=10.1016/j.aos.2016.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8035.html|title=Talking Prices|website=Princeton University Press|access-date=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ertug|first=Gokhan|last2=Yogev|first2=Tamar|last3=Lee|first3=Yonghoon G.|last4=Hedström|first4=Peter|date=1 February 2016|title=The Art of Representation: How Audience-specific Reputations Affect Success in the Contemporary Art Field|url=http://amj.aom.org/content/59/1/113|journal=Academy of Management Journal|language=en|volume=59|issue=1|pages=113–134|doi=10.5465/amj.2013.0621|issn=0001-4273}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art valuation is accomplished not only for collection, investment, divestment, and financing purposes, but as part of [[Estate (law)|estate]] valuations, for charitable contributions, for [[tax planning]], insurance, and loan [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]] purposes. This article deals with the valuation of works of [[fine art]], especially [[contemporary art]], at the top end of the international market, but similar principles apply to the valuation of less expensive art and [[antique]]s.

==Historic valuation and contemporary art==
The source of a work's artistic [[charisma]] has long been debated between artists who create and patrons who enable, but the charismatic power of artworks on those who would possess them is historically the initial driver of value.&lt;ref name="balfe"&gt;Balfe, Judith, Ed., Paying the piper: causes and consequences of art patronage, Univ. of Illinois Press, 1993, p.307. {{ISBN|978-0-252-06310-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jeffri"&gt;Jeffri, Joan, Philanthropy and the American artist: A historical overview, ''[[International Journal of Cultural Policy|The European Journal of Cultural Policy]]'', 3(2), 2009, pp. 207-233.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s that charismatic power started edging over to accommodate commercialized culture and a new industry of art, when aesthetic value fell from prominence to parity with [[Pop art]] and [[Andy Warhol]]'s idea of business art, a recognition that art has become a business and making money in business is an art.&lt;ref name="kuspit"&gt;Kuspit, Donald, [http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/features/kuspit/kuspit3-6-07.asp Art Values or Money Values?], ARTnet.com, 6 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeffri, Joan, ''Managing Uncertainty, The visual art market for contemporary art in the United States'', in Robertson, Iain, Understanding international art markets and management, Routledge, 2005, p. 127. {{ISBN|978-0-415-33956-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One of many artists to follow Warhol is [[Jeff Koons]], a stockbroker turned artist who also borrowed imagery from popular culture and made millions.&lt;ref name="littlejohn"&gt;Littlejohn, David, Who is Jeff Koons and Why Are People Saying Such Terrible Things About Him? ''Artnews'', April 1993, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="inflatable"&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/14941205 Inflatable investments, The volatile art of Jeff Koons], ''[[The Economist]]'', 28 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

For collectors, the emotional connection felt toward a work or collection creates subjective personal value.&lt;ref name="htValue"&gt;[http://www.artnet.com/auctions/pages/common/help/howtovalueart.aspx How to Value Art], artnet.com, retrieved 21 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The weight assigned by such a collector to that subjective measure as a portion of a work's overall financial value may be greater than that by an art speculator not sharing the collector's emotional investment, however, non-economic value measures such as "Do I like it?" or "Does it speak to me?" still have economic effect because such measures can be deciding factors in a purchase.&lt;ref name="campbellRAJ"&gt;Campbell, R.A.J., [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID978467_code230208.pdf?abstractid=978467&amp;rulid=6936564&amp;mirid=1 Art as a Financial Investment], Erasmus Univ., Rotterdam, Maastricht Univ., 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the Art Dealer's Association of America (ADAA) suggests that the key issues are authenticity, quality, rarity, condition, provenance and value. &lt;ref&gt;http://artdealers.org/sites/default/files/adaa_guide.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Valuing art==
[[File:Art Fair Enough Melbourne.jpg|380px|thumb|An art fair]]
Art valuation activity concerns itself with estimating market demand, estimating [[Market liquidity|liquidity]] capability of lots, works, and artists, the condition and [[provenance]] of works, and with valuation trends such as average sale price and mean estimates.&lt;ref name="artnetTrends"&gt;See artnet.com's [http://www.artnet.com/products/mt_faq.asp Market Trends FAQ].&lt;/ref&gt; As with other markets, the art market uses its own industry-specific [[Technical terminology|terms of art]] or vocabulary, for example, "bought-in", describing the disadvantageous situation occurring when a work or lot at auction is returned to its owner having been passed over, withdrawn or otherwise unsold.&lt;ref name="kendzulak"&gt;Kendzulak, Susan, definition of "[http://fineart.about.com/od/Glossary_B/g/Bought-In.htm Bought-In]", about.com. See also: [http://teachmefinance.com/Financial_Terms/Buying_in.html Buying in] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504231250/http://www.teachmefinance.com/Financial_Terms/Buying_in.html |date=2012-05-04 }}, teachmefinance.com. Accessed 20 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Valuing art is also necessary when a piece is to be used as collateral. The art-lending market has expanded to an estimated $15 billion to $19 billion of loans outstanding in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Art &amp; Finance Report 2016 |url=https://www2.deloitte.com/lu/en/pages/art-finance/articles/art-finance-report.html |website=Deloitte |publisher=Deloitte &amp; ArtTactic}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The shift in Asia towards investment in western art is a factor that has allowed art lending companies to launch offices in Asia as western works are often easier to use as collateral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ft.com/content/0b641fea-e17f-11e7-a8a4-0a1e63a52f9c |website=The Financial Times|title=London-based art fund targets $1bn lending in Asia}}&lt;/ref&gt;



===Market demand===
As in the housing market, "[[comparables]]" are used to determine what level of demand similar items have in a current market. The freshness of the comparables is important because the art market is fluid and stale comparables will yield estimates that may have little relation to a work's current value.&lt;ref name="htValue" /&gt; Subject matter and the [[List of artistic media|medium]] of a work also affect market demand, as does rarity.

===Liquidity===
Liquidity in the art market means having artworks in very high demand and being able to sell those works without impediment. Art sales slow in downturns resulting in the market becoming more illiquid. There is a greater degree of liquidity risk facing the art investor than with other financial assets because there is a limited pool of potential buyers, and with artworks not reaching their reserve prices and not being sold, this has an effect on the auction prices.&lt;ref name="campbellRAJ" /&gt; In a divorce action between a couple who sought to divide a $102 million collection between them, the couple decided a sale would prove problematic because selling the entire collection and dividing the profit would saturate the market and drive down prices; in reporting on the case, ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' described the case as a study on how people measure the value of art, and which counts for more — pragmatism or sentiment.&lt;ref name="seattle"&gt;Armstrong, Ken, [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2018791206_larson29m.html The art of divorce: She gets the Monet, he gets the Renoir] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120731233730/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2018791206_larson29m.html |date=31 July 2012 }}, Local News &amp;#124; ''The Seattle Times'', seattletimes.nwsource.com, 28 July 2012. Accessed 2012-7-30.&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper reported that one of the two litigants had a more sentimental view of the value of the works, while the other had a more businesslike view, wanting balance and diversification.&lt;ref name="seattle"/&gt; The newspaper attempted to calculate the value of the many artworks at issue in the case by determining a per-square-inch price based on each piece's value divided by its dimension, to end up with a per-square-inch price to apply to the amount of wall space the businesslike litigant wanted to cover with the available art.&lt;ref name="seattle"/&gt; ''The Times'' ultimately concluded that using this formula as between the litigants, [[John Singer Sargent]]'s ''Dans les Oliviers à Capri'' was valued at $26,666.67 per square inch, that the sentimental litigant received $3,082 of appraised value per square inch while the businesslike litigant received $1,942 per square inch, but could cover more wall space.&lt;ref name="seattle"/&gt;

===Valuation trends===
Trends for values from the world's top auction houses are compared for study of market direction and how that direction affects given artists and works.&lt;ref name="higgs"&gt;Higgs, H. and Worthington, A., [http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&amp;context=commpapers Financial Returns and Price Determinants in the Australian Art Market, 1973–2003], ''Economic Record'', 81:113–123, 2005-06. {{doi|10.1111/j.1475-4932.2005.00237.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="worthington"&gt;Worthington, AC and Higgs, H, [http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1022&amp;context=commpapers A Note on Financial Risk, Return and Asset Pricing in Australian Modern and Contemporary Art], ''Journal of Cultural Economics'', 30(3), March 2006, 73-84.&lt;/ref&gt; Valuations for art sold at the market's top houses usually carry more weight than valuations from less established houses, as most of the top houses have hundreds of years of experience.&lt;ref name="worthington" /&gt;&lt;ref name="topHouses"&gt;Kendzulak, Susan, [https://web.archive.org/web/20140412120752/http://fineart.about.com/od/AuctionHouses/tp/Fine-Art-Auction-Houses-Established-Auction-Houses-For-The-Fine-Arts.htm Top 11 Fine Art Auction Houses], About.com lists the top houses (as of April 2014, and this list is volatile) as:

Long term economic trends can have a great impact on the valuation of certain types of work. In recent decades the values of historic Russian and Chinese art have greatly benefited from increased wealth in those countries creating new and very rich collectors, as the values of [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] and [[Islamic art]] had earlier been boosted by oil wealth in the Arab world.

===Participant activity===
One of many factors in the primary market's price of a living artist's work is a dealer's contract with an artist: many dealers, as stakeholders in their artists' success, agree to buy their own stable of artists' work at auction in order to prevent price drops, to maintain price stability, or to increase perceived value, or all three, thus dealers bidding on their own artists at auction have a direct impact on the selling price for those artists' works and as a result, the valuation of those works.&lt;ref name="castles"&gt;[[Castlestone Management]], [http://i1.exhibit-e.com/collectionofmodernart/ce63a3fb.pdf Major Structural Themes Influencing the Art Market]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ThorntonOnHirst"&gt;Thornton, Sarah, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110615112418/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/visual_arts/article6857843.ece The reinvention of artist Damien Hirst], ''The Sunday Times'', 2009-10-04, Retrieved 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research data===
Research data available from art auction houses such as Christie's, Sotheby's, [[Phillips (auctioneers)|Phillips]], [[Bonhams]], and [[Lyon &amp; Turnbull]] are those tracking [[market trend]]s such as yearly lot transactions, bought-in statistics, sales volume, price levels, and pre-auction estimates.&lt;ref name="MondianReport"&gt;For an example see artnet.com's sample report: [http://www.artnet.com/products/MT_sample.pdf Market Performance Report for Piet Mondian].&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also companies such as [[ArtTactic]] utilizing art auction data as providers of art market research analysis.&lt;ref name="arttactic"&gt;For example, arttactic's monthly [http://www.arttactic.com/newsletters.php Rawfacts newsletter] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708175114/http://www.arttactic.com/newsletters.php |date=8 July 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Information available from internet-based art sale history databases generally does not include the condition of a work, a very important factor,&lt;ref name="htValue" /&gt; therefore the prices quoted in those databases reflect auction hammer price without other, crucial valuation factors. Additionally, the databases of auctioned work do not cover private sales of works, and thus their use for art valuation is but one source among many needed for determining value.&lt;ref name="campbellRAJ" /&gt;

===General valuation factors===
Valuation estimates by auction houses are typically given in ranges of prices to offset uncertainty. Generally, estimates are made by looking at what a comparable piece of art sold for recently, with estimates given in a range of prices rather than one fixed figure,&lt;ref name="phillips"&gt;de Pury, Simon, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110715074548/http://www.phillipsartexpert.com/ask_simon/ FAQ #13].&lt;/ref&gt; and in the case of [[contemporary art]] especially, having few comparables or when an artist is not well known and has no auction history, the risks of incorrect valuation are greatest.

One potential factor in valuation are the seller's reasons for selling a particular work and/or the buyer's reasons for buying, neither of which may have anything to do with the other. For example, a seller may be motivated by financial need, boredom with a particular artwork, or the desire to raise funds for a different purchase.&lt;ref name="nprCornish"&gt;Cornish, Audie, [https://www.npr.org/2012/10/03/162246654/wealthy-use-art-collections-as-way-to-a-better-loan Wealthy Use Art Collections As Way To A Better Loan], [[NPR]], npr.org, 3 October 2012. Accessed 29 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Common motivations include the so-called three D's: death, debt and divorce. Buyers may be motivated by market excitement, may be acting in accord with a collection plan, or buying like buyers of stock: to drive value up or down either for themselves or for another person. 

One method for pricing pieces by new artists of uncertain value is to ignore aesthetics and consider, besides market trends, three semi-commoditized aspects: "scale" - size and level of detail, "intensity" - effort, and "medium" - quality of the materials.&lt;ref name="shark"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100630230248/http://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=128084948 Why A Dead Shark Costs $12 Million], NPR, npr.org, 25 June 2010. Accessed 2010-07-27. Archived from the original at archive.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

Valuing artworks in such a specialized market, therefore, takes into account a wide variety of factors, some indeed in conflict with each other.

==Valuation for tax and other law-related purposes==
In the United States, art bought and sold by collectors is treated as a [[capital asset]] for tax purposes,&lt;ref&gt;Capital asset defined: 26 U.S.C. [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1221 § 1221], Legal Information Institute, law.cornell.edu. Accessed 14 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and disputes relating to the valuation of art or the nature of [[Gain (finance)|gain]] on its sale are usually decided by the federal [[United States Tax Court|Tax Court]], and sometimes by other courts applying federal tax law to specific cases.

===Important U.S. cases===

'''Atanas Hristov Dalchev''' (also written ''Dalčev'' {{lang-bg|Атанас Далчев}}) (June 12, 1904 - January 17, 1978) was a [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] [[poet]], [[critic]] and [[translator]]. He is an author of poetry that brightly touches some philosophical problems. He translated poetry and fiction from French, Spanish, English, German and Russian authors. Recipient of the [[Herder Prize]] in 1972 (for his "...all over literary work...") and order "Znak Pocheta" (or [[Order of the Badge of Honor]]) in 1967 (for popularisation of Russian culture in Bulgaria).

He was born in [[Thessaloniki]] (Solun) in [[Salonica Vilayet]] and graduated from high school in [[Sofia]] in 1922.  His father [[Hristo Dalchev]] was a lawyer and as a MP from [[People's Federative Party (Bulgarian Section)]] represеnted  [[Macedonian Bulgarians|Bulgarians]] from [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] in the [[Ottoman parliament]]. 
[[Image:Atanas Dalcev's Herder Prize 1972.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Atanas Dalchev's [[Herder Prize]], 1972]]
In 1926, Dalchev published his first collection called ''Prozorets'' ("Window") and graduated in [[pedagogics]] and [[philosophy]] at [[Sofia University]] in 1927. Dalchev published the collections of poetry ''Stihotvorenia'' ("Poems", 1928) and ''Paris'' (1930). From 1945 until 1956, he was under pressure from the communist authorities and was forced to publish only translations.

He died in Sofia in 1978.

His works has been translated in French, Slovak, Czech, Hungarian, Russian, German, Italian, Polish, French, Spanish, and also in English, Turkish, Chinese, Japanese, Arabian, Swedish and some other languages in periodic or in literary medleys.

'''Beit Guvrin-Maresha National Park''' is a national park in central [[Israel]], 13 kilometers from [[Kiryat Gat]], encompassing the ruins of [[Maresha]], one of the important towns of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] during the time of the [[First Temple]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Guide to Israel'', [[Zev Vilnay]], Tel Aviv, 1972, p.281&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Eleutheropolis|Beit Guvrin]], an important town in the Roman era, when it was known as [[Eleutheropolis]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Guide to Israel'', [[Zev Vilnay]], Tel Aviv, 1972, p.275&lt;/ref&gt; 

Archaeological artifacts unearthed at the site include a large Jewish cemetery, a Roman-Byzantine amphitheater, a Byzantine church, public baths, mosaics and burial caves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gemsinisrael.com/e_article000012102.htm Bell Cave at Beit Guvrin] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129115552/http://www.gemsinisrael.com/e_article000012102.htm |date=January 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|Maresha|Eleutheropolis}}
[[File:Maresha 027.jpg|thumb|Maresha dwellings]]
The earliest written record of [[Maresha]] was as a city in ancient [[Tribe of Judah|Judah]] (Joshua 15:44). The [[Hebrew Bible]] mentions among other episodes that [[Rehoboam]] fortified it against Egyptian attack. After the destruction of the [[Kingdom of Judah]] the city of Maresha became part of the [[Edom]]ite kingdom. In the late [[Persia]]n period a [[Sidonian]] community settled in Maresha, and the city is mentioned in the [[Zenon Papyri]] (259 BC). During the [[Maccabean Revolt]], Maresha was a base for attacks against Judea and suffered retaliation from the [[Maccabees]]. After [[Hasmonean]] king, [[John Hyrcanus]] I captured and destroyed Maresha in 112 BCE, the region of Idumea remained under Hasmonean control. In 40 BC the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]] devastated completely the "strong cite", after which it was never rebuilt. 
 
''Beth Gabra'' or ''Beit Guvrin'' succeeded Maresha as the main town of the area. Conquered by the Roman general [[Vespasian]] during the [[First Jewish–Roman War|Jewish War]] (68 CE) and completely destroyed during the [[Bar Kochba rebellion|Bar Kochba revolt]] (132–135 CE), it was re-established as a Roman colony and in the year 200 it received the title of a city and the ''[[Ius Italicum|ius italicum]]'', under the new name of "Eleutheropolis", 'city of freemen'. Sources from the Byzantine Period mention both Christian and Jewish personalities living in the city.

==History of archaeological excavations==
{{see|Bayt Jibrin#Archaeology}}
[[Maresha]] was first excavated in 1898-1900 by [[Frederick J. Bliss|Bliss]] and [[R. A. Stewart Macalister|Macalister]], who uncovered a planned and fortified [[Hellenistic]] city encircled by a town wall with towers. Two Hellenistic and one [[Israelite]] [[Stratigraphy (archaeology)|stratum]] were identified by them on the mound. Many of the ancient city's olive presses, [[columbarium|columbaria]] and water cisterns can still be seen.
 
Both Maresha and Beit Guvrin/[[Eleutheropolis]] were excavated after 1989 and 1992 respectively by the Israeli archaeologist [[Amos Kloner]]. Important finds at the latter site were the amphitheatre built by the Roman army units stationed there, a large Roman bath house, and from the Crusader period a fortress integrating the walls of the Roman amphitheatre and bath house, as well as an attached church.

==Archaeological remains==
===Burial caves===
[[File:Sidonian Burial Caves 036.jpg|thumb|Sidonian burial caves]]The Sidonian burial caves were the family tomb of Apollophanes, the leader of the Sidonian community in Beit Guvrin. The Sidonian caves are the only ones that are painted inside. The caves were burial caves for the Greek, Sidonian and Edumite inhabitants of Beit Guvrin. The first and largest cave has paintings of animals, real and mythic, above the niches where the corpses were laid. A cock crows to scare away [[demons]]; the three-headed dog [[Cerberus]] guards the entrance to the [[underworld]]; a bright red phoenix symbolizes the life after death.&lt;ref&gt;For a description of the paintings in the tomb of Apollophanes, see John P. Peeters and Herman Theirsch, ''[https://archive.org/details/paintedtombsinne00pete Painted Tombs in the Necropolis of Marissa]'' (London: Palestine Exploration Fund, 1905).&lt;/ref&gt; The Tomb of the Musicians is decorated with a painting showing a  man playing the flute and a woman playing the harp.

===Bell caves===
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 1762 Archeological sites of Israel המערה הפולנית.JPG|thumb|Bell cave with columbarium]]
There are about 800 bell-shaped caves located in the area. Many of the caves are linked via an underground network of passageways that connect groups of 40–50 caves. 

The largest bell caves are in the east part of the park. They were dug during the Early Arab Period for [[chalk]] to cover roads.{{dubious|Chalk for roads? For ballerinas to tiptoe on? No source indicated, and many medieval sources aren't very reliable.|date=February 2017}}{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} The walls are beige-colored limestone.{{dubious|Chalk...? Both are CaCO3, but what a difference!|date=February 2017}} There are numerous bell caves within the park grounds and events are held in one of them. They are large (over {{convert|60|ft|m}} high), airy and easily accessible.

===The Church of Saint Anne===
Saint Anne's church was first built in the Byzantine period and then rebuilt by the Crusaders in the 12th century. The ruin is known in Arabic as Khirbet (lit. "ruin") Sandahanna, the nearby [[tell (archaeology)|tell]] (mound) of Maresha being called Tell Sandahanna.&lt;ref&gt;''The Holy Land: An Archeological Guide from Earliest Times to 1700'', Jerome Murphy-O'Connor, 1980, p.145&lt;/ref&gt; The freestanding remains of the apse are well preserved (see photo).

===Amphitheater===
The remains of a Roman amphitheater were uncovered in the mid-1990s. The amphitheater was built in the 2nd century, on the northwestern outskirts of Beit Guvrin. This amphitheater, in which gladiatorial contests took place, could seat about 3,500 spectators. It had a walled arena of packed earth, with subterranean galleries. The arena was surrounded by a series of connected barrel vaults, which formed a long, circular corridor and supported the stone seats above it; staircases led from the outside and from the circular corridor to the tribunes. It was built for the Roman troops stationed in the region after the suppression of the [[Bar Kochba rebellion]]. The amphitheater is an elliptical structure built of large rectangular [[limestone]] ashlars. It was in use until destroyed in the [[Galilee earthquake of 363]].{{dubious|Wasn't it reassigned as a market in Christian (Byzantine) times?|date=February 2017}}{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Mosaics===
[[File:Beyt-Govrin-3-443.jpg|thumb|The ruins of the Church of St Anne, called Sandahanna in Arabic.]]
Byzantine mosaics depicting birds and animals were discovered on the hilltop in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;''The Guide to Israel'', [[Zev Vilnay]], Tel Aviv, 1972, p.276&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Blackfoot language''', also called '''Siksiká''' (ᓱᖽᐧᖿ, its denomination in [[ISO 639-3]]), ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|s|iː|k|ˈ|s|iː|k|ə}}; &lt;small&gt;Siksiká&lt;/small&gt; [[Help:IPA|[siksiká]]], &lt;small&gt;[[Blackfoot language#Writing system|syllabics]]&lt;/small&gt; {{lang|bla|'''ᓱᖽᐧᖿ'''}}), often anglicised as '''''{{lang|bla|Siksika}}''''', is an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] language spoken by the [[Blackfoot Confederacy|Blackfoot]] or ''Niitsitapi'' people, who currently live in the northwestern plains of [[North America]]. There are four dialects, three of which are spoken in [[Alberta]], Canada, and one of which is spoken in the United States: ''Siksiká'' (Blackfoot), to the southeast of Calgary, Alberta; ''Kainai'' (Blood, Many Chiefs), spoken in Alberta between Cardston and Lethbridge; ''Aapátohsipikani'' (Northern Piegan), to the west of Fort MacLeod; and ''Aamsskáápipikani'' (Southern Piegan), in northwestern [[Montana]].&lt;ref&gt;Frantz "The Blackfoot Language"&lt;/ref&gt; The name Blackfoot probably comes from the blackened soles of the leather shoes that the people wore.&lt;ref name="Gibson 2003"&gt;Gibson 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a distinct difference between Old Blackfoot (also called High Blackfoot), the dialect spoken by many older speakers, and New Blackfoot (also called Modern Blackfoot), the dialect spoken by younger speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Bortolin &amp; McLennan 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Among the [[Algonquian languages]], Blackfoot is relatively divergent in phonology and lexicon.&lt;ref&gt;Mithun 1999, p. 335&lt;/ref&gt; The language has a fairly small phoneme inventory; consisting of 11 basic consonants and three basic vowels that have contrastive length counterparts. Blackfoot is a [[pitch accent]] language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miyashita|first=Mizuki|last2=Fish|first2=Naatosi|date=12 Mar 2015|title=Documenting Blackfoot pitch excursion|url=https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10125/25290|journal=|volume=|pages=|hdl=10125/25290}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Frantz 2017, p. 3"&gt;Frantz 2017, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Blackfoot language has been declining in the number of native speakers and is classified as either a threatened or endangered language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/1677|title=Did you know Blackfoot is endangered?|website=Endangered Languages|language=en|access-date=2017-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the other Algonquian languages, Blackfoot is considered to be a [[polysynthetic language]] due to its large morpheme inventory and word internal complexity.&lt;ref&gt;Aikhenvald 2007, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; A majority of Blackfoot morphemes have a one to one correspondence between form and meaning, a defining feature of [[agglutinative language]]s. However, Blackfoot does display some [[Fusional language|fusional]] characteristics as there are morphemes that are polysemous.&lt;ref&gt;Armoskaite 2011, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Both noun and verb stems cannot be used bare but must be inflected.&lt;ref&gt;Frantz 2017, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its morphological complexity, Blackfoot has a flexible [[word order]].

== Classification ==
Blackfoot is a member of the Algonquian language belonging to the [[Plains Algonquian languages|Plains]] branch along with [[Arapaho language|Arapaho]], [[Gros Ventre language|Gros Ventre]], and [[Cheyenne language|Cheyenne]]. Blackfoot is spoken in Northwestern Montana and throughout Alberta, Canada, making it geographically one of the westernmost Algonquian languages.

== History ==
Once, the Blackfoot people were one of a few Native American nations, that inhabited the Great Plains west of the Mississippi river. The people were buffalo hunters, with settlements in the northern United States. Forced to move because of wars with neighboring tribes, the Blackfoot people settled all around the plains area and up into Canada, eventually concentrating in Montana. Blackfoot hunters would track and hunt game, while the remaining people would gather food, and other necessities for the winter. The northern plains, where the Blackfoot settled, had incredibly harsh winters, and the flat land provided little escape from the winds. The Blackfoot Nation thrived, along with many other native groups, until the European settlers arrived in the late eighteenth century. The settlers brought with them horses and technology, but also disease and weapons. Diseases like smallpox, foreign to the natives, decimated the Blackfoot population in the mid-nineteenth century. Groups of Blackfoot people rebelled against the Europeans like Mountain Chief's tribe. But, in 1870, a tribe of peaceful Blackfoot were mistaken for the rebellious tribe and hundreds were slaughtered. Over the next thirty years, the settlers had eradicated the buffalo from the Great Plains. This took away the main element of Blackfoot life and took away the people's ability to be self-sustaining. With their main food source gone, the Blackfoot were forced to rely on government support.&lt;ref name="Gibson 2003"/&gt;

== Phonology ==

===Consonants===
Blackfoot has eighteen consonants, of which all but {{IPA|/ʔ/}}, {{IPA|/x/}}, {{IPA|/j/}} and {{IPA|/w/}} form pairs distinguished by length.&lt;ref name="nlguide2"&gt;[http://www.native-languages.org/blackfoot_guide.htm "Blackfoot Pronunciation and Spelling Guide"]. Native-Languages.org. Retrieved 2007-04-10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="f1999"&gt;Frantz 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vowels===

==== Monophthongs ====
Blackfoot has a vowel system with three [[monophthong]]s, {{IPA|/i o a/}}.&lt;ref name="nlguide2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="f1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="f2017 1 2"&gt;Frantz 2017, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
!
! colspan="2" |[[Front vowel|Front]]
! colspan="2" |[[Central vowel|Central]]
! colspan="2" |[[Back vowel|Back]]
|-
![[Close vowel|High]]
| style="border-right:0" |{{IPA|i}}
| style="border-left:0" |{{IPA|iː}}
| colspan="2" |
| style="border-right:0" |{{IPA|o}}
| style="border-left:0" |{{IPA|oː}}
|-
![[Open vowel|Low]]
| colspan="2" |
| style="border-right:0" |{{IPA|a}}
| style="border-left:0" |{{IPA|aː}}
| colspan="2" |
|}
The short [[monophthong]]s exhibit [[Allophone|allophonic]] changes as well. The vowels {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} are raised to {{IPA|[ʌ]}} and {{IPA|[ʊ]}} respectively when followed by a long consonant. The vowel /i/ becomes {{IPA|[ɪ]}} in closed syllables.&lt;ref name="f2017 1 2"/&gt;

==== Diphthongs ====
There are three additional [[diphthong]]s in Blackfoot. The first diphthong '''ai''' is pronounced {{IPA|[ɛ]}} before a long consonant, {{IPA|[ei]}} (or {{IPA|[ai]}}, in the dialect of the Blackfoot Reserve) before {{IPA|/i/}} or {{IPA|/ʔ/}}, and elsewhere is pronounced {{IPA|[æ]}} in the Blood Reserve dialect or {{IPA|[ei]}} in the Blackfoot Reserve dialect. The second diphthong '''ao''' is pronounced {{IPA|[au]}} before {{IPA|/ʔ/}} and {{IPA|[ɔ]}} elsewhere. The third diphthong '''oi''' may be pronounced [y] before a long consonant and as {{IPA|/oi/}} elsewhere .&lt;ref&gt;Frantz 2017, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Length ===
[[Vowel length|Length]] is contrastive in Blackfoot for both vowels and consonants. Vowel length refers to the duration of a vowel and not a change in quality. The vowel /oo/ is therefore the same sound as /o/ only differing in the length of time over which it is produced.&lt;ref name="Frantz 2017, p. 3" /&gt;
: {|
|''áak'''o'''kaawa''
|
|
|&lt;nowiki/&gt;'he will rope'
|-
|''áak'''oo'''kaawa''
|
|
|&lt;nowiki/&gt;'she will sponsor a Sundance'
|}
Consonants can also be lengthened with the exception of  {{IPA|/ʔ/}}, {{IPA|/x/}}, {{IPA|/j/}} and {{IPA|/w/}}.
: {|
|''kiipí'''pp'''o''
|

|
|
|&lt;nowiki/&gt;'my father'
|-
|''soká'p'''ss'''iwa''
|
|
|&lt;nowiki/&gt;'he is good'
|}

=== Pitch accent ===
Blackfoot is a [[pitch accent]] language and it is a contrastive feature in the language. Every word will have at least one high pitched vowel or diphthong but may have more than one. Note that high pitch here is used relative to the contiguous syllables. Blackfoot utterances experience a gradual drop in pitch therefore if an utterance contains a set of accented vowels the first will be higher in pitch than the second but the second will be higher in pitch than the syllables directly surrounding it. Pitch is illustrated in the Latin-based orthography with an acute accent.&lt;ref name="Frantz 2017, p. 3"/&gt;
: {|
|''ápssiwa''
|
|
|&lt;nowiki/&gt;'it's an arrow'
|-
|''apssíwa''

|&lt;nowiki/&gt;'it's a fig'
|-
|''máátaissikópiiwa''
|
|
|&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s/he's not resting'
|}

=== Phonological rules ===
Blackfoot is rich with morpho-phonological changes. Below is a limited sample of phonological rules.

==== Semi-vowel loss ====
Glides are deleted after another consonant, except a glottal stop, or word initially but kept in other conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Frantz 2017, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;
: {|
|
|&lt;small&gt;/w/ loss&lt;/small&gt;
|
|-
|''poos-wa''
!→
|''póósa''
|-
|cat-AN.SG
|
|&lt;nowiki/&gt;'cat'
|-

|-
|''w-óko'si''
!→
|''óko'si''
|-
|3.SG.POSS-child
|
|&lt;nowiki/&gt;'his/her child'
|}

==== Accent spread ====
Accent will spread from an accented vowel to the following vowel across morpheme boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;Frantz 2017, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;
: {|
|''á-okska'siwa''
|→
|''áókska'siwa''
|
|
|&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s/he runs'
|-
|''atsikí-istsi''
|→
|''atsikíístsi''
|
|
|&lt;nowiki/&gt;'shoes'
|}

==== Vowel devoicing ====
At the end of a word, non-high pitched vowels are devoiced, regardless of length.&lt;ref&gt;Frantz 2017, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar – general==
===Lexical categories===

Lexical categories in Blackfoot are a matter of debate in the literature, with the exception of nouns and verbs. Additional proposed categories, proposed by Uhlenbeck, are adjectives, pronouns, adverbs, and particles.&lt;ref&gt;Uhlenbeck (1938)&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor classifies the Blackfoot language as having two major classes, substantives (nouns and pronouns) and verbs, with one minor class consisting of particles.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1953)&lt;/ref&gt; Frantz classifies adjectives and adverbs as affixes but not independent classes.&lt;ref&gt;Frantz 2017, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agreement ===
Agreement morphology is extensive in Blackfoot and agreement morphemes are often polysemous, i.e. animacy and number (nouns) or person and number (verbs) are indicated within the same affix.

====Animacy====
All nouns are required to be inflected for animacy and are classified as either animate or inanimate. Verbs are inflected to match the animacy of its arguments. Animacy in Blackfoot is a grammatical construct for noun classification. Therefore, some semantically inherently inanimate objects, such as drums and knives are grammatically animate.&lt;ref name="Frantz 2017, p. 7-10"&gt;Frantz 2017, pp. 7–10&lt;/ref&gt;

Verbs are marked with a transitivity marker which must agree with the animacy of its arguments. Even in stories in which a grammatically inanimate object are markedly anthropomorphized, such as talking flowers, speakers will not use animate agreement markers with them.

==== Number ====
All nouns are required to be inflected as either singular or plural. Verbal inflection matches the plurality of its arguments.&lt;ref name="Frantz 2017, p. 7-10"/&gt;

==== Person marking ====
Blackfoot has five grammatical persons&amp;nbsp;– first, second, third (proximate), fourth (obviative), and fifth (sub-obviative).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frantz|first=Donald G.|date=1966-01-01|title=Person Indexing in Blackfoot|jstor=1263448|journal=International Journal of American Linguistics|volume=32|issue=1|pages=50–58|doi=10.1086/464879}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Word order ===
Word order is flexible in Blackfoot. Subjects are not required to precede the verb.&lt;ref&gt;Frantz 2017, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Independent noun phrases may be included but these are typically dropped in Blackfoot due to the extensive person inflection on the verb they aren't necessary to interpret the meaning of the utterance. However, if first or second person pronouns are present it yields an emphatic reading.&lt;ref name="Frantz 2017, p. 22"&gt;Frantz 2017, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; There is an ordering restriction if the Distinct Third Person (DTP) attached pronoun /-aawa/ is used in which the subject independent noun phrase must occur before the verb. If the independent noun phrase occurs after the verb then the DTP may not be used.&lt;ref&gt;Frantz 2017, pp. 48–49&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Subjecthood ===
Blackfoot nouns must be grammatically particular in order to be a subject of a verb.&lt;ref name="Frantz 2017, p. 22"/&gt; In transitive constructions the subject must be volitional to be interpreted as subject.&lt;ref&gt;Frantz 2017, pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Person hierarchy ===
It has been asserted that Blackfoot, along with other Algonquian languages violates the Universal Person Hierarchy in verb complexes by ranking second person over first person. The hierarchy has traditionally been published as 2nd person &gt; 1st person &gt; 3rd person (proximate) &gt; 4th person (obviative).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Russell|first=Lena|last2=Genee|first2=Inge|last3=Lier|first3=Eva van|last4=Zúñiga|first4=Fernando|title=Referential Hierarchies in Three-Participant Constructions in Blackfoot: The Effects of Animacy, Person, and Specificity|url=http://journals.dartmouth.edu/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Journals.woa/xmlpage/1/article/416|journal=Linguistic Discovery|volume=10|issue=3|doi=10.1349/ps1.1537-0852.a.416|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, alternative analyses of Blackfoot person hierarchy has been published that suggest the Universal Person Hierarchy is applicable to Blackfoot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bliss|first=Heather|last2=Jesney|first2=Karen|date=May 2005|title=Resolving hierarchy conflict: local obviation in Blackfoot*|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1880/51468|journal=Calgary Working Papers in Linguistics|volume=26|pages=92–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verbal structure===
The Blackfoot verbal template contains a stem with several prefixes and suffixes. The structure of the verb stem in Blackfoot can be roughly broken down into the pre-verb, the root, the medial, and the final. The root and final are required elements.

Generally, information encoded in the pre-verb can include adverbs, most pronouns, locatives, manners, aspect, mood, and tense. Incorporated objects appear in the medial. The final includes transitivity and animacy markers, and valency markers.

== Grammar – nouns ==

=== Agreement morphology ===
Noun classes are split based on [[grammatical gender]] into two categories: animate and inanimate.&lt;ref&gt;Frantz 2017, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, all nouns must be marked for plurality. Plurality agreement are suffixes that attach to noun stems and take four forms, as shown in the table below.&lt;ref name="Frantz 2017, p. 7-10"/&gt;
:{| class="wikitable"
! colspan="2" |Inanimate
! rowspan="3" |
! colspan="2" |Animate
|-
|Singular
|Plural

|-
|''í'ksisako-istsi''
|→
|''í'ksisakoistsi''
||||||&lt;nowiki&gt;''meats'&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|}

=== Proximate and obviative ===
When a sentence contains two or more particular animate gender nouns as arguments proximate (major third person/3rd) and obviative (minor third person/4th) markings are used to disambiguate. There may only be one proximate argument in any given sentence but multiple obviates are permissible. Proximate arguments are more prominent in discourse. Redirectional markers, referred to as inverse and direct theme in the literature, can be applied to indicate that the fourth person is the subject argument.&lt;ref&gt;Frantz 2017, pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Particularity/referentiality ===
Blackfoot nouns must be grammatically particular, according to Frantz (2009), in order to be a subject of a verb. To be the subject of any verb in Blackfoot the noun must point to a specific referent in the world. In transitive constructions the subject must also be volitional to be interpreted as subject. If subject of a transitive verb is non-specific or non-volitional then verb must be inflected as having an unspecified subject.&lt;ref&gt;Frantz 2017, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grammar – verbs ==

=== Verbal morphology template ===
There are four verb categories in Blackfoot: intransitive inanimate, intransitive animate, transitive inanimate, and transitive animate. The parameters of transitivity and animacy for verb selection are typically referred to as stem agreement in order to delineate it from person agreement. The animacy for intransitive verbs is determined by the subject of the verb whereas the transitive verbs are defined by the animacy of their primary object.&lt;ref&gt;Frantz 2017, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

The only required component of a clause in Blackfoot is the verb, referred to as a verbal complex in the Algonquian literature, that must be appropriately inflected according to the standard template:		 	

&lt;blockquote&gt;preverb – root – medial – final&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Preverbs are prefixes which encode adverbs, most pronouns, locatives, manners, aspect, mood, and tense. Medials are suffixes which primarily encode manner and incorporated objects. Finals are suffixes which encode transitivity, animacy, and valency. Roots and finals are always required in a verbal complex whereas preverb and medials are not.&lt;ref&gt;Armoskaite 2011, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inverse and direct theme ===
When there are two animate arguments acting in a transitive animate verb stem one of the arguments must be acting on the other. Which argument is the actor (subject) and which is the acted upon (object) is indicated by the use of direct or inverse theme marking. If a subject argument is higher than the object argument on the person hierarchy then the direct suffix is used. Conversely, when an object outranks the sentences subject then the inverse suffix is used.&lt;ref&gt;Frantz 2017, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

:{|
! colspan="2" |Direct
|-
|Nitsikákomimmayi 
|nitániksi.
|-

|-
|1.SG-love-INV-3.PL
|1.POSS-daughter-AN.PL
|-
|'My daughters love me.'
|
|}

=== Voice and valency ===
Blackfoot voice alterations occur as suffixes on the verb and fall into the category of finals. Finals can include causative, benefactive, reciprocal, and reflexive affixes that either decrease or increase the valency of the stem they are attached too. Below is an example of the reflexive final suffix. It can only be added to a transitive animate stem and results in an animate intranstive stem. This is then interpreted as being a reflexive verb, where the subject of the AI stem is understood to be the both the underlying subject and object of the original verb stem.&lt;ref&gt;Frantz 2017, pp. 100–107&lt;/ref&gt;

|‘That dog bit itself.’
|
|
|
|}

=== Relative clauses ===
Relative clauses are rare in Blackfoot but they do occur. In order to embed a clause you first need to nominalize the clause. The reclassification strategy for nominalization is displayed here followed by a relative clause that uses a nominal formed by this strategy. Reclassification is done by adding nominal inflection to the verb stem instead of person inflection. This derived form then refers to the underlying subject and agrees in both number and animacy.&lt;ref&gt;Frantz 2017, pp. 114–129&lt;/ref&gt;

:{|

|-

Examples below show how a reclassifation nominalized clause is used in a relative clause. Note the nominal agreement morphology on the verb matches the subject, singular and plural, respectively.

==Orthography{{anchor|Writing System}}==

===Latin-based orthography===

The Siksiká, Kainai, and Aapátohsipikani reserves adopted a standardized roman-based orthography in 1975. The Blackfoot alphabet consists of 13 letters.&lt;ref name="Frantz 2017, p. 163"&gt;Frantz 2017, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

Vowels can be marked with an acute accent or underlined to illustrate pitch accent. Vowels and consonants that are long are written with a double letter (aa = a:).&lt;ref name="Frantz 2017, p. 163"/&gt;

===Syllabic Writing System===

A [[Canadian Aboriginal syllabics|syllabics]] script, ᑯᖾᖹ ᖿᐟᖻ ᓱᖽᐧᖿ ''pikoni kayna siksika,'' was created by Anglican missionary [[John William Tims]] around 1888. Although conceptually nearly identical to [[Western Cree syllabics]], the letter forms are innovative. Two series ''(s, y)'' were taken from Cree but given different vowel values; three more ''(p, t, m)'' were changed in consonant values as well, according to the Latin letter they resembled; and the others ''(k, n, w)'' were created from asymmetrical parts of Latin and Greek letters; or in the case of the [[zero consonant]], possibly from the musical notation for [[quarter note]]. The Latin orientation of the letters is used for the ''e'' series, after the names of the Latin letters, ''pe, te,'' etc.

{|class=wikitable
!Blackfoot!!Latin source
|-

|-
| ᒋ ''me'' || '''m'''
|-
| ᖸ ''ne'' || '''N'''
|-
| ᖴ ''we'' || [[digamma]] '''Ϝ'''
|}

The direction for each vowel is different from Cree, reflecting Latin alphabetic order. The ''e'' orientation is used for the diphthong {{IPA|/ai/}}. Symbols for consonants are taken from the consonant symbol minus the stem, except for diphthongs (''Ca'' plus {{angle bracket|ᐠ}} for ''Cau'', and ''Ca'' plus {{angle bracket|ᐟ}} for ''Coi'', though there are also cases of writing subphonemic {{IPA|[ai, ei, eu]}} with these finals).

There are additional finals: allophones {{angle bracket|ᑊ}} {{IPA|[h]}} and {{angle bracket|ᐦ}} {{IPA|[x]}}, and three medials: {{angle bracket|ᖿᐧ}} ''ksa'', {{angle bracket|ᒣᐧ}} ''tsa'', {{angle bracket|ᖿᑉ}} ''kya'', {{angle bracket|ᖿᙾ}} ''kwa''.

{{angle bracket|᙮}} is used for a period.

Also sometimes it is written in Latin letters but with different spelling on computers because not all computers support the letters used in the Blackfoot language.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

== Revitalization efforts ==
In the late 1900s,{{clarify|date=September 2014}} many tribes began a surge of revitalization efforts to encourage cultural awareness of indigenous customs and traditions. Of these, the Blackfoot revitalization effort has proven to be quite successful, producing various institutions, including a college dedicated to preserving and promoting Blackfoot traditions. Today, there are head-start programs in primary and secondary schools on the reservation to teach even infants and toddlers about the history of the tribe from an early age.

=== The Piegan Institute ===
In 1987, Dorothy Still Smoking and Darrell Robes Kipp founded the Piegan Institute,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pieganinstitute.org |title=The Piegan Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; a private 501 c 3 non-profit foundation in Montana dedicated to researching, promoting, and preserving the Native American Languages, particularly the Blackfoot language. Piegan Institute founded Nizipuhwahsin (also Nizi Puh Wah Sin or Niitsípuwahsin or Cuts Wood) School in 1995 as a Blackfoot language K–8 immersion school. Since its inception the school has grown and relocated to the center of Browning, Montana in a custom built school house. Recently, some of the school's first graduates have returned to teach the newest generation the Blackfeet language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pieganinstitute.org/community.html|title=Cuts Wood Academy – Blackfoot Immersion School in Browning, Montana|work=The Piegan Institute|accessdate=2014-04-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413144251/http://www.pieganinstitute.org/community.html|archive-date=2014-04-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Blackfoot Community College ===
Blackfoot Community College (BCC), founded in 1974, is a two-year, nationally accredited college that was made possible by the Indian Education Act of 1972 and the 1964 Act enacted by the Office of Economic Opportunity. BCC is a member of both the American Indian Higher Education Consortium and the American Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES). It allows teenagers and adults alike to take classes in a wide range of subjects, from classes in Psychology and Digital Photography to classes on Blackfoot language and tradition. They have beginning Blackfoot language classes with labs for members and non-members of the community to learn the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Blackfoot Papers|last=Hungry-wolf|first=Adolf|publisher=Good Medicine Cultural Foundation|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chief Mountain Technologies ===
In order to create jobs for the Blackfoot people with real-world applications, the Blackfeet Tribal Business Council launched a company called Chief Mountain Technologies in 2009. This company gives tribal members the opportunity to work in the fields of computer science and business in Browning, Montana on behalf of various government organizations. The establishment of this company in the Blackfoot community allows the people to use their culture and their language in the modern world while maintaining their traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Blackfoot history and culture|last=Stout|first=Mary|date=2012|publisher=Gareth Stevens Pub|isbn=9781433959561|oclc=698361313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio programming in Blackfoot===
Radio station KBWG in [[Browning, Montana]], broadcasts a one-hour show for Blackfoot language learners four times a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kfbb.com/news/local/KBWG-Brings-Blackfoot-Language-to-Airwaves-119887639.html|title=KBWG Brings Blackfoot Language Lessons to the Airwaves|last=Stephanie Tyrpak|date=2011-04-14|work=KFBB.com|accessdate=2012-09-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110419103436/http://www.kfbb.com/news/local/KBWG-Brings-Blackfoot-Language-to-Airwaves-119887639.html|archivedate=2011-04-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Voice of Browning, Thunder Radio, FM 107.5, or "Ksistsikam ayikinaan" (literally "voice from nowhere") went live in 2010, and focuses on positive programming. In 2011, John Davis, a 21-year-old [[Blackfeet Community College]] student explained "I was the first Blackfeet to ever talk on this radio", Davis said. "This is my [[Counting coup|coup story]]." A story in the [[Great Falls Tribune]] noted, "When the station was replaying programming that originated elsewhere, the radio was all '[[There's a Tear in My Beer|tear in my beer]]' and '[[Your Cheatin' Heart (Hank Williams, Jr. album)|your cheatin' heart]].' They called it the suicide station for its depressing old country themes ..." The station's offerings have now expanded beyond country to include AC/DC and Marvin Gaye, and "on-the-air jokes they would never hear on a [[Clear Channel Communications|Clear Channel]] radio station, such as: 'The captain is as cool as [[Government cheese|commodity cheese]].{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.browningmontana.com/kbwg107.5fm.html|title=KBWG, the 'Voice of Browning Montana' can be heard at 107.5 FM|date=2011-06-11|accessdate=2012-09-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401203332/http://www.browningmontana.com/kbwg107.5fm.html|archivedate=2012-04-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"So far we have broadcasting Monday through Friday from around 6:30, Indian time", quipped station manager Lona Burns, "to around 11, Indian time." ... "It's Indian radio", agreed Running Crane.

===Canadian government support{{anchor|Writing System}}===
The Canadian government has provided support for the languages through funds and other financial resources. According to James Moore, the former Minister of Canadian Heritage and Official Languages, "the Government of Canada is committed to the revitalization and preservation of Aboriginal languages." The funding was put to use in the form of digital libraries containing interviews with native speakers, online courses, and various other resources in the hopes of promoting Blackfoot language and passing it down to subsequent generations. On top of both of these government efforts, the Canadian Government has also provided over $40,000 through the Aboriginal Languages Initiative Fund to promote the use of Aboriginal languages in community and family settings.&lt;ref&gt;Market Wired{{full citation needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination''' or '''BDAE''' is a [[neuropsychology|neuropsychological]] battery used to evaluate adults suspected of having [[aphasia]], and is currently in its third edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Spreen |first= Otfried |author2=Anthony H. Risser |title= Assessment of aphasia |publisher= Oxford University Press |year= 2003 |isbn= 0-19-514075-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created by [[Harold Goodglass]] and [[Edith Kaplan]]. The BDAE evaluates language skills based on perceptual modalities (auditory, visual, and gestural), processing functions (comprehension, analysis, problem-solving), and response modalities (writing, articulation, and manipulation).  Administration time ranges from 20 to 45 minutes for the shortened version but it can last up to 120 minutes for the extended version of the assessment. There are five subtests which include: conversational &amp; expository speech, auditory comprehension, oral expression, reading, and writing. In the extended version all questions are asked while in the shortened version only a few questions are asked within each subtest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.linguisystems.com/products/product/display?itemid=10301|title=BDAE 3 Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination Third Edition |year=2001 |website=linguisystems|publisher=linguisystems}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many other tests are sometimes used by [[neurology|neurologists]] and [[speech-language pathology|speech language pathologists]] on a case-by-case basis, and other comprehensive tests exist like the [[Western Aphasia Battery]].

==Description==
The Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (BDAE) provides a comprehensive exploration of a range of communicative abilities. The results of the BDAE are used to classify patient's language profiles into one of the localization based classifications of aphasia: Broca's, Wernicke's, anomic, conduction, transcortical, transcortical motor, transcortical sensory, and global aphasia syndromes, although the test does not always provide a diagnosis or a therapeutic approach. The assessment does provide you with a severity rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Language Intervention Strategies in Aphasia and Related Neurogenic Communication Disorders|last = Chapey|first = Roberta|publisher = Lippincott Williams &amp;  Wilkins|year = 2008|isbn = 978-0-7817-6981-5|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = 72}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Examination is designed to go beyond simple functional definitions of aphasia into the components of language dysfunctions (symptoms) that have been shown to underlie the various aphasic syndromes. Thus, this test evaluates various perceptual modalities (e.g., auditory, visual, and gestural), processing functions (e.g., comprehension, analysis, problem-solving), and response modalities (e.g., writing, articulation, and manipulation). This approach allows for the neuropsychological analysis and measurement of language-related skills and abilities from both [[ideographic]] and [[nomothetic]] bases, as well as a comprehensive approach to the symptom configurations that relate to neuropathologic conditions. The test is divided into five subtests and include assessment of conversation and expository speech (simple social responses, free conversation, and picture description), auditory comprehension (at the word-level, sentence level, and complex ideational material), oral expression (automatized sequences, repetition, and naming), reading (basic symbol recognition, number matching, word identification-picture-word matching, oral reading, and reading comprehension), and writing (mechanics, encoding skills, written picture naming, and narrative writing).&lt;ref&gt;In Depth Review of the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (BDAE) - Stroke Engine. (2015). Retrieved from http://www.strokengine.ca/indepth/bdae_indepth/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scoring===
The manual provides clear statements and rules for scoring protocols. Once the scores are collected, the examiner completes the Summary of Scores and inserts them into the '''Summary Profile of Standard Subtests''' in the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination Record Booklet to get percentiles. The percentiles are listed as 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 only. The scores that are collected are a tally of the number of correct responses, the number of cues given, number of phonemic cues, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination-Third Edition (BDAE-3)|url=http://www.pearsonclinical.com/language/products/100000312/boston-diagnostic-aphasia-examinationthird-edition-bdae-3.html#tab-details|publisher=Pearson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reliability===
[[Reliability (psychometric)|Reliability]] of the subtests was studied by selecting protocols of 34 patients with a degree of severity of aphasia ranging from slight to severe. Kuder-Richardson reliability coefficients for subtests ranged from .68 to .98, with about two-thirds of the coefficients reported ranging from .90 upwards. Since test-retest reliability is difficult if not impossible to attain with patients suffering from aphasic symptoms, the current reliability coefficients demonstrate very good internal consistency in terms of what the items within the subtests are measuring.

===Validity===
[[Test validity|Validity]]: A discriminant analysis comparing "unambiguous exemplars of a single syndrome" was carried out. Thus, unambiguous cases of Broca’s aphasia, Wernicke’s aphasia, [[conduction aphasia]], and [[anomic aphasia]] were selected. Ten variables were selected on the assumption of providing the most useful data. From these, five variables were selected for the discriminant analysis (body part identification, repetition of high probability sentences, verbal paraphasias, articulatory agility rating, and automated sentence rating). This classification yielded no misclassifications.

===Norms===
Standardization of the revised Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination is based on a normative sample of 242 patients with aphasic symptoms tested at the Boston VA Medical Center between 1976-1982. It is important to consider that this sample includes only male, presumably English-speaking patients and is thus highly selected.

'''''Conker: Live &amp; Reloaded''''' is a [[Platform game|platform]] [[video game]] developed by [[Rare (company)|Rare]] and exclusively released for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] in June 2005. The single player mode is a [[Video game remake|remake]] of the 2001 game ''[[Conker's Bad Fur Day]]'' for the [[Nintendo 64]]. However, it includes a new multiplayer mode that is different from the Nintendo 64 version using [[Xbox Live]]. Development started the moment the studio was bought by Microsoft in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rare-extreme.com/?section=conkerreload&amp;page=conkerinterview.html |title=Interview with Chris Savor: The Voice of Conker at Rare-Extreme |publisher=rare-extreme.com |accessdate=31 May 2016 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019002449/http://www.rare-extreme.com/?section=conkerreload&amp;page=conkerinterview.html |archivedate=19 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently of 2018, ''Live &amp; Reloaded'' was made backwards-compatible with the [[Xbox One]]. It was also added onto the [[Microsoft Store (digital)|Microsoft Store]] as a digital copy.

==Multiplayer and gameplay==
The Multiplayer in ''Live &amp; Reloaded'' uses the same third-person perspective as the single-player game.  Multiplayer consists of different game modes such as Capture the Flag or the standard Deathmatch modes. The player may participate as a member of the SHC or the Tediz. As well as a choice of soldier, the game has a choice of "classes" which significantly affect play style.&lt;ref name="ign review"/&gt;

Each class has its own special equipment, special abilities, and physical capabilities, each being designed for a distinct purpose. They are also designed to have advantages against certain classes while being vulnerable to others.  For example, the Thermophile's [[flamethrower]] inflicts extreme damage on {{not a typo|Sneeker}}s and Long Rangers, who have less health, but is virtually useless against the high-vitality Demolisher.  Each class comes equipped with a primary weapon with unlimited [[ammunition]] (although reloading of the weapon is still required), a limited stock of [[grenade]]s, and at least one special ability.  Each class can also choose from several specialist ordnance items and vehicles unique to the class, which can be obtained at stations in team bases (however, an option is available to the host of a server to disable one or both features). Abilities common to all classes are the ability to shoulder all weapons for extra running speed, and a [[spray paint|Spray Can]] that can be used to apply the player's [[Graffiti#Styles|avatar image]] to walls to mock human opponents.  Scattered throughout the arenas are yellow Upgrade Orbs, which grant a player more equipment and abilities when obtained. A player loses his upgrade orb upon death, allowing another player to obtain it.

Terminals are found in every mission, usually near a base. Terminals are computers that dispense useful items or vehicles, and can be accessed by a player during the game. When accessed, the player is given a menu of the available items. When an item is chosen it can be picked up at an adjacent dispenser area. The objects received from the terminals disappear upon the death of the player that obtained them. Terminals may be neutral and available to both sides, or under the control of one side. Terminals can be attacked and disabled, but not destroyed. If damaged or disabled, they can be repaired with an arc weld, issued to the Demolisher and Sky Jockey classes. Neutral or enemy-controlled terminals can be hacked with a {{not a typo|Sneeker}}'s hacking device. There are two types of terminals: Specialist Ordinance terminals, and Mobile Units terminals.

==Censorship==
The game was originally titled ''Conker: Live and Uncut'' and was to feature a completely uncensored single player experience. At some point during the development of the game, this was changed and the game was released with some censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/04/12/conker-playing-with-yourself | title = Conker: Playing with Yourself | publisher = IGN | date = 12 April 2005 | first = Hilary | last = Goldstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; The censorship included that of some obscenities which were present in the original N64 version. This drew criticism from fans of the original, especially as it detracted from comedic highlights such as the "Great Mighty Poo" song in the ''Sloprano'' chapter. This song was also censored on the soundtrack, and Rare once had the uncensored Xbox version of the song on their website.

Like the original, the game was rated M by the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]] and carried warnings about its content as well as Rare's promotional spoof warnings that advertised the fact that the content of the game was explicitly 'adult'.

''Conker: Live &amp; Reloaded'' was received positively by critics for its presentation and graphics.&lt;ref name="ign review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GSpy"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://xbox.gamespy.com/xbox/conker-live-and-uncut/628192p1.html | title = GameSpy: Conker: Live and Reloaded | publisher = [[GameSpy]] | date = 22 June 2005 | first = Bryn | last = Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was named IGN's "Best of E3 2005" in the category of "Best Graphics" for Xbox.&lt;ref&gt;[http://xbox.ign.com/articles/619/619567p1.html Xbox Best of E3 2005 Awards]&lt;/ref&gt; However it was criticized for changes to the singleplayer campaign compared to the original, such as the removal of certain challenges, and the lack of refinement in areas such as facial animation that was perfected on the Nintendo 64. IGN didn't find the new multiplayer to be as fun as the original.&lt;ref name="ign review"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/06/17/conker-live-and-reloaded | title = Conker: Live and Reloaded | publisher = [[IGN]] | accessdate = 3 January 2014 | date = 17 June 2005 | first = Hilary | last = Goldstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The multiplayer mode (new in this version of the game) remained popular well into 2007 (over a year and a half since its release) when it remained in the top 10 most played online titles for its platform.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080107034847/http://209.11.233.28/archive/2008/01/04/top-xbox-live-games-of-2007.aspx Lary 'Major Nelson' Hryb, Top Xbox LIVE Games of 2007  (Retrieved from the Internet Archive.)]&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'' gave it a perfect ten and stated that, "up to 16 people can torch each other.

It has the sort of platform-jumping, rope-climbing, monster-whomping challenges seen in many of these games, but adds foulmouthed animals, scatological humor and gallons of vividly scarlet cartoon blood."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/02/sports/othersports/02game.html?ex=1121054400&amp;en=c235857bfda2f116&amp;ei=5070&amp;emc=eta1&amp;_r=0 | title = That Drunken Red Squirrel Whomps Again | publisher = ''[[The New York Times]]'' | accessdate = 3 January 2014 | date = 2 July 2005 | first = Charles | last = Herold}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' gave it four stars out of five and said, "The potty humour will not be to everyone's taste but many films are hilariously lampooned."&lt;ref name="Sydney"/&gt;  However, Jim Schaefer of ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' gave it three stars out of four and said that he found it "amusing to relive some of Conker's bawdy behavior, but I wish they would have come up with a new story rather than remaking the old one."&lt;ref name="detroit"/&gt;  In Japan, ''[[Famitsu]]'' gave it a score of all four sevens, for a total of 28 out of 40.&lt;ref name="Fam" /&gt;

Goodwin's book ''No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II'' won the [[Pulitzer Prize for History]] in 1995.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; to pursue doctoral studies. In 1968, she earned a [[Ph.D.]] in government from [[Harvard University]], with a thesis titled "Prayer and Reapportionment: An Analysis of the Relationship between the Congress and the Court."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=no:76988853|title=Prayer and reapportionment; an analysis of the relationship between the Congress and the Court.|first=Doris Helen|last=Kearns|date=May 21, 1968|publisher=|via=Open WorldCat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career and awards==
In 1967, Kearns went to [[Washington, D.C.]] as a [[White House Fellow]] during the [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] administration. Johnson initially expressed interest in hiring the young intern as his Oval Office assistant, but after an article by Kearns appeared in ''[[The New Republic]]'' laying out a scenario for Johnson's removal from office over his conduct of the [[Vietnam War|war in Vietnam]], she was instead assigned to the Department of Labor; Goodwin has written that she felt relieved to be able to remain in the internship program in any capacity at all. "The president discovered that I had been actively involved in the anti-Vietnam War movement and had written an article entitled, 'How to Dump Lyndon Johnson'. I thought for sure he would kick me out of the program, but instead he said, 'Oh, bring her down here for a year and if I can't win her over, no one can'."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~news/releases/1998/june98/dkg.html "Dartmouth 1998 commencement address"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060206230551/http://www.dartmouth.edu/~news/releases/1998/june98/dkg.html |date=February 6, 2006 }}. [[Dartmouth College]]. Retrieved July 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; After Johnson decided not to run for reelection, he brought Kearns to the White House as a member of his staff, where she focused on domestic anti-poverty efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Lyndon B. Johnson and the American Dream, "Prologue"&lt;/ref&gt;

After Johnson left office in 1969, Kearns taught government at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] for 10 years, including a course on the [[President of the United States|American presidency]]. During this period, she also assisted Johnson in drafting his [[memoir]]s. Her first book ''Lyndon Johnson and the American Dream'', which drew upon her conversations with the late president, was published in 1977, becoming a [[New York Times bestseller|''New York Times'' bestseller]] and provided a launching pad for her literary career.

A sports journalist as well, Goodwin was the first female journalist to enter the [[Boston Red Sox]] locker room in 1979. She consulted on and appeared in [[Ken Burns]]'s 1994 documentary ''[[Baseball (documentary)|Baseball]]''.

Goodwin won the 1995 [[Pulitzer Prize for History]] for ''[[No Ordinary Time|No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front During World War II]]'' (1994).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=0684804484|title=Amazon.com: No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II (9780684804484): Doris Kearns Goodwin: Books|work=amazon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen King]] met with Goodwin while he was writing his novel ''[[11/22/63]]'', due to her being an assistant to Johnson, and King used some of her ideas in the novel on what a worst-case scenario would be like if history had changed.&lt;ref name=alter&gt;Alter, Alexandra (October 28, 2011).

===Plagiarism controversy===
In 2002, ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'' determined that her book ''The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys'' used without attribution numerous phrases and sentences from three other books: ''Times to Remember,'' by [[Rose Kennedy]]; ''The Lost Prince,'' by Hank Searl; and ''[[Kathleen Cavendish, Marchioness of Hartington|Kathleen Kennedy]]: Her Life and Times,'' by [[Lynne McTaggart]].&lt;ref&gt;Crader, Bo (January 28, 2002). [https://www.weeklystandard.com/a-historian-and-her-sources/article/2088 "A Historian and Her Sources"]. ''The Weekly Standard''.&lt;/ref&gt; McTaggart remarked, "If somebody takes a third of somebody's book, which is what happened to me, they are lifting out the heart and guts of somebody else's individual expression."&lt;ref&gt;Lawless, Jill (March 23, 2002). [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1980&amp;dat=20020324&amp;id=fAMuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=uakFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2912,3165716 "Author Says Doris Kearns Goodwin Took 'Heart and Guts' From Her Book"]. [[Associated Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; Goodwin had previously reached a "private settlement" with McTaggart over the issue. In an article she wrote for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, she said, "Though my footnotes repeatedly cited Ms. McTaggart's work, I failed to provide quotation marks for phrases that I had taken verbatim... The larger question for those of us who write history is to understand how citation mistakes can happen."&lt;ref name=Kearns2002&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,197614,00.html|first=Doris Kearns|last= Goodwin|title=How I Caused That Story |journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=January 27, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its analysis of the controversy, [[Slate (magazine)|''Slate'' magazine]] criticized Goodwin for the aggrieved tone of her explanation, and suggested Goodwin's worst offense was allowing the plagiarism to remain in future editions of the book even after it was brought to her attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Noah|first1=Timothy|title=How To Curb the Plagiarism Epidemic|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/chatterbox/2002/01/how_to_curb_the_plagiarism_epidemic.html|publisher=Slate Magazine|accessdate=6 October 2017|date=28 January 2002|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Slate'' also reported that there were multiple passages in Goodwin's book on the Roosevelts (''No Ordinary Time'') that were apparently taken from [[Joseph P. Lash|Joseph Lash]]'s ''Eleanor and Franklin'', Hugh Gregory Gallagher's ''FDR's Splendid Deception,'' and other books, although she "scrupulously" footnoted the material. The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported similar circumstances concerning her book ''The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys''.&lt;ref&gt;King, Peter H. (August 4, 2002).

Growing up in [[Long Island]], Goodwin was a fan of the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]]. She noted that her father would have her document the baseball game from the radio and replay the events of the game once he returned home. Goodwin stopped following baseball after the Dodgers moved to [[Los Angeles]] in 1957, but later became a [[Boston Red Sox]] fan while attending Harvard, and is now a [[season ticket]] holder.

'''Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster''' is an electric sports car that served as the [[dummy payload]] for the February 2018 [[Falcon Heavy test flight]] and is now an [[artificial satellite]] of the [[Sun]]. "Starman", a mannequin dressed in a [[Space suit#SpaceX spacesuit|spacesuit]], occupies the driver's seat. The car and rocket are products of [[Tesla, Inc.|Tesla]] and [[SpaceX]], both companies founded by [[Elon Musk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/tesla-motors-founders-now-there-are-five/ |title=Tesla Motors founders: Now there are five |work=CNet |first=Martin|last=LaMonica |date=September 21, 2009 |accessdate=September 18, 2018|quote=agreed-upon "founders" of [[Tesla Motors|Tesla]].

The car, mounted on the rocket's second stage, acquired [[escape velocity|enough velocity to escape]] Earth's gravity and enter an [[Elliptic orbit|elliptical]] [[heliocentric orbit]] crossing the orbit of [[Mars]].&lt;ref name="SFN_rearview"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://spaceflightnow.com/2018/02/08/starman-puts-earth-in-the-rearview-mirror/|title='Starman' puts Earth in the rearview mirror |first=William |last=Harwood|via=Spaceflight Now|work=CBS News|date= February 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The orbit reaches a maximum distance from the Sun at [[Perihelion and aphelion|aphelion]] of {{nowrap|1.66 [[astronomical unit]]s (au)}}.&lt;ref name="jpl-horizons"/&gt; During the early portion of the voyage outside the Earth's atmosphere, live video was transmitted back to the [[mission control center]] and [[live-streamed]] for slightly over four hours.&lt;ref name=Starman-Broadcast/&gt;

Advertising analysts noted Musk's sense of [[brand management]] and use of new media for his decision to launch a Tesla into space. While some commenters voiced concern that the car contributed to [[space debris]], others saw it as a work of art. Musk responded to the critics explaining he wanted to inspire the public about the "possibility of something new happening in space," being part of his larger vision for moving humanity into space.&lt;ref name=mosher/&gt;

In March 2017, [[SpaceX]]'s founder, Elon Musk, stated that because the launch of the new Falcon Heavy vehicle was risky, it would carry the "silliest thing we can imagine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |user=elonmusk |author-link=Elon Musk |number=847884351375372288 |title=Silliest thing we can imagine!

Like all its previous launches, SpaceX [[Live streaming|live streamed]] a video feed.

Some news reports observed a similarity between the real pictures of a car orbiting the Earth and the title sequence of the 1981 animation film ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'', where a space traveler lands on Earth in a two-seater [[Chevrolet Corvette]] convertible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://edge.ca/news/4011097/a-canadian-american-predicted-what-elon-musks-rocket-roadster-did-yesterday-in-1981/ |title=A Canadian-American predicted what Elon Musk's rocket roadster did yesterday—in 1981! |first=Alan |last=Cross |work=[[CFNY-FM]] |date=February 7, 2018 |access-date=February 11, 2018 |quote=picture is not fake [...] photo is from space [...] resemblance to the opening sequence of a Canadian-American adult animated movie from 1981 called ''Heavy Metal''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/how-tesla-and-spacex-have-already-merged-2018-2 |title=The Falcon Heavy Roadster Launch reveals how Tesla and SpaceX are already beginning to merge |first=Matthew |last=DeBord |website=[[Business Insider]] UK |date=February 10, 2018 |access-date=February 11, 2018 |quote=Roadster orbiting Earth [...] like something out of the [...] opening sequence from the 1981 grownup animated movie "Heavy Metal"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SpaceX launch live stream reached over 2.3 million concurrent viewers on YouTube, which makes it the second most watched live event on the platform {{as of|2018|lc=y}}, being surpassed only by the [[Red Bull Stratos]] jump in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/6/16981730/spacex-falcon-heavy-launch-youtube-live-stream-record|title=SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy launch was YouTube’s second biggest live stream ever|last=Singleton|first=Micah|work=The Verge|date=6 February 2018|access-date=23 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==
The choice of this car as a dummy payload was variously interpreted as a shrewd marketing move for Tesla, a work of art, or a contribution to [[space debris]].

=== Marketing move ===
Musk was lauded as a visionary [[Marketing|marketer]] and [[Brand management|brand manager]] by controlling both the timing and the content of his corporate public relations.&lt;ref name=Billings2018/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wnek2018/&gt;&lt;ref name=Matousek2018/&gt;&lt;ref name=Economist2018&gt;{{Citation |title= The mega-rich have ambitious plans to improve the world; Should that be a cause for celebration or concern? |date= February 8, 2018 |magazine=[[The Economist]] |url= https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21736517-should-be-cause-celebration-or-concern-mega-rich-have-ambitious-plans-improve }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the launch, ''[[Scientific American]]'' said using a car was not entirely pointless, in the sense that something of that size and weight was necessary for a meaningful test. "Thematically, it was a perfect fit" to use the Tesla car, and there was no reason not to take the opportunity to remind the auto industry that Musk was challenging the status quo in that arena, as well as in space.&lt;ref name=Billings2018&gt;{{Citation |url= https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/elon-musk-does-it-again/ |title= Elon Musk Does It Again; His Falcon Heavy rocket lifts off on the first try, puts a Tesla auto into orbit—and maybe changes the business of space commerce and exploration forever |first= Lee |last= Billings |date= February 6, 2018 |magazine= [[Scientific American]] |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20180209230841/https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/elon-musk-does-it-again/ |archivedate= February 9, 2018 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Advertising Age]]'' agreed with ''[[Business Insider]]'' that the Roadster space launch was the "greatest ever car commercial without a dime spent on advertising", demonstrating that Musk is "miles ahead of the rest" in reaching young consumers, where "mere mortals scrabble about spending millions to fight each other over seconds of air time", Musk "just executes his vision."&lt;ref name=Wnek2018&gt;{{Citation |url= http://adage.com/article/special-report-super-bowl/advertising-marketing-elon-musk/312307/ |title= There's Advertising and Marketing, and Then There's Elon Musk |first=Mark |last= Wnek |magazine=[[Advertising Age]] |date= February 8, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Matousek2018&gt;{{Citation |title= Tesla created the world's best car commercial without spending a dime on advertising |first=Mark |last= Matousek |website=[[Business Insider]] |date=February 7, 2018 |url= http://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-made-the-worlds-best-car-commercial-without-spending-money-2018-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alex Hern, technology reporter for ''[[The Guardian]]'', said the choice to launch a car was a "hybrid of genuine breakthrough and nerd-baiting publicity stunt" without "any real point beyond generating good press pics", which should not detract from the much more important technological milestone represented by the launch of the rocket itself.&lt;ref name=Hern2018&gt;{{Citation |url= https://www.theguardian.com/science/shortcuts/2018/feb/07/forget-the-car-in-space-why-elon-musks-reusable-rockets-are-more-than-a-publicity-stunt |title= Forget the car in space: why Elon Musk's reusable rockets are more than a publicity stunt; The onboard Tesla Roadster grabbed the headlines, but the real success of this week's space adventure was the Falcon Heavy launch vehicle |first= Alex |last= Hern |date= February 7, 2018 |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20180207200649/https://www.theguardian.com/science/shortcuts/2018/feb/07/forget-the-car-in-space-why-elon-musks-reusable-rockets-are-more-than-a-publicity-stunt |archivedate= February 7, 2018 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lori Garver]], a former NASA deputy director, initially said the choice of payload for the Falcon Heavy maiden flight is a [[gimmick]] and a loss of opportunity to further advance science—but later clarified that "I was told by a SpaceX VP (vice president) at the launch that they offered free launches to NASA, Air Force etc. but got no takers."&lt;ref name=Richards2018&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/spacex-falcon-heavy-launch-nothing-more-than-a-gimmick-says-former-nasa-deputy-administrator-lori-a3762376.html |title= Elon Musk's SpaceX Falcon Heavy launch was just a gimmick, says former NASA boss Lori Garver |newspaper= [[Evening Standard]] |first= Alexandra |last= Richards |date= 2018-02-09 |accessdate= 2018-02-09 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20180209194810/https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/spacex-falcon-heavy-launch-nothing-more-than-a-gimmick-says-former-nasa-deputy-administrator-lori-a3762376.html |archivedate= February 9, 2018 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Musk responded to the critics explaining he wanted to inspire the public about the "possibility of something new happening in space," being part of his larger vision for moving humanity into space.&lt;ref name=mosher&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/why-elon-musk-launched-tesla-mars-falcon-heavy-2018-3 |title=Elon Musk explains why he launched a car toward Mars — and the reasons are much bigger than his ego |work=[[Business Insider]] |author=Dave Mosher |date=March 13, 2018 |accessdate=September 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Work of art ===
[[File:Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster (40143096241).jpg|thumb|The mannequin known as "Starman", seated in the Roadster|alt=Large circular disc of a fully-illuminated planet Earth floating in the blackness of space. In front of Earth is a red convertible sports-car seen from the side.

[[Alice Gorman]], a lecturer in archaeology and space studies at [[Flinders University]] in Australia, said that its primary purpose is symbolic communication, that "the red sports car symbolises [[masculinity]] – power, wealth and speed&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.space.com/39646-tesla-roadster-gets-interplanetary-id.html Tesla Roadster gets Interplanetary ID]. Leonard David. ''Space''. 9 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; – but also how fragile masculinity is." Drawing on anthropological theories of symbols, she argues that "The car is also an armour against dying, a [[talisman]] that quells a profound fear of mortality."&lt;ref name="gorman-20180207"/&gt; Gorman wrote that "the spacesuit is also about death. [...] The Starman was never alive, but now he's haunting space."&lt;ref name="gorman-20180207"&gt;{{cite blog|url=http://theconversation.com/a-sports-car-and-a-glitter-ball-are-now-in-space-what-does-that-say-about-us-as-humans-91156|title=A sports car and a glitter ball are now in space – what does that say about us as humans?|first=Alice|last=Gorman|authorlink1=Alice Gorman|author2=Flinders University|authorlink2=Flinders University|work=[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]]|date=2018-02-07|accessdate=2018-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Verge]]'' likened the Roadster to a "[[Readymade]]" [[work of art]], such as [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s 1917 piece [[Fountain (Duchamp)|''Fountain'']], created by placing an everyday object in an unusual position, context and orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/10/16997124/elon-musk-spacex-tesla-art-starman-advertising|title=Elon Musk made history launching a car into space.

[...] a readymade, his word for a combination of everyday objects reassembled or re-contextualized by an artist.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Space debris ===
Orbital debris expert Darren McKnight stated that the car poses no risk because it is far from Earth orbit. He added: "The enthusiasm and interest that [Musk] generates more than offsets the infinitesimally small 'littering' of the cosmos."&lt;ref name='L David'&gt;[https://www.space.com/39602-falcon-heavy-tesla-not-just-space-junk.html Is the Tesla Roadster Flying on the Falcon Heavy's Maiden Flight Just Space Junk?]. Leonard David, ''Space'', 5 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Tommy Sanford, director of the [[Commercial Spaceflight Federation]], opined that the car and its rocket stage are no more "space junk" than the mundane material usually launched on other test flights. [[Mass simulator]]s are often deliberately placed in a [[graveyard orbit]] or sent on a [[outer space|deep space]] trajectory, where they are not a hazard.&lt;ref name=Sanford2018&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mashable.com/2018/02/08/elon-musk-tesla-roadster-not-typical-space-junk/ |title=Elon Musk's 'Starman' Tesla Roadster isn't your typical piece of space junk |first=Mark |last=Kaufman |website=[[Mashable]] |date=February 8, 2018 |access-date=February 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hugh Lewis, an expert in space debris at the [[University of Southampton]], tweeted "Intentionally launching a car to a long-lived orbit is not what you want to hear from a company planning to fly 1000s satellites in [[Low Earth orbit|LEO]]."&lt;ref name=Lewis2018&gt;[http://www.dw.com/en/what-you-need-to-know-about-spacexs-falcon-heavy-launch/a-42466661 What you need to know about SpaceX's Falcon Heavy launch]. Conor Dillon, ''Deutsche Welle'' – Science. 6 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Planetary Society]] was concerned that launching a non-sterile object to interplanetary space may risk [[Planetary protection|biological contamination]] of a foreign world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetary.org/blogs/jason-davis/2018/20180205-space-tesla.html Let's talk about Elon Musk launching his Tesla into space]. Jason Davis, ''The Planetary Society''. 5 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists at [[Purdue University]] thought it was the "dirtiest" man-made object ever sent into space, in terms of bacteria amount, noting the car was previously driven on Los Angeles freeways. Although the vehicle will be sterilized by solar radiation over time, some bacteria might survive on pieces of plastic which could contaminate Mars in the distant future.&lt;ref name="PHYS-20180227"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff - [[Purdue University]] |title=Tesla in space could carry bacteria from Earth |url=https://phys.org/news/2018-02-tesla-space-bacteria-earth.html |date=February 27, 2018 |work=[[phys.org]] |accessdate=February 28, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://newatlas.com/tesla-roadster-dirtiest-space/53590/ |title=The Tesla Roadster could be the dirtiest manmade object in space |work=New Atlas |author=David Szondy |date=February 28, 2018 |accessdate=February 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orbit tracking{{anchor|Astrometry}}==
The car and second stage were [[Passivation (spacecraft)|passivated]] by intentionally removing remaining chemical and electrical energy, at which point the car and rocket booster ceased transmitting [[telemetry]]. Based on optical observations made using a robotic telescope at the Warrumbungle Observatory, [[Dubbo]], Australia and refinement of the orbit, a close re-encounter with Earth (originally predicted for 2073) is not possible.&lt;ref name="langbroek-20180209"&gt;{{cite blog|first1=Marco|last1=Langbroek|first2=Peter|last2=Starr|url=https://sattrackcam.blogspot.co.uk/2018/02/starman-falcon-heavytesla-roadster-2018.html|title=Starman (Falcon Heavy/Tesla Roadster) 2018-017A imaged in Space|date=9 February 2018|accessdate=9 February 2018|quote=images were taken, 16:39-16:50 UT on 8 February 2018 [...] distance of 550 000 km or about 1.4 Lunar distances c.q. 0.0037 AU [...] 30-second exposures taken by Peter Starr and me with the 0.43-m F6.8 remote robotic telescope of Dubbo Observatory in Australia [...] 2073 close encounter [...] is no longer on the table.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2020, the car will pass about 6.9 million kilometers (4.3 million miles) from Mars, well outside Mars' gravitational sphere of influence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/6/16983744/spacex-tesla-falcon-heavy-roadster-orbit-asteroid-belt-elon-musk-mars Elon Musk's Tesla overshot Mars' orbit, but it won't reach the asteroid belt as claimed].

The [[Virtual Telescope Project]] observed the Tesla two days after its launch, where it had a [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] of 15.5,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.virtualtelescope.eu/2018/02/08/elon-musks-tesla-roadster-imaged-8-feb-2018/ |title= Elon Musk’s Tesla Roadster imaged and filmed! |website= virtualtelescope.eu |first= Gianluca |last= Masi |authorlink= Gianluca Masi |date= 2018-02-08 |accessdate= 2018-02-09 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20180209045535/https://www.virtualtelescope.eu/2018/02/08/elon-musks-tesla-roadster-imaged-8-feb-2018/ |archivedate= February 9, 2018 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; comparable to [[Pluto]]'s moon [[Charon (moon)|Charon]].

Through measuring changes in apparent brightness of the object, astronomers have determined that the Roadster is rotating with a period of 4.7589 ± 0.0060 minutes (i.e. 4 minutes, 46 seconds).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/satellites/a17762760/heres-exactly-how-fast-elon-musks-tesla-is-spinning-in-space/|title=Here's Exactly How Fast Elon Musk's Tesla Is Spinning In Space|date=February 13, 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By February 11, 2018, [[astrometry]] measurements from 241 independent observations had been collated, refining the positions to within one-tenth of an [[arcsecond]]&lt;ref name="gray-20180211"/&gt;—more accurate than for most observations of objects in space.&lt;ref name="gray-20180211"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satobs.org/seesat/Feb-2018/0117.html|title=Re: Tesla roadster and booster observations|first=Bill|last=Gray|date=2018-02-11|via=SeeSat-L mailing list|quote=list of 241 observations and growing [...] continue to be observed for about two weeks.

=== Future predictions ===
Simulations over a 3-[[myr|million-year timespan]] found a probability of the Roadster colliding with [[Earth]] at approximately 6%, or with [[Venus]] at approximately 2.5%.&lt;ref name="rein-et-al-20180218" /&gt; These probabilities of collision are similar to those of other [[near-Earth object]]s.&lt;ref name="rein-et-al-20180218"/&gt; The [[half-life]] for the tested orbits was calculated as approximately 20 million years, but with trajectories varying significantly following a close approach to the Earth–Moon system in 2091.&lt;ref name="rein-et-al-20180218"&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Rein|first1=Hanno|last2=Tamayo|first2=Daniel|last3=Vokrouhlicky|first3=David|title=The random walk of cars and their collision probabilities with planets|eprint=1802.04718|date=13 February 2018|class=astro-ph.EP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much like [[mainstream economics]],  it stresses complex [[Interdependency|interdependencies]], [[competition]], [[Economic growth|growth]], [[structural change]], and [[resource constraint]]s but differs in the approaches which are used to analyze these phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Hodgson|Geoffrey M. Hodgson]] (1993) ''Economics and Evolution: Bringing Life Back Into Economics'', Cambridge and University of Michigan Press. [http://www.press.umich.edu/titleDetailDesc.do?id=14010 Description] and chapter-link [https://books.google.com/books?id=IupN3JF6zSkC&amp;printsec=find&amp;pg=PR5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false preview].&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary economics deals with the study of processes that transform economy for firms, institutions, industries, employment, production, trade and growth within, through the actions of diverse agents from experience and interactions, using evolutionary methodology&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, E.S., 2013. Evolutionary economics: post-Schumpeterian contributions. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2012. Options for moving beyond the canonical model of regional path dependence. International Journal of Urban and Regional Research, 36(1), pp.172-178. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2427.2011.01090.x/full 
&lt;/ref&gt;. Evolutionary economics analyses the unleashing of a process of technological and institutional innovation by generating and testing a diversity of ideas which discover and accumulate more survival value for the costs incurred than competing alternatives. The evidence suggests that it could be [[Adaptive market hypothesis|adaptive efficiency]] that defines economic efficiency. [[Mainstream economics|Mainstream]] economic reasoning begins with the postulates of [[scarcity]] and [[rational agent]]s (that is, agents modeled as maximizing their individual welfare), with the "[[rational choice]]" for any agent being a straightforward  [[exercise (mathematics)|exercise]] in [[mathematical optimization]]. There has been renewed interest in treating economic systems as evolutionary systems in the developing field of [[Complexity economics]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Evolutionary economics does not take the characteristics of either the objects of choice or of the decision-maker as fixed. Rather its focus is on the non-equilibrium ''processes'' that transform the economy ''from within'' and their implications&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, R.R. and Winter, S.G., 2002. Evolutionary theorizing in economics. The journal of economic perspectives, 16(2), pp.23-46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2012. Options for moving beyond the canonical model of regional path dependence. International Journal of Urban and Regional Research, 36(1), pp.172-178. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2427.2011.01090.x/full 
&lt;/ref&gt;.  The processes in turn emerge from actions of diverse agents with [[bounded rationality]] who may learn from experience and interactions and whose differences contribute to the change.  The subject draws more recently on [[evolutionary game theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Friedman (1998).  "On Economic Applications of Evolutionary Game Theory," ''Journal of Evolutionary Economics'', 8(1), pp. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/p62cu1yy9tkljh5l/ 15]-43.&lt;/ref&gt; and on the [[evolution]]ary methodology of [[Charles Darwin]] and the [[non-equilibrium economics]] principle of circular and cumulative causation. It is [[Natural science|naturalistic]] in purging earlier notions of economic change as [[teleology|teleological]] or necessarily improving the human condition.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Witt (2008). "evolutionary economics." ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Edition, v. 3,  pp. 67-68 [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_E000295&amp;q=evolutinary%20economics&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=1 Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A different approach is to apply [[evolutionary psychology]] principles to economics which is argued to explain problems such as inconsistencies and biases in [[rational choice theory]]. Basic economic concepts such as [[utility]] may be better viewed as due to preferences that maximized evolutionary [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] in the ancestral environment but not necessarily in the current one.&lt;ref name=AEP&gt;Paul H.

==Predecessors==
In the mid-19th century, [[Karl Marx]] presented a schema of stages of historical development, by introducing the notion that [[human nature]] was not constant and was not determinative of the nature of the social system; on the contrary, he made it a principle that human behavior was a function of the social and economic system in which it occurred.

Marx based his theory of economic development on the premise of developing [[economic system]]s; specifically, over the course of history superior economic systems would replace inferior ones. Inferior systems were beset by internal contradictions and [[Inefficiency|inefficiencies]] that make them incapable of surviving over the long term. In Marx's scheme, [[feudalism]] was replaced by [[capitalism]], which would eventually be superseded by [[socialism]].&lt;ref name="ComparingEconomicSystems"&gt;''Gregory and Stuart''. (2005) ''Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century'', Seventh Edition, South-Western College Publishing, {{ISBN|0-618-26181-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At approximately the same time, [[Charles Darwin]] developed a general framework for comprehending any process whereby small, [[random variation]]s could accumulate and predominate over time into large-scale changes that resulted in the emergence of wholly novel forms ("[[speciation]]").

This was followed shortly after by the work of the American pragmatic philosophers ([[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]], [[William James|James]], [[John Dewey|Dewey]]) and the founding of two new disciplines, [[psychology]] and [[anthropology]], both of which were oriented toward cataloging and developing explanatory frameworks for the variety of [[behavior]] patterns (both individual and collective) that were becoming increasingly obvious to all systematic observers. The state of the world converged with the state of the evidence to make almost inevitable the development of a more "modern" framework for the analysis of substantive economic issues.

=== Veblen (1898) ===

[[Thorstein Veblen]] (1898) coined the term "evolutionary economics" in English. He began his career in the midst of this period of intellectual ferment, and as a young scholar came into direct contact with some of the leading figures of the various movements that were to shape the style and substance of [[social science]]s into the next century and beyond. Veblen saw the need for taking account of cultural variation in his approach; no universal "human nature" could possibly be invoked to explain the variety of norms and behaviors that the new science of anthropology showed to be the rule, rather than the exception. He emphasised the conflict between "industrial" and "pecuniary" or ceremonial values and this [[Veblenian dichotomy]] was interpreted in the hands of later writers as the "ceremonial / instrumental dichotomy" (Hodgson 2004);

Veblen saw that every culture is materially based and dependent on tools and skills to support the "life process", while at the same time, every culture appeared to have a stratified structure of status ("invidious distinctions") that ran entirely contrary to the imperatives of the "instrumental" (read: "technological") aspects of group life. The "ceremonial" was related to the past, and conformed to and supported the tribal legends; "instrumental" was oriented toward the technological imperative to judge value by the ability to control future consequences. The "Veblenian dichotomy" was a specialized variant of the "[[Instrumentalism|instrumental]] theory of value" due to John Dewey, with whom Veblen was to make contact briefly at the [[University of Chicago]].

Arguably the most important works by Veblen include, but are not restricted to, his most famous works (''[[The Theory of the Leisure Class]]''; ''[[The Theory of Business Enterprise]]''), but his monograph ''Imperial Germany and the Industrial Revolution'' and the 1898 essay entitled ''Why is Economics not an Evolutionary Science'' have both been influential in shaping the research agenda for subsequent generations of [[social scientist]]s. TOLC and TOBE together constitute an alternative construction to the neoclassical marginalist theories of consumption and production, respectively.

Both are founded on his dichotomy, which is at its core a valuational principle. The ceremonial patterns of activity are not bound to any past, but to one that generated a specific set of advantages and prejudices that underlie the current institutions. "Instrumental" judgments create benefits according to a new criterion, and therefore are inherently subversive. This line of analysis was more fully and explicitly developed by [[Clarence E. Ayres]] of the [[University of Texas at Austin]] from the 1920s.

A seminal article by [[Armen Alchian]] (1950) argued for adaptive success of firms faced with uncertainty and incomplete information replacing [[profit maximization]] as an appropriate modeling assumption.&lt;ref&gt;Armen A. Alchian 1950, "Uncertainty, Evolution and Economic Theory," ''Journal of Political Economy'', 58(3), pp. [http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/wew/syllabi/Econ811JournalArticles/AlchianJPE.pdf 211-21].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Boulding]] was one of the advocates of the evolutionary methods in social science, as is evident from [[Kenneth Boulding's Evolutionary Perspective]]. [[Kenneth Arrow]], [[Ronald Coase]] and [[Douglass North]] are some of the [[Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel]] winners who are known for their sympathy to the field.

More narrowly the works [[Jack Downie]]&lt;ref&gt;Jack Downie (1958) The Competitive Process&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Edith Penrose]]&lt;ref&gt;E. Penrose (1959) The Theory of the Growth of the Firm&lt;/ref&gt; offer many insights for those thinking about evolution at the level of the firm in an industry.

[[Joseph Schumpeter]], who lived in the first half of 20th century, was the author of the book ''The Theory of Economic Development'' (1911, transl. 1934). It is important to note that for the word ''development'' he used in his native language, the German word "Entwicklung", which can be translated as development or evolution. The translators of the day used the word "development" from the French "développement", as opposed to "evolution" as this was used by Darwin. (Schumpeter, in his later writings in English as a professor at Harvard, used the word "evolution".)  The current term in common use is [[economic development]].

In Schumpeter's book he proposed an idea radical for its time: the evolutionary perspective. He based his theory on the assumption of usual [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]], which is something like "the normal mode of economic affairs". This equilibrium is being perpetually destroyed by [[entrepreneur]]s who try to introduce [[innovation]]s. A successful introduction of an innovation (i.e. a [[disruptive technology]]) disturbs the normal flow of economic life, because it forces some of the already existing technologies and means of production to lose their positions within the economy.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

== Present state of discussion ==
One of the major contributions to the emerging field of evolutionary economics has been the publication of ''An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change'' by [[Richard R. Nelson (economist)|Richard Nelson]] and [[Sidney G. Winter]]. These authors have focused mostly on the issue of changes in [[technology]] and [[Business process|routines]], suggesting a framework for their analysis. If the change occurs constantly in the economy, then some kind of evolutionary process must be in action, and there has been a proposal that this process is [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] in nature.

Then, mechanisms that provide [[Selection (biology)|selection]], generate [[Genetic variation|variation]] and establish [[self-replication]], must be identified. The authors introduced the term '[[steady change]]' to highlight the evolutionary aspect of economic processes and contrast it with the concept of '[[steady state]]' popular in [[classical economics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Steady change]]&lt;/ref&gt; Their approach can be compared and contrasted with the [[population ecology]] or [[organizational ecology]] approach in sociology: see Douma &amp; Schreuder (2013, chapter 11).

[[Milton Friedman]] proposed that [[Market (economics)|market]]s act as major selection vehicles. As [[corporation|firm]]s compete, unsuccessful rivals fail to capture an appropriate [[market share]], go [[bankrupt]] and have to exit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link=Mariana Mazzucato |last=Mazzucato |first=Mariana |url=http://oro.open.ac.uk/22206/ |year=2000 |title=Firm Size, Innovation and Market Structure: The Evolution of Market Concentration and Instability |journal=Advances in Complex Systems |volume=3 |pages=417–431 |publisher=Edward Elgar |location=Northampton, MA |isbn=978-1-84064-346-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The variety of competing firms is both in their products and practices, that are matched against markets. Both products and practices are determined by routines that firms use: standardized patterns of actions implemented constantly. By imitating these routines, firms propagate them and thus establish inheritance of successful practices.&lt;ref&gt;[[Milton Friedman|Friedman, Milton]] (1953). ''[[Essays in Positive Economics]]'', University of Chicago Press. [https://books.google.com/books?id=rSGekjfpf4cC&amp;printsec=toc&amp;dq=friedman+essays&amp;lr=&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0 Chapter preview links.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Page 251: [[Jon Elster]], ''Explaining Technical Change : a Case Study in the Philosophy of Science'', Second ed.&lt;/ref&gt;
A general theory of this process has been proposed by Kurt Dopfer, John Foster and Jason Potts as the micro meso macro framework.&lt;ref&gt;Dopfer, K., Foster, J., Potts, J. (2004). Micro-meso-macro. Journal of Evolutionary Economics. 14(3), 263-279&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic processes, as part of life processes, are intrinsically evolutionary&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, R.R. and Winter, S.G., 2002. Evolutionary theorizing in economics. The journal of economic perspectives, 16(2), pp.23-46.&lt;/ref&gt;. From the evolutionary equation that describe life processes, an analytical formula on the main factors of economic processes, such as fixed cost and variable cost, can be derived. The economic return, or competitiveness, of economic entities of different characteristics under different kinds of environment can be calculated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Unity of Science and Economics: A New Foundation of Economic Theory|last=Chen|first=Jing|publisher=Springer|year=2016|isbn=|location=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781493934645|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The change of environment causes the change of competitiveness of different economic entities and systems. This is the process of evolution of economic systems.

In recent years, evolutionary models have been used to assist decision making in applied settings and find solutions to problems such as optimal product design and service portfolio diversification.&lt;ref&gt;Baltas, G., Tsafarakis, S., Saridakis, C. &amp; Matsatsinis, N. (2013). Biologically Inspired Approaches to Strategic Service Design: Optimal Service Diversification Through Evolutionary and Swarm Intelligence Models. ''Journal of Service Research'' 16 (2), 186-201&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolutionary psychology ==
{{See also|Behavioral economics|Neuroeconomics}}
A different approach is to apply [[evolutionary psychology]] principles to economics which is argued to explain problems such as inconsistencies and biases in [[rational choice theory]]. A basic economic concept such as [[utility]] may be better viewed as due to preferences that maximized evolutionary [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] in the ancestral environment but not necessarily in the current one. [[Loss aversion]] may be explained as being rational when living at subsistence level where a reduction of resources may have meant death and it thus may have been rational to place a greater value on losses than on gains.&lt;ref name="AEP"/&gt;

People are sometimes more cooperative and altruistic than predicted by economic theory which may be explained by mechanisms such as [[reciprocal altruism]] and [[group selection]] for cooperative behavior. An evolutionary approach may also explain differences between groups such as males being less risk-averse than females since males have more variable [[reproductive success]] than females. While unsuccessful risk-seeking may limit reproductive success for both sexes, males may potentially increase their reproductive success much more than females from successful risk-seeking. [[Frequency-dependent selection]] may explain why people differ in characteristics such as cooperative behavior with cheating becoming an increasingly less successful strategy as the numbers of cheaters increase.&lt;ref name="AEP"/&gt;

Another argument is that humans have a poor intuitive grasp of the economics of the current environment which is very different from the ancestral environment. The ancestral environment likely had relatively little [[trade]], [[division of labor]], and [[capital good]]s. Technological change was very slow, wealth differences were much smaller, and possession of many available resources were likely [[zero-sum]] games where large inequalities were caused by various forms of exploitation. Humans therefore may have poor intuitive understanding the benefits of [[free trade]] (causing calls for [[protectionism]]), the value of capital goods (making the [[labor theory of value]] appealing), and may intuitively undervalue the benefits of technological development.&lt;ref name="AEP"/&gt;

There may be a tendency to see the number of available jobs as a zero-sum game with the total number of jobs being fixed which causes people to not realize that [[minimum wage]] laws reduce the number of jobs or to believe that an increased number of jobs in other nations necessarily decreases the number of jobs in their own nation. Large [[income inequality]] may easily be viewed as due to exploitation rather than as due to individual differences in [[productivity]]. This may easily cause poor economic policies, especially since individual voters have few incentives to make the effort of studying societal economics instead of relying on their intuitions since an individual's vote counts for so little and since politicians may be reluctant to take a stand against intuitive views that are incorrect but widely held.&lt;ref name=AEP/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10561">'''George Lenczowski''' (''pol. Jerzy Lenczowski''; February 2, 1915 - February 19, 2000) was a lawyer, diplomat, scholar, and Professor of Political Science, Emeritus, at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Lenczowski was a pioneer in his field as the founder and first chair of the Committee (later Center) of Middle Eastern Studies at Berkeley. He was among America's first major scholars of the modern Middle East.

Lenczowski's book, ''American Presidents and the Middle East'', along with ''The Other Arab-Israeli Conflict'' by [[Steven L. Spiegel]] and ''Peace Process'' by [[William B. Quandt]], are considered by historian and former Israeli ambassador to the United States, [[Michael Oren]],  as being "three of the genre's finer examples", focusing on the post-World War II period and seeking to investigate broader aspects of America's Middle East history.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Oren]], ''Power, Faith and Fantasy'', 2007, Introduction, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

Lenczowski was the father of [[John Lenczowski]], president and founder of the [[Institute of World Politics]].

==Early life==
George Lenczowski was born as Jerzy Lenczowski of Polish parentage, in [[St. Petersburg]], [[Russia]] (then known as Petrograd), on February 2, 1915, at a time when the land of his ancestors was still part of neighboring empires. His father worked as an engineer until the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]].  One of Lenczowski's earliest memories was a perilous escape from the Bolsheviks through war-torn Russia, which brought the Lenczowski family back to what soon would become an independent [[History of Poland (1918-1939)|Poland]], following [[World War I]].  It was there that Lenczowski received his education from primary school to the faculty of law from the [[University of Warsaw]].  He took his LL.M degree in 1936 and continued his studies in France, where he earned a Certificate in Civil Law at the [[University of Paris]] (1936) and a Doctorate in Juridical Science in Lille (1937).  His dissertation on Contracts in Private and International Law was written in French and published in Paris by Domat-Montchrestien in 1938.

==A young man==
Following graduation, Lenczowski entered the Polish Foreign Service as a junior diplomat, and was stationed in the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]], acting as consular officer and liaison between the British authorities and [[Jewish]] [[Aliya Bet|immigrants]] from Poland.  He was witness to the growing numbers of Jews desperate to escape Eastern Europe.  "He was involved in what was a very difficult and delicate process," said Lenczowski's son, "The British were trying to control the immigration and the Arabs didn't want the immigration." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://polishclub.org/English%20Version/Memorials/george_lenczowski.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-02-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823103341/http://www.polishclub.org/English%20Version/Memorials/george_lenczowski.htm |archivedate=2007-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Poland was [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invaded]] and occupied by Germany and [[Soviet invasion of Poland (1939)|later]] by the [[Soviet Union]] in 1939, Lenczowski's Palestine assignment came to an end.  In 1940 he volunteered to serve in the [[Polish Independent Carpathian Brigade]] which had moved out from Vichy controlled [[Vichy France|French Syria]] to Palestine.  He saw action in Egypt and Libya, but most prominently at the siege of [[Siege of Tobruk|Tobruk]], and advanced to the rank of second lieutenant. At the end of 1941, however, he was recalled by the Polish Foreign Service to be stationed, as press attaché, at the Polish Embassy in Tehran, [[Iran]]. There he was part of the effort to receive, process and assist some two million Poles, who had just been released from Soviet concentration camps upon the intervention of Britain.

It was there that he met his future wife, Bronia, who herself had been a prisoner of the Soviets; they were wed in March 1943.  He was also in Tehran during the 1943 [[Tehran Conference]] involving [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Joseph Stalin]].  Tragedy struck at this time also, when his parents were arrested by the Germans during the [[Warsaw uprising]] and executed in a concentration camp.

==To America==
When the [[Yalta Conference|Yalta accord]] was signed in 1945, the Lenczowskis refused to serve in Stalin's communist government in Poland and sought refuge in the United States.  After a year of graduate study at [[Johns Hopkins University]], and occasional work for the Foreign Broadcasting Division of the Department of State, Lenczowski found employment as instructor, and later assistant professor, at Hamilton College in New York State. It was here that he came to the attention of [[Peter Odegard]], one of the pivotal figures of the discipline of political science of the time and chair of the Berkeley department. He became a U.S. citizen in 1951.

==At Berkeley==
Upon Odegard's invitation, Lenczowski came to Berkeley in 1952 as a visiting associate professor; after another year of research and language study in [[Lebanon]], he became a tenured member of the faculty. Lenczowski made his scholarly debut in the United States by publishing ''Russia and the West in Iran'' (1949).  He soon followed this with his path-breaking work, ''The Middle East in World Affairs'' (1952). This book was republished, with appropriate revisions, in three later editions and has remained an authoritative text on the politics of the region for over three decades.  The fourth edition was reviewed by John C. Campbell in [[Foreign Affairs]] in 1980 and states, in part; "This new edition of a well-known survey is worth noting for the extensive additional material covering 18 years of kaleidoscopic events, and because it remains remarkably comprehensive and reliable both as an introduction to the region and as a reference work."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19800901fabook13651/george-lenczowski/the-middle-east-in-world-affairs-4th-ed.html Foreign Affairs - Book Review - The Middle East in World Affairs (4th Ed.) - George Lenczowski&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040122100244/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19800901fabook13651/george-lenczowski/the-middle-east-in-world-affairs-4th-ed.html |date=2004-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Berkeley, Lenczowski was the founder and first chair of the Committee (later Center) of Middle Eastern Studies. Over the years, he served as vice chair and was among the nation's first major scholars of the modern Middle East. As an undergraduate teacher he was respected for his precision and openness; as graduate advisor of his department and mentor of graduate students he raised a generation of scholars who, in tribute, published the volume, ''Ideology and Power in the Middle East: Essays in Honor of George Lenczowski'' (1988).

Gardner, then [[University of California]] president, spoke in the book's foreword of Lenczowski's "contributions to a better understanding of the Middle East, and particularly a better understanding of its international relations, its revolutions, and the crucial role of oil."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.berkeley.edu/news/berkeleyan/2000/03/08/obituaries.html 03.08.00 - Obituaries&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1949 and his death, Lenczowski authored six books and monographs, co-authored and co-edited two others, and published nearly 100 scholarly articles on Middle Eastern politics.  Lenczowski retired from Berkeley in 1985.  His last book, ''American Presidents and the Middle East'', was released in 1990.

==Beyond Berkeley==
George Lenczowski's scholarship is characterized by the accumulation of massive amounts of data, most of which he collected from personal encounters and field trips. He was aided by his fluency in Polish, English, French, German, Russian, Arabic, and [[Persian language|Persian]]. He was a master interviewer and was able to develop unusual rapport with his subjects.  "He knew mid-Eastern heads of state, he knew everyone," said Laurence Michalak, vice chairman of the [[Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Berkeley]], "He was friendly with the royalty of [[Iran]], [[Jordan]] and [[Saudi Arabia]]. He was a big, tall man with a Polish accent. He had a very courtly manner. He was very, very polished and very well liked." &lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  His reputation for objectivity made him welcome everywhere and earned him the respect of U.S. administrations of both political parties. He was a frequent visitor to the White House under both Democratic and Republican administrations.  
 
Lenczowski was invited to serve on the governing boards of numerous learned societies and centers of research.  He spoke or lectured at [[St Antony's College, Oxford]], the [[Hebrew University]] of Jerusalem, the universities of [[University of Geneva|Geneva]], [[University of Tehran|Tehran]], and [[University of Toronto|Toronto]], the [[American University of Beirut]], the Royal Institute of International Affairs ([[Chatham House]]), the [[National War College]] (Washington, D.C.), the [[United States Army War College|Army War College]] (Pennsylvania), and Stanford University's [[Hoover Institution]].  Lenczowski's humanism inspired in him a love of the law, a belief in social justice, and hope for world peace.

{{Jews and Judaism sidebar |History}}
The '''golden age of Jewish culture in Spain''' coincided with the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe, a period of [[Al-Andalus|Muslim rule]] throughout much of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. During intermittent periods of time, [[Jews]] were generally accepted in society and Jewish religious, cultural, and economic life blossomed. 

The nature and length of this "Golden Age" has been a subject of much debate, as there were at least three Golden Ages interrupted by periods of oppression of all non-Muslims. A few scholars give the start of the Golden Age as  711–718, the [[Umayyad Conquest of Iberia|Muslim conquest of Iberia]]. Others date it from 912, during the rule of [[Abd-ar-Rahman III]]. The end of the age is variously given as 1031, when the [[Caliph of Córdoba|Caliphate of Cordoba]] ended; 1066, the date of the [[1066 Granada massacre|Granada massacre]]; 1090, when the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravids]] invaded; or the mid-12th century, when the [[Almohades|Almohads]] invaded.

==The nature of the Golden Age==

Having invaded the areas throughout Southern Spain, and coming to rule in a matter of seven years, Islamic rulers were confronted with many questions relating to the implementation of Islamic Rule on a non-Islamic society. The coexistence of Muslims, Jews, and Christians during this time is revered by many writers. [[Al-Andalus]] was a key center of Jewish life during the early [[Middle Ages]], producing important scholars and one of the most stable and wealthy Jewish communities and a relatively educated society for the Muslim occupiers and their Jewish collaborators, as well as some Christians who openly collaborated with the Muslims and Jews. As [[Sefarad]], al-Andalus was the "capital" of world Judaism. 

[[María Rosa Menocal]], a specialist in Iberian literature at [[Yale University]], claims  that "tolerance was an inherent aspect of Andalusian society".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050828225825/http://twbookmark.com/books/52/0316566888/press_release.html The Ornament of the World by María Rosa Menocal]&lt;/ref&gt; Menocal's 2003 book, ''The Ornament of the World'', argues that the Jewish [[dhimmi]]s living under the Caliphate, while allowed fewer rights than Muslims, were still better off than in the Christian parts of Europe. Jews from other parts of Europe made their way to ''al-Andalus'', where in parallel to Christian sects regarded as heretical by Catholic Europe, they were not just tolerated, but where opportunities to practise faith and trades were open without restriction save for the prohibitions on [[proselytisation]] and, sometimes, on [[synagogue]] construction.

[[Bernard Lewis]] takes issue with this view, calling it ahistorical and exaggerated. He argues that Islam traditionally did not offer equality nor even pretend that it did, arguing that it would have been both a "theological as well as a logical absurdity."&lt;ref name = lewis&gt;Lewis, Bernard W (1984). ''The Jews of Islam''&lt;/ref&gt; However, also Lewis states:

{{Quotation|Generally, the Jewish people were allowed to practice their religion and live according to the laws and scriptures of their community. Furthermore, the restrictions to which they were subject were social and symbolic rather than tangible and practical in character. That is to say, these regulations served to define the relationship between the two communities, and not to oppress the Jewish population.&lt;ref name = lewis /&gt;|}} Jews were allowed certain freedoms but, like their Christian counterparts, were prohibited from having administrative authority over Muslims except in a few cases.

[[Mark R. Cohen|Mark Cohen]], Professor of Near Eastern Studies at [[Princeton University]], in his ''Under Crescent and Cross'', calls the idealized interfaith utopia a "myth" that was first promulgated by Jewish historians such as [[Heinrich Graetz]] in the 19th century as a rebuke to Christian countries for their treatment of Jews.&lt;ref name = cohen&gt;{{cite book |last= Cohen |first= Mark R. |title= Under Crescent and Cross |publisher= [[Princeton University Press]] |date=October 1995 |isbn= 0-691-01082-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This myth was met with the "counter-myth" of the "neo-lachrymose conception of Jewish-Arab history" by [[Bat Yeor]] and others,&lt;ref name = cohen /&gt; which also "cannot be maintained in the light of historical reality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= The Jewish Quarterly Review |year=1997 |volume=88 |issue=1/2 |pages=76–78|doi=10.2307/1455066 |title=  Review of Under Crescent and Cross. The Jews in the Middle Ages by Mark R. Cohen |author= Daniel J. Lasker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth of the Golden Age==
Prior to 581, the Jews experienced a Golden Age under the Arian Visigoth occupiers of Spain.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} The [[Visigoths]] were mainly indifferent towards Jews and allowed them to grow and prosper. After the [[Visigoths]] joined the [[Catholic Church]], they placed ever greater economic burdens on the Jewish population, and later persecuted them severely. It is possible that Jews welcomed the [[Muslim]] [[Arab]] and mainly [[Berber people|Berber]] conquerors in the 8th century.

A period of tolerance dawned for the Jews of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], whose number was considerably augmented by immigration from North Africa in the wake of the Muslim conquest.{{cn|date=April 2018}} North African Jewish immigrants  and immigrants from the Middle East bolstered the Jewish population, and made Muslim Spain probably the biggest center of contemporary Jews. Especially after 912, during the reign of [[Abd-ar-Rahman III]] and his son, [[Al-Hakam II]], the Jews prospered culturally, and some notable figures held high posts in the [[Caliphate of Cordoba]]. Jewish philosophers, mathematicians, astronomers, poets, and rabbinical scholars composed highly rich cultural and scientific work. Many devoted themselves to the study of the sciences and philosophy, composing many of the most valuable texts of [[Jewish Philosophy]]. Jews took part in the overall prosperity of Muslim [[Al-Andalus]]. Jewish economic expansion was unparalleled. In Toledo after the Christian reconquest in 1085, Jews were involved in translating Arabic texts to the romance languages in the so-called [[Toledo School of Translators]], as they had been previously in translating Greek and Hebrew texts into Arabic. Jews also contributed to [[botany]], [[geography]], [[medicine]], [[mathematics]], [[poetry]] and [[philosophy]].&lt;ref name="weiner"&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/Sephardim.html Sephardim] by Rebecca Weiner.&lt;/ref&gt;

'Abd al-Rahman's court physician and minister was [[Hasdai ibn Shaprut]], the patron of [[Menahem ben Saruq]], [[Dunash ben Labrat]], and other Jewish scholars and poets. In following centuries, Jewish thought flourished under famous figures such as [[Samuel Ha-Nagid]], [[Moses ibn Ezra]], [[Solomon ibn Gabirol]] and [[Judah Halevi]].&lt;ref name="weiner" /&gt; During 'Abd al-Rahman's  term of power, the scholar [[Moses ben Hanoch|Moses ben Enoch]] was appointed [[rabbi]] of [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], and as a consequence [[al-Andalus]] became the center of [[Talmud]]ic study, and [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] the meeting-place of Jewish savants.

This was a time of partial Jewish autonomy. As "[[dhimmi]]s", or "protected non-Muslims", Jews in the [[Islam]]ic world paid the [[jizya]], which was administered separately from the [[zakat]] paid by Muslims. The [[jizya]] has been viewed variously as a head tax, as payment for non-conscription in the military (as non-Muslims were normally prohibited from bearing arms or receiving martial training), or as a tribute. Jews had their own [[legal system]] and [[social services]]. [[Monotheism|Monotheist]] religions of the [[people of the book]] were tolerated but conspicuous displays of faith, such as bells and processions, were discouraged.&lt;ref&gt;Fred J. Hill et al., ''A History of the Islamic World'' 2003 {{ISBN|0-7818-1015-9}}, p.73&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparing the treatment of Jews in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]] and medieval [[Christendom|Christian Europe]], the Jews were far more integrated in [[Political aspects of Islam|the political]] and [[Islamic economics in the world|economic life of Islamic society]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Under Crescent and Cross: The Jews in the Middle Ages|author=[[Mark R. Cohen]]|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|year=1995|isbn=0-691-01082-X|pages=66–7 &amp; 88|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fgbib5exskUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=cohen+Under+Crescent+and+Cross&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3n9XnQiShQ&amp;sig=LNPYLaAtXOFB_WS0tV9IuwsCRGY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ra6_S8ycOIb20wSNtsydCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2010-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and usually faced far less violence from [[Muslim]]s, though there were some instances of persecution in the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]] as well from the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Under Crescent and Cross: The Jews in the Middle Ages|author=[[Mark R.

Cohen]]|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|year=1995|isbn=0-691-01082-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fgbib5exskUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=cohen+Under+Crescent+and+Cross&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3n9XnQiShQ&amp;sig=LNPYLaAtXOFB_WS0tV9IuwsCRGY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ra6_S8ycOIb20wSNtsydCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2010-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other authors criticize the modern notion of Al-Andalus being a tolerant society of equal opportunities for all religious groups as a "myth".&lt;ref name="Fernández-Morera, 2006, 29"&gt;Darío Fernández-Morera: [http://www.mmisi.org/ir/41_02/fernandez-morera.pdf "The Myth of the Andalusian Paradise"], ''The Intercollegiate Review'', Fall 2006, pp.&amp;nbsp;23–31&lt;/ref&gt; Jews were living in an uneasy coexistence with Muslims and Catholics, and the relationship between these groups was more often than not marked by segregation and mutual hostility. In the [[1066 Granada massacre]] of much of the Jewish population of the city, the Jewish death toll was higher than in the much publicized Christian pogromes in the [[Rhineland]] slightly later.&lt;ref name="Fernández-Morera, 2006, 29"/&gt; The notable Jewish philosopher [[Moses Maimonides]] (1135–1204) was forced to flee from Al-Andalus to avoid conversion by the Almohads. In Letter to Yemen, Maimonides wrote:

{{Quotation|Dear brothers, because of our many sins Hashem has cast us among this nation, the Arabs, who are treating us badly. They pass laws designed to cause us distress and make us despised. ... Never has there been a nation that hated, humiliated and loathed us as much as this one.&lt;ref name="Finkel"&gt;Avraham Yaakov Finkel (translator): "Rambam: Selected Letters of Maimonides", Yeshivat Beit Moshe, Scranton, PA, 1994, {{ISBN|0-9626226-3-X}}, p.&amp;nbsp;58&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

==End of the Golden Age==
With the death of Al-Hakam II in 976, the Caliphate began to dissolve, and the position of the Jews became more precarious under the various smaller kingdoms.{{cn|date=August 2018}} The first major persecution was the [[1066 Granada massacre]], which occurred on 30 December, when a Muslim mob stormed the royal palace in [[Granada]], [[crucifixion|crucified]] [[Jew]]ish [[vizier]] [[Joseph ibn Naghrela]] and massacred many of the Jewish population of the city. According to one source, "more than 1,500 Jewish families, numbering 4,000 persons, fell in one day."&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=412&amp;letter=G&amp;search=Granada Granada] by Richard Gottheil, [[Meyer Kayserling]], ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''. 1906 ed.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first persecution of Jews on the Peninsula under Islamic rule.
[[Image:Manuscript page by Maimonides Arabic in Hebrew letters.jpg|thumb|150px|Manuscript page by [[Maimonides]], one of the greatest Jewish scholars of Al Andalus, born in [[Córdoba (Spain)|Córdoba]]. [[Arabic language]] in [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] letters]]

Beginning in 1090, the situation deteriorated further with the invasion of the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravids]], a puritan Muslim sect from [[Morocco]]. Even under the Almoravids, some Jews prospered (although far more so under [[Ali ibn Yusuf|Ali III]], than under his father [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]]). Among those who held the title of "[[vizier]]" or "[[Nasi (Hebrew title)|nasi]]" in Almoravid times were the poet and physician [[Abu Ayyub Solomon ibn al-Mu'allam]], [[Abraham ibn Meïr ibn Kamnial]], [[Abu Isaac ibn Muhajar]], and [[Solomon ibn Farusal]]. The Almoravids were ousted from the peninsula in 1148; however, the region was again invaded, this time by the even more puritanical [[Almohades]].

During the reign of these Berber dynasties, many Jewish and even Muslim scholars left the Muslim-controlled portion of Iberia for the city of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], which had been [[Reconquista|reconquered]] in 1085 by Christian forces.

The major Jewish presence in Iberia continued until the Jews were forced to leave or to convert to Christianity in the [[Alhambra decree]] of 1492 and a similar [[Portuguese Inquisition|decree]] by  [[Portugal]] in 1496.

The museum carries out educational and scientific programs on Armenian history and culture as well.

== History ==
[[File:Plaza de la República, Ereván, Armenia, 2016-10-02, DD 113-114 HDR.jpg|thumb|Frontal view of the building at night.]]
On 9 September 1919, the [[National Assembly of Armenia]] founded the History Museum of Armenia. The museum opened to visitors on August 20, 1921. Its first director was [[Yervand Lalayan]].
Originally named the Ethnographic-Anthropological Museum-Library, it has been renamed several times, first to the State Central Museum of Armenia (1926), then to the Historical Museum (1935),  even later to the State History Museum of Armenia (1962), more recently to the Cultural-Historical Museum (2000), and finally to the History Museum of Armenia (since 2003). 
The History Museum of Armenia was formed using the collections of the Armenian Ethnographical Association of the Caucasus, the [[Nakhichevan-on-Don|Nor Nakhijevan]] Museum of Armenian Antiquities, the Museum of Antiquities of [[Ani]], and the [[Vagharshapat]] Repository of Ancient Manuscripts. The original collection numbered 15,289 objects.

In 1935, the Central Committee of the [[Communist Party of Armenia (Soviet Union)|Communist Party of Armenia]], established separate museums. These museums received items that originally were part of the History Museum of Armenia:
* The Museum of Art of the Armenian SSR, was organized according to the History Museum’s Department of Art (the present-day [[National Gallery of Armenia]]) and received 1,660 objects.
* The Museum of Literature, (the present-day [[Charents Museum of Literature and Arts|Charents Museum of Literature and Art]]) was formed from the History Museum’s Department of Literature and received 301 objects and 1,298 manuscripts.
* The State Museum of Ethnography was founded in 1978 and received 1,428 objects and 584 photographs.

The History Museum of Armenia continually replenishes its collections with finds from current excavations made at ancient Armenian sites by the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography and the [[Armenian National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences of Armenia]]. Other objects are obtained through purchases and donations. The museum represents an integral picture of the history and culture of Armenia, from [[prehistory]] to the present day. The museum also presents rare traces of cultural interrelations between ancient eastern societies in the [[Armenian Highlands]]. These ancient societies include [[Caucasus]], [[Crete]], [[Egypt]], [[Mitanni]], the [[Hattusa|Hittite Kingdom]], [[Assyria]], [[Iran]], the [[Seleucid Empire]], the [[Roman Empire]], and the [[Byzantine Empire]].

== Collections ==

* A large collection of 3rd to 2nd millennia BC bronze items.
* The historical-cultural heritage of [[Urartu]], consisting of cuneiform inscriptions, bronze statuettes, wall-paintings, painted ceramics, arms, and weapons with sculptural ornamentation, excavated from [[Teishebaini|Karmir Blur]], [[Erebuni Fortress|Arin-Berd]], and [[Armavir, Armenia|Argishtikhinili]].
* The cuneiform inscription of 782 BC about the foundation of the city of Erebuni (Yerevan), by the Urartian king [[Argishtis I of Urartu|Argishti I]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11015">The '''history of natural language processing''' describes the advances of [[natural language processing]]  ([[Outline of natural language processing]]). There is some overlap with the [[history of machine translation]] and the [[history of artificial intelligence]].

== Research and development ==
The history of machine translation dates back to the seventeenth century, when philosophers such as [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and [[Descartes]] put forward proposals for codes which would relate words between languages. All of these proposals remained theoretical, and none resulted in the development of an actual machine.

The first patents for "translating machines" were applied for in the mid-1930s. One proposal, by [[Georges Artsrouni]] was simply an automatic bilingual dictionary using [[paper tape]]. The other proposal, by [[Peter Troyanskii]], a [[Russians|Russian]], was more detailed. It included both the bilingual dictionary, and a method for dealing with grammatical roles between languages, based on [[Esperanto]]. 

In 1950, [[Alan Turing]] published his famous article "[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]" which proposed what is now called the [[Turing test]] as a criterion of intelligence. This criterion depends on the ability of a computer program to impersonate a human in a real-time written conversation with a human judge, sufficiently well that the judge is unable to distinguish reliably&amp;nbsp;— on the basis of the conversational content alone&amp;nbsp;— between the program and a real human.

In 1957, [[Noam Chomsky]]’s [[Syntactic Structures]] revolutionized Linguistics with '[[universal grammar]]', a rule based system of syntactic structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| title = SEM1A5 - Part 1 - A brief history of NLP
| accessdate = 2010-06-25
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Georgetown-IBM experiment|Georgetown experiment]] in 1954 involved fully automatic translation of more than sixty Russian sentences into English. The authors claimed that within three or five years, machine translation would be a solved problem.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchins, J. (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;  However, real progress was much slower, and after the [[ALPAC|ALPAC report]] in 1966, which found that ten years long research had failed to fulfill the expectations, funding for machine translation was dramatically reduced.  Little further research in machine translation was conducted until the late 1980s, when the first [[statistical machine translation]] systems were developed.

Some notably successful NLP systems developed in the 1960s were [[SHRDLU]], a natural language system working in restricted "[[blocks world]]s" with restricted vocabularies.

In 1969 [[Roger Schank]] introduced the [[conceptual dependency theory]] for natural language understanding.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Schank]], 1969, ''A conceptual dependency parser for natural language'' Proceedings of the 1969 conference on Computational linguistics, Sång-Säby, Sweden, pages 1-3&lt;/ref&gt; This model, partially influenced by the work of [[Sydney Lamb]], was extensively used by Schank's students at [[Yale University]], such as Robert Wilensky, Wendy Lehnert, and [[Janet Kolodner]].

In 1970, William A. Woods introduced the [[augmented transition network]] (ATN) to represent natural language input.&lt;ref&gt;Woods, William A (1970). "Transition Network Grammars for Natural Language Analysis". Communications of the ACM 13 (10): 591–606 [http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED037733&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED037733]&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of ''[[phrase structure rules]]'' ATNs used an equivalent set of [[finite state automata]] that were called recursively. ATNs and their more general format called "generalized ATNs" continued to be used for a number of years.During the 70's many programmers began to write 'conceptual ontologies', which structured real-world information into computer-understandable data.  Examples are MARGIE (Schank, 1975), SAM (Cullingford, 1978), PAM (Wilensky, 1978), TaleSpin (Meehan, 1976), QUALM (Lehnert, 1977), Politics (Carbonell, 1979), and Plot Units (Lehnert 1981).  During this time, many [[chatterbots]] were written including [[PARRY]], [[Racter]], and [[Jabberwacky]].

{{anchor|Machine learning}}
Up to the 1980s, most NLP systems were based on complex sets of hand-written rules.  Starting in the late 1980s, however, there was a revolution in NLP with the introduction of [[machine learning]] algorithms for language processing.  This was due both to the steady increase in computational power resulting from [[Moore's Law]] and the gradual lessening of the dominance of [[Noam Chomsky|Chomskyan]] theories of linguistics (e.g. [[transformational grammar]]), whose theoretical underpinnings discouraged the sort of [[corpus linguistics]] that underlies the machine-learning approach to language processing.&lt;ref&gt;Chomskyan linguistics encourages the investigation of "[[corner case]]s" that stress the limits of its theoretical models (comparable to [[pathological (mathematics)|pathological]] phenomena in mathematics), typically created using [[thought experiment]]s, rather than the systematic investigation of typical phenomena that occur in real-world data, as is the case in [[corpus linguistics]].  The creation and use of such [[text corpus|corpora]] of real-world data is a fundamental part of machine-learning algorithms for NLP.  In addition, theoretical underpinnings of Chomskyan linguistics such as the so-called "[[poverty of the stimulus]]" argument entail that general learning algorithms, as are typically used in machine learning, cannot be successful in language processing.  As a result, the Chomskyan paradigm discouraged the application of such models to language processing.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the earliest-used machine learning algorithms, such as [[decision tree]]s, produced systems of hard if-then rules similar to existing hand-written rules.  Increasingly, however, research has focused on [[statistical natural language processing|statistical models]], which make soft, [[probabilistic]] decisions based on attaching [[real-valued]] weights to the features making up the input data. The [[cache language model]]s upon which many [[speech recognition]] systems now rely are examples of such statistical models.  Such models are generally more robust when given unfamiliar input, especially input that contains errors (as is very common for real-world data), and produce more reliable results when integrated into a larger system comprising multiple subtasks.

Many of the notable early successes occurred in the field of [[machine translation]], due especially to work at IBM Research, where successively more complicated statistical models were developed.  These systems were able to take advantage of existing multilingual [[text corpus|textual corpora]] that had been produced by the [[Parliament of Canada]] and the [[European Union]] as a result of laws calling for the translation of all governmental proceedings into all official languages of the corresponding systems of government.  However, most other systems depended on corpora specifically developed for the tasks implemented by these systems, which was (and often continues to be) a major limitation in the success of these systems.  As a result, a great deal of research has gone into methods of more effectively learning from limited amounts of data.

Recent research has increasingly focused on [[unsupervised learning|unsupervised]] and [[semi-supervised learning|semi-supervised]] learning algorithms.  Such algorithms are able to learn from data that has not been hand-annotated with the desired answers, or using a combination of annotated and non-annotated data.  Generally, this task is much more difficult than [[supervised learning]], and typically produces less accurate results for a given amount of input data.  However, there is an enormous amount of non-annotated data available (including, among other things, the entire content of the [[World Wide Web]]), which can often make up for the inferior results.

'''Ian Hancock''' ([[Romani language|Romani]]: '''Yanko le Redžosko''', born 29 August 1942) is a linguist, [[Romani people|Romani]] scholar and political advocate. He was born and raised in England and is one of the main contributors in the field of [[Romani studies]].

He is director of the Program of Romani Studies and the Romani Archives and Documentation Center at [[The University of Texas at Austin]], where he has been a professor of English, linguistics and Asian studies since 1972. He has represented the [[Romani people]] at the United Nations and served as a member of the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|US Holocaust Memorial Council]] under President [[Bill Clinton]], who, Hancock claims, has Romani ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Hancock: ''We Are the Romani People (Ame Sam E Rromane Džene)'', [[Hertfordshire]], Great Britain. [[University of Hertfordshire]] Press 2002. [https://books.google.com/books?id=MG0ahVw-kdwC&amp;pg=PA130 Page 130].&lt;/ref&gt; He also represented the Romani people at the 1997 [[Rafto Prize]] award.

==Early life==
Hancock was born in London in 1942. His mother, Kitty, is [[Romanichal]]; his father, Reginald (Redžo), was part [[Romungro]], the descendant of a Hungarian speaker of [[North Central Romani]] named Imre Benczi. He acquired the surname Hancock by Imre's daughter, Maria, who married a member of an English [[West Country]] showman family of that name.

In the late 1960s, he became a Romani rights activist after reading reports about [[anti-Romani discrimination in Britain]]. In particular, he took up the cause of Romani rights after reading about an incident in which Romani children left unattended by their parents, who had been arrested, had started a fire by knocking over a paraffin lamp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utexas.edu/cola/depts/linguistics/faculty/ianh|publisher=University of Texas at Austin Department of Linguistics |title=Ian Hancock |accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, he graduated with a Ph.D. in linguistics.&lt;ref name="UT"&gt;{{cite web |publisher= [[University of Texas at Austin]] |work=What's in a Name?: Professor takes on roles of Romani activist and spokesperson to improve plight of his ethnic group |url=http://www.utexas.edu/features/archive/2003/romani.html |title=UT report on Dr. Hancock |deadurl=yes |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20050205135317/http://www.utexas.edu/features/archive/2003/romani.html |archivedate=February 5, 2005 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Romani studies==
{{see also|Romani studies}}
Hancock has published more than 300 books and articles on the Romani people and [[Romani language|language]] (particularly the [[Vlax Romani language|Vlax dialect]]). These works analyse the Romani people through not only Romani linguistics but also history, anthropology, and genetics. He has also appeared in the documentary ''American Gypsy.'' He is currently writing a book called ''On Romani Origins and Identity''.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Hancock. ''On Romani Origins and Identity''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hancock supports some of [[Ralph Lilley Turner]]'s views on [[Romani history]] based on the Romani language. In particular, Hancock agrees that the [[Dom people|Dom]] left India much earlier than the Romani people ie before 1000 AD. In fact, he claims that the Indian musicians mentioned in the ''[[Shah-Nameh]]'' and the ''atsingani'' mentioned in ''The Life of St. George the Anchorite'', both of which were previously believed to be ancestors of the Romani people, may have been the ancestors of the Domari people but not of the Romani people. He considers it possible that the [[Bosha (Roma)|Lom]] split off from the Romani people on reaching [[Armenia]].

Contrary to the popular view that the Romani people are descended from [[low-caste Indians]] who brought their occupations to Europe, he argues that the Romani people are descended from Indian prisoners of war of [[Mahmud of Ghazni]]. As evidence, he points to the presence of Indic words specifically of military origin and to a [[Banjara]] oral legend telling of Rajputs who left India through the [[Himalayas]] during the Ghaznavid invasions and never returned.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Hancock. "The Emergence of Romani as a Koïné Outside of India." ''Scholarship and the Gypsy Struggle: Commitment in Romani Studies'', Hertfordshire, Great Britain. University of Hertfordshire Press 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

He also believes that the Romani language originates in a [[koine language]], which he calls "Rajputic," between the many Indian languages spoken by the prisoners of war. He finds it thus similar to several other Indian languages, especially [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]].

As for Romani history, he points out a "Pariah syndrome" throughout time and space, culminating in the [[Porajmos|attempted genocide]] at the hands of Nazi authorities that was simultaneous to that of the Jews and part of the same "[[Final Solution]] of the Jewish and Gypsy Problem" project.

==Creole language studies==
Hancock is as well known in the field of linguistics, particularly in the area of [[pidgin]] and [[creole language]]s, as he is in the world of Romani studies and Romani social activism. In addition to his research on the [[Krio language|Krio]] language of [[Sierra Leone]], he has studied the [[Gullah language]], of coastal [[South Carolina]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and the [[Afro-Seminole Creole]] language, spoken by a community of [[Black Seminole]] descendants in [[Brackettville, Texas]].  Hancock was the first scholar to report Afro-Seminole Creole. He later identified another variety of that language spoken among Black Seminole descendants in the village of {{ill|El Nacimiento|es}} in the Mexican state of [[Coahuila]], where their ancestors had settled in 1850. He maintains that Afro-Seminole Creole and Gullah are closely related languages, as Black Seminoles were descended primarily from Gullah people of the Low Country of [[South Carolina Lowcountry|South Carolina]] and [[Lower Coastal Plain (Georgia)|Georgia]].

Hancock is recognised as one of the founders of the field of pidgin and [[creole linguistics]]. He has also done extensive research on the English-based creole languages spoken in West Africa and the West Indies. He is known especially for his views on the historical development of these languages. He maintains that all the English-based pidgins and creoles spoken in the Atlantic basin region, both in West Africa and in the Caribbean, belong to a single language family, which he calls the "English-based Atlantic Creoles."  He argues that all of them can be traced back to what he calls [[West African Pidgin English|Guinea Coast Creole English]], which arose along the West African Coast in the 17th and 18th centuries, as a language of commerce in the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. He says that [[Guinea Coast]] Creole English was spoken in coastal slave trading bases such as [[James Island (The Gambia)|James Island]], [[Bunce Island]], and [[Elmina Castle]], where the offspring of British slave traders and their African wives used it as their native language.

Hancock says that Guinea Coast Creole English ultimately gave rise to the pidgin and creole languages spoken in West Africa today, such as the [[Aku language]] in the Gambia, Sierra Leone Krio, [[Nigerian Pidgin English]] and [[Cameroonian Pidgin English]]. He also maintains that some of the Africans taken as slaves to the New World already spoke Guinea Coast Creole English in Africa. Their creole speech influenced the development of creole languages spoken today on the American side of the Atlantic, such as [[Gullah language|Gullah]], [[Afro-Seminole Creole]], [[Bahamian Dialect]], [[Jamaican Creole]], [[Belizean Kriol language|Belizean Kriol]], [[Guyanese Creole]], and [[Sranan Tongo]] in Suriname.

Hancock's views on the connections among the Atlantic creole languages is controversial. The strong similarities among these languages are undeniable, but many linguists prefer to explain the similarities by convergence rather than historical relationships. Other scholars argue that both factors played a role in the formation of the languages. Another group of linguists subscribes to a theory that attributes creole similarities (which extend to Indian Ocean creoles and [[Hawaiian Creole]]) to an innate "bioprogram" for language that emerges under the conditions common to most creole communities.

'''Individualist anarchism''' refers to several traditions of thought within the [[anarchist]] movement that emphasize the [[individual]] and their [[Will (philosophy)|will]] over external determinants such as groups, society, traditions and ideological systems.&lt;ref name="ryner"&gt;"What do I mean by individualism? I mean by individualism the moral doctrine which, relying on no dogma, no tradition, no external determination, appeals only to the individual conscience".

To say that the sovereignty of the individual is conditioned by Liberty is simply another way of saying that it is conditioned by itself. "Anarchism and the State" in ''Individual Liberty''&lt;/ref&gt; Individualist anarchism is not a single philosophy, but it refers to a group of [[Individualism|individualistic]] philosophies that sometimes are in conflict. [[Benjamin Tucker]], a famous 19th century individualist anarchist, held that "if the individual has the right to govern himself, all external government is tyranny".&lt;ref name="Tucker state"&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink=Benjamin R.

Among the early influences on individualist anarchism were [[William Godwin]],&lt;ref name=godwinsep&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=godwin |title=William Godwin |last=Philip  |first=Mark|date=2006-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Josiah Warren]] ("[[sovereignty of the individual]]"), [[Max Stirner]] ([[Egoist anarchism|egoism]]),&lt;ref name=stirnersep&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=max-stirner |title=Max Stirner |last=Leopold |first=David|date=2006-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lysander Spooner]] ("[[natural law]]"), [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] ([[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]]), [[Henry David Thoreau]] ([[transcendentalism]]),&lt;ref name="thoreau"&gt;"Paralelamente, al otro lado del atlántico, en el diferente contexto de una nación a medio hacer, los Estados Unidos, otros filósofos elaboraron un pensamiento individualista similar, aunque con sus propias especificidades. Henry David Thoreau (1817–1862), uno de los escritores próximos al movimiento de la filosofía trascendentalista, es uno de los más conocidos. Su obra más representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una cabaña en el bosque, y vivir en íntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosofía trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armonía de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por Jonh Zerzan. Para George Woodcock, esta actitud puede estar también motivada por una cierta idea de resistencia al progreso y de rechazo al materialismo creciente que caracteriza la sociedad norteamericana de mediados de siglo XIX."[http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf "Voluntary non-submission.

Individualist anarchism of different kinds have a few things in common. These are the following:

1. The concentration on the [[individual]] and their will in preference to any construction such as [[morality]], [[ideology]], social custom, [[religion]], metaphysics, [[Invention|ideas]] or the will of others.&lt;ref name="individualism"&gt;"En la vida de todo único, todo vínculo, independientemente de la forma en que éste se presente, supone una cadena que condiciona, y por tanto elimina la condición de persona libre. Ello supone dos consecuencias; la libertad se mantendrá al margen de toda categoría moral. Este último concepto quedará al margen del vocabulario estirneriano, puesto que tanto ética como moral serán dos conceptos absolutos que, como tales, no pueden situarse por encima de la voluntad individual. La libertad se vive siempre al margen de cualquier condicionamiento material o espiritual, "más allá del bien y del mal" como enunciará Nietzsche en una de sus principales obras. Las creencias colectivas, los prejuicios compartidos, los convencionalismos sociales serán, pues, objeto de destrucción."[http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf "Voluntary non-submission. Spanish individualist anarchism during dictatorship and the second republic (1923–1938)"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723130358/http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf |date=July 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="individualism2"&gt;"Stirner himself, however, has no truck with "higher beings." Indeed, with the aim of concerning himself purely with his own interests, he attacks all "higher beings," regarding them as a variety of what he calls "spooks," or ideas to which individuals sacrifice themselves and by which they are dominated. First amongst these is the abstraction "Man", into which all unique individuals are submerged and lost. As he put it, "liberalism is a religion because it separates my essence from me and sets it above me, because it exalts 'Man' to the same extent as any other religion does to God... it sets me beneath Man." Indeed, he "who is infatuated with Man leaves persons out of account so far as that infatuation extends, and floats in an ideal, sacred interest. Man, you see, is not a person, but an ideal, a spook." [p. 176 and p. 79] Among the many "spooks" Stirner attacks are such notable aspects of capitalist life as private property, the division of labour, the state, religion, and (at times) society itself. We will discuss Stirner's critique of capitalism before moving onto his vision of an egoist society and how it relates to social anarchism. [http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionG6 "G.6 What are the ideas of Max Stirner"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123154932/http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionG6 |date=November 23, 2010 }} in [[An Anarchist FAQ]]&lt;/ref&gt;

2. The rejection of or reservations about the idea of [[revolution]], seeing it as a time of mass uprising which could bring about new hierarchies. Instead, they favor more [[evolutionary]] methods of bringing about anarchy through alternative experiences and experiments and education which could be brought about [[immediatism|today]].&lt;ref name="evolutionary"&gt;"The first is in regard to the means of action in the here and now (and so the manner in which anarchy will come about). Individualists generally prefer education and the creation of alternative institutions, such as mutual banks, unions, communes, etc. Such activity, they argue, will ensure that present society will gradually develop out of government into an anarchist one. They are primarily evolutionists, not revolutionists, and dislike social anarchists' use of direct action to create revolutionary situations."[http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionA3#seca31 "A.3.1 What are the differences between individualist and social anarchists?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123103313/http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionA3 |date=2010-11-23 }} in [[An Anarchist FAQ]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="evolution2"&gt;"Toda revolución, pues, hecha en nombre de principios abstractos como igualdad, fraternidad, libertad o humanidad, persigue el mismo fin; anular la voluntad y soberanía del individuo, para así poderlo dominar."[http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf La insumisión voluntaria. El anarquismo individualista español durante la dictadura y la segunda república (1923–1938)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723130358/http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf |date=July 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also because it is not seen as desirable for individuals to wait for revolution to start experiencing alternative experiences outside what is offered in the current social system.&lt;ref name="illegalists"&gt;"The wave of anarchist bombings and assassinations of the 1890s&amp;nbsp;... and the practice of illegalism from the mid-1880s to the start of the First World War&amp;nbsp;... were twin aspects of the same proletarian offensive, but were expressed in an individualist practice, one that complemented the great collective struggles against capital. The illegalist comrades were tired of waiting for the revolution. The acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins ("propaganda by the deed") and the anarchist burglars ("individual reappropriation") expressed their desperation and their personal, violent rejection of an intolerable society. Moreover, they were clearly meant to be exemplary, invitations to revolt."[http://recollectionbooks.com/siml/library/illegalistsDougImrie.htm THE "ILLEGALISTS" by Doug Imrie] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908072801/http://recollectionbooks.com/siml/library/illegalistsDougImrie.htm |date=September 8, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

3. The view that relationships with other persons or things can be in one's own interest only and can be as transitory and without compromises as desired since in individualist anarchism sacrifice is usually rejected. In this way, Max Stirner recommended [[Union of egoists|associations of egoists]].&lt;ref name="association"&gt;Finalmente, y este es un tema poco resuelto por el filósofo bávaro, resulta evidente que, a pesar de todo culto a la soberanía individual, es necesario y deseable que los individuos cooperen. Pero el peligro de la asociación conlleva la reproducción, an escala diferente, de una sociedad, y es evidente que en este contexto, los individuos deban renunciar a buena parte de su soberanía. Stirner propone "uniones de egoístas", formadas por individuos libres que pueden unirse episódicamente para colaborar, pero evitando la estabilidad o la permanencia."[http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf La insumisión voluntaria. El anarquismo individualista español durante la dictadura y la segunda república (1923–1938)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723130358/http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf |date=July 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="association2"&gt;"The unions Stirner desires would be based on free agreement, being spontaneous and voluntary associations drawn together out of the mutual interests of those involved, who would "care best for their welfare if they unite with others." [p.&amp;nbsp;309] The unions, unlike the state, exist to ensure what Stirner calls "intercourse," or "union" between individuals. To better understand the nature of these associations, which will replace the state, Stirner lists the relationships between friends, lovers, and children at play as examples. [No Gods, No Masters, vol. 1, p.&amp;nbsp;25] These illustrate the kinds of relationships that maximise an individual's self-enjoyment, pleasure, freedom, and individuality, as well as ensuring that those involved sacrifice nothing while belonging to them. Such associations are based on mutuality and a free and spontaneous co-operation between equals. As Stirner puts it, "intercourse is mutuality, it is the action, the commercium, of individuals." [p.&amp;nbsp;218] Its aim is "pleasure" and "self-enjoyment." Thus Stirner sought a broad egoism, one which appreciated others and their uniqueness, and so criticised the narrow egoism of people who forgot the wealth others are:
:"But that would be a man who does not know and cannot appreciate any of the delights emanating from an interest taken in others, from the consideration shown to others. That would be a man bereft of innumerable pleasures, a wretched character&amp;nbsp;... would he not be a wretched egoist, rather than a genuine Egoist?&amp;nbsp;... The person who loves a human being is, by virtue of that love, a wealthier man that someone else who loves no one." [No Gods, No Masters, vol. 1, p. 23]"[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/1931/secG6.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+06:43:10 What are the differences between individualist and social anarchists?]&lt;/ref&gt; Individual experience and exploration therefore is emphasized.

The [[Egoist anarchism|egoist form of individualist anarchism]], derived from the [[philosophy of Max Stirner]], supports the individual doing exactly what he pleases—taking no notice of God, state, or moral rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller |first=David |title=The Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought |year=1987 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |page=11|isbn=0631227814}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Stirner, rights were ''[[Reification (fallacy)|spooks]]'' in the mind, and he held that society does not exist but "the individuals are its reality"—he supported property by force of might rather than moral right.&lt;ref&gt;"What my might reaches is my property; and let me claim as property everything I feel myself strong enough to attain, and let me extend my actual property as fas as ''I'' entitle, that is, empower myself to take…" From ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'', quoted in {{cite book|last=Ossar |first=Michael |year=1980 |title=Anarchism in the Dramas of Ernst Toller |publisher=[[State University of New York Press]] |page=27|isbn=0873953932}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stirner advocated self-assertion and foresaw "associations of egoists" drawn together by respect for each other's ruthlessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=George Woodcock|last=Woodcock |first=George |year=2004 |title=Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements |publisher=Broadview Press |page=20|isbn=0140206221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster, [[American individualist anarchism]] "stresses the isolation of the individual  –  his right to his own tools, his mind, his body, and to the products of his labor. To the artist who embraces this philosophy it is "[[aesthetic]]" anarchism, to the reformer, ethical anarchism, to the independent mechanic, economic anarchism. The former is concerned with philosophy, the latter with practical demonstration. The economic anarchist is concerned with constructing a society on the basis of anarchism. Economically he sees no harm whatever in the private possession of what the individual produces by his own labor, but only so much and no more. The aesthetic and ethical type found expression in the [[transcendentalism]], [[humanitarianism]], and [[romanticism]] of the first part of the nineteenth century, the economic type in the pioneer life of the West during the same period, but more favorably after the Civil War".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.againstallauthority.org/NativeAmericanAnarchism.html ''NATIVE AMERICAN ANARCHISM A Study of Left-Wing American Individualism'' by Eunice Minette Schuster] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160213201445/http://www.againstallauthority.org/NativeAmericanAnarchism.html |date=February 13, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is for this reason that it has been suggested that in order to understand American individualist anarchism one must take into account "the social context of their ideas, namely the transformation of America from a pre-capitalist to a capitalist society [...] the non-capitalist nature of the early U.S. can be seen from the early dominance of self-employment (artisan and peasant production). At the beginning of the 19th century, around 80% of the working (non-slave) male population were self-employed. The great majority of Americans during this time were farmers working their own land, primarily for their own needs" and so "[i]ndividualist anarchism is clearly a form of [[artisan]]al [[socialism]] [...] while [[communist anarchism]] and [[anarcho-syndicalism]] are forms of industrial (or proletarian) socialism".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoshop.org/AnarchistFAQSectionG1#secg14 "G.1.4 Why is the social context important in evaluating Individualist Anarchism?"] in ''[[An Anarchist FAQ]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary individualist anarchist [[Kevin Carson]] characterizes American individualist anarchism saying that "[u]nlike the rest of the [[socialist]] movement, the individualist anarchists believed that the natural wage of labor in a free market was its product, and that economic exploitation could only take place when capitalists and landlords harnessed the power of the state in their interests. Thus, individualist anarchism was an alternative both to the increasing statism of the mainstream socialist movement, and to a [[classical liberal]] movement that was moving toward a mere apologetic for the power of big business".&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Carson. ''Organization Theory: A Libertarian Perspective''. BOOKSURGE. 2008. p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:L'anarchie (1907).png|thumb|''[[L'Anarchie]]'', [[Individualist anarchism in France|French individualist anarchist]] journal established in April 1905 by [[Albert Libertad]]]]
In [[European individualist anarchism]], a different social context helped the rise of European individualist [[illegalism]] and as such "[t]he illegalists were proletarians who had nothing to sell but their labour power, and nothing to discard but their dignity; if they disdained waged-work, it was because of its compulsive nature. If they turned to illegality it was due to the fact that honest toil only benefited the employers and often entailed a complete loss of dignity, while any complaints resulted in the sack; to avoid starvation through lack of work it was necessary to beg or steal, and to avoid conscription into the army many of them had to go on the run".&lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;[https://archive.org/download/bonnot_gang/bonnotgangfull.pdf Richard Parry. ''The Bonnot Gang: The Story of the French Illegalists'']&lt;/ref&gt; A European tendency of individualist anarchism advocated violent individual acts of [[individual reclamation]], [[propaganda by the deed]] and criticism of organization. Such individualist anarchist tendencies include French illegalism&lt;ref name="The Illegalists"&gt;[http://recollectionbooks.com/siml/library/illegalistsDougImrie.htm The "Illegalists"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908072801/http://recollectionbooks.com/siml/library/illegalistsDougImrie.htm|date=September 8, 2015}}, by Doug Imrie (published by [[Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Parry, Richard 1987. p. 15"&gt;Parry, Richard. The Bonnot Gang. Rebel Press, 1987. p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; and Italian anti-organizational [[Insurrectionary anarchism#19th century|insurrectionarism]].&lt;ref&gt;"Anarchist historian [[George Woodcock]] reports the incident in which the important Italian [[social anarchist]] [[Errico Malatesta]] became involved "in a dispute with the individualist anarchists of [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]], who insisted that anarchism implied no organization at all, and that every man must act solely on his impulses. At last, in one noisy debate, the individual impulse of a certain Ciancabilla directed him to shoot Malatesta, who was badly wounded but obstinately refused to name his assailant." Woodcock, George. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements.'' 1962&lt;/ref&gt; Bookchin reports that at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th "it was in times of severe social repression and deadening social quiescence that individualist anarchists came to the foreground of libertarian activity – and then primarily as terrorists. In France, Spain, and the United States, individualistic anarchists committed acts of terrorism that gave anarchism its reputation as a violently sinister conspiracy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://libcom.org/library/socanlifean2 Murray Bookchin]. ''[[Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism: An Unbridgeable Chasm]]'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important tendency within individualist anarchist currents emphasizes individual subjective exploration and defiance of social conventions. Individualist anarchist philosophy attracted "amongst artists, intellectuals and the well-read, urban middle classes in general".&lt;ref name="archive.org"/&gt; As such, [[Murray Bookchin]] describes a lot of individualist anarchism as people who "expressed their opposition in uniquely personal forms, especially in fiery tracts, outrageous behavior and aberrant lifestyles in the cultural ghettos of fin de siecle New York, Paris and London. As a credo, individualist anarchism remained largely a [[bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle, most conspicuous in its demands for sexual freedom ('free love') and enamored of innovations in art, behavior, and clothing".&lt;ref name="bohemian individualism"&gt;[http://libcom.org/library/socanlifean2 "2. Individualist Anarchism and Reaction" in Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism – An Unbridgeable Chasm]&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, [[free love]]&lt;ref name="freelove"/&gt;&lt;ref name="frenchexperimentation"/&gt; currents and other radical lifestyles such as [[naturism]]&lt;ref name="frenchexperimentation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="naturismo"/&gt; had popularity among individualist anarchists.

For Catalan historian [[Xavier Diez]], individualist anarchism "under its [[iconoclastic]], antiintelectual, [[antitheist]] run, which goes against all sacralized ideas or values it entailed, a philosophy of life which could be considered a reaction against the sacred gods of capitalist society. Against the idea of [[Nationalism|nation]], it opposed its [[Anationalism|internationalism]]. Against the exaltation of authority embodied in the [[military]] institution, it opposed its [[antimilitarism]]. Against the concept of [[industrial civilization]], it opposed its [[naturist]] vision".{{sfn|Díez|2007}}

In regards to economic questions, there are diverse positions. There are adherents to [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] (Proudhon, [[Émile Armand]] and early [[Benjamin Tucker]]), [[Egoist anarchism|egoistic]] disrespect for "ghosts" such as private property and markets (Stirner, [[John Henry Mackay]], [[Lev Chernyi]] and later Tucker) and adherents to [[anarcho-communism]] ([[Albert Libertad]], [[illegalism]] and [[Renzo Novatore]]).&lt;ref&gt;"revolution is the fire of our will and a need of our solitary minds; it is an obligation of the libertarian aristocracy. To create new ethical values. To create new aesthetic values. To communalize material wealth. To individualize spiritual wealth." [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Renzo_Novatore__Toward_the_Creative_Nothing.htm ''Towards the creative nothing''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130415220552/http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Renzo_Novatore__Toward_the_Creative_Nothing.htm |date=2013-04-15 }} by [[Renzo Novatore]]&lt;/ref&gt; Anarchist historian [[George Woodcock]] finds a tendency in individualist anarchism of a "distrust (of) all co-operation beyond the barest minimum for an [[Simple living|ascetic life]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[George Woodcock]]. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements''. 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

On the issue of violence opinions have gone from a violentist point of view mainly exemplified by [[illegalism]] and [[insurrectionary anarchism]] to one that can be called [[anarcho-pacifist]]. In the particular case of Spanish individualist anarchist [[Miguel Gimenez Igualada]], he went from illegalist practice in his youth&lt;ref&gt;"Selon l'historien Vladimir Muñoz, son véritable nom aurait été Miguel Ramos Giménez et il aurait participé au début du 20è siècle aux groupes illégalistes."[http://militants-anarchistes.info/spip.php?article2199&amp;lang=fr "GIMÉNEZ IGUALADA, Miguel" at Diccionaire International des Militants Anarchistes]&lt;/ref&gt; towards a pacifist position later in his life.&lt;ref&gt;Igualada argued for an anarchism that was "pacifist, poetic, which creates goodness, harmony and beauty, which cultivates a healthy sense of living in peace, sign of power and fertility&amp;nbsp;... from there anyone which is un-harmonious (violent-warrior), everyone that will pretend, in any form, to dominate anyone of his similars, is not an anarchist, since the anarchist respects in such a way personal integrity, so that he could not make anyone a slave of his thoughts so as to turn him into an instrument of his, a man-tool."[http://www.kclibertaria.comyr.com/lpdf/l125.pdf ''Anarquismo'' by Miguel Gimenez Igualada]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Most of the above arguments may be found much more at large in Burke's ''Vindication of Natural Society''; a treatise in which the evils of the existing political institutions are displayed with incomparable force of reasoning and lustre of eloquence…" – footnote, Ch. 2 ''[[Political Justice]]'' by William Godwin.&lt;/ref&gt; Godwin advocated extreme individualism, proposing that all cooperation in labor be eliminated.&lt;ref name=godwineb&gt;"[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9037183 Godwin, William]". (2006). In Britannica Concise Encyclopaedia. Retrieved December 7, 2006, from ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' Online.&lt;/ref&gt; Godwin was a utilitarian who believed that all individuals are not of equal value, with some of us "of more worth and importance" than others depending on our utility in bringing about social good. Therefore, he does not believe in equal rights, but the person's life that should be favored that is most conducive to the general good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Paul |last=McLaughlin |title=Anarchism and Authority: A Philosophical Introduction to Classical Anarchism |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, |year=2007 |page=119|isbn=0754661962}}&lt;/ref&gt; Godwin opposed government because it infringes on the individual's right to "private judgement" to determine which actions most maximize utility, but also makes a critique of all authority over the individual's judgement. This aspect of Godwin's philosophy, minus the utilitarianism, was developed into a more extreme form later by Stirner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Paul |last=McLaughlin |title=Anarchism and Authority: A Philosophical Introduction to Classical Anarchism |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, |year=2007 |page=123|isbn=0754661962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Godwin took individualism to the radical extent of opposing individuals performing together in orchestras, writing in ''[[Political Justice]]'' that "everything understood by the term co-operation is in some sense an evil".&lt;ref name=godwineb/&gt; The only apparent exception to this opposition to cooperation is the spontaneous association that may arise when a society is threatened by violent force. One reason he opposed cooperation is he believed it to interfere with an individual's ability to be benevolent for the greater good.

Godwin supported individual ownership of property, defining it as "the empire to which every man is entitled over the produce of his own industry".&lt;ref name=pj/&gt; However, he also advocated that individuals give to each other their surplus property on the occasion that others have a need for it, without involving trade (e.g. [[gift economy]]). Thus while people have the right to private property, they should give it away as enlightened [[altruists]]. This was to be based on [[utilitarian]] principles and he said: "Every man has a right to that, the exclusive possession of which being awarded to him, a greater sum of benefit or pleasure will result than could have arisen from its being otherwise appropriated".&lt;ref name=pj/&gt; However, benevolence was not to be enforced, being a matter of free individual "private judgement". He did not advocate a [[common ownership|community of goods]] or assert collective ownership as is embraced in [[communism]], but his belief that individuals ought to share with those in need was influential on the later development of [[anarcho-communism]].

Godwin's political views were diverse and do not perfectly agree with any of the ideologies that claim his influence as writers of the ''[[Socialist Standard]]'', organ of the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]], consider Godwin both an individualist and a communist;&lt;ref name="Godwin"&gt;"William Godwin, Shelly and Communism" by ALB, The Socialist Standard&lt;/ref&gt; [[Murray Rothbard]] did not regard Godwin as being in the individualist camp at all, referring to him as the "founder of [[communist anarchism]]";&lt;ref name="rothbard/burke"&gt;Rothbard, Murray.

[[William Godwin]]'s influenced "the socialism of [[Robert Owen]] and [[Charles Fourier]]. After success of his British venture, Owen himself established a cooperative community within the United States at New Harmony, Indiana during 1825. One member of this commune was [[Josiah Warren]] (1798–1874), considered to be the first individualist anarchist. After New Harmony failed Warren shifted his ideological loyalties from socialism to anarchism (which was no great leap, given that Owen's socialism had been predicated on Godwin's anarchism)".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Peter_Sabatini__Libertarianism__Bogus_Anarchy.html Peter Sabatini.

[[File:Pierre Joseph Proudhon.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], the first self-identified anarchist]]

"Political Economy from below : Communitarian Anarchism as a Neglected Discourse in Histories of Economic Thought". ''History of Economics Review'', No.31 Winter 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators do not identify Proudhon as an individualist anarchist due to his preference for association in large industries, rather than individual control.&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock, George. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements'', Broadview Press, 2004, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he was influential among some of the American individualists—in the 1840s and 1850s, [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]]&lt;ref&gt;Dana, Charles A. [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/proudhon/dana.html Proudhon and his "Bank of the People"] (1848).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William B. Greene]] introduced Proudhon's works to the United States. Greene adapted Proudhon's mutualism to American conditions and introduced it to [[Benjamin Tucker]].&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Benjamin R., "On Picket Duty", ''Liberty (Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order)'' (1881–1908); 5 January 1889; 6, 10; APS Online p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Proudhon opposed government privilege that protects capitalist, banking and land interests and the accumulation or acquisition of property (and any form of [[coercion]] that led to it) which he believed hampers competition and keeps wealth in the hands of the few. Proudhon favoured a right of individuals to retain the product of their labour as their own property, but believed that any property beyond that which an individual produced and could possess was illegitimate. Thus he saw private property as both essential to liberty and a road to tyranny, the former when it resulted from labour and was required for labour and the latter when it resulted in exploitation (profit, interest, rent and tax). He generally called the former "possession" and the latter "property". For large-scale industry, he supported workers associations to replace wage labour and opposed the ownership of land.

Proudhon maintained that those who labour should retain the entirety of what they produce and that [[monopoly|monopolies]] on credit and land are the forces that prohibit such. He advocated an economic system that included private property as possession and exchange market, but without profit, which he called [[mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]]. It is Proudhon's philosophy that was explicitly rejected by [[Joseph Dejacque]] in the inception of anarcho-communism, with the latter asserting directly to Proudhon in a letter that "it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature". An individualist rather than anarcho-communist,&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia Americana"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamilton 1995 79"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Faguet 1970 147"/&gt; Proudhon said that "communism [...] is the very denial of society in its foundation"&lt;ref&gt;Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph. ''The Philosophy of Misery: The Evolution of Capitalism''. BiblioBazaar, LLC (2006). {{ISBN|1-4264-0908-7}} p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; and famously declared that "[[property is theft]]!" in reference to his rejection of ownership rights to land being granted to a person who is not using that land.

After Dejacque and others split from Proudhon due to the latter's support of individual property and an exchange economy, the relationship between the individualists (who continued in relative alignment with the philosophy of Proudhon) and the anarcho-communists was characterised by various degrees of antagonism and harmony. For example, individualists like Tucker on the one hand translated and reprinted the works of [[collectivist anarchism|collectivists]] like [[Mikhail Bakunin]] while on the other hand rejected the economic aspects of collectivism and communism as incompatible with anarchist ideals.

==== Mutualism ====
{{main|Mutualism (economic theory)}}
Mutualism is an [[anarchist school of thought]] which can be traced to the writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, who envisioned a society where each person might possess a [[means of production]], either individually or collectively, with trade representing equivalent amounts of labor in the [[free market]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mutualist.org/ Mutualist.org Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt; Integral to the scheme was the establishment of a mutual-credit bank which would lend to producers at a minimal interest rate only high enough to cover the costs of administration.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, David. 1987. "Mutualism." The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Political Thought. Blackwell Publishing. p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Mutualism is based on a [[labor theory of value]] which holds that when labour or its product is sold, in exchange it ought to receive goods or services embodying "the amount of labor necessary to produce an article of exactly similar and equal utility".&lt;ref&gt;Tandy, Francis D., 1896, ''Voluntary Socialism'', chapter 6, paragraph 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Some mutualists believe that if the state did not intervene, as a result of increased competition in the marketplace, individuals would receive no more income than that in proportion to the amount of labor they exert.&lt;ref&gt;Tandy, Francis D., 1896, ''Voluntary Socialism'', chapter 6, paragraphs 9, 10 &amp; 22.&lt;br /&gt;Carson, Kevin, 2004, ''Studies in Mutualist Political Economy'', chapter 2 (after Meek &amp; Oppenheimer).&lt;/ref&gt; Mutualists oppose the idea of individuals receiving an income through loans, investments and rent as they believe these individuals are not labouring. Some of them argue that if state intervention ceased, these types of incomes would disappear due to increased competition in capital.&lt;ref&gt;Tandy, Francis D., 1896, ''Voluntary Socialism'', chapter 6, paragraph 19.&lt;br /&gt;Carson, Kevin, 2004, ''Studies in Mutualist Political Economy'', chapter 2 (after Ricardo, Dobb &amp; Oppenheimer).&lt;/ref&gt; Though Proudhon opposed this type of income, he expressed: "I never meant to [...] forbid or suppress, by sovereign decree, ground rent and interest on capital. I believe that all these forms of human activity should remain free and optional for all".&lt;ref&gt;''Solution of the Social Problem'', 1848–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Proudhonpropietat.JPG|thumb|left|200px|''[[What Is Property?]]'' (1840) by Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]
Insofar as they ensure the workers right to the full product of their labor, mutualists support [[Market (economics)|markets]] and [[private property]] in the product of labor. However, they argue for conditional titles to land, whose private ownership is legitimate only so long as it remains in use or occupation (which Proudhon called "possession").&lt;ref&gt;Swartz, Clarence Lee. [http://www.panarchy.org/swartz/mutualism.6.html What is Mutualism? VI. Land and Rent]&lt;/ref&gt;  Proudhon's Mutualism supports [[Worker cooperative|labor-owned cooperative firms]] and associations&lt;ref&gt;Hymans, E., ''Pierre-Joseph Proudhon'', pp. 190–91,&lt;br&gt;Woodcock, George. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements'', Broadview Press, 2004, pp. 110, 112&lt;/ref&gt; for "we need not hesitate, for we have no choice [...] it is necessary to form an ASSOCIATION among workers [...] because without that, they would remain related as subordinates and superiors, and there would ensue two [...] castes of masters and wage-workers, which is repugnant to a free and democratic society" and so "it becomes necessary for the workers to form themselves into democratic societies, with equal conditions for all members, on pain of a relapse into feudalism".&lt;ref&gt;''General Idea of the Revolution'', Pluto Press, pp. 215–16, 277&lt;/ref&gt; As for capital goods (man-made, non-land, "[[means of production]]"), mutualist opinion differs on whether these should be commonly managed public assets or private property.

Following Proudhon, mutualists originally considered themselves to be libertarian socialists. However, "some mutualists have abandoned the labor theory of value, and prefer to avoid the term "socialist." But they still retain some cultural attitudes, for the most part, that set them off from the [[libertarian right]]".&lt;ref name="mutualist.org"&gt;[http://www.mutualist.org/id32.html A Mutualist FAQ: A.4. Are Mutualists Socialists?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090609075437/http://www.mutualist.org/id32.html|date=2009-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mutualists have distinguished themselves from [[state socialism]] and do not advocate social control over the means of production. Benjamin Tucker said of Proudhon that "though opposed to socializing the ownership of capital, Proudhon aimed nevertheless to socialize its effects by making its use beneficial to all instead of a means of impoverishing the many to enrich the few [...] by subjecting capital to the natural law of competition, thus bringing the price of its own use down to cost".&lt;ref name="Tucker state"/&gt;

=== Max Stirner ===
{{main|Max Stirner}}
[[File:Max stirner.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Max Stirner]] by [[Friedrich Engels]]]]
Johann Kaspar Schmidt (October 25, 1806 – June 26, 1856), better known as Max Stirner (the ''[[nom de plume]]'' he adopted from a schoolyard nickname he had acquired as a child because of his high brow, in [[German language|German]] 'Stirn'), was a [[German people|German]] [[philosopher]], who ranks as one of the literary fathers of [[nihilism]], [[existentialism]], [[post-modernism]] and [[anarchism]], especially of individualist anarchism. Stirner's main work is ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'', also known as ''The Ego and His Own'' (''Der Einzige und sein Eigentum'' in German, which translates literally as ''The Only One [individual] and his Property''). This work was first published in 1844 in [[Leipzig]] and has since appeared in numerous editions and translations.

==== Egoism ====
{{main|Egoist anarchism|Philosophy of Max Stirner}}
{{see also|Ethical egoism|Moral nihilism}}
[[Max Stirner]]'s philosophy, sometimes called egoism, is a form of individualist anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=David Goodway|last=Goodway |first=David |title=[[Anarchist Seeds Beneath the Snow]] |publisher=Liverpool University Press |year=2006 |page=99|isbn=1846310261}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stirner was a [[Young Hegelians|Hegelian]] philosopher whose "name appears with familiar regularity in historically oriented surveys of anarchist thought as one of the earliest and best-known exponents of individualist anarchism".&lt;ref name=stirnersep/&gt; In 1844, his ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'' (''Der Einzige and sein Eigentum'' which may literally be translated as ''The Unique Individual and His Property'')&lt;ref&gt;Moggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press. p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; was published, which is considered to be "a founding text in the tradition of individualist anarchism".&lt;ref name=stirnersep/&gt; Stirner does not recommend that the individual try to eliminate the state, but simply that they disregard the state when it conflicts with one's autonomous choices and go along with it when doing so is conducive to one's interests.&lt;ref&gt;Moggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press, 2006 p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; He says that the egoist rejects pursuit of devotion to "a great idea, a good cause, a doctirine, a system, a lofty calling," saying that the egoist has no political calling, but rather "lives themselves out" without regard to "how well or ill humanity may fare thereby".&lt;ref&gt;Moggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press, 2006 p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; Stirner held that the only limitation on the rights of the individual is that individual's power to obtain what he desires.&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia Americana: A Library of Universal Knowledge. Encyclopedia Corporation. p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; He proposes that most commonly accepted social institutions—including the notion of State, property as a right, natural rights in general, and the very notion of society—were mere spooks in the mind. Stirner wants to "abolish not only the state but also society as an institution responsible for its members".&lt;ref&gt;Heider, Ulrike. ''Anarchism: Left, Right and Green'', San Francisco: City Lights Books, 1994, pp. 95–96&lt;/ref&gt; Stirner advocated self-assertion and foresaw [[Union of egoists]], non-systematic associations, which Stirner proposed in as a form of organization in place of the [[State (polity)|state]].&lt;ref name=karl&gt;{{cite book | last = Thomas | first = Paul | title = Karl Marx and the Anarchists | publisher = [[Routledge]]/[[Kegan Paul]] | location = London | year = 1985 | isbn = 0710206852 |page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Union is understood as a relation between egoists which is continually renewed by all parties' support through an act of will.&lt;ref name=woodcock20/&gt;&lt;ref name="nonserviam"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://i-studies.com/journal/n/pdf/nsi-17.pdf#page=13 |title=The union of egoists |journal=Non Serviam |volume=1 |first=Svein Olav |last=Nyberg |pages=13–14 |location=Oslo, Norway |publisher=Svein Olav Nyberg |oclc=47758413 |accessdate=1 September 2012 |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207042220/http://i-studies.com/journal/n/pdf/nsi-17.pdf |archivedate=7 December 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even murder is permissible "if it is right for me",&lt;ref&gt;Moggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press, 2006 p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; though it is claimed by egoist anarchists that egoism will foster genuine and spontaneous union between individuals.&lt;ref name=carlson&gt;{{cite book | last = Carlson | first = Andrew | title = Anarchism in Germany | publisher = Scarecrow Press | location = Metuchen | year = 1972 | isbn = 0810804840 | chapterurl = http://tmh.floonet.net/articles/carlson.html | chapter = Philosophical Egoism: German Antecedents | accessdate = 2008-12-04 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081210202509/http://tmh.floonet.net/articles/carlson.html | archivedate = 2008-12-10 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Stirner, property simply comes about through might: "Whoever knows how to take, to defend, the thing, to him belongs property". He further says: "What I have in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am the proprietor of the thing" and that "I do not step shyly back from your property, but look upon it always as my property, in which I respect nothing. Pray do the like with what you call my property!".&lt;ref&gt;Stirner, Max. The Ego and Its Own, p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; His concept of "egoistic property" not only a lack of moral restraint on how one obtains and uses ''things'', but includes other people as well.&lt;ref&gt;Moggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press, 2006 p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; His embrace of [[Egotism|egoism]] is in stark contrast to Godwin's [[altruism]]. Stirner was opposed to communism, seeing it as a form of authority over the individual.

This position on property is much different from the Native American, natural law, form of individualist anarchism, which defends the inviolability of the private property that has been earned through labor&lt;ref&gt;Weir, David. Anarchy &amp; Culture. [[University of Massachusetts Press]]. 1997. p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; and trade. However, Benjamin Tucker rejected the natural rights philosophy and adopted Stirner's egoism in 1886, with several others joining with him. This split the American individualists into fierce debate, "with the natural rights proponents accusing the egoists of destroying libertarianism itself."&lt;ref&gt;McElroy, Wendy.

[[File:Ein1844v2.png|thumb|200px|''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'' (1844) by Max Stirner]]
In Russia, individualist anarchism inspired by Stirner combined with an appreciation for [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] attracted a small following of bohemian artists and intellectuals such as [[Lev Chernyi]], as well as a few lone wolves who found self-expression in crime and violence.&lt;ref name=levy&gt;Levy, Carl.

Though Stirner's philosophy is individualist, it has influenced some libertarian communists and anarcho-communists. "For Ourselves Council for Generalized Self-Management" discusses Stirner and speaks of a "communist egoism", which is said to be a "synthesis of individualism and collectivism" and says that "greed in its fullest sense is the only possible basis of communist society".&lt;ref&gt;For Ourselves, {{cite web|url=http://home.teleport.com/~rasputin/RTBGreedy-v1_2_5-en.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228054533/http://home.teleport.com/~rasputin/RTBGreedy-v1_2_5-en.htm |archivedate=2008-12-28 |df= }} ''The Right to Be Greedy: Theses On The Practical Necessity Of Demanding Everything'', 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Forms of libertarian communism such as [[Situationist International|Situationism]] are influenced by Stirner.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Christopher Gray, ''Leaving the Twentieth Century'', p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcho-communist [[Emma Goldman]] was influenced by both Stirner and [[Peter Kropotkin]] and blended their philosophies together in her own as shown in books of hers such as ''Anarchism And Other Essays''.&lt;ref&gt;Emma Goldman, ''Anarchism and Other Essays'', p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Henry David Thoreau ====
{{main|Henry David Thoreau}}
[[File:Benjamin D. Maxham - Henry David Thoreau - Restored - greyscale - straightened.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Henry David Thoreau]]]]
[[Henry David Thoreau]] (1817–1862) was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the United States and Europe. Thoreau was an American author, poet, naturalist, tax resister, [[Development criticism|development critic]], surveyor, historian, philosopher and leading [[transcendentalist]]. He is best known for his book ''[[Walden]]'', a reflection upon [[simple living]] in natural surroundings; and his essay, ''[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]'', an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state. His thought is an early influence on [[green anarchism]], but with an emphasis on the individual experience of the natural world influencing later [[Anarcho-naturism|naturist]] currents,&lt;ref name="thoreau"/&gt; [[simple living]] as a rejection of a [[Economic materialism|materialist]] lifestyle&lt;ref name=thoreau/&gt; and [[self-sufficiency]] were Thoreau's goals and the whole project was inspired by transcendentalist philosophy. Many have seen in Thoreau one of the precursors of ecologism and [[anarcho-primitivism]] represented today in [[John Zerzan]]. For [[George Woodcock]], this attitude can be also motivated by certain idea of resistance to progress and of rejection of the growing materialism which is the nature of American society in the mid 19th century.&lt;ref name="naturismo"/&gt;

The essay [[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]] (''Resistance to Civil Government'') was first published in 1849. It argues that people should not permit governments to overrule or atrophy their consciences and that people have a duty to avoid allowing such [[acquiescence]] to enable the government to make them the agents of injustice. Thoreau was motivated in part by his disgust with [[slavery]] and the [[Mexican–American War]]. The essay later influenced [[Mohandas Gandhi]], [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], [[Martin Buber]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]] through its advocacy of [[nonviolent resistance]].&lt;ref name="ppu.org.uk"&gt;[http://www.ppu.org.uk/e_publications/dd-trad8.html#anarch%20and%20violence RESISTING THE NATION STATE the pacifist and anarchist tradition by Geoffrey Ostergaard]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the main precedent for [[anarcho-pacifism]].&lt;ref name="ppu.org.uk"/&gt; The American version of individualist anarchism has a strong emphasis on the [[non-aggression principle]] and [[Self-ownership|individual sovereignty]].&lt;ref name="Madison"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Madison, Charles A. |year=1945 |title=Anarchism in the United States |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=46–66 |doi=10.2307/2707055 |jstor=2707055 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some individualist anarchists such as Thoreau&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Ellwood.

[[File:Lucifer, The Light-Bearer.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''[[Lucifer the Lightbearer]]'', an influential American free love journal]]
An important current within individualist anarchism is free love.&lt;ref name="freelove"&gt;[http://www.ncc-1776.org/tle1996/le961210.html The Free Love Movement and Radical Individualism By Wendy McElroy]&lt;/ref&gt; Free love advocates sometimes traced their roots back to [[Josiah Warren]] and to experimental communities, and viewed sexual freedom as a clear, direct expression of an individual's [[self-ownership]]. Free love particularly stressed [[women's rights]] since most sexual laws, such as those governing marriage and use of birth control, discriminated against women.&lt;ref name="freelove"/&gt; The most important American free love journal was ''[[Lucifer the Lightbearer]]'' (1883–1907) edited by [[Moses Harman]] and [[Lois Waisbrooker]]&lt;ref&gt;Joanne E. Passet, "Power through Print: Lois Waisbrooker and Grassroots Feminism," in: ''Women in Print: Essays on the Print Culture of American Women from the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries'', James Philip Danky and Wayne A. Wiegand, eds., Madison, WI, University of Wisconsin Press, 2006; pp. 229–50.&lt;/ref&gt; but also there existed [[Ezra Heywood]] and Angela Heywood's ''[[The Word (free love)|The Word]]'' (1872–1890, 1892–1893).&lt;ref name="freelove"/&gt; [[M. E. Lazarus]] was also an important American individualist anarchist who promoted free love.&lt;ref name="freelove"/&gt; [[John William Lloyd]], a collaborator of [[Benjamin Tucker]]'s periodical ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]'', published in 1931 a sex manual that he called ''The Karezza Method: Or Magnetation, the Art of Connubial Love''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuniting.info/karezza_method_lloyd "The Karezza Method"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, the main propagandist of free love within individualist anarchism was [[Émile Armand]].&lt;ref name="armandfreelove"&gt;[http://www.iisg.nl/womhist/manfreuk.pdf E. Armand and "la camaraderie amoureuse". Revolutionary sexualism and the struggle against jealousy]&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed the concept of ''la camaraderie amoureuse'' to speak of free love as the possibility of voluntary sexual encounter between consenting adults. He was also a consistent proponent of [[polyamory]].&lt;ref name="armandfreelove"/&gt; In France, there was also feminist activity inside individualist anarchism as promoted by [[Individualist feminism|individualist feminists]] Marie Küge, [[Anna Mahé]], [[Rirette Maitrejean]] and Sophia Zaïkovska.&lt;ref&gt;[http://endehors.org/news/individualisme-anarchiste-et-feminisme-a-la-belle-epoque "Individualisme anarchiste et féminisme à la « Belle Epoque »"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120706170427/http://endehors.org/news/individualisme-anarchiste-et-feminisme-a-la-belle-epoque |date=July 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Brazil]]ian individualist anarchist [[Maria Lacerda de Moura]] lectured on topics such as education, [[women's rights]], [[free love]] and [[antimilitarism]]. Her writings and essays garnered her attention not only in Brazil, but also in [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]].&lt;ref name="nodo50.org"&gt;http://www.nodo50.org/insurgentes/textos/mulher/09marialacerda.htm "Maria Lacerda de Moura – Uma Anarquista Individualista Brasileira" by&lt;/ref&gt; She also wrote for the Spanish individualist anarchist magazine ''Al Margen'' alongside [[Miguel Gimenez Igualada]].&lt;ref&gt;"Entre los redactores y colaboradores de Al Margen, que trasladará su redacción a Elda, en Alicante, encontraremos a Miguel Giménez Igualada, al escritor Gonzalo Vidal, u otros habituales de la prensa individualista como Costa Iscar, Mariano Gallardo o la periodista brasileña Maria Lacerda de Moura."&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, the [[Philosophy of Max Stirner|Stirnerists]] [[Adolf Brand]] and [[John Henry Mackay]] were pioneering campaigners for the acceptance of male [[bisexuality]] and [[homosexuality]].

=== Freethought ===
{{main|Freethought}}
Freethought as a philosophical position and as activism was important in both North American and European individualist anarchism, but in the United States freethought was basically an [[Anti-Christianity|anti-Christian]], [[Anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] movement whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters. A number of contributors to ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]'' were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism. The individualist anarchist George MacDonald was a co-editor of ''Freethought'' and for a time ''The Truth Seeker''. E.C. Walker was co-editor of ''[[Lucifer, the Light-Bearer]]''.&lt;ref name="mises.org"&gt;[[Wendy McElroy]] [https://mises.org/library/culture-individualist-anarchism-late-19th-century-america "The culture of individualist anarchist in Late-nineteenth century America"]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers; reprints from freethought papers such as ''[[Lucifer, the Light-Bearer]]'', ''Freethought'' and ''The Truth Seeker'' appeared in ''Liberty''. The church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself.&lt;ref name="mises.org"/&gt;

In Europe, a similar development occurred in French and Spanish individualist anarchist circles: "Anticlericalism, just as in the rest of the libertarian movement, is another of the frequent elements which will gain relevance related to the measure in which the (French) Republic begins to have conflicts with the church [...] Anti-clerical discourse, frequently called for by the french individualist [[André Lorulot]], will have its impacts in ''Estudios'' (a Spanish individualist anarchist publication). There will be an attack on institutionalized religion for the responsibility that it had in the past on negative developments, for its irrationality which makes it a counterpoint of philosophical and scientific progress. There will be a criticism of proselitism and ideological manipulation which happens on both believers and agnostics".{{sfn|Díez|2007|p=143}} This tendencies will continue in French individualist anarchism in the work and activism of [[Charles-Auguste Bontemps]] and others. In the Spanish individualist anarchist magazine ''Ética'' and ''[[Iniciales]]'', "there is a strong interest in publishing scientific news, usually linked to a certain [[atheist]] and [[anti-theist]] obsession, philosophy which will also work for pointing out the incompatibility between science and religion, faith and reason. In this way there will be a lot of talk on Darwin's theories or on the negation of the existence of the soul".{{sfn|Díez|2007|p=152}}

=== Anarcho-naturism ===

De esta experiencia, su filosofía trata de transmitirnos la idea de que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armonía de los individuos con el entorno natural."[http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf "La insumisión voluntaria: El anarquismo individualista español durante la Dictadura y la Segunda República (1923–1938)" by Xavier Díez] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723130358/http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf |date=July 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Important promoters of this were [[Henri Zisly]] and [[Émile Gravelle]] who collaborated in ''La Nouvelle Humanité'' followed by ''Le Naturien'', ''Le Sauvage'', ''L'Ordre Naturel'' and ''La Vie Naturelle''.&lt;ref name="naturismo2"&gt;"1855 – France: Emile Gravelle lives, Douai.

This relationship between anarchism and naturism was quite important at the end of the 1920s in Spain,&lt;ref name="naturismo.org"&gt;[http://www.naturismo.org/adn/ediciones/2003/invierno/7e.html "Anarchism – Nudism, Naturism" by Carlos Ortega at Asociacion para el Desarrollo Naturista de la Comunidad de Madrid. Published on Revista ''ADN''. Winter 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; when "[t]he linking role played by the 'Sol y Vida' group was very important. The goal of this group was to take trips and enjoy the open air. The Naturist athenaeum, 'Ecléctico', in Barcelona, was the base from which the activities of the group were launched. First ''Etica'' and then ''[[Iniciales]]'', which began in 1929, were the publications of the group, which lasted until the [[Spanish Civil War]]. We must be aware that the naturist ideas expressed in them matched the desires that the libertarian youth had of breaking up with the conventions of the bourgeoisie of the time. That is what a young worker explained in a letter to 'Iniciales' He writes it under the odd pseudonym of 'silvestre del campo', (wild man in the country). "I find great pleasure in being naked in the woods, bathed in light and air, two natural elements we cannot do without. By shunning the humble garment of an exploited person, (garments which, in my opinion, are the result of all the laws devised to make our lives bitter), we feel there no others left but just the natural laws. Clothes mean slavery for some and tyranny for others. Only the naked man who rebels against all norms, stands for anarchism, devoid of the prejudices of outfit imposed by our money-oriented society".&lt;ref name="naturismo.org"/&gt; The relation between anarchism and naturism "gives way to the Naturist Federation, in July 1928, and to the lV Spanish Naturist Congress, in September 1929, both supported by the Libertarian Movement. However, in the short term, the Naturist and Libertarian movements grew apart in their conceptions of everyday life. The Naturist movement felt closer to the Libertarian individualism of some French theoreticians such as Henri Ner (real name of [[Han Ryner]]) than to the revolutionary goals proposed by some Anarchist organisations such as the FAI, ([[Federación Anarquista Ibérica]])".&lt;ref name="naturismo.org"/&gt;

=== Individualist anarchism and Friedrich Nietzsche ===
{{see also|Anarchism and Friedrich Nietzsche#Individualist anarchism}}
The thought of German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] has been influential in individualist anarchism, specifically in thinkers such as France's [[Émile Armand]],&lt;ref&gt;"The life of Émile Armand (1872–1963) spanned the history of anarchism. He was influenced by Leo Tolstoy and Benjamin Tucker, and to a lesser extent by Whitman and Emerson. Later in life, Nietzsche and Stirner became important to his way of thinking."[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Emile_Armand__The_Anarchism_of_Emile_Armand.html Introduction to ''The Anarchism of Émile Armand'' by [[Émile Armand]]&lt;/ref&gt; the Italian [[Renzo Novatore]]&lt;ref name="novatore-toward"&gt;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Renzo_Novatore__Toward_the_Creative_Nothing.html ''Toward the Creative Nothing''] by [[Renzo Novatore]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Colombian [[Biofilo Panclasta]].

==== American mutualism and individualist utopianism ====
[[File:Stephen Pearl Andrews.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Stephen Pearl Andrews]]]]
For American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster, "[i]t is apparent [...] that [[Proudhon]]ian Anarchism was to be found in the United States at least as early as 1848 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the Individualist Anarchism of [[Josiah Warren]] and [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]] [...] [[William B. Greene]] presented this Proudhonian Mutualism in its purest and most systematic form".&lt;ref name="againstallauthority.org"&gt;[http://www.againstallauthority.org/NativeAmericanAnarchism.html ''Native American Anarchism: A Study of Left-Wing American Individualism'' by Eunice Minette Schuster] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160213201445/http://www.againstallauthority.org/NativeAmericanAnarchism.html|date=February 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Batchelder Greene]] (1819–1878) is best known for the works ''Mutual Banking''(1850), which proposed an interest-free banking system; and ''Transcendentalism'', a critique of the [[Transcendentalism|New England philosophical school]]. He saw mutualism as the synthesis of "liberty and order".&lt;ref name="againstallauthority.org"/&gt; His "associationism [...] is checked by individualism [...] "Mind your own business," "Judge not that ye be not judged." Over matters which are purely personal, as for example, moral conduct, the individual is sovereign, as well as over that which he himself produces. For this reason he demands "mutuality" in marriage – the equal right of a woman to her own personal freedom and property&lt;ref name="againstallauthority.org"/&gt; and feminist and spiritualist tendencies".&lt;ref name="theanarchistlibrary.org"&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Hakim_Bey__The_Lemonade_Ocean___Modern_Times.html Hakim Bey]&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary American anarchist [[Hakim Bey]] reports that "[[Stephen Pearl Andrews|Steven Pearl Andrews]] [...] was not a fourierist (see [[Charles Fourier]]), but he lived through the brief craze for [[Phalanstère|phalansteries]] in America &amp; adopted a lot of fourierist principles &amp; practices [...] a maker of worlds out of words. He syncretized [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionism]], [[Free love|Free Love]], spiritual universalism, [[Josiah Warren|(Josiah) Warren]], &amp; [[Charles Fourier|(Charles) Fourier]] into a grand utopian scheme he called the Universal Pantarchy [...] He was instrumental in founding several "intentional communities," including the "Brownstone Utopia" on 14th St. in New York, &amp; "[[Modern Times (intentional community)|Modern Times]]" in Brentwood, Long Island. The latter became as famous as the best-known [[Fourierism|fourierist]] communes (Brook Farm in Massachusetts &amp; the North American Phalanx in New Jersey) – in fact, Modern Times became downright notorious (for "[[Free love|Free Love]]") &amp; finally foundered under a wave of scandalous publicity. Andrews (&amp; [[Victoria Woodhull]]) were members of the infamous Section 12 of the [[1st International]], expelled by [[Marx]] for its anarchist, feminist, &amp; spiritualist tendencies".&lt;ref name="theanarchistlibrary.org"/&gt;

==== Boston anarchists ====
[[File:LysanderSpooner.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Lysander Spooner]]]]
Another form of individualist anarchism was found in the United States as advocated by the so-called Boston anarchists.&lt;ref name=levy/&gt; By default, American individualists had no difficulty accepting the concepts that "one man employ another" or that "he direct him", in his labor but rather demanded that "all natural opportunities requisite to the production of wealth be accessible to all on equal terms and that monopolies arising from special privileges created by law be abolished".&lt;ref&gt;Madison, Charles A. "Anarchism in the United States." ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', Vol 6, No 1, January 1945, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

They believed [[state monopoly capitalism]] (defined as a state-sponsored monopoly)&lt;ref name=schwartzman&gt;Schwartzman, Jack. "Ingalls, Hanson, and Tucker: Nineteenth-Century American Anarchists." ''American Journal of Economics and Sociology'', Vol. 62, No. 5 (November 2003). p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt; prevented labor from being fully rewarded. [[Voltairine de Cleyre]] summed up the philosophy by saying that the anarchist individualists "are firm in the idea that the system of employer and employed, buying and selling, banking, and all the other essential institutions of Commercialism, centred upon private property, are in themselves good, and are rendered vicious merely by the interference of the State".&lt;ref&gt;de Cleyre, Voltairine. Anarchism. Originally published in ''Free Society'', 13 October 1901. Published in Exquisite Rebel: The Essays of Voltairine de Cleyre, edited by [[Sharon Presley]], SUNY Press 2005, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even among the 19th-century American individualists, there was not a monolithic doctrine as they disagreed amongst each other on various issues including [[intellectual property]] rights and [[Possession (law)|possession]] versus [[property]] in land.&lt;ref&gt;Spooner, Lysander.

Volume VII, No 3. {{ISSN|0047-4517}}. pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; A major schism occurred later in the 19th century when Tucker and some others abandoned their traditional support of [[natural right]]s as espoused by [[Lysander Spooner]] and converted to an "egoism" modeled upon [[Philosophy of Max Stirner|Max Stirner's philosophy]].&lt;ref name=watner/&gt; [[Lysander Spooner]] besides his individualist anarchist activism was also an important anti-slavery activist and became a member of the [[First International]].&lt;ref&gt;[[George Woodcock]]. Anarchism: a history of anarchist ideas and movements (1962). p. 459.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Boston anarchists, including Benjamin Tucker, identified themselves as [[socialist]]s, which in the 19th century was often used in the sense of a commitment to improving conditions of the working class (i.e. "[[the labor problem]]").&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Frank H. 1994. ''The Individualist Anarchists: An Anthology of Liberty'' (1881–1908). Transaction Publishers. p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; The Boston anarchists such as Tucker and his followers continue to be considered socialists due to their opposition to usury.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionG1#secg14 "G.1.4 Why is the social context important in evaluating Individualist Anarchism?" in ''An Anarchist FAQ'']{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315000327/http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionG1#secg14 |date=March 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They do so because as the modern economist Jim Stanford points out there are many different kinds of competitive markets such as market socialism and capitalism is only one type of a market economy.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford, Jim. Economics for Everyone: A Short Guide to the Economics of Capitalism. Ann Arbor: MI., Pluto Press. 2008. p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two individualist anarchists who wrote in [[Benjamin Tucker]]'s ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]'' were also important labor organizers of the time. [[Joseph Labadie]] (April 18, 1850 – October 7, 1933) was an American labor organizer, individualist anarchist, social activist, printer, publisher, essayist and poet. In 1883, Labadie embraced a non-violent version of individualist anarchism. Without the oppression of the state, Labadie believed, humans would choose to harmonize with "the great natural laws [...] without robbing [their] fellows through interest, profit, rent and taxes". However, he supported community cooperation as he supported community control of water utilities, streets and railroads.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, James J. (1970). ''Men Against the State: The Expositors of Individualist Anarchism in America, 1827–1908.''

==== American egoism ====
[[File:BenjaminTucker.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Benjamin Tucker]]]]
Some of the American individualist anarchists later in this era, such as Benjamin Tucker, abandoned natural rights positions and converted to [[Max Stirner]]'s [[egoist anarchism]]. Rejecting the idea of moral rights, Tucker said that there were only two rights, "the right of might" and "the right of contract". He also said after converting to Egoist individualism that "[i]n times past [...] it was my habit to talk glibly of the right of man to land. It was a bad habit, and I long ago sloughed it off [...] Man's only right to land is his might over it".&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Instead of a Book, p. 350&lt;/ref&gt; In adopting Stirnerite egoism in 1886, Tucker rejected natural rights which had long been considered the foundation of libertarianism. This rejection galvanized the movement into fierce debates, with the natural rights proponents accusing the egoists of destroying libertarianism itself. So bitter was the conflict that a number of natural rights proponents withdrew from the pages of ''Liberty'' in protest even though they had hitherto been among its frequent contributors. Thereafter, ''Liberty'' championed egoism although its general content did not change significantly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1300&amp;layout=html#chapter_100896 Wendy Mcelroy. "Benjamin Tucker, Individualism, &amp; Liberty: Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several periodicals were undoubtedly influenced by ''Liberty'''s presentation of egoism. They included ''I'' published by [[Clarence Lee Swartz]], edited by [[William Walstein Gordak]] and [[J. William Lloyd]] (all associates of ''Liberty''); and ''The Ego'' and ''The Egoist'', both of which were edited by Edward H. Fulton. Among the egoist papers that Tucker followed were the German ''Der Eigene'', edited by [[Adolf Brand]]; and ''The Eagle'' and ''The Serpent'', issued from London. The latter, the most prominent English-language egoist journal, was published from 1898 to 1900 with the subtitle "A Journal of Egoistic Philosophy and Sociology".&lt;ref name="mcelroy-jury"&gt;McElroy, Wendy.

American anarchists who adhered to egoism include [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[John Beverley Robinson (anarchist)|John Beverley Robinson]], [[Steven T. Byington]], [[Hutchins Hapgood]], [[James L. Walker]], [[Victor Yarros]] and Edward H. Fulton.&lt;ref name="mcelroy"/&gt; Robinson wrote an essay called "Egoism" in which he states that "[m]odern egoism, as propounded by Stirner and [[Nietzsche]], and expounded by [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]], [[George Bernard Shaw|Shaw]] and others, is all these; but it is more. It is the realization by the individual that they are an individual; that, as far as they are concerned, they are the only individual".&lt;ref name="robinson"&gt;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/John_Beverley_Robinson__Egoism.html "Egoism"] by [[John Beverley Robinson (anarchist)|John Beverley Robinson]]&lt;/ref&gt; Walker published the work ''The Philosophy of Egoism'' in which he argued that egosim "implies a rethinking of the self-other relationship, nothing less than "a complete revolution in the relations of mankind" that avoids both the "archist" principle that legitimates domination and the "moralist" notion that elevates self-renunciation to a virtue. Walker describes himself as an "egoistic anarchist" who believed in both contract and cooperation as practical principles to guide everyday interactions".&lt;ref&gt;John F. Welsh. ''Max Stirner's Dialectical Egoism: A New Interpretation.'' Lexington Books. 2010. p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; For Walker, "what really defines egoism is not mere self-interest, pleasure, or greed; it is the sovereignty of the individual, the full expression of the subjectivity of the individual ego".&lt;ref&gt;John F. Welsh. ''Max Stirner's Dialectical Egoism: A New Interpretation.'' Lexington Books. 2010. p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Individualist anarchism#Italy|Italian anti-organizationalist individualist anarchism]] was brought to the United States&lt;ref&gt;"it was in times of severe social repression and deadening social quiescence that individualist anarchists came to the foreground of libertarian activity – and then primarily as terrorists. In France, Spain, and the United States, individualistic anarchists committed acts of terrorism that gave anarchism its reputation as a violently sinister conspiracy."

''[[Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism: An Unbridgeable Chasm]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; by Italian born individualists such as [[Giuseppe Ciancabilla]] and others who advocated for violent [[propaganda by the deed]] there. Anarchist historian [[George Woodcock]] reports the incident in which the important Italian [[social anarchist]] [[Errico Malatesta]] became involved "in a dispute with the individualist anarchists of [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]], who insisted that anarchism implied no organization at all, and that every man must act solely on his impulses. At last, in one noisy debate, the individual impulse of a certain Ciancabilla directed him to shoot Malatesta, who was badly wounded but obstinately refused to name his assailant".&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock, George.

==== Anarcho-capitalism ====
{{main|Anarcho-capitalism}}
19th century individualist anarchists espoused the [[labor theory of value]]. Many{{weasel inline|date=August 2018}} believe that the modern movement of anarcho-capitalism is the result of simply removing the labor theory of value from ideas of the 19th-century American individualist anarchists: "Their successors today, such as Murray Rothbard, having abandoned the labor theory of value, describe themselves as [[anarcho-capitalists]]".&lt;ref name="outhwaite"&gt;Outhwaite, William. The Blackwell Dictionary of Modern Social Thought, Anarchism entry, [[Blackwell Publishing]], 2003, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; As economic theory changed, the popularity of the labor theory of [[classical economics]] was superseded by the [[subjective theory of value]] of [[neo-classical economics]]. [[Murray Rothbard]], a student of [[Ludwig von Mises]], combined Mises' [[Austrian School]] of economics with the absolutist views of human rights and rejection of the state he had absorbed from studying the individualist American anarchists of the 19th century such as Lysander Spooner and Benjamin Tucker.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought, 1987, {{ISBN|0-631-17944-5}}, p. 290&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1950s, Rothbard wrote an article under a pseudonym, saying that "we are not anarchists [...] but not archists either [...] Perhaps, then, we could call ourselves by a new name: nonarchist", concerned with differentiating himself from communist and socialistic economic views of other anarchists (including the individualist anarchists of the 19th century).&lt;ref name="Are Libertarians 'Anarchists'"&gt;Rothbard, Murray. [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard167.html Are Libertarians 'Anarchists'?]. ''LewRockwell.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a strong current within anarchism which does not consider that anarcho-capitalism can be considered a part of the anarchist movement due to the fact that anarchism has historically been an [[anti-capitalist]] movement and for definitional reasons which see anarchism incompatible with capitalist forms.&lt;ref&gt;"The philosophy of "anarcho-capitalism" dreamed up by the "libertarian" [[New Right]], has nothing to do with Anarchism as known by the Anarchist movement proper."[[Albert Meltzer|Meltzer, Albert]]. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=CJhCvx_Z0CAC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage Anarchism: Arguments For and Against]'' [[AK Press]], (2000) p.&amp;nbsp;50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"In fact, few anarchists would accept the 'anarcho-capitalists' into the anarchist camp since they do not share a concern for economic equality and social justice, Their self-interested, calculating market men would be incapable of practising voluntary co-operation and mutual aid. Anarcho-capitalists, even if they do reject the State, might therefore best be called [[Right-libertarianism|right-wing libertarians]] rather than anarchists." Peter Marshall. [[Demanding the Impossible: A History of Anarchism]]. Harper Perennial. London. 2008. p. 565&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"It is important to distinguish between anarchism and certain strands of [[Right-libertarianism|right-wing libertarianism]] which at times go by the same name (for example, Murray Rothbard's anarcho-capitalism)."[[Saul Newman]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=SiqBiViUsOkC&amp;pg=PA43#v=onepage&amp;q=anarcho-capitalism%20right%20libertarian The Politics of Postanarchism, Edinburgh University Press,]'' 2010, p. 43 {{ISBN|0748634959}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/secFcon.html Section F – Is "anarcho"-capitalism a type of anarchism?] at [[An Anarchist FAQ]] published in physical book form by An Anarchist FAQ as "Volume I"; by [[AK Press]], Oakland/Edinburgh 2008; 558 pages, {{ISBN|9781902593906}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"'Libertarian' and 'libertarianism' are frequently employed by anarchists as synonyms for 'anarchist' and 'anarchism', largely as an attempt to distance themselves from the negative connotations of 'anarchy' and its derivatives. The situation has been vastly complicated in recent decades with the rise of anarcho-capitalism, 'minimal statism' and an extreme right-wing laissez-faire philosophy advocated by such theorists as Murray Rothbard and Robert Nozick and their adoption of the words 'libertarian' and 'libertarianism'. It has therefore now become necessary to distinguish between their [[right libertarianism]] and the [[left libertarianism]] of the anarchist tradition." ''[[Anarchist Seeds Beneath the Snow: Left-Libertarian Thought and British Writers from William Morris to Colin Ward]]'' by David Goodway. Liverpool University Press. Liverpool. 2006. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Within Libertarianism, Rothbard represents a minority perspective that actually argues for the total elimination of the state. However Rothbard's claim as an anarchist is quickly voided when it is shown that he only wants an end to the public state. In its place he allows countless private states, with each person supplying their own police force, army, and law, or else purchasing these services from capitalist venders...so what remains is shrill anti-statism conjoined to a vacuous freedom in hackneyed defense of capitalism. In sum, the "anarchy" of Libertarianism reduces to a liberal fraud.[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/peter-sabatini-libertarianism-bogus-anarchy "Libertarianism: Bogus Anarchy" by Peter Sabatini] in issue #41 (Fall/Winter 1994–95) of ''[[Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Agorism =====
{{main|Agorism}}
Agorism was developed from anarcho-capitalism in the late 20th century by [[Samuel Edward Konkin III]]. The goal of agorists is a society in which all "[[Voluntaryism|relations between people are voluntary exchanges]] – a [[free market]]".&lt;ref name="newlibman"&gt;{{cite book |last=Konkin III |first=Samuel Edward |authorlink=Samuel Edward Konkin III |title=New Libertarian Manifesto |publisher=KoPubCo |url = http://invisiblemolotov.files.wordpress.com/2008/06/new_libertarian_manifesto.pdf |format=PDF|year=2006 |isbn=0977764923 |origyear=1980 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Agorists are [[market anarchism|market anarchists]]. Most agorists consider that property rights are [[natural right]]s deriving from the primary right of self-ownership. Because of this, they are not opposed in principle to collectively held property if individual owners of the property consent to collective ownership by contract or other voluntary mutual agreement. However, agorists are divided on the question of [[intellectual property]] rights.{{Ref label|E|δ|none}}

==== Post-left anarchy and insurrectionary anarchism ====
{{main|Lifestyle anarchism|Post-left anarchy|Insurrectionary anarchism}}
[[Murray Bookchin]] has identified [[post-left anarchy]] as a form of individualist anarchism in ''[[Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism: An Unbridgeable Chasm]]'' where he identifies "a shift among Euro-American anarchists away from social anarchism and toward individualist or lifestyle anarchism. Indeed, lifestyle anarchism today is finding its principal expression in spray-can graffiti, post-modernist [[nihilism]], antirationalism, neo-[[Anarcho-primitivism|primitivism]], anti-technologism, neo-[[Situationist International|Situationist]] 'cultural terrorism', mysticism, and a 'practice' of staging [[Michel Foucault|Foucauldian]] 'personal insurrections'".&lt;ref&gt;''Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism: An Unbridgeable Chasm'' by [[Murray Bookchin]]&lt;/ref&gt; Post-left anarchist [[Bob Black]] in his long critique of Bookchin's philosophy called ''Anarchy After Leftism'' said about post-left anarchy that "[i]t is, unlike Bookchinism, "individualistic" in the sense that if the freedom and happiness of the individual – i.e., each and every really existing person, every Tom, Dick and Murray – is not the measure of the good society, what is?".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Bob_Black__Anarchy_after_Leftism.html#toc13 ''Anarchy after Leftism''] by [[Bob Black]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A strong relationship does exist between post-left anarchism and the work of individualist anarchist [[Max Stirner]]. [[Jason McQuinn]] says that "when I (and other anti-ideological anarchists) criticize ideology, it is always from a specifically critical, anarchist perspective rooted in both the skeptical, individualist-anarchist philosophy of Max Stirner.&lt;ref name="Cuchuflito"&gt;"What is Ideology?" by [[Jason McQuinn]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bob Black]] and Feral Faun/Wolfi Landstreicher also strongly adhere to stirnerist [[egoist anarchism]]. Bob Black has humorously suggested the idea of "marxist stirnerism".&lt;ref name="groucho marx"&gt;[http://sniggle.net/Manifesti/groucho.php "Theses on Groucho Marxism" by [[Bob Black]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hakim Bey]] has said: "From Stirner's "[[Union of egoists|Union of Self-Owning Ones]]" we proceed to [[Nietzsche]]'s circle of "Free Spirits" and thence to [[Charles Fourier]]'s "Passional Series", doubling and redoubling ourselves even as the Other multiplies itself in the eros of the group".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.left-bank.org/bey/default3.htm ''Immediatism'' by Hakim Bey. AK Press. 1994. p. 4] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091205152300/http://www.left-bank.org/bey/default3.htm |date=December 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bey also wrote: "The Mackay Society, of which Mark &amp; I are active members, is devoted to the anarchism of Max Stirner, [[Benjamin Tucker|Benj. Tucker]] &amp; [[John Henry Mackay]] [...] The Mackay Society, incidentally, represents a little-known current of individualist thought which never cut its ties with revolutionary labor. [[Dyer Lum]], [[Ezra Heywood|Ezra]] &amp; Angela Haywood represent this school of thought; [[Jo Labadie]], who wrote for Tucker's ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]'', made himself a link between the American "plumb-line" anarchists, the "philosophical" individualists, &amp; the syndicalist or communist branch of the movement; his influence reached the Mackay Society through his son, Laurance. Like the Italian Stirnerites (who influenced us through our late friend [[Enrico Arrigoni]]) we support all anti-authoritarian currents, despite their apparent contradictions".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Hakim_Bey__An_esoteric_interpretation_of_the_I.W.W._preamble.html Hakim Bey. "An esoteric interpretation of the I.W.W. preamble"]&lt;/ref&gt;

As far as posterior individualist anarchists, [[Jason McQuinn]] for some time used the pseudonym [[Lev Chernyi]] in honor of the Russian individualist anarchist of the same name while Feral Faun has quoted Italian individualist anarchist [[Renzo Novatore]]&lt;ref name="wolfinovatore2"&gt;[http://www.anti-politics.net/feral-faun/whither-now.html Anti-politics.net], "Whither now? Some thoughts on creating anarchy" by Feral Faun&lt;/ref&gt; and has translated both Novatore&lt;ref name="wolfinovatore"&gt;[http://www.omnipresence.mahost.org/creativenothing.htm Towards the creative nothing and other writings by Renzo Novatore] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820035443/http://www.omnipresence.mahost.org/creativenothing.htm |date=August 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the young Italian individualist anarchist [[Bruno Filippi]]&lt;ref name="rebel's dark"/&gt;

Egoism has had a strong influence on [[insurrectionary anarchism]], as can be seen in the work of Wolfi Landstreicher. Feral Faun wrote in 1995: &lt;blockquote&gt;In the game of insurgence – a lived guerilla war game – it is strategically necessary to use identities and roles. Unfortunately, the context of social relationships gives these roles and identities the power to define the individual who attempts to use them. So I, Feral Faun, became [...] an anarchist [...] a writer [...] a Stirner-influenced, post-[[Situationist International|situationist]], anti-civilization theorist [...] if not in my own eyes, at least in the eyes of most people who've read my writings.&lt;ref name="feral faun"&gt;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Feral_Faun__Essays.html#toc10 "The Last Word" by Feral Faun]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== European individualist anarchism ===
{{main|Individualist anarchism in Europe}}
[[File:Emilearmand01.jpg|thumb|left|140px|[[Émile Armand]]]]
European individualist anarchism proceeded from the roots laid by [[William Godwin]],&lt;ref name=woodcock20/&gt; [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] and [[Max Stirner]]. Proudhon was an early pioneer of [[anarchism]] as well as of the important individualist anarchist current of [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia Americana"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamilton 1995 79"/&gt; Stirner became a central figure of individualist anarchism through the publication of his seminal work ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'' which is considered to be "a founding text in the tradition of individualist anarchism".&lt;ref name=stirnersep/&gt; Another early figure was [[Anselme Bellegarrigue]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://praxeology.net/MN-AB.htm Biography of Anselme Bellegarrigue by Max Nettlau.]&lt;/ref&gt; Individualist anarchism expanded and diversified through Europe, incorporating influences from [[Individualist anarchism in the United States|North American individualist anarchism]].

European individualist anarchists include [[Albert Libertad]], Bellegarrigue, [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Émile Armand]], [[Lev Chernyi]], [[John Henry Mackay]], [[Han Ryner]], [[Adolf Brand]], [[Miguel Gimenez Igualada]], [[Renzo Novatore]] and currently [[Michel Onfray]].&lt;ref name="regards.fr"&gt;Onfray says in an interview "L'individualisme anarchiste part de cette logique. Il célèbre les individualités&amp;nbsp;... Dans cette période de libéralisme comme horizon indépassable, je persiste donc à plaider pour l'individu."[http://www.regards.fr/culture/interview-des-lecteurs-michel Interview des lecteurs : Michel Onfray Par Marion Rousset| 1er avril 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404134143/http://www.regards.fr/culture/interview-des-lecteurs-michel |date=2012-04-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Important currents within it include [[free love]],&lt;ref name="spain"&gt;
[http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf "Voluntary non-submission. Spanish individualist anarchism during dictatorship and the second republic (1923–1938)" by Xavier Diez] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723130358/http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf |date=July 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[anarcho-naturism]]&lt;ref name="spain"/&gt; and [[illegalism]].&lt;ref name="inanrcillegal"&gt;
"Parallel to the social, [[collectivist]] anarchist current there was an individualist one whose partisans emphasized their individual freedom and advised other individuals to do the same. Individualist anarchist activity spanned the full spectrum of alternatives to [[authoritarian]] society, subverting it by undermining its way of life facet by facet." Thus [[theft]], [[counterfeiting]], swindling and [[robbery]] became a way of life for hundreds of individualists, as it was already for countless thousands of [[proletarian]]s. The wave of anarchist bombings and assassinations of the 1890s ([[Auguste Vaillant]], Ravachol, [[Émile Henry (anarchist)|Émile Henry]], [[Sante Caserio]]) and the practice of illegalism from the mid-1880s to the start of the First World War ([[Clément Duval]], Pini, [[Marius Jacob]], the Bonnot gang) were twin aspects of the same proletarian offensive, but were expressed in an individualist practice, one that complemented the great collective struggles against capital."&lt;/ref&gt;

==== France ====
{{main|Individualist anarchism in France}}
[[File:Han Ryner.JPG|thumb|150px|[[Han Ryner]]]]
From the legacy of Proudhon and Stirner there emerged a strong tradition of [[Individualist anarchism in France|French individualist anarchism]]. An early important individualist anarchist was [[Anselme Bellegarrigue]]. He participated in the [[French Revolution of 1848]], was author and editor of ''Anarchie, Journal de l'Ordre and Au fait ! Au fait ! Interprétation de l'idée démocratique'' and wrote the important early [[Anarchist Manifesto]] in 1850. Catalan historian of individualist anarchism Xavier Diez reports that during his travels in the United States "he at least contacted [[Henry David Thoreau|(Henry David) Thoreau]] and, probably [[Josiah Warren|(Josiah) Warren]]".{{sfn|Díez|2007|p=60}} ''Autonomie Individuelle'' was an individualist anarchist publication that ran from 1887 to 1888. It was edited by Jean-Baptiste Louiche, Charles Schæffer and Georges Deherme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la-presse-anarchiste.net/spip.php?rubrique258 Autonomie Individuelle (1887–1888)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, this tradition continued with such intellectuals as [[Albert Libertad]], [[André Lorulot]], [[Émile Armand]], [[Victor Serge]], [[Zo d'Axa]] and [[Rirette Maitrejean]], who in 1905 developed theory in the main individualist anarchist journal in France, ''[[L'Anarchie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"On the fringe of the movement, and particularly in the individualist faction which became relatively strong after 1900 and began to publish its own sectarian paper, – 315 – L'Anarchie ( 1905–14), there were groups and individuals who lived largely by crime. Among them were some of the most original as well as some of the most tragic figures in anarchist history." Woodcock, George. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements. 1962''&lt;/ref&gt; Outside this journal, [[Han Ryner]] wrote ''Petit Manuel individualiste'' (1903). In 1891, Zo d'Axa created the journal [[L'En-Dehors]].

[[File:Zo d'Axa portrait.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Zo d'Axa]]]]

Anarcho-naturism was promoted by [[Henri Zisly]], [[Emile Gravelle]] &lt;ref name="naturismo2"/&gt; and Georges Butaud. Butaud was an individualist "partisan of the ''[[Intentional community|milieux libres]]'', publisher of "Flambeau" ("an enemy of authority") in 1901 in Vienna" and most of his energies were devoted to creating anarchist colonies (communautés expérimentales) in which he participated in several.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eskimo.com/~recall/bleed/0226.htm "1926 – France: Georges Butaud (1868–1926) dies, in Ermont."]&lt;/ref&gt;

In this sense, "the theoretical positions and the vital experiences of [F]rench individualism are deeply iconoclastic and scandalous, even within libertarian circles. The call of nudist [[naturism]], the strong defence of bith control methods, the idea of "[[Union of egoists|unions of egoists]]" with the sole justification of sexual practices, that will try to put in practice, not without difficulties, will establish a way of thought and action, and will result in sympathy within some, and a strong rejection within others".&lt;ref name="frenchexperimentation"&gt;[http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf "La insumisión voluntaria.

==== Illegalism ====
{{main|Illegalism}}
[[File:Band a bonnot desenho.jpg|thumb|180px|Caricature of the [[Bonnot gang]]]]
Illegalism&lt;ref name="The Illegalists"/&gt; is an anarchist philosophy that developed primarily in France, Italy, Belgium and Switzerland during the early 1900s as an outgrowth of Stirner's individualist anarchism.&lt;ref name="inanrcillegal"/&gt; Illegalists usually did not seek moral basis for their actions, recognizing only the reality of "might" rather than "right"; and for the most part, illegal acts were done simply to satisfy personal desires, not for some greater ideal,&lt;ref name="Parry, Richard 1987. p. 15"/&gt; although some committed crimes as a form of [[propaganda of the deed]].&lt;ref name="The Illegalists"/&gt; The illegalists embraced [[direct action]] and [[propaganda of the deed]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://recollectionbooks.com/siml/library/illegalistsDougImrie.htm The Illegalists] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908072801/http://recollectionbooks.com/siml/library/illegalistsDougImrie.htm |date=September 8, 2015 }} – by Doug Imrie. Recollectionbooks.com (1954-08-28). Retrieved on 2013-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by theorist Max Stirner's [[Egoist anarchism|egoism]] as well as Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (his view that "[[Property is theft!]]"), [[Clément Duval]] and [[Marius Jacob]] proposed the theory of la ''reprise individuelle'' ([[individual reclamation]]) which justified robbery on the rich and personal direct action against exploiters and the system.&lt;ref name="Parry, Richard 1987. p. 15"/&gt;

Illegalism first rose to prominence among a generation of Europeans inspired by the unrest of the 1890s, during which [[Ravachol]], [[Émile Henry (anarchist)|Émile Henry]], [[Auguste Vaillant]] and [[Sante Geronimo Caserio]] committed daring crimes in the name of anarchism&lt;ref name="illegalanticap"&gt;"Pre-WWI France was the setting for the only documented anarchist revolutionary movement to embrace all illegal activity as revolutionary practice. Pick-pocketing, theft from the workplace, robbery, confidence scams, desertion from the armed forces, you name it, illegalist activity was praised as a justifiable and necessary aspect of class struggle."[http://www.defenestrator.org/roblosricos/writings/illegalism.htm "Illegalism" by Rob los Ricos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120083916/http://www.defenestrator.org/roblosricos/writings/illegalism.htm |date=2008-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in what is known as propaganda of the deed. France's [[Bonnot Gang]] was the most famous group to embrace illegalism.

==== Italy ====
[[File:Novatore.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Renzo Novatore]]]]
In Italy, individualist anarchism had a strong tendency towards illegalism and violent propaganda by the deed similar to French individualist anarchism, but perhaps more extreme&lt;ref name="italyindiv"&gt;[https://archive.is/20110929141610/http://ita.anarchopedia.org/anarco-individualismolink "anarco-individualismo" in italian anarchopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"At this point, encouraged by the disillusionment that followed the breakdown of the general strike, the terrorist individualists who had always – despite Malatesta's influence – survived as a small minority among Italian anarchists, intervened frightfully and tragically."

[[George Woodcock]]. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements.'' 1962&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect, we can consider notorious magnicides carried out or attempted by individualists [[Giovanni Passannante]], [[Sante Caserio]], [[Michele Angiolillo]], [[Luigi Luccheni]] and [[Gaetano Bresci]] who murdered King [[Umberto I]]. Caserio lived in France and coexisted within French illegalism and later assassinated French President [[Marie François Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]]. The theoretical seeds of current [[insurrectionary anarchism]] were already laid out at the end of 19th century Italy in a combination of individualist anarchism criticism of permanent groups and organization with a socialist class struggle worldview.&lt;ref name="indinss"&gt;"Essa trova soprattutto in America del Nord un notevole seguito per opera del Galleani che esprime una sintesi fra l'istanza puramente individualista di stampo anglosassone e americano (ben espressa negli scritti di Tucker) e quella profondamente socialista del movimento anarchico di lingua italiana. Questa commistione di elementi individualisti e comunisti – che caratterizza bene la corrente antiorganizzatrice – rappresenta lo sforzo di quanti avvertirono in modo estremamente sensibile l'invadente burocratismo che pervadeva il movimento operaio e socialista."[http://ita.anarchopedia.org/anarchismo_insurrezionale "anarchismo insurrezionale" in italian anarchopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; During the rise of fascism, this thought also motivated [[Gino Lucetti]], Michele Schirru and Angelo Sbardellotto in attempting the assassination of [[Benito Mussolini]].

During the early 20th century, the intellectual work of individualist anarchist [[Renzo Novatore]] came to importance and he was influenced by [[Max Stirner]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Georges Palante]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Henrik Ibsen]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] and [[Charles Baudelaire]]. He collaborated in numerous anarchist journals and participated in [[futurism]] [[avant-garde]] currents. In his thought, he adhered to Stirnerist disrespect for private property, only recognizing property of one's own spirit.&lt;ref name="novatore-anarchopedia"&gt;"Novatore non era contrario all'abolizione della proprietà privata, poiché riteneva che l'unica proprietà inviolabile fosse solo quella spirituale ed etica. Il suo pensiero è esplicitato in "Verso il nulla creatore":
:Bisogna che tutto ciò che si chiama "proprietà materiale", "proprietà privata", "proprietà esteriore" diventi per gli individui ciò che è il sole, la luce, il cielo, il mare, le stelle. E ciò avverrà!Avverrà perché noi – gli iconoclasti – la violenteremo! Solo la ricchezza etica espirituale è invulnerabile. È vera proprietà dell'individuo. Il resto no! Il resto è vulnerabile!

There was also Pietro Bruzzi who published the journal ''L'Individualista'' in the 1920s alongside Ugo Fedeli and Francesco Ghezzi, but who fell to fascist forces later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://recollectionbooks.com/bleed/gallery/galleryindex.htm#Indivi-dualista "L'Indivi-dualista"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819002818/http://recollectionbooks.com/bleed/gallery/galleryindex.htm#Indivi-dualista |date=August 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ita.anarchopedia.org"&gt;[http://ita.anarchopedia.org/Pietro_Bruzzi "Pietro Bruzzi" at italian anarchopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; Bruzzi also collaborated with the Italian American individualist anarchist publication ''Eresia'' of [[New York City]]&lt;ref name="ita.anarchopedia.org"/&gt; edited by [[Enrico Arrigoni]].

In 1945 in Italy during the Founding Congress of the [[Italian Anarchist Federation]], there was a group of individualist anarchists led by Cesare Zaccaria&lt;ref&gt;[http://ita.anarchopedia.org/Storia_del_movimento_libertario_in_Italia "Storia del movimento libertario in Italia" in anarchopedia in Italian]&lt;/ref&gt; who was an important anarchist of the time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.katesharpleylibrary.net/73n6nh Cesare Zaccaria (19 August 1897 – October 1961)
Pier Carlo Masini and Paul Sharkey&lt;/ref&gt; Later during the IX Congress of the [[Italian Anarchist Federation]] in [[Carrara]] in 1965, a group decided to split off from this organization and created the ''Gruppi di Iniziativa Anarchica''.

In the famous Italian [[insurrectionary anarchist]] essay written by an anonymous writer, "At Daggers Drawn with the Existent, its Defenders and its False Critics", there reads: "The workers who, during a wildcat strike, carried a banner saying, 'We are not asking for anything' understood that the defeat is in the claim itself ('the claim against the enemy is eternal').

==== Spain ====
While Spain was influenced by American individualist anarchism, it was more closely related to the French currents. Around the start of the 20th century, individualism in Spain gathered force through the efforts of people such as Dorado Montero, [[Ricardo Mella]], [[Federico Urales]], [[Miguel Gimenez Igualada]], Mariano Gallardo and J. Elizalde who translated French and American individualists.&lt;ref name="frenchexperimentation"/&gt; Important in this respect were also magazines such as ''La Idea Libre'', ''[[La revista blanca]]'', ''Etica'', ''[[Iniciales]]'', ''Al margen'', ''Estudios'' and ''Nosotros''. The most influential thinkers there were [[Max Stirner]], [[Émile Armand]] and [[Han Ryner]]. Just as in France, the spread of [[Esperanto]] and [[anationalism]] had importance just as [[naturism]] and [[free love]] currents.&lt;ref name="frenchexperimentation"/&gt; Later, Armand and Ryner themselves started writing in the Spanish individualist press. Armand's concept of amorous camaraderie had an important role in motivating [[polyamory]] as realization of the individual.&lt;ref name="frenchexperimentation"/&gt;

Catalan historian Xavier Diez reports that the Spanish individualist anarchist press was widely read by members of [[anarcho-communist]] groups and by members of the [[anarcho-syndicalist]] trade union [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]]. There were also the cases of prominent individualist anarchists such as [[Federico Urales]] and [[Miguel Gimenez Igualada]] who were members of the CNT and J. Elizalde who was a founding member and first secretary of the [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica|Iberian Anarchist Federation]] (IAF).&lt;ref&gt;Xavier Diez. ''El anarquismo individualista en España: 1923–1938.'' {{ISBN|978-84-96044-87-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spanish individualist anarchist [[Miguel Giménez Igualada]] wrote the lengthy theory book called ''Anarchism'' espousing his individualist anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slideshare.net/guest8dcd3f/anarquismo-miguel-gimenez-igualada ''Anarquismo'' por [[Miguel Gimenez Igualada]]&lt;/ref&gt; Between October 1937 and February 1938, he was editor of the individualist anarchist magazine ''Nosotros''&lt;ref name="spain"/&gt; in which many works of Armand and Ryner appeared. He also participated in the publishing of another individualist anarchist maganize ''Al Margen: Publicación quincenal individualista''.&lt;ref name="spain2"&gt;"Entre los redactores y colaboradores de Al Margen, que trasladará su redacción a Elda, en Alicante, encontraremos a Miguel Giménez Igualada&amp;nbsp;..."

He published and wrote the preface&lt;ref name="spain"/&gt; to the fourth edition in Spanish of ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'' from 1900. He proposed the creation of a "[[Union of egoists]]" to be a federation of individualist anarchists in Spain, but it did not succeed.&lt;ref name="spain3"&gt;"A partir de la década de los treinta, su pensamiento empieza a derivar hacia el individualismo, y como profundo estirneriano tratará de impulsar una federación de individualistas"[http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf "La insumisión voluntaira: El anarquismo individualista español durante la dictadura y la segunda reppública(1923–1938) por Xavier Diez] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723130358/http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf |date=July 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, he published an extensive treatise on Stirner, dedicated to fellow individualist anarchist Émile Armand.&lt;ref name="kclibertaria.comyr.com"&gt;[http://www.kclibertaria.comyr.com/lpdf/l147.pdf "Stirner" por Miguel Gimenez Igualada]&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, he traveled and lived in Argentina, Uruguay and Mexico.{{sfn|Díez|2007}}

[[Federico Urales]] was an important individualist anarchist who edited ''[[La Revista Blanca]]''. The individualist anarchism of Urales was influenced by [[Auguste Comte]] and [[Charles Darwin]]. He saw science and reason as a defense against blind servitude to authority. He was critical of influential individualist thinkers such as Nietzsche and Stirner for promoting an asocial egoist individualism and instead promoted an individualism with solidarity seen as a way to guarantee social equality and harmony. He was highly critical of [[anarcho-syndicalism]], which he viewed as plagued by excessive bureaucracy; and he thought that it tended towards reformism. Instead, he favored small groups based on ideological alignment. He supported and participated in the establishment of the IAF in 1927.{{sfn|Díez|2007}}

In 1956, [[Miguel Giménez Igualada]]—on exile escaping from [[Francisco Franco|Franco's dictatorship]]—published an extensive treatise on Stirner which he dedicated to fellow individualist anarchist Émile Armand.&lt;ref name="kclibertaria.comyr.com"/&gt; On the subject of individualist anarchist theory, he publisheds ''Anarchism'' in 1968 during his exile in Mexico from Franco's dictatorship in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antorcha.net/biblioteca_virtual/filosofia/igualada/caratula.html ''Anarquismo'' by Miguel Gimenez Igualada]&lt;/ref&gt; He was present in the First Congress of the Mexican Anarchist Federation in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antorcha.net/biblioteca_virtual/filosofia/igualada/indice.html Miguel Gimenez Igualada.

==== Germany ====
[[File:John Henry Mackay.gif|thumb|140px|[[John Henry Mackay]]]]
In Germany, the Scottish-German [[John Henry McKay]] became the most important propagandist for individualist anarchist ideas. He fused Stirnerist egoism with the positions of Benjamin Tucker and actually translated Tucker into German. Two semi-fictional writings of his own, ''[[Die Anarchisten]]'' and ''[[Der Freiheitsucher]]'', contributed to individualist theory through an updating of egoist themes within a consideration of the anarchist movement. English translations of these works arrived in the United Kingdom and in individualist American circles led by Tucker.&lt;ref name="mckay"&gt;[http://tmh.floonet.net/articles/tariley.html "New England Anarchism in Germany" by Thomas A. Riley] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/660zyRMXN?url=http://tmh.floonet.net/articles/tariley.html|date=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; McKay is also known as an important European early activist for [[gay]] rights.

Using the [[pseudonym]] Sagitta, Mackay wrote a series of works for [[pederasty|pederastic]] [[emancipation]], titled ''Die Buecher der namenlosen Liebe'' (''Books of the Nameless Love''). This series was conceived in 1905 and completed in 1913 and included the ''Fenny Skaller'', a story of a pederast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.pacbell.net/hubertk/Strauss.pdf thamyris 02&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002023257/http://home.pacbell.net/hubertk/Strauss.pdf|date=2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the same pseudonym, he also published fiction, such as ''Holland'' (1924) and a pederastic novel of the [[Berlin]] boy-bars, ''Der Puppenjunge'' (''The Hustler'') (1926).

[[File:Der Eigene - 1896.jpg|thumb|left|140px|''[[Der Eigene]]'', Stirnerist pioneer gay activist publication]]
[[Adolf Brand]] (1874–1945) was a German [[writer]], [[Philosophy of Max Stirner|Stirnerist]] [[Anarchism|anarchist]] and pioneering [[campaigner]] for the acceptance of male [[bisexuality]] and [[homosexuality]]. In 1896, Brand published a German homosexual periodical, ''[[Der Eigene]]''. This was the first ongoing homosexual publication in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]] had begun a journal called ''Prometheus'' in 1870, but only one issue was published. (Kennedy, Hubert, ''Karl Heinrich Ulrichs: First Theorist of Homosexuality'', In: 'Science and Homosexualities', ed. Vernon Rosario pp. 26–45). New York: Routledge, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The name was taken from writings of egoist philosopher [[Max Stirner]] (who had greatly influenced the young Brand) and refers to Stirner's concept of "[[self-ownership]]" of the individual. ''Der Eigene'' concentrated on cultural and scholarly material and may have had an average of around 1,500 subscribers per issue during its lifetime, although the exact numbers are uncertain. Contributors included [[Erich Mühsam]], [[Kurt Hiller]], [[John Henry Mackay]] (under the pseudonym Sagitta) and artists [[Wilhelm von Gloeden]], [[Fidus]] and [[Sascha Schneider]]. Brand contributed many poems and articles himself. [[Benjamin Tucker]] followed this journal from the United States.&lt;ref&gt;"Among the egoist papers that Tucker followed were the German ''[[Der Eigene]]'', edited by [[Adolf Brand]]" http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=796&amp;Itemid=259 "Benjamin Tucker and Liberty: A Bibliographical Essay" by Wendy McElroy&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Der Einzige]]'' was a German individualist anarchist magazine. It appeared in 1919 as a weekly, then sporadically until 1925 and was edited by cousins Anselm Ruest (pseudonym for Ernst Samuel) and Mynona (pseudonym for [[Salomo Friedlaender]]). Its title was adopted from the book ''Der Einzige und sein Eigentum'' (''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'') by [[Max Stirner]]. Another influence was the thought of German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].&lt;ref&gt;Constantin Parvulescu.

In the late 19th century in the United Kingdom, there existed individualist anarchists such as [[Wordsworth Donisthorpe]], Joseph Hiam Levy, Joseph Greevz Fisher, John Badcock Jr., Albert Tarn and [[Henry Albert Seymour]] &lt;ref name="UK"&gt;[http://www.uncletaz.com/liberty/english.html "The English Individualists As They Appear In Liberty" by Carl Watner]&lt;/ref&gt; who were close to the United States group around Benjamin Tucker's magazine ''Liberty''.

In the hybrid of [[post-structuralism]] and anarchism called [[post-anarchism]], [[Saul Newman]] has written a lot on Stirner and his similarities to post-structuralism. He writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;Max Stirner's impact on contemporary political theory is often neglected. However in Stirner's political thinking there can be found a surprising convergence with poststructuralist theory, particularly with regard to the function of power. [[Andrew Koch]], for instance, sees Stirner as a thinker who transcends the Hegelian tradition he is usually placed in, arguing that his work is a precursor poststructuralist ideas about the foundations of knowledge and truth.&lt;ref name="newman"&gt;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Saul_Newman__War_on_the_State__Stirner_and_Deleuze_s_Anarchism.html "War on the State: Stirner and Deleuze's Anarchism"] by [[Saul Newman]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Russia ====
Individualist anarchism was one of the three categories of [[anarchism in Russia]], along with the more prominent [[anarcho-communism]] and [[anarcho-syndicalism]].&lt;ref name=avruss&gt;{{cite book | authorlink=Paul Avrich |last = Avrich | first = Paul | title = [[The Russian Anarchists]] | publisher = [[AK Press]] | location = Stirling | year = 2006 | isbn = 1904859488 |page=56 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ranks of the Russian individualist anarchists were predominantly drawn from the [[intelligentsia]] and the [[working class]].&lt;ref name=avruss/&gt; For anarchist historian [[Paul Avrich]], "[t]he two leading exponents of individualist anarchism, both based in [[Moscow]], were [[Alexei Borovoi|Aleksei Alekseevich Borovoi]] and [[Lev Chernyi]] (Pavel Dmitrievich Turchaninov). From Nietzsche, they inherited the desire for a complete overturn of all values accepted by bourgeois society political, moral, and cultural. Furthermore, strongly influenced by Max Stirner and Benjamin Tucker, the German and American theorists of individualist anarchism, they demanded the total liberation of the human personality from the fetters of organized society".&lt;ref name=avruss/&gt;

Some Russian individualists anarchists "found the ultimate expression of their [[social alienation]] in violence and crime, others attached themselves to avant-garde literary and artistic circles, but the majority remained [[Philosophical anarchism|"philosophical" anarchists]] who conducted animated parlor discussions and elaborated their individualist theories in ponderous journals and books".&lt;ref name=avruss/&gt;

Lev Chernyi was an important individualist anarchist involved in resistance against the rise to power of the [[Bolshevik Party]] as he adhered mainly to Stirner and the ideas of Tucker. In 1907, he published a book entitled ''Associational Anarchism'', in which he advocated the "free association of independent individuals".&lt;ref name="chernyi"&gt;[http://flag.blackened.net/liberty/libertarians.html "Prominent Anarchists and Left-Libertarians"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101028163000/http://flag.blackened.net/liberty/libertarians.html |date=2010-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On his return from Siberia in 1917, he enjoyed great popularity among Moscow workers as a lecturer. Chernyi was also Secretary of the Moscow Federation of Anarchist Groups, which was formed in March 1917.&lt;ref name="chernyi"/&gt; He was an advocate "for the seizure of private homes",&lt;ref name="chernyi"/&gt; which was an activity seen by the anarchists after the October Revolution as direct expropriation on the bourgoise. He died after being accused of participation in an episode in which this group bombed the headquarters of the Moscow Committee of the Communist Party. Although most likely not being really involved in the bombing, he might have died of torture.&lt;ref name="chernyi"/&gt;

Chernyi advocated a [[Nietzschean]] [[Transvaluation of values|overthrow of the values]] of bourgeois Russian society, and rejected the voluntary [[Mir (social)|communes]] of anarcho-communist [[Peter Kropotkin]] as a threat to the freedom of the individual.&lt;ref name=Avrich180&gt;{{Harvnb|Avrich|2006|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Avrich|2006|p=254}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aa&gt;{{cite book |last=Chernyi |first=Lev |title=Novoe Napravlenie v Anarkhizme: Asosiatsionnii Anarkhism |origyear=1907 |edition=Moscow; 2nd |year=1923 |publisher=New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars including Avrich and Allan Antliff have interpreted this vision of society to have been greatly influenced by the individualist anarchists Max Stirner and Benjamin Tucker.&lt;ref name=sub&gt;{{cite journal |last=Antliff |first=Allan |year=2007 |title=Anarchy, Power, and Poststructuralism |journal=SubStance |volume=36 |issue=113 |pages=56–66 |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/substance/v036/36.2antliff.pdf |accessdate=2008-03-10 |doi=10.1353/sub.2007.0026 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent to the book's publication, Chernyi was imprisoned in Siberia under the Russian [[Czar]]ist regime for his revolutionary activities.&lt;ref name=match&gt;{{cite journal|last=Phillips |first=Terry |date=Fall 1984 |journal=[[The Match!]] |url=http://recollectionbooks.com/bleed/Encyclopedia/ChernyiLev.htm |issue=79 |accessdate=2008-03-10 |title=Lev Chernyi |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211173334/http://recollectionbooks.com/bleed/Encyclopedia/ChernyiLev.htm |archivedate=2008-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, [[Alexei Borovoi|Aleksei Borovoi]] (1876?–1936)&lt;ref name="quod.lib.umich.edu"&gt;http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=labadie;cc=labadie;view=toc;idno=2917084.0001.001 "Anarchism and Law." on Anarchism Pamphlets in the Labadie Collection&lt;/ref&gt; was a professor of philosophy at Moscow University, "a gifted orator and the author of numerous books, pamphlets, and articles which attempted to reconcile individualist anarchism with the doctrines of syndicallism".&lt;ref name="chernyi"/&gt; He wrote among other theoretical works ''Anarkhizm'' in 1918, just after the October Revolution;&lt;ref name="chernyi"/&gt; and ''Anarchism and Law''.&lt;ref name="quod.lib.umich.edu"/&gt; For him, "the chief importance is given not to Anarchism as the aim but to [[Anarchy]] as the continuous quest for the aim".&lt;ref name="katesharpleylibrary.net"&gt;[http://www.katesharpleylibrary.net/228105 Alexei Borovoi (from individualism to the Platform)" by Anatoly Dubovik]&lt;/ref&gt; He manifests there that "[n]o social ideal, from the point of view of anarchism, could be referred to as absolute in a sense that supposes it's the crown of human wisdom, the end of social and ethical quest of man".&lt;ref name="katesharpleylibrary.net"/&gt;

=== Latin American individualist anarchism ===
Argentine anarchist historian [[Angel Cappelletti]] reports that in Argentina "[a]mong the workers that came from Europe in the 2 first decades of the century, there was curiously some stirnerian individualists influenced by the philosophy of [[Nietzsche]], that saw syndicalism as a potential enemy of anarchist ideology. They established [...] [[affinity groups]] that in 1912 came to, according to [[Max Nettlau]], to the number of 20. In 1911 there appeared, in [[Colón, Buenos Aires|Colón]], the periodical ''El Único'', that defined itself as 'Publicación individualista'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | language = Spanish | url = https://books.google.com/?id=WUGgis_VWtEC&amp;pg=PR157&amp;lpg=PR157&amp;q=anarquismo%20nietzsche | title = El Anarquismo en América Latina | first1 = Carlos M | last1 = Rama | first2 = Ángel J | last2 = Cappellett | page = CLVII | isbn = 9789802761173 | year = 1990 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vicente Rojas Lizcano, whose pseudonym was [[Biofilo Panclasta|Biófilo Panclasta]], was a Colombian individualist anarchist writer and activist. In 1904, he began using the name Biofilo Panclasta. ''Biofilo'' in Spanish stands for "lover of life" and ''Panclasta'' for "enemy of all".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Panclasta  | first = Biófilo | year = 1928 | title = Comprimidos psicológicos de los revolucionarios criollos | journal = Periódico Claridad | place = Bogotá | language = Spanish | pages = 52–56 | ref = harv }}.&lt;/ref&gt; He visited more than fifty countries propagandizing for anarchism which in his case was highly influenced by the thought of Stirner and Nietszche. Among his written works there are ''Siete años enterrado vivo en una de las mazmorras de Gomezuela: Horripilante relato de un resucitado''(1932) and ''Mis prisiones, mis destierros y mi vida'' (1929) which talk about his many adventures while living his life as an adventurer, activist and [[Vagabond (person)|vagabond]] as well as his thought and the many times he was imprisoned in different countries.

[[File:Mlacerda.png|thumb|150px|[[Maria Lacerda de Moura]] individualist [[anarcha-feminist]]]]
[[Maria Lacerda de Moura]] was a Brazilian [[teacher]], [[journalist]], [[anarcha-feminist]] and [[individualist anarchist]]. Her ideas regarding education were largely influenced by [[Francisco Ferrer]]. She later moved to [[São Paulo]] and became involved in journalism for the anarchist and labor press. There she also lectured on topics including education, [[women's rights]], [[free love]] and [[antimilitarism]]. Her writings and essays garnered her attention not only in Brazil, but also in Argentina and Uruguay. In February 1923, she launched ''Renascença'', a periodical linked with the [[Anarchism|anarchist]], [[progressivism|progressive]] and [[freethought|freethinking]] circles of the period. Her thought was mainly influenced by individualist anarchists such as [[Han Ryner]] and [[Émile Armand]].&lt;ref name="nodo50.org"/&gt; She maintained contact with Spanish individualist anarchist circles.&lt;ref name="frenchexperimentation"/&gt;

[[Horst Matthai Quelle]] was a Spanish language German anarchist [[philosophy|philosopher]] influenced by Max Stirner.&lt;ref name="books.google.com.ec"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=E6JFPiDRlikC&amp;pg=PA345&amp;lpg=PA345#v=onepage&amp;q=horst%20matthai%20el%20humanismo%20como%20problema%20humano Horst Matthai Quelle. ''Textos Filosóficos (1989–1999)''. p. 15]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938 at the beginning of the German economic crisis and the rise of [[Nazism]] and [[fascism]] in [[Europe]], Quelle moved to Mexico. Quelle earned his undergraduate degree, [[master's degree|master's]] and [[doctorate]] in philosophy at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, where he returned as a professor of philosophy in the 1980s. He argued that since the individual gives form to the world, he is those objects, the others and the whole universe.&lt;ref name="books.google.com.ec"/&gt; One of his main views was a "theory of infinite worlds" which for him was developed by [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-socratic philosophers]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com.ec"/&gt;

== Criticisms ==
{{see also|Criticisms of anarchism}}
[[File:George bernard shaw.jpg|thumb|125px|[[George Bernard Shaw]] expressed doubts about the [[distribution of wealth]] under individualist anarchism]]
Philosopher [[Murray Bookchin]] criticized individualist anarchism for its opposition to [[democracy]] and its embrace of "[[Lifestyle anarchism|lifestylism]]" at the expense of [[class struggle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bookchin |first=Murray |title=[[Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism]] |publisher=[[AK Press]] |location=Stirling |year=1995 |isbn=9781873176832 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bookchin claimed that individualist anarchism supports only [[negative liberty]] and rejects the idea of [[positive liberty]].&lt;ref&gt;Bookchin, Murray. "Communalism: The Democratic Dimensions of Social Anarchism". ''Anarchism, Marxism and the Future of the Left: Interviews and Essays, 1993–1998''. [[AK Press]], 1999, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Albert Meltzer]] proposed that individualist anarchism differs radically from revolutionary anarchism and that it "is sometimes too readily conceded 'that this is, after all, anarchism'". He claimed that [[Benjamin Tucker]]'s acceptance of the use of a private police force (including to break up violent strikes to protect the "employer's 'freedom'") is contradictory to the definition of anarchism as "no government".&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Meltzer|Meltzer, Albert]]. ''Anarchism: Arguments For and Against''. AK Press, 2000. pp. 114–15&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher [[George Bernard Shaw]] initially had flirtations with individualist anarchism before coming to the conclusion that it was "the negation of socialism, and is, in fact, unsocialism carried as near to its logical conclusion as any sane man dare carry it". Shaw's argument was that even if wealth was initially distributed equally, the degree of ''[[laissez-faire]]'' advocated by Tucker would result in the distribution of wealth becoming unequal because it would permit private appropriation and accumulation.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, Gareth. ''Socialism and Superior Brain: The Political Thought of George Bernard Shaw''. Routledge (UK). 1993. p. 310&lt;/ref&gt; According to academic Carlotta Anderson, American individualist anarchists accept that free competition results in unequal wealth distribution, but they "do not see that as an injustice".&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Carlotta R. ''All-American Anarchist: Joseph A. Labadie and the Labor Movement'', Wayne State University Press, 1998, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt; Tucker explained: "If I go through life free and rich, I shall not cry because my neighbor, equally free, is richer. Liberty will ultimately make all men rich; it will not make all men equally rich. Authority may (and may not) make all men equally rich in purse; it certainly will make them equally poor in all that makes life best worth living".&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Benjamin. ''Economic Rent''.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;'''α'''&lt;/sup&gt;{{note label|A|α|none}} The term "individualist anarchism" is often used as a classificatory term, but in very different ways. Some sources, such as ''[[An Anarchist FAQ]]'', use the classification "[[social anarchism]]/individualist anarchism". Some see individualist anarchism as distinctly non-socialist and use the classification "socialist anarchism/individualist anarchism" accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Ostergaard|Ostergaard, Geoffrey]].

The second type is the amoral self-serving rationality of [[Egotism|egoism]] as most associated with [[Max Stirner]]. The third type is "found in [[Herbert Spencer]]'s early predictions, and in that of some of his disciples such as [[Wordsworth Donisthorpe|Donisthorpe]], foreseeing the redundancy of the state in the source of social evolution". The fourth type retains a moderated form of egoism and accounts for social cooperation through the advocacy of market relationships.&lt;ref name="Freeden, Michael pp. 313–314"/&gt;&lt;br&gt;

'''Jakob Rosenberg''' (1893 – 1980) was a German-US art historian and [[Rembrandt]] scholar.

Rosenberg was born in [[Berlin]] into a family of art dealers and in the years 1912-1914 he first did an internship in the art trade in Munich. After serving in WWI he was captured by the British in 1915 and was sent to Switzerland by prisoner exchange. After the war he studied art history in Bern and Zurich, then in Frankfurt and Munich, where he received his doctorate under [[Heinrich Wölfflin]]. He then worked for [[Max J. Friedlander]] in the Berlin print cabinet ''[[Kupferstichkabinett Berlin]]'', where he also had contact with [[Wilhelm von Bode]]. In 1935 he beame a curator there but was dismissed the same year for racial reasons. After a visit to Harvard in 1936, Jakob Rosenberg emigrated to the United States in 1937, where he was admitted to Harvard University through Adolph Goldschmidt and his friend Paul Sachs. He was first a research fellow and lecturer, in 1940 associate professor and in 1947 full professor. His 1948 overview work on Rembrandt was reprinted in 1964 and 1968, holding its own as a standard work during the early years of the [[Rembrandt Research Project]]. He was also director of the Graphic Collection of the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]] from 1939.

In 1954 he was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].

Jacob Rosenberg married Elisabeth Husserl, the daughter of [[Edmund Husserl]], in 1922.

Rosenberg died in [[Cambridge]].

'''Jeonju''' ({{IPA-ko|tɕʌn.dʑu}}) is the 16th largest [[Administrative divisions of South Korea|city]] in [[South Korea]] and the capital of [[North Jeolla Province]]. It is both urban and rural due to the closeness of [[Wanju County]] which almost entirely surrounds Jeonju. (Wanju County has many residents who work in Jeonju.) The name Jeonju literally means "Perfect Region" (from the [[hanja]] {{lang|ko|{{linktext|全}}}} ({{lang|ko|{{linktext|전}}}}; jeon) for perfect, {{lang|ko|{{linktext|州}}}} ({{lang|ko|{{linktext|주}}}}; ju) for region). It is an important tourist center famous for Korean food, historic buildings, sports activities, and innovative festivals.

In May 2012, Jeonju was chosen as a Creative Cities for [[Gastronomy]] as part of [[UNESCO]]'s [[Creative Cities Network]]. This honour recognizes the city's traditional home cooking handed down over thousands of years, its active public and private food research, a system of nurturing talented chefs, and its hosting of distinctive food festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jeonju's Gastronomic Greatness Recognized by UNESCO|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2012/05/16/2012051600865.html|accessdate=23 May 2012|newspaper=Chosun Ilbo|date=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In the fertile [[Honam]] plain, famous for [[Jeonju Hanok Village]] and exceptional produce, Jeonju has been an important regional center in the [[province]] for centuries. The city was the capital of [[Hubaekje]] Kingdom, which was founded by [[Gyeon Hwon]]. It was regarded as the spiritual [[Capital (political)|capital]] of the [[Joseon Dynasty]] because the [[Lee (Korean name)|Yi]] [[House of Yi|royal family]] originated there. The Chŏnju Kim in [[North Korea]], who [[Kim Il-sung]] was descended from, have their ancestral seat ([[Bon-gwan]]) in Jeonju as well.

The town was occupied by the [[Donghak]] peasants' movement in 1894&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=o-WlUd3cjh0C&amp;pg=PT111&amp;dq=Donghak+peasants+jeonju&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjBp_7f9fjeAhVHe7wKHRGaAkAQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Donghak%20peasants%20jeonju&amp;f=false|title=A Brief History of Korea, Volume 1|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Jeonju was given metropolitan status in 1935, and the city was founded in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=jrwTAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA140&amp;dq=Jeonju+1935&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjUxZC39fjeAhXIe7wKHYNoAb0Q6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Jeonju%201935&amp;f=false|title=Shrinking Cities: A Global Perspective|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Joseon, it was a metropolis but, left behind the industrialization, it declined compared. It does not have the infrastructure, manufacturing, or heavy industries found in other Korean major cities. Today, Traditional Tour is a major industry in the city.

== Culture ==
*Jeonju [[bibimbap]] 전주비빔밥, a traditional local food, is well known across South Korea. There are several very popular vegetarian restaurants serving Jeonju style food and pine wine&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jeonjucity.kr/jeonju-bibimbap-popular-traditional-korean-dish-among-foreigners/|title=JEONJU BIBIMBAP, THE MOST POPULAR TRADITIONAL KOREAN DISH AMONG FOREIGNERS|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
*The National Jeonju Museum exhibits ancient relics from the [[Baekje]] days.
*There are extensive royal museums, temples, a castle fortress on a hillside, and a well-known paper museum, as well as an annual paper fashion show highlighting the latest styles and traditional Korean clothing made of paper&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bemariekorea.com/things-to-do-in-jeonju-hanok-village/|title=Things To Do In Jeonju Hanok Village|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
*The Jeonju [[Hanok]] Village (Hanok Maeul) is a traditional-style village in the heart of Jeonju, housing over 800 traditional "hanok" style buildings. It contains many traditional tea shops, souvenir shops, and restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_1_1_1.jsp?cid=264285 Jeonju Hanok Village]. Visitkorea.or.kr. Retrieved on 2013-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Jeonju International Sori Festival]] was among [[Songlines]]' 25 Best International Festivals in 2014. 
*The [[Jeonju International Film Festival]] draws about 50,000 visitors annually.
*Jeonju is the hometown of the [[breakdancing]] crew [[Last for One]], international [[Battle of the Year]] champions.

The local mountains and parks are popular for outdoor recreation due to its rural location. There are historical sites in the area. The city has a zoo, a park, and the Hanguk Sound and Culture Hall, a large, modern concert complex on the [[Chonbuk National University]] campus.

Jeonju has a cooler version of a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfa/Cwa'').
Jeonju, like all of Korea, has four distinct seasons (spring, summer, fall, and winter). The winters can have a mix of days that are cool to days that are quite cold. The colder days are often influenced by a high pressure front that brings cold air from Siberia.

In the summer, the humidity over the Korean peninsula from June through September comes from southeast Asia. Temperatures in spring (late April and through May) and fall (after September 25 and though October) are often in the mid-20s℃ and with low humidity.

'''LIVAC''' is an uncommon language [[text corpus|corpus]] dynamically maintained since 1995. Different from other existing corpora, LIVAC has adopted a rigorous and regular as well as "Windows" approach in processing and filtering massive media texts from representative communities in the Pan-Chinese region including [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]], [[Taipei]], [[Singapore]], [[Shanghai]], [[Beijing]], [[Guangzhou]], and [[Shenzhen]].&lt;ref&gt;Tsou, Benjamin; Lai, Tom; Chan, Samuel; and Wang, William S.-Y. (Eds). (1998). ''Quantitative and Computational Studies on the Chinese Language'' 《漢語計量與計算研究》. Language Information Sciences Research Centre, City University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The contents are thus deliberately repetitive in most cases, represented by textual samples drawn from editorials, local and international news, cross-[[Taiwan Strait|Formosan Straits]] news, as well as news on finance, sports and entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Tsou, B. K., Kwong, O.Y. (Eds). (2015). ''Linguistic Corpus and Corpus Linguistics in the Chinese Context'' ''(Journal of Chinese Linguistics Monograph Series Number 25)'', Hong Kong: [[Chinese University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; By 2017, 2.5 billion characters of news media texts have been filtered so far, of which 600 million characters have been processed and analyzed and have yielded an expanding Pan-Chinese dictionary of 2 million words from the Pan-Chinese printed media. Through rigorous analysis based on computational methodology, LIVAC has at the same time accumulated a large amount of accurate and meaningful statistical data on the Chinese language and their speech communities in the Pan-Chinese region, and the result shows considerable and important variations.&lt;ref&gt;Tsou, Benjamin. (2004). "Chinese Language Processing at the Dawn of the 21st Century", in C R Huang and W Lenders (eds) ''Language and Linguistics Monograph Series B: Frontiers in Linguistics I'', pp.189–207. Institute of Linguistics, [[Academia Sinica]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tsou, B. K. (2017). Loanwords in Mandarin Through Other Chinese Dialects. In R. Sybesma, W. Behr, Y. Gu, Z. Handel, C.-T. Huang &amp; J. Myers (Eds.), ''The Encyclopaedia of Chinese Language and Linguistics'' (Vol. 2, pp. 641-647). Leiden; Boston: BRILL&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Windows" approach is the most representative feature of LIVAC and has enabled Pan-Chinese media texts to be quantitatively analyzed according to various attributes such as ''locations'', ''time'' and ''subject'' domains. Thus, various types of comparative studies and applications in information technology as well as development of often related innovative applications have been possible.&lt;ref&gt;Tsou, Benjamin, and Kwong, Olivia. (2015). LIVAC as a Monitoring Corpus for Tracking Trends beyond Linguistics. In Tsou, Benjamin, and Kwong, Olivia.,  (eds.), ''Linguistic Corpus and Corpus Linguistics in the Chinese Context'' ''(Journal of Chinese Linguistics Monograph Series No.25)''. Hong Kong: The Chinese University Press, pp. 447-471.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tsou, Benjamin. (2016). Skipantism Revisited: Along with Neologisms and Terminological Truncation. In Chin, Chi-on Andy and Kwok, Bit-chee and Tsou, Benjamin K., (eds.), ''Commemorative Essays for Professor Yuen-Ren Chao: Father of Modern Chinese Linguistics''. Taiwan: Crane Publishing. pp. 343-357.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, LIVAC has allowed longitudinal developments to be taken into account, facilitating [[Key Word in Context]] (KWIC) and comprehensive study of target words and their underlying concepts as well as linguistic structures over the past 20 years, based on variables such as ''region'', ''duration'' and ''content''. Results from the extensive and accumulative data analysis contained in LIVAC have enabled the cultivation of textual databases of proper names, place names, organization names, new words, and bi-weekly and annual rosters of media figures. Related applications have included the establishment of verb and adjective databases, the formulation of sentiment indices, and related opinion mining, to measure and compare the popularity of global media figures in the Chinese media (LIVAC Annual Pan-Chinese Celebrity Rosters, later renamed as the Pan-Chinese Media Personalities Rosters)&lt;ref&gt;[http://wikisites.cityu.edu.hk/sites/newscentre/en/Pages/201512281400.aspx CityU releases 2015 LIVAC Pan-Chinese Media Personality Roster], [[City University of Hong Kong]], Hong Kong, 28 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wikisites.cityu.edu.hk/sites/media/pr/Pages/2017010201.aspx CityU releases 2016 LIVAC Pan-Chinese Media Personality Roster], [[City University of Hong Kong]], Hong Kong, 02 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; and construction of monthly new word lexicons (LIVAC Annual Pan-Chinese New Word Rosters).&lt;ref&gt;[http://wikisites.cityu.edu.hk/sites/newscentre/en/Pages/201502121400.aspx CityU releases 2014 Pan-Chinese New Word Rosters], [[City University of Hong Kong]], Hong Kong, 12 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wikisites.cityu.edu.hk/sites/newscentre/en/pages/201602041130.aspx CityU releases 2015 LIVAC Pan-Chinese New Word Rosters], [[City University of Hong Kong]], Hong Kong, 04 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; On this basis, the analysis of the emergence, diffusion and transformation of new words, and the publication of dictionaries of [[neologism]]s have been made possible.&lt;ref&gt;鄒嘉彥、游汝杰（編）（2007），《21世紀華語新詞語詞典》（簡體字版），上海，復旦大學出版社。&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;鄒嘉彥、游汝杰（編）（2010），《全球華語新詞語詞典》，北京，商務印書館。&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corpus data processing==
# Accessing media texts, manual input, etc.
# Text unification including conversion from simplified to traditional Chinese characters, stored as [[Big5]] and [[Unicode]] versions
# Automatic word segmentation
# Automatic alignment of parallel texts
# Manual verification, part-of-speech tagging
# Extraction of words and addition to regional sub-corpora
# Combination of regional sub-corpora to update the LIVAC corpus, and master lexical database

==Labeling for data curation==
# Categories used include general terms and proper names, such as: general names, surnames, semi titles; geographical, organizations and commercial entities, etc.; time, prepositions, locations, etc.; stack-words; loanwords; case-word; numerals, etc.
# Construction of databases of proper names, place names, and specific terms, etc.
# Generate rosters: "new word rosters", "celebrity or media personality rosters", "place name rosters", compound words and matched words
# Other parts of speech tagging for sub-database, such as common nouns, numerals, numeral classifiers, different types of verbs, and of adjectives, pronouns, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, particles marking mood, onomatopoeia, interjection, etc.

==Applications==
# Compilation of Pan-[[Chinese dictionaries]] or local dictionaries
# Information technology research, such as predictive Chinese text input for mobile phones, automatic speech to text conversion, opinion mining
# Comparative studies on linguistic and cultural developments in the Pan-Chinese regions
# Language teaching and learning research, and speech-to-text conversion
# Customized service on linguistic research and lexical search for international corporations and government agencies

'''Logical positivism''' and '''logical empiricism''', which together formed '''neopositivism''', was a movement in [[Western philosophy]] whose central thesis was [[verificationism]], a [[epistemology|theory of knowledge]] which asserted that only statements verifiable through [[empirical]] observation are cognitively meaningful.  The movement flourished in the 1920s and 1930s in several European centers.  

Efforts to convert philosophy to this new "scientific philosophy", shared with [[empirical sciences]]' best examples, such as [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[general theory of relativity]], sought to prevent confusion rooted in unclear language and unverifiable claims.&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxiv/&gt; 

The [[Berlin Circle (philosophy)|Berlin Circle]] and [[Vienna Circle]]—groups of philosophers, scientists, and mathematicians in Berlin and Vienna—propounded logical [[positivism]], starting in the late 1920s.

==Influences==
Logical positivists culled from [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus|Ludwig Wittgenstein's early philosophy of language]] the verifiability principle or criterion of meaningfulness.  As in [[Ernst Mach]]'s [[phenomenalism]], whereby the mind knows only actual or potential sensory experience,&lt;ref name="dictcc"&gt;{{cite quote|url=www11.dict.cc/wp_examples.php?lp_id=1&amp;lang=en&amp;s=sensory%20experience|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; verificationists took all sciences' basic content to be only sensory experience.  And some influence came from [[Percy Bridgman]]'s musings that others proclaimed as [[operationalism]], whereby a physical theory is understood by what laboratory procedures scientists perform to test its predictions.  In verificationism, only the ''verifiable'' was scientific, and thus meaningful (or ''cognitively meaningful''), whereas the unverifiable, being unscientific, were meaningless "pseudostatements" (just ''emotively meaningful'').  Unscientific discourse, as in ethics and metaphysics, would be unfit for discourse by philosophers, newly tasked to organize knowledge, not develop new knowledge.

==Definitions==
Logical positivism is sometimes stereotyped as forbidding talk of [[unobservable]]s, such as microscopic entities or such notions as causality and general principles,{{fact|date=January 2018}} but that is an exaggeration.  Rather, most neopositivists viewed talk of unobservables as [[metaphor]]ical or elliptical: direct observations phrased abstractly or indirectly.  So ''theoretical terms'' would garner meaning from ''observational terms'' via ''correspondence rules'', and thereby ''theoretical laws'' would be reduced to ''empirical laws''.  Via [[Bertrand Russell]]'s [[logicism]], reducing mathematics to logic, physics' mathematical formulas would be converted to [[symbolic logic]].  Via Russell's [[logical atomism]], [[natural language|ordinary language]] would break into discrete units of meaning.  [[Rational reconstruction]], then, would convert ordinary statements into standardized equivalents, all networked and united by a [[logical syntax]].  A scientific theory would be stated with its method of verification, whereby a [[logical calculus]] or [[operationalism|empirical operation]] could [[deductive inference|verify]] its [[truth-value|falsity or truth]].

==Development==
In the late 1930s, logical positivists fled Germany and Austria for Britain and the United States.  By then, many had replaced Mach's phenomenalism with [[Otto Neurath]]'s [[physicalism]], whereby science's content is not actual or potential sensations, but instead is entities publicly observable. [[Rudolf Carnap]], who had sparked logical positivism in the Vienna Circle, had sought to replace ''verification'' with simply ''confirmation''.  With [[World War II]]'s close in 1945, logical positivism became milder, ''logical empiricism'', led largely by [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Carl Hempel]], in America, who expounded the [[covering law model]] of scientific explanation.  Logical positivism became a major underpinning of [[analytic philosophy]],&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;See [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/vienna-circle "Vienna Circle"] in ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.&lt;/ref&gt; and dominated philosophy in the [[English-speaking world]], including [[philosophy of science]], while influencing sciences, but especially social sciences, into the 1960s.  Yet the movement failed to resolve its central problems,&lt;ref name="Smith1986"&gt;{{cite book |first=L.D. |last=Smith |year=1986 |title=Behaviorism and Logical Positivism: A Reassessment of the Alliance |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=9780804713016 |lccn=85030366 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IZ6aAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA314 |page=314 |quote=The secondary and historical literature on logical positivism affords substantial grounds for concluding that logical positivism failed to solve many of the central problems it generated for itself. Prominent among the unsolved problems was the failure to find an acceptable statement of the verifiability (later confirmability) criterion of meaningfulness. Until a competing tradition emerged (about the late 1950's), the problems of logical positivism continued to be attacked from within that tradition. But as the new tradition in the philosophy of science began to demonstrate its effectiveness—by dissolving and rephrasing old problems as well as by generating new ones—philosophers began to shift allegiances to the new tradition, even though that tradition has yet to receive a canonical formulation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bunge1996"&gt;{{cite book |first=M.A. |last=Bunge |year=1996 |title=Finding Philosophy in Social Science |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=9780300066067 |lccn=lc96004399 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8YAV43gVMsIC&amp;pg=PA317 |page=317 |quote=To conclude, logical positivism was progressive compared with the classical positivism of [[Ptolemy]], [[David Hume|Hume]], d'Alembert, [[August Compte|Compte]], [[John Stuart Mill]], and [[Ernst Mach]]. It was even more so by comparison with its contemporary rivals—[[neo-Thomisism]], [[neo-Kantianism]], [[intuitionism]], dialectical materialism, phenomenology, and [[existentialism]]. However, neo-positivism failed dismally to give a faithful account of science, whether natural or social. It failed because it remained anchored to sense-data and to a phenomenalist metaphysics, overrated the power of induction and underrated that of hypothesis, and denounced realism and materialism as metaphysical nonsense. Although it has never been practiced consistently in the advanced natural sciences and has been criticized by many philosophers, notably Popper (1959 [1935], 1963), logical positivism remains the tacit philosophy of many scientists. Regrettably, the anti-positivism fashionable in the metatheory of social science is often nothing but an excuse for sloppiness and wild speculation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drury.edu/ess/philsci/popper.html |title=Popper, Falsifiability, and the Failure of Positivism |date=7 August 2000 |accessdate=30 June 2012 |quote=The upshot is that the positivists seem caught between insisting on the V.C. [Verifiability Criterion]—but for no defensible reason—or admitting that the V.C. requires a background language, etc., which opens the door to relativism, etc. In light of this dilemma, many folk—especially following Popper's "last-ditch" effort to "save" empiricism/positivism/realism with the falsifiability criterion—have agreed that positivism is a dead-end. |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107230818/http://www.drury.edu/ess/philsci/popper.html |archivedate=7 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and its doctrines were increasingly criticized, most trenchantly by [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], [[Norwood Russell Hanson|Norwood Hanson]], [[Karl Raimund Popper|Karl Popper]], [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]], and [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Carl Hempel]].

==Roots==

===Language===

''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'', by the young [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], introduced the view of philosophy as "critique of language", offering the possibility of a theoretically principled distinction of intelligible versus nonsensical discourse.  ''Tractatus'' adhered to a [[correspondence theory of truth]] (versus a [[coherence theory of truth]]).  Wittgenstein's influence also shows in some versions of the [[verifiability principle]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, compare "Proposition 4.024" of ''Tractatus'', asserting that we understand a proposition when we know the outcome if it is true, with Schlick's asserting, "To state the circumstances under which a proposition is true is the same as stating its meaning".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Positivismus und realismus", ''Erkenntnis'' '''3''':1–31, English trans in Sarkar, Sahotra, ed, ''Logical Empiricism at its Peak: Schlick, Carnap, and Neurath'' (New York: Garland Publishing, 1996), p 38.&lt;/ref&gt;  In tractarian doctrine, truths of logic are [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]], a view widely accepted by logical positivists who were also influenced by Wittgenstein's interpretation of [[probability]] although, according to Neurath, some logical positivists found ''Tractatus'' to contain too much metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;For summary of the effect of Tractatus on logical positivists, see the [http://www.pitt.edu/~philosop/images/doc4-full.jpg Entwicklung der Thesen des "Wiener Kreises"].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logicism===

[[Gottlob Frege]] began the program of reducing mathematics to logic, continued it with [[Bertrand Russell]], but lost interest in this [[logicism]], and Russell continued it with [[Alfred North Whitehead]] in their ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', inspiring some of the more mathematical logical posivists, such as [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]] and [[Rudolf Carnap]].&lt;ref name=Hintikka/&gt;  (Carnap's early anti-metaphysical works employed Russell's [[type theory|theory of types]].)&lt;ref&gt;See Rudolf Carnap, "The elimination Of metaphysics through logical analysis of language", ''Erkenntnis'', 1932;'''2''', reprinted in ''Logical Positivism'', Alfred Jules Ayer, ed, (New York: Free Press, 1959), pp 60–81.&lt;/ref&gt;  Carnap envisioned a universal language that could reconstruct mathematics and thereby encode physics.&lt;ref name=Hintikka&gt;Jaako Hintikka, "Logicism", in Andrew D Irvine, ed, ''Philosophy of Mathematics'' (Burlington MA: North Holland, 2009),  [https://books.google.com/books?id=mbn35b2ghgkC&amp;pg=PA283&amp;dq=Logical+positivism+logicism pp 283–84].&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet [[Kurt Gödel]]'s [[incompleteness theorem]] showed this impossible except in trivial cases, and [[Alfred Tarski]]'s [[undefinability theorem]] shattered all hopes of reducing mathematics to logic.&lt;ref name=Hintikka/&gt;  Thus, a universal language failed to stem from Carnap's 1934 work ''Logische Syntax der Sprache'' (''Logical Syntax of Language'').&lt;ref name=Hintikka/&gt;  Still, some logical positivists, including [[Carl Hempel]], continued support of logicism.&lt;ref name=Hintikka/&gt;

===Empiricism===

In Germany, [[Hegelian metaphysics]] was a dominant movement, and Hegelian successors such as [[F H Bradley]] explained reality by postulating metaphysical entities lacking empirical basis, drawing reaction in the form of positivism.&lt;ref name="Suppe, Frederick 1999"&gt;Frederick Suppe, "The positivist model of scientific theories", in ''Scientific Inquiry'', Robert Klee, ed, (New York: Oxford University Press, 1999), pp 16-24.&lt;/ref&gt;  Starting in the late 19th century, there was a "back to Kant" movement.  [[Ernst Mach]]'s positivism and [[phenomenalism]] were a major influence.

==Origins==

===Vienna===

The [[Vienna Circle]], gathering around [[University of Vienna]] and [[Café Central]], was led principally by [[Moritz Schlick]].  Schlick had held a [[neo-Kantianism|neo-Kantian]] position, but later converted, via Carnap's 1928 book ''Der logische Aufbau der Welt'', that is, ''The Logical Structure of the World''.  A 1929 pamphlet written by [[Otto Neurath]], [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]], and [[Rudolf Carnap]] summarized the Vienna Circle's positions.  Another member of Vienna Circle to later prove very influential was [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Carl Hempel]].  A friendly but tenacious critic of the Circle was [[Karl Popper]], whom [[Otto Neurath|Neurath]] nicknamed the "Official Opposition".

[[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap]] and other [[Vienna Circle]] members, including [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hahn]] and [[Otto Neurath|Neurath]], saw need for a weaker criterion of meaningfulness than verifiability.&lt;ref name=Sarkar2005/&gt;  A radical "left" wing—led by Neurath and Carnap—began the program of "liberalization of empiricism", and they also emphasized [[fallibilism]] and [[pragmatics]], which latter Carnap even suggested as empiricism's basis.&lt;ref name=Sarkar2005/&gt;  A conservative "right" wing—led by [[Moritz Schlick|Schlick]] and [[Friedrich Waismann|Waismann]]—rejected both the liberalization of empiricism and the epistemological nonfoundationalism of a move from [[phenomenalism]] to [[physicalism]].&lt;ref name=Sarkar2005/&gt;  As Neurath and somewhat Carnap posed science toward social reform, the split in Vienna Circle also reflected political views.&lt;ref name=Sarkar2005/&gt;

===Berlin===

The [[Berlin Circle (philosophy)|Berlin Circle]] was led principally by [[Hans Reichenbach]].

===Rivals===

Both [[Moritz Schlick]] and [[Rudolf Carnap]] had been influenced by and sought to define logical positivism versus the neo-Kantianism of [[Ernst Cassirer]]—the then leading figure of [[Marburg school]], so called—and against [[Edmund Husserl]]'s [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].  Logical positivists especially opposed [[Martin Heidegger]]'s obscure metaphysics, the epitome of what logical positivism rejected.  In the early 1930s, Carnap debated Heidegger over "metaphysical pseudosentences".&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxii/&gt;  Despite its revolutionary aims, logical positivism was but one view among many vying within Europe, and logical positivists initially spoke their language.&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxii/&gt;

===Export===

As the movement's first emissary to the [[New World]], [[Moritz Schlick]] visited [[Stanford University]] in 1929, yet otherwise remained in Vienna and was murdered at the [[University of Vienna|University]], reportedly by a deranged student, in 1936.&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxii/&gt;  That year, a British attendee at some Vienna Circle meetings since 1933, [[A. J. Ayer]] saw his ''[[Language, Truth and Logic]]'', written in English, import logical positivism to the [[English-speaking world]].  By then, the [[Nazi Party]]'s 1933 rise to power in Germany had triggered flight of intellectuals.&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxii/&gt; In exile in England, [[Otto Neurath]] died in 1945.&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxii/&gt;  [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Hans Reichenbach]], and [[Carl Hempel]]—Carnap's [[protégé]] who had studied in [[Berlin]] with Reichenbach—settled permanently in America.&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxii/&gt;  Upon Germany's [[annexation of Austria]] in 1938, remaining logical positivists, many of whom were also Jewish, were targeted and continued flight.  Logical positivism thus became dominant in the English-speaking world.

==Principles==

===Analytic/synthetic gap===

Concerning [[metaphysics|reality]], the [[logical truth|necessary]] is a state true in all [[possible worlds]]—mere [[logical validity]]—whereas the [[contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] hinges on the way the particular world is.  Concerning [[epistemology|knowledge]], the ''[[A priori knowledge|a priori]]'' is knowable before or without, whereas the ''[[a posteriori]]'' is knowable only after or through, relevant experience.  Concerning [[propositions|statements]], the ''[[analytic-synthetic distinction|analytic]]'' is true via terms' [[syntax|arrangement]] and [[semantics|meanings]], thus a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]]—true by logical necessity but uninformative about the world—whereas the ''[[analytic-synthetic distinction|synthetic]]'' adds reference to a state of facts, a [[contingency (philosophy)|contingency]].

In 1739, [[David Hume]] cast a [[Hume's fork|fork]] aggressively dividing "relations of ideas" from "matters of fact and real existence", such that all truths are of one type or the other.&lt;ref name=Flew&gt;Antony G Flew, ''A Dictionary of Philosophy'', rev 2nd edn (New York: St Martin's Press, 1984), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq=Hume's+fork "Hume's fork"], p 156.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helen B Mitchell, ''Roots of Wisdom: A Tapestry of Philosophical Traditions: A Tapestry of Philosophical Traditions'', 6th edn (Boston: Wadsworth, 2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=P6o0OUzwmSAC&amp;pg=PA249&amp;dq=logical+positivism+Hume's+fork "Hume's fork and logical positivism"], pp 249-50.&lt;/ref&gt;  By Hume's fork, truths by relations among ideas (abstract) all align on one side (analytic, necessary, ''a priori''), whereas truths by states of actualities (concrete) always align on the other side (synthetic, contingent, ''a posteriori'').&lt;ref name=Flew/&gt;  At any treatises containing neither, Hume orders, "Commit it then to the flames, for it can contain nothing but [[sophistry]] and illusion".&lt;ref name=Flew/&gt;

Thus awakened from "dogmatic slumber", [[Immanuel Kant]] quested to answer Hume's challenge—but by explaining how [[metaphysics]] is possible.  Eventually, in his [[Critique of Pure Reason|1781 work]], Kant crossed the tines of Hume's fork to identify another range of truths by necessity—[[synthetic a priori|synthetic ''a priori'']], statements claiming states of facts but known true before experience—by arriving at [[transcendental idealism]], attributing the mind a constructive role in [[phenomena]] by arranging [[sense data]] into the very experience ''space'', ''time'', and ''substance''.  Thus, Kant saved [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] from Hume's [[problem of induction]] by finding uniformity of nature to be ''a priori'' knowledge.  Logical positivists rejected Kant's [[synthetic a priori|synthethic ''a priori'']], and staked [[Hume's fork]], whereby a statement is either analytic and ''a priori'' (thus [[logical truth|necessary]] and verifiable logically) or synthetic and ''[[a posteriori]]'' (thus [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] and verifiable empirically).&lt;ref name=Flew/&gt;

===Observation/theory gap===

Early, most logical positivists proposed that all knowledge is based on logical inference from simple "protocol sentences" grounded in observable facts.  In the 1936 and 1937 papers "Testability and meaning", individual terms replace sentences as the units of meaning.&lt;ref name=Sarkar2005/&gt;  Further, theoretical terms no longer need to acquire meaning by explicit definition from observational terms: the connection may be indirect, through a system of implicit definitions.&lt;ref name=Sarkar2005/&gt;  (Carnap also provides an important, pioneering discussion of [[disposition predicate]]s.)&lt;ref name=Sarkar2005/&gt;

===Cognitive meaningfulness===

====Verification====

The logical positivists' initial stance was that a statement is "cognitively meaningful" only if some finite procedure conclusively determines its truth.&lt;ref&gt;For a classic survey of other versions of verificationism, see Carl G Hempel, "Problems and changes in the empiricist criterion of meaning", ''Revue Internationale de Philosophie'', 1950;'''41''':41-63.&lt;/ref&gt;  By this [[verifiability principle]], only statements verifiable either by their [[analytic proposition|analyticity]] or by empiricism were ''cognitively meaningful''.  [[Metaphysics]], [[ontology]], as well as much of [[ethics]] failed this criterion, and so were found ''cognitively meaningless''.  Moritz Schlick, however, did not view ethical or aesthetic statements as [[meaning (philosophy of language)|cognitively meaningless]].&lt;ref&gt;See Moritz Schlick, "The future Of philosophy", in ''The Linguistic Turn'', Richard Rorty, ed, (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1992), pp 43-53.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Cognitive meaningfulness'' was variously defined: having a [[truth value]]; corresponding to a possible state of affairs; intelligible or understandable as are scientific statements.&lt;ref&gt;Examples of these different views can be found in Scheffler's ''Anatomy of Inquiry'', Ayer's ''Language, Truth, and Logic'', Schlick's "Positivism and realism" (reprinted in Sarkar 1996 and Ayer 1959), and Carnap's ''Philosophy and Logical Syntax''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ethics]] and [[aesthetics]] were subjective preferences, while [[theology]] and other [[metaphysics]] contained "pseudostatements", neither true nor false.  This meaningfulness was cognitive, although other types of meaningfulness—for instance, emotive, expressive, or figurative—occurred in metaphysical discourse, dismissed from further review.  Thus, logical positivism indirectly asserted [[Hume's law]], the principle that ''is'' statements cannot justify ''ought'' statements, but are separated by an unbridgeable gap.  [[A. J. Ayer]]'s 1936 book asserted an extreme variant—the [[emotivism|boo/hooray doctrine]]—whereby all evaluative judgments are but emotional reactions.

====Confirmation====

In an important pair of papers in 1936 and 1937, "Testability and meaning", Carnap replaced ''verification'' with ''confirmation'', on the view that although universal laws cannot be verified they can be confirmed.&lt;ref name=Sarkar2005/&gt;  Later, Carnap employed abundant logical and mathematical methods in researching inductive logic while seeking to provide an account of probability as "degree of confirmation", but was never able to formulate a model.&lt;ref name=IEP-Carnap&gt;Mauro Murzi [http://www.iep.utm.edu/carnap "Rudolf Carnap (1891—1970)"], ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', 12 Apr 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Carnap's inductive logic, every universal law's degree of confirmation is always zero.&lt;ref name=IEP-Carnap/&gt;  In any event, the precise formulation of what came to be called the "criterion of cognitive significance" took three decades (Hempel 1950, Carnap 1956, Carnap 1961).&lt;ref name=Sarkar2005/&gt;

[[Carl Hempel]] became a major critic within the logical positivism movement.&lt;ref name="sep-hempel"&gt;{{cite web |first=James |last=Fetzer |editor=Edward N. Zalta |year=2012 |title=Carl Hempel |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition=Summer 2012 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hempel/#SciRea |quote=It would fall to Hempel to become perhaps the most astute critic of that movement and to contribute to its refinement as logical empiricism... Hempel himself attained a certain degree of prominence as a critic of this movement... The analytic/synthetic distinction and the observational/theoretical distinction were tied together by the ''verifiability criterion of meaningfulness''... By this standard, sentences that are non-analytic but also non-verifiable, including various theological or metaphysical assertions concerning God or The Absolute, qualify as cognitively meaningless. This was viewed as a desirable result. But, as Hempel would demonstrate, its scope was far too sweeping, since it also rendered meaningless the distinctively scientific assertions made by laws and theories... The analytic/synthetic distinction took a decided hit when the noted logician, Willard van Orman Quine, published "Two Dogmas of Empiricism" (1953), challenging its adequacy... While the analytic/synthetic distinction appears to be justifiable in modeling important properties of languages, the observational/theoretical distinction does not fare equally well. Within logical positivism, observation language was assumed to consist of names and predicates whose applicability or not can be ascertained, under suitable conditions, by means of direct observation...  Karl Popper (1965, 1968), however, would carry the argument in a different direction by looking at the ontic nature of properties... Hempel (1950, 1951), meanwhile, demonstrated that the verifiability criterion could not be sustained. Since it restricts empirical knowledge to observation sentences and their deductive consequences, scientific theories are reduced to logical constructions from observables. In a series of studies about cognitive significance and empirical testability, he demonstrated that the verifiability criterion implies that existential generalizations are meaningful, but that universal generalizations are not, even though they include general laws, the principal objects of scientific discovery. Hypotheses about relative frequencies in finite sequences are meaningful, but hypotheses concerning limits in infinite sequences are not. The verifiability criterion thus imposed a standard that was too strong to accommodate the characteristic claims of science and was not justifiable... Both theoretical and dispositional predicates, which refer to non-observables, posed serious problems for the positivist position, since the verifiability criterion implies they must be reducible to observables or are empirically meaningless... The need to dismantle the verifiability criterion of meaningfulness together with the demise of the observational/theoretical distinction meant that logical positivism no longer represented a rationally defensible position. At least two of its defining tenets had been shown to be without merit. Since most philosophers believed that Quine had shown the analytic/synthetic distinction was also untenable, moreover, many concluded that the enterprise had been a total failure. Among the important benefits of Hempel's critique, however, was the production of more general and flexible criteria of cognitive significance... Hempel suggested multiple criteria for assessing the cognitive significance of different theoretical systems, where significance is not categorical but rather a matter of degree... The elegance of Hempel's study laid to rest any lingering aspirations for simple criteria of cognitive significance and signaled the demise of logical positivism as a philosophical movement. Precisely what remained, however, was in doubt. Presumably, anyone who rejected one or more of the three principles defining positivism—the analytic/synthetic distinction, the observational/theoretical distinction, and the verifiability criterion of significance—was not a logical positivist. The precise outlines of its philosophical successor, which would be known as "logical empiricism", were not entirely evident. Perhaps this study came the closest to defining its intellectual core. Those who accepted Hempel's four criteria and viewed cognitive significance as a matter of degree were members, at least in spirit. But some new problems were beginning to surface with respect to Hempel's covering-law explication of explanation and old problems remained from his studies of induction, the most remarkable of which was known as "the paradox of confirmation".}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hempel elucidated the [[paradox of the ravens|paradox of confirmation]].

====Weak verification====

The second edition of [[A. J. Ayer]]'s book arrived in 1946, and discerned ''strong'' versus ''weak'' forms of verification.  Ayer concluded, "A proposition is said to be verifiable, in the strong sense of the term, if, and only if, its truth could be conclusively established by experience", but is verifiable in the weak sense "if it is possible for experience to render it probable".&lt;ref name=Ayer-p50&gt;Ayer, ''[[Language, Truth and Logic]]'', 1946, p 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt;  And yet, "no proposition, other than a [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]], can possibly be anything more than a probable [[hypothesis]]".&lt;ref name=Ayer-p50/&gt;  Thus, all are open to weak verification.

==Philosophy of science==

Upon the global defeat of [[Nazism]], and the removal from philosophy of rivals for radical reform—[[Marburg school|Marburg]] neo-Kantianism, [[Edmund Husserl|Husserlian]] phenomenology, [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]'s "existential hermeneutics"—and while hosted in the climate of American [[pragmatism]] and commonsense empiricism, the neopositivists shed much of their earlier, revolutionary zeal.&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxiv/&gt;  No longer crusading to revise traditional philosophy into a new ''scientific philosophy'', they became respectable members of a new philosophy subdiscipline, ''[[philosophy of science]]''.&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxiv&gt;Michael Friedman, ''Reconsidering Logical Positivism'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e9TjZc9wNUAC&amp;pg=PR14 p xiv].&lt;/ref&gt;  Receiving support from [[Ernest Nagel]], logical empiricists were especially influential in the social sciences.&lt;ref name=Novick-p546&gt;Novick, ''That Noble Dream'' (Cambridge U P, 1988), [https://books.google.com/books?id=mhiw__MLyVAC&amp;pg=PA546&amp;dq=Carnap+Hempel+Nagel+social+sciences+natural+fact+value p 546].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Explanation===

[[positivism|Comtean positivism]] had viewed science as ''description'', whereas the [[logical positivists]] posed science as ''explanation'', perhaps to better realize the envisioned [[unity of science]] by covering not only [[fundamental science]]—that is, [[fundamental interactions|fundamental physics]]—but the [[special science]]s, too, for instance [[biology]], [[anthropology]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], and [[economics]].&lt;ref name=Woodward-Background&gt;James Woodward, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/scientific-explanation "Scientific explanation"]—sec 1 "Background and introduction", in Zalta EN, ed,''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Winter 2011 edn&lt;/ref&gt;  The most widely accepted concept of scientific explanation, held even by neopositivist critic [[Karl Popper]], was the [[deductive-nomological model]] (DN model).&lt;ref name=Woodward-introduction&gt;James Woodward, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/scientific-explanation "Scientific explanation"]—Article overview, Zalta EN, ed, ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Winter 2011 edn&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet DN model received its greatest explication by [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Carl Hempel]], first in his 1942 article "The function of general laws in history", and more explicitly with [[Paul Oppenheim]] in their 1948 article "Studies in the logic of explanation".&lt;ref name=Woodward-introduction/&gt;

In the DN model, the stated phenomenon to be explained is the ''explanandum''—which can be an event, [[scientific law|law]], or [[scientific theory|theory]]—whereas premises stated to explain it are the ''explanans''.&lt;ref name=Suppe&gt;Suppe, ''Structure of Scientific Theories'' (U Illinois P, 1977), [https://books.google.com/books?id=SpvZsxCA0TIC&amp;pg=PA619&amp;dq= pp 619–21].&lt;/ref&gt;  Explanans must be true or highly confirmed, contain at least one law, and entail the explanandum.&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;   Thus, given initial conditions ''C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; . . . C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' plus general laws ''L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; . . . L&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', event ''E'' is a deductive consequence and scientifically explained.&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;  In the DN model, a law is an unrestricted generalization by conditional proposition—''If A, then B''—and has empirical content testable.&lt;ref&gt;Eleonora  Montuschi, ''Objects in Social Science'' (London &amp; New York: Continuum, 2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=bQ24-BV8WSAC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq= pp 61–62].&lt;/ref&gt;  (Differing from a merely true regularity—for instance, ''George always carries only $1 bills in his wallet''—a law suggests what ''must'' be true,&lt;ref&gt;Bechtel, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), p 25.&lt;/ref&gt; and is consequent of a [[scientific theory]]'s [[axiom]]atic structure.&lt;ref&gt;Bechtel, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), pp 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt;)

By the [[David Hume|Humean]] empiricist view that humans observe sequences of events, (not cause and effect, as causality and causal mechanisms are unobservable), the DN model neglects causality beyond mere [[constant conjunction]], first event ''A'' and then always event ''B''.&lt;ref name=Woodward-Background/&gt;  Hempel's explication of the DN model held [[natural laws]]—empirically confirmed regularities—as satisfactory and, if formulated realistically, approximating causal explanation.&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;  In later articles, Hempel defended the DN model and proposed a probabilistic explanation, [[inductive-statistical model]] (IS model).&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;  the DN and IS models together form the ''covering law model'',&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt; as named by a critic, [[William Dray]].&lt;ref&gt;Georg Henrik von Wright, ''Explanation and Understanding'' (Ithaca NY: Cornell University Press, 1971), [https://books.google.com/books?id=33wCi2bg5x0C&amp;pg=PA11 p 11].&lt;/ref&gt;  (Derivation of statistical laws from other statistical laws goes to [[deductive-statistical model]] (DS model).)&lt;ref name=Glennan&gt;Stuart Glennan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=od68ge7aF6wC&amp;pg=PA276&amp;dq= p 276], in Sarkar S &amp; Pfeifer J, eds, ''The Philosophy of Science: An Encyclopedia'', Volume 1: A–M (New York: Routledge, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Georg Henrik von Wright]], another critic, named it ''subsumption theory'',&lt;ref name=Riedel&gt;Manfred Riedel, [https://books.google.com/books?id=It3ji_AuO3sC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=Covering+subsumption pp 3–4], in Manninen J &amp; Tuomela R, eds, ''Essays on Explanation and Understanding: Studies in the Foundation of Humanities and Social Sciences'' (Dordrecht: D Reidel Publishing, 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; fitting the ambition of theory reduction.

===Unity of science===

Logical positivists were generally committed to "[[Unified Science]]", and sought a common language or, in Neurath's phrase, a "universal slang" whereby all scientific propositions could be expressed.&lt;ref&gt;For a review of "unity of science" to, see Gregory Frost-Arnold, [http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00002005/01/PSA2004Short.rtf "The large-scale structure of logical empiricism: Unity of science and the rejection of metaphysics"].&lt;/ref&gt; The adequacy of proposals or fragments of proposals for such a language was often asserted on the basis of various "reductions" or "explications" of the terms of one [[special science]] to the terms of another, putatively more fundamental. Sometimes these reductions consisted of set-theoretic manipulations of a few logically primitive concepts (as in Carnap's ''Logical Structure of the World'' (1928)).  Sometimes, these reductions consisted of allegedly analytic or ''a priori'' deductive relationships (as in Carnap's "Testability and meaning"). A number of publications over a period of thirty years would attempt to elucidate this concept.

===Theory reduction===

As in [[positivism|Comtean positivism]]'s envisioned [[unity of science]], neopositivists aimed to network all [[special science]]s through the [[covering law model|covering law model of scientific explanation]].  And ultimately, by supplying [[boundary condition]]s and supplying bridge laws within the covering law model, all the special sciences' laws would reduce to [[fundamental interactions|fundamental physics]], the [[fundamental science]].

==Critics==

After [[World War II]], key tenets of logical positivism, including its atomistic philosophy of science, the verifiability principle, and the [[Hume's law|fact/value gap]], drew escalated criticism.  It was clear that empirical claims cannot be verified to be universally true.&lt;ref name=Sarkar2005&gt;{{cite book |first=S |last=Sarkar |first2=J |last2=Pfeifer |year=2005 |title=The Philosophy of Science: An Encyclopedia |volume=1 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=9780415939270 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=od68ge7aF6wC&amp;pg=PA83 |page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, as initially stated, the verifiability criterion made [[universal proposition|universal statement]]s meaningless, and even made statements beyond empiricism for technological but not conceptual reasons meaningless, which would pose significant problems for science.&lt;ref name="sep-hempel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sep-problem-of-induction"&gt;{{cite web |author=John Vicker |editor=Edward N Zalta |year=2011 |title=The problem of induction |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition=Fall 2011 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2011/entries/induction-problem/#VerCon |quote=This initial formulation of the criterion was soon seen to be too strong; it counted as meaningless not only metaphysical statements but also statements that are clearly empirically meaningful, such as that all copper conducts electricity and, indeed, any universally quantified statement of infinite scope, as well as statements that were at the time beyond the reach of experience for technical, and not conceptual, reasons, such as that there are mountains on the back side of the moon. These difficulties led to modification of the criterion: The latter to allow empirical verification if not in fact then at least in principle, the former to soften verification to empirical confirmation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sep-vienna-circle"&gt;{{cite web |first=Thomas |last=Uebel |editor=Edward N. Zalta |year=2008 |title=Vienna Circle |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition=Fall 2008 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/vienna-circle/ |quote=What Carnap later called the "liberalization of empiricism" was underway and different camps became discernible within the Circle... In the first place, this liberalization meant the accommodation of universally quantified statements and the return, as it were, to salient aspects of Carnap's 1928 conception. Everybody had noted that the Wittgensteinian verificationist criterion rendered universally quantified statements meaningless. Schlick (1931) thus followed Wittgenstein's own suggestion to treat them instead as representing rules for the formation of verifiable singular statements. (His abandonment of conclusive verifiability is indicated only in Schlick 1936a.) A second element that began to do so soon was the recognition of the problem of the irreducibility of disposition terms to observation terms... A third element was that disagreement arose as to whether the in-principle verifiability or support turned on what was merely logically possible or on what was nomologically possible, as a matter of physical law etc. A fourth element, finally, was that differences emerged as to whether the criterion of significance was to apply to all languages or whether it was to apply primarily to constructed, formal languages. Schlick retained the focus on logical possibility and natural languages throughout, but Carnap had firmly settled his focus on nomological possibility and constructed languages by the mid-thirties. Concerned with natural language, Schlick (1932, 1936a) deemed all statements meaningful for which it was logically possible to conceive of a procedure of verification; concerned with constructed languages only, Carnap (1936-37) deemed meaningful only statements for whom it was nomologically possible to conceive of a procedure of confirmation of disconfirmation.&lt;br&gt;Many of these issues were openly discussed at the Paris congress in 1935. Already in 1932 Carnap had sought to sharpen his previous criterion by stipulating that those statements were meaningful that were syntactically well-formed and whose non-logical terms were reducible to terms occurring in the basic observational evidence statements of science. While Carnap's focus on the reduction of descriptive terms allows for the conclusive verification of some statements, his criterion also allowed universally quantified statements to be meaningful, provided they were syntactically and terminologically correct (1932a, §2). It was not until one of his Paris addresses, however, that Carnap officially declared the meaning criterion to be mere confirmability. Carnap's new criterion required neither verification nor falsification but only partial testability so as now to include not only universal statements but also the disposition statements of science... Though plausible initially, the device of introducing non-observational terms in this way gave rise to a number of difficulties which impugned the supposedly clear distinctions between logical and empirical matters and analytic and synthetic statements (Hempel 1951). Independently, Carnap himself (1939) soon gave up the hope that all theoretical terms of science could be related to an observational base by such reduction chains. This admission raised a serious problem for the formulation of a meaning criterion: how was one to rule out unwanted metaphysical claims while admitting as significant highly abstract scientific claims?}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These problems were recognized within the movement, which hosted attempted solutions—Carnap's move to ''confirmation'', Ayer's acceptance of ''weak verification''—but the program drew sustained criticism from a number of directions by the 1950s.  Even philosophers disagreeing among themselves on which direction general [[epistemology]] ought to take, as well as on [[philosophy of science]], agreed that the logical empiricist program was untenable, and it became viewed as self-contradictory.&lt;ref name=Putnam1985&gt;{{cite book |author=Hilary Putnam |year=1985 |title=Philosophical Papers: Volume 3, Realism and Reason |series=Philosophical Papers |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521313940 |lccn=lc82012903 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HAjfSA3ir3kC&amp;pg=PA184 |page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The verifiability criterion of meaning was itself unverified.&lt;ref name=Putnam1985/&gt;  Notable critics included [[Nelson Goodman]], [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], [[Norwood Russell Hanson|Norwood Hanson]], [[Karl Raimund Popper|Karl Popper]], [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]], [[J. L. Austin|J L Austin]], [[Peter Strawson]], [[Hilary Putnam]], and [[Richard Rorty]].

===Quine===

Although quite empiricist, American logician [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] published the 1951 paper "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]",&lt;ref&gt;W V O Quine, "Two Dogmas of Empiricism", ''Philosophical Review'' 1951;'''60''':20-43, collected in Quine, ''From a Logical Point of View'' (Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press, 1953).&lt;/ref&gt; which challenged conventional empiricist presumptions.  Quine attacked the [[analytic-synthetic distinction|analytic/synthetic division]], which the verificationist program had been hinged upon in order to entail, by consequence of [[Hume's fork]], both [[logical truth|necessity]] and apriocity.  Quine's [[ontological relativity]] explained that every term in any statement has its meaning contingent on a vast network of knowledge and belief, the speaker's conception of the entire world.  Quine later proposed [[naturalized epistemology]].

===Hanson===

In 1958, [[Norwood Russell Hanson|Norwood Hanson]]'s ''Patterns of Discovery'' undermined the division of [[observation]] versus [[theory]],&lt;ref name=Novick-p527&gt;Novick, ''That Noble Dream'' (Cambridge U P, 1988), [https://books.google.com/books?id=mhiw__MLyVAC&amp;pg=PA527&amp;dq=Hanson p 527].&lt;/ref&gt; as one can predict, collect, prioritize, and assess data only via some horizon of expectation set by a theory.  Thus, any [[dataset]]—the direct observations, the scientific facts—is [[theory-laden|laden with theory]].

===Popper===
An early, tenacious critic was [[Karl Popper]] whose 1934 book ''Logik der Forschung'', arriving in English in 1959 as ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'', directly answered verificationism.  Popper heeded the [[problem of induction]] as rendering empirical verification logically impossible,&lt;ref&gt;Popper then denies that science requires [[inductive inference]] or that it actually exists, although most philosophers believe it exists and that science requires it [Samir Okasha, ''The Philosophy of Science: A Very Short Introduction'' (NY: [[Oxford University Press|OUP]], 2002), p 23],&lt;/ref&gt;  and the [[deductive fallacy]] of [[affirming the consequent]] reveals any phenomenon's capacity to host more than one logically possible explanation.  Accepting [[scientific method]] as [[hypothetico-deductive model|hypotheticodeduction]], whose [[argument form|inference form]] is [[denying the consequent]], Popper finds scientific method unable to proceed without  [[falsifiable]] predictions.  Popper thus identifies [[falsifiability]] to [[problem of demarcation|demarcate]] not ''meaningful'' from ''[[meaningless statement|meaningless]]'' but simply ''scientific'' from  ''unscientific''—a label not in itself unfavorable.

Popper finds virtue in [[metaphysics]], required to develop new scientific theories.  And an unfalsifiable—thus unscientific, perhaps metaphysical—concept in one era can later, through evolving knowledge or technology, become falsifiable, thus scientific.  Popper also found science's quest for truth to rest on values.  Popper disparages the ''[[pseudoscientific]]'', which occurs when an unscientific theory is proclaimed true and coupled with seemingly scientific method by "testing" the unfalsifiable theory—whose predictions are confirmed by necessity—or when a scientific theory's falsifiable predictions are strongly falsified but the theory is persistently protected by "immunizing stratagems", such as the appendage of ''[[ad hoc]]'' clauses saving the theory or the recourse to increasingly speculative hypotheses shielding the theory.

Popper's ''scientific'' epistemology is [[falsificationism]], which finds that no number, degree, and variety of empirical successes can either verify or confirm scientific theory.  Falsificationism finds science's aim as ''corroboration'' of scientific theory, which strives for [[scientific realism]] but accepts the maximal status of strongly corroborated [[verisimilitude]] ("truthlikeness").  Explicitly denying the positivist view that all knowledge is scientific, Popper developed the ''general'' epistemology [[critical rationalism]], which finds human knowledge to evolve by ''conjectures and refutations''.  Popper thus acknowledged the value of the positivist movement, driving evolution of human understanding, but claimed that he had "killed positivism".

===Kuhn===

With his landmark, ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1962), [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]] critically destabilized the verificationist program, which was presumed to call for [[foundationalism]].  (Actually, even in the 1930s, [[Otto Neurath]] had argued for nonfoundationalism via [[coherentism]] by likening science to a boat ([[Neurathian bootstrap|Neurath's boat]]) that scientists must rebuild at sea.&lt;ref name=ONPSP&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|title=Otto Neurath: Philosophy Between Science and Politics|volume=38|series=Ideas in Context|first1=Nancy|last1=Cartwright|authorlink1=Nancy Cartwright (philosopher) |first2=Jordi|last2=Cat|first3=Lola|last3=Fleck|first4=Thomas E.|last4=Uebel|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2008|isbn=9780521041119|chapter=On Neurath's Boat|pages=89–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  Although Kuhn's thesis itself was attacked even by opponents of neopositivism, in the 1970 postscript to ''Structure'', Kuhn asserted, at least, that there was no [[algorithm]] to science—and, on that, even most of Kuhn's critics agreed.

Powerful and persuasive, Kuhn's book, unlike the vocabulary and symbols of logic's [[formal language]], was written in [[natural language]] open to the layperson.&lt;ref name=Novick-p526/&gt;  Ironically, Kuhn's book was first published in a volume of ''Encyclopedia of Unified Science''—a project begun by logical positivists—and some sense unified science, indeed, but by bringing it into the realm of historical and social assessment, rather than fitting it to the model of physics.&lt;ref name=Novick-p526/&gt;  Kuhn's ideas were rapidly adopted by scholars in disciplines well outside natural sciences,&lt;ref name=Novick-p526&gt;Novick, ''That Noble Dream'' (Cambridge U P, 1988), [https://books.google.com/books?id=mhiw__MLyVAC&amp;pg=PA526&amp;dq=Kuhn's+logical+Unified pp 526-27].&lt;/ref&gt; and, as logical empiricists were extremely influential in the [[social science]]s,&lt;ref name=Novick-p546/&gt; ushered academia into [[postpositivism]] or postempiricism.&lt;ref name=Novick-p526/&gt;

===Putnam===

The "[[Received view of theories|received view]]" operates on the ''correspondence rule'' that states, "The observational terms are taken as referring to specified phenomena or phenomenal properties, and the only interpretation given to the theoretical terms is their explicit definition provided by the correspondence rules".&lt;ref name="Suppe, Frederick 1999"/&gt;  According to [[Hilary Putnam]], a former student of [[Hans Reichenbach|Reichenbach]] and of [[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap]], the dichotomy of observational terms versus theoretical terms introduced a problem within scientific discussion that was nonexistent until this dichotomy was stated by logical positivists.&lt;ref&gt;Hilary Putnam, "Problems with the observational/theoretical distinction", in ''Scientific Inquiry,'' Robert Klee, ed (New York, USA: Oxford University Press, 1999), pp 25-29.&lt;/ref&gt;  Putnam's four objections:

# Something is referred to as "observational" if it is observable directly with our senses. Then an observation term cannot be applied to something unobservable. If this is the case, there are no observation terms.
# With Carnap's classification, some unobservable terms are not even theoretical and belong to neither observation terms nor theoretical terms. Some theoretical terms refer primarily to observation terms.
# Reports of observation terms frequently contain theoretical terms.
# A scientific theory may not contain any theoretical terms (an example of this is Darwin's original theory of evolution).

Putnam also alleged that positivism was actually a form of [[idealism|metaphysical idealism]] by its rejecting scientific theory's ability to garner knowledge about nature's unobservable aspects.  With his "no miracles" argument, posed in 1974, Putnam asserted [[scientific realism]], the stance that science achieves true—or approximately true—knowledge of the world as it exists independently of humans' sensory experience.  In this, Putnam opposed not only the positivism but other [[instrumentalism]]—whereby scientific theory is but a human tool to predict human observations—filling the void left by positivism's decline.

==Retrospect==

By the late 1960s, logical positivism had become exhausted.&lt;ref name="Fotionarticle"&gt;{{cite book |author=Nicholas G Fotion |editor=Ted Honderich |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=1995 |page=508 |isbn=0-19-866132-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Interviewed in the late 1970s, [[A. J. Ayer]] supposed that "the most important" defect "was that nearly all of it was false".&lt;ref name=Routledge/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cnRJGs08hE |title=Ayer on Logical Positivism: Section 4 |at=6:30}}&lt;/ref&gt; After some laughter, he says that "it was true in spirit."  Although logical positivism tends to be recalled as a pillar of [[scientism]],&lt;ref name=Stahl-etal-p180&gt;Stahl ''et al'', ''Webs of Reality'' (Rutgers U P, 2002), [https://books.google.com/books?id=GY6i84rSKMcC&amp;pg=PA180&amp;dq=metaphysical+naturalism+logical+positivism+materialism+scientific+scientism p 180].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Hempel]] was key in establishing the philosophy subdiscipline [[philosophy of science]]&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxii&gt;Friedman, ''Reconsidering Logical Positivism'' (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e9TjZc9wNUAC&amp;pg=PR12 p xii].&lt;/ref&gt; where [[Thomas Kuhn]] and [[Karl Popper]] brought in the era of [[postpositivism]].&lt;ref name=Novick-p526/&gt;  [[John Passmore]] found logical positivism to be "dead, or as dead as a philosophical movement ever becomes".&lt;ref name=Routledge&gt;{{cite book|last=Hanfling|first=Oswald|chapter=Logical Positivism|title=Routledge History of Philosophy|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|pages=193f}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Logical positivism's fall reopened debate over the metaphysical merit of scientific theory, whether it can offer knowledge of the world beyond human experience ([[scientific realism]]) versus whether it is but a human tool to predict human experience ([[instrumentalism]]).&lt;ref&gt;Hilary Putnam, "What is realism?", in Jarrett Leplin, ed, ''Scientific Realism'' (Berkeley, Los Angeles, London: University of California Press, 1984), [https://books.google.com/books?id=zhBeVFm8WuAC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;dq=Realism+realists+positivism+opera-tionalism p 140].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Lane, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0951692896008003003 "Positivism, scientific realism and political science: Recent developments in the philosophy of science"], ''Journal of Theoretical Politics'', 1996 Jul'''8'''(3):361-82, abstract.&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, it became popular among philosophers to rehash the faults and failures of logical positivism without investigation of it.&lt;ref name=Friedman-p1&gt;Friedman, ''Reconsidering Logical Positivism'' (Cambridge, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e9TjZc9wNUAC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=half+centry+bogeyman+faults+failings+dispassionate p 1].&lt;/ref&gt;  Thereby, logical positivism has been generally misrepresented, sometimes severely.&lt;ref name=Friedman-p2/&gt;  Arguing for their own views, often framed versus logical positivism, many philosophers have reduced logical positivism to simplisms and stereotypes, especially the notion of logical positivism as a type of [[foundationalism]].&lt;ref name=Friedman-p2&gt;Friedman, ''Reconsidering Logical Positivism'' (Cambridge, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e9TjZc9wNUAC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=clear+critics+agendas+foundationalism p 2].&lt;/ref&gt;  In any event, the movement helped anchor [[analytic philosophy]] in the [[English-speaking world]], and returned Britain to [[empiricism]].  Without the logical positivists, who have been tremendously influential outside philosophy, especially in [[psychology]] and social [[sciences]], intellectual life of the 20th century would be unrecognizable.&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxii/&gt;

'''Khussa''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|'''کُھسّہ '''}}}}), 
is a style of South Asian [[Handicraft|handcrafted]] footwear produced in Punjab [[Pakistan]].

Khussa are made by [[artisan]]s mostly using vegetable-tanned [[leather]]. The uppers are made of one piece of leather or [[textile]] embroidered and embellished with brass nails, [[cowry]] shells, mirrors, bells and [[ceramic]] beads. Even the bonding from the upper to the [[Sole (shoe)|sole]] is done by cotton thread that is not only [[eco-friendly]] but also enmeshes the leather [[fiber]]s with great strength. Some product range also uses bright and ornate threads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Feet &amp; footwear in Indian culture|author= Jutta Jain-Neubauer|author2=Bata Shoe Museum |publisher=Mapin Publishing Pvt. Ltd. |year=2000|isbn=81-85822-69-7 |page=126, 175 |url= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ancient history|ancient times]] these were worn by multitude and royalty. As it evolved through the centuries and is being produced by individual artisans, products vary in designs and colours. It encapsules [[cultural diversity]], local ethos and ethnicity.

The ethnicity of the traditional skills accentuate into poetry when intermingled with the contemporary colours and designs. Applique in form of differently designed figures are cut out of leather and sewn on the vamp manually. The design would dictate the nature, colour and shape of the appliqué. It could range from an intricate appliqué which itself could incorporate other design features like embroidery, punches, weaves, etc., to a simple cut out shape from any material like leather, textile, synthetic, etc.

==History==
[[Multan]] has a very long tradition of leather crafts ranging from handbags, leather stools to Khussa, Kolhapuris and Jootis centered at [[Rajasthan]], [[Delhi]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Karnataka]] &amp; [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. The production of these heavily embroidered [[jutti]]s date back to the period of Kings and Queens. In those times, these juttis were embroidered with real gold and silver threads and decorated with precious gems and pearls. But, with the passage of time, these were replaced by artificial materials, beads, bells etc. in order to make them affordable for everyone. These juttis &amp; Khussas are made of buffalo, cow or camel leather soles, while the upper part comprises leather or simply textile. Both the parts are joined together by a paste and then stitched by white cotton threads.

Khussa is referred to a man's closed shoe with an extended curled toe, while as juttis have flat fronts. In juttis, rear is normally covered but Khussa have an open look from behind. Produced mainly in [[Multan]], [[Rajasthan]] and [[Punjab Pakistan |Punjab]], these juttis were flat soled and there were no left-right distinctions between them.

'''Ohio History Connection''' is a [[non-profit organization]] incorporated in 1885 as '''The Ohio State Archaeological and Historical Society''' "to promote a knowledge of [[archaeology]] and [[history]], especially in [[Ohio]]".&lt;ref name=articlesincorporation&gt;{{cite journal|year=1898|title=Articles of Incorporation: March 13, 1885 |journal=Ohio Archaeological and Historical Publications|volume=VI|page=ix|url=http://publications.ohiohistory.org/ohstemplate.cfm?action=detail&amp;Page=0006ix.html&amp;StartPage=ix&amp;EndPage=&amp;volume=6&amp;newtitle=Volume%206%20Page%20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until May 24, 2014, the organization was known as the '''Ohio Historical Society'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Shannon|last=Thomas|url=http://www.ohiohistory.org/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/ohio-history-connection-announcement|title=Ohio Historical Society Changes Its Name To Ohio History Connection|date=2014-04-21|publisher=Ohio History Connection}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ohio History Connection exists to interpret, preserve, collect, and make available evidence of the past, and to provide leadership on furthering knowledge, understanding, and appreciation of the [[prehistory]] and history of Ohio and of the broader cultural and natural environments of which Ohio is a part. Its predecessor was founded by [[Brigadier General|Brig. Gen.]] [[Roeliff Brinkerhoff]] in 1875.  That society became dormant, and was revived at the urging of Governor [[George Hoadly]] in 1885.&lt;ref name=histsociety&gt;{{cite journal|year=1898|title=History of the Ohio State Archaeological and Historical Society|journal=Ohio Archaeological and Historical Publications|volume=VI|issue= |page=vii|url=http://publications.ohiohistory.org/ohstemplate.cfm?action=detail&amp;Page=0006vii.html&amp;StartPage=vii&amp;EndPage=viii&amp;volume=6&amp;newtitle=Volume%206%20Page%20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ohio History Center==
[[File:Ohio History Center 2018 001.jpg|thumb|Ohio History Center in Columbus, Ohio in 2018]]
Ohio History Connection operates dozens of state historic sites across Ohio.  Its headquarters is the 250,000-square-foot (23,000 m²) '''Ohio History Center''' in [[Columbus, Ohio]], a [[Brutalism|Brutalist]] concrete structure.&lt;ref name="ode"&gt;{{cite web| title=An Ode to Brutal Architecture| url=http://ohiohistory.wordpress.com/2010/06/07/an-ode-to-brutal-architecture/| date=7 June 2010| publisher=Ohio Historical Society| accessdate=2011-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Ohio Historical Center: A Defense| url=http://onsummit.blogspot.com/2010/06/ohio-historical-center-defense.html| date=7 June 2010| publisher=OnSummit.blogspot.com| author=Jeff Regenburger| accessdate=2011-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Extensive exhibits cover Ohio's history from the [[Ice Age]] to the present.  The Center includes state archives and library spaces, a gift shop, and administrative and educational facilities.  The 1989 ''[[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]] Guide to Historic America'' described the Center as "probably the finest museum in America devoted to pre-European history."

=== Curators ===
The Ohio History Connection has appointed a Curator of Archaeology, to oversee the museum's archaeological collection, since 1894:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.ohiohistory.org/ohioarchaeology/lucy-allen-the-ohio-history-connections-first-female-curator-of-archaeology/|title=Lucy Allen – The Ohio History Connection's First Female Curator of Archaeology|last=Lepper|first=Brad|date=2014-10-03|website=Ohio History Connection Archaeology Blog|publisher=Ohio History Connection|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ohio Village==
[[Ohio Village]], a reconstructed 1890s-era town, is a [[living museum]] on the grounds of the Ohio History Center.&lt;ref name="OHC Ohio Village"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ohio Village|url=https://www.ohiohistory.org/visit/ohio-village|website=Ohio History Connection|accessdate=May 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, budget cuts forced the Ohio Village to close except for special events, school and tour groups. Since 2012, it is open to visitors from Memorial Day to Labor Day and for special events such as the Country Living Fair, All Hallows Eve, and Dickens of a Christmas.

The village houses the renowned Ohio Village Muffins, a vintage baseball club. Since 1981, the Muffins have promoted the preservation of the game as it was played in 1860.  Competitions are played every year.

==Ohio History Connection Resources==
Ohio History Connection also provides educators with resources for the state's schools.  Field trips, outreach programs, and educational kit trunks are available to assist teachers with supplemental learning in their classrooms. Also offered are distance learning courses. Affiliated with the Ohio History Connection is the Ohio Educational Resources Center, which loans materials to assist teachers with their lessons.  The society also provides public programs that include speakers, theatrical productions, conferences, workshops, holiday gatherings, and presentations.  The topics of these programs range from the [[Underground Railroad]] to the role of the state in other historical events.

Ohio History Connection publishes '''''Ohio History Central''''', an extensive online encyclopedia of Ohio history. ''Ohio History Central'' consists of over 3,000 entries about Ohio's natural history, prehistory, and history. The entries are complemented by nearly 2,000 images. The site is fully searchable, and users may browse entries by category, topic, media, time period, or geographic region within the state. Special features include image galleries, Ohio Quick Facts, Ohio Across Time (a time line of events that occurred in Ohio or that impacted Ohio’s history), and Useful Links (to Ohio History Connection websites; Ohio county and local history websites; and other state, municipal, and regional encyclopedias). Registered users can also create personal scrapbooks using any of the encyclopedia's entries and images.

Ohio History Connection maintains an online archive of [[Ohio History (journal)|Ohio History]], a peer reviewed scholarly journal first published by the society in 1887, and since 2007 by the Kent State University Press.&lt;ref&gt;[http://publications.ohiohistory.org/ohstemplate.cfm?action=toc Online archive of past volumes of Ohio History]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Olmecs''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɒ|l|m|ɛ|k|s|,_|ˈ|oʊ|l|-}}) were the earliest known major civilization in [[Mesoamerica]] following a progressive development in [[Soconusco]]. They lived in the tropical lowlands of south-central Mexico, in the present-day states of [[Veracruz]] and [[Tabasco]]. It has been speculated that the Olmecs derive in part from neighboring [[Mokaya]] or [[Mixe–Zoque languages|Mixe–Zoque]].

The Olmecs flourished during [[Mesoamerica]]'s [[Mesoamerican chronology|formative period]], dating roughly from as early as 1500 [[Before the Common Era|BCE]] to about 400&amp;nbsp;BCE. Pre-Olmec cultures had flourished in the area since about 2500&amp;nbsp;BCE, but by 1600–1500&amp;nbsp;BCE, early Olmec culture had emerged, centered on the [[San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán]] site near the coast in southeast Veracruz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Olmecs : America's First Civilization|authorlink= Richard Diehl|last=Diehl|first=Richard A.|publisher=Thames and Hudson|year=2004|location=London|isbn=0-500-28503-9|pages=9–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were the first Mesoamerican civilization, and laid many of the foundations for the civilizations that followed.&lt;ref&gt;See Pool (2007) p. 2. Although there is wide agreement that the Olmec culture helped lay the foundations for the civilizations that followed, there is disagreement over the extent of the Olmec contributions, and even a proper definition of the Olmec "culture". See "[[Olmec influences on Mesoamerican cultures]]" for a deeper treatment of this question.&lt;/ref&gt; Among other "firsts", the Olmec appeared to practice [[Bloodletting in Mesoamerica|ritual bloodletting]] and played the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]], hallmarks of nearly all subsequent Mesoamerican societies. The aspect of the Olmecs most familiar now is their artwork, particularly the aptly named "[[Olmec colossal heads|colossal heads]]".&lt;ref&gt;See, as one example, Diehl, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The Olmec civilization was first defined through artifacts which collectors purchased on the [[pre-Columbian art]] market in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Olmec artworks are considered among ancient America's most striking.&lt;ref&gt;See Diehl, p. 108 for the "ancient America" superlatives. The artist and archaeologist [[Miguel Covarrubias]] (1957) p. 50 says that Olmec pieces are among the world's masterpieces.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name 'Olmec' comes from the [[Nahuatl]] word for the Olmecs: ''Ōlmēcatl'' {{IPA-nah|oːlˈmeːkat͡ɬ|}} (singular) or ''Ōlmēcah'' {{IPA-nah|oːlˈmeːkaʔ|}} (plural). This word is composed of the two words ''ōlli'' {{IPA-nah|ˈoːlːi|}}, meaning "rubber", and ''mēcatl'' {{IPA-nah|ˈmeːkat͡ɬ|}}, meaning "people", so the word means "rubber people".&lt;ref&gt;''Olmecas'' (n.d.). Think Quest. Retrieved 20 September 2012, from [http://library.thinkquest.org/28059/olmecas.htm link] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024235315/http://library.thinkquest.org/28059/olmecas.htm |date=24 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coe (1968) p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Olmec Heartland Overview 4.svg|right|thumb|350px|The [[Olmec heartland]], where the Olmec reigned from 1400 to 400&amp;nbsp;BCE]]
The [[Olmec heartland]] is the area in the [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf]] lowlands where it expanded after early development in [[Soconusco]], Veracruz. This area is characterized by swampy lowlands punctuated by low hills, ridges, and volcanoes. The [[Sierra de Los Tuxtlas|Tuxtlas Mountains]] rise sharply in the north, along the Gulf of Mexico's [[Bay of Campeche]]. Here, the Olmec constructed permanent city-temple complexes at [[San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán]], [[La Venta]], [[Tres Zapotes]], and [[Laguna de los Cerros]]. In this region, the first Mesoamerican civilization emerged and reigned from {{circa}} 1400–400&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Dates from Pool, p. 1. Diehl gives a slightly earlier date of 1500&amp;nbsp;BCE (p. 9), but the same end-date. Any dates for the start of the Olmec civilization or culture are problematic as its rise was a gradual process. Most Olmec dates are based on radiocarbon dating (see e.g. Diehl, p. 10), which is only accurate within a given range (e.g. ±90 years in the case of early [[El Manati]] layers), and much is still to be learned concerning early Gulf lowland settlements.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===
{{Main|San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán}}
The beginnings of Olmec civilization have traditionally been placed between 1400 and 1200&amp;nbsp;BCE. Past finds of Olmec remains ritually deposited at El Manati shrine (near San Lorenzo) moved this back to "at least" 1600–1500&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Richard A Diehl, 2004, The Olmecs – America's First Civilization London: Thames &amp; Hudson, pp. 25, 27.&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that the Olmec had their roots in early farming cultures of [[Tabasco]], which began between 5100&amp;nbsp;BCE and 4600&amp;nbsp;BCE. These shared the same basic food crops and technologies of the later Olmec civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, 2004: pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

What is today called Olmec first appeared fully within the city of San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán, where distinctive Olmec features occurred around 1400&amp;nbsp;BCE. The rise of civilization was assisted by the local ecology of well-watered [[alluvial]] soil, as well as by the transportation network provided by the [[Coatzacoalcos River]] basin. This environment may be compared to that of other ancient centers of civilization: the [[Nile]], [[Indus]], and [[Yellow River]] valleys, and [[Mesopotamia]]. This highly productive environment encouraged a densely concentrated population, which in turn triggered the rise of an elite class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Beck | first = Roger B. | author2 = Linda Black | author3 = Larry S. Krieger | author4 = Phillip C. Naylor| author5 = Dahia Ibo Shabaka | title = World History: Patterns of Interaction | publisher = McDougal Littell | year = 1999 | location = Evanston, IL | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-395-87274-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; The elite class created the demand for the production of the symbolic and sophisticated luxury artifacts that define Olmec culture.&lt;ref&gt;Pool, pp. 26–27, provides a great overview of this theory, and says: "The generation of food surpluses is necessary for the development of social and political hierarchies and there is no doubt that high agricultural productivity, combined with the natural abundance of aquatic foods in the Gulf lowlands supported their growth."&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these luxury artifacts were made from materials such as [[Jade use in Mesoamerica|jade]], [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]], and [[magnetite]], which came from distant locations and suggest that early Olmec elites had access to an extensive trading network in Mesoamerica. The source of the most valued jade was the [[Motagua River]] valley in eastern [[Guatemala]],&lt;ref&gt;Pool, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; and Olmec obsidian has been traced to sources in the Guatemala highlands, such as El Chayal and [[San Martín Jilotepeque]], or in [[Puebla (state)|Puebla]],&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, p. 132, or Pool, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; distances ranging from 200 to 400&amp;nbsp;km (120–250 miles) away, respectively.&lt;ref name="Pool, p. 103"&gt;Pool, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

The state of [[Guerrero]], and in particular its early [[Mezcala culture]], seem to have played an important role in the early history of Olmec culture. Olmec-style artifacts tend to appear earlier in some parts of Guerrero than in the Veracruz-Tabasco area. In particular, the relevant objects from the Amuco-Abelino site in Guerrero reveal dates as early as 1530 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Toby Evans, David L. Webster, eds, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vZ3DAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA315 ''Archaeology of Ancient Mexico and Central America: An Encyclopedia.''] Routledge, 2013 {{ISBN|1136801855}} p. 315&lt;/ref&gt; The city of [[Teopantecuanitlan]] in Guerrero is also relevant in this regard.

===La Venta===
{{main|La Venta}}
[[Image:La Venta Pirámide cara sur.jpg|250px|thumb|Great pyramid in [[La Venta]], [[Tabasco]]]]
The first Olmec center, San Lorenzo, was all but abandoned around 900&amp;nbsp;BCE at about the same time that La Venta rose to prominence.&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; A wholesale destruction of many San Lorenzo monuments also occurred [[circa]] 950&amp;nbsp;BCE, which may indicate an internal uprising or, less likely, an invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Coe (1967), p. 72. Alternatively, the mutilation of these monuments may be unrelated to the decline and abandonment of San Lorenzo. Some researchers believe that the mutilation had ritualistic aspects, particularly since most mutilated monuments were reburied in a row.&lt;/ref&gt; The latest thinking, however, is that environmental changes may have been responsible for this shift in Olmec centers, with certain important rivers changing course.&lt;ref&gt;Pool, p. 135. Diehl, pp. 58–59, 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

In any case, following the decline of San Lorenzo, La Venta became the most prominent Olmec center, lasting from 900&amp;nbsp;BCE until its abandonment around 400&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, p. 9. Pool gives dates 1000&amp;nbsp;BCE&amp;nbsp;– 400&amp;nbsp;BCE for La Venta.&lt;/ref&gt; La Venta sustained the Olmec cultural traditions with spectacular displays of power and wealth. The [[La Venta#Complex C (The Great Pyramid)|Great Pyramid]] was the largest Mesoamerican structure of its time. Even today, after 2500 years of erosion, it rises {{convert|34|m|abbr=on}} above the naturally flat landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Pool, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; Buried deep within La Venta lay opulent, labor-intensive "offerings"&amp;nbsp;– 1000 tons of smooth [[Serpentine group|serpentine]] blocks, large mosaic pavements, and at least 48 separate [[votive deposits|deposits]] of polished jade [[celt (tool)|celts]], pottery, figurines, and [[hematite]] [[Mirrors in Mesoamerican culture|mirrors]].&lt;ref&gt;Pool, p. 161–162.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline===
Scholars have yet to determine the cause of the eventual extinction of the Olmec culture. Between 400 and 350&amp;nbsp;BCE, the population in the eastern half of the Olmec heartland dropped precipitously, and the area was sparsely inhabited until the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, p. 82. Nagy, p. 270, however, is more circumspect, stating that in the [[Grijalva river]] delta, on the eastern edge of the heartland, "the local population had significantly declined in apparent population density&amp;nbsp;... A low-density Late Preclassic and Early Classic occupation . . . may have existed; however, it remains invisible."&lt;/ref&gt; According to archaeologists, this depopulation was probably the result of "very serious environmental changes that rendered the region unsuited for large groups of farmers", in particular changes to the riverine environment that the Olmec depended upon for agriculture, hunting and gathering, and transportation. These changes may have been triggered by [[tectonic]] upheavals or subsidence, or the [[Siltation|silting]] up of rivers due to agricultural practices.&lt;ref&gt;Quote and analysis from Diehl, p. 82, echoed in other works such as Pool.&lt;/ref&gt;

One theory for the considerable population drop during the Terminal Formative period is suggested by Santley and colleagues (Santley et al. 1997), who propose the relocation of settlements due to volcanism, instead of extinction. Volcanic eruptions during the Early, Late and Terminal Formative periods would have blanketed the lands and forced the Olmec to move their settlements.&lt;ref&gt;Vanderwarker (2006) pp. 50–51&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever the cause, within a few hundred years of the abandonment of the last Olmec cities, successor cultures became firmly established. The Tres Zapotes site, on the western edge of the Olmec heartland, continued to be occupied well past 400&amp;nbsp;BCE, but without the hallmarks of the Olmec culture. This post-Olmec culture, often labeled [[Epi-Olmec culture|Epi-Olmec]], has features similar to those found at [[Izapa]], some 550&amp;nbsp;km (330&amp;nbsp;miles) to the southeast.&lt;ref&gt;Coe (2002), p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==
[[File:Olmec fish vessel.jpg|upright|thumb|Fish Vessel, 12th–9th century&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;br&gt;Height: 6.5 inches (16.5 cm).]]
[[File:Olmec baby-face figurine, Snite.jpg|upright|thumb|Olmec white ware "hollow baby" figurine, 
1000 -300 BC.]]
The Olmec culture was first defined as an art style, and this continues to be the hallmark of the culture.&lt;ref name="Coe 2002, p. 62"&gt;Coe (2002), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Wrought in a large number of media – jade, clay, basalt, and greenstone among others – much Olmec art, such as [[The Wrestler (sculpture)|''The Wrestler'']], is naturalistic. Other art expresses fantastic [[anthropomorphic]] creatures, often highly stylized, using an iconography reflective of a religious meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Coe (2002), p. 88 and others.&lt;/ref&gt; Common [[motif (art)|motifs]] include downturned mouths and a cleft head, both of which are seen in representations of [[Olmec were-jaguar|were-jaguars]].&lt;ref name="Coe 2002, p. 62"/&gt;

In addition to making human and human-like subjects, Olmec artisans were adept at animal portrayals; for example, the fish vessel to the right or the bird vessel in the [[Olmec#Gallery|gallery below]].

While [[Olmec figurine]]s are found abundantly in sites throughout the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Preclassic Era|Formative Period]], the stone monuments such as the colossal heads are the most recognizable feature of Olmec culture.&lt;ref&gt;Pool, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; These monuments can be divided into four classes:&lt;ref&gt;Pool, p. 106. Diehl, pp. 109–115.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Colossal heads (which can be up to {{cvt|3|m|0}} tall);
*Rectangular "altars" (more likely thrones) such as Altar 5 shown below;
*Free-standing in-the-round sculpture, such as the twins from [[El Azuzul]] or [[San Martin Pajapan Monument 1]]; and
*[[Stela]]e, such as La Venta Monument 19 above. The stelae form was generally introduced later than the colossal heads, altars, or free-standing sculptures. Over time, the stelae changed from simple representation of figures, such as Monument 19 or [[:Image:Olmec woman.jpg|La Venta Stela 1]], toward representations of historical events, particularly acts legitimizing rulers. This trend would culminate in post-Olmec monuments such as [[La Mojarra Stela 1]], which combines images of rulers with [[Mesoamerican writing systems|script]] and [[Mesoamerican Long Count calendar|calendar dates]].&lt;ref&gt;Pool, pp. 106–108, 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colossal heads===
{{Main|Olmec colossal heads}}
The most recognized aspect of the Olmec civilization are the enormous helmeted heads.&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; As no known pre-Columbian text explains them, these impressive monuments have been the subject of much speculation. Once theorized to be [[Mesoamerican ballgame|ballplayers]], it is now generally accepted that these heads are portraits of rulers, perhaps dressed as ballplayers.&lt;ref&gt;Pool, p. 118; Diehl, p. 112. Coe (2002), p. 69: "They wear headgear rather like American football helmets which probably served as protection in both war and in the ceremonial game played…throughout Mesoamerica."&lt;/ref&gt; Infused with individuality, no two heads are alike and the helmet-like headdresses are adorned with distinctive elements, suggesting personal or group symbols. Some have also speculated that Mesoamerican people believed that the soul, along with all of one's experiences and emotions, was contained inside the head.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grove, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seventeen colossal heads have been unearthed to date.&lt;ref&gt;Pool, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Estatuilla de Tuxtla.jpg|thumb|upright|Tuxtla statuette]]
The heads range in size from the Rancho La Cobata head, at {{cvt|3.4|m|ft}} high, to the pair at Tres Zapotes, at {{cvt|1.47|m|ftin}}. Scholars calculate that the largest heads weigh between {{convert|25|and|55|t|ST|lk=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;In particular, Williams and Heizer (p. 29) calculated the weight of San Lorenzo Colossal Head 1 at 25.3 [[short ton]]s, or 23 [[tonne]]s. See Scarre. pp. 271–274 for the "55 tonnes" weight.&lt;/ref&gt;

The heads were carved from single blocks or boulders of volcanic [[basalt]], found in the [[Sierra de Los Tuxtlas|Tuxtlas Mountains]]. The Tres Zapotes heads, for example, were sculpted from basalt found at the summit of Cerro el Vigía, at the western end of the Tuxtlas. The San Lorenzo and La Venta heads, on the other hand, were probably carved from the basalt of Cerro Cintepec, on the southeastern side,&lt;ref&gt;See Williams and Heizer for more detail.&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps at the nearby [[Llano del Jicaro]] workshop, and dragged or floated to their final destination dozens of miles away.&lt;ref&gt;Scarre. Pool, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been estimated that moving a colossal head required the efforts of 1,500 people for three to four months.&lt;ref name="Pool, p. 103" /&gt;

Some of the heads, and many other monuments, have been variously mutilated, buried and disinterred, reset in new locations and/or reburied. Some monuments, and at least two heads, were recycled or recarved, but it is not known whether this was simply due to the scarcity of stone or whether these actions had ritual or other connotations. Scholars believe that some mutilation had significance beyond mere destruction, but some scholars still do not rule out internal conflicts or, less likely, invasion as a factor.&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

The flat-faced, thick-lipped heads have caused some debate due to their resemblance to some African facial characteristics. Based on this comparison, some writers have said that the Olmecs were Africans who had emigrated to the New World.&lt;ref&gt;Wiercinski, A. (1972). "Inter-and Intrapopulational Racial Differentiation of Tlatilco, Cerro de Las Mesas, Teothuacan, Monte Alban and Yucatan Maya," ''XXXIX Congreso Intern. de Americanistas,'' Lima 1970, '''1''', 231–252.&lt;/ref&gt; But, the vast majority of archaeologists and other Mesoamerican scholars reject claims of pre-Columbian contacts with Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Taube]], for one, says "There simply is no material evidence of any Pre-Hispanic contact between the Old World and Mesoamerica before the arrival of the Spanish in the sixteenth century.", p. 17.

&lt;/ref&gt; Explanations for the facial features of the colossal heads include the possibility that the heads were carved in this manner due to the shallow space allowed on the basalt boulders. Others note that in addition to the broad noses and thick lips, the eyes of the heads often show the [[epicanthic fold]], and that all these characteristics can still be found in modern Mesoamerican Indians. For instance, in the 1940s, the artist/art historian [[Miguel Covarrubias]] published a series of photos of Olmec artworks and of the faces of modern [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|Mexican Indians]] with very similar facial characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;''Mexico South'', Covarrubias, 1946&lt;/ref&gt; The African origin hypothesis assumes that Olmec carving was intended to be a representation of the inhabitants, an assumption that is hard to justify given the full corpus of representation in Olmec carving.&lt;ref&gt;Ortiz de Montellano, et al. 1997, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ivan van Sertima]] claimed that the seven braids on the Tres Zapotes head was an Ethiopian hair style but he offered no evidence that this was an Ethiopian hair style at the appropriate time. The Egyptologist [[Frank Yurco]] has said that the Olmec braids do not resemble contemporary Egyptian or Nubian braids.&lt;ref&gt;Haslip-Viera, Gabriel: Bernard Ortiz de Montellano; Warren Barbour Source "Robbing Native American Cultures: Van Sertima's Afrocentricity and the Olmecs," ''Current Anthropology'', '''38''' (3), (Tun., 1997), pp. 419–441&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Diehl]] wrote "There can be no doubt that the heads depict the American Indian physical type still seen on the streets of Soteapan, Acayucan, and other towns in the region."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Olmecs: America's First Civilization|authorlink= Richard Diehl|last=Diehl|first=Richard A.|publisher=Thames and Hudson|year=2004|location=London|isbn=0-500-28503-9|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jade face masks===

Jade is a particularly precious material, and it was used as a mark of rank by the ruling classes.&lt;ref&gt;Milliken, William M. "Pre-Columbian Jade and Hard Stone." The Bulletin of the Cleveland Museum of Art 36, no. 4 (April 1949): 53–55. Accessed 17 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1500 BC early Olmec sculptors mastered the human form.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;Miller, Mary Ellen. "The Art of Mesoamerica From Olmec to Aztec." Thames &amp; Hudson; 4th edition (20 October 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; This can be determined by wooden Olmec sculptures discovered in the swampy bogs of El Manati.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt; Before radiocarbon dating could tell the exact age of Olmec pieces, archaeologists and art historians noticed the unique "Olmec-style" in a variety of artifacts.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt;

Curators and scholars refer to "Olmec-style" face masks but, to date, no example has been recovered in an archaeologically controlled Olmec context. They have been recovered from sites of other cultures, including one deliberately deposited in the ceremonial precinct of [[Tenochtitlan]] ([[Mexico City]]). The mask would presumably have been about 2,000 years old when the [[Aztec]] buried it, suggesting such masks were valued and collected as were Roman [[antiquities]] in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20080415091406/http://artworld.uea.ac.uk/cms/index.php?q=node/873 "University of East Anglia collections"], ''Artworld''&lt;/ref&gt; The "Olmec-style" refers to the combination of deep-set eyes, nostrils, and strong, slightly asymmetrical mouth.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt; The "Olmec-style" also very distinctly combines facial features of both humans and jaguars.&lt;ref name=Museum&gt; The British Museum. "Olmec Stone Mask." [https://smarthistory.org/olmec-stone-mask/ Smarthistory.com].&lt;/ref&gt; Olmec arts are strongly tied to the Olmec religion, which prominently featured Jaguars.&lt;ref name=Museum/&gt; The Olmecs believed that in the distant past a race of "Were-Jaguars" was made between the union of a jaguar and a woman.&lt;ref name=Museum/&gt; One ‘were-jaguar’ quality that can be found is the sharp cleft in the forehead of many supernatural beings in Olmec art. This sharp cleft is associated with the natural indented head of Jaguars.&lt;ref name=Museum/&gt;

=== Kunz Axes ===
The Kunz Axes (also known as "Votive Axes") are figures that represent [[werejaguar]]s. In most of the cases their head represents half of their volume. While they've always been referred to as "votive axes", the places where they were found and when we see them, it's very clear that they're used for rituals. All of the Kunz Axes have flat noses and open mouth.

[[File:Formative Era sites.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|The major Formative Period (Pre-Classic Era) sites in present-day Mexico which show Olmec influences in the archaeological record.]]

Olmec-style artifacts, designs, figurines, monuments and iconography have been found in the archaeological records of sites hundreds of kilometres outside the Olmec heartland. These sites include:&lt;ref&gt;See Pool, pp. 179–242; Diehl, pp. 126–151.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central Mexico===
[[Tlatilco]] and [[Tlapacoya (Mesoamerican site)|Tlapacoya]], major centers of the [[Tlatilco culture]] in the [[Valley of Mexico]], where artifacts include hollow [[Olmec figurine#Baby-face motif|baby-face motif]] figurines and Olmec designs on ceramics.

[[Chalcatzingo]], in Valley of [[Morelos]], central Mexico, which features Olmec-style monumental art and rock art with Olmec-style figures.

Also, in 2007, archaeologists unearthed [[Zazacatla]], an Olmec-influenced city in Morelos. Located about 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of Mexico City, Zazacatla covered about {{convert|1|sqmi|spell=in}} between 800 and 500&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Lovgren, [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/01/070126-mexico-olmec.html Ancient City Found in Mexico; Shows Olmec Influence.] National Geographic News, 26 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western Mexico===
[[Teopantecuanitlan]], in [[Guerrero]], which features Olmec-style monumental art as well as city plans with distinctive Olmec features.

Also, the [[Juxtlahuaca]] and [[Oxtotitlan]] cave paintings feature Olmec designs and motifs.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Diehl, p. 170 or Pool, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southern Mexico and Guatemala===
Olmec influence is also seen at several sites in the [[Southern Maya area]].

In Guatemala, sites showing probable Olmec influence include [[San Bartolo (Maya site)|San Bartolo]], [[Takalik Abaj]] and [[La Democracia, Escuintla|La Democracia]].

===Nature of interaction===
Many theories have been advanced to account for the occurrence of Olmec influence far outside the heartland, including long-range trade by Olmec merchants, Olmec colonization of other regions, Olmec artisans travelling to other cities, conscious imitation of Olmec artistic styles by developing towns – some even suggest the prospect of Olmec military domination or that the Olmec iconography was actually developed outside the heartland.&lt;ref&gt;Flannery et al. (2005) hint that Olmec iconography was first developed in the [[Tlatilco culture]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The generally accepted, but by no means unanimous, interpretation is that the Olmec-style artifacts, in all sizes, became associated with elite status and were adopted by non-Olmec Formative Period chieftains in an effort to bolster their status.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Reilly; Stevens (2007); Rose (2007). For a full discussion, see [[Olmec influences on Mesoamerican cultures]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable innovations==
In addition to their influence with contemporaneous [[List of pre-Columbian civilizations|Mesoamerican cultures]], as the first civilization in Mesoamerica, the Olmecs are credited, or speculatively credited, with many "firsts", including the [[Bloodletting in Mesoamerica|bloodletting]] and perhaps [[Mesoamerica#Human Sacrifice|human sacrifice]], writing and [[epigraphy]], and the invention of popcorn, [[0 (number)|zero]] and the [[Mesoamerican calendars|Mesoamerican calendar]], and the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]], as well as perhaps the [[compass]].&lt;ref&gt;See Carlson for details of the compass.&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers, including artist and [[art historian]] [[Miguel Covarrubias]], even postulate that the Olmecs formulated the forerunners of many of the later Mesoamerican [[deities]].&lt;ref&gt;Covarrubias, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bloodletting and sacrifice speculation===
[[File:La Venta Altar 5 (Ruben Charles).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Altar 5 from La Venta. The inert were-jaguar baby held by the central figure is seen by some as an indication of [[Child sacrifice in pre-Columbian cultures|child sacrifice]]. In contrast, [[:Image:Altar 5 from La Venta, left side (Ruben Charles).jpg|its sides show bas-reliefs of humans holding quite lively were-jaguar babies]].]]

Although the archaeological record does not include explicit representation of Olmec [[Bloodletting in Mesoamerica|bloodletting]],&lt;ref&gt;Taube (2004), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; researchers have found other evidence that the Olmec ritually practiced it. For example, numerous natural and ceramic [[stingray]] spikes and [[Agave americana|maguey]] [[spine (botany)|thorn]]s have been found at Olmec sites,&lt;ref&gt;As one example, see Joyce ''et al.'', "Olmec Bloodletting: An Iconographic Study".&lt;/ref&gt; and certain artifacts have been identified as bloodletters.&lt;ref&gt;See Taube (2004), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument that the Olmec instituted human sacrifice is significantly more speculative. No Olmec or Olmec-influenced sacrificial artifacts have yet been discovered; no Olmec or Olmec-influenced artwork unambiguously shows sacrificial victims (as do the ''danzante'' figures of [[Monte Albán]]) or scenes of human sacrifice (such as can be seen in [[:Image:El Tajin Ballcourt Mural (Tom Aleto).jpg|the famous ballcourt mural]] from [[El Tajin]]).&lt;ref&gt;Pool, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[El Manatí]] site, disarticulated skulls and femurs, as well as the complete skeletons of newborn or unborn children, have been discovered amidst the other offerings, leading to speculation concerning infant sacrifice. Scholars have not determined how the infants met their deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Ortiz et al., p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors have associated infant sacrifice with Olmec ritual art showing limp [[Olmec were-jaguar|were-jaguar]] babies, most famously in La Venta's [[La Venta#Altars 4 &amp; 5|Altar 5]] (on the right) or [[Las Limas Monument 1|Las Limas figure]].&lt;ref&gt;Pool, p. 116. Joralemon (1996), p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; Any definitive answer requires further findings.

===Writing===
{{See also|Cascajal block}}
The Olmec may have been the first civilization in the [[Western Hemisphere]] to develop a writing system. Symbols found in 2002 and 2006 date from 650&amp;nbsp;BCE&lt;ref&gt;See Pohl et al. (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; and 900&amp;nbsp;BCE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Writing May Be Oldest in Western Hemisphere. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/15/science/15writing.html |quote=A stone slab bearing 3,000-year-old writing previously unknown to scholars has been found in the Mexican state of Veracruz, and archaeologists say it is an example of the oldest script ever discovered in the Americas. |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date= 15 September 2006|accessdate=2008-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively, preceding the oldest [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] writing found so far, which dates from about 500&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Oldest' New World writing found |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5347080.stm |quote=Ancient civilisations in Mexico developed a writing system as early as 900 BC, new evidence suggests. |publisher=[[BBC]] |date= 14 September 2006|accessdate=2008-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Oldest Writing in the New World |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/313/5793/1610 |quote=A block with a hitherto unknown system of writing has been found in the Olmec heartland of Veracruz, Mexico.

The 2002 find at the [[San Andrés (Mesoamerican site)|San Andrés]] site shows a bird, speech scrolls, and glyphs that are similar to the later [[Mayan hieroglyphs]].&lt;ref&gt;Pohl et al. (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Known as the [[Cascajal Block]], and dated between 1100&amp;nbsp;BCE and 900&amp;nbsp;BCE, the 2006 find from a site near San Lorenzo shows a set of 62 symbols, 28 of which are unique, carved on a [[Serpentine group|serpentine]] block. A large number of prominent archaeologists have hailed this find as the "earliest pre-Columbian writing".&lt;ref&gt;Skidmore. These prominent proponents include [[Michael D. Coe]], [[Richard A. Diehl]], [[Karl Taube]], and [[Stephen D. Houston]].&lt;/ref&gt; Others are skeptical because of the stone's singularity, the fact that it had been removed from any archaeological context, and because it bears no apparent resemblance to any other [[Mesoamerican writing system]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruhns, et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also well-documented later hieroglyphs known as "[[Epi-Olmec script|Epi-Olmec]]", and while there are some who believe that Epi-Olmec may represent a transitional script between an earlier Olmec writing system and [[Maya script|Mayan writing]], the matter remains unsettled.

===Mesoamerican Long Count calendar and invention of the zero concept===
[[File:Estela C de Tres Zapotes.jpg|thumb|upright|'''The back of Stela C from [[Tres Zapotes]]'''&lt;br&gt;This is the second oldest Long Count date yet discovered. The numerals 7.16.6.16.18 translate to 3 September 32&amp;nbsp;BCE (Julian). The glyphs surrounding the date are one of the few surviving examples of [[Epi-Olmec script]].&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Tumba Olmeca.jpg|thumb|Olmec tomb at La Venta Park, [[Villahermosa]], [[Tabasco]].]]

{{See also|0 (number)#History|l1=History of zero}}

The [[Mesoamerican Long Count calendar|Long Count calendar]] used by many subsequent Mesoamerican civilizations, as well as the concept of [[zero (number)|zero]], may have been devised by the Olmecs. Because the six artifacts with the earliest Long Count calendar dates were all discovered outside the immediate Maya homeland, it is likely that this calendar predated the Maya and was possibly the invention of the Olmecs. Indeed, three of these six artifacts were found within the Olmec heartland. But an argument against an Olmec origin is the fact that the Olmec civilization had ended by the 4th century&amp;nbsp;BCE, several centuries before the earliest known Long Count date artifact.&lt;ref&gt;"Mesoamerican Long Count calendar &amp; invention of the zero concept" section cited to Diehl, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Long Count calendar required the use of zero as a place-holder within its [[vigesimal]] (base-20) positional numeral system. A shell glyph –[[File:MAYA-g-num-0-inc-v1.svg]] – was used as a zero symbol for these Long Count dates, the second oldest of which, on Stela C at [[Tres Zapotes]], has a date of 32&amp;nbsp;BCE. This is one of the earliest uses of the zero concept in history.&lt;ref&gt;Haughton, p. 153. The earliest recovered Long Count dated is from Monument 1 in the [[Maya Civilization|Maya]] site [[El Baúl]], [[Guatemala]], bearing a date of 37&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mesoamerican ballgame===
The Olmec are strong candidates for originating the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]] so prevalent among later cultures of the region and used for recreational and religious purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Taube (1993) p. 42. Pool, p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; A dozen rubber balls dating to 1600&amp;nbsp;BCE or earlier have been found in [[El Manatí]], a [[bog]] {{convert|10|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} east of San Lorenzo Tenochtitlan.&lt;ref&gt;Ortiz C.&lt;/ref&gt; These balls predate the earliest ballcourt yet discovered at [[Paso de la Amada]], [[circa]] 1400&amp;nbsp;BCE, although there is no certainty that they were used in the ballgame.&lt;ref&gt;See Filloy Nadal, p. 27, who says "If they [the balls] were used in the ballgame, we would be looking at the earliest evidence of this practice".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethnicity and language==
While the actual ethno-linguistic affiliation of the Olmec remains unknown, various hypotheses have been put forward. For example, in 1968 [[Michael D. Coe]] speculated that the Olmec were Mayan predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;Coe (1968) p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, linguists [[Lyle Campbell]] and [[Terrence Kaufman]] published a paper in which they argued a core number of loanwords had apparently spread from a [[Mixe–Zoque languages|Mixe–Zoquean language]] into many other [[Mesoamerican languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell &amp; Kaufman (1976), pp. 80–89. For example, the words for "incense", "cacao", "corn", many names of various fruits, "nagual/shaman", "tobacco", "adobe", "ladder", "rubber", "corn granary", "squash/gourd", and "paper" in many Mesoamerican languages seem to have been borrowed from an ancient Mixe–Zoquean language.&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell and Kaufman proposed that the presence of these core loanwords indicated that the Olmec – generally regarded as the first "highly civilized" Mesoamerican society – spoke a language ancestral to Mixe–Zoquean. The spread of this vocabulary particular to their culture accompanied the diffusion of other Olmec cultural and artistic traits that appears in the archaeological record of other Mesoamerican societies.

Mixe–Zoque specialist [[Søren Wichmann]] first critiqued this theory on the basis that most of the Mixe–Zoquean loans seemed to originate only from the Zoquean branch of the family. This implied the loanword transmission occurred in the period ''after'' the two branches of the language family split, placing the time of the borrowings outside of the Olmec period.&lt;ref&gt;Wichmann (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; However, new evidence has pushed back the proposed date for the split of Mixean and Zoquean languages to a period within the Olmec era.&lt;ref name="Wichmann, Beliaev 2008"&gt;Wichmann, Beliaev &amp; Davletshin, (in press Sep 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this dating, the architectural and archaeological patterns and the particulars of the vocabulary loaned to other Mesoamerican languages from Mixe–Zoquean, Wichmann now suggests that the Olmecs of San Lorenzo spoke proto-Mixe and the Olmecs of La Venta spoke proto-Zoque.&lt;ref name="Wichmann, Beliaev 2008"/&gt;

At least the fact that the Mixe–Zoquean languages are still spoken in an area corresponding roughly to the [[Olmec heartland]], and are historically known to have been spoken there, leads most scholars to assume that the Olmec spoke one or more Mixe–Zoquean languages.&lt;ref&gt;See Pool, p.&amp;nbsp;6, or Diehl, p.&amp;nbsp;85.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion and mythology==
{{Main|Olmec religion}}
[[File:Señor de las limas 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Las Limas Monument 1]], considered an important realisation of Olmec mythology. The youth holds a were-jaguar infant, while four iconic supernaturals are incised on the youth's shoulders and knees.]]
[[File:Olmec King.jpg|thumb|upright|Olmec Chief or King. Relief from [[La Venta]] Archaeological Site in [[Tabasco]].]]
Olmec religious activities were performed by a combination of rulers, full-time priests, and [[shaman]]s. The rulers seem to have been the most important religious figures, with their links to the Olmec deities or supernaturals providing legitimacy for their rule.&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, p. 106. See also J. E. Clark, p. 343, who says "much of the art of La Venta appears to have been dedicated to rulers who dressed as gods, or to the gods themselves".&lt;/ref&gt; There is also considerable evidence for shamans in the Olmec archaeological record, particularly in the so-called "[[Olmec figurine#Transformation figures|transformation figures]]".&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Olmec mythology has left no documents comparable to the [[Popul Vuh]] from [[Maya mythology]], any exposition of Olmec mythology must be based on interpretations of surviving monumental and portable art (such as the Las Limas figure at right), and comparisons with other Mesoamerican mythologies. Olmec art shows that such deities as the [[Feathered Serpent (deity)|Feathered Serpent]] and a rain supernatural were already in the Mesoamerican pantheon in Olmec times.&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, pp. 103–104.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social and political organization==
Little is directly known about the societal or political structure of Olmec society. Although it is assumed by most researchers that the colossal heads and several other sculptures represent rulers, nothing has been found like the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] [[stelae]] ([[:Image:Catherwood stela d.jpg|see drawing]]) which name specific rulers and provide the dates of their rule.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Cyphers (1996), p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, archaeologists relied on the data that they had, such as large- and small-scale site surveys. These provided evidence of considerable centralization within the Olmec region, first at San Lorenzo and then at La Venta – no other Olmec sites come close to these in terms of area or in the quantity and quality of architecture and sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;See Santley, et al., p.4, for a discussion of Mesoamerican centralization and decentralization. See Cyphers (1999) for a discussion of the meaning of monument placement.&lt;/ref&gt;

This evidence of geographic and demographic centralization leads archaeologists to propose that Olmec society itself was hierarchical, concentrated first at San Lorenzo and then at La Venta, with an elite that was able to use their control over materials such as water and monumental stone to exert command and legitimize their regime.&lt;ref&gt;See Cyphers (1999) for a more detailed discussion.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, Olmec society is thought to lack many of the institutions of later civilizations, such as a standing army or priestly caste.&lt;ref&gt;Serra Puche et al., p. 36, who argue that "While Olmec art sometimes represents leaders, priests, and possibly soldiers, it is difficult to imagine that such institutions as the army, priest caste, or administrative-political groups were already fully developed by Olmec times." They go on to downplay the possibility of a strong central government.&lt;/ref&gt; And there is no evidence that San Lorenzo or La Venta controlled, even during their heyday, all of the Olmec heartland.&lt;ref&gt;Pool, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; There is some doubt, for example, that La Venta controlled even Arroyo Sonso, only some {{convert|35|km|abbr=on}} away.&lt;ref&gt;Pool, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of the Tuxtla Mountain settlements, some {{convert|60|km|abbr=on}} away, indicate that this area was composed of more or less egalitarian communities outside the control of lowland centers.&lt;ref&gt;Pool, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trade==
The wide diffusion of Olmec artifacts and "Olmecoid" iconography throughout much of Mesoamerica indicates the existence of extensive long-distance trade networks. Exotic, prestigious and high-value materials such as [[greenstone (archaeology)|greenstone]] and marine shell were moved in significant quantities across large distances. Some of the reasons for trade revolve around the lack of obsidian in the heartland. The Olmec used obsidian in many tools because worked edges were very sharp and durable. Most of the obsidian found has been traced back to Guatemala showing the extensive trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www-sciencedirect-com.libproxy.mst.edu/science/article/pii/S0305440313000563|title=Early Olmec obsidian trade and economic organization at San Lorenz|last=Hirth|first=Kenneth|date=June 2013|website=Journey of Archeological Science|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Olmec were not the first in Mesoamerica to organize long-distance exchanges of goods, the Olmec period saw a significant expansion in interregional trade routes, more variety in material goods exchanged and a greater diversity in the sources from which the base materials were obtained.

==Village life and diet==
Despite their size and deliberate urban design, which was copied by other centers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chiapadecorzo.byu.edu/ |title=Chiapa de Corzo Archaeological Project |accessdate=2012-03-18 |publisher=[[Brigham Young University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; San Lorenzo and La Venta were largely ceremonial centers, and the majority of the Olmec lived in villages similar to present-day villages and hamlets in Tabasco and Veracruz.&lt;ref&gt;Except where otherwise (foot)noted, this '''Village life and diet''' section is referenced to Diehl (2004), Davies, and Pope et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

These villages were located on higher ground and consisted of several scattered houses. A modest temple may have been associated with the larger villages. The individual dwellings would consist of a house, an associated lean-to, and one or more storage pits (similar in function to a [[root cellar]]). A nearby garden was used for medicinal and cooking herbs and for smaller crops, such as the domesticated [[sunflower]]. Fruit trees, such as [[avocado]] or [[Theobroma cacao|cacao]], were probably available nearby.

Although the river banks were used to plant crops between flooding periods, the Olmecs probably also practiced [[swidden]] (or slash-and-burn) agriculture to clear the forests and shrubs, and to provide new fields once the old fields were exhausted.&lt;ref&gt;Pohl.&lt;/ref&gt; Fields were located outside the village, and were used for maize, beans, [[Cucurbitaceae|squash]], [[manioc]], and sweet potato. Based on archaeological studies of two villages in the Tuxtlas Mountains, it is known that maize cultivation became increasingly important to the Olmec over time, although the diet remained fairly diverse.&lt;ref&gt;VanDerwarker, p. 195, and Lawler, ''Archaeology'' (2007), p. 23, quoting VanDerwarker.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fruits and vegetables were supplemented with fish, turtle, snake, and mollusks from the nearby rivers, and crabs and shellfish in the coastal areas. Birds were available as food sources, as were game including [[peccary]], [[opossum]], [[raccoon]], rabbit, and in particular, [[deer]].&lt;ref&gt;VanDerwarker, pp. 141–144.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the wide range of hunting and fishing available, [[midden]] surveys in San Lorenzo have found that the domesticated dog was the single most plentiful source of animal protein.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of archaeological research==
[[File:Kunz Axe.jpg|upright|thumb|Kunz Axe; 1000-400 BC; [[jadeite]]; height: 31 cm (12{{fraction|3|16}} in.), width 16 cm (6{{fraction|5|16}} in.), 11 cm (4{{fraction|5|16}} in.); [[American Museum of Natural History]] ([[Washington D.C.]], USA).

At a height of {{cvt|11|in|cm|0|order=flip}}, it is one of the largest jade objects ever found in Mesoamerica.&lt;ref&gt;Benson (1996) p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Olmec culture was unknown to historians until the mid-19th century. In 1869, the Mexican antiquarian traveller [[José Melgar y Serrano]] published a description of the first Olmec monument to have been found ''[[in situ]]''. This monument&amp;nbsp;– the colossal head now labelled [[Tres Zapotes Monument A]]&amp;nbsp;– had been discovered in the late 1850s by a farm worker clearing forested land on a ''[[hacienda]]'' in Veracruz. Hearing about the curious find while travelling through the region, Melgar y Serrano first visited the site in 1862 to see for himself and complete the partially exposed sculpture's excavation. His description of the object, published several years later after further visits to the site, represents the earliest documented report of an artifact of what is now known as the Olmec culture.&lt;ref&gt;See translated excerpt from Melgar y Serrano's original 1869 report, reprinted in Adams (1991), p. 56. See also Pool (2007), pp. 1, 35 and Stirling (1968), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the latter half of the 19th century, Olmec artifacts such as the Kunz Axe (right) came to light and were subsequently recognized as belonging to a unique artistic tradition.

[[Frans Blom]] and [[Oliver La Farge]] made the first detailed descriptions of [[La Venta]] and [[San Martin Pajapan Monument 1]] during their 1925 expedition. However, at this time, most archaeologists assumed the Olmec were contemporaneous with the Maya&amp;nbsp;– even Blom and La Farge were, in their own words, "inclined to ascribe them to the Maya culture".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Coe (1968), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Matthew Stirling]] of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] conducted the first detailed scientific excavations of Olmec sites in the 1930s and 1940s. Stirling, along with art historian [[Miguel Covarrubias]], became convinced that the Olmec predated most other known Mesoamerican civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;Coe (1968), pp. 42–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

In counterpoint to Stirling, [[Miguel Covarrubias|Covarrubias]], and [[Alfonso Caso]], however, Mayanists [[J. Eric S. Thompson|J. Eric Thompson]] and [[Sylvanus Morley]] argued for Classic-era dates for the Olmec artifacts. The question of Olmec chronology came to a head at a 1942 [[Tuxtla Gutierrez]] conference, where Alfonso Caso declared that the Olmecs were the "mother culture" ("''cultura madre''") of Mesoamerica.&lt;ref&gt;"Esta gran cultura, que encontramos en niveles antiguos, es sin duda madre de otras culturas, como la maya, la teotihuacana, la zapoteca, la de El Tajín, y otras" ("This great culture, which we encounter in ancient levels, is without a doubt mother of other cultures, like the Maya, the Teotihuacana, the Zapotec, that of El Tajin, and others".) Caso (1942), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the conference, [[radiocarbon dating]] proved the antiquity of the Olmec civilization, although the "mother culture" question generated considerable debate even 60 years later.&lt;ref&gt;Coe (1968), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology===
The name "Olmec" means "rubber people" in [[Nahuatl]], the language of the [[Aztec]], and was the Aztec name for the people who lived in the Gulf Lowlands in the 15th and 16th centuries, some 2000 years after the Olmec culture died out. The term "rubber people" refers to the ancient practice, spanning from ancient Olmecs to Aztecs, of extracting [[latex]] from ''[[Castilla elastica]]'', a [[rubber tree]] in the area. The juice of a local vine, ''[[Ipomoea alba]],'' was then mixed with this latex to create rubber as early as 1600&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref name = "MIT"&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/org/m/materialculture/www/rubberprocessing.html Rubber Processing], MIT.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early modern explorers and archaeologists, however, mistakenly applied the name "Olmec" to the rediscovered ruins and artifacts in the heartland decades before it was understood that these were not created by the people the Aztecs knew as the "Olmec", but rather a culture that was 2000 years older. Despite the mistaken identity, the name has stuck.&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not known what name the ancient Olmec used for themselves; some later Mesoamerican accounts seem to refer to the ancient Olmec as "[[Tamoanchan]]".&lt;ref&gt;Coe (2002) refers to an old Nahuatl poem cited by [[Miguel Leon-Portilla]], which itself refers to a land called "Tamoanchan":&lt;blockquote&gt;in a certain era&lt;br /&gt;which no one can reckon&lt;br /&gt;which no one can remember&lt;br /&gt;[where] there was a government for a long time".&lt;/blockquote&gt; Coe interprets Tamoanchan as a Mayan language word meaning 'Land of Rain or Mist' (p. 61).&lt;/ref&gt; A contemporary term sometimes used for the Olmec culture is ''tenocelome'', meaning "mouth of the [[jaguar]]".&lt;ref&gt;The term "tenocelome" is used as early as 1967 by [[George Kubler]] in ''American Anthropologist'', v. 69, p. 404.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative origin speculations==
{{main|Olmec alternative origin speculations}}
{{see also|Pre-Columbian Africa-Americas contact theories}}
Partly because the Olmecs developed the first Mesoamerican civilization, and partly because little is known of them (compared with, for example, to the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] or [[Aztec]]), a number of Olmec alternative origin speculations have been put forth. Although several of these speculations, particularly the theory that the Olmecs were of African origin popularized by [[Ivan van Sertima]]'s book ''They Came Before Columbus'', have become well-known within popular culture. They are not considered credible by the vast majority of Mesoamerican researchers and scientists, who discard it as pop-culture pseudo-science.&lt;ref&gt;See Grove (1976) or Ortiz de Montellano (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

An opinion which originated in the [[Peripatetic school]] is that ''onomasti komodein'' was the fundamental characterizing aspect of the [[ancient Greek comedy]] of the first period (known as ''[[Old Comedy]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Mastromarco 1994 pp.21-22&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18756">The '''open–closed''' [[political spectrum]], or '''horseshoe theory''' is an alternative to the standard [[Left–right politics|left–right system]], especially used to describe the [[Cleavage (politics)|cleavage]] in political systems in Europe and North America in the 21st century. In this system, parties and voters are arranged on an axis from open ([[social liberalism|socially liberal]] and [[globalist]]) to closed ([[cultural conservatism|culturally conservative]] and [[protectionist]]). Each side draws from both traditionally left- and right-wing ideas and values: "closed" parties usually hold conventionally right-wing views on social issues but may support the left-wing policies of [[market intervention]] and [[redistribution of wealth]], while open parties can hold left-wing or progressive opinions on many issues but be staunchly in favour of the traditionally more rightist policies of [[free trade]]. Depending on context, open–closed can be a replacement to left–right or a second axis on a [[political compass]].&lt;ref name="Davos"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/will-politics-open-closed-replace-left-versus-right-1606328|title=Will the politics of 'open and closed' replace 'left versus right'?|date=13 February 2017|accessdate=9 May 2017|newspaper=International Business Times|first=James|last=Bloodworth}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ID"/&gt;

A [[Realigning election|political realignment]] along these lines across the [[Western world]] has been described by political scientists in the wake of the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]], the [[Great Recession]] and the [[European migrant crisis]], with mainstream left-wing and right-wing political parties shifting or falling behind [[populism|populist]] parties and [[independent (politics)|independents]]. Examples of votes described as having been fought on open-closed lines include the [[UK EU membership referendum, 2016|2016 Brexit referendum]], presidential elections in [[Austrian presidential election, 2016|Austria in 2016]], [[United States presidential election, 2016|the United States in 2016]] and [[French presidential election, 2017|France in 2017]], and general elections in [[Polish parliamentary election, 2015|Poland in 2015]] and [[Dutch general election, 2017|the Netherlands in 2017]].&lt;ref name="Drawbridges"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21702748-new-divide-rich-countries-not-between-left-and-right-between-open-and|title=Drawbridges up|newspaper=The Economist|date=30 July 2016|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://france-amerique.com/a-new-political-spectrum/|title=A New Political Spectrum|date=25 April 2017|accessdate=8 May 2017|first=Guy|last=Sorman|translator-first=Alexis|translator-last=Cornel|website=France-Amérique}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Coming"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/01/opinion/the-coming-political-realignment.html|title=The Coming Political Realignment|date=1 July 2016|first=David|last=Brooks|newspaper=New York Times|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precursors and terminology==
[[File:Political spectrum horseshoe model.svg|thumb|The horseshoe theory states that extreme left and right have more in common with each other than the centre.|upright=1.2]]
Prior to the development of [[socialism]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the primary divide in British politics was between [[classical liberalism]] ([[Whiggism]]) and [[traditional conservatism]] ([[Toryism]]) as seen in debates about free trade and the [[Corn Laws]], and James Kirkup, writing in the ''Daily Telegraph'', has suggested that the open-closed split marks a return to this era of politics.&lt;ref name="TTIP"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/11296902/From-immigration-to-trade-and-the-NHS-politics-is-about-open-vs-closed.html|title=From immigration to trade and the NHS, politics is about open vs closed|date=17 December 2014|accessdate=8 May 2017|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|first=James|last=Kirkup}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the rise of the socially-liberal [[New Left]] and socially-conservative [[Christian right|religious right]] in the 1970s, and the subsequent "[[culture war]]s", marked the beginning the open-closed cleavage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bornschier |first=Simon |last2=Kriesi |first2=Hanspeter |editor-last=Rydgren |editor-first=Jens |title=Class Politics and the Radical Right |publisher=Routledge |date=2012 |pages=10–29 |chapter=The populist right, the working class, and the changing face of class politics}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fareed Zakaria]], writing in the ''Washington Post'', described the [[Nordic model]] of free market social democracy as another early example of open politics.&lt;ref name="Armed"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-politics-of-the-future-be-open-and-armed/2016/07/07/fd171ce0-447b-11e6-8856-f26de2537a9d_story.html|title=The politics of the future: Be open and armed|date=7 July 2016|accessdate=8 May 2017|newspaper=Washington Post|first=Fareed|last=Zakaria}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Stephan Shakespeare]], director of public opinion research at [[YouGov]], identified the divide in an analysis of the party positions in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 UK general election]], but termed closed and open voters "drawbridge up" and "drawbridge down" respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/apr/17/uk.election20054|title=They seem to be campaigning for the sake of it|first=Stephan|last=Shakespeare|authorlink=Stephan Shakespeare|newspaper=The Guardian|date=17 April 2005|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms "open" and "closed" for this divide were first used by then-British prime minister [[Tony Blair]] in 2006, with reference to the [[horseshoe theory]] that far-left and far-right politics are similar in substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2016/11/tony-blair-s-unfinished-business|title=Tony Blair’s unfinished business|first=Jason|last=Cowley|newspaper=New Statesman|date=24 November 2016|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blair, who declared himself staunchly for "open", had overseen the development of the [[Third Way]] [[New Labour]] movement in 1990s and the schism in the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] between "open" Blairites and "closed" traditional socialists has remained.&lt;ref name="Armed"/&gt; Political analyst [[James Bloodworth (journalist)|James Bloodworth]] criticised Blair's choice of terminology, describing "closed" as pejorative to those threatened by globalism and "open" as overly laudatory of the "[[Davos Man]]" type of globalist.&lt;ref name="Davos"/&gt;

==Rise and development==
[[File:Angela Merkel Donald Trump 2017-03-17 (cropped).png|thumb|left|Although both are conservatives, the "open" [[Angela Merkel]] and "closed" [[Donald Trump]] fall at opposite ends of the spectrum.&lt;ref name="FA"/&gt;|alt=Merkel and Trump at a press conference together.|upright=1.2]]
Following the financial crisis and subsequent recession, plus the arrival of large numbers of [[refugees of the Syrian Civil War]], populist political parties made significant gains across the European Union. In southern European countries, these tended to be [[Anti-austerity movement|anti-austerity]] left-wing parties such as [[Syriza]] in Greece and [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]] in Spain, while northern European countries saw [[anti-immigrant]] right-wing parties such as the [[UK Independence Party]] and the [[Alternative for Germany]] gain support.&lt;ref name="Drawbridges"/&gt; However all these parties shared a [[Eurosceptic]] and [[anti-establishment|anti-elite]] viewpoint, and appealed to the "left-behind" who saw their livelihoods or communities as threatened by globalism and immigration. [[Greek legislative election, January 2015|In 2015]], Syriza became the largest party in the [[Parliament of Greece]], while the right-wing populist [[Law and Justice]] became the first party since the fall of Communism to win an [[absolute majority]] in the Polish [[Sejm]] in [[Polish parliamentary election, 2015|elections the same year]].&lt;ref name="Drawbridges"/&gt; At the [[2016 UK EU membership referendum]], the Leave option narrowly defeated the [[bipartisanship|cross-party]] Remain option. The subsequent realignment of British politics saw the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], aligned with "Leave", and [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], aligned with "Remain", rise in the polls while Labour, which remained deeply divided between its open and closed wings, lost ground rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishelectionstudy.com/bes-findings/has-brexit-broken-british-voting/|title=Has Brexit Broken British Voting?|website=[[British Election Study]]|date=21 April 2017|accessdate=8 May 2017|first1=Jon|last1=Mellon|first2=Chris|last2=Prosser}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar political developments followed in the United States in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee [[Hillary Clinton]], liberal and pro-globalism, faced two political opponents who both represented protectionist viewpoints from opposite ends of the left–right spectrum: [[Bernie Sanders]], a [[democratic socialist]] who challenged her in the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016|primaries]], and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee [[Donald Trump]], running on a [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] "[[America First (policy)|America First]]" platform.&lt;ref name="Coming"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newdivide"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21702750-farewell-left-versus-right-contest-matters-now-open-against-closed-new|title=The new political divide|date=30 July 2016|accessdate=8 May 2017|newspaper=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump eventually triumphed, winning several [[Rust Belt]] states from the "[[Blue wall (politics)|Blue Wall]]" of Democratic [[safe state]]s which had suffered [[deindustrialisation]] and economic deprivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/11/09/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-blue-wall|title=Trump stomps all over the Democrats' Blue Wall|publisher=CNN|date=9 November 2016|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While "closed" politicians scored several electoral victories, another realignment in the [[political centre]] began in Europe, as [[cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] [[pro-Europeanism|pro-European]] voters abandoned traditional [[Major party|parties of government]] and clustered around new liberal parties and independent politicians. In the Netherlands, where the closed anti-Islam and anti-European [[Party for Freedom]] (PVV) under [[Geert Wilders]] led [[Opinion polling for the Dutch general election, 2017|opinion polls]] for much of the previous parliament, the liberal pro-EU [[Democrats 66]] and the [[green politics|green]] [[GroenLinks]] positioned themselves as the main open opponents of the PVV. At the [[Dutch general election, 2017|2017 elections]], all three parties made significant gains at the expense of the established parties.&lt;ref name="ID"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21718921-identity-does-not-have-be-exclusive-preserve-far-right-dutch-election-suggests|title=The Dutch election suggests a new kind of identity politics|date=18 March 2017|accessdate=8 May 2017|newspaper=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Van der Bellen]], an independent formerly of [[The Greens – The Green Alternative|The Greens]], defeated the anti-immigrant [[Norbert Hofer]] of the [[Freedom Party of Austria]] in the [[Austrian presidential election, 2016|2016 Austrian presidential election]], while [[Emmanuel Macron]], a former member of the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialists]] who described himself as "neither left nor right" and who founded his own party [[En Marche]], defeated the [[Front National (France)|Front National]] candidate [[Marine Le Pen]] in the [[French presidential election, 2017|2017 French presidential election]]. In both cases, neither of the mainstream parties of left and right reached the [[Two-round system|second round of voting]] – instead, each election saw an open centrist independent against a closed [[far-right politics|far-right]] party.&lt;ref name="Drawbridges"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ID"/&gt;

==Open and closed policies==
Although they can come from all sides of the left–right spectrum, closed parties share common ground on many issues, as likewise do open parties.

===Immigration and social integration===
Opposition to immigration is one of the starkest divides between open and closed parties. The closed position supports restrictions on migration, and prefers that immigrants [[Social integration|integrate]] into the national culture. By contrast, the open position takes a more liberal stance on migration, and tolerates or even celebrates [[multiculturalism]].&lt;ref name="Drawbridges"/&gt; Both left-wing and right-wing parties can be closed on the topic of immigration: the conservative Polish Law and Justice accuses immigrants of undermining Polish values and bringing in terrorists, while the socialist German [[Left Party (Germany)|Left Party]] considers immigrants a drain on the [[welfare state]].&lt;ref name="Drawbridges"/&gt;{{Not in source|date=February 2018}} Conversely, in the United Kingdom for example the [[Adam Smith Institute]] (a [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] right-wing organisation) and [[Vince Cable]] (a left-wing [[social democrat]] and former [[Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy|business secretary]]) stand together as some of the strongest defenders of immigration.&lt;ref name="TTIP"/&gt;

===Trade and economic integration===
Issues of [[international trade]] and [[international cooperation]] are another significant line of division between the two camps. In the open ideology, free trade and globalism is a net good, strengthening the national economy and providing jobs while cutting prices. In the closed ideology, free trade is detrimental to the national economy and encourages companies to [[offshoring|offshore]] industries, resulting in lower wages and higher unemployment, as well as potentially threatening national culture.&lt;ref name="Drawbridges"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Coming"/&gt; The closed attitude to globalism manifests in opposition to trade agreements such as the [[Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership]], to [[military alliance]]s such as [[NATO]], and to [[supranational union]]s such as the EU, which are generally supported by the open side.&lt;ref name="newdivide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TTIP"/&gt;

===Elites and anti-establishmentism===
Pro-closed politicians opposing free trade and immigration usually describe these as impositions from an existing political [[elite]], either within the country or outside its borders, and campaign on an [[anti-establishment]] platform. In the most extreme case, this can cross over into [[conspiracism]], alleging that shadowy figures are actively trying to harm the nation.&lt;ref name="Drawbridges"/&gt;

===Identity===
[[Identity politics]] plays a role in forming both the open and closed coalitions. Pro-closed voters tend to have a strong sense of [[national identity]], while pro-open ones share a more cosmopolitan identity. This does not mean that all closed voters are racist, nor that all open voters are unpatriotic. Nationalist pride can be enhanced by the arrival of newcomers, if these [[cultural assimilation|assimilate]] to the national culture quickly.&lt;ref name="Drawbridges"/&gt; Conversely some open politicians, such as [[Jesse Klaver]], leader of GroenLinks, and Emmanuel Macron, have succeeded in developing a patriotic alternative to nationalism in which tolerance and cooperation are themselves considered national values to be prized and protected.&lt;ref name="ID"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/bd6cc7da-2a75-11e7-bc4b-5528796fe35c|title=Emmanuel Macron offers the patriotic antidote to nationalism |date=27 April 2017|accessdate=9 May 2017|newspaper=Financial Times|first=Philip|last=Stephens}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics of cleavage==
Political scientists have identified several lines of cleavage between supporters of open and closed parties. [[Educational attainment]] was the strongest predictor of voting preference in the Brexit referendum and the 2016/2017 US, Dutch and French elections: in each case, those with low educational achievement were more likely to vote for the closed or populist option.&lt;ref name="MacronCharts"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/62d782d6-31a7-11e7-9555-23ef563ecf9a|title=French election results: Macron’s victory in charts|date=8 May 2017|accessdate=8 May 2017|first1=John|last1=Burn-Murdoch|first2=Billy|last2=Ehrenberg-Shannon|first3=Aleksandra|last3=Wisniewska|first4=Aendrew|last4=Rininsland|newspaper=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was described by the BBC as "one of the most remarkable features of the US election", as the Republican party usually performs well among university graduates.&lt;ref name="Revolt"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-37943072|title=US election 2016: The Trump-Brexit voter revolt|first=John|last=Curtice|authorlink=John Curtice|website=BBC News|date=11 November 2016|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Income has been suggested as another dividing line: in the EU referendum, the bottom fifth of UK earners overwhelmingly voted for Brexit (68% Leave, 32% Remain) while a large majority of the top quarter voted against Brexit (39% Leave, 61% Remain). However, Trump performed better with middle class voters than with either the highest or lowest earners and, although a small wealth effect was seen among French voters, this disappeared when [[Controlling for a variable|controlling for]] education.&lt;ref name="MacronCharts"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Revolt"/&gt;

[[Pessimism]] and [[optimism]] also appear to be important psychological factors in determining whether a voter chooses an open or a closed candidate. Le Pen only took 20% of the vote of those who believed the situation would improve for the next generation, but over 40% among those who believed it would deteriorate.&lt;ref name="MacronCharts"/&gt; A majority of Leave voters agreed life in Britain is worse than it was thirty years ago, while a majority of Remain voters disagreed.&lt;ref name="Drawbridges"/&gt;

'''Charles Patrick Wormald''' (9 July 1947 – 29 September 2004) was a British historian born in [[Neston]], Cheshire, son of historian Brian Wormald.

He attended [[Eton College]] as a [[King's Scholar]]. From 1966 to 1969 he read modern history at [[Balliol College]], Oxford, where he was tutored by [[Maurice Keen]] and farmed out for tutorials with [[J. M. Wallace-Hadrill|Michael Wallace-Hadrill]] (at that time a Senior Research [[Fellow]] at [[Merton College]], Oxford) and [[Peter Brown (historian)|Peter Brown]] (at that time a research fellow at [[All Souls College]], Oxford). Wormald's potential was subsequently recognised by both Merton and All Souls when those colleges awarded him, respectively, the Harmsworth Senior Scholarship and a seven-year Prize Fellowship.

Wormald taught [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval history]] at the [[University of Glasgow]] from 1974 to 1988, where his lectures drew huge enthusiasm from students.&lt;ref&gt;See Stuart Airlie, "Patrick Wormald the Teacher", in ''Early Medieval Studies in Memory of Patrick Wormald'', edited by Stephen Baxter et al.&lt;/ref&gt; There he also met and married fellow-historian [[Jenny Wormald|Jenny Brown]]. They had two sons, but their marriage was dissolved in 2001. While at Glasgow, he became a participant in the Bucknell Group of early medievalists, hosted by [[Wendy Davies]] &amp;ndash; the group taking its name from a village on the Welsh-English border where it often met. He delivered the Jarrow Lecture in 1984.

Following a [[British Academy]] Research Readership (1987&amp;ndash;89), Wormald returned to Oxford in 1989 as a college lecturer at [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]], where he was then appointed a fellow and university lecturer from 1990, tutoring students in medieval history. He delivered the Deerhurst Lecture in 1991 and the British Academy's Raleigh Lecture in History in 1995. In 1996 he gave the inaugural Richard Rawlinson Center Congress Lecture at the 31st International Congress on Medieval Studies in Kalamazoo. His greatest work, which took many years to produce, was ''The Making of English Law'', the first volume of which was published in 1999. Volume II was unfinished at the time of his death, although his extensive preparatory papers for the book have now been published online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlyenglishlaws.ac.uk/reference/wormald/|title=Papers Preparatory to the Making of English Law: King Alfred to the Twelfth Century, vol.

He was elected a fellow of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]] in 2003, and that year also delivered the Brixworth Lecture.

In 2009, a collection of essays written by leading scholars in Wormald's honour was published under the title ''Early Medieval Studies in Memory of Patrick Wormald'', edited by Stephen Baxter et al. The book is introduced by articles on Wormald's person and his academic output.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashgate.com/default.aspx?page=637&amp;calcTitle=1&amp;title_id=9463&amp;edition_id=10875 Ashgate publisher]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul Boyer''' (1864 – 1 October 1949) was a French [[Slavic languages|slavist]].

He inaugurated the chair of Russian language at the [[Institut national des langues et civilisations orientales]] of Paris in 1891. Administrator of the school from 1908 to 1936, in 1921 he founded the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Revue des études slaves|fr}}'' with [[Antoine Meillet]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|André Mazon|fr}}. The linguist {{Interlanguage link multi|Roger Bernard|fr}} was among his students.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2086">The '''Samuel Adams and Paul Revere Time Capsule''' is a [[time capsule]] located in a cornerstone of the [[Massachusetts State House]]. It is believed to have been buried in 1795 by then-Governor [[Samuel Adams]] and [[Paul Revere]]. It is the oldest known time capsule in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2870375/Time-capsule-Massachusetts-Statehouse.html 200 Year old time capsule] Retrieved 12 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The time capsule is a metal container measuring {{convert|5.5|×|7.5|×|1.5|in}}, and weighing about {{convert|10|lb|kg}}.  It was first removed from its location in 1855, at which time its contents were cleaned and documented.  Additional items were added to it at that time, and it was resealed in place.  The capsule was again removed from its location in December 2014.  X-ray examination by conservation specialists at the [[Boston Museum of Fine Arts]] revealed the presence of coins and other items.  It was opened by specialists in a media event in the American gallery of the museum on January 6, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.org/node/430606|title=Time Capsule Unveiling at Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|publisher=Museum of Fine Arts|accessdate=2015-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its contents include newspapers pages of the period, and coins including a rare 1652 [[Pine tree shilling]].  There was also a silver plate, probably engraved by Revere, and a copper medal depicting [[George Washington]].  The objects will be placed on display for a time, before being returned to the time capsule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/06/us/feat-paul-revere-sam-adams-boston-time-capsule/|title=1795 time capsule opened, centuries after Revere and Adams buried it|publisher=CNN|date=January 7, 2015|accessdate=2015-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Semi-direct democracy''' is a type of democracy that combines the mechanisms of [[direct democracy]] and [[representative government]]. In semi-direct democracy, representatives administer daily governance, but citizens keep the sovereignty, being able to control their governments and laws through different forms of popular action: binding [[referendum]], [[popular initiative]], [[revocation]] of mandate, [[plebiscites]], and public consultations. The first two forms—referendums and initiatives—are examples of direct legislation.

== History ==
Modern-era citizen lawmaking began in the towns of [[Switzerland]] in the 13th century. In 1847, the Swiss added the "statute referendum" to their national constitution. They soon discovered that merely having the power to veto Parliament's laws was not enough. In 1891, they added the "constitutional amendment initiative". Swiss politics since 1891 have given the world a valuable experience base with the national-level constitutional amendment initiative.&lt;ref name="Kobach1993"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kobach|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past 120 years, more than 240 initiatives have been put to referendums. The populace has been conservative, approving only about 10% of these initiatives; in addition, they have often opted for a version of the initiative rewritten by government.{{sfnp|Hirschbühl|2011a}}{{sfnp|Hirschbühl|2011b}}{{sfnp|Hirschbühl|2011c}}{{sfnp|Hirschbühl|2011d}}

== Application ==
A government is elected, but unlike the representative system, there are binding mechanisms of control, where the people take power and can veto laws of parliament, or propose new laws, which will subsequently be subject to a binding referendum. These mechanisms are the binding referendum and the popular legislative initiative. There are other mechanisms such as the revocation of the mandate, the avocation and the plebiscite. The main countries of application are Switzerland and Liechtenstein.

=== Switzerland ===
[[File:Swiss voting material.jpg|thumb|In [[Voting in Switzerland|Switzerland]], with no need to register, every citizen receives the [[ballot papers]] and information brochure for each vote, and can return it by post. Switzerland has various directly democratic instruments; votes are organised about four times a year.]]
{{Main article|Politics of Switzerland|Voting in Switzerland}}
{{Further information|Landsgemeinde|Federal popular initiative}}

The pure form of direct democracy exists only in the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] of [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]] and [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]].&lt;ref name=Golay/&gt; The [[Swiss Confederation]] is a semi-direct democracy (representative democracy with strong instruments of direct democracy).&lt;ref name=Golay/&gt; The nature of direct democracy in Switzerland is fundamentally complemented by its federal governmental structures (in [[German language|German]] also called the [[:de:Subsidiaritätsprinzip&lt;!-- please note that the English WP article about Subsidiarity does not (yet) reflect/discuss the political/governmental nature in a satisfiying quality, therefore referring to the German Article here --&gt;|Subsidiaritätsprinzip]]).{{sfnp|Hirschbühl|2011a}}{{sfnp|Hirschbühl|2011b}}{{sfnp|Hirschbühl|2011c}}{{sfnp|Hirschbühl|2011d}}

Most western countries have representative systems.&lt;ref name=Golay&gt;Vincent Golay and Mix et Remix, ''Swiss political institutions'', Éditions loisirs et pédagogie, 2008. {{ISBN|978-2-606-01295-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Switzerland]] is a rare example of a country with instruments of direct democracy (at the levels of the municipalities, [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]], and [[Politics of Switzerland|federal state]]). Citizens have more power than in a representative democracy. On any political level citizens can propose changes to the constitution ([[Popular initiative (Switzerland)|popular initiative]]), or ask for an [[optional referendum]] to be held on any law voted by the [[Federal Assembly (Switzerland)|federal]], [[cantonal]] parliament and/or [[Municipalities of Switzerland|municipal]] legislative body.&lt;ref name=refdum&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ch.ch/en/referendum |title=Referendums |publisher=Swiss Confederation |website=ch.ch – A service of the Confederation, cantons and communes |location=Berne, Switzerland |accessdate=2017-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110092314/https://www.ch.ch/en/referendum |archivedate=2017-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The list for [[mandatory referendum|mandatory]] or optional referendums on each political level are generally much longer in Switzerland than in any other country; for example any amendment to the constitution must automatically be voted on by the Swiss electorate and cantons, on cantonal/communal levels often any financial decision of a certain substantial amount decreed by legislative and/or executive bodies as well.&lt;ref name=refdum/&gt;

Swiss citizens vote regularly on any kind of issue on every political level, such as financial approvals of a school house or the building of a new street, or the change of the policy regarding sexual work, or on constitutional changes, or on the foreign policy of Switzerland, four times a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/directdemocracy/checks-and-balances_the-swiss-vote-more-than-any-other-country/36286970 |title=The Swiss vote more than any other country|author=Julia Slater |publisher=swissinfo.ch – the international service of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation |date=28 June 2013 |location=Berne, Switzerland |accessdate=2015-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between January 1995 and June 2005, Swiss citizens voted 31 times, on 103 federal questions besides many more cantonal and municipal questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/directdemocracy/explore-600-national-votes_how-direct-democracy-has-grown-over-the-decades/41481992 |title=How direct democracy has grown over the decades |author=Duc-Quang Nguyen |publisher=swissinfo.ch – the international service of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation |date=17 June 2015 |location=Berne, Switzerland |accessdate=2015-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921071817/http://www.swissinfo.ch/directdemocracy/explore-600-national-votes_how-direct-democracy-has-grown-over-the-decades/41481992 |archivedate=21 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same period, French citizens participated in only two referendums.&lt;ref name=Golay/&gt;

In [[Switzerland]], simple majorities are sufficient at the municipal and [[cantons of Switzerland|cantonal]] level, but at the federal level [[Double majority|double majorities]] are required on constitutional issues.&lt;ref name="Kobach1993" /&gt;

A double majority requires approval by a majority of individuals voting, and also by a majority of cantons. Thus, in Switzerland a citizen-proposed amendment to the federal constitution (i.e. [[Popular initiative (Switzerland)|popular initiative]]) cannot be passed at the federal level if a majority of the people approve but a majority of the cantons disapprove.&lt;ref name="Kobach1993" /&gt; For referendums or propositions in general terms (like the {{clarify span|text=principle of a|date=July 2018}} general revision of the Constitution), a majority of those voting is sufficient (Swiss Constitution, 2005).

In 1890, when the provisions for Swiss national citizen lawmaking were being debated by civil society and government, the Swiss adopted the idea of double majorities from the [[United States Congress]], in which House votes were to represent the people and Senate votes were to represent the [[U.S. state|states]].&lt;ref name="Kobach1993" /&gt; According to its supporters, this "legitimacy-rich" approach to national citizen lawmaking has been very successful. Kris Kobach claims that Switzerland has had tandem successes both socially and economically which are matched by only a few other nations. Kobach states at the end of his book, "Too often, observers deem Switzerland an oddity among political systems. It is more appropriate to regard it as a pioneer." Finally, the Swiss political system, including its direct democratic devices in a [[multi-level governance]] context, becomes increasingly interesting for scholars of [[European Union]] integration.&lt;ref&gt;Trechsel (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== California ===
[[California]] has a [[California ballot proposition|form of semi-direct democracy]] where citizens can start the referendum process if they are able to gather enough petition signatures. If enough petition signatures are gathered then the entire state's electorate can vote to approve or disapprove of the ballot measure.

'''Shunde District''', also known as '''Shuntak''', is a [[District (PRC)|district]] of the city of [[Foshan]], [[Guangdong]] province, located in the [[Pearl River Delta]]. Once a traditional agricultural county, it has become one of the most affluent counties in Guangdong and mainland China. Since 2009, it is administrated independently of Foshan city, answerable directly to the Guangdong provincial government.

==Administration division==
Shunde was a [[county-level city]] until 8 December 2002, when it became a [[District (PRC and ROC)|district]] of [[Foshan]] [[prefecture-level city]].&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shunde.gov.cn/zjsd/?id=2|script-title=zh:历史沿革|publisher=Government of Shunde|accessdate=May 4, 2013|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shunde has direct [[jurisdiction]] over four [[Subdistricts of China|subdistricts]] and six [[Town (China)|towns]]:

Unique as a district of any prefecture-level city in China, Shunde has been granted a degree of prefecture-level administrative autonomy over certain matters, notably economic development, independent of Foshan city, and has been answerable directly to the Guangdong Provincial government since 2009.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

==Economy==
Situated in the fertile [[Pearl River Delta]], its economy was once dominated by agriculture, fisheries and [[Sericulture|silk farming]]. Since the implementation of policies related to reform and openness began in 1978, the people of this area were given full control over their geographical position and culture. This has allowed Shunde to gradually develop into a modern industrial [[boomtown]], especially the manufacturing of [[Lecong Furniture Market|furniture]] and [[electric appliances]].&lt;ref name="industry"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shunde.gov.cn/zjsd/?id=6|script-title=zh:传统产业|publisher=Government of Shunde|accessdate=May 4, 2013|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some mainland Chinese product brands like [[Hisense Kelon|Kelon]] or [[Midea (company)|Midea]] are made in Shunde. Recently a new technology industrial park has also been opened in this area, featuring car manufacturers such as [[Toyota]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} [[Galanz]], an appliance maker, has its headquarters in Shunde District.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.galanz.com/pages/cate.aspx?catid=16|210 Contact Us]." [[Galanz]]. Retrieved on May 23, 2015. "Address: No.25, Ronggui South Rd, Shunde District, Foshan City, Guangdong Province, China" and [http://www.galanz.com.cn/pages/cate.aspx?catid=16|210 Chinese address]: Foshan: "地址：广东省佛山市顺德区容桂大道南25号"&lt;/ref&gt;

Shunde was approved as a [[pilot experiment|pilot city]] for the comprehensive reform of Guangdong in 1993,&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; and also for taking the lead in accomplishing modernization in 1999. From 2000 to 2003, Shunde was ranked first among China's top 100 counties for Basic Economic Competitiveness for four consecutive years (released by [[National Bureau of Statistics of China]]). In 2005, Shunde's GDP was 2,170 billion yuan.&lt;ref name="2005gdp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sg.shunde.gov.cn/data/main.php?id=1255-7200129|title=广东GDP总量超新加坡香港|publisher=Government of Shunde|date=Jan 26, 2006|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, this area has become one of the most affluent counties in [[Guangdong]] and mainland China (according to official information from the [[People's Republic of China|Chinese government]] and the [[United Nations]]).{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} The [[GDP]] reached 127.5 billion yuan in 2007, an annual increase of 18%, and GDP per capita reached 107,991 yuan (ca. US$14,200).

==Tourism==
Tourist attractions include the [[Qinghui Garden]], which features fish ponds surrounded by [[osmanthus]], [[bamboo]] and [[mulberry]] bushes,&lt;ref name="qinghuigarden"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cits.net/china-guide/destinations/chinese-gardens/qinghui-garden.html|title=Qinghui Garden|publisher=CITS.net|accessdate=May 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Bruce Lee]] Memorial Museum located in [[Jun'an, Guangdong|Jun'an]]. [[Shunfengshan Park]] was opened to the public in 2004 and has a memorial archway which is {{convert|88|m|ft}} wide and {{convert|38|m|ft}} high. Baolin Temple is accessible through the park.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shunde-hotels.com/en/tour.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Travelling from Shunde is easy with many different options. There are ferries and buses that go directly to Hong Kong, including an option to Hong Kong International Airport. Bus tickets can be purchased at the New World Centre Hotel. Macau is easily accessible by train, taking less than an hour. Guangzhou is accessible by train, taxi or bus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foshan.gov.cn/zjfs/lyjd/lydt/sd/201009/t20100927_1870110.html|script-title=zh:顺峰山简介|date=July 24, 2009|language=zh|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410060548/http://www.foshan.gov.cn/zjfs/lyjd/lydt/sd/201009/t20100927_1870110.html|archivedate=April 10, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== UNESCO Creative Cities ==
China’s southern city of Shunde joined the UNESCO Creative Cities Network as the city of gastronomy on Monday. Another 27 cities from 19 countries were also added to the list.

Shunde has long been widely regarded as the basis for exquisite Cantonese cuisine and the cradle of Cantonese cuisine chefs. While the cuisine of Guangzhou has been historically very minimalist in terms of flavorings, food from Shunde is known for its liberal use of ingredients such as sun dried tangerine peel and dates, resulting in simple but powerful flavors.

Launched in 2004, the UNESCO Creative Cities Network is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year. The network aims to foster international cooperation between cities committed to investing in creativity as a driver for sustainable urban development, social inclusion and enhanced cultural influence in the world.

By joining the network, cities commit to collaborate and develop partnerships with a view to promoting creativity and cultural industries, to share best practices, to strengthen participation in cultural life and to integrate culture in economic and social development plans.

The network covers seven thematic areas: craft and folk arts, design, film, gastronomy, Literature, media arts and music. It aims to promote international cooperation and encourage the sharing of experiences and resources to promote local development through culture and creativity.[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/food/2014-12/02/content_19007731.htm]

With these new designations, the number of UNESCO Creative Cities Network members now totals 69.

== City of Gastronomy ==
Shunde is one of the cradles of Cantonese cuisine, situated at the core of the Pearl River Delta, with Guangzhou to the north and Hong Kong to the south. Its outstanding natural environment, lively cultural scene, prosperous economy and renowned culinary arts academies provide particularly favorable conditions for the development of a gastronomic culture and industry.

The chefs in the city pay special attention to retaining the ingredients’ flavors and cook with attractive colors, fragrances and tastes that can be described as "light, fresh, crispy, tender, smooth and genuine". Shunde cuisine is famous for its delicacies characterized by their nutritional value and preparation. The combination of inventive cooking methods, creative ways of presentation and outstanding flavors, make the city’s cuisine truly exceptional.

Shunde’s longstanding and well-developed gastronomy as well as more recent processes of industrialization have brought forth ambitions for future developments. The city is determined to further its image as an innovative city of gastronomy and creativity.[http://qbview.url.cn/getResourceInfo?appid=31&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.unesco.org%2Fcreative-cities%2Fshunde%3Fnsukey%3DYW5Jpnmy%252FnikP2RjEeRlTVg40VxnNqNAeVHwqk7kE%252Bs28dHCM%252FzTDFCwPs9Q%252BOpkLHZc60c5jvxfa5kOeejV0fKnOfYxngdFsqilQbNDYdaitfoj0acpRqG2hEo0]

An unusual feature of Shunde cuisine is its desserts, such as [[double skin milk]], made with [[dairy product]]s - otherwise rare in Chinese cuisine - an indirect legacy of European missionaries and merchants active in the area since the 16th Century.

As of 2017 there are 18 cities in the world which have been awarded the UNESCO "City of Gastronomy", of which Shunde is one of two in China (the other being [[Chengdu]]).

==Famous residents and people from the area==
[[Martial artist]] [[Bruce Lee]]'s ancestral roots are traced to Gwan'on ([[Jun'an, Guangdong|Jun'an]]) in Seundak (Shunde). A street in the [[village]] is named after the actor, and his ancestral home is open to the public.

Others include:
* The former Lord Mayor of [[Melbourne, Australia]], [[John So]]. 
* Real estate developer [[Lee Shau Kee]], and, as of May 2013, the 24th richest person in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bloomberg Billionaires Index|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/|accessdate=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Real estate developer [[Yang Guoqiang]]
* Famous actor [[Law Kar Ying]]
* [[Eileen Yin-Fei Lo]], Chinese-American cookbook writer

One possible translation of the [[demonym]] for Shunde(Shuntak) might be ''Shuntakese''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3997">The '''societies''' ('''''societés''''') '''of Saint Lucia''' are two historic associations on the [[Antilles|Antillean]] [[island country]] of [[Saint Lucia]], [[La Woz]] ("The Rose") and [[La Magwit]] ("The Marguerite"). Ostensibly based around singing the virtues of the [[rose]] and [[Gomphrena|globosa]] flowers, the societies are intense rivals, and their membership includes most of the population of the island.

Each society holds a yearly festival, on August 30 for the "Roses" and October 17 for the "Marguerites".  These flower festivals are unique to St. Lucia and are major events in the cultural life and history of the country.

The names ''La Woz'' and ''La Magawit'' are in the local [[Antillean Creole|Creole (Kweyol)]] language, that combines a European vocabulary with a West African based grammar.

==History==
The societies originated in the time of [[slavery]] as co-operative work groups created for mutual support, and assistance in time of trouble. These groups were similar to the ''dokpwé'' of [[Dahomey]], and the ''coumbite'' of [[Haiti]]. They also had a great deal in common with the famed ''egbes'' of the [[Yoruba people]]s, which were and still are presided over by the tribe's various [[chieftain]]s through the framework of what is essentially a highly elaborate series of [[West Africa]]n [[theatre state]]s.

Furthermore, the two societies were vaguely inspired by two mystic orders that were active at the time in Europe, [[Rosicrucianism]] and [[Freemasonry]]. This connection is depicted in a mural painted by Dunstan St. Omer, which shows the holy [[trinity]] of [[Osiris]], [[Horus]] and [[Isis]].{{citation needed|date=December 2009}}

In former years the St Lucian society was split in affiliation to one or the other group. At times membership has been illegal, and it has also been condemned by the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Nevertheless the societies survived, although their nature has changed through the centuries.  As the general society changed, so did the ''sociétés'', becoming more commercial and money-oriented.  In time, other organisations were created for money saving and social security.  Nowadays, the two historical ''societés'' are largely devoted to solidarity through recreation.

At the time of Saint Lucia's Independence, when the national symbols – tree, bird, flower etc. – were being defined, St Lucia chose to have two flowers, a [[rose]] and a [[Argyranthemum|marguerite]].

==Structure==
Both societies have a formal hierarchic structure patterned upon the socio-economic structure of colonial society.  Each society has a [[king]] and a [[queen consort|queen]], as well as [[prince]]s, [[princess]]es, and many other symbolic legal, military and professional roles, such as [[judge]]s, [[police]]men, [[nurse]]s, [[soldier]]s.

==Festivals==
Preparations for the yearly festivals begin several months before the actual feast day. Each group holds "seances". These consist of all night singing and dancing sessions where drinks are sold and games are played.

The central figure at the "seances" is the ''shatwel'' or leadsinger who sustains the spirit and tenor of the entertainment. Most groups have one outstanding ''shatwel''. They are usually  female.

On the actual day of the festival all members of the society dress in the finery of their respective roles and march to Church for a service which precedes their parade through the streets before returning to the hall for their feasting or ''grande fete''.

==Plot introduction==
Narrated by Jasper Jackson, an accomplished [[Western calligraphy|calligrapher]] and serial seducer living off [[Warwick Avenue, London]]; it tells how his seemingly perfect life unravels when his most recent infidelity is discovered and his girlfriend Lucy leaves him. Jasper though is soon captivated by a new neighbour Madeleine Belmont, a travel-writer, whilst he is commissioned to transcribe the Songs and Sonnets of [[John Donne]] for a wealthy American businessman. The book describes his growing love and commitment to Madeleine, illuminated by observations from the sonnets he is transcribing. But will his relationship with Madeleine last?

==Reception==
*[[Stephen Metcalf (writer)|Stephen Metcalf]] in the ''[[New York Times]]'' writes 'Docx, a columnist by trade, frequently writes like a columnist by habit, in terse editorial sound bites... Nonetheless, the pace is mostly brisk, the tone most often light, and there are a few streaks of fiendish cleverness.'&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/02/books/no-lad-is-an-island.html?src=pm No Lad Is an Island] review from ''The New York Times'' By Stephen Metcalf, November 02, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
*Diane White of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' describes it as 'a delight, a witty, deftly written, honest comedy of manners', 'a novel that is as intelligent and sophisticated as it is light and funny'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2003/11/09/in_war_and_peace_two_selfish_seducers_follow_their_blissfollow_their_bliss/ In war and peace, two selfish seducers follow their bliss] review by Diane White in ''The Boston Globe'', 11/9/2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Mark Rozzo of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' warns "At times, you wonder whether Docx isn't almost too fluent. Like his sure-handed hero, he has a flair for flourishes and curlicues. Yet there's something undeniably winning about a novel that dares to use the randy love poems of John Donne as a running thread (each chapter corresponds to a song or sonnet that Jasper is transcribing) and yet somehow manages to come off as a [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] comedy coming to a theater near you.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2003/nov/16/books/bk-rozzo16 First Fiction - ''Los Angeles Times''] by Mark Rozzo, November 16, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[The Economist]]'' concludes with "The beauty of Donne's words provides a satisfyingly crisp contrast to the book's laddish, laugh-aloud dialogue and strong characterisation is maintained throughout. Charmer and philanderer he may be, but Jasper's optimism and zest for life give him the appeal of a man ruled by both his head and his heart. If readers can suspend disbelief at the painfully shocking double-whammy served up at the end of the story, then this stylishly written, pacy novel is a sexy, satisfying read."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/2155334 First novel: The pursuit of love] from ''The Economist'', Oct 23rd 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Light Princess''' is a musical by [[Tori Amos]] and Samuel Adamson. Based on the Scottish [[The Light Princess|fairy tale]] by [[George MacDonald]], it tells the story of a princess afflicted by a constant weightlessness, unable to get her feet on the ground, both literally and metaphorically, until she finds a love that brings her down to earth. The musical was premiered for the [[Royal National Theatre]] in London in 2013. The stage production featured actress [[Rosalie Craig]] as the titular character. The musical was generally well-received, enjoyed an extended run in the theatre, and released its cast recording in 2015.

==Background and Creation==
In 2013, the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] produced a musical staging of the story. It is adapted by [[Samuel Adamson]]; directed by [[Marianne Elliott (director)|Marianne Elliott]], winner of the [[Tony Award for Best Director|Tony Award for Best Directing]] in 2011, and has music and lyrics by [[Tori Amos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://loft965.com/2010/01/12/tori-amos-discusses-her-new-musical-the-light-princess/ |title= Tori Amos discusses her new musical "The Light Princess" |date= |website= @LOFT965 |publisher=  |accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was expected to premiere in London in April 2012, but The National Theatre announced in October 2011 that the production would be delayed until later in the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-15421345 |title=BBC News - Tori Amos musical The Light Princess put on hold |date=23 October 2011 |website=Bbc.co.uk |accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The musical opened to positive reviews in September 2013, starring [[Rosalie Craig]] in the titular role, subsequently singled out as a stand-out performance. Craig was nominated for many awards, and ultimately won the Evening Standard's award for best actress in a musical. The choreography, lighting, set design, music (Amos) and other cast performances were also lauded and nominated for a range of awards. In 2014, Amos stated that the production team had ambitions of bringing ''The Light Princess'' to American [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], but expressed worry that the original National Theatre production might not be commercial enough for the American audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.broadway.com/buzz/175796/odds-ends-anna-kendrick-finds-mr-right-tori-amos-broadway-hopes-for-the-light-princess-more |title= Odds &amp; Ends: Anna Kendrick Finds ''Mr. Right'', Tori Amos' Broadway Hopes for The Light Princess &amp; More! |last=Lloyd Webber |first=Imogen |authorlink=Imogen Lloyd Webber |date=5 May 2014 |website= Broadway.com |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On creating the musical, Amos stated:
[[File:Tori-amos-berlin-0c-cropped-418x452.jpg|thumb|American singer/songwriter and classically trained pianist [[Tori Amos]] wrote music and lyrics for the musical stage production.]]
"It wasn’t commercial theater, so from the top down they (the National Theatre) said to us, do not dumb this down. You be brave, you be bold, you be confrontational. Sam and I said, well, this is a feminist fairy tale, and not everyone will be comfortable with it. It’s not always going to make everyone feel warm and fuzzy. It brings up confrontations between teenagers and their parents, that would resonate in the 21st century [...] The Light Princess has to be something that kids can come see, because it is a story of a teenage girl. It might be a little dark for some. But we found that there were kids that were completely entranced. And even though sometimes it got scary, they stayed with the story."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://radio.com/2014/05/05/tori-amos-recording-soundtrack-to-the-light-princess-musical-eyes-broadway-production/ |title=Tori Amos Recording Soundtrack to ‘The Light Princess’ Musical, Eyes Broadway Production |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=5 May 2014 |website=Radio.com |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Selected tracks from the musical is available for streaming from the National Theatre, including "My Fairy Story", "Althea", "Amphibiava" and "Better Than Good".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://soundcloud.com/nationaltheatre/sets/music-from-the-light-princess |title=Music from The Light Princess |last1=Amos |first1=Tori |last2=Adamson |first2=Samuel |date=25 November 2013 |website=SoundCloud |publisher= Sword and Stone Publishing |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another stage adaption was done to the fairy tale by a Massachusetts director, Emily C. A. Snyder.

On 1st July 2018 Alex Parker and Club 11 staged a concert performance of the musical at [[Cadogan Hall]] in London. It starred [[Rosalie Craig]] returning to the role of Althea, Craig's husband [[Hadley Fraser]] as Prince Digby, Trevor Dion Nicholas as King Darius, Gabrielle Brooks as Piper, Louis Maskell as Llewelyn, Norman Bowman as King Ignacio, [[Anna-Jane Casey]] as Sergeant at Arms, Laura Pitt-Pulford as Falconer and David Langham as Mr Flowers. Both Tori Amos and Samuel Anderson attended the concert who both joined in the rapturous standing ovation at the end of the performance.  

==Synopsis==
In the middle of a desert lies the kingdom of Lagobel, which owes its wealth to gold buried in its native sands. The kind king and queen have two children, eldest son Alexander and daughter Althea. When the queen dies, the kingdom is plunged into a tearful sorrow, all except the princess Althea, who instead chooses to reject sadness, instead floating into the air, above emotion and responsibility, seemingly without any influence from gravitational forces. Her father descends into cold-heartedness, locking her in a tower with the orphan Piper.

East of Lagobel, across a vast wooded wilderness, lies Sealand, a kingdom rich in natural resources, most notably a healthy network of rivers. The queen dies mysteriously shortly after questioning the greedy king. The land dares not weep, fearing the king's wrath. The prince Digby, however, did not smile after the incident, adopting the moniker 'Solemn Prince of Sealand'. He grows up to be a proud and dutiful warrior.

The day of Digby's coming of age, Prince Alexander of Lagobel was killed by a Sealand assassin, and Sealand declares war on Lagobel, with sights aimed upon the vast riches of their Western neighbor. Upon the realization of Althea's impending ascent to the throne, the king of Lagobel urges her to take up her familial duty of leading Lagobel's army against the incoming siege from Sealand. Althea laughs off her father's requests, instead fleeing to the wilderness to find her own sanctuary. She comes across a secret lake, the source of Lagobel's limited water supply. She hears about the slaughter of the Lagobel army at the hands of the Sealand force.

At the lake she comes across Prince Digby, who teases her about her lack of gravity, and realizes the value of the lake upon which Lagobel depends for life. His conversation with Althea fills Digby with mirth, prompting his first smile since his childhood. He falls in love with Althea, and she for him, engaging in a joyous dance in the forest.

Back in Lagobel, rumors of the princess's actions in the forests fill the people with distrust with the throne. The king redoubles his efforts to return Althea to a normal state. He accepts the theory that making the princess cry will cure her. He tries arranging a marriage for her, in the hope that destroying her subsequent marriage or child will cause her to cry.

Althea escapes again to the lake, where she and Digby declare themselves queen and king of the lake, and consummate their love, conceiving a child. Digby asks Althea to return to the normal world with him, offering to build a house. Althea, preferring her watery home, asks Digby to stay. Digby heads toward Sealand, encountering his brother on the way. Digby tells Llewelyn he has killed the princess and they return to Sealand.

The king of Sealand learns of the life-giving lake and vows to dam it to choke the life out of Lagobel. Digby returns to the lake to destroy the dam, and is nearly killed. Althea witnesses this and cries for fear of his death. This returns her gravity. The two get married and live happily ever after, striking a peace between the kingdoms. Althea goes to university and becomes a [[marine biologist]] and appoints Piper Prime Minister.

==Music==
The music was composed by [[Tori Amos]]. {{main article|The Light Princess (Original Cast Recording)}}

==Critical reception==

The musical received mixed but generally positive reviews, with the majority of critics praising Craig's spectacular lead performance, the strong ensemble cast, the vivid and rich set design by Rae Smith, and the elaborate, imaginative choreography used to create the illusion of Althea floating in air. The script by Adamson and music by Amos, however, divided critics. Professional critic ratings of the musical ranged the full spectrum from 1 to 5 stars, though more often complimentary than not.

Many reviewers found the musical to be a fantastic and unusual fairytale with unafraid scope and smarts. ''The Independent'' gave it a 4-star review, calling it a "bewitchingly unusual evening walking on air".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/reviews/theatre-review-tori-amos-the-light-princess--magical-and-ravishingly-distinctive-8871127.html |title=Theatre review: Tori Amos' The Light Princess - 'magical and ravishingly distinctive' |last1=Taylor |first1=Paul |date=10 October 2013 |website=Independent.co.uk |publisher=The Independent |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Time Out'' likewise gave it 4 stars, saying it was "a visual and technical tour de force with a title performance from Rosalie Craig that’ll blow your mind and melt your heart."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/london/theatre/the-light-princess |title=The Light Princess |last1=Lukowski |first1=Andrzej |date=10 October 2013 |website=Time Out London |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 4 star review came from ''What's On Stage'', calling it an "unusual and delightful surprise" with an excellent ensemble led by a Craig in "one of the most extraordinary, vocally resourceful and physically triumphant performances ever seen in musical theatre.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/london-theatre/news/10-2013/critics-divided-over-the-light-princess_32240.html |title= Critics divided over ''The Light Princess'' |author= Editorial Staff |date= 10 October 2013 |website=What's On Stage |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Evening Standard'' gave 4 stars, finding the musical "worth the wait" and a showcase for Amos as an artist and songwriter, with a stunningly good performance by Craig and gorgeous set design by Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/theatre/the-light-princess-national-theatre--theatre-review-8870753.html |title= The Light Princess, National Theatre - theatre review |last1=Hitchings |first1=Henry |date=10 October 2013 |website=Standard.co.uk |publisher= London Evening Standard |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Metro'' likewise gave 4 stars, with splendid music by Amos and fantastic production, but ultimately being blown away by Craig as Althea, concluding with "a star is born."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://metro.co.uk/2013/10/10/rosalie-craig-is-spunkily-charismatic-in-tori-amoss-the-light-princess-4141999/ |title=Rosalie Craig is spunkily charismatic in Tori Amos’s The Light Princess |last1=Shore |first1=Robert |date=10 October 2013 |website=Metro.co.uk |publisher=Metro News |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simon Edge of ''The Daily Express'' gave the musical its best review, a perfect score of 5 stars, calling it a "feast for the eyes", with a "staggeringly good" lead performance by Craig, stirring and sweet music by Amos, and ultimately finding that "this bonkers but beautiful fantasy defies categorisation". Edge stated:

&lt;small&gt;''"Every so often you see something in the theatre so arresting, so unlike anything you’ve seen before, that you want to grab strangers in the street and tell them to book tickets [...] Bonkers, dazzling, lyrical, fun and sweet - Tori Amos's musical is a wonderful, unforgettable feast for the senses [...] All I know is I’d go again tomorrow, and again the day after that."''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/theatre/435642/The-Light-Princess-at-the-Lyttelton-Theatre-review |title=The Light Princess at the Lyttelton Theatre - review |last1=Edge |first1=Simon |date=10 October 2013 |website=Express.co.uk |publisher=Daily Express |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other reviewers were mixed in their critiques, most often founding the musical too unfocused, its script overtly preachy for adults, and the music not memorable enough.

==Cast recording==
{{main article|The Light Princess (Original Cast Recording)}}
A cast album of the 2013 London production was released in October 2015 by Universal/Mercury Classics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/190784-Tori-Amos-Producing-The-Light-Princess-Cast-Album-Is-Broadway-Next |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506050554/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/190784-Tori-Amos-Producing-The-Light-Princess-Cast-Album-Is-Broadway-Next |archivedate=2014-05-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The album will be produced by songwriter and composer Tori Amos, recorded during 2014 at different stops during her [[Unrepentant Geraldines Tour]] in support of her own album. Amos' tour team, including Mark Hawley and Marcel van Limbeek, engineered the cast album throughout the tour, having recorded the orchestra in April and met up with the different cast members "as they were available". It will contain all 33 tracks from the show and will also feature exclusive bonus tracks sung by Amos. Amos expressed she was happy to be able to give ''The Light Princess'' a cast recording under these terms, because so many theatre musicals no longer get an album release because of the expense and logistics involved.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.antimusic.com/news/14/May/06Tori_Amos_Recording_Soundtrack_to_The_Light_Princess_Musical.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Think of the children collage.jpg|thumb|alt=Typewritten pleas by five congressmen to "think of the children", in different fonts and pitch sizes|"Think of the children" argument used in the [[United States Congress]]]]

"'''Think of the children'''" (also "'''What about the children?'''") is a [[cliché]] that evolved into a [[rhetoric]]al tactic.&lt;ref name="meany" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jackmarshall" /&gt;&lt;ref name="borschke2011" /&gt; Literally it refers to [[children's rights]] (as in discussions of [[child labor]]).&lt;ref name="nationalchild" /&gt;&lt;ref name="boyce2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="perry2010" /&gt; In debate, however, it is a [[Appeal to pity|plea for pity]] that is used as an [[appeal to emotion]], and therefore it becomes a [[formal fallacy|logical fallacy]].&lt;ref name="meany" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jackmarshall" /&gt;&lt;ref name="borschke2011" /&gt;

''Art, Argument, and Advocacy'' (2002) argued that the appeal substitutes [[emotion]] for [[reason]] in debate.&lt;ref name="meany" /&gt; [[Ethics|Ethicist]] Jack Marshall wrote in 2005 that the phrase's popularity stems from its capacity to stunt [[rationality]], particularly discourse on [[moral]]s.&lt;ref name="jackmarshall" /&gt; "Think of the children" has been invoked by [[censorship]] proponents to shield children from perceived danger.&lt;ref name="beattie2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="keenangt4" /&gt; ''Community, Space and Online Censorship'' (2009) argued that classifying children in an [[infantile]] manner, as innocents in need of protection, is a form of obsession over the concept of purity.&lt;ref name="beattie2009" /&gt; A 2011 article in the ''Journal for Cultural Research'' observed that the phrase grew out of a [[moral panic]].&lt;ref name="coleman2011" /&gt;

It was an exhortation in the 1964 [[Walt Disney Productions|Disney]] film ''[[Mary Poppins]]'', when the character of Mrs. Banks pleaded with her departing [[nanny]] not to quit and to "think of the children!"&lt;ref name="kathrynlaity" /&gt; The phrase was popularized as a [[satire|satiric]] reference on the animated television program ''[[The Simpsons]]'' in 1996,&lt;ref name="cohen1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cohen2005" /&gt; when character [[Helen Lovejoy]] pleaded "Won't somebody please think of the children?"&lt;ref name="tenbrink2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="shotwell2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="keenanin2" /&gt; during a contentious debate by citizens of the fictional town of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]].&lt;ref name="tenbrink2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="patrick2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kitrosser2011" /&gt;

In the 2012 ''[[Georgia State University Law Review]]'', Charles J. Ten Brink called Lovejoy's use of "Think of the children" a successful [[parody]].&lt;ref name="tenbrink2012" /&gt; The appeal's subsequent use in society was often the subject of mockery.&lt;ref name="keenangt4" /&gt; After its popularization on ''The Simpsons'', the phrase has been called "Lovejoy's Law",&lt;ref name="keenanin2" /&gt; the "Helen Lovejoy defence", the "Helen Lovejoy syndrome",&lt;ref name="hunt2014" /&gt; and "think-of-the-children-ism".&lt;ref name="penny2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bruenig" /&gt;

==Background==
{{Details|Children's rights}}

[[Sociology|Sociologist]] [[Joel Best]] wrote in 1993 that during the late 19th century, adults developed an increased concern for the welfare of children. Best noted that societies experienced decreasing birth rates after [[industrialization]], with parents focusing their attention on fewer children. According to him, at that time adults began to view childhood as a sacred period of development and children as invaluable, adorable, guiltless beings. During the 1970s and 1980s, Best wrote, adults saw children as potential victims and sought to eliminate perceived threats.&lt;ref name="best1993"&gt;Best 1993, pp.&amp;nbsp;3–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1995 compilation ''Children and the Politics of Culture'', [[anthropologist]] [[Vivienne Wee]] analyzed the perception of children by adults and how it supported the concept of [[children's rights]]. Wee wrote that in this model (which she called the European pattern), children were seen as defenseless, unadulterated, and in need of protection by authoritative adults. According to Wee, this European pattern led to the idea that children required the sanctuary of the [[United Nations Charter]] and the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]].&lt;ref name="wee1995" /&gt;

Wee wrote: "Alternatively, children's vulnerability could be interpreted as purity and innocence, needing the protection of responsible adults. It is this second, protective mode of interpretation that underlies the very idea of children's rights, needing the protection of a UN charter – hence the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child."&lt;ref name="wee1995" /&gt; She observed that the view of youth as weak and innocent focused on what might occur if children's rights were not shielded.&lt;ref name="wee1995"&gt;Wee 1995, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Wee argued that this behavior towards children was not entirely positive. According to her, this mindset may lead to [[hypocrisy]] by adults who assume that all their actions intended to protect children and creates the risk that adults may wield power "for the children's own good". Noting that adult authority may be masked as empathy, Wee concluded: "These alternative cultural interpretations of the vulnerability of children would thus generate their own respective political and psychological consequences."&lt;ref name="wee1995" /&gt;

==Child advocacy==

{{quote box2 |width=25em | bgcolor=#c6dbf7 |align=right |halig=left | salign=right|quote=Think of the children&amp;nbsp;... freed of the crushing burden of dangerous and demeaning work.|source=&amp;nbsp;—[[Bill Clinton]]&lt;ref name="clinton1999" /&gt;}}

"Think of the children" has been used in its literal sense to advocate for the rights of children.&lt;ref name="nationalchild" /&gt;&lt;ref name="boyce2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="perry2010" /&gt; Early usage during the 20th century included writings in 1914 by the [[National Child Labor Committee]] criticizing [[child labor]] standards in the United States.&lt;ref name="nationalchild"&gt;National Child Labor Committee 1914, pp. 39, 73.&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] used the phrase in a 1999 speech to the [[International Labour Organization]],&lt;ref name="clinton1999" /&gt; asking his audience to imagine a significant reduction in child labor: "Think of the children&amp;nbsp;... freed of the crushing burden of dangerous and demeaning work, given back those irreplaceable hours of childhood for learning and playing and living."&lt;ref name="clinton1999"&gt;Clinton 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase's literal use extends into the 21st century, with Sara Boyce of the Children's Law Centre in [[Northern Ireland]] drawing on it to advocate for the legal rights of the region's children.&lt;ref name="boyce2003"&gt;Boyce 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The 2008 book ''Child Labour in a Globalized World'' used the phrase to call attention to the role of [[debt bondage]] in child labor.&lt;ref name="nesi2008"&gt;Nesi 2008, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Sara Dillon of [[Suffolk University Law School]] used the phrase "What about the children" in her 2009 book, ''International Children's Rights'', to focus on child-labor program conditions.&lt;ref name="dillon2009"&gt;Dillon 2009, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Benjamin Powell used the phrase differently in his book, ''Out of Poverty: Sweatshops in the Global Economy'', writing that in the absence of child labor some youth faced [[starvation]].&lt;ref name="powell2014"&gt;Powell 2014, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2010 book on [[human rights]], ''Children's Rights and Human Development'', child [[psychiatrist]] [[Bruce D. Perry]] used the phrase "think of the children" to urge clinicians to incorporate a process sensitive to developmental stages when counseling youth.&lt;ref name="perry2010"&gt;Perry 2010, p. 498.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate tactic==

===Logical fallacy===
In their 2002 book, ''Art, Argument, and Advocacy: Mastering Parliamentary Debate'', John Meany and Kate Shuster called the use of the phrase "Think of the children" in debate a type of [[formal fallacy|logical fallacy]] and an [[appeal to emotion]].&lt;ref name="meany" /&gt; According to the authors, a debater may use the phrase to [[emotion]]ally sway members of the audience and avoid [[logic]]al discussion.&lt;ref name="meany" /&gt; They provide an example: "I know this national missile defense plan has its detractors, but won't someone ''please'' think of the children?"&lt;ref name="meany"&gt;Meany 2002, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Their assessment was echoed by Margie Borschke in an article for the journal ''Media International Australia incorporating Culture and Policy'', with Borschke calling its use a [[rhetoric]]al tactic.&lt;ref name="borschke2011"&gt;Borschke 2011, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ethicist]] Jack Marshall described "Think of the children!" as a tactic used in an attempt to end discussion by invoking an unanswerable argument.&lt;ref name="jackmarshall"&gt;Marshall 2005&lt;/ref&gt; According to Marshall, the strategy succeeds in preventing rational debate.&lt;ref name="jackmarshall" /&gt; He called its use an [[Ethics|unethical]] manner of obfuscating debate, misdirecting [[empathy]] towards an object which may not have been the focus of the original argument.&lt;ref name="jackmarshall" /&gt; Marshall wrote that although the phrase's use may have a positive intention, it evokes [[irrationality]] when repeatedly used by both sides of a debate.&lt;ref name="jackmarshall" /&gt; He concluded that the phrase can transform the observance of regulations into an ethical quandary, cautioning society to avoid using "Think of the children!" as a final argument.&lt;ref name="jackmarshall" /&gt;

In his 2015 syndicated article "Think Of The Children", [[Michael Reagan]] criticized the phrase's use by politicians.&lt;ref name="michaelreagan2015"&gt;Reagan 2015&lt;/ref&gt; According to Reagan, politicians needed to stop using children as tools when arguing for favored governmental programs.&lt;ref name="michaelreagan2015" /&gt; He called the tactic an illogical argument, an act of desperation by those who felt they had a weaker case with reason-based arguments.&lt;ref name="michaelreagan2015" /&gt; Noting that it has been used by [[Democratic party (United States)|Democrats]] and [[Republican party (United States)|Republicans]] alike in the United States,&lt;ref name="michaelreagan2015" /&gt; Reagan called the tactic "obvious political BS".&lt;ref name="michaelreagan2015" /&gt;

===Moral panic===
[[File:2015 Think of the Children by Mia Love.ogv|thumb|alt=Link to video of Congresswoman Mia Love|The phrase, used by Congresswoman [[Mia Love]]]]

The ''Journal for Cultural Research'' published an article in 2010 by Debra Ferreday,&lt;ref name="ferreday2010"&gt;Ferreday 2010, pp. 409–429.&lt;/ref&gt; which was republished in the 2011 book ''Hope and Feminist Theory''.&lt;ref name="coleman2011"&gt;Coleman 2011, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ferreday, media use of "Won't someone think of the children!" had become common in a climate of [[moral panic]].&lt;ref name="coleman2011" /&gt; She suggested that the phrase was becoming so common that it could become another [[Godwin's law]].&lt;ref name="coleman2011" /&gt;

In a 2011 article for the journal ''Post Script'', Andrew Scahill wrote about the power of children in rhetoric to create an untenable stance for an opposing viewpoint.&lt;ref name="scahill2011" /&gt; According to Scahill, an individual arguing "for the children" makes it extremely difficult for an opponent to hold a "not for the children" position.&lt;ref name="scahill2011"&gt;Scahill 2011, pp.&amp;nbsp;69–81.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cassandra Wilkinson]] discussed the impact of "think of the children" rhetoric in a 2011 article for ''[[IPA Review]]''.&lt;ref name="berg2011"&gt;Berg 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Wilkinson cited research by ''No Fear: Growing Up in a Risk-Averse Society'' author Tim Gill that hypersensitivity in defending children from potential harm has the adverse effect of contributing to the inability of youth to own their choices and react to dangerous situations.&lt;ref name="wilkinson2011"&gt;Wilkinson 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[New Statesman]]'', [[Laurie Penny]] characterized the tactic as a political belief system and called it "think-of-the-children-ism".&lt;ref name="penny2011"&gt;Penny 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Elizabeth Stoker Bruenig wrote in a 2014 article for ''[[First Things]]'' that [[moralizing]] with the phrase was commonly seen in discussions of [[sexuality]],&lt;ref name="bruenig"&gt;Bruenig 2014&lt;/ref&gt; attributing this to society's increasing perception of morality as a [[femininity|feminine]] domain.&lt;ref name="bruenig" /&gt; Bruenig also cited the labeling of [[NBC]]'s refusal to broadcast a movie trailer about [[abortion]] as "think-of-the-children-ism".&lt;ref name="bruenig" /&gt;

==={{anchor|Censorship tool}}Censorship===
Scott Beattie wrote in his 2009 book, ''Community, Space and Online Censorship'', that the question "Will no one think of the children?" was often raised by individuals advocating [[censorship]] out of a concern that youth might view material deemed inappropriate.&lt;ref name="beattie2009"&gt;Beattie 2009, pp. 165–167.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Beattie, youngsters were cast as potential casualties of online sexual predators to increase regulation of the [[Internet]]; characterizing children as [[infantile]] evoked a concept of innocence which was a form of obsession over the concept of purity.&lt;ref name="beattie2009" /&gt;

For ''[[Make (magazine)|Make]]'' magazine, [[Cory Doctorow]] wrote in a 2011 article that "Won't someone think of the children?!" was used by irrational individuals to support arguments about the dangers to youth of the "[[Four Horsemen of the Infocalypse]]": "[[copyright infringement|pirates]]", [[terrorist]]s, [[organized crime]], and [[child pornography|child pornographers]].&lt;ref name="doctorow2011"&gt;Doctorow 2011, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Doctorow, the phrase was used to stifle discussion of underlying issues and halt [[rational analysis]].&lt;ref name="doctorow2011" /&gt; He observed its frequent use when society was determining an appropriate approach to the [[legal aspects of computing]].&lt;ref name="doctorow2011" /&gt;

In his 2013 book, ''Fervid Filmmaking'', Mike Watt discussed the history of [[censorship]] relative to the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Obscene Publications Act 1959]] and noted that films banned during that period became known as "[[Video nasty|video nasties]]".&lt;ref name="watt2013" /&gt; Watt called a current interpretation of such censorship the "Think of the Children" characterization.&lt;ref name="watt2013"&gt;Watt 2013, p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; Brian M. Reed wrote in his book, ''Nobody's Business'' (also published that year), that the phrase was devoid of substance and could be replaced for comic effect with "How many kittens must die?"&lt;ref name="reed2013"&gt;Reed 2013, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

For ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' in 2015, journalist [[Brendan O'Neill (journalist)|Brendan O'Neill]] wrote that [[Marjorie Heins]]' ''[[Not in Front of the Children: Indecency, Censorship, and the Innocence of Youth]]'' cited the centuries-long use by governments of the prevention of "harm to minors" as an excuse to increase censorship and control.&lt;ref name="brendanoneill"&gt;O'Neill 2015&lt;/ref&gt; According to O'Neill, the use of "Won't somebody please think of the children?" in contemporary culture had greatly increased and was a means of exerting [[moral authority]] with [[emotional blackmail]].&lt;ref name="brendanoneill" /&gt;

==Popularization==

===Film and television===
According to Kathryn Laity, early use of the phrase may have stemmed from its appearance in the 1964 [[Walt Disney Pictures]] film ''[[Mary Poppins]]''.&lt;ref name="kathrynlaity"&gt;Laity 2013, pp.&amp;nbsp;118–119, 128.&lt;/ref&gt; In an opening scene, the character of Mrs. Banks pleads with her nanny not to quit by begging her to "think of the children!".&lt;ref name="kathrynlaity" /&gt; Laity wrote that the popular use of the phrase evokes strong feelings in those who object to a [[nanny state]],&lt;ref name="kathrynlaity" /&gt; pointing out the conflict in the United States between the country's conservatism (derived from the [[Puritans]]) and its desire to use [[sex in advertising]].&lt;ref name="kathrynlaity" /&gt;

It was also used in [[John Huston]]'s 1982 film ''[[Annie (1982 film)|Annie]]'', spoken by [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] as Annie sings "Tomorrow" to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] at the White House in order to get Oliver Warbucks' begrudging support for [[New Deal]] policies he opposes.

"Think of the children" was popularized largely by character [[Helen Lovejoy]], wife of [[Reverend Lovejoy]], on the television program ''[[The Simpsons]]''.&lt;ref name="tenbrink2012"&gt;Ten Brink 2012, p. 789.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shotwell2012"&gt;Shotwell 2012, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="keenanin2"&gt;Keenan (April 26, 2014), p. IN2.&lt;/ref&gt; Lovejoy (who first appeared in 1990)&lt;ref name="groening1997"&gt;Groening 1997, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="martyn2000"&gt;Martyn 2000&lt;/ref&gt; repeatedly exclaimed, "Think of the children!" in several episodes of the series.&lt;ref name="keenanin2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sagers2009"&gt;Sagers 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="televisionweek2008"&gt;TelevisionWeek 2008, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; She first used the phrase in the episode "[[Much Apu About Nothing]]" by [[David X. Cohen]], which aired in 1996, imploring the city mayor to keep bears from crossing the [[wildland–urban interface]].&lt;ref name="cohen1996"&gt;Cohen 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cohen2005"&gt;Cohen 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chappell2014"&gt;Chappell 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Lovejoy's exhortation became increasingly overwrought with each subsequent use.&lt;ref name="chappell2014" /&gt;

''Simpsons'' writer [[Bill Oakley]] said in the 2005 [[DVD commentary]] on the episode that the motivation for the phrase on the show was to emphasize how "think of the children" was used in debate; irrelevant, it sidetracked discussion from the original issues.&lt;ref name="cohen2005" /&gt; Lovejoy used variations of the phrase, including "Oh, won't somebody please think of the children"&lt;ref name="cohen1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="patrick2000"&gt;Patrick 2000, p. B5.&lt;/ref&gt; and "What about the children",&lt;ref name="tenbrink2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mclennan2009"&gt;McLennan 2009, p. A15.&lt;/ref&gt; shrieking it most often when residents of the [[List of fictional towns in animation|fictional town]] of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] debated a contentious problem or argued about [[politics]]&lt;ref name="patrick2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kitrosser2011"&gt;Kitrosser 2011, p. 2395.&lt;/ref&gt; and logic failed.&lt;ref name="hunt2014"&gt;Hunt 2014, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Lovejoy's comic use of the phrase on ''The Simpsons''&lt;ref name="patrick2000" /&gt; [[satire|satirized]] its use in public discourse.&lt;ref name="keenanin2" /&gt;

==={{anchor|Lovejoy's law}}Lovejoy's Law===
[[File:Think of the children.webm|thumb|alt=Link to clip of Helen Lovejoy, wringing her hands as other characters ignore her or look annoyed|''Simpsons'' character Helen Lovejoy delivering her signature line, "Ohhh, won't somebody please think of the children!"]]
After the popularization of the phrase on ''The Simpsons'', its use in society was often ridiculed.&lt;ref name="keenangt4"&gt;Keenan (October 1, 2014), p. GT4.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Toronto Star]]'', journalist Edward Keenan referred to it as "Lovejoy's Law". Keenan defined "Lovejoy's Law" as a warning that the phrase is a probable diversion from a weak logical stance, writing that true empathy toward children involved rational argument rather than manipulation.&lt;ref name="keenanin2" /&gt; In an article for [[Ireland]]'s ''[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]'', Carol Hunt called the use of the phrase in political debate the "Helen Lovejoy defence" and wrote that it is also known as the "Helen Lovejoy syndrome". According to Hunt, it is often invoked in reference to [[hypothetical]] children rather than real children affected by a problem.&lt;ref name="hunt2014" /&gt;

In a ''[[Georgia State University Law Review]]'' article, [[Michigan State University College of Law]] professor Charles J. Ten Brink wrote that Helen Lovejoy's signature phrase was an adept and effective [[parody]].&lt;ref name="tenbrink2012" /&gt; According to ''[[The Canberra Times]]'', the phrase's 2009 use to support [[Internet censorship]] by the [[Department of Communications (Australia)|Department of Communications]] of the [[government of Australia]] was evocative of Helen Lovejoy.&lt;ref name="mclennan2009" /&gt;

In his book, ''The Myth of Evil'', Phillip A. Cole wrote that Helen Lovejoy's plea assumed that children were pure, unadulterated potential casualties who required constant defense from danger.&lt;ref name="cole2006"&gt;Cole 2006, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; Cole contrasted this notion with character [[Bart Simpson]], who prefers creating disorder to conformity and adherence to regulations.&lt;ref name="cole2006" /&gt; According to Cole, this exemplifies the dual perception of children by society: guileless potential prey and malevolent entities to be distrusted.&lt;ref name="cole2006" /&gt; Cole wrote that throughout history, the child has represented humanity's savage past and its optimistic future.&lt;ref name="cole2006" /&gt; Jo Johnson contributed a chapter, "Won't Somebody Think of the Children?", to the book ''Mediating Moms'', in which she analyzed the phrase's use in animated media (including ''The Simpsons'').&lt;ref name="jojohnson"&gt;Johnson 2012, pp.&amp;nbsp;65–66.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Johnson, the phrase was a key example of popular cultural depictions of mothers as neurotic and filled with anxiety about moral values.&lt;ref name="jojohnson" /&gt;

[[Image:Golqma arsenalka 3.JPG|right|thumb|270px|View from the domed main chamber]]

'''Golyama Arsenalka mound''' is a [[Thracians|Thracian]] burial [[tumulus]] with a subterranean stone building near the [[Bulgaria]]n town of [[Shipka (town)|Shipka]]. It dates from the end of 5th century BCE.

It is composed of a representative [[façade]], a small antechamber and a [[Dome|domed]] chamber. The entrances have been closed with double stone doors. The floor of the antechamber is made of rammed soil, while the domed chamber is made up of specially fitted stones. In the center of the domed chamber there is a circular [[granite]] block.  On the floor underneath it is a cavity surrounded by a ring of stones resembling the cult fireplaces in [[Seuthopolis|Seutopolis]]. Opposite to the entrance, there is a bed with east-west orientation. The temple was used for a funeral of a ruler or a nobleman. It was robbed of its valuables in [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]], but parts of a gilt breast plate, two small gold ornaments, and bones of horses were found during excavations in the antechamber.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3767">The '''Tucson Garbage Project''' is an [[archaeology|archaeological]] and [[sociology|sociological]] study instituted in 1973 by Dr. [[William Rathje]] in the city of [[Tucson]] in the [[southwestern United States|Southwestern]] American [[U.S. state|state]] of [[Arizona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Witold|last= Rybczynski|title=We Are What We Throw Away  |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE6DA163CF936A35754C0A964958260&amp;n=Top/Features/Books/Book%20Reviews&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=garbage%20dump%20archaeology&amp;st=cse |quote=Since 1973, a group of anthropologists at the University of Arizona has been conducting a series of systematic archeological digs, minutely sifting, classifying and recording the contents of more than 14 tons of excavated material. The site of their investigation, however, has not been ancient burial grounds or prehistoric settlements, but urban landfills -- in other words, garbage dumps. |work=[[New York Times]] |date=July 5, 1992 |accessdate=2009-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This project is sometimes referred to as the "[[garbology]] project".

==History==
Dr. Rathje (also known affectionately as "Captain Planet") and his students studied the contents of Tucson residents' [[waste]] to examine patterns of consumption. [[Quantitative research|Quantitative]] data from [[Wastebin|bin]]s was compared with information known about the residents who owned them. The results have shown that information people freely volunteered about their consumption habits did not always tally with the contents of their waste bins. For example, alcohol consumption was proven to be significantly higher in reality than in the questionnaires completed by the people studied. Such findings have highlighted the difference between people's self-reported and actual behaviors.

Such findings cast doubt on the reliability of historical record when applied to archaeological sites in general and follow a [[processualism|processualist]] approach stressing the benefits of scientific analysis. 

The project has since expanded to other American cities and has undertaken [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] of [[landfill]] sites. Among many of the important results of Rathje, were his conclusion on landfill degradation and consumer waste patterns. For example, an intuitive idea that existed before Rathje's work is that people will waste less expensive food in times of economic recession. Rathje's landfill project proved this idea to be incorrect: when resources are scarce, people tend to buy larger quantities of -for example- beef-meat, when they are on sale, only to end up throwing it out again as they have bought too much to consume before the expiration dates. Rathje's data shows that waste beef is far more common during an economic recession.
Another idea Rathje shattered is that of paper degradation in landfills. For a long time, it was believed that paper is a relatively safe and environmentally friendly waste product, degrading quickly in landfills. Rathje showed, however, that in fact paper is a typically ''bad degrader'': newspapers dumped in landfills as much as over half a century ago, turn up again as fresh and as readable as the day they were issued.&lt;ref&gt; Rathje &amp; Murphy, 1992. Rubbish!: The Archaeology of Garbage&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 study found that '''US citizens''' across the [[political spectrum]] dramatically underestimate the current US [[wealth inequality]] and would prefer a far more [[egalitarian]] distribution of wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Norton | first1 = M.I. | last2 = Ariely | first2 = D. | year = 2011 | title = Building a Better America – One Wealth Quintile at a Time | url = http://www.people.hbs.edu/mnorton/norton%20ariely%20in%20press.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 9–12 | doi=10.1177/1745691610393524}} ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPKKQnijnsM video])&lt;/ref&gt;

Wealth is usually not used for daily expenditures or factored into household budgets, but combined with income it comprises the family's total opportunity to secure a desired stature and standard of living, or pass their [[Social class in the United States|class status]] along to one's children.&lt;ref&gt;Grusky, David B. ''Social Stratification: Class, Race, and Gender in Sociological Perspective'', p. 637. Westview Press, 2001 {{ISBN|0-8133-6654-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, wealth provides for both short- and long-term financial security, bestows social prestige, and contributes to [[political power]], and can be used to produce more wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Keister, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, wealth possesses a [[psychological]] element that awards people the feeling of agency, or the ability to act. The accumulation of wealth grants more options and eliminates restrictions about how one can live life. [[Dennis Gilbert (sociologist)|Dennis Gilbert]] asserts that the standard of living of the working and middle classes is dependent upon income and wages, while the rich tend to rely on wealth, distinguishing them from the vast majority of Americans.&lt;ref name="Gilbert"&gt;Gilbert, D. (1998). ''The American Class Structure: In an Age of the Growing Inequality''. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt; A September 2014 study by [[Harvard Business School]] declared that the growing disparity between the very wealthy and the lower and middle classes is no longer sustainable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/08/us-usa-harvard-survey-idUSKBN0H30ZN20140908 America's wealth gap 'unsustainable,' may worsen: Harvard study].

===Early 20th century===
Pioneering work by [[Simon Kuznets]] using income tax records and his own well-researched estimates of national income showed a reduction of about 10% in the portion of national income going to the top 10%, a reduction from about 45–50% in 1913 to about 30–35% in 1948.&lt;ref name = Kuznets &gt;"He noted a sharp reduction in income inequality in the United States between 1913 and 1948. More specifically, at the beginning of this period, the upper decile of the income distribution (that is, the top 10 percent of US earners) claimed 45–50 percent of annual national income. By the late 1940s, the share of the top decile had decreased to roughly 30–35 percent of national income." Piketty, Thomas. ''Capital in the Twenty-First Century'' (Kindle Locations 298–300). Harvard University Press. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; This period spans both The [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]], events with significant economic consequences. This is called the [[Great Compression]].

==Wealth and income==
[[File:If-us-land-mass-were-distributed-like-us-wealth.png|thumb|left|250px|Artist's depiction of U.S. wealth inequality in 2013.]]
There is an important distinction between [[income]] and [[wealth]]. Income refers to a flow of money over time in the form of a rate (per hour, per week, or per year); wealth is a collection of assets owned minus liabilities. In essence, income is specifically what people receive through work, retirement, or [[social welfare]] whereas wealth is what people own.&lt;ref&gt;Grusky, page 637&lt;/ref&gt; While the two are seemingly related, [[income inequality]] alone is insufficient for understanding [[economic inequality]] for two reasons:
# It does not accurately reflect an individual's economic position
# Income does not portray the severity of [[financial inequality]] in the United States.

The [[United States Census Bureau]] formally defines income as received on a regular basis (exclusive of certain money receipts such as capital gains) before payments for personal income taxes, social security, union dues, medicare deductions, etc.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Census Bureau, Housing and Household Economic Statistics Division (December 20, 2005). ''Income Overview''. Retrieved December 2, 2007, from https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/about/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; By this official measure, the wealthiest families may have low income, but the value of their assets earns enough money to support their lifestyle. Dividends from trusts or gains in the stock market do not fall under the definition of income but are the primary money flows for the wealthy. Retired people also have little income but usually have a higher net worth because of money saved over time.&lt;ref name="Keister, page 65"&gt;Keister, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, income does not capture the extent of wealth inequality. Wealth is derived over time from the collection of income earnings and growth of assets. The income of one year cannot encompass the accumulation over a lifetime. Income statistics view too narrow a time span for it to be an adequate indicator of financial inequality. For example, the [[Gini coefficient]] for wealth inequality increased from 0.80 in 1983 to 0.84 in 1989. In the same year, 1989, the Gini coefficient for income was only 0.52.&lt;ref name="Keister, page 65"/&gt; The Gini coefficient is an economic tool on a scale from 0 to 1 that measures the level of inequality. 1 signifies perfect inequality and 0 represents perfect equality. From this data, it is evident that in 1989 there was a discrepancy about the level of economic disparity with the extent of wealth inequality significantly higher than income inequality. Recent research shows that many households, in particular those headed by young parents (younger than 35), minorities, and individuals with low educational attainment, display very little accumulation. Many have no financial assets and their total net worth is also low.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/working_papers/2000/wp2000_23.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, ''Savings of Young Parents'', December 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wealth Inequality in America by politizane.webm|thumb|Video on the differences between public perception and actual wealth inequality, 2012]]

According to the [[Congressional Budget Office]], between 1979 and 2007 incomes of the top 1% of Americans grew by an average of 275%. ... (Note: The IRS insists that comparisons of adjusted gross income pre-1987 and post-1987 are complicated by large changes in the definition of AGI led to households in the top income quintile reporting a lot more of their income in their individual income tax form's AGI, rather than reporting their business income in separate corporate tax returns, or not reporting certain non-taxable income in their AGI at all, such as municipal bond income.  Anyone who wants to discuss incomes in the U.S. fairly must include a chart of all available data split by quintile up to the mid-1980s.  That should be followed by a chart from 1990 to 2011.  The five-year gap would avoid the major AGI definition changes.  The big picture of this subject is not just a segment of all available data starting in 1979, especially after the IRS warned about the large AGI definition changes in the late 1980s). In addition, IRS studies consistently show a majority of households in the top income quintile have moved to a lower quintile within one decade.

In March 2017, [[NPR]] summarized the distribution of U.S. stock market ownership (direct and indirect through [[mutual funds]]) in the U.S., which is highly concentrated among the wealthiest families:
*52% of U.S. adults owned stock in 2016. Ownership peaked at 65% in 2007 and fell significantly due to the [[Great Recession]].
*As of 2013, the top 1% of households owned 38% of stock market wealth.
*As of 2013, the top 10% own 81% of stock wealth, the next 10% (80th to 90th percentile) own 11% and the bottom 80% own 8%.&lt;ref name="NPR_Stocks"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2017/03/01/517975766/while-trump-touts-stock-market-many-americans-left-out-of-the-conversation NPR-Danielle Kurtzleben-While Trump Touts Stock Market, Many Americans Are Left Out of the Conversation-March 1, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federal Reserve reported the median value of stock ownership by income group for 2016:
*Bottom 20% own $5,800.
*20th-40th percentile own $10,000.
*40th to 60th percentile own $15,500.

NPR reported that when politicians reference the stock market as a measure of economic success, that success is not relevant to nearly half of Americans. Further, more than one-third of Americans who work full-time have no access to pensions or retirement accounts such as [[401(k)]]s that derive their value from financial assets like stocks and bonds.&lt;ref name="NPR_Stocks"/&gt; The NYT reported that the percentage of workers covered by generous defined-benefit pension plans has declined from 62% in 1983 to 17% by 2016.&lt;ref name="NYT_Rattner"&gt;{{cite web | last=Rattner | first=Steven | title=Opinion - The Market Isn’t Bullish for Everyone | website=The New York Times | date=2018-01-22 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/22/opinion/bull-stock-market.html | access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some economists consider an increase in the stock market to have a "wealth effect" that increases economic growth, economists like Former Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher believe those effects are limited.&lt;ref name="NPR_Stocks"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2017/03/01/517975766/while-trump-touts-stock-market-many-americans-left-out-of-the-conversation NPR-Danielle Kurtzleben-While Trump Touts Stock Market, Many Americans Are Left Out of the Conversation-March 1, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

Essentially, the wealthy possess greater financial opportunities that allow their money to make more [[US money|money]]. Earnings from the stock market or mutual funds are reinvested to produce a larger return. Over time, the sum that is invested becomes progressively more substantial. Those who are not wealthy, however, do not have the resources to enhance their opportunities and improve their economic position. Rather, "after debt payments, poor families are constrained to spend the remaining income on items that will not produce wealth and will depreciate over time."&lt;ref name="Hurst, page 36"&gt;Hurst, p.  36&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar David B. Grusky notes that "62 percent of households headed by single parents are without savings or other financial assets."&lt;ref&gt;Grusky, p. 640&lt;/ref&gt; Net indebtedness generally prevents the poor from having any opportunity to accumulate wealth and thereby better their conditions.

[[Economic inequality]] is a result of difference in income. Factors that contribute to this gap in wages are things such as level of education, [[labor market]] demand and supply, gender differences, growth in technology, and personal abilities. The quality and level of education that a person has often corresponds to their skill level, which is justified by their income. Wages are also determined by the "market price of a skill" at that current time. Although [[gender inequality]] is a separate social issue, it plays a role in economic inequality. According to the U.S. Census Report, in America the median full-time salary for women is 77 percent of that for men. Also contributing to the wealth inequality in the U.S., both unskilled and skilled workers are being replaced by machinery. The Seven Pillars Institute for Global Finance and Ethics argues that because of this "technological advance", the income gap between workers and owners has widened.

Income inequality contributes to wealth inequality. For example, economist [[Emmanuel Saez]] wrote in June 2016 that the top 1% of families captured 52% of the total real income (GDP) growth per family from 2009-2015. From 2009 to 2012, the top 1% captured 91% of the income gains.&lt;ref&gt;[https://eml.berkeley.edu/~saez/saez-UStopincomes-2015.pdf Emmanuel Saez-Striking it richer: The evolution of top incomes in the U.S.-June 30,2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

Notably, for both the wealthy and not-wealthy, the process of accumulation or debt is cyclical. The rich use their money to earn larger returns and the poor have no savings with which to produce returns or eliminate debt. Unlike income, both facets are generational. Wealthy families pass down their assets allowing future generations to develop even more wealth. The poor, on the other hand, are less able to leave inheritances to their children leaving the latter with little or no wealth on which to build...This is another reason why wealth inequality is so important, its accumulation has direct implications for economic inequality among the children of today's families.&lt;ref name="Hurst, page 36"/&gt;

Corresponding to financial resources, the wealthy strategically organize their money so that it will produce profit. Affluent people are more likely to allocate their money to financial assets such as stocks, bonds, and other investments which hold the possibility of capital appreciation. Those who are not wealthy are more likely to have their money in savings accounts and home ownership.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, pp. 34–35&lt;/ref&gt; This difference comprises the largest reason for the continuation of wealth inequality in America: the rich are accumulating more assets while the middle and working classes are just getting by. Currently, the richest 1% hold about 38% of all privately held wealth in the United States.&lt;ref name="Hurst, page 34"/&gt; while the bottom 90% held 73.2% of all debt.&lt;ref name="Hurst, page 36"/&gt; According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', the richest 1 percent in the United States now own more wealth than the bottom 90 percent.&lt;ref name="NYT-20140722"/&gt;

However, other studies argue that higher average savings rate will contribute to the reduction of the share of wealth owned by the rich. The reason is that the rich in wealth are not necessarily the individuals with the highest income. Therefore, the relative wealth share of poorer quintiles of the population would increase if the savings rate of income is very large, although the absolute difference from the wealthiest will increase.&lt;ref&gt;Berman Y, Shapira Y, Ben-Jacob E (2015) Modeling the Origin and Possible Control of the Wealth Inequality Surge.

As the price of commodities increases because of inflation, a larger percentage of lower-class people's money is spent on things they need to survive and go to work, such as food and gasoline. Most of the working poor are paid fixed hourly wages that do not keep up with rises in prices, so every year an increasing percentage of their income is consumed until they have to go into debt just to survive.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} At this point, their little wealth is owed to lenders and banking institutions.

The nature of tax policies in America has been suggested by economists and politicians such as [[Emmanuel Saez]], [[Thomas Piketty]], and [[Barack Obama]] to perpetuate economic inequality in America by steering large sums of wealth into the hands of the wealthiest Americans. The mechanism for this is that when the wealthy avoid paying taxes, wealth concentrates to their coffers and the poor go into debt.&lt;ref&gt;Berman Y, Peters O, Adamou A (2016) Far from equilibrium: Wealth reallocation in the United States. https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05631&lt;/ref&gt;

The economist [[Joseph Stiglitz]] argues that "Strong unions have helped to reduce inequality, whereas weaker unions have made it easier for CEOs, sometimes working with market forces that they have helped shape, to increase it." The long fall in [[Labor unions in the United States|unionization in the U.S.]] since WWII has seen a corresponding rise in the inequality of wealth and income.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, Joseph E.

==Racial disparities==
The [[Racial inequality in the United States#Racial wealth gap|wealth gap between white and black families]] nearly tripled from $85,000 in 1984 to $236,500 in 2009.&lt;ref name=Shapiro&gt;{{cite web|title=The Roots of the Widening Racial Wealth Gap: Explaining the Black-White Economic Divide|url=http://iasp.brandeis.edu/pdfs/Author/shapiro-thomas-m/racialwealthgapbrief.pdf|work=Research and Policy Brief|date=February 2013|publisher=Brandeis University Institute on Assets and Social Policy|accessdate=16 March 2013|author=Thomas Shapiro|author2=Tatjana Meschede |author3=Sam Osoro }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many causes, including years of home ownership, household income, unemployment, and education, but inheritance might be the most important.&lt;ref name=Shapiro/&gt; Inheritance can directly link the disadvantaged economic position and prospects of today's blacks to the disadvantaged positions of their parents' and grandparents' generations.  According to a report done by Robert B. Avery and Michael S. Rendall, "one in three white households will receive a substantial inheritance during their lifetime compared to only one in ten black households."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Avery | first1=Robert B. | last2=Rendall | first2=Michael S. | title=Lifetime Inheritances of Three Generations of Whites and Blacks | publisher=The [[University of Chicago Press]]| year=2002 | volume=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; This relative lack of inheritance that has been observed among African Americans can be attributed in large part to factors such as unpaid labor (slavery), violent destruction of personal property in incidents such as [[Red Summer of 1919]], unequal opportunity in education and employment (racial discrimination), and more recent policies such as [[redlining]] and [[planned shrinkage]]. Other ethnic minorities, particularly those with darker complexions, have at times faced many of these same adversities to various degrees.&lt;ref name="race"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.soc.duke.edu/~lkeister/raceandfamilystructure.pdf | title=Race, Family Structure, and Wealth: The Effect of Childhood Family on Adult Asset Ownership | author=Keister, Lisa A. | journal=[[Sociological Perspectives]] | publisher=[[Pacific Sociological Association]]| year=2004 | volume=47 | issue=2 | pages=161–87 | doi=10.1525/sop.2004.47.2.161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The article [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/antonio-moore/americas-financial-divide_b_7013330.html "America's Financial Divide"] added context to racial wealth inequality stating "…nearly 96.1 percent of the 1.2 million households in the top one percent by income were white, a total of about 1,150,000 households. In addition, these families were found to have a median net asset worth of $8.3 million. In stark contrast, in the same piece, black households were shown as a mere 1.4 percent of the top one percent by income, that's only 16,800 homes. In addition, their median net asset worth was just $1.2 million. Using this data as an indicator only several thousand of the over 14 million African American households have more than $1.2 million in net assets… Relying on data from [[Credit Suisse]] and [[Brandeis University]]'s Institute on Assets and Social Policy, the ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' in the article "How America's Wealthiest Black Families Invest Money" recently took the analysis above a step further. In the piece the author stated "If you're white and have a net worth of about $356,000, that's good enough to put you in the 72nd percentile of white families. If you're black, it's good enough to catapult you into the 95th percentile." This means 28 percent of the total 83 million white homes, or over 23 million white households, have more than $356,000 in net assets. While only 700,000 of the 14 million black homes have more than $356,000 in total net worth." According to [http://inequality.org/racial-wealth-gap-worse-thought/ Inequality.org], the median black family is actually only worth $1,700 when you deduct these durables. In contrast, the median white family holds $116,800 of wealth using the same accounting methods. Some historical context: In South Africa, during the atrocities of apartheid, the median black family held about 7 percent of typical white South African family net worth. Today, using Wolff’s analysis, the median African American family holds a mere 1.5 percent of median white American family wealth.

A recent piece on Eurweb/Electronic Urban Report [http://www.eurweb.com/2016/10/opinion-black-wealth-hardly-exists-even-when-you-include-nba-nfl-and-rap-stars/ "Black Wealth Hardly Exists, Even When You Include NBA, NFL and Rap Stars"] stated this about the difference between black middle class families and white middle class families. "Going even further into the data, a recent study by the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS) and the Corporation For Economic Development (CFED) found that it would take 228 years for the average black family to amass the same level of wealth the average white family holds today in 2016. All while white families create even more wealth over those same two hundred years. In fact, this is a gap that will never close if America stays on its current economic path. According to the Institute on Assets and Social Policy, for each dollar of increase in average income an African American household saw from 1984 to 2009 just $0.69 in additional wealth was generated, compared with the same dollar in increased income creating an additional $5.19 in wealth for a similarly situated white household."

Author Lilian Singh wrote on why the perceptions about black life created by media are misleading in the ''[[American Prospect]]'' piece [https://prospect.org/article/black-wealth-tv-realities-don%E2%80%99t-match-perceptions "Black Wealth On TV: Realities Don’t Match Perceptions"]. "Black programming features TV shows that collectively create false perceptions of wealth for African-American families. The images displayed are in stark contrast to the economic conditions the average black family is battling each day."

In an article on ''[[HuffPost|Huffington Post]]'' by Antonio Moore [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/antonio-moore/the-decadent-veil-black-income-inequality_b_5646472.html "The Decadent Veil: Black America's Wealth Illusion"] the question of inequity is taken another critical step forward and the piece digs into how celebrity is masking this massive inequality. Excerpt: "The decadent veil looks at black Americans through a lens of group theory and seeks to explain an illusion that has taken form over a 30-year span of financial deregulation and new found access to unsecured credit. This veil is trimmed with million-dollar sports contracts, [[Roc Nation]] tour deals and designer labels made for heads of state. As black celebrity invited us into their homes through shows like MTV cribs, we forgot the condition of overall African American financial affairs. Despite a large section of the 14 million black households drowning in poverty and debt the stories of a few are told as if they represent those of millions, not thousands. It is this new veil of economics that has allowed for a broad swath of America to become not just desensitized to black poverty, but also hypnotized by black celebrity… The decadent veil not only warps the black community's vision outward to a larger economic world, but it also distorts outside community's view of Black America's actual financial reality."

According to an article by the Pew research Center, the median wealth of non-Hispanic black households fell nearly 38% from 2010 to 2013&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tripoetry.com/BEING-BLACK/FACTS/Wealth%20inequality%20has%20widened%20along%20racial,%20ethnic%20lines%20since%20end%20of%20Great%20Recession%20%7C%20Pew%20Research%20Center.pdf|title=Wealth inequality has widened along racial, ethnic lines since end of Great Recession|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. During that time, the median wealth of those households fell from $16,600 to $13,700. The median wealth of Hispanic families fell 14.3 % as well, from $16,000 to $14,000. Despite the median net worth of all households in the United States decreasing with time, as of 2013, white households had a median net worth of $141,900 while black house households had a median net worth of just $11,000&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Hispanic households had a median net worth of just $13,700 over that time as well.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In ''[[Capital in the Twenty-First Century]],'' French economist [[Thomas Piketty]] argues that "extremely high levels" of wealth inequality are "incompatible with the meritocratic values and principles of social justice fundamental to modern democratic societies" and that "the risk of a drift towards [[oligarchy]] is real and gives little reason for optimism about where the United States is headed."&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Piketty|Piketty, Thomas]] (2014).

According to Jedediah Purdy, a researcher at the Duke School of Law, the inequality of wealth in the United States has constantly opened the eyes of the many problems and shortcomings of its financial system over at least the last fifty years of the debate. For years, people believed that [[distributive justice]] would produce a sustainable level of wealth inequality. It was also thought that a certain state would be able to effectively diminish the amount of inequality that would occur. Something that was for the most part not expected is the fact that the inequality levels created by the growing markets would lessen the power of that state and prevent the majority of the political community from actually being able to deliver on its plans of distributive justice, however it has just lately come to attention of the mass majority.

The '''Załuski Library''' ({{lang-pl|Biblioteka Załuskich}}, {{lang-la|Bibliotheca Zalusciana}}) was built in [[Warsaw]] in 1747–1795 by [[Józef Andrzej Załuski]] and his brother, [[Andrzej Stanisław Załuski]], both [[Roman Catholic]] bishops. The library was the first Polish public library, the largest library in Poland, and one of the earliest public libraries in Europe.&lt;ref name="utoronto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fyifrance"/&gt;

After the [[Kościuszko Uprising]] (1794), Russian troops, acting on orders from Czarina [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]], seized the library's holdings and transported them to her personal collection at [[Saint Petersburg]], where a year later it formed the cornerstone of the newly founded [[Imperial Public Library]].&lt;ref name="fyifrance"/&gt;

In the 1920s the government of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] returned some of the former Załuski Library holdings to the recently established [[Second Polish Republic]] thanks to the [[Peace of Riga|Treaty of Riga]]. These holdings were deliberately destroyed by [[Nazi Germany|German]] troops during the [[planned destruction of Warsaw]] in October 1944, following the collapse of the [[Warsaw Uprising]].&lt;ref name="fyifrance"/&gt;&lt;ref name="knuth"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Vogel Załuski Library.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Załuski Library under construction, by [[Zygmunt Vogel|Vogel]]]]
[[File:DPK1 DSC0038.JPG|thumb|left|250px|"House of the Kings" today (''ul. Daniłowiczowska 14'', corner of ''ul. Hipoteczna 2'', [[Warsaw]])]]
The Załuski brothers' greatest passion was [[book]]s. [[Józef Andrzej Załuski]] and his brother [[Andrzej Stanisław Załuski]] acquired the collections of earlier Polish bibliophiles such as [[Jakub Zadzik]], [[Krzysztof Opaliński]], Tomasz Ujejski, [[Janusz Wiśniowiecki]], [[Jerzy Mniszech]] and [[Jan III Sobieski]] (the latter, from his granddaughter, [[Maria Karolina Sobieska]]).

From the 1730s the brothers planned the creation of a [[library]], and in 1747 they founded the Załuski Library (''Biblioteka Załuskich''). Located in the 17th-century Daniłowicz Palace in [[Warsaw]] (built for [[Mikołaj Daniłowicz]] of Żurów),&lt;ref name="fyifrance" /&gt;&lt;ref name="danilowiczowska"/&gt; the library building had two stories (the large reading room was on the second floor) and was topped with a small tower containing an astronomical [[observatory]].&lt;ref name="fyifrance" /&gt; The building's reconstruction in [[rococo]] style was accomplished in 1745 by [[Francesco Antonio Melana]] and his brother.&lt;ref name="50 lat Biblioteki Narodowej, Warszawa, 1928-1978 (50 years of the National Library, Warsaw, 1928-1978)"/&gt;

The Załuski Library was considered the first Polish [[public library]]&lt;ref name="Bygone Warsaw"/&gt; and one of the largest libraries in the contemporary world.&lt;ref name="fyifrance" /&gt; In all of Europe there were only two or three libraries that could boast such holdings.&lt;ref name="welcometo"/&gt; The library initially held some 200,000 items, which grew to some 400,000 printed items, [[map]]s and [[manuscript]]s&lt;ref name="fyifrance" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lancour"/&gt; by the end of the 1780s. It also accumulated a collection of art, scientific instruments, and plant and animal specimens.

This library, open on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 7:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., asked patrons to be quiet and to say a prayer in the intention of the Załuski brothers.&lt;ref name="welcometo" /&gt; It was prohibited to take the books outside the library, as the book theft was a growing problem, to an extent that the bishop patrons decided to ask the [[pope]] for help.&lt;ref name="welcometo" /&gt; Responding to their request, in 1752 pope [[Benedict XIV]] issued a [[papal bull]] that threatened to [[excommunication]] individuals taking the books from this library; even that did not eliminate the problem completely.&lt;ref name="welcometo" /&gt;
[[File:Exlibris Zaluski.jpg|thumb|150px|Załuski Library ''[[Bookplate|exlibris]]'']] 
After the brothers' deaths, the newly formed [[Commission for National Education]] took charge of the library, renaming it the Załuski Brothers' Library of the Republic.

Twenty years later in 1794, in the aftermath of the [[second Partition of Poland]] and [[Kościuszko Uprising]], Russian troops, on orders from Russian Czarina [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]], emptied&lt;ref name="fyifrance" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eduskrypt"/&gt; the library and dispatched the whole collection to [[Saint Petersburg]], where the books formed the mass of the [[Imperial Public Library]] on its formation, a year later.&lt;ref name="fyifrance" /&gt;&lt;ref name="A Splendor of Letters: The Permanence of Books in an Impermanent World"/&gt; Parts of the collections were damaged or destroyed as they were mishandled while being removed from the library and transported to Russia, and many were stolen.&lt;ref name="fyifrance" /&gt;&lt;ref name="welcometo" /&gt; According to the historian [[Joachim Lelewel]], the Zaluskis' books, "could be bought at [[Grodno]] by the basket".&lt;ref name="fyifrance" /&gt;

The collection was later dispersed among several Russian libraries. Some parts of the Zaluski collection came back to Poland on two separate dates in the nineteenth century: 1842 and 1863.&lt;ref name="fyifrance" /&gt; In the 1920s, in the aftermath of the [[Polish-Soviet War]] and the [[Treaty of Riga]]&lt;ref name="Lancour" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Holocaust and the Book: Destruction and Preservation."/&gt; the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|RSFSR]]'s government returned around 50,000 items from the collection to Poland,&lt;ref name="fyifrance" /&gt; yet [[Nazi Germany|German]] soldiers deliberately destroyed these items during the Planned destruction of Warsaw in October 1944, after collapse of the Warsaw Uprising.&lt;ref name="fyifrance" /&gt;&lt;ref name="knuth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="welcometo" /&gt; Only 1800 manuscripts and 30,000 printed materials from the original library survived the war.

In 1821 the library's original home was altered into a [[Kamienica (architecture)|tenement house]].&lt;ref name="danilowiczowska" /&gt; During the building's reconstruction, the [[Bust (sculpture)|busts]] of [[List of Polish monarchs|Polish monarchs]] that had originally adorned the library's interiors, and which had been hidden during the [[Partitions of Poland]], were discovered and placed on the building's facade; hence the building came to be called the "House of the Kings" (''Dom pod Królami'').&lt;ref name="danilowiczowska" /&gt;

The building was destroyed by the Germans during [[World War II]].  After the war, it was rebuilt under the [[Polish People's Republic]].&lt;ref name="danilowiczowska" /&gt;

Today's [[Polish National Library]] (''Biblioteka Narodowa''), founded in 1928,&lt;ref name="fyifrance" /&gt; considers itself the descendant of the Załuski Library.
