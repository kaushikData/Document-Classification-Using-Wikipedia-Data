{{Decadebox|199}}
The '''1990s''' (pronounced "nineteen-nineties" and abbreviated as the '''nineties''') was a decade of the [[Gregorian calendar]] that began on January 1, 1990, and ended on December 31, 1999.
{{TOC limit|3}}

==Overview==
Culturally, the 1990s are characterized by the rise of [[multiculturalism]] and [[alternative media]], which continued into the 2000s. Movements such as [[grunge]], the [[rave scene]] and [[hip hop]] spread around the world to young people during that decade, aided by then-new technology such as [[cable television]] and the [[World Wide Web]].

In the absence of [[world communism]], which collapsed in the first two years of the decade, the 1990s was politically defined by a movement towards the [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]], including increase in support for [[Far-right politics|far-right]] parties in Europe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=40aQAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA123|title=Right-wing Extremism in the Twenty-first Century|first1=Peter|last1=Merkl|first2=Weinberg|last2=Leonard|date=2 August 2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-76421-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the advent of the [[Hindu nationalism|Hindu nationalist]] Bharatiya Janata Party&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/india/113.htm|title=India – The Bharatiya Janata Party and the Rise of Hindu Nationalism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[welfare reform|cuts in social spending]] in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-12-27/local/me-13340_1_welfare-recipients|title=Which of Us Isn't Taking 'Welfare'? :  Poor children rank low in government largess; why is the comfortable class so mean?|first=RUTH|last=ROSEN|date=27 December 1994|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadiansocialresearch.net/1990s_welfare_reforms.htm|title=Provincial Welfare Reforms in the 1990s – Canadian Social Research Links|first=Gilles|last=Séguin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-0335.00283/abstract|title=Welfare Reform and Unemployment in New Zealand|journal=Economica|first=Tim|last=Maloney|date=1 May 2002|publisher=|volume=69|issue=274|pages=273–293|via=Wiley Online Library|doi=10.1111/1468-0335.00283}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/images/publications/welfare%20reform%202%20point%200.pdf|title=Policy Exchange – Shaping the Policy Agenda|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140121000433/http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/images/publications/welfare%20reform%202%20point%200.pdf|archivedate=21 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States also saw a massive revival in the use of the [[death penalty]] in the 1990s, which reversed in the early 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/12/19/report-us-executions-dipped-in-2013&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1990s the character of the [[European Union]] and [[Euro]] were formed and codified in [[Treaties of the European Union|treaties]].

A combination of factors, including the continued mass mobilization of [[capital market]]s through [[neo-liberalism]], the thawing of the decades-long [[Cold War]], the beginning of the widespread proliferation of [[new media]] such as the Internet from the middle of the decade onwards, increasing skepticism towards [[government]], and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] led to a realignment and reconsolidation of economic and political power across the world and within countries. The [[dot-com bubble]] of 1997–2000 brought wealth to some [[entrepreneur]]s before its crash between 2000 and 2001.

The 1990s saw extreme advances in technology, with the [[World Wide Web]], the first [[gene therapy]] trial, and the first [[designer babies]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=2330030|doi=10.1038/344768a0|volume=344|issue=6268|title=Pregnancies from biopsied human preimplantation embryos sexed by Y-specific DNA amplification|year=1990|journal=Nature|pages=768–70|last1=Handyside|first1=AH|last2=Kontogianni|first2=EH|last3=Hardy|first3=K|last4=Winston|first4=RM}}&lt;/ref&gt; all emerging in 1990 and being improved and built upon throughout the decade.

New ethnic conflicts emerged in Africa, the [[Balkans]], and the [[Caucasus]], the former two which led to the [[Rwandan genocide|Rwandan]] and [[Bosnian genocide]]s, respectively. Signs of any resolution of tensions between [[Israel]] and the [[Arab world]] remained elusive despite the progress of the [[Oslo Accords]], though [[The Troubles]] in Northern Ireland came to a standstill in 1998 with the [[Good Friday Agreement]] after 30 years of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stiglitz|first=Joseph E.|title=The Roaring Nineties|publisher=W.

==Politics and wars==
===Wars===
{{Main|List of wars 1990–2002}}
The most prominent [[armed conflict]]s of the decade include:

====International wars====
*The Congo wars break out in the 1990s:
**The [[First Congo War]] takes place in [[Zaire]] from 1996 to 1997, resulting in Zairian dictator [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] being overthrown from power on 16 May 1997, ending 32 years of his rule. [[Zaire]] is renamed the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].
**The [[Second Congo War]] starts in 1998 in central Africa and includes 50 different cultures and 7 different nations. It continued until 2003.

[[File:Gulf War Photobox.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Gulf War]].]]
*The [[Gulf War]] – Iraq was left in severe debt after the [[Iran–Iraq War|1980s war with Iran]]. President [[Saddam Hussein]] accused [[Kuwait]] of flooding the market with oil and driving down prices. As a result, on 2 August 1990, Iraqi forces [[invasion of Kuwait|invaded and conquered Kuwait]]. The UN immediately condemned the action, and a coalition force led by the United States was sent to the Persian Gulf. Aerial bombing of Iraq began in January 1991 (see also [[Gulf War]]), and a month later, the UN forces drove the Iraqi army from Kuwait in just four days. In the aftermath of the war, the Kurds in the north of Iraq and the Shiites in the south rose up in revolt, and Saddam Hussein barely managed to hold onto power. Until the US invasion in 2003, Iraq was cut off from much of the world.
*The Chechen wars break out in the 1990s:
**The [[First Chechen War]] (1994–1996) – the conflict was fought between the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] and the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]]. After the initial campaign of 1994–1995, culminating in the devastating [[Battle of Grozny (August 1996)|Battle of Grozny]], Russian federal forces attempted to seize control of the mountainous area of Chechnya but were set back by Chechen [[guerrilla warfare]] and raids on the flatlands in spite of Russia's overwhelming manpower, weaponry, and [[air support]]. The resulting widespread [[morale|demoralization]] of federal forces, and the almost universal opposition of the Russian public to the conflict, led [[Boris Yeltsin]]'s government to declare a [[ceasefire]] in 1996 and sign a [[peace treaty]] a year later.
**The [[Second Chechen War]] (1999 – ongoing) – the war was launched by the [[Russian Federation]] starting 26 August 1999, in response to the [[Invasion of Dagestan (1999)|Invasion of Dagestan]] and the [[Russian apartment bombings]] which were blamed on the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria|Chechens]]. During the war Russian forces largely recaptured the separatist region of [[Chechnya]].&lt;ref&gt;GlobalSecurity.org, [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/chechnya2.htm Second Chechnya War – 1999–???]&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign largely reversed the outcome of the [[First Chechen War]], in which the region gained de facto [[independence]] as the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]].
*The [[Kargil War]] (1999) – In May 1999, Pakistan sent troops covertly to occupy strategic peaks in [[Kashmir]]. A month later the [[Kargil War]] with India results in a political fiasco for Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]], followed by a Pakistani military withdrawal to the [[Line of Control]]. The incident leads to a military [[1999 Pakistani coup d'état|coup]] in October, in which Sharif is ousted by [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|Army Chief]] [[Pervez Musharraf]]. This conflict remains the only war fought between two declared nuclear powers.
[[File:Evstafiev-sarajevo-building-burns.jpg|150px|thumb|right|[[Greece–Bosnia and Herzegovina Friendship Building|Bosnian parliament building]] burns after being hit by Bosnian Serb artillery.]]
*The [[Yugoslav Wars]] (1991–1995) – The [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] beginning on 25 June 1991 after the republics of [[Croatia]] and [[Slovenia]] declared independence from [[Yugoslavia]] which was followed by the subsequent Yugoslav wars. The Yugoslav Wars would become notorious for numerous war crimes and human rights violations such as [[ethnic cleansing]] and [[genocide]] committed by all sides.
**[[Ten-Day War]] (1991) – a brief military conflict between Slovenian TO ([[Slovenian Territorial Defence]]) and the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) following [[Slovenia]]'s declaration of independence.
**[[Croatian War of Independence]] (1991–1995) – the war fought in hegh town [[Croatia]] between the Croatian government, having declared independence from the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], and both the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) and [[Serbs of Croatia|Serb]] forces, who established the self-proclaimed [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]] (RSK) within Croatia.
**[[Bosnian War]] (1992–1995) – the war involved several [[ethnicity|ethnically]] defined factions within Bosnia and Herzegovina: [[Bosniaks]], [[Serbs]] and [[Croats]] as well as [[Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia|a smaller Bosniak faction led by Fikret Abdić]]. The [[Siege of Sarajevo]] (1992–1995) marked the most violent [[urban warfare]] in Europe since World War II at that time as [[Serbs|Serb]] forces bombard and attack [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]] controlled and populated areas of the city. War crimes occur including [[ethnic cleansing]] and destruction of civilian property.
**The final fighting in Croatian and Bosnian wars ends in 1995 with the success of Croatian military offensives against Serb forces and the mass exodus of [[Serbs]] from Croatia in 1995; Serb losses to Croat and Bosniak forces; and finally the signing of the [[Dayton Agreement]] which internally partitioned Bosnia and Herzegovina into a [[Republika Srpska]] and a [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosniak-Croat federation]].
*[[Kosovo War]] (1998–1999) - the war between Albanian separatists and Yugoslav military and Serb paramilitary forces in [[Kosovo]] begins in 1996 and escalates in 1998 with increasing reports of atrocities taking place.
**In 1999, the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) led by the United States launched [[1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|air attacks]] against [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] (then composed of only [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]]) to pressure the Yugoslav government to end its military operations against Albanian separatists in [[Kosovo]] due to accusations of war crimes being committed by Yugoslav military forces working alongside nationalist Serb paramilitary groups. After weeks of bombing, Yugoslavia submits to NATO's demands and NATO forces occupy Kosovo and later UN peacekeeping forces to take control of Kosovo.

====Civil Wars and guerrilla wars====
[[File:Rwandan Genocide Murambi skulls.jpg|thumb|[[Rwandan Genocide]]: Genocide victims in Murambi Technical School. Estimates put the death toll of the Rwandan Genocide as high as 800,000 people.]]
*The [[Rwandan Genocide]] – between 6 April 1994 until mid-July 1994 a mass killing of hundreds of thousands of [[Rwanda]]'s [[Tutsis]] and [[Hutu]] political moderates occurred by the [[Hutu]] dominated government under the [[Hutu Power]] ideology. Over the course of approximately 100 days, at least 500,000 people were killed.&lt;ref name="A"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Des Forges|first=Alison|title=Leave None to Tell the Story: Genocide in Rwanda|publisher=Human Rights Watch|year=1999|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/rwanda|isbn=978-1-56432-171-8|accessdate=12 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of the [[death toll]] have ranged between 500,000 and 1,000,000,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1288230.stm Rwanda: How the genocide happened], [[BBC]], 1 April 2004, which gives an estimate of 800,000, and [https://www.un.org/ecosocdev/geninfo/afrec/subjindx/121rwan.htm OAU sets inquiry into Rwanda genocide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225085128/http://www.un.org/ecosocdev/geninfo/afrec/subjindx/121rwan.htm|date=25 February 2007 }}, Africa Recovery, Vol. 12 1#1 (August 1998), page 4, which estimates the number at between 500,000 and 1,000,000. 7 out of every 10 Tutsis were killed.&lt;/ref&gt; or as much as 20% of the total population of the country. It resulted in serious criticism of the United Nations and major countries for failing to stop the genocide.
*In [[Algeria]] a long period of violence in the north African country starts by the cancellation of the first ever held democratic elections by a group of high-ranking army officers.
*The [[Ethiopian Civil War]] ends in 1991, ending over twenty years of internal conflict. The end of the war coincides with the establishment of a coalition government of various factions.
*[[Oka Crisis]] takes place in 1990 involving an armed standoff between people of the [[Mohawk nation]] (North American [[indigenous peoples]] in Canada), and the Canadian military over a dispute involving land held via treaty to the Mohawk people.
*A large number of the Zapatista indigenous people of Mexico join the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] that begins armed conflict with the Mexican government in 1994 and continues through the 1990s.
*The [[Taliban]] seize control of [[Afghanistan]] in 1996.
*The [[1992 Los Angeles riots]] occurred, with 53 deaths and 5,500 property fires in a {{convert|100|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} riot zone. The riots were a result of the state court acquittal of three White and one Hispanic L.A. police officers by an [[all-white jury]] in a police brutality case involving motorist [[Rodney King]], but in 1993, all four officers were convicted in a federal civil rights case.

=====Canada=====
*Canadian politics is radically altered in the 1993 federal election with the collapse of the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]], (a major political party in Canada since 1867) from being in government to only 2 seats and the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] collapsing from 44 seats to 9. The [[Liberal Party of Canada]] is the only genuine national political party that remains while the regionally based parties such as the Quebec-based [[Bloc Québécois]] and the almost entirely Western Canada-based [[Reform Party of Canada]] rise from political insignificance to being major political parties.
*After the collapse of the [[Meech Lake Accord|Meech Lake constitutional accord]] in 1990, the province of [[Quebec]] in Canada experienced a rekindled wave of separatism by [[francophone]] [[Québécois people|Québécois]] nationalists, who sought for Quebec to become an independent country. In 1995, during a referendum on Quebec sovereignty, Quebec voters narrowly reject the vote for independence.
*The [[Quebec independence referendum, 1995|1995 Quebec referendum on sovereignty]] is held in the predominantly [[francophone]] province of [[Quebec]] in Canada, a majority [[anglophone]] country. If accepted Quebec would become an independent country with an economic association with Canada. The proposal is narrowly rejected by Quebec's voters by 50.4% no, and 49.6% yes.

=====Haiti=====
*[[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]] becomes the first democratically elected President of [[Haiti]] in 1990.

=====United States=====
*[[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Bill Clinton]] was a dominant political figure in international affairs during the 1990s known especially for his attempts to negotiate peace in the Middle East and end the ongoing wars occurring in the former Yugoslavia; his promotion of international action to decrease human-created [[climate change]]; and his endorsement of advancing [[free trade]] in the Americas.
*[[Lewinsky scandal]] – US president [[Bill Clinton]] was caught in a media-frenzied scandal involving inappropriate relations with a White House intern [[Monica Lewinsky]], first announced on 21 January 1998. After the United States House of Representatives [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|impeached Clinton]] on 19 December 1998 for perjury under oath, following an investigation by federal prosecutor [[Kenneth Starr]], the Senate acquitted Clinton of the charges on 12 February 1999 and he finished his second term.

*In 1990, the ending of the civil war and the return to political normalcy in [[Lebanon]] began. With the peace among all factions in Lebanon, the rebuilding of Lebanon and its capital, Beirut, started.
*[[Israel]]i Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] and [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] Prime Minister [[Yasser Arafat]] agree to the [[Israeli–Palestinian peace process]] at the culmination of the [[Oslo Accords]], negotiated by the [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Bill Clinton]] on 13 September 1993. By signing the Oslo accords, the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] recognize Israel's right to exist, while Israel permitted the creation of an autonomous [[Palestinian National Authority]] consisting of the [[Gaza Strip]] and [[West Bank]] which was implemented in 1994. Israeli military forces withdraw from the Palestinian territories in compliance with the accord, which marked the end of the [[First Intifada]] (a period of violence between Palestinian Arab militants and Israeli armed forces from 1987 to 1993).

*In July 1994, North Korean leader [[Kim Il-sung]] died, having ruled the country since its founding in 1948. His son [[Kim Jong-il]] succeeded him, taking over a nation on the brink of complete economic collapse. Famine caused a great number of deaths in the late '90s, and [[North Korea]] would gain a reputation for being a large source of money laundering, counterfeiting, and weapons proliferation. The country's ability to produce and sell nuclear weapons became a focus of concern in the international community.
*[[Aung San Suu Kyi]]'s [[National League for Democracy]] in Burma wins a majority of seats in the first free elections in 30 years in 1990, yet the Burmese [[military junta]] refuses to relinquish power, beginning an ongoing peaceful struggle throughout the 1990s to the present by Aung San Suu Kyi and her supporters to demand the end of military rule in Burma.

*[[German reunification]] – Germany reunified on 3 October 1990 as a result of the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] and after integrating the economic structure and provincial governments, focused on modernization of the former communist East. People who were brought up in a socialist culture became integrated with those living in capitalist western Germany.
*[[Margaret Thatcher]] who had been the United Kingdom's Prime Minister since 1979 resigned as Prime Minister on 22 November 1990 after being challenged for the leadership of the Conservative Party by [[Michael Heseltine]] because of widespread opposition to the introduction of the controversial [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|Community Charge]] and the fact that her key allies such as [[Nigel Lawson]] and [[Geoffrey Howe]] resigned over the deeply sensitive issues of the [[Maastricht Treaty]] and Margaret Thatcher's resistance to Britain joining the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]].

*The [[Downing Street Declaration]] 15 December 1993 by the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], [[John Major]], and the [[Taoiseach]] of Ireland, [[Albert Reynolds]] at the British Prime Minister's office in [[10 Downing Street]]. It affirmed both the right of the people of Ireland to [[self-determination]], and that [[Northern Ireland]] would be transferred to the [[Republic of Ireland]] from the United Kingdom only if a majority of its population was in favour of such a move. It included, as part of the prospective of the so-called "Irish dimension", the [[principle of consent]] that the people of the island of Ireland, had the exclusive right to solve the issues between North and South by mutual consent.&lt;ref&gt;

The joint declaration also pledged the governments to seek a peaceful constitutional settlement, and promised that parties linked with paramilitaries (such as [[Sinn Féin]]) could take part in the talks, so long as they abandoned violence.&lt;ref&gt;Cox &amp; Guelke, pp. 487–488&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved 9 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year the [[Government of Wales Act 1998|Government of Wales Act]] was passed by the [[United Kingdom parliament]], establishing the Assembly
*The [[Scottish Parliament]] established following a referendum in September 1997, the [[Scottish devolution referendum, 1997|1997 Scottish devolution referendum]] was put to the Scottish electorate and secured a majority in favour of the establishment of a new devolved Scottish Parliament, with tax-varying powers, in Edinburgh.&lt;ref name="ScotlandReferendum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/referendums/Scotland1997.cfm|title=Past Referendums – Scotland 1997|publisher=The Electoral Commission|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061207062754/http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/referendums/Scotland1997.cfm|archivedate=7 December 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; An election was held on 6 May 1999, and on 1 July of that year power was transferred from Westminster to the new Parliament.&lt;ref name="ScotlandElections"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons/lib/research/rp99/rp99-050.pdf|first=Bryn|last=Morgan|title=House of Commons Research Paper – Scottish Parliament Elections: 6 May 1999|date=8 October 1999|publisher=House of Commons Library|accessdate=17 November 2006|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*On 31 October 1999, [[EgyptAir Flight 990]], a [[Boeing 767]], crashed off the coast of [[Nantucket, Massachusetts]], killing 217.

==Economics==
*Many countries, institutions, companies, and organizations were prosperous during the 1990s. High-income countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, and those in Western Europe experienced steady economic growth for much of the decade. However, in the [[post-Soviet states|former Soviet Union]] GDP decreased as their economies restructured to produce goods they needed and some [[capital flight]] occurred.
*[[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade|GATT]] update and creation of the [[World Trade Organization]] and other global economic institutions, but opposition by anti-globalization activists showed up in nearly every GATT summit, like the demonstrations in [[Seattle]] in December 1999.
*The [[anti-globalization movement|anti-globalization]] protests at the [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999]] in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] began on 30 November 1999. This marks the beginning of a steady increase in anti-globalization protests which occurred in the first decade of the 21st century as well as increasing hostility to [[neoliberalism]].

'''North America'''
[[File:Dow jones.png|thumb|right|228px|The [[Dow Jones Industrial Average|Dow Jones Index]] of the 1990s.]]
*The decade is seen as a time of great prosperity in the United States, largely due to the unexpected advent of the Internet and the explosion of technology industries that came with it. The United States economy experiences its longest period of peace time economic expansion during the decade beginning in 1991. Personal incomes doubled from the recession in 1990, and there was higher productivity overall. The [[Wall Street]] [[stock exchange]] stayed over the 10,500 mark from 1999 to 2001.
*After the 1992 booming of the US [[stock market]], [[Alan Greenspan]] coined the phrase "[[irrational exuberance]]".
*The [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), which phases out trade barriers between the United States, Mexico, and Canada is signed into law by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]].

'''Asia'''
*The government of the People's Republic of China announces major privatization of state-owned industries in September 1997.
*China entered the '90s in a turbulent period, shunned by much of the world after the [[Tiananmen Square]] [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Massacre]] and controlled by hard line politicians who reigned in private enterprise and attempted to revive old-fashioned propaganda campaigns. Relations with the United States deteriorated sharply, and the Chinese leadership was further embarrassed by the disintegration of communism in Europe. In 1992, [[Deng Xiaoping]] travelled to southern China in his last major public appearance to revitalize faith in market economics and stop the country's slide back into [[Maoism]]. Afterwards, China recovered, and would experience explosive economic growth during the rest of the decade. In spite of this, dissent continued to be suppressed, and CPC General Secretary [[Jiang Zemin]] launched a brutal crackdown against the [[Falun Gong]] religious sect in 1999. Deng Xiaoping himself died in 1997 at the age of 93. Relations with the US deteriorated again in 1999 after the bombing of the Chinese embassy during the bombing of Serbia by NATO forces, which caused three deaths, and allegations of Chinese espionage at the Los Alamos Nuclear Facility.
*[[1997 Asian Financial Crisis|Financial crisis]] hits [[East Asia|East]] and Southeast Asia in 1997 and 1998 after a long period of phenomenal economic development, which continues by 1999. This crisis begins to be felt by the end of the decade.
*In Japan, after three decades of economic growth put them in second place in the world's economies, the situation worsened after 1993. The recession went on into the early first decade of the 21st century, bringing an end to the seemingly unlimited prosperity that the country had hitherto enjoyed.
*Less affluent nations such as India, [[Malaysia]], and [[Vietnam]] also saw tremendous improvements in economic prosperity and quality of life during the 1990s. Restructuring following the end of the Cold War was beginning. However, there was also the continuation of terrorism in [[Third World]] regions that were once the "frontlines" for American and Soviet foreign politics, particularly in Asia.

[[File:Boris Yeltsin with Bill Clinton-1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Boris Yeltsin]] and [[Bill Clinton]] share a laugh in October 1995.]]

'''Europe'''
*By 1990, Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s reforms were causing major inflation and economic chaos. A coup attempt by hard-liners in August 1991 failed, marking the effective end of the Soviet Union. All its constituent republics declared their independence in 1991, and on Christmas, Gorbachev resigned from office. After 73 years, the Soviet Union had ceased to exist. The new Russian Federation was headed by [[Boris Yeltsin]], and would face severe economic difficulty. Oligarchs took over Russia's energy and industrial sectors, reducing almost half the country to poverty. With a 3% approval rating, Yeltsin had to buy the support of the oligarchs to win reelection in 1996. Economic turmoil and devaluation of the ruble continued, and with heart and alcohol troubles, he stepped down from office on the last day of 1999, handing power to Vladimir Putin.
*Russian financial crisis in the 1990s results in mass hyperinflation and prompts economic intervention from the [[International Monetary Fund]] and western countries to help Russia's economy recover.
*The first [[McDonald's]] restaurant opens in Moscow in 1990 with then-President of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR and future Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] attending, symbolizing Russia's transition towards a capitalist [[free market]] economy and a move towards adopting elements of western culture.
*Oil and gas were discovered in many countries in the former Soviet bloc, leading to economic growth and wider adoption of trade between nations. These trends were also fueled by inexpensive fossil energy, with low petroleum prices caused by a glut of oil. Political stability and decreased militarization due to the winding down of the [[Cold War]] led to economic development and higher standards of living for many citizens.
*Most of Europe enjoyed growing prosperity during the '90s. However, problems including the massive 1995 general strikes in France following a recession and the difficulties associated with [[German reunification]] lead to sluggish growth in these countries. However, both the French and German economies improve in the latter half of the decade. Meanwhile, the economies of particularly Spain, [[Scandinavia]] and former [[Eastern Bloc]] countries accelerate at rapid speed during the decade although unemployment being mild due to many having experienced a deep recession for the start of the decade.
*After the [[early 1990s recession]], the United Kingdom and [[Celtic Tiger|Ireland]] experience rapid economic growth and falling unemployment that continues throughout the decade. Economic growth would continue until the [[Late 2000s recession]] marking the longest uninterrupted period of economic growth in history.
*Some Eastern European economies struggled after the fall of communism, but Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] saw healthy economic growth rates in the late 1990s.
*With the creation of the EU there is [[freedom of movement]] between member states, such as the 1992 and 1995 free trade agreements.
*The Euro is adopted by the European Union on 1 January 1999, which begins a process of phasing out national currencies of EU countries.

'''South America'''
*The sluggish economies of Brazil, by a new emphasis on free markets for all their citizens, and Mexico, under economist president [[Ernesto Zedillo]] elected in 1994, were in their best shape by the late 1990s.

===Technology===
{{See also|Timeline of computing 1990–1999}}
The 1990s were a revolutionary decade for digital technology. Between 1990 and 1997, individual [[personal computer]] ownership in the US rose from 15 to 35%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/archive/computer-ownership-up-sharply-in-the-1990s-pdf.pdf|title=Computer Ownership Up Sharply in the 1990s}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cell phones of the early-1990s and earlier ones were very large, lacked extra features, and were used by only a few percent of the population of even the wealthiest nations. Only a few million people used online services in 1990, and the [[World Wide Web]] had only just been invented. The first web browser went online in 1993&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/news/articles/13/02/1993/index2.html|title=Did 1993 Change Everything? – New York Magazine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 2001, more than 50% of some Western countries had Internet access, and more than 25% had cell phone access.

*Driven by mass adoption, consumer [[personal computer]] specifications increased dramatically during the 1990s, from 512 KB RAM 12&amp;nbsp;MHz [[White box (computer hardware)|Turbo XT]]s in 1990,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dzAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA5|title=InfoWorld Jan 8 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 25–66&amp;nbsp;MHz [[Intel 80486|80486]]-class processor at the start of the popularization of the World Wide Web mid-decade,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://winsupersite.com/article/commentary/blast-buying-computer-1995-141723|title=Blast from the Past: Buying a Computer in 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; to over 1&amp;nbsp;GHz CPUs with close to a [[gigabyte]] of RAM by 2000.
*[[Year 2000 problem|Y2K]] spread fear throughout the United States and eventually the world in the last half of the decade, particularly in 1999, about possible massive computer malfunctions on January 1, 2000. As a result, many people stocked up on supplies for fear of a worldwide disaster. After significant effort to upgrade systems on the part of software engineers, no failures occurred when the clocks rolled over into 2000.
*Advancements in [[Modem|computer modems]], [[Integrated Services Digital Network|ISDN]], [[cable modem]]s, and [[Digital subscriber line|DSL]] lead to faster connections to the Internet.
*The [[P5 (microarchitecture)|first Pentium microprocessor]] is introduced and developed by the [[Intel|Intel Corporation]].

*[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] in 1998 introduces the [[iMac]] all-in-one computer, initiating a trend in computer design towards translucent plastics and multicolor case design, discontinuing many [[legacy system|legacy technologies]] like [[serial port]]s, and beginning a resurgence in the company's fortunes that continues to this day.
*[[Optical disc drive|CD burner]] drives are introduced.
*The [[CD-ROM]] drive became standard for most personal computers during the decade.
*The DVD media format is developed and popularized along with a plethora of [[memory card|Flash memory card]] standards in 1994.
*[[Pager]]s are initially popular but ultimately are replaced by mobile phones by the early-2000s.
*Hand-held [[satellite phone]]s are introduced towards the end of the decade.
*The [[24-hour news cycle]] becomes popular with the [[Gulf War]] between late 1990 and early 1991 and CNN's coverage of [[Desert Storm]] and [[Operation Desert Shield (Gulf War)|Desert Shield]]. Though CNN had been running 24-hour newscasts since 1980, it was not until the Gulf War that the general public took large notice and others imitated CNN's non-stop news approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://birminghamskews.com/post/4544141336/this-truly-is-our-story|title=Archived copy|accessdate=2011-06-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324225107/http://birminghamskews.com/post/4544141336/this-truly-is-our-story|archivedate=24 March 2012|df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Microsoft]] introduces [[Windows 3.1]], [[Windows 95]], and [[Windows 98]] to the market, which gain immediate popularity.
*Macintosh [[System 7]] was released in 1991. For much of the decade, Apple would struggle to develop a next-generation operating system, starting with [[Copland (operating system)|Copland]] and culminating in its December 1996 buyout of [[NeXT]] and the 1999 release of [[Mac OS X Server 1.0]].
*The development of [[web browser]]s such as [[Netscape Navigator]] and [[Internet Explorer]] makes surfing the [[World Wide Web]] easier and more [[Usability|user friendly]].
*The [[Java (programming language)|Java programming language]] is developed by [[Sun Microsystems]] (now [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]).

====Eurostars====
The opening of the [[Channel Tunnel]] between France and the United Kingdom saw the commencement by the three national railway companies of Belgium, France and the United Kingdom, respectively [[National Railway Company of Belgium|SNCB/NMBS]], [[SNCF]] and [[British Rail]] of the joint [[Eurostar]] service.

[[File:Eurostar.svg|thumb|left|200px|Eurostar logo 1994–2011]]

&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:Gm-impact.jpg|thumb|right|The [[General Motors EV1]], sold during this decade, It was the first mass-produced and purpose-designed electric vehicle of the modern era from a major automaker, and the first GM car designed to be an electric vehicle from the outset.]] --&gt;

The 1990s began with another [[recession]] that dampened car sales. [[General Motors]] continued to suffer huge losses thanks to an inefficient structure, stale designs, and poor quality. Sales improved with the economy by the mid-1990s, but GM's US market share gradually declined to less than 40% (from a peak of 50% in the 1970s). While the new [[Saturn Corporation|Saturn]] division fared well, [[Oldsmobile]] declined sharply, and attempts to remake the division as a European-style luxury car were unsuccessful.

Cars in the 1990s had a rounder, more streamlined shape than those from the 1970s and 1980s; this style would continue early into the 2000s and to a lesser extent later on.

[[Chrysler]] ran into financial troubles again as the 1990s started. Like GM, the company too had a stale model lineup (except for the best-selling [[Chrysler minivans|minivans]]) that was largely based on the aging [[Chrysler K platform|K-car platform]]. In 1992, chairman [[Lee Iacocca]] retired, and the company began a remarkable revival, introducing the new [[Chrysler LH platform|LH platform]] and "Cab-Forward" styling, along with a highly successful redesign of the full-sized [[Dodge Ram]] in 1994. Chrysler's minivans continued to dominate the market despite increasing competition. In 1998, [[Daimler-Benz]] (the parent company of [[Mercedes-Benz]]) merged with Chrysler. The following year, it was decided to retire [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]], which had been on a long decline since the 1970s. [[Ford]] continued to fare well in the 1990s, with the [[Ford Taurus (second generation)|second]] and [[Ford Taurus (third generation)|third]] generations of the [[Ford Taurus]] being named the best selling car in the United States from 1992 to 1996. However, the Taurus would be outsold and dethroned by the [[Toyota Camry]] starting in 1997, which became the best selling car in the United States for the rest of the decade and into the 2000s. Ford also introduced the Ford Explorer, 1991 being the first model year. Fords Explorer became the best selling SUV on the market; out selling both the Chevy Blazer and Jeep Cherokee

Japanese cars continued to be highly successful during the decade. The [[Honda Accord]] vied with the Taurus most years for being the best-selling car in the United States during the early part of the decade. Although launched in 1989, the luxury brands [[Lexus]] and [[Infiniti]] began car sales of 1990 model year vehicles and saw great success. Lexus would go on to outsell Mercedes-Benz and BMW in the United States by 1991, and would outsell Cadillac and Lincoln by the end of the decade. SUVs and trucks became hugely popular during the economic boom in the second half of the decade. Many makes that had never built a truck before started selling SUVs. Car styling during the 1990s became gradually more round and ovoid, the [[Ford Taurus (third generation)|third-generation Taurus]] and [[Mercury Sable]] being some of the more extreme examples. Safety features such as [[airbag]]s and shoulder belts became mandatory equipment on new cars.

==Environment==
[[File:DeforestationinBrazil2.jpg|thumb|right|NASA satellite observation of deforestation in the Mato Grosso state of Brazil. The transformation from forest to farm is evident by the paler square shaped areas under development.]]
At the beginning of the decade, [[sustainable development]] and [[environmental protection]] became serious issues for governments and the international community. In 1987, the publication of the [[Brundtland Report]] by the United Nations had paved the way to establish an [[environmental governance]]. In 1992 the [[Earth Summit]] was held in Rio de Janeiro, in which several countries [[Rio Declaration on Environment and Development|committed]] to protect the environment, signing a [[Convention on Biological Diversity]].

The prevention of the destruction of the [[tropical rainforests]] of the world is a major environmental cause that first came into wide public concern in the early 1990s, and has continued and accelerated.

The [[Chernobyl disaster]] had [[Cultural impact of the Chernobyl disaster|significant impact on public opinion]] at the end of the 1980s, and the fallout was still causing cancer deaths well into the 1990s and possibly even into the 21st century.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} All along the 1990s, several [[environmental movement|environmental NGOs]] helped improve [[environmental awareness]] among public opinion and governments. The most famous of these organizations during this decade was [[Greenpeace]], which did not hesitate to lead illegal actions in the name of environmental preservation. These organizations also drawn attention on the [[Deforestation of the Amazon Rainforest|large deforestion]] of the [[Amazon Rainforest]] during the period.

[[Global warming]] as an aspect of [[climate change]] also became a major concern, and the creation of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) after the Earth Summit helped coordinate efforts to reduce carbon emissions in the atmosphere. From 1995, the UNFCCC held annual summits on climate change, leading to the adoption of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] in December 1997, a binding agreement signed by several developed countries.

==Society==
The 1990s represented continuing social liberalization in most countries, though coupled with an increase in the influence of capitalism, which would continue until the [[Great Recession]] of the late 2000s/early 2010s.

[[Youth subculture|Youth culture]] in the 1990s responded to this by embracing ''both'' environmentalism and [[entrepreneurship]]. Western world fashions reflected this by often turning highly [[individualism|individualistic]] and/or [[counterculture|counter-cultural]], which was influenced by [[Generation X]] and [[Millennials|Generation Y/Millennials]]: [[tattoo]]s and [[body piercing]] gained popularity, and "retro" styles inspired by fashions of the 1960s and 1970s were also prevalent. Some young people became increasingly involved in [[extreme sports]] and outdoor activities that combined embracing athletics with the appreciation of nature.

Those born in the 1990s are usually considered part of the [[Millennials|Millennial Generation]], along with those born in the late 1970s and 1980s. However, dates vary, with many demographers considering those born from 1995 onward as part of [[Generation Z]], the post-Millennial generation.&lt;ref name="McCrindleAU"&gt;[http://mccrindle.com.au/resources/whitepapers/McCrindle-Research_ABC-01_Generations-Defined_Mark-McCrindle.pdf Generations Defined] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616232732/http://mccrindle.com.au/resources/whitepapers/McCrindle-Research_ABC-01_Generations-Defined_Mark-McCrindle.pdf |date=16 June 2016 }}. Mark McCrindle&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[slacker]] and [[Valley Girl]] cultures were prevalent, and the decade was heavily influenced by [[Culture of California|Californian culture]].

In 1990, the [[World Health Organization]] removed homosexuality from its list of diseases. Increasing acceptance of homosexuality occurred in the western world, slowly starting in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/daily-dish/archive/2009/07/what-happened-in-1990/199110/|title=What Happened In 1990?|first=The Daily|last=Dish|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third-wave feminism===
[[File:3evague.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Women's rights demonstration in Paris, November 1995]]
*[[Anita Hill]] and other women testify before the [[United States Congress]] on being [[sexual harassment|sexually harassed]] by Supreme Court nominee [[Clarence Thomas]]. Thomas was narrowly confirmed by the [[United States Senate]], but Hill's testimony, and the testimony of other harassed women, begins a national debate on the issue.
*Record numbers of women are elected to high office in the United States in 1992, the "[[Year of the Woman]]".
*[[Violence against women]] takes center stage as an important issue internationally. In the United States the [[Violence Against Women Act]] was passed, which greatly affected the world community through the United Nations. The law's author, [[Joe Biden]], and UN Ambassador and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and Hillary Clinton (see below) become vocal advocates of action against violence against women.
*Women reach great heights of power in the United States government. [[Hillary Clinton]], leading policy proposals, traveling abroad as a State Department representative to 82 nations, advising her husband, and being elected a [[United States Senate|Senator]] (in 2000), is the most openly empowered and politically powerful [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] in American history; [[Madeleine Albright]] and [[Janet Reno]] take two of [[United States Cabinet|the cabinet]]'s top jobs as [[United States Secretary of State]] (#1), and [[United States Attorney General]] (#4), respectively. [[Sheila Widnall]] becomes head and [[United States Secretary of the Air Force|Secretary]] of the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] and [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] joins [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] as the second woman on the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]].
*More nations than ever before are led by elected women Presidents and Prime Ministers. Prime Minister [[Benazir Bhutto]]'s 1988 victory in Pakistan makes women leaders in Muslim states unextraordinary. In Turkey, [[Tansu Çiller]] became the first female prime minister in 1993 (till 1996).
*In popular culture, pop group the [[Spice Girls]] also played a part in the feminist movement, boosting popularity with their slogan "Girl Power!", while country music superstar [[Shania Twain]] declared female dominance in her 1995 hit song "[[Any Man of Mine]]."

[[File:Titanic Movie Cinema shooting. Airstar Lighting balloons.jpg|260px|thumb|The highest-grossing film of the decade was ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' (1997)]]
[[Dogme 95]] becomes an important European artistic motion picture movement by the end of the decade. The first full-length [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] movie, [[Pixar]]'s ''[[Toy Story]]'', is released, revolutionizing animated films. ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' becomes a cultural phenomenon throughout the world, and eventually becomes the highest-grossing film of all time, grossing over $1.8 billion worldwide. It would hold this record for over a decade until 2010 when director [[James Cameron]] had another one of his films take the title, that being ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Titanic (1997)|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=titanic.htm|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5h5sUMZQc?url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=titanic.htm|archivedate=27 May 2009|deadurl=no|accessdate=22 May 2009|df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The films produced by the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] became popular once more when the studio returned to making traditionally animated musical family classics such as ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', and ''[[The Lion King]]''. This era was known as the [[Disney Renaissance]].

The impact of boy band pop sensation [[Take That]] lead to the formation of other boy bands in the UK and Ireland such as [[East 17]] and [[Boyzone]]. Female pop icons [[Spice Girls]] took the world by storm, becoming the most commercially successful British group since [[The Beatles]], [[The Rolling Stones]] and [[Led Zeppelin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2007/10_october/19/spice.shtml|title=BBC – Press Office – New Spice Girls documentary on BBC One|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/31/newsid_2494000/2494855.stm|work=BBC News|title=1998: Ginger leaves the Spice Girls|date=31 May 1998|accessdate=29 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their global success brought about a widespread scene of teen pop acts around the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teen Pop Music: A Guide|url=http://top40.about.com/od/popmusic101/p/teenpop.htm|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jXPLbn7Q?url=http://top40.about.com/od/popmusic101/p/teenpop.htm|archivedate=4 September 2009|deadurl=no|accessdate=26 August 2009|df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/teen-pop-ma0000002895|website=[[AllMusic]]|title=Teen Pop|accessdate=17 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[All Saints (group)|All Saints]], [[Backstreet Boys]], [[Hanson (band)|Hanson]], [[N Sync]], [[Britney Spears]] and [[Christina Aguilera]] who came to prominence into the new millennium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/may/25/workandcareers.worklifebalance|work=The Guardian|location=UK|title=They don't live for work ... they work to live|date=25 May 2008|accessdate=21 July 2011|first1=Anushka|last1=Ashthana}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1991 also saw the death of [[Queen (band)|Queen]] frontman [[Freddie Mercury]] from AIDS-related pneumonia.

Contemporary [[R&amp;B]] and [[quiet storm]] continued in popularity among adult audiences, which began during the 1980s. Popular American contemporary R&amp;B artists included [[Celine Dion]], [[Mariah Carey]], [[D'Angelo]], [[Lauryn Hill]], [[Whitney Houston]], [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]], [[Sade (band)|Sade]], [[En Vogue]], [[TLC (band)|TLC]], [[Destiny's Child]], [[Toni Braxton]], [[Boyz II Men]], [[Dru Hill]], and [[Vanessa L. Williams]].

The [[Tibetan Freedom Concert]] brought 120,000 people together in the interest of increased human rights and autonomy for [[Tibet]] from China. [[Freddie Mercury]], [[Kurt Cobain]], [[Selena]], [[Tupac Shakur]], and [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] are the most publicized music-related deaths of the decade, in 1991, 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997 respectively.

[[Richey Edwards]] of the Manic Street Preachers was publicized in the media in 1991 following an incident involving [[Steve Lamacq]] backstage after a live show, in which Edwards carved '4 Real' into his arm. Edwards disappeared in 1995, which was highly publicized. He is still missing, but was presumed dead in 2008.

Controversy surrounded [[The Prodigy]] with the release of the track "[[Smack My Bitch Up]]". The National Organization for Women (NOW) claimed that the track was "advocating violence against women" due to the lyrics of that song. The music video (directed by Jonas Åkerlund) featured a first-person POV of someone going clubbing, indulging in drugs and alcohol, getting into fist fights, abusing women and picking up a prostitute. At the end of the video the camera pans over to a mirror, revealing the subject to be a woman.

1994 became a breakthrough year for [[punk rock in California]], with the success of bands like [[Bad Religion]], [[Social Distortion]], [[Blink-182]], [[Green Day]], [[The Offspring]], [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]], and similar groups following. This success would continue to grow over the next decade, the 2000s. The 1990s also became the most important decade for [[ska punk]]/[[reggae fusion|reggae rock]], with the success of many bands like [[Buck-O-Nine]], [[Goldfinger (band)|Goldfinger]], [[Less Than Jake]], [[The Mighty Mighty Bosstones]], [[Murphy's Law (band)|Murphy's Law]], [[No Doubt]], [[Reel Big Fish]], [[Save Ferris]], [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]] and [[Sugar Ray]].

The [[rave]] movement that emerged in the late 1980s rose. Rave spawned genres such as [[Intelligent dance music]] and [[Drum and bass]]. The latter is an offshoot of jungle techno and [[Breakbeat hardcore|breakbeat]]. Popular artists included [[Moby]], [[Fatboy Slim]], [[Björk]], [[Aphex Twin]], [[Orbital (band)]], [[The Orb]], [[Chemical Brothers]], [[Basement Jaxx]], [[Todd Terry]], [[808 State]], [[Primal Scream]], [[The Shamen]], [[The KLF]] and [[The Prodigy]].

The rise of [[industrial music]], somewhat a fusion of [[synthpop]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], rose to worldwide popularity with bands like [[Godflesh]], [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[Rammstein]], [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]] and [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]]. [[Groove metal]] was born through the efforts of [[Pantera]], whose seventh studio album ''[[Far Beyond Driven]]'' (1994) was notable for going number one on [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Another heavy metal subgenre called nu metal, which mixed metal with hip hop influences, becomes popular with bands like [[Korn]], [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]] and [[Limp Bizkit]] selling millions of albums worldwide. [[Metallica]]'s 1991 eponymous album ''[[Metallica (album)|Metallica]]'' is the best-selling album of the [[Soundscan|SoundScan]] era, while [[extreme metal]] acts such as [[Death (metal band)|Death]], [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]], [[Darkthrone]], [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]], [[Cannibal Corpse]] and others experienced popularity throughout the decade.

In the 1990s, country music became a worldwide phenomenon thanks to [[Billy Ray Cyrus]], [[Shania Twain]], and [[Garth Brooks]].&lt;ref name="Country Worldwide"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0LYxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_OIFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1510,3298161&amp;dq=billy+ray+cyrus+country+worldwide&amp;hl=en|title=Country is No. 1 musical style|date=19 August 1992|publisher=Reading Eagle|accessdate=26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Country Worldwide2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TjQfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=B88EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4760,3698051&amp;dq=billy+ray+cyrus+country+worldwide&amp;hl=en|title=Country music reflects the time|date=27 September 1992|publisher=Herald-Journal|accessdate=26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Country Worldwide3"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/504338431.html?dids=504338431:504338431&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Nov+25%2C+1993&amp;author=Jack+Hurst&amp;pub=The+Record&amp;desc=Country+music+is+making+waves+across+the+seas&amp;pqatl=google|title=Country music is making waves across the seas|date=25 November 1993|publisher=thestar.com|accessdate=26 July 2010|first=Jack|last=Hurst}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter enjoyed one of the most successful careers in popular music history, breaking records for both sales and concert attendance throughout the decade.

Female artists such as [[Reba McEntire]], [[Faith Hill]], [[Martina McBride]], [[Deana Carter]], [[LeAnn Rimes]], and [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]] all released platinum selling albums in the 1990s. The [[Dixie Chicks]] became one of the most popular country bands in the 1990s and early 2000s.

In early 1993, one of the last [[western (genre)|westerns]] ever to air on television was ''[[Walker, Texas Ranger]]'', a [[crime drama]] which also starred [[Chuck Norris]] as the title character. Lasting for 9 seasons, the show tackled a wide variety of subjects, and was one of the few shows ever to perform karate.

1993 also saw its debut of the [[medical]]–[[:wikt:mystery|mystery]] drama, ''[[Diagnosis Murder]]'', a comeback vehicle for [[Dick Van Dyke]], who guest-starred on an episode of its sequel, ''[[Jake and The Fatman]]'', where the show got off to a rocky start, and became one of television's long-running mysteries, that lasted until its cancelation in 2001.

Medical dramas started to come into television in the '90s. One show stood out as a critical and ratings success for [[NBC]]. In 1994, ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', which starred [[Anthony Edwards]] and [[George Clooney]], was a domestic and international success, lasting until 2009 and spawning series such as ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' (2005–present). It made [[NBC]] the most watched channel in the United States.{{citation needed|date= March 2011}} This show launched the career of [[George Clooney]]. That same year, ''[[Chicago Hope]]'', that starred [[Héctor Elizondo]], [[Mandy Patinkin]] and [[Adam Arkin]], was also a popular series for [[CBS]], lasting between 1994 and 2000.

''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'' ran on Fox from 1990 to 2000. It established the teen soap genre paving the way for ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'', ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', and other shows airing in later years. The show was then remade and renamed simply ''[[90210 (TV series)|90210]]'' and premiered in 2008. ''Beverly Hills, 90210'' spun-off ''[[Melrose Place]]'', a popular TV show that dominated throughout the '90s as well. ''[[Baywatch]]'', a popular TV show that dominated throughout the '90s, became the most watched TV show in history and influenced pop culture.

''[[Sex and the City]]'''s frank portrayal of relationships and sexuality caused controversy and acclaim, leading to a new generation of sexually progressive television shows that would be seen in the 2000s.

Fantasy was popular on television, with CBS airing ''[[Touched By an Angel]]'', beginning in 1994. The series was intended as the comeback vehicle of [[Della Reese]], and also launched the career of [[Roma Downey]]. It wasn't an immediate hit, and was canceled the following year, but revived the following year, thanks to die hard fans who approached a letter-writing campaign, where it ran for 8 more seasons.

Crime drama and police detective shows returned after soap-operas died down. After the successful debuts of ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'', ''[[NYPD Blue]]'' and ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]]'', ''[[Nash Bridges]]'', a comeback vehicle for [[Don Johnson]], lasting 6 seasons (1996–2001) which also dealt with escapist entertainment, rather than tackling issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-04-25/entertainment/ca-62314_1_miami-vice|title=With a New Beat and Attitude, the 'Vice' Man Cometh|first=HEATHER|last=McCABE|date=25 April 1996|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reality television began on MTV; this would grow in importance in the western world into the next decade.

During the mid-1990s, two of the biggest professional wrestling companies: ''[[World Championship Wrestling]]'' and ''[[World Wrestling Federation]]'' were in a ratings battle that was dubbed the Monday Night Wars (1995–2001). Each company fought to draw more viewers to their respective Monday night wrestling show. The "War" ended in 2001 when ''[[WWE]]'' bought ''[[WCW]]''. In November 2001, there was a Winner Takes All match with both companies in a Pay-Per-View called ''[[Survivor Series]]''. WWF won the match; putting a final end to WCW.

As an animated sitcom, ''[[The Simpsons]]'', debuted in December 1989, became a domestic and international success in the 1990s. The show has aired more than 600 episodes and has become an institution of pop culture. It has spawned the adult-oriented [[animated sitcom]] genre, inspiring racier shows such as ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]'' (1993–1997), ''[[Daria]]'' (1997–2001), along with ''[[South Park]]'' and ''[[Family Guy]]'', the latter two of which began in 1997 and 1999 respectively and continue to air new episodes through the 2000s and into the 2010s.

[[Anime]] was popular in the 1980s, and expanded to a worldwide audience by the 1990s, for its expansive spectrum of story subjects and themes not limited to comedy and superhero action found in the US, and well produced, and well written, visual and story content, that held emotional and intellectual depth and integrity to its viewers, and which also expanded to older and adult ages in the medium of [[animation]]. TV shows such as ''[[Sailor Moon]]'', ''[[Digimon]]'', ''[[Pokémon]]'', ''[[Tenchi Muyo!]]'', ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'', ''[[Gundam Wing]]'', ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'', ''[[Ranma 1/2]]'', ''[[Dirty Pair]]'', ''[[Slayers]]'', ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'', ''[[Gunsmith Cats]]'', to anime movies such as ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'', ''[[Vampire Hunter D]]'', ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]'', ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'', ''[[Castle in the Sky]]'', ''[[The Castle of Cagliostro]]'', and imports by various distributors such as [[Viz Media|Viz]], [[AnimEigo]], [[Central Park Media]], [[A.D. Vision]], [[Pioneer Corporation|Pioneer Entertainment]], [[Media Blasters]], [[Manga Entertainment]], and [[Celebrity Home Entertainment|Celebrity]], helped begin the mid to late 1990s and early to mid-1900s introductory anime craze in the US, and the [[Cartoon Network]] anime block [[Toonami]] in 1997.

Nickelodeon's first animated series (''[[Doug (TV series)|Doug]]'', ''[[Rugrats]]'', ''[[The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show]]'') debuted in 1991. One of Nickelodeon's most popular and longest running series, ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', started in 1999 and became a huge success.

American animated children's programs went through a renaissance during the decade with studios producing many critically acclaimed shows. Examples include ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'', ''[[Animaniacs]]'', ''[[Phantom 2040]]'', ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', and ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]''.

The late 90s also saw the evolution of a new TV genre: primetime game shows, popularized by the game show ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'', hosted by [[Regis Philbin]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], as well as other first-run game shows aired in primetime on the newly launched [[Game Show Network]].

===Video games===
{{main|1990s in video gaming}}
Popular notable video games of the 1990s include: ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'', ''[[Super Mario World]]'', ''[[Donkey Kong Country]]'', [[Pokémon Red and Blue|''Pokémon Red'' and ''Blue'' Versions]], ''[[Pokémon Yellow|Pokémon Yellow Version]]'', ''[[GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)|GoldenEye 007]]'', ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]]'', ''[[Gran Turismo (video game)|Gran Turismo]]'', ''[[Mario Kart 64]]'', ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'', ''[[Super Mario Kart]]'', ''[[Star Fox (video game)|Star Fox]]'' (series), ''[[Tomb Raider]]'' series, ''[[Final Fantasy (series)|Final Fantasy]]'', ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series, ''[[Crash Bandicoot (series)|Crash Bandicoot]]'' series, ''[[Resident Evil (series)|Resident Evil]]'' series, ''[[Street Fighter II]]'', ''[[Spyro the Dragon (series)|Spyro the Dragon]]'' series, ''[[Commander Keen]]'' series, ''[[Test Drive (series)|Test Drive]]'' series, ''[[Monkey Island (series)|Monkey Island]]'' series, ''[[Dune computer and video games|Dune]]'' series, ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'' series, ''[[Warcraft]]'' series, ''[[Duke Nukem 3D]]'', ''[[Tekken (series)|Tekken]]'' series, ''[[EarthBound]]'', and ''[[StarCraft]]''.

Sony's [[PlayStation]] becomes the top selling game console and changes the standard media storage type from [[ROM cartridge|cartridges]] to [[compact disc]]s in consoles. [[Crash Bandicoot (video game)|Crash Bandicoot]] is released on 9 September 1996, becoming one of the most successful platforming series for the Sony PlayStation. ''[[Tomb Raider]]''{{'}}s (PlayStation) [[Lara Croft]] became a video game sex symbol, becoming a recognizable figure in the entertainment industry throughout the late 1990s.

[[3D computer graphics|3-D]] graphics become the standard by end of decade. Although [[First-person shooter|FPSs]] had long since seen the transition to full 3D, other genres begin to copy this trend by the end of the decade. Most notable first shooter games in the 1990s are ''[[GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)|GoldenEye 007]]'' and ''[[Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six (video game)|Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six]]''.

The [[console wars]], primarily between [[Sega]] (Mega Drive, marketed as the [[Sega Genesis]] in North America, introduced in 1988) and [[Nintendo]] ([[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]], introduced in 1990), sees the entrance of [[Sony]] with the [[PlayStation]] in 1994, which becomes the first successful CD-based console (as opposed to [[ROM cartridge|cartridges]]). By the end of the decade, Sega's hold on the market becomes tenuous after the end of the [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]] in 1999 and the [[Dreamcast]] in 2002.

[[Mario]] as [[Nintendo]]'s [[mascot]] finds a rival in [[Sega]]'s [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]] with the release of ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' on the Genesis in 1991.

Fighting games like [[Capcom]]'s ''[[Street Fighter II]]'', [[Sega]]'s futuristic ''[[Virtua Fighter (arcade game)|Virtua Fighter]]'', and especially the more violent ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' from [[Midway Games|Midway]] prompted the video game industry to adopt a game rating system. Hundreds of knock-offs are widely popular in the mid-to-late 1990s. ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' (1993) bursts onto the world scene, and instantly popularizes the [[First-person shooter|FPS]] genre, and even how games are played, as ''Doom'' is among the first games to feature multiplayer capabilities. It isn't until ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'' (1996), however, that game developers begin to take multiplayer features into serious consideration when making games. ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' (1998) features the next evolutionary step in the genre with continual progression of the game (no levels in the traditional sense) and an entirely in-person view, and becomes one of the most popular computer games in history.

The [[real-time strategy]] (RTS) genre is introduced in 1992 with the release of ''[[Dune II]]''. ''[[Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans]]'' (1994) popularizes the genre, with ''[[Command &amp; Conquer]]'' and ''[[Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness]]'' in 1995, setting up the first major real-time strategy competition and popularizing multiplayer capabilities in RTS games. ''[[StarCraft]]'' in 1998 becomes the second best-selling computer game of all time. It remains among the most popular multiplayer RTS games to this day, especially in [[South Korea]]. ''[[Homeworld]]'' in 1999 becomes the first successful 3d RTS game. The rise of the RTS genre is often credited with the fall of the [[turn-based strategy]] (TBS) genre, popularized with ''[[Civilization (video game)|Civilization]]'' in 1991. ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]'' debuted (in North America) in 1990 for the NES, and remains among the most popular video game [[Final Fantasy|franchises]], with many new titles to date and more in development, plus numerous spin-offs, sequels, films and related titles. ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'', released in 1997, especially popularized the series.

[[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]s (MMORPGs) see their entrance into the computer game world with ''[[Ultima Online]]'' in 1997, although they don't gain widespread popularity until ''[[EverQuest]]'' and ''[[Asheron's Call]]'' in 1999. MMORPGs go on to become among the most popular genres in the first decade of the 21st century.

''[[Pokémon]]'' enters the world scene with the release of the original [[Game Boy]] ''[[Pokémon Red and Blue|Pokémon Red]]'' and ''[[Pokémon Red and Blue|Pokémon Green]]'' games in Japan in 1996, later changed to ''[[Pokémon Red and Blue|Pokémon Red]]'' and ''[[Pokémon Red and Blue|Pokémon Blue]]'' for worldwide release in 1998. It soon becomes popular in the United States, spurring the term Pokémania and is adapted into a popular [[anime]] series and [[trading card]] game, among other media forms.

''[[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|Resident Evil]]'' is released in 1996. It becomes the most popular survival-horror series in video gaming well into the next decade and inspires several films.

''[[Crash Bandicoot (video game)|Crash Bandicoot]]'' is released in September 1996, becoming an innovative platformer for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]].

While at the time it was possible to share files in other ways via the Internet (such as [[IRC]] and [[USENET]]), Napster was the first software to focus exclusively on sharing MP3 files. Napster was eventually forced to shutdown in July 2001 to prevent further copyright violations.

{{Campaignbox Northern Ireland Troubles|state=collapsed}}
From 6 to 11 July 1997 there were mass protests, fierce riots and gun battles in [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalist]] districts of [[Northern Ireland]]. Irish nationalists/[[Irish republicanism|republicans]], in some cases supported by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (PIRA), attacked the police ([[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] – RUC) and [[British Army]]. The protests and violence were sparked by the decision to allow the [[Orange Order]] (a Protestant, [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] organization) to march through a Catholic/nationalist neighbourhood of [[Portadown]]. Irish nationalists were outraged by the decision and by the RUC's aggressive treatment of those protesting against the march. There had been a bitter [[Drumcree conflict|dispute over the march]] for many years.

It was the last spell of widespread violence in Northern Ireland before the signing of the [[Good Friday Agreement]] in April 1998. The security forces were attacked hundreds of times by rioters throwing stones and [[petrol bomb]]s, and by IRA members with automatic rifles and grenades. They fired more than 2,500 [[plastic bullet]]s at rioters and exchanged gunfire with the IRA. More than 100 civilians and 65 security force personnel were injured. There were many complaints of [[police brutality]] and a 13-year-old boy went into a coma after being struck on the head by a plastic bullet. Hundreds of burning vehicles were used to block roads. The RUC and the British Army had to withdraw entirely from some nationalist areas of [[Belfast]]. The Provisional IRA's involvement in the clashes was its last major action during [[Provisional Irish Republican Army campaign 1969–1997|its 27-year campaign]]. The paramilitary organization declared its last ceasefire on 19 July.

== Background ==
{{Main article|Drumcree conflict}}
The Orange Order is a Protestant, [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] [[Fraternity|fraternal organization]]. It insists that it should be allowed to [[Orange walk|march its traditional route]] to-and-from [[Drumcree Church]] each July. It had marched this route since 1807, when the area was mostly farmland. However, today most of this route is through the mainly Catholic/[[Irish nationalist]] part of Portadown. The residents sought to re-route the march away from their area, seeing it as "[[triumphalism|triumphalist]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/342901.stm "Drumcree tension eases"]. BBC News. 13 May 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[supremacism|supremacist]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120905134042/http://www.independent.ie/national-news/big-changes-in-character-of-drumcree-dispute-437818.html "Big changes in character of Drumcree dispute"]. ''[[Irish Independent]]''. 3 July 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; They likened it to a [[Ku Klux Klan]]  march through an [[African American]] neighbourhood.&lt;ref&gt;Hayden, Tom. ''Irish on the Inside: In Search of the Soul of Irish America''. Verso, 2003. p.218&lt;/ref&gt;

The march was first banned in 1832,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6qZFAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA8&amp;lpg=RA1-PA8&amp;dq=party+processions+act+1832&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NXkIInguwK&amp;sig=Q7DxtAtL-qam0sVdgux0y5E607k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=party%20processions%20act%201832&amp;f=false|title=The Statutes of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|last=Britain|first=Great|date=1832|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the law was ignored by the Orangemen. Local magistrate William Hancock wrote in 1835: "For some time past the peaceable inhabitants of the parish of Drumcree have been insulted and outraged by large bodies of Orangemen parading the highways, playing party tunes, firing shots, and using the most opprobrious epithets they could invent... a body of Orangemen marched through the town and proceeded to Drumcree church, passing by the Catholic chapel though it was a considerable distance out of their way."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/people/accounts/mckay00.htm|title=CAIN: Susan McKay (2000) Northern Protestants: An Unsettled People|last=Melaugh|first=Dr Martin|website=cain.ulst.ac.uk|access-date=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The onset of [[the Troubles]] in 1969 led to the dispute intensifying.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} In 1987, the Orangemen were banned from marching along Obins Street, after their march caused severe rioting two years in a row.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/csc/reports/rituals4.htm Bryan, Fraser, Dunn. ''Political Rituals: Loyalist Parades in Portadown – Part 4 – 1985 &amp; 1986''] CAIN&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Orangemen were still allowed to march along the other main road in the Catholic area, the Garvaghy Road.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, Eric P. ''The Orange Order: A contemporary Northern Irish History''. Oxford University Press, 2007. p 155&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Drumcree Church 2018-07-26 - 1.jpg|thumb|220px|Drumcree Church near Portadown]]
In 1995, residents formed the Garvaghy Road Residents Coalition (GRRC) to try and divert the march away from Garvaghy Road. The dispute escalated that July when residents blocked Garvaghy Road for two days. Orangemen and their supporters clashed with the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC) until the residents were persuaded to clear the road and the march went ahead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/parade/develop.htm#1 |title=CAIN – Events in Drumcree – July 1995 |publisher=University of Ulster |accessdate=12 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The July 1996 march was banned from Garvaghy Road. Thousands of Orangemen and their supporters gathered at Drumcree and there was a three-day standoff with the RUC. They held large protests and attacked the police and Catholics throughout Northern Ireland. The [[Loyalist Volunteer Force]] (LVF) shot dead a Catholic taxi driver and threatened further attacks. As a result, the ban was lifted. Police violently removed nationalist protesters from Garvaghy Road and forced the march through. This sparked days of rioting in Catholic/nationalist areas of Northern Ireland; one protester was crushed to death by a British Army armoured vehicle in [[Derry]] (see [[1996 Derry riots]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/parade/develop.htm#2 |title=CAIN – Events in Drumcree – July 1996 |publisher=University of Ulster |accessdate=12 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anti Orange Order sign in Rasharkin.jpg|thumb|right|170px|A placard against Orange marches in Catholic/nationalist areas]]
On 18 June 1997 [[Alistair Graham]] warned after the killing of two RUC officers in nearby [[Lurgan]] that the IRA was seeking to raise tensions before the march so that a compromise would be impossible.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4HRIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=xgINAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1438,3110289&amp;dq=portadown-road-appears&amp;hl=en "Portadown road appears a likely battle ground"] by Shawn Pogatchnik. Associated Press, 18 June 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1997, [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland|Secretary of State]] [[Mo Mowlam]] had privately decided to let the march proceed.&lt;ref name="CAIN 1997"/&gt; However, in the days leading up to the march, she insisted that no decision had been made.&lt;ref name="CAIN 1997"/&gt; She met [[Taoiseach]] [[Bertie Ahern]], who stressed that any unilateral decision to allow the march would be 'a mistake'. The RUC and the [[Northern Ireland Office]] said they would announce their decision two or three days before the march.&lt;ref name=Jul/&gt;

As the parade day approached, thousands more British troops were flown into Northern Ireland, while thousands of people left the province fearing another outbreak of violence.&lt;ref name=Jul/&gt; Garvaghy Road residents set up a [[peace camp]] along the road.&lt;ref name="CAIN 1997"/&gt; The [[Loyalist Volunteer Force]] (LVF) threatened to kill Catholic civilians if the march was not allowed to proceed&lt;ref name="CAIN 1997"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/parade/develop.htm#9 |title=Events in Drumcree: July 1997 |publisher=[[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] (CAIN) |accessdate=19 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] also threatened to withdraw from the [[Northern Ireland peace process]] negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;Jess, Mervyn.

After it passed, the security forces began withdrawing from the area and severe rioting erupted. They were attacked by hundreds of nationalists with stones, bricks and petrol bombs. About 40 [[plastic bullet]]s were fired at rioters, and about 18 people had to be hospitalised.&lt;ref name="CAIN 1997"/&gt;

=== Sunday 6 July ===

Violence erupted across Northern Ireland that evening as news from Portadown reached nationalist areas.&lt;ref name=rep/&gt; Unionist politicians accused the IRA of starting the riots.&lt;ref name=streets&gt;[http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1997/Anarchy-reigns-in-Catholic-parts-of-Northern-Ireland/id-ae8735d862aeaac7d8c1a91adb0abf28 "Anarchy reigns in Catholic parts of Northern Ireland"].

During the weekend alone, the IRA carried out at least nine attacks on British troops.&lt;ref name=streets/&gt;

; Belfast

In South Belfast, a lone IRA member with an [[AK-47]] opened-fire on an RUC checkpoint at Lower Ormeau Road. Five rounds hit an APC parked on the Ormeau Bridge. The attack was filmed by a BBC television crew.&lt;ref name=10ira/&gt; Nearby, an IRA unit prevented a riot squad from entering the [[Market Quarter, Belfast|Markets area]] after firing 20 rounds at them.&lt;ref name=10ira/&gt;

In North Belfast, several British Army patrols were harassed by gunfire&lt;ref name=streets/&gt; and a bomb was thrown at an RUC base.&lt;ref name=her/&gt; An armoured vehicle was set on fire in Ardoyne, according to republican sources. Another one was burnt-out on [[Antrim Road]]. Late that evening in the Oldpark area, an RUC Land Rover became stuck in a barricade made of iron pilings and its crew had to flee when it was attacked with petrol bombs.&lt;ref name=10nbr/&gt;

In the Lenadoon area of West Belfast, the RUC shot a 14-year-old boy&lt;ref name=irishtimes8jul&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ruc-lists-over-100-injured-in-disturbances-1.88831 "RUC lists over 100 injured in disturbances"].

There was violence at the interface on Lanark Way, which separates the loyalist [[Shankill Road|Shankill]] and republican [[Falls Road, Belfast|Falls]] districts.

=== Tuesday 8 July ===

On 8 July, a document was leaked to the press which hinted that Mo Mowlan had decided in June to allow the Drumcree march to proceed. This caused further outrage among nationalists. That day, residents announced that they would block the Orange Order's [[The Twelfth|12 July parades]] in Armagh, Newry, Bellaghy, Lower Ormeau Road (Belfast), Derry and Strabane.&lt;ref name=Jul/&gt;

An RUC source confirmed that the IRA had carried out more than a dozen gun and grenade attacks since 6 July, while 250 vehicles had been burnt.&lt;ref name=burn/&gt; The Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) threatened to attack Orangemen whom it considered responsible for forcing parades through nationalist neighbourhoods.&lt;ref name=Jul/&gt;

====Belfast====

The IRA's [[Provisional IRA Belfast Brigade|Belfast Brigade]] claimed that dozens of its members were involved in operations against the security forces in West and North Belfast since Sunday.&lt;!-- The main source, An Phoblacht, doesn't give an actual date for these actions, just a loose timeline. While Shawn Pogatchnik AP's article (see below) reports a major gun battle in North Belfast during the first hours of Tuesday, the Glasgow Herald of 7 July describes what seems to be the shot out at Crumlin Road, then this should have taken place on Sunday. Unfortunately, there were countless minor engagements throughout the week, thus a precise date for some of the actions could be impossible to find --&gt;

In the Ardoyne area of North Belfast, there was a shootout between IRA members and an RUC mobile patrol, without casualties. Later, an IRA volunteer fired 15 shots at a British soldier who was firing plastic bullets at rioters in Ardoyne. According to a republican report, this action was filmed by an independent television crew. The IRA also allegedly shot two loyalists who were throwing petrol bombs at Catholic homes there. Nearby, there was another gunfight between the IRA and RUC on Oldpark Road, and a rocket attack on Hallidays Road, in the [[New Lodge, Belfast|New Lodge]].&lt;ref name=10ira/&gt;

In West Belfast, 15 shots were fired and an improvised grenade thrown at Woodbourne Army base. On the Falls Road, 20 rounds were fired at a British security checkpoint. Although there was return fire, all the IRA members made good their escape.&lt;ref name=10ira/&gt; According to independent sources, IRA members fired at British soldiers and RUC officers who were trying to remove barricades in North Belfast in the early hours of Tuesday, forcing them to retreat. No injuries were reported. Petrol bombs were thrown at RUC vehicles and a passing 11-year-boy suffered severe burns when he was mistakenly hit by one of the bombs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EKRUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fTsNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5340,1766559&amp;dq=catholic-and-ira-rioters&amp;hl=en "Rioting continues in Northern Ireland"] by Shawn Pogatchnik. Associated Press, 8 July 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The Protestant estate at Suffolk was attacked from Lenadoon. Several cars were burned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/heathwood/static/1997.html|title=CAIN: Peter Heathwood Collection of Television Programmes - Search Page|first=Dr Martin|last=Melaugh|website=cain.ulst.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scattered riots continued throughout the day and the outbound lanes of a highway were blocked by hijacked cars.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_DFdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=L1sNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1482,834684&amp;dq=train-burned-in-northern-ireland&amp;hl=en "Train burned in Northern Ireland"]. Associated Press, 8 July 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Elsewhere====

About 100 rioters clashed with the RUC in Bellaghy and the Orange hall was hit by a number of petrol-bombs.&lt;ref name=burn&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WXlIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zgINAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1431,1139531&amp;dq=belfast+arson+1997&amp;hl=en "Rioting continues in Northern Ireland"] by Shawn Pogatchnik. Associated Press, 8 July 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Another three Orange halls were burnt in Portadown, [[Dunloy]] and [[Moy, County Tyrone|Moy]].&lt;ref name=der/&gt;&lt;ref name=ars/&gt;

During disturbances in Portadown on Tuesday morning, an RUC officer was shot in the arm and leg near Garvaghy Road.&lt;ref name=10ira/&gt; In Newry, British government buildings were set on fire and a train was partially burnt out at the railway station.&lt;ref name=10ira/&gt;

On Tuesday evening, protesters held a "white line picket" in The Shambles area of Armagh. A crowd of several hundred surged up English Street and were blocked by a line of RUC landrovers. The picket lasted an hour and was concluded after Sinn Féin councillor Noel Sheridan addressed the crowd, urging them to attend further protests during the week.&lt;ref name=10arm/&gt;

=== Wednesday 9 July ===

On 9 July, the British Government sent in 400 soldiers of the [[Staffordshire Regiment]] to reinforce the 30,000 troops and RUC members already deployed in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name=troops/&gt; A landmine was planted by the IRA near Dungannon,&lt;ref name=tv/&gt; where several vehicles were burnt,&lt;ref name=troops/&gt; while shots were fired in Strabane and a rifle recovered at [[Short Strand]] in Belfast.&lt;ref name=tv/&gt; A number of false bomb threats threw traffic into chaos.&lt;ref name=troops/&gt; In [[Carrickmore]], County Tyrone, yet another Orange hall was set on fire.&lt;ref name=ars/&gt; In Lurgan's Kilwilkie estate, RUC and [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|Royal Irish Regiment]] troops tried to clear residents from their homes after claiming there was a bomb near the railway line. When a man was allegedly assaulted by the troops, about 150 people gathered to confront them. RUC officers threatened to fire plastic bullets at the gathering crowd before the bulk of the forces agreed to leave the area. Since Tuesday, the RUC recorded 76 people arrested, 900 plastic bullets fired and 265 attacks on the security forces.&lt;ref name=Jul/&gt;

In West Belfast, a [[car bomb]] exploded outside shops on the Andersonstown Road. The car had been left by three men wearing dark glasses and carrying walkie-talkies. Sinn Féin members helped clear the area and claimed that the RUC took almost an hour to answer a call from a member of the public. Loyalists were believed to be responsible for the blast.&lt;ref name=10uda/&gt;

The INLA threatened to shoot Protestants if parades in Belfast was allowed to go ahead, while the LVF vowed to shoot people in the Republic if the marches were banned. The later threat was taken "very seriously" by [[Gardaí]] commander Pat Byrne, who put on alert all security checkpoints along the border.&lt;ref name=troops/&gt;

The Orange Order vowed to gather its entire organisation at Ormeau Park if the parade there was banned. Converserly, the Bogside Residents Group called for a huge demonstration to stop 12 July Orange march in Derry.&lt;ref name=tv&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/heathwood/static/1997.html|title=CAIN: Peter Heathwood Collection of Television Programmes - Search Page|first=Dr Martin|last=Melaugh|website=cain.ulst.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thursday 10 July ===
In Belfast, the North of Ireland Rugby &amp; Cricket Club and the [[Carnmoney]] Church of Ireland were damaged in arson attacks. There was a security alert at Newry RUC station and the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] Headquarters received a hoax letter bomb in the post.&lt;ref name="cain.ulst.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/heathwood/static/1997.html|title=CAIN: Peter Heathwood Collection of Television Programmes - Search Page|first=Dr Martin|last=Melaugh|website=cain.ulst.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Lisnaskea]], five commercial buildings owned by Orangemen were attacked and an Orange hall was petrol-bombed in Waterside, Derry.&lt;ref name="cain.ulst.ac.uk"/&gt;

Violence waned as the Orange Order announced it was reconsidering the route of several parades.&lt;ref name=Jul/&gt; A dissident group inside the Order called the decision a "terrible betrayal".&lt;ref name=twelf/&gt;

=== Friday 11 July ===

On 11 July in North Belfast, the IRA launched a gun and bomb attack on a checkpoint guarded by a [[Saxon (vehicle)|Saxon]] armoured vehicle. Three British soldiers and two RUC officers were injured. The IRA unit fired 56 shots from two AK-47 assault rifles and also threw a coffee-jar bomb.&lt;ref name=sax/&gt; The soldiers were members of the recently arrived Staffordshire Regiment.&lt;ref name=scuffles&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/scuffles-at-orange-marches-1250414.html "Scuffles at Orange marches"] by David McKittrick. ''The Independent''.&lt;/ref&gt; In a separate incident on Doon Road, in West Belfast, an RUC/British Army patrol was the target of a grenade attack.&lt;ref name="sax"&gt;[http://www.anphoblacht.com/contents/2310 "IRA attack leaves five casualties"]. ''An Phoblacht'', 17 July 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Independent]]'' reported that two teenage Protestants at an [[Eleventh Night]] bonfire were shot and wounded by republicans.&lt;ref name=scuffles/&gt; There were also a number of clashes between nationalists and security forces overnight.&lt;ref name=scuffles/&gt; An Orange hall was burned in Bond street, Derry.&lt;ref name=ars/&gt;

==Aftermath==
By 9 July, according to an RUC report, 60 RUC officers and 56 civilians had been injured while 117 people had been arrested. There had been 815 attacks on the security forces, 1,506 petrol bombs thrown and 402 hijackings. The RUC had fired 2,500 plastic bullets.&lt;ref name=Jul/&gt; According to other sources, over 100 people are believed to have been injured.&lt;ref name=Jul/&gt; The last IRA action took place on 12 July, when an [[Barrack buster|improvised mortar]] round fell 40 yards short of the RUC/British Army base at Newtownhamilton, South Armagh.&lt;ref&gt;
Harnden, Toby. ''Bandit Country: The IRA and South Armagh''. Coronet Books, 2000. p. 424; {{ISBN|0-340-71737-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arsonists attacked an Orange hall in [[Warrenpoint]], County Down and another in [[Rasharkin]], County Antrim.&lt;ref name=ars/&gt;

The violence died down on 10 July when the Orange Order decided unilaterally to re-route six parades. The following day, Orangemen and residents agreed to waive another march in [[Newtownbutler]], [[County Fermanagh]].&lt;ref name=Jul/&gt; In Pomeroy, County Tyrone, nationalist residents blocked Orangemen's return parade with a counter-demonstration,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/heathwood/static/1997.html CAIN – Listing of Programmes for the Year: 12 July 1997], cain.ulst.ac.uk; accessed 23 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; while the marches in Newry&lt;ref name=twelf&gt;Shawn Pogatchnik, [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=f1peAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MWENAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2374,2757142&amp;dq=parades+rerouted+1997&amp;hl=en "Soldiers, Police shot in Belfast"], Associated Press, 12 July 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; and Lower Ormeau were cancelled outright.&lt;ref name=lo&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/heathwood/static/1997.html CAIN – Listing of Programmes for the Year: 1997 – UTV news, 12 July 1997], cain.ulst.ac.uk; accessed 23 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The Order's gesture was unheard of in its 202-year history. According to [[Anglican]] minister Bill Hoey, a member of the Order, "this was an extremely bitter pill to swallow, but the powers that be made it clear to us that to have taken any other decision would have meant civil war."&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9JxjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=dvEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6560,53629&amp;dq=civil+war+orange+order&amp;hl=en "Protestants offer an olive branch"], Associated Press, 11 July 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Author Eric Kaufmann claims that the RUC overstated security threats to trick county lodge officials into taking the decision.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, Eric. ''The Orange Order: A Contemporary Northern Irish History''. Oxford University Press, 2007. pp. 181–82; {{ISBN|0199208484}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the last time the Order marched the Garvaghy Road in Portadown.&lt;ref&gt;Daugherty Rasnic, Carol. ''Northern Ireland: can Sean and John live in peace?''. Brandylane Publishers, 2003. p. 54; {{ISBN|1-883911-55-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a parallel development, on 9 July the British government assured Sinn Féin that in the event of a new IRA ceasefire, representatives of that party would be allowed to meet with government ministers. A week later, Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness called for a renewal of the IRA's 1994 ceasefire. The IRA announced the restoration of the ceasefire on 19 July.&lt;ref name=Jul/&gt; ''The Last Gunman'', a photograph taken by Brendan Murphy of an IRA man firing an AK-47 on Ormeau Road, became an iconic image of the Troubles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/photo-galleries/article13909724.ece?ino=290 The Last Gunman] by Brendan Murphy&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Redirect|A.C.N.||ACN (disambiguation){{!}}ACN}}
The term '''''ante Christum natum'''''&lt;ref&gt; Sometimes incorrectly spelled ''Ante Christus Natum''&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Latin]] for ''before Christ (was) born''), usually abbreviated to '''a.&amp;nbsp;Chr.&amp;nbsp;n.''', '''a.Ch.n.''', '''a.C.n.''', '''A.C.N.''', or '''ACN''', denotes the years before the birth of [[Jesus of Nazareth|Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/manuscripts/INDX0010.ASP?MSRefID=37339.htm&amp;NameDesc=Arundel.382 British Library manuscripts catalogue] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521140037/http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/manuscripts/INDX0010.ASP?MSRefID=37339.htm&amp;NameDesc=Arundel.382 |date=May 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a Latin equivalent to the English term "[[Before Christ|BC]]" ("before Christ"). The phrase ''ante Christum natum'' is also seen shortened to ''ante Christum'' (Latin for "before Christ"), similarly abbreviated to ''a.&amp;nbsp;Chr.'', ''A.C.''  or ''AC''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03738a.htm General Chronology in the 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Webster's New World College Dictionary, Fourth Edition&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; A related term, '''p.&amp;nbsp;Chr.&amp;nbsp;n.''', '''p.Ch.n''', or ''post Christum natum'' complements '''a.Ch.n''' and is equivalent to "[[AD]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.logoslibrary.eu/pls/wordtc/new_wordtheque.w6_home_author.home?code_author=5547&amp;lang=LA Example from LogosLibrary.eu].&lt;/ref&gt;

English speakers are unlikely to recognize these terms, which are so rare that AC, ACN, and ''ante Christum natum'' are not in the ''Chicago Manual of Style'' (14th ed.), the ''American Heritage Dictionary'' (3rd ed.), or P. Kenneth Seidelmann's ''Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac'' (1992, University Science Books). 

[[Bede|The Venerable Bede]], who was the first writer to identify a year as ''before Christ'', used the Latin ''ante incarnationis dominicae tempus'' (before the time of the incarnation of the Lord) in his ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'' (I.2) in 731.

The '''Antebellum era '''was a period in the [[history of the Southern United States]], from the late 18th century until the start of the [[American Civil War]] in 1861, marked by the economic growth of the South.

== Economic structure ==
The plantation-era South saw large expansions in agriculture while manufacturing growth remained relatively slow. The southern economy was characterized by a low level of capital accumulation (largely labor-based) and a shortage of liquid capital, which, when aggravated by the need to concentrate on a few staples, the pervasive anti-industrial, and anti-urban ideology, and the reduction of southern banking, led to a South dependent on export trade. In contrast to the economies of the North and West, which relied primarily on their own domestic markets, because the southern domestic market consisted primarily of plantations, southern states imported sustenance commodities from the West and manufactured goods from the North.

The plantation system can be seen as the factory system applied to agriculture, with a concentration of labor under skilled management. But while the industrial manufacturing-based labor economy of the North was driven by growing demand, maintenance of the plantation economic system depended upon usage of crude labor that was both abundant and cheap.

The five major commodities of the southern agricultural economy were cotton, grain, tobacco, sugar, and rice, with the production of the leading [[cash crop]], cotton, concentrated in the Deep South (Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana).

=== Efficiency of slave agriculture ===
The leading historian of the era was [[Ulrich Bonnell Phillips]], who studied slavery not so much as a political issue between North and South but as a social and economic system. He focused on the large plantations that dominated the South.

Phillips addressed the unprofitability of slave labor and slavery's ill effects on the southern economy. An example of pioneering comparative work was "A Jamaica Slave Plantation&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jamaica Slave Plantation|last=Bonnell|first=Ulrich|publisher=WENTWORTH Press, 2016|year=1914|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;" (1914). His methods inspired the "Phillips school" of slavery studies between 1900 and 1950.

Phillips argued that large-scale plantation slavery was efficient and progressive. It had reached its geographical limits by 1860 or so, and therefore eventually had to fade away (as happened in [[Brazil]]). In 1910, he argued in "The Decadence of the Plantation System" that slavery was an unprofitable relic that persisted because it produced social status, honor, and [[Slave Power|political power]]. "Most farmers in the South had small- to medium-sized farms with few slaves, but the large plantation owner’s wealth, often reflected in the number of slaves they owned, afforded them considerable prestige and political power."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/antebellum-period|title=Antebellum Period - HistoryNet|website=www.historynet.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phillips erroneously contended that masters treated slaves relatively well; his views on that issue were later sharply rejected by [[Kenneth M. Stampp]]. His conclusions about the economic decline of slavery were challenged in 1958 by [[Alfred H. Conrad]] and [[John R. Meyer]] in a landmark study published in the ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Alfred H. |last1=Conrad |first2=John R. |last2=Meyer |title=The Economics of Slavery in the Ante Bellum South |volume=66 |issue=2 |year=1958 |pages=95–130 |jstor=1827270 |journal=Journal of Political Economy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their arguments were further developed by [[Robert Fogel]] and [[Stanley L. Engerman]], who argued in their 1974 book, ''[[Time on the Cross]],'' that slavery was both efficient and profitable, as long as the price of cotton was high enough. In turn, Fogel and Engerman came under attack from other historians of slavery.

=== Effects of economy on social structure ===
As slavery began to displace [[indentured servitude]] as the principal supply of labor in the plantation systems of the South, the economic nature of the institution of slavery aided in the increased inequality of wealth seen in the antebellum South. The demand for slave labor and the U.S. ban on importing more slaves from Africa drove up prices for slaves, making it profitable for smaller farmers in older settled areas such as Virginia to sell their slaves further south and west.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The actuarial risk, or the potential loss in investment of owning slaves from death, disability, etc. was much greater for small plantation owners. Accentuated by the rise of price in slaves seen just prior to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the overall costs associated with owning slaves to the individual plantation owner led to the concentration of slave ownership seen at the eve of the Civil War.

== Social structure ==
Much of the antebellum South was rural and, in line with the plantation system, largely agricultural. With the exception of [[New Orleans]] and [[Baltimore]], the slave states had no large cities, and the urban population of the South could not compare to that of the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] or even that of the agrarian West. This led to a sharp division in class in the southern states between the landowning, "master" class, poor whites, and slaves, while in the northern and western states, much of the social spectrum was dominated by a wide range of different laboring classes.

=== Wealth inequality ===
The conclusion that, while both the North and the South were characterized by a high degree of inequality during the plantation era, the wealth distribution was much more unequal in the South than in the North arises from studies concerned with the equality of land, slave, and wealth distribution. For example, in certain states and counties, due to the concentration of landholding and slave holding, which were highly correlated, six percent of landowners ended up commanding one-third of the gross income and an even higher portion of the net income. The majority of landowners, who had smaller scale plantations, saw a disproportionately small portion in revenues generated by the slavery-driven plantation system.

=== Effects of social structure on economy ===
While the two largest classes in the South included land- and slave-owners and slaves, various strata of social classes existed within and between the two. In examining class relations and the banking system in the South, the economic exploitation of slave labor can be seen to arise from a need to maintain certain conditions for the existence of slavery and from a need for each of the remaining social strata to remain in status quo. In order to meet conditions where slavery may continue to exist, members of the master class (e.g. white, landowning, slave-owning) had to compete with other members of the master class to maximize the surplus labor extracted from slaves. Likewise, in order to remain within the same class, members of the master class (and each subsumed class below) must expand their claim on revenues derived from the slave labor surplus.

==Mercantilist underpinnings==

British [[mercantilist]] ideology largely explains the rise of the plantation system in the United States. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries under mercantilism, rulers of nations believed that the accumulation of wealth through a favorable [[balance of trade]] was the best way to ensure power. As a result, [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] began to colonize territories across the Atlantic to take advantage of their rich natural resources and encourage exports.

One example of Britain utilizing the colonies for economic gain was [[tobacco]]. When tobacco was first discovered as a recreational substance, there was a widespread social backlash in mainland England, spearheaded by [[James VI and I|King James]] himself. By the middle of the 17th century, however, the British government had realized the revenue potential of tobacco and quickly changed its official moral stance towards its use. As a result, tobacco plantations sprung up across the American South in large numbers to support European demand. Britain benefitted from the immense volume of tobacco that colonial plantations could produce. By 1670, more than half of all tobacco shipped to England was being re-exported to other countries throughout Europe at a premium. In similar ways Britain was able to profit from other American staple crops, such as cotton, rice, and indigo. As Russell Menard puts it, Britain's capitalizing on increased European demand for these crops "fueled the expansion of the American plantation colonies, transformed the Atlantic into an English inland sea, and led to the creation of the first British Empire."

Many claim that being a part of the British mercantilist system was in the best economic interest of the colonies as well, as they would not have been able to survive as independent economic entities. Robert Haywood, in his article "Mercantilism and South Carolina Agriculture, 1700-1763", argues that "it was unthinkable that any trade could prosper in the straight-jacket of regimented and restricted international trade, without the guiding hand of a powerful protecting government."&lt;ref&gt;Haywood, C. Robert. “Mercantilism and South Carolina Agriculture, 1700-1763.” ''The South Carolina Historical Magazine'', vol. 60, no. 1, 1959, pp. 15–27. www.jstor.org/stable/27566205.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adverse economic effects==

The plantation era, while it was in large part the source of the South's initial economic prosperity, was also the reason why the South lagged in productivity starting in the early- to mid-19th century. Because the plantation system mainly required a large volume of unskilled labor, the South did not have the human capital to succeed when the plantation era was over. Ulrich Bonnell Phillips contends that the plantation "sadly restricted the opportunity of such men as were of better industrial quality than was required for the field gangs." Essentially, men who would have been otherwise capable of performing other skilled jobs were nonetheless relegated to field work because of the nature of the system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to the [[Goldin–Sokoloff hypothesis]], in the South, the relative productivity of women and children was higher than in the North, since the relative abilities of a man, woman, or child to pick cotton or harvest tobacco are nearly the same. In the North, however, since the relative productivity of women and children was much lower, factory jobs became attractive, and there arose an abundant supply of labor to fuel the industrial boom. As a result of the misallocation of labor in the South, the system "hindered all diversification in southern industry, and kept the whole community in a state of commercial dependence upon the North."

'''Ashley's Sack''' is a mid-1800s cloth seed or feed sack featuring an embroidered text that recounts the [[Slavery in the United States|slave sale]] of a nine-year-old girl named Ashley and the parting gift of the sack by her mother, Rose. The sack is on display at the [[National Museum of African American History and Culture]] in Washington D.C. Rose filled the sack with a dress, braid of her hair, pecans, and "my love always." The gift was likely passed down to Ashley's granddaughter, Ruth (Jones) Middleton, who embroidered their story on to the sack in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/artifacts-that-will-send-a-chill-down-your-spine/|title=Artifacts that will send a chill down your spine|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.journalscene.com/archives/filled-with-my-love-slave-artifact-to-be-displayed-in/article_788d9120-6024-5536-aa6a-c3e569a21558.html|title='Filled with my love' Slave artifact to be displayed in new Smithsonian museum|last=Cantu|first=Leslie|newspaper=Journal Scene|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ashley's Sack was given to [[Middleton Place]], in [[Dorchester County, South Carolina|Dorchester]] County, [[South Carolina]], one of the nation's preeminent slavery-era plantation sites, in the mid-2000s. While still owned by Middleton Place, the sack is on long-term loan to the [[National Museum of African American History and Culture]] in Washington D.C. According to Tracey Todd, vice president of the Middleton Place Foundation, the sack is a rare material artifact from [[Slavery in the United States|a period in United States history when human slavery was legal]] and families suffered extraordinary losses; the sack typifies the strength and endurance of inter-generational love. "The sack allows us to relate to the enslaved people and feel the same pain today — if you have lost a child or been separated from a parent — that Rose and Ashley felt," said Todd. "Ashley's Sack is a portal to understanding more about our shared history."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/nation-world/national/article103549677.html|title=This scrap of cloth is one of the saddest artifacts at new DC museum|newspaper=kansascity|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://savannahnow.com/column-accent/2016-01-28/looking-pearls-ashleys-sack-davenport-dolls-give-insight-lives-slaves|title=Looking for Pearls: Ashley's Sack, Davenport dolls give insight into lives of slaves|newspaper=savannahnow.com|language=en|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Ashley's Sack was purchased for $20 at a flea market in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] in the early 2000s. Alarmed by the embroidered story of a slave sale separating a mother and her daughter, the woman who purchased the sack did an internet search for "slavery" and "Middleton" and then gifted the sack to Middleton Place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.yakimaherald.com/news/local/a-stitch-in-time-cwu-professor-tracks-history-of-embroidered/article_9f2d8aba-c298-11e6-8653-f7f4a912b32a.html|title=A stitch in time: CWU professor tracks history of embroidered seed sack to people held in slavery on South Carolina plantation|last=tayer@yakimaherald.com|first=Tammy Ayer|newspaper=Yakima Herald-Republic|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On display from 2009-2013 at Middleton Place, the emotionally-charged artifact evoked human suffering and endurance. During this period, the identities of Rose, Ashley, and Ruth were unknown. It was viewed by thousands of museum visitors, including [[Central Washington University]] sociocultural anthropologist and museum studies professor Mark Auslander, who has since traced the history of the sack to identify Ashley, her mother Rose, and the author of the needlepoint, Ruth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.yakimaherald.com/news/local/a-stitch-in-time-cwu-professor-tracks-history-of-embroidered/article_9f2d8aba-c298-11e6-8653-f7f4a912b32a.html|title=A stitch in time: CWU professor tracks history of embroidered seed sack to people held in slavery on South Carolina plantation|last=tayer@yakimaherald.com|first=Tammy Ayer|newspaper=Yakima Herald-Republic|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cwu.edu/anthropology/story-behind-smithsonian-%E2%80%9Cashley%E2%80%99s-sack-uncovered-cwu-professor|title=Anthropology and Museum Studies {{!}} Story Behind Smithsonian "Ashley's Sack" Uncovered by CWU Professor|website=www.cwu.edu|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the research article he published in 2016, Auslander uses census reports, wills, newspaper announcements of court-degrees, and inventory records to reconstruct their history. The historical chains of remaining evidence suggest that Ashley and her mother Rose were owned by a wealthy Charleston merchant and planter, Robert Martin (c. 1790–1852), who was worth over $300,000 at his death in December 1852. After his death, evidence suggests Ashley was sold away from her mother in order to raise money for his heirs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://kuow.org/post/record-wednesday-dec-21-full-show|title=The Record: Wednesday, Dec 21, Full Show|last=Staff|first=KUOW|language=en|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Auslander's archival work retraces the life of Ruth. He posits Ruth Middleton was born Ruth Jones in [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]], South Carolina around 1903. Her parents, Austin and Rosa Jones, were servants at the [[University of South Carolina]]. Ruth made her way to [[Philadelphia]], Penn. and married Arthur Middleton, who was born around 1899 and also from South Carolina. However, Ruth and her husband are never listed as having lived together. She had a daughter, Dorothy Helen, born in Philadelphia in 1919. In 1921, when Ashley's Sack was embroidered, Ruth would have been a single mother to a young daughter. Newspaper reports and census records suggest that throughout her life Ruth worked in affluent households in Philadelphia. By 1928, she was well-known in Philadelphia's African American [[High society (social class)|high society]], gaining regular mention in the "Smart Set" and "High Society" pages of the [[Philadelphia Tribune]], the leading African American newspaper. Auslander writes that Ruth "host[ed] bridge and cocktail parties and [wore] elegant couture." Her daughter, Dorothy Helen was also known for her fashion-sense and authored several "Smart Set" columns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mark|first=Auslander,|date=2016-01-01|title=Slavery's Traces: In Search of Ashley's Sack|url=https://southernspaces.org/2016/slaverys-traces-search-ashleys-sack|volume=2016|issn=1551-2754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruth died in January 1942 of tuberculosis. Dorothy Helen died in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mark|first=Auslander,|date=2016-01-01|title=Slavery's Traces: In Search of Ashley's Sack|url=https://southernspaces.org/2016/slaverys-traces-search-ashleys-sack|volume=2016|issn=1551-2754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==

The sack is a rare, important material artifact in African American history. The sack exemplifies the coming together of traditional oral and written history. [[Heather Andrea Williams]][http://www.upenn.edu/almanac/volumes/v60/n33/heatherandreawilliams.html] describes the sack in the epilogue of her book ''Help Me To Find My People'' as a testimony to inter-generational loss and survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/01/books/review/help-me-to-find-my-people-by-heather-andrea-williams.html|title='Help Me to Find My People,' by Heather Andrea Williams|last=Perry|first=Imani|date=2012-06-29|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Mark Auslander emphasizes the importance of the sack, and the historical reconstruction of the lives of Ashley, Rose, and Ruth, as a conduit to understanding the endurance of family lineal memory "in the face of terrible fragmentation of family solidarity caused by the domestic slave trade."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mark|first=Auslander,|date=2016-01-01|title=Slavery's Traces: In Search of Ashley's Sack|url=https://southernspaces.org/2016/slaverys-traces-search-ashleys-sack|volume=2016|issn=1551-2754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"It is an emotional object," said Mary Elliot, museum specialist with the Smithsonian, who worked on the Slavery and Freedom exhibit at the [[National Museum of African American History and Culture]] under curator Nancy Bercaw. "This piece is very important to telling that human story," Elliot said.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.journalscene.com/archives/filled-with-my-love-slave-artifact-to-be-displayed-in/article_788d9120-6024-5536-aa6a-c3e569a21558.html|title='Filled with my love' Slave artifact to be displayed in new Smithsonian museum|last=Cantu|first=Leslie|newspaper=Journal Scene|access-date=2016-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Birobidzhan''' ({{lang-rus|Биробиджа́н|p=bʲɪrəbʲɪˈdʐan}}; {{lang-yi|ביראָבידזשאַן}}, ''Birobidzshan'') is a [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|town]] and the [[administrative center]] of the [[Jewish Autonomous Oblast]], [[Russia]], located on the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]], close to the [[China–Russia border|border with China]]. As of the [[Russian Census (2010)|2010 Census]], its population was&amp;nbsp;75,413.&lt;ref name="2010Census"&gt;{{ru-pop-ref|2010Census}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Birobidzhan is named after the two largest rivers in the [[autonomous oblasts of Russia|autonomous oblast]]: the [[Bira River|Bira]] and the [[Bidzhan River|Bidzhan]], although only the Bira, which lies to the east of the Bidzhan Valley,{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} flows through the town. Both rivers are [[tributary|tributaries]] of the [[Amur River|Amur]]. The city was planned by the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] architect [[Hannes Meyer]], and established in 1931. It became the [[administrative center]] of the Jewish Autonomous Oblast in 1934 and town status was granted to it in 1937.&lt;ref name="gr"&gt;{{cite book|title=Энциклопедия Города России|year=2003|publisher=Большая Российская Энциклопедия|location=Moscow|isbn=5-7107-7399-9|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yiddish writer [[David Bergelson]] played a large part in promoting Birobidzhan, although he himself did not really live there.&lt;ref name="Gessen" /&gt; Bergelson wrote articles in the Yiddish language newspapers in other countries extolling the region as an ideal escape from anti-Semitism elsewhere. At least 1,000 families from the United States and Latin America came to Birobidzhan because of Bergelson.&lt;ref name="Gessen" /&gt;

Life could be quite hard in the mountainous region.  In her book on the region, ''Where the Jews Aren't: The Sad and Absurd Story of Birobidzhan, Russia's Jewish Autonomous Region'', Masha Gessen writes that &lt;blockquote&gt;in the summer of 1928 there were torrential rains, causing flooding that washed out what little the new settlers had managed to plant, stymied by the late arrival of seeds. Their cattle arrive late too, and were felled by an anthrax epidemic that raged that first year. The settlers at Birofeld, though they managed to put up eighteen houses over the summer, faced a cold winter of relentless hunger, surrounded by their ruined fields and foreboding woods, where tiger and bears roamed.&lt;ref name="gessen-2016-51"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gessen|first1=Masha|title=Where the Jews Aren't: The Sad and Absurd Story of Birobidzhan|date=2016|publisher=Nextbook/Schocken|page=51|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j3YkCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=in+the+summer+of+1928+there+were+torrential&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TTd_Te2c89&amp;sig=ZluGb5fioHDLfk0s4C6dNe6dmKE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjP5tjSq-LPAhXM24MKHcRYDs8Q6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=in%20the%20summer%20of%201928%20there%20were%20torrential&amp;f=false|accessdate=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When the Stalinist purges began shortly after the creation of Birobidzhan, Jews there were likewise targeted.&lt;ref name="Gessen"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gessen|first1=Masha|author2=Interviewed by Terry Gross|title='Sad And Absurd': The U.S.S.R.'s Disastrous Effort To Create A Jewish Homeland|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/09/07/492962278/sad-and-absurd-the-u-s-s-r-s-disastrous-effort-to-create-a-jewish-homeland|website=Fresh Air|publisher=WHYY|accessdate=10 September 2016|format=Interview|date=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ″Jews in Birobidzhan are targeted, and they're targeted in this very Soviet way specifically for what they came there for - for nationalism, for promoting the Yiddish language, for what they were told was a good thing just a couple of years earlier,″ explained Gessen in an interview discussing her book.&lt;ref name="Gessen" /&gt;

Following World War II, tens of thousands of displaced Eastern European Jews found their way to Birobidzhan from 1946 to 1948.&lt;ref name = "Weinberg 1998, 72-75"&gt;Weinberg, Robert (1998). ''Stalin's Forgotten Zion: Birobidzhan and the Making of a Soviet Jewish Homeland''. Berkeley: University of California Press. pp. 72–75. {{ISBN|978-0-520-20990-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some were Ukrainian and Belarussian Jews who were not allowed to return to their original homes.&lt;ref name="Gessen" /&gt;

However, Jews were once again targeted in the wake of World War II when [[Joseph Stalin]] embarked on a [[Stalin and antisemitism|campaign against ″rootless cosmopolitans″]] — a code name for Jews.&lt;ref name="Gessen" /&gt; Nearly all the Yiddish institutions of Birobidzhan were liquidated.&lt;ref name="Pipes-NRoB-27-10-16"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pipes|first1=Richard|title=The Sad Fate of Birobidzhan|journal=New York Review of Books|date=October 27, 2016|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2016/10/27/the-sad-fate-of-birobidzhan/|accessdate=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Amongst those executed was David Bergelson, Birobidzhan's early promoter, who was killed in 1952 on his 68th birthday.&lt;ref name="Gessen" /&gt;

==Jewish and Yiddish culture==
[[File:Birobidjan mainsquare.jpg|thumb|left|A menorah dominating the main square in Birobidzhan]]

While thousands of Jews migrated to Birobidzhan, the hardship and isolation caused few to stay. Shortly World War II, the Jewish population in the region reached its peak of about 30,000.&lt;ref name="Pipes-NRoB-27-10-16"/&gt;  As of the mid-2010s, only about 2,000 Jews remain in the region, making up about one half of a percent of the population.&lt;ref name="Pipes-NRoB-27-10-16"/&gt;

According to Israeli [[Rabbi]] [[Mordechai Scheiner]], the former [[Chief Rabbi]] of Birobidzhan and [[Chabad Lubavitch]] representative to the region, "Today one can enjoy the benefits of the [[Yiddish]] culture and not be afraid to return to their Jewish traditions. It's safe without any [[anti-Semitism]], and we plan to open the first [[Jewish day school]] here."&lt;ref name="Wiseman2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wiseman|first1=Michael C.|title=Birobidjan: The Story of the First Jewish State|journal=Inquiries Journal/Student Pulse [Online]|date=2010|volume=2|issue=4|page=1|url=http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/221/birobidjan-the-story-of-the-first-jewish-state|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scheiner also hosted the Russian television show, ''[[Yiddishkeit (TV show)|Yiddishkeit]]'' in the region.  His student, actually born in Birobidzhan, Rabbi Eliyahu Reiss, has taken over the reins since 2010.

The [[Birobidzhan Synagogue|town's synagogue]] opened in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fjc.ru/news/newsArticle.asp?AID=166969 FJC | News | Far East Community Prepares for 70th Anniversary of Jewish Autonomous Republic&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518041740/http://www.fjc.ru/news/newsArticle.asp?AID=166969 |date=May 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi Scheiner says there are 4,000 Jews in Birobidzhan, just over 5 percent of the town's population of 75,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fjc.ru/news/newsArticle.asp?AID=525676&amp;cid=84435&amp;NewsType=80052 FJC | News | From Tractors to Torah in Russia's Jewish Land&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411050518/http://fjc.ru/news/newsArticle.asp?AID=525676&amp;cid=84435&amp;NewsType=80052 |date=April 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Birobidzhan Jewish community was led by [[Lev Toitman]], until his death in September, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fjc.ru/news/newsArticle.asp?AID=566776&amp;scope=6218&amp;NewsType=80052 Far East Jewish Community Chairman  Passes Away] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605150006/http://www.fjc.ru/news/newsArticle.asp?AID=566776&amp;scope=6218&amp;NewsType=80052 |date=June 5, 2008 }} Federation of Jewish Communities&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Secular Jewish culture|Jewish culture]] was revived in Birobidzhan much earlier than elsewhere in the [[Soviet Union]]. [[Yiddish theater]]s opened in the 1970s. Yiddish and Jewish traditions have been required components in all [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] for almost fifteen years, taught not as Jewish exotica but as part of the region's national heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/2004/09/21/archive/across-the-former-soviet-union-in-stalins-former-jewish-haven-locals-say-ground-is-ripe-for-reviva Jta.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Birobidzhan Synagogue]], completed in 2004, is next to a complex housing Sunday School classrooms, a library, a museum, and administrative offices. The buildings were officially opened in 2004 to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the [[Jewish Autonomous Oblast]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fjc.ru/news/newsArticle.asp?AID=317166 FJC | News | Birobidzhan - New Rabbi, New Synagogue&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927020227/http://www.fjc.ru/news/newsArticle.asp?AID=317166 |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning the Jewish community of the [[oblast]], Governor [[Nikolay Mikhaylovich Volkov]] has stated that he intends to "support every valuable initiative maintained by our local [[Jewish]] organizations.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fjc.ru/news/newsArticle.asp?AID=221939 Governor Voices Support for Growing Far East Jewish Community] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518042318/http://www.fjc.ru/news/newsArticle.asp?AID=221939 |date=May 18, 2011 }} Federation of Jewish Communities&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, The First Birobidzhan International Summer Program for Yiddish Language and Culture was launched by Yiddish studies professor Boris Kotlerman of [[Bar-Ilan University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.2all.co.il/web/Sites/yiddishproject/ 2all.co.il]&lt;/ref&gt; The town's main street is named after the [[Yiddish language]] author and humorist [[Sholom Aleichem]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1255450652192&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull Back to Birobidjan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813161029/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1255450652192&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull |date=August 13, 2011 }}. By Rebecca Raskin. [[Jerusalem Post]]&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[Chanukah]] celebration of 2007, officials of Birobidzhan in the Jewish Autonomous Oblast claimed to have built the world's largest [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|Menorah]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/cgi-bin/iowa/breaking/105713.html Breaking News - JTA, Jewish &amp; Israel News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605221624/http://www.jta.org/cgi-bin/iowa/breaking/105713.html |date=June 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administrative and municipal status==
Birobidzhan is the [[administrative center]] of the [[autonomous oblasts of Russia|autonomous oblast]] and, within the [[subdivisions of Russia#Administrative divisions|framework of administrative divisions]], it also serves as the administrative center of [[Birobidzhansky District]], even though it is not a part of it.&lt;ref name="Ref715"&gt;Law #982-OZ&lt;/ref&gt; As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the '''[[city of federal subject significance|town of oblast significance]] of Birobidzhan'''—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the [[administrative divisions of the Jewish Autonomous Oblast|districts]].&lt;ref name="Ref715" /&gt; As a [[subdivisions of Russia#Municipal divisions|municipal division]], the town of oblast significance of Birobidzhan is incorporated as '''Birobidzhan Urban Okrug'''.&lt;ref name="Ref718"&gt;Law #226-OZ&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy and infrastructure==
The chief economic activity is light industry, including textile and footwear. The city also has a vehicle repair factory, a furniture factory, a quicklime production factory, and several foodstuff factories.

==Education==
The [[Birobidzhan Jewish National University]] works in cooperation with the local religious community. The university is unique in the [[Russian Far East]]. The basis of the training course is study of the [[Hebrew language]], history and classic [[Jewish]] texts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eao.ru/eng/?p=365 Religion&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806140814/http://www.eao.ru/eng/?p=365 |date=August 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The town now boasts several state-run schools that teach Yiddish, as well as an Anglo-Yiddish faculty at its higher education college, a Yiddish school for religious instruction and a kindergarten. The five- to seven-year-olds spend two lessons a week learning to speak Yiddish, as well as being taught Jewish songs, dance and traditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kulanu.org/links/birodidzhan.html Kulanu: Birobidzhan: Soviety-era Jewish homeland struggles on&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807174013/http://www.kulanu.org/links/birodidzhan.html |date=August 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a public school that offers a half-day Yiddish and Jewish curriculum for those parents who choose it. About half the school's 120 pupils are enrolled in the Yiddish course. Many of them continue on to Public School No. 2, which offers the same half-day Yiddish/Jewish curriculum from first through 12th grade. Yiddish is also offered at Birobidzhan's Pedagogical Institute, one of the only university-level Yiddish courses in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsj.org/AuxPages/091304JTA_Birobid.shtml#0916 NCSJ - Profiles: Birobidzhan Jewish Community&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112143851/http://www.ncsj.org/AuxPages/091304JTA_Birobid.shtml |date=January 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Today, the town's fourteen public schools must teach Yiddish and Jewish tradition.

He was a genius. It was such a joy working with him. If anything historical ever came up during a programme, Bob could describe not only the match in question, but name the referee and give the size of the crowd. He was a real football man. Once when we were on a flight to [[Wales]] to cover an [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] match, I kept throwing topics at him, just to see how broad his knowledge was. He could give a discourse for 10 minutes on any subject I cared to mention.}}

[[First Minister of Scotland]] [[Alex Salmond]] responded to the news of Crampsey's death:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2008/07/28120928 Death of Bob Crampsey], [[Scottish Government]], 28 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|Bob Crampsey was an extraordinary man. A legend in broadcasting and in Scottish football with an encyclopaedic, unrivalled knowledge of the Scottish game. I last met him at a fundraiser and it was quite incredible that despite his recent illness his memory and grasp of Scottish football was truly outstanding. Many of us grew up with Bob so he will be greatly missed by all lovers of the game in Scotland. My sympathy goes out to his family.}}

{{Culture of Burma}}
[[File:Burmese village ballet.jpg|thumb|A village group dance in the early 1900s]]
[[File:Burmese traditional dance.jpg|thumb|Traditional dance performance at the [[Karaweik]] in Yangon]]
'''Dance in Burma''' (now known as [[Myanmar]] by the government there) can be divided into dramatic, folk and village, and [[nat (spirit)|nat]] dances, each having distinct characteristics. Although Burmese dance has been influenced by the dance traditions of its neighbours, in particular [[Dance in Thailand|Thailand]], it retains unique qualities that distinguish it from other regional styles, including angular, fast-paced and energetic movements and emphasis on pose, not movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=World and Its Peoples: Eastern and Southern Asia |editor=Marshall Cavendish Publishing |year=2007 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish |isbn=978-0-7614-7631-3 |pages=630–640 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=29 August 2010--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Burmese puppetry.jpg|thumb|Puppet theatre ({{my|အမြင့်သဘင်}}) is the inspiration for many movements in traditional Burmese dancing, whose movements are reminiscent of puppets.]]
The origins of Burmese Dance are traced to the [[Pyu]], [[Halin]], and [[Mon people|Mon]] cultures in the central and lower [[Irrawaddy Delta|Irrawaddy]] regions from at least two centuries before the [[Anno Domini|Christian era]].&lt;ref name="oba3"&gt;''Oba Thaung: Who Systematized Myanma Dance'', Zaw Pale and Khin Win New, (translated to English by [[Than Tun]], 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological evidence shows Indian influences already in this.&lt;ref name=programnotes1/&gt;&lt;ref name=dgehall2&gt;D.G.E. Hall, Hutcheson and Co., London 1950&lt;/ref&gt;  There were also influences from [[Thai people|Thai]] and [[Cambodia|Khmer]] cultures during the many invasions and counter-invasions that occurred over the next two millennia.&lt;ref name=dgehall2 /&gt; There was a particularly well documented infusion of dance forms, such as the [[Yama Zatdaw]] (the Burmese version of the Ramayana) in 1767, when the Burmese sacked [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] ({{my|ယိုးဒယား}}) and expropriated a large component of the Thai court.&lt;ref name=dgehall2/&gt;

Some of the surviving forms (including the belu, nat gadaw and zawgyi dances) honour folklore characters that are quintessentially Burmese, some of these from pre-Buddhist times.  There is also a close relationship between the classical Burmese marionette and human dance art forms, with the former obviously imitating human dance, but also with human dance imitating the movements of the marionette.

After independence from Britain in 1948, there was a period of strong Burmese cultural [[nationalism]] that resulted in the establishment of the State School of Music in [[Mandalay]] in 1953. A well-known dancer of the day, [[Oba Thaung]], is credited with codifying the nearly completely undocumented Burmese dance repertory. Her syllabus at the school was condensed into five dance courses intended as a five-year term of study. Each of the five courses is broken into dance sequences comprising a total of 125 stages, with each stage being precisely ten minutes long.&lt;ref name=programnotes1/&gt;

==Bagan dance==
This dance originates from the time of the [[Pyu kingdom]]s (5th-10th century).  A small number of relatively crude musical instruments were used and the dance style is slow and sedate. The costumes of dancers, as depicted in wall paintings, were scanty and revealing.

==Bilu dance==
The [[Rakshasa|bilus]] (demons or ogres) are ancient characters, thought to originate from a legendary race that roamed India and Burma circa 2000 BC. [[Buddhist texts|Buddhist literature]] describes them as primitive and feared by other races.

In literature, the Belus are described as having [[transmogrifying]] powers—an ability to take on different physical appearances. There are 24 different classical demon forms, each with its own name and role in stories and plays. One of the best known is Dasagiri, a demon in the Indian [[Ramayana]] epic.

In any of his forms, the Belus embodies the Devil.  He is terrifying, overbearing and diabolical by nature.  But he has a gentle side also.  In a typical dance, Dasa-Giri often offers a bouquet of flowers to a dainty damsel. The demure lady is unable to overlook the beastly side and declines his darling present. The demon then expresses his dejection at the refusal.

==Kinnara and kinnari dances==
[[File:Shan peacock dance.jpg|thumb|Shan [[kinnara]] and kinnari dance]]
There are many references in the Pali and [[Sanskrit literature]] to the mythical birds with human head and torso, [[Kinnara]] (male) and Kinnari (female).  According to the literature, the birds originated in prehistoric India.  They appear in some of the discourses of the Lord Buddha himself.

In Burma, images of the Bird's dancing styles are found painted and carved on the walls at Bagan and (even earlier) from the [[Pyu kingdom]]s.

The songs and dances describe the Bird's happy re-union after a separation of 700 nights due to a heavy rainstorm and floods.  The dance is a popular emblem of true love and has an [[ancient history]] that is kept alive by the Burma dance troupes.

The dancers are attired with flapping wings at their wrists, in contrast to wings at their armpits, as is characteristic of Thailand and other [[List of Asian countries|Asian countries]]. The dance of bird-like movements is very supple and fine, and intricately coordinated with the accompanying music.

==Mount Popa's guardian spirits dance==
According to Burmese folklore (but probably based on quasi-historical facts), Me Wunna, a beautiful princess was a sister of the king of [[Thaton]] in [[lower Burma]].  Estranged from her brother, she refused betrothal to a royal descendent and lived in exile and alone in the forests of [[Mount Popa]].  As a devout [[Buddhist]] she abstained from eating meat and lived solely on flowers and fruits. She generally wore the mask of a demon to frighten away foes and friends alike.  Thus she was reputed to be a flower-eating demon.

Later she fell in love with a royal dispatcher of fantastic physique, and begot two able sons with him.  Unfortunately, her spouse was then executed for being derelict in fetching flowers from the mount. As a result, he became a ''[[Nat (spirit)|nat]]'' (spirit).

Me Wunna's two sons, when they grew up, became distinguished heroes in the Royal Army. Unfortunately they fell victim to an intrigue, were executed for pretense, and became transformed into the two famous Spirits, the "Brother Nats" of [[Taungbyone]].

However that was not the end of it.  The bad tidings of her sons’ untimely deaths caused Me Wunna to die of heartbreak. So she became a ''nat'' as well and became duly enshrined at Mt. Popa, where she became "Super-Exalted" to [[Supreme Power|supreme power]] in the Realm of the Nats.

The dancer, clad traditionally in regal apparel of green colour, impersonates the Spirit. On her head is perched the mask of a demon. In her hands, she holds two quills of a peacock's tail, the symbol of the sun, to banish Darkness (the evil element). She dances as an apparition with grace and subtlety.

==Nat dance==
[[File:Nat pwe in Amarapura.jpg|thumb|A nat gadaw (spirit medium) dance in Amarapura]]
In Burma, it is traditional to make an offering of a green coconut, three hands of bananas, and a few other accessories, to the Guardian Spirit of Land (a [[Nat (spirit)|nat]]) prior to an important event such as an inauguration. This appeasement of the Spirit is usually done by a professional [[Medium (spirituality)|Spirit Medium]] (Nakadaw).

The dancer is often attired in red silk, including a red headband and, around the chest, and a tightly knotted red scarf. With the offerings on a tray, she or he dances in propitiation and repeats the sequence three times. As medium dances she sings ritual songs to the 37 National Nats (Spirits) and the Local Nat.

At the onset, the dance is delicate and the music legato.  After a verbal injunction, the dancer quickens to the rising intensity of the music. As the Medium enjoins the Spirits, the movements and the music reach a frenzied crescendo.

==Oil lamp dance==
In the oil lamp dance ({{my|ဆီမီးကွက်အက}}), the traditional [[oil lamp]] offered to the Lord Buddha is a lighted wick of cotton soaked in an oil-filled earthenware saucer is the centerpiece of the dance. A lighted candle now usually substitutes in its place. The Rakhine people of western Burma incorporate the oil lamp dance in many of their traditional dances, mostly devotional, to the Buddha.

The performer's hands are always upturned (to retain the oil). Elders who remember performing with traditional lamps say that the secret is to not let the lamp drop while, at the same time, conveying particular expressions with various attitudes of the hands and legs. "It is almost an ordeal", they added.

==Ramayana dances==
In 1767, King [[Hsinbyushin]] of the [[Konbaung dynasty]] brought back Siamese captives to the [[Inwa]] (Ava), the kingdom's capital. Among the captives were Siamese court dancers who performed the Ramayana ([[Yama Zatdaw]]) wearing masks.

In this epic, Rama is the hero and chief character, Sita is the heroine, and Dasa-Giri is the villain demon.  In a typical segment, Rama is enticed away by the Golden Deer, who is a transmogrified form of the demon sister of Dathagiri (Ravana). Dathagiri  himself is metamorphed as a Hermit.  Rama is then seen gravely following the tracks of the alluring Deer.  The Deer leaves subtle hints as a trail.

==U Min Gyaw dance==
[[U Min Gyaw]], alias [[Pakhan Kyaw]], is a well-known Burmese ''nat'' (spirit).  There are a few different versions of his biography.  One is that, being an adept horseman and son of a trusted royal guardian; he was knighted and given the Countship of the country town of [[Pakhan]] in central Burma.  However, once in office he indulged himself in drinking, gambling (especially [[Cockfight|cock fighting]]), and in womanising.

He eventually had the audacity to dethrone and execute the king and others, including two young brothers, sons of a nobleman. These two brothers became famous ''nat''s and went on to long careers of mischief.  However, in their very first act, the two brothers used their new powers to pay back the Count in his own coin, causing the Count's murder and his return as the Nat U Min Gyaw.

When he takes in his human form, U Mingyaw takes relish drinking toddy, the sap of the palmyra tree (aka the "[[toddy palm]]"). His favourite hors d'œuvre, to go along with sap, is fried chicken or fowl. Therefore, the most effective propitiation is thought to be a pot of toddy and a fried fowl.  Petitioners believe that U Min Gyaw will fulfill any wish that is made to him during his trance, although he usually expects a commission.

In a typical performance, the Medium appeals to U Min Gyaw by presenting him with a bottle of liquor in one hand and a fried fowl in the other. The dancer copies the drunken style of the Spirit.

==U Shwe Yoe and Daw Moe dance==
[[File:Shwe&amp;moe.JPG|thumb|[[U Shwe Yoe]] and Daw Moe dance in Los Angeles, 2007]]
Rather than a classic, this dance is an example of contemporary Burmese [[folk art]]. The dance has appeared out of the custom of entertaining the crowd, especially volunteers taking part in Flag Days or at community charitable activities.  Its purpose is to inspire people to donate and to do meritorious deeds for the betterment of next lives.

The names [[U Shwe Yoe]] and Daw Moe are fictitious (not part of any classic text) and chosen for their rhyming effect. There is no established melody for the dance. Instead the orchestra improvises any lively tune, or recorded music is sometimes used. Enthusiastic citizens with no formal dance training often perform. The roles are one Old Bachelor ([[U Shwe Yoe]]) and one Spinster (Daw Moe), the latter played by either a male or female dancer. The choreography is spontaneous and designed to give the audience the best medicine.

The costumes are bizarre and flamboyant, with the indispensable elements of [[U Shwe Yoe]]'s (independently animated) moustache and a twirling [[Pathein]] parasol. In a jocular manner, he emotes his love and makes a pass at Daw Moe, while she responds evasively and artfully. The audience, often mostly children and old folk, clap loudly and encourage Shwe Yoe in his persistence.&lt;ref name=programnotes1&gt;Program notes of the '''Mintha Theater''' in [[Mandalay]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Yein'' group dance==
{{main|Yein}}
'''''Yein''''' is a form of [[group dance]] that features multiple dancers synchronously dancing and moving their heads, waists, feet, and hands to the beats of music, often performed by a traditional Burmese orchestra called [[hsaing waing]] or [[Drum|drums]]. It is commonly performed by troupes during [[Thingyan]].


==Zat pwe duet dance==
All-night performances, which combine melodrama, slapstick, traditional dance, and even [[pop music]] are called "zat pwe" in Burma.  These seasonal events are staged in enclosed temporary bamboo theatres and are typically part of annual [[Fundraising|fund raising]] activities at [[pagoda festival]]s.  The performers are travelling troupes, usually several dozen professional male and female dancers, musicians, comedians, and actors.  These troupes travel widely throughout the country. The Duet Dance, a standard part of the Zat Pwe, typically starts near 2- or 3-AM, and has a duration of about two hours.

Generally the lead actors dance with the lead actresses.  The male dancers make a display, often with highly athletic and inventive elements. The male and female dancers sing in duet and exchange lover's vows.

There is often a competitive aspect to see who in the troupe can win the favour of the loudest cheers. During all of this, the orchestra must synchronise to the action occurring on the stage.  When done with excellence, this dance can create national fame for the troupe.

==Zawgyi dance==

[[Zawgyi (alchemist)|Zawgyi]] is a Burmese folk character adept in the art of [[alchemy]]. He is said to have gained his supernatural skills through [[occult]] means.  He inhabits thick forests near the [[Himalaya]] where he forages herbs for magical purposes.  After searching for many years he obtained the [[Philosopher's stone]] and thereby gained Zawgyihood.  Sometimes, with a touch of his magic wand he brings to life "illusory females" from trees bearing female-shaped fruits in order fulfill his carnal wishes.

The dance illustrates Zawgyi going about the forest, prancing with his wand, pulverising herbs and gamboling in jubilation after acquiring the Stone.

{{Refimprove|date=October 2007}}

A '''calendar house''' is a house that symbolically contains architectural elements in quantities that represent the respective numbers of days in a year, weeks in a year, months in a year and days in a week. For example, [[Avon Tyrrell|Avon Tyrrell House]] in [[Hampshire]]  was built with 365 windows, 52 rooms, 12 chimneys, 4 wings and 7 external doors.{{Dubious|date=September 2017|reason=apart from unsourced, also 7 windows per room?}}.

== Examples ==

Examples are very rare and are most often found in European buildings of the late 16th and early 17th centuries.
Rose Hall Great House is a calendar house located east of [[Montego Bay, Jamaica]], that was owned by Annie Palmer. The large country estate [[Mona Vale, Tasmania|Mona Vale]] in [[Tasmania, Australia]], built in the 1880s, is said to have been designed as a calendar house.

Notable examples in Great Britain include [[Cairness House]] in [[Aberdeenshire]] and Holme Eden Hall in Cumbria. [[Knole House]] in [[Kent]] has often been said to be a calendar house although as this is a medieval house that grew organically over centuries there has never been any evidence to suggest that it is a calendar house.

Bedstone Court, now the home of Bedstone College, is a flamboyant black-and-white mansion, built between 1882 and 1884, designed by Thomas Harris for Henry Ripley, MP and is a calendar house reputed to have 365 windows, 52 rooms (on the first two floors)12 chimneys and seven external doors. The central hall has a magnificent 52 panelled stained-glass window depicting the months of the year, signs of the zodiac, birds associated with the month and the agricultural activity of the month. The building was heavily damaged by a fire in 1996 but was fully restored

[[Adare Manor]] in [[County Limerick]], Ireland is an example of a calendar house, having 365 stained-glass windows and 52 chimneys.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adaremanor.com/upload/docs/adare-manor-story.pdf ''The Adare Manor Story''], Adare Manor Promotional Booklet, p.2. Retrieved on 14 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed by the architects [[James Pain]] and [[Philip Hardwick]]. Much of the interior was designed by [[E.W. Pugin]].

Castle Grad in the north-western Goricko region of Slovenia, with its 365 rooms, is a Central European example of a calendar house.
Abbey-Cwm-Hir in mid Wales is a notable example of Victorian Gothic Revival architecture, with 52 rooms and 365 windows.  Built in 1834 by Thomas Wilson, in the 21st century it is owned by Paul and Victoria Humpherston. It has notable collections and embodies interesting interior design ideas.  All 52 rooms are accessible on tours, and everything can be touched.

The architectural programme of [[Schloss Eggenberg]] in [[Graz]], [[Austria]] is based on strict number symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;Schloss Eggenberg. By Barbara Kaiser. Graz: Christian Brandstätter Verlag, 2006. {{ISBN|978-3-902510-80-8}} (English Edition) or {{ISBN|978-3-902510-96-9}} (German Edition) and Schloss Eggenberg. Architecture and Furnishings, by Barbara Kaiser, Paul Schuster, Graz 2016. {{ISBN|978-3-90209-581-7}} (available through the [[Universalmuseum Joanneum]]) &lt;/ref&gt; The calendar theme was extremely topical: Schloss Eggenberg was built during the period of the great calendar dispute, which had started at the beginning of the Gregorian calendar reform in 1582 and not yet come to an end. The architecture of the palace is an expression of the values of the time. There are 365 outside windows, which correspond to the days of the year. Each floor consists of 31 rooms, which correspond to the days of the longest months. The 24 hours of the day correspond to the circle of 24 state rooms, 12 on each side of the symmetrical axis, which separates the palace into two corresponding halves, 12 hours for the day and 12 hours for the night. The 24 rooms have a total of 52 windows for the weeks or the amount of Sundays in the year. Adding the 8 windows in the Planetary Room, you get the number 60 which stands for the number of seconds or minutes. There are even 52 doors in the Bel Étage. In the Planetary Room itself, you can also find the 7 days of the week and the 12 months of the year. And even the park wall has 12 doors opening towards the outside, seven of which face towards the city.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.museum-joanneum.at/en/palace-and-gardens-schloss-eggenberg/princely-residence/programme''Schloss Eggenberg, official Website'']&lt;/ref&gt;

A possible Mesoamerican example is [[El Castillo, Chichen Itza]], which is a [[Mesoamerican pyramids|Mesoamerican step pyramid]] with 91 steps on each of its four sides. Taking these steps, and adding the temple platform on top as the final "step", produces a total of 365 steps.

The '''Catalan Republic''' ({{lang-ca|República Catalana}}, {{IPA-ca|rəˈpubːlikə kətəˈlanə|IPA}}) was a short-lived independent state under French protection proclaimed in 1641 by the States-General of [[Principality of Catalonia|Catalonia]] led by [[Pau Claris]], during the [[Reaper's War]].&lt;ref&gt;Gelderen, Martin van; Skinner, Quentin (2002). [https://books.google.es/books?id=H1ZgD7vlFLYC&amp;lpg=PA284&amp;hl=es&amp;pg=PA284#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Republicanism: Volume 1, Republicanism and Constitutionalism in Early Modern Europe: A Shared European Heritage]. Cambridge University Press. p. 284. {{ISBN|9781139439619}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The States-General of Catalonia, headed by the President of the [[Generalitat of Catalonia|Deputation of the General of Catalonia]] (or Generalitat) Pau Claris, proclaimed the Catalan Republic on January 17, 1641. On January 23, 1641, the ''Braços Generals'' led by Pau Claris proclaimed [[Louis XIII of France]] as Count of Barcelona, putting the [[Principality of Catalonia]] under [[France|French]] sovereignty. Louis XIII was succeeded upon his death in 1643 by [[Louis XIV]] (the 'Sun King'), who remained Count of Barcelona until 1652, when Catalonia was reincorporated into the [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish Monarchy]].

[[File:Blaeu 1641.png|thumb|left|Map of Europe with the Catalan Republic (c. 1641) by [[Willem Blaeu]].]]
During the [[Reapers' War]] which started in 1640 (and included as a part of the [[Franco-Spanish War (1635–59)|Franco-Spanish War]]) the  States-General of Catalonia ({{lang-ca|{{ill|Junta de Braços|ca}}}} or {{lang|ca|Braços Generals}}), an extraordinary council of representatives of the [[Catalan Courts]] without the king, summoted by the Generalitat, sought support in France and {{ill|Bernard du Plessis-Besançon|fr}} was appointed plenipotentiary of the King of France on August 29, 1640. On October 27 an agreement was finally reached with du Plessis-Besançon to obtain supplies against the army of the King of Spain directed by [[Pedro Fajardo, 1st Marquis of los Vélez|Pedro Fajardo, Marquis of los Vélez]]. 

With the victory of the army of the Marquis of Los Vélez in [[Tarragona]] on December 23, it continued its advance towards [[Barcelona]], while the French army of d'Espenan proceeded to leave Catalonia to France at the beginning of January 1641. Negotiations with the French intensified, on January 3 a delegation of three Catalans met with [[Cardinal Richelieu]] who assured them protection if they were a republic like [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]]. In this sense on January 14 du Plessis-Besançon went at the residence of the [[President of the Generalitat de Catalunya|president]] of the Deputation of the General of Catalonia or Generalitat, Pau Claris, to still conferring.&lt;ref&gt;Coll i Alentorn, Miquel (1992). Història I. L'Abadia de Montserrat. p. 427 {{ISBN|9788478262991}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this negotiation, on January 16, Pau Claris presented a proposal before the States-General by which the King of France agreed to put the Principality under his protection if Catalonia changed its government to a [[republic]]. On 17 January 1641, the States-General of Catalonia proclaimed the Catalan Republic under French protection for the first time. A week later, following the defeat of the Catalan army in the {{Interlanguage link|Battle of Martorell|ca|Batalla de Martorell (1641)}}, near Barcelona, du Plessis-Besançon managed to convince the Catalan authorities that the help they needed could only be obtained from France if they recognized Louis XIII of France as sovereign. Pau Claris appealed on 23 January to Louis XIII, recognzing him as [[Count of Barcelona]] (as Louis I) and placed the Principality of Catalonia under French sovereignty.

On January 26, 1641, at the end of the [[Battle of Montjuïc (1641)|Battle of Montjuïc]], the army of Philip IV was defeated by a Franco-Catalan army and had to withdraw. Pau Claris died a month later. Louis XIV was titled as Count of Barcelona in succession to his father in 1643. Finally, the dismissal of the [[Count-Duke of Olivares]], the ravages caused by the famine and the plague, as well as the commitment made by Philip IV to respect the [[Catalan constitutions]] and institutions, put an end to the war in 1652, and the Principality of Catalonia was reincorporated into the [[Habsburg Spain|Monarchy of Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Florensa i Soler |first= Núria |title=La declinación de la monarquía hispánica en el siglo XVII |publisher= Univ. de Castilla La Mancha |date= 2004 |ISBN= 8484272966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cossack uprisings''' (also '''rebellions''', '''revolts''') were a series of [[Rebellion|military conflicts]] between the [[cossacks]] and the states claiming dominion over the territories the Cossacks lived in, namely the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]&lt;ref name="Lerski1996"/&gt; and [[Russian Empire]]&lt;ref name="Newland1991-73"/&gt; during the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries. Both states tried to exert control over the independent-minded Cossacks. While the early uprisings were against the Commonwealth, as the Russian Empire gained increasing and then total control over the [[Ruthenia]]n ([[Ukraine|Ukrainian]]) lands where the Cossacks lived, the target of Cossacks uprisings changed as well.&lt;ref name="Lerski1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newland1991-71"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newland1991-72"/&gt;

The origins of the first Cossacks are disputed. Traditional [[historiography]] dates the emergence of Cossacks to the 14th to 15th centuries.&lt;ref name="Newland1991-66"/&gt; Towards the end of the 15th century, the Ukrainian Cossacks formed the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks|Zaporozhian Sich]] centered on the fortified Dnipro islands.&lt;ref name="Newland1991-67"/&gt; Initially a vassal of [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], the increasing social and religious pressure from the Commonwealth caused a series of uprisings, and the proclamation of an independent [[Cossack Hetmanate]], culminating in a [[Khmelnytskyi Uprising|rebellion]] under [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]] in the mid-17th century.&lt;ref name="Lerski1996"/&gt; While the Cossacks were useful to the Polish-Lithuanian states in the war periods, they proved to be more problematic in the peacetime, due to their raids on the Commonwealth neighbours (primarily, the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its allies).&lt;ref name="Lerski1996"/&gt; Further, the [[Polish nobility]] tried to assert control over the Cossack territories, turn them into [[feudal]] [[latifundia]], limit the growth of the militant Cossacks, and even reverse it, by turning the Cossacks into [[serfdom|serfs]].&lt;ref name="Lerski1996"/&gt; Afterward the Khmelnytsky Uprising, the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] brought most of the Cossack Hetmanate under Russian control.&lt;ref name="google"/&gt;

The Zaporozhian Cossacks were not the only notable group of Cossacks; others included the [[Don Cossack Host]], [[Dlobodsk Cossacks]], [[Terek Cossacks]] and [[Yaik Cossacks]].&lt;ref name="Newland1991-67-68"/&gt; As the [[Tsardom of Muscovy]] took over the disputed Cossacks lands from the Poland-Lithuania, eventually all Cossacks came under the Russian rule, but the Tsarist and later Imperial government had only a limited control over the Cossacks.&lt;ref name="Newland1991-70"/&gt; The Cossacks provided refugee for runaway serfs and bandits, and often mounted unauthorized raids and pirate expeditions against the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref name="Newland1991-70"/&gt; While the Cossack hosts in the [[Russian Empire]] served as buffer zones on its borders, the expansionist ambitions of the empire relied on ensuring control over the Cossacks, which caused tension with their traditional independent lifestyle.&lt;ref name="Newland1991-70"/&gt; As the empire attempted to limit Cossacks autonomy in the 17th and 18th centuries this resulted in rebellions led by [[Stenka Razin]], [[Kondraty Bulavin]] and [[Yemelyan Pugachev]].&lt;ref name="Newland1991-71"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newland1991-72"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newland1991-70"/&gt; In extreme cases, whole Hosts could be dissolved, as was the fate of the [[Zaporozhian Sich]] in 1775.&lt;ref name="Newland1991-72"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Magocsi2010"/&gt; In this last phase of their history, the Cossacks lost most of their autonomy to the Russian state.&lt;ref name="Lerski1996"/&gt;

Cossack uprisings, like the Cossack people themselves, have been portrayed variously in the [[Polish historiography|Polish]], [[Russian historiography|Russian]] and [[Ukrainian historiography|Ukrainian]] [[historiography|historiographers]].&lt;ref name="Gordon1983-249"/&gt;

{{Cyborg}}
'''Cyberspace''' is interconnected [[technology]]. The term entered the popular culture from science fiction and the arts but is now used by technology strategists, security professionals, government, military and industry leaders and entrepreneurs to describe the domain of the global technology environment. Others consider cyberspace to be just a notional environment in which communication over computer networks occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/cyberspace | title=Cyberspace &amp;#124; Definition of cyberspace in US English by Oxford Dictionaries}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word became popular in the 1990s when the uses of the Internet, networking, and digital communication were all growing dramatically and the term "cyberspace" was able to represent the many new ideas and phenomena that were emerging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strate|first=Lance|title=The varieties of cyberspace: Problems in definition and delimitation|journal=Western Journal of Communication|year=1999|volume=63|issue=3|pages=382–3|doi=10.1080/10570319909374648}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been called the largest unregulated and uncontrolled domain in the history of mankind,&lt;ref&gt;As described by retired General Michael Hayden to [https://www.linkedin.com/in/bob-ackerman-a233336/ Bob Ackerman], Founder and Managing Director of AllegisCyber.&lt;/ref&gt; and is also unique because it is a domain created by people vice the traditional physical domains. 

The parent term of cyberspace is "[[cybernetics]]", derived from the Ancient Greek ''κυβερνήτης'' (''kybernētēs'', steersman, governor, pilot, or rudder), a word introduced by [[Norbert Wiener]] for his pioneering work in electronic communication and control science. This word cyberspace first appeared in the art installation of the same name by danish artist [[Susanne Ussing]], 1968).&lt;ref name="http://www.kunstkritikk.dk"&gt;Kunstkritikk, [http://www.kunstkritikk.dk/kommentar/the-reinvention-of-cyberspace/ ''"The (Re)invention of Cyberspace"'']&lt;/ref&gt;

As a social experience, individuals can interact, exchange ideas, share information, provide social support, conduct business, direct actions, create artistic media, play games, engage in political discussion, and so on, using this global network. They are sometimes referred to as ''cybernauts''. The term ''cyberspace'' has become a conventional means to describe anything associated with the [[Internet]] and the diverse [[Cyberculture|Internet culture]]. The United States government recognizes the interconnected information technology and the interdependent network of [[information technology]] infrastructures operating across this medium as part of the US national [[critical infrastructure]]. Amongst individuals on cyberspace, there is believed to be a code of shared rules and ethics mutually beneficial for all to follow, referred to as [[cyberethics]]. Many view the [[right to privacy]] as most important to a functional code of [[cyberethics]].&lt;ref name="cyberethics"&gt;Richard A. Spinello, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=mE8NEL5JdmAC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP2&amp;dq=cyberethics&amp;ots=N0hnxToCjZ&amp;sig=zOZQBEADTaLt6efQBfOxXsWjsEY ''"Cyberethics: Morality and Law in Cyberspace"'']&lt;/ref&gt;  Such moral responsibilities go hand in hand when working online with global networks, specifically, when opinions are involved with online social experiences.&lt;ref name="georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov"&gt;White House, [https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/pcipb/ ''"The National Strategy To Secure Cyberspace"'']&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Chip Morningstar]] and [[F. Randall Farmer]], cyberspace is defined more by the social interactions involved rather than its technical implementation.&lt;ref&gt;Morningstar, Chip and F. Randall Farmer. The Lessons of Lucasfilm's Habitat. ''The New Media Reader''. Ed. Wardrip-Fruin and Nick Montfort: The MIT Press, 2003. 664-667. Print&lt;/ref&gt; In their view, the computational medium in cyberspace is an augmentation of the communication channel between real people; the core characteristic of cyberspace is that it offers an environment that consists of many participants with the ability to affect and influence each other. They derive this concept from the observation that people seek richness, complexity, and depth within a virtual world.

==Origins of the term==

The term "cyberspace" first appeared in the visual arts in the late 1960s, when Danish artist [[Susanne Ussing]] (1940-1998) and her partner architect Carsten Hoff (b. 1934) constituted themselves as Atelier Cyberspace. Under this name the two made a series of installations and images entitled "sensory spaces" that were based on the principle of open systems adaptable to various influences, such as human movement and the behaviour of new materials.&lt;ref name="kunstkritikk.com"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kunstkritikk.com/kommentar/the-reinvention-of-cyberspace/ | title=The (Re)invention of Cyberspace}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atelier Cyberspace worked at a time when the Internet did not exist and computers were more or less off-limit to artists and creative engagement. In a 2015-interview with Scandinavian art magazine Kunstkritikk, Carsten Hoff recollects, that although Atelier Cyberspace did try to implement computers, they had no interest in the virtual space as such:&lt;ref name="kunstkritikk.com"/&gt;

{{quote|To us, "cyberspace" was simply about managing spaces. There was nothing esoteric about it. Nothing digital, either. It was just a tool. The space was concrete, physical.}}

And in the same interview Hoff continues:

{{quote|Our shared point of departure was that we were working with physical settings, and we were both frustrated and displeased with the architecture from the period, particularly when it came to spaces for living. We felt that there was a need to loosen up the rigid confines of urban planning, giving back the gift of creativity to individual human beings and allowing them to shape and design their houses or dwellings themselves – instead of having some clever architect pop up, telling you how you should live. We were thinking in terms of open-ended systems where things could grow and evolve as required.

For instance, we imagined a kind of mobile production unit, but unfortunately the drawings have been lost. It was a kind of truck with a nozzle at the back. Like a bee building its hive. The nozzle would emit and apply material that grew to form amorphous mushrooms or whatever you might imagine. It was supposed to be computer-controlled, allowing you to create interesting shapes and sequences of spaces. It was a merging of organic and technological systems, a new way of structuring the world. And a response that counteracted industrial uniformity. We had this idea that sophisticated software might enable us to mimic the way in which nature creates products – where things that belong to the same family can take different forms. All oak trees are oak trees, but no two oak trees are exactly alike. And then a whole new material – polystyrene foam – arrived on the scene. It behaved like nature in the sense that it grew when its two component parts were mixed. Almost like a fungal growth. This made it an obvious choice for our work in Atelier Cyberspace.}}

The works of Atelier Cyberspace were originally shown at a number of Copenhagen venues and have later been exhibited at The National Gallery of Denmark in Copenhagen as part of the exhibition "What’s Happening?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.smk.dk/en/visit-the-museum/exhibitions/whats-happening/introduction-to-the-exhibition/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-08-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160717203022/http://www.smk.dk/en/visit-the-museum/exhibitions/whats-happening/introduction-to-the-exhibition/ |archive-date=2016-07-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "cyberspace" first appeared in fiction in the 1980s in the work of [[cyberpunk]] science fiction author [[William Gibson]], first in his 1982 short story "[[Burning Chrome]]" and later in his 1984 novel ''[[Neuromancer]]''.&lt;ref name=wired&gt;{{cite news |work=WIRED |title=March 17, 1948: William Gibson, Father of Cyberspace | author=Scott Thil | date=March 17, 2009 | url=https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2009/03/dayintech_0317}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the next few years, the word became prominently identified with online computer networks. The portion of ''Neuromancer'' cited in this respect is usually the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gibson | first = William | title = Neuromancer | publisher = Ace Books | location = New York | year = 1984 | isbn = 978-0-441-56956-4 | page = 69 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Cyberspace. A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation, by children being taught mathematical concepts... A graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system. Unthinkable complexity. Lines of light ranged in the nonspace of the mind, clusters and constellations of data. Like city lights, receding.}}

Now widely used, the term has since been criticized by Gibson, who commented on the origin of the term in the 2000 documentary ''[[No Maps for These Territories]]'':

{{quote|All I knew about the word "cyberspace" when I coined it, was that it seemed like an effective buzzword. It seemed evocative and essentially meaningless. It was suggestive of something, but had no real semantic meaning, even for me, as I saw it emerge on the page.}}

===Metaphorical===
Don Slater uses a metaphor to define cyberspace, describing the "sense of a social setting that exists purely within a space of representation and communication ... it exists entirely within a computer space, distributed across increasingly complex and fluid networks." The term "Cyberspace" started to become a de facto synonym for the Internet, and later the [[World Wide Web]], during the 1990s, especially in academic circles&lt;ref&gt;Vanderbilt University, [http://www.vanderbilt.edu/ans/english/clayton/sch295.htm "Postmodernism and the Culture of Cyberspace"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070107094002/http://www.vanderbilt.edu/AnS/english/Clayton/sch295.htm |date=2007-01-07 }}, Fall 1996 course syllabus&lt;/ref&gt; and activist communities. Author [[Bruce Sterling]], who popularized this meaning,&lt;ref&gt;''Principia Cybernetica'' [http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/CYBSPACE.html "Cyberspace"]&lt;/ref&gt; credits [[John Perry Barlow]] as the first to use it to refer to "the present-day nexus of computer and telecommunications networks". Barlow describes it thus in his essay to announce the formation of the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (note the spatial metaphor) in June 1990:&lt;ref&gt;John Perry Barlow, [http://w2.eff.org/Misc/Publications/John_Perry_Barlow/HTML/crime_and_puzzlement_1.html "Crime and Puzzlement,"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101093314/http://w2.eff.org/Misc/Publications/John_Perry_Barlow/HTML/crime_and_puzzlement_1.html |date=2012-01-01 }} June 8, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In this silent world, all conversation is typed. To enter it, one forsakes both body and place and becomes a thing of words alone. You can see what your neighbors are saying (or recently said), but not what either they or their physical surroundings look like. Town meetings are continuous and discussions rage on everything from sexual kinks to depreciation schedules.

Whether by one telephonic tendril or millions, they are all connected to one another. Collectively, they form what their inhabitants call the Net. It extends across that immense region of electron states, microwaves, magnetic fields, light pulses and thought which sci-fi writer William Gibson named Cyberspace.|John Perry Barlow|"Crime and Puzzlement", 1990-06-08}}

As Barlow, and the EFF, continued public education efforts to promote the idea of "[[digital rights]]", the term was increasingly used during the Internet boom of the late 1990s.

===Virtual environments===
Although the present-day, loose use of the term "cyberspace" no longer implies or suggests immersion in a virtual reality, current technology allows the integration of a number of capabilities (sensors, signals, connections, transmissions, processors, and controllers) sufficient to generate a [[Virtuality|virtual]] interactive experience that is accessible regardless of a geographic location.  It is for these reasons cyberspace has been described as the ultimate [[tax haven]].&lt;ref name="tsin"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Sovereign Individual |last=Davidson |first=James Dale |author2=William Rees-Mogg |year=1999 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=978-0684832722 |page=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, [[Autodesk]], an American multinational corporation that focuses on 2D and 3D design software, developed a virtual design system called Cyberspace.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Pollack, New York Times, [https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/10/business/for-artificial-reality-wear-a-computer.html "For Artificial Reality, Wear A Computer,"] April 10, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent definitions of Cyberspace===

Although several definitions of cyberspace can be found both in scientific literature and in official governmental sources, there is no fully agreed official definition yet. According to F. D. Kramer there are 28 different definitions of the term cyberspace.  See in particular the following links: "Cyberpower and National Security: Policy Recommendations for a Strategic Framework,"  in Cyberpower and National Security, FD Kramer, S. Starr, L.K. Wentz (ed.), National Defense University Press, Washington (DC) 2009; see also Mayer, M., Chiarugi, I., De Scalzi, N., https://www.academia.edu/14336129/International_Politics_in_the_Digital_Age.

The most recent draft definition is the following:

{{quote|Cyberspace is a global and dynamic domain (subject to constant change) characterized by the combined use of electrons and electromagnetic spectrum, whose purpose is to create, store, modify, exchange, share and extract, use, eliminate information and disrupt physical resources.  Cyberspace includes: a) physical infrastructures and telecommunications devices that allow for the connection of technological and communication system networks, understood in the broadest sense (SCADA devices, smartphones/tablets, computers, servers, etc.); b) computer systems (see point a) and the related (sometimes embedded) software that guarantee the domain's basic operational functioning and connectivity; c) networks between computer systems; d) networks of networks that connect computer systems (the distinction between networks and networks of networks is mainly organizational); e) the access nodes of users and intermediaries routing nodes; f) constituent data (or resident data).  Often, in common parlance (and sometimes in commercial language), networks of networks are called Internet (with a lowercase i), while networks between computers are called intranet.  Internet (with a capital I, in journalistic language sometimes called the Net) can be considered a part of the system a).  A distinctive and constitutive feature of cyberspace is that no central entity exercises control over all the networks that make up this new domain.&lt;ref&gt;Definition by Marco Mayer, Luigi Martino, Pablo Mazurier and Gergana Tzvetkova, Draft Pisa, 19 May 2014 https://www.academia.edu/7096442/How_would_you_define_Cyberspace&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Just as in the real world there is no world government, cyberspace lacks an institutionally predefined hierarchical center.  To cyberspace, a domain without a hierarchical ordering principle, we can therefore extend the definition of international politics coined by Kenneth Waltz: as being "with no system of law enforceable."  This does not mean that the dimension of power in cyberspace is absent, nor that power is dispersed and scattered into a thousand invisible streams, nor that it is evenly spread across myriad people and organizations, as some scholars had predicted.  On the contrary, cyberspace is characterized by a precise structuring of hierarchies of power.&lt;ref&gt;The most recent analysis of the interaction of Cyberspace and International politics has been investigated in the MIT, Harvard and CFR ECIR project (Explorations in cyber International Relations).  ECIR Principal Investigator is Nazli Choucri http://ecir.mit.edu/http://web.mit.edu/polisci/people/faculty/nazli-choucri.html{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] of the [[United States Department of Defense]] define cyberspace as one of five interdependent domains, the remaining four being land, air, maritime, and space.&lt;ref name=JP3-12&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.jcs.mil/Portals/36/Documents/Doctrine/pubs/jp3_12R.pdf |title=DoD Joint Publication 3-12(R) Cyberspace Operations (5 February 2013) |access-date=2018-12-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180127164919/http://www.jcs.mil/Portals/36/Documents/Doctrine/pubs/jp3_12R.pdf |archive-date=2018-01-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''See [[United States Cyber Command]]''

==Cyberspace as an Internet metaphor==
{{See also|Internet metaphors}}

While cyberspace should not be confused with the Internet, the term is often used to refer to objects and identities that exist largely within the communication network itself, so that a [[website]], for example, might be metaphorically said to "exist in cyberspace".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/geoj.12009 |title=Geography/internet: Ethereal alternate dimensions of cyberspace or grounded augmented realities? |journal=The Geographical Journal |volume=179 |issue=2 |pages=177–182 |year=2013 |last1=Graham |first1=Mark }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this interpretation, events taking place on the Internet are not happening in the locations where participants or servers are physically located, but "in cyberspace". The philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] used the term [[Heterotopia (space)|heterotopias]], to describe such spaces which are simultaneously physical and mental.

Firstly, cyberspace describes the flow of digital data through the network of interconnected computers: it is at once not "real", since one could not spatially locate it as a tangible object, and clearly "real" in its effects. There have been several attempts to create a concise model about how cyberspace works since it is not a physical thing that can be looked at. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bryant|first=William|date=November–December 2013|title=Cyberspace Superiority A Conceptual Model |url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a589636.pdf |journal=Air &amp; Space Power Journal|volume=27|pages=25–44|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, cyberspace is the site of [[computer-mediated communication]] (CMC), in which online relationships and alternative forms of online identity were enacted, raising important questions about the social psychology of Internet use, the relationship between "online" and "offline" forms of life and interaction, and the relationship between the "real" and the virtual. Cyberspace draws attention to remediation of culture through [[new media]] technologies: it is not just a communication tool but a social destination, and is culturally significant in its own right. Finally, cyberspace can be seen as providing new opportunities to reshape society and culture through "hidden" identities, or it can be seen as borderless communication and culture.&lt;ref&gt;New Media, an Introduction: Flew, Terry&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Cyberspace is the "place" where a telephone conversation appears to occur. Not inside your actual phone, the plastic device on your desk. Not inside the other person's phone, in some other city. '''The place between''' the phones. [...] in the past twenty years, this electrical "space," which was once thin and dark and one-dimensional—little more than a narrow speaking-tube, stretching from phone to phone—has flung itself open like a gigantic jack-in-the-box. Light has flooded upon it, the eerie light of the glowing computer screen. This dark electric netherworld has become a vast flowering electronic landscape. Since the 1960s, the world of the telephone has cross-bred itself with computers and television, and though there is still no substance to cyberspace, nothing you can handle, it has a strange kind of physicality now. It makes good sense today to talk of cyberspace as a place all its own.|Bruce Sterling|Introduction to '''[[The Hacker Crackdown]]'''}}

The "space" in cyberspace has more in common with the abstract, mathematical meanings of the term (see [[space]]) than physical space. It does not have the duality of positive and negative volume (while in physical space for example a room has the negative volume of usable space delineated by positive volume of walls, Internet users cannot enter the screen and explore the unknown part of the Internet as an extension of the space they are in), but spatial meaning can be attributed to the relationship between different [[Web page|page]]s (of books as well as [[web server]]s), considering the unturned pages to be somewhere "out there." The concept of cyberspace therefore refers not to the content being presented to the surfer, but rather to the possibility of surfing among different sites, with [[feedback|feedback loops]] between the user and the rest of the system creating the potential to always encounter something unknown or unexpected.

[[Video game]]s differ from text-based communication in that on-screen images are meant to be figures that actually occupy a space and the animation shows the movement of those figures. Images are supposed to form the positive volume that delineates the empty space. A game adopts the cyberspace metaphor by engaging more players in the game, and then figuratively representing them on the screen as [[Avatar (virtual reality)|avatar]]s. Games do not have to stop at the avatar-player level, but current implementations aiming for more [[immersion (virtual reality)|immersive]] playing space (i.e. [[Laser tag]]) take the form of [[augmented reality]] rather than cyberspace, fully immersive virtual realities remaining impractical.

Although the more radical consequences of the global communication network predicted by some cyberspace proponents (i.e. the diminishing of state influence envisioned by John Perry Barlow&lt;ref&gt;John Perry Barlow, [http://homes.eff.org/~barlow/Declaration-Final.html "A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace"], February 8, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;) failed to materialize and the word lost some of its novelty appeal, it remains current {{as of|2006|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name="georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.findlaw.com/legalnews/scitech/cyber/ ''FindLaw Legal News'' site], Tech and IP: Cyberspace section, retrieved November 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[virtual communities]] explicitly refer to the concept of cyberspace, for example [[Linden Lab]] calling their customers "[[Resident (Second Life)|Residents]]" of [[Second Life]], while all such communities can be positioned "in cyberspace" for explanatory and comparative purposes (as did Sterling in ''The Hacker Crackdown'', followed by many journalists), integrating the metaphor into a wider [[cyberculture|cyber-culture]].

The metaphor has been useful in helping a new generation of thought leaders to reason through new military strategies around the world, led largely by the US Department of Defense (DoD).&lt;ref&gt;Cyber Conflict Studies Association, [http://www.cyberconflict.org CCSA]&lt;/ref&gt; The use of cyberspace as a metaphor has had its limits, however, especially in areas where the metaphor becomes confused with physical infrastructure. It has also been critiqued as being unhelpful for falsely employing a spatial metaphor to describe what is inherently a network.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Alternate realities in philosophy and art==

===Predating computers===
A forerunner of the modern ideas of cyberspace is the [[Descartes|Cartesian]] notion that people might be deceived by an evil demon that feeds them a false reality. This argument is the direct predecessor of modern ideas of a [[brain in a vat]] and many popular conceptions of cyberspace take Descartes's ideas as their starting point.

[[Visual arts]] have a tradition, stretching [[Zeuxis and Parrhasius|back to antiquity]], of artifacts meant to [[Trompe-l'œil|fool the eye]] and be mistaken for reality. This questioning of reality occasionally led some philosophers and especially theologians{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} to distrust art as deceiving people into entering a world which was not real (see [[Aniconism]]). The artistic challenge was resurrected with increasing ambition as art became more and more realistic with the invention of photography, film (see ''[[L'Arrivée d'un Train en Gare de la Ciotat|Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat]]''), and immersive computer simulations.

===Influenced by computers===

====Philosophy====
American [[counterculture]] exponents like [[William S. Burroughs]] (whose literary influence on Gibson and cyberpunk in general is widely acknowledged&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Laurence]], [http://www.altx.com/int2/john.shirley.html An Interview with [[John Shirley]]], 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.streettech.com/bcp/BCPgraf/CyberCulture/bgtg.htm "Burroughs/Gysin/Throbbing Gristle"], retrieved December 31, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[Timothy Leary]]&lt;ref&gt;"Internet will be the LSD of the 90s", quoted by [http://www.timothyleary.us/timothyleary.html an on-line biography] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209063453/http://www.timothyleary.us/timothyleary.html |date=2006-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; were among the first to extol the potential of computers and computer networks for individual empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;[[Douglas Rushkoff]], [http://www.deepleafproductions.com/utopialibrary/text/rushkoff-godfathers.html "Godfathers of Cyberspace"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some contemporary philosophers and scientists (e.g. [[David Deutsch]] in ''The Fabric of Reality'') employ virtual reality in various [[thought experiment]]s. For example, [[Philip Zhai]] in ''Get Real: A Philosophical Adventure in Virtual Reality'' connects cyberspace to the platonic tradition:

{{quote|Let us imagine a nation in which everyone is hooked up to a network of VR infrastructure. They have been so hooked up since they left their mother's wombs. Immersed in cyberspace and maintaining their life by teleoperation, they have never imagined that life could be any different from that. The first person that thinks of the possibility of an alternative world like ours would be ridiculed by the majority of these citizens, just like the few enlightened ones in Plato's allegory of the cave.}}

Note that this [[brain-in-a-vat]] argument conflates cyberspace with [[reality]], while the more common descriptions of cyberspace contrast it with the "real world".

===Cyber-Geography===
The “Geography of Notopia” (Papadimitriou, 2006) theorizes about the complex interplay of cyber-cultures and the geographical space. This interplay has several philosophical and psychological facets (Papadimitriou, 2009).

====A New Communication Model====

The technological convergence of the mass media is the result of a long adaptation process of their communicative resources to the evolutionary changes of each historical moment. Thus, the new media became (plurally) an extension of the traditional media on the cyberspace, allowing to the public access information in a wide range of digital devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Communication Model of Virtual Universe |publisher = Grin Verlag|date = 2014-01-28|location = Munich|isbn = 9783656569916|first = Marcelo Mendonca|last = Teixeira|first2 = Tiago Alessandro Espinola|last2 = Ferreira}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, it is a cultural virtualization of human reality as a result of the migration from physical to virtual space (mediated by the ICTs), ruled by codes, signs and particular social relationships. Forwards, arise instant ways of communication, interaction and possible quick access to information, in which we are no longer mere senders, but also producers, reproducers, co-workers and providers. New technologies also help to "connect" people from different cultures outside the virtual space, what was unthinkable fifty years ago. In this giant relationships web, we mutually absorb each other’s beliefs, customs, values, laws and habits, cultural legacies perpetuated by a physical-virtual dynamics in constant metamorphosis (ibidem). In this sense, Professor Doctor Marcelo Mendonça Teixeira created, in 2013, a new model of communication to the virtual universe,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Communication-Model-Virtual-Universe/dp/3656569916&lt;/ref&gt; based in Claude Elwood Shannon (1948) article "A Mathematical Theory of Communication".

Having originated among writers, the concept of cyberspace remains most popular in literature and film. Although artists working with other media have expressed interest in the concept, such as [[Roy Ascott]], "cyberspace" in [[digital art]] is mostly used as a synonym for [[immersive virtual reality]] and remains more discussed than enacted.&lt;ref&gt;Eduardo Kac, [http://www.ekac.org/Telepresence.art._94.html ''"Telepresence Art"''] {{Webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090713053014/http://www.ekac.org/Telepresence.art._94.html |date=2009-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Computer crime====
{{Main|Computer crime}}

Cyberspace also brings together every service and facility imaginable to expedite money laundering. One can purchase anonymous credit cards, bank accounts, encrypted global mobile telephones, and false passports. From there one can pay professional advisors to set up IBCs (International Business Corporations, or corporations with anonymous ownership) or similar structures in OFCs (Offshore Financial Centers). Such advisors are loath to ask any penetrating questions about the wealth and activities of their clients, since the average fees criminals pay them to launder their money can be as much as 20 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1467-8497.00284 |title=Dot.Con: The Dangers of Cyber Crime and a Call for Proactive Solutions |journal=Australian Journal of Politics and History |volume=49 |pages=102–109 |year=2003 |last1=Granville |first1=Johanna }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====5-level model====
In 2010, a five-level model was designed in France. According to this model, cyberspace is composed of five layers based on information discoveries: language, writing, printing, Internet, etc. This original model links the world of information to telecommunication technologies.

==Popular culture examples==
* The anime ''[[Digimon]]'' is set in a variant of the cyberspace concept called the "Digital World". The Digital World is a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] made up of data from the Internet. Similar to cyberspace, except that people could physically enter this world instead of merely using a computer.
* The anime ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'' is set in the future where cyberization of humanity is commonplace and the world is connected by a vast electronic network. 
* The CGI series, ''[[ReBoot]]'', takes place entirely inside cyberspace, which is composed of two worlds: the Net and the Web.
* In the film ''[[Tron]]'', a programmer was physically transferred to the program world, where programs were personalities, resembling the forms of their creators.
* In the film ''[[Virtuosity]]'' a program encapsulating a super-criminal within a virtual world simulation escapes into the "real world".
* In the novel ''[[Simulacron-3]]'' the author Daniel F. Galouye explores multiple levels of "reality" represented by the multiple levels of computer simulation involved.
* The idea of "the matrix" in the film ''[[The Matrix]]'' resembles a complex form of cyberspace where people are "jacked in" from birth and do not know that the reality they experience is virtual.
* In the televised remote controlled robot competition series ''[[Robot Wars (TV series)|Robot Wars]]'', the ''[[Megahurtz]]'' and subsequently ''[[Terrorhurtz]]'' team and their robot were introduced as being "from Cyberspace", a nod to their online collaborative formation.
* In the 1984 novel ''[[Neuromancer]]'' the author William Gibson introduces the idea of a virtual reality data space called "the Matrix".
* The British 1960s spy/fantasy TV show ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' used [[antagonists]] called Cybernauts. Their nature, however, was merely that of murderous remote-controlled humanoid robots.

[[Image:Restoration Theatre Drolls 1662.jpg|thumb|[[Book frontispiece|Frontispiece]] to ''The Wits or Sport upon Sport'' (London, 1662). Attributed to [[Francis Kirkman]].]]
A '''droll''' is a short comical sketch of a type that originated during the [[English Interregnum|Puritan Interregnum]] in [[England]]. With the closure of the theatres, actors were left without any way of plying their art. Borrowing scenes from well-known plays of the [[Elizabethan theatre]], they added dancing and other entertainments and performed these, sometimes illegally, to make money. Along with the popularity of the source play, material for drolls was generally chosen for physical humor or for wit.

[[Francis Kirkman]]'s ''The Wits, or Sport Upon Sport'', [[1662 in literature|1662]], is a collection of twenty-seven drolls. Three are adapted from [[Shakespeare]]: [[Shakespeare in performance|''Bottom the Weaver'']] from ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', the gravedigger's scene from ''[[Hamlet]]'', and a collection of scenes involving [[Falstaff]] called ''The Bouncing Knight''. A typical droll presented a subplot from [[John Marston (poet)|John Marston]]'s ''[[The Dutch Courtesan]]''; the piece runs together all the scenes in which a greedy vintner is gulled and robbed by a deranged gallant. 

Just under half of the drolls in Kirkman's book are adapted from the work of [[Francis Beaumont|Beaumont]] and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|Fletcher]]. Among the drolls taken from those authors are ''Forc'd Valour'' (the title plot from ''[[The Humorous Lieutenant]]''), ''The Stallion'' (the scenes in the male [[brothel]] from ''[[The Custom of the Country (play)|The Custom of the Country]]''), and the taunting of Pharamond from ''[[Philaster (play)|Philaster]]''.  The prominence of Beaumont and Fletcher in this collection prefigures their dominance on the early Restoration stage. The extract from their ''[[Beggar's Bush]]'', known as ''The Lame Commonwealth'', features additional dialogue, strongly suggesting it was taken from a performance text. The character of Clause, the [[King of the Gypsies|King of the Beggars]] in that extract, appears as a character in later works, such as the memoirs of [[Bampfylde Moore Carew]], the self-proclaimed King of the Beggars.

Actor [[Robert Cox (actor)|Robert Cox]] was perhaps the best-known of the droll performers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4753">'''The Eponym dating system''' was a [[Calendar|calendar system]] for [[Assyria]], for a period of over one thousand years. Every year was associated with the name, an [[eponym]], of the [[Limmu]], the individual holding office. 

The dating system is thought to have originated in the ancient city of [[Assur]], and remained the official dating system in Assyria until the end of the Assyrian Empire in the seventh century BC. The names of the Limmu who became eponyms were originally chosen by lot [[sortition]], until the first millennium it became a fixed rotation of officers headed by the king who constituted the limmu. The earliest known attestations of a year eponyms are at [[Kültepe|Karum-Kanesh]], and became used in other Assyrian colonies in Anatolia. Its spread was due to [[Shamshi-Adad I]]'s unification of northern [[Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.netours.com/content/view/75/29/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limmu lists==
{{update|a much wider range of dates than suggested below is now available, some discovered only in quite recent years|date=November 2012}}
With the establishment of eponym lists, succinct statements about events were sometimes added in order to keep track of the sequence. The limmu lists themselves run from 911 through to 631 BC, and are dated with the aid of the [[Canon of Kings|Canon of Ptolemaeus]], which coincides with dates from the Canon between 747 and 631 BC. According to one limmu list, a solar eclipse occurred in the tenth reigning year of the Assyrian king Aššur-dan II, in the month of Sivan (May–June on the Gregorian calendar), by Bur-Sagale. Using the [[Canon of Kings]] the tenth year can be dated to 763 BC, and modern astronomy dating has backed the [[Assyrian eclipse]] up as June 15, 763 BC. Other events can be dated from this establishment of fact, such as the taking of the Egyptian city of Thebes by the Assyrians in 664 BC, and to be able to determine the date of the minting of ancient coins.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.netours.com/content{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Out of 19 surviving clay tablets with limmus, they between them show ten manuscripts that contain lists of years identified by the eponym with a summary note about what happened that year, most often military campaigns. Thus, such lists provide historians a way of dating long stretches of the Neo-Assyrian history, and give us in details military exploits and which were considered the most important. Such a translation can be found below (With BC added).

==Biography==
Guru Angad was born in a village, with birth name of Lehna, to [[Hindu]] parents living in northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent called the Punjab region. He was the son of a small but successful trader named Pheru Mal. His mother's name was Mata Ramo (also known as Mata Sabhirai, Mansa Devi and  Daya Kaur).&lt;ref name=eos&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.learnpunjabi.org/eos/index.aspx |title=Guru Angad |last1=McLeod |first=W.H.|website=Encyclopaedia of Sikhism |publisher=Punjabi University Punjabi |access-date=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like all the Sikh Gurus, Lehna came from Khatri caste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Shackle | first=Christopher |author2=Mandair, Arvind-Pal Singh | year=2005 | title=Teachings of the Sikh Gurus: Selections from the Sikh Scriptures | publisher=Routledge  | location=United Kingdom | isbn = 0-415-26604-1 | page=xv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At age 16, Angad married a Khatri girl named [[Mata Khivi]] in January 1520. They had two sons (Dasu and Datu) and one or two daughters (Amro and Anokhi), depending on the primary sources.&lt;ref name=eos/&gt; The entire family of his father had left their ancestral village in fear of the invasion of [[Babur|Babar]]'s armies. After this the family settled at Khadur Sahib, a village by the [[River Beas]] near what is now [[Tarn Taran Sahib|Tarn Taran]].

Before becoming a Sikh and his renaming as Angad, Lehna was a religious teacher and priest who performed services focussed on [[Durga]] (Devi [[Shaktism]], the goddess tradition of [[Hinduism]]).&lt;ref name="Fenech2014p36"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ColeSambhi1995p18"/&gt;&lt;ref name=eos/&gt; Bhai Lehna in his late 20s sought out Guru Nanak, became his disciple, and displayed deep and loyal service to his [[Guru]] for about six to seven years in Kartarpur.&lt;ref name=eos/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sikka|first1=A.S.|title=Complete Poetical Works Of Ajit Singh Sikka|date=2003|publisher=Atlantic Publishers and Distribution|page=951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selection as successor===
Several stories in the Sikh tradition describe reasons why Bhai Lehna was chosen by Guru Nanak over his own sons as his successor. One of these stories is about a jug which fell into mud, and Guru Nanak asked his sons to pick it up. Guru Nanak's sons would not pick it up because it was dirty or menial a task. Then he asked Bhai Lehna, who however picked it out of the mud, washed it clean, and presented it to Guru Nanak full of water.&lt;ref name="Cole 1978 18"&gt;{{cite book | last=Cole | first=W. Owen |author2=Sambhi, Piara Singh | year=1978 | title=The Sikhs: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices | publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul | location=London| isbn = 0-7100-8842-6 | pages=18 | nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guru Nanak touched him and renamed him Angad (from ''Ang'', or part of the body) and named him as his successor and the second Nanak on 13 June 1539.&lt;ref name=eos/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fenech2014p22"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pashaura Singh|author2=Louis E. Fenech|title=The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8I0NAwAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-969930-8|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of Guru Nanak on 22 September 1539, Guru Angad left Kartarpur for the village of Khadur Sahib (near Goindwal Sahib). This move may have been suggested by Guru Nanak, as the succession to ''gurgaddi'' (seat of Guru) by Guru Angad was disputed and claimed by the two sons of Guru Nanak: Sri Chand and Lakhmi Das.&lt;ref name="Mandair2013p35"/&gt; Post succession, at one point, very few Sikhs accepted Guru Angad as their leader and while the sons of Guru Nanak claimed to be the successors. Guru Angad focussed on the teachings of Nanak, and building the community through charitable works such as [[Langar (Sikhism)|langar]].&lt;ref name="Fenech2014p41"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pashaura Singh|author2=Louis E. Fenech|title=The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8I0NAwAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-969930-8|pages=41–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with the Mughal Empire===
The second [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor of India [[Humayun]] visited Guru Angad at around 1540 after Humayun lost the Battle of Kannauj, and thereby the Mughal throne to [[Sher Shah Suri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Singh|first1=Pashaura|last2=Fenech|first2=Louis|title=The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780191004124|page=41|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sikh hagiographies, when Humayun arrived in Gurdwara Mal Akhara Sahib at [[Tarn Taran Sahib#Khadur Sahib|Khadur Sahib]] Guru Angad was sitting and listening to hymns of the [[Sangat (term)|sangat]]. The failure to greet the Emperor immediately angered Humayun. Humayun lashed out but the Guru reminded him that the time when you needed to fight when you lost your throne you ran away and did not fight and now you want to attack a person engaged in prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Singh|first1=Gurpreet|title=Ten Masters|date=2001|publisher=Diamond Pocket Books (P) Ltd.|location=New Delhi|isbn=9788171829460|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Sikh texts written more than a century after the event, Guru Angad is said to have blessed the emperor, and reassured him that someday he will regain the throne.&lt;ref name="Fenech2014p41"/&gt;

===Death and successor===
Before his death, Guru Angad, following the example set by [[Guru Nanak]], nominated [[Guru Amar Das]] as his successor (The Third Nanak). Before he converted to Sikhism, Amar Das had been a religious [[Hindu]] (Vaishnava, [[Vishnu]] focussed), reputed to have gone on some twenty pilgrimages into the [[Himalayas]], to [[Haridwar]] on river Ganges. About 1539, on one such Hindu pilgrimage, he met a Hindu monk (''sadhu'') who asked him why he did not have a [[guru]] (teacher, spiritual counsellor) and Amar Das decided to get one.&lt;ref name=eosamardas/&gt; On his return, he heard Bibi Amro, the daughter of the Guru Angad who had married into a Hindu family, singing a hymn by [[Guru Nanak]].&lt;ref name="FenechMcLeod2014p29"/&gt; Amar Das learnt from her about Guru Angad, and with her help met the second Guru of Sikhism in 1539, and adopted Guru Angad as his spiritual Guru who was much younger than his own age.&lt;ref name=eosamardas/&gt;

Amar Das displayed relentless devotion and service to Guru Angad. Sikh tradition states that he woke up in the early hours to fetch water for Guru Angad's bath, cleaned and cooked for the volunteers with the Guru, as well devoted much time to meditation and prayers in the morning and evening.&lt;ref name=eosamardas/&gt; Guru Angad named Amar Das as his successor in 1552, instead of naming his surviving son Shri Chand.&lt;ref name=cole20/&gt;&lt;ref name="FenechMcLeod2014p29"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Louis E. Fenech|author2=W. H. McLeod|title=Historical Dictionary of Sikhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xajcAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA29|year=2014|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-1-4422-3601-1|pages=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Singha2000p14"&gt;{{cite book|author=H.

==Influence==
===Gurmukhi script===
[[File:Punjabi Alphabet.jpg|thumb|[[Gurmukhi]] script (partial)]]
Guru Angad is credited in the Sikh tradition with the [[Gurmukhi]] script, which is now the standard writing script for Punjabi language in India,&lt;ref name=shacklexvii&gt;{{cite book | last=Shackle | first=Christopher |author2=Mandair, Arvind-Pal Singh | year=2005 | title=Teachings of the Sikh Gurus: Selections from the Sikh Scriptures | publisher=Routledge  | location=United Kingdom | isbn = 0-415-26604-1 | pages=xvii–xviii}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to Punjabi language in Pakistan where now an Arabic script called [[Nastaliq]] is the standard.&lt;ref name="Bright1996p395"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter T. Daniels|author2=William Bright|title=The World's Writing Systems |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ospMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA395 |year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-507993-7|page=395}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Sikh scriptures and most of the historic Sikh literature have been written in the Gurmukhi script.&lt;ref name=shacklexvii/&gt;

Guru Angad's script modified the pre-existing Indo-European scripts in northern parts of the Indian subcontinent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair|title=Sikhism: A Guide for the Perplexed |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vdhLAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA36 |year=2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-1-4411-0231-7|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; The script may have already been developing before the time of Guru Angad, because there is evidence that at least one hymn was written in acrostic form by Guru Nanak, which state Cole and Sambhi gives proof that the alphabet already existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Cole | first=W. Owen |author2=Sambhi, Piara Singh | year=1978 | title=The Sikhs: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices | publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul | location=London| isbn = 0-7100-8842-6 | pages=19 | nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Guru Angad started the tradition of Mall Akhara (wrestling), where physical as well as spiritual exercises were held.{{cn|date=January 2017}} He also wrote 62 or 63 [[Salok]]s (compositions), which together constitute about one percent of the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], the primary scripture of Sikhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Shackle | first=Christopher |author2=Mandair, Arvind-Pal Singh | year=2005 | title=Teachings of the Sikh Gurus: Selections from the Sikh Scriptures | publisher=Routledge  | location=United Kingdom | isbn = 0-415-26604-1 | page= xviii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Langar and community work===
Guru Angad is notable for systematizing the institution of [[Langar (Sikhism)|langar]] in all Sikh temple premises, where visitors from near and far, could get a free simple meal in a communal seating.&lt;ref name="Mandair2013p35"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pashaura Singh|author2=Louis E. Fenech|title=The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8I0NAwAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-969930-8|page=319}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also set rules and training method for volunteers (''sevadars'') who operated the kitchen, placing emphasis on treating it as a place of rest and refuge, being always polite and hospitable to all visitors.&lt;ref name="Mandair2013p35"/&gt;

Guru Angad visited other places and centres established by Guru Nanak for the preaching of Sikhism. He established new centres and thus strengthened its base.&lt;ref name="Mandair2013p35"/&gt;

===Mall Akahara===
The Guru, being a great patron of wrestling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Green|first1=Thomas|title=Martial Arts of the World: An Encyclopedia of History and Innovation, Volume 2|date=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara|isbn=9781598842432|page=286}}&lt;/ref&gt; started a ''Mall [[Akhara]]'' (wrestling arena) system where physical exercises, martial arts, and wrestling was taught as well as health topics such as staying away from tobacco and other toxic substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sharma|first1=Rajkumar|title=Second Sikh Guru: Shri Guru Angad Sahib Ji|date=2014|publisher=Lulu Press|isbn=9781312189553}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chowdhry|first1=Mohindra|title=Defence of Europe by Sikh Soldiers in the World Wars|date=2018|publisher=Troubador Publishing Ltd|location=Leicestershire|isbn=9781789010985|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; He placed emphasis on keeping the body healthy and excersising daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chowdhry|first1=Mohindra|title=Defence of Europe by Sikh Soldiers in the World Wars|date=2018|publisher=Troubador Publishing Ltd|location=Leicestershire|isbn=9781789010985|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henry Guthrie''' (c. 1600 – 1676) was a 17th-century Scottish [[historian]] and [[cleric]]. The son of Elizabeth Small and the Perthshire minister Henry Guthrie, he was born around 1600 in [[Coupar Angus]], a town in southern Scotland, in the modern region of [[Perth and Kinross]]. He graduated from the [[University of St Andrews]] in 1621, studied [[theology]] and later served as a tutor for the family of the [[earl of Mar]]. 

He became minister of [[Guthrie Collegiate Church|Guthrie]] in 1624, and was promoted by [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] to [[Stirling]] in 1632. He took an ambiguous role in the [[Covenanter Wars]] and the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. He was deposed from his Stirling charge in 1648, although in 1656 was readmitted to the ministry, being given [[Kilspindie]]. Despite once opposing the re-establishment of [[episcopacy]], abandoned since the [[National Covenant]] of 1638, he changed his position, and later after the episcopate of [[George Haliburton (d. 1665)|George Haliburton]], became [[Bishop of Dunkeld]], to which position he was consecrated on 24 August 1665. He held this position until his death in 1676.

'''Historical materialism''' is the [[Historical method|methodological approach]] of [[Marxist historiography]] that focuses on human [[societies]] and their development over time, claiming that they follow a number of observable tendencies. This was first articulated by [[Karl Marx]] (1818–1883) as the ''materialist conception of history''. It is principally a theory of [[history]] according to which the material conditions of a society's way of producing and reproducing the means of human existence or, in Marxist terms, the union of its [[productive forces|technological and productive capacity]] and social [[relations of production]], fundamentally determine society's organization and development.

Historical materialism{{efn|[[Edwin Robert Anderson Seligman|Edwin R.&amp;nbsp;A. Seligman]] wrote:

{{quote|This doctrine is often called "historical materialism," or the "materialistic interpretation of history." Such terms are, however, lacking in precision. If by materialism is meant the tracing of all changes to material causes, the biological view of history is also materialistic. Again, the theory which ascribes all changes in society to the influence of climate or to the character of the fauna and flora is materialistic, and yet has little in common with the doctrine here discussed. The doctrine we have to deal with is not only materialistic, but also economic in character; and the better phrase is not the "materialistic interpretation," but the "economic interpretation" of history.{{sfn|Seligman|1901|p=613}}}}}} looks for the causes of developments and changes in human society in the means by which humans collectively produce the necessities of life. It posits that social classes and the relationship between them, along with the political structures and ways of thinking in society, are founded on and reflect contemporary economic activity.{{sfn|Fromm|1961}}

Since Marx's time, the theory has been modified and expanded by Marxist writers. It now has many Marxist and non-Marxist variants. Marxists contest that historical materialism is a [[scientific]] approach to the study of history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Woods |first=Alan |year=2016 |title=What Is Historical Materialism? |url=http://www.marxist.com/an-introduction-to-historical-materialism.htm |website=In Defence of Marxism |publisher=International Marxist Tendency |access-date=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and development ==
While Marx never used the words "historical materialism" to describe his theory of history, it nevertheless first appears in [[Friedrich Engels]]' 1880 work ''[[Socialism: Utopian and Scientific]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://marxists.catbull.com/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch03.htm |title= Socialism: Utopian and Scientific |author= Friedrich Engels |website=marxists.org |publisher=Marxists Internet Archive |access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; to which Marx wrote an introduction for the French edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://marxists.catbull.com/archive/marx/works/1880/05/04.htm |title=Introduction to the French Edition of Engels' ''Socialism: Utopian and Scientific'' |author=Karl Marx |website=marxists.org |publisher= Marxists Internet Archive| access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1892, Friedrich Engels indicated that he accepted the broader usage of the term "historical materialism," writing in an introduction to ''Socialism: Utopian and Scientific;'' 

{{quotation|I am perfectly aware that the contents of this work will meet with objection from a considerable portion of the British public. But, if we Continentals had taken the slightest notice of the prejudices of British "respectability", we should be even worse off than we are. This book defends what we call "historical materialism", and the word materialism grates upon the ears of the immense majority of British readers... I hope even British respectability will not be overshocked if I use, in English as well as in so many other languages, the term "historical materialism", to designate that view of the course of history which seeks the ultimate cause and the great moving power of all important historic events in the economic development of society, in the changes in the modes of production and exchange, in the consequent division of society into distinct classes, and in the struggles of these classes against one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Frederick Engels |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/int-mat.htm |title=Socialism: Utopian and Scientific (Introduction - Materialism) |publisher=Marxists Internet Archive |access-date=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Marx's initial interest in materialism is evident in [[The Difference Between the Democritean and Epicurean Philosophy of Nature|his doctoral thesis]], which compared the philosophical [[atomism]] of [[Democritus]] with the [[materialism|materialist]] philosophy of [[Epicurus]]&lt;ref name="Karl Marx (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/marx/ |title=Karl Marx (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=The Metaphysics Research Lab, Center for the Study of Language and Information (CSLI), Stanford University |access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Foster|1999}}, as well as his close reading of [[Adam Smith]] and other writers in classical [[political economy]].

[[File:MaxStirner2.svg|thumb|150px|A caricature of [[Max Stirner]] drawn by Friedrich Engels. Stirner's 1844 work ''[[The Ego and Its Own|The Unique and its Property]]'' prompted Marx to theorize a scientific approach to the study of history, which he first laid out in ''[[The German Ideology]]'' (1845) along with a lengthy rebuttal of Stirner's work.]]

Marx and Engels first state and detail their materialist conception of history within the pages of ''[[The German Ideology]]'', written in 1845. The book, which [[Structural Marxism|structural Marxists]] such as [[Louis Althusser]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Althusser |first=Louis |title=For Marx |publisher= The Penguin Press |date=1969 |page=59 |url=http://www.marx2mao.com/Other/FM65NB.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; regard as Marx's [[Young Marx#Various breaks|first 'mature' work]], is a lengthy polemic against Marx and Engels' fellow [[Young Hegelians]] and contemporaries [[Ludwig Feuerbach]], [[Bruno Bauer]], and [[Max Stirner]]. Stirner's 1844 work ''[[The Ego and its Own|The Unique and its Property]]'' had a particularly strong impact&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/max-stirner/ |title=Max Stirner (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=The Metaphysics Research Lab, Center for the Study of Language and Information (CSLI), Stanford University |access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the worldview of Marx and Engels: Stirner's blistering critique of [[morality]] and whole-hearted embrace of [[egoism]] prompted the pair to formulate a conception of [[socialism]] along lines of [[self-interest]] rather than simple [[humanism]] alone, grounding that conception in the scientific study of history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Welsh |first=John F. |title=Max Stirner's Dialectical Egoism, A new interpretation |pages=20–23 |publisher=Lexington Books |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Perhaps Marx's clearest formulation of historical materialism resides in the preface to his 1859 book ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the social production of their existence, men inevitably enter into definite relations, which are independent of their will, namely [[relations of production]] appropriate to a given stage in the development of their material forces of production. The totality of these relations of production constitutes the economic structure of society, the real foundation, on which arises a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond definite forms of [[political consciousness|consciousness]]. The mode of production of material life conditions the general process of social, political and intellectual life. It is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence, but their social existence that determines their consciousness. At a certain stage of development, the material productive forces of society come into conflict with the existing relations of production or&amp;nbsp;– this merely expresses the same thing in legal terms&amp;nbsp;– with the property relations within the framework of which they have operated hitherto. From forms of development of the productive forces these relations turn into their fetters. Then begins an era of social revolution. The changes in the economic foundation lead sooner or later to the transformation of the whole immense superstructure. In studying such transformations it is always necessary to distinguish between the material transformation of the economic conditions of production, which can be determined with the precision of natural science, and the legal, political, religious, artistic or philosophic&amp;nbsp;– in short, [[ideological]] forms in which men become conscious of this conflict and fight it out. Just as one does not judge an [[individual]] by what he thinks about himself, so one cannot judge such a period of transformation by its consciousness, but, on the contrary, this consciousness must be explained from the contradictions of material life, from the conflict existing between the social forces of production and the relations of production.{{sfn|Marx|1977}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Continued development===

In a foreword to his essay ''Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical'' ''German Philosophy'' (1886), three years after Marx's death, Engels claimed confidently that "the Marxist world outlook has found representatives far beyond the boundaries of Germany and Europe and in all the literary languages of the world."{{sfn|Engels|1946}} Indeed, in the years after Marx and Engels' deaths, "historical materialism" was identified as a distinct philosophical doctrine and was subsequently elaborated upon and systematized by [[Orthodox Marxism|Orthodox Marxist]] and [[Marxist-Leninist]] thinkers such as [[Eduard Bernstein]], [[Karl Kautsky]], [[Georgi Plekhanov]] and [[Nikolai Bukharin]]. This occurred despite the fact that many of Marx's earlier works on historical materialism, including ''The German Ideology'', remained unpublished until the 1930's; in reality, most self-styled Marxists had not read beyond Capital Vol. 1. 

In the early years of the 20th century, historical materialism was often treated by socialist writers as interchangeable with [[dialectical materialism]], a formulation never used by Marx or Engels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/fromm/works/1961/man/ch02.htm|title=Marx's Conception of Man |author= [[Erich Fromm]] |publisher=Marxists.org|accessdate=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to many Marxists influenced by Soviet Marxism, historical materialism is a specifically [[sociology|sociological]] method, while dialectical materialism refers to the more general, abstract [[philosophy]] underlying Marx and Engels' body of work. This view is based on [[Joseph Stalin]]'s pamphlet ''[[Dialectical and Historical Materialism]]'', as well as textbooks issued by the [[Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute|Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1938/09.htm |title= Dialectical and Historical Materialism |author= [[Joseph Stalin]] |website=marxists.org |publisher= Marxists Internet Archive| access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[The formalist vs substantivist debate|substantivist]] [[ethnography|ethnographic]] approach of economic [[economic anthropology|anthropologist]] and [[economic sociology|sociologist]] [[Karl Polanyi]] bears similarities to historical materialism. Polanyi distinguishes between the ''formal'' definition of economics as the logic of rational choice between limited resources and a ''substantive'' definition of economics as the way humans make their living from their natural and social environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Polanyi, K.|title=The Great Transformation | location=New York|year=1944| pages=44–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Great Transformation (book)|The Great Transformation]]'' (1944), Polanyi asserts that both the formal and substantive definitions of economics hold true under capitalism, but that the formal definition falls short when analyzing the economic behavior of pre-industrial societies, whose behavior was more often governed by redistribution and [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=ibid. |pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Polanyi was influenced by Marx, he rejected the primacy of [[economic determinism]] in shaping the course of history, arguing that rather than being a realm unto itself, an economy is [[Embeddedness|embedded]] within its contemporary social institutions, such as the [[State (polity)|state]] in the case of the market economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hann |first=Chris |title=Economic Anthropology (The International Encyclopedia of Anthropology) |pages = 1–16|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2018 |date=2017-09-29|doi=10.1002/9781118924396.wbiea2194 |chapter = Economic Anthropology|isbn = 9780470657225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most notable recent exploration of historical materialism is [[G.&amp;nbsp;A. Cohen]]'s ''[[Karl Marx's Theory of History: A Defence]]'',{{sfn|Cohen|2000}} which inaugurated the school of [[Analytical Marxism]]. Cohen advances a sophisticated technological-determinist interpretation of Marx "in which history is, fundamentally, the growth of human productive power, and forms of society rise and fall according as they enable or impede that growth."&lt;ref&gt;G. A. Cohen, ''Karl Marx’s Theory of History'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1978), p. x.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Several scholars have argued that historical materialism ought to be revised in the light of modern scientific knowledge. [[Jürgen Habermas]] believes historical materialism "needs revision in many respects", especially because it has ignored the significance of [[communicative action]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

[[Göran Therborn]] has argued that the method of historical materialism should be applied to historical materialism as intellectual tradition, and to the history of Marxism itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Science, Class and Society: on the formation of Sociology and Historical Materialism |last= Therborn |first=Göran |publisher= London: Verso Books |date=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980s, [[Paul Hirst]] and [[Barry Hindess]] elaborated a [[structural Marxism|structural Marxist]] interpretation of historical materialism.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

[[Regulation theory]], especially in the work of [[Michel Aglietta]] draws extensively on historical materialism.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

[[Spiral dynamics]] shows similarities to historical materialism.{{how|date=October 2018}}{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Some of it is constantly being evaporated and drawn up, to return as rain. From year to year these changes may be scarcely perceptible. But one day, when the banks are thoroughly weakened and the rains long and heavy, the river floods, bursts its banks, and may take a new course.

Historical materialism builds upon the idea of historical [[progress]] that became popular in philosophy during [[the Enlightenment]], which contends that the development of human society has progressed through a series of stages, from [[hunting and gathering society|hunting and gathering]], through [[pastoralism]] and cultivation, to commercial society.{{sfn|Meek|1976}} Historical materialism rests on a foundation of metaphysical or philosophical [[materialism]], in which matter is considered primary and ideas, thought, and consciousness are secondary, i.e. consciousness and human ideas about the universe result from material conditions rather than vice versa.

Historical materialism springs from a fundamental underlying reality of human existence: that in order for human beings to survive and continue existence from generation to generation, it is necessary for them to produce and reproduce the material requirements of life.{{sfn|Seligman|1901|p=163}} Marx then extended this premise by asserting the importance of the fact that, in order to carry out production and exchange, people have to enter into very definite social relations, most fundamentally "production relations". However, production does not get carried out in the abstract, or by entering into arbitrary or random relations chosen at will. [[Human beings]] collectively work on [[nature]] but do not do the same work; there is a [[division of labour]] in which people not only do different jobs, but according to Marxist theory, some people live off the fruits of others' labour by owning the [[means of production]]. How this is accomplished depends on the type of society. Production is carried out through very definite relations between people. And, in turn, these production relations are determined by the level and character of the [[productive forces]] that are present at any given time in history. For Marx, productive forces refer to the means of production such as the tools, instruments, technology, land, raw materials, and human knowledge and abilities in terms of using these means of production.

Marx identified the production relations of society (arising on the basis of given productive forces) as the [[Base and superstructure|economic base]] of society.&lt;ref name="Karl Marx (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He also explained that on the foundation of the economic base there arise certain political institutions, laws, customs, culture, etc., and ideas, ways of thinking, morality, etc. These constituted the political/ideological [[Base and superstructure|superstructure]] of society. This superstructure not only has its origin in the economic base, but its features also ultimately correspond to the character and development of that economic base, i.e. the way people organize society is determined by the economic base and the relations that arise from its mode of production. [[G.A. Cohen]] argues in ''[[Karl Marx's Theory of History: A Defence]]'' that a society’s legal-political superstructure stabilizes or entrenches its economic structure, but in the other direction the economic relations determine the character of the superstructure, and that the economic base is primary and the superstructure secondary. It is precisely because the superstructure strongly affects the base that the base selects that superstructure. As [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] puts it, "These two directions of influence are so far from being rivals that they are actually complementary. The functional explanation requires that the secondary factor tend to have a causal effect on the primary, for this dispositional fact is the key feature of the explanation."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Taylor, “Critical Notice”, ''Canadian Journal of Philosophy'' 10 (1980), p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt; It is because the influences in the two directions are not symmetrical that it makes sense to speak of primary and secondary factors, even where one is giving a non-reductionist, "holistic" account of social interaction.

Writers who identify with historical materialism usually postulate that society has moved through a number of types or [[mode of production|modes of production]]. That is, the character of the production relations is determined by the character of the productive forces; these could be the simple tools and instruments of early human existence, or the more developed machinery and technology of present age. The main modes of production Marx identified generally include [[primitive communism]] or [[tribe|tribal society]] (a prehistoric stage), [[ancient world|ancient society]], [[feudalism]], and [[capitalism]]. In each of these social stages, people interact with nature and produce their living in different ways. Any surplus from that production is allotted in different ways. Ancient society was based on a ruling class of slave owners and a class of slaves; feudalism was based on landowners and [[serfs]]; and capitalism based on the capitalist class and the [[working class]]. In the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] the behaviour of actors in the market economy (means of production, distribution and exchange, the relations of production) plays the major role in configuring society. The capitalist class privately owns the means of production, distribution and exchange (e.g., factories, mines, shops and banks) while the working class live by exchanging their socialized [[labour (economics)|labour]] with the capitalist class for wages. 

According to Marxist theorists{{which|date 2017|date=March 2017}}, history develops in accordance with the following observations:{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}
#Social progress is driven by progress in the material, [[productive forces]] a society has at its disposal ([[technology]], [[labour (economics)|labour]], [[capital goods]], etc.)
#Humans are inevitably involved in productive relations (roughly speaking, economic relationships or institutions), which constitute our most decisive [[social relations]]. These relations progress with the development of the productive forces. They are largely determined by the [[division of labor]], which in turn tends to determine [[social class]].
#[[Relations of production]] help determine the degree and types of the development of the forces of production, also known as the [[mode of production]]. For example, capitalism tends to increase the rate at which the forces develop and stresses the [[capital accumulation|accumulation of capital]].
#Both productive forces and productive relations progress independently of mankind's strategic intentions or will.
#The [[Base and superstructure|superstructure]]—the cultural and institutional features of a society, its ideological materials—is ultimately an expression of the mode of production (which combines both the forces and relations of production) on which the society is founded.
#Every type of [[State (polity)|state]] is a powerful [[institution]] of the ruling class; the state is an instrument which one class uses to secure its rule and enforce its preferred production relations (and its [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]]) onto society.
#State power is usually only transferred from one class to another by social and political upheaval.
#When a given style of production relations no longer supports further progress in the productive forces, either further progress is strangled, or 'revolution' must occur.
#The actual historical process is not predetermined but depends on the class struggle, especially the organization and consciousness of the working class.

==Key implications in the study and understanding of history==
Many writers note that historical materialism represented a revolution in human thought, and a break from previous ways of understanding the underlying basis of change within various human societies. As Marx puts it, "a coherence arises in human history"{{sfn|Marx|Engels|1968|p=660}} because each generation inherits the productive forces developed previously and in turn further develops them before passing them on to the next generation. Further, this coherence increasingly involves more of humanity the more the productive forces develop and expand to bind people together in production and exchange.

This understanding counters the notion that human history is simply a series of accidents, either without any underlying cause or caused by supernatural beings or forces exerting their will on society. Historical materialism posits that history is made as a result of struggle between different social classes rooted in the underlying economic base. According to [[G.A. Cohen]], author of ''[[Karl Marx's Theory of History: A Defence]]'', the level of development of society’s productive forces (i.e., society’s technological powers, including tools, machinery, raw materials, and labour power) determines society’s economic structure, in the sense that it selects a structure of economic relations that tends best to facilitate further technological growth. In historical explanation, the overall primacy of the productive forces can be understood in terms of two key theses:
{{cquote|(a) The productive forces tend to develop throughout history (the Development Thesis).&lt;br /&gt;(b) The nature of the production relations of a society is explained by the level of development of its productive forces (the Primacy Thesis proper).&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;}} 
In saying that productive forces have a universal ''tendency'' to develop, Cohen’s reading of Marx is not claiming that productive forces always develop or that they never decline. Their development may be temporarily blocked, but because human beings have a rational interest in developing their capacities to control their interactions with external nature in order to satisfy their wants, the historical tendency is strongly toward further development of these capacities.

Broadly, the importance of the study of history lies in the ability of history to explain the present. [[John Bellamy Foster]] asserts that historical materialism is important in explaining history from a scientific perspective, by following the scientific method, as opposed to belief-system theories like [[creationism]] and [[intelligent design]], which do not base their beliefs on verifiable facts and hypotheses.{{sfn|Foster|Clark|2008}}

=== Alienation and freedom ===
[[Hunter-gatherer]] societies were structured so that the economic forces and the political forces were one and the same. The elements of force and relation operated together, harmoniously. In the [[feudal society]], the political forces of the kings and nobility had their relations with the economic forces of the villages through [[serfdom]]. The serfs, although not free, were tied to both forces and, thus, not completely alienated.  Capitalism, Marx argued, completely separates the economic and political forces, leaving them to have relations through a limiting [[government]]. He takes the state to be a sign of this separation—it exists to manage the massive conflicts of interest which arise between classes in all those societies based on property relations.

=== Nations as a product of capitalism ===
According to historical materialism, nations arose at the time of the appearance of capitalism on the basis of community of economic life, territory, language, certain features of psychology, traditions of everyday life and culture. In the [[Manifesto of the Communist Party]] Marx and Engels explained that the coming into existence of nations was the result of class struggle, specifically of the capitalist class's attempts to overthrow the institutions of the former ruling class. Prior to capitalism, nations did not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dixon |first=Norm |title=Marx, Engels and Lenin on the National Question |url=http://links.org.au/node/164 |website=Links International Journal of Socialist Renewal |access-date=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Marxist theory of the national question was developed further and concretized by Lenin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=В.И. Ленин. О национальном вопросе и национальной политике |url=http://leninism.su/works/115-conspect/4248-v-i-lenin-o-natsionalnom-voprose-i-natsionalnoj-politike.html?showall= |language=ru |access-date=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, there are two opposite tendencies in the development of nations under capitalism. One of them is expressed in the activization of national life and national movements against the oppressors. The other is expressed in the expansion of links among nations, the breaking down of barriers between them, the establishment of a unified economy and of a world market.{{sfn|Lenin|n.d.}}

===Determinist presumption towards a socialist future===
In his analysis of the movement of history, Marx predicted the breakdown of capitalism, and the establishment in time of a communist society in which class-based human conflict would be overcome. {{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} The means of production would be held in the common ownership and used for the common good. In the mention of "human liberation" one should not neglect that, in the level of production, the working class is the most oppressed.  {{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} But either way, in the prediction of the future, one shall first know of the past (e.g.,  the establishment of capitalism, and the transitional part of feudalism).

==Warnings against misuse==
{{See also|Economic determinism}}Marx himself took care to indicate that he was only proposing a guideline to historical research (''Leitfaden'' or ''Auffassung''), and was not providing any substantive "theory of history" or "grand philosophy of history", let alone a "master-key to history". Engels expressed irritation with dilettante academics who sought to knock up their skimpy historical knowledge as quickly as possible into some grand theoretical system that would explain "everything" about history. He opined that historical materialism and the theory of modes of production was being used as an excuse for not studying history.&lt;ref&gt;Engels, cited approvingly by [[E. P. Thompson]] in '[https://www.marxists.org/archive/thompson-ep/1965/english.htm The peculiarities of the English],' ''Socialist Register'', 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1872 Preface to the French edition of ''[[Das Kapital]]'' Vol. 1, Marx also emphasized that "There is no royal road to science, and only those who do not dread the fatiguing climb of its steep paths have a chance of gaining its luminous summits". Reaching a scientific understanding was hard work. Conscientious, painstaking research was required, instead of philosophical speculation and unwarranted, sweeping generalizations.

But having abandoned abstract philosophical speculation in his youth, Marx himself showed great reluctance during the rest of his life about offering any generalities or universal truths about human existence or human history. The first explicit and systematic summary of the materialist interpretation of history published, ''[[Anti-Dühring]]'', was written by Friedrich Engels.

One of the aims of Engels's polemic ''Herr Eugen Dühring's Revolution in Science'' (written with Marx's approval) was to ridicule the easy "world schematism" of philosophers, who invented the latest wisdom from behind their writing desks. Towards the end of his life, in 1877, Marx wrote a letter to the editor of the Russian paper ''Otetchestvennye Zapisky'', which significantly contained the following disclaimer:

If Russia is tending to become a capitalist nation after the example of the Western European countries, and during the last years she has been taking a lot of trouble in this direction—she will not succeed without having first transformed a good part of her peasants into proletarians; and after that, once taken to the bosom of the capitalist regime, she will experience its pitiless laws like other profane peoples. That is all. But that is not enough for my critic. He feels himself obliged to metamorphose my historical sketch of the genesis of capitalism in Western Europe into an historico-philosophic theory of the marche generale imposed by fate upon every people, whatever the historic circumstances in which it finds itself, in order that it may ultimately arrive at the form of economy which will ensure, together with the greatest expansion of the productive powers of social labor, the most complete development of man. But I beg his pardon. (He is both honouring and shaming me too much.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1877/11/russia.htm |title=Letter from Marx to Editor of the Otecestvenniye Zapisky |publisher=Marxists Internet Archive |access-date=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Marx goes on to illustrate how the same factors can in different historical contexts produce very different results, so that quick and easy generalizations are not really possible. To indicate how seriously Marx took research, when he died, his estate contained several cubic metres of Russian statistical publications (it was, as the old Marx observed, in Russia that his ideas gained most influence).

But what is true is that insofar as Marx and Engels regarded historical processes as [[law]]-governed processes, the possible future directions of historical development were to a great extent ''limited'' and ''conditioned'' by what happened before. Retrospectively, historical processes could be understood to have happened by ''necessity'' in certain ways and not others, and to some extent at least, the most likely variants of the future could be specified on the basis of careful study of the known facts.

Towards the end of his life, Engels commented several times about the abuse of historical materialism.

In a letter to Conrad Schmidt dated 5 August 1890, he stated:

{{Quotation|And if this man (i.e., Paul Barth) has not yet discovered that while the material mode of existence is the ''primum agens''  this does not preclude the ideological spheres from reacting upon it in their turn, though with a secondary effect, he cannot possibly have understood the subject he is writing about. (...) The materialist conception of history has a lot of [dangerous friends] nowadays, to whom it serves as an excuse for not studying history. Just as Marx used to say, commenting on the French "Marxists" of the late 70s: "All I know is that I am not a Marxist." (...) In general, the word "materialistic" serves many of the younger writers in Germany as a mere phrase with which anything and everything is labeled without further study, that is, they stick on this label and then consider the question disposed of. But our conception of history is above all a guide to study, not a lever for construction after the manner of the Hegelian. All history must be studied afresh, the conditions of existence of the different formations of society must be examined individually before the attempt is made to deduce them from the political, civil law, aesthetic, philosophic, religious, etc., views corresponding to them. Up to now but little has been done here because only a few people have got down to it seriously. In this field we can utilize heaps of help, it is immensely big, anyone who will work seriously can achieve much and distinguish himself. But instead of this too many of the younger Germans simply make use of the phrase historical materialism (and everything can be turned into a phrase) only in order to get their own relatively scanty historical knowledge&amp;nbsp;– for economic history is still in its swaddling clothes!&amp;nbsp;– constructed into a neat system as quickly as possible, and they then deem themselves something very tremendous. And after that a Barth can come along and attack the thing itself, which in his circle has indeed been degraded to a mere phrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1890/letters/90_08_05.htm |title=Letters: Marx–Engels Correspondence 1890 |publisher=Marxists Internet Archive |access-date=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Finally, in a letter to Franz Mehring dated 14 July 1893, Engels stated:

{{Quotation|... there is only one other point lacking, which, however, Marx and I always failed to stress enough in our writings and in regard to which we are all equally guilty. That is to say, we all laid, and were bound to lay, the main emphasis, in the first place, on the derivation of political, juridical and other ideological notions, and of actions arising through the medium of these notions, from basic economic facts. But in so doing we neglected the formal side&amp;nbsp;– the ways and means by which these notions, etc., come about&amp;nbsp;– for the sake of the content. This has given our adversaries a welcome opportunity for misunderstandings, of which Paul Barth is a striking example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1893/letters/93_07_14.htm |title=Letters: Marx–Engels Correspondence 1893 |publisher=Marxists Internet Archive |access-date=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Criticisms ==
Philosopher of science [[Karl Popper]], in ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'' and ''Conjectures and Refutations'', critiqued such claims of the explanatory power or valid application of historical materialism by arguing that it could explain or explain away any fact brought before it, making it [[falsifiability#Historicism|unfalsifiable]] and thus [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]]. Similar arguments were brought by [[Leszek Kołakowski]] in ''[[Main Currents of Marxism]].''{{sfnm |1a1=Kołakowski |1y=1978 |2a1=Popper |2y=1957}}

In his 1940 essay ''[[Theses on the Philosophy of History]]'', scholar [[Walter Benjamin]] compares historical materialism to [[the Turk]], an 18th-century device which was promoted as a mechanized automaton which could defeat skilled chess players but actually concealed a human who controlled the machine. Benjamin suggested that, despite Marx's claims to scientific objectivity, historical materialism was actually quasi-religious. Like the Turk, wrote Benjamin, "[t]he puppet called 'historical materialism' is always supposed to win. It can do this with no further ado against any opponent, so long as it employs the services of [[theology]], which as everyone knows is small and ugly and must be kept out of sight." Benjamin's friend and colleague [[Gershom Scholem]] would argue that Benjamin's critique of historical materialism was so definitive that, as [[Mark Lilla]] would write, "nothing remains of historical materialism&amp;nbsp;... but the term itself".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Lilla |first=Mark |author-link=Mark Lilla |date=25 May 1995 |title=The Riddle of Walter Benjamin |magazine=The New York Review of Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Benjamin was arguing against a mechanistic form of historical materialist explanation then prevalent in Stalin's Russia, and was himself a committed, if unorthodox, Marxist. Later in "On the Concept of History", he writes:

{{quote|Class struggle, which for a historian schooled in Marx is always in evidence, is a fight for the crude and material things without which no refined and spiritual things could exist.&amp;nbsp;... There is no document of culture which is not at the same time a document of barbarism. And just as such a document is never free of barbarism, so barbarism taints the manner in which it was transmitted from one hand to another. The historical materialist therefore dissociates himself from this process of transmission as far as possible. He regards it as his task to brush history against the grain.{{sfn|Benjamin}}}}

Underlying the dispute among historians are the different assumptions made about the definition or concept of "[[history]]" and "[[historiography]]". Different historians take a different view of what it is all about, and what the possibilities of historical and social scientific knowledge are.

Evidence of the first settlement of Honolulu by the original [[Polynesia]]n migrants to the [[archipelago]] comes from oral histories and artifacts. These indicate that there was a settlement where Honolulu now stands in the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hellohonolulu.com/history.cfm |title=Honolulu History – |publisher=Hellohonolulu.com |date= |accessdate=May 22, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130104055251/http://www.hellohonolulu.com/history.cfm |archivedate=January 4, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after [[Kamehameha I]] conquered [[Oahu|O{{okina}}ahu]] in the [[Battle of Nu'uanu|Battle of Nu{{okina}}uanu]] at [[Nuuanu Pali|Nu{{okina}}uanu Pali]], he moved his royal court from the [[Hawaii (island)|Island of Hawai{{okina}}i]] to [[Waikiki|Waikīkī]] in 1804. His court relocated in 1809 to what is now [[downtown Honolulu]].  The capital was moved back to [[Kailua-Kona]] in 1812.

In 1794, Captain [[Butterworth Squadron|William Brown]] of Great Britain was the first foreigner to sail into what is now Honolulu Harbor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelgrove.com/travel-guides/United-States/Hawaii-Honolulu-History-c2089416.html |title=Honolulu History, Hawaii |publisher=Travelgrove.com |date= |accessdate=May 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; More foreign ships followed, making the port of Honolulu a focal point for merchant ships traveling between North America and Asia.

In 1845, [[Kamehameha III]] moved the permanent capital of the [[Hawaiian Kingdom]] from [[Lahaina, Hawaii|Lahaina]] on [[Maui]] to Honolulu. He and the kings that followed him transformed Honolulu into a modern capital,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0108523.html |title=About Infoplease, Part of Family Education Network |publisher=Infoplease.com |date=December 7, 1941 |accessdate=May 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; erecting buildings such as [[Cathedral Church of Saint Andrew, Honolulu|St. Andrew's Cathedral]], [[Iolani Palace|{{okina}}Iolani Palace]], and [[Aliiolani Hale|Ali{{okina}}iōlani Hale]]. At the same time, Honolulu became the center of commerce in the islands, with descendants of American missionaries establishing major businesses in downtown Honolulu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.honolulu.gov/cchnl.htm#city |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041012010232/http://www.honolulu.gov/cchnl.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 12, 2004 |title=About the City, Official Web Site for The City and County of Honolulu |publisher=.honolulu.gov |date= |accessdate=May 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the turbulent history of the late 19th century and early 20th century, such as the [[overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy]] in 1893, Hawai{{okina}}i's [[Territory of Hawaii|subsequent annexation by the United States]] in 1898, followed by a [[Chinatown, Honolulu#Great Honolulu Chinatown Fire of 1900|large fire]] in 1900, and the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in 1941, Honolulu remained the capital, largest city, and main airport and seaport of the Hawaiian Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.honolulu-city.com/honolulu-history.htm |title=Honolulu History |publisher=Honolulu-city.com |date=December 7, 1941 |accessdate=May 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An economic and tourism boom following statehood brought rapid economic growth to Honolulu and Hawai{{okina}}i. Modern air travel brings, {{As of|2007|lc=y}}, 7.6 million visitors annually to the islands, with 62.3% entering at [[Honolulu International Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://hawaii.gov/dbedt/info/visitor-stats/visitor-research/2007-annual-research.pdf | title = 2007 Annual Visitor Research Report | publisher = Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism, State of Hawaii | date =July 1, 2008|accessdate=May 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Honolulu is a modern city with numerous high-rise buildings, and Waikīkī is the center of the tourism industry in Hawai{{okina}}i, with thousands of hotel rooms.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the Urban Honolulu [[Census-designated place]] (CDP) has a total area of {{convert|177.2|km2|order=flip}}. {{convert|156.7|km2|order=flip}} of it (88.44%) is land, and {{convert|20.5|km2|order=flip}} of it (11.56%) is water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (DP-1): Urban Honolulu CDP, Hawaii| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| accessdate=May 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Honolulu is the most remote major city in the world.&lt;ref name="boehonbcn" /&gt; The closest location on the mainland to Honolulu is the [[Point Arena, California|Point Arena]] [[Lighthouse]] in [[California]], at {{convert|2045|nmi|km}}.&lt;ref&gt;Microsoft Streets and Trips 2007 Software, Copyright 2006 by Microsoft Corp. et al.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Marine vessel|Nautical vessels]] require some additional distance to [[circumnavigate]] [[Makapuʻu Point]].) However, islands off the [[Mexico|Mexican]] coast, and part of the [[Aleutian Islands]] of [[Alaska]] are slightly closer to Honolulu than the mainland.

===Climate===
Honolulu experiences a [[hot semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen classification]] ''BSh''),&lt;!--DO NOT CHANGE AWAY FROM THIS CLASSIFICATION, WHICH IS BOTH BASED ON CITATION AND CALCULATIONS FROM DATA--&gt; with a mostly dry summer season, due to a [[rain shadow]] effect.&lt;ref name = koppen&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kottek | first1 = M. | last2 = Grieser | first2 = J.

Temperatures vary little throughout the months, with average high temperatures of {{convert|80|–|90|°F|°C}} and average lows of {{convert|65|–|75|°F|°C}} throughout the year. Temperatures reach or exceed {{convert|90|°F|0}} on an average 38 days annually,&lt;ref&gt;This is comparable to Washington, D.C. despite being slightly warmer during the summer, see [http://www.nws.noaa.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=hnl].&lt;/ref&gt; with lows in the upper 50s °F (14–15&amp;nbsp;°C) occurring once or twice a year. The highest recorded temperature was {{convert|95|°F}} during a heat wave in September 1994. The highest recorded temperature in the state was also recorded later that day in [[Ni'ihau|Ni{{okina}}ihau]]. The lowest recorded temperature was {{convert|52|°F}} on February 16, 1902, and January 20, 1969. With high temperatures and humidity, there is a vast [[tropical climate|tropical]] influence on the climate, although rainfall falls short of that classification.

Annual average rainfall is {{cvt|17.05|in}}, which mainly occurs during the winter months of October through early April, with very little rainfall during the summer; similar to California's mediterranean climates. However, both seasons experience a similar number of rainy days. Light showers occur in summer, while heavier rain falls during winter. Honolulu has an average of 278 sunny days and 90 rainy days per year.

Although the city is situated in the tropics, [[hurricane]]s are quite rare. The last recorded hurricane that hit near Honolulu was Category 4 [[Hurricane Iniki]] in 1992. [[Hurricane Lane (2018)|Hurricane Lane]] is also expected to approach near the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/tcpages/?product=5day_cone_with_line_and_wind&amp;stormid=EP142018 |title=Lane Products |last=Service |first=US Department of Commerce, NOAA, National Weather |website= www.prh.noaa.gov |language=EN-US|access-date=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tornado]]es are also uncommon and usually strike once every 15 years. [[Waterspout]]s off the coast are also uncommon, hitting about once every five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weatherall.php3?s=28119&amp;refer=&amp;units=us |title=Weatherbase.com |publisher= Weatherbase.com |date= |accessdate=May 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
Honolulu's tropical climate lends itself to year-round activities. In 2004, ''[[Men's Fitness]]'' magazine named Honolulu the [[physical fitness|fittest]] city in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pacific.bizjournals.com/pacific/stories/2004/01/05/daily10.html |title=Pacific.bizjournals.com |publisher=Pacific.bizjournals.com |date=January 5, 2004 |accessdate=May 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Honolulu has three large [[road running|road races]]:
* The [[Great Aloha Run]] is held annually on [[Presidents' Day (United States)|Presidents' Day]].
* The [[Honolulu Marathon]], held annually on the second Sunday in December, draws more than 20,000 participants each year, about half to two thirds of them from Japan.
* The [[Honolulu Triathlon]] is an Olympic distance [[triathlon]] event governed by [[USA Triathlon]]. Held annually in May since 2004, there is an absence of a sprint course.

[[Ironman Hawaii|Ironman Hawai{{okina}}i]] was first held in Honolulu. It was the first ever Ironman triathlon event and is also the world championship.

Fans of spectator sports in Honolulu generally support the [[American football|football]], [[volleyball]], [[basketball]], [[rugby union]], [[rugby league]] and [[baseball]] programs of the [[University of Hawai'i at Manoa|University of Hawai{{okina}}i at Mānoa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uhm.hawaii.edu/ |title=University of Hawai'i at Manoa |publisher=Uhm.hawaii.edu |date=May 2, 2012 |accessdate=May 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; High school sporting events, especially football, are especially popular.

Honolulu has no professional sports teams.

[[Kalaeloa Airport]] is primarily a commuter facility used by unscheduled air taxis, general aviation and transient and locally based military aircraft.

===Highways===
Honolulu has been ranked as having the nation's worst traffic congestion, beating former record holder [[Los Angeles]]. Drivers waste on average over 58 hours per year on congested roadways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The Worst Traffic in America? It's not Los Angeles |publisher= Yahoo! Autos |url= http://autos.yahoo.com/news/the-worst-traffic-in-america--it-s-not-los-angeles.html |accessdate=August 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following [[freeway]]s, part of the [[Interstate Highway System]] serve Honolulu:

* [[File:I-H1.svg|30px]] [[Interstate H-1]], which, coming into the city from the west, passes [[Hickam Air Force Base]] and Honolulu International Airport, runs just north of Downtown and continues eastward through Makiki and Kaimuki, ending at Waialae/Kahala. H-1 connects to [[Interstate H-2]] from [[Wahiawa]] and [[Interstate H-3]] from [[Kaneohe, Hawaii|Kaneohe]], west of the CDP.
* [[File:I-H201.svg|30px]] [[Interstate H-201]]—also known as the Moanalua Freeway and sometimes numbered as its former number, Hawai{{okina}}i State Rte. 78—connects two points along H-1: at [[Aloha Stadium]] and [[Fort Shafter]]. Close to H-1 and Aloha Stadium, H-201 has an exchange with the western terminus of [[Interstate H-3]] to the windward side of Oahu ([[Kaneohe, Hawaii|Kaneohe]]). This complex of connecting ramps, some directly between H-1 and H-3, is in [[Halawa, Hawaii|Halawa]].

Other major highways that link Honolulu CCD with other parts of the Island of Oahu are:
* [[Pali Highway]], State Rte. 61, crosses north over the Koolau range via the Pali Tunnels to connect to [[Kailua, Honolulu County, Hawaii|Kailua]] and [[Kaneohe, Hawaii|Kaneohe]] on the windward side of the Island.
* [[Likelike Highway]], State Rte. 63, also crosses the Koolau to Kaneohe via the Wilson Tunnels.
* Kalanianaole Highway, State Rte. 72, runs eastward from Waialae/Kahala to [[Hawaii Kai, Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i Kai]] and around the east end of the island to [[Waimanalo Beach, Hawaii|Waimanalo Beach]].
* [[Kamehameha Highway]], State Rts. 80, 83, 99 and 830, runs westward from near [[Hickam Air Force Base]] to [[Aiea, Hawaii|Aiea]] and beyond, eventually running through the center of the island and ending in [[Kaneohe, Hawaii|Kaneohe]].

Like most major American cities, the Honolulu metropolitan area experiences heavy traffic congestion during rush hours, especially to and from the western suburbs of [[Kapolei]], [[ʻEwa Beach, Hawaii|{{okina}}Ewa Beach]], [[Aiea, Hawaii|Aiea]], [[Pearl City]], [[Waipahu]], and [[Mililani]].

The opening of the [[Honolulu Rail Transit]] is delayed until approximately 2018, as HART canceled the initial bids for the first nine stations and intends to rebid the work as three packages of three stations each, and allow more time for construction in the hope that increased competition on smaller contracts will drive down costs;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://m.kitv.com/news/hart-cancels-bids-for-first-9-rail-stations/27967000 |title=HART cancels bids for first 9 rail stations |newspaper=[[KITV]] |date=September 10, 2014 |accessdate=November 27, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129163425/http://m.kitv.com/news/hart-cancels-bids-for-first-9-rail-stations/27967000 |archivedate=November 29, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; initial bids ranged from $294.5 million to $320.8 million, far surpassing HART's budget of $184 million.&lt;ref&gt;honolulutransit.org [http://www.honolulutransit.org/media/280559/20140814-weekly-eblast.pdf Honolulu Transit E-Blast (PDF)] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6YE2jc5zv?url=http://www.honolulutransit.org/media/280559/20140814-weekly-eblast.pdf |date=May 2, 2015 }} August 18, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bus====
{{Main|TheBus (Honolulu)}}

Established by former Mayor [[Frank F. Fasi]] as the replacement for the Honolulu Rapid Transit Company (HRT), Honolulu's [[TheBus (Honolulu)|TheBus]] system was honored in 1994–1995 and 2000–2001 by the [[American Public Transportation Association]] as "America's Best Transit System". TheBus operates 107 routes serving Honolulu and most major cities and towns on [[O'ahu|O{{okina}}ahu]]. TheBus comprises a fleet of 531 buses, and is run by the [[non-profit corporation]] O{{okina}}ahu Transit Services in conjunction with the city Department of Transportation Services. Honolulu is ranked 4th for highest per-capita use of [[mass transit in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/pubs/other_data_products/Top_Transit_Cities.xls National Transit Database] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100720225645/http://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/pubs/other_data_products/Top_Transit_Cities.xls |date=July 20, 2010 }}, Top Transit Cities (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rail====
{{Main|Honolulu Rail Transit}}

Currently, there is no [[urban rail transit]] system in Honolulu, although electric street railways were operated in Honolulu by the now-defunct Honolulu Rapid Transit Company prior to World War II. Predecessors to the Honolulu Rapid Transit Company were the Honolulu Rapid Transit and Land Company (began 1903) and Hawaiian Tramways (began 1888).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaiihistory.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=ig.page&amp;year=1888 |title=Hawaii's History in 1888 – Hawaii History – 1888 |publisher=Hawaiihistory.org |date= |accessdate=May 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The City and County of Honolulu is currently constructing a {{convert|20|mi|km|adj=on}} rail transit line that will connect Honolulu with cities and suburban areas near [[Pearl Harbor]] and in the Leeward and West Oahu regions. The Honolulu High-Capacity Transit Corridor Project is aimed at alleviating [[traffic congestion]] for West O{{okina}}ahu commuters while being integral in the westward expansion of the metropolitan area. The project, however, has been criticized by opponents of rail for its cost, delays, and potential environmental impacts, but the line is expected to have large ridership.

====Bicycle sharing====
Since June 28, 2017, [[PBSC Urban Solutions|PBSC]] operates ''[http://gobiki.org Biki]'' which is bicycle sharing program on O{{okina}}ahu. Most ''Biki'' stations are located between Chinatown/Downtown and Diamondhead, however, some ''Biki'' stations are in Kailua.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Bikeshare Hawai'i | url = http://www.bikesharehawaii.org/ | accessdate = August 14, 2017 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170815061101/http://www.bikesharehawaii.org/ | archivedate = August 15, 2017 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = 10 new Biki stops to be installed from Downtown to Waikiki | url = http://www.kitv.com/story/36133094/10-new-biki-stops-to-be-installed-from-downtown-to-waikiki | work = [[KITV]] | date = August 14, 2017 | accessdate = August 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Zielke | first = Aydee | title = Honolulu's bike share program ready to roll in summer 2015! | url = http://www.hhf.com/2014/04/02/honolulus-bikeshare-program-ready-to-roll-in-summer-2015/ | work = HHF Planners | date = April 2, 2014 | accessdate = August 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Bikeshare Hawaii selects PBSC Urban Solutions as partner to supply bikes for Honolulu | url = https://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/news/2015/12/08/bikeshare-hawaii-selects-pbsc-urban-solutions-as.html | work = [[American City Business Journals|Pacific Business News]] | location = Honolulu | date = December 8, 2015 | accessdate = August 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GoBiki.org website has a [https://gobiki.org/map-of-biki-stops/ ''Biki'' stations map].

===Modal characteristics===
According to the 2016 American Community Survey (five-year average), 56 percent of Urban Honolulu residents commuted to work by driving alone, 13.8 percent carpooled, 11.7 used public transportation, and 8.7 percent walked. About 5.7 commuted by bike, taxi, motorcycle or other forms of transportation, while 4.1 percent worked at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Means of Transportation to Work by Age|url=https://censusreporter.org/data/table/?table=B08101&amp;geo_ids=16000US1571550&amp;primary_geo_id=16000US1571550|publisher=Census Reporter|accessdate=May 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of Honolulu has a high percentage of households without a car. In 2015, 16.6 percent of Honolulu households lacked a car, which increased slightly to 17.2 percent in 2016. The national average was 8.7 percent in 2016. Honolulu averaged 1.4 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Car Ownership in U.S. Cities Data and Map|journal=Governing|url=http://www.governing.com/gov-data/car-ownership-numbers-of-vehicles-by-city-map.html|accessdate=May 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2081">'''Joseph ibn Verga''' ([[Hebrew]]: '''יוסף אבן וירגה''') was a [[Turkish Jews|Turkish]] rabbi and [[historian]] who lived at [[Adrianople]] at the beginning of the 16th century.

He was the son of [[Solomon ibn Verga]], author of ''Shebeṭ Yehudah'' ([[Scepter of Judah]]) who emigrated from [[Spain]] to Turkey as a ''[[Marrano]]''. Joseph was a pupil of [[Joseph Fasi]], a contemporary of [[Tam ibn Yaḥya]] and of the physician [[Moses Hamon]], and belonged to the college of rabbis of Adrianople.

He completed his father's work by adding a record of some of the events of his own time and of the age immediately preceding. He knew [[Latin language|Latin]], and incorporated in the ''Shebeṭ Yehudah'' some narratives which he translated from what he calls the "Christian language". He also added a supplication ("''teḥinnah''") written by himself.

Joseph was the author of ''She'erit Yosef'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://hebrewbooks.org/11888 hebrewbooks.org], Adrianople, 1554.&lt;/ref&gt; a [[methodology]] of the [[Talmud]], giving the rules that are wanting in the ''Halikhot 'Olam'' of Yeshu'ah ha-Levi and in the ''Sefer Keritut'' of [[Samson of Chinon]]. However, Wolf (''Bibl. Hebr.'' i., No. 880) attributes this book to another Joseph ibn Verga, who lived at Avlona.

{{Economic anthropology}}
'''Karl Paul Polanyi''' ({{IPAc-en|p|oʊ|ˈ|l|æ|n|j|i}}; {{lang-hu|Polányi Károly}} {{IPA-hu|ˈpolaːɲi ˈkaːroj|}}; October 25, 1886 – April 23, 1964)&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'' (Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. 2003) vol 9. p. 554&lt;/ref&gt; was an Austro-Hungarian [[economic historian]], [[economic anthropologist]], [[economic sociology|economic sociologist]], [[political economist]], [[historical sociology|historical sociologist]] and [[social philosopher]]. He is known for his opposition to traditional economic thought and for his book, ''[[The Great Transformation (book)|The Great Transformation]]'', which argued that the emergence of market-based societies in modern Europe was not inevitable but historically contingent. Polanyi is remembered today as the originator of [[substantivism]], a cultural approach to economics, which emphasized the way economies are embedded in society and culture. This view ran counter to mainstream economics but is popular in anthropology, economic history, economic sociology and political science.

Polanyi's approach to the ancient economies has been applied to a variety of cases, such as [[Pre-Columbian America]] and ancient Mesopotamia, although its utility to the study of ancient societies in general has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Morris Silver, "Redistribution and Markets in the Economy of Ancient Mesopotamia: Updating Polanyi", [[Antiguo Oriente]] 5 (2007): 89–112.&lt;/ref&gt; Polanyi's ''The Great Transformation'' became a model for [[historical sociology]]. His theories eventually became the foundation for the [[economic democracy]] movement. His daughter, Canadian economist [[Kari Polanyi Levitt]] (born 1923 in Vienna, Austria), is Emerita Professor of Economics at [[McGill University]], Montreal.

== Early life ==
Polanyi was born into [[Polányi|a Jewish family]]. His younger brother was [[Michael Polanyi]], a philosopher, and his niece was [[Eva Zeisel]], a world-renowned ceramist.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.government-online.net/eva-zeisel-obituary/&lt;/ref&gt; He was born in [[Vienna]], at the time the capital of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. [[Mihály Polányi|Mihály Pollacsek]] father of Karl and Michael Polanyi, was a railway entrepreneur. Mihály never changed the name Pollacsek and is buried in the Jewish cemetery in Budapest. Karl and Michael Polanyi's mother was [[Cecília Wohl]]. The name change to Polanyi (not von Polanyi) was made by Karl and his siblings. Polanyi was well educated despite the ups and downs of his father's fortune, and he immersed himself in [[Budapest]]'s active intellectual and artistic scene.

Polanyi founded the radical and influential [[Galileo Circle]] while at the [[University of Budapest]], a club which would have far reaching effects on Hungarian intellectual thought. During this time, he was actively engaged with other notable thinkers, such as [[György Lukács]], [[Oszkár Jászi]], and [[Karl Mannheim]]. Polanyi graduated from Budapest University in 1912 with a doctorate in [[Law]]. In 1914, he helped found the Hungarian Radical Party and served as its secretary.

Polanyi was a [[cavalry]] officer in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] in [[World War I]], in active service at the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Russian Front]] and hospitalized in Budapest. Polanyi supported the republican government of [[Mihály Károlyi]] and its [[Social Democratic Party (Hungary)|Social Democratic]] regime. The republic was short-lived, however, and when [[Béla Kun]] toppled the Karolyi government to create the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]] Polanyi left for Vienna.

== In Vienna ==
From 1924 to 1933 he was employed as a senior editor of the prestigious ''[[Der Österreichische Volkswirt]]'' ('The Austrian Economist') magazine. It was at this time that he first began criticizing the [[Austrian School]] of economists, who he felt created abstract models which lost sight of the organic, interrelated reality of economic processes. Polanyi himself was attracted to [[Fabianism]] and the works of [[G. D. H. Cole]]. It was also during this period that Polanyi grew interested in [[Christian Socialism]].

He married the communist revolutionary [[Ilona Duczyńska]], of Polish-Hungarian background.

== In London ==
Polanyi was asked to resign from ''Der Oesterreichische Volkswirt'' because the liberal publisher of the journal could not keep on a prominent socialist after the accession of Hitler to office in January 1933 and the suspension of the Austrian parliament by the rising tide of clerical fascism in Austria. He left for London in 1933, where he earned a living as a journalist and tutor and obtained a position as a lecturer for the [[Workers' Educational Association]] in 1936. His lecture notes contained the research for what later became ''[[The Great Transformation (book)|The Great Transformation]]''. However, he would not start writing this work until 1940, when he moved to [[Vermont]] to take up a position at [[Bennington College]]. The book was published in 1944, to great acclaim. In it, Polanyi described the [[enclosure]] process in [[England]] and the creation of the contemporary economic system at the beginning of the 19th century.

== United States and Canada ==
Polanyi joined the staff of [[Bennington College]] in 1940, teaching a series of five timely lectures on the "Present Age of Transformation.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Karl Polanyi: Five Lectures on The Present Age of Transformation-Lecture Series Listing of Topics |url=http://hdl.handle.net/11209/8502 |website=Bennington College |publisher=Bennington College |accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Letter from President Robert Devore Leigh to Peter Drucker |url=http://hdl.handle.net/11209/5449 |website=Bennington College |publisher=Bennington College |accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lectures, The Passing of the 19th Century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Passing of 19th Century Civilization (Lecture #1 of 5) |url=http://hdl.handle.net/11209/5449 |website=Bennington College |publisher=Bennington College |accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trend Towards an Integrated Society,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Trend Towards an Integrated Society (Lecture #2 of 5) |url=http://hdl.handle.net/11209/8515 |website=Bennington College |publisher=Bennington College |accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Breakdown of the International System,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Breakdown of the International System (Lecture #3 of 5) |url=http://hdl.handle.net/11209/8516 |website=Bennington College |publisher=Bennington College |accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Is America an Exception &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Is America an Exception?

Polanyi participated in [[Bennington College|Bennington's]] Humanism Lecture Series  (1941) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Humanism-Lecture Series Listing of Speakers and Topics |url=http://hdl.handle.net/11209/8501 |website=Bennington College |publisher=Bennington College |accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and The [[Bennington College]] Lecture Series (1943) where his topic was "[[Jean Jacques Rousseau]]: Or is a Free Society Possible?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bennington College Lecture Series, 1943 – Lecture Series Listing of Speakers and Topics |url=http://hdl.handle.net/11209/8499 |website=Bennington College |publisher=Bennington College |accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Polanyi received a teaching position at [[Columbia University]] (1947–1953). However, his wife had a background as a former [[communism|communist]], which made gaining an entrance visa in the [[United States]] impossible. As a result, they moved to [[Canada]], and Polanyi commuted to New York City. In the early 1950s, Polanyi received a large grant from the [[Ford Foundation]] to study the economic systems of ancient empires.

Having described the emergence of the modern economic system, Polanyi now sought to understand how "the economy" emerged as a distinct sphere in the distant past. His seminar at Columbia drew several famous scholars and influenced a generation of teachers, resulting in the 1957 volume ''Trade and Markets in the Early Empires''. Polanyi continued to write in his later years and established a new journal entitled ''Coexistence''. In [[Canada]] he resided in [[Pickering, Ontario|Pickering]], [[Ontario]], where he died in 1964.

'''Laredo''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ə|ˈ|r|eɪ|d|oʊ}} {{respell|lə|RAY|doh}}; {{IPA-es|laˈɾeðo|lang}}) is the [[county seat]] of [[Webb County, Texas]], United States, on the north bank of the [[Rio Grande]] in [[South Texas]], across from [[Nuevo Laredo]], [[Tamaulipas]], [[Mexico]]. According to the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the city population was 236,091, making it the [[List of cities in Texas by population|tenth-most populous]] city in the [[U.S. state|state]] of [[Texas]] and third-most populated on the [[Mexico–United States border]], after [[San Diego, California]], and [[El Paso, Texas]].&lt;ref name="factfinder2.census.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ACSSAFFFacts?The_event=Search&amp;geo_id=&amp;_geoContext=&amp;_street=&amp;_county=Laredo&amp;_cityTown=Laredo&amp;_state=04000US48&amp;_zip=&amp;_lang=en&amp;_sse=on&amp;pctxt=fph&amp;pgsl=010|title=American FactFinder - Community Facts|first=U.S. Census|last=Bureau|website=factfinder.census.gov|accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[Laredo metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] is the [[List of United States metropolitan areas|178th-largest in the 
U.S.]] and includes all of Webb County, with a population of 250,304.&lt;ref name="factfinder2.census.gov"/&gt; Laredo is also part of the cross-border [[Laredo-Nuevo Laredo Metropolitan Area]] with an estimated population of 636,516.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=&amp;men=gcis&amp;lng=en&amp;dat=32&amp;geo=-2&amp;srt=pnan&amp;col=aohdq&amp;pt=a&amp;va=x|title=World Gazetteer: America – largest cities (per geographical entity)|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001090654/http://world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=&amp;men=gcis&amp;lng=en&amp;dat=32&amp;geo=-2&amp;srt=pnan&amp;col=aohdq&amp;pt=a&amp;va=x|archivedate=2007-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Laredo is 95.6 percent [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic and Latino]], it is one of the least ethnically diverse cities in the United States. When economic diversity, household diversity, and social class diversity are considered, Laredo is rated the 19th least diverse city overall out of the 313 largest cities in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lmtonline.com/front-news/article_495333e6-17b8-11e6-8788-637895fc219c.html|title=Study says Laredo is least racially diverse city in America|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=''[[Laredo Morning Times]]''|accessdate=May 12, 2016}} {{dead link|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laredo's economy is based on international trade with Mexico. Many major transportation companies have a facility in Laredo. The city's location on the southern end of [[Interstate 35|I-35]] close to the manufacturers in northern Mexico promotes its vital role in trade between the two nations. [[Laredo International Airport]] is within the Laredo city limits, while the [[Quetzalcoatl International Airport]] is nearby in Nuevo Laredo on the Mexican side.

Laredo has the distinction of flying seven flags (the [[Flag of the Republic of the Rio Grande]], which is now the flag of the city, in addition to the [[Six flags over Texas|Six Flags of Texas]]). Founded in 1755, Laredo grew from a village to the capital of the brief [[Republic of the Rio Grande]] to the largest inland port on the [[Mexico–United States border]]. Today, it has [[International bridges in Laredo, Texas|four international bridges and one railway bridge]].

[[Texas A&amp;M International University]] and [[Laredo College]] are in Laredo.

The biggest festival, [[Washington's Birthday Celebration]], is held during the later part of January and the majority of February, attracting hundreds of thousands of tourists. The [[Jalapeño]] Festival, Border Beer Fest, Stockmen's Ball, Princess [[Pocahontas]] Pageant, Mr. South Texas Luncheon, an air show, and two major parades are all held in conjunction with the Washington's birthday events.

The European colonial settlement of Villa de San Agustin de Laredo was founded in 1755 by [[Don Tomás Sánchez]] while the area was part of the [[Nuevo Santander]] region in the Spanish colony of [[New Spain]]. Villa de San Agustin de Laredo was named after [[Laredo, Cantabria]], Spain and in honor of Saint [[Augustine of Hippo]]. In 1840, Laredo was the capital of the independent [[Republic of the Rio Grande]], set up in opposition to [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]]; it was brought back into [[Mexico]] by military force.

In 1846 during the [[Mexican–American War]], the town was occupied by the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]]. After the war, the [[Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo]] ceded the land to the United States. A referendum was taken in the town, which voted to petition the American military government in charge of the area to return the town to Mexico. When this petition was rejected, most of the population, who were Tejano and had been in the area for generations, moved across the river into Mexican territory, where they founded [[Nuevo Laredo]]. In 1849, the United States Army set up [[Fort McIntosh (Texas)|Fort McIntosh]] (originally Camp Crawford). Laredo was rechartered as a city in 1852.

Laredo is one of the oldest [[border crossing|crossing]] points along the [[Mexico–United States border]], and the nation's largest inland port of entry. In 2005, Laredo celebrated the 250th anniversary of its founding.

The origin of name of the original Spanish town of Laredo is unclear. Some scholars say the name stems from ''[[Glaretum]]'' which means "sandy, rocky place". Others state Laredo stems from a [[Basque language|Basque]] word meaning "beautiful pastures".&lt;ref&gt;[http://nuevolaredo.usconsulate.gov/nuevolaredo/Nuevo_Laredo_History.html Laredo Origin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070803193151/http://nuevolaredo.usconsulate.gov/nuevolaredo/Nuevo_Laredo_History.html |date=2007-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_tamaulipas Laredo Origin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517163702/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_tamaulipas |date=2011-05-17 }}{{Es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laredo might also stem from the [[Latin]] ''[[Laridae|Larida]]'' which means [[gull]].

In 1946, the Plaza Theater opened in downtown Laredo, but it closed in 1999, when the municipal government purchased the property from [[United Artists]]. In 2001, the Laredo City Council authorized a feasibility study to determine what use the old theater might yet have. In 2003, a consultant recommended converting the Plaza into a multi-purpose performing arts center, with dance recitals, concerts, live theater, and occasional films. In 2006, the city received an economic development grant for renovation of the Plaza. By 2008, renovations were made to the theater marquee and blade design. In 2011, a public-private partnership was attempted by two Laredo businessmen, Danny Lopez, Jr., and Victor Trevino, Jr., but that initiative never materialized.  In 2018, the city council authorized the solicitation of private entities and [[non-profit organization]]s to operate the theater. The council is also seeking input from architects for the concept and design of renovations to the structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lmtonline.com/local/article/Operator-needed-for-historic-Plaza-Theater-after-13184906.php|title=Operator needed for historic Plaza Theater after unanimous vote by the Laredo City Council|author=Julia Wallace|publisher=''Laredo Morning Times''|date=August 27, 2018|accessdate=August 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, Laredo faced a devastating Rio Grande flood, when the water reached {{convert|61.35|ft|m}}, more than {{convert|10|ft|m|2}} higher than in the previous 1932 flood, which had also caused great damage. According to Laredo historian [[Jerry D. Thompson]] of [[Texas A&amp;M International University]], the 1954 flood was "the largest in ninety-one years and the second largest according to archeological records in the last three hundred years."&lt;ref name=devastatingflood/&gt; Many were left homeless for a time because of the calamity. Former Webb County administrative Judge [[Mercurio Martinez|Mercurio Martinez, Jr.]], recalls his father surveyed the depth of the water and advised residents to evacuate. Several downtown businesses had to remove their merchandise inventory or risk losing it to the rising waters. The flood caused the relocation of the [[Holding Institute]]. The international bridge was destroyed when it was struck by the floating railroad bridge, which had been hit by the debris of another bridge in [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]] up the river. Photos of the flood by Teofilo Esquivel, Sr., are on the wall of a Danny's Restaurant on McPherson Avenue in Laredo.&lt;ref name=devastatingflood&gt;Gabriela A. Trevino, "Flood of 1954: Devastating natural disaster caused serious damage", ''Laredo Morning Times'', June 28, 2015, pp. 1, 18A&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the violent crime rate in Laredo dropped to 379 per 100,000 inhabitants, according to www.areavibes.com. The violent crime rate in Dallas was 694 per 100,000 inhabitants. In Houston it was 967 per 100,000 inhabitants.

==Geography==
[[File:Laredo-Nuevo Laredo Metropolitan Area.JPG|thumb|200px|right|[[NASA]] satellite image of Laredo and Nuevo Laredo (2007)]]

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 102.6&amp;nbsp;square miles (265.7&amp;nbsp;km²), of which, 101.1&amp;nbsp;square miles (261.8&amp;nbsp;km²) of it is land and 1.5&amp;nbsp;square miles (3.9&amp;nbsp;km²) of it (1.37%) is covered by water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boundary Map of Laredo, Texas|url=https://www.maptechnica.com/city-map/Laredo/TX/4841464|website=MapTechnica|accessdate=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Location===
Laredo is on the west end of the Rio Grande Plains, south of the Edwards Plateau, west of the Coastal Plains, and east of the Mexican Mountains. The area consists of a few hills and flat land covered with grasses, oaks, and mesquite.

===Bodies of water===
Notable geographic features are the [[Rio Grande]] and [[Chacon Creek]]'s man-made reservoir,
[[Lake Casa Blanca]], in Lake Casa Blanca International State Park. The lake is {{convert|371|acre|km2|1}} of land and {{convert|1650|acre|km2|0}} of water. The six major creeks are [[Chacon Creek]], [[San Ildefonso Creek]], [[San Ygnacio Creek]], [[Santa Isabel Creek]], [[Sombrerillito Creek]], and [[Zacate Creek]], all of which drain into the Rio Grande. Several man-made reservoirs include the [[San Ildefonso Creek Lake]] (second-largest reservoir), and the [[Sombrerillito Creek Lake]] (third-largest reservoir).

===Climate===
Laredo's climate is semiarid with hot temperatures in the summer and mild temperatures during the winter. The climate is considered to be [[hot semi-arid climate|hot semi-arid]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''BSh''). Its weather is affected by the [[Sierra Madre Oriental]] mountains to the west, the Gulf of Mexico to the east, and the [[Chihuahuan Desert]] of Northern Mexico and West Texas. Moisture from the Pacific is cut off by the Mexican mountain range.

Because of its geographic location, Laredo's weather can range from long periods of heat to sudden, violent storms in a short period of time. Laredo winters are cold by [[South Texas]] standards: with average daytime highs around {{convert|66|F|C}} and average overnight lows of {{convert|43|F|C}}, even though temperatures may easily reach {{convert|90|F|C}} even during winter when the wind comes from the south. Although snowfall is rare in Laredo, it occurred on [[Christmas]] morning 2004, February 2011 and December 8, 2017 (0.1 inches).

Laredo has an average high temperature around {{convert|101|F|C}}, and an average low around {{convert|75|F|C}} during summer, and {{convert|22|in|mm}} of rain per year. As Laredo sometimes undergoes [[drought]], a [[water conservation]] ordinance was implemented in 2003.

According to respondents' self-identification on the 2010 Census, the vast majority of Laredo's population is ethnically Hispanic (of any race), with 95.6%. Some 4.4% of the population was not Hispanic/Latino (3.4% non-Hispanic White, 0.2% non-Hispanic Black or African American, 0.6% non-Hispanic Asian, 0.1% from some other race (non-Hispanic), and 0.1% of two or more races (non-Hispanic).

In the 2005 estimate, there were 99,675 males and 108,112 females. The average household contained 3.69 occupants. The population density was 2,250.5 people per square mile (868.9/km²).

Of the 60,816 households, 56,247 or 92.5% were occupied: 33,832 were owner-occupied units and 22,415 were renter-occupied units. About 62.0% were married couples living together, 18.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 14.7% were not families. Around 12.7% of all households were made up of individuals and 5.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.69 and the average family size was 4.18.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], at a [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]], Laredo was the second-fastest growing city in the United States, after [[Las Vegas]].

A study released in 2015 by the Martin Prosperity Institute of the [[University of Toronto]] in Canada showed Laredo as the most "economically segregated" smaller [[metro area]] in the United States. The wealthy tend to congregate in enclaves and gated communities, such as Plantation, Regency, Lakeside, Winfield, and Alexander Estates. Most of the poor inhabit neighborhoods known for overall and longstanding poverty, particularly in the southern portion of the city. Mayor [[Pete Saenz]], however, said development is underway downtown and in The Heights neighborhood, once the city's most affluent residential area.

Laredo has four [[South Texas]] banking institutions: [[Falcon International Bank]], [[International Bank of Commerce]], [[BBVA Compass]], and [[Texas Community Bank]].

Laredo is the largest inland port in the United States, and [[Nuevo Laredo]] the largest in Latin America. This is due to their respective locations, served by [[Interstate Highway 35]] / [[Mexican Federal Highway 85]], the effects of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), dozens of [[Maquiladora|twin assembly plants]] on the Mexican side, and dozens of [[International trade|import export agencies]] to expedite trade. In January 2014, the Laredo customs district processed "$20 billion in two-way trade with Mexico", about half that for the entire US with Mexico for the month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Aguilar |first=Julian |date=13 March 2014 |title=In Laredo, a Quiet Symbol of Closer Ties With Mexico |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/14/us/in-laredo-a-quiet-symbol-of-closer-ties-with-mexico.html?_r=0 |newspaper=new York Times |access-date=5 June 2015 |quote=The South Texas city houses America's busiest inland port.

As a major player in international trade, the Laredo area benefited from passage of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], which has encouraged trade. The Laredo port of entry consists of [[International bridges in Laredo, Texas|four international bridges]] (with a proposed fifth one) crossing the Rio Grande into the Mexican states of [[Tamaulipas]] and [[Nuevo León]].

===Labor market information===
As of October 2007, Laredo's labor market was in the following industries by percentage of number employed: Trade, Transportation, and Utilities (32%), Information (1%), Financial Activity (5%), Professional and Business Services (6%), Education and Health Services (15%), Leisure and Hospitality (10%), Government (23%), Mining and Construction (5%), Manufacturing (2%), and Other Services (2%).

Laredo has increased the number of non-agricultural jobs from 55,100 in January 1996 to 86,600 in October 2007. Laredo has had a higher job growth rate (2%-6.5%) than the state as a whole because of expanded international trade through the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]]. In 2007, Laredo experienced a job growth rate of 2.5%. As of October 2007, the Laredo unemployment rate was 4.1% or 3,700 unemployed persons, as compared to 3.9% in Texas statewide. This is a significant drop since the mid-1990s, when Laredo's unemployment was over 15%.

Laredo has had positive job market growth since the mid-1990s; setbacks in the mining (oil/gas) industry shifted a few thousand workers to other industries such as international trade and construction. Many large employers in the oil and gas industries shut down operations in Laredo and across Texas, and shifted to foreign countries. The same effect occurred in the garment industry (Levis and Haggar) along the Texas border area. Laredo lost its only garment-producing company (Barry), costing the jobs of about 300 workers. Laredo's strong job growth rate in retail and transportation services limited the adverse effects of long-term unemployment from the few massive layoffs of the late 1990s. Laredo's success with international trade is also a vulnerability; it depends on changes to Mexico's economy, that status of immigration laws (along with daily border crossings: shoppers and commercial trade), and terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southtexasworkforce.org/labor-market-information Laredo Labor Market, South Texas Workforce Commission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628201836/http://www.southtexasworkforce.org/labor-market-information |date=2008-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, according to the financial research company NerdWallet, Laredo had the worst pay for women of any city in the United States, with a large gender gap: an average annual salary of $24,700 for women, compared to nearly $35,000 for men. The gender pay gap in Laredo increased 25 percent between 2007 and 2012. Only the wealthy city of [[Frisco, Texas|Frisco]] in the [[Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex]], had a greater pay gap within Texas than did Laredo. According to census reports, Laredo has a 30 percent rate of poverty. Laredo households headed by women with children under the age of eighteen have a 51 percent poverty rate.&lt;ref&gt;Aldo Amato, "Gender: Pay gap called large, ''Laredo Morning Times'', April 1, 2014, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the [[San Jose, California]], area, the heart of the tech industry, has an average pay of $56,000, ranking first nationally.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Nelson, "Financial Research: Laredo ranked worst in pay", ''Laredo Morning Times'', February 6, 2014, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Annual celebrations===
The [[Washington's Birthday Celebration]] (WBCA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbcalaredo.org/|title=121st Washington's Birthday Celebration|website=Wbcalaredo.org|accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a month-long event that celebrates George Washington's birthday. It is the largest annual celebration of its kind in the United States, with 400,000 attendees. It was founded in 1898 by the [[Improved Order of Red Men]], local chapter Yaqui Tribe #59. The first celebration was a success, and its popularity grew rapidly; in 1923 it received its state [[charter]]. In 1924, the celebration held its first colonial pageant, which featured 13 girls from Laredo, representing the 13 original colonies. The celebration includes parades, a carnival, an air show, fireworks, live concerts, and a citywide [[prom]] during which many of Laredo's elite dress in very formal attire. The related [[Jalapeño]] Festival is one of the United States' top 10 eating festivals.

'''Jamboozie''' is held in late January in downtown Laredo as part of the Washington Birthday celebrations. Similar to New Orleans' [[Mardi Gras]], the Jamboozie is a colorful event, with many people dressed in beads, masks, and flamboyant outfits.

The month of March is observed in honor of the Mexican-American labor organizer [[Cesar Chavez]]. A march, organized by the local [[League of United Latin American Citizens]], is held downtown the last Saturday morning of March to remember Chavez for [[United Farm Workers]], which in the 1960s and 1970s organized migrant laborers to obtain improved working conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriela A.

What was once the Capitol building now showcases memorabilia from the short lived [[Republic of the Rio Grande]]. It displays pictures, books, and furniture from the 19th century Laredo area, and offers guided tours for school-age children and adults year-round. Because of this Republic, Laredo had flown seven flags instead of the traditional Six Flags over Texas.

'''The Laredo Center for the Arts'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laredoartcenter.org/|title=laredocenter4thearts|website=laredocenter4thearts|accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is in downtown Laredo. The building houses three galleries: the Goodman Gallery, the Laredo Art League Gallery and the Lilia G. Martinez Gallery. The Center for the Arts, in the former City Hall offices known as "The Mercado", displays regional artwork and provides community events for children and adults. The Laredo Little Theater provides Laredo with live stage performances. The theater also hosts comedians.

===Library===

Guerra Laredo Public Library'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laredolibrary.org/|title=Home|website=Laredolibrary.org|accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was first housed on the second floor of the City Hall, now known as the Market Hall, in 1916. In 1974, the Laredo Public Library moved to the historic Bruni Plaza in downtown Laredo. In 1993, the citizens of Laredo approved the construction of a new main library at McPherson and Calton roads, which opened on February 1, 1998. On July 22, 2016, the structure was named in honor of [[Joe A. Guerra]], a former member of the Laredo City Council known for his support for the library and a personal passion for reading. Council member Roque Vela, who first proposed the structure be named for Guerra, described the former councilman, who died in 2010, as "someone I looked up to for his unwavering commitment to public service. I am especially proud to know the library and reading were passions of Mr. Guerra."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lmtonline.com/front-news/article_de52b832-5065-11e6-8bfc-2fa436572485.html|title=Laredo Public Library renamed after former city councilman|author=Judith Rayo|publisher=''The Laredo Morning Times''|date=July 22, 2016|accessdate=July 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Laredo Public Library, which still uses the [[Dewey Decimal Classification]] system, has a {{convert|60000|sqft|m2|-3|abbr=on}}. main library and two branches.

Most of Laredo's architecture is of [[Spanish architecture|Spanish Colonial]], [[Architecture of the United States|American]], and Mexican flavor. Most of Laredo's Spanish Colonial style buildings are in downtown Laredo. More modern American architecture can be seen along [[Interstate Highway 35]] as well as in the downtown area.

Heavily [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] in church affiliation, Laredo has impressive houses of worship. The oldest congregation, now San Agustin Cathedral, on the downtown historic plaza, dates to the founding of the city in 1755. The striking building we see today was begun in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/cgc02|title=CHURCH ARCHITECTURE|first=ROBINSON, WILLARD|last=B.|date=12 June 2010|website=Tshaonline.org|accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Our Lady of Guadalupe is an imposing structure in [[Romanesque Revival]] Lombard (North Italian) style. It was designed by [[Leo M. J. Dielmann]] of San Antonio, a popular architect of Catholic buildings, and built for a Mexican-American and Hispanic congregation in the inner-city, at San Jorge Avenue and Callaghan St. Dielmann was commissioned by Church authorities to design churches for similar congregations in Houston and San Antonio. He also did the San Agustin parish school, and may have had a hand in the San Agustin church itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/drtsa/00011/drt-00011.html|title=A Guide to the Leo M. J. Dielmann Papers, Drawings, and Photographs, 1847-1961|website=Lib.utexas.edu|accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Catholic churches of note include Blessed Sacrament and Christ the King, both in the Heights neighborhood, [[St. John Neumann]] Church at Hillside Road and Springfield Avenue, San [[Martin de Porres]] at 1704 Sandman Street near the municipal water tower, and the large St. Patrick Catholic Church on Del Mar Boulevard, founded in 1970 and renovated in 2009. The Catholic [[diocese]] office, the headquarters of Bishop [[James Tamayo]], is on Corpus Christi Street north of Guadalupe Street. San Luis Rey Catholic Church at the intersection of Sanders and San Jose opened on September 16, 1951. Outside is a flowered prayer shrine. The congregation of the Church of the Redeemer, at the intersection of Main and Garcia streets downtown, observed its [[centennial]] on August 29, 2009. Its building is another work by [[Leo M.J. Dielmann]].

Both the First United Methodist Church, in 1949, and the Christ Church Episcopal, were designed by [[Henry Steinbomer]], a popular and prolific San Antonio architect who is credited with more than 100 churches and related buildings during the 1940s and 50s, from the Lower Rio Grande Valley mostly in South and West Texas, from the Sacred Heart Cathedral in San Angelo to Union Church in [[Monterrey, Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fst92|title=STEINBOMER, HENRY JOHN|first=KENDALL, DOROTHY|last=STEINBOMER|date=15 June 2010|website=Tshaonline.org|accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Laredo churches include [[Baptist]], [[Presbyterian Church of America|Presbyterian]], [[Lutheran]], [[Assembly of God]], [[Mormon]], and non-denominational congregations.

The homeless and other indigent are served downtown through [[Bethany House (Laredo, Texas)|Bethany House]], established in 1982 by Roman Catholic priest Father Charles M. McNaboe (1929–1996).

====David B. Barkley Plaza====
[[File:Tallest Flagpole in USA.jpg|thumb|David B. Barkley Plaza flag]]
A memorial honoring the forty-one Hispanic [[soldier]]s who have received the [[Medal of Honor]] was built in Laredo, Texas in 2002. The plaza was named after the only Laredo Medal of Honor recipient [[David B. Barkley]]. The David B. Barkley Plaza has a bronze statue of David B. Barkley and an American flag measuring 100&amp;nbsp;ft by 50&amp;nbsp;ft and is 308&amp;nbsp;ft tall making it the tallest flagpole in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://madmax.lmtonline.com/textarchives/070504/s1.htm Laredo Morning Times; Monument to medal holders unveiled early] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726140015/http://madmax.lmtonline.com/textarchives/070504/s1.htm |date=2011-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modernsteel.com/Uploads/Issues/July_2007/30767_flagpole_web.pdf|title=Modern Steel Construction|website=Modernsteel.com|accessdate=27 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218135326/http://modernsteel.com/Uploads/Issues/July_2007/30767_flagpole_web.pdf|archive-date=2010-12-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The memorial is at {{Coord|27|30|22|N|99|30|8|W|region:US-TX_type:landmark|name=David B.

====City of Laredo Shiloh Trail====
Relatively new to Laredoans, this mountain bike trail is approximately 4 miles of single-track dirt trails, widening occasionally to double-track. Some technical parts make this trail challenging, but not impossible for beginners who can briefly walk their bikes before getting on their way again. Thorned shrubs and cacti encompass bikers, so be careful! The trail is well-marked and improvements continue to be seen as the months go by. The trail is off Shiloh Road at the end of Livingston Road.

==Government==

===Municipal government===
[[File:Laredo, TX, Fire Dept. IMG 7352.JPG|thumb|Administrative headquarters of the Laredo Fire Department are on Del Mar Boulevard across from St. Patrick's Catholic Church.]]

The Laredo city government is a [[Mayor–council government#Weak-mayor form|strong city council – weak mayor system]]. The mayor presides over the eight-member city council, but he/she may only vote to break a tie. City Council elections are based on single-member districts and campaigns have no party affiliations. Municipal elections are now held in November (formerly in May) of even-numbered years. The municipal government is administered by the city manager hired by the city council. All city elected offices have a four-year term and are [[nonpartisan]] though most officials have a Democratic party preference or affiliation.

City council meetings are held on Mondays and can be viewed on the [[Public-access television]] [[cable TV]] channel or live online at [https://web.archive.org/web/20120120003255/http://pacstream1.cityoflaredo.com/live Public Access Channel live stream].

The current mayor, [[Pete Saenz]], was elected in 2014 to succeed his fellow Democrat, the term-limited [[Raul G. Salinas]]. In his bid for a second term, Salinas had in 2010 defeated then city council members Jose A. Valdez, Jr., and Gene Belmares.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.laredo.tx.us/ngovt.html City of Laredo Government] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110502014932/http://www.ci.laredo.tx.us/ngovt.html |date=2011-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Salinas also failed in a bid to unseat Webb County treasurer Delia Perales in the Democratic [[runoff election]] held on May 27, 2014.

In 2015, the city council named Jesus R. "Chuy" Olivares (born c. 1959) as the city manager to succeed the retiring Carlos Villarreal. Olivares was paid just over $249,000 annually, which included a car and telephone allowance. He was formerly the city manager of [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]] in [[Maverick County, Texas|Maverick County]].&lt;ref&gt;Kendra Ablaza, "City manager contract approved: Olivares will receive $250k plus benefits, ''Laredo Morning Times'', April 22, 2015, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; On May 15, 2017, Olivares suddenly retired as city manager when he became a target of an ongoing [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] probe into widespread public corruption in Webb County. Olivares claims thirty-eight years of municipal experience in Laredo (where was formerly the parks director), Austin, and Eagle Pass. Mayor Saenz expressed support for the decision as one of mutual convenience for Olivares and the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lmtonline.com/local/politics/article/In-fallout-from-FBI-raids-Laredo-city-manager-11149155.php|title=In fallout from FBI raids, Laredo city manager announces retirement|author=Julia Wallace|publisher=''Laredo Morning Times''|date=May 16, 2017|accessdate=May 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The council then named the assistant city manager, Horacio De Leon, as the acting city manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lmtonline.com/local/politics/article/Mayor-happy-with-outcome-11151708.php|title=Laredo mayor calls city manager's retirement 'convenient for both sides'|publisher=''Laredo Morning Times''|author=Julia Wallace|date=May 2017|accessdate=May 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

City council members receive a monthly gross salary of $1,000 plus $750 monthly for maintaining a home office, $150 per month for a city [[cell phone]], and $750 monthly for fuel expenses. The annual total compensation is hence $31,800.&lt;ref&gt;''Laredo Morning Times'', August 1, 2013, p. 4A&lt;/ref&gt; However, total annual compensation will increase to $50,000. The mayor receives about $61,200; that will rise to $75,000 a year beginning with the 2018 election. Since council terms are staggered, those increases begin with each forthcoming election cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lmtonline.com/front-news/article_a913ff24-fae2-11e5-9684-dfc2d23a8d1e.html|title=Compensation for Laredo City Council members, mayor to increase|date=April 4, 2016|author=Gabriela A. Trevino|publisher=''Laredo Morning Times''|accessdate=April 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 1, 2014, then city councilman Jorge A. Vera was arrested on a [[felony]] drug possession charge. He was accused of having earlier in the week offered [[cocaine]] to an off-duty agent of the [[United States Border Patrol]] and her friends outside a Laredo restaurant. First elected to the council in 2012, Vera faced a state jail felony (possession of a controlled substance) and a Class B [[misdemeanor]] (filing a false report).&lt;ref&gt;Aldo Amato and Cesar G. Rodriguez, "Councilman Vera busted: Faces felony drug possession charges", ''Laredo Morning Times'', August 2, 2014, pp. 1, 9A&lt;/ref&gt; Vera was subsequently [[Indictment|indicted]] on both charges by a [[grand jury]] of the Texas 406th Judicial District Court. His [[arraignment]] was in the 49th District Court. Because Vera did not resign from the city council, a [[recall election]] was held on November 4, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Aldo Amato, "Jury Indicts Vera: Drug possession, filing false report". ''Laredo Morning Times'', August 22, 2014, pp. 1, 11A&lt;/ref&gt; By a wide margin, voters in District VII supported Vera's recall. Attorney George Altgelt won the [[special election]] to succeed Vera.

In March 2017, Ray Garner resigned after four years as the chief of the Laredo Police Department. He instead returns to his former position as police chief of the United Independent School District. Then city manager Jesus Olivares appointed Captain Gabriel E. Martinez, Jr., a 30-year veteran of the department, as the acting police chief to succeed Garner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=

Laredo College is a two-campus institution which offers two-year [[Associate Degree|Associate's]] degrees. The main campus is at the western end of downtown Laredo near the [[Rio Grande]], on the site of the former Fort McIntosh. This fort played a major role in the development of Laredo, as it protected the community from Indian raids in its early history. Several of the old buildings at the fort were converted into classrooms, but after renovation programs nearly all of the campus structures are now modern. The smaller, newer second campus, [[Laredo College South Campus]], is in south Laredo along [[U. S. Route 83]].

===Television===
According to [[Nielsen Media Research]], the Laredo region (which includes [[Webb County, Texas|Webb]] and [[Zapata County, Texas|Zapata]] counties) is ranked 185th market by population size in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nielsen.com/content/dam/corporate/us/en/public%20factsheets/tv/nielsen-2012-local-DMA-TV-penetration.pdf|title=Nielson: Local Television Market Universe Estimates|website=Nielsen.com|accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first station to broadcast in Laredo was [[KGNS-TV|KGNS]] in 1956, followed by [[KVTV]] in 1973, then KJTB (now [[KLDO-TV|KLDO]]) in 1985.

Notably [[television network]]s missing from Laredo's airwaves are [[PBS]] and [[The CW]]. Laredo once had a full-power local The CW affiliate, KGNS-DT2, but on July 3, 2014 the affiliation switched to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. Prior to that KJTB channel 27, from January 1985 to October 1988 was Laredo's ABC affiliate. KJTB was later bought by [[Entravision]] and affiliated the station to [[Telemundo]] and changed its callsign to [[KLDO-TV|KLDO]]. Today KLDO is affiliated to [[Univision]]. Before KJTB, [[KGNS-TV|KGNS]], an [[NBC]] affiliate had a secondary affiliation to ABC from its founding in 1956 through KJTB's founding in 1985. On November 6, 2013, KGNS reached an agreement to add the ABC affiliation. The ABC affiliate was to have been launched in February 2014 on KGNS's subchannel 8.2. But it was not until July 2014 when KGNS dropped The CW programming and added ABC programming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/71776/gray-to-air-abc-on-kgns-subchannel Gray to Air ABC on KGNS Subchannel] ''TVNewsCheck'', November 6, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, all Nuevo Laredo stations must turn off [[analog television]] broadcasting and broadcast only [[Digital television|digitally]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tdt.mx/tdt/cuando-me-toca/?localidad=NUEVO+LAREDO%2C+NUEVO+LAREDO%2C+TAMAULIPAS&amp;id-localidad=246454&amp;x=6&amp;y=16 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314003732/http://www.tdt.mx/tdt/cuando-me-toca/?localidad=NUEVO+LAREDO%2C+NUEVO+LAREDO%2C+TAMAULIPAS&amp;id-localidad=246454&amp;x=6&amp;y=16 |archivedate=2014-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health care===
[[File:Laredo Medical Center.JPG|thumb|Laredo Medical Center, formerly Mercy Hospital, is the largest hospital in Laredo.]]

[[File:Laredo, TX, Specialty Hospital IMG 6119.JPG|thumb|Laredo Specialty Hospital, near the Laredo Medical Center, handles certain patients requiring long-term care.]]

In addition to the [[University of Texas Health Science Center]] branch, there are five other principal medical centers in Laredo: the [[Laredo Medical Center]], Doctor's Hospital, Gateway Community Health Center, Providence Surgical &amp; Medical Center, and the Laredo Specialty Hospital.

Doctors Hospital&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.doctorshosplaredo.com/p1.html Doctor's Hospital Of Laredo Homepage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928044510/https://www.doctorshosplaredo.com/p1.html |date=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is Laredo's second-largest medical center. The hospital complex is over {{convert|250000|sqft|m2|-3}}, with 180 licensed beds on a {{convert|58|acre|m2|adj=on}} campus. Affiliated with [[Universal Health Services]], it is on [[Texas State Highway Loop 20|Loop 20]] in north Laredo. The Doctors Regional Cancer Treatment Center offers comprehensive cancer services.

The Providence Surgical &amp; Medical Center&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uhsinc.com/hospitals.php?type=ambulatory Providence Surgical &amp; Medical Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206103743/http://www.uhsinc.com/hospitals.php?type=ambulatory |date=2012-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is an ambulatory health care center in north-central Laredo and also owned by Universal Health Services.

The Gateway Community Health Center&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gatewaychc.com/index.html Gateway Community Health Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150617102311/http://www.gatewaychc.com/index.html |date=2015-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the third-largest medical center in Laredo. The health center's main building is {{convert|64000|sqft|m2|-2}}. The Medical center moved to its new $11,000,000 building in 2006. The main Gateway Community Health Center is in East Laredo, close to [[U.S. Highway 59 (Texas)|U.S. Highway 59]]. It also has three branches in the Laredo area: the South Clinic, El Cenizo Community Center, and Quad City Community Center.

Gateway Community Health Center services include:

The Laredo Specialty Hospital&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lsh.ernesthealth.com/|title=LSH - We are passionate, patient caregivers.|website=lsh.ernesthealth.com|accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the fourth-largest medical center in Laredo. It is owned by [[Ernest Health Inc.]] and was founded by Elmo Lopez, Jr., on May 22, 2006, and admitted its first patient within hours of operation. The grand opening took place in March 2007.

===Transportation===
In 2016, 82.3 percent of working Laredo residents commuted by driving alone, 10.2 percent carpooled, 0.9 percent used public transportation, and 1.9 percent walked. About 2 percent of working Laredo residents commuted by all other means, including taxi, bicycle, and motorcycles. About 2.6 percent worked at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Census Reporter|title=Means of Transportation to Work by Age|accessdate=May 6, 2018|url=https://censusreporter.org/data/table/?table=B08101&amp;geo_ids=16000US4841464&amp;primary_geo_id=16000US4841464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, 6.5 percent of city of Laredo households were without a car, which decreased slightly to 5.9 percent in 2016. The national average was 8.7 percent in 2016. Laredo averaged 1.85 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8 per household.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Car Ownership in U.S. Cities Data and Map|journal=Governing|url=http://www.governing.com/gov-data/car-ownership-numbers-of-vehicles-by-city-map.html|accessdate=May 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Air====

[[File:Laredo Metro Map.jpg|thumb|Map of the [[Laredo-Nuevo Laredo Metropolitan Area]]]]
[[File:Railway Bridge.jpg|thumb|Tex-Mex Railway International Bridge view from Laredo]]
Laredo is served by the [[Laredo International Airport]]. Daily flights are available to Houston ([[George Bush Intercontinental Airport]]) and to [[Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport]]. Tri-weekly flights to [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] are available. After Laredo Air Force Base closed in the mid-1970s, the federal government handed over the old air force base and property to the City of Laredo for a new municipal airport. From the mid-1970s until the mid-1990s, the airport used a small terminal for passenger airline service and several old hangars for air cargo and private aircraft. A new state-of-the art passenger terminal was built along the then newly constructed Loop 20 to accommodate larger jets and to increase passenger air travel through Laredo. Expansion of air cargo facilities, taxiways and aprons, air cargo carriers such as DHL, FedEx, UPS, BAX, and others have responded by adding commercial air cargo jet services. Laredo also has two medical [[helipad]]s, at Laredo Medical Center and Doctor's Hospital.

====Mass transit====
[[El Metro Transit|El Metro]] is the public transit system that operates in the city with 21 fixed routes and Paratransit services, with approximately 4.6 million passengers per year. El Metro works with a fleet of over 47 fixed route buses, 2 trolleys and 18 Paratransit/El Lift vans. The El Metro hub is in downtown Laredo at El Metro Transit Center. The Center also houses [[Greyhound Lines]] and provides fee-based daily parking for downtown shoppers and workers.

====Rural transit====
Rural transportation is provided by the [[Webb County]] operated "El Aguila Rural Transportation" (the Eagle) bus services. El Aguila serves fixed daily routes from rural communities ([[Bruni, Texas|Bruni]], [[El Cenizo, Texas|El Cenizo]], [[Mirando City, Texas|Mirando City]], [[Oilton, Texas|Oilton]], and [[Rio Bravo, Texas|Rio Bravo]]) to the downtown El Metro Transit Center.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8700">[[File:Piramide-de-Mayo-Buenos-Aires.jpg|thumb|[[Pirámide de Mayo]], commemorative monument at [[Plaza de Mayo]].]]
The '''May Revolution''' ({{lang-es|Revolución de Mayo}}) was a week-long series of [[revolution]]ary events that took place from May 18 to May 25, 1810, in [[Buenos Aires]]. It started the [[Argentine War of Independence]], and it is considered the birth of modern [[Argentina]].

==Commemorations==
May 25 is a patriotic date in Argentina, known as [[First Patriotic Government]], with the character of a [[public holiday|national holiday]]. The holiday is set by law 21.329 and it is immovable, meaning it is celebrated exactly on May 25 regardless of day of the week.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.hcdn.gov.ar/dependencias/dsecretaria/Periodo2004/PDF2004/TP2004/02abril2004/tp037/2051-D-04.pdf Law on general holidays and days off shift] {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bicentennial of Argentina]] was celebrated in 2010.

May 25 was designated as a patriotic date in 1813, but the [[Argentine Declaration of Independence]] provides an alternative national day. In the beginning, this added to the conflicts between Buenos Aires and the provinces during the [[Argentine Civil War]], because the date in May related to Buenos Aires and the date of July 9 related to the whole country.&lt;ref name="enie"&gt;{{cite journal
|last1= Sigal
|first1= Silvia
|year= 2010
|title= Mayo, la disputa por el sentido
|journal= Ñ
|publisher= Clarín
|issue= 343
|page= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the [[Unitarian Party|unitarian]] [[Bernardino Rivadavia]] canceled the celebration of July 9, and the [[Federales (Argentina)|federalist]] [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] re-allowed it, but without giving up celebrations in May. By 1880, with the [[federalization of Buenos Aires]], the local connotations were removed and the May Revolution was considered the birth of the nation.&lt;ref name="enie"/&gt;

The date, as well as a generic image of the [[Buenos Aires Cabildo]], are used in different variants to honor the May Revolution. Two of the most notable are the [[Avenida de Mayo]] and the [[Plaza de Mayo]] at [[Buenos Aires]], near the location of the Cabildo. The [[Pirámide de Mayo]] was erected in the Plaza a year after the revolution, and was rebuilt to its present form in 1856. "May 25" (in Spanish, "Veinticinco de Mayo") is the name of several administrative divisions, cities, public spaces, and landforms of Argentina. There are departments of this name in the provinces of Chaco, Misiones, San Juan, Rio Negro, and Buenos Aires, the latter one holding the [[Veinticinco de Mayo, Buenos Aires Province|Veinticinco de Mayo]] city. The cities of Rosario (Santa Fe), Junín (Buenos Aires), and Resistencia (Chaco) have eponymous squares. The [[King George Island (Antarctica)|King George Island]] is under sovereignty claims of Argentina, Britain, and Chile, as part of the [[Argentine Antarctica]], [[British Antarctic Territory]], and [[Chilean Antarctic Territory]], with Argentina naming it "Isla 25 de Mayo".

A commemorative Cabildo is used on coins of 25 cents, and an image of the [[Sun of May]] appears on the 5-cent coin of the current [[Argentine Peso]]. An image of the Cabildo during the Revolution appeared on the back of the 5-peso banknote of the former [[Argentine peso moneda nacional|Peso Moneda Nacional]].

==In popular culture==
{{See also|Argentina Centennial|Argentina Bicentennial}}
The May 25 anniversary is the subject of articles each year in children's magazines in Argentina, for example ''[[Billiken (magazine)|Billiken]]'', and is described in textbooks used in primary schools. These publications often omit some aspects of the historical event, as their violence and political content might be considered [[Motion picture rating system|inappropriate for minors]], such as the  arming of the population following the preparations for the second British invasion, or the class struggle between the Criollos and the Spanish peninsulares. Children's literature often portrays  the revolution as an event devoid of violence that inevitably would have happened one way or another, and the emphasis is on secondary issues such as whether or not it rained that day, or whether the use of umbrellas was widespread or limited to a minority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= [[Los mitos de la historia argentina]]

A esto se pretende reducir, conciente o inconcientemente, el proceso que marcaría a fuego nuestro futuro como Nación.}}
&lt;br/&gt;
At most, the system promotes debates such as whether or not umbrellas were required on those days of 1810, or discusses dichotomies based in the contradiction marked by the song "The Sun of the 25 comes rising" and the drawings of ''Billiken'', the ''Simulcop'' and the ''Student's Textbook'', which show a plaza clearly rainy. This is intended to reduce, intentionally or unintentionally, the process that would mark with fire our future as nation.&lt;/ref&gt; Presented as archetypal of the revolution is the presence of various workers, including a ''mazamorreros''  delivering pies among the people in the plaza on May 25. School plays or TV numbers on the national holiday would include such recreated scenes.
[[File:La revolución de mayo (Mario Gallo, 1909).ogg|thumb|right|Mute film ''[[La Revolución de Mayo (film)|La Revolución de Mayo]]''.]]

The [[Argentina Centennial]] led to the creation of many different works and representations. Chilean painter [[Pedro Subercaseaux]] created many related paintings after requests from [[Ángel Carranza]], such as ''[[Cabildo abierto del 22 de mayo de 1810]]''; [[Mariano Moreno]] writing in his desk; the [[embrace of Maipú]] between San Martín and [[Bernardo O'Higgins]]; and the first playing of the [[Argentine National Anthem]]. Such works would later become canonical images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Historias de corceles y de acero|last= Balmaceda|first= Daniel|authorlink= Daniel Balmaceda|year= 2010|publisher= Sudamericana|location= Buenos Aires|isbn= 978-950-07-3180-5|pages=121–124}}&lt;/ref&gt; The centennial led to the production of ''[[La Revolución de Mayo (film)|La Revolución de Mayo]]'', an early silent film, shot in 1909 by [[Mario Gallo (director)|Mario Gallo]]; it premiered in 1910. It was the first Argentine fiction film done with professional actors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.listal.com/video/100153579 La Revolución de Mayo (Mario Gallo, 1909)]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the songs inspired by the events of May is the "Candombe de 1810". The tango singer [[Carlos Gardel]] sang "El Sol del 25", with lyrics by [[Domingo Lombardi]] and James Rocca, and "Salve Patria", by Eugenio Cárdenas and Guillermo Barbieri. Peter Berruti, meanwhile, created "Gavota de Mayo" with folk music.

An analysis of the May revolution from the point of view of literary fiction is the 1987 novel ''La Revolución es un Sueño Eterno'' (''The Revolution is an Eternal Dream''), by [[Andrés Rivera]]. The narrative is based on the fictional diaries of [[Juan José Castelli]], who was tried for his conduct in the course of the disastrous [[First Alto Perú campaign]]. Through the fictional account of a mortally ill Castelli, Rivera criticizes the official history and the nature of the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Nelda Pilia de Assunção, Aurora Ravina, Mónica Larrañaga (1999). ''Mayo de 1810: entre la historia y la ficción discursivas''. Editorial Biblos, pp. 113–122. {{ISBN|950-786-212-9}} {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bicentennial in 2010 produced fewer related works than the centennial. Many related books were written close to it, such as ''[[1810 (book)|1810]]'', ''[[Enigmas de la historia argentina]]'', ''[[Hombres de Mayo]]'', and ''[[Historias de corceles y de acero]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[File:Tempio di Zeus Olimpo apr2005 02.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Temple of Olympian Zeus, Athens]], (174&amp;nbsp;BC-132&amp;nbsp;AD), with the [[Parthenon]] (447-432&amp;nbsp;BC) in the background]]

This '''list of ancient Greek temples'''  covers temples built by the Hellenic people from the 6th century BC until the 2nd century AD on mainland Greece and in Hellenic towns in the [[Aegean Islands]], [[Asia Minor]], [[Sicily]] and [[Italy]], wherever there were [[Greek colonies]], and the establishment of [[Greek culture]]. [[Ancient Greek architecture]] was of very regular form, the construction being "[[post and lintel]]". There are three clearly defined styles: the [[Doric Order]], found throughout Greece, Sicily and Italy; the [[Ionic Order]], from Asia Minor, with examples in Greece; and the more ornate [[Corinthian Order]], used initially only for interiors, becoming more widely used during the [[Hellenistic period]] from the 1st century BC onwards and used extensively by [[Roman architecture|Roman architects]].

Each [[ancient Greek temple]] was dedicated to a specific god within the [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] and was used in part as a storehouse for votive offerings. Unlike a [[church (building)|church]], the interior space was not used as a meeting place, but held trophies and a large cult statue of the deity.

==Terminology==
[[File:Greek temples.svg|thumb|600px|&lt;center&gt;Plans of Ancient Greek Temples&lt;br/&gt; Top: 1. ''[[distyle in antis]]'', 2. ''amphidistyle in antis'', 3. ''tholos'', 4. ''prostyle tetrastyle'', 5. ''amphiprostyle tetrastyle'',&lt;br/&gt; Bottom: 6. ''dipteral octastyle'', 7. ''peripteral hexastyle'', 8. ''pseudoperipteral hexastyle'', 9. ''pseudodipteral octastyle'' &lt;/center&gt;]]

Most ancient Greek temples were rectangular, and were approximately twice as long as they were wide, with some notable exceptions such as the enormous [[Temple of Olympian Zeus, Athens]] with a length of nearly 2 1/2 times its width. A number of surviving temple-like structures are circular, and are referred to as ''tholos''.{{r|BF1079}}

The smallest temples are less than 25 metres (approx. 75 feet) in length, or in the case of the circular ''tholos'', in diameter. The great majority of temples are between 30–60 metres (approx. 100–200 feet) in length. A small group of Doric temples, including the [[Parthenon]], are between 60–80 metres (approx. 200–260 feet) in length. The largest temples, mainly Ionic and Corinthian, but including the Doric [[Temple of the Olympian Zeus, Agrigento]], were between 90–120 metres (approx. 300–390 feet) in length.

The temple rises from a stepped base or "[[stylobate]]", which elevates the structure above the ground on which it stands. Early examples, such as the [[Temple of Zeus, Olympia]], have two steps, but the majority, like the [[Parthenon]], have three, with the exceptional example of the Temple of Apollo, Didyma, having six.{{r|BF}} The core of the building is a masonry-built "naos" within which is a [[cella]], a windowless room originally housing the statue of the god. The cella generally has a porch or "pronaos" before it, and perhaps a second chamber or "antenaos" serving as a treasury or repository for trophies and gifts. The chambers were lit by a single large doorway, fitted with a wrought iron grill. Some rooms appear to have been illuminated by skylights.&lt;ref name = BF/&gt;

On the stylobate, often completely surrounding the naos, stand rows of columns. Each temple is defined as being of a particular type, with two terms: one describing the number of columns across the entrance front, and the other defining their distribution.&lt;ref name = BF/&gt;

Examples:
*''[[Distyle in antis]]'' describes a small temple with two columns at the front, which are set between the projecting walls of the ''pronaos'' or porch, like the Temple of Nemesis at Rhamnus.&lt;small&gt;(see left, figure 1.)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name = BF/&gt;
*''Amphiprostyle tetrastyle'' describes a small temple that has columns at both ends which stand clear of the ''naos''. ''Tetrastyle'' indicates that the columns are four in number, like those of the Temple on the Ilissus in Athens.&lt;small&gt;(Figure 4.)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name = BF/&gt;

'''Note:'''
:Precise measurements are not available for all buildings. Some have foundations that are intact and have been well surveyed so that the dimensions can be stated with accuracy. For others the size can only be estimated from scant remains. In these cases, in converting, measurements are stated to the nearest whole number. Some measurements may have been made originally in feet, converted to metres for publication, and converted back to feet for this article, with slight differences from some older publication.

&lt;!--- HOW TO ADD TO THIS LIST
* The 1st set places the works in alphabetical order according to the deity’s name.
*The 2nd set places the works in order by region and town
::A. Greece
::B. Turkey
::C. Italy
::D. Sicily
*The 3rd set of {{Ntsh}} parameters gives the most pertinent date in the building's history. Dates BC are prefixed by minus, so -450 is 450 BC
*The 4th set gives size by area
* The 5th set sorts the works by style
::1. Doric
::2. Doric with elements of Ionic or Corinthian
::3. Ionic
::4. Corinthian
---&gt;
Sorting behaviour (by column #):

It had 20 columns on each side and a triple row at the porticos, 104 columns, (diameter: 1.9 metres diameter, height: 17 metres high)(6&amp;nbsp;ft 4 ins; 56&amp;nbsp;ft). Some of the columns were shipped to Rome before the temple was complete and used for the [[Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus]]  where they had a profound effect on Roman architecture. It was completed and dedicated by [[Hadrian]], more than 300 years after it began. Only 15 columns remain.{{r|BF139|B48|BF109140}}

An ambitious building of distinctive plan, having a stylobate rising in two levels and aisles of sufficient width to suggest that either a second row of columns was intended, or that the builders of Sicily, unlike their mainland Greek counterparts, used the trussed roof. The colonnaded inner porch has side, as well as front columns, so that the temple might be termed "pseudo-dipteral".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36870">'''Major explorations''' of [[Earth]] continued '''after the [[Age of Discovery]]'''. By the early seventeenth century, vessels were sufficiently well built and their navigators competent enough to travel to virtually anywhere on the planet by sea. In the 17th century Dutch explorers such as [[Willem Janszoon|Willem Jansz]] and [[Abel Tasman]] explored the coasts of [[Australia]]. Spanish expeditions from Peru explored the [[South Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]] and discovered archipelagos such as [[Vanuatu]] and the [[Pitcairn Islands]]. [[Luis Vaez de Torres]] chartered the coasts of [[New Guinea]] and the [[Solomon Islands]], and discovered the [[Torres Strait|strait]] that bears his name. European naval exploration mapped the western and northern coasts of Australia, but the east coast had to wait for over a century. Eighteenth century British explorer [[James Cook]] mapped much of [[Polynesia]] and traveled as far as [[Alaska]]. In the later 18th century the Pacific became a focus of renewed interest, with [[Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest|Spanish expeditions]], followed by Northern European ones, reaching the coasts of northern British Columbia and Alaska.

Voyages into the continents took longer. The centers of [[the Americas]] had been reached by the mid-16th century, although there were unexplored areas until the 18th and 19th centuries. [[Outback|Australia]]'s and [[Exploration of Africa|Africa]]'s deep interiors were not explored by Europeans until the mid- to late 19th and early 20th centuries, due to a lack of trade potential, and to serious problems with contagious [[tropical disease]]s in [[sub-Saharan Africa]]'s case. Finally, [[Antarctica]]'s interior [[History of Antarctica#Exploration|was explored]], with [[North Pole|North]] and [[South Pole]]s reached in the 20th century.

==James Cook's Pacific Ocean exploration (1768–1779)==
[[File:Cook Three Voyages 59.png|thumb|350px|The routes of Captain James Cook's voyages. The first voyage is shown in '''&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;''', second voyage in '''&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;green&lt;/span&gt;''', and third voyage in '''&lt;span style="color:blue;"&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt;'''. The route of Cook's crew following his death is shown as a dashed blue line.]]

British explorer [[James Cook]], who had been the first to map the North Atlantic [[Newfoundland (island)|island of Newfoundland]], spent a dozen years in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. He made great contributions to European knowledge of the area, and his more accurate [[nautical chart|navigational charting]] of large areas of the ocean was a major achievement.

Cook made three voyages to the Pacific, including the first European contact with the eastern coastline of [[Australia]] and the [[Hawaiian Islands]] (although [[oral tradition]] seems to point towards a far earlier Spanish expedition having achieved the latter), as well as the first recorded [[circumnavigation]] of [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Cook, James |volume=7 |pages=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cook was the first European to have extensive contact with various people of the Pacific. He correctly concluded there was a relationship among all the people in the Pacific, despite their being separated by thousands of miles of ocean (see [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]]). In New Zealand the coming of Cook is often used to signify the onset of colonization.&lt;ref name="collingridge"&gt;per Collingridge (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="horwitz"&gt;per Horwitz (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; He also theorised that Polynesians originated from Asia, which was later proved to be correct by scientist [[Bryan Sykes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sykes|first=Bryan|title=[[The Seven Daughters of Eve]]|publisher=Norton Publishing: New York City, NY and London, England|isbn=0-393-02018-5|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cook was accompanied by many scientists, whose observations and discoveries added to the importance of the voyages. Two botanists went on the first voyage, Englishman [[Joseph Banks]] and Swedish [[Daniel Solander]], between them collecting over 3,000 plant species. Banks became one of the strongest promoters of the settlement of Australia by the British, based on his own personal observations. Cook was also accompanied by artists. [[Sydney Parkinson]] completed 264 drawings before his death near the end of the first voyage; these were of immense scientific value to British botanists.&lt;ref name="collingridge" /&gt; Cook's second expedition included the artist [[William Hodges]], who produced notable [[Landscape art|landscape painting]]s of [[Tahiti]], [[Easter Island]], and other locations.

===Mapping and measuring===
To create accurate maps, [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] need to be known. [[Navigator]]s had been able to work out latitude accurately for centuries by measuring the angle of the sun or a star above the horizon with an instrument such as a [[backstaff]] or [[quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]]. Longitude was more difficult to measure accurately because it requires precise knowledge of the time difference between points on the [[Surface of the Earth|surface of the earth]]. Earth turns a full 360 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] relative to the sun each day. Thus longitude corresponds to time: 15 degrees every hour, or 1 degree every 4 minutes.

Cook gathered accurate longitude measurements during his first voyage with the help of astronomer [[Charles Green (astronomer)|Charles Green]] and by using the newly published [[The Nautical Almanac|Nautical Almanac]] tables, via the [[lunar distance (navigation)|lunar distance]] method — measuring the [[angular distance]] from the moon to either the sun during daytime or one of eight bright stars during night-time to determine the time at the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich]], and comparing that to his [[Time zone|local time]] determined via the altitude of the sun, moon, or stars. On his second voyage Cook used the K1 chronometer made by [[Larcum Kendall]]. It was a copy of the [[Harrison Number Four#The longitude watches|H4 clock]] made by [[John Harrison]], which proved to be the first to keep accurate time at sea when used on the ship ''Deptford's'' journey to Jamaica, 1761–1762.

== Scientific Surveys in Central America and the Pacific==

=== Alexander von Humboldt (1799–1804) ===
[[File:Map Alexander von Humboldt expedition-en.svg|400px|thumb|Alexander von Humboldt's Latin American expedition]]
Between 1799 and 1804, [[Alexander von Humboldt]] a [[German people|German]] [[natural scientist|naturalist]] and [[List of explorers|explorer]], traveled extensively in [[Latin America]], under the protection of king [[Charles IV of Spain]]. Humboldt intended to investigate how the [[List of natural phenomena|forces of nature]] interact with one another and find out about the unity of nature.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} His expedition may be regarded as having laid the foundation of the sciences of [[physical geography]] and [[meteorology]], exploring and describing for the first time in a manner generally considered to be a modern scientific point of view.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

As a consequence of his explorations, von Humboldt described many geographical features and species of life that were hitherto unknown to Europeans and his quantitative work on [[botany|botanical]] [[geography]] was foundational to the field of [[biogeography]]. By his delineation of "isothermal lines", in 1817 he devised the means of comparing the climatic conditions of various countries, and to the detection of the more complicated law governing atmospheric disturbances in higher latitudes; he discovered the decrease in intensity of Earth's [[magnetic field]] from the poles to the equator. His attentive study of the [[volcano]]es of the [[New World]], showed that they fell naturally into linear groups, presumably corresponding with vast subterranean fissures, and he demonstrated the [[igneous rock|igneous]] origin of rocks.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} He was one of the first to propose that the lands bordering the [[Atlantic Ocean]] were once joined (South America and Africa in particular). The details and findings of Humboldt’s journey were published in a set of 30 volumes over 21 years, his ''Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equatorial Regions of the New Continent''. Later, his five-volume work, ''[[Cosmos: A Sketch for a Physical Description of the Universe]]'' (1845), attempted to unify the various branches of scientific knowledge.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

=== Darwin and the second voyage of HMS Beagle (1831–1836) ===
[[Image:Voyage of the Beagle-en.svg|thumb|400px|alt=Route from Plymouth, England, south to Cape Verde then southwest across the Atlantic to Bahia, Brazil, south to Rio de Janeiro, Montevideo, the Falkland Islands, round the tip of South America then north to Valparaiso and Callao. North west to the Galapagos Islands before sailing west across the Pacific to New Zealand, Sydney, Hobart in Tasmania, and King George's Sound in Western Australia. Northwest to the Keeling Islands, southwest to Mauritius and Cape Town, then northwest to Bahia and northeast back to Plymouth.|The voyage of the ''Beagle'']]
In December 1831 a British expedition departed under captain [[Robert FitzRoy]], on board the [[second voyage of HMS Beagle|HMS ''Beagle'']], with the main purpose of making a [[hydrographic survey]] of the coasts of [[South America]] using calibrated chronometers and [[Astronomy|astronomical]] observations, producing charts for naval war or commerce. The [[longitude]] of [[Rio de Janeiro]] was to be found and also made geological survey of a circular coral [[atoll]] in the [[Pacific ocean]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

FitzRoy thought of the advantages of having an expert in [[geology]] on board, and sought a [[Gentleman scientist|gentleman]] [[natural history|naturalist]] who could be his companion. The young graduate, [[Charles Darwin]], had hoped to see the tropics before becoming a [[parson]], and took this opportunity. The ''Beagle'' sailed across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] then carried out detailed hydrographic surveys, returning via [[Tahiti]] and [[Australia]], having circumnavigated the Earth. Originally planned to last two years, the expedition lasted almost five. Darwin spent most of this time exploring on land.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|Neve|1989|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in the voyage he decided that he could write a book about geology, and he showed a gift for theorising. By the end of the expedition he had already made his name as a geologist and [[fossil]] collector, and the publication of his journal, known as [[The Voyage of the Beagle]], gave him wide renown as a writer. At [[Punta Alta]] he made a major find of gigantic fossils of extinct mammals, then known from only a very few specimens. He ably collected and made detailed observations of plants and animals, with results that shook his belief that [[species]] were fixed and provided the basis for ideas which came to him when back in England, and led to his theory of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]].

[[File:Malay Archipelago Racquet-tailed Kingfisher.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kingfisher]] as illustrated in [[The Malay Archipelago]]. Wallace collected more than 125,000 specimens, a thousand new [[species]] to science.]]

===Alfred Russel Wallace Amazon and Malay explorations (1848–1862)===
In 1848, inspired by the chronicles of earlier traveling naturalists&lt;ref&gt;Slotten ''The Heretic in Darwin's Court'' pp. 34–37.&lt;/ref&gt; British naturalist [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] and [[Henry Walter Bates|Henry Bates]] left for [[Brazil]] with the intention of collecting insects and other animal specimens in the [[Amazon rainforest]]. Wallace charted the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] for four years, collecting specimens and making notes on peoples, geography, flora, and fauna.&lt;ref&gt;Raby ''Bright Paradise'' pp. 89–95.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1852, while returning to the UK, the ship's cargo caught fire and all the specimens he had collected were lost.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Slotten87-88"&gt;Slotten pp. 87-88&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1854 to 1862, Wallace traveled again through [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] to collect specimens for sale and study nature. He collected more than 125,000 specimens, more than a thousand of them representing [[species]] new to science.&lt;ref&gt;Shermer In Darwin's Shadow pp. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; His observations of the marked differences across a narrow strait in the archipelago led to his proposing the zoogeographical boundary now known as the [[Wallace line]], that divides [[Indonesia]] into two distinct parts: one with animals closely related to those of Australia, and one in which the species are largely of Asian origin. He became an expert on [[biogeography]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Charles H.|title=Alfred Russel Wallace: Evolution of an Evolutionist Introduction|url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/chsarwin.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=2007-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating the basis for the [[ecozone|zoogeographic regions]] still in use today. While he was exploring the archipelago, he refined his thoughts about evolution and had his famous insight on [[natural selection]].

His interest resulted in his being one of the first prominent scientists to raise concerns over the environmental impact of human activity, like deforestation and [[invasive species]]. In 1878, he warned about the dangers of deforestation and soil erosion in tropical climates, like the extensive clearing of [[rainforest]] for coffee cultivation in Ceylon ([[Sri Lanka]]) and [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;Slotten pp. 352–353.&lt;/ref&gt; Accounts of his travels were published in ''[[The Malay Archipelago]]'' in 1869, one of the most popular and influential journals of scientific exploration published during the 19th century.

==Interior Africa exploration==
Africa's deep interiors were not explored by Europeans until the mid to late 19th and early 20th centuries; this being due to a lack of trade potential in this region, and to serious problems with contagious [[tropical disease]]s in sub-Saharan Africa's case.

===David Livingstone (1849–1855)===
In the mid-19th century, [[Protestantism|Protestant]] missions were carrying on active [[Missionary|missionary work]] on the Guinea coast, in [[South Africa]] and in Zanzibar. Missionaries in many instances became explorers and pioneers. [[David Livingstone]], a Scottish missionary, had been engaged since 1840 in work north of the [[Orange River]]. In 1849, Livingstone crossed the [[Kalahari Desert]] from south to north and reached [[Lake Ngami]]. Between 1851 and 1856, he traversed the continent from west to east, discovering the great waterways of the upper [[Zambezi|Zambezi River]]. In November 1855, Livingstone became the first European to see the famous [[Victoria Falls, Zambia|Victoria Falls]], named after [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|the Queen of the United Kingdom]]. From 1858 to 1864, the lower Zambezi, the [[Shire River]] and [[Lake Malawi|Lake Nyasa]] were explored by Livingstone. Nyasa had been first reached by the confidential slave of [[António da Silva Porto]], a Portuguese trader established at [[Bié Province|Bié]] in Angola, who crossed Africa during 1853–1856 from Benguella to the mouth of the Rovuma. A prime goal for explorers was to locate the source of the River Nile. Expeditions by Burton and Speke (1857–1858) and Speke and Grant (1863) located [[Lake Tanganyika]] and [[Lake Victoria]]. It was eventually proved to be the latter from which the Nile flowed.

Explorers were also active in other parts of the continent. Southern Morocco, the Sahara and the Sudan were traversed in many directions between 1860 and 1875 by [[Georg August Schweinfurth|Georg Schweinfurth]] and [[Gustav Nachtigal]].&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7312/ |title = Sahara and Sudan: The Results of Six Years Travel in Africa |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1879–1889 |accessdate = 2013-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These travellers not only added considerably to geographical knowledge, but obtained invaluable information concerning the people, languages and natural history of the countries in which they sojourned. Among the discoveries of Schweinfurth was one that confirmed Greek legends of the existence beyond Egypt of a "pygmy race". But the first western discoverer of the pygmies of [[Central Africa]] was [[Paul Du Chaillu]], who found them in the Ogowe district of the west coast in 1865, five years before Schweinfurth's first meeting with them. Du Chaillu had previously, through journeys in the Gabon region between 1855 and 1859, made popular in Europe the knowledge of the existence of the gorilla, whose existence was thought to be legendary.

[[Henry Morton Stanley]], who had in 1871 succeeded in finding and rescuing Livingstone (originating the famous line "Dr. Livingstone, I presume"), started again for Zanzibar in 1874.  In one of the most memorable of all exploring expeditions in Africa, Stanley circumnavigated Victoria Nyanza and Tanganyika. Striking farther inland to the Lualaba, he followed that river down to the Atlantic Ocean—which he reached in August 1877—and proved it to be the Congo.

===Serpa Pinto, Capelo and Ivens (1877–1886)===
Portuguese [[Alexandre de Serpa Pinto|Serpa Pinto]] was the fourth explorer to cross Africa from west to east and the first to lay down a reasonably accurate route between [[Bié Province|Bié]] (in present-day [[Angola]]) and Lealui. In 1877, [[Alexandre de Serpa Pinto|Serpa Pinto]] and Portuguese naval captains [[Hermenegildo Capelo|Capelo]] and [[Roberto Ivens|Ivens]] explored the southern African interior starting from [[Benguela]]. Capello and Ivens turning northward whilst Serpa Pinto continued eastward. He crossed the [[Cuando River|Cuando (Kwando)]] river in June 1878 and in August reached [[Lealui]], the [[Lozi people|Barotse]] capital on the Zambezi.

From 1884 to 1886 [[Hermenegildo Capelo]] and [[Roberto Ivens]] crossed [[Southern Africa]] between [[Portuguese West Africa|Angola]] and [[Portuguese East Africa|Mozambique]] to map the unknown territory of the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colonies]].  The choice of two marine officials for this achievement certainly appealed to the principles of maritime [[navigation]]. Between 1884 and 1885, Capelo and Ivens explored Africa interior, first between the coastline and [[Huíla Province|Huila]] plain and later through the interior of [[Quelimane]] in [[Mozambique]], continuing their hydrographic studies, updating registers, but also taking notes on the ethnographic and the linguistic characters they encountered. They established thus the so desired land route between the coasts of Angola and Mozambique, exploring vast regions of the interior located between these two territories. Their achievements were recorded in a two volume book titled: ''De Angola à Contra-Costa'' (''From Angola to the Other Coast'').

== Exploring the Arctic and Antarctic ==
Arctic and Antarctic seas were not explored until the 19th century.  Once the [[North Pole]] had been reached in 1909, several expeditions attempted to reach the [[South Pole]]. Many resulted in injury and death. The [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Roald Amundsen]] finally reached the Pole in December 1911, following a dramatic race with the [[English people|Englishman]] [[Robert Falcon Scott]].

===The Northwest Passage===
{{main|Northwest Passage}}
[[File:northwest passage.jpg|thumb|300px|Northwest Passage routes]]
The ''Northwest Passage'' is a sea route connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans through the [[Arctic Ocean]]. Interest kindled in 1564 after [[Jacques Cartier]]'s discovery of the mouth of the [[Saint Lawrence River]], [[Martin Frobisher]] had formed a resolution to undertake the challenge of forging a trade route from England westward to India. In 1576 - 1578, he took three trips to what is now the Canadian Arctic in order to find the passage. [[Frobisher Bay]], which he discovered, is named after him. On August 8, 1585, under the employ of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] the English explorer [[John Davis (English explorer)|John Davis]] entered [[Cumberland Sound]], [[Baffin Island]]. Davis rounded Greenland before dividing his four ships into separate expeditions to search for a passage westward. Though he was unable to pass through the icy [[Arctic]] waters, he reported to his sponsors that the passage they sought is "a matter nothing doubtfull {{sic}},"{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and secured support for two additional expeditions, reaching as far as [[Hudson Bay]]. Though England's efforts were interrupted in 1587 because of [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585)|Anglo-Spanish War]], Davis's favorable reports on the region and its people would inspire explorers in the coming century.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In the first half of the 19th century, parts of the Northwest Passage were explored separately by a number of different expeditions, including those by [[John Ross (Arctic explorer)|John Ross]], [[William Edward Parry]], [[James Clark Ross]]; and overland expeditions led by [[John Franklin]], [[George Back]], [[Peter Warren Dease]], [[Thomas Simpson (explorer)|Thomas Simpson]], and [[John Rae (explorer)|John Rae]].  Sir [[Robert McClure]] was credited with the discovery of the Northwest Passage by sea in 1851&lt;ref name="arcticchronology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quarkexpeditions.com/arctic/exploration.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120062816/http://www.quarkexpeditions.com/arctic/exploration.shtml |archivedate=2008-11-20 |title=ARCTIC EXPLORATION - CHRONOLOGY|accessdate=2006-10-19|publisher=Quark Expeditions|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he looked across [[McClure Strait]] from [[Banks Island]] and viewed [[Melville Island (Northwest Territories and Nunavut)|Melville Island]]. However, the strait was blocked by young ice at this point in the season, and not navigable to ships.&lt;ref&gt;Burton, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; The only usable route, linking the entrances of [[Lancaster Sound]] and [[Dolphin and Union Strait]] was first used by John Rae in 1851. Rae used a pragmatic approach of traveling by land on foot and dogsled, and typically employed less than ten people in his exploration parties.&lt;ref name="dictbio"&gt;{{cite web |last=Richards |first=R. L. |url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=6386|title=John Rae|accessdate=2006-10-20|publisher=Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Northwest Passage was not completely conquered by sea until 1906, when the Norwegian explorer [[Roald Amundsen]], who had sailed just in time to escape creditors seeking to stop the expedition, completed a three-year voyage in the converted 47-ton herring boat ''[[Gjøa]]''. At the end of this trip, he walked into the city of [[Eagle, Alaska]], and sent a telegram announcing his success. His route was not commercially practical; in addition to the time taken, some of the waterways were extremely shallow.&lt;ref name="caencyclo2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/northwest-passage/ |title=Northwest Passage |accessdate=2006-10-20 |publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia |year=2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102171805/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0005816 |archivedate=2007-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Northwest Passage, however, had been navigable in earlier centuries, too. The native peoples could navigate their kayaks through the canals, which would not have penetrable by large sail ships.&lt;ref&gt;CITATION: Dr. Aron Crowell. “Imagining Alaska in North Pacific America:  Native Peoples and their Material Culture” Oral Presentation in Imagining Anchorage Conference, Anchorage Alaska 18–20 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The North Pole (1909–1952)====
[[File:Peary_Sledge_Party_and_Flags_at_the_Pole.jpg|thumb|left|128px|[[Robert Peary]] and sledge party with flags at North Pole.  Peary has been claimed to be the first person to reach the north pole.]] 
 
While the South Pole lies on a continental [[antarctica|land mass]], the North Pole is located in the middle of the [[Arctic Ocean]] amidst waters that are almost permanently covered with constantly shifting sea ice.

A number of expeditions set out with the intention of reaching the North Pole but did not succeed; that of British naval officer [[William Edward Parry]], in 1827, the American [[Polaris expedition]] in 1871, and Norwegian [[Fridtjof Nansen]] in 1895. American [[Frederick Cook|Frederick Albert Cook]] claimed to have reached the North Pole in 1908, but this has not been widely accepted.&lt;ref&gt;See references on [[Frederick Cook]] for more information.&lt;/ref&gt;

The conquest of the North Pole was for many years credited to American Navy engineer [[Robert Peary]], who claimed to have reached the Pole on April 6, 1909,&lt;ref name="arcticchronology" /&gt; accompanied by American [[Matthew Henson]] and four [[Inuit]] men named Ootah, Seeglo, Egingwah, and Ooqueah. However, Peary's claim remains controversial.&lt;ref name="columbia"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/library/encyclopedia/arctic_the.jsp|title=ARCTIC, THE|accessdate=2006-10-19|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2004|work=Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="caencyclo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/north-pole/|title=North Pole|accessdate=2006-10-20|publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party that accompanied Peary on the final stage of the journey included no one who was trained in navigation and could independently confirm his own navigational work, which some claim to have been particularly sloppy as he approached the Pole. He traveled with the aid of dogsleds and three separate support crews who turned back at successive intervals before reaching the Pole. Many modern explorers, contend that Peary could not have reached the pole on foot in the time he claimed.

The first undisputed sighting of the Pole was on May 12, 1926 by [[Norway|Norwegian]] explorer [[Roald Amundsen]] and his [[United States|American]] sponsor [[Lincoln Ellsworth]] from the [[airship]] ''[[Norge (airship)|Norge]]''. ''Norge'', though Norwegian owned, was designed and piloted by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Umberto Nobile]]. The flight  started from [[Svalbard]] and crossed the icecap to [[Alaska]]. Nobile, along with several scientists and crew from the ''Norge'', overflew the Pole a second time on May 24, 1928 in the airship ''[[Airship Italia|Italia]]''.  The ''Italia'' crashed on its return from the Pole, with the loss of half the crew.

[[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Joseph O. Fletcher]] and Lieutenant [[William Pershing Benedict|William P. Benedict]] finally landed a plane at the Pole on May 3, 1952, accompanied by the scientist [[Albert P. Crary]].

=== Antarctica exploration ===
{{Main|Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration|Farthest South}}
[[File:Expeditions in Antarctica before 1897.png|thumb|250px|Expeditions in Antarctica before the [[Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration]], 1897]]

Early Western theories believed that in the far south of the globe existed a vast continent, known as [[Terra Australis]]. The rounding of the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and [[Cape Horn]] in the 15th and 16th centuries proved that ''Terra Australis Incognita'' ("Unknown Southern Land"), if it existed, was a continent in its own right. The basic geography of the Antarctic coastline was not understood until the mid-to-late 19th century.

It may safely be said that all the navigators who fell in with the southern ice up to 1750 did so by being driven off their course and not of set purpose. An exception may perhaps be made in favor of [[Edmond Halley]]'s voyage in [[HMS Paramour|HMS ''Paramour'']] for magnetic investigations in the South Atlantic when he met the ice in [[52nd parallel south|52°&amp;nbsp;S]] in January 1700, but that latitude was his farthest south. A determined effort on the part of the French naval officer [[Pierre François Étienne Bouvet de Maisonneuve|Pierre Bouvet]] to discover the South Land described by a half legendary [[Binot Paulmier de Gonneville|sieur de Gonneyville]] resulted only in the discovery of [[Bouvet Island]] in 54°10′&amp;nbsp;S, and in the navigation of [[48th meridian west|48° of longitude]] of ice-cumbered sea nearly in [[55th parallel south|55°&amp;nbsp;S]] in 1730. In 1771, [[Yves-Joseph de Kerguelen-Trémarec|Yves Joseph Kerguelen]] sailed from [[France]] with instructions to proceed south from [[Mauritius]] in search of "a very large continent."  He lighted upon a land in [[50th parallel south|50°&amp;nbsp;S]] which he called South France, and believed to be the central mass of the southern continent.  He was sent out again to complete the exploration of the new land, and found it to be only an inhospitable island which he renamed in disgust the Isle of Desolation, but in which posterity has recognized his courageous efforts by naming it [[Kerguelen Islands|Kerguelen Land]].&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911 |inline=1 |title=Polar Regions |pages=961–962 |url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri21chisrich#page/938/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The obsession of the undiscovered continent culminated in the brain of [[Alexander Dalrymple]], a [[Hydrography|hydrographer]] who was nominated by the [[Royal Society]] to command the [[Transit of Venus]] expedition to [[Tahiti]] in 1769.  The command of the expedition was given by the admiralty to Captain [[James Cook]]. Sailing in 1772 with the ''Resolution'' and the ''Adventure'' under Captain [[Tobias Furneaux]], Cook first searched in vain for [[Bouvet Island]], then sailed for 20 degrees of longitude to the westward in [[58th parallel south|latitude 58°&amp;nbsp;S]], and then 30° eastward for the most part south of [[60th parallel south|60°&amp;nbsp;S]], a higher southern latitude than had ever been voluntarily entered before by any vessel.  On 17 January 1773 the [[Antarctic Circle]] was crossed for the first time in history and the two ships reached {{nowrap|67° 15' S}} by {{nowrap|39° 35' E}}, where their course was stopped by ice.

The first land south of the [[60th parallel south|parallel 60° south latitude]] was discovered by the Englishman [[William Smith (mariner)|William Smith]], who sighted [[Livingston Island]] on 19 February 1819.

In 1820, several expeditions claimed to have been the first to have sighted Antarctica. The first confirmed sighting of mainland Antarctica cannot be accurately attributed to one single person. It can, however, be narrowed down to three individuals. According to various sources,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/1997/antpanel/antpan05.pdf |title=Antarctica —past and present |author=U.S. Antarctic Program External Panel |publisher=[[National Science Foundation|NSF]] |accessdate=2007-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quest.arc.nasa.gov/antarctica/background/NSF/palmer.html |title=Nathaniel Brown Palmer |first=Guy G. |last=Guthridge |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=2007-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060202101525/http://quest.arc.nasa.gov/antarctica/background/NSF/palmer.html |archivedate=2006-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arcane.ucsd.edu/pstat.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060828065910/http://arcane.ucsd.edu/pstat.html |archivedate=2006-08-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; three men all sighted Antarctica within days or months of each other: [[Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen|Fabian von Bellingshausen]], a captain in the [[Imperial Russian Navy|Russian Imperial Navy]]; [[Edward Bransfield]], a captain in the [[Royal Navy|British navy]]; and [[Nathaniel Palmer]], an American sealer out of [[Stonington, Connecticut]].  It is certain that on 28 January 1820 (New Style), the expedition led by [[Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen|Fabian von Bellingshausen]] and [[Mikhail Petrovich Lazarev]] on two ships reached a point within 20 miles (40&amp;nbsp;km) of the Antarctic mainland and saw ice-fields there. On 30 January 1820, Bransfield sighted [[Trinity Peninsula]], the northernmost point of the Antarctic mainland, while Palmer sighted the mainland in the area south of Trinity Peninsula in November 1820.  Bellingshausen's expedition also discovered [[Peter I Island]] and [[Alexander Island|Alexander I Island]], the first islands to be discovered south of the circle.

Only slightly more than a year later, the first landing on the Antarctic mainland was arguably by the American Captain [[John Davis (sealer)|John Davis]], a sealer, who claimed to have set foot there on 7 February 1821, though this is not accepted by all historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/resources/infosheets/19.html |title=Summary of the Peri-Antarctic Islands |first=R.K. |last=Headland |publisher=Scott Polar Research Institute |accessdate=2007-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2009}}

==== The South Pole (1911)====
[[File:Aan de Zuidpool - p1913-160.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Amundsen's party at the South Pole, December 1911. From left to right: [[Roald Amundsen|Amundsen]], [[Helmer Hanssen|Hanssen]], [[Sverre Hassel|Hassel]] and [[Oscar Wisting|Wisting]] (photo by fifth member [[Olav Bjaaland|Bjaaland)]]]]

After the [[North Magnetic Pole]] was located in 1831, explorers and scientists began looking for the [[South Magnetic Pole]]. [[James Clark Ross]], a British naval officer, identified its approximate location, but was unable to reach it on his trip in 1841. Commanding the British ships ''Erebus'' and ''Terror'', he braved the pack ice and approached what is now known as the [[Ross Ice Shelf]], a massive floating [[ice shelf]] over {{convert|100|ft|m}} high.  His expedition sailed eastward along the southern Antarctic coast discovering mountains which were since named after his ships: [[Mount Erebus]], the most [[Volcano|active volcano]] on Antarctica, and [[Mount Terror (Antarctica)|Mount Terror]].

Once the [[North Pole]] had been reached in 1909, several expeditions attempted to reach the [[South Pole]]. Many resulted in injury and death. The [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Roald Amundsen]] reached the Pole in December 1911, following a race with the [[English people|Englishman]] [[Robert Falcon Scott]].

The first attempt to find a route to the South Pole was made by British explorer [[Robert Falcon Scott]] on the [[Discovery Expedition]] of 1901–04. Scott, accompanied by [[Ernest Shackleton]] and [[Edward Adrian Wilson|Edward Wilson]], set out with the aim of traveling as far south as possible, and on 31 December 1902, reached {{nowrap|82°16&amp;prime; S}}.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LDiGTYXZ9X4C&amp;pg=PA37 ''Science into Policy: Global Lessons from Antarctica'', p. 37], Paul Arthur Berkman, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Shackleton later returned to Antarctica as leader of the [[Nimrod Expedition]] in a bid to reach the Pole. On 9 January 1909, with three companions, he reached {{nowrap|88°23&amp;prime; S}} – 112 [[Mile|statute miles]] from the Pole – before being forced to turn back.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=M1ql3mx8xYgC&amp;pg=PA24 ''Antarctica'', p. 24], Paul Simpson-Housley, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

The first humans to reach the South Pole were [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Amundsen's South Pole expedition|Roald Amundsen and his party]] on December 14, 1911. Amundsen named his camp [[Polheim]] and the entire plateau surrounding the Pole ''[[Antarctic features named after Norwegian royals|King Haakon VII Vidde]]'' in honour of King [[Haakon VII of Norway]]. Robert Falcon Scott had also returned to Antarctica with his second expedition, the [[Terra Nova Expedition]], in a race against Amundsen to the Pole. Scott and four other men reached the South Pole on January 17, 1912, thirty-four days after Amundsen. On the return trip, Scott and his four companions all died of starvation and extreme cold.

In 1914 Ernest Shackleton's [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] set out with the goal of crossing Antarctica via the South Pole, but his ship, the ''[[Endurance (1912 ship)|Endurance]]'', was frozen in [[Sea ice|pack-ice]] and sank 11 months later. The overland journey was never made.

[[File:Mar Saba IMG 1849.JPG|thumb|[[Mar Saba]] monastery]]

The '''Mar Saba letter''' is a Greek document which scholar [[Morton Smith]] reported in 1973 that he had discovered in the library of the [[Mar Saba]] monastery in 1958. The document has been lost and now only survives in two sets of photographs. The text purports to be an [[epistle]] of [[Clement of Alexandria]] and contains the only known references to a "[[Secret Gospel of Mark]]".

==Discovery and disappearance==
In 1973 [[Morton Smith]] published a book on a previously unknown letter of [[Clement of Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;Morton Smith, ''Clement of Alexandria and a Secret Gospel of Mark'' (Harvard University Press) 1973&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that, while cataloging documents at the ancient monastery of [[Mar Saba]] in the summer of 1958, he discovered the text of the letter  handwritten into the endpapers of [[Isaac Vossius]]' 1646 printed edition of the works of [[Ignatius of Antioch]]. This letter is consequently referred to as the Mar Saba letter of [[Clement of Alexandria]]. Smith also published a second book for the popular audience in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Morton Smith, ''The Secret Gospel: The Discovery and Interpretation of the Secret Gospel According to Mark'', London Victor Gollancz Ltd. 1974 {{ISBN|0-575-01801-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith's books reproduced black-and-white photographs which he stated he had taken at the time of the discovery.  In 1976 a group of four scholars&lt;ref&gt;Professors David Flusser and Shlomo Pines, both of the Hebrew University, Jerusalem,  Archimandrite Meliton of the Patriarchate, and G.A.G. Stroumsa, at the time a Harvard graduate student.&lt;/ref&gt; visited [[Mar Saba]], and viewed the manuscript. This visit remained unknown until 2003 when one of the party, G.A.G. Stroumsa, published an account of the visit.&lt;ref&gt;Gedaliahu A. G. Stroumsa, "Comments on Charles Hedrick's article: a testimony", ''Journal of Early Christian Studies'' '''11'''.2 (Summer 2003), pp 147-53.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977 the volume containing the manuscript was taken to the library of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate in Jerusalem. That same year, the manuscript pages were removed from the bound volume by the librarian Kallistos Dourvas, to be photographed and kept separately. These photographs were published in 2000. Subsequent attempts by scholars to view the manuscript have been unsuccessful.  Paleographers, working from Smith's photographs, have assigned dates from the late seventeenth to the early nineteenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Merkel, Helmut. ''Auf den Spuren des Urmarkus? Ein neuer Fund und seine Beurteilung.'' Zeitschrift für Theologie und Kirche 71 (1974): 123-144. p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text==
{{see also|Secret Gospel of Mark}}
The letter, addressed to one Theodore, discusses a "[[Secret Gospel of Mark]]" and quotes two excerpts from this gospel, one of which mentions "the mystery of the kingdom of God." Clement begins by commending Theodore's actions against the [[Carpocrates|Carpocratians]]. He then turns to address questions posed by Theodore regarding the [[Gospel of Mark]], a secret variant of which the Carpocratians claim to have. Clement admits to knowledge of a second secret or mystical version of the gospel, written by Mark for "those being perfected". However, he asserts that the version promoted by the Carpocratians is not an accurate representation of this; they have corrupted the original with their own false additions. To illustrate this, two ostensibly genuine excerpts from the gospel are supplied. The letter breaks off abruptly as Clement begins to explain the passages.

==Controversy over authenticity==
Scholars Philip Jenkins and Robert M. Price noticed parallels between The Secret Gospel of Mark and a novel by [[James H. Hunter|James Hunter]] published in 1940 entitled ''The Mystery of Mar Saba''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hypotyposeis.org/weblog/2005/07/mystery-of-mar-saba.html Hypotyposeis blog]&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=December 2014}} In 1980 the Mar Saba letter was included in the revision of the standard edition of works of Clement of Alexandria:  Otto Stählin and Ursula Treu, ''Clemens Alexandrinus'', vol. 4.1: Register, 2nd ed. (Berlin:Akademie-Verlag, 1980), XVII–XVIII.

Nevertheless, doubts have been expressed about its authenticity. In a 1975 review of Smith's book, [[Quentin Quesnell]] raised doubts about the original manuscript and suggested that it was a [[forgery]] executed sometime between 1936 and 1958. Though Quesnell did not specifically accuse Smith, in the view of Charles W. Hedrick he "broadly hinted" that Smith was the culprit. When Quesnell wrote this, no scholar other than Smith had reported having seen the manuscript. {{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

In 2005 Stephen Carlson published ''Gospel Hoax: Morton Smith's Invention of Secret Mark'', which also asserted that the manuscript was a [[hoax]]. By this time independent confirmation of the manuscript's existence and appearance had been presented by Hedrick and others; Carlson argued that Smith had himself written the text into the book.

Earlier in the same year, Scott Brown published ''Mark's Other Gospel: Rethinking Morton Smith's Controversial Discovery''. In this book he wrote that the [[Secret Gospel of Mark]] was an authentic writing of the evangelist.

Many scholars who accept the letter as a copy of an ancient manuscript believe that it is not the work of the historical Clement. There seems to have been another pseudo-Clement, who was mentioned in the [[Decretum Gelasianum]] as "the other Clement of Alexandria."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ntcanon.org/Decretum_Gelasianum.shtml The Development of the Canon of the New Testament - The Decretum Gelasianum&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The central element of initiation and progress to "the innermost sanctuary of that truth hidden by seven veils" is common to [[Gnostic]] writings and to the [[mystery religions]] of the period. Even so, Clement believed Christianity to be the pure representative of God's true Mysteries which others had stolen and corrupted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Haste, Tiresias; believe, and thou wilt see. Christ, by whom the eyes of the blind recover sight, will shed on thee a light brighter than the sun; night will flee from thee, fire will fear, death will be gone; thou, old man, who saw not Thebes, shalt see the heavens. O truly sacred mysteries! O stainless light! My way is lighted with torches, and I survey the heavens and God; I become holy whilst I am initiated. The Lord is the [[hierophant]], and seals while illuminating him who is initiated, and presents to the Father him who believes, to be kept safe for ever. Such are the reveries of my mysteries. If it is thy wish, be thou also initiated; and thou shall join the choir along with angels around the unbegotten and indestructible and the only true God, the Word of God, raising the hymn with us. — Clement, ''Exhortation to the Heathen,'' xii

He was known worldwide as an economic historian of medieval Europe. [[Eric Hobsbawm]] notes he was one of the best lecturers at Cambridge, adding, "Though passionately anti-communist, Postan was the only man in Cambridge who knew Marx, Weber, Sombart and the rest of the great central and East Europeans, and took their work sufficiently seriously to expound and criticize it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eric Hobsbawm|title=Interesting Times: A Twentieth-Century Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y2gyK5PxNB8C&amp;pg=PA283|year=2003|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|page=283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Expand Serbian|Панта Срећковић|date=March 2015}}
'''Pantelija Slavkov Srećković''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Пантелија Славков Срећковић}}, [[Veliko Krčmare]], near [[Kragujevac]], 3 November 1834 – [[Belgrade]], 8 July 1903), also known as '''Panta Srećković''' (Панта Срећковић) was a Serbian historian and academician, the dean of the [[Grandes écoles]] (''Velika Škola'') in 1884–85, and again in 1890.

==Biography==
Panta Srećković was born in Veliko Krčmare to Slavko (born in 1788) and Marija-Baba (1793-1878), daughter of Proko Ivanović of [[Zabojnica]] who participated in the First and Second Serbian uprisings, as well as in Đakova buna (Djakov Mutiny) in 1825 on the side of [[Miloš Obrenović]]. His paternal grandfather, Srećko Stefanović, was a participant in the [[Habsburg-occupied Serbia (1788-92)]] and during the First Serbian Uprising led 1,000 soldiers (as [[binbashi]]) in [[Lepenica (region)|Lepenica]].

Panta Srećković attended grammar school at Malo Krčmare in the [[Rača]] region ([[Šumadija]] District), gymnasium at [[Drača]], School of Theology in Belgrade's [[Bogoslovija]] and post-graduate studies at the famed [[Kiev Theological Academy]] and Seminary. From 1859 to 1894 he was a history professor at the Belgrade Lycee and from 1863 on, at the ''Grandes écoles''. He was a leading personality of romantic [[historiography]], with [[Miloš Milojević]]. He entered into conflict with [[Ilarion Ruvarac]] and followers of Positivism, critical historiography, and came out almost completely forgotten for a time, but now his work has gained great acclaim.
He was a Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly, Member of Parliament, Academician from 1886, Rector of the ''Grandes écoles'', Pirot District Mayor in 1878. He was very active in the [[Association of Serbo-Macedonians]] and the [[Society of Saint Sava]].

Srećković died 8 July 1903, and was buried at the [[Novo groblje]] in Belgrade.

He was married to Anka, daughter of Marinko Radovanović, Minister of Justice.

On 19 April 1683, due to the efforts of Ritter Vitezović, the Austrian Imperial chancellary proclaimed a charter granting the town of Senj their ancient rights, protecting them from the local military commander captain Herberstein who had terrorised the citizens at the time.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/33565063/Pavao_Ritter_Vitezovic_-_Prigodom_otkrivanja_spomen-ploc_e_u_Bec_u_Scho_nlaterngasse_13_27._VI._2017_&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=September 2013}}

Because of the [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman wars]] he was enlisted and stationed in the [[Međimurje]] ''tabor'' (garrison) under [[ban (title)|ban]] [[Nikola Erdödy|Nicholas Erdödy]]. In 1683, when the [[Great Turkish War]] started, he participated in the capture of the forts of [[Lendava]] and [[Szigetvar]]. After the war, ban Erdödy employed him as an officer of his court, where he also met [[Adam Zrinski]], the son of [[Nikola Zrinski]]. He was initially named the ''podžupan'' of [[Lika]] a purely honourable title with no actual significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Topić|2010|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Then [[Croatian Parliament]] named him as their representative in the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Imperial]] commission for the [[delimitation]] with [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Turkey]], but despite his contribution, the borderlines were drawn against Croatian interests, which greatly frustrated Ritter Vitezović. During his work at the royal and imperial diets in [[Vienna]] and [[Bratislava]], Vitezović met many dignitaries from Croatia, and at one point wished to return home to live in Zagreb.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

==Later years==
In 1690, he returned to Croatia,&lt;ref name="moljac"/&gt; where he found out that there was a printing house in the Bishop's Palace in the city of Zagreb, acquired in 1663, but long since abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dobronić|1995|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; He asked his long-time friend Aleksandar Mikulić, who had by that time been named Bishop,&lt;!-- of what diocese? --&gt; to let him put it to use. He was soon in business, printing calendars and leaflets, and he appealed to the ''Croatian Parliament'' to give that printing house an official capacity. On 11 November 1694, the Parliament did indeed appoint him as the manager of the facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bratulić|1995|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then proceeded to move it from the Vlaška street to his house on [[Grič, Zagreb|Grič]], and then travelled to Vienna, where he bought a new [[printing press]] and everything else necessary for the printing of books. He named the new printing office the "Museum" (like Valvasor before him), and printed the first books in [[Latin]] and in [[Croatian language|Croatian]].

The printing house was in operation between 1695 and 1706, and his best known work ''Croatia rediviva'' ("Croatia revived") was printed there in 1700. On 14 June 1706, the press was largely destroyed in a great fire, and Vitezović's wife died two years later, rendering him entirely distraught.&lt;ref name="moljac"/&gt;

In 1710 he moved to Vienna, where he continued to publish, and was awarded an honorary title of a baron at the Austrian court. This however did not help his material status before he died in 1713.&lt;ref name="moljac"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Ritter Vitezović proposed an idea for orthography solution for the [[Croatian language]] that every sound should have only one letter, and this idea later inspired the linguist [[Ljudevit Gaj]] to reform the Croatian variant of Latin script and create [[Gaj's Latin alphabet]].&lt;ref name="moljac"/&gt;

He created the Croatian [[Exclusivism|exclusivist discourse]] within the early Illyrian movement and introduced the 'historical appropriation' concept to the Balkans which is actually an idea to claim national territory on the basis of the past conquests.&lt;ref name="Trencsényi 2010 220"&gt;{{harvnb|Trencsényi|Zászkaliczky|2010|p=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Macdonald2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Bruce Macdonald|authorlink=David Bruce Macdonald|title=Balkan Holocausts?: Serbian and Croatian Victim Centered Propaganda and the War in Yugoslavia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kBjrJyen4FEC&amp;pg=PA96|accessdate=4 September 2013|year=2002|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-6467-8|page=96|quote= Ironically, the idea of claiming of national territory based on past occupation or conquest was originally a Croatian one.

He was the first ideologist of Croatian nation who proclaimed that all [[Slavs]] are [[Croats]].&lt;ref name="Banac1988"/&gt; The foundations of the concept of [[Greater Croatia]] are laid in Vitezović's works.&lt;ref name="AllcockMilivojević1998"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John B.

Vitezović defined Croatian territory, as including, besides Illyria and all Slavic-populated territory, the territory between the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]], [[Black Sea|Black]] and [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] seas.&lt;ref name="Fine 487"/&gt; He also wrote the first [[history of the Serbs]], which remains in manuscript.&lt;ref name="Trencsényi 2010 220"/&gt; He skillfully fabricated numerous genealogies and forged most of the ''Trophaeum nobilissimae domus Estorasianae'' (a genealogical

'''Pavel Chobanyan''' ({{lang-hy|Պավել Չոբանյան}}, 15 March 1948, [[Shakashen]], [[Goygol District|Goygol]] district, [[Azerbaijan SSR]] - 19 May 2017, [[Yerevan]], [[Armenia]]), Orientalist, Historian, Doctor of History, Professor.

==Biography==
Pavel Chobanyan was born in [[Khanlar]] city of the [[Goygol District|Goygol]] district in [[Azerbaijan SSR]] on March 15, 1948 (native village was historical Pip-Zaglik). In 1973 he graduated with honors from the Archeology, Ethnography and Source Studies Department of the [[Yerevan State University]].

From 1974-1976 P. Chobanyan undertook his PhD in Caucasian and Georgian Studies at the [[Institute of Oriental Studies of the National Academy of Sciences]] conducting his research at the [[Korneli Kekelidze]] [[Georgian National Center of Manuscripts]] under the supervision of [[Yelena Metreveli]] – the head of the above-mentioned Institute, renowned specialist in Georgian Studies and Academician.
In 1982 he defended his Candidate’s dissertation titled “Armenians in the Middle East according to Georgian itineraries”.

In 2006 he defended his Doctoral dissertation titled “Armenian-Russian-Georgian relationships in the second half of the 18th century”.

Professor Chobanyan began his academic activity from the Institute of Oriental Studies of the NAS RA and due to his hard work he managed to become a Deputy Director of the Institute. From 1977 to 1985 he was a junior researcher of the Department of “Caucasian Byzantine Studies” and from 1995 to 1996 he was the Head of the Division “Christian Orient” at the same institute. From 1985 to 1995 he also worked at the Institute of History of NAS RA as a senior researcher. More than 10 years (from 2002 to 2013) he was the scientific Deputy Director at the Institute of Oriental Studies of NAS RA. From 2013 till his last days Professor Chobanyan chaired Department of “Eastern Sources and Historiography” at the Institute of Oriental Studies of NAS RA. 

He has been a member of several scientific and editorial boards for many years. From 1999 to 2003 he had been a deputy editor of the “[[Historical-Philological Journal]] ([[Patma-Banasirakan Handes]])”. In those years under the consistent supervision of Academician [[Mkrtich Nersisyan]], his goal-oriented and hard-working qualities contributed to the prosperity of “Historical-Philological Journal”, which was very important in Armenian studies, as well as to the process of discovery and publication of ratifications of the Armenian-Russian interrelations. 

Since 2013 Pavel Chobanyan held chief-editor’s position of the international scientific editorial board “[[Armenian Studies|Journal of Armenian Studies]]”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.haygithimnadram.am/journals.php?langid=2|title=Journal of Armenian Studies|website=www.haygithimnadram.am|accessdate=2017-01-01}} {{ref-hy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and edited eleven issues of the journal.

From 2007 as a Senior Analytical Scientist his knowledge was used at the [[National Defense Research University]] of the [[Ministry of Defence (Armenia)|Ministry of Defense of Armenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mil.am/en/institutions/60|title=National Defense and Research University of the RA Ministry of Defense|website=www.mil.am|accessdate=2017-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pavel Chobanyan worked in different fields of Social Sciences. He was equally interested in Armenia’s political relations with [[Russia]] and countries in the [[Middle East]], Armenian  communities and their spiritual-cultural life, the history and bibliographic heritage of Georgia, the patterns of Armenian public life development, the contribution of Transcaucasian nations in the world history and many other  issues that are reflected in his bibliography. 

With the emergence of internal and external challenges connected with the newly established [[Republic of Armenia]], there was a greater need for impartial and academically devoted researchers like Pavel Chobanyan.   In 1991, he took part in the important socio-political processes of [[Post-Soviet era]].  He was included in the Pardon Committee under the RA President.

Pavel Chobanyan had also been a member of the “Historian Association of Armenia” NGO.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3717">'''Pierre Devambez''' (19 November 1902 in [[Paris]] – 14 January 1980 in Paris) was a 20th-century French Hellenist, archaeologist and historian of Greek art.

== Biography ==
The son of [[André Devambez]], Pierre Devambez joined the [[École normale supérieure]] in 1922 and passed the [[Agrégation in France|agrégation es lettres]] in 1926. A member of the [[French School at Athens]] (1928–1933) and of the [[Institut Français d'Archéologie Orientale]], he sojourned in Istanbul from 1933 to 1937 and wrote there the ''Catalogue des Grands Bronzes''.

From 1929 to 1933 he directed the excavations at [[Thasos]], what he will do again in 1953–1954, and the excavations of the Sinuri sanctuary in [[Caria]] (1935–1938). He also participates in the work of [[Xanthos]] (1950) and, from 1961 to 1963, to those of [[Laodicea on the Lycus]].

Curator and chief curator of the Department of Greek and Roman antiquities at the [[Louvre]] from 1937, he was also in charge of Greek ceramics course at the [[École du Louvre]]. Providing classes at the École Normale Supérieure (1954), he moved the classical archeology seminar in the halls of the Louvre.

A director of a seminary in Archaic and Classical Greek religion at the [[École pratique des hautes études]] (1961–1967), he was elected a member of the [[Académie des inscriptions et belles-lettres]] in 1970 and would preside the international commission of the ''[[Corpus vasorum antiquorum]]''.

'''Pierre Le Baud''' (c.1450 - 1505) was a 15th-century French clergyman and historian known for his writings on the history of Brittany. He served as [[chaplain]] to duchess of [[Anne of Brittany]].

==Life==
Le Baud was probably born in [[Saint-Ouën-des-Toits]], Maine, on the borders of Brittany.&lt;ref&gt;Du Paz, Histoire Généalogique de plusieurs maisons de Bretagne, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; On entering the church he became attached to the diocese of Nantes. He became cantor and chaplain of [[Laval Cathedral]] and went on to serve as chaplain to local dignitary, Guy de Laval, and then to [[Margaret of Foix]], wife of [[Francis II, Duke of Brittany]]. After the duke's death he became chaplain to the new duchess, his daughter Anne. He seems to have supported Anne's marriage to King [[Charles VIII of France]].

He died on 29 September 1505. The exact date is known because of a note written by his nephew, [[Bertrand d'Argentré]], also a clergyman and historian, who continued Le Baud's work.

==Works==
[[File:Combat des Trente (Le Baud).jpg|thumb|An illustration of the ''Combat des Trente'' ([[Combat of the Thirty]]): an illumination in a manuscript of Le Baud's ''Compillation des cronicques et ystoires des Bretons'' (1480)]]
Le Baud compiled two histories of Brittany. The first was created during Duke Francis' reign, and involves complex genealogical arguments designed to establish the legitimacy and antiquity of the [[Montfort of Brittany|Montfort dynasty]]. Known as ''Compillation des cronicques et ystoires des Bretons'' (Compilation of the Chronicles and Histories of the Bretons), it tells the stories of the ancient Britons from the mythical Trojan [[Brutus of Britain|Brut]]; the migration of the Britons to Brittany; and Breton history up to the death of [[Arthur III, Duke of Brittany]] in 1458. It was later translated into Latin by Bertrand d'Argentré, who continued the narrative up to his own day, in the reign of king [[Francis I of France|Francis I]].

In addition to its own value, Le Baud's "Compilation" is important because it incorporates verbatim, and thus preserves, some very early literature of the history of Brittany, such as the ''[[Life of Saint Goeznovius]]'' and the ''[[Chronicle of Nantes]]''.

His second chronicle, ''Cronique des roys et princes de Bretaigne armoricane'' (Chronicle of the Kings and Princes of Armorican Britain) was completed in 1505, having been written at the request of the Duchess Anne.&lt;ref&gt;"Pierre Le Baud", in Alphonse-Victor Angot, Ferdinand Gaugain, ''Dictionnaire historique, topographique et biographique de la Mayenne'', Goupil, 1900-1910, vol. IV, p. 537.&lt;/ref&gt;

Le Baud also wrote a number of other works, including ''Chronicles of Vitre''; ''Le Discours de l'Origine et Antiquité de Laval'' and ''Le Bréviaire des Bretons'', an account in verse of British/Breton history which includes a version of the story of [[King Leir|King Lear]].

Le Baud's writings were first published in print in 1638 by [[Pierre d'Hozier]], who complied several works under the title ''Histoire de Bretagne, avec les chroniques des maisons de Vitré et de Laval''. [[Arthur de La Borderie]] observed that there were some significant differences between d'Hosier's edition and a surviving early manuscript of one of the works in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]].

[[File:Johann Georg Seitz Gemüsestilleben mit Häschen.jpg|thumb|''Gemüsestilleben mit Häschen'' ("Still Life with Rabbits") by [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Georg_Seitz Johann Georg Seitz] (c. 1870)]]

'''Rabbits and hares are common motifs''' in the [[visual arts]], with variable mythological and artistic meanings in different cultures. The [[rabbit]] as well as the [[hare]] have been associated with [[Lunar deity|moon deities]] and may signify rebirth or resurrection.{{r|Windling}} They may also be symbols of [[fertility]] or sensuality, and they appear in depictions of hunting and spring scenes in the [[Labours of the Months]].

== Judaism ==
[[File:Pederastic gifts Macron Louvre G142 n3.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The rabbit as a gift in courtship, exterior detail of a red-figure [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kylix kylix], (Athens c. 480 BC)]]

In [[Judaism]], the rabbit is considered an unclean animal, because "though it [[ruminant|chews the cud]], does not have a [[Cloven hoof|divided hoof]]."&lt;ref&gt;Leviticus 11.6, cf. Deuteronomy 14.7&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|name=rock hyrax}} This led to derogatory statements in the Christian art of the Middle Ages, and to an ambiguous interpretation of the [[Three hares#In Judaism|rabbit's symbolism]]. The "[[Rock Hyrax|shafan]]" in [[Hebrew]] has symbolic meaning. Although rabbits were a non-[[kosher]] animal in the [[Bible]], positive symbolic connotations were sometimes noted, as for [[Three Lions (disambiguation)|lions]] and eagles. 16th century German scholar [[Rabbi]] [[Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi]], saw the rabbits as a symbol of the [[Diaspora]].  In any case, a [[three hares]] motif was a prominent part of many [[Synagogue]]s.{{r|Windling}}{{r|Wonnenberg}}

== Antiquity ==
In antiquity, the hare, because it was prized as a hunting quarry, was seen as the epitome of the hunted creature that could survive only by prolific breeding. [[Herodotus]],&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''The Histories'' 3.108&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]], [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] and [[Claudius Aelianus]] all described the rabbit as one of the most fertile of animals. It thus became a symbol of vitality, sexual desire and fertility. The hare served as an attribute of [[Aphrodite]] and as a gift between lovers. In [[late antiquity]] it was used as a symbol of good luck and in connection with ancient burial traditions.

== Christian art ==
[[File:1505 Piero di Cosimo Venus, Mars and Cupid anagoria.JPG|thumb|upright=1.8|''Venus, Mars and Cupid'' by [[Piero di Cosimo]], a  Cupid lying on Venus clings to a white rabbit.]]
In [[Early Christian art]], hares appeared on [[relief]]s, [[epitaph]]s, icons and oil lamps although their significance is not always clear.

The ''[[Physiologus]]'', a resource for medieval artists, states that when in danger the rabbit seeks safety by climbing high up rocky cliffs, but when running back down, because of its short front legs, it is quickly caught by its predators.&lt;ref&gt;''Physiologus''. Ed. by Ursula Treu. 3rd edition. Hanau 1998. pp. 103-104 (German).&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, according to the teaching of [[St. Basil]], men should seek his salvation in the rock of Christ, rather than descending to seek worldly things and falling into the hands of the [[devil]]. The negative view of the rabbit as an unclean animal, which derived from the [[Old Testament]], always remained present for [[medieval]] artists and their patrons. Thus the rabbit can have a negative connotation of unbridled sexuality and lust or a positive meaning as a symbol of the steep path to salvation. Whether a representation of a hare in Medieval art represents man falling to his doom or striving for his eternal salvation is therefore open to interpretation, depending on context.

[[File:Paderborner Dom Dreihasenfenster.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[three hares]] at [[Paderborn Cathedral]]]]

The ''Hasenfenster'' (hare windows) in [[Paderborn Cathedral]] and in the [[Muotathal]] Monastery in Switzerland, in which [[three hares]] are depicted with only three ears between them, forming a triangle, can be seen as a symbol of the [[Trinity]], and probably go back to an old symbol for the passage of time. The three hares shown in [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s [[woodcut]], ''The Holy Family with the Three Hares'' (1497), can also be seen as a symbol of the Trinity.

The idea of rabbits as a symbol of vitality, rebirth and resurrection derives from antiquity. This explains their role in connection with [[Easter]], the [[resurrection of Christ]]. The unusual presentation in Christian iconography of a [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]] with the [[Child Jesus|Infant Jesus]] playing with a white rabbit in [[Titian]]'s Parisian painting, can thus be interpreted christologically. Together with the basket of bread and wine, a symbol of the sacrificial death of Christ, the picture may be interpreted as the resurrection of Christ after death.

The phenomenon of [[superfetation]], where embryos from different [[menstrual cycle]]s are present in the [[uterus]], results in hares and rabbits being able to give birth seemingly without having been impregnated, which caused them to be seen as symbols of virginity.&lt;ref&gt;Lumpkin, Susan; John Seidensticker (2011). Rabbits: The Animal Answer Guide. JHU Press. {{ISBN|0-8018-9789-0}}. p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbits also live underground, an echo of the tomb of Christ.
[[File:Tizian-Madonna mit dem Kaninchen.jpg|thumb|left|168px|[[Titian]], ''Mary and Infant Jesus with a rabbit'', Paris, Louvre]]
As a symbol of fertility, white rabbits appear on a wing of the high altar in [[Freiburg Minster]]. They are playing at the feet of two pregnant women, [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and [[Elizabeth (biblical figure)|Elizabeth]]. [[Martin Schongauer]]'s engraving ''Jesus after the Temptation'' (1470) shows nine (three times three) rabbits at the feet of Jesus Christ, which can be seen as a sign of extreme vitality.  In contrast, the tiny squashed rabbits at the base of the columns in [[Jan van Eyck]]'s ''[[Rolin Madonna]]'' symbolize "Lust", as part of a set of references in the painting to all the [[Seven Deadly Sins]].&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, Craig. ''Jan van Eyck, The Play of Realism'', p. 114, Reaktion Books, London, 1991, {{ISBN|0-948462-18-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Giovanni Bellini St Jerome Reading in the Countryside.jpg|thumb|right|''St. Jerome Reading in the Countryside'', by [[Giovanni Bellini]], with a white hare.]]
Hunting scenes in the sacred context can be understood as the pursuit of good through evil. In the Romanesque sculpture (c. 1135) in the [[Königslutter]] imperial Cathedral, a hare pursued by a hunter symbolises the human soul seeking to escape persecution by the devil. Another painting, ''Hares Catch the Hunters'', shows the triumph of good over evil. Alternatively, when an eagle pursues the hare, the eagle can be seen as symbolizing Christ and the hare, uncleanliness and the evil's terror in the face of the light.

In Christian [[iconography]], the hare is an attribute of Saint [[Martin of Tours]] and Saint Alberto di Siena, because legend has it that both protected hares from persecution by dogs and hunters. They are also an attribute of the patron saint of Spanish hunters, [[Olegarius]] of Barcelona. White hares and rabbits were sometimes the symbols of chastity and purity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bunniesinbaskets.org/the-symbolism-of-rabbits-and-hares-by-terri-windling.html|title=the-symbolism-of-rabbits-and-hares|publisher=bunniesinbaskets.org|accessdate= 1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In secular art ==

[[File:Jan Weenix - Een aap en een hond bij dood wild.jpg|thumb|''Hunting still life with lap dog and monkey'' by Jan Weenix, 1714]]
[[File:Germany Hare flask 03.jpg|thumb|Hare flask by German glassworks, 18th century, [[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum]] in [[Warsaw]]]]

In non-religious art of the modern era, the rabbit appears in the same context as in antiquity: as prey for the hunter, or representing spring or autumn, as well as an attribute of Venus and a symbol of physical love.  In cycles of the [[Labours of the Months]], rabbits frequently appear in the spring months. In [[Francesco del Cossa]]'s painting of April in the [[Palazzo Schifanoia]] in [[Ferrara]], Italy, [[Venus]]' children, surrounded by a flock of white rabbits, symbolize love and fertility.

In [[Italian Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] art, rabbits are depicted more often than hares. In an [[allegory]] on lust by [[Pisanello]], a naked woman lies on a couch with a rabbit at her feet. [[Pinturicchio]]'s scene of ''[[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Susanna in the Bath]]'' is displayed in the Vatican's [[Borgia Apartment]]. Here, each of the two old men are accompanied by a pair of hares or rabbits, clearly indicating wanton lust. In [[Piero di Cosimo]]'s painting of Venus and [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], a cupid resting on Venus clings to a white rabbit for similar reasons.

[[Still life]]s in [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and their [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish equivalents]] often included a moralizing element which was understood by their original viewers without assistance: fish and meat can allude to religious dietary precepts, fish indicating fasting while great piles of meat indicate ''[[Original sin|voluptas carnis]]'' (lusts of the flesh), especially if lovers are also depicted. Rabbits and birds, perhaps in the company of [[carrot]]s and other [[phallic symbol]]s, were easily understood by contemporary viewers in the same sense.

As small animals with fur, hares and rabbits allowed the artist to showcase his ability in painting this difficult material.  Dead hares appear in the works of the earliest painter of still life collections of foodstuffs in a kitchen setting, [[Frans Snyders]], and remain a common feature, very often sprawling hung up by a rear leg, in the works of [[Jan Fyt]], [[Adriaen van Utrecht]] and many other specialists in the genre.  By the end of the 17th century, the grander subgenre of the hunting trophy still life appeared, now set outdoors, as though at the back door of a palace or hunting lodge.  Hares (but rarely rabbits) continued to feature in the works of the Dutch and Flemish originators of the genre, and later French painters like [[Jean-Baptiste Oudry]].&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, William S., "Jean-Baptiste Oudry: Hare and Leg of Lamb", p. 150, ''The Bulletin of the Cleveland Museum of Art'', Vol. 57, No. 5 (May, 1970), pp. 149-158
, Cleveland Museum of Art, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25152331 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

From the [[Middle Ages]] until modern times, the right to hunt was a vigorously defended privilege of the ruling classes. Hunting [[Still life]]s, often in combination with hunting equipment, adorn the rooms of baroque palaces, indicating the rank and prestige of their owners. [[Jan Weenix]]' painting shows a still life reminiscent of a trophy case with birds and small game, fine fruits, a pet dog and a pet monkey, arranged in front of a classicising garden sculpture with the figure of [[Hercules]] and an opulent palace in the background. The wealth and luxurious lifestyle of the patron or owner is clearly shown.
 
The children's tales of the English author [[Beatrix Potter]], illustrated by herself, include several titles featuring the badly behaved [[Peter Rabbit]] and other rabbit characters, including her first and most successful book ''[[The Tale of Peter Rabbit]]'' (1902), followed by ''[[The Tale of Benjamin Bunny]]'' (1904), and ''[[The Tale of The Flopsy Bunnies]]'' (1909).  Potter's anthropomorphic clothed rabbits are probably the most familiar artistic rabbits in the English-speaking world, no doubt influenced by illustrations by [[John Tenniel]] of the [[White Rabbit]] in [[Lewis Carroll]]'s book ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''.

[[Joseph Beuys]], who always finds a place for a rabbit in his works, sees it as symbolizing resurrection. In the context of his action "[[How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare]]", he stated that the rabbit "...has a direct relationship to birth... For me, the rabbit is the symbol of incarnation. Because the rabbit shows in reality what man can only show in his thoughts. He buries himself, he buries himself in a depression. He incarnates himself in the earth, and that alone is important."

''[[Masquerade (book)]]'' (1979), written and illustrated by the artist [[Kit Williams]], is ostensibly a children’s book, but contains elaborate clues to the location of a jewelled golden hare, also made by Williams, which he had buried at the location in England to which the clues in the book led.  The hare was not found until 1982, in what later emerged as dubious circumstances.

The Welsh sculptor [[Barry Flanagan]] (1944-2009) was best known for his energetic bronzes of hares, which he produced throughout his career. Many have a comic element, and the length and thinness of the hare's body is often exaggerated.

=== Dürer's ''Young Hare'' ===
{{Anchor|Dürer's hare|reason="Dürer's hare" is the old subsection name, which was changed to "Dürer's ''Young Hare''" on 8 March 2018.}}
[[File:Albrecht Dürer - Hare, 1502 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''[[Young Hare]]'', by [[Albrecht Dürer]] (1502)]]
[[File:Wolpertinger.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Wolpertinger]]'' (2005), in the style of Albrecht Dürer]]

Probably one of the most famous depictions of an animal in the history of European art is the painting ''[[Young Hare]]'' by [[Albrecht Dürer]], completed in 1502 and now preserved in the [[Albertina]] in Vienna. Dürer's [[watercolor]] is seen in the context of his other nature studies, such as his almost equally famous ''Meadow'' or his ''Bird Wings''. He chose to paint these in watercolor or [[gouache]], striving for the highest possible precision and "realistic" representation.

The hare pictured by Dürer probably does not have a symbolic meaning, but it does have an exceptional reception history. Reproductions of Dürer's ''Hare'' have often been a permanent component of [[bourgeois]] living rooms in Germany. The image has been printed in textbooks; published in countless reproductions; embossed in copper, wood or stone; represented three-dimensionally in plastic or plaster; encased in [[plexiglas]]; painted on ostrich eggs; printed on plastic bags; surreally distorted in ''Hasengiraffe'' ("Haregiraffe") by Martin Missfeldt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.martin-missfeldt.de/kunst-bilder/albrecht-duerer/hase-albrecht-duerer.php|title=Hase nach Albrecht Dürer|website=www.martin-missfeldt.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; reproduced as a joke by [[Fluxus]] artists;{{r|fluxus}} and cast in gold; or sold cheaply in [[art galleries|galleries]] and at [[art fairs]]

Since early 2000, [[Ottmar Hörl]] has created several works based on Dürer's ''Hare,'' including a giant pink version.&lt;ref name="Hörl’s Pink Hare"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smyth|first1=Debbie|title=Pink Rabbit!|url=https://travelwithintent.com/2015/03/26/pink-rabbit-young-hare-vienna/|website=Travel with Intent|accessdate=8 March 2018|date=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sigmar Polke]] has also engaged with the hare on paper or textiles, or as part of his installations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum-frieder-burda.de/1.328.2.html?&amp;shadow=79&amp;cHash=93690b7a29|title=Illustration, Gouache on patterned fabric|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even in rubber band form.&lt;ref name="Poke rubber band"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Butler|first1=Sharon|title=More on Prince, Polke, and rubber bands|url=http://www.twocoatsofpaint.com/2012/06/more-on-prince-polke-and-rubber-bands.html|website=Two Coats of Paint|accessdate=8 March 2018|date=5 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dieter Roth]]'s ''Köttelkarnikel'' ("Turd Bunny") is a copy of Dürer's ''Hare'' made from rabbit droppings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leben.freenet.de/pictureshow/reisen/multimedial-kuenstler-roth_799796_533042_779680_6.html|title=Multimedial: Künstler Roth|website=leben.freenet.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Klaus Staeck]] enclosed one in a little wooden box, with a cutout hole, so that it could look out and breathe. Dürer's ''Hare'' has even inspired a depiction of the mythological [[Wolpertinger]].

'''Sino-Roman relations''' comprised the mostly indirect contact, flow of trade goods, information, and occasional travellers between the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Han dynasty|Han Empire]] of China, as well as between the later [[Eastern Roman Empire]] and various [[Dynasties in Chinese history|Chinese dynasties]]. These empires inched progressively closer in the course of the Roman expansion into the [[ancient Near East]] and simultaneous Han Chinese military incursions into [[Central Asia]]. Mutual awareness remained low, and firm knowledge about each other was limited. Only a few attempts at direct contact are known from records. Intermediate empires such as the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]] and [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]], seeking to maintain lucrative control over the silk trade, inhibited direct contact between these two [[Eurasia]]n powers. In 97 AD, the [[Military history of China before 1911|Chinese]] general [[Ban Chao]] tried to send his envoy [[Gan Ying]] to [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], but Gan was dissuaded by [[Parthia]]ns from venturing beyond the [[Persian Gulf]]. Several alleged Roman emissaries to China were recorded by ancient Chinese historians. The first one on record, supposedly from either the Roman emperor [[Antoninus Pius]] or his adopted son [[Marcus Aurelius]], arrived in 166 AD. Others are recorded as arriving in 226 and 284 AD, with a long absence until the first recorded [[Byzantine diplomacy|Byzantine embassy]] in 643 AD.

The indirect exchange of goods on land along the [[Silk Road]] and [[Indo–Roman trade relations|sea routes]] included Chinese [[silk]], [[Roman glass]]ware and high-quality cloth. [[Roman currency|Roman coins]] minted from the 1st century AD onwards have been found in China, as well as a coin of [[Maximian]] and [[medal]]lions from the reigns of Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius in [[Jiaozhi]] in modern Vietnam, the same region at which Chinese sources claim the Romans first landed. Roman glassware and silverware have been discovered at Chinese archaeological sites dated to the [[History of the Han dynasty|Han period]]. Roman coins and glass beads have also been found in Japan.

In [[Classical antiquity|classical]] sources, the problem of identifying references to ancient China is exacerbated by the interpretation of the Latin term ''[[Seres]]'', whose meaning fluctuated and could refer to several Asian peoples in a wide arc from India over Central Asia to China. In Chinese records, the Roman Empire came to be known as ''[[Daqin]]'' or Great Qin. Daqin was directly associated with the later ''Fulin'' ({{lang|zh|拂菻}}) in Chinese sources, which has been identified by scholars such as [[Friedrich Hirth]] as the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Chinese sources describe several embassies of Fulin arriving in China during the [[Tang dynasty]] and also mention the [[Siege of Constantinople (674-678)|siege of Constantinople]] by the forces of [[Muawiyah I]] in 674–678 AD.

[[Roman geographers|Geographers in the Roman Empire]] such as [[Ptolemy]] provided a rough sketch of the eastern [[Indian Ocean]], including the [[Malay Peninsula]] and beyond this the [[Gulf of Thailand]] and [[South China Sea]]. Ptolemy's [[Cattigara]] was most likely [[Óc Eo]], Vietnam, where [[Antonine]]-era Roman items have been found. Ancient [[Chinese geography|Chinese geographers]] demonstrated a general knowledge of [[West Asia]] and [[Roman province|Rome's eastern provinces]]. The 7th-century AD Byzantine historian [[Theophylact Simocatta]] wrote of the contemporary [[Sui dynasty|reunification]] of [[northern and southern China]], which he treated as [[Northern and Southern dynasties|separate nations recently at war]]. This mirrors both the [[Chen dynasty|conquest of Chen]] by [[Emperor Wen of Sui]] (reigned 581–604 AD) as well as the names ''[[Cathay]]'' and ''[[Manzi (geography)|Mangi]]'' used by later [[Europeans in Medieval China|medieval Europeans in China]] during the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]]-led [[Yuan dynasty]] and [[Han Chinese|Han-Chinese]] [[Southern Song dynasty]].

Beginning in the 1st century BC with [[Virgil]], [[Horace]], and [[Strabo]], Roman histories offer only vague accounts of China and the silk-producing Seres people of the [[Far East]], who were perhaps the ancient Chinese.&lt;ref name="ostrovsky 2007 p44"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lewis 2007 143"&gt;Lewis (2007), p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1st-century AD geographer [[Pomponius Mela]] asserted that the lands of the Seres formed the centre of the coast of [[Pacific Ocean|an eastern ocean]], flanked to the south by India and to the north by the [[Scythians]] of the [[Eurasian Steppe]].&lt;ref name="ostrovsky 2007 p44"/&gt; The 2nd-century AD Roman historian [[Florus]] seems to have confused the Seres with peoples of India, or at least noted that their skin complexions proved that they both lived "beneath another sky" than the Romans.&lt;ref name="ostrovsky 2007 p44"&gt;Ostrovsky (2007), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Roman authors generally seem to have been confused about where the Seres were located, in either Central Asia or East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Schoff (1915), p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] (c. 330 – c. 400 AD) wrote that the land of the Seres was enclosed by great natural walls around a river called Bautis, possibly a description of the [[Yellow River]].&lt;ref name="ostrovsky 2007 p44"/&gt;

The existence of China was known to [[Roman cartographers]], but their understanding of it was less certain. Ptolemy's 2nd-century AD ''[[Ptolemy's Geography|Geography]]'' separates the Land of Silk (''Serica'') at the end of the overland [[Silk Road]] from the land of the [[Qin Empire|Qin]] (''Sinae'') reached by sea.&lt;ref&gt;Yule (1915), pp. 1–2, 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sinae are placed on the northern shore of the [[Magnus Sinus|Great Gulf]] (''Magnus Sinus'') east of the [[Golden Peninsula]] (''Aurea Chersonesus'', Malay Peninsula). Their chief port, Cattigara, seems to have been in the lower [[Mekong Delta]].&lt;ref name="young 2001 p 29"/&gt; The Great Gulf served as a combined [[Gulf of Thailand]] and [[South China Sea]], as [[Marinus of Tyre]] and Ptolemy's belief that the Indian Ocean was an inland sea caused them to bend the [[Cambodia]]n coast south beyond the equator before turning west to join southern [[Ancient Libya|Libya]] ([[Africa]]).&lt;ref name="mclaughlin 2010 pp58-59"&gt;Raoul McLaughlin (2010), pp. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suárez (1999), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this is given as [[terra incognita|unknown lands]], but the north-eastern area is placed under the Sinae.&lt;ref&gt;Wilford (2000), p. 38; ''Encyclopaedia Britannica'' (1903), p. 1540.&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical geographers such as [[Geographica|Strabo]] and [[Pliny the Elder]] were slow to incorporate new information into their works and, from their positions as [[auctoritas|esteemed scholars]], were seemingly prejudiced against lowly merchants and their [[topographical]] accounts.&lt;ref name="parker 2008 p118"/&gt; Ptolemy's work represents a break from this, since he demonstrated an openness to their accounts and would not have been able to chart the [[Bay of Bengal]] so accurately without the input of traders.&lt;ref name="parker 2008 p118"&gt;Parker (2008), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1st-century AD ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'', its anonymous Greek-speaking author, a merchant of [[Roman Egypt]], provides such vivid accounts of eastern trade cities that it is clear he visited many of them.&lt;ref name="schoff 1912 intro"/&gt; These include sites in Arabia, Pakistan, and India, including [[guide book|travel times from rivers and towns]], where to [[anchorage (shipping)|drop anchor]], the locations of royal courts, lifestyles of the locals and goods found in their markets, and favourable times of year to sail from Egypt to these places to catch the [[monsoon]] winds.&lt;ref name="schoff 1912 intro"&gt;Schoff (2004) [1912], [http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/periplus/periplus.html Introduction]. Retrieved 19 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Periplus'' also mentions a great inland city, ''Thinae'' (or ''Sinae''), in a country called ''This'' that perhaps stretched as far as the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]].&lt;ref name="schoff 2004 paragraph64"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yule 1915 footnote2 p43"/&gt; The text notes that silk produced there travelled to neighbouring India via the [[Ganges]] and to [[Bactria]] by a land route.&lt;ref name="schoff 2004 paragraph64" /&gt; Marinus and Ptolemy had relied on the testimony of a Greek sailor named Alexander, probably a merchant, for how to reach Cattigara (most likely Óc Eo, Vietnam).&lt;ref name="young 2001 p 29" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mawer 2013 p38" /&gt; Alexander (Greek: Alexandros) mentions that the main terminus for Roman traders was a Burmese city called Tamala on the north-west Malay Peninsula, where Indian merchants travelled overland across the [[Kra Isthmus]] to reach the Perimulic Gulf (the Gulf of [[Thailand]]).&lt;ref name="mclaughlin 2014 p205" /&gt; Alexandros claimed that it took twenty days to sail from Thailand to a port called "Zabia" (or ''Zaba'') in southern Vietnam.&lt;ref name="mclaughlin 2014 p205"&gt;McLaughlin (2014), p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="suarez 1999 p90"&gt;Suárez (1999), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, one could continue along the coast (of southern Vietnam) from Zabia until reaching the trade port of Cattigara after an unspecified number of days (with "some" being interpreted as "many" by Marinus).&lt;ref name="mclaughlin 2014 p205"/&gt;&lt;ref name="suarez 1999 p90" /&gt;

[[Cosmas Indicopleustes]], a 6th-century AD Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Greek monk from [[Alexandria]] and former merchant with experience in the Indian Ocean trade, was the first Roman to write clearly about China in his ''[[Christian Topography]]'' (c. 550 AD).&lt;ref&gt;Yule (1915), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; He called it the country of ''[[Names of China|Tzinista]]'' (comparable to [[Sanskrit]] ''Chinasthana'' and [[Syriac language|Syriac]] ''Sinistan'' from the 781 AD [[Nestorian Stele]] of [[Xi'an]], China), located in easternmost Asia.&lt;ref name="yule 1915 p28"&gt;Yule (1915), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lieu (2009), p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; He explained the maritime route towards it (first sailing east and then north up the southern coast of the Asian continent) and the fact that [[clove]]s came that way to [[Sri Lanka]] for sale.&lt;ref name="yule 1915 p28"/&gt; By the time of [[Byzantine emperor|the Eastern Roman]] ruler [[Justinian I]] (r. 527–565 AD), the Byzantines purchased Chinese silk from [[Sogdia]]n intermediaries.&lt;ref name="luttwak 2008 p168" /&gt; They also [[Smuggling of silkworm eggs into the Byzantine Empire|smuggled silkworms out of China]] with the help of [[Nestorian]] monks, who claimed that the land of [[Serindia]] was located north of India and produced the finest silk.&lt;ref name="luttwak 2008 p168"&gt;Luttwak (2009), p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; By smuggling silkworms and producing silk of their own, the Byzantines could bypass the Chinese silk trade dominated by their chief rivals, the [[Sasanian Empire]].&lt;ref name="luttwak 2008 pp168-169" /&gt;

From [[Turkic Khaganate|Turkic peoples]] of Central Asia during the [[Northern Wei]] (386–535 AD) period the Eastern Romans acquired yet another [[Names of China|name for China]]: ''[[Tuoba|Taugast]]'' ([[Old Turkic language|Old Turkic]]: ''[[Tuoba|Tabghach]]'').&lt;ref name="luttwak 2008 p168"/&gt; [[Theophylact Simocatta]], a historian during the reign of [[Heraclius]] (r. 610–641 AD), wrote that Taugast (or Taugas) was a great eastern empire [[Xianbei|colonised by Turkic people]], with a capital city {{convert|2400|km}} northeast of India that he called ''Khubdan'' (from the Turkic word ''Khumdan'' used for the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] and Tang capital [[Chang'an]]), where [[Chinese folk religion|idolatry was practised]] but the people were wise and lived by just laws.&lt;ref&gt;Yule (1915), pp. 29–31; footnote #3 on p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; He depicted the Chinese empire as being divided by a great river (the [[Yangzi]]) that served as the boundary between [[Northern and Southern dynasties|two rival nations at war]]; during the reign of Byzantine Emperor [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]] (582–602 AD) the northerners wearing "black coats" conquered the "red coats" of the south (black being a distinctive colour worn by the people of [[Shaanxi]], location of the Sui capital Sui Chang'an, according to the 16th-century Persian traveller Hajji Mahomed, or Chaggi Memet).&lt;ref name="yule 1915 p30 and footnote2"&gt;Yule (1915), p. 30; footnote #2 on p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; This account may correspond to the conquest of the [[Chen dynasty]] and reunification of China by [[Emperor Wen of Sui]] (r. 581–604 AD).&lt;ref name="yule 1915 p30 and footnote2"/&gt; Simocatta names their ruler as ''Taisson'', which he claimed meant [[Chinese emperor|Son of God]], either correlating to the Chinese ''Tianzi'' ([[Son of Heaven]]) or even the name of the contemporary ruler [[Emperor Taizong of Tang]] (r. 626 – 649 AD).&lt;ref&gt;Yule (1915), p 29; footnote #4 on p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Later [[Europeans in Medieval China|medieval Europeans in China]] wrote of it as two separate countries, with ''[[Cathay]]'' in the north and ''[[Manzi (geography)|Mangi]]'' in the south, during the period when the [[Yuan dynasty]] led by Mongol ruler [[Kublai Khan]] (r. 1260–1294 AD) conquered the [[Southern Song Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Haw (2006), pp. 170–171.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wittfogel &amp; Feng (1946), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yule (1915), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

These accounts became significantly more nuanced in the ''[[Book of Han]]'', co-authored by [[Ban Gu]] and his sister [[Ban Zhao]], younger siblings of the general [[Ban Chao]], who led military exploits [[Protectorate of the Western Regions|into Central Asia]] before returning to China in 102 AD.&lt;ref name="halsall 2000"/&gt; The westernmost territories of Asia as described in the ''[[Book of the Later Han]]'' compiled by [[Fan Ye (historian)|Fan Ye]] (398–445 AD) formed the basis for almost all later accounts of Daqin.&lt;ref name="halsall 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For the assertion that the first Chinese mention of Daqin belongs to the ''Book of the Later Han'', see: Wilkinson (2000), p. 730.&lt;/ref&gt; These accounts seem to be restricted to descriptions of the [[Levant]], particularly [[History of Syria|Syria]].&lt;ref name="halsall 2000"/&gt; Historical linguist [[Edwin G.

===Embassy to Augustus===
The historian Florus described the visit of numerous envoys, including the "[[Seres]]" (possibly the Chinese) to the court of the first [[Roman Emperor]] [[Augustus]] (r. 27 BC – 14 AD):
{{quote|Even the rest of the nations of the world which were not subject to the imperial sway were sensible of its grandeur, and looked with reverence to the Roman people, the great conqueror of nations. Thus even [[Scythians]] and [[Sarmatians]] sent envoys to seek the friendship of Rome. Nay, the Seres came likewise, and the [[Middle kingdoms of India|Indians]] who dwelt beneath the vertical sun, bringing presents of precious stones and pearls and elephants, but thinking all of less moment than the vastness of the journey which they had undertaken, and which they said had occupied four years. In truth it needed but to look at their complexion to see that they were people of another world than ours.&lt;ref&gt;[[Florus]], as quoted in Yule (1915), p. 18; footnote #1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the entire corpus of [[Roman literature]] and [[Roman historiography|historiography]], Yule was unable to uncover any other mention of such a direct diplomatic encounter between the Romans and the Seres.&lt;ref group="note" name="yule 1915 p18"/&gt; He speculated that these people were more likely to have been private merchants than diplomats, since Chinese records insist that [[Gan Ying]] was the first Chinese to reach as far west as Tiaozhi ({{lang|zh|条支}}; [[Mesopotamia]]) in 97 AD.&lt;ref group="note" name="yule 1915 p18"&gt;Yule (1915), p. 18; for a discussion of ''Tiaozhi'' (条支) and even its [[etymology]] possibly stemming from the [[Tajiks]] and [[Iranian peoples]] under ancient Chinese rule, see footnote #2 on p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Yule notes that the 1st-century AD ''Periplus'' mentioned that people of ''Thinae'' ([[Sinae]]) were rarely seen, because of the difficulties of reaching that country.&lt;ref name="schoff 2004 paragraph64"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yule 1915 footnote2 p43"&gt;Yule (1915), footnote #2 on p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; It states that their country, located under [[Ursa Minor]] and on the farthest unknown reaches of the [[Caspian Sea]], was the origin of raw silk and fine silk cloth that was traded overland from [[Bactria]] to [[Barygaza]], as well as down the Ganges.&lt;ref name="schoff 2004 paragraph64"&gt;Schoff (2004) [1912], [http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/periplus/periplus.html#64 Paragraph #64].

{{Further|Protectorate of the Western Regions|Chinese exploration|Dayuan|Daxia|Kangju|History of the Han dynasty}}
The [[Eastern Han]] general [[Ban Chao]] (32–102 AD), in a series of military successes which brought the [[Western Regions]] (the [[Tarim Basin]] of Xinjiang) back under Chinese control and suzerainty, defeated the [[Yuezhi|Da Yuezhi]] in 90 AD and the [[Xiongnu|Northern Xiongnu]] in 91 AD, forcing the submission of city-states such as [[Kucha]] and [[Turfan]], [[Khotan]] and [[Kashgar]] (Indo-European [[Tocharians|Tocharian]] and [[Saka]] settlements, respectively),&lt;ref&gt;Tremblay (2007), p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; and finally [[Karasahr]] in 94 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Crespigny (2007), p. 590.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yule (1915), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; An embassy from the [[Parthian Empire]] of [[Persia]] and [[Mesopotamia]] had earlier arrived at the Han court in 89 AD and, while Ban was stationed with his army in [[Kingdom of Khotan|Khotan]], another Parthian embassy came in 101 AD, this time bringing exotic gifts such as [[ostrich]]es.&lt;ref name="crespigny 2007 pp590-591"&gt;Crespigny (2007), pp. 590–591.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 97 AD, Ban Chao sent an envoy named Gan Ying to explore the far west. Gan made his way from the Tarim Basin to [[Parthia]] and reached the Persian Gulf.&lt;ref name="crespigny 2007 pp 239-240"&gt;Crespigny (2007), pp. 239–240.&lt;/ref&gt; Gan left a detailed account of western countries; he apparently reached as far as Mesopotamia, then under the control of the Parthian Empire. He intended to sail to the Roman Empire, but was discouraged when told that the trip was dangerous and could take two years.&lt;ref&gt;Hill (2009), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pulleyblank (1999), pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Deterred, he returned to China bringing much new information on the countries to the west of Chinese-controlled territories,&lt;ref&gt;Hill (2009), pp. 5, 481–483.&lt;/ref&gt; as far as the [[Mediterranean Basin]].&lt;ref name="crespigny 2007 pp 239-240"/&gt;

Gan Ying is thought to have left an account of the [[Roman Empire]] (Daqin in Chinese) which relied on secondary sources—likely sailors in the ports which he visited. The ''Book of the Later Han'' locates it in ''Haixi'' ("west of the sea", or [[Roman Egypt]];&lt;ref name="halsall 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="john hill houhanshu 2003 web translation"/&gt; the sea is the one known to the Greeks and Romans as the [[Erythraean Sea]], which included the [[Persian Gulf]], the [[Arabian Sea]], and Red Sea):&lt;ref name="hill 2009 23 25"&gt;Hill (2009), pp. 23, 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are pines and cypresses, as well as trees and plants of all kinds.  It has more than four hundred walled towns. There are several tens of smaller dependent kingdoms. The walls of the towns are made of stone.&lt;ref&gt;''Book of the Later Han'', as quoted in Hill (2009), pp. 23, 25.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ''Book of the Later Han'' gives a positive, if inaccurate, view of [[Cursus honorum|Roman governance]]:
{{quote|Their kings are not permanent rulers, but they appoint men of merit. When a severe calamity visits the country, or untimely rain-storms, the king is deposed and replaced by another. The one relieved from his duties submits to his degradation without a murmur. The inhabitants of that country are tall and well-proportioned, somewhat like the Han [Chinese], whence they are called [Daqin].&lt;ref&gt;''Book of the Later Han'', as quoted in Hirth (2000) [1885], online source, retrieved 10 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Yule noted that although the description of the [[Roman Constitution]] and products was garbled, the ''Book of the Later Han'' offered an accurate depiction of the [[Coral reef fish|coral fisheries in the Mediterranean]].&lt;ref name="yule 1915 pp43-44"&gt;Yule (1915), pp. 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Coral]] was a highly valued luxury item in Han China, imported among other items from India (mostly overland and perhaps also by sea), the latter region being where the Romans sold coral and obtained [[pearl]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Kumar (2005), pp. 61–62.&lt;/ref&gt; The original list of Roman products given in the ''Book of the Later Han'', such as [[sea silk]], [[glass]], [[amber]], [[cinnabar]], and [[asbestos]] cloth, is expanded in the ''[[Weilüe]]''.&lt;ref name="hill 2004 webpage"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hill (2009), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Weilüe'' also claimed that in 134 AD the ruler of the [[Shule Kingdom]] (Kashgar), who had been a hostage at the court of the [[Kushan Empire]], offered blue (or green) gems originating from ''Haixi'' as gifts to the Eastern Han court.&lt;ref name="hill 2004 webpage"/&gt; [[Fan Ye (historian)|Fan Ye]], the editor of the ''Book of the Later Han'', wrote that former generations of Chinese had never reached these far western regions, but that the report of Gan Ying revealed to the Chinese their lands, customs and products.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, John E. (2012) ''Through the Jade Gate: China to Rome'' 2nd edition, p. 55. In press.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Book of the Later Han'' also asserts that the Parthians ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 安息; ''Anxi'') wished "to control the trade in multi-coloured Chinese silks" and therefore intentionally blocked the Romans from reaching China.&lt;ref name="john hill houhanshu 2003 web translation"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/hhshu/hou_han_shu.html#sec11|title=The Western Regions according to the Hou Hanshu: The Xiyu juan, "Chapter on the Western Regions", from Hou Hanshu 88, Second Edition (Extensively revised with additional notes and appendices)|first=Ye|last=Fan|authorlink= Fan Ye (historian)|editor=John E.

It is possible that a group of Greek acrobatic performers, who claimed to be from a place "west of the seas" (Roman Egypt, which the ''Book of the Later Han'' related to the Daqin empire), were presented [[Pyu city-states|by a king of Burma]] to Emperor An of Han in 120 AD.&lt;ref group="note" name="book of later han passage"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Fan Ye|editor-link=Fan Ye (historian)|title=後漢書|trans-title=[[Book of the Later Han]]|origyear=445|location=Beijing|publisher=Zhonghua Publishing|year=1965|chapter='''86''': 南蠻西南夷列傳 ([[Nanman]], Xinanyi liezhuan: Traditions of the Southern Savages and South-Western Tribes)|page=2851}} "永寧元年，撣國王雍由調復遣使者詣闕朝賀，獻樂及幻人，能變化吐火，自支解，易牛馬頭。又善跳丸， 數乃至千。自言我海西人。海西即大秦也，撣國西南通大秦。明年元會，安帝作樂於庭，封雍由調爲漢大都尉，賜印綬､金銀､綵繒各有差也。"&lt;br/&gt;A translation of this passage into English, in addition to an explanation of how Greek athletic performers figured prominently in the neighbouring Parthian and Kushan Empires of Asia, is offered by Christopoulos (August 2012), pp. 40–41:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The first year of Yongning (120 AD), the southwestern barbarian king of the kingdom of Chan (Burma), Yongyou, proposed illusionists (jugglers) who could metamorphose themselves and spit out fire; they could dismember themselves and change an ox head into a horse head. They were very skilful in acrobatics and they could do a thousand other things. They said that they were from the "west of the seas" (Haixi–Egypt). The west of the seas is the Daqin (Rome).

===First Roman embassy===

The first group of people claiming to be an ambassadorial mission of Romans to China was recorded as having arrived in 166 AD by the ''Book of the Later Han''. The embassy came to [[Emperor Huan of Han|Emperor Huan]] of [[Han China]] from "Andun" ({{zh|安敦}}; Emperor [[Antoninus Pius]] or [[Marcus Aurelius|Marcus Aurelius Antoninus]]), "king of Daqin" (Rome).&lt;ref name="de crespigny 2007 600"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Yu Ying-shih|Yü]] (1986), pp. 460–461.&lt;/ref&gt; As Antoninus Pius died in 161 AD, leaving the empire to his adoptive son Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, and the envoy arrived in 166 AD, confusion remains about who sent the mission, as both emperors were named "Antoninus".&lt;ref name="Pulleyblank 1999, p. 78"&gt;Pulleyblank (1999), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hill 2009, p. 27"&gt;Hill (2009), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman mission came from the south (therefore probably by sea), entering China by the frontier of [[Rinan]] or [[Tonkin]] (present-day Vietnam). It brought presents of [[Rhinoceros#Horn trade and use|rhinoceros horns]], [[ivory]], and [[tortoise]] [[Animal shell|shell]], probably acquired in [[Southern Asia]].&lt;ref name="Hill 2009, p. 27"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hill (2009), p. 27 and nn. 12.18 and 12.20.&lt;/ref&gt; The text states that it was the first time there had been direct contact between the two countries.&lt;ref name="Hill 2009, p. 27"/&gt; Yule speculated that the Roman visitors must have lost their original wares due to robbery or shipwreck and used the gifts instead, prompting Chinese sources to suspect them of withholding their more precious valuables, which Yule notes was the same criticism directed at [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Beijing|papal missionary]] [[John of Montecorvino]] when he arrived in China in the late 13th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Yule (1915), pp. 51–52.&lt;/ref&gt; Historians [[Rafe de Crespigny]], [[Peter Fibiger Bang]], and [[Warwick Ball]] believe that this was most likely a group of [[Roman commerce|Roman merchants]] rather than official diplomats sent by Marcus Aurelius.&lt;ref name="ball 2016 p152"&gt;Ball (2016), p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="de crespigny 2007 600"&gt;[[Rafe de Crespigny|de Crespigny]] (2007), p. 600.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bang (2009), p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Crespigny stresses that the presence of this Roman embassy as well as others from [[Tianzhu (India)|Tianzhu]] (in [[northern India]]) and [[Buyeo]] (in [[Manchuria]]) provided much-needed prestige for Emperor Huan, as he was facing serious [[Disasters of the Partisan Prohibitions|political troubles and fallout]] for the forced suicide of politician [[Liang Ji]], who had dominated the Han government well after the death of his sister [[Empress Liang Na]].&lt;ref&gt;de Crespigny. (2007), pp. 597–600.&lt;/ref&gt; Yule emphasised that the Roman embassy was said to come by way of [[Jiaozhi]] in northern Vietnam, the same route that Chinese sources claimed the embassies from Tianzhu (northern India) had used in 159 and 161 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Yule (1915), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yule mentions that in the early 3rd century AD a ruler of Daqin sent an envoy with gifts to the northern Chinese court of [[Cao Wei]] (220–265 AD) that included [[Dichroic glass|glassware of various colours]].&lt;ref name="yule 1915 p53"/&gt; Several years later a Daqin craftsman is mentioned as showing the Chinese how to make "[[Glassblowing|flints into crystal by means of fire]]", a curiosity to the Chinese.&lt;ref name="yule 1915 p53"&gt;Yule (1915), p. 53; see footnotes #4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese histories for the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907 AD) record contacts with merchants from "Fulin" ({{lang|zh|拂菻}}), the new name used to designate the Byzantine Empire.&lt;ref name="halsall 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wilkinson 2000 footnote14"&gt;Wilkinson (2000), p. 730, footnote #14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yule (1915), pp. 55–57.&lt;/ref&gt; The first reported diplomatic contact took place in 643 AD during the reigns of [[Constans II]] (641–668 AD) and [[Emperor Taizong of Tang]] (626–649 AD).&lt;ref name="halsall 2000"&gt;{{cite web|orig-year=1885|year=2000|author=Friedrich Hirth|editor=Jerome S.

A. M. Adshead offer a different transliteration stemming from "[[patriarch]]" or "[[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]]", possibly a reference to one of the acting [[regent]]s for the 13-year-old Byzantine monarch.&lt;ref name="adshead 1995 p105"&gt;Adshead (1995) [1988], p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; The Tang histories record that Constans II sent an embassy in the 17th year of the Zhenguan ({{lang|zh|貞觀}}) regnal period (643 AD), bearing gifts of [[Cranberry glass|red glass]] and green [[gemstone]]s.&lt;ref name="halsall 2000"/&gt; Yule points out that [[Yazdegerd III]] (r. 632–651 AD), last ruler of the Sasanian Empire, sent diplomats to China to secure aid from Emperor Taizong ([[Protectorate General to Pacify the West|considered the suzerain]] over [[Ferghana]] in Central Asia) during the loss of the [[Persian Empire|Persian heartland]] to the Islamic [[Rashidun Caliphate]], which may also have prompted the Byzantines to send envoys to China amid their [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|recent loss of Syria to the Muslims]].&lt;ref&gt;Yule (1915), pp. 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt; Tang Chinese sources also recorded how Sasanian prince [[Peroz III]] (636–679 AD) fled to Tang China following the [[Muslim conquest of Persia|conquest of Persia by the growing Islamic caliphate]].&lt;ref name="adshead 1995 p105"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schafer (1985), pp. 10, 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yule asserts that the additional Fulin embassies during the Tang period arrived in 711 and 719 AD, with another in 742 AD that may have been Nestorian monks.&lt;ref&gt;Yule (1915), pp. 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt; Adshead lists four official diplomatic contacts with Fulin in the ''Old Book of Tang'' as occurring in 643, 667, 701, and 719 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Adshead (1995) [1988], pp. 104–106.&lt;/ref&gt; He speculates that the absence of these missions in Western literary sources can be explained by how the Byzantines typically viewed political relations with powers of the East, as well as the possibility that they were launched on behalf of frontier officials instead of [[Byzantine bureaucracy and aristocracy|the central government]].&lt;ref name="adshead 1995 p104"&gt;Adshead (1995) [1988], p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Yule and Adshead concur that a Fulin diplomatic mission occurred during the reign of [[Justinian II]] (r. 685–695 AD; 705–711 AD). Yule claims it occurred in the year of the emperor's death, 711 AD,&lt;ref&gt;Yule (1915), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Adshead contends that it took place in 701 AD during the usurpation of [[Leontios]] and the emperor's exile in [[Crimea]], perhaps the reason for its omission in [[Roman historiography|Byzantine records]] and the source for confusion in Chinese histories about precisely who sent this embassy.&lt;ref name="adshead 1995 pp105-106"&gt;Adshead (1995), pp. 105–106.&lt;/ref&gt; Justinian II regained the throne with the aid of [[Bulgars]] and a marriage alliance with the [[Khazars]]. Adshead therefore believes a mission sent to Tang China would be consistent with Justinian II's behaviour, especially if he had knowledge of the permission [[Empress Wu Zetian]] granted to [[Narsieh]], son of Peroz III, to march against the Arabs in Central Asia at the end of the 7th century.&lt;ref name="adshead 1995 pp105-106"/&gt; The 719 AD Fulin embassy ostensibly came from [[Leo III the Isaurian]] (r. 717–741 AD) to the court of [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang]] (r. 712–756 AD), during a time when the Byzantine emperor was again reaching out to Eastern powers with a renewed Khazar marriage alliance.&lt;ref name="adshead 1995 p106"&gt;Adshead (1995) [1988], p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; The year of this embassy coincided with Xuanzong's refusal to provide aid to the [[Sogdia]]ns of [[Bukhara]] and [[Samarkand]] against the [[Muslim conquest of Transoxiana|Arab invasion force]].&lt;ref name="adshead 1995 p106"/&gt; An embassy from the Umayyad Caliphate was received by the Tang court in 732 AD; the Arab victory at the 751 AD [[Battle of Talas]] and the [[An Lushan Rebellion]] crippled Tang Chinese interventionist efforts in Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Adshead (1995) [1988], pp. 106–107.&lt;/ref&gt;

The last diplomatic contacts with Fulin are recorded as having taken place in the 11th century AD. From the ''Wenxian Tongkao'', written by historian [[Ma Duanlin]] (1245–1322), and from the ''[[History of Song]]'', it is known that the Byzantine emperor [[Michael VII Doukas|Michael VII Parapinakēs Caesar]] ({{lang|zh|滅力沙靈改撒}}, ''Mie li sha ling kai sa'') of Fulin sent an embassy to China's [[Song dynasty]] that arrived in 1081 AD, during the reign of [[Emperor Shenzong of Song]] (r. 1067–1085 AD).&lt;ref name="halsall 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SezginEhrig-Eggert1996"&gt;Sezgin (1996), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''History of Song'' described the tributary gifts given by the Byzantine embassy as well as the products made in Byzantium. It also described punishments used in [[Byzantine law]], such as the [[capital punishment]] of being stuffed into a "feather bag" and thrown into the sea,&lt;ref name="halsall 2000"/&gt; probably the Romano-Byzantine practice of ''[[poena cullei]]'' (from [[Latin language|Latin]] 'penalty of the sack').&lt;ref&gt;Bauman (2005), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The final recorded embassy arrived in 1091 AD, during the reign of [[Alexios I Komnenos]] (r. 1081–1118 AD); this event is only mentioned in passing.&lt;ref&gt;Yule (1915), pp. 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[History of Yuan]]'' offers a biography of a Byzantine man named Ai-sie (transliteration of either Joshua or Joseph), who originally served the court of [[Güyük Khan]] but later became a head [[Byzantine astronomy|astronomer]] and [[Byzantine medicine|physician]] for the court of [[Kublai Khan]], the Mongol founder of the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271–1368 AD), at [[Khanbaliq]] (modern [[Beijing]]).&lt;ref name="bretschneider 1888p144"&gt;[[Emil Bretschneider|Bretschneider]] (1888), p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; He was eventually granted the title Prince of Fulin ({{lang|zh|拂菻王}}, ''Fúlǐn wáng'') and his children were listed with their [[Chinese name]]s, which seem to match with transliterations of the [[Christian name]]s Elias, Luke, and Antony.&lt;ref name="bretschneider 1888p144"/&gt; Kublai Khan is also known to have sent Nestorian monks, including [[Rabban Bar Sauma]], to the court of Byzantine ruler [[Andronikos II Palaiologos]] (r. 1282–1328 AD), whose [[Byzantine-Mongol alliance|half-sisters were married to the great-grandsons]] of [[Genghis Khan]], making this Byzantine ruler an [[Affinity (law)|in-law with the Mongol ruler]] in Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;Luttwak (2009), p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the [[Mongol Empire]], which [[Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty|eventually included all of China]], there were enough Westerners travelling there that in 1340 AD [[Francesco Balducci Pegolotti]] compiled a [[guide book]] for fellow merchants on how to exchange silver for [[paper money]] to purchase silk [[History of Beijing|in Khanbaliq (Beijing)]].&lt;ref&gt;Spielvogel (2011), p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; By this stage the Eastern Roman Empire, temporarily dismantled by the [[Latin Empire]], had shrunk to the size of a rump state in [[Byzantine Greece|parts of Greece]] and [[Byzantine Anatolia|Anatolia]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobi (1999), pp. 525–542.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reinert (2002), pp. 257–261.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ma Duanlin]], author of the ''Wenxian Tongkao'', noted the shifting political boundaries, albeit based on generally inaccurate and distorted [[political geography]].&lt;ref name="halsall 2000"/&gt; He wrote that historians of the Tang Dynasty considered "Daqin" and "Fulin" to be the same country, but he had his reservations about this due to discrepancies in geographical accounts and other concerns ([[Wade–Giles]] spelling):

{{quote|During the sixth year of Yuan-yu [1091] they sent two embassies, and their king was presented, by Imperial order, with 200 pieces of cloth, pairs of silver vases, and clothing with gold bound in a girdle. According to the historians of the T'ang dynasty, the country of Fulin was held to be identical with the ancient Ta-ts'in. It should be remarked, however, that, although Ta-ts'in has from the Later Han dynasty when Zhongguo was first communicated with, till down to the Chin and T'ang dynasties has offered tribute without interruption, yet the historians of the "four reigns" of the Sung dynasty, in their notices of Fulin, hold that this country has not sent tribute to court up to the time of Yuan-feng [1078–1086] when they sent their first embassy offering local produce. If we, now, hold together the two accounts of Fulin as transmitted by the two different historians, we find that, in the account of the T'ang dynasty, this country is said "to border on the great sea in the west"; whereas the Sung account says that "in the west you have still thirty days' journey to the sea;" and the remaining boundaries do also not tally in the two accounts; nor do the products and the customs of the people. I suspect that we have before us merely an accidental similarity of the name, and that the country is indeed not identical with Ta-ts'in. I have, for this reason, appended the Fulin account of the T'ang dynasty to my chapter on Ta-ts'in, and represented this Fulin of the Sung dynasty as a separate country altogether.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wenxian Tongkao]]'', as quoted in Hirth (2000) [1885], online source, retrieved 10 September 2016; in this passage, "Ta-ts'in" is an alternate spelling of "[[Daqin]]", the former using the [[Wade–Giles]] spelling convention and the latter using [[pinyin]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ''[[History of Ming]]'' expounds how the [[Hongwu Emperor]], founder of the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644 AD), sent a merchant of Fulin named "Nieh-ku-lun" ({{lang|zh|捏古倫}}) back to his native country with a letter announcing the [[History of the Ming dynasty|founding of the Ming dynasty]].&lt;ref name="halsall 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grant2005"&gt;Grant (2005), p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hirth1885"&gt;Hirth (1885), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; It is speculated that the merchant was a [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Beijing|former archbishop]] of [[History of Beijing|Khanbaliq]] called Nicolaus de Bentra (who succeeded [[John of Montecorvino]] for that position).&lt;ref name="halsall 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Luttwak2009 170"&gt;Luttwak (2009), p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''History of Ming'' goes on to explain that contacts between China and Fulin ceased after this point and an envoy of the great western sea (the [[Mediterranean Sea]]) did not appear in China again until the 16th century AD, with the 1582 AD arrival of the Italian [[Jesuit China missions|Jesuit missionary]] [[Matteo Ricci]] in Portuguese [[Macau]].&lt;ref name="halsall 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For information on [[Matteo Ricci]] and [[Europeans in Medieval China|reestablishment of Western contact with China]] by the [[Portuguese Empire]] during the [[Age of Discovery]], see: Fontana (2011), pp. 18–35, 116–118.&lt;/ref&gt;

These include gold-embroidered [[carpet|rugs]] and gold-coloured cloth, [[amber]], [[asbestos]] cloth, and [[sea silk]], which was a cloth made from the silk-like hairs of a Mediterranean shell-fish, the ''[[Pinna nobilis]]''.&lt;ref name="halsall 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thorley 1971 71 80"&gt;Thorley (1971), pp. 71–80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hill (2009), Appendix B – Sea Silk, pp. 466–476.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lewis 2007 115"&gt;Lewis (2007), p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;  As well as silver and bronze items found throughout China dated to the 3rd–2nd centuries BC and perhaps originating from the [[Seleucid Empire]], there is also a Roman [[gilded]] silver plate dated to the 2nd–3rd centuries AD and found in [[Jingyuan County, Gansu]], with a raised [[relief]] image in the centre depicting the Greco-Roman god [[Dionysus]] resting on a feline creature.&lt;ref&gt;Harper (2002), pp. 99–100, 106–107.&lt;/ref&gt;

A maritime route opened up with the Chinese-controlled port of [[Rinan]] in Jiaozhi (centred in modern Vietnam) and the [[Khmer people|Khmer]] kingdom of [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]] by the 2nd century AD, if not earlier.&lt;ref name="osborne 2006 pp24-25"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hill (2009), p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt; Jiaozhi was proposed by [[Ferdinand von Richthofen]] in 1877 to have been the port known to the Greco-Roman geographer [[Ptolemy]] as [[Cattigara]], situated near modern [[Hanoi]].&lt;ref&gt;Ferdinand von Richthofen, ''China'', Berlin, 1877, Vol.I, pp. 504–510; cited in Richard Hennig,''Terrae incognitae : eine Zusammenstellung und kritische Bewertung der wichtigsten vorcolumbischen Entdeckungsreisen an Hand der daruber vorliegenden Originalberichte,'' Band I, ''Altertum bis Ptolemäus,'' Leiden, Brill, 1944, pp. 387, 410–411; cited in Zürcher (2002), pp. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geography (Ptolemy)|Ptolemy wrote]] that Cattigara lay beyond the [[Golden Chersonese]] (the [[Malay Peninsula]]) and was visited by a Greek sailor named Alexander, most likely a merchant.&lt;ref name="young 2001 p 29"/&gt; Richthofen's identification of Cattigara as Hanoi was widely accepted until archaeological discoveries at [[Óc Eo]] (near [[Ho Chi Minh City]]) in the [[Mekong Delta]] during the mid-20th century suggested this may have been its location.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For a summary of scholarly debate about the possible locations of Cattigara by the end of the 20th century, with proposals ranging from [[Guangzhou]], [[Hanoi]], and the [[Mekong River Delta]] of the [[Kingdom of Funan]], see: Suárez (1999), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Granville Allen Mawer states that Ptolemy's Cattigara seems to correspond with the latitude of modern Óc Eo, where Roman goods and native jewellery imitating [[Antonine]] Roman coins have been found.&lt;ref name="mawer 2013 p38"&gt;Mawer (2013), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note" name="Cattigara"&gt;Mawer also mentions [[Kauthara]] (in [[Khánh Hòa Province]], Vietnam) and [[Kutaradja]] ([[Banda Aceh]], Indonesia) as other plausible sites for that port. Mawer (2013), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; At Óc Eo, which was once located along the coastline, Roman coins were among the vestiges of long-distance trade discovered by the French archaeologist [[Louis Malleret]] in the 1940s.&lt;ref name="osborne 2006 pp24-25"&gt;Osborne (2006), pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt; These include Roman golden [[medal]]lions from the reigns of [[Antoninus Pius]] and his successor Marcus Aurelius.&lt;ref name="young 2001 p 29"&gt;Young (2001), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oreilly 2007 p97"/&gt; Ancient Roman glass beads and bracelets were also found at the site.&lt;ref name="oreilly 2007 p97"/&gt;

The trade connection from Cattigara extended, via ports on the coasts of India and Sri Lanka, all the way to Roman-controlled ports in [[Egypt]] and the [[Nabataean]] territories on the north-eastern coast of the Red Sea.&lt;ref&gt;Young (2001), pp. 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt; The archaeologist Warwick Ball does not consider discoveries such as the Roman and Roman-inspired goods at Óc Eo, a coin of Roman emperor [[Maximian]] found in [[Tonkin]], and a Roman bronze lamp at P'ong Tuk in the Mekong Delta, to be conclusive proof that Romans visited these areas and suggests that the items could have been introduced by Indian merchants.&lt;ref name="ball 2016 p153"&gt;[[Warwick Ball|Ball]] (2016), p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; While observing that the Romans had a recognised trading port in Southeast Asia, Dougald O'Reilly writes that there is little evidence to suggest Cattigara was Óc Eo. He argues that the Roman items found there only indicate that the Indian Ocean trade network extended to the ancient Kingdom of Funan.&lt;ref name="oreilly 2007 p97"/&gt;

===Asian silk in the Roman Empire===
[[Roman commerce|Chinese trade with the Roman Empire]], confirmed by the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] desire for silk, started in the 1st century BC. The Romans knew of [[wild silk]] harvested on [[Kos|Cos]] (''[[coa vestis]]''), but they did not at first make the connection with the silk that was produced in the [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir]] [[Sarikol kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Schoff (1915), p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; There were few direct trade contacts between Romans and Han Chinese, as the rival Parthians and Kushans were each protecting their lucrative role as trade intermediaries.&lt;ref&gt;Thorley (1979), pp. 181–190 (187f.).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thorley (1971), pp. 71–80 (76).&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1st century BC silk was still a rare commodity in the Roman world; by the 1st century AD this valuable trade item became much more widely available.&lt;ref name="whitfield 1999 p21"&gt;Whitfield (1999), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' (77–79 AD), [[Pliny the Elder]] lamented the financial drain of coin from the [[Roman economy]] to purchase this expensive luxury. He remarked that Rome's "womankind" and the purchase of luxury goods from India, Arabia, and the Seres of the [[Far East]] cost the empire roughly 100 million [[sesterces]] per year,&lt;ref&gt;"India, China and the Arabian peninsula take one hundred million [[sesterce]]s from our empire per annum at a conservative estimate: that is what our luxuries and women cost us. For what fraction of these imports is intended for sacrifices to the gods or the spirits of the dead?" Original Latin: "minimaque computatione miliens centena milia sestertium annis omnibus India et Seres et paeninsula illa imperio nostro adimunt: tanti nobis deliciae et feminae constant. quota enim portio ex illis ad deos, quaeso, iam vel ad inferos pertinet?" Pliny, Historia Naturae 12.41.84.&lt;/ref&gt; and claimed that journeys were made to the Seres to acquire silk cloth along with [[pearl diving]] in the [[Red Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Natural History (Pliny)|''Natural History'' (Pliny)]], as quoted in Whitfield (1999), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lewis 2007 115"/&gt; Despite the claims by Pliny the Elder about the trade imbalance and quantity of Rome's coinage used to purchase silk, Warwick Ball asserts that the Roman purchase of other foreign commodities, particularly [[spice trade|spices from India]], had a much greater impact on the Roman economy.&lt;ref name="ball 2016 p154"/&gt; In 14 AD the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] issued an edict prohibiting the wearing of silk by men, but it continued to flow unabated into the Roman world.&lt;ref name="whitfield 1999 p21"/&gt;  Beyond the economic concerns that the import of silk caused a huge outflow of wealth, silk clothes were also considered to be decadent and immoral by [[Seneca the Elder]]:

{{quote|I can see clothes of silk, if materials that do not hide the body, nor even one's decency, can be called clothes&amp;nbsp;... Wretched flocks of maids labour so that the adulteress may be visible through her thin dress, so that her husband has no more acquaintance than any outsider or foreigner with his wife's body.|Seneca the Elder c.&amp;nbsp;3 BC&amp;nbsp;– 65 AD|''Excerpta Controversiae'' 2.7&lt;ref&gt;Seneca (1974), p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Gladiateur Begram Guimet 18117.jpg|thumb|upright|Roman glass, dated 52–125 AD and found at [[Begram]], Afghanistan, a royal city of the Kushan Empire where, according to [[Warwick Ball]], it was likely on its way to China via the Silk Road along with other glass items.&lt;ref name="ball 2016 p153-154"/&gt;]]

Trade items such as spice and silk had to be paid for with Roman gold coinage. There was some demand in China for Roman glass; the Han Chinese also produced glass in certain locations.&lt;ref name="ball 2016 p153-154"&gt;Ball (2016), pp. 153–154.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whitfield 1999 p21"/&gt; Chinese-produced glassware date back to the Western Han era (202 BC – 9 AD).&lt;ref&gt;An (2002), pp. 82–83.&lt;/ref&gt; In dealing with foreign states such as the Parthian Empire, the Han Chinese were perhaps more concerned with diplomatically outmaneuvering their chief enemies, the nomadic [[Xiongnu]], than with establishing trade, since mercantile pursuits and the [[Four occupations|merchant class]] were frowned upon by the [[Scholar-official|gentry]] who [[Government of the Han dynasty|dominated the Han government]].&lt;ref&gt;Ball (2016), p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Background====
{{multiple image|align=right|direction=horizontal|header=|header_align=left/right/center|footer=[[Byzantine silk]] textile fragments, from left to right: a [[horse archer]] and a lion, 8th century AD; Byzantine or Spanish woven silk, 9th–10th century AD; [[griffin]]s from an embroidered silk robe, 11th century AD| footer_align=left|image1=Textielschat08.jpg|width1=100|image2=Textielschat10.jpg|width2=185|image3=11th century Byzantine griffins.gif|width3=195}}

Shortly after the [[smuggling of silkworm eggs into the Byzantine Empire]] from China by [[Nestorian Christian]] monks, the 6th-century AD Byzantine historian [[Menander Protector]] wrote of how the Sogdians attempted to establish a direct trade of Chinese silk with the [[Byzantine Empire]]. After forming an alliance with the Sasanian Persian ruler [[Khosrow I]] to defeat the [[Hephthalite Empire]], [[Istämi]], the [[Göktürk]] ruler of the [[Turkic Khaganate]], was approached by Sogdian merchants requesting permission to seek an audience with the Sasanian king of kings for the privilege of travelling through Persian territories to trade with the Byzantines.&lt;ref name="howard 2012 p133"&gt;Howard (2012), p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Istämi refused the first request, but when he sanctioned the second one and had the Sogdian embassy sent to the Sasanian king, the latter had the members of the embassy killed by poison.&lt;ref name="howard 2012 p133"/&gt; Maniakh, a Sogdian diplomat, convinced Istämi to send an embassy directly to Byzantium's capital [[Constantinople]], which arrived in 568 AD and offered not only silk as a gift to Byzantine ruler [[Justin II]], but also an alliance against Sasanian Persia. Justin II agreed and sent an embassy under [[Zemarchus]] to the Turkic Khaganate, ensuring the direct silk trade desired by the Sogdians.&lt;ref name="howard 2012 p133"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liu (2001), p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dresden (1981), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Archaeological finds====
The small number of [[Roman currency|Roman]] and [[Byzantine coinage|Byzantine coins]] found during excavations of Central Asian and Chinese archaeological sites from this era suggests that direct trade with the Sogdians remained limited. This was despite the fact that ancient Romans imported Han Chinese silk,&lt;ref&gt;Brosius (2006), pp. 122–123.&lt;/ref&gt; and discoveries in contemporary tombs indicate that the [[Economy of the Han dynasty|Han-dynasty Chinese]] imported Roman glassware.&lt;ref name="an 2002 pp79-94"&gt;An (2002), pp. 79–94.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Valerie Hansen]] wrote in 2012 that no Roman coins from the [[Roman Republic]] (507–27 BC) or the [[Principate]] (27 BC – 284 AD) era of the [[Roman Empire]] have been found in China.&lt;ref name="hansen 2012 p97"&gt;Hansen (2012), p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Warwick Ball]] (2016) highlights a discovery at [[Xi'an]], China (the site of the Han capital [[Chang'an]]) where a hoard of sixteen Roman coins from the reigns of [[Tiberius]] (14–37 AD) to [[Aurelian]] (270–275 AD) have been discovered.&lt;ref name="ball 2016 p154"&gt;Ball (2016), p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman coins found at Óc Eo, Vietnam, near Chinese-controlled [[Jiaozhou (region)|Jiaozhou]], date to the mid-2nd century AD.&lt;ref name="young 2001 p 29"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oreilly 2007 p97"&gt;O'Reilly (2007), p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; A coin of Maximian (r. 286–305 AD) was also discovered in [[Tonkin]].&lt;ref name="ball 2016 p153"/&gt; Roman coins of the 3rd and 4th centuries AD have been discovered in Japan; they were unearthed from [[Katsuren Castle]] (in [[Uruma, Okinawa]]), which was built from the 12th to 15th centuries AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Japan Times]]|date=26 September 2016|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/09/26/national/history/ancient-roman-coins-unearthed-castle-ruins-okinawa/#.V-lheSSo32s|title=Ancient Roman coins unearthed from castle ruins in Okinawa|accessdate=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest gold [[Solidus (coin)|''solidus'' coins]] from the Eastern Roman Empire found in China date to the reign of Byzantine emperor [[Theodosius II]] (r. 408–450 AD) and altogether only forty-eight of them have been found (compared to 1300 silver coins) in [[Xinjiang]] and the rest of China.&lt;ref name="hansen 2012 p97"/&gt; The use of silver coins in [[Turfan]] persisted long after the [[Tang campaign against Karakhoja]] and Chinese conquest of 640 AD, with a gradual adoption of [[Ancient Chinese coinage|Chinese bronze coinage]] during the 7th century AD.&lt;ref name="hansen 2012 p97" /&gt; Hansen maintains that these Eastern Roman coins were almost always found with [[Monetary history of Iran|Sasanian Persian silver coins]] and Eastern Roman gold coins were used more as ceremonial objects like [[talisman]]s, confirming the pre-eminence of [[Greater Iran]] in Chinese Silk Road commerce of Central Asia compared to Eastern Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen (2012), pp. 97–98.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Scheidel]] remarks that the Chinese viewed Byzantine coins as pieces of exotic jewellery, preferring to use bronze coinage in the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song dynasty|Song]] dynasties, as well as [[Banknote|paper money]] during the Song and Ming periods, even while silver [[bullion]] was plentiful.&lt;ref&gt;Scheidel (2009), p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; Ball writes that the scarcity of Roman and Byzantine coins in China, and the greater amounts found in India, suggest that most Chinese silk purchased by the Romans was from maritime India, largely bypassing the overland [[Silk Road]] trade through Iran.&lt;ref name="ball 2016 p154"/&gt; Chinese coins from the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] and Tang dynasties (6th–10th centuries AD) have been discovered in India; significantly larger amounts are dated to the Song period (11th–13th centuries AD), particularly in the territories of the contemporary [[Chola dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Bagchi (2011), pp. 137–144.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even with the Byzantine production of silk starting in the 6th century AD, Chinese varieties were still considered to be of higher quality.&lt;ref name="luttwak 2008 pp168-169"/&gt; This theory is supported by the discovery of a Byzantine ''solidus'' minted during the reign of [[Justin II]] found in a Sui-dynasty tomb of [[Shanxi]] province in 1953, among other Byzantine coins found at various sites.&lt;ref name="luttwak 2008 pp168-169"&gt;Luttwak (2009), pp. 168–169.&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese histories offer descriptions of Roman and Byzantine coins. The ''[[Weilüe]]'', ''Book of the Later Han'', ''[[Book of Jin]]'', as well as the later ''[[Wenxian Tongkao]]'' noted how ten ancient Roman silver coins were worth one Roman gold coin.&lt;ref name="halsall 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hill 2004 webpage"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yule 1915 pp43-44"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scheidel (2009), footnote #239 on p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman golden ''[[aureus]]'' was worth about twenty-five silver ''[[denarius|denarii]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Corbier (2005), p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt; During the later Byzantine Empire, twelve silver ''[[miliaresion]]'' was equal to one gold ''[[nomisma]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Yule (1915), footnote #1 on p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[History of Song]]'' notes that the Byzantines made coins of either silver or gold, [[Ancient Chinese coinage#early round coins|without holes in the middle]], with an inscription of the king's name.&lt;ref name="halsall 2000"/&gt; It also asserts that the Byzantines forbade the production of counterfeit coins.&lt;ref name="halsall 2000"/&gt;

==Human remains==
In 2010, [[mitochondrial DNA]] was used to identify that a partial skeleton found in a Roman grave from the 1st or 2nd century AD in Vagnari, Italy, had [[East Asian]] ancestry on his mother's side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/history/ambassador-or-slave-east-asian-skeleton-discovered-in-vagnari-roman-cemetery-1879551.html|title=Ambassador or slave?

A 2016 analysis of archaeological finds from [[Southwark]] in London, the site of the ancient Roman city [[Londinium]] in [[Roman Britain]], suggests that two or three skeletons from a sample of twenty-two dating to the 2nd to the 4th centuries AD are of Asian ancestry, and possibly of Chinese descent. The assertion is based on forensics and the analysis of skeletal facial features. The discovery has been presented by Dr Rebecca Redfern, curator of human [[osteology]] at the [[Museum of London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=23 September 2016 |url = https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-37452287 |title=Skeleton find could rewrite Roman history |work=BBC News|accessdate=24 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca C.

[[File:Margiana-300BCE.png|thumb|The Roman prisoners of the [[Battle of Carrhae]] were brought to [[Margiana]] by king [[Orodes II of Parthia|Orodes]]. Their further fate is unknown.]]

The historian [[Homer H. Dubs]] speculated in 1941 that Roman prisoners of war who were transferred to the eastern border of the Parthian empire might later have clashed with Han troops there.&lt;ref&gt;Dubs (1941), pp. 322–330.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a Roman army under the command of [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]] decisively lost the [[battle of Carrhae]] in 54&amp;nbsp;BC, an estimated 10,000&amp;nbsp;Roman prisoners were dispatched by the Parthians to [[Margiana]] to man the frontier. Some time later the nomadic [[Xiongnu]] chief [[Zhizhi]] established a state further east in the [[Talas River|Talas valley]], near modern-day [[Taraz]]. Dubs points to a Chinese account by [[Ban Gu]] of about "a hundred men" under the command of Zhizhi who fought in a so-called "fish-scale formation" to defend Zhizhi's wooden-palisade fortress against [[Han Dynasty|Han]] forces, in the [[Battle of Zhizhi]] in 36 BC. He claimed that this might have been the Roman [[testudo formation]] and that these men, who were captured by the Chinese, founded the [[Liqian village|village of Liqian]] (Li-chien, possibly from "legio") in [[Yongchang County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeology.org/9905/newsbriefs/china.html|title=Romans in China?|website=Archaeology|date=May–June 1999|volume=52|number=3|author=Hoh, Erling|publisher= [[Archaeological Institute of America]]|accessdate=10 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-08/24/content_3396301.htm|title=Romans in China stir up controversy|publisher=Xinhua online|work=China Daily|date=24 August 2005|accessdate=10 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''St. Francisville''' is a town in, and the [[parish seat]] of, [[West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana|West Feliciana Parish]], [[Louisiana]], United States.&lt;ref name="GR6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|accessdate=2011-06-07|title=Find a County|publisher=National Association of Counties}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population was 1,712 at the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]]. It is part of the [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] [[Baton Rouge metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]].

==Geography==
St. Francisville is located at {{Coord|30|47|5|N|91|22|50|W|}}.&lt;ref name="GR1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of 1.8&amp;nbsp;square miles (4.7&amp;nbsp;km²), all land.

==History==
The town of St. Francisville was established in 1809, and a number of historic structures from that period still exist. Called "the town two miles long and two yards wide" because it was developed atop a narrow ridge overlooking the [[Mississippi River]], it was the commercial and cultural center of the surrounding plantation country. Below St. Francisville's [[Beach ridge|bluff]]s, another early settlement called ''Bayou Sara'' had been established by French colonists in the early 1790s. It was at one time the largest [[antebellum South|antebellum]] Mississippi River [[port]] between [[New Orleans]] and [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], but was superseded by Natchez. The settlement was gradually destroyed by repeated flooding and fires, and nothing exists of Bayou Sara today. A few of its surviving structures were hauled up the hill into St. Francisville in the 1920s. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}} This area and other former French-controlled territories east of the Mississippi River was taken over by Great Britain after it defeated France in the [[Seven Years' War]] in 1763.

At the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]], Great Britain ceded what it called [[West Florida]] to Spain in 1783, as part of the Treaty of Paris. There were years of contention as to exactly where the eastern boundary of the 1803 [[Louisiana Purchase]] was—depending on which treaty was cited, as France, Great Britain, and Spain had redrawn the boundaries among themselves during the second half of the 18th century. [[New Spain|Spain]] continued to claim territory on the eastern side of the Mississippi River until it and the United States settled this issue in the Pinckney Treaty. This region is today called the [[Florida Parishes]].

In 1810, St. Francisville served as the [[capital city|capital]] of the [[Republic of West Florida]], when area [[Planter (American South)|planters]] ousted the [[Spanish West Florida|Spanish government]] of the [[Baton Rouge District]] and set up their own independent republic for 74 days, before being annexed to the [[Territory of Orleans]], as a possession of the [[United States]].

In 1824, when [[Feliciana Parish, Louisiana|Feliciana Parish]] was split into East and West, St. Francisville became the seat of [[West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana|West Feliciana Parish]]'s government.

In June 1863, [[Confederate Army]] officer [[William Walter Leake]] arranged for the burial here of [[Union Navy]] officer [[John E. Hart]], who had died aboard his ship while taking part in the Union blockade of the Mississippi River. This event is re-enacted every June during a three-day commemoration called "The Day the War Stopped."&lt;ref name="Pena"&gt;{{cite book|last=Peña|first=Christopher|title=The Day the War Stopped|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[American Civil War]], some [[Jewish]] emigrants fleeing religious persecution in Germany settled here. They made important contributions to commerce in the lean years following the war. Becoming successful merchants, they provided credit when the banks failed and built impressive [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] homes, such as the Wolf-Schlessinger House. It is now operated as the St. Francisville Inn [[Bed and Breakfast]]. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

===2000 to present===
In recent years, community efforts have focused on restoration and preservation of the town's historic homes. St. Francisville is a popular [[tourism|tourist]] destination, with a number of restored historic [[Plantations in the American South|plantations]] open for tours, including [[Rosedown Plantation]] State Historic Site, [[Audubon State Historic Site]], [[Butler Greenwood Plantation]], [[Myrtles Plantation|the Myrtles]], and the Cottage Plantation, as well as several [[antebellum era|antebellum]] gardens.

'''''The History of the White Mountains from the First Settlement of Upper Coos and Pequaket''''' was written by [[Abel Crawford|Lucy Crawford]] and first published in 1846, with a revised and expanded edition written in 1860 but not published until 1966.

Lucy Howe was a first cousin of Ethan Allen Crawford, whom she married in November 1817. The couple had met while caring for their ailing grandfather, Eleazar Rosebrook, a pioneering hotelier at [[Crawford Notch]] in the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] of [[New Hampshire]], US. Their marriage took place months after the death of Eleazar, whose property Ethan had been given. The couple spent many years in the area, with a brief time living at [[Guildhall, Vermont]], and through much of it they were pioneers in the development of tourism there. Ill-health eventually took its toll on Ethan and during his final years he told Lucy of many episodes from his life which she was able to turn into a book about both him and the area. Ethan died on 22 June 1846 and the book was published soon after.{{sfnp|Johnson|2006|pp=49-62|ps=}} Lucy died in 1869.{{sfnp|Julyan|Julyan|1993|pp=34-36|ps=}}

Written in Ethan's voice,{{sfnp|Bennett|2003|p=55|ps=}} the 1846 edition, which  Pavel Cenkl believes Lucy intended to be in large part a paean to Ethan, building up his image so that more people would might ask him to be their mountain guide,{{sfnp|Cenkl|2009|p=44|ps=}} did not sell particularly well. Crawford wrote a revised version around 1860 that expanded the scope such that it contained more about the area, effectively reducing the concentration on Ethan's own life. This version was kept in the family until finally being published in 1966, with the editorial assistance of [[Stearns Morse]].{{sfnp|Cenkl|2009|p=37|ps=}} Lucy had been unable to afford publication, although she did eventually manage to pay for some illustrations that she had commissioned for the project.{{sfnp|Cenkl|2009|p=51|ps=}}

Christopher Johnson says "it was and remains a beloved White Mountain classic". and that the book is of a similar genre to those that recount tales of American pioneers such as [[Davy Crockett]] and [[Daniel Boone]].{{sfnp|Johnson|2006|pp=62-63|ps=}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2543">'''Trinidad Tarrosa-Subido''' (1912, [[Shanghai, China]] – 1994) was a [[Philippines|Filipino]] linguist and poet.

==Biography==
'''Trinidad Tarrosa-Subido''' was born in Socorro oriental mindoro, where her father worked as a star
. After her father's death, she and her mother returned to [[Manila]] in 1917. She graduated from Manila East High School, and in 1929, she took the civil service examination in order to work in the Bureau of Education, and passed it with a grade of 97 percent, the highest then on record. She enrolled as a working student at the [[University of the Philippines Manila]] in 1932 and met her husband Abelardo Subido. She became a member of the UP Writers Club and contributed her sonnets.

She got married in 1936 and graduated magna cum laude the following year. She then began to work at the Institute of National Language. In 1940, she published ''Tagalog Phonetics and Orthography'', which she co-authored with Virginia Gamboa-Mendoza. In 1945, she and her husband published poems titled ''Three Voices'', with an introduction by [[Salvador P. Lopez]].

After the war, the Subidos put up a daily newspaper, ''The Manila Post'', which closed in 1947 and made her a freelance writer. She then became editor of ''Kislap-Graphic'' and ''Philippine Home Economics Journal''.

She retired in 1971, and in 1984, she was invited by the Women in Media Now to write the introduction to ''Filipina I'', the first anthology consisting of works made exclusively by Filipino women. She was honored in 1991 by the Unyon ng Mga Manunulat sa Pilipinas (UMPIL).

She died in 1994.

In 2002, her family published a manuscript Tarrosa-Subido had been working on at the time of her death. Titled ''Private Edition: Sonnets and Other Poems'' (Milestone Publication), the retrospective volume contains 89 poems, a few of them revised and retitled versions of the originals.One of them is "To My Native Land"

'''Vecepia Towery-Robinson''' is an [[United States|American]] [[office manager]] and reality TV personality, best known for winning ''[[Survivor: Marquesas]]'', the fourth season of ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]''.

==Early life and career==
Towery was born in [[Portland, Oregon]], where she attended [[Grant High School (Portland, Oregon)|Grant High School]] and [[Portland Community College]] before going on to receive her bachelor's degree in human services from [[Troy University|Troy State University]] in Alabama.&lt;ref name=sfgate&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first= Henry K.|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2002/05/21/MN234525.DTL|title=Hayward woman 'sole Survivor': First African American to win TV show's $1 million prize|publisher=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=May 21, 2002|accessdate=October 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She served six years in the [[U.S. Air Force]], assigned to the 32nd Security Police Squadron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.survivorfever.net/vecepia.html|title=Survivor Fever - Vecepia Towery - Survivor: Marquesas|work=survivorfever.net|accessdate=March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She served in [[Soesterberg, Netherlands]] for several years and was later inducted into the Air Force's Europe Sports Hall of Fame&lt;ref name=sfgate/&gt; She was stationed in [[Turkey]] during [[Operation Desert Storm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gilatto|first1=Tom|title=Vee for Victory|accessdate=May 7, 2017|work=People|issue=Vol. 57, No. 21|publisher=Time, Inc.|date=June 3, 2002|url=http://people.com/archive/vee-for-victory-vol-57-no-21/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towery once managed the office at a [[software development]] company. She has also worked as the guest relations manager for [[St. Rose Hospital]] in [[Hayward, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barney|first1=Chuck|title=The forgotten 'Survivor'|work=Contra Costa Times|publisher=[[MediaNews Group]]|date=April 1, 2010|page=1D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Survivor''==
In 2001, Towery decided to apply for the reality TV competition show ''[[Survivor (US TV series)|Survivor]]''. Despite searching the [[Internet]] and contacting [[CBS]]' [[New York City|New York]] headquarters directly, she was unable to find information on how to apply, and quickly gave up her quest. About a month later, claiming to have received a [[direct revelation|sign from God]], she resumed her search and found the application information that she needed at CBS' own Web site. Shortly thereafter, she was cast on ''[[Survivor: Marquesas]]'', the series' fourth season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hertz|first1=Todd|title=Christian Survivors Playing a Non-Christian Game|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2003/mayweb-only/31.0b.html|accessdate=May 7, 2017|work=Christianity Today|publisher=Christianity Today|date=May 1, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally part of the Maraamu tribe, Towery was not a target at the beginning of the game. When her tribe lost the first [[Immunity (reality television)|immunity]] challenge, she did not join the rest of her tribe to vote out Peter Harkey, but—together with Sean Rector—voted for Sarah Jones, believing that she was not pulling her weight. When Maraamu lost immunity once again in [[Survivor: Marquesas#Episode 2: Nacho Momma|Episode Two]], she joined Rector, [[Rob Mariano]] and Jones to vote out the tribe's motherly figure, Patricia Jackson, due to her bossy attitude. When the tribe lost immunity once again in [[Survivor: Marquesas#Episode 3: No Pain, No Gain|Episode Three]], the new alliance of four targeted the tribe's strongest member, [[Hunter Ellis]], and he was voted out.

In [[Survivor: Marquesas#Episode 4: The Winds Twist|Episode Four]], a tribal shuffle resulted in Towery moving from the Maraamu tribe to the Rotu tribe, along with Mariano and Rector. But Jones was left on Maraamu alone and was voted out shortly after. An immunity win in [[Survivor: Marquesas#Episode 6: The Underdogs|Episode Six]] ensured Mariano, Rector, and Towery safety going into the merge.

When the two tribes merged into one, Soliantu, the old-Rotu members targeted the alliance of Towery, Rector and Mariano. Seemingly doomed, Mariano was the first targeted due to his excessive scheming; even Towery voted for him at tribal council as a way to distance herself from her old alliance. At the Final Nine, Towery and Rector convinced Kathy Vavrick-O'Brien to side with them against the Rotu Four, but they also needed the votes of Paschal English and [[Neleh Dennis]] to ensure a majority. Both English and Dennis were against the idea, but an immunity challenge which revealed the pecking order of the game, and which showed the arrogance of the Rotu alliance, allowed them to see they were playing for fifth or sixth place. As a result, Dennis and English sided with Towery, Rector and Vavrick-O'Brien, and voted out John Carroll, the Rotu alliance leader.

With the new five-way alliance holding the power, it systematically voted out the members of the broken alliance one after the other, beginning with Zoe Zanidakis, then [[Tammy Leitner]], and finally Robert DeCanio. At the Final Five, Towery and Rector let Vavrick-O'Brien know she was clearly a swing vote as the bond between Dennis and English was too strong to be broken. Despite denying a two-way alliance between themselves, Rector and Towery stayed together and voted against Dennis. But Vavrick-O'Brien sided with Dennis and English, and Rector was voted out, leaving Towery without any allies.

Obviously the next target, Towery knew she needed to win immunity and did exactly that, guaranteeing herself a spot in the Final Three. Immediately Vavrick-O'Brien, realizing she could be voted out, made a Final Two alliance with Towery. They voted against Dennis who, along with English, voted against Vavrick-O'Brien, resulting in a very tight deadlock. Having two minutes to decide, the four could not reach a decision and a tie-breaker was put in place. Because Towery had immunity, the remaining three castaways drew rocks in order to determine who was voted out. English, even though he had never received any votes against him, drew the purple rock and was eliminated. This was a very controversial move by the ''Survivor'' producers and was even admitted to being a mistake. From that point on, the drawing of rocks has never been used in a Final Four situation, with the producers opting to use a fire-building challenge instead.

Once in the Final Three, Vavrick-O'Brien and Towery's alliance seemed sure to hold out, but when the former fell in the endurance immunity challenge, the latter made a deal to give immunity to Dennis in exchange for taking Towery to the Final Two. Dennis agreed and Vavrick-O'Brien was voted out. Once in the Final Two, both Towery and Dennis faced accusations of hypocrisy by the jury, and Towery explained that she was playing a very strategic game. In the end, Towery beat out Dennis in a 4–3 vote to become the Sole Survivor, gaining the votes of Carroll, Leitner, DeCanio, and Rector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Hayward-s-own-Survivor-She-wins-1-million-2834106.php |title=Hayward's own 'Survivor' / She wins $1 million from CBS-TV show |work=SFGate |access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
While ''[[Survivor: Marquesas]]'' was still airing, Towery married Leander Robinson,&lt;ref name=sfgate /&gt; who had made a brief appearance on the episode where loved ones of the remaining castaways came to visit. The birth of their son, Jordan Robinson, was later the subject of an episode of [[TLC (TV channel)|TLC]]'s ''[[A Baby Story]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Catlin|first1=Roger|title=A Decent Movie About Natalie Wood|url=http://articles.courant.com/2004-03-01/features/0403010488_1_west-side-story-reality-show-natalie-wood|accessdate=May 7, 2017|work=Hartford Courant|date=March 1, 2004|location=Also Tonight}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her nephew, [[Roy Williams (safety)|Roy L.
